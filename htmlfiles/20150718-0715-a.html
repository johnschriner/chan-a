[ Best cover story aside from From the Decks of the World.  Do you guys think bellamy will actually become a crew member? he seems like the most likely out of dressrosa at the least.  <br>at this point yes he is the strongest candidate<br><br>but<br> redundant power set <br> may wind up with Law because tattoo <br> Viola still a strong contender <br> he's kind of a fucking loser </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More likely to join Laws crew because<br><br>1. His chest tattoo can easily be changed to Laws.<br><br>2. He originally joined Doffy for being the pride of the North Blue, Law is also from the North Blue.<br><br>3. He wants to survive the great wave mentioned in pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be no-one from Dressrosa.</br>  <br><br>That and I can't imagine Nami being comfortable with it. Though Luffy wouldn't listen to protests anyway.</br></br>  <br>Second best you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>He's going to go an adventure alone to find his true self.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Oda paired Jinbei and Sanji up in FMI to convey them as equals. While I feel like Jinbei is stronger, I pair them together still because they're similar and close in general.<br> <br>Jinbei's body is naturally better at handling something like that. He's much larger and possibly has organs spaced out more/differently. Like with Ace, Sakazuki's magmafist is large in comparison to the torso and therefore is much more likely to kill Zoro/Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> Viola still a strong contender <br>Anon you could have made sense if you just didn't add this.</br></br>  <br> was a consenting member of the pirate crew the marines are arresting <br> first girl to actually like sanji back <br> unique and practical powerset <br> unique group dynamic (isn't a slut) <br> Rebecca can be princess in her stead </br></br></br></br></br>  so is sabo strong, or is burger weak?<br><br>is sabo possibly as strong as doffy? stronger?<br><br>do you think sabo is stronger than g4 luffy? (obviously he would win a 1v1 either way, he'd outlast like doffy did most likely)</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd be better off with Law.</br>  <br>All of that is irrelevant. And Rebecca can't become the queen, legally she isn't allowed to. Honestly, Rebecca has a more likely chance of joining than Viola.</br>  <br> legally <br><br>they JUST overthrew the government...</br></br></br>  <br>If he's the second strongest member of the revolutionaries it would make sense that he can beat somebody who's only like the 5th or 6th strongest member of a yonkou crew. <br><br>Sabo is probably around Marcos lever.</br></br></br>  <br> Has a fruit that ruins every part of adventure and exploration. <br><br>You can't honestly think Sanji will finally get what he wants right?</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter. She may be blood to Riku, but her mother abandoned the throne. She wasn't born into royalty. She's just a regular woman. And I really don't see her becoming the princess. Viola's powers are more suited for keeping the kingdom under a watchful eye, which would fit with One Piece's way of doing things after an arc or with cover stories. Plus, why do you want someone who can see what's coming ahead before it happens? That's not what Luffy would want.</br>  <br>Viola is so similar to Robin though. Monet/Perona would have been a nice change-up.</br>  <br> lever </br>  <br>They're pulling each others levers all day anon. You can't deny it.</br>  <br>Agreed, not saying she's the best most interesting possible new female nakama, just that she has a good chance.</br>   people still think Straw Hats are getting a new crewmember out of this <br>nobody in Dressrosa stood out except Law and he's not joining</br>  <br>Brook was the first one to sacrifice himself.</br>  <br>Honestly, after the Paulie feint, I don't even pretend to know who Oda's going to have join or not.</br>  <br>You mean after Robin, right?</br>  <br>Actually, regardless of who did what and when, in the end the order of royalty will go by bloodline. I don't remember who was older, Viola or Rebecca's mom, but whoever was older would rule next. I believe Viola. If Rebecca's mom was older then at the moment next in line is Rebecca (followed by Viola of Rebecca dies before birthing kids).</br>  <br>it was rebeccas mom, she's next in line.<br><br>I wish that kyros became king though, hes able to protect his country with strengh if he has to, and hes nice like king riku. just seems ideal</br></br></br>  <br>He can't. Not a drop of royal blood. But, he can rule by proxie, more or less, as an advisor to his daughter.<br><br>I agree he is strong, but is he wise enough yet? It's true that we see a transition of him going from hooligan to an actual asset to the crown. And while that does take scruples to be picked up or developed, I doubt he's fully there yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Jango's Dance Paradise a  underrated but still not better than Miss Goldenweek's </br>  <br>Ha! That was one of those Oda stunts that left a deep impression on me. I felt so confused when it first happened.</br>  <br>I like how those two overlapped through coverstories. The bromance formed between Jango and Fullbody and the fun of it makes it my favourite. Baroque Works one was also enjoyable though.</br>  <br>I want him to join up with Barto and Cavendish as a Strawhat fanboy</br>  what will be sanjis new secret technique that puts him back in the top 3 strongest strawhat? <br><br>Honestly though the monster trio has become very broken, zorro is miles ahead of sanji and luffy is on a whole level entirely compared to the rest of crew ( just like every other captain)<br><br>I think the new monster trio is going to be ussop zorro sanji once ussop and sanji get their shit together</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I can't really pick a favourite.</br>  <br> not Zoro, Franky and Sanji <br>they're the heavy hitters that aren't Luffy. Chopper could also be up there if he was better at actually fighting.</br></br>  <br> x=26+x <br><br>Iva taught him how to wink REALLY hard<br><br>or him being able to fly is really handy for Godzilla sized bosses</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daz is the most underrated cutie<br><br>Does ANYONE have a more adorable dream?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks, Law and Kuzan suddenly got really hot<br><br>Honorable mention to Helmeppo</br></br></br>  <br>Sarkies was the one that Doflamingo controlled to cut down (and presumably kill at that time) Bellamy.</br>  <br> 1. The first timeskip that occurred was when luffy was 10 and higuma was the first named character to be killed and the next named character was Lacuba at the slave house who bit his tongue. <br>Pretty sure it was Roshio actually.</br></br>  Aokiji isn't actually allied with Blackbeard is he? He must have some sort of scheme.  <br>probably</br>  <br>There must be something else, however I don't see Kuzan betraying BB, because BB is not the kind of guy one would be truly be surprised to see outsmarted, imho Kuzan will try to use BB to destroy the WG.</br>  <br>He is, but not for the purpose of supporting him.</br>  <br>I know Luffy is stronger than the others but I can't see Zoro being too entirely far behind. He's scary when he wants to be.</br>  I'm looking for a new anime but I'm hesitant to watch one piece as I watched it as a child and I didn't like it.<br><br>I've only just got into anime and my favourite so far is fairy tail. I like childish humor and strong emotion, fairy tail made me cry and cheer and I'm hoping one piece will do the same what do you guys think are they similar?</br></br>  <br>I think you're a faggot for liking Fairy Tail.</br>    <br>I'm a girl.</br>  <br>I'm a prettier girl.</br>  <br>If you really are an animeonlyfag then watch the first 310 episodes but then switch to the manga. But beware that you will quickly come to realize that Fairy Tail is utter shit compared to One Piece.</br>  <br>Why didn't you like it?</br>  <br>Doubtful. Since you're so boastful I'll let you post a timestamped picture of yourself first.<br><br>9/10 average on /soc/ let's see you.</br></br></br>  <br>After watching and reading One Piece for years I started watching Fairy Tail and it really is inferior to One Piece in pretty much every category.</br>  <br>It creeped me out, the main character how he stretched his body, I was 10 or 11.</br>  <br>So you didn't like One Piece because of a rubber boy's ability to stretch? I mean if you're half mature now, then that wont even matter. Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece.</br>  <br>And you've probably seen the dub right?</br>  <br> Fairy Tail Shanks is pre-timeskip Shanks <br>Deep.</br></br>  <br>4kids dub undoubtedly.</br>  <br>Yes, it left a sour taste. That picture is interesting. I'll take your advice than and give it a chance.<br><br><br>Yes, does that matter? I can't really watch subs unless I mute it which makes it unwatchable the language puts me off.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep thinking there's gonna be another crew member? Luffy said he only wanted 10 people in his crew at the start:<br><br>1. Luffy<br>2. Zoro<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Sanji<br>6. Chopper<br>7. Robin<br>8. Franky<br>9. Brook<br>10.  Thousand Sunny </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dub is the reason you didnt liked it in the first place, that wasnt one piece, go and watch the sub now and see you in 2 or 3 weeks after finished, go and search some page who show you what chapters are fillers and what you can see so yo can watch like 100 less chapters</br>  <br>luffy doesnt count</br>  <br>As much as I really like the idea of Bellamy joining after all these years and becoming a good guy, he's going to end going with Law. The whole 'dark past with Doflamingo' and the tattoo just kind of seal the deal.<br><br>Either that, or he's going to go off on his own and make his own crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Burgess is strong as shit. Sabo is just stronger, and that whole scene was just Burgess being a jobber to hype up Sabo.</br>  <br>Luffy said that he wanted 10 nakama/crewmates. That doesn't include himself.<br>1. Zoro<br>2. Sanji<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Chopper<br>6. Robin<br>7. Franky<br>8. Brook<br><br>That leaves two spots.<br>Jinbei is pretty much confirmed, leaving just one more opening. Oda also said some time post timeskip that there would be more members joining the crew (so likely the two final ones), and he said they'd show up successively.<br><br>Jinbei is highly likely to actually connect and properly join at Zou (next arc), and it'd be likely that we get someone from the following arc based on what Oda said, meaning Wano. I personally think it'll either be Kinemon, some samurai or  Monet if she's somehow alive </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure Jimbei all but confirmed joining the crew, he only had "something to do" which prevented him from joining at that point.<br><br>Now that he has the Poneglyph he'll probably join up the next time they meet.</br></br></br></br>  Oda said there would be more crewmates coming.<br><br>I think that there will be 12 of them at the very, very max at the end of OP.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I was saying.<br><br>Luffy asked him to join and he accepted, and especially now with the poneglyph, I don't know how anyone could deny it.</br></br></br>  <br>Jimbe refused to go simply because his presence in the crew would make future fights extremely trvial for quite some time. Oda obviously wants Jimbe to be in the crew but cannot allow it until the Strawhats and their enemies reach Jimbe's level. That way, his sudden power introduction wouldn't be so jarring.</br>  <br>Good thing we're about to reach the Yonkous now isn't it.</br>  <br>The stalling was pretty smart. Jinbei's current bounty exceeds Luffy's, so atleast post-Dressrosa will raise Luffy's to 550 million or so, giving Jinbei's some room without encroaching Luffy's too much.</br>  <br>Luffy and zoro are already shown to be stronger than jimbei already. He is stronger than sanji but weaker than zoro.</br>  <br>No, they aren't. Jimbe is still in a league of his own and is a former Shichibukai. I doubt that Zoro can bat Doflamingo on his own, and Luffy was barely able to do it.</br>  <br>And I don't see jinbei beating doffy either.</br>  <br>Xusasu Basasu got his ass kicked by Ace earlier, and then got his ass kicked by Sabo. He's supposed to be strong, but definitely isn't as strong as the number 2 of the Revolutionaries. <br><br>Sabo is likely around Admiral tier, and Xusasu is likely somewhere below that, though probably a bit higher than Luffy.</br></br></br>  Jimbei did mention "things", so maybe there's something other than the Poneglyph.  <br>Robin used to be so hot.</br>  I understand some hype around Monet given personal preferences and taste. Im not particularly fond of her character in any way but hey. <br><br>However, I fail to understand how, not being driven by one's own doujin wishes, would somebody think she is anywhere near being a new crewmember.</br></br>  <br>Had to go help that kitten.</br>  <br> not living a life being driven by one's own doujin wishes </br>  <br><br>In/near water Jinbei is more than likely to win.</br></br>  <br>Ace was a deadly logia who was the second division commander of a yonkou, while Blackbeard's crewmates were just newish recruits of Blackbeard who were probably strong back in the blues/early GL. Of course they'd have nothing on Ace back then, same goes for the SHs including Luffy. <br><br>Sabo is under admiral level; around Doflamingo I'd say. Jesus is strong, yes, but I'd put him equal to or a bit below Luffy now that he has G4.<br><br>Still though; Burgess isn't weak. Losing to a very strong character =/= weak, despite what many people seem to think.<br><br><br>That's the ties to Big Mom he's got to cut, but where is Big Mom right now? Dressrosa/Zou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> used to be <br>she is even hotter now</br></br>  <br>Robin's in her hotness prime currently.</br>  <br>She used to be the prettiest and most unique-looking woman in all anime and manga. Now she's just a generic hottie. I miss those bangs.</br>  How strong was Roger really?<br><br>He could hear sea kings, rivaled WB without any known devil fruit and commanded a legend like Rayleigh.<br><br>Still, I'd find it hilarious if it all turned out to be some red herring and Roger was extremely weak winning all his fights by pure luck.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Roger recruited Buggy because he reminded him of himself. Buggy will be the next Pirate King </br></br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope.</br></br>  <br>What's up with Luffy's left arm? (His left, our right)</br>  <br>Buggy vs God Usopp<br><br>Who wins?</br></br></br>  <br>It's just shrouded by the stream produced by Gear Second.</br>  <br><br>Usopp and all the dolls he rescued in Dressrosa<br><br>Vs.<br><br>Buggy and all the criminals from Impel down</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one true god.</br>  <br>I miss her too. She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br><br>Big boobs don't always make things better.</br></br></br>  <br> She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br>eeeeeh, sorry but when she first appeared she looked awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br>You like a little Miss All-Sunday hey?</br>  <br>Yeah but how is he holding it? Is it bent or is cut off from our view? There's also a weird bulge near the armpit.</br>  <br>On paper Buggy seems like an incredibly powerful pirate.<br> is a Shichibukai <br> was on Gol Rodgers crew <br> long time childhood friends with a Yonkou <br> part of one of the only successful escapes from Impel Down <br> leads tons of powerful pirates <br> was part of the Whitebeard War of the Greatest <br>The man's resume packs a punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Chopper and Robin are the only Straw Hats left that don't have a Number chapter. Chopper's The Sixth seems to be related to some sort of Vegapunk arc, but Robin's The Seventh is ambiguous. You'd think her chapter would have been during Enies Lobby, but it wasn't. So what's left for her? Her guilt about Vivi? Something about the Poneglyphs regarding the Will of D.?  <br>And then you realize he's just like Zonge.</br>  <br> Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece. <br>That's a severe overstatement<br>Fairy tail is repetitive titty bait and a poor man's dbz (muh courage, muh resolution, muh friends, muh powerlevels)<br>One piece has actually got plot and interesting characters with reasons behind their actions</br></br></br></br>  <br>I started reading before Water Seven, stopped due to circumstances, and then came back after Enies Lobby. I honestly don't understand how people thought Paulie would join, I never got that vibe from him at all.</br>  <br>This cover always reminded me of a cover from death note where this leather wearing chick had her fiance killed by Yagami<br>Anyway, yes, I do miss that Robin<br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Paulie was cool and all, but Franky was so obvious and much more prominent. I wonder if Oda made this coverpage as a joke about all the Pauliefags.</br>  <br>Didn't this fat fuck Zombe get fucked by a monkey?</br>  <br>poor guy</br>  <br>Sure did.</br>  <br>Numerous times, he literally passed out from all the hot monkey king sex</br>  <br><br><br>I feel sick.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I'm sure he enjoyed every second of it<br><br>Oh fuck off already</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Need the good doctor to make you feel better?</br>  So Law's sacrificial immortality power confirms his death before the end of the series right? Or will he 'die' and come back?  <br>Likely die and come back. People always dying and coming back. Still half expecting Ace to come back.</br>  <br> 550 million <br><br>that's waaaay too high. Like holy shit, compare the shit he did at Impel Down and the Tenryuubito Punch and think about the fact that it's supposedly very hard to raise your bounty once you get over 300m, there's no way his bounty is going to be raised like that right after Dressrosa  assuming that's what you were saying </br></br></br>  <br>If they're going to even raise it, it's going to be 450.</br>  <br>Probably do one more arc wrapping up the other crew members then raise it.</br>  <br>i think you can argue that Luffy's bounty was low if you consider the shit he has done. Pre-timeskip luffy was dangerous due to his recklessness but still wasn't seen as that much of threat because he was kinda weak (compared to strongest wg forces). Now though, he's also really strong, so i think a really high bounty would be acceptable.</br>   Monet will never poop on your car   <br>I do think a very high bounty would fit him, I'm arguing whether or not raising it suddenly like that would make sense, and in my opinion it will take AT LEAST one other arc to get close to 550 mln</br>  <br><br>Also the WG covered up the Alabasta/Enies Lobby incidents pretty well.</br></br>  <br>And this time they can't cover it up really cause of ole crazy eyes.</br>  <br>She will be someone to Sanji like Kaya is to Usopp. She will stay.</br>  <br>Why? He's more of a threat as of now to the WG than Ace ever was. <br> Come back two years later and is a fuckton stronger (acknowledged by Sentoumaru) <br> Now has another two kingdoms allied to him <br> Entered a highly restricted WG island and kidnapped a wanted man who is only second to Vegapunk <br> Allied with a Shichibukai and now he's gone rogue also <br> Has the whole of Dressrosa (and likely people of neighbouring countries) admiring and praising him as a saviour <br> Has got an underling who could somewhat stand against an admiral <br> Has shown his true strength in front of an admiral <br> Fought and defeated one of the stronger Shichibukais, and has thus thrown out the world's balance yet again <br>Etc, he's worthy of 550 million, especially when you stack everything he's also done before the timeskip on top of that.<br><br>He's got to trump Kid's again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh right, how could I forget. Luffy's threat posed and defeating of Doflamingo is known to the world and unable to be covered up. Moriah, Crocodile and Enies Lobby were all covered up to an extent which would have played a role.</br></br>  <br> Find at least 10 <br> Oda confirmed there'll be more Nakama showing up successively. </br></br>  <br><br>I completely forgot about Moriah, wasn't Doffy supposed to kill him and he escaped?<br><br>Has there been anything else mentioned about him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo thought that Moriah had escaped from his execution using his shadow powers, but it was in fact Absalom who turned him invisible and rescued him. Since then, there have been reports of Moriah being sighted in the New World, and we know for a fact that Absalom is still sailing around on the Mini-Thriller Bark.<br><br>Since Absalom and Hogback remained loyal to Moriah and took him from Thriller Bark in the same ship, it could be assumed that Moriah is still travelling on it. He'll likely have a comeback in the Kaido arc and ally with Luffy to take him down.<br><br>Pic related. It's the Mini Thriller Bark and if you look extremely closely at it, the two large figures standing on the deck somewhat resemble Moriah and his shadow clone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll likely have a comeback in the Kaido arc and ally with Luffy <br>If Moria comes back and allies with Luffy with him, Crocodile, Law, Hancock, Buggy and Jinbe, that'll make 6 at some point Shichibukai that are Luffy allies to various degrees. 7 if you count Mihawk and his being a mentor to Zoro.</br></br>  <br>what about Kuma?</br>  tfw they animate this scene   Final chapter of One Piece. <br> Chapter 2000: To the Next Generation  <br> Group of people whispering near the port of some island. <br> "You know what today is, right? It's the 10th anniversary of the day they killed... that man...!" <br> "Goodness! That fearsome pirate!? It's really been 10 years!?" <br> "Yes! They executed him atop the gallows in Loguetown! And we thought we would be rid of that terror forever but... he had to say that thing and... start a whole new age of pirates!" <br> "And I heard that his crew members are still lurking about somewhere!" <br> Man in a cloak comes out of the shadows. <br> "Don't spread rumors like that. You're gonna scare the kids." says the cloaked man, covering his face with a turned-down straw hat. <br> "Oh! You're back from your journey! Did you find anything interesting?" <br> "Yeah. I found an old momento from a dear, departed friend." the cloaked man says, as he holds up a devil fruit. <br> "Woah! That fruit looks super yummy! Gimme a bite!" says a snot-nosed kid running by, who snatches the fruit from the cloaked man and digs in, only to spit it out right after. <br> "Ew! That fruit tastes like garbage! Where did you get that junk!?" shouts the kid. <br> At first, the cloaked man has a slightly shocked face, only to turn it into a knowing grin. <br> "Hey kid. What do you wanna be when you grow up?" <br> "Me? I'm gonna be the pirate king! Just like Straw Hat Lucy was!" <br> All the townsfolk nearby look on in shock at him uttering the name of that man. <br> The cloaked man bends down in front of the kid and reaches into his pocket. <br> Pulls out a pair of goggles. <br> "Do me a favor. When you become the pirate king, return these to me, and not a second sooner, got it?" <br> The kid smiles and his cheeks somehow expand to twice their normal size, as if he were made of rubber. "Got it, Captain Usopp!" <br> "Well, I've gotta go on another journey. I have a lot of islands I need to protect, you know." the man named Usopp says, as he walks up onto his ship. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Are you ready, sir?" asks one of his crewmates. <br> "Yeah. I just had to ensure that my friend's dream reached the next generation." <br> The ship begins to pull out of the docks. <br> "You know, captain. We got another declaration of war." <br>"Ha!" says Usopp "Let them declare all they want. I promised my friend that I'd keep this area of the sea safe, and that's what I'll do. Nobody messes with the Emperor of the Sea, Captain Usopp!"<br> The ship moves further out to sea, and everyone in town waves goodbye to their trusted protector, including one little boy with a pair of goggles once worn by a close friend of the pirate king himself, as he struggles to figure out why his arm is so wiggly all of the sudden. <br> END OF ONE PIECE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>too clichè but I like it because of Usopp.<br><br>For a second there I thought you were about to throw out a 'it was buggy who was executed' plot twist</br></br></br>  <br> He's got to trump Kid's again <br>He never trumped it to begin with though. I can see him getting 455 or something, between Law and Kidd.</br></br>  <br>Aw I forgot about him. Although he's kind of no longer himself or in a state to be an ally. All the others could potentially show up to help.</br>  <br>Chapter 439 is named The 3rd and 7th Person, referring to Usopp and Robin.</br>  <br>Kid was 315 at sabaody, after marine ford luffy was 400.</br>  <br> implying kuma didn't use his repel shenanigans to move his consciousness into another body before getting vegapunk'd <br><br>step it up</br></br></br>  <br> Straw Hat Lucy <br>Why. Just why. It was all nice and heartwarming and all and then this. Just fucking why.</br></br>  <br> Implying that name won't stick just like Gold Roger did. </br>  <br>Well damn. Now I want an arc where the straw hats take on someone with 8 current and former Shichibukai backing them up.</br>  <br>Please Lord, why. Why can't be just known as Straw hat Luffy ?</br>  <br>This might actually happen.<br><br>I mean Oda did set up Kuma and made his backstory pretty ominous, he wouldn't just get rid of a major story element character like that.</br></br></br>  <br> asks one of his crewmates <br> It's actually Zoro <br> ''You ready Usopp ?'' </br></br></br>  <br> Screenshot from the Toriko anime </br>  <br>720p bruh</br>  <br>Its still the Toriko anime, which is shit compared to the manga</br>  <br>Same could be said about One Piece.</br>  <br>Yeah, but OP's anime hasnt always been shit</br>  Reminder of best song sung by one Sieyuu<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E-8<wbr>mFnN2pWk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> implying Zoro won't be doing an Afro Samurai Number 1 on a mountain training his successors. </br>  I really love Akainu's justice. It's tall, hard and linear as fuck.  <br>You do know its pretty much exactly the same as Lucci's "Dark Justice"? and Aokiji and Fujitora's types of Justice are way better</br>  <br>He's talking about the bonsai smartass.</br>  <br>I know, just felt like being a smartass</br>  I think Akainu get's more hate than he deserves tbh.  <br>What hate ?</br>  <br>Why is he likely? He spent the entire arc jobbing. He wasn't even relevant in any way, as opposed to every single Straw Hat in their respective arc.</br>  <br> Traitors justice are the best </br>  <br> akainu has a tiny sword tat on his right arm  <br><br>What does it mean</br></br></br>  <br>that you need to stop being such a faggot</br>  <br>How can a no name loser be calling me a faggot</br>  <br>He's gay for Mihawk.</br>  <br>It means he likes to rape good boys every night. In order to be a good cipherpol agent, you have to sleep with admirals. Lucci was like a cheetah in Akainu's love shack (both literally and figuratively).</br>  <br>He was obviously sending a secret message to Mihawk<br> ''lel Shanks lost an arm, you fancy fuck'' </br></br>  <br>Because, not only are you a dirty namefag but also you seem to support the shit posting</br>  <br>You're the one shit posting tho</br>  <br>Says the one namefagging with "Lucci a gud boy"</br>  <br>Sanji is in love with adventure, not women</br>  <br>That's debatable.</br>  <br>He's in love with women related adventures</br>  <br>since Oda is stalling this whole thing out like shit it's save to say we'll see a chapter all about Bellamy, maybe even already the next one. He's sleeping in that comfy house with all the other guys and I always saw him as the only logical option of a new crew member this arc and also his powers would kind of fit in really well in my opinion, in the powerscale he'd be somewhere between Robin and Franky. But yeah as many have stated he might join Law instead. <br><br><br> Viola still a strong contender <br>she really isn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He also looks nothing like the other Strawhats, which is a plus. Viola kinda resembles Robin.</br>  THERE WILL BE NO FUCKING NEW CREWMEMBER AFTER THIS ARC YOU FUCKING RETARDS   Bellamy joins <br> They fight Kaido <br> Luffy use Gear 4th: Bound Man <br> Bellamy awakens the Bane Bane No Mi <br> Turns room into springs <br>  Increases Gear 4th's constant bouncing <br> Luffy travels at 5 times the speed he was in Gear 4th <br> Gomu Gomu No Bane Leo Bazooka <br> Kaidou gets knocked into the springs and bounces about the room <br> Luffy has eaten meat right before the fight <br> Intense amounts of stamina means 2nd Leo Bazooka <br> Kaidou bounces in to Luffy's boosted Leo Bazooka and it does even more damage because Kaidou is bouncing towards it <br> Kaidou BTFO <br> Bellamy replaces Sanji as blonde member of the monster trio </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think g4 will do that much against kaido, he needs g5 at the very least and it will still be like when he fought lucci</br>  <br>The room probably has to be made out of Seastone or Wapometal to withstand that shit. Unless Law shows up and figures out how to make Solid Rooms.</br>  <br>It could be made of Wapometal, given it has no negative effects on DF and it looks like Kaidou has one</br>  <br>How is Viola a contender? She disappeared from the story for a huge amount of time and only served to give exposition to the audience and tell other characters about Dressrosa<br>What motivation does she have to join?</br></br>  One Piece official arc ranking straight from Oda:<br><br>Water 7/Enies Lobby &gt; Impel Down/Marineford &gt; Alabasta &gt; Punk Hazard/Dressrosa &gt; East Blue &gt; Skypiea &gt; Thriller Park &gt; Fishman Island</br></br>  <br> but muh Robin lookalike </br>  <br>Wouldn't that be another reason against her joining ? None of the Strawhats look alike at all.</br>  <br>'Twas ironic</br>  <br>My bad.</br>  <br>np</br>  <br>What about Gatz ?</br>  <br> only wanted 10 people <br>Inaccurate, he went out and said "let's see if I can atleast get 10 people to join my crew."<br>We might get well over 10.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I've seen as well. The words ''at least''.</br>  would you accept one piece going on hiatus for a year so Oda can rest?  <br>Absolutely. I'd be restless for about 2 weeks but the time will pass quickly.</br>  <br><br>Rebecca wasn't born into royalty, once again. She cannot be the princess. Just like with Vegeta being the Saiyan Prince, he cannot be the king, just like Trunks can't be the successor when his father dies. I know she IS technically viable for that role, but I don't see her suddenly becoming a princess out of the blue.</br></br>  <br>A year is a little too long, something like six months for rest and then getting SJ to allow him to release chapters every two weeks, something similar to the schedule of One Punch Man.<br><br>This would allow him to improve his art and keep the art at a high quality and maybe even have longer chapters, keeping everyone happy.<br><br> This would probably screw over the anime even more, but nobody watches the anime anymore. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Definetely, Oda works non-stop so we can enjoy One Piece, also it would benefit TOEI because they'd have to take a break and hopefully when OP returns, it starts looking good</br>  <br>Nah, the anime should take a break too. They didn't have to wait 4 bloody weeks for the timeskip. It's unfair.</br>  Can someone explain why bellamy joining is bad? I'm just curious why so many people think so. And please don't say it's because his power isn't strong enough to be in the crew. I understand that the crewmen have to be strong but I want to know if his personality can fit well with the crew.  <br>The anime should just make a filler arc or two, cover stories are a great material for that.</br>  <br>Yea, but, the last filler was absolute shit too but at least it's for a good cause. <br><br><br>It's nothing like that. People just think Bellamy is a bitch because of how he cried and kissed Doffy's ass. I personally don't mind at all since it was just as pathetic as Usopp coming back to the crew. And I fucking love Usopp. I don't think Bellamy is weak either. I think he's as strong, maybe a little weaker than Franky. I think having Bellamy would be cool as fuck because he can be blown away by all the crazy shit the Strawhats get to see. Mainly, I just want him to get to Emerald City with the others. Could be a Skypiea 2.0.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would be better if both Monet and Bellamy joined. Why not two at once?</br>  <br>Absolutely.<br>He's killing himself with that work schedule of his. Guy needs to rest and clear his mind.</br></br>  One Strawhat can unlock either Observation or Armament Haki, which Straw Hat is it and which Haki do they learn?  <br>Now that he has grown as a person, Bellamy could potentially have great dynamic with SHs, but there are a few reasons why he isn't SH material. The most prominent one is, he wasn't important in this arc. Compare him to anyone else: Zoro's intro arc was centered around him, Arlong Park was mostly about Nami, same goes for Sanji and Usopp in their intro arcs. Chopper was relevant in Drum Island as a doctor and Hiluluk's apprentice, Robin was Croc's right hand woman and the one who introduced to the readers the True History, Franky was targeted by CP9 and built Sunny, Brook was the reason SHs went to Thriller Bark. Jinbe played a key role in Fishman Island. What can we say about Bellamy in Dressrosa? He defeated some fodders and then jobbed. Remove him from the arc, and it actually improves. That's why he is a bad option: irrelevant characters shouldn't suddenly be given a huge role of Luffy's nakama.<br>The best candidate is Kyros (the one who led a rebellion against Doffy), but he wants to be with his daughter, so it's not happening.</br></br>  <br>Well luffy might not fight kaido alone he will probably have help like doffy. Also if moriah helps the strawhats take on kaido then we might see nightmare luffy or maybe a stronger version.</br>  <br>I get the feeling that for a lot of people it's<br> Bawww it's not Law! <br>or<br> Bawww it's not a girl! <br><br>Or, more legitimately, they plain don't like the character.<br><br>Me, I like the idea of his joining. After 'mingo, Luffy is probably the man he respects the most right now, and I can see that leading to him joining the crew since he has nowhere to belong to anymore. I think his powers also fit well with the rest. Not OP bullshit, but still pretty strong.<br><br>What I wonder is what would be his occupation within the crew. Lookout?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> showed Luffy how to exit the arena so Sabo could switch places with him and win mera mera vs Burgess <br>I think Luffy would have beat Burgess but he'd be exhausted and unable to fight Doffy afterward.<br>Remove him from the arc and Luffy loses to Doffy.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the fight against him helped strengthen Luffy's resolve too. He was super fucking pissed at Doffy after that fight and that shit made me so hyped.</br>  <br>But why would Monet even join???????<br>Her lil sister hates the strawhats (mainly ussop), zoro made her look like a bitch and she's hella loyal to doffy. Bellamy might not like doffy anymore because doffy was a dick to him but doffy was never a dick to Monet. Plus she has to be able to find the stawhats. And she's not even alive.</br></br>  <br>The only reason I want her to join is to get more doujins. Is that so much to ask for ?!</br>  <br>Luffy could've climbed the Colosseum's seating and jumped down.</br>  <br>Nami was first introduced in buggys arc and her importance wasn't that high. Until arlong park did she have an important role that was higher than the other strawhats at the time. Same with robin. She just joined out of nowhere in alabasta and until enies lobby did she have have an important part in an arc. So if bellamy joins he might receive his important arc later</br>  I still haven't heard a compelling argument against Barto, if Dressrosa gets a nakama at all.  <br>E M E R A L D C I T Y<br>M<br>E<br>R<br>A<br>L<br>D<br><br>C<br>I<br>T<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I want more doujins of Nathan the navigator and Robert the archaeologist but not a single one is out</br>  <br><br> Fighting for dat ass</br></br>  <br>Nami was still pretty important as the only navigator that was available. Robin saved Luffy from dying and foreshadowed things left and right. What does Bellamy have?</br>  <br>His gag is already annoying, the only reason people want him to join is because he is a fan favorite.</br>  Why doesn't oda just hire a studio of 10 assistants who do all the drawing for him and allow him to only do the writing and rough sketches?<br>He must be a millionaire by now anyways.<br>That way he could crank up the material and still spend more time with his family.</br></br>  <br>Why do people keep posting emerald city in One Piece threads? havent been on for a few days</br>  <br>Because Bellamy is a fucking asshole, the SH crew don't give a fuck about him and he's probably still loyal to Doflamingo because every time Doffy steps on his balls he seems to get more loyal.<br>He also didn't have a real character arc like all the other SH members have had before properly "joining". Even Robin was quite prominent during Alabasta despite having her character arc alot later. <br><br>As far as new characters go, the only character who would fit is Law and Law has his own crew. Probably gonna be no new crewmates till Wano.<br><br>However, Moocy would be the best SH.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am sure he does not want that, it would feel less like his own work if most of the stuff is done by other people, I for one would hate that as an artist.</br>  <br>Because the Wizard of Oz cover and Bellamy previously mentioned it as a "stupid legend" like Skypeia.</br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>He has a crew and stated that in chapter 773 he's not strong enough to be useful to luffy</br>  <br>Already has a crew. Might be joined by Bellamy as a grumpy foil to his excitement and SH lust.</br>  <br>How is bellamy an asshole he changed during this arc. Also do you not remember what robin did to cobra and tashigi?</br>  <br>Even worse, he would've turned into a toy. People tend to forget that was the whole point of the colosseum from Doffy's perspective.</br>  <br>Zoro was known to be an asshole too. Usopp was a dick to most of the Village. Nami is an absolute cunt. Sanji was a total dick. Chopper was 'good'. Robin was mainly a cunt. Franky was a total dick. And Brook was nice too. So the majority of the fucking Strawhats are assholes. <br><br>You clearly hated Bellamy before Dressrosa and that's why you're so against him, even though he, in my opinion, is being redeemed. Robin and Nami had just about as screen time as Bellamy in Dressrosa.</br></br></br>  Did anyone actually think that robin was going to join when she was first introduced? While reading alabasta it seemed so obvious vivi was gonna join but then she doesn't and out of the blue nico robins on the ship. The only time it seemed like she would join was when she attacked crocodile and when she gave the antidote to luffy and when luffy saved her. But the arc was practically over when that happened though.  Since Arabasta and Dressrosa are so similar, Bellamy fits the 'Robin' role the most. He pissed othe MC upon introduction. He used to work for the Villain and was fairly loyal. He clearly wasn't that against the MC. He did what he did because of what he believed in. He was spared by the MC. <br><br>He even has a ready made Animal theme.</br></br>  <br>I can already see Zoro being kinda cautious of him and Usopp losing his shit when Bellamy says his profession is ''Executioner''.</br>  I'm gonna laugh so fucking hard when no one joins.  I hope you guys know that ussops name won't change to God ussop and his picture won't change either. All the marines on dressrosa can't go back and tell their reports because of fujitora. His bounty will probably just raise normally. Also the WG might raise the bounties of the sanjihats since they probably think their on the island  <br>and this is exactly what will happen</br>  <br>The word of God Usopp would be passed around either way, if not by marines by pirates and others.<br><br><br>Is Leo not on the sights for anyone, I mean are we really going to pass this opportunity to have a Dwarf in the crew? I am sure he will forget that -land stuff eventually.</br></br></br></br>  Kyros could join as a contribution from Riku to the SH's cause. A thank you gift.  <br>Why ? Do you think everyone having their fav character not joining is funny? Oh wait you probably do since your 12</br>  <br>Expect that Bellamy was no where as important to Doffy as Robin was to Croc. <br><br>Bellamy was lower than trash in Doflamingo eyes. He wasn't even part of the family. Doflamingo kept him around pretty much just because he enjoys bullying him.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you Hawk!?<br>You remind me of Hawk!</br></br>  <br>And Crocodile never trusted Robin from the first place. She was his right hand, sure, but Crocodile didn't give two shits about her.</br>  <br>Not fast enough. And if the WG do listen to pirate rumors are they going to be able to connect ussop to sogeking if they don't know ussops face?</br>  <br>I know Riku is all for peace and shit but giving away the Country's strongest warrior is just retarded.</br>  <br>They already know Usopp is Sogeking though. Shit, the Pacafista's knew even before the Timeskip. He'll get a bigger bounty, new picture but the poster name would still be Sogeking, maybe. And Luffy and Chopper would buy it because they'll think people just mistook Usopp's nose.</br>  <br>same could be said about Bellamy. Doffy didnt give two shits about him and probably wouldnt've cared if he failed, succeeded, betrayed him, or sucked his dick.</br>  <br>That's my point ? I was looking at the similarities, if you couldn't figure it out.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind having a Dwarf in the crew but Leo is shit. Wicca would be a better choice.</br>  <br>Her becoming Zoro's GPS would melt my heart. She and Chopper can argue about being the Mascot.</br>  <br>Expect that Robin was clearly very important to Croc. Without her he would never get his hands on Pluton.<br><br>Bellamy on other hand was not important to Doffy at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Robin got to be the first day of the week and Croco only seems to give a shit about Daz.<br><br>Bellamy sort of got kicked in Diamante's direction after he fucked up. Doffy wants EVERYONE else. Even randos on Wanted posters, just not Bellamy</br></br></br>  <br>Kyro's isnt even Riku's to give away anymore. After staging Scarlet's death, he was pretty much free to do whatever the hell</br>  <br>Crocodile was finished in the sky<br>Doffy was finished in the ground<br>There was a weight woman in baroque works<br>There was a weight man in the donquixote family<br>Crocodile was trying to take over a country <br>Doffy had his already taken over<br>Croc was a logia which is a top notch devil fruit<br>Doffy had a paramecia which was the lowest category of devil fruits<br>Ace helped in alabasta<br>Sabo helped in dressrosa<br>Ace fought smoker<br>Sabo fought fujitora<br>Alabasta was covered up<br>Dressrosa wasn't<br>Nico robin the right hand of the organizations leader joins the crew<br>Bellamy who was trash in doffys eyes will join the crew.<br><br>This arc was a parallel to alabasta so since bellamy was the lowest member and robin was the highest (excluding crocodile) gallant will join.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is Post Admiral level, fast approaching Yonko. Damn you stupid nigga, this manga's going into the home stretch, there isn't much time left for him to get any stronger.</br>  <br><br>Hey, hey, I never said they were the same. I said they were similar. There's a clear difference. Just like Arabasta and Dressrosa. They're not the same, just similar.</br></br>  <br> Luffy is Post Admiral level <br><br>not this shit again. Jesus fucking Christ.<br><br>Oda stated that Sakazuki is so strong that if he were to become the protagonist of OP he would end it all in one year. Do you seriously think Luffy is even comparable to him right now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes an odd amount of sense</br>  <br>Why can't there be another Timeskip when Teach solo's the entire crew ?</br>  <br>It won't be going into the home stretch anytime soon though, there's so many plot points that need to be resolved. They haven't even gotten to fucking Elbaf yet let alone final arc.</br>  I want powerlevelfags to leave  So...he left?  <br>Not yet.</br>  <br>they never will. They feel the urge to shit up every single one piece thread for some strange reason</br>  Were off the see The wizard!  <br>No the WG don't. They never met ussop or even have his picture. Also the only way they could get a picture of ussop is if they have a marine on dressrosa do it. But all the marines on deessrosa can't come back unless Fuji captures strawhat. So they will probably still use the sogeking pic since a mask doesn't change.</br>  <br>as long as One Piece is ongoing, we're doomed to deal with these faggots</br>  <br>CONFIRMED</br>  Bellamy is used goods.  Why don't any of the admirals/vice admirals/marines wear their fucking coats? It's always around their shoulders, Nigga if you're not ever gonna wear it don't bring it and drape it over your shoulders like you're some kind of badass.  <br>the discussions about Doflamingo being Admiral Level and Luffy being above him with both at 100% were seriously one of the most retarded things to ever be born into OP threads. Fucking hell.</br>  <br>The coats are stitched to their shoulders so they can look like cool yakuza guys without the coat falling off.</br>  <br>Oh gee, I guess this is another fucking Sogeking then, huh ? I'm not talking about Dressrosa at all. I'm talking about Usopp in general.<br><br><br>So were Nami and Robin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why don't any of the admirals/vice admirals/marines wear their fucking coats? <br> like you're some kind of badass. <br><br>Nigga you ain't cool.<br>Let the marines do fly shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope in an SBS, Oda said they're held on by justice</br>  <br>I fucking hate it when Usoppfag speedreaders don't realist the marines know Usopp IS Sogeking and have for ages.<br>Someone always has to post this picture to shut em down.</br></br>  so, what was your favorite Admiral actual reveal?<br><br>Mine has to be Kizaru's. It was just so stylish. Aokiji's a close second.</br></br>  <br>Look at luffy from east blue and look how much luffy leveled up when he made it to shabondy. Then there was a timeeskip. Now imagine how strong luffy will get once he reaches marine HQ. a time skip isn't needed.</br>  <br>I'm okay with that.</br>  <br>it is if he wants to solo Teach. There's no way he's at Blackbeard's level right now. <br><br> I really really don't want Luffy to solo Blackbeard regardless. It would be a bit clichè if you ask me </br></br></br>  <br> Sabo is dead  <br> Doffy will help the strawhats <br> Bellamy will have her own arck </br></br></br>  <br>By that logic the marines would be thinking that sanji grew hair all over his face and now they have to use that as his new bounty picture.</br>  Bellamy is distinctive enough to be a main-ish character but he's not really SH material. He doesn't have a dream, still probably loyal to Doffy, hasn't bonded with any of the SH, Luffy hasn't asked him or been really wow-ed by him etc. If he's going to join it will be much further along the line and depend if he shows up in the next arc.<br><br>Since most characters join after an adventure with the whole crew, it's probably not gonna be Bellamy. I have a suspicion he'll probably take what was left of the donquixote family's underlings and restart his own crew from scratch ~inspired~ by Luffy and go off looking for a dream like the Emerald City or some shit.</br></br>  How come Luffy didn't know about devil fruit awakening? You would think Rayleigh would teach him about it given how long they spent training on that island.  <br>Kuma knew it as well. And chances are every fucking Pacafista does too. And Sentomaru can probably tell the Marines Sogeking's real name, if he caught it. <br><br>I predict his next bounty to be 100m. I think he might follow Luffy's growth. <br><br><br>Aokiji's was cool, no pun intended, but because he wasn't really bad, it didn't leave that much of an impression on me. Kizaru's was badass. And quite honestly, Fujitora's was fucking amazing. Fucking meteors out of nowhere. And even Doffy acknowledging his strength before the meteor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Rayleigh is not a fruit user though</br>  <br>Bro, those colours clash especially that hat, it makes Akainu look goofy as shit. That Nigga is eggcellent.</br>  <br>No ? The fucking Marines didn't think the Black picture that they first got was Sanji. They drew a goddamn picture. They're not fucking retarded, dude. They saw Usopp. They saw the resemblance that anyone except Luffy, Chopper and Oz can spot. They just may not have heard his name. Or they didn't want to change it. Simple as that.</br>  <br>He's going to be tossing meteors at them as they leave, Garp style.</br>  <br>I honestly can't see BB being that tough. Every time he gets in a fight he nearly loses and sometimes does lose. I understand he will be very hard for luffy cuz he's a yonko. If luffy was to meet kaido and fight him 1v1 he wouldn't be able to get a good clean hit in without using some tactic. But with blackbeard it feels like luffy could rush blackbeard do a jet stamp and knock blackbeard back.</br>  <br>Roger's crew didn't know shit about Devil Fruits.</br>  <br>surely chopper is worth more than 50?</br>  <br> Nico robin the right hand of the organizations leader joins the crew <br> Bellamy who was trash in doffys eyes will join the crew. <br>How about this instead:<br> Nico robin the right hand of the organizations leader joins the crew <br> Law, a former member of Doffy's crew and candidate for Corazon title, joins the crew </br></br></br></br></br>  man, I hope bellamy doesn't join. His devil fruit adds nothing to the team and he has no fucking dreams. Bellamy would be so much better, but in all honesty I want them to get a new female member already (not rebecca or viola). preferably one with a logia  <br>Kinda like Robin. Literally no one bonded with her before she joined the crew. Unless you count Luffy saving her as bonding. He just did whatever the hell he wanted. I will give you that Bellamy doesn't have a dream though. Although, maybe his dream is to just overcome the 'Great Wave', whatever that means.</br>  <br> Post Admiral level <br> fast approaching Yonko <br> implying Admiral=/=Yonko </br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Bonnie.</br>  <br>Rogers crew have 0 experience when it comes to DF. The only person to consume a DF was Buggy and it was an accident.</br>  <br>Prove it.</br>  <br>What about ussops village? They couldn't tell it was ussop under that mask. The WG is probably the same way.</br>  <br> Bellamy is shit <br> Bellamy would be better </br></br>  <br>Yea, why didn't Rayleigh, a guy who hasn't eaten a DF, teach Luffy about a fucking specific DF that probably is different to other fucking Paramecias, about awakening. I can only imagine.<br><br><br>Not the mascot Chopper. All he does is panic and scream and eat cotton candy. He might have gotten a new bounty if he went Monster Point in Saboady after the timeskip.<br><br><br>Wait, what ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The scene where Buggy accidentally eats a Devil Fruit and none of the crew know shit about them doesn't count as proof? They didn't even know whether Devil Fruits were real.</br>  <br>there's also the fact he's an unlikable dumb ass weak piece of shit <br><br>he'd get bullied by the strawhats</br></br></br>  <br>You fucking dense cunt. I literally posted an image of USOPP's picture being labeled as SOGEKING. Not Sogeking's picture being labeled as fucking Sogeking. Usopp's. Understand ? They fucking know Usopp is Sogeking, they probably just don't know his real name is Usopp.</br>  <br><br>fuck, I meant barto would be better</br></br>  <br>I think Caesar joining would be nice</br>  <br>that better be a fucking joke</br>  <br> Bellamy would be so much better, but in all honesty I want them to get a new female member already (not rebecca or viola). preferably one with a logia <br><br>How subtle.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128216019 <br>Remember that everyone kinda showed off after getting back to almost Sabaody ? Chopper still looked like a cute, harmless animal. The others looked very different, physically.<br><br><br>k.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wonder what they will do with him now that Doffy is gone.</br>  <br>Honestly, I can kinda see it happening except for Luffy just absolutely hating him and Usopp confirming it. I think Caesar would be kinda cool in the crew.</br>  <br>Give him to Big Mom. As long as they don't give him to Kaido, it should be fine. But he asked Sanji for help so I don't think that's gonna happen.</br>  I don't want Bellamy to join simply because I don't like him. He was a dick the first time around, and now he is a bitch. I can't really make out any character traits that I'd want on board of the Sunny.<br><br>That he has no dream, his power is lame/overlaps with Luffy's, and that he wasn't really that important this arc, all of that is just a bonus.<br>Though I could still see it happening.<br><br>The most likely variant will be that no one joins and Luffy gets a new crew member at the end of the Kaido arc.<br><br><br> Remember that everyone kinda showed off after getting back to almost Sabaody ? Chopper still looked like a cute, harmless animal. The others looked very different, physically. <br>His reindeer form looked noticably bigger and bulkier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Oda say the next 2 nakama would show up in succession or whatever? Jinbei + Caesar might work.</br>  <br> He also says that more members will join the Straw Hats! "And there will be new nakama, they will show up successively." <br><br>http://opforum.net/showthread.php?t<wbr>id=6501</wbr></br></br></br>   all of these awful new crew member suggestions  <br><br>Come on guys. there's clearly no new crewmemebers this arc because of Law.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry if I offended you. Would you care to explain why Caesar is a bad choice? And I know he did some mean things but let's not forget what franky and his goons did to poor ussop. Or the horrors of nico robin. Or when zoro first joined he prioritized his ambition over his captain and friends.</br>  <br>When you think about Doffy had pretty shit tier fruit. It appears strong only because he mastered it to the fullness.</br>  <br> Yea, they have a bloody reindeer on their crew. Let's give it 150 beli, I guess. </br>   Kinnemon stuck with the crew for two arcs now, and will do so up until the end of Wano. <br> Nobody realizes that he will stick with them after his son becomes an apprentice. </br>  <br>Better to just hand him to the marines. Not safe to keep a 300 million bounty guy who can gas the whole crew to death on your ship.</br>  <br>But unlike Bellamy, she also had a lot of history foreshadowing, screen time, focus and exposition during the Alabasta arc such as her encounter with Tashigi and interest in the poneglyphs, clearly marking her as important. Bellamy hasn't been highlighted as important or noteable aside from being willing to die for Doffy and possibly hurting the sky people.</br>  <br>I always took Kinemon and Jinbe for granted.</br>  <br>No it's you who doesn't understand. They know someone's behind that mask but they don't know who. They probably believe his real name is sogeking. If he was arrested he would be tried under the name of sogeking.<br>How about you keep your headcanon to yourself and I'll stick with my facts.</br></br>  <br>I believe Oda was found on this matter in an SBS, someone pointing out that Kin'emon's fruit may have a similar wording to Luffy and Robin's, part of the names being numbers.<br><br>I DO wan't Kin'emon and Jinbe to join. One the wacky, immature uncle and the other, levelheaded and scolding the crew when they do dumb shit.<br><br>Two uncles isn't a bad thing, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The page I posted highlighted him as being a growing character with space for more growth. We didn't know Franky's dream until the very end of his arc. Same could be said about Robin too. I can see Bellamy's dream being to see all the Islands and stuff that he previously thought were stupid and non-existent.</br>  <br>I couldn't really follow the conversation, but felt like throwing that in.</br>  <br> manufactures drugs and weaponised fake devil fruits <br> poisoned and crippled people then manipulated them <br> experimented on children <br> got children addicted to drugs <br> that fucking grating laugh </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Look at that fucking image. I don't even think you're disagreeing with me. They know the person behind the fucking mask and they even have it on the fucking newspaper. Yes, they don't know the person's Name. But they know it's Usopp the person. Does that make sense ? They know his face. Not his name. Understand ? I never claimed that they knew Usopp's real name.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't underestimate redemption kid. The world runs on it</br>  <br>No, I see where you're coming from. I just don't think the Marines do. Especially since the only time Chopper looks threatening is when he's fighting.</br>  <br>that could work, because it's pretty much guaranteed the Straw Hats are gonna go to those places too</br>  <br>Redemption ? Is that Bellamy's laugh I can hear ?</br>  <br> Bonnie is Dorothy <br> Dorothy had a dog named Toto <br> Akainu = Red Dog <br>What does it mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's weird they gave a Bepo a 500 beri bounty. Even if he was a regular bear bears are still pretty dangerous</br>  <br>D E E P E S T L O R E<br>E<br>E<br>P<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>L<br>O<br>R<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bellamy got a few pages at most. Robin got a lot of importance, even as Miss All-Sunday, highlighting the poneglyphs, world history and giving her an obvious history with the marines. <br><br>Bellamy just isn't as important to the world or plot as Robin was, and has explicitly said that dreams are for suckers, has never revoked that so we can assume he still believes it. He just seems more like the kind of minor but distinctive character who will get a cover arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. And I would love to see his reaction too. I think he'd be a very level-headed character who still loves parties and stuff. He'd just be gaping, lost for words, whenever the Crew reaches a mythical/cool Island. Then Robin would do her ''fufu'' and invite him to join the others. I can see all this working out perfectly.</br>  <br>Not when every marine could either kill a Sea King or are armed with Guns, Swords and other weapons, in many cases, both</br>  <br>see<br><br>I'm not saying Bellamy is going to be as important as Robin, anon. I'm just saying they have some similarities. <br><br><br>Akainu had his age increased by Bonney from when he was a kid.<br><br><br>Maybe because of his depression issues and how he's all timid and stuff ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the numbers theme is that names of every fruit on the straw hats contains two unique numbers between 1 and 10. the only two missing are 2 and 9. Kinemon could have the fukufuku no mi (uniform-uniform fruit), but unless it was pronounced fukyufukyu it wouldn't fit. Interestingly, 2 can be pronounced as either fu or ni, so one possible fruit that can be added to the crew is the  nikyunikyu no mi: currently possessed by Kuma </br>  <br>Bepo's only worth 500? What the fuck, he's a polar bear. Polar bears are terrifying.</br>  <br>He's the leader of the SH armada unless Fuji takes on that role.</br>  <br>I like it even more, considering he'd be less serious then Robin, Zoro and Jinbei when he joins<br>but more serious then the other Strawhats, and 2 serious characters would be a nice change, given we've had Brook who is basically just comic relief</br></br>  <br>Does the Bane Bane fit ? People could use that for an argument against Bellamy.</br>  it makes me mad that people think bellamy, bart or monet could be new crew members  Bellamy is ass, but the people wanting Dressrosa royals and people with their own crews to join are just as dumb as Bellamyfags if not worse.  <br> Fuji <br> pirate <br>Nah. I can see him breaking away from the marines though or creating a new anti-WG faction/split within the marines along with more disillusioned marines like Garp and perhaps Sengoku who still believe in justice but not WG tactics/leadership. Sengoku sure does seem to feel the weight of all the pregnant D. women he ordered murdered and got pissed as fuck when the WG wanted to cover up Marineford.</br></br></br>  <br>Every arc there's insufferable, loud retards who won't shut up about random characters joining. These fucks seriously thought characters like Paulie were going to join.</br>  <br>This.</br>  Fact: Luffy asked Kinemons legs to join his crew when he first saw them.<br>The resent crewmembers yelled at Luffy<br>Fact: Kinemon has been sailing with the straw hats<br>So why isn't he considered most likely? The only thing missing is he didn't accept yet and hates pirates, which is a theme for Luffy's crew. Zoro hunted pirates, Nami hated pirates, Usopp feared pirates, Franky hated pirates and would take their treasure. So this isn't much of a barrier since Kinemon sees what the SH do first hand.</br></br></br>  When will we see Johnny and Yosaku again?  <br>No tragic backstory and no reason to go on adventures. He's just looking for his son. That's a single arc quest.</br>  <br>Maybe when the Crew gets a new bounty.</br>   next arc takes place on zo <br> zo is oz backwards <br> recent cover art shows wizard of oz cast as puppets <br> bellamy compared the sky island to the emerald city as examples of places that don't exist <br> fishman island = arlong park, dressrosa = alabasta, sky island = ??? <br> hints that the next crew member with a devil fruit will have the nikyunikyu no mi <br><br>we're getting a cowardly lion character with the most OP paramecia next arc, aren't we?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wano, where they test their fighting styles VS Samurai for entertainment as well as to get money and are rich</br>  <br> /soc/ <br>Holy shit, stab yourself with a rusted rake.</br></br>  <br>Everything about him will be revealed in Wano, that's when he'll join.</br>  <br><br>If he was going to join it'd have to be after Wano and even then I feel like he's associated or beholden to serve Kaido in some way.<br><br>Which could open up a pretty sad/tragic fight vs him and Brook in future.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's likely the latter. The only reason I can see Kuma letting himself be totally robotocized was for the plot, that he has "died" &amp; that his fruit can be transferred to a new user. I see him as more of a glorified Pacifista now, probably without the Nikyu Nikyu. <br><br>Smoshigi are headed to his lab, so maybe someone will inherit it &amp; join SH.</br></br></br>  <br>He has a kid, he's not joining.</br>  <br>I didn't say Fuji would be a pirate. Akainu said he can't return until he capture SH and Fuji said ok no problem, but many anon believe he won't do it.<br>So if that's true he's de facto Luffy armada and easily the strongest member.</br></br>  <br>Kuma has the Nikyu Nikyu no mi. <br><br>And Sky Island would be = Emerald City. You know, the whole city of Gold and shit ?</br></br></br>  <br>what if<br> Nico Robin joins the crew <br> Nico Robin leaves the crew </br></br></br>  I still wanna know what the secret is that Doffy is holding over the WG's heads.  <br>What is Water 7?</br>  <br>He's already in arc #2, going to Zou most likely, then Wano. That's 4 arcs and every arc other than FI after the time skip so far.<br>If he didn't have a tragic backstory why are he and his son displaced and why did he flip out at hearing the name Kaido?</br></br>  <br> He has a kid, he's not joining. <br>This is one piece we're reading here, and Kinemon's a dad. Kid buffer means nothing.</br></br>  <br>We'll learn in time of course.</br>  <br>ayy</br>  <br>Yassop decided to raise Usopp instead of be a pirate</br>  <br>Paulie was good layed out bait by Oda though</br>  <br>dude, that was what I was implying. And yeah kuma has the nikyunikyu, but he could show up again and die. I doubt oda would have a problem killing off kuma since he's already brain-dead and has been since the whitebeard war. it would just be destroying a robot</br>   implying Mononosuke isn't going to stowaway and be the new strawhat at the end of the Wano arc   <br>I honestly think Kuma can be reverted. I think Vegapunk might have some kind of way around it.</br>  <br>It was already foreshadowed that Franky would save Kuma when he thanked him for guarding the thousand sunny.</br>  <br>This is the best of all choices.<br> kid on board for more variety <br> interesting ability <br> ss doujins </br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro was just unwilling to socialise and stuff because he was too focused on training and fighting as well as his standoffish personality.<br>Dont hate on Usopp, he had perfectly valid reasoning for his actions.<br>Nami is, was and always will be a cunt. Need more rape doujins of her.<br>Sanji was only a dick to dicks.<br>Chopper was lovely but scared, as per usual.<br>Robin is a hard one to read, not too sure about her pre-crew introduction.<br>Franky was a nice guy to his family but not others, I think most characters would have robbed Usopp had they known he had that ridiculous sum of money.<br>And yeah, Brook was nice, but I dont understand how he isn't fucking insane from waiting for 50 years with only the dead song of his crewmates to keep him company.<br>By-the-by I actually like the idea of Bellamy as a crew member but I think that he needs just one last push of character development beforehand.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kid is Magneto <br> Luffy is Mr.Fantastic <br>How did I not see this before</br></br></br>  <br> ss doujins with Robin <br>Would read/10</br></br>  <br>Kuma is too OP. He's at least as strong as doffy even without cybernetics<br><br><br>how was that foreshadowing. Did he say something about repaying the favor?</br></br></br></br>  can bart + bellamy beat sanji?  <br>We dont need ANOTHER swordsman.</br>  <br>Vegapunk truly seems like an amazing guy. I mean sure, he works for the marines, maybe there's some selfish reason behind that, but he really does look like an awesome person. Can't wait to see the motherfucker.</br>  <br>there is no way sanji could beat bart</br>  <br>Sanji would make them eat their shorts.</br>  <br>What he -&gt;  said.<br>I would absolutely worship GOda if Wicca joined.</br></br>  <br>He's also got bullshit magic powers.</br>  <br>Come on, we all know Brook doesnt actually sword fight unless its fodder</br>  <br>Of course everyone had their reasons. Bellamy did too. He honestly believed the Dream Era was over. He honestly adored Doffy. I'm just telling people not to ignore everyone else just because 'they' hate Bellamy, you know ? And I think we might get that last push of Character development since a lot of that happens at the very end of the arc. Bellamy is obviously not going to be just ignored. He's going to get addressed properly. Especially since everything he's looked up to has fallen in front of his eyes. <br><br>Also, yea, Brook's past is the one that just makes me lose my shit. I cannot even comprehend the amount of will power you would need to survive for that long. Being afraid of scary shit doesn't help too. But I guess Brook doesn't have a brain to go insane, right ?</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Bart crys tears of joy over meeting Sanji</br>  <br>You keep using that name for him and still did not get the joke.</br>  <br>how would sanji touch bart?</br>  Who was the first zoan fruit in the plot?<br><br>I honestly don't remember. It can't be Chopper.</br></br>  <br>I got your joke, and meant to reply to <br>I was just being a dumb motherfucker</br></br>  <br>it's a reddit tier joke<br><br>were you hoping for epin upboats?</br></br></br>  <br>Dude.<br><br>Bart.

I'm not hip with the kids when it comes to comics.<br><br><br> He's at least as strong as doffy even without cybernetics <br>You base this on what ? Kuma's tough body is huge plus point in terms of his strength. And we don't know how a person who knows CoA would fare against his paws.<br><br><br>Yea, I think Barijoma Island or wherever Franky landed used to be Vegapunks running grounds. I think the people said that he made tons of stuff to help the people living there and stuff. I think he might have joined the Marines just because of their resources and he can work on more stuff and etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dalton, I think</br>  <br>No, I was making a snarky comment to lift the mood. Sometimes silly jokes are just silly jokes. Take it easy.<br><br>Do we really need to have this in every other thread? Just take it easy every once in a while.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.

I will stay on topic for now on. Sorry.</br>  So let me get this straight<br>All of this is supposed to have happened in 1 day?<br><br> Luffy and Law arriving on Dressrosa with the whole crew <br> Papers saying Doffy isn't a Warlord anymore <br> CP-0 arriving and saying Doffy is a Warlord again <br> Luffy meeting Fujitora at the bar <br> Zoro getting his swords stolen and chasing the Tontattan all over the city <br> Sanji chasing after Viola and being betrayed  <br> the Vega Punk deal going wrong and forcing Sanji, Nami and Chopper to fuck off with the ship <br> Robin and Usopp being captured by Tontattans <br> the Law x Fujitora x Doffy showdown on Green Bit <br> Law being captured by Doffy <br> Luffy fighting through the Colosseum <br> Luffy meeting Sabo <br> Sabo winning the tournament in Luffys place <br> Franky, Robin, Usopp and the Soldier meeting up at the Tontattan hideout <br> them infiltrating the SMILE Factory <br> Franky attacking the entrance from the top <br> Sugar being scared shitless by Usopp <br> All the toys being reverted <br> Luffy and Kyros storming Doffys place and getting Law and the King out <br> Doffy moving the whole castle to the other side of the island <br> putting up the birdcage <br> making all the residents run amok again <br> having Luffy walk all the way over there <br> zorro fucking up the stone giant <br> having Rebecca fly all the way over there <br> unlocking Laws handcuffs <br> Usopp landing that killer shot <br> oh yeah the 2 samurais reunited too I forgot <br> Law + Luffy vs Doffy at the top again <br>And I probably forgot a lot of shit because it's been over a year now<br>This is supposed to be 1 day?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes? different people do different things during the same time.</br>  <br>Woah, maybe Capone has the Country Country ? Not saying next SH, but just saying.<br><br><br>We still love you Anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>then do it</br>  <br>Are you basing this on the anime ? Cause I can see why it would feel ridiculous. A lot of these things are happening at the same time.</br>  <br>Even all the shit that Luffy already did wouldn't fit in a single day<br><br>They arrived when the sun was already out<br>He went to chill at the bar<br>Then fought in the Colosseum<br>Then fought his way up to Doffy for the first time<br>Then had to walk all the way to where Doffy moved his castle<br>Then had to fight Doffy again<br>And the sky still looks like it's barely mid-day or something<br><br><br>Yeah I am</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A slut who loves yoghurt and exclusively eats a gluten free diet.</br>  <br><br>Were these two intentionally made to look almost exactly like eachother?</br></br>  <br>Please, for the love of God, don't base anything on the anime. Anything. At all. The Anime literally feels 8 times longer than the manga.</br>  <br>I don't think so.</br>  <br> They arrived when the sun was already out <br>Let's say 8.00 AM<br> He went to chill at the bar <br>8.30<br> Then fought in the Colosseum <br>9.00 - 14.00<br> Then fought his way up to Doffy for the first timE <br>14.30<br> Then had to walk all the way to where Doffy moved his castle <br>15.30<br> Then had to fight Doffy again <br>16.30<br> And the sky still looks like it's barely mid-day or something <br>17.00<br><br>The sun doesn't go down befor 19.00 at least during summer. I don't see how impossible the whole thing is. The whole time in the cage lasted less than an hour, so my numbers are already exagerated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Yeah I am <br>Well don't, cause Toei's pacing makes everything take far longer than it should.</br></br>  <br>And is vegan and sexually submissive.</br>  <br> The sun doesn't go down befor 19.00 at least during summer. <br>Right now it's almost 21:00 in germany and it looks like mid afternoon. You are very generous with 17:00.<br><br><br>It's just the general style that creates these patterns: attack in one panel -&gt; attack hitting in one big panel -&gt; reaction of the guys being hit in smaller panels, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wonder what it's like in Spain in the summer ? It's closer to the Equator so does that mean the cycle is shorter ? I didn't pay much attention to Geography.</br>  <br> The sun doesn't go down befor 19.00 at least during summer <br>Where do you live that the sun goes down that early in summer? Up here around the 45th Parallel North it sets by 20:30 at the earliest.</br></br>  <br> The sun doesn't go down befor 19.00 at least during summer.  <br>That doesn't apply to any country though. Close to the equator the sun goes down around the same time all year long.</br></br>  <br> Right now it's almost 21:00 in germany and it looks like mid afternoon. You are very generous with 17:00. <br>I just made a speculation trying to make it all happen in less time as possible. I could also have said that they enden the tournament by midday. but of course, the whole arc mayhave taken the whole day. 12 hours of sun are a lot.<br>also it's almost 21.00 in Italy too, and the sky is still bright as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>how do people think this? they're two completely different characters. Does having the same powers = same character to you? Is your reading comprehension that shitty? It's obivious they have key personality differences when you look at their actions. The only things similar are superficial stuff like their devil fruit ability and being luffy's brother.</br></br>  <br>This is the New World, mind you. Ruskaina had like 36 weathers or whatever and it was in the Calm Belt.</br>  What's the funniest moment in one piece?<br><br>IMO it's when vivi goes to her bed at alabasta to sleep and sanji is laying their and says he thought she could use some company in chapter 165</br></br>  so, is it normal that I barely give a fuck about Big Mom? I mean, I'm not hyped for her at all. I hope she turns out to be interesting in the long run, because right now I can't bring myself to care about her<br><br><br>what's up with the amount of italians in one piece and berserk threads<br><br> non che la cosa mi dia fastidio </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was that the closest Sanji has ever gotten to getting laid? I quite liked the Davyback arc as a whole, comedy wise.</br>  <br><br>Never mind, it's not even 36. Apparently it was 48 bloody seasons.</br></br>  <br>She hasn't been hyped much so that's understandable. And villain-wise Doffy is a pretty hard act to follow.</br>  <br>ya big mom seems the least interesting/powerful out of the yonko probably cause shes a fat woman<br><br>i hope she really fucks up sanji maybe she'll seem cooler then (hah not likely, who hasn't fucked up sanji at this point)</br></br></br>  <br>an it still shouldn't be before 18.00 iirc. But still, we could say that the sun stays in the sky for 20 hours in Dressrosa cause<br><br>So, even taking into account real world rules and stretching the times, it really isn't unreal that it all happened in a day. The thing is that there were so many characters and flashbacks in the arc that it seems much longer.<br><br> non ne ho idea, vengo su /a/ solo per il capitolo settimanale di OP o qualche informazione sul nuovo Lupin, ma ci son parecchi italiani per le varie board in generale </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meeting Crocus was hilarious. So was a lot of Skypiea. And meeting Chopper. Thriller Bark had a lot too. I don't think there is one I would call the absolute funniest. Stuff makes me laugh all the time.</br>  <br>Brook sayin "to be continued" while telling his story took me by surprise, I laughed a lot.</br>  <br>so who would win rayleigh vs hancock? im assuming rayleigh because he stalemated kizaru and I highly doubt hancock can do that. assuming rayleigh can counter her hax love beam in some way/ isnt affected by it</br>  <br> probably cause shes a fat woman <br><br>this will bring the SJWs out of their caves to rape me in the ass, but I would PROBABLY be hyped for big mom a bit more if she hadn't been shown as a hideous fatass woman. What can I say, it gives me strange vibes, the idea of a perfectly (seemingly) normal woman being a fucking yonko would be much more appealing to me.<br><br><br> lasciamo perdere, spesso sono incontri spiacevoli </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, meeting Brook and the scenes surrounding that was full of keks. Also ''The old man with major wounds'' and the dynamic duo.</br>  <br><br>Creepy. 2 seconds apart. <br>But yeah I know, even so, a crew with 2 people basically listed as 'champions' is a bit much. It would be nice to have the other dude join as an artist though.</br></br></br>  <br>Zoro's tarzan yell at Skypiea and Buggy moments in general.</br>  <br>Is this even a real question ? Of course it would be bloody Rayleigh. I'm not even underestimating Hancock but seriously ? The right hand of the Pirate King ? The man that even Garp knew was an absolute legend ? She probably can't hit people and turn them into stone if the area has CoA.</br>  <br>Be right back, researching some stuff.<br> New captchas! </br></br>  <br>I love how 'matter-of-fact' it was too. Zoro was like ''You were scared because you didn't do the call''. Can't believe he didn't have faith in the Afro.</br>  <br> Coffy <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Honestly a big fat woman could be cool, if just for the sake of fucking body diversity in OP. However she looks so fat she's sort of just sealed in the bottom of her ship. Maybe she's a giant?<br><br>I love me some tiddies but all the named/important women having the same bodytype/pretty face is boring and getting annoying.<br><br>Pic related, one of the only named women aside from Perona and Boa's two sisters I can think of that doesn't look like a Nami/Robin impersonator.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking Garp man. We need more of that nigga.</br>  <br>The just complete juxtaposition of Buggy and Mr 3 in the War of the Best.</br>  <br>yeah you're right, a completely normal body type would be somehow boring, but I don't know, even something like miss monday as you just posted would appeal more to me. Matter of opinions I guess,  and no I don't think she's a giant, she probably became like that for fuck knows what reasons </br>  Am I the only one who want the monster trio to stop? Why exactly should Luffy, Zoro and Sanji get all stronger while neglecting strength grow in let's say, Jimbei? Imho each new member should have it's own strengths and weakness, Jimbei around water should always be stronger than Zoro and the logia crew member could have a hax ability like Perona (Someone like Cesar who can defeat the SH by asphyxia) monster quintet would be so much better than anyone joining automatically being under Sanji powerwise.  <br>Too true, brother.

The best site I found has it hardsubbed in laggy 480p with a chatbox of people *actiontexting* next to it. The fact that there are people who actually consume their anime this was in their regular life honestly sickens me, I never knew casuals were this plebeian in how they consume their Naruto. Sometimes I think people take the level of non-casual entry-level retardation on /a/ for granted.  <br>KissAnime is a decent solution in case stream is a must. 1080p and all other qualities are there, but there's a small watermark in the corner of the anime.</br>  Why couldn't the mangaka make him even slightly useful and not amnesiac 24/7? Isn't he supposed to be attractive to ladies?  The legs in this show hnnnnnnnnnng  Darien is always useful. Nigga always showed up to save the scouts by tossing a Distraction Rose. And then he learned how to ASTRALLY PROJECT so that even when he was just sitting on the toilet taking a dump he could appear in Astral Form as the Moonlight Knight and throw a scimitar to behead those who insult the Moon, or something like that. Same technique he used later to astrally project himself as Endymion of the future.<br><br>Well, actually I guess he's been shit-useless in Crystal, but no one in Crystal is important except for Usagi because she's an attention-hungry meatball mary sue.</br></br>  <br>The show was incredibly - pardon the word - progressive for its time, in the idea that the girls were in charge and pretty much handled everything by themselves - There were a few minor occasions in which Tuxedo Mask was useful (His fight against Rubeus in the brawl episode of R comes to mind. While Ai no Senshi plays) but it was clear that he was just eye candy. I guess progressive's not exactly the word, since it would've been cool for him to do more. I think in the manga he actually is the user of the Gold crystal in the "Super S" part but we had to suffer Chibi Moon instead.</br>  I'd just like to take a moment and say the few minutes I watched of the English dub were excruciatingly painful. <br><br>Original<br> Zoisite fabulous gay villain <br> has beautiful romance with Kunzite  <br> Mamoru and Usagi's romance actually written well <br> dat episode where they find out their secret identities filled with such emotion  <br><br>English Dub<br> Zoisite a "tough" girl <br> doesn't even seem to be interested in Kunzite (Malachite)  <br> Usagi (Serena) is a complete OMGTEEHEE tween <br> Mamoru (Darien) unappealing nasally prepubescent boy <br> nothing romantic when they find out their secret identities  <br><br>Like, I get wanting to change things a bit to appeal to a different audience but it felt like a completely different show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This face still hurts to look at. Who in their right mind would turn their back on someone like her?</br>  <br>On the plus side, Darien's first VA was one of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Men.</br>  <br>I pisses me off even more that no version of SM ever follows up on this plotline or even has Jupiter involved in anything interesting beyond random episodic stuff.</br>  <br> Girl Zoicite <br> bad <br><br>Please nigga, she was the one villain the dub did right. Don't be dissin her memory.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not realising how big an influence English Sailor Moon was on the Mexican dub and how much this contributed to it being the best version of SM overall </br>    Posting best sera  <br>My fellow african american.<br>SM Latin dub is just excellent, specially later on the series, when Venus starts acting silly and with villains like Mimette.<br>I just can't get enough of it...</br></br></br>  <br> I just can't get enough of it... <br>Well, so far it's the closest thing to an 'ideal' Sailor moon that paves over all the flaws of the series. The Latin dub really benefits from the direction partially taking after the early episodes of the English dub and giving Serena a soft, sweet sounding voice.<br><br>I'm still massively buthurt over Crystal not being the 'uber' adaptation of SM that I desperately hoped it would be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And hurt me even more that they portraid them as lesbians. Im looking at you Korra.</br>  Is chibiusa a representative for America? Her casual clothes says otherwise  <br>I liked Latin american SM, i dont know about americans, but here if you watched that shit you where considered a fag. It was before Anime was a thing. I remember that we had secret meetings in recess to talk about the show. I even remember some guy whos parents didnt let him watch the show, so he always asked for everything. <br>I dont know if anyone of them turned fags tho.</br></br>  <br>tfw you're the one fag that likes usagi</br>  <br> but here if you watched that shit you where considered a fag <br>I assume that would have been true in most places. I'm an upsidedownfag and the guys who watched it here would always deny it, while DBZ was the thing to watch. I don't know of any place where it would be acceptable to admit to enjoying it to a general audience of your peers as a dude.</br></br>  <br>I kinda understand. I only watched like 2 episodes of SM as a kid and stopped right there, because I was afraid of other kids calling me a fag or shit like that. <br>It wasn't until a few years ago that I decieded to give it a try and oh boy I regret not doing it before...</br></br>  <br>Anime Usagi is lovely, I bet you're not alone anon.</br>  <br> Who here has read and enjoyed the W.I.T.C.H. comics? Best straight up rip off of SM by far. </br>  <br>This so fucking much.</br>  <br>I like her in every form Anon.<br>But I like ever Sailor Senshi so I'm a bit biased.<br><br> &gt;New mario SM CGset never </br></br></br></br>    Minako-chan is just Usagi if she were written by an American author.<br><br>And that's really fucking rad.</br></br>                    http://a.uguu.se/oqreti.webm  <br>As  said, you're not alone. I think Usagi is kawaii. I think people don't like her because she's the main senshi and therefore gets all the attention.</br>    <br>my waifu</br>      <br>ALWAYS GETTING IN A GANG FIGHT<br>SHE IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR COON</br></br>  I need to get on this train. I've been putting it off for too long.      <br>best usagi</br>  Anyone have the gif of the girls spinning around the waitress trying to hide from Mars?  <br>Get on the train anon! I finally did this summer and am genuinely loving it. I am no longer just a nostalgic fangirl who watched a few episodes of the English sub as a kid.</br>  What is the appeal of this show?<br>I tried watching it but the main character is a whiny crybaby with an annoying voice.</br>  <br>Teenage girls in short skirts that do provocative transformation sequences.</br>  <br> Wasting a slot on a samefag </br>  <br>Nostalgia<br>It's funny sometimes<br>Color scheme and 90's feel is nice</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, Venus should just have stayed the protagonist</br>  <br>I think I liked Mercury the most and Venus second.<br><br><br>But when I daydreamed about the series I always imagined myself as Usagi's siamese twin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It preceded Utena, hence has historical relevance.</br>    <br>the hypocritical MC is funny<br><br> Ah, I'm the embodiment of love <br><br> Even if god forgives you, I will never forgive you </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not hypocrisy.</br>  <br>okay, but at least a little contradictory.</br>  <br>No, not that either. Love and forgiveness don't always go hand in hand.</br>  <br>Love is subjective.<br>To me forgiveness is part of it.</br></br>    Crystal is fucking prude shit.  <br>it was a webm, dunno if there was gif too</br>  <br>How does any of this work?</br>  <br>Are mexicans the new americans? Mexicans always think their shit tier dubs are the best versions. Even superior to the originals.</br>  <br>Mexican dub is top quality, sometimes surpassing the originals. I recommend you to check out some of the original DBZ anime episodes from the Frieza saga. While Frieza felt nothing like in the japanese version it really sounded both evil and unforgiving. The same happens with Usagi in SM, the VA adds a lot to the character.<br><br>Also pic unrelated, I just ran out of SM on my phone</br></br></br>  <br> I recommend you to check out some of the original DBZ anime episodes from the Frieza saga <br><br>Pass. DBZ is garbage.<br>Mexican dubs may be better than American dubs since all american dubs are pure garbage but mexican dubs are no where near better than the originals.</br></br></br></br>    Entry level  <br>I've been watching it through for the first time and I've been really liking it. Yes, it's silly, it's cheesy and often downright corny and dumb. But it has a lot of heart and the girls all feel like teenage girls with teenage girl issues in addition to their whole "save the world" shtick.<br>It's not the greatest show in the world, but I'm sure having fun.</br></br>  <br>MOON OF INCOMPETENCE</br>  I want to be Rei's friend  <br>She doesn't want any.</br>  <br>Id make her want one</br>  <br>That sounds like rape</br>  <br>I dont mean it like that</br>      <br>All versions of Zoisite are goat. <br><br>Also, I had no idea there was a card game.</br></br></br>  <br> Rats! <br>We all know who's responsible, right?</br></br>  <br>Watch it in Spanish instead  or alternately watch the first few episodes in English . It fixes that problem.<br><br> What is the appeal of this show? <br>It's basically the most epic anime series ever made. It gets pretty insane and has the largest variety of great characters you will see.</br></br></br></br>  Is there a reason Stars is so hard to find?<br><br>Its not on nyaa, and any other torrent found has like 1 seeder at most.</br></br>  <br> Watch it in Spanish instead <br><br>Fucking mexicans. Your dub isn't any better than any other dub. They all suck.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, but it IS better. We can speak both english and spanish, and english fall pretty far behind.<br><br>Not to mention the necessity America had to completely change the Opening of most animes of the time, often by horrendous 'music' (see Dragon Ball Z &amp; Digimon), instead in spanish the original song is translated to spanish and used as the Opening.<br><br>If anything, America has made most of the worst dubs in history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not Mexican, don't even speak any form of Spanish and admit that the Latin dub isn't specifically as strong as some other dubs in many ways. But overall, there's no denying that out of all the ways to watch Sailor Moon, it's the least flawed and has the fewest annoying characters and that specifically is why it makes sense to recommend it. It succeeds in combining the positive qualities of dubs prior to it while removing the negative, so it's only natural that it would likely appeal to a new viewer more.</br>  <br><br>By we, I meant "I". My tastes.</br></br>  <br>Have you seen this one?<br>http://thepiratebay.se.com/torrent/<wbr>3502561/Sailor_Moon_[01_-_200]_[Com<wbr>plete]<br><br>I was able to download the entire series overnight. If you're just downloading ~39 episodes it shouldn't take TOO long.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Cheers, didnt even think to check piratebay, I thought it was defunct.<br><br>Found a torrent of the Russian dub though.</br></br></br>  <br>Its winter, dickhead</br>  <br> People still compare real people to mango people <br><br>Nothing about IRL people is reflected in Mangos these days, anon.<br>Don't confuse yourself, go mince with normies at least once a week or you're going to be a wreck when you realize that qt anime antics do not translate into real life at all and will likely land you in prison.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't torrent often so I guess I'm lucky enough to catch them when I need them. There's another torrent available for the movies but I haven't watched any yet so I can't vouch for quality. If you (or anyone else) ends up watching the first season I highly recommend downloading a different torrent for the episodes where Mako is introduced (26 I think) to episode 40. The video quality is garbage and the translations were too literal e.g. "I will destroy you" translated to "Me destroy you."</br>  <br>japanese voice acting isn't the untouchable holy grail you weebs think it is</br>  <br>I used [SMC] for everything else, including the movies.<br>Soft subs, and ripped straight from the DVDs. Chapter selections included and all.<br><br>Looks decent enough, but Ive never dived that deep into encoding and stuff to know for sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>[BunnyHat] made the best encode from the Italian DVDs, which had the best picture, even better than the Jap DVDs. Sadly, those were just raws.<br>Someone did mux in some subs, but I don't remember what name it was under.</br></br>  <br>There has got to be a weird and convoluted reason as to why the Italian release was better than the native jap one.</br>  <br>Poor compression and encoding when the Japs pressed the discs is all I can think. Or the poor decision to run DNR filters to try to wipe out the grain.</br>  What was the joke here, some japanese pun?  <br>Yes, precisely. The joke is that 'kintama' (kin for gold, tama for ball) means balls, in that sense, in Jap.<br><br>SuperS is full of tons of shit like this, it really surprises me how few people get what that season is going for.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, unless you're fluent its hard to pick up on stuff like that without a translators note.</br>  <br>They should have tried localizing the pun to one with similar meaning.</br>  <br> expecting fansubbers to actually think </br>  <br>anyone know what episode number this is?</br>  <br>103</br>  <br>thanks</br>      <br>Why is Venus so lewd?</br>   right in the feels   <br>Because love, anon.</br>    <br><br>I'd love to  cuddle  with Minako</br></br>  I-I'm not the only one who cried over her death in every adaptation, am I? <br><br>It just gets me every fucking time. The manga, both musicals, and even Crystal.</br></br>  <br>There have been Ranma, Sailor Moon, DBZ, and Pokémon threads on the board in the past week alone. The 90s are back with a vengeance.</br>  <br>SMC could really use scenes like this.<br><br>It's like they sucked all the fun out of SM.</br></br></br>  <br> localizing the pun <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br> Translating the literal meaning instead of the intent <br>That would be like using "drown the fish" in English.</br></br>  <br>They did, since they even took some of the fun panels in the manga out of Crystal.</br>  <br><br>They tried to bring it back during the Black Moon arc, but it feels like too little too late at this point.<br><br>The second half has been much better as a whole, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Back when Keiko Kitagawa didn't have a lazy eye.</br>  <br>Minako is such a fucking riot.<br><br>She just doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Got any other examples of her chicanery?</br>  What really sets Minako and Usagi apart is that, while Usagi constantly embarrasses herself, Minako has absolutely no sense of shame and restraint.  <br>This is still one of the funniest scenes in the entire series. the whole episode really<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lqg<wbr>1KCKMlL4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Is that supposed to be some metaphor for narcissism?</br>  <br>I really like this one, it's just too adorable...<br>https://<span>youtu.be/rE4gkelijRE  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>the only way to watch this show</br></br>    <br> I want to spank Usagi's ass too </br>  <br>Good grief I'm having a hard time watching Chibi-usa.

Is she really supposed to be 8? She looks barely old enough to be in 1st grade.</br></br></br></br>  <br> out of all the ways to watch Sailor Moon, it's the least flawed <br><br>Uh no? The least flawed way is the original Japanese.</br></br></br>  <br> weebs <br> saying this on /a/ </br></br>  <br> Is she really supposed to be 8? <br><br>Isn't Chibiusa like 1,008? Since she was born when Usagi was in her 20s and she goes back in time from the 30th century.</br></br></br>  <br>But then gets worse again in SuperS</br>  <br><br>They give her way too much screen time, but she was pretty good by the tume SuperS came about. She ended up being slightly more mature than Usagi was during season 1.</br></br>  <br>What's the story with Pluto, anyhow?</br>  <br>She used to be a Sailor Guardian, but then they took away her powers and status.</br>  <br><br>In general?<br><br>She's the guardian of the door of space-time, which is located in a void known as the underworld. She is as old as time itself, and nobody is supposed to know of her existence. As the guardian of time, there were three "taboos" that she should never commit: never to leave her post, never to let someone use the door to travel through time, and to never stop time using her powers. If she did the last one, it would kill her in the process.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didnt die in the original anime though did she?<br>The helicopter blows up, but dont we see her later?</br></br>  <br>I hope you aren't saying that Kotono Mitsuishi has an annoying voice.</br>  <br>Nat 20 stealth rolls and nat 1 perception</br>  <br><br>She died in the third season of the original anime, yeah. She showed up in the non-canon SuperS movie, but she didn't actually return until Stars. In the manga, she comes back halfway through the third arc.<br><br>Speaking of which, her helicopter death was pretty memorable too. It wasn't extremely sad like the one in the manga/crystal/musicals, but it was really haunting and shocking. I felt like it have Haruka and Michiru all the more reason to try and stop Mistress 9, like they wanted to make sure her sacrifice wouldn't be in vain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its implied that she dies because she invokes time stop. The Setsuna that shows up in Stars is probably reborn somewhere in the timeline and goes to where she is needed.<br><br>It works a lot better with the Time Stop as it occurs in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>So she's only in one episode, then?<br><br>And I'm presuming because she never leaves her post, she doesn't fight alongside the other scouts often, or at all?</br></br></br>  <br> scouts </br>  <br>The Japanese has some retardedly annoying shit in it. It is better than the other adaptations in a fuck ton of ways, but I'd hardly say its the least flawed.</br>  <br> It is better than the other adaptations <br><br>We're not talking different adaptations.

Yare Yare  <br>No. Diamond is Unanimateable.</br>  Don't know if this has been discussed already, but Jobin's Stand's name is confirmed to be Speed King<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9sG<wbr>y_-p_sVE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Oh, well that's neat. I wonder if they are going to draw any parallels between him and Yuuya.</br>  Why hasn't Araki referenced The Who yet? My favorite group isn't in Jojo.  <br> inb4 because The Who is shit </br>  Kira and Fatty confirmed for EoH<br>http://gematsu.com/2015/07/jojos-bi<wbr>zarre-adventure-eyes-heaven-adds-sh<wbr>igekiyo-akira-yoshikage<br><br><br>cool as fuck</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>And Otoishi*</br>  <br><br>And Lisa Lisa, right? Or was she already confirmed?</br></br>  <br>She was confirmed a while ago.</br>  <br> Speed King <br> Acceleration of particles produces heat <br>Heaven confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>Was already confirmed earlier, yeah.</br>  <br>Is this from the new Tanko or new chapter? <br>I'm guessing tank</br></br>    <br> STILL only one character for parts 5-8 </br>  <br>They're obviously going sequentially and Diego was only revealed because he's a big new addition and a highlight. They'll get there.</br>  <br>No. They're not sure if it's happening yet.</br>  Part 4 will probably be a OVA.  <br>Tank, chapter is sunday.</br>  <br>I wonder if any of you weeb fucks even listened to this type of music before Jojo introduced it to you</br>  <br>I thought OVA's sold like shit nowadays or something</br>  <br>I dunno. Maybe? But its Jojo so don't worry.</br>  <br>A niche band, Deep Purple.</br>  <br>I thought Bohemian Rhapsody was two different songs before reading Part 6. The "Mama just killed a man" part and the "Galileo, Galileo" part.</br>  <br> Fatty <br>disgusting<br> Yoshikage Kira as himself <br> Otoishi <br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bohemian Rhapsody is way too fucking overpowered.</br>  <br><br>So after finishing with Stardust i went on and saw the newer mangas, i was kinda dissapointed. <br><br>Why did the author decided to go from ultramasculine men to effeminate bishounens?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>fucking christ</br></br>  <br>Most of us knew some of these songs seperately<br>If anything, I'm proud JoJo's is getting me introduced into bands and musics which I never really payed attention to, like The Cars and King Nothing</br></br>  <br>I was very obviously being sarcastic with the niche comment, Anon.<br><br>Blackmore is one of the GOAT guitarists.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 2015 <br> Liking a shitty guitar player that played in a band that was popular when your dad was a kid. </br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Not liking a shitty guitar player that played in a band that was popular when your dad was a kid. </br></br>  I read it as <br> mfw new JoJo's Bizarre Adventure coming out today <br>I read it again, and was dissapointed</br></br>  what happens?  <br>Valentine dies.<br><br>With Love Train? Who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing beyond some rumors and hints. We probably won't hear anything confirmed till Christmas.</br>  <br>His hair looks like something done in paint</br>      <br>Looked worse in the manga.</br>   yfw   EoH doesn't have a western release   <br>but even without love train, he was able to fragment people of himself into the other dimension just by pouring water on himself.<br><br>He side crossing dimensions has no effect on him. So would creams dimensional transport?</br></br></br>  <br>Cream just disintegrates people with its mouth.</br>    JJBA is shit  <br>funny meme</br>  <br> JoJo anime part 4 comes out <br> someone subs it with Duwang </br></br>  <br>But it was already trademarked in EU.</br>  <br>There was Duwang subs for some of the Phantom Blood anime and SC anime</br>  <br>All the Duwang subs are seriously unfunny.</br>  <br><br><br><br>well it will still cut his limbs anyways</br></br></br></br>  <br>no it just brings you into another Dimension. He literally calls his power "my dark dimension. Hes just displacing everything he touches into another dimension forcibly. <br><br>The quote he literally says is "I scatter you piece by piece across my dark dimension." So imagine as his little orb is hitting you more of you is cut out of his dimension and sent the other. That'd kill you because a piece of you is not with the main body here.<br><br>However Valentine is not affected by this, as shown with the water trick where he put the middle his face into another dimension and wasn't harmed at all, crossing dimensions doesn't hurt him at all because of D4C.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Diego doing the Anaconda pose on the American flag?</br>  Which part has the best stands?  <br>Eh, It's arguable. I would probably say part 6, personally.</br>  <br>I'm only part way through Stone Ocean, but for me it'd be Vento Aureo, though King Crimson is a confusing son of a bitch</br>  <br><br>Duwang is lightning in a bottle.</br></br>  Why is she best Jojo?  <br>Worm :^)</br>  <br>She's to impure to be a JoJo.</br>  <br>I'll have to go with Vento.</br>  <br> you will never get to feel jolyne's jojos </br>  <br>Why couldn't Araki draw her like that for part 6</br>  <br> introduced masturbating in a jail cell <br> has been involved in gangs and crime since adolescence <br> dated a dirty coward who framed her for a crime she didn't commit <br> divorced parents <br> spoils the Sixth Sense to the others watching during Jail House Lock <br> gets killed by a gay priest <br> fails to save the universe, but DOES save an eleven year old kid <br> that kid kills gay priest <br><br>Yeah, Jolyne is a pretty shitty JoJo. She only gets brownie points for being a woman everyone wants to have sex with, which only serves to make her even more vile and disgusting.<br><br><br>See my point?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you one of those faggots? Had no idea, just kill yourself, enjoy your shitty music.</br>  I don't understand Purple Haze Distortion, could Fugo control it? And what was his power, the fact that if he lost control all the spheres would burst and the virus would kill itself, so he could only break one at a time?  <br>I was in Tokyo and Osaka when Stardust Crusaders was airing. They had sections of stores just dedicated to JoJo merchandise and figmas, and on the Saturday following an aired episode every figma shop in Akihabara and Denden would be selling figmas of the "stand-user of the week" and they'd have mini events.<br><br>based on that, I'd say yeah, we'll get Part 4. The blurays might sell like shit, the dvds might sell like crap but holy hell they're probs making tons on merchandise sales.</br></br></br>  <br>My main problem with Part 6 is that it was a complete low-point in Araki's career in terms of how he drew faces. He was horrible at them here.</br>  <br>His power was being so OP he got written out of the manga.</br>  <br>I'm talking about PHD, not the regular PH. Haven't you read the novel?</br>  <br>symbolism. it's just to signify how fucked up he is</br>  <br> reading light novels </br>  <br>Purple Haze Feedback is more like a regular if short novel<br><br>I never understood the use of "light"</br></br></br>  <br>JARE JARE</br>  Does anyone have that 10000x10000 picture of kakyoin?    <br>Aspect ratio was wrong, this one should be fine.</br>  <br>I started listening to Oingo Boingo and Kraftwerk because of Jojo.<br>  They are now my favorite bands  </br></br>  <br>kraftwerk's songs are just too long AND repetitive, I can only take one of them<br><br>and oingo boingo only had that hit songs Dead Man's Party, they're terrible otherwise</br></br></br>  <br>The unsung hero of Part 8</br>  At any and all ages, Joseph is Love. Joseph is Life  <br>It's a new one but the one I was looking for was him in the cave laughing</br>    <br>I just want Araki to finish Jojo and start working on a professional beetle fighting manga.</br>    <br>do a 10000x10000 quality DIO</br>  <br> One of the things that got me into Jojo was that shit was named after my favorite dad rock songs. </br>  <br>Thanks,Doc.</br>  <br>I would read that too anon.</br>    <br><br>Because its not the 80's anymore. Araki's artstyle is now truly his own.</br></br>  Am I the only fag that downloaded Jojo's Bizarre OST from nyaa?  <br>cute</br>  <br><br>Purple Haze Distortion can cancel any virus with the use of other viruses. So Fugo can selectively infect people by healing people he wants to keep alive.</br></br>  <br>nice, didn't pick up he can heal now too</br>  <br><br>He can only heal viruses. And I used "healing" too loosely, he basically just gets rid of viruses by cancelling them out. So if you had a virus, he could infect you with another and have them both destroy each other.</br></br>  <br>Arakis artstyle peaked mid to late Part 4, but it was a good peak.</br>  <br>clearly it picked up in late part 7, my favorite characters were johnny, long-haired johnny and girl johnny</br>  <br>I'd say there was two peaks for his artstyle, one at the end of Part 3 for when everyone was muscular, and on at the end of Part 4 when everyone was more realistic bodywise but not all skinny twinks. I remember Jotaro being kind of bulky at the end of Part 4, but not super skinny like he is now.</br>  <br><br>Suck my dick. I was a hipster before I was ever a weeb.</br></br>  <br>If they don't add weather report i'm going to be mad. They added fucking Fugo in ASB and not him.</br>  <br>I think you mean Gyro, lame legs Gyro, and girl Gyro</br>  <br><br><br> Tfw not alone <br><br>I loved every Vento stand except Soft Machine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking Fugo after PHF </br>  <br><br>Part 5: Risotto Nero, Trish, Ice Skates guy<br>Part 6: FF, Weather Report, Guess, Dio's idiot sons<br>Part 7: Hot Pants, Wekapipo, Sandman, Mike O, Mandom<br>Part 8: Nobody really has a punchghost, maybe once we know about Karera, Josefumi, and the brothers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even baby face?</br>  <br>I don't remember that page and I've seen it posted a lot.</br>  <br>It was super random and weird, at the end of the soft machine fight.</br>  <br>White Album would be so much fun to play<br>also lol guess would be fucking shit</br></br>  <br> risotto  <br> making it in the game <br>His stand is too weird and overkill,how are you even going to play him?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You gotta do a victory dance to assert dominance. Have you never been in an Italian gang?</br></br>  <br>Not them, but I thought Baby Face was quite cool, except from the design</br>  <br> Italian <br>Judging by West Side Story, shit's standard for ALL gangs</br></br>   Jotaro has special quotes against Jonathan in EoH <br>Niceu. Will all the Joestars have special quotes against each other? Because that would be pretty dope.</br>  <br> literally defies every single rule about stand  <br>Just what the fuck araki</br></br>  <br>Don't knock it, it helped in the PMMM crossover by BeefSkellington.</br>  <br>I can imagine it, especially something like Joseph and Josuke</br>  <br>oh lol, you haven't seen many ASB videos, because EVERY CHARACTER had a quote for every character, and a taunt to josuke's hair, and a line joseph could predict</br>  <br>Pinball Wizard would be an awesome stand name. So would Baba O'Riley. Its power would be to not get fooled again. Don't get fooled again. No, no.</br>  <br><br>Guess would be hilarious. Turning people into tiny little dolls would be a giggle m8.</br></br>  <br>We meant a pre-fight line</br>  <br>Same thing for Dio's bastards.<br><br>Rykiel could be done with some creativity but I don't see how they could make Bohemian Rhapsody and Under World fit into a fighting game. If there's any new villain characters from part 6, it'll probably be Westwood and Kenzou since they're more physical fighters.</br></br></br>  <br>ASB too had special pre-fight lines</br>  <br> that one chapter where araki said fuck it I'll make a stand with a power level based off its rape victim </br>  <br>Under World can fit as a punch ghost with the user pulling stuff from the ground, Bohemian Rhapsody can't. Rykiel would be pretty fun to fight as.</br>  <br>How about the Highway to Hell guy? You just have to spend the whole fight trying to utilize stage hazards to commit suicide with.</br>  <br>I was so mad when Josuke only had unique dialogue with Oldseph, but hopefully we can mess around with what teams we can build.<br><br> You know what to do, Doc. </br></br></br>  <br>I think from part 5 Secco and Ciocolatta could also fit well in the game since the stages have higher and lower areas for Green Day and they're an easy tag-team.</br>  <br> 128219046 <br>not every character had a special line for every character, for example Ceasar and Dio</br></br>  <br>Ya that would actually be a perfect addition, or at the very least have a stage based around ciocolatta.</br>  <br><br> Specifically requires blood sample from the target <br> Needs to be incubated inside a woman <br> Learns like he's Johnny Number 5 or some shit <br> justfuckmystandup.jpeg <br><br>Okay him and Soft Machine sucked, but the others were pure shenanigans. Notorious BIG becoming a Bermuda Triangle unto itself had me in stitches.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, we know.<br>But Jotaro didn't have one with Jonathan. Just sayin' it would be cool if every Jojo had them with each other.<br><br>Like, have Giorno talk shit to Johnny and stuff like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Gee Emporio, how come Big Sis lets you have two stands? </br></br>  What would sex pistols requiem be like?  <br>It would erase the number 4 from existence.</br>  <br>ok<br>(salad captcha)</br></br>  <br>Bohemian Rhapsody maybe could kinda work like a puppet character where Ungalo can sic the Mother Goat on enemies and shit.<br><br>Nevermind, it's fucking dumb, and N'doul kinda does that gimmick already, anyway.</br></br></br>  Hot pants in EoH when  <br> and a taunt to josuke's hair, and a line joseph could predict <br> Why did you style your hair like that? it's a disgrace to have you as my future son! Your next line will be "What the Fuck did you say about my hair!" . </br></br>  <br><br>It looks at your achievements/trophies and looks at what games you've played and randomly summons a character from it.<br><br>You control Rykiel's floating cocks with the Playstation Camera/  Xbox Kinect  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Bigger chances than Wekapipo and Mike O.</br>  How would Hermit Purple Requiem work?  <br>She's in but  in a menu .</br>  <br> It looks at your achievements/trophies and looks at what games you've played and randomly summons a character from it. <br>Oh, that could be nice.<br>Or maybe Deadpool it up and make the HUD attack or something.<br><br> You control Rykiel's floating cocks with the Playstation Camera/ Xbox Kinect  <br>Why</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT IGGY AND KOICHI ARE LOADING ICONS DECON-FUCKING-FIRMED<br><br>Unless she's a talking head somewhere, she may still be in.</br></br></br>  <br>Omnipotence</br>  If there isn't a stand introduced in part 8 called "A Farewell to Kings", I'm gonna be so fucking upset  <br>Adultery is now undetectable</br>   tfw nobody that matters dies in part 4 so there won't be any meme spoilers   <br><br>Or Street King Immortal by 50 Cent<br><br>It's all up to Hato now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rohan, then not actually</br>  <br><br> I haven't read part 5 </br></br>  <br>Koichi was a loading icon in ASB, though.</br>  <br>I have though</br>  <br>Tell them Joseph is a senile old man. That'll be as bad as him dying to the animeonlys.</br>  <br><br>As was Iggy.</br></br>   Killer Queen <br> King Diamond <br> Prince - Soft &amp; Wet <br><br>dont COUNT ON IT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the line</br>  <br>My moon sucks but he clearly says "Jonassan".</br>  <br>Hold on, I'm confused. Was that guy saying Koichi and Iggy were deconfirmed as characters, or deconfirmed as loading icons?</br>  <br>lmfaoooooo</br>  <br>He was being ironic.</br>  <br> implying <br>Just yesterday an animeonly got butthurt because i spoilt him rohan and the entire cast dying</br></br>  <br>Something along the lines of "Jonathan Joestar, it's an honor to fight beside you" and "Jotaro, truly you are the inheritor of my will!"</br>  <br>It doesn't seem like Jotaro would say something like that. And I like how Johnathan just ignores Jorge and Joseph.</br>  <br>That's so fanfiction-tier that I love it intensely.<br><br>I can't fucking wait to see all the unique dialogue.</br></br></br>  <br> It doesn't seem like Jotaro would say something like that. <br>one of his most consistent character traits is great respect for people that deserve it<br><br> And I like how Johnathan just ignores Jorge and Joseph. <br>jorge is a fag and joseph didn't beat up dio</br></br></br></br></br>  What will you do when the far left confirmed as the mastermind for the elaborate ruse and actually the glasses girl didn't have anything to do with it?  <br>The middle one was always reminding me of someone and I finally found about it.</br>  <br>Continue fapping to meganeko</br>  <br>Does it matter? They'll all die anyway.</br>  <br> Tfw the fest one will join them </br>  <br>I did not see this chapter.

Nobody will find the thread because you put the tag as your name.</br>  Just finished reading the second volume. While the anime has clear differences (much more lighthearted, more focus on the cuter parts) I do think they've done a good job so far. Having Miki present from the start was a positive change I think (even though the mall rescue is a good scene). Is the dog anime only?  <br>No, it had 5 panels in the manga.</br>  <br>yuki fighting windmills when?</br>      Dem rii-riis.  <br>So pretty much nothing. My only real complaint is that whoever typeset the first 2 volumes of the manga did a horrible job.</br>  Does this manga come out monthly? All the manga I like is always monthly dammit.  <br>I think that was intentional.</br>  <br> heavy breathing <br><br><br>I like to think they wanted to show Yuki's not listening.</br></br></br></br>    Miia    <br>I didn't care for her much in the manga, but the anime version is absolutely gorgeous.</br>  <br>She could've been masturbating long before the call, though? <br>I mean she doesn't look like she's having a cold.</br></br>  is this bestiality?  <br>mo' like best-iality</br>  What has to be done to make Sakura more popular?  <br>F U L L <br>R<br>O<br>N<br>T <br>A<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Steal senpai's married swords</br>  <br>She already is<br><br>Compare Sakura's popularity now to 2009/2010 is night and day.</br></br></br>  <br>But can she ever surpass Rin and Seibah?</br>  If she was a virgin she would be more popular tbh  The HF movie(s) needs to actually come out.  <br> Saber <br>No one will <br><br> Rin <br>Possible and likely once we get closer to HF</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's completely wrong.</br>  For starters, she'd have to unsuck those 10,000 dicks.  Less worms would be a good direction.  <br>The movies might actually make her less popular.<br><br>Notice how she became less popular the farther away she was associated with HF?</br></br></br>  <br> No one will <br>There's always a way.</br></br>  WORMSLUT<br>O<br>R<br>M<br>S<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more popular, I mean.</br>  <br>She has the most dangerous Berseker card installed. That's crazy.</br>  <br>Not really<br><br>HF is pretty well known at this point. She has simply gotten more popular as time has gone on.<br><br><br>I wish but not even Ryougi Shiki could beat her in the last poll.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Remove worms. Make her a virgin. Nobody wants used goods, at least in anime.<br>Except cucks.</br>  <br>She got more popular as she appeared in things like Hollow Ataraxia and the Extra games. It's a noted fact that HF got an initial lukewarm reception.<br><br>I mean let's face the facts, HF is a very divisive route, and there are plenty of reasons to dislike Sakura because of what happens in it.</br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/832265/338219<wbr>b359/</wbr>  <br> I mean let's face the facts, HF is a very divisive route, and there are plenty of reasons to dislike Sakura because of what happens in it. <br>This is why I am excited to see what Ufotable does.<br><br>They know they have a big load on there hands and they have to deal with it but I trust they know what they are doing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They already made /CCC a thing which has more copies in it than Unlimited Blade Warks. <br><br>/CCC is basically all Sakura all the time. They couldn't even fit in all the Sakura Clones they wanted to. There's no Reality Marble capable of activating within the Serial Phantasm which could contain that much Sakura. <br><br>If /CCC is unable to boost her popularity by association then there's nothing you can do short of Takeuchi Secret Art: Seiba Shill OVERLOAD.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She was 8th out of literally every character the company has ever made before CCC came out, and another fan of hers joined the company, which means the majority Nasu said that favors her in her dictionary entry grew.<br><br>She's fine. Even Nasu had to lay off the jokes a bit when she got top ten twice in a row. Not that he hates her, but he tends to stick to the same memes over the years.</br></br></br></br>  Heaven's Feel, the best route in F/SN, needs to be animated.  Less worms.  <br>The Food Network airs a live action version 24/7.</br>  <br>She needs to fuck Shinji more.</br>  <br>I might like her if she learned Japanese, or at least another word besides "senpai".</br>  Sakura is a Kohaku who didn't have the guts to plot to murder all the people she felt abused by, because after seeing Uncle Loser lose and be devoured by worms she realized there's no point in opposing Grandfather.<br><br>Kohaku only became accepted by otaku after twisting her into Magical Girl Amber, the stronger and more terrifying onee-sama of Ruby and Sapphire.<br><br>Likewise, Sakura will need to acquire parody characteristics to gain approval.</br></br></br></br>  <br>10 years too later for that. Kagetsu Tohya started to rebrand Kohaku's character, then Melty Blood made her a lot more lighthearted and popular.<br><br>HA pretty much had her be Sakura, with her yandere bits slightly exaggerated. CP just made fun of how shit she was.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Makihisa gave an abuse victim tutelage in medical knowledge of demon hybrids by his own family physician. With free range to use them, as well as trust. If she didn't have the tools to exact it, she would be mentally handicapped, it was almost served on a silver platter. <br><br>Sakura had a bomb collar wrapped around her neck with Zouken's familiars inside her body, draining her mana every second of every day, with a mental switch that could kill her anytime he wished. That is what happens when you give a four year old to a crazy archmagus.<br><br>If Sakura really wanted revenge (she doesn't, check her dictionary entry), it was impossible under her own power, and she is monitored by her every heartbeat.<br><br>The two situations are galaxies apart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's top eight in the entire franchise, she's already popular even if some don't want to admit it<br><br>She's not top one in every TM franchise to date or top two, but she is popular. She's officially more popular than Gilgamesh or almost every Tsukihime heroine save from Arc.<br><br>People can spin hairs however, but she is recognized enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and Seibah? <br><br>No</br></br></br>  <br> She's officially more popular than Gilgamesh <br><br>No she isn't. The poll that had that split Gil's votes between FSN Gil, and Zero Gil. You combine all the Sakura votes and all the Gil votes, and Gil has more.<br><br>Sakura is actually in 9th place.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CCC did boost her popularity, but people just sort of immediately jumped ship "This isn't Sakura, this is better, don't associate them anymore" to avoid Sakura from ruining the popularity of their new versions.<br><br>In some ways it is true; the AI's are notably chaste and do have entirely different and dynamic personalities, but at the same time its not hard to see how they're parts of Sakura's personality broken up as well.<br><br>BB already seems on her way to becoming one of the new more popular characters along with Elizabeth from CCC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A number of characters were split, its not just him, I'd think even Sakura herself was since she also had a Zero version. Some were miffed at how Kotomine was split, but they versions of these people are still rather different in a way. After all Gilgamesh was an actual character in Zero.<br><br> Sakura is actually in 9th place. <br><br>Don't kid how this works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BB is superior in every way for me.</br>  <br>I am factoring all versions of Sakura on the poll and all versions of Gilgamesh. You add up both, and Gil comes out to more.<br><br>http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Popu<wbr>larity_polls<br><br>You can do the math.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Sakura got 4th in Newtype in May even though she was no longer in the anime. Most likely from the manga but still huge  If she gave a long, sloppy blowjob to every TM fan and swallowed. I'm sure she's skilled at it.  <br>Hmm, I wonder what her popularity will stand once HF comes out.</br>  <br>And dropped out of the top 10 entirely the next month.</br>  <br>Probably make her less popular.</br>  <br>Her problem has always been something of a lack of exposure. Doesn't do much in two routes of the games, isn't advertised like the other heroines, no adaptions, not ever seen, she's the forgotten one at times.<br><br>Would be interesting to see if being in the lime light would change much there.</br></br></br>  <br>People keep saying that but I really doubt that. With F/Z airing prior to HF it really help people deal with the route more since it the route that has the most natural flow from F/Z.</br>    <br>No</br>  <br> Bestia </br>  <br><br>Like I said it was a result of the manga happening.<br><br>No one should expect her to stay on top like that. Illya got knocked out also and so did Lancer and Kirei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People must have really been into whatever week the previous episode of Fate was there.<br><br>Everyone feels like they dropped a peg there.<br><br>Kirito took over<br><br>You lost to fucking Kirito, he's more popular now faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>a wild shinobu as expected of best girl. BTFO crabfags.</br>  <br>Kirito is the new Jesus now that Jesus is banned.</br>  <br>No, F/Z has nothing to do with how bad she is in the route.</br>  <br>This<br>Lelouch, Kirito, and Jesus don't count as they are in just cause.</br></br>  <br>There's always Jesus classic</br>  <br>Bitching about your subjective experiences as though they're fact.<br><br>She's not bad in her route<br><br>Reason she even has fans is because a number of people liked her in her route.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fully replace her with Ilya.</br>  <br>My nigga</br>  <br> Kirito <br>But Jesus was a man. Kirito isn't masculine enough to be called one.</br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but you plaster a character in front of a screen for 10 hours and chances are some folks will get attached no matter what. Of course a character who has a route is going to have fans.</br>  <br>I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>No they liked her in HA, and don't tell me that she is liked here.</br>  <br> Kirito is the new Jesus now <br>Kirito will never be on the level of Onii-sama.</br></br>  <br>Its not about manliness nigga. Its OP chara.</br>  <br>Onii-sama is a boy. Kirito is a girl. They're incomparable.</br>  <br>She is one in RN.</br>  <br>Fun fact, it's going to be.</br>  is the ubw anime any different from the vn?  <br> The Producer is always in the fucking top 5 <br><br>He has literally no character. He's just a fucking self-insert, voting for him is like voting for yourself. Holy shit Japan, stop being so faggot.<br><br>Having Kirito in #3 is bad enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a faithful retelling of the True End path to the game with some additional scenes and an expanded epilogue.</br>  Kirito's popularity genuinely annoys me.<br><br>How can anyone like such a horrendous character? The other classmates in my screenwriting class can make trash characters more interesting than him.</br></br>  <br>He's a self-insert.</br>  <br>Differences:<br> Stuff that happened offscreen is onscreen now <br> Shirou and Archer fight inside UBW, instead of just in the castle. Personally I liked that change. <br> They changed the very end of the Shirou/Gil fight, the grail eats him just as Shirou is about to bring down K&amp;B <br> They expand on the epilogue <br> Saber kills Berserker once, she just beat him up a bit in the VN <br><br>All I can think of.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You now need to watch the anime and read the VN to get the full story.</br>  <br>Will she kiss Shirou in the movies?</br>  <br>Supposedly Archer's Caladbolg killed Berserker once as well, meaning he lost two lives in that fight.</br>  <br>She will either kiss him, drink his blood or they do it like crazy.<br><br>No matter what they will go farther than the UBW anime.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think there was kissing in RN so no.</br>  <br> He has literally no character. <br><br>Are you stupid, or did you just not watch it? 765 Producer didn't have any personality, but the Producer in the new CG anime they went out of the way to make his character stand out and be central in some of the first few episodes. Guy was full of personality, even if if his personality wasn't out spoken as a point.<br><br>Fans who watches the series early on were mostly watching it for him, before the girls started to stand out in their units.<br><br>Guy was awkward as fuck in that way that really gets your attention and makes him likable at times. He can fuck up realistically, but you get the feeling he's trying his hardest, but just can't communicate properly. They especially went out of the way with the non verbal or physical communication with him, kind of like with Chihaya. 765 Producer was a self insert do gooder guy who's popular with everyone and just gives friendship speech while knowing what to say. CG Producer is a guy who can't relate to anyone or say anything right, just holds out his card and gets arrested by the cops each time, follows girls each day with the same approach, hard working tank with a smile fetish like man who Japan can only assume is some sort of pedo, but he has a dream.<br><br>I'll just go with you having not watched it. I mean clearly you didn't.<br><br>They made it fucking clear he wasn't just a stand in for the audience by giving him an outlandish and clear personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That I question. I also question the fight against GIl later, because Gil kills him twelve times, then says Berserker is on his last life. But Saber killed him already, so Berserker should be on his -1 life.<br><br>Granted he was pretty much on his -10 life and still broke Enkidu. I think the writers lost track of Berserker's lives.</br></br></br>  She'll never be as popular as Rin and saber, anyone who thinks she will surpass any of them in popularity is delusional.  <br>Sorry man, but IdolM@ster isn't exactly quality story material.</br>  <br> &gt;Saber kills Berserker once, she just beat him up a bit in the VN <br><br>She was able to evade him in the VN but it was clear she was fucked, then he took an A rank NP to the face and they went "Is this guy impossible?"<br><br>At no point did she really beat him up, he was the clear tank advantage even in that route. Although she did better than the other routes.<br><br><br><br>Nasu confirmed that Heracles deflected Caladbolg in the VN so he lost no lives, but he lost two lives in that moment in the anime since he wasn't in a position to block it since he was still healing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  remove worms  <br>So you didn't watch it<br><br>Gotcha then</br></br></br>  <br> Although she did better than the other routes. <br>Eh, HF is a copy pasta from Fate.</br></br>  <br>She's surpassed Rin very briefly twice so far, but if its not a very big and clear victory like that tenth anniversary poll, then Rin fans will just go "That doesn't count" to bypass it.<br><br>It wasn't a very long lived victory, but they both happened.<br><br>No one will ever surpass Saber though, its just not happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In an interview for the first BD Nasu said he definitely confirmed he lost two lives.<br><br>The problem is that it was animated in a way that made it seem the exact opposite, with no signs of him being hurt, and Rin outright saying Archer's attack didn't do anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IIRC they specifically say Saber's winning the fight once they reach the graveyard and she has cover. Granted that's before you find out about his NP/takes a Kaladbolg to the face. That's when they realize he's impossiburu.</br>  <br> Eh, HF is a copy pasta from Fate. <br><br>No shit, because the individual elements that led up to that fight in both those cases did not change drastically, so butterfly effect did not come into play.<br><br>Meanwhile the fight in one route took place in a very different location. It wasn't a complete copy pasta, but the individual pieces were too similar for it to happen differently. Fight still took place close to Shirou's house there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a girly man with a face so delicate that he's often mistaken for a girl. He's a trap anon.</br>  <br>People say the phone one doesn't count because it literally has an OC made for a website ranking in the top 10.</br>  <br>Good luck convincing faggots that don't think they're the Producer that your series is anything more than pandering for otakus.</br>  <br>Isn't that like complaining about Hakuno being popular in an Extra poll?<br><br>Of course new character will be popular in their own story thing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, that Kaladbolg killed Berserker? You're right, that's not at all what it looked like. It looked like he tanked it and shrugged. There's zero indication that it even scratched him.<br><br>Guess they fucked that up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No one will ever surpass Saber though, its just not happening. <br><br>Rin did.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read the RN version of FSN, but isn't she a virgin in that version?</br>  <br>Hakuno is a protagonist in two video games. No one fucking knows who the chick from the mobile website is.<br><br>Like here she is. Do you know this character?</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu gave them the scripts, they had to figure out how it should look in motion. So yea<br><br>Q: For Berserker's Noble Phantasm "God Hand," it says that he'll gain resistance to any attack he's been dealt, but does it require for him to "die" for this to happen? Would the same attack work multiple times so long as he doesn't die from it?<br><br>Nasu: There's no need for him to die. It's something like...for example, if he is damaged by flames, after his wounds heal he'd gain +100 fire resistance or so.<br>Takeuchi: Hey, seems like it's been toned-down. Wouldn't it have rendered flames completely ineffective before?<br>Nasu: I said it wouldn't work, not that it would become completely ineffective.<br>BB: "I nullify all attacks, and Mr. Macho there triples his defense! How are these two any different?!"<br>Herakles: "(I'm not hacking the system like you are!)"<br>Takeuchi: Either way, it's a pretty broken skill.<br><br>  It's like this. In the original work it was like "up until now it were just attacks that don't even need to be evaded, but since this alone will cause a fatal wound Berserker intercepted it → great disaster due to Noble Phantasm detonation". On the other hand, in the anime was more like "Berserker couldn't react due to Saber's fatal wound → took it wide open and recovered after another One Life Lost" - please think along these lines. Given the circumstances, two of his remaining lives were expended. <br>  I see, so that's is why God Hand in the anime is , restored after 3 days... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ufotable Cafe polls <br><br>You should know those are never to be trusted as they are not a fair demographic representation.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I wish Shirou was more poplar.</br></br></br>  <br>I know she's appeared in several spin offs briefly<br><br>Take Moon, Carnival Phantasm, that other comedy manga.<br><br>Apparently she's gay for that other one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think Sakura will be as popular as rin, considering Rin got her route (Yes, UBW is considered as Rin's route) got a full 25 episode adaptation? Rin was already way popular than sakura prior to that, this just bumps her even higher. Hell, I won't even be surprised if Rin got even more popular in the HF movies.<br><br>Rin beat sakura by almost 2x in the tenth anniversary poll (which is the main poll considering it has the most votes and characters out of all the polls). I'm not saying sakura won't be more popular, but being more popular than Rin will never happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people hate Shirou so much?</br>  <br>Everyone has shit taste</br>  <br>did she always have massive breast</br>  <br> You should know those are never to be trusted as they are not a fair demographic representation. <br><br>I thought we were counting all polls? That anon is talking about the poll were Sakura beats Rin after all.</br></br></br>  <br>But Archer is Shirou.</br>  <br>They can't self insert as him.<br><br>Even still, he's not exactly unpopular, he's just not number 1.</br></br></br>  The Twitter April Fools really showed how much she has grown as she was in 2nd place in terms of followers right behind Saber.  <br>bellyful of halfbreeds</br>  <br>Ufotable Cafe polls are shit for everyone as the Cafes consists of the same customers going in and voting for the same person each week.<br><br>Lancer is #1 in one of them right now and Kirei has been #1 almost the whole time at another.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Shirou is popular.<br><br>He is not Fujoshi popular like Archer, Lancer, Gil, and Kirei but he is still popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a strongly established character, which means he loses the appeal Kirito and Producer have. And he doesn't have as much snark/humor as Archer yet, so he doesn't have the "smug badass" appeal down either.<br><br>Shirou is like a baby badass.</br></br></br>  <br>Give her time on the big screen. Quite literally all that has to be done.</br>  <br>Depends on if Sakura ever gets a proper adaption, before I can make that call. So far she's the only heroine to not get any kind of showing to date or adaption. At best she's just kind of been on the coat tails or unplayed.<br><br>The recent HF manga was her first official adaption of any kind, where she's actually in this as a main.<br><br>We're holding out hopes for the HF movies to be good.<br><br>We might start to see some changes because of this. Its like if you say "Well heroine isn't popular" compared to two other heroines that are advertised more than anything, have been on all the promo art since 06 DEEN, have adaptions, and show up in most things when comparing them to one that has never been advertised or really adapted/shown. For both anime that have come out, Prism, and the offshoots Rin has been always a starring role that's been in almost every episode. That seems a bit one sided as well. So this is something new to explore here.<br><br>Even Nasu calls Rin something like that narrator or Usher of Fate. She literally has more of a showing than any other character in the original story. So she's been advertised always as much as Saber.<br><br>I can say that when the adaption was announced a year back, it did get some major applause and trending, as though people were waiting for this one for awhile. It feels like a new chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou, Rin, Saber and maybe illya will get more screen time than sakura. <br><br>Things aren't looking good for Sakura.</br></br></br>  I wonder when Takeuchi will finally force Nasu to get that proper Fate Adaptation.  <br>The one thing that the HF preview said after UBW ended was that HF was the "Last Episode".<br><br>So never?</br></br></br>  <br>He is busy drawing Saber for F/GO and working on Hisui and Kohaku for Tsukihime to fuel his maid fetish.</br>  <br>Seems to me that they have the best taste. But honestly what makes this poll less accurate than a poll that a very small amount of people voted? You seem pretty biased now.</br>  <br>Maybe CCC was the first of this trend actually, but people do still draw the line that's a different character.<br><br>She is still quite loved there, there's not much to say wrong about her character that you could say about the original.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you played heaven's feel?</br>  <br>You do realize Sakura barely has more screentime than Saber and Kotomine, right?</br>  Clearly robot waifus are the future  <br>Now what exactly is that?</br>    <br> Forcing Sakura onto our self-insert <br><br>Sasuga Nasu</br></br></br>  <br> But honestly what makes this poll less accurate than a poll that a very small amount of people voted? <br><br> Votes based on people that visit the cafe regularly only <br> All the Cafe votes tend to produce the same results each time in each location <br>How is that accurate/fairly represented?<br><br>The TM poll itself at least gives everyone and anyone the chance to vote versus those who go to the cafes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Even during the Heaven's Fall  <br>As you said, Rin (and saber) have appeared in a lot of stuff since 06 DEEN. Hell, Rin is a major contender to win Shirou in the so called "Illya route." Even in the HF movie, Rin plays a huge part, and I'm pretty sure receives even more screen time than Sakura. With all the fans prior to the announcement of the HF movies plus all the secondaries UBW anime brought in who circlejerk Rin like crazy, I don't see a chance of sakura surpassing Rin.</br>   HF will make Sakura surpass Rin <br>That never happens. THAT NEVER HAPPENS. <br>Also, Saber is fucking hopeless. The king of cucks will always sit on first place.</br></br>  <br>She has much more screen time than both of them,</br>  <br> implying they aren't going to shoehorn Saber and illya like crazy in the movies like they did for UBW </br>  <br>Illya a best.</br>  <br>Because if 500 people vote for the same characters over and over it will end with the same shit only inflated numbers.</br>  Hey guys<br>filthy secondary here<br>I want to get more into this series but the more I dig the more I realize this universe is fucking vast and I'm not sure if I have the time/dedication for it<br>So I'd really appreciate it if someone could at least fill me in on these topical memes I see often<br><br>why is sakura a "wormslut"<br>why does rin "pleasure old men for money"<br>thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off and read the VN</br>  <br>Is it wrong for me to want to wait until I have enough time to give it justice, rather than to have to rush through it to grasp a few jokes?</br>  <br> why is sakura a "wormslut" <br><br>Because worms fucked her.Seriously. I really don't know how to explain this without you reading the VN or waiting to watch the movies.<br><br> why does rin "pleasure old men for money" <br><br>It's a meme from a non canon doujin, I'm serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Blossom Sensei<br><br>She's a nurse, she's chaste, she's a certified teacher in charge of that facility, and she has a lab coat.<br><br>She's a potentially immortal AI possibly as old as the Earth itself, rather than being Sakura. She even comments that her name was chosen from random among the contestants this contest. An AI that runs the god machine, but has developed a soul. She must wonder what is more important, her duty as an Administrator, her own heart, and what these new feelings mean. Also pretty dense at times, self sacrificing, and robotic in nature. <br><br>Its like complaining "Oh fuck, here comes Arthuria again in Extra, except now she's wearing Red. That fucking cash cow". Really its someone entirely different who just looks the sameular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So she discards her own heart as her first action, and gets back to being an admin as is her programming since she must fulfill her duty.<br><br>Except something you cast away isn't so quickly lost as that. Even if the mind forgets, the heart won't ever forget.<br><br>You can't get rid of a soul that easily.</br></br></br></br></br>   BB: To think that I would only last a few seconds. Now, Gilgamesh-san, hurry and take this happy person away. <br><br> BB: …Far away, far, far away. Far enough away that my hands can’t reach them. Far enough away that they won’t be able to see either regrets or dreams. <br><br> Gilgamesh: …That wish has certainly reached me. In your final moments, emerge from your cocoon and disappear, butterfly of the moon. Exhaust everything and disappear without regrets. </br></br></br></br>  Remove Sakura and no one would care. Saber and Rin are too important.  After CCC I'm not sure there is a better bro than Gilgamesh out there.<br><br>Its not even the big things with him, rather the small personal conversations you share with him are just great.</br></br>  <br> why is sakura a "wormslut" <br><br>Because she literally fucks worms.</br></br></br>  Why do you people care about polls so much? What mostly influence them are exposure and timing. Sakura is already like well enough among type-moon fans, once she gets an adaption she's going to see a rise in popularity, and the HF manga is probably doing something for her right now. It's quite simple as more people see her more people are going to like her. Do you people think Arc managed to get over double the votes of the next Tsukihime character or Alice made top ten because there was something about them that made them so much more popular than the others? Arc just happened to get two adaptations of her route and Alice's game was just released so she was fotm. Though Arc probably still would've bee more popular than the other heroines you've go to be insane to think such disparities are because something about her character is more likable rather than her being the heroine in more adaptations, as opposed to just being remebered by some people as Koha Ace/The maid that lets Akiha drink blood from her tittties. Or in Sakura's case Sad Loli/Bondage girl.  <br>Her adopted grandfather straps her in a basement where worms eat her for days and days as a form of torture that he calls training.<br><br>This started when she was eight years old, sold by her real father to some creepy vampire from across the street.<br><br>She was abused, but she never broke, she endured much to his own surprise as he was frankly trying to break her or destroy her at times for fun. She became a mopey sort of girl and wasn't unaffected by this at all, but she refused to break at least and let that be all her life meant. Rather she just developed more resistance and a desire that she had to live. People like to sell it their own way, but it was rape as a fact said in the game, it wasn't normal, it wasn't something she ever wanted or needed or even sought out, and it did suck. Even ten years later she says it still sucks, it didn't become pleasurable like a mind break doujinshi. It was just a living hell for her all those years where even two hours there was complete shit.<br><br>Can't go to the cops, they don't get how this magic thing works and any magus worth anything could deal with the police with their eyes closed. The Magus Association would as well help them do it if it meant magic stays secret.<br><br>She always felt trapped, but as she met and lived with MC for awhile, she started to realize she wasn't as trapped as she thought. She started to become more outgoing and stronger in the last year. While she still has to endure that hell, she's starting to change and realize she might not have to put up with it. There's two world lines now where they're able to put a stop to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People want their own views validated in terms of numbers, so they can shit on everyone else who's a lesser number<br><br>So they can feel good about themselves.<br><br>Typically<br><br>That type of thing is seen a lot in life actually</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure Ufo will throw in some extra scenes that either lift her up or absolutely shit on her</br>  <br>Remember her final scene in Zero?</br>  <br>And then she used her problems as an excuse to be a fucking monster.<br><br>Sakura a shit. Don't give a fuck how hard her life was, that's not an excuse to be as bad as the people who hurt you.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Sakura never killed anyone besides for Shinji, Gil, or Zouken.</br>  <br><br>We can stop this now I know both of you won't convince the other that you are right.</br></br>  <br>We've got 350 posts left till the bump limit, plenty of time for a senseless argument.<br><br><br>Reminder that sakura is being told that she is evil by a man who is a canon evil dick and has everything to gain from sakura convincing herself that she's evil.<br><br>Additional reminder that the narrator in this scene is also Kirei.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea how the nips actually like Sakura more than Ilya; or Saber more than Rin for that matter.</br>  <br>When has Kirei ever once outright told a lie?</br>  <br>Saber is an ideal foreign beauty. Tiny, submissive, but willing to protect you, while also being exotic looking.</br>  <br>Yes, a canon evil dick. An incredibly smart canon evil dick that's literally never been wrong about a single character in the series up to this point when he tries to psychoanalyze them or fuck with them.<br><br>"This is the only time Kotomine was wrong" is a pretty poor argument. Also, no, he was not the narrator. If he was, it would read "I'm absolutely right" and "glares back at me".<br><br>Sakurafags just hate the fact that she became a monster and genuinely wants to make others suffer. She went out of her way to try to kill Shirou and Rider, the two people who were unshakably on her side, while in full control of herself. She also tried to kill Rin. And you can argue that's less bad because Rin wasn't exactly being friendly in that scene, but up to that point she'd only been trying to help Sakura, and was totally full of shit threatening to kill her.<br><br>Sakura tried to kill everyone that loved her and cared about her while they were trying to help her while she was in complete control of her actions. Fact. And it's fucking irredeemable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because Kirei is correct, doesn't mean he's right.</br>  <br>You say that like Kirei has ever been wrong, or lied about how someone's fucked up.<br><br>He analyzes people and shoves their genuine faults that they hate right in their faces then laughs about it.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't thinking clearly. It is impossible to think clearly when you're that blackened unless you are a mesopotamian douchebag. It is absolutely redeemable, just ask the sword-man.<br><br>Remember, Sakura was trying to get back at the world that had done nothing but shit on her for 10 years. She felt betrayed. <br><br>Also, she did not go out of her way to try and kill Shirou and Rider, she explicitly went out of her way to avoid it. Saber was a guard. She was guarding the cave. If she wanted Shirou and Rider dead, she would have killed them. <br><br>Sakura felt betrayed. The world had done nothing but shit on her for a very long time, and when she learned that the only thing she truly had in common with Shirou, the bar jump, was witnessed also by Rin, she starts to see her apparently uncaring sister as an enemy. When you couple feelings of betrayal and an in the midst of an anthrosemitic fit, yes, you might try to kill someone who you might not.<br><br>If you can call "Telling the watchdog to let Rin walk by" trying to kill her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there a bigger meme character than Matou Sakura?  <br> Also, she did not go out of her way to try and kill Shirou and Rider <br>You're right. She only attacked them at the house and only tried to kill them a little bit. That's fine, right? No big deal. Other than that, she never tried to kill them. She just put murder machines in between her and those she knew were coming after her.<br><br>And she was genuinely trying to murder Tohsaka when the two fought. Keep telling yourself she didn't try to kill everyone around her, because that is factually incorrect if you were paying any attention.<br> Sakura felt betrayed <br>Boo fucking hoo. Not an excuse for anything she did.<br><br>And that's the Sakurafag argument for everything: she's a suffering rape victim, so suffering she instills or tries to instill is totally fine. I notice that all Sakurafags are also massive whiteknightfags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I notice that all Sakurafags are also massive whiteknightfags. <br>Welcome to the point of Fate/Stay Night.<br><br>What's wrong with her being emotional? She has every right to be emotional after what she's been through. She didn't force anyone to come after her. Shirou and Rider wanted to stop her, so Sakura had Saber intercept them. Rin showed up, and Sakura wasn't making Rin come to her, but Sakura just wanted to make the world burn for the suffering it piled on her, and when your sister, your main rival for the possession of the only ray of light in the miserable existence of your life, comes to stop you, I don't think she's that bad when she tried to kill her. <br><br>Also, notice how her desire to murder everyone disappears after Shirou fakes his way out of the situation?<br><br>Everything about her is totally fucking fine once Shirou uses rule breaker. She's not evil before mad sheeny dude, and she's not evil after the furious hebrew is dispelled. <br>I don't think you can hate an emotional person in an emotional situation for acting emotionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You write like a massive prick, Not even a Sakurafag, you're just annoying.</br>  <br>Welcome to 4chan?</br>  <br>I didn't realize being really emotional and acting really emotional was a legal defense for any crimes.<br><br>So really, it's 100% Sakurafags whiteknighting because she had a hard time. She was emotional, had a hard life, etc, so she's excused from her actions.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you read the other parts of my post?</br>  <br>I did. You just pointed out how she was reacting emotionally to everything. And no shit everything's fine after RB, everyone totally brushed off everything she did and accepted her back into the "family". Why they did that I have no idea. Shirou says something about how she has to live to atone, but that's it.</br>  <br> Why they did that I have no idea. <br>Because Shirou chose to prioritize her over everyone else, regardless of whatever.</br></br>  <br>Seriously, why ufotable. That's a little young to start identifying with her captors</br>  <br>I said "they", not "Shirou". Didn't miss Shirou's entire character arc.</br>    <br>Rin did because Sakura's her imouto. She too couldn't do what needed to be done.</br>  <br>Where did the meme of "Kirei never lies, just twists the truth" come from?</br>  <br><br>remove worms</br></br>  She's not pure so she'll never be popular with Otaku.  <br>BABY</br>  I am the bone of my missile<br>Steel my body and jet fuel my blood<br>I have created over a thousand JETS<br>Have fired over a thousand missiles<br>yet jet fuel will never melt steel beams<br>So as I pray, UNLIMITED JET WORKS.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No matter what, will be ALWAYS better than Rin</br>  <br>What will always be better than Rin? Nothing?</br>  Zouken should had bought the older sister instead of the younger one.  <br>Me</br>  <br><br>She already did in the mobile poll, deal with it.</br></br>    <br>In all honesty I think Tokiomi should've been all. "Hey Edelfeldts, sorry my dad absconded with your girl and pillaged your Crest. Take my daughter?"<br><br>Double Luvia</br></br></br>  <br>Rin already had a hard life even without getting tormented by her second cousin and sister-turned-into-second cousin.</br>  <br>She deserves it.</br>  <br>Deworming</br>  <br>The Matous adopted Rin instead of Sakura.<br><br>How different is the story of FSN?</br></br></br>  <br> This autism wall </br>  <br>Shinji ends up a better person.</br>  <br>Rin would've ended the same way as Sakura.<br><br>Probably.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably just about the same</br>  <br>Shinji would probably end up being a pseudo-hero(ine) that needs to be saved from being vitiated by Rin.</br>  <br> Rin fucks anything that moves <br> Shinji and Rider are her cumdumpsters  <br> rapes Ayako of course <br> natural born prostitute  <br> still mesmerized by damn high bar jump </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate route probably would be identical.<br>UBW route would be more less same, just with more significant romantic line as Tohsaka Sakura would be probably more sweet hearted girl than Rin.<br>HF route would becomes a total horror story with villain heroine. And ending would have been much more dramatic as Matou Rin would be more psychotic and unstable than Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br> Matou Rin would be more psychotic and unstable than Sakura <br><br>Any particular reason why?</br></br></br>  <br>If she's gonna be more assertive than Shinji, she'll be the one reigning in Rider.<br><br>Well she gets splatted by Berserker in Fate<br>Gets a heart transplant with Dr.Gil in UBW<br>HF really damn questionable though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck that's a Bollywood actor everyone here in curryland make fun of.</br>    <br>Rin has a stronger character than Sakura, but on the other hand she is surprisingly emotionally more fragile than Sakura. You can see that many times in Game. Now just imagine what could happen with her character if it was she who was wormraped from childhood.</br>  <br> If she's gonna be more assertive than Shinji, she'll be the one reigning in Rider. <br>This is very possible.</br></br>  Since there's a Sakura-Rin switch, why not make the war more confusing<br><br>Sakura Tohsaka<br>Rin Matou<br>Kotomine Shirou (not Marik)<br>Illya Emiya, <br>Issei is the one who saved Caster's ass<br>Bazette didn't died that day,rather Kirei got fisted</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>If you want see glimpse of "Matou Rin" personality then you read Rin's eclipse in Hollow Ataraxia. Here at nearly end Rin for a moment becomes completely mindbroken from all pleasure and even develop Sakura-like dull eyes. This is how "Matou Rin" would be if you get on her Dere side.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Underrated post.</br>  <br>this whole scene is so much better than her usual self.</br>  <br><br>Well, they are sisters by blood.<br>Ironically, the Rin mistakenly thought the future dere Rin was Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br> Kotomine Shirou <br>In this situation is he adopted by Kirei or is he Kirei's son? Either way the heir to the Tohsaka family, in this case I guess it'd be Sakura, growing up with Shiroutomine would be fun.</br></br>  <br>Here it's nice to see a difference. Normal Rin at beginning of Eclipse directly prohibits Shirou from coming inside her. Mindbroken Rin on the contrary legslock him with the intention of forcing him to impregnate her.</br>  More &gt;everyday until you like it.<br><br>More redirecting anons to the VN, and not the anime.<br>The more anons that actually finish the VN, the more popular she will become.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Sakura the most aesthetic fate character?</br>  <br>It's quite ironic that Hollow Ataraxia moreless confirms that both sisters will switch their personalities in future. <br>Even Shirou notices during story that Sakura is slowly turning into "second Tohsaka". And we all know what Rin's future is.</br></br>  <br><br>Sakura tends to be more understanding and patient than Rin, so without the breaking, I would think HF would actually end much sooner and happier. Sakura was the one out of the two that tried the hardest to bury the hatchet before shit went down. They would have a seriously heated talk yes, and maybe a spell or two would fly, but it would end after that. <br><br>Maybe even sooner. Since Sakura is the type that would probably disobey Tokiomi's orders to be with Rin. Not stalking, but actually hanging out with. Rin would stubbornly deny and evade, but contrary to what is normally thought about Sakura, she is good at cutting through bullshit in a diplomatic, non-confrontational way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nah</br>  <br>Pleasing old men and filled with worms. And its her endgame, so no one will save her then.</br>  <br><br> I would think HF would actually end much sooner and happier. <br> but it would end after that. <br>No, I can imagine how Rin will rejecting any help from Sakura.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It'd less a personality switch and more a shift. Sakura becomes more forceful as she matures (dealing with Shinji in boot camp fashion, captaining the archery club well, and generally demanding more), while keeping her empathetic patient nature, which unabashedly loves.<br><br>Rin generally becomes less (LESS) confrontational and more accepting(understands that a firm hand isn't what will fix Shirou, but patience, understanding, and active love). But still keeps her mischeviousness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like BB better not because of the chaste virgin shit, she could be a slut and I wouldn't give a fuck (everyone in Extra is slutty). It's the long hair, pupil eyes, fun personality and the outfit. <br><br>Sakura has a nice design but her personality and clothes are kind of boring. Dark Sakura aspect is better.</br></br></br>  <br><br> The cafe polls is based on what things are sold. Rin got more new merch that week, so her stuff sold more...<br><br>When it was Kotomine birthday and he got special bullshit merch, he ranked number one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Shirou still be the love interest in this scenario? I'm imagining a gloomy shota Shirou after being adopted by Kirei that doesn't talk or leave the church much and is mildly sadistic. Sakura would probably be more or less the same worrying for the depress looking kid that Kirei brought back, and be the only person Shirou interacts with other than Kirei. Matou Rin would be a really scary looking girl that people at school avoid, but is actually really sweet. She sometimes visits the church and that's how she meets Shirou.</br>  <br>So basically, Sakura is mature and Rin is childish?</br>  <br>"Sakura" has more in common with Saber and Arc, as per main heroine of Fate/Extra franchise. It's the whole "I'm an emotionless superpowerful being who must fulfill a duty but what is this thing called love?" that Nasu uses yet again.</br>  <br>We could keep doing this and have even more Cross-household characters.</br>      <br>Kotomine Sakura would be fantastic.</br>  <br><br>A bit of irony is that Nasu says in Shinji's bio that if Sakura didn't care and treated him like garbage, he would level out.<br><br>That is kind of terrible that you would need to treat someone like trash for them to improve. Or rather, pathetic.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Kotomine Sakura gives me Kiara vibes.</br>  <br>Shinji is fine the way he is.</br>  <br><br>How much better would Sakura's life have been if Kiritsugu adopted both her and Shirou?</br></br>  <br>If Kiritsugu did that I feel like it would have been aweful for Shirou. He wouldn't have learned how to cook because Sakura would do all the cooking.<br>A Shirou that can't cook? Please no.</br></br>  <br>Anything would've been better than being adopted by the Matou.</br>  <br><br>No matter what, the Japanese want the sisters to fuck.<br><br>They even had to loli shimai make out for a gum ad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the case that they would both be save from The Fire, Sakura would've already been at the Matou house for a year but It would be before the crest worm was implanted in her so the only real problem she would have is her smile and optimism being gone. <br>Shirou would basically go around protecting Sakura because of his desire to be a hero, and She'd probably follow him around closely all of the time then grow-up to be extremely attached to her new brother. Or maybe Shriou gets a side kick?<br><br>Short answer, cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br> make out for a gum ad <br>wait, what?</br></br>  <br> He wouldn't have learned how to cook because Sakura would do all the cooking. <br> implying it wouldn't be filled with them trying to do work together around the house with childish shenanigans <br>Using each other to reach high places, carrying heavy pots together, being used by Taiga onee-san as personal snack bearers.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't have the pic with me, but for a parody of a gum ad, loli Sakura and Rin locked lips. It was done with Zero characters.</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, I found it.</br>  <br>Is that tongue or are they sharing gum?</br>  I'll never get why Saber is so overwhelmingly popular.  <br> first heroine <br> fate anime <br> manga <br> F/Z <br> in a shit ton of spin-offs <br> blonde foreigner </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a gum to me.</br>  <br>Makes me wonder if her popularity will ever really go down. She wasn't particularly given muc special treatment in UBW (they dodged all her flag scenes), and Prisma doesn't really give her any love. Next up is HF, and she out for like, half the story.</br>    <br><br> No grail installed inside her <br> Blackened <br><br>She would still have excellent anti-spirit stuff, especially since Imaginary Element won't be reduced by Matou experiments, but being blackened without the grail shards is impossible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retcon the fact that she's a slut fueled by sex in her route.<br><br>While you're at it, retcon the fact that she regularly bathes in a pool of dick-shaped worms every day of her life.</br></br></br>  <br>Kid Sakura and Shirou adventures are a-ok with me.</br>  <br><br>She doesn't need any of that.<br><br>She's the best looking heroine (I don't care about her but her design is better than generic twin tails which is know pretty common and Sakura's design which is bland outside of her edgy phase) and her popularity doesn't rely on Shirou romance. Lancer and Gilgamesh are more popular pairings for Saber, actually. <br><br>She's the main Servant, the poster child, the face of Fate franchise in general. She transcends her heroine role as the actual center of the franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd pay to see Kotomine Sakura taking on huge village of vampires, or DAAs</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but all the things coming out lately have her not exactly being the poster child. UBW gave her a slice of the pie, but Rin, Shirou, and Archer ended up being shown off more, at least on official stuff.<br><br>Prisma doesn't do anything for her, and outside of Alter, which comes pretty late in ther route, there's not much to push with her in HF.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And blonde, green eyes swordswomen with top buns is somehow uncommon? There are literal thousands of the same character design that Saber has, her armor is the thing that stands out.<br><br>All three heroine's are iconic due to the sheer popularity of the franchise. Sakura's regular form gets as much fanart as her darkened form for instance (regardless of how silly people are saying she is unpopular). Really, she gets tons of additional designs in canon.<br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kotomine Shirou <br> Kotomine Sakura <br> Karen Ortensia <br>Why isn't there a spin off with these as a group of church executioners?</br></br></br>  <br> her armor is the thing that stands out. <br><br>And her suit, you forget that Zero was far more popular than UBW in Japan. Suit Saber has a more distinctive look and charisma than Rin or Sakura could never meet or dream about.<br><br>She's more fashioned to be liked by mostly everyone. While Rin and Sakura are more niche.<br><br><br>She's still the poster child in UBW. Rin's just a love interest. Shirou and Archer are the mc/main antagonist, but Saber is as usual the star. Nasu asked ufotable to make her the most stunning character visually.<br><br> Prisma <br> relevant <br><br>It's just an unpopular spinoff for lolicons without any relevance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the thing is Saber just feels like Fate stay night, if that makes any sense. She's a servant, heroine, unique amour design, and the "are you my master?" contract scene is probably the most iconic moment in the series (It's also apart of every route). Sakura is definitely my favorite heroine, but everything about Saber's image fits F/SN.</br>  <br> She's still the poster child in UBW. <br> Saber is as usual the star. <br>Literally what</br></br></br>  <br>Huh?<br><br>Nasu went and said he couldn't conceive the existence of Fate without Saber. Rin, Sakura and Illya are extra load which have some screentime but Saber is and always was the point of the franchise. This began with Saiba as male and continues as female, that's why every single spin off has either a cameo or a fucking clone. Did you even miss the Alt ServantxMaster pairs which features Arturia twice, Mordred (her actual clone) and Arthur? Half of the roster.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, most of the literal posters for UBW either had Shirou and Archer up front, Rin, or Rin and Saber. Especially in the second season.<br><br>Like, they did stuff for Saber, but she was not the poster child for UBW.</br></br></br>  <br>Check out Newtype polls. Rin never beats Saber. She's got far more development than Rin did too whose development was "I thirst for Shirou's Dick more" and she's completely irrelevant. UBW Anime Rin is pretty shitty. While Saber got expanded, fuck she even got Garden of Avalon in BD 1.</br>  <br> Check out Newtype polls. <br>Irrelevant to the point you're trying to make.<br><br> She's got far more development than Rin did  <br>How? She barely had any screentime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy, we doing the meme now where Rin didn't get development in UBW?<br><br>Rin's development revolved around her interactions with Shirou and Archer. Through watching them, and getting to know them, she sees there are different, but equally acceptable paths to being a magus. It's much the same arc she got in HF, but revolving around Shirou rather than Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br>to not be shirou's bitch and be a strong independent WOman</br>  <br> Irrelevant to the point you're trying to make. <br><br>It is. She's the star. The Minmay.<br><br> How? She barely had any screentime. <br><br>You should actually re-watch, last episode kind of rooted your brain. Anime Saber development started in Zero, which UBW anime is a sequel of. She got a complete arc.<br><br>Rin got zero besides becoming weak love interest. You pretend to split the characters, but anime watchers think Zero and then UBW. Saber is the star while Emiya bullshit are the protagonists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Saberfags   <br> Lancerfags </br>  <br> Rin's development revolved around her interactions with Shirou and Archer. <br><br> Rin did too whose development was "I thirst for Shirou's Dick more" <br><br>My point exactly, she existed only to be dicked by Shirou (in a metaphorical way), and nothing else. While Saber was a king grieving and destroying herself, who after her breakdown in Zero, finally got to fulfill her promise to do a honorable duel with a pretty Servant, protect her Masters and destroy the Grail in a way she has no regrets. Anime Saber has a storyarc that revolves around her issues, even if Shirou and Archer help her by projection, it's always about herself. <br><br>Rin is an accessory who doesn't exist beside her role as love Interest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can anyone tell me the name of the "CG" Idelm@ster? I wanted to get into it for a while and that sounds promising.</br>  <br>Jesus, you're talking out of your ass, buddy. All of Saber's development was already in the UBW route in the VN itself. There was no grand connection made between Zero and UBW in the anime. Do you think Saber watched Shirou's fight with Archer for shits and giggles? It was an important moment because she saw parallels between Shirou and herself.<br><br>Rin does get development as well.. She has multiple scenes where she takes issue with her Shirou learned to be a magi, and with Kerry's teachings, but as she gets to know Shirou, find out more about his character, she grows more empathetic to other types of mindsets.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a raging Saberfag, but you're totally ignorant to the fact that all this shit was already in the VN. </br>  <br>rin is a girl!,people die when they are kills !</br>  <br> Rin is an accessory who doesn't exist beside her role as love Interest. <br>You're trying too hard.</br></br>   thinking about Saber's popularity ever waning <br><br>Rin's time is nearly up, though. Even as the main heroine of UBW and her role in Prisma, she didn't get any real strong reaction from the nips. She fell behind Sakura and Nero in Type Moon twitter, with all her exposure, kind of pathetic.<br><br>She also was always behind Saber one, two or more places in Newtype and other magazine polls.<br><br>Japan is a little tired of tsundere characters. It's Sakura whose popularity is increasing (Saber's always been popular) over the years. Not even Zero adaptation which made her a cunt damaged her rise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's funny is that Shirou never actually talks shit about Rin. Like, he questions King Arthur, but the high school girl has totally got this in the bag.</br>  <br>Because Shirou loves Saber and wants to protect her (he'll do the same for Sakura and Taiga). He doesn't care if Rin dies.</br>  <br> Saber ranks number 2 consistently in Newtype <br> Her popularity is waning <br><br>She's the fourth most popular character in Prisma, too. In a show about lolis, she beats out a couple of lolis.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Prisma poll <br> she ranks after fucking MIYU AND KURO <br><br>I bet if Saber Alter were there, she would be more popular than Rin. Rin's kind of obnoxious right now. 2ch called her the red cockroach through UBW airing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uro: It isn't a relationship fueled by instinct like the relationship between a man and a woman, but a romance of logic between two people who need each other from the heart. I think the Saber route could have been told as a story through the ancient Greek views on love. That's what makes Saber's story so refreshing, and why she's become such a popular character. On the other hand, I think the true heroine of Fate/stay night is Rin. In the Rin route, an equal relationship with a woman who's become stronger than men is depicted. Rin and Shirou mend each other's weaknesses with their own unique strengths, and I think it makes for a very nice relationship. <br><br>Nah, there's actually a point made about how Shirou and Rin have this balanced sort of relationship going on.</br></br></br>   no caster route <br>largest crime of Fate</br>  <br> Ranks after the main characters <br><br>Yeah? Rin is a technically a side character in Prisma, but she is the most popular side character.</br></br></br>    <br>She's already popular enough. Didn't her tmitter account have more followers than Rin's on April Fools day?</br>  <br> on April Fools day </br>  <br>Well a Caster route is the closest thing to a MILF route.<br>Remember Seiba's a DILF</br></br>  <br>Uro's the one who said Saber and Shirou relationship couldn't be like a man's and a woman's because Shirou respects Saber...and how Sakura was romance.<br><br>I wouldn't really take his word about love relationships, he admits he's shit at them.</br></br></br>  Post obscure Fate spin-offs you'd probably enjoy<br><br>Fate/Shopping District<br> Rider trying to deal with difficult customers a her part time job <br><br> Lancer trying to coax woman to come to what ever part time job he's working at <br><br> Sakura and Shirou buying provisions for everyone staring at the Emiya residence <br><br> Shop keepers giving Illya free food and gift when she comes to play <br><br> Sakura teaching caster the way of the kitchen and them going to sales together <br> Caster uses magic to put all of the other customers to sleep <br> Sakura uses pocket dimension to take them isle to isle, and to the front of crowded kiosks </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A Shinji road could have been pretty fun</br>  <br>Archer teaching Sakura and Caster how to be a good housewife</br>  <br> Caster fucks with Shirou the entire route in order to strengthen his circuits <br> he ends up as a top-tier battle mage <br> projects rule breaker as a homing arrow and gets all servants in the war for himself <br> forms a justice squad and steamrolls evil all around the planet </br></br></br></br>  <br>And? She's fucking Rin. If she falls behind pathetic loli ocs is because she's eclipsed. She used to rank THIRD in the oldest prisma poll and one of those lolis was behind her.<br><br>She's losing her shine. She lost to Archer too when she used to rank before him in the general type moon poll of 2012. Her vote count dropped considerably while Saber's maintained hers and Sakura's increased.<br><br>Sakura's the heroine in the rise, while Rin's declining even with all her exposure. They are still popular, but Rin used to be way more popular and she needs a lot of exposure to actually keep people interested. Saber doesn't need that. She's automatically popular by existing.<br><br>It's like Rin's a passing flight of fancy while Saber's popularity is enduring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Freedom descending to Earth and kick everyone ass.

The only thing the anime did was actually show the scene where Saber uses the finishing blow she only prepared in the VN. Seriously, for a fanbase so adamant on getting people to read the VN, most of the fans clearly just don't remember it.

She's popular.<br><br> In my heart. </br></br>  Sakura does do bad things, and I can see why people would dislike or perhaps even hate her for them. I suppose the more appropriate word would be "excessive" or "continuous" or the like.<br><br>Sakura having a terrible life does not give her the right to be terrible to others, that is for certain. However, when one considers just how broken Sakura is based on her upbringing, I can understand why she'd come to the point where she'd be capable of doing bad things to others. I mean, I won't go too deep into spoilers, but man, her life was shit. You don't come out of that upbringing as a cool and level-headed individual. Shinji was broken by his upbringing under Zouken Matou as well, and Shinji didn't go through what Sakura went through. Zouken, as it turns out, is a bad parental figure.<br><br>In any case, what comes to mind is that line from Oregairu - the one that I think Hayama says to Hachiman. "You help others because you want someone else to help you" or something like that. I don't remember the words, but that's the sentiment. I do find myself sympathizing with certain characters who do bad things, like Sakura, perhaps because I know that I've hardly been a perfect individual throughout my life. I mean, I'm not saying that I've done things to the same degree of what Sakura is capable of doing (some of those HF bad endings are properly scary), but you get the point. Sakura isn't perfect. She isn't rational. But I still find myself liking her in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's ok, senpai.</br>  <br>I think I'm going to be sick.  Gross </br>  <br> 4. Sakura Matou <br> 7.

I never watched the full DEEN serie, though I already saw Caster made Bondage hostage of Sakura, but what the hell is happening here ?</br>    <br>I actually hated her way less in UBW than beck when I read FSN. I think it's because her VA got better and sounds less annoying now. It still would be nice if she stopped with the constant "senpai", it's still grating on my ears.</br>  <br><br>mfw I used it few times <br>;_;</br></br></br>    <br>How about not killing people?</br>    <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/yqukgpiyyq.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>What's going on with this illegal distribution of Sakuras?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>S-Senpai!</br>   ohayo   <br>  It still would be nice if she stopped with the constant "senpai", it's still grating on my ears. <br><br>This. <br>I really like Sakura the best out of the 3 original main heroines but if there is one thing i really dislike about her its the whole senpai thing.

Tohsaka Scrooge is taught the the meaning of Christmas by the three servants of Christmas. Saber, the spirit of Christmas past, shows Tohsaka the first Christmas she received a magic book from her father and the joy she felt from the sentiment of first learning magic with her father. <br><br> Baka humbug, that book was valuable I could've bought a years worth of gems with that.  <br><br>Archer, the spirit of Christmas present, shows Rin arriving at the Emiya Residence with out a gift to exchange with anyone. Sakura, Shirou, Ayako, and all of their friends an family don't mind and are still happy to give her gifts and spent the holiday together. Though, Archer brings Rin to her room to see her self planning to pawn the hand made gifts and the gifts people spent their time working hard to pay for, but before that he take the opportunity to write drown in you ideals and die on Shirou's Christmas card.<br><br>  Rin those gift are filled with all of your friend feeling, you should cherish them. <br> Bah humbug, If they give the gifts to me I should be able to sell them if I want <br><br>Finally Rider, the spirit of Christmas Future. shows Tohsaka the grim future that awaits her. Rider brings her to an empty mansion on a snowy day. This is Rin's very own house, but none of her possessions are inside. An elderly Sakura and Shirou hobble up through the Tohsaka mansion and being to clear out all of the collecting dust.<br><br> Nee-san's house is really lonely these day, isn't it senpai? <br> Yeah she really is gone. <br><br>Shirou tries to console the weeping Sakura, and sheds a tear while they embrace, thinking about the since departed Rin. Rin tries call out to them, but she's only a spirit. She asks Rider to bring her to her future self.

Rin wakes up from the nightmare in her special bed made out of money. She cuts it open, takes out 30% of the contents, puts on her Archer Santa clause outfit, and take off in the direction of Shirou's house. She gets to the party and begins to throw money around. She looks like a mad woman to Issei, but everyone hd been drinking and enjoys the festivities.

Thanks so much, it's really cute and a great way to start the weekend!</br>  <br>We do request less lewds in the WWD than in the regular drawthread, but nothing on the post itself hints to it being a haremfag, some sort of shitposter or anything but a person requesting his waifu.

The lines don't match up and he probably can't recreate Boa's linework.</br>  <br>So I don't get why it was deleted...</br>  <br><br>Here are the 8 I'm working on. I haven't had much time to work on them since Monday but they are all still in progress.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not much different than a simple semi-lewd request; if an artist who wants to pick mine up and draw her with her boobs busting out, that'd be fine, too. If push comes to shove, I'll just ask for a commission.</br></br>  <br>You're doing God's work Tamabro</br>  <br>Man, I love the thread police tho</br>  <br>I dont think people would take issue with this if you werent spamming the request in the general during the week and just so happened to appear here now. It looks like you are requesting here simply because it is more active as opposed to that actually being you're waifu.</br>  <br> Here are the 8 I'm working on. <br> 8 <br>Holy shit, dude.</br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br> __? </br>  <br>kek, nice stuff boa</br>  <br>no wip because don't want to open photoshop</br>  <br>Really cute. I like it a lot. Not OR.</br>  <br>Well, that is party true, as I thought it'd make sense to post in two threads at the same time for that reason, I admit it. I only requested this in the regular drawthread once yesterday, and I'll probably post in there once more before I give it a break. I have no intention of spamming it in both threads; once again, I'll go ahead and commission it somewhere else if nobody's picking it up, I have absolutely no problem with that. I'm just like most of the requesters here and don't want to start any drama regarding what makes "lewd" art.</br>  <br>Not sure if cute or scary, but good job</br>  <br>That's kawaii shit</br>  <br>No, you thought it would make sense to request it here because people actually draw in these threads.</br>  <br> this ain't candy </br>  <br>Again, partly true, but with threads like these, it comes down to trial and error and dumb luck depending on the request. I don't want to start any more beef, alright? If it's not done here, I'll fuck off myself without devolving this into a flame war. Simple as that.</br>  <br> 8 <br> a lot </br></br>  <br>How many are you working on</br>  Requesting riko taking a bubble bath  <br>When did she dress like Powergirl?</br>  <br>Roughly 40 in a queue.<br>3 are complete.</br></br>  <br>Just needs a black bar.</br>  <br>Why would anyone assume I'm anywhere near doom?</br>  <br>I see you've been the the /i/ thread too.</br>  <br>It's a new project.

It all looks wonderful.  You didn't draw her scars though.  I ended up coloring it myself.  And added little sharks on the sheets and if you ever want to color it yourself I'd like to see how it ends up. <br>Also thank you orz for adding my Hanako to that collage, all the waifus looks so cute in it and  especially Hanako  and the heart shape is a great touch.<br><br>As for this weekend, I would like to request my dear Hanako as Cure Scarlet doing mahou shoujo things, but anything else would be lovely as well.

Again. For the 5th time in a row. The god damned circle is driving all the drawfags away and they refuse to draw my waifu. I fucking hate the circle, I hate drawfags, I hate this shitty thread.  Requesting my dear husbando Kakyoin Noriaki! I'd love to see more of him wearing the fabulous rings and other accessories that were featured in last month's issue of Animage Magazine, something like these pictures http://i.imgur.com/6Run00f.jpg with him sitting on a throne while showing them off would be fantastic. You can even add a crown, since he's a Leo and it might fit with the whole picture. But anything of him as long as he looks happy or cool is perfectly fine. Thank you if you consider drawing him, have a great weekend everyone!<br><br><br> Ionbro, sorry it's not a delivery. but I wanted to thank you for the great colouring of 34's lineart you posted last week, sorry I wasn't around to thank you in time. Your colouring is stunning, even higanbana looks very pretty, the way you colour flowers is great. I love it, thank you so much for taking your time to colour them all, SPW and DIO look good too! Anyway, sorry once again and I hope he gets drawn! Ion wasn't my fav ToA but your husbando is a cute and he definitely didn't deserve all that suffering. Good luck! </br></br></br>  <br>Who is she? And would you accept I kinda shitty delivery?</br>  <br>Damn that's nice.</br>  <br>Why would "da circle" drive away drawfags?</br>  <br>What is this "circle"?</br>  <br><br>Don't respond people, it's a shitpost.</br></br>  <br>its not fucking fair</br>  <br> literally draw random waifus <br> still get blamed on the circle <br>whatever I hate you guys too.</br></br></br>  <br> The god damned circle is driving all the drawfags away <br>This, I had to stop being a drawfag because they shitposted me so much.<br>I'm only here to request my waifu now.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks! I had a lot of fun coloring his hair, I love that dusty pink/salmon color, I'm really glad you like it!<br> All the ToAs are so good, it's hard to pick a favorite, or a 2nd favorite in my case. Ion just needs more lines, but thanks! He definitely didn't. <br><br>And now for Rukako and Ryuuji. I'm naming the files now, since I'm starting to enter unknown character territory.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 5th week in a row <br>Some waifus have it harder you bitchboy.</br></br>  <br>How do you know it was them?</br>  <br> Adding feet to a drawing <br>I know what I'm requesting next week</br></br>  <br> I feel pretty <br> Oh so pretty <br> I feel pretty and witty and gay </br></br></br>  Tfw no waifus with lewd tongues  <br>Nfff</br>  <br>I don't want to look like a begging retard so I won't say her name. I'm sure I'll get shitposted by the circle fucks if I do anyway.</br>  <br>They won't draw her anyway, so you might as well turn to us shitty drawfags and win our favor.</br>  <br><br><br>Finishing this one.<br><br>https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=Blazh</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Morning all!

I missed you, this is really cute.</br>  <br>Too hyped for EVO to even care about this delivery.</br>  <br> All this bitterness </br>  <br>I was wracking my brains over making my request this week EVO related.<br><br> No Morrigan cosplay for me </br></br></br>  <br>this is great.<br>you are great.<br>I hope yuunabro enjoys this.</br></br></br>  <br>Welp, my confidence in my drawing ability has be crushed for the day,</br>  <br> kike <br><br>The Circle must be behind this!</br></br></br>  <br>Oh man that's too cute.</br>  <br>i am dead</br>  <br>I feel the same as you, I think I might do it next thread.</br>  <br>OR here thank you! Looks great, have a nice weekend</br>  <br>Yuunafag is not a drawfag. But he does hang out in the streams.</br>  <br>The Circle doesn't exist, they said.<br>Waifus are usually chosen at random, they said.<br>People who truly love her get deliveries, they said.<br>She'll be drawn, they said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't he do pixels?</br>  <br>Still on the fence about mine but if she isn't drawn before the UMvC3 hype starts, I just might</br>  <br> your delivery will never pass one reply </br>  <br>who cares if it's not your waifu, just request your favorite character like everyone else on these threads</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Oh fuck yeah, I forgot.</br>  <br>Has he done anything recently?</br>  <br>Long time no see, juralumin. Great stuff as always!</br>  Its the beginning of friday and you guys already sound defeated. Have some resilience, you already know who usually gets drawn first. it's nothing new.  <br>Jura~ You're a shitposter now, congrats<br> can I throw money at you yet? </br></br>  <br>You're implying a lot of things that probably aren't true. Stop shitposting.</br>   What do you guys do when you run out of good ideas for requests? Were do you get inspiration?   <br> UMVC3 hype <br>My nigga. It's what I'm looking forward to. Always the hypest and most fun for me. Looking forward to GG and SF Finals though too. <br><br>Wish I could make a good MVC3 related request, but I've got nothing so a simple "Playing Fightan with an Arcade stick" will have to be my request.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh, no, those are all true.</br>  <br>I never run out of requests.</br>  Requesting one of three things for Fujibayashi Ryou:<br><br> As a cute operator doing cute operator things; outfit reference: http://imgur.com/a/et72E#0 <br><br> freestyling like Ayumu Maihama, in pictured clothing http://imgur.com/sCiHDk6 <br><br> dressed like the Medic from Team Fortress 2 wearing the Physician's Procedure Mask and either the Geisha Boy or Surgeon's Stalheim <br>Medic: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/<wbr>Medic<br>Items: http://imgur.com/a/xsVVn<br><br>Have a good weekend!</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Draw for someone in the circle, preferably am avatarfag, and let the dick sucking do itself.</br>  <br>Read other requests.<br>Look at other deliveries.<br> Remove some clothes. <br><br>Or I just request general cute shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get all my inspiration from her source material. Maybe something related to her hobby or what she does?</br>  <br>Hey Ryoufag, did you ever try drawing? Just curious.</br>  <br>Browse my favorites on danbooru/pixiv, check some pools on the booru and be jelly of other waifufag's creativity because all my requests are boring.</br>  <br>Commentating with some headphones or a personalized fightstick with her might be pretty cool<br> Who do you want to take home the UMvC3 gold? JWong is still my hero but I want Moons or Rayray to make it Top 8. My request is Morrigan related but fuck Chrisg </br></br>  <br/>  In case you ever had doubts that it's the circle purposefully stirring up shit.  <br>Holy fuck just kill yourself already<br> circle circle circle cluckcluckcluck circle <br><br>Either start drawing yourelf or stop complain after every god damn delivery that is not yours.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I tried to draw my waifu once or twice, but I can't recall ever posting it here, if that's what you mean.</br>  <br><br> UMVC hype <br>niggas please<br>Though the whole 3 player team idea that sprung around here is a good start to that.<br> all my bison bucks on JWong </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm still on the Wong bandwagon, man. Especially after last year with his clutch. I mean, I really don't care who wins, to be honest. So long as it's hype as all fuck and an enjoyable ride I'll be happy.</br>  <br>Did you have fun with it?</br>  Requesting Futayo Honda wearing a simple wedding dress.<br><br>I'm fine with anything as usual, thanks!<br><br> and sorry for posting a gijinka delivery of my fave LoM pet </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just hot choco being a cunt. Fuck hot choco.</br>  <br><br>I might be asking for too much if I said I want to see Yipes at Top 8</br></br>  <br>To a degree. Then you hit the "it'll never look like the official art" wall and decide whether to soldier on or despair.<br> What are you trying to get at, anon? I'm no fan of 4chan guessing games. </br></br>  Requesting Chun Li playing at an arcade or on a arcade stick at EVO. Something cute is fine too.  <br>Let's get that Marn victory this year. Whooo Marn the best :^)</br>  <br> Absolutely no ill intentions. Just randomly curious. Have a nice weekend! </br>  <br> underage retard acting like an underage retard <br>what a shock. Also, why do they think the circle is only drawfags? The circlejerk consists of the cancerous faggots that suck each other off in streams all day.</br></br>  <br> That Marn shutdown on ChrisG <br>The Bionic Arm may haunt Marn, but MorriDoom never will</br></br>  <br>I want you to draw Ryou beating me up while I'm tied to a chair</br>  <br> Thank you.<br>Maybe I'll be good enough one day.</br> </br>  <br> Yuunabro doesn't love his waifu <br>He literally got mad at me and told me he had a waifu when I flirted with him<br> It had anything to do with the "circle" <br>You don't even know what the circle is, and Jura isn't associated with it in any way<br> Avatarfag <br>Replying to posts with your waifu to identify yourself isn't avatar fagging and is all-around superior to being a tripfaggot<br><br>In conclusion, fuck off and die. I'll tell your waifu her husbando died saving a baby from a truck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Don't give up! Just try to have fun with it and it'll be worth it! </br>   all this circle tin foiling. <br>There is no Circle, drawfags pick what they like or what they think they can draw easiest. <br>If you make requests like "Sasuke doing a backflip over a crowd of people onto an elephant while transforming into dark sasuke" you arent going to get your request filled unless the artist is super competent, which very few are. You are better off making less complex requests. <br>You have a better chance if you just post your simple picture with a simple request. <br>Complex costumes are also rarely picked, I see that guy posting his "Chaika eating carrot cake!" request all the fucking time, do you know why he doesnt get deliveries? Because chaika's costume is ridiculously detailed and the average drawfag doesnt want to draw it, or doesnt have the ability to draw it the way they'd like. <br><br>No one is conspiring, If drawfags have shit taste and dont pick your waifu, you'll just have to make a different request or wait longer. This is CHARITY after all, these are inexperienced (probably self-taught) artists, who just want to do something nice for someone, you cannot expect quality, consistency, or speed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> when I flirted with him <br>Ryoufag you are a weird and disgusting little man</br></br>  <br>BIONIC AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRM!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_GD<wbr>H0Ylp7bc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>God, fuck Marn, man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He literally got mad at me and told me he had a waifu when I flirted with him <br>I-I think I remember that. Was it around the time he started doing pixels?<br> In conclusion, fuck off and die. I'll tell your waifu her husbando died saving a baby from a truck. <br>You're a good person, anon</br></br></br></br>  roflmaoe  <br>Nice, ride his dick some more, you literal faggot.</br>  <br>go back to your stream.</br>  <br> all this to defend someone who doesn't love his waifu <br>Okay. I wonder why an avatarfag would want to keep appearances, gee. YOU don't know anything, and you're as cancerous as him. Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> when I flirted with him <br>Also yuunafag totally avatarfaged before being call out, I still don't like him for his attitude</br></br>  requesting Sako playing with her  ears  and making a lewd face.<br><br>thanks if you consider</br></br>  <br>I still like Noel even after his punching incident</br>   you will never be such a faggot that you flirt with waifufags online   <br> There is no Circle, drawfags pick what they like or what they think they can draw easiest.  <br><br> Meanwhile <br> Hey does anyone want to do an art trade? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Denying the circlejerk's existence is futile.</br>  <br> Then I guess it is safe to say I've been drawing, even for these threads. It's more fun than requesting, but a different kind of stressful. </br>  <br> I still don't like him for his attitude <br>His attitude being? He never came off as unpleasant to me, so I'm just curious.</br></br>  Fuck man, I wish they still had rights to do MVC again. I really need a new one.  <br>How does it feel being banned from the circle stream by a fifteen year old? <br><br>He won't draw her if you suck his cock like this in public, you creepy fuck. He's a cancerous avatarfag with less talent than Tamashit.</br></br></br>  <br>Give it another decade, anon.</br>    <br>He's just as cancerous as Tamafag and Oorafag with their fucking tildes and exclamation marks everywhere. I find it hilarious that 18-25 year old males are pretending to be little girls on the internet just to get some crude drawings of their whore. Even more hilarious that there are actually people eating that shit up.</br>  Requesting Faye Valentine<br><br>Suggestions<br>-In a towel just after getting out of the shower<br>-In bed naked covering herself with the sheets<br>-In some summer/beach related clothing like a sun dress, bikini, short shorts/skirts, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know how it goes, screenshots or it didn't happen. And even that is not proof, of course, but do fuel the drama please.</br>  <br>Do you have a name? I like your stuff.</br>  <br>Damn. 10/10 vulture, ain't even mad at Ryoubiguy.</br>  <br>Hey man, Marvel Studios is back to gaming. If they can work out some shit with Capcom again they might make another one soon!  R-right? <br><br>At the very least, I'd like to give me a Hyper fighter on the same tier with NamcoXCapcomXSega or some shit. Just ANYTHING hyper.</br></br></br>  <br> Oh, it's cool that you went down that road too. Stressful as in waiting for OR's reaction? Because that's certainly tense. Hope you get to my waifu one day too. </br>  <br>I just wanted to let you know, anon - you are saving this thread.</br>  There's no circle you guys are just paranoid. There's no clique that soends their time bitching, shitposting, and drawing to facilitate more shitposting  <br>Not really but I have a pixiv,  <br> Stressful as in I want to get everything right, but in a sense that I still have some sort of control in the process, as opposed to waiting for chance to decide if my waifu will be drawn.<br>Who's your waifu?</br> </br>  <br>List of all the circlewanks?</br>  <br>That's a regular ballpoint pen or a fine point marker? I'm so jelly, your lines are so good.</br>  <br><br>Thanks a lot</br></br>  <br>Thanks man, hopefully you draw my waifu one day. I love pen and paper drawings like yours.</br>  <br>But there isnt even a stream going on where are you getting this?</br>  The fuck is going on in here?  <br>MvC2 came out in 2000 and MvC3 came out in 2011, we've got a few years to practice and get really good.</br>  <br>Stream needs not to be online to chat.</br>  <br>It's a0.3 Hi-Tech ballpoint pen</br>  <br> You'll know for sure next time I get to draw Ryou. It's been a while. Have a nice weekend and good luck! </br>  <br>...You're aware that screenshot shows them laughing at you for your dumb circleshit, right?</br>  And here I thought this weekend was going to be good.  <br>Just because there isn't a stream going in doesn't mean they won't jerk each other off in the charlt regardless.<br><br>Guys you're hurting his feelings ;~;</br></br></br>  <br>So they are just jacking off in there?</br>  <br> ... <br><br>I think you'd feel more comfortable in the stream chat.</br></br></br>  <br> few more years of VERGIL MORRIDOOM ZERO <br>pls</br></br>   all drawfags who draw for more than a month are terrible people! <br> why don't new drawfags stay? we need more drawfags! </br>  <br>Better to just stay away, my friend.</br>  <br>Holy shit.<br>My sides.<br>He's such a fucking pussy.</br></br></br>  <br>God dammit you got two good deliveries this week, one nice last week and I haven't got one for a few weeks. The draw friends don't hate mai waifu, they hate me and my requests</br>  <br><br><br>Should make a team request since there's three of us.</br></br></br>  <br>Mai waifufag here. Thank you very much for including her in your collage Boa. Looking forward to the finished version.</br>  <br>Sure, mister tough guy. <br>Caring for his waifu and the drawfags who drew her equals being a pussy.</br></br>  <br>If I can make Semifinals at a small tourney, so can you.<br> Vergil's my anchor either way and I lost to a Zero May Cry team and to a Morridoom afterwards.I've loved Vergil since DMC3 and he's even more broken in DMC4 </br></br>  <br>Those two things have nothing to do with each other, most of the drawfags in the circle are shitty artists. My best deliveries have come from no-names who post once or twice, only the most cancerous faggots end up staying long-term and becoming circlejerkers. Drawfags should be seen and not heard. Their opinions don't fucking matter.</br>  Requesting Rikka in casual, summery clothes!  <br>Says the guy shitposting behind anonymity</br>  <br>*caring for his avatar<br><br>He's a fucking faggot hiding in his stream and having other people suck his dick and call him a good boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Dubs speak the truth.<br>Look at the bright side. You may be the problem, but at least there's another requester here who causes your waifu to get the attention she deserves.</br></br>  <br>I love Vergil too. He ain't one of my mains, but he's great to use.</br>  I'm glad I never go to streams now.  <br>Neither does yours or mine. So, let's all shut up and get back to requestiong and/or drawing, ok?</br>  <br>Does it hurt that nobody will ever enjoy the fact that you exist?</br>  <br>What the fuck are you on about? He might as well just get it other with and thank him, instead of crying in a chat to his friends. He can't do any more damage than there is already.</br>  <br>Not all streams are bad, just the ones with that crowd</br>  <br>interesting option</br>  <br>He ain't forcing no one to suck his dick. They do it because they like it.<br>You can't blame the manufacturer for consumers liking the product and keeping on buying it, right?</br></br>  <br>Same old, same old.</br>  <br>Oh, is this the new "ur just jelly ur whore wasn't drawn xD" shitpost when you've been backed into a corner with no argument?</br>  <br> hiding in his stream <br>Says the guy hiding behind anonymity</br></br>  <br>I don't even need to do sword loops to get some damage out, he's damn great.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oEE<wbr>7RKQ2Ssg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Check that 1:47</br></br> <br><br><br>Do we make a team out of our waifus cosplaying our mains or their regular outfits?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> photoshopping out the best part </br></br>  She wont be drawn.<br><br>-the circle</br></br>  G-guys why am I in all the screencap<br><br>Couls it be because I'm the biggest shithead of the entire group?????</br></br>  <br><br>It's terrible</br></br>  <br>Ojii, you need a tan so I can draw you all day long.</br>  <br>I really outta finish DMC4 with Vergil.

It's also possible they are adding content to the episode now that they have more time and it's still in an unfinished state.</br>    I wonder why I didn't fucking watch this last season. No fucking wonder so many goddamn people said it had the best OST of the season. <br><br>The show so far has been really good. I fear that this show gets way too popular (since it is getting dubbed and whatnot), and that /a/ will start hating it like KLK. And don't you fucking deny it. When the show aired the threads were full of fags extolling the show, and once it got ridiculously popular /a/ hated it because "muh newfags."</br></br>   this OST <br>It's tracks like "Call You Later" that make my day a little brighter.</br>  Hopefully the OST will keep me alive until ep 12 finally airs  Back to Back Raw<br><br>http://marumaru.in/b/origin/94140<br><br>Half Life 3 Confirmed To Be Skipped</br></br></br></br>   Call You Later    Sidewinder   <br> and that /a/ will start hating it like KLK. <br>Too late. /a/ is calling it fujoshit now.</br></br>  <br>What show doesn't /a/ call fujoshit?</br>  <br>Moeshit?</br>  <br>Whoa, thanks anon. Wasn't expecting it this early.</br>  Illustration from the new chapter. I won't have time to actually sit down and read it until later but just from skimming through the pictures, it looks like  Zapp throws a suitcase with the president's head into Leo's apartment?  It was also surprisingly short for a quarterly chapter. It's like half as long as his old quarterly chapters, not sure what's up with that.  It's already out? Damn, thanks for the reminder anon.<br><br>Too bad we lost all the hype on here. Can't reallt blame /a/ though, especially after this cock-tease ep 11 ending.<br>Oh well, at least the ost will help me suffer through those days/weeks/ m-months? ;_;  <br><br><br>"It's magic" is just too good. 2groovy4me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Potus   got decaptated, now it's up to  LEO  to put him back together </br>  So if I wanted to start reading Back 2 Back, could I just read volume 10 or are any of the episodic chapters in 2-9 important other than what the anime covered?  <br>Plotwise, no, not really.<br><br>You'd be missing a hell of character building though.</br></br></br>  <br> In The City <br> It's Magic <br> Hands On <br> Starbow <br> Early Train <br><br>I was sure as fuck waiting for this day to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I'd definitely go back and read them, it's just way too text-heavy to get through all ten volumes when B2B raws are staring me in the face. Figured I'd just read 10 now so I don't need to worry about spoilers.</br>   Call you later <br> It's magic <br> Catch me if you can <br>Fuck, I actually feel bad for torrenting it right now, shit's just way too good.<br><br> S2 never </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please let this lead to a Futurama-like development with talking heads in fishtanks.</br>  <br>Amazing! Thanks so much for sharing!</br>  <br>There's a new character introduced in volume 8 and it also shows a little bit of what happened in New York from 3 years ago, and in volume 7 it brings up the fact that  Leo's eyes start to steam/burn when he over-uses them  although that's not super important so much as it probably looks confusing if you don't know about it. You won't miss anything really big, but bits and pieces of the world get filled out gradually, like showing you KK's family or Chain's werewolf gang. It's probably fine as long as you go back and read it later though. Volume 10 is probably the most important for having the biggest character-focused arc and filling in some of the details about the god eyes.</br>   10. Attack The System   07. Call You Later  <br> a new character introduced in volume 8 <br>Who? Doctor?</br></br>  Retard post here, where's the ED song?   On My Own <br><br><br><br>It's on Nyaa.</br></br></br></br>  Thank god the most came early.  <br> Why is this thread so empty. <br>It is a thread about poor quality anime.</br></br>  <br>It's a thread about a god tier soundtrack unlike hibishit.</br>  Final episode fucking when though  <br>Yes.<br><br>I was thinking that the whole time.  Sometimes I wonder if the author ever watched that show what with the alien New York setting and Zapp being almost exactly Bender. </br></br></br>  If the last episode sucks at least we have this good soundtrack. I might want to buy a physical copy.   ost sounds exactly like the stuff Sawano used to do back when Sawano was good    At The Gates <br><br>Oh wow I just got Heat Guy J flashbacks.</br></br>  LIFE IS WORTH LIVING AGAIN  This will be the perfect thing to listen to while I finish reading Trigun.  <br>Decide on one thing already, you bue faggot.</br>  <br><br>Can't read moon but it seems   Leo's task is to bring the president's head to the hospital to have it stitched back to his body while dodging crazy asshole trying to stop him  Looks bombastic but I agree with anon above it's quite short.</br></br>  Is Taisei Iwasaki the new Yoko Kanno?  <br>Nightow was having too much fun watching Matsumoto's anime to draw more.</br>  <br>He doesn't plagiarize his shit does he?</br>  <br>Depends on how many people he's sampling from.</br>  OST of the fucking year.<br>It would take something elder god tier to even go against this.</br>  <br>He sure is impressively diverse, and the special made it sound like he really thinks about the show when he's composing music for it. I'm eager to hunt down some of his other soundtracks now.</br>  What are the chances of anyone translating the first Back2Back chapter?   Starbow <br>Beautiful. I'd love to hear an extended version of this layered with field recordings of Manhattan at 4 in the morning.</br>   On my own <br><br>Yes, the feels are still overwhelming.</br></br>  <br>Too soon.</br>  To be honest, my hype for the eventual finale was waning, but now I'll never be not hype. I'm only on track 9, but everything is so fucking good.<br><br>Thank you based Iwaski. I knew you would deliver.</br></br>   tfw no sonic in the new chapter <br>I wonder if the anime designs influenced him at all or if it's just the quarterly schedule, but the characters look very slightly different somehow. Leo's hair looks a little fluffier for one thing, and did Zed get a new outfit?<br><br><br>I guess he was busy with the promotional stuff like the mini-chapters and the light novel illustrations and the blu-ray covers. Hopefully the next chapter is a little longer.<br><br>Likely, since multiple moon-readers post in the threads. I'm not good enough to translate the whole thing but I got the general gist and could maybe do a loose summary tomorrow if no one else has stepped up by then. But I would definitely appreciate dialogue translations.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very good actually; I'm doing it right now. <br>Don't expect a full draft until I finish my volume 10 corrections, but I don't expect those will take more than another day or two.<br><br><br>This is a brilliant idea and if there are any soundmixer anons in this thread I will personally translate a doujinshi of your choice if you make a track like this and post it here.</br></br></br></br></br>  My guess for the short chapter is so it'll fit in the next volume. We've already got three extra chapters from WSJ and SJ, plus that short one from SQ.19 an anon translated. This plus the next chapter should just be enough to make volume 11 (or 1 if he restarts under the new name).  <br> did Zed get a new outfit? <br><br>He definitely did. He has sleeves now, and it looks like there's a cutout in the back of his shirt too.</br></br></br>   the entirety of Disc 2 <br><br>Holy FUCK.<br>This is so good, I love literally every track.<br><br>Also, there is some stuff that I have never heard before that sounds really great. Is it possible they just never included it or is the finale going to be extremely good?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, next chapter in October and volume 11 by Christmas? Sounds like a plan.</br>  <br>I could do it myself but I have no field recordings of Manhattan at 4 in the morning and I'd only be able to loop parts of the song to extend it.</br>   footloose   <br>Zed's gone FULL NIGHTOW. <br><br> i'm going to lick that back cutout </br></br></br>  CRUIIISIIIING  <br>Zed O'Brien a slut now<br><br>A manslut<br><br>Huge manfishslut</br></br></br></br></br>   Call You Later <br>WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT AWESOME BASS INTRO</br>   A Way Out <br><br>GOTTA FIND A NEW ATTITUDE<br>IF YOU WANNA <br>GET OUT<br><br>This shit is funky as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Call You Later   <br>This song is fucking amazing but... what episode is it even in?</br>  Last Kekpisode when?  <br>May as well make it a fucking movie at this point.</br>   United   <br>Well I think they aren't airing it on TV because it is going to be much longer than a normal episode.<br><br>So, extended OVA type thing?</br></br></br>  <br>When the OST tops the Oricon Charts.</br>   amazing soundtrack <br> show barely uses it <br>Every fucking time.

Didn't see that coming.<br><br><br>We discussed this just here </br></br></br></br>  So I definitely wasn't expecting the chapter to get leaked so soon but it's a little late for me to start a dump. I could either dump chapter 4 tomorrow, or I could dump it together with chapter 5 on Friday or Saturday like I originally intended.<br>I might also try to typeset the new chapter once I'm done with 4 and 5, assuming there is a translation by then.

Episode 12 is just a montage of cute Sonics. Trust me, I saw a preview screening.<br><br>Probably. The real question is whether they can maintain the same caliber as the first season. If Matsumoto stays, I have hope, but Bones doesn't have a great track record for the few second seasons they've done.</br></br></br>  <br>They can't kill her twice  right? </br>  <br>It'd probably be her third time honestly.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128130116   <br>Never say never.

That's enough to make a meme out of, but it's not really evidence that they can't make a good second season. If I had to guess, Noragami Aragoto will be perfectly good.</br>  What on earth are those random noises in the middle of Keep on the Sunny Side? It sounds like someone's chewing with their mouth open, and it's driving me nuts  <br>Chaika was adapting a light novel, wasn't it? But I think Noragami will be a better comparison once it comes out, so we'll see.</br>  <br>Chaika S2 was cut short by the publisher IIRC, hence it was shit as they made bones put 12 episodes into 10</br>  <br>It wasn't shit, it just wasn't fleshed out enough. I think the show would have been fine if it made it to 12 episodes, but budget cuts kind of fucked it over.</br>  Keep On The Sunny Side; The most underrated track of the OST?  <br>Shit I forgot how good the OST to kyousougiga was!!</br>  <br>Chaika: Avenging Battle wasn't really a second season, Chaika was just splitcour, it was planned to be 22 episodes long with a season break inbetween the first 12 and the last 10 from the beginning. Sort of how like how Akagami is this season, it's already confirmed that its second half will air Winter 2016.</br>  <br>Yikes, were the sales that bad? I didn't even know they could do that.</br>  <br>checked</br>  Oh my god it's even better than I excpected.<br>Shame most of the music is short.</br>   mfw Oblivion <br>I don't know what the fuck came to him to make him think "Let's compose some tango" but hoooooly fuck</br>   Toy Blues    Traffic Man <br>This shit is my jam, yo<br>Reminds me of FLCL</br></br>  <br>I can already see this shit.

It's selling really, well.</br></br>  <br>Its only been one day</br>  <br>kekkei is nowhere near as popular as /a/ believes. Vol1 alone may have sold well but the drop will be harsh for the rest of them</br>  <br><br>Well, as long as it's sells.<br>Also holy shit, Oblivion is too fucking good, I had no idea I liked Tango this much.</br></br></br>  <br> Vol.2 had a better debut rank than Vol.1 </br>  <br>I wouldn't be so sure about that.</br>  Would you play a Kekkai rpg?  <br>Just listened to Sidewinder</br>  <br>Depends; can I recruit a slime?</br>  Would you let him be your tortoise knight?  <br><br>It would be an honour.</br></br>  OST is overrated.

Also 13 hours late there anon, lucky I just woke up.</br></br>  <br>Well that sure is good news. Where can they be found? Nyaa hasn't got them.</br>  <br>The magazine has an ebook release, and the Kindle preview has the entire chapter.<br> Still mad no one ever ripped the SQ.19 digital releases before they were taken down. </br></br>  <br>Translator anon here; I'm Kindle-less but I'd certainly appreciate having those files, so if someone would be kind enough to rip and upload them it would be a big help.</br>  How can you rip digital files from Kindle  OST is rising on the Oricon chart. We top 5 now.<br><br><br>I have no clue. Is there a way to screenshot a Kindle page? That might be good enough.</br></br></br>  Any chance Gangsta sell like kekkais sensen?  <br>Gangsta is better than most shows this season but Kekkai is better in every department.<br><br>Its quality anime</br></br></br>  <br>Why would it? They're nothing alike.</br>  <br>You might be able to yank the mobi off of your device (or straight up just download it from Amazon) and extract what's inside with Calibre or something. Are Amazon's files protected in any way? I don't recall.</br>  <br>you just have to want it badly</br>  <br>It sounds like the instrumental version of On my own, at the BRUUIIISINNNGG part and the on my own part.</br>  <br><br><br>I haven't tried ripping a sample before, but I can just screencap it on my phone.</br></br></br>  Still no proper scan as far as I know, but inexplicable yukatas poster got some clearer pictures.

The full ED is on Nyaa if you still need it.</br></br>  <br> listening to 04. On My Own </br>  <br><br><br>Don't fucking listen to this guy.<br>They are not airing it yet because it's longer than usual and it's very difficult to give it a spot in the airing schedule.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone know music like World goes round? I need that shit in my life.  You're all pretending to like this OST, right? It's amazingly shit.  <br>You're pretending your taste is this shit, right? No one can have it that bad.</br>  It's time /a/, post your best White pics to protect that sweet smile.  Is it true that the final episode airs on 12/12/15?  <br>Highly doubt that, it's only delayed cause it can't find a timeslot on the TV network that airs it. At the latest it will be at the end of Summer since all the 1 cour Summer shows will be finished and there will be free timeslots to fill.<br><br>Hopefully if the sales of the godly OST are great then maybe the studio will push to have it aired as soon as possible.</br></br></br>  Would you guys like to see the twins make a cameo appearance in the manga? Perhaps even a mini arc?  <br><br>http://a.1339.cf/uglehp.mp3<br>Done, although there aren't any doujinshi that I really need translated.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't mind...that is if they live.</br>  <br>Depends on how it's done I guess. I think Nightow might be able to integrate them into the tone a little better so it would be interesting to see at least. But would it keep the same general premise or would it be something entirely new?</br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br><br>I'd be cute, I'm also interested in seeing White drawn in Nightow's style</br></br>  <br>Yeah; I have faith Nightow could make a good story out of it. Libra has tons of members; they could send the Macbeths to one of the other outposts. Or more appropriately, to the LHOS, since Black has Caster powers anyhow.</br>  <br>Wow, anon, that's REALLY good! The diversity of the mix and how well you married it to the original track is fantastic, but it's even more exciting that you extended it so well.<br>If there's some way I can thank you for blessing us with this, please name your price.</br></br>  <br>So still no short version eh</br>   Good OST <br> Full OP and ED are shit <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>That's some nice work.<br><br>Before I put this in my MP3 player to listen to dozens of times, is there a name you'd like to be credited as for this? Or just mixanon?<br><br><br>Because  you have terrible taste. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Full OP <br> shit <br><br>I don't even know what to say to you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just mixanon will do, thanks.</br>  I felt like this's show's yaoi subtext was much closer to the tasteless trash that was Uta no Prince Sama's vulgar fujo-pandering than, say, Hibike! Euphonium's tasteful yuri subtext. 3/10 overall. Poor backgrounds too. They look filtered and traced.  <br><br>I'll give you 2/10 for trying to be creative with your baiting.</br></br>  <br> Best Boy <br> doesn't post Zed <br><br>you fucked up anon</br></br></br></br>  So, will the last episode ever air? or will it remain forgotten?  like HOWAITO   <br><br>At least we know who the best Siblings are</br></br>  <br> the Kindle preview has the entire chapter <br><br>Why would they show the entire chapter as a preview? that seems absurd to me.</br></br></br>  Okay, I know I've been wishy-washy as hell about this lately, but chapter 4 tomorrow for sure, and chapter 5 likely on Saturday or Sunday.  <br><br>Not at all anon, don't rush yourselves if you feel you need to work on it more or have other real life duties. It's great that you're still working on delivering each chapters in the best quality you can make them.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it has something to do with how short it is? I don't know how kindle previews work, or if they're automated or what, but quarterly chapters are usually way longer.</br>  <br>I don't know, but it's only Kindle who has it. The EBJ preview's only got half the chapter.</br>  <br><br>I humored the idea that maybe the actual chapter is longer but page 32/33 clearly shows the end chapter, but maybe you're right.</br></br>  <br>I didn't know I wanted that, but thank god you made it</br>  <br>Is there any way to read the series outside of madokami's 3 volumes? I've heard since it's licensed no one continued scanlating.</br>  <br> I've heard since it's licensed no one continued scanlating <br><br>You're right, if you want to continue reading you're best off buying the volumes</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Not if you don't know japanese, although you can still look at the pictures in the raws. Not counting the volume 10 stuff, I think two other chapters have been dumped in the threads but they aren't uploaded anywhere as far as I know. There was also a Gilbert mini-chapter that's uploaded onto some reader sites and the mini-chapter from Weekly Shounen Jump that I've lost the link to but maybe you can find it in the archives if it's still up.</br>  <br>Looks at pictures is the best part.</br>  <br><br><br>Ah i see. I'm out of luck then since i don't live in the US where it seems to be licensed.</br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah. sucks to not be in the US</br>   Keep On The Sunny Side <br>Shit so relaxing if it's not sad</br>  <br>huh?</br>    <br>One of the OST songs dingus</br>    The English in this OST is really good.

Maybe the next issue will be longer.</br>  Fine. Be that way.  I don't know if this is helpful, but here is the OST which includes full OP and short/full ED added onto Disc 2.

What the hell is this shit?</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr>  <br> What the hell is this shit? <br>A desperate rush job over $15.</br></br>  <br><br> I have to stop reading the first one that goes into batoto. I will try to wait for anybody but FA from now on, but the manga has gotten quite a few good cliffhangers lately.</br></br>  <br> Noumu lookalike com <br>What?</br></br>   yfw   <br><br> Deku being Based Deku. <br><br>Will he ever be not Based?  I doubt it. </br></br></br></br>    So based on this page its safe to assume he paralyzes anyone if he licks their blood.  <br>Probably. Though the way his quirk works just makes him look more edgy.  I like it </br>  <br>That makes no sense. More likely when he draws their blood he exposes them to his Quirk.</br>  <br> That makes no sense. <br>Could be a voodoo curse kind of thing.</br></br>  <br>then when he had his foot in the other arm he would have been paralyzed.</br>  Why is FA hated now  What happened?  <br> becoming hypnotized because you answered something makes no sense! </br>   Tries his best to avenge brother while screaming murder. <br> Tries a sucker punch/kick using his speed. <br> Spiked shoe into arm. <br> Knife through shoulder. <br> Pinned to the ground. <br> Gets a lesson on how to become a proper hero. <br> Cries about brother. <br><br>I feel kinda bad for Iida but stain is slowly growing on me, especially with these two pages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stain is just tired of faggots in his heroism.</br>  <br>Thank god he isnt an otaku. Many on /a/ would die to him for their shit taste. What genre would he cleanse this world of?</br>  How would Stain fit into Bloodpouch?  So now that Deku is basically Superman, what's left?  Thank God for Stain calling Iida out on his bullshit.  <br>character development.</br>  <br><br> Harem and rom-coms seems like a good guess. </br></br>  <br>Am I the only one who is in love with Izukus eyes?</br>  <br>I wouldn't say that Deku is superman. He's not even close to that level.</br>  <br> that gran torino'ish entrance <br>Next chapter can't fucking come fast enough</br></br>  <br>I meant the "superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes" Superman not the "spent 10 years in the Sun, wearing Ironman's Hulk-Buster with Batman's utility-belt and a Lantern Ring on each finger" Superman Gold Prime Leader of the Autobots.</br>  <br>He isnt even at the level of the superman that got his ass beat by batman.</br>  <br>Batman also had a mech-suit at the time.</br>  <br>And? Superman was weakened by a nuke.</br>  <br> "spent 10 years in the Sun, wearing Ironman's Hulk-Buster with Batman's utility-belt and a Lantern Ring on each finger" Superman Gold Prime Leader of the Autobots. <br><br>Thank you, I laughed. But in all seriousness I think he's supposed to a cross between Superman and Batman</br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad someone liked it.<br><br>All he needs now is his own personal gadget slut to outfit him with hard counters to literally everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously he turned into a LN Mary Sue MC and got some overpowered broken ability unique to him.</br>  <br> "spent 10 years in the Sun, wearing Ironman's Hulk-Buster with Batman's utility-belt and a Lantern Ring on each finger" Superman Gold Prime Leader of the Autobots <br>That was hilarious. Damn I hate Superman.</br></br>  <br>Just the spiked shoes into am alone is 10 points to Stain. I mean how many people actually put those spikes on their clothes to use in manga? Hell just look at whenever spikes are on shoulder pads, they exist to do nothing.</br>  <br>So Hatsume?</br>  <br>He already has a notebook full of strategies on how to fight each and everyone of his classmates ala batman.</br>  <br>Was that the name of the gadget slut?</br>  I think stain is gonna let deku and iida go because deku is "a true hero"  <br>Yes. I hope she creates Ultron</br>  <br>I figured Endeavor was gonna show up and force Stain to retreat after Deku gives him a good fight and some stuff to think about.</br>  <br> "spent 10 years in the Sun, wearing Ironman's Hulk-Buster with Batman's utility-belt and a Lantern Ring on each finger"  <br>I actually kek'd<br><br>But no he's not at the level you described.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He has superhuman strength, speed and reflexes.</br>  <br>But not at that level.</br>  <br>He can vaporize massive blocks of ice and smash massiver robots.</br>  <br>Basically he's japan's equivalent of captain america</br>  <br>Still not Superman level.</br>  <br> concerning yourself over yourself <br>Wut</br></br>  <br>is it easier for your retard brain to understand like this: "don't act in self interest, a hero is selfless and always puts others before themselves"</br>  <br>deku doesn't get his shit fucked by kryptonite</br>  <br>How the fuck did he find that out</br>  <br>I think that anon is trying to say that FA's grammar is shit.</br>  Stain is pretty interesting. Though wanting to kill heroes because there's too many of them and they're not "real" heroes seems a tad out-there for a motivation. I'm really curious what drove him to come up with the idea that there were too many fake heroes and that he needed to cull them.  <br>he probably is, i missed that. :(</br>  <br><br>It's more like he hates the idea that being a superhero is a career and not an extraordinary feat.</br></br>  <br>Someone probably died and a hero could have saved them but ran away/ didnt care enough probably since people wernt there to watch and praise him.</br>  <br>Her hair is so much better when tied up like that. The giant bush is quite silly, and impractical.</br>  <br>I'm curious what would happen if they ran into one another since Endeavor is basically the sort of hero that Stain hates the most - someone more interested in their legacy/popularity than in actually helping people.</br>  <br>He can do it when he goes full power, but at the moment he is using only 5% of it and can't go any further without getting injuried.<br>Moreover, Superman can suffer lot of damages without any harm while Deku is just a human</br></br>  <br> an entire team of dedicated translators. <br>are you mentally challenged? They have exactly one retarded translator.</br></br>  I'm stoked to see what gadgets they put into mom-suit 2.0  I hope good translators take over  <br>We get it, FA is shit, but did we really need a thread with links to all the translations almost 2 days after they came out?</br>  We're getting a popularity poll next week.  <br>I actually want the MC to be number one in a poll for once</br>  <br>Japan has shit taste, they'll likely vote Kachan as #1 or something, or maybe icyhot because he's so "cool and handsome"</br>  <br>Kacchan I can take. Todoroki not so much</br>  <br>As much as I hate it, Tsuyu is most likely going to be in first.</br>  <br>I think her popularity might have waned a little?</br>  <br> unique to him. </br>  <br> implying it won't be Froppy <br>I just hope Tokoyami makes it into the top 10</br></br>  <br>They share it on the same account. It's still unique.</br>  Reminder that there's still a chance this will go to shit. Naruto didn't get bad until around chapter 200, and the chuunin exams (I believe chapter 35-120) were great. Here's hoping Horikoshi doesn't drag the series on too long at least.  <br>I thought she was still pretty popular with the nips.</br>  <br> a girl being voted 1st in a shonen manga with a mostly male cast <br>That never happens, anon.</br></br>  <br>She probably is, Horikoshi just keeps introducing interesting girls. Even MUH BIG HANDS straight man girl has something going for her, which is her hair.</br>  So if you were voting in the popularity poll who would you vote for /a/?  <br><br> tfw Deku will probably place below Todoroki, Tsuyu and probably even Kacchan <br>It's like Law almost winning the last OP character poll but not quite as terrible</br></br></br>  <br>Tsuyu. I'm a faggot like that.</br>  <br>Either Frog, Invisible Girl, or Deku. Guess I'd just roll a dice to pick.</br>  <br>best boy needs the support in these dark and edgy times.</br>  <br>Kirishima needs some development. So him.</br>  <br>I really hope that Stain is not a character for just this arc.</br>  <br><br> Start reading the manga <br> Well shit here is Shinji <br> A few chapters later <br> When will you stop being so based Deku ? <br>This manga is such a wild ride.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He became based by chapter 2 when he actually worked out for half a year and it showed. You could tell from the start this is not the usual loser protagonist.</br>  <br>His current pussy mode is due to him actually being aware of the big picture, unlike Shinji who can't even handle his own first world problems.<br><br>It's a vast gap.</br></br></br>  <br>Deku is headed to be a Batman level intelect hero with Superman's strength.<br><br>Scary.</br></br></br>  <br>endavor will get a few cuts and stain a slight roast.</br>  <br> that note would only make me masturbate harder </br>    <br>of cosure we are, it's the first year anniversary of the series.</br>  <br>I don't think Stain would be able to touch him, unless he's got some throwing weapons. You can't engage a man that's practically made of fire in melee.</br>  Awaiting big bro All Might to come in and one shot Stain.  <br>will any villain even make it to the top 10?</br>  <br>same with bleach and the soul society arc, or Ippo with the class A torunament.<br><br>long running shonen usually decay after the first 3 -4 years (150 - 200 chapters), probably because the autors are already bored with the idea but as the series is printing money they have to keep on with it.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd vote for  All Might </br>  <br>if any of them do it'll probably be Shigaraki.</br>  <br>Really Endevour must have more than just shooting large beames of fire in his powerset if he's meant to be #2.</br>  <br>Stain.<br><br>The Iida rekt this chapter was just too high.</br></br></br>  <br>We all know that. A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.</br>  <br>Birdbro will do well I think.</br>    <br>he'd only need 1 cut to paralize him though, so just a fast slash can do the deed.</br>  <br><br>Most likely something like that, or he just uses poison he is immune too on his blades.</br></br>  <br>do we know how the japanese like/dislike Stain?</br>   the proper way of utilizing one for all is to cover the entire body in it <br> all might is such a horrible teacher that he couldn't teach kid about this for a fucking year </br>  <br>There's no "proper" way, All Might was such a natural he was able to utilize it differently with no major effort unlike Deku</br>  <br>he was ripped too</br>  <br>Her popularity has waned a lot since the manga started.</br>  <br>Frog fanart was a fad</br>  <br>Opposite, I don't like tsundere character like Kacchan, chitoge but Japanshit are crazy about them.</br>  <br>It's actually hard to tell whose the most popular right now, since the popularity of some characters have waned a lot since they were introduced. The only ones that have stayed up there are, Deku, Aizawa, Kacchan, and All Might.</br>  <br>Deku will probably win anyway.</br>  <br> Kacchan <br> tsundere </br></br>  <br> Marika with thousands votes from y-san  <br>I'm afraid frog will be the second, seems like she has many enthusiast.</br></br>  <br>As a rule, the main character should be taking first place. However, he's going to get a lot of competition. Knowing Japan, Kachan and Todoroki will get many votes. This is also an opportunity to find out how Japan thinks about Froppy.</br>  <br>Look at futaba and 2ch, also fujoshit said he is tsundere to Deku, even if you don't want to admit.</br>  <br>Reminder that anything we love will eventually disappear or wither away, without exception, except when you die before it happens.</br>  <br>probably since it was shown she's a midget.</br>  <br>That's just fujos being fujos. They characterize him like that because he's obsessed with Deku.</br>  Let's bet on which position will grapes be on the poll.<br>I think he'll be  7 .</br>  <br><br>They always knew that she was a midget, but what made it wane, was the fact that there are just better characters out there.</br></br>  Top 5 will almost definitely be, in no particular order:<br>Todoroki, Bakugou, Deku, Tsuyu, Ochako<br>Iida will probably be in the top 10 somewhere, along with Aizawa. I don't expect All Might to place anywhere near where he should because of Japan's shit taste, though.</br></br>  <br> And uraraka is main female character <br>If tsuyu votes more than uraraka, what will hori do?<br><br>Allmight, Deku, Todo, Kacchan, Ochako more correct.</br></br></br></br>   thought that Ochako will be an incredibly boring and bland MC's love interest who is inferior to all other girls in a show <br> this fucking battle happens <br>Hope to see her fighting alongside Deku more. He can wreck and pulverize shit and she can use it as a weapon.</br></br>  <br>sadly he won't be in the top 10.</br>  <br> Japan <br> voting All Might into the top 5 <br>I wish they would but Japan generally hates muscular, boisterous characters like him. And I can't imagine his real body being much more popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually recently Ochako has become a lot more popular than Tsuyu.</br>  <br>Word, Uraraka is faring a lot better than I thought she would at the start. I hope she's never sidelined, despite not being top-tier battle-wise. This is the kind of series where antagonists can easily be tailor-made to favor one's quirk over others', so there's no need for anyone to truly become irrelevant.</br>  <br> Good ol punch to the face </br>  <br> cotton on <br>What does that even mean</br></br>  <br>Given that she can easily swing a giant fucking concrete column around thanks to her ability, it's far from being useless. It was just useleess on the arena as that place really favored straight attacking power over something more delicate.<br><br>She can also provide a good support to Deku, like removing his gravity so he can launch himself forward like a rocket.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a long established term meaning figure out</br>  Out of two more or less recent character polls I can remember, one for One Piece showed incredibly shitty Japanese taste, while poll for SnS was almost perfect. But westerners were allowed to vote in SnS poll, this why results were so good. If it's Jap-only, outcome sure will be disappointing. Watch All Might not even being in top-10.  <br>Not even the editor liked All Might. Japan is terrible at enjoying all the good things they produce.</br>  <br>punch to the face out of nowhere is the best entrance anyone can make, prove me wrong.</br>  <br>You are an idiot.</br>  This thread has peaked my interest. Quick question, is this manga SFW?  <br>Oh God, do we have to pick just one? Because there's not a single character I dislike.</br>  <br>Yes, the only thing you get that are not completely safe are a naked (but hidden) character in one of the early chapters, damaged hands, and cartoony brains.</br>  <br>yeah<br>very young shouneny<br>just some violence, no nudity or profanity<br> or drug use or furfaggotry or alcohol abuse or lewd or inflamatory speach or  <br>One character has nipple less boobs on show tho</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they characterize him like that because Kacchan really is tsundere as fuck. You can "no homo," it if you like, but he's textbook.</br>  <br>It means "catch on." It's common in the east and south, but it isn't often used in writing and is almost never heard in the west. (I'm talking about Murica here, if you hadn't guessed.)</br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  So at which point Deku will beat the crap of grenade faggot finally?<br>That little shitstain is fucking annoying and has to be put down finally.</br>  <br>Bah, paladins. Why are they all so fucking  based. </br>  <br> That note <br><br>Women will never understand the simplicity of a men's heart. If it's cute, we fap to it, no questions asked.</br></br></br>  <br>Take responsibility for your words.</br>  <br><br>Very well.</br></br>  <br>Stain. He is turning out to be one of the best villains I've seen in a while (or at least in Shonen)</br>  <br> this delusion <br>He's not a tsundere, he has a superiority complex.</br></br>  <br>Tapes, that dude is my favorite</br>  <br>It all depends on how much Bakugou learns from Best Jeanist</br>  <br>Dunno, he seems to be a pretty bland arc boss to me.<br>Nowhere near the level of ten commandments from nanatsu.</br></br>  <br>Meh, they're good for diferent reasons. Stain looks like he type that actually does what he does because he believes something will como out of it. The Ten Commandments are great because within their group they actually seem very close and friendly.</br>  <br>Falco, easily</br>  <br>The handsy manchild gets my vote.</br>  <br>Either Kacchan or I can't stop twinkling</br>  <br>There is not other right answer but this.</br>  <br>Kacchan, no contest.</br>  <br>All Might probably.<br>I feel like the japs won't like him much and he will end up in like 10th place or someshit.</br></br>  <br>No, he just needs to touch them. Him licking blood, was him just being weird.</br>  <br>Mei!</br>  <br> He's still standing <br>They're so fucked<br>Anyway, I think Deku's true quirk is being based</br></br></br>  <br>todoroki</br>  <br>Even after transcending the utmost levels of faggotry in the last few chapters? Your loyalty is..silly.</br>  <br>I don't think so, given Blackmist couldn't move when Stein attacked Shigaraki.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6_h<wbr>mVukPc4</wbr>  [ ]<br>For some reason this came to mind<br>Maybe it's because he nailed that wall jump like X</br></br></br>  <br> tsundere <br>If you use words like this, you are such a faggot. What does it even mean? Angry, cranky bitch? Whatever it means, it probably has a direct English equivalent, like when one piece tards say "nakama" instead of "friend" or "crew mate"</br></br>  <br>For once I want the MC to win</br>  <br> tsundere <br>oh, it mean cold at first, then warms up..how does that describe the faggot in question at all? stupid nerds.</br></br>  <br>Deku.<br>For once in my life I actually really like a shounen MC.</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? How fucking new are you that you don't know what tsundere means?</br>  <br>newfag spotted</br>  <br>The only correct answer.</br>  <br>That's because Tsuyu hasn't had a chance to show off lately, unlike Ochako.</br>  <br>Ochako going to get character development, basically becoming the anti-Sakura</br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>She's already cheerful and always helpful.<br>Best "main" girl in a while.<br>Unlike Elizabeth from NnT who only becomes more fucking annoying and helpless.</br></br></br>  <br>Black Mist had a bleeding wound on his arm.</br>  <br>He did?</br>  <br>She can just melt the balls. Mina is a hard counter to the Grapist. <br><br> Mina's hair is pink in canon <br> Mina will never be delicious tan + platinum blonde </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kinda, i remember frequenting /b/ a decade ago, back when cheese pizza was all day everyday, but /a/ i am new to. And while i can easily guess what tsundre means through context on the board, I don't read the kinda manga where that's a prevalent character trope, so I have no reason to seek out a detailed definition.</br></br>  <br>Licking blood activates his quirk, otherwise it wouldn't have shown Iida feel the effects right after he licks the blade.</br>  <br>He did.</br>  <br><br>And that's why man child was able to move his arm. He hadn't licked his blood yet.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh wow, he does.<br>Man that quirk must suck, you have to wound your opponent first to stop him.</br></br></br>  Going to be interesting seeing Stain get his ass kicked by the king of the fake heroes he despises so much.  <br>Hands was wounded quite badly, but he wasn't paralysed. It's probably licking blood. It might work with consuming other parts of a person.</br>  <br>I think that the quirk's limited to one person at a time.</br>  <br>it does speak wonders about how skilled he has to be as a villain to be able to properly utilize his quirk</br>  <br>Just started Boku no Hero Academia, whats wrong with Fallen Angels translation?</br>  <br>Ghettospeak.</br>  <br> expecting no character development after 50 chapters </br>  <br>Then why was indian hero paralyzed along with Iida? I highly doubt he passed out or anything like that from a mere stab to the shoulder.<br><br><br>They suck at grammar and proofreading and throw out random out of character cursing all the time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Super strength <br> overpowered <br> In a world where someone can control your mind if you do as much as answer him, a guy can freeze over an entire building, other makes bigger explosions the more he fights and the other can make fucking portals out of his body. <br><br>Deku is small time.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who /Shouji/ here?  <br>Needs more screentime</br>  <br>That hero was already passed out when Stain paralyzed Iida. I'm pretty sure being mere seconds away from death makes it easy for one to pass out.</br>  <br>TO BE HONEST, Sakura's development was almost identical, the main problem was that all of said development disappeared the moment Sasuke came in or whenever she had to job to make Naruto look cool.<br><br>Outside of those moments, even tho they're very few, Sakura is actually kinda cool imo.<br><br>She's a huge wasted opportunity tho and Uraraka looks to not be falling into the same trap, hell Iida's entire arc seems to revolve around just how frustrating it is to be that jobber.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. We have no idea if he was passed out or not.</br>  <br>One for All is top tier anon. It's like five quirks at the same time. <br><br> Super strength (Stronger than Shouji)  <br> Super speed (Faster than Iida) <br> Super toughness (Tougher than Hard Guy) <br> Wind based explosions (More explosive than Baku) <br> Getting Huge (Huger than Huge Hands Girl) <br> Resistance to mind control / Spooky Ghosts in your brain <br><br>Shits broken yo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But All Might was that size before he got OfA. I still think activating OfA returns you to your prime muscle state.</br>  <br>Nigga, Deku barely using 5% to all extent created a shockwave almost as powerful and ice/fire guy going all out.<br>When he gets trained enough to not get broken by the burden of his own power he will be a fucking one punch man just like All Might before him.</br></br>  <br> Getting Huge (Huger than Huge Hands Girl) <br>That's not it, that's just how All Might is.</br></br>  So was the OfA user before All Might strong enough to be the no.1 hero? I mean why did All Might's arrival make such a huge impact on the world if there were users before him?  <br><br>HUGE.</br></br>  <br>Maybe before him All Might wasn't that powerful, if theory that it accumulates the powers of previous owners is true.<br>Then Deku will certainly surpass All Might.</br></br>  <br> clench your asshole super tight <br>what a good advise<br>all might is certainly a great sensei</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe before him All Might <br>*one for all</br></br>  <br>mah boy</br>  <br>What are you talking about? Are you implying Deku's arm grew there?</br>  <br>Reminder that Shouji is as fast as Iida.</br>  <br>Do you want to accidentally fart when you are smashing a villain in the head?</br>  <br>Iida grabbed the two people next to him. Shouji did the same, then ran/leaped further than Iida to get out of Black Mist's area of effect.</br>  <br>See the first panel. Deku's arm grew large enough to explode his shirt sleeve.</br>  <br>It's muscle, dumbass.</br>  Episode 8: "Baldr, the Man Chosen by God"<br><br> Shaka arrives at the Light Chamber and goes up against God Warrior Baldr. <br> Befitting for his title, “The Man Closest to God,” Shaka unleashes powerful moves against Baldr. <br> However, Baldr is unfazed by Shaka’s attacks, and displays overwhelming power. <br> His power was truly the power of “God,” but Shaka starts to see through the curse hidden inside of Baldr. <br> On the other hand, Deathmask takes his sworn enemy Fafner to Yomotsu Hirasaka in order to settle the score. <br> However, Deathmask is put in great danger due to Fafner’s evil plans. <br> Will Deathmask be able to protect a loved one this time? <br><br>New on Saint Seiya?
