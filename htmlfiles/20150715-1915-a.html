[ ...And we were all having a great time. Until these two faggots showed up.  Based Okada  Hey now Nagai has worked on great mecha shows like Idolmaster Xenogl...<br><br>HA HA HA HA HA HA</br></br>  Delusional genfags on suicide watch  YOU WERE WARNED VIA STAFF LEAK, BUT NOBODY BELIEVED IT. WELL WHO'S LAUGHING NOW.<br><br>" Not me </br></br>  Dropped  Picked up.    Man how quick do people think the fanart machine is going to start going with this?  <br>Not really that well. It's a sausage fest, but character designs isn't exactly what Fujos want. and also manlet army.</br>  PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Idd<wbr>xplDVGw8</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Idd<wbr>xplDVGw8</wbr>  [ ]  <br> manlet army. <br><br>Levi is a manlet too just to let you know.</br></br></br>  Confirmed higher sales than g-rekto and age.    <br> Okada <br><br>Wure, why not.</br></br></br>  <br>Xeno was great.</br>   everyone assumes Gen will write new gundam <br> instead it's the only person who could possibly fuck it up worse </br>  They should let Aoki Ei direct gundam.  Okada is making a gundam?<br><br>And there are shotas involved. Have they been warned about Okada?</br></br>  <br> AGE <br><br>Not much of a feat.</br></br></br>  Polygon time?   there are people posting on this board, right now, that will defend this after it's shittier than people already expect   <br>So basically they are hashing Valvrave + MS 08th + Gundam X + 00. Wonderful.<br><br>Just bring back Seed. Jesus said he's be back right?</br></br></br>  <br>This is what we get for not buying more G-Reco BDs. I miss Tomino already ;_;</br>  <br>I should have supported Try more instead of shitposting that it's not as good as GBF. REGRET</br>  <br>From the PV, it doesn't look bad. The Mobile Suit designs are cool (except maybe the piston waists), the characters look look alright and the setting doesn't seem too out of the ordinary.<br><br>It's all left up to Nagai and Okada. Which sure, no one has faith in them, but we can cross our fingers and hope.</br></br></br>  <br>You know I wouldn't have cared, but since they showed us the PV before I got all hyped because it looks and feels like a good Gundam series. Even the main Gundam looks great. But then they announce these two and I know they're going to throw all that potential down the drain. I hope I'm wrong though.</br>  <br><br>M3 was great.</br></br>  <br> M3 was great </br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  I'll summarize the story synopsis:<br> It's 300 years after the last great war <br> old governments destroyed, new governing parties on earth <br> there is a colony on Mars and a girl named Cordelia Aina Vaughnstein (?) wants to have it self governed <br> manlet is part of a civilian security company (CGS) and gets tasked to escort the girl <br> CGS gets attacked by Galhorn(?) whose purpose is to prevent the revolt <br> CGS uses the iron-blooded orphans as decoys to escape <br> the leader Orga gets pissed at the company and decides on a coup d'etat <br> manlet is tasked with driving away Galhorn and takes the mobile suit serving as CGS' power core (It's the Gundam) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please.</br>  <br>It wasn't, but I like Okada's general style.</br>  <br>Better than Taniguchi+Butcher tbh</br>  <br>you and maybe 5 other people think that</br>  <br>Olga is the leader of the kid's, not the company. I'm tired, there's probably more mistakes.</br>   Okada   <br><br>Gundam Cycled</br></br>  <br> Confirmed higher sales than g-rekto and age. <br> M3 <br> WIXOSS <br> Nagi </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was entertained by the series, I guess I like it too.</br>  <br>Yeah, nope. I'd rather take Butcher's 'fuck seigi no mikata' drama over Okada's drama. Since it's Gundam, you can be confirmed that Butcher will at least chuck in some kool operator shit.</br>  <br>I don't.<br>Tomino and G-Reco can fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Except you're dead wrong.<br><br>This is Nagai + Okada. Therefore it will sell. Plus the bishonens getting all hot blooded for fujobucks.</br></br></br>  <br> anohana <br> toradora </br></br>  <br> Okada career is finally dying <br> now she gets the mega job </br></br>  <br><br>We need fujobucks to fund the next Tomino Gundam.</br></br>  <br>I feel like Okada can do a beginning well. There's always interesting setups. After that, it's a complete mess. There's often too many things trying to be resolved at once and they're usually done improperly or not at all.<br><br>Perhaps it's due to others on the staff or other constraints but it always seems to go this way from the anime she's worked on, at least the ones I've seen.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are people that will have also shitposted it to death long before it even airs so it all balances out.</br></br>   We'll never see Tomino, Okada,and Kawamori working on the same project   <br><br> This is Nagai + Okada. Therefore it will sell </br></br>  <br> What is Toradora? <br> What is AnoHana? </br></br>   inb4 one episode worth of battles <br> the rest is just high school girl drama <br><br>Yes. YES!</br></br></br>  <br>Anohana is her only original to break 10k. But who knows how this would sell.</br>  <br> What is Toradora? <br>Sold less than G-Reco retard. Also a shitty drama is different from mecha</br></br>  I for one look forward to Okada saving anime.  <br>It's not just the height. They're too 00s for fujos. Not pretty enough.</br>  <br>It's already got a boost with the Gundam brand name attached.</br>  <br><br> M3 <br> Xenoglossia <br><br>You've already lost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the fucking point idiot. I'm talking about it selling and Toradora sold 10.3k which is more than G-Reco. Do your research.</br>  After this Okada will be a household name and the Wixoss movie will sell millions  <br> angry manlet MC <br><br>Reminds me of Shingeki.<br><br>In a bad way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Xenoglossia was Nagai<br><br>M3 was Okada<br><br>This is Nagai + Okada. All the anime they've done together have made over 10k.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually the best thing to happen in my life.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> I'm talking about it selling and Toradora sold 10.3k <br>Wrong again dumbfuck</br></br>  <br>Geez that's guy-heavy</br>  To be fair the new Gundam setting feels a bit like Mad Max.   Director: Nagai Tatsuyuki <br> Series Composition: Okada Mari <br> Character Design: Chiba Michinori <br> Music: Yokoyama Masaru </br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind the character designs, except maybe the silver haired guy in the back. The characters that were shown outside of this crew seemed decent enough too. The Mobile Suit designs all seem slick as well. It's the story itself I'm worried about.</br>  <br>Only retarded Gentards like you actually believe this.<br><br>Go back to reddit with your underaged self.</br></br></br>  <br>Fat guy has an adorable face</br>  <br> Sold less than G-Reco retard <br><br>10K TV series + 21K BD box.<br><br>Stay wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gen's operator shit was never cool and nothing but a boring wiki dump.</br>  Atleast it would be Gundam little kids will understand  <br>Christ, having to spoonfeed retards.<br><br>Ok, kid here we go:<br><br><br>Toradora Individual Volume Sales:<br><br>1 8 11,201 2009/01/21 Fall Toradora!<br>2 8 11,020 2009/02/25 Fall Toradora!<br>3 8 11,128 2009/03/25 Fall Toradora!<br>4 8 10,895 2009/04/22 Fall Toradora!<br>5 8 10,547 2009/05/27 Fall Toradora!<br>6 8 10,312 2009/06/24 Fall Toradora!<br>7 8 10,142 2009/07/23 Fall Toradora!<br>8 8 10,649 2009/08/26 Fall Toradora!<br><br>Total Avg: 10,307<br><br><br>G-Reco Individual Volume Sales:<br><br>1 9 10,536 2014/12/25 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>2 9 9,177 2015/01/28 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>3 9 8,652 2015/02/20 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>4 9 8,099 2015/03/27 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>5 9 7,969 2015/04/24 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>6 9 7,530 2015/05/27 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>7 9 7,106 2015/06/26 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>8 9 2015/07/24 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br>9 9 2015/08/26 Fall Gundam G no Reconquista<br><br>Total Avg from 7 vols: 8,438<br><br>Keep in mind each vol. sales have been dropping so we can expect this average to get even lower.

Sorry, I'd rather take the butcher's track records over Okada's.</br></br>  <br>That's the point, whatever source we use, Oricon or that CGI hater estimate, G-Reco still sold lower than Toradora.</br>  <br>Yeah, because the rest of anime writers are literary geniuses.</br>  <br>Either they are or not, they are less predictable than Butcher. You don't even need extra edge to Gundam shows. Usually, a huge number of characters die off anyway</br>  <br>Truth hurts huh?</br>   Nagai and Okada have a new movie soon   Is there anything on the site if you're set to JST, like character info or anything? Is that where people got the name of the Gundam?  <br>Are those some kind of implants poking out through his spine?</br>  <br><br>Because Gundam has been getting shitposted to death since the days of Gundam Seed Destiny. Realistically though pretty much every Gundam series since G Gundam has been cause for mass freakouts.</br></br>   Gundam uses a giant spear/mace/maul polearm.  <br> It is leftover from the war 300 years ago and due to degrading over time its performance has dropped.  <br> Over the course of the series it will upgrade itself by incorporating equipment from fallen enemies. <br><br>Based on the gunpla spoilers it looks like most of its weapons are going to be physical melee weapons. There's also a fat MS with a bit hammer.</br></br></br></br>  What's wrong with Okada?  <br><br>Who cares about your stupid sales bitch fit unless it's about model kits and overall merchandise. Fuck off with that shit.</br></br>  <br>Looks like it, from the beginning of the PV. Wondering what importance they'll end up having.</br>  <br>Yeah, it must be pretty painful to have to resort to using strawmans to defend that pile of shit.</br>  Should have just made Crossbone Gundam.<br><br>Japs actually voted Crossbone Gundam as one of the Gundam anime adaptions they all want yet Sunrise decided to do this trash instead.</br></br>  <br>  Xenoglossia was Nagai <br>  M3 was Okada <br>  This is Nagai + Okada. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck someone said something actually funny on /a</br></br>  <br>And incredibly excited for it, shame we'll have to wait until April or May for the BDs.</br>    <br>She's one of the handful of writers that's actually recognized by name on /a/ and, therefore, a meme.</br>  <br>Almost as painful as your ass is right now over being proven to be too dumb to follow a show about fighting robots.</br>  When does it air?  <br>But I did follow it. It was just shit.</br>  <br>October.</br>  <br>Sure you did, kid.</br>  <br>In the fall. Not sure about air date, but the gunpla comes out in October.</br>   Looks shittier than the last installment <br> Writer and director of flop mecha <br> Awful design <br><br>No surprise that Americunts will like it because MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey now, you're straying from the meme. If I was a kid, I'd be able to follow it.</br>  <br>I hope, I love that kid</br>  <br>She is a christmas cake.</br>  <br> There's no such thing as stupid kids <br><br>Okay</br></br></br>  <br>Or even better. We get Ulith-lite girl pilot in the series.</br>  As long as people buy the merchandise, it doesn't matter if the anime bombs.<br><br>And the merchandise WILL sell.</br></br>    Reminder that Okada is so shit that she even fucked up a basic plot like this here.  <br>But G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA and only Tomino followers liked it</br>  I can't fucking wait to see Okada's Katejina Loos in the series. Make it happen Okada!  <br> But G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA </br>  What are your thoughts on the revealed design of the Gundam Barbatos? As well as the one grunt revealed so far? Now we know the waist pistons are meant to be like that.<br><br>If it does end up getting redesigned throughout the series, that would be cool. Personally, I think it looks very good besides that one detail. It's a unique design. A Core Fighter would have been acceptable, if not just armor there.</br></br>  <br> G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA </br>  <br> reminding me of Katejina <br>I'm suddenly seeing red and shaking in rage</br></br>  <br>Fucking saved.</br>  Fuck this. Where is G Reco season 2  <br>I will miss the G-Reco hatedom. Their constant stupidity and their lost in touch on reality was a sight to see..</br>  <br>Too cresty.</br>  <br>At least with Okada we have a guaranteed's backstory and if she wills it good characterization.</br>  <br>Why did Menma want the kids to build a giant rocket again?</br>  If it is based on Tekketsu Kinnotai, the "Iron and Blood Corps" then it would be edge and dark underaged animefags surely will love it  <br>Both look pretty cool, I guess.<br><br>What really gets me excited is the difference between the two traditional-style MS that have been revealed and those Metal Gear-esque grunts.<br>There's potential for some pretty neat fight scenes there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA </br>  <br>I like Okada because she'll make sure the cast suffers, but there probably won't be many deaths, because okada hates killing her characters permanently for some reason.<br><br><br>I wonder what that grunt suit has in terms of thrusters. Will thrusters pop out of those heel flaps like the God Gundam?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do your research retard.<br><br>The only anime they've done together are:<br><br>Toradora - sold 10.3k and 21k BD-Box<br><br>AnoHana - sold 34k, made 1 billion yen at box office, movie sold 20k on BD<br><br>Gundam - Probably will sell over 10k</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's potential for some pretty neat fight scenes there. <br>Watch the Railgun S filler and kill your hope before its too late.</br></br>  <br>  I can't fucking wait to see Okada's Katejina Loos <br><br>You're shitting me, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Because they wanted Jinta's mom to be happy, hence they decided to build a rocket from looking at a festival poster.</br>  <br>It will be so shitty I can't wait to see everyone's reaction.</br>  <br>I'm liking the design, the pauldrons, lance and shield gives it a cool knightly look</br>     The Aquarian EVOL of Gundam with the Aldnoah Zero setting     <br> not this psycho </br>  <br>Bro every Sunrise mecha is a rehash of original Gundam. When will you realize this?</br>  <br> What are your thoughts on the revealed design of the Gundam Barbatos? <br><br>It's literally a cheap knockoff of an FSS Mortar Headd. Even the Nips are saying as much on Twitter. Unlike a Mortar Headd though, the Gundam isn't elegant at all.</br></br></br>    <br>You can continue to be in denial I suppose. I just hope you don't kill yourself when vol 1 comes out and sells over 10k.</br>  <br>Is the pilot seat in the head of the Gundam? I can't unsee it as being right above the V-fin.<br><br><br>Really digging the lance. Melee weapons like that and the Gundam Hammer are always nice to see.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Even the Nips are saying as much on Twitter. <br>Cool bullshit bro. Nobody gives a shit about FSS</br></br>  OK OK hold on a fucking second, somebody answer me this: I have no idea who Okada is, but I know that he worked on 00, and I thought it was a commercial success?<br><br>Why are some anons here calling it a flop?<br><br>No I'm not defending it. Just genuiely confused.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If it is based on Tekketsu Kinnotai, the "Iron and Blood Corps" then it would be edge and dark underaged animefags surely will love it <br><br>Please elaborate on that work</br></br></br>  <br> But G-reco was suppose to be MUH SERIOUS WAR DRAMA <br>This is your brain on drugs</br></br>  <br> I'm saying this based on absolutely nothing.  <br><br>Okay</br></br></br>  <br>Okada like Mari Okada.<br><br>A woman.<br><br>A woman who can't write for shit because she inserts cheap unbelievable drama into everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By Okada they mean Mari Okada, who specializes in drama, suffering, and occasional shotabutts.</br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/people.php?id=39695<br><br>Scroll down and see if you recognize any of the anime she has worked on.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> Okada <br> he <br> worked on 00 </br></br></br>  <br>The white plate on the chest looks too much like a pilot hatch for me to agree with you.</br>  <br>I'm saying this based on the Gundam brand name and the Nagai+Okada brand name. You're literally retarded and know nothing about sales trends if you think they won't factor into the BD sales somehow.</br>  <br> Nobody gives a shit about FSS <br><br>Except Japan, where opinions actually matter, especially compared to filthy gaijins who haven't watched any Gundam that wasn't Wing or BF.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh oh OK, sorry, OP's pic related got me confused.<br>Yeah, I get the hate now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping that's the case. On that note, the crests all over the Gundam take away from the design. The ones on the shoulders would be fine if not for the ones also on the knees and chest. Makes it look busier than it needs to be.</br>  <br> I'm saying this based on the Gundam brand name <br>Yep because AGE was a success right?<br><br> and the Nagai+Okada brand name <br><br>There is no name brand, they made two successful anime that were 3 years apart by chance the former was based a popular source of material already. Both aren't ad prolific or popular anymore since you keep ignoring their recent flops.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What? It's what I was told by the fans when I said I couldn't understand shit and didn't like it, along with the usual "you're too retarded, go watch a/z like the kiddy you are"</br></br>   Nagai <br><br> inb4 Saten makes a cameo and beats up everyone with a baseballbat </br></br>  <br> Except Japan <br>That;s why Gothicamade was a huge success and why everyone is anticipating the new FSS volume right?</br></br>  <br>No need to make up bullshit.</br>  <br>Those power-symbol looking things are going to be part of some kind of Trans-Am/Moonlight Butterfly/NTD/etc. super system that gets unlocked by something they find partway through the show.<br><br>Calling it right now.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Nagai <br> &gt;inb4 Saten makes a cameo and beats up everyone with a baseballbat <br><br>Cordelia, the one the guys are escorting, could be a badass</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is /a/ ready for Gundam EVOL?</br>  <br> their recent flops. <br><br>you forgot to add "individual" I can guarantee you their new movie "Heart of the Anthem" will sell well as well as this Gundam.<br><br>AGE had good preorders just like G-Reco but most people cancelled them when the show started airing. Before the show starts airing it will get a lot of preorders because it's Gundam. Look at G-Reco, it got 10k before airing. After airing it went down. It's possible with this one but I doubt it based on the staff. They're clearly aiming for this one to sell.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the gundam seems to be looting a baseball bat in its future, so...</br>  <br> AGE had good preorders </br>  <br> everyone is anticipating the new FSS volume right? <br><br>Yes. <br><br>https://twitter.com/search?q=%E6%B0<wbr>%B8%E9%87%8E%20%E8%AD%B7&amp;src=typd&amp;v<wbr>ertical=default&amp;f=tweets<br><br> Gothicamade was a huge success <br><br>Wait, you actually think Gothicmade was made for a profit? You do know literally only 4 people worked on it in what was an attic right? With no BD release in sight?</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Trans-Am/Moonlight Butterfly/NTD/etc. super system <br><br>I sincerely hope it doesn't end up being called something like "IRON BLOOD" to match the title.<br><br>I actually thought those symbols were used as an indicator for which faction it belonged to, much like the Federation or League Militaire repainting enemy suits into their own colors. It doesn't appear to have them in the final scene where the MC walks away from the Gundam, though that may just be due to the angle or lack of necessity of drawing them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> With no BD release in sight <br>Stop reminding me.</br></br>   Nagai like Tatsuyuki Nagai <br> not Go Nagai </br>  <br>They should have forced studio 8 to work with more Mai Hime since LoveLive is done for now<br><br>Mai Hime should become the Gundam for female mary sue MC's</br></br></br>  <br>Fascinating</br>  <br> you forgot to add "individual" I can guarantee you their new movie "Heart of the Anthem" will sell well as well as this Gundam. <br>Yeah you keep being stupid<br><br> AGE had good preorders just like G-Reco but most people cancelled them when the show started airing. <br><br>Nope AGE was out of the top 1000 before it even aired. G-Reco had already aired in theaters hence the high volume turnout but Amazon fucked up the first volume number.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Does Studio 8 have anything planned?</br></br>  <br>True,Mai HiME sold well with merchandise and we still haven't got a 3rd Mai-series since 2008.</br>  <br> https://twitter.com/search?q=%E6%B<wbr>0%B8%E9%87%8E%20%E8%AD%B7&amp;src=typd&amp;<wbr>vertical=default&amp;f=tweets</wbr></wbr> <br>You just literally made a fucking search without reading any of teh comments dumbass<br><br> Wait, you actually think Gothicmade was made for a profit? You do know literally only 4 people worked on it in what was an attic right? With no BD release in sight? <br><br>The movie was released in theaters and flopped. You're the same stupid Nagano fag from /m/ thinking anyone gives a shit about that hack.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which Gundam do you think Mari Okada liked the most?  <br>Just don't kill yourself when both are a success.</br>  <br>well it's a toss up on Horizon,Mai-HiME or another original Sunrise series.</br>  <br>SEED/Destiny.</br>   “the cast will feature a diverse cast of characters, such as girls who fall in love with the main character”     <br>G-Reco for the incest potential</br>  Am I the only one that liked G-Reco?<br><br>Also, what timeline is Iron Blooded Orphans?</br></br>  <br>New AU</br>  <br>Looking at the setting she probably never watched a single Gundam episode.</br>  <br>Victory Gundam.</br>  <br>I liked it.<br>Currently unknown I think, but I'd say AU</br></br>  <br>I liked G-Reco. One of the most beautiful TV anime I've gotten to see while airing. The plot could have used about 3 fewer factions, but it was good.</br>  <br>Kamen Rider Ryuki was done by a woman who never made Kamen Rider before and it turned out to be amazing. Why Okada can't do something similar? <br> inb4 she is a hack </br></br>  <br> &gt;“the cast will feature a diverse cast of characters, such as girls who fall in love with the main character” <br><br>Where did you get that?</br></br></br>  <br> Am I the only one that liked G-Reco? <br>Lots of people did including Urobuchi. The haters are just more vocal and retarded</br></br>  <br> Am I the only one that liked G-Reco? <br>Nope, I loved it.</br></br>  <br>What about that setting seems atypical of a Gundam series? They're all over the place in each of the series.</br>  <br>I liked it, but it really did feel like they crammed 50 episodes into 26, especially after they got into space.</br>  <br>No, you aren't the only retard.</br>  <br><br> “the cast will feature a diverse cast of characters, such as girls who fall in love with the main character” <br><br>It wouldn't be an Okada show without a love do-decagon</br></br></br></br>  <br>A dude from the staff during the event.</br>  <br>Why is so hard start to watch it?</br>  <br>Tons of flaws aside, I like it.</br>  <br> You just literally made a fucking search without reading any of teh comments dumbass <br><br>Neither did you apparently, since they were mostly retweets from the Amazon webpage for volume 13. The rest of the comments were about how the new Gundam designs is a Nagano copycat. <br><br> The movie was released in theaters and flopped.  <br><br>Sauce? You know movies recoup their costs with BD releases right? And Gothicmade, despite being out for 3 years, still doesn't have one. Also, I'm pretty damn sure it made some profit considering it was made with no more cash than that one movie Shinkai made by himself. That is, literally fucking nothing.<br><br> You're the same stupid Nagano fag from /m/ thinking anyone gives a shit about that hack. <br><br>Yeah, because the FSS threads are all just me samefagging and tricking the post counter. And all the recent comments posted about the Gundam design on /m/ looking like Nagano are all mine. I definitely put in that kind of effort just to fuck with you, anon.<br><br>Stay delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A dude from the staff during the event. <br><br>I know Okada can pull something a lot better than making the girls just mere love interests</br></br></br>  <br> Gundam: <br>Kids aren't really soldiers but they do fight because they want to survive<br> Okada Gundam: <br>There is a special unit especially for kids<br><br> Gundam: <br>Zeon are the ones looking like royals <br> Okada Gundam: <br>Feds are the royals and the kids are martians</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm imagining that gif of the child having its head shot off with a laser beam, but with the love interest.</br>  <br>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.</br>  <br>Have you not seen any Gundam series produced after 1979?<br><br>Both of those things have been done to death. If anything, she's not being original enough.</br></br></br>  I wish they would make a Gundam with a decent budget and stray away from the rounded corners cartoon style they have going - I get that it's a throwback, but the sharper style is more modern and personally I think it looks better.<br><br>Also getting rid of the MC who always looks/is 11 years old - seriously look at this shit, everyone else looks halfway decent (Except for chubbs, but he's probabaly a comedic character anyway) and then you have an 11 year old kid who is wearing a jacket that is wider than he is tall and looks like he's going to have an asperger's attack any second. Do they have to shoehorn the extremely young MC into every fucking show?<br><br>inb4 it's for toys/gunpla etc. - Do you really think kids are the main people buying gundam kits nowadays?<br><br>A new Gundam comes out every so often and it always ends up being a shitty cash grab, I wish time and budget would go into a decent show one of these days; there really hasn't been a good Gundam show since 00.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Gundam: <br> Kids aren't really soldiers but they do fight because they want to survive <br>sounds like m3</br></br></br>  <br>if it is dark gundam, they won't life for too long</br>  <br>Because you're fucking stupid. Luckily this new Gundam series will be dumb enough for you.</br>  <br>I liked it</br>  <br> there really hasn't been a good Gundam show since 00. <br>00 wasn't good. It was just a lot of newfags first Gundam</br></br>  <br>  Okada working on 00 <br>  Okada a he <br><br>Looks like someone didn't do his research...</br></br></br></br>   g-reco   <br> if it is dark gundam, they won't life for too long <br><br>I seriously doubt Mari Okada would waste female characters like that<br><br>Making suffer, maybe</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This kills the Gundam.</br>  <br>I think they are a good diverse characters, are you a faggot complaning about character designs?</br>  <br> hurr <br><br>So you're literally a fucking liar who can't speak moon.<br><br> durr <br><br>So you're literally a retard who doesn't know what he's talking about.<br><br><br> Yeah, because the FSS threads are all just me samefagging and tricking the post counter. And all the recent comments posted about the Gundam design on /m/ looking like Nagano are all mine. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Key visual.   implying you wouldn't a cake   <br>This looks so much better than this shit. Based Tomino</br>  <br><br>Gundam has only one timeline.</br></br>  <br> Nagai and Okada <br>Based. Cant wait foro AnoHana Toradora Gundam. They are litterally current anime industry dreamteam. For once, sunrise makes something right.</br></br>  <br>Sleggar &gt; Guts &gt; Archer &gt; Char &gt; Bellri &gt; Hayato</br>  <br> looks <br>Yeah, that was about the only thing good about it.</br></br>  <br>I would so hard.</br>  <br>Six of those people are dead.</br>  It will be the edgiest and most suffering gundam so far, outdoing Victory?  <br> MC is always Japanese <br><br>Last time i checked, Chinks are bad at driving a car</br></br></br>  <br>00 S1 was pretty good. 00 S2 was total dogshit though...</br>  <br>Aww what's wrong Billy? Too stupid to follow a mecha anime?</br>  <br>The lance looks great but almost everything about this Gundam seems unwieldy. The incomplete/empty torso, the end heavy lance, the huge shoulders. If it could support it's own weight, football tackles could be a viable method of attack.</br>  <br> So you're literally a fucking liar who can't speak moon. <br><br>I don't need to speak moon to see a book cover with an Amazon link on it over and over again on the same page.<br><br> So you're literally a retard who doesn't know what he's talking about. <br><br>Great script anon, it's definitely helping you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Projecting your insecurities? Keep eating shit.</br>  <br>Xeno was ok, not great.<br><br>And he had Jukki Hanada not fucking Okada.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how they're going to get the gunpla kits to stand up on their own.</br>  <br>I agree with you about the character designs. I really dislike this style. It just feels really half-assed and all everyone looks like either a gimmick. Tough guy. Fat guy. Expert guy. Friendly guy. No one builds out the world or feel of the show at all.</br>  <br>So, who is Char/Mask-kun in this one?</br>  <br> You will never have a cute anime-scriptwriter wife </br>  <br> Gen <br> Doing anything right <br>He is a hack. Okada on other hand is highly talented very valued proffessional with 200% to make any audience cry, while Gen`s edgines is comical at best.</br></br></br>  <br> MC-kun.   He'll get his mask in the final episode when all his friends are killed in front of him by one of the Fed suits. </br>  <br> yfw Shinsekai Yori series compositor is engaged with another series compositor <br>So jelly.</br></br>  <br>00 had fantastic art, plot, character development and pacing, saying it was bad is just objectively wrong. You may not have enjoyed it personally, but it was well done.<br><br><br>I would agree on character diversity if the kid wasn't shoehorned into the story so they can market it to children like the past 5 or however many Gundams that flopped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They'll likely need a stand support. That, and according to what anons have been saying, the suit will be taking remnants of enemies in order to enhance itself so it's likely the empty torso won't remain that way.</br>  <br>The fat guy.<br><br>It will be a twist with him revealing his true identity after crying bitchtears over remembering how his sister ones forgot to make him lunch.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck are you replying to bait?</br>  <br> Post apocalypto <br> manlet /fit/ MC with Nagai face <br> Gundam with demon name <br><br>Shit looks pretty promising<br><br>Doubt it will get good sales tho<br><br>Also that V fin looks stupid as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its prequel or sequel to After War? before AW they did not had Mars colonies, and after Earth was devastated by Moonlight Butterfly again.</br>  <br> Gets called out as the retarded Nagano fag <br> B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-baito! <br><br>Okay you just keep being stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude that's just Lv. 1, it will probably look better as it evolves more during the show.</br>   yfw it's another AGE   <br><br><br>MC is a kid because of the whole "child soldiers are bad" theme.<br><br>See </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This doesn't look like a Gundam series at all.</br></br>  <br>Because some people actually believe what shitposters say.<br><br>Shocking, I know.</br></br></br>  <br>That sounds more like Battletech book story than typical gundam. Based Okada. Picked up.</br>  <br>00 had terrible character writing though. They didn't act like people.</br>  <br>One can hope.<br><br>Just as long as it doesn't evolve too far, becoming some horrible amalgamation of Federation/Zeon/ human  suits.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Nagai+Okada best director/writer team in industry at the moment, no contest. Nagai shows can suck without Okada. Okada`s can without Nagai. When they Gattai, nothing can stop them though.</br>  <br> the retarded Nagano fag <br><br>That's right, I'm also the Reifag, Valvrager, and G-rekt cocksucker. :^)</br></br></br>  Reminder that Idolmaster Xenoglossia was a very good mecha show that was literally only disliked by THESE AREN'T MY SINGING AND DANCING IDOLS FROM THE VIDEO GAME psychos    <br>Except this genre is relatively new to them. This is their first time doing Gundam. This ain't no SoL-drama fest. I'm keeping my expectations at 0. Though I have no doubt nips will eat it up.</br>  <br>Would be perfect if the crest just chilled out a little. I liked the tiny exia crest.</br>  Okada adapted script for /a/`s favorite show  Rozen Maiden , so there indeed no better choice than her.  <br> Though I have no doubt nips will eat it up. <br><br>Just like they did with AGE right?</br></br></br>  <br>KATANA CONFIRMED<br><br>YAMATO DAMASHI</br></br></br>  <br> This ain't no SoL-drama fest <br><br>Yeah that's the last thing that comes to mind when I think of Gundam, for sure</br></br></br>  <br>the nips had a reason to hate it<br><br> studio 8 can finally make another Mai-HiME series instead of being asshats to Bamco execs. </br></br></br>  <br>You are clearly a faggot</br>  <br> Mech design <br>Shit. But it's Gundam, no surprises.<br> Character design <br>Shit.<br> Okada <br>Boring stupid drama, nothing fun or original.<br><br>On top of that' it's gonna be a 2 cour chop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I kind of liked the show too though I wouldn't hold it up as great or anything. It had really great animation quality as one would expect from Studio 8 and was suitably enjoyable as it's own thing. Literally all the rage that is directed against it is never because of what it is but what it isn't and people got their straight iDOLM@STER anime and it was frankly kind of boring.</br></br>    <br>While it may be referencing a past event (There are many historical child/orphan armies), you could really use the historical perspective any time to cover poor writing. I'm not saying the show is going to be total shit, none of us have seen it yet, but I personally, am tired of the 11 year old MC that has plagued the shit Gundam shows in the past decade.<br><br><br>I disagree, I think all of the characters went through some development (Arguably even Setsuna, though he ended up being closed off like he was in the beginning of S1 at the end of the show, sort of did a loop in personality).</br></br></br></br>  <br>And you`ll love it and ask for more. It`ll be refreshing having drama in Gundam that is not " but he loved to play piano!!"</br>    <br>AGE is an outlier. Until the preorders for this open and it starts airing we can safely assume it will sell decently because it's Gundam.</br>  <br> &gt;Gets called out as the retarded Nagano fag <br><br>What, are you actually implying that people on /m/ don't know who Nagano is? Is this some kind of reverse fedorism?</br></br></br>    <br><br>Grunt suits are looking very good. Regardless of the Nagai/Okada reactions, hype is building.<br><br>I'm heavily reminded of early Britannia Knightmare Frames with all the lances though.</br></br></br></br>    <br> insecure <br> Getting asspained because someone praises and anime you hate  <br><br>Okay<br><br>Nope just Naganofag <br><br>Yep I remember all the FSS threads we have on /a/ right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Black Rock Shooter is masterpiece. It even have Okada self insert (pic related)</br>    <br> Fatass' name is Biscuit <br><br> Biscuit </br></br></br>  <br>Wait for actual scene being animated this season and use WebM, its Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa</br>  <br> someone calls an anime I like shit <br> they have to be a retard! no intelligent person could have a different opinion than me! <br>Who's ass-pained again?</br></br></br>    <br> Yep I remember all the FSS threads we have on /a/ right? <br><br>Yeah, just like all the Astro Boy or Nausicaa threads. They never show up on /a/, so obviously they aren't popular and no one gives a shit about them. <br><br>Sound logic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Master grade of main gundam would be a hit.</br>  <br> Okada <br>Holy shit, picked up</br></br>  <br> that gouf look-alike <br><br>MS covered in thrusters are my fetish.</br></br></br>     Okada <br> Nagai <br>This is going to be worse than Wing, Unicorn and SEED Destiny</br></br>  <br> 11 year old kid who is wearing a jacket that is wider than he <br>Wow, you're the dumbest person on this site.</br></br>  <br> From /m/ <br>Also he's excellent leader and trusted by all the boys, has been with MC since forever and is like a brother to him<br>So, a daddy figure</br></br></br>  Had this been Butcher/Taniguchi it would've been AOTY.<br><br>But as a consolation with Nagai/Okada this will be TOTY.</br></br>  <br>He's going to either die, become Char, or he's going to look like he died then come back as Char.</br>  <br> Nope just Naganofag <br><br>Which one? :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Gentle personality<br>Hobbies are reading<br>Is in the army to earn money for his grandma and sisters<br>Can write and read because of school experience, which is rare to the warboys</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is in the army to earn money for his grandma and sisters <br>Dead by the end of the first cour.</br></br>  <br> He will be the first to die </br>    <br> Is in the army to earn money for his grandma and sisters <br>Haha.

Too bad it`ll take a long time to get any rips of this.</br></br>  <br>The question is, will he be murder in concentrated form like Uso, or will he be the second coming of Banana?</br>  <br> Yep I remember all the FSS threads we have on /a/ right? <br><br> Talking about /m/ <br> Brings up /a/  <br><br>Please stay here and never come back to /m/ you massive fucking faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> girly/shota engineers <br>Every fucking time</br></br>  <br>Please go back to /m/ and never come back here.<br>/m/ has fucking awful taste in mecha.</br></br>  My shelf is ready, just give me the MG now  <br> I have no idea how to shitpost <br><br><br>Pathetic</br></br></br></br>  <br>It depends.

So it may not be too bad. Railgun fight scenes were GOAT.  <br>Circlejering is a part of some specific Gundam threads only.</br>  <br>No one on /a/ saw Gurren Lagann?</br>  <br>Those who were born in 1994 are 19 now. Too old for /a/.</br>  <br>Bad news. Those born in 1994 are now actually 23.</br>  <br>Is funny that you mentioned it. It's really such an irony.</br>  <br>You said "post 1994". Pretty sure you lie within that spectrum.</br>  <br>Looks pretty cool. Though since when does Gundam use Robotech designs?</br>  <br>Eh. About 21. Even worse.</br>  <br>Oh look it's Musashi no. 2346655<br><br>Don't forget your hat</br></br></br>  <br>Except it wasn't. Tomino doesn't do war dramas' anymore.</br>  <br><br>One day Studio 8 would go on to create an idol show far more popular than iDOLM@STER and go on to dominate literally every other anime around it in terms of obsessive fanboys.</br></br>  <br>I was talking about mecha. In 90s it was becoming worse and worse. Btw I'm retarded, I can't count.</br>   Okada <br><br>Why? I would've taken this sexy cake over her.<br><br>She's hotter and a better writer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So, new Sunrise hit that outsels SEED and becomes best sold anime of all times and revives decaying Gundam franchize?</br>  I like the mech designs, but the MC looks shit. <br><br>Those eyebrows really need to get trimmed down.</br></br>  <br>Nah this won't beat SEED. But it looks to have a fair shot at tying or beating 00 which is still a huge accomplishment.</br>  <br> not liking giant brows </br>  <br>that shit taste<br><br>Gunslinger Stratos, Chaos Dragon, Alnoah, PP are so great after all..</br></br></br>  <br>Its going to go when okada character development coming.</br>  <br>Butcher can do that. Surpassing Gundam with Gundam like he surpassed Fate with Fate.</br>  <br>So this guy is going to die right? He's going to go kamina on us so that little shit looking of an MC can get some character development.<br><br><br>Looks boring as shit.<br><br>I hope the gundam is a two seater for them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all shows with minimal Butcher involvement <br><br>I'm pretty sure you meant PP2 as well</br></br></br>  <br> What, are you actually implying that people on /m/ don't know who Nagano is? <br><br>Most people on /m/ don't even know who Tomino is.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw power of friendship with normal people saves the day <br> yfw there is an entire episode dedicated to the characters doing mundane things and they overreact to it like its some profound shit <br> yfw regular people, not new types or any of that shit, literally learn to pilot a mecha in a single day using a manual while doing mundane things </br></br></br>  <br>Old retarded faggot.</br>  <br>How is SEED good in any remote way. It had a mary sue protag who was the prototype of kirito</br>  <br>There are Gentards that actually believe this.</br>  Okade wrote this, though, so it can't turn out that poorly.  <br>Sounds boring. Gimme some space ghosts instead.</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>I don't get you. Irony?</br>  <br>You forget to mention Blassreiter.<br><br>Gen was more involved with Blassreiter much more than even Psycho Piss.</br></br></br>  <br>EXACTLY</br>  <br>Is this what they call, American Joke?</br>  <br> I thought UBW was better than F/Z <br><br>Nasufags are this delusional.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not worth mention since most gen fags did not even watch it, since his name only became popular on /a/ since Madoka despite what VN fags like to believe.</br>  <br>Don't care about Gentards but he could make something fun like the modern Victory. Gundams must be retarded and ridiculous.<br><br><br>This one is an old retarded hack. Know your old men.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn son</br>  <br> This one is an old retarded hack. Know your old men. <br><br>So Tomino isn't a hack? News to me.</br></br></br>  <br>G-reco always been adventure first war second shithead.</br>  <br> They are traumatized because a girl mechanic was accidentally killed by gundam parts in a hangar </br>  <br>Blassreiter is like proto-Urobuchi.<br><br>He consider's it Itano's work and views, not his own.

I mean I know the flashback is more for the reader than the characters but is nobody going to listen to Sabo's story?</br>  <br><br><br>poor bastard is probably gonna have a lisp from now on</br></br></br>    <br>I don't know if I still want to fug him if it's going to stay that way.</br>  <br>aparently Franky, Zoro, and Robin are.</br>  <br> Zoro completely unscathed <br><br>he's gonna have a hell of a fight in Zou</br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's night time already. It sure has been a crazy day in dressrosa.

Yo all done look all fucked up...."<br>Then Ace proceeds to say, "Bitch ass white man dun got me real good like 3 arcs ago. Fuckin white fish bowel head nigga taught me once fo being all whitey and shit. I aint dun gon goofed once when this big ass nigga with tats all up on his face fished me outta sea and gave me some nice lessons on getting that ass all nice a fresh and..."<br>Thats it on that page.</br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't Luffy care? His brother happens to be alive and he's going to talk about why he wasn't there for Ace and how he heard about it.<br><br>Luffy would probably be interested in that.</br></br></br>  <br>No way is Fujitora messing with that home squad. He may have left the island already.</br>  <br>Not much.</br>  <br>Nope, Zoro will roller coaster all of his fights until Kaidou swordman, and even then I don't really see Zoro being as injured as Luffy ever again, Oda ruined te character for me.</br>  <br>Dude you should talk to mangastream about being a translator.</br>  <br>get out</br>    <br>ill take what i can get<br><br>much appreciated, anon</br></br></br>  <br>A character is ruined for you because he got stronger? what the fuck</br>  <br>I'll put in my application right now.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128099895 <br>well then good luck with that</br>  <br>so Mansherry does not heal them huh?</br>  <br>People in different areas of Japan say different words at the end of their sentences as part of a regional accent. Like how Canadians stereotypically say "eh?" all the time. Oda takes opposite sentence endings from different areas of the country, combines them, and makes interesting fake accents. <br><br>Dasuyan is a combination of Osaka's "-desu", which you use when stating something factually, and Kansai's "-yan", which you use when asking a question. <br><br>Neptune's Jamon, Jora's Zamasu, and Bastille's Dara are like this too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Bellamy was the most rage-inducing character back in Jaya, and now he has his own little fanbase. Who would've thought.<br><br>All the more reason why Caesar can and will be next strawhat.</br></br>  <br>Kinemon will wreck Zoro when they duel, Zoro will only win from plot armor.</br>  <br>No problem. Not related but I like the image.</br>  <br>Kinemon isn't that strong.</br>  <br>what's the point? So they get healed and then return to their hurt state? Might as well just sleep it off.</br>  <br> Bellamy invited to the sleepover but not Barto.  <br>Why.</br></br>  <br>I liked him back in Jaya because he was a douchebag.</br>  <br>nice Terminator reference Oda</br>  <br>How do you know? Kinemon didn't do shit.<br><br>His Dofly disguise was great 10/10 though.</br></br></br>  <br>Storywise an omnipotent character is boring, this is why Usopp was a 10/10 in this arc. When was the last time Zoro was in bandages after fighting another first mate/second in command? Daz Bones?</br>  <br>Ok thanks for this and for the 1:1 translation of the spoiler you provided here:<br><br>We'd be stuck waiting without you anon.</br></br></br>  <br>only her dandelion thingy heals temporary, her watering can heals permanently</br>  <br>What does jamon mean?</br>  <br>Kin'emon is fucking Brook-tier<br><br>he wont be able to touch Zoro. The mystery samurai that he and Kanjuro were travelling with might be stupid strong though</br></br></br>  <br>How are you so sure he's not underneath the bed holding Luffy's hand</br>  <br><br>Check em</br></br>  <br>it's ham in spanish.</br>  <br>who's on the bed with Luffy and Sabo? Usopp?</br>  <br>Robin pls keep this haircut</br>  <br> Kinemon isn't strong because he's goofy and humble <br>Yea you are a retard. He has not redacted his duel proposal even though it harms his country if he loses, since he should seek out the strongest want swordsman to get their legendary blade back from zoro the thief.<br><br>It's more logical to conclude that he IS the strongest swordsman in Wano, and protecting the royal blood heir Momonosuke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Combination of Akita's "-jya" (old man speak) and Kansai's "-damon" (childish speak).</br>  <br>Hmmmm<br><br>I feel like we're forgetting something...<br><br>Like there use to be other members of the Straw Hats....<br><br>Nah, the Straw Hats have always only been Luffy, Zoro, Ussop, Robin and Franky.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kin'emon can use black Haki, maybe you mean his torso is above Brook level.</br>  <br>Sabo and Law dont like Romeo<br><br>Only Luffy and Zoro would have a problem with Bellamy but clearly Luffy has adopted Bellamy into his sphere of protection and Zoro does whatever Luffy wants</br></br></br>  <br> Zoro didn't even ask Brook to help him cut steel but Kinemon yes <br><br>Brook is even worse. No haki, his speed can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse, skeleton body can't take much damage. Nigga should fight with music hax like Apoo.</br></br></br>  <br>Kinemon owned Brooke easily with no head and no legs...<br>Also Brooke isn't weak.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>The power of dubs says new crew member.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he's been fighting weaker characters since post-timeskip. We've seen him struggle with Fuji, so we know he's not all-powerful yet. I suspect he'll get a real challange during the Wano/Kaido arc.</br>  <br> no Moocy <br><br>I guess</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really see the point of Brook being another swordman, a sorcerer or some other shit would have worked better.</br>  Bellamy is at the SH sleepover but Barto is not.<br><br>THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT. I'M WAY MAD!!!</br></br>  <br>Zoro was left for dead unconscious KOd by the yeti cool brothers last arc, but I still agree with you he needs a hard fight.</br>  <br>Brook ran off because he was creeped out though<br><br>I'm sure that's officially a 'defeat' but they havent gone all out</br></br></br>  <br>Brook is a bard with some swordsmanship.<br><br>He mostly will just sit around playing music to buff the party.</br></br></br>  <br>He is the soul king, he is just also competent with swords.<br>His music is his #1 weapon.</br></br>  <br> can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse <br>Literally what.</br></br>  We need Brook to be more like Apoo.<br><br>Damn Apoo is one cool fucking character.</br></br>  <br>He directly stated<br> too strong! <br>Before he ran away. Of course he was scared, a torso swordsman was coming at him like a demon and he could barely defend himself.<br>Vs Doffy Kinemon did as good as Zoro or arguably better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;too strong! <br>scan?</br></br>  On a side note, there's a mistake in one of the panels.  Alright guys it's speculation time.<br><br>How is Sanji able to escape from a yonkou and Capone for half a day?<br><br>My guess is that Mom actually got Ceasar and Capone is trying to retrieve him.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Kyros can grow legs! Starfish zoan!  <br>Law fixed him</br>  <br>Sanji already said he wasn't giving Caesar up. So if BM has him then Sanji and co. surely went after him<br><br>alternately, they could just have sailed out of range. No way in hell is Big Mom's ship any variant of speedy</br></br></br>  <br>But they showed Capone and his possy at least near Big Mom's ship. Saying alright guys lets get this Ceasar dude.<br>So I'm assuming Ceasar is at least close to Big Mom's ship as well.</br></br>  <br>perhaps they were pursuing from a distance</br>  <br>That would be super anticlimactic.<br><br>Like Oda shows Sanji the the rest in no danger whatsoever being all like "wew that was close, good thing we had cola"<br><br>Although it makes the most sense to how he managed to survive for so long.</br></br></br></br></br>  Has any devil fruit user hacked his powers to an extent comparable to Kuma?  794 Sabo's adventure<br>Doflamingo lends his sunglasses to a Flamingo<br>(but hiding his face from the readers)<br><br>FUCK YOU ODA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are Bellamys legs. Look at his arm. Most likely turned in his sleep.</br>  <br>Shanks so strong he can swim even with his devil fruit.</br>  <br>This is manga streams translation.<br>In another it says "too strong" and in all of them the point Brooke makes is that the torso is scary and incredibly strong.<br><br>Seeing as it was just a torso, and that this is post skip Brooke, it is only reasonable to consider Kinemon as <br>Very strong.<br>Oda intentionally keeps him out of serious fight scenes so far to hide this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Belamy is obviously the guy in the middle..</br>  <br>Whoops wrong pic<br>To argue that Kinemon is "brooks tier" when he was owning him like guy um a did but without a fucking head and wit joint legs, and adding on that he engaged Doffy better than Sanji and zoro (rescued law), is fucking stupid.<br><br>He challenge Zoro and he is strong enough for it to be a real challenge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious Kinemon is a beast.<br><br>I mean the fucker was able to overpower brook without even being able to see. He probably was just fighting on reflex or something.<br><br>Also he can speak with his farts.<br><br>As to how he could hear form his butt. That is still unclear to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're D's after all</br>  <br>He overpowered Brooke WITHOUT LEGS.<br>and only using one sword instead of his two.<br><br>He's going to be the hardest winnable fight zoro has had so far</br></br></br></br>  <br> his speed can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse <br>All that bumbling around he does is comic relief. His arrow-notch attack is too fast to be seen.</br></br>  <br> worst member <br> not Jora <br> not Diamante <br><br>Maybe if you're a fightfag he's the worst because I freely admit he's the weakest, but he's definitely not the worst character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As to how he could hear form his butt. That is still unclear to me. <br><br>Observation Haki is my only guess</br></br></br>  The best.  At Kyros' house in the flowerfield<br>Sabo tells Robin to not wake up Luffy, he just came to see him one last time before leaving<br>CP0 is returning to the island to capture Sabo and other revolutionaries. <br>In a day or two Dressrosa will be packed with people. He advises the Strawhats to leave as early as possible. <br>Zoro and Franky comments they had no idea Luffy had another brother besides Ace. <br>Sabo explains he was supposed to be dead all these years, and tells his story. <br><br>After the trio became brothers and that fateful day where he met Dragon and later gunned down by the Celestial dragon, as he sank in the sea Dragon came and rescued him before he sank. <br>When he regained consciousness, Sabo had no memory of who he was, or even his own name. <br>The revolutionary points out his belongings have the name Sabo, but he cannot recall. <br>Dragon says he's certain the child is a Goa nobility and another revolutionary offers to find his parents and return him to them, but Sabo yells in rejection. <br>He'd rather be taken away from here. <br><br>Sabo explains to Zoro that while he didn't have any memory, he felt strong desire to not return to his parents. <br>He explains it was Ace who brought his memory back... at the worst timing. <br><br>back to flashback<br><br>Revolutionaries were reading the news about Whitebeard, and how he and Fire Fist Ace died. <br>Upon hearing that name and seeing Ace's image, memory floods Sabo's head. <br>As he hears details of Ace's death and regains memory of their time together, tears flood Sabo's eyes. <br>Ace... is my brother!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So did Bellamy hurt the Skypeians or what?  <br>Are you stupid?<br><br>A zombie RYUUMA attacked Brooke and he didn't run away.<br>A severely gimped Kinemon made him run though.<br><br>That says everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All will be revealed in his eventual flashback.</br>  <br>why would Brook be scared of zombie Ryuma?<br><br>Ryuma had Brook's own personality but Brook has been scared of ghosts since his introduction</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this hurts, every time Ace is brought up its like another wave of sad to me. Why did I think this was going to be any different.</br>  <br> why would he be scared of a zombie of a legendary swordsman using a legendary blade <br>You are grasping at straws. Brooke engaged Kinemon first, realized he was too strong, and ran away. He made a second exchange before running, once Kinemon used his left arm as a substitute for legs successfully, only then did Brooke run.</br></br>  <br>Welp. incoming wave of Ace x Sabo fanart</br>  <br>That explains everything.</br>  <br> CP0 is returning to the island to capture Sabo and other revolutionaries.  <br><br>This is such bad writing if it's true.<br><br>CP0 should have never left the island in the first place considering THEY knew Dofla wanted to lure in the Strawhats to Dressrosa and he even said it to them considering they faked the news so Dofla could lure Law and Luffy to the island and also that means Robin was coming and the entire Cipher Pol organization has been trying to capture Robin since forever that even someone with Robin's hairstyle will get immediately captured and taken away to a CIA style prison and interrogated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo never mentioned or hinted at until the flashback arc that introduces him after Ace's death <br> Amnesia that conveniently goes away after Ace dies and explains why he never showed up until now </br></br>  Sabo screams and passes out. <br>He sleeps for three days before regaining consciousness, and sees worried Hack and crying Koala. <br>Koala tearfully asks Sabo if he's going to quit the revolutionary now that his memory is regained. <br>Sabo puts her worries to rest telling her he has no intention of leaving them, and that he needs to speak with Dragon. <br><br>2 years later...<br>Sabo tells his comrades to let the entire revolutionary army know, he's going after a devil fruit. <br><br>Sabo's reunion with Luffy. The silent conversation we didn't hear is now revealed. <br>It's me, Luffy! Sabo greets his brother. Luffy doesn't recognize him and tells him whoever you are if you're after the Mera Mera fruit you're an opponent! And my name is Lucy, don't call me Luffy!<br><br>But Sabo replies, a disguise can't hide my brother from me. <br>Luffy replies brother? Only person who can call me brother is Ace who died, and.... Luffy realizes at this point. <br>Tears swell in his eyes as Luffy realizes it's Sabo. At first he refuses to believe him, but upon mentioning stealing Dadan's sake, Luffy hugs him in tears. <br>Luffy's screams are illegible as he can't even talk straight. Sabo thanks Luffy for staying alive. <br>Luffy cries he allowed Ace to die in front of his eyes, but Sabo tells him he's glad he didn't lose TWO brothers that day in his absence. <br>If I lost you, I would have been all alone. Thank you for surviving, Luffy.<br>He asks Luffy if he can have the Mera Mera fruit, and Luffy nods in tears in agreement. <br><br>flashback ends</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook ran because he was scared (of ghosts. Brook being scared of ghosts isnt a new thing)but also because suddenly going two-sword style was bullshit and he'd had enough</br>  <br> Fujitora really is a shitty Admiral. <br><br>Fujitora had his snail call with Akainu during the afternoon but it's already nighttime in Dressrosa and Fujitora still hasn't done shit.<br><br>Can there be any more of a lazy Admiral that is probably a Revolutionary Spy instead?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't know why Dofly wanted a fake newspaper article. They just did it cause he's a fuckin noble.</br>  <br>he probably couldn't find them and is now playing dice with some randos</br>  <br><br>powerlevel fags please go</br></br>  <br>Dude is blind. He'll never find them!</br>  <br>im talking fear levels not power levels</br>  <br>Dressrosa is already in ruins as it is. I don't think he wanted to cause any more damage to it until luffy and law leave the island.</br>  Memory loss is so cheap.  Sabo gets ready to leave, and shows the straw hat crew Luffy's Vivre card he made. <br>He tears off a piece for himself, and gives the rest to Zoro. <br>He tells them Luffy may cause a lot of trouble, but please take care of him. <br>Robin waves farewell with a smile, while Franky tearfully tells him to leave him up to them.<br>Zoro laughs, says you sound just like Ace. <br><br>Sabo calls Hack, and tells him he's on his way. <br>Hack tries to ask him about how Luffy is doing, but Sabo cuts off the phone early again. <br>Apparently this is his quirky habit, as Hack yells and swings a punch<br><br>Sabo rides a pack of crows as he heads back to his men. <br>He asks the leading crow if they're ready to sail, and the crow answers "anytime". <br>Well then, let's hurry!<br><br>End of chapter, no chapter next issue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I can see people complaining about this cliche but it works. Sabo needed a strong trigger to remember who he was. Sure is ironic that ace death is the trigger for him to regain his memories.</br>  <br>I'm not a power level fag I just know a strong swordsman when Oda introduces one into the manga.<br>Kinemon is a much stronger swordsman that Brooke, if it offends you that some are better with swords than others I apologize but Zoro's dream requiresit</br></br>  Akainu is likely preparing to kill or order Fujitora to be killed now.<br><br>The moon is out and it's been hours since his last call with Fujitora.<br><br>Akainu isn't dumb.<br><br>He now knows Fujitora can't be trusted from his phone call with him since Fujitora has admitted that he delays vital information to Akainu and even priortizes Akainu last.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Akainu ordered Kizaru to go to Dressrosa as a Marine backup plan because Fujitora isn't willing to do everything he can to bring victory to the Marines.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pack of talking crows out of fucking nowhere!</br>  <br>How the fuck does Zoro know about Ace's personality when Zoro and Ace barely had an actual conversation together?</br>  <br>Sabo could have wait until luffy wakes up and say his goodbyes to him before leaving. I hope this is not a bad omen that sabo is going to die in the future just like ace by giving his vivre card to luffy.</br>  <br>fillershit, nice<br><br> no chapter next week <br>fuck you oda</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause it's exactly what Ace said when he left them on Alabasta.</br>  <br>because Ace literally said the exact same thing to the other straw hats in alabasta</br>  <br>I read that as cows</br>  <br> hurr durr I never re read the manga <br><br>Don't even bother participating in these threads if you don't remember a god damn thing about the subject material</br></br></br>  <br> Not a single Marine watching the harbor  <br><br>The fuck is this?<br><br>Even police cops would set tire traps for an impeding car chase.</br></br></br></br></br>  Seems like the strawhats has forgotten about sanji and the rest.  <br>Kuzan and his penguin <br>Luffy and ucy <br>Sabo and crows <br>Anything else?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ace said to Zoro almost verbatim the same thing as Sabo so he doesn't need in depth knowledge of Ace.<br><br>Ace said the same shit as Sabo and Zoro remembered, that's all</br></br></br>  <br>Just admit that you don't like anything that involves sabo.</br>  <br>Bepo</br>  Inb4:<br> Sabo is capture by Kuzan outside Dressrosa, as his deal to Blackbeard. </br>  Sabo potential sure is scary. Can't believe he become this strong in just 2 years with his haki.  <br><br/></br>  Allowing one of the most wanted person in the world to leave Dressrosa and not do anything about it.<br><br>Even if it isn't Luffy and Law, it's still Dragon's #2 man.<br><br>Fujitora clearly shows why the marine draft is a total failure and a bad idea in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  Chinese scan<br><br>http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>261</wbr></br></br>  <br>Ace would have been PK if not because of Marineford, Luffy and his brothers are just destined to rule the seas.</br>  <br>Sabo's flying away on fucking birds<br><br>what the fuck is Fuji supposed to do about that?</br></br></br>  <br>Is Dragon's number 1 luffy's mom?</br>  <br>I failed two exams on the same day because of how hyped I was the night before the chapter where sabo appeared happened. I like sabo.</br>  <br>Gravity affects birds.<br><br>Fujitora can make his ship fly as well.</br></br></br>  <br>The draft was not an option, two admirals + Garp + Sengoku got out of service and there was no way in hell anyone of those old geezers were strong enough to fill the shoes of Akainu and Aokiji.</br>  <br>That last page.</br>  <br>See: Ace's tattoo</br>  <br>What is this a list of?<br><br>Just animals?<br><br>We got boa and her snakes<br>Sengoku and his goat<br>That dude on WB's crew and his monkey<br>The mermaid princess and her shark<br>Gan for and Pierrot<br>The dude from Enies lobbies and his elephant<br>The Bat guy from baroques work and his dog<br>The unluckies<br>And finally Karou and vivi<br><br>Also all the animals Luffy has tamed.<br>Sea cow, kraken, and the timeskip peeps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujoshits have new material to draw</br>  <br>he'd have to be relatively close to do that though<br><br>or even know it was happening</br></br></br>  <br>See: the sake that made the three of them of them brothers in all times it appeared</br>  How does this work?  <br>damn that may as well have been a kiss<br><br>looks like ill be patiently awaiting fanartists to get on this shit</br></br></br>  <br>Those are not actual animals from what it looks like. Probably devil fruit related.</br>  bedhead Sabo a cute, crying Koala also cute  <br>I've never gotten a clear answer from the people against the draft, who the hell was supposed to replace the power gap?<br><br>Even the Marineford VAs are shitters compared to the ones who left.</br></br></br>  wat  <br>We only ever see Sentomaru's clothes get dirty even from the war and he's apparently blood related to Kizaru.<br><br>Sentomaru could have been Admiral.<br><br>He claims to have the best haki in the marines as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Itachi</br>  <br> all those birds are Dragon <br> Tori Tori no Mi Model: Yatagarasu </br></br>  <br>What a tease.</br>  <br>That seems way slower than traveling by ship.</br>  Wizard of Oz  <br>Sugar turned most crew into toys in a wizard of oz theme.</br>  <br> Wizard of Oz <br>Eh?

It's Yakuza-speak</br></br></br>  just me or is robin much hotter this chapter?  <br>I had no thought of that but yes, exactly</br>  <br>Dragon a logia confirmed?</br>  <br>Why is Doffy hiding his face?<br>My theory is he hides a SMiLE</br></br>  <br>you never see the puppeteer</br>   no chapter next week <br>everytime</br>  <br> implying where Garp goes, Bogart doesn't follow </br>  <br>Isn't he as old as Garp?</br>  <br>Bogard wasn't at Marineford.</br>  <br>Rule 34 shits are getting busy right now too</br>  <br>He's much younger looking than Garp but strong enough to hang out with Garp and earn Garp's confidence.</br>  Alright next chapter should finally be switching back to sanji.  <br>Good thing us normals can enjoy SaboxKoala OTP</br>  <br> doflamingo is PRETENDING to be the master of puppets, but he's not, that's what this cover shows. </br>  <br>Took a cannon ball to the face and he was just a kid at the time on a small ship, the damage could have been a lot worse.</br>  <br> Nope, Zoro will roller coaster all of his fights until Kaidou swordman <br><br> Zou <br> A country with swordsman so strong that the WG and Yonko avoid it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>nah next chapter is Cavendish et all sorting themselves out<br><br>THEN we'll get a glimpse of Sanji's singed eyebrow in the very last panel of the chapter<br><br>then it'll switch to Luffytachi leaving with whoever is taking them to Zou<br><br>Chapter after that will show the supernovas all doing whatever they're doing<br><br>THEN we get to Sanjitachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wano you mean, and guess where Kinemon came from</br>  <br>Nigga you even party?</br>  <br> A country with swordsman so strong that the WG and Yonko avoid it. <br><br>Not true at all.<br><br>Wano are all Kaidou's bitches and they even lost the corpse of their national hero.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shonen series tend to be cheap. Just get used to it already.</br>  <br> &gt;CP0 is returning to the island to capture Sabo and other revolutionaries. In a day or two Dressrosa will be packed with people. He advises the Strawhats to leave as early as possible.  <br>Confirmed no party.</br></br>   CP0 is after Sabo and the revs <br>Have they at least tried to contact the goddamn Admiral currently on the island?<br><br>Aren't these organizations on the same side?</br></br></br>  Well shit, when was the last time Zoro ever looked this happy?  If they needed totanna slave labor to make devil fruits, why didn't they turn them into toys?  <br>the same thing happened at PH though<br><br> people are coming after us so we have to leave quickly <br> so it's Party time! </br></br></br></br>  <br>would negate their insane power?</br>  <br> Aren't these organizations on the same side? <br>Not really. Cipher Pol is a totally different organization than the Marines.</br></br>  <br>There hasn't been a good party since Sky Island</br>  <br>You forgot about Fishman Island.</br>  <br> New formed pirate alliance between Kid, Apoo, and Hawkins. <br> Bonnie wanted by the government. <br> Those Wizard of Oz theories. <br> Doffy is controlling all of them. <br><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN? ITS STARTING TO COME TOGETHER.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wano are all Kaidou's bitches and they even lost the corpse of their national hero <br>That just helps establish that they're a) a culture in decline and b) that Kaidou is a serious threat to hold such powerful warriors under his thumb.</br></br>  <br>The fact that Ace was created solely to die makes me almost as angry as the fact that Sabo was only made to just replace him after he died. Right down to the same fucking fruit powers</br>  <br> Doflamingo is awakened paramecia <br> has the power to pull metaphorical strings </br></br>  <br> he sank in the sea Dragon came and rescued him <br><br>Well fuck, the "wind" Dragon used to rescue the Goa hobos may just be monstrous CoC haki.</br></br></br>  <br>thing is, Ace is almost certainly going to be reborn into a new character. His 'will' has probably been passed on to Makino's child</br>  <br> He asks the leading crow if they're ready to sail, and the crow answers "NEVERMORE". </br>  <br>Nope, CP works under the Gorosei, CP0 goes even beyond and works directly under the Tenryuubito. One Piece government works just as Imperial japan in ww2, every branch of the militar forces is too proud to coordinate with another.</br>  <br>forget it, just saw the raw</br>  <br> crow <br>Literally the poem is called The Raven.</br></br>  <br>cp0 doesn't work for the gorosei, they serve only the tenryubito which is why akainu mentions how they let the dogs of the tenryubito go over their (gorosei's) heads</br>    so what bullshit is going to be luffy's awakening?  <br>at least we get 5 consecutive chapters now before the break instead of 4</br>  <br>I'd say what Gear 4th already is.<br><br>Retaining his elasticity seems to be the best option, just pulling something new outta Luffy's ass hopefully won't be the solution.<br><br>Unless its balla.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>making other thing elastic</br>  <br> at least we get 5 consecutive chapters now before the break instead of 4 <br><br> Oda is now smoking an extra pack. <br> He is getting even closer to the grave now. <br><br>ripip Oda, we will never see the end of One Piece now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if he can turn things into rubber for a moment, then he can use haki to manipulate the environment <br>so he could actually have robin like powers, imagine a giant rubber/rock haki fist</br></br>  <br>Come on anon, it's not like Oda's been hiding it or anything.</br>  <br>Why is this a chapter when the new movie/special is going to be exactly that?</br>  <br>Because the special isn't canon and Oda isn't about to bring a character that's supposed to be dead for about 20 years and say nothing about it.</br>   "...Well, shit" <br>Fucking Niggastream</br>  <br>Best fight in the manga. Hands down.</br>  <br>They're fuckups but sometimes they fuck up so well.</br>  Does this mean we're getitng a chapter tonight? As in a day earlier?  <br>Where do you get your updates about Oda's smoking habits? People always quote how much they think he smokes without ever giving any reason. I'm inclined to believe you're bullshitting.</br>  <br>Crocodile, he can drain moisture from a MASSIVE area and create sandstorms that can travel across an entire country.<br>Luffy, I'm fairly certain that those gears are ridiculously hax.</br></br>  <br>Traditionally samurai carry 2 swords but only use 1, so I dont think he usually dual wields. He does against the birdcage because he needs more surface area to push.</br>  <br>Wano you mean.</br>  <br>It's kind of strange how I like the Heart Pirates although I don't know much about them. How much do people love Kid's crew? Like not just Killer. His crew.<br><br>And I also want to know why Kid's epithet is "Captain". Wait, does Bepo have an epithet? How much is his bounty even? Damn, now I'm curious about the wanted posters of the other crews.</br></br></br>  <br> Where do you get your updates about Oda's smoking habits? <br><br>Whenever Oda works hard he smokes hard. The man is a pack a day smoker.<br><br>He's working an extra week now before breaks, do the math.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Flawless logic is flawless.</br>  <br>Zou is part of Wano Kingdom, no?<br><br>same diff</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh my god a sleeping Law. OH MY GOD</br></br></br>  <br>Zou is Kaido's island</br>  <br>I dont know about anyone else but im kind of attached to Heat and Wire<br><br>they're cute</br></br></br>  <br>Kidd and Law are the only other Supernova captains with crews that seem like they actually have personality.</br>  <br> Kaido on Elephant island <br><br>Well i guess we know what kind of beast he is</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where the hell is Cavendish?</br></br>  <br>Bepo has a bounty of 500.</br>  PANDA OUT!  <br>Probably wrapped in chains, there's a fucking good reason people DON'T want to sleep near him.</br>  <br>I fucked up. Sorry, just reread the chapter and it looks like I'm a fuckin moron.</br>  <br> The man is a pack a day smoker. <br>That is pretty casual and people call him a chain smoker? pffff</br></br>  <br>kek'd<br> New captcha! Mountains! </br></br>  <br>wow you must smell like a trashcan<br><br> Smoker please go </br></br></br>  <br>That cover photo. I want to know what it's about. What does the Wizard of Oz have to do with Doffy?</br>  <br>No</br>  Goddammit, I was not prepared for that.<br>And now I'm sitting here trying to hold back my tears.<br><br>Fate thread.</br></br></br>  <br> Fate thread <br> Posts Carnival Phantasm <br><br>Just call it a Type Moon thread, for fucks sake.</br></br></br></br>  Can I skip the UBW route if I've seen the anime or is there stuff that wasn't covered?  <br> Fate thread. <br>YES<br>WE NEEDED ANOTHER ON<br>NOT LIKE THIS BOARD HAS HAD ENOUGHE</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's stuff that wasn't covered.<br><br>Read it.</br></br></br>  <br>There can never be enough, anon.</br>  <br>No. Read it.</br>  <br>What? there is like no other fate thread beside this one.</br>      <br>Can't think of anything you're missing really.

It wouldn't really matter what kind of weapon he was wielding, since the death lines aren't affected by that. All that matters is if he can cut him, so Ea would be as effective as a letter opener. <br><br>He couldn't permanently kill Arc, especially at night, since she can't die unless the world dies. It's possible he could kill the world, and that might kill Arc, but he would burn out his mind in the process.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd have to disarm Gilgamesh first and steal Ea.Meaning would Shiki have to team up with Shirou in order to accomplish such a feat.</br>  <br>Prismafags generally like to make their own threads since they believe the TM fanbase looks down upon them for being lolicons.</br>  <br>Did you even browse the same board as I?

What of it?</br>  <br>it's oky if you donf get it<br>but but those who so, わかるわ</br></br>    <br>Is Nana Iroha?</br>  <br>8/10, I smiled but no giggle outta me.</br>  <br>The highschool days where P was an asocial, philosophical prick, Kaede was a flat unfluffy bitch and Anastasia was a boy.</br>  <br><br>Hugs and headpats for Minami.</br></br>  <br>Giant head, tiny hand.</br>  <br>Big heart</br>  <br>you forgot about KWSM thirsting for the P</br>  I want Syuko to turn Anya into a bad girl.  <br>I want Anya to turn Syuko into a good girl</br>  <br>Why so mad /a/ here I can put Rin with Kaede.<br><br>Even with Rin's slutty school uniform; still looks fluffy when Kaede wears it.</br></br></br>  <br>keep that hobo minx away from the Tsarevna</br>  <br>Rin looks like she belongs in the Manson family in that getup</br>  <br>It's the artist, the soft brushing and coloring makes it look so.</br>  <br>Too late.</br>  <br>Here is a genuine smile.</br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>It's never too late.<br><br><br>TakanASS</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is conflict in those blue eyes<br>She knows better</br></br>  <br>She will succumb to sweet temptation  Just like Sae. </br>  <br>Here's another genuine smile</br>  <br>Even Minami failed to convert her, the result will only remain the same</br>   skipped a grade and studied abroad at an American university <br> loves Tobasco and puts it all over her pizza <br> has a smell fetish and loves the aroma of young girls <br> creates her own "pheromones" in a garage <br> likes staying up late <br> is skilled at disappearing  <br> adorable nyahaha laugh <br> enjoys suspicious scientific experiments <br> wasn't initially scouted by producer, but actually approached him first to use him as a test subject <br>When is this perverted genius cutie going to make her anime debut?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> loves Tabasco <br>And you were so close to selling me on her too</br></br>  <br>Oh, come on. It's far from the best spicy sauce out there, but it's still surprisingly good taste for a Japanese girl.</br>  <br>sriracha is the superior sauce</br>  <br>I agree, but Shiki is still love.</br>  <br>while it makes sense most American hot sauces probably don't make it across the Pacific Ocean, I wouldn't call settling for Tabasco in a country where gochujang, sriracha, and chili oil are commonplace "good taste"<br><br>She just needs to be educated is all</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. She's a curious girl, so it would be easy to introduce her to the good stuff. She could probably make her own hot sauce if she tried too.</br>  Looks like the Anzu equivalent of that Kirari Wedding Strip.<br><br>Translator anon, if you're there. Please do.</br></br>  <br>Ichinose brand hot sauce<br> It's just her pussy juice </br></br>  <br>I'd put that on my pizza.</br>  <br>but sriracha is just a meme sauce</br>  <br>Primaryfags or Secondaryfags, please enlighten me.<br><br>Does Anzu ever go dere (for Producer or her fellow idols)? Does she always act like a no good not-really-NEET lazy cunt?<br><br>I can imagine all of the other Project girls having a tender moment or two, but the only thing I see Anzu doing is going "fuck this shit" and sleeping in some corner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can I get some of this<br><br>Anzu gets broken</br></br></br>  <br>She does, actually.</br>  <br>She gets Mind broken.<br><br>She does genuinely enjoy and have fun working post-character development.<br><br>Not that she'll say it out loud though. Gotta keep up her NEET image after all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>odd<br>she doesn't look like an ugly little shit in the later cards<br>Is this the power of the P?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, she still would rather take it easy and have little to no work actually.<br><br>But it would be a lie to say that she doesn't enjoy what she does. Ever so slowly, that business smile of her is becoming a genuine smile.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really find a hard time imagining Producer having a moment with Kanako and Anya, those two are way too independent of him that I can't find a situation where they can bond without forcing their character out the window.</br>  <br><br>Tabasco... it's one of the most famous hot sauces due to age and brand recognition. Being a Lousiana style sauce it's uses fermented vinegar and is focused on heat instead of flavor.<br><br>Sure, I'd be even more impressed if she made her own Habanero or Carolina Reaper hot sauce, but that last one would be suicidal on the scoville scale.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that butt peek is not erotic and she doesn't look amazing on second card altogether </br>  <br><br>I'm torn.<br><br>Part of me wants an episode of classic AnKira hijinks. But part of me also wants an episode where TakeP makes Anzu live her life correctly and drags out a genuine egao from her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both can still happen on the same episode, 20 minutes is a long time. A-1 just has to sacrifice having NG on screen which isn't a big loss.</br>  <br>They definitely won't sacrifice anything for Anzu.</br>  <br> TakeP makes Anzu live her life correctly <br>This is not justice.</br></br>  <br>This is where everything backfires.<br> Producer promises that the Anime focus won't be based on popularity   which was an obvious god damn lie <br> Anzu is the second most popular CG <br>Must suck.</br></br></br></br>  Soon...<br><br> yeah, probably not this card in particular, but whatever. </br></br>  <br>That's a cute team</br>  <br>An Anon in the previous thread suggested a stargazing episode with Producer and Anya which I think would be really nice</br>  <br> Some boys dream of being Heroes of Justice <br> TakeP just wanted to give people genuine smiles <br>GARcher is old and busted<br>TakeP is the new hotness</br></br></br></br>  <br>A true hero.</br>  <br>Honestly, even in the games, Kanako is kind of flat, even when compared to the other CG girls. <br><br>Her character is basically Haruka but everything else but her love for making sweets is removed. Also, she became fat. There hasn't been any substantial change or notable introspection into Kanako's character.<br><br>Anastasia is an airheaded romantic. Not in the filial way, but in the classic connotation. In the games and Theatres, we see that she is quite thankful for Producer. Anya is honestly pretty friendly with everyone so she meshes well with most people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to be based on overall popularity.</br>  <br>It'd be more entertaining than what she does now  ie: nothing </br>  <br>I want to see her eat a ghost chili.</br>  <br>that's probably why she is doing very well compared others, she got some nice popularity boost when they changed her tone but I guess it's not enough.</br>  <br>Most normalfags I've talked to regarding that found her to be the most eyecatching of the bunch, she's arguably one of the most popular even within CG as a whole, but as the other guy said, anime focus isn't based on popularity.<br>Apparently, anyway,</br></br>  <br>What "experiments" does she do exactly?</br>  <br>I'd imagine that to be put into a NOMAKE, with Producer pointing out constellations and Anya naming them, much to her glee.</br>  <br>Whatever catches her interest and keeps her entertained. Shiki doesn't need petty things like "ethics" or "moral boundaries".</br>  <br>What about the crazy French girl with the awful voice?</br>  <br>Reminds me of this old pasta<br><br> Anya's focus episode <br> Love Laika is fairly popular now <br> Big Live upcoming with Love Laika performing in it <br> Minami injures her leg in a Lacrosse match <br> Anya must perform alone, thankfully she has a new solo song; You're stars shine on me. Management decides its a good time to debut the song. <br> Anya freaks out at the prospect of performing alone <br> TakeP tries to reassure Anya, asks her what are things that she likes <br> Anya mentions Zvezda and shit <br> Concert finally begins, Anya starts singing You're stars shine on me. <br> JUST ALIVE HOSHII-- then suddenly the concert lights shut off and the crowd switches their glowsticks into a pale blue <br> Anyavision sees the crowd as a starry night sky. <br> TakeP: Keikaku Doori <br> Anya is now slightly wetter for TakeP <br><br>Well, this pasta was made before episode 13, so I imagine that they can't pull the "Minami is incapacitated" card again. Still, it's not that hard to set up a situation where Anya would be nervous and so Producer will have to take measures to calm her down. The "glowstick = stars" shtick is a crucial part of Anya's romantic character so if she's getting a focus episode, I imagine they'll play up this part of her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fred's voice is cute, just like her.</br>  <br>While they didn't show it well, they did hint that she was nervous during their first ever performance, she quickly got over it too. Her independence is what loses her screentime I guess.<br><br><br>Her singing voice is decent and her speaking voice is pretty cute with the "fu~fu~" stuff</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's batshit insane</br>  <br>Anime Focus is Scamco trying to make Rin be Chihaya 2.0, except she's not<br> I like Fukahara, but Rin just doesn't do it for me </br></br>  <br>And I love it.<br>Wouldn't have her any other way.</br></br>  <br>Fukuhara herself is great and I can tell she's trying her best, but Rin isn't my cup of tea.</br>  <br>That's because she had Minami with her.<br><br>Going solo might freak her the fuck out.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you like cake or loli or russian hookers or dookie?</br>  <br><br>Fukuhara is actually insecure about her singing and the marketing of scamco of Rin as Chihaya 2.0 really puts alot of pressure on her.<br><br>When she received a fan message where the fan said that her singing was great, she ended up in tears.<br><br>I fucking hate Rin, but Fukuhara is a good person.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin looks so genuinely happy here that she actually comes across as pretty cute</br>  <br>Why's Kaede hanging out with those losers?</br>  <br>I'm an Eyedol kind of guy, but Anya is my absolute favorite regarding that.<br><br>But really, I like all the CG's. Don't get me wrong when I say Rin isn't my cup of tea, I like her but she's not close to being a favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>More than that, when the fuck did she bleach her hair?</br>   Precure Thread   MANA DA BES  When you realized that precures aren't real?  <br>at being a shit.</br>  Twilight is dead.

But seriously I think the anime needs a villian that is just as tough as MiSu ( or Suzukigun or Bullet Club in general) to oppose the cures.</br>  <br>But in all seriousness, You are right Mr. Suzuki gonna need his stable but it's is still not enough to bully 40+ Precures or any Magical girl groups at all!!!</br>  <br> Yaranaika? </br>  ON a unrelated note, Do you think a beast will bully the Precures Like BROCK LESNEAR.  I love this expression.  So i watched an episode of Precure (Smile Precure) for first time and let me say this is fucking embarrassing to watch and i am so ashamed of myself because i kinda liked it.  <br>Smile is extra kiddy, yeah.</br>  <br>Smile is probably the most childish feeling Precure, but it's fun.

I guess in this case they might have thought that people would cheer at seeing Regina get her ass handed to her, but I think that's a longshot. After all, they worked so hard to build her up as a sympathetic villain who's torn between the two sides.  <br> thought that people would cheer at seeing Regina get her ass handed to her <br><br>I did.</br></br></br>  <br>YuuYuu as a boy will get all girls.</br>  <br>This bitch.</br>    <br>But how will Mana become the Prime Minister? Surely she doesn't want to be the PM of the White Niggas?</br>  Geez, that scream.<br><br><br>Yeah, and the same way, Ace probably had instant fans despite her coming out of nowhere to kick asses. Underdogs just get their appeal through relatability, while watching an ultra-strong character just win over and over with no real struggle gets more from self-insertion or vicarious victories.<br><br>Or I suppose you might've just hated her and loved to see her suffer. If you were a horrible person, I mean.</br></br></br></br></br>  Right, Toei. Because this worked so smoothly and naturally before.  Wow, she really is just as naggy (if not more) than Mana. Is the rest of the year going to be a giant bitch-off?  Daily Minamin!! Take care of your Pafus  <br> But how will Mana become the Prime Minister? Surely she doesn't want to be the PM of the White Niggas? <br>She isn't white that's already half the job done.</br></br>  <br>No, she goes soft once she falls in love with Mana.</br>  wut<br><br><br>Man, I don't even know whether that's better or worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Better, she gets to be very cute later.</br>  HAHAH, oh wow.<br><br>I love how the villains are all "We'll get you next time, Cure Ace!" instead of pissing themselves because she's so powerful that she could probably kill them instantly any time she wanted.</br></br>  The second coming of Madokami.  <br>That's not even accurate. She gets better in episode 27 when she finally gets a real focus episode of her own which has little to nothing to do with Mana.</br>  Well that wasn't so cute. Why you so Karen?<br><br><br>Yeah, for the moment she's a bit of a mess. I'm sure they meant for her to be a little hated, with how harsh she is. Makes sense that getting to know her would soften her up, but there's not much room to go the other way and still be a good.</br></br></br>  <br>It does make a bit more sense at the end of the series, but that's no excuse for how they did it.</br>  <br>It's not the sudden appearance of an ultra-powerful character so much as feeling like they wasted so much good build-up with Regina. I can appreciate swerving, but if you watch Suite or Fresh, there's no sense that they wasted time developing tension that was just thrown away in the end.  Miyuki was built up, but nothing near the level of that lava pit scene, and Beat/Muse was a surprise without sacrificing anyone in particular. </br>    <br>She is hardly ultra-powerful.</br>  <br>Tokimekinasai!</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ikU<wbr>oVVAT8Fo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br>Regina was one of the few things I actually liked about Doki, and they do this to her.</br></br></br>  <br>My heart is not aflutter.</br>  <br>"Get Hype" was the best translation I saw for that line.</br>  <br>Regina was poorly handled, but that isn't saying much in one of the worst seasons of Precure.</br>  <br><br>I dunno, Miyuki was obviously a red herring in Fresh. Everything about the idea of her as a Cure was done in a tongue-in-cheek manner outside of that one scene where Tarte was having a breakdown, and even that wasn't entirely serious since he was digging through a basket of donuts to find Akarun.</br></br>  <br> Doki <br> bad </br></br>  <br> meme arrows will change reality </br>  <br> meme arrows <br>It sure is summer. Hawawa~</br></br>  <br>Aguri doesn't really get better, she just gets different kinds of bad.<br>She's very much stuck in her ways and only really starts to see things through the eyes of her team members in the last couple of episodes.</br></br>  <br>Did you already forget HaCha?</br>  <br>HaCha had Hime. Automatically better than DokiDoki.</br>  <br>Yes, very<br><br>HaCha was a sillier show and it succeeded in that. Better characters, a more unique theme, more consistent story.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm just from /jp/, relax.</br>  <br>have you done your daily kanji reps?</br>  <br>Hogwash. Every focus episode for her was about her changing and growing as a person.</br>  <br> changing and growing as a person <br>I see what you did there.</br></br>  <br>She did neither of those. To the very end she was an unsympathetic murderous psycho phony know-it-all.<br>She learned how to eat carrots, but that was the extent of it.</br></br>  <br>top kek</br>      Would deadpool improve your favorite season?  <br>Actual Deadpool or the lol so randumb deadpool?</br>  <br>Nope, every single episode where she forces development down the girls throats she too changes slightly. And the largest example I can think of is the culture fest episode where Mana gets sick and she realizes how Mana's style of leadership works. I can see how you'd hate her if you love Regina though; but only if you completely missed the point that the two of them are programmed to kill each other and emerge as the one true existence. Regina's just as much an "unsympathetic murderous psycho phony" if you look at it that way.</br>    <br>Yuuyuu has some big shits.</br>  <br> I can think of is the culture fest episode where Mana gets sick and she realizes how Mana's style of leadership works <br>That's not character development. She didn't grow from that experience in the slightest and acted exactly the same as before.</br></br>  <br>Or you didn't notice or acknowledge her change.</br>  <br>You're wrong.</br>  <br>It's been a while since I last saw this post.</br>  <br><br>Why does it always bring up dog faces?</br></br>  <br>Dogs were one of the things it was heavily trained to recognize with large image libraries.</br>  So, uh, is there a reason the magical seeds look and act like sperm?    <br>They're musical notes</br>  <br>Can we train it to recognize cures?</br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Today's theme is Precure's favorite karate bugman, Mr. Bunbee!

No one on /a/ should be so much of a pleb that they ruin the entire watching experience just because they want to watch it 5 minutes after it airs, that sort of behaviour is for people who post on anime forums and who actually pay funi and crunchy to watch their shit.</br></br>  <br>Probably not, but AT-X doesn't censor the hand movements and crap like the Mushroom licking girl</br>  Actually, checking again it seems Ohys and anything that uses them also has that weird censorship.  Which is annoying because I actually liked Funi's script better that Hiryuu, so things like Senketsu and Clawhammer are out.   <br>How's AnimeRG?</br>  <br><br>Using the uncensored broadcast and Senketsu subs.</br></br>  <br>Would it really be so bad to just get Ohys and Senketsu?</br>  All the raws i could find for episode 1 had the censorship, and funi's version had more censorship for whatever reason.  <br>I thought it was a banana.</br>  <br>I think they only have one episode out so far. Even then, it is still partially censored</br>  <br>That seems to be the middle ground, better than Funi eyecancer but still with some shitty censoring.</br>  <br>You do realize that the "uncensored" version still still censored.
