[ Eizan takes the bait like a 5 year old. You didn't even try,tsukuda.  How could this manga turn into such a pile of shit in less than 20 chapters? <br>Nakama power victories, 1:1 Bleach Aizen turned into the edge lord of cooking, Erina damsel in distress bullshit, Eizan will become th biggest jobber in history, and to top it all off no sexy foodgasm from Rindou.</br>  Is this jumping the shark? I guess it had to happen sometime like Ass Class and Nisekoi did. So much for Jumps new age of hits. Everything petered out but not nearly as bad as Toriko did. They pushed that one reall hard even putting the due up with legends like Goku and Luffy. Does anybody even give a shit about Gintama now that the author went full retard and turned it into a full action shounen for about fifty chapters already?  <br>Is the second year the point where a WSJ goes to shit (if not sooner like Nisekoi)?<br>Did any manga avoid this in WSJ?</br></br>  You may not like it, but Eizan has literally always been like this. Look back on whenever he's been involved in something. He's an idiot.  Japan likes this arc. This thread needs to calm down.  <br> Japan likes this arc <br> We must like it as well <br><br>FUCK OFF</br></br></br></br>  <br>SnS turned into shit in it's third year.</br>  <br>Japan also likes Gundam SEED and I think they need to fuck off.</br>  MERELY<br>PRETENDING</br>  <br>Oh yeah.<br>Man, the tournament arc was fucking huge.</br></br>  <br>This arc is great, Westerners can't into strict families with powerful names, it doesn't carry over the same effect for them. <br>Souma is just being Souma, and this is the first real bad guy, I think majority of faggots like/relate to Eizan's half baked personality built on being money hungry :^)</br></br>  <br> does anybody give a shit about Gintama <br>maybe the people who have been reading it for 10+ years and are now seeing the conclusion to the story, yeah. Gintama has always been a mixture of serious action arcs, and goofy gags. It's not out of character for it to be serious.</br></br>  <br>Also the majority of people are still hooked on Gary Stu, gotta win all tournaments / battles. <br>It's pretty clear unsatisfied readers have inferiority complexes they don't want to vicariously feel in muh cooking manga.</br></br>  This arc is great. /a/ is full of faggots.  <br>Readers are pissed off because Soma turned into a Gary Stu saved from "muh expulsion threat" once again through plot armor and Eizan turned into a jobber, even though he should already have won this rigged match.</br>  <br><br>I'm referring to the people who're saying Souma is dying and will no longer be a hit. It'll do fine in sales. Also, this arc is great.</br></br>   turning off another cook's stove <br>I am physically mad.</br>  <br> Nakama power victories <br>T-that was a cute moment. you faggot.</br></br>  <br>People are mad because it Eizan went "hurr durr did you call me a chicken faggot" when he should have already won the match. Even if something like this was due to happen, that's the laziest way the writer could come out with to make Souma win.</br>  <br>Dropped it after they killed the friggin shogun</br>  <br> No Rindou foodgasm <br>Her foodgasm's cumming from Souma</br></br>  Does anyone feel anything about Eizan? Is he a good villain? <br>Giganigga made me mad as shit and I felt relived when Souma crushed him. But Eizan is just annoying, I don't hate him, I don't want to see him being destroyed, I just think "oh please remove this guy and let's go to something more interesting already".</br>  <br>Wait, so people are pissed because it's a telegraphed victory, with the chapter not even out yet.. the story could easily go that way or not, kinda screwed expectations. <br>If you wan't it that way, Souma will graduate with high honours, taking at least top 2 in Tootsuki's record. He also had a Shougeki with best girl, where she comes to terms with her feelings about Souma and confesses. <br><br>woo woo, expectations.</br></br></br></br>  <br> strawmanning this hard <br> the story could easily go that way or not <br>Stop sucking the writer's dick,it's obvious where the story is going</br></br></br>  <br>I want Souma to lose the Shokugeki.<br>Then leave the school behind and explore the vast world of cooking!</br></br>  <br>Have to start pandering to the majority of their fans (aka casuals). They can't stand anything deviating from the status-quo hence why it's now following standard shounen trope. It just works.</br>  <br>Stopped reading it at this face. You already know how it's gonna go.<br>Fuck Azami for bringing all this useless bullshit.</br></br>  Ugh, literally Fairy Tail with food. Fuck you people who thought this was interesting. I bet you think Magi or Nanatsu no Taizai won't devolve into this level of bullshit,too.  <br>It's been known since Souma cooked for Isshiki that he would change the school. We all know he's going to be some god of cooking.</br>  Wait, there are people who thought SnS wasn't a generic shounen from the start?<br><br> stubbornly strong willed MC <br> it was implied MC's dad was super strong/skilled <br> cooking "battles" where the MC nobody has even heard of is beating all these elite chefs <br> if those weren't obvious enough, there's a fucking tournament arc to throw it right in your face <br><br>anyone who is getting mad at the direction the manga took with the whole Azami take over and "muh unique shounen" is most likely an anime-onlyfag or has the reading comprehension of a two year old.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but there are good generic shonens like One Piece and bad generic shonens like Naruto and Fairy Tail. We all thought that SnS is a good one, but Azami arc ruined it completely.</br>  <br>How do I become a prophet like you fami?<br>Can you lay out the complete journey for us. Current arc as predictable as it is, doesn't mean developments are set in stone, why do you even follow weekly manga's then..</br></br>  <br>Umm SnS isn't shounen</br>  <br>What?</br>  Quality.  What's your favorite stand, /a/?<br> mine is pic related </br>  <br>God no, get that thing away from me.</br>  <br>Well, with Hayato I can understand why, it was actually in line with the art style of his back then. Tsurugi seems to clash with Josuke, Jobin, Norisuke or Joushuu, it's like they're from two different worlds.<br><br>As to the inspiration, it does look like it comes from Nara. It just bothers me a bit, it's all.</br></br></br>  Who would win?  <br><br>This was a wasted "Daiya eats parfait" opportunity.<br><br>Also, that's looks so delicious.</br></br></br></br>  <br> doc </br>  About 2 hours to go till episode 8 and still no thread?

Also spoilers from moon readers scare most people away.</br>  <br> camus <br>Stop that</br></br>  <br>The only ones here actually watching this are the ones who watched the first season 9 years ago. There's only a handful of us left, everyone else either abandoned 4chan or died.</br>  <br>But I watched the first season a week after watching false masks first episode. After the third false mask episode, I imported it and played that.</br>  <br>Yeah, but still. <br><br>What spelling faction do you belong to?</br></br></br>  <br>I troll when I spell it camus</br>  <br>Not remotely true. I'm one of many anons who basically read the description for the show on an 'upcoming anime' chart, saw the words, "sequel to 2006 series" and marathonned the first show/first game in preparation. <br><br>I finished the old show in time for episode 1, and just beat the old game yesterday.</br></br></br>  <br>Meeting sis?</br>  <br>Why is the bird so smug?</br>  <br>In the English BD subs, I think it's actually spelled Camius. I prefer that to the mirrormoon game translation, Kamyu.</br>  <br>It's currently winning the HakuBowl.</br>  On the poll, last time I saw it, Haku, Oshutoru, Eruruu, Kuon, Hakuoro were all in top 10  <br><br> tfw I discreetly downloaded some episodes of the first show through Kazaa on the school's computers while on a transfer in Canada in 06 <br><br>I feel so fucking old while typing this</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this face trying to convey?</br>  <br><br>Hopefully, a footrub.</br></br>  Poll of the day: Did she deserve it?  <br>Is it true that hakuoro's  level affects the strength of the final boss? </br>  <br>Yeah. Don't overlevel him or the last battle's a pain.</br>  <br>She would have met a more gruesome end if it weren't for Hakuoro. She got off easy.<br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sort of? In a way she's just as much a victim of circumstances as everyone else, since Diy (or however you spell his name) was manipulating things behind the scenes. Poor girl never even realized she was just a puppet ruler.</br>  So I decided to replay the game, anime, specials, and OVA. It aged decently. And the differences between the game and the adaptations are interesting.<br><br>But picking Hard 3 was a mistake. I don't even want to think about Hard 5.</br></br>  <br>Monkeys</br>  <br><br>Shit, that's pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>The monkeys were okay because it was only Hakuoro and Teoro. Checking turn order on 18 units is a pain in the ass.</br>  OVA 1 gets full points for Karura and Uruto trying to kick each other's asses. As kids or not.<br><br>Princesses, man. What's a Munto to do?</br></br>  <br>and so have I</br>  <br>OVA 2 is great too.<br><br> mfw kurou is one of us </br></br></br>  <br>Of course not. <br> parents die; inherit the throne at absurdly young age <br> everyone in her vicinity in a position of power has their own ideals, and direct influence over her thoughts and actions, for better (Hein, to an extent) or worse (the Left General, the attendant,   Hein )<br> signs off on whatever she is convinced will ensure the survival of the bunny-people race <br> did (Not) ask for EVAs <br><br>Why do the cutest girls always get the most fucked up end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kokopo is a female</br>  ETA until [DameDesuYo]?  <br>They usually release 24 to 30 hours after the episode aired.</br>  <br>Confirmed in game?</br>  <br>It can't be helped.</br>  <br>Thank you. I usually wait for them.<br><br><br>I think Rurutie says something in episode 3.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  So how did Benawi know that Yamato would retreat?  <br>When did he say that?</br>  <br> He got a tip about Emperor's death </br>  <br>He said that? Where?<br><br><br>   Karura/Touka/Aruruu/Kamyu might have done something to poison him. <br><br>Holy fuck, if thats true. I'd like Haku to beat their shit for a good portion of the game. And to do so especially by wearing that mask and being reminiscent of their old lord.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He said that? Where? <br> Right when Munechika facing him off in the Tuskur battlefield he said something that's suggesting he knows what's happening in Yamato and that would make Munechika army pull back soon. <br><br> I doubt it's the 1st game main characters who poisoned the Emperor though since it's clear there's a third force at work who was controlling the zombie army, most likely the Uzurusha lord. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cameo character's can't be the main bad guy. That would be one hell of a twist though.</br>  <br>I think Aruruu is insane enough to do it but I did forget about zombie army this  mentions and  uzurussia kakaka faggot did escape </br>  <br>There's also the  super secret hidden passageway from the inn to the imperial palace. </br>  They made lulutie and nekone 1:1 figs.<br><br><br>I have this feeling lulutie will get the best false mask fig if multiple ones are made.</br></br></br>    Anyone else feel that the Yamato story is a lot more tragic than Tuskuru's?<br><br>If the two were to fight in the end, I feel like I'd be rooting for Yamato all the way.</br></br>  <br><br>Are they gonna sell those? Do their clothes come off?</br></br>  <br>Maybe after the event for like a gorillion dollars. 3D printed that shit.</br>  <br> Anyone else feel that the Yamato story is a lot more tragic than Tuskuru's? <br>much more.<br><br>Tuskuru got their cake and pretty much ate it. Hakuoro got sealed but thats it. He didnt die.<br><br>Yuzuha died but she would have anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone said that the first anime series was a bad adaptation. I went through like, 20 hours of VN, Advanced Wars-style strategy RPG and the occasional oddly pleasant ero scene to confirm that they lied super hard. <br>It's, with two tiny exceptions I can think of, an actual 1:1 adaptation. <br><br>Even the best bits that didn't make it into the anime are in the BD specials in all their morbid, comedic glory.</br></br></br>  <br>I've never seen anybody say that. Most people who play the game agree it's an excellent adaptation of the main plot only changing a few details and cutting out the porn and SoL.</br>  <br>I beg to differ.<br>Tuskuru had to start from scratch from building a country while being bullied by other big nations. Yamato prospered through their scientist Emperor. Then some human faggot had to be woken up and stir shit again while Tuskuru was at peace.<br><br>I hope to play as the Tuskuru side in 3, the idiots at Yamato are either boring or pathetic losers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The one that woke up Haku was Kuon though. </br>  <br> Haku <br> boring <br>literally most interesting character in series.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck her for falling in love with a human mongrel.</br>  <br>no kuon 1:1?</br>  <br>Just those two, yeah</br>  Same clothes...  <br>It's boring because you skipped all the text, right?</br>  <br> did (Not) ask for EVAs <br>She did (not) survive.</br></br>  <br>pottery</br>  <br>I just found the first series on an DVD I burnt back in 2006 - AVIs subbed by yesy in all their 360p poorly encoded glory.<br><br>Also had  Hoobastank  on there for some reason.</br></br></br>  <br>It was one guy a couple of threads ago. He was pretty adamant about it too. I just had to know. <br><br>I think the show did get in most of the sol stuff in anyways. It also did a much better job of fleshing out the entire Kunekamun arc. <br><br><br> Not only is she alive and  Eva free , but as depressing as it is, she's probably the happiest member of the surviving cast in her current state.<br/> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really treating "overcoming challenges" as tragic? Hakuoro's story was literally about him beating everyone who came to challenge his country. Moreover, his people were inherently strong - they could overcome him getting sealed. <br><br>Yamato was never as fortunate. Literally everyone is emotionally weak in one way or another. By the end of it all, everybody is left in despair.</br></br></br>  I'm incredibly late guys but there's gonna be suffering isn't there?  <br>At this point, I wouldn't hold my breath. We're a third of the way through the series and our death toll is 1 boat. And even that was played as a gag. <br>The only thing suffering here is the viewers.</br></br>  <br> Replaying the game <br> Hearing her beautiful weak voice <br>I'm fucking emotional right now.</br></br></br>  <br>OYAJI</br>  <br>Canteen guy. Also a bunch of people died on that boat.</br>   feet rub <br>Oy ve- Oh boy, deviantart and reddit's going to love this show!</br>  <br>Are you triggering me?</br>  <br>You gotta stop being so triggered, autist-kun.</br>  <br><br>This was amazing.<br><br>Man, I can't believe how it shoves the Anime's OP straight into a corner.<br><br>I hope the 2nd cour OP lives up to par with this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about canteen guy. And the boat deaths.<br>A lot of groundswell behind insect murder. <br><br>So I wanna say 22 people (canteen, bandit hideout raid, insects on a boat), several large insects, the boat, a golden figma, 4 desserts, a hard-earned kebab?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying that the deaths of nameless soldiers count as suffering. <br><br>Pls.</br></br></br>  Reminder that feet is the official fetish of Underwarer Ray Romano and if you say otherwise, you're an autistic normie that's better off hanged.

Sooner than we expected.</br></br>  <br> September <br>Literally one year, why even live?</br></br>  <br> It's pretty obvious that Haku is going to basically seem like Hakuoro second coming to Tuskuru as he has the mask and military strategy.  <br><br>I just want to know what the futari is. Kuon? If Hakuoro gets unsealed, I dont see it happening until the end.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty fast for a planned sequel.</br>  <br>Oh baby. <br>Next they'll announce that their time travelers have returned from their missions in both the past and future to cancel the localization of the second game, in order to speed up work on the third.</br></br>  <br>I believe Haku has no reason to attack Tuskuru. He must deal with Yamato's situation first.<br>However, there's chance that Tuskuru may attack Yamato because they're starting the war.</br></br>  <br>I hope Atlus says something about false mask next week at PSX</br>  <br> I believe Haku has no reason to attack Tuskuru. <br> His brothers will to reverse curse and Yamato needs a direction which was invading Yamato. <br><br>Tuskuru is trying to defend, I dont think they are in position to attack.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guest we have to play the third game to find out.</br>  <br> Japanese <br> White. <br>Kuck.</br></br></br>  <br>RIP in peace hard-earned kebab.</br>  <br>I'm so nervous.

That'd be crazy.</br>  <br>Could it be?<br><br>These ten years of waiting was actually for the development of two games, not one?</br></br></br>  <br>Oshutoru confirmed he's dead but like hell I could believe that. I want to see his rotten corpse.</br>  <br>Yes, the development of the third game was done simultaneously with the second one.</br>  <br>He doesn't even leave a corpse nigga.

Otherwise, it's great.</br>  so the next utawarerumono subtitle is called 二人の白皇 or Two Hakuoros. That implies a lot of things...  <br>What if Kuon becomes a White Emperor too?</br>  Who else is looking forward to Hakuoro getting autism-headbutted and gangraped as soon as he comes back?  <br>Well Kuon ascending to the throne would make her White King since her father was the original.</br>  <br> two emperors <br>This is sort of what everyone predicted?  The first half of the game is making Haku emperor and the second is confronting Kuon. I wonder if Kuon will be over the Haku dying because of Oshutoru thing. </br></br>  I know Oboro is an idiot but he has some pretty cool lines.  <br>Eruru looks so ugly with the new art.</br>  <br>Would you rather have constant shitposting or slow on topic threads?</br>  <br>Anyone's buying this?</br>  <br>This was a preview release thread.

Atui's sex adventure next week  <br>My dick -ya~e</br>    <br>What.<br><br>Sexy princess is a bewildering concept.</br></br></br>  <br>Because their fetish is the most normalfag fetish in the world, they have a superiority complex with them and act really hostile and defensive whenever someone calls their fetish out for what it is (see this entire thread ). They are scum on par with furfags and bronies.</br>    <br>Vocal fetishfags of any kind are usually obnoxious, the difference is in how many there are I guess.

Wouldn't it be more accurate if Aruruu and Kamyu were Kuon's aunt since they were Yuzuha's best friends? Actually Aruruu can pass as a sister since Hakuoro was her dad but still.

Then there's Touka, Oboro, Benawi, Eruruu, and Urutorii. Karura and Kurou might be the only easygoing type.<br><br>How terrifying.</br></br>  <br><br>That was actually my rationale when I made this ss and posted it ~a month ago.</br></br>  <br>Benawi and Eruruu seems more like the strict but caring.<br>Urutorii would be outright motherly but not that spoiling.</br></br>   Kamyu and Aruru are still retards hitting 30   <br>It's ok cause they're rich and furry people</br>  <br>I dunno man with how badly she wanted a baby, even going so far as to kidnap someone else's.</br>  <br>They took a hit to their INT stat in exchange for their supernatural talents.</br>  <br>That wouldn't really change how she would raise her baby.<br><br>It does show that she's full mama bear</br></br></br>  <br>They're super caring because  Kuon is Yuzuha's child, and the three of them were extremely close in the original. </br>  <br>To be fair I think Kamyu only chose wis as her dump stat as to cast all the magic she does she does need int.</br>  <br>Sure thing, buddy.</br>    cute   BR box at rank 1000 on amazon. <br><br>Tumbling! start soon, plot</br></br>  <br>Skewers are the shit</br>  <br>It had an amazing first few episodes then slowed down. We still have about three more episodes of world building with the plot kicking in in the second cour.</br>   Aruruu and Kamyu disgusted by fujoshit. <br><br>Nice</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>i want to ruffle his hair</br>  Sekushii  I wish they were still traveling. Baths are nice but some plot would be welcome. Haku starts to annoy me too.  <br>More like it was subpar at first and became garbage once it turned into bathing simulator and girl of the week introductions.</br>  Looks like Kamyu inherited a bit too much Mutsumi. Touka's maybe half a head taller than all of them, and Uruto was around the same height I think. Time to go check Touka against Eruruu and Uruto.  <br>It's weird.<br><br>I dont know why they're going in this order. Maybe they want the second cour to be amazng.<br><br>I'm positive that the dekoponpo boat mission and meeting Aruruu and Kamyu were supposed to be after the Uzurussia war.</br></br></br></br></br>  Aruru is<br> christmas cake <br> retarded <br> dog girl <br> war hero <br> ambassador <br> high nobility <br> totally straight <br> virgin </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So the comfy ride continues until at least next week. I'm guessing last episode of first cour is going to start the invasion?  <br>I never played the game but from anime i figure the first half is about baths in capital and then they conquer other countries so the can bath there?</br>  <br> saving herself for her papa </br>  <br>Last episode of cour one will start the plot where Haku meets the emperor in front of the generals and he gets the chocovanilla twins from them. Some of the generals are mad as fuck. Uzurussia probably right after.<br><br>kakaka v2</br></br></br>  Please tell me Haku does something interesting during this show at some point. Underwater Ray did interesting things, I want to see overwater Ray do something cool.  <br><br>If you hate it that much, why are you in a thread about it?</br></br>  This episode was AMAZING<br> Kokopi and Mukkuru becoming bros <br> Haku misunderstanding Kuon <br> This episode also proved they have secret hand gestures to talk to each other covertly  <br> Haku being dragged around by Kamyuu and Aruru, paying for all their shit <br> He brings them to a random bookstore because he's convinced Kuon's an idiot  <br> Its a fucking Yaoi bookstore <br> KUON IS IN THERE FOR THE SAME REASON <br> Kokopi and Mukkuru's tearful goodbye <br> The nod to their older sisters <br>So many great moments in this episode, god fucking damn</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>He does a good amount of interesting things.<br><br>They just need to get to the fucking battles and wars and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He gets his official mask  near the end. </br>   If you make Kuon cry <br><br><br>FORESHADOWING</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't he basically just reinvent the fucking hot-air balloon and even that's at the end of 2nd cour?</br>  I wonder if they gonna animate 3rd game too.  <br>Like the middle. But he's based tactician for every single battle.</br>  <br>And she can understand what animals say. Some of them anyway.</br>  <br>read the thread</br>   ANN review rated both episode 8 and 9 as terrible <br> I thought both were awesome <br>Why do I bother with that place for anything besides news</br></br>  HOW IS SHE SO CUTE LADS  <br>They probably never watched the first season or played the game(s)</br>  <br>It's just the whining about not enough action. I liked episode 8.<br><br>Got to wait for sex twins.</br></br></br>  <br>To be honest if I didn't know how amazing the first series was and good things are still to come I might have gotten bored at this point too. It's good but doesn't live up to the original, at least not yet.</br>  <br>I bet they're the same people who rated Steins;Gate shit as it was airing but then praised it highly when it was over.</br>  <br>Who the hell is censoring these pictures?</br>  <br>Y'know I never understood why these reviewers all seem to never watch or read the source material for anime adaptions. Seems like everyone just doesn't read the VNs or manga before something is made into an anime. Which is weird, because my impression is that quite a few writers at ANN know Japanese, at least from the smattering of articles I've read, so its not like them not being translated is an issue.<br><br>Could also just be the golden rule that most everybody has shit taste though.</br></br></br>  Where can i get the first series?<br>all torrents on nyaa are ded</br>    <br>ARMPIT<br>R<br>M<br>P<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just the whining about not enough action <br>It's a fair complaint. It's been a slow start, almost non-stop character introduction episodes with very little action or plot since arriving at the capital. <br><br>I don't mind it, but I can't blame people for getting frustrated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You either sort by seeders, try Baka BT, use XDCC or look in other trackers like AB.</br>  Is it just me or did they make Arururu sound less retarded? I get that she grew up but it was still a bit offsetting  <br>I wish that they would provide more background on Yamato's history instead of the SoL stuff we've been getting.</br>  That episode preview - I laughed too hard. Send help.  <br>Aruruu isn't retarded, she is just taciturn and a bit animal like</br>  <br>Will they make Haku pretend to be Oshtaru?</br>  <br>nah<br><br> Anju gets Nosuri to kidnap her so Oshutoru can save her. He doesnt. </br></br></br>  They are a married couple already. This is exactly like my meeting the parents episode.  <br><br><br>HOW THE FUCK DO WE STOP THE FUJOS?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not even that, the show just feels empty. Excluding all the strengthening of bonds and friendship, and old cast showing up, almost nothing has happened. I'm not expecting it to be like Hakuroro where they conquer a country, but something significant happening would be nice.</br>  <br>I didn't really notice a difference. The tone is exactly the same but she speak in more complete sentences maybe?</br>  <br>Haha, oh wow.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the episode?<br><br>They were disgusted by her fetish and are probably going to rush home to sic Erururu on her</br></br></br>  <br>How would mommy Eruru react to the fujo tide?</br>  <br> Ya'll mothafuckas need Hakuoro </br>  <br>yeah I think that was it. Currently halfway through Utawarerumono and watching it kind simultaneously it did make a significant difference</br>  <br>Scoldings<br>Forcing them to get awful medicine<br>Rape</br></br></br>  <br>Eruru rape? How does that work?</br>  <br><br>Pretty funny double standards.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't. Anon lives in a bizarro world since Eruru was the only girl who had sex with Hakuoro who didn't rape him.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? Yuzuha got consent.</br>  <br>Emotional blackmailing.<br><br>Eruru only got pity sex.</br></br></br>  <br>He was coerced my good man.</br>  That smug autism    <br><br>IIRC, Urutori also gave Hakuro permission to have comfort sex with her after she had to give that kid away.</br></br>  <br>Aruru is becoming smug.</br>  RIP Haku's wallet.  <br>Indeed. But when you got two gluttons, then what would you expect?<br><br>Also the whole episode was fun and the next one looks very promising.</br></br></br>  Bath Namek  <br>He got lucky Camus didn't have her other cravings.</br>  <br> volunteer <br> work <br>I think you messed up somewhere fundamentally.</br></br></br>  <br>WORD.<br><br>  Get reminded about those scenes with her in the game <br><br>Darn, those were good.</br></br></br></br></br>  this guy  <br>Don't you mean unlucky? I'd let her drain my semen any day.</br>    <br>No, she went "I'M GOING TO DIE BUT I WANT YOUR SPERM HAKUORO" and he was like "Well shit, okay."<br>No coercing involved.</br></br>  Goddamn these faces   Kamyu frantically running around and opening doors while searching for someone <br><br>It's like pottery. Also it makes me sad because her old teacher is probably dead now</br></br>  <br><br>I had a NTR doujin feel about him.</br></br>  <br>Munto seemed young enough to last another 20 years</br>  <br>touka and karura genderbender yaoi doujinshi in the bottom row</br>  <br>Not unless he was killed. Animal people have stupidly long lifespans.</br>  <br>I think I saw Oboro on one of the banners also.</br>  how is this a sustainable business?  <br>all the vampire romance stuff nowadays got replaced by Fujo.</br>  <br>BL is really popular with animal people, we've seen this already. Heck one of the Generals is a popular BL author. What I want to know is whether Kuon legitimately went in there unknowingly like Haku (which is really cute imo) or whether she's secretly a fujo also.</br>  <br>She said she walked in there to get away from them.</br>  <br>She could be lying, she is a known pervert after all</br>  So cool and amazing. Just like Mikazuchi.  Man, I love this show so much, it's so comfy and relaxing to watch.  <br><br>yeah but she's probably more into femdom</br></br>  <br> just liike mikazuchi </br>  Yup. One needs look no further than the preponderance of female flesh tossed up to see that we're back to Faffville, population tits, along with the second edition of "HEY, REMEMBER THESE CHARACTERS FROM THE FIRST GAME/ADAPTATION!? WELL, THEY HAVEN'T DIED OF HOOKWORM YET!" That's it. That's the entire purpose of the episode. There is nothing else. What the hell happened at this point in th source material? Was it just 8 straight hours of sitting there as a goddamned army of characters walked in the door, said hi, and walk back out?<br><br>And even better, these two are still completely mentally handicapped, because there aren't already about five other princess characters already filling that role. Instead of trying to paper over that, let's put it on goddamned display. Frame it and throw it up on a pedestal for the whole world to see. Okay, so one used to have the excuse of being a mentally deficient child. But a character changing in any way but height or chest size is anathema. Puberty is obviously a myth. Although I know that the real reason is because the writers are lazy, slackjawed, spineless pussies. Oh god, what if we try something? That's too damn dangerous. Rehash what's already out there! Rehash until the blood runs dry!</br></br>  Chuugakou is out.  <br>Is this a metaphor for FUCKING DEVIL SPAWNS?</br>    <br>It's Bert. Everyone pays attention to the Bert.</br>  <br>Oh.</br>  <br>  isayama not caring about sales <br>Levifags scariest nightmare</br></br>  Englishfag here. Titania Scans is still doing te manga, but hides the translations for 3 pages each chapter now. Anyone got them?  <br> hides the pages <br>what is it with shoujo scan groups and completely retarded policies? I saw one that was unavailable unless you joined their staff.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing because Imperial Scans and RedHawk Scans got taken down recently, everyone's shitting their pants<br> pic related </br></br>  <br> but hides the translations for 3 pages each chapter now. <br>What? I don't understand.<br><br>I was reading the quick translations on Mangalator until it went offline. Then completely forgot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it either.</br>  <br><br>Ok, shit. That's it.<br>Yona is one of the few manga I've been enjoying this year but I guess I'll have to drop it.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, that is some bullshit. I'm glad I know moon.</br>  <br> Mangalator until it went offline <br> Mangalator offline <br>Fuck.<br><br> Guess I'll have to drop it <br>That's why I'm wanting to know if anyone is in that group of members who are able to get a hold of them. <br>I dont want to drop it man :(</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3,925 registered members. <br>I think you'd have more luck anywhere but here.</br></br>  OP here. <br>After sailing the high seas, I found a way to see them. <br>You need to sign up on Titania Scans forums and write 10 posts. then you can gain access to them. <br>Should be in downloads, but ONLY FOR THE NEXT WEEK FROM WHEN IT WAS POSTED.<br>just tab between the translation and the page.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is some retarded shit</br>  Why is everything happening this month. I want out of November's wild ride.  <br>It's a good thing. Now the mangaka actually gets monetary support from the West. I don't get why you babies are crying about this</br>  Dropped  The Smug is dead.   Yu fucking overdoses <br>Sasuga Hakuya "m-muh kazoku" Yuu</br>  <br>I've been downloading this episode since the moment it was available. I'm only 71% complete.</br>  Guren is a hero we deserve  Wow Wit, nice job spoiling the next episode  This fucking guy  Sad harem  Shinoa could have been perfect had she not fall in love with Eren Jaeger #2. She's a generic cumdump now, and to think I thought about adding her to my g-fu listing  At this pace, the anime might end inline with the manga development    Who are they talking about    <br>This<br><br>She was literally perfect before her forced crush on a piece of generic shit like Yuu</br></br></br>  <br>Her design is so great. Best looking girl in the show.</br>    <br> Kimizuki's sister </br>  I found out that amazon.co.jp ships internationally now. I have no excuse to not buy this shit.<br><br>Not cheap, though. almost 200 bucks.</br></br>  This show has one of the most annoying MCs ever.  Omai dare grab collar?  <br>Is there a reason why you're buying the DVD instead of BD?</br>  <br>They all have great designs to be honest </br>  <br>smugs never die</br>  <br>He actually mellows out and stops being an edgelord.</br>  <br> I have no blue ray player. I should probably get one. </br>  So I've started reading manga, Seraph was the first manga I've ever read, and when I watch the anime, it's like I've already seen it. <br><br>Is it always like this, /a/? I don't even want to watch the anime anymore tb󠀀󠀀h.</br></br>    <br>Sounds like your average shounen to me then</br>  <br>Stop whoring for replies.</br>  <br>Thats why you watch the anime first, then can read through the manga faster</br>  <br> forced crush <br>i hate this so much</br></br>  <br>Is not about him being a edgelord or not, he is just plain annoying</br>  s this gay vampire with swords bullshit over? I mean comes on does yuu really have a hard time picking between anus or pussy?  <br><br>That is, honestly, why a lot of series drift into filler hell, or go all WE ANIME ORIGINAL NOW. If there's some new content, the manga readers might take a look.</br></br>  <br>Boypussy/asspussy&gt;pussy</br>  <br>Oh, that makes sense. I usually play them on my PS3 because I have no BD player either. I think the DVDs might be locked to region 2 so be careful with that.</br>  <br/>  What chapter are they up to in the animu and is it going to overtake the manga? Not sure which I should roll with, never do both since nothing more annoying than watching/reading a story you already know completely from its alternate medium.    <br> you will never make her your pet after the humans win the war <br><br>Life is suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch first</br>    <br>The development is going to end inline with the latest manga chapter</br>  <br>I planned on getting a PS3 for a game or two, but I'll no doubt be getting a PS4 when  KH3  comes out. Are there any significant advantages of a BD over a DVD other than quality? Such as the disc being more durable or something?</br>  <br><br>Always watch the anime first. Then you can read the manga and realize what a disappointment the animu version was because of all the things that were altered, edited, or skipped outright.</br></br>    The best part is that this series would work so much better as a harem. Why do we have so many hot background chicks on gurens team that could be sex slaves and join yuu's harem. It doesn't make sense to me. He could have mica dressing up as a female vampire and Fuck him along with Shinoa and all the girls in the human forces  So real question from someone who knows next to nothing about this series:<br><br>Why do all the soldiers on the human side go into combat in fucking dress uniforms?</br></br>  <br>I think that's what most people do, since the PS3 at its highest price was still cheaper than the first BD players.</br>  <br> le ebin surprise box <br> being this fucking retarded <br><br>Just kill yourself already, newfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they are harem members to Guren, the main character of the LN</br>  Yu doesn't die, he's fine. <br><br>He tries to rescue Guren, but that faggot with the glasses stops him by putting him inside a coffin with his special move.<br><br>Just for you guys that are only watching the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That upset meido vampire in the very last shot </br>  <br> Yu doesn't die, he's fine <br><br>The first frame of the preview is him fighting again</br></br></br>  <br>Wow you are a really master trolle ! I hope you enjoy your first week on /a/.</br>  <br>Thanks for repeating what the preview already spoiled</br>  <br>I don't regret getting mine because it wasn't very expensive and I can play a couple of  fun  games of all regions (not sure if it's a model thing, I hear some are locked) and watch some movies. Not getting the 4th though,  not even for KH3  at least not until the price gets a lot lower. I'm no expert but I think the only difference is in quality &amp; resolution (DVD is 720x480 and BD is 1920x1080 I think). But you won't be able to tell the difference unless you're using HDMI cable and a proper TV/monitor, at least from my experience.</br>  Found out where the animation budget went<br><br>All this fucking lava.</br></br>  <br>He's so fine.</br>  <br>There is no reason to spoiler those parts you dumb nigger.

If I was a soldier about to die, I rather get sucked dry by him than getting killed by the other vampires.</br>     touching moment ruined by QUALITY and improper use of Sawano <br>I almost never complain about QUALITY in Seraph because it's usually in quick frames but this lasted for too long, they should have put some effort in it. And I love Sawano but they need to ask him to make more tracks or learn how to place them because in almost every episode of this season there has been at least one track that's overused or doesn't really match the scene.</br>  <br><br> frogposter <br><br>Fuck off and kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People said that about him last season, im starting to have my doubts. Such a pain to watch him throw a fit every god damn time something goes badly.</br>  <br>Yeah I don't like the sound direction, same thing with when Aiko died, they started playing some mismatch dramatic track</br>      <br>This. When a character has a personality don't turn it into cheap shipping bait.</br>  This is pretty gay.  <br>I think they went with that because it was Mika's first on-screen human kill.</br>  <br>my nigga.</br>  Well, he got his princess.   fuck <br> marry <br> kill <br> ignore <br> befriend <br> bully </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It almost looks like fanart.</br>  <br> all those bruises in his face <br>I hope they spent all the episode budget animating Mika taking a beating.</br></br>  <br>Whether it's frogposting, cu󠀀󠀀ckposting, VLC snapshots, or whatever, it's always the people that complain about them that are the problem.</br>  I was starting to like Yu this season, but he has been a massive faggot these past episodes.  <br>Marry | fuck |bully<br>befriend | ignore | befriend/fuck</br></br>  <br>They are father and son</br>  <br><br>No, fuck off cancer.</br></br>  <br>I thought it seemed strange the blonde one was the one with the whip.</br>  <br>Stupid frogposter.</br>  <br>I would think it was fanart if I didn't watch the video myself. Still, the art looks nice. It will be a waste if they don't make a book with these illustrations later.</br>  <br> fuck, marry, ignore, befriend, bully: Mika <br> kill: Ferid </br></br>    <br>Well because he has familysexual</br>    Guys, was Mitsuba relevant this episode?    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Ee<wbr>fPcht54c</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>She was never relevant except in her introduction episodes.</br>  <br>She did something.</br>  <br>befriend, bully, kill<br>fuck, fuck, fuck</br></br>  Is it even possible for a human to touch him?  <br>Shame, see you next week.<br><br>I hope was important.</br></br></br>  I wanted to see this harem SWAT break in  <br>Why are the vampires in this series so qt?</br>  <br>Shinoa x Matsubi route?<br>OOOH!</br></br>  <br>Would you let him to suck you? Yes.</br>  <br>They are foreigners. And Mika is half-Russian.</br>  <br>She is better in the manga. For some reason I can't think of, the anime makes her crush on Yuu pretty forced. It flows better in the manga but every time I see her so overly concerned over Yuu, like in this episode in the scene whe Shinya tells her to calm yuu down, and she just touches him in the back and all of sudden yuu is calm. What was the purpose of that? She is much better in the manga, fuck the anime.</br>  Shinoa was cute here.  <br>Why does she scratch his back like that?</br>  <br>She always lived a happy lonely life not caring about anything, it bites her now that Guren gives her family to care, because they actually care and need her so she needs to care with them too, it is not only about Yuu but her entire squad.</br>  Hopefully Yuu goes into badass mode next episode then kills all vampires except the loli one.<br><br>Then in the end, all girls join his harem and he dicks them all</br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, the only thing Yuu will get next episode is  a coffin .</br>  <br>protip: don't reply to anyone who makes comparison to other series.</br>  <br>She is always cute no matter what she does</br>  <br> the only thing Yuu will get next episode is pussy <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>    <br> I hope was important. <br>Haha, nope.<br>I can't even remember what her weapon is suposed to do, but the vampire nobles gave no fucks. To be fair, anybody without a super black demon weapon is cannon fodder anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>This<br>In the manga she starts to grow in many aspects, being more serious when the situation needs it, and even taking responsibility for her failures and she still has the things that made her a good character.<br>In the anime those are the only moments that fit with her in the manga:<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a dumbass and deserves that</br>  <br>I don't get why Mitsuba didn't shove her fingers down his throat to make him throw up. She was right in front of him.</br>      <br>Since the Nagoya arc Yuu always pretty much follow whatever Shinoa tells her except saving Guren part, it is like that in the manga too</br>  <br>Honestly, the only thing that bothers me on this is the fact that the boy's outfits are over detailed in comparison to Shinoa's. It just makes it stand out how plain she is.</br>  <br>Mika and Yuu faces look horrible. This has to be fanart.</br>  <br>Even Shinoa?</br>  <br>Well technically those were Shinoa's outfits in the first place.</br>  <br>ARMPITS<br>R<br>M<br>P<br>I<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's done by the same artist who draws really the best-looking Seraph Fanart. It's on <br><br>Evidently it wasn't good enough for her Pixiv, so it's just twitter dump <br>https://twitter.com/chenyileiFCC/st<wbr>atus/668777431512145920<br><br> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust<wbr>.php?id=8180705</wbr> </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit tier fetish.</br>  <br>Didn't they tried that in the manga?</br>  <br>Even Shinoa. As a Hiiragi and former demon-posessor, shouldn't she be carrying one of the super weapons? Nope, she has one of the crappier weapons.</br>  <br>kill mika<br>befriend everyone<br>fuck mika and ferid<br>marry mika and ferid<br>bully the chuuni</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No wonder then. It amazes me the artist drew so much detail but didn't fix the male characters faces. Shinoa's face is fine. It's weird too since this artist draws a lot of Mika and Yuu. There's something weird about them. Thanks for the links.</br>  <br>I think it's actually an edited screencap from one of the omakes</br>  I made this because I like looping webms. <br>The eye twitching in the middle has a frame that needs to be deleted, but I noticed it too late and I'm 3lazy5fix.</br>  <br>Pretty much. I don't understand why they have to add stupid scenes like that. I re-read the chapters that this episode adapted and while she was concerned and worried as well, she was standing more firmly and serious about the whole thing. I do not see why the add scenes like this, because at least in my eyes they make her look awful.<br>And while her crush on Yuu is reasonable, the added scenes in the anime to push it, are stupid. It's portrayed better in the manga but nope anime has to ruin this aspect of her in the anime.<br><br><br>I wasn't talking about that. And definately not Yuu and following her orders, which he fucking should as she is the leader and more responsible in the manga. I re-read the chapters this episode adapted and well, you can find the differences in her reactions.<br><br><br>Sometimes, I think this artist might be an animator of the anime because her art is very on point but alas I have seen other artists who can draw the same as the official art or even better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinoafags are so insufferable.</br>  <br>What program do you use for that kind of editing?</br>  <br>They were about to after he fell</br>  <br>Fags who insult other fags to pass time are the most insufferable. Fuck off instigator.</br>  <br>Technically Shii is a sealed Balck Demon, maybe at some point she could get a power up</br>  <br>Back to tumblr landwhale</br>  <br>She is still perfect. The only difference is that she emotes more than just smug faces because there's more to a human than being smug. Of course she'll be affected by actually caring when she grew up devoid of love.</br>  WOAH WOAH WOAH, what is this?  <br><br>Jokes on you, I'm from  /a/ </br></br>  <br>What, the boyshorts-styled panties?</br>  <br>SHINOA'S PANTSU</br>  <br>Yes my dick.</br>  <br>Kill yourself tumblrwhale.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty that still the inner lining of the skirt, but on the off chance it's actually her panties, so what?<br><br>Plain white panties are for purists, I feel nothing. At least pick a color or a design, plain white is bland.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Another Mikafag <br><br>Am I really as annoying as you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>DESU I like both Mika and Yuu equally.</br>  <br>Just because you post here it doesn't mean you aren't an insufferable faggot that only knows how to instigate and start shitstorms. You keep doing the exact same thing in the homo thread but just because those are meta and shitposting paradise nowadays it doesn't mean you should shit all over the board. You're a disgrace to fellow homos and Mikafags. Stop baiting with his face, it's insulting.<br><br><br>I want to believe it's just that faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Such a fiery cutie. If I was Guren, I'd fake my kidnapping, then dress up as a vampire, fight her, overpower her, start raping her, and when she breaks down crying that she feels good from rape by some stranger, I'd reveal that I'm Guren and that she feels good because of true love. Then I'd kiss her and do my best to impregnate her.</br>  fuck,kill.bully<br>fuck,fuck,marry</br>  <br>Thats true, Mitsuba has a better taste in underwear.<br>Spats&gt;panties</br></br>  <br>You know, I was kidding with my initial post, but you're just being retarded at this point. I don't even post in the mugen threads. You might take imageboard posting a little too seriously.</br>  <br> having my back <br><br><br><br>I like all the fluffy characters</br></br></br></br></br>  Does yu's swordfu do anything useful or is she just shit? I was honestly expecting yu to sell his soul or something to his demon sword and become a typical badass, is there anything special between them or is his sword/demon just generic shit?  <br>Me too. Mike is cute especially when he's a shota.</br>  <br>  she <br><br>I have bad news for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They are both so adorable like this.<br><br><br> swordfu <br> doesn't know sword is a male <br>And you will see next episode about your question.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I won't lie though, Shinoa has them curvy genes in her and I thank god for that.<br><br>Those curves, my god.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I was pretending to be retarded </br>  <br><br> he <br><br>dropped</br></br></br></br>  <br> I was just pretending <br> I don't even post in the mugen threads <br>Anyone can see you used the very same pictures in those threads and what kind of posts you made. Now would be a good time to stop replying before you embarrass yourself even further.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Mitsuba more curvy though? Shinoa is flat as fuck, and only has thighs/ass because she's a midget.</br>  <br>I cropped it, made a reverse version, and put them together, all with VirtualDub. Then I used WebMConverter to webm it.</br>  <br>I want to pat shota Mika's head, buy him chocolate and tell him everything will be ok.<br><br><br>Mitsuba is more curvy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Projectingfag is more cancerous than Shinoafags.<br><br><br>I just want Mika to be happy again.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember them both being curvy, but Shinoa and her smug genes make me think things. <br><br>Mitsuba's too pure to put her bodily charm to work. She's too straightlaced and the other one is hurrah for illicit sexual relationships</br></br></br></br>  Mahiru is love  <br>Just curious, but how many pictures of Mika you have in your folder?</br>  <br>That panel of her in the shower was insanely curvy.</br>  <br>My Seraph folder is actually pretty small. Mike is in 12 of those images. I think I have more Yuu images. Mostly screencaps.</br>  <br>But no one is quite as cancerous as you.</br>  <br><br>I mean, Shinoa is curvy for her height but would she be curvy if she was taller? People tend to have the same width, so if they are shorter then they look more tubby/curvy. Shrink Mitsu to Shinoa size and she will be curvy as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Just ignore and don't reply. That's exactly what that cancer wants.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>top breeding material</br></br></br></br></br>  Mika's novel will be out next month. Do you think it will be as many volumes as Guren's or less? Also, I'm hyped to see about his oversea adventures and what his name mean.  <br>She had an awful nutrition, maybe if she ate better, she would be more voluptous</br>  <br>I'd gladly give both of them some delicious protein to grow bigger, if you know what I mean.</br>  How can I enjoy Shinoa without all the bullshit that involves watching the series, reading the LNs or reading the manga?  <br>She's flat chested, but her hips are ready to fuck like bunnies</br>  <br>What are you doing anon?</br>  <br>marry-bully-fuck<br>befriend-kill-ignore<br><br>strictly no homo</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but I got 103, plus 11 Mika with a spoon pictures, and 58 in my Yuu-and-Mika-in-the-same-picture folder. <br><br>(72 Yoichi and 62 in Yuu) I have to frequently clean my desktop, too, as everything initially goes there.</br></br></br>  <br>Will Yu and Shinoa eventually share a shower together so he can witness her physical specimen</br>  I think Guren, Shinoa and Mika would make better MC's than Yuu desu.  Vampires with swords...Fuck this show and everyone who watches and or reads this shit. Attack on titan is more logical than demons and humans fighting gay vampires with swords and loli overlords. <br><br>The best part is if someone pitched this plot to any of you, you'd rage in laughter this seems like it belongs in the make a plot threads</br></br>  <br>WEE NEED MORE DOUJINS</br>  <br>but vampires with swords isnt uncommon in fantasy<br><br>now if you told me vampires had arrows that could take down helicopters i'd rage in laughter</br></br></br>  <br><br> i only watched this show because of an AMV i found on accident </br></br>  <br>Maybe if Shinoa asks him for some family bonding</br>  Cute I tell you.  Yuu and Shinoa fuck next episode, confirmed  <br> Implying Mika isn't going to give Yuu a hickey </br>  <br> 11 Mika with a spoon pictures <br> <br>Oh, post one of those.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying mmf won't happen </br>  <br>I'd say that technically there should be less volumes because Guren's story looks more complex than Mika's overall. But because Mika is a popular character, they might stretch the volumes to sell more copies. I'm hyped to read it but at the same time I'm afraid because of the possibility of even more Mika bullying. If only there was a digital release. I'll have to wait more than a month to get my copy.</br>  <br>Save images and webms.</br>  <br>You want me to just dump?</br>  I want to lick that fang.  <br>I want that fang in my neck.</br>  <br>shes like a sexy vampire Kumiko<br> she'll never suck blood from your wang </br></br>  <br> she'll never "geh" at your filthy blood </br>  <br>I want to procreate with Shinoa</br>  <br>Post the spoon ones. And are you that anon that in an past posted a screenshot of your mika spoon folder?<br><br><br>Oh you are getting it anon? If you are kind enough, could you share any inside pictures of it? And yes, I am expecting less as well but as you said Mika is one of the most popular in the fandom (do we have a popularity poll from the manga or another official source?) so I could see him get more than 5.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sure!</br>    <br> Yu wonders why his peepee feels weird and asks Mika about it. </br>  Shinoa should have given Yuu artificial respiration.<br><br>Just saying.</br></br>  <br><br>One and the same. I said I was going to wait until a general to dump, but I never got around to it.</br></br>   That Shinoa help Shinya to stand <br>Poor girl why does the guys not help her.</br>  <br>Not if his organs explode.</br>  <br>Meaningless details.</br>  <br>Or maybe suck a certain part of him so hard that the blood flows back in his face.</br>  <br><br>post a Mika that  smokes </br></br>        <br><br> juggernautcomeshomefromwork.webm </br></br>    <br><br>She's nearly the exact same in the manga. Don't do that shit LNfags do. This has actually been a pretty faithful adaptation.</br></br>      Personal favorite.  <br><br><br><br><br>Thanks for sharing.<br><br><br>Mate, not the shota.<br><br><br>No, she is not. I am not saying she is a complete different person, but she is more serious and cool in the manga, while in the anime she loses her shit pretty easily especially regarding yuu.<br> This has actually been a pretty faithful adaptation. <br>Yeah, right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't have smoker Mikas. I got alcoholic Mikas, but those I are still being worked on for something.</br>  The one that started it all. Bless the anon who made it.  <br>I don't give a single fuck about the chuuni plot. If I wanted a cool story and exciting world that makes my heart leap I'd read my fucking books not watch anime. I like this show because of character designs, Shinoa is cute and Ashuramaru gives me carnal feelings that no man should ever direct towards a boy. Here's your (You) fuckboy.</br>    sequel  <br>The Smug looks alive and well in the preview.</br>  <br>Greatest love story ever told.</br>  Pork roast edit.  Pork roast with pretty eyes  <br><br>Whats the point of these?</br></br>  <br>Mika thinks your pain is delicious.</br>  <br><br>She's not different enough to bother complaining about. Things always seem different in every adaption because it's your perspective on how the character acts no longer plays a part since the adaptation pretty much establishes it. <br><br>Unless you can physically prove how different she is in the manga what you're saying is merely bias.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls with round asses in dem tight uniform skirts killing me.</br>  That's all I made, really. I got distracted by other stuff. Here's the template.  <br>Or you could have bought it from CDjapan, HMV, Honto, or probably a dozen others that already shipped internationally for non-rape prices?</br>    <br> Going to buy $200 DVDs instead of $30 Bluray player <br>Seems legit</br></br>  <br> bias <br>It's mostly that I find her different from my perspective as you said. I have nothing against her and she is one of my favourite characters in the series but I feel the anime treats her poorly. The same goes for Mika. He is more intense and "crazy" in the manga but the anime fails to adapt this well.<br>And adaptions are not always good. Some are, others not. I think the adaption of Owari is fine but nothing great. <br><br><br>Thanks anon. You did a great job.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing works better as a harem.<br>Well, except porn.</br></br>  <br> trying to get him to hack it up <br>Poor shorty</br></br>  <br>Too perfect.</br>  <br><br>I also disagree with you about Mika. I find him just as obsessed with Yuu in the anime as in the manga. Shinoa flips her shit when Yuu overdoses in the manga as well. I remember some people making a huge deal about it like they are now. It's probably not going to get much better in the next couple episodes either when she starts to completely disregard orders to help Yuu.</br></br>  <br>This.I don't know what anyone could find so drastically different here. People don't stay the same way for their entire lives, she's maturing from being a smug kid. It's called character development, the actual kind.</br>  <br>can nipps not into spoons? <br>never in my life have I seen a spoon with a rim that thick and bend that deep in anything but anime.</br></br>   all those mikafags <br>best vampire right here</br>  <br>Spoons are to Japanese what a knife and fork are to Americans.</br>  <br>I think it's are modeled after asian soup spoons. Even though that's how I eat my Pho, I hate them. I don't know if I need to eat from the side or the center. It's all terrible. Either that or they just don't know that spoons don't have thick rims.</br>  <br>Can't deny that.</br>  <br>We agree to disagree then. <br>I wasn't talking about the obsession thing but more that the manga has potrayed it better with it's panels. Like pic related. And yes, she does in the manga as well that but in this episode she was able to calm yuu very easily regarding the whole guren thing. She was more distant in the manga until he took the pills. Anyways, that's my opinion. <br><br><br>I find it more believeable in the manga, that's all. Yes, she is getting character development but I think the anime doesn't potray this very well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It will take a long time to arrive but I will indeed order it. I will try to borrow a scanner if no one shared any pictures of it by the time I get my copy.<br><br>There is an official on-going poll http://info.nicovideo.jp/seiga/sera<wbr>ph_vote/<br>The final results will be revealed in December 4th. A lot of things will happen that day, now that I think about it.<br> poll results <br> chapter 40 <br> manga vol. 10 <br> Mika vol. 1 <br> Puchi vol. 1 <br> fanbook 108 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Since no one else does it.    <br>Fuck. My sides!</br>   no new shots of mahiru from the scene where guren talks about losing someone <br>I'm disgusted beyond belief.</br>  <br>All these happening the same day? Well at least the thread will be active from that day on.<br>And do you know how I can vote in the poll?</br></br>  <br>Do one with Kureto.</br>   looking forward to thigh high porn with bonus vampire slaying on the plane <br> get QUALITY ground $1 budget scene where thighs aren't even relevant instead <br>T-thanks.</br></br>  <br>Looks like they are just going to give her that one line in the whole anime</br>  <br>My nigga. <br>I was disappointed by the lack of this as well. Do they even pay Kensho to say 5s lines in this anime?</br></br>  <br>I was disappointed, too. I didn't have the manga on hand, but I'm glad I noticed that the environment was different.</br>  <br>Anime Yuu is so much cuter.</br>    <br>GIVE BACK HER FANGS!!</br>  <br>Yeah, December the 4th. The volume releases usually match with the release date of Jump SQ, but there's a lot of things coming out this time.<br><br>Oh, actually, the poll isn't on-going anymore. I didn't realize the voting ended on the 3rd this month, sorry about that.</br></br></br>  <br>It's ok. Thanks for all the info.</br>  <br>I hope they are paying him every millisecond he breathes into the microphone.</br>  <br>I want him to step on me.</br>  <br>She's wonderful</br>   Krul next ep  <br><br>FINALLY</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Truly the Asuka of our generation.</br>  why was it so hard for them to get this right  <br> why is majority of the vamps boys <br>Maybe it's like hemophilia.</br></br>  <br>I don't know how they can ruin it every time. The manga already has paneling with good angles for animation, it's like they're fucking it up on purpose. Not only that but they keep adding these shitty and pointless anime only scenes that make no sense just to fill episodes. If they need filler why don't they keep the manga ones they keep cutting instead? Wit had one fucking job.</br>  <br> Shinya spends 20 seconds in monologue while he has 3 seconds to take a shot <br>Sasuga Nihon tekigun</br></br>  <br>They were too busy drawing all that lava to think about Mika's thighs.</br>  <br>Requesting a YU DIED dark souls style webm</br>  <br> Mika has a bigger cup size than Shinoa <br><br>my sides</br></br></br>  <br>I think the author was working with the animation company directly, so blame him.</br>  <br>Unacceptable.<br><br><br>He is wearing Mitsuba's halloween dress and Yuu, Shinoa's.</br></br></br></br>  Someone make webm of asura cannon  <br>It's so they can goad people into buying the manga instead.</br>  <br>Author mostly worked with them about the chapters that will be adapted at the last episode/s that will be a bit ahead of the manga. In one of his tweets he mentioned to anticipated something very shocking happening in the anime in a few episodes from now and that he has worked with the anime team way before ahead because he gave them the scripts of it. If they go with the 2 chapters/episode then the end of episode 11 and the whole episode 12 will be new for us because even the manga is not that far ahead.</br>  <br>Dem hips man.</br>  <br>look man I aint even mad some of the filler<br>just scenes like this one could have been better<br>I mean even just having stills while Guren sits there and talks to baby Yuu would have been better then just switching from detailed moments of them to </br></br></br>  <br>I totally forgot about VD, thanks anon.

I don't get it. The 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter is revered by many as extraordinary; a monument of it's medium, and a masterpiece of it's genre. Prior to watching, I had no idea it even boasted such a lofty reputation. I hold a great affection for Yu Yu Hakusho, and so I only gave Hunter a chance by it's author's label. After seeing it through to the end (ayy), I'm absolutely baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reception it's received. I honestly can't fathom that the man who wrote such a prolific shounen manga managed to fumble so badly with his sophomore series.<br><br>This show is so rife with missteps, I don't even know where to begin. It's plot is serviceable, and sometimes intriguing, but the staples holding it together are so bent out of shape, the whole thing falls apart. It's characters range from subpar to insufferable, and that's when they're lucky enough to even be written into the narrative. Gon is a somewhat interesting protagonist, but I wish I could say the same for all his friends. Killua is an angsty cliché with legs, and his backstory sounds like it was pasted from a tweenage RP forum. For a boy raised by a family of killer assassins who was bred never to trust or have friends, he sure has an easy time befriending Gon in the literal first 20 seconds that they meet. Kurapika takes the angst up even higher, but thankfully he and Leorio simply stop existing in the story's plot halfway through the series.<br><br>What happened to the chemistry? The development of Yu Yu Hakusho's characters is almost unparalleled, with all four protagonists growing and changing together over a long course of time. Yusuke is an almost entirely separate person at the end of the series. The four heroes of Hunter x Hunter become best chums almost immediately, and most of them are nearly identical in their final appearances to their introductions. It's incredibly disheartening, but not nearly as painful as Hunter's storytelling.</br></br></br></br>  At one point, Kurapika reveals that he has the ability to access all five categories of Nen and use them to his full capacity at will. He also has an ability that allows him to capture and defeat any Spider with absolutely no effort whatsoever. He gains these powers immediately after learning to use Nen. In another scene, Killua inconceivably obtains an enormous power boost by removing a pin from his forehead, which was never mentioned prior. In an episode hailed as legendary, Gon gets angry and powers up to defeat an extremely powerful enemy, again with no effort whatsoever. This would be the show's most anticlimactic apex, if it weren't for another string of scenes in which the arc's primary antagonists all die from radiation poisoning off-screen. Except for the King, of course, who decides to stop being a bad guy altogether. I could go on for hours, especially regarding the atrocious asspulling of the final arc, but you get the idea. These are just a few of Hunter's horrendously written plot points, and they take a metal bat to the narrative's knees. <br><br>I could sit here for the rest of my weekend trying desperately to understand why this series is regarded as a beacon of greatness in the industry, but I feel I'm getting no closer to clarity. Why, /a/? What am I missing? What makes this series so spectacular?</br></br>  <br> Gon gets angry and defeats an enemy <br><br>I thought you said you liked YYH</br></br></br>  <br>welcome to 4chan, where everything you like is shit yet there are things that "everyone" likes</br>   implying that YYH after the dark tournament isn't just Togashi experiencing ideas that later became hxh   <br> What makes this series so spectacular? <br>It was competing against Naruto, Bleach and Fairy Tail.<br><br>AKA the standards are so fucking low that this is the best shonen being currently published whenever Togashi feels like drawing something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What am I missing? <br>Logic, consistency, arguments that make sense?</br></br>  <br>Yu Yu Hakusho has it's share of awful asspulls, I'll never argue that, but at least when Yusuke got angry and slapped the shit out of Sensui with a stupid power boost, it was after Sensui flexed his power and made Yusuke his punching bag. Pitou's strength was hyped up since the beginning of Chimera Ants, and not once did we ever get to see it. Seeing Gon pummel the hell out of an enemy who was implied to be ridiculously strong is a fucking disaster of storytelling. It's actually disgusting.</br>  Hunter x Hunter is a poor man's Dragon Ball.<br><br>Gon's character development literally ripped off Goku's.</br></br>  <br>Gonna play devil's advocate here.<br>Its possible that its all sort of satire, a jab at shounen.<br>Killia's an edgelord in background, but he becomes #1 bro. Gon goes through shounen powerup but its supposed to be tragic and somewhat bittersweet, he's effectively trying to commit suicide. Kurapika and Leorio are both chucked out of the story forever despite their popularity. The fact that the big bads are defeated by a nuke hilariously shits on powerlevels.<br><br>Its basically Togashi's big "fuck you" to shounen jump. Even his hiatus is a big "fuck you" to, well everyone at this point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this<br><br>Literally 80% of all shounen action anime follows this pattern<br><br> prot either optimistic/pessimistic about fighting <br> fights <br> fluctuation in who's winning, usually leaning towards prot losing <br> prot about to lose <br> gets angry  <br> all of a sudden turns the battle around and wins <br><br>And this didn't even happen all that often with Gon, at least not compared to Yu Yu Hakusho. That literally happened with every single major fight in YYH, especially with Yusuke.<br><br>But yeah, not everyone's gonna like the same thing, even if the majority here seemingly does. Nothing wrong with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can sling pompous jabs around all you want, but if you're not going to propose any counterpoints, then you may as well just be shitting on your keyboard.<br><br><br>HxH being a satire is the only possible way I can justify some of the shit that's written into the series. Unfortunately I don't think that was the intent, and I definitely don't think that's how it was perceived.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not once did we ever get to see it. <br>Killing Kite. Surviving a blow from the King. Remote controlling an army of soldiers around a country. Surviving a blow from Netero. Developing one of the best healing abilities of the entier series.<br><br>Your arguments are full of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> then you may as well just be shitting on your keyboard. <br>Considering that's what you did with the first two posts, there's no need to propose or counter anything.<br>You're the one who has to work harder to make your arguments worth replying to.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Killua's needle was a moment of character development; he finally overcame his brother's conditioning because his desire to protect his friend overrode it.<br><br>Your other two examples are characters gaining the ability to win a fight, and making every other aspect of their life disastrously worse in the process. Kurapika becomes a murderer and locks himself into a death-revenge grudgematch that his friends barely pull out of, and Gon reduces himself to beef jerky and burns a lifetime of potential and inborn talent on a five-minute fight.<br><br>Being able to win a fight doesn't always lead to a happy ending in HxH; this is something the show harped on pretty regularly. Are you sure you watched it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think that was the intent <br>You should really see the shit Togashi flings at shounen jump. Not only that, just the fact that he scribbles out drawings and makes them publish it is another hilarious "fuck you"<br><br>It may not be a satire played straight but a lot of stuff is definitely Togashi just spiting shounen jump. I think I could even argue the gore is just to piss them off (though I definitely have a weaker argument for that).</br></br></br></br>  <br> killua <br> #1 bro </br></br>  <br>It sounds like you've just ignored a huge number of plot points (and corresponding criticisms for YYH, how are you going to complain about Kurapika, Gon san etc when demon Yusuke exists? How are you going to hate edgelord Killua and Kurapika but like Hiei?). Like you switched off your brain midway through after realizing it's not an exact parallel for the series you've got a nostalgiaboner for.<br><br> Killua is an angsty cliché with legs <br>Assassin Killua is an edgy cliche, HA-&gt;GI Killua is a a fun, normal kid, Killua in CA arc is a soft hearted, but self centered person who is unhealthily dependent on Gon, Killua post CA arc finally has his own goal and distances himself from Gon. <br> he sure has an easy time befriending Gon <br>No shit, he was literally mid rebellion and looking for fun<br> The development of Yu Yu Hakusho's characters is almost unparalleled <br>The development of Killua and Gon's relationship has significantly more depth and enough chemistry that most people see a romantic relationship between them, Kurapika is not a perfectly friendship oriented person, and Leorio hasn't got his time to shine yet. <br> He also has an ability that allows him to capture and defeat any Spider with absolutely no effort whatsoever.  <br>And he is severely limited by the threat of death and the inability to use it on anyone else. He trains for it, just like everyone else, but happens to be extremely smart.<br> which was never mentioned prior <br>Except for all the times Illumi's needles were shown in action, and the scenes of Illumi manipulating Killua's mind. <br> again with no effort whatsoever <br>It was a fucking suicide attempt by a guilt ridden child, it's not an expression of hard work. <br> primary antagonists all die from radiation poisoning off-screen <br>Thematically driven deaths are a problem for you?<br> who decides to stop being a bad guy altogether <br>Who developed slowly over the length of a huge arc <br><br>You honestly just sound like you wanted a generic, YYH/DBZ style battle shounen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey mom look I posted a bait! I'm funny on internets mommy</br>  <br>Not bait if it's the truth.</br>   2011   <br> killua <br> not #1 bro </br></br>  <br> The 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter <br> a monument of it's medium </br></br>  <br><br>A work having different priorities or a different message than its contemporaries doesn't make it "satire." HxH is still shonen, but it has a more nuanced view on the nature of "power," and doesn't present combat prowess or sheer willpower as the be-all, end-all of one's personal growth. It has more in common with traditional fantasy/adventure stories in that regard.<br><br>The one element I could see being directly satirical is the last phase of the Hunter exam -- a tournament arc that literally plays out backwards, and ends prematurely, because the tests of skill, resourcefulness and intelligence that came before were more important.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you stupid? Killua was programmed, conditioned to obey Illumi's orders at all times, but his ability as a human being to make individual choices overwrites it. The needle is just a metaphor, as is Killua sending Illumi back home in the Election arc.<br><br>Kurapika sacrifices any kind of mental health he had remaining for the small power up he gets, I dunno why you're so fixated on power levels when they're barely relevant in a series like HxH.<br><br><br> Except for the King, of course, who decides to stop being a bad guy altogether. <br>"wauht r thhemes? i wanted a big showdown with the evil bad guy"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> willfully ignores every explanation for every powerup so you can use the word "inconceivably" <br> calls Killua an edgelord while ignoring all of the backstory that says he's not an edgelord  <br> hurr durr angst is bad flat characters lmao <br>Ok pal. Opinion discarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't.</br>  <br>How is it possible to be this obtuse? It's supposed to be a completely one sided and unfair fight, if Gon was the underdog his powerup would be misconstrued as righteous. It is not supposed to be righteous, Gon isn't supposed to look like a hero, the scene is supposed to be miserable and depressing. We are supposed to be shocked and horrified by a kid absolutely MASSACRING someone on a suicidal rampage. This is not the normal way a battle shounen MC is portrayed, because they are supposed to be beacons of victory, hard work and friendship, but it turns Gon's stereotypical battle shounen MC traits against him- his determination, optimism and love for his friends essentially turn him into a monser. <br><br>It was excellent storytelling, unless your main concern is powerlevels and fights. And only retards value those things above character development, which was the entire point.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not satire, but it definitely shits on tropes intentionally, which is what I was trying to say.</br>  <br>Kite was barely around long enough for the audience to scale how strong he even was. It's not as if she one-shotted some hugely powerful and prominent protagonist. The only actual fight she gets in other than with Gon is with Netero, and that was barely even a fight. They built up Netero's attack for what felt like a decade, and the payoff was seeing it do literally nothing and having her leave to go so something else. Anyway, my point is, if you're going to spend an entire arc implying that a character is insurmountably powerful, the least you can do is let her prove it. <br><br>90% of all fights in HxH are ridiculously one-sided, and while that's quirky and groundbreaking and deconstruction of the yeah sure cool, it makes for some truly anticlimactic scenes. Frequently.<br><br><br>It isn't the emotional implications of all these events that are the problem. You can wrap an abhorrent plot device in feelings, but that doesn't excuse them. The needle in Killua's head was completely out of nowhere, and Gon's battle with Pitou deflated all the tension out of the arc almost on it's own. It's nice and all that there's some thought provoking morality to take from it, but it doesn't magically fix the writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it makes for some truly anticlimactic scenes. Frequently. <br><br>But is anticlimactic bad?</br></br></br>  Do I watch the old series before this one?  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>This, and download it from Bakabt for the good scans.</br>  <br> Kite mentored by Ging <br> nigh effortlessly kills Chimera Ants squadron leaders <br> not developed <br>Come on dude. If that's not enough you're going to need Togashi to personally write you a fucking power level chart for you to understand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In itself? No<br><br>But like every other trope, overuse makes it stale.</br></br></br>  THE RIDE NEVER ENDS  Why is Kyōko so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br>Some art to bump the thread.</br>    Yuru Yuri hajimaru yo!

They're reunited for an occasion, maybe a birthday. The son, instead of inviting a real girl to eat, moved the television and displayed an image of his favorite Japanese cartoon character on it, his so called ''waifu''. As we can see, this makes his parents very upset. Then, for comedic purposes, the son decides to help his ''waifu'' eat, because she hadn't touched her plate. This is funny, since it shows that the son believes that the girl is real, and that he is a fucking failure.</br>  <br>She dindu nuthin</br>  <br>I'm not entirely convinced that they are his real parents, and not an older couple he hired off craigslist</br>  <br>HowToBasic wants weaboo audience</br>  <br><br>I do not believe you are a clever man.</br></br>    <br><br>This will never get animated.</br></br>  <br>Probably not, since its not in the YrYr manga</br>  <br> 2015 <br> Not going on dates with your waifu to social events <br>Why do people still do that shit?<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/lzvgMS7caNI?t=9s  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to hug Yui!  <br> Remove crack </br>  <br>No you don't</br>  Did your opinion of Chizuru improve?
