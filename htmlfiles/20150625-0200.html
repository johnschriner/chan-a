[  Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be the next Hokage    Fuck off.   so what the hell happened to this show  i didnt watch after the first series     r u austistic ? ?     We're on the kids now     no you fuck off and kill yourself while your at it    Why weren't all the Uchiha murdered?  They cause nothing but problems       Why weren't all the Uchiha murdered?   Sasuke got drunk one night and accidentally made another one     MOOT   Got your back.     Tobirama is rolling in his grave.    Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be fuck the Hokage  ftfy      it's all just a dream      so what the hell happened to this show   this happened https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=35a<wbr>dqIEBj9Y</wbr>  [ ]       lightning rasengan   No fuck you     &gt; What are the true intentions/real nature of his respected parents?  wanna bet his parent is Orochi     Orochimaru just wanted to be the little boy again     Is he the reincarnation of Kagura     We know for a fact he isn't Orochimaru     yeah sorry     But first I'm going to kill all the kages still trapped in the infinite Tsukuyomi     dude, he said he was sorry    you do realize that there a fuckton of Orochimarus on every person that has a seal on their necks right?   Naruto using wood style   Pinkshit is a pathetic wreck, she's raising Sausage's child with another woman. Sausage himself wandered in the forest for 12 years without ever once dropping by and seeing his supposed family. Naruto and Hinata had a perfect Disney happy ever after and have twice as many kids as everyone else.  One of them is called Bolt (reference to Neji meaning 'Screw') and he's a cheeky little faggot who acts out because daddy spends too much time in the Hokage office - Kishi is proejcting the fuck out of his own relationship with his children onto him. Shino became Cyclops from the X-men. Chouji married a black girl. Shikamaru made a clone of himself with Temari and is Naruto's right hand man. Akamaru is dying of old age. Konoha is now a metropolis.            She's a naruto's fangirl.      he hasn't said he's sorry for abandoning and almost killing his child.      daughterfu...   So what is Bort's dream? He doesn't seem to be interested in becoming the Hokage.   His power is limb elongation.    did naruto die yet     translation?     forgot pic    good luck trying to kill Jesus    to surpass his father most likely.     So what is Bort's dream?   revolution of the ninja proletariat      I would actually like her to be Hokage, Boruto doesn't deserve it. Plus, she's the only decent Uchiha that isn't Shihsui    fuck his lonely and thirsty mom    "As the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura, she has already awakened the Sharingan. She admires Naruto."     Sauce comes back to the village after 12 years   Bolt steals Salad's dad   Salad says she wants to be hokage   by the end of the movie after he sees how cool Dadruto is Bolt will revoke his "I don't even want to be hokage!" declaration and steal Salad's dream too       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sj4<wbr>obDjhuvU</wbr>  [ ]   To create a democratic system of government instead of pseudo-monarchic military dictatorship with feudal lords.    Just like her dad.    What the fuck happened to Hinata? She aged like milk.    Is it just me or does it sound like Nardos voice is even girlier now?    What are you talking about? she looks like she is on her 20's.     Gets new haircut   Exact same face   Aged like milk  ?       She looks exactly the fucking same as the last, only with short hair and some weird sweater hoodie thing      he even gets Sasuke's headband   Sarada probably just got a headpoke, and that's if she's lucky   will she kill herself at the end of the movie        It's the "housewife" haircut.    Are they really spoiling the gaiden's plot?    Because you expect his voice to be deep because he's an adutl now and you're feeling the gap between a man and a woman pretending to be a man.     Uchihas   Taking power   Ever  Konoha need another purge        Would that douche post a pic of Himawari's profile? You know, the character we actually haven't seen?      she's raising Sausage's child with another woman.   there's still a possibility it will all be an epic ruse by kishi   unless kishi is going to pull a whole "your mother is the one who raised me" thing at the end of the gaiden.  but if he does that, then he'd have to make Sarada reject Sasuke too since he's never been there for her at all.           Sasuke's headband  She got something better than a sweaty and rusty headband. She got a head pat  from Naruto.     Sausage's headband really overdoes it. Were they trying to mirror Iruka giving Naruto his or something?     No, just that Boruto is meant to be the SN lovechild.     Chapter 7: "Why should I help somebody who isn't my mom!?"  Chapter 8: "I guess I DO want to help my mom."  They've already had Sarada accept that Sakura is her "mom" either way.          Kishimoto holding Sasuke to the same moral standards as everyone else.     I hope Kishi at least has the decency to write Salad resenting Sauce while Sauce shows some semblance of regret for damaging their relationship.  But with Salad going "W-wow my papa is so sugoi!!" every other chapter now I doubt it.       Maybe they'll make her a tsundere      If that's the case, there's no reason he'd be too much of a prude when it comes to Sasuke to have him impregnate Karin and steal the babby      can't even remember his own character's name   nepotism      no spoilers yet  Does this mean the chapter is boring or that the chapter is exciting     I remember the earlier material said specifically "born to/between Sasuke and Sakura,"  did they change it?       Kurama already filled that role.     Sasuke on the one side   Karin giving birth   Sakura on the other side  See, she was born between Sasuke and Sakura.       Why does she cause such a reaction in my loins?      It's not like I want papa to train me or anything...   I hope Hokage-sama notices me   how moe will Sarada get?       How many years until we get Boruto Gaiden, with Boruto and Saradas Kids?    anon, please     When have any of the girls that Sasuke has tried to kill directly or indirectly resented him?     Uchiha   Hokage   I'm ready for salad's era       OF course Sasuke didn't just bang Karin out of the blue you SSfag. But saying that Sarada is just magically Sakura's is just as thematically retarded.  Sarada is most likely a test-tube baby. It'd explain why there's such a secret to her birth, and why Shin wants to capture her alive.       Naruto grow the most  Can anyone tell me if we read the same manga? What part of Naruto is growing the most when he just did the same things?     Dude Im super hyped for lee's kid.     fingerless arm-high gloves   Thigh-high boots   zettai ryouki   hips   short black hair   glasses  help!           But saying that Sarada is just magically Sakura's is just as thematically retarded.   I agree with you though. I want Sakura to be a cuck one way or another.   Sarada is most likely a test-tube baby.   The only problem with this I think is that it makes the assumption that Sasuke and Sakura are familiar with this technology already. Plus, who created the test tube baby? Karin? Why would Sasuke ask her to do that?   and why Shin wants to capture her alive.   I'm pretty sure he just wanted her cause she was an Uchiha.               Maybe that Evil chick hasn't read it yet?     He's made of rubber.      How did that happen?    Salad doesn't want to bone him like the other girls did    Here Burrito I want you to have this   You are you're kind of like the son I never had and always wanted.     i thought kishi said he was going to have his own attacks? in the last few days I’ve seen this nigger clone spam, shoot out chidori and now it looks like he's making a midget rasengan in his hands.    Naruto, Sasuke and  Luffy  kids in the same team.    so what happened to pervert anyway     She's still alive      Naruto mentors Sarada   Sasuke mentors Boruto   Sarada learns sexy no jutsu   becomes the hokage from this alone    Boruto becomes something so edgy when he eventually puts sharingans into his arms or something   AWW SHIT          bolt gets her dad's headband her dad's techniques her dad's time his dad's techniques his dad's time when he can spare it  A home that isn't rubble and a mother that isn't fucking fainting spastic. salad gets to train with dirty bedsheets on a rooftop. it's just not fair.         http://news.livedoor.com/article/de<wbr>tail/10087733/  自分の道を行く、それを見つける� �とが大事なんですね。現在、ナルト� ��息子・ボルトが主人公の短期連載『 ＮＡＲＵＴＯ－ナルト－外伝「七代� �火影と緋色（あかいろ）の花つ月（� ��なつづき）」』も始まっていますが 、ボルトはどんな道を見つけるんで� �ょうか。  岸本　ネタバレになるのであまり言� �ませんが、ナルトは繋がりというも� ��をテーマに描いていたので、今度は 具体的なＤＮＡのような要素として� �がっているものと気持ちが繋がって� ��るもの、同じ繋がっているものでも どういうものなのかを描きたいなと� �っています。ＤＮＡの繋がりに対し� ��何がどう受け継がれていくのかを描 いてみようかなと。  ありがとうございました！  Interviewer – It’s important to find one’s own path, eh? Currently, Naruto’s son Boruto is starting a main character serialisation called NARUTO – Spin-off “The 7th Hokage and the Month of the Red Flower ”, but what path will Boruto discover I wonder..?  Kishimoto – I can’t say for the sake of spoilers, but the theme of “Naruto” has always been written as “Connection”, so this time, I’ve been thinking I want to write on elements such as the concrete DNA of those who are connected, and their feelings…those who are connected are the same. In contrast to a DNA connection, what has been inherited, and how? This type of story is what I shall I try my hand at writing to explore.          </wbr>   But Sarada is the one that'll become Hokage    Genetics is everything! The bloodline must be protected!     'blah blah i couldnt make naruto and sosukeh fuck so ill make their kids fuck instead'      sarada was her gift      Why would Sasuke ask her to do that?  He didn't  Sasuke-kun, I'm pregnant with your child, please take responsibility!   Really? I don't recall having sex. Huh, looks like Orochimaru was wrong about where babies come from, I should have known. Anyway, gimme the kid and I'll ask Sakura to raise it. Then you can go back to your lab and I'll keep wandering the world.   THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT          So Karin cooks up a kid without Sasuke's consent?     That was the joke, yes     you think this is a game, negroe? There are fictional children's lives at stake.     Sounds like something she'd do in all honesty.       that kuso oyaji at 0:56  too adorable         I suspect Sasuke never actually got "the talk". He thought "restoring his clan" involved getting revenge and commiting genocide instead of impregnating as many girls as possible       I fucking love Naruto's grin.    Sasuke has never taken responsibility for anything in his entire life    This is basically my interpretation as well.    He did the same things but he actually suceeded. Everyone else did the same things and never achieved anything.      Naruto and Hinata had a perfect Disney happy ever after and have twice as many kids as everyone else.  the fuck is this, a math problem?     MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOT 's REPLACEMENT </wbr>    How can the promo team be so retarded as to give away a major plot point of the gaiden in their material 'Sasuke and Sakura's daughter'. Like, what's the fuck is wrong with these cunts, that they couldn't omit to say who is her mother until the end of the gaiden, and just say 'Sasuke's daughter', where did they learn their work? How can they be so incompetent? I would fire the lot of them, useless faggots.    me too i guess. Imagine he kicks boruto's ass. oh god its going to be awesome. but who did lee marry anyway?    Fug     Well, she is Sakura's daughter regardless of who gave birth to her, isn't she?  Isn't that the whole point? It's not like Sarada stopped calling Sakura "mama"  There's still a sliver of hope that Kishi isn't an incompetent fool         He wants to travel the world like Jiraya and Sasuke.    I'm not talking about biological shit here but Sakura is the one raising her, so saying "Sasuke and Karin's" or "Sasuke and Karin's, raised by Sakura" or any form of that would be retarded.     Yeah, there's a possibility, albeit a small one I think, that they're just going with that for promotional reasons. Kishi may not have even written it.     She looks so cute in that portrait. I want to protect that smile     From the beginning, even before this gaiden in Sarada's profile was written that she was Sakura's and Sasuke's daughter.    I didn't mention something like 'Karin and Sasuke's daughter', just not to have for the 4th or 5th time now some promo piece reiterate she's Sakura's daughter. Once again, they can just write Sasuke's daughter, she admires Naruto or some shit. Writing down she's Sakura's daughter kills all the current questioning from the gaiden. And if you think Nips think 'adoptive mother = mother' then you don't know anything about them. Blood is the only thing that matters to them, so if it's written down she's Sakura's daughter, then she's.   Stop making Naruto threads until the latest chapter is published.    so, pure     I know but that was before the gaiden. Now if they weren't incompetent faggots, they would go along with the game and not spoil shit like the useless little cunts that don't understand shit about marketing that they obviously are.    she is*    Karin isn't popular in Japan.    what nightmare? you're awake    See  and fuck off.      It'd be kinda funny if Kishi does make Sarada Karin's daughter in the Gaiden while the promotional team is still saying she's Sakura's.  Also, I think the movie probably isn't going to focus very much on this matter from the gaiden, regardless of the outcome. Heck, if Kishi really wants to troll his readers while not making complete asses of the promotional team, he could just have the gaiden end on an ambiguous note with Sarada saying it doesn't matter what the truth is.        If you adopt a kid, you'd probably refer to them as your child.   Such a disappointed face    but anon said Nips only care about blood.    What I don't get is, if Sarada is really Karin's daughter why doesn't Karin just live with Sasuke in the village?   Why all this secrecy and shit?       editing a post that isn't yours on some Chinese cartoon anonymous discussion board  Faggot, pls.     So the fat guy beside Bolt and Sarada in that blurry pic was not their sensei after all? Shame, I was looking forward to Chouji playing the cool tutor.      Why all the secrecy if Sarada is in fact Sakura's is a better question.      Mangekyou Sharingan confirmed     I'm helping fag     Himawari actually make it to the movie     what was the deal with sasuke's fancy sharingan pattern anyway or was that just what eternal mangekyou looked like? I coulda sworn his eyes were like that before itachi died on him tho    Mangekyous look special because "fuck it, you have big eyes might as well make them spehshul", eternal mangkeyou looks even moar special     Activate the eye powers!!   Which ones?    ALL OF THEM        If Boruto doesn't apologize, I swear to God.     Did Kishi already forget about Sunflower?    You know I basically like Bolt's charater idea, but fucking up his little sister's birthday party AND making his mother disappointed is not okay. He better fucking make up for those. Also there better be some Hiashi in the movie, reflecting how even though he never met him, Bolt is somewhat like his uncle.      if only they had listened when it actually mattered    Pierot seem to be really inconsistent with the eyes, hers look as lavender as Bolt's The Last version did, even though in this film his eyes are as blue as his father's.    Boruto, why ruin your sister's birthday.     Konohamaru is their sensei      but anon said Nips only care about blood.  SS fangirls only cares about blood, you mean. It is amazing how they kept insisting that Salad is worthless if she isn't proof that Sasuke and Sakura fucked.     Why couldn't we protect that smile?   Borutos sister is cute as f   Woah, he is fucking rude to his mother.      self-explanatory      They were. They purposely made it like that, because you know, Hinata and the whole Byakugan deal. If anything its actually Kishi who's NOT consistent.      The problem is the promotional material says "As the child of Sasuke and Sakura" which seems to give away the real ending of the gaiden. The question is whether the moon speak of some of the promotional material would permit an adoptive interpretation with regards to Sakura.  As I pointed out above, earlier promotional material seemed to say straight up "born to Sasuke and Sakura." pic related. The moon runes in that promo are a little bit different.        Why is cake on ground?  What the fuck? This little entitled piece of shit acts like a real spoiled brat, hope Hinata give her a slap in his face.      that face  She's definitely thinking about malasion airlines     Hopefully they are lying.     The problem is the promotional material says "As the child of Sasuke and Sakura" which seems to give away the real ending of the gaiden.  I have absolutely no problem with it at all. Sakura is Salad's mum. Those who say "They need to be blood related because Japanese people are bad and intolerant and wouldn't think adoption is acceptable" is actually now being outright racist. SS fandom is pure poison.     Do we have any confirmation on that, or is that just speculation? The closest I can figure is Bolt calling Konohamaru sensei in ch700, but then he was in the Academy and that designation goes for everyone with that role.      Do we have any confirmation of that     <br/>   In fact, the fact that the manga makes a big deal about it is exactly explaining the adoption theory. They WANT to keep it hushed up because the characters would rather not let the fact that Salad was adopted to get out.       That isn't really the problem though. The problem again is whether the promotional material has spoiled the ending by actually saying in explicit language "Sakura is her biological mom" Either they have spoiled it or they haven't.     What is in that picture frame on Naruto's desk?     Stop Konohamaru! That's dark history!!!  Every fucking time.    Will Boruto awaken Byakugan ?   Is Boruto throwing a fit because his daddy didn't show up at his birthday? Is this an american 90s family movie?     No, neither Naruto nor Sasuke have that.    nice fujo implication  could use some work         They need to be blood related because Japanese people are bad and intolerant and wouldn't think adoption is acceptable  I dislike SS more than any other pairing but this is the truth. Only weaboos who know nothing about Nips would think otherwise. I personally want Karin to be the bio mom and would still consider Sakura as the real one, since she is the one who raised Salad. I'm just telling you how it is, not my wishful thinking.      Hinata give him a slap in his face.   using corporal punishment   at all  You seem to forget the pains she lived through growing up. She would never subject that kind of treatment to her offspring.        But Hinata does     Not him  her  but the pottery is getting more and more obvious.    So what?    Yes, this was confirmed. Boruto will be using a jutsu that isn't a variation of any of Naruto's jutsus.      Sauce's headband    Nardo's jumpsuit    rasengan    chidori  What does Salad got in all of this?         I dislike SS more than any other pairing but this is the truth. Only weaboos who know nothing about Nips would think otherwise  And yet, there is a reason why the entire village don't want to talk about Salad's origin... Which can be explained by how they don't want to tell her she is adopted.  We know there IS a "problem" with Salad's past. You are saying she isn't adopted because it would be a problem,. but the problem ALREADY EXISTS. And adoption would explain it. Saying "she isn't adopted" is just denying that there was anything wrong at all, which is outright not true.        Boruto will be using a jutsu that isn't a variation of any of Naruto's jutsus.   Because it will be a combination of Naruto and Sasuke's.      I wasn't talking about the story itself, just about how if the promo staff is repeatedly using 'Sakura's daughter', it means Sakura is the bio's mom.    That has nothing to do with byakugan though, he's shown doing both chidori and what looks like rasengan in the trailer. A mix of both is probably the new jutsu Kishi was talking about. Give up on the byakugan, Kishi doesn't liking drawing it.     I wasn't talking about the story itself, just about how if the promo staff is repeatedly using 'Sakura's daughter', it means Sakura is the bio's mom.  No, it says Sakura is the mum. They would NEVER say "bio-mum", that's silly. Especially since Karin isn't even in the movie. There is no need to explain Karin if she isn't going to be present.     What? She grew up basically like royalty then stripped of all luxury she knows what to do when she need to do, I think next scene would be her slapping Boruto and not mincing a single word, then this brat running outside throwing tantrums shouting "KUSO OYAJI!".  Literal spoiled rich kid.      Forgetting the source of power for the Uchiha.      What does Salad got in all of this?    &gt;Forgetting the source of power for the Uchiha.  And Karin's chains. And healing self-bite.        short hair  Just why?      tfw I am the anon who typeset that     They wouldn't use Sakura either if she really was only the adoptive mother. They would find something else to say, like for Mitsuki or just mention Sasuke. Once again, I'm not saying they would mention Karin but them saying it's Sakura's when it's the whole point of the Gaiden, is retarded. They could say something like 'Sasuke's daughter, like him, she awakened the sharingan. She doesn't know her father well but greatly admires Naruto' or some similar shit. Time and time again, repeating it's Sakura's daughter, when the entire fandom both in Nipland and here is divided over the question right now and everyone is still guessing, is the dumbest move you can make from a marketing point. I'll stop here now, because it feels like talking to a wall.    Holy shit, Im not touching anything of that.    Rejection?     They wouldn't use Sakura either if she really was only the adoptive mother.  Sakura is Salad's mother despite her being adopted. That is the whole point of the manga. The fact that you are denying this is just you wanting Sasuke to have sex. You are not talking to the wall, you are talking to the aim and purpose of the whole gaiden and trying to deny it for shipping purposes.     Moot was a cuckolding kike who cares what he thinks. Also check these.   what did the last woman hokage do   ok, sounds fine to me    I want to protect that smile.    Faggot, I'm a SNfag. I'd be happy if it's confirmed Sasuke's penis went near neither Sakura or Karin's vagina. I'm telling you that blood &gt; everything else for Nips and Kishi is a very conservative man. I would be very happy if he goes through with the current plotline but I don't expect him to do.      MEDICAL NINJAS FEAR HER     How will Sarada feel when Himawari starts developing her curves even younger than she did?     I'm telling you that blood &gt; everything else for Nips and Kishi is a very conservative man.  And that would EXPLAINS why no one wants to tell Salad that she is adopted.  You got a better explanation? Let's hear it.       The Naruto dick     Not him, but what if Kishi is just a bad writer who doesn't have what it takes to actually make Sarada some other woman's kid.  Of course, we all know it would make more sense of the story if she were Karin's kid, but there's the possibility that Kishi won't go through with it at all.     It's much less normal in Japan to interpret a phrase like "Sasuke and Sakura's daughter" as implying anything but blood relation between the two because adoption in the country is so rare. The majority of the thousands of orphans in Japan never get adopted because adoption has a stigma attached to it because parents who can't raise kids are too embarrassed and ashamed to ask others to take care of them and most working Japanese are not very enthusiastic about taking care of kids that aren't theirs. Chances are, if the marketing department keeps putting out things that say "Sarada is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter," they intend it to be interpreted as a BLOOD relation.  Now, you can say the marketing department is wrong and doesn't know what they're doing if you don't want to believe they've actually spoiled the ending by saying that Sarada is Sakura's kid, but thems the breaks.  THAT'S what anon is actually saying, but you're too dense to actually read what he's trying to say and arguing against a point he wasn't making in the first place                I don't. I'm just used to Kishi not making sense all the time and not caring about plotholes. I agree with you that Karin being the mom makes the most sense, I'm just telling you to prepare yourself, because this whole gaiden was just done for cheap, pointless family drama so Kishi can once again fap to the Uchihas. I hope I'm wrong and he for once proves he isn't a beta faggot with no balls at all, but I'm used to it at this point. If Karin is really the bio mom, I'll print this post and eat it.    Dat Bara Otsutsuki.    It is his sister's birthday and Naruto said he would get there. He's late and Bolt is pissed, thinks Naruto was lying. I do wonder if they will bring up the "I'll never go back on my word" thing he had going on.     Whether or not Sakura gave birth to Salad, she took care of her all her life. Sakura is undisputably Salad's mom, the only question is if she's her only mom.    Thank you, anon for getting my point. It was getting tiring arguing with that faggot.    The point is Hinata clearly can't control Bolt's wiles. What a shitty mother.    You're retarded. First of all, there are at least like 50 of us for some reason, and my mom is Bender's mom for some reason. So the POINT is that nobody can control anything, and if you thought you were controlling something you were very, very mistaken    Strength comes through adversity and hard work!  Oh wait this is Naruto, no it doesnt        stop Konohamaru that's dark history     What are the best scans for the gaiden?     YOU ARE MY FRIEND      Raws.  Learn Japanese.      Viz     Seriously, is it mangastream?       AAAAHHH, ANO HI NO YUME      This one only says "Sasuke and Sakura's child" (サスケとサクラの子).    Faggot pls. I hope you're seriously being retarded and not baiting. Niggastream are the last scans you should read, even dark panda is better.     Mangastream has translation problems with tone but they have clean scans or at least better than those by Mangapanda.   Viz is genuinely the best compared to the two, but if you can't spare some money to get the magazines, go with Mangastream.      ayyyyy lmao seriously though, the glasses thing was probably a bad idea. did you know that light is electromagnetic radiation, which is still a kind of radiation, and lenses focus light? that shit is going directly into your brain man      but if you can't spare some money to get the magazines  How much of a faggot do you have to be that you don't know you can get them here for free every week. You should read both MP and MS on Thursday and then get Viz from the Jump thread on Monday, to check the fuck ups. That's common sense.         The point is Hinata clearly can't control Bolt's wiles.  After growing up with Hiashi I can see her not wanting to be a too harsh or controlling mother, especially as a gentle and caring person. Calling her shitty for that is really fucking stupid, though. She is giving him a disappointed look and it is reasonable to assume that after everything is done a stern talking to. The whole point of the scene is to spell out Bolt's big character issue that gets resolved in the plot.  Would you be happier if she spanked him right in front of the guests? Or angrily yelled at him for something retarded and childish, chimping out even harder, like another mother in the series we see?       But I remember mangapanda was blurred as fuck. Unreadable.   Does Viz release Naruto digitally or something? I'm talking about the gaiden.      Spoilers when and where?   Ganstastream was always known for its unesesary cursing, but recently they've really kicked it into overdrive. Particularly, Sarada keeps saying fuck in front of her parents.     Naruto mentors Sarada  Implying anyone gives a fuck, both Naruto and Sasuke are training the little annoying cunt.    'If' Karin is Salad's mom, Kishi will throw her a bone and let them get to know each other right? Sauce will be forgiven in due time because he's Sauce.    You're welcome. Personally, I really want Sarada to be Karin's kid because I do agree that that is a better written plot considering everything that's happened, but I try to be realistic. Kishi could still do a 180 and write a poorly done MISUNDERSTANDING instead of a decent plot about an illegitimate child or petri dish kiddy learning what it really means to have a family.  But if the marketing department keeps saying "Sasuke and Sakura's child," if one still has any faith in Kishimoto, the most they can do is hope the marketing department just hasn't been keeping up with the story in the gaiden to at least not spoil the ending.    Interesting, I was told it actually said "child born to"            Does Viz release Naruto digitally or something? I'm talking about the gaiden.  They do release the Gaiden.      I'm talking about the gaiden.  They release the Gaiden in their Weekly Shounen Jump thing.     how much does it cost?      My life is a nightmare!   Viz translation lays that on pretty thick doesn't it? Living with Sakura obviously wasn't that bad?         adorable    no picture of your daughter? that's cold, naruto     Where the fuck can I get that? The archive? What's the usual OP?      Himawari was a mistake     dattebae please, don't you have some fat hinata pictures to do?    Oh great, another narutard thread.    Wait,when did that appear?    Lee's son kicked the shit out of it     the theme of “Naruto” has always been written as “Connection”  Right, so people who keep claiming Naruto is about "hard work overcoming destiny" can shut up now.       we still don't know Lee's son's name  Why      Damn that trailer makes pic related even better. Now he even gave his headband to Boruto and not his own daughter. Top kek, Kishi, never stop.     fat hinata  what?      Yeah, but in the flashbacks you see her dad training her really hard at like age 4. Admittedly, that's not corporal punishment, but the point is that Hinata knows how much it hurts to attacked by a parent.     Oh.Laaame.  Good for Lee Jr. though.      He is going to be the equivalent of Segata Sanshiro for whatever brand those video game consoles are we've seen in the sketches.    ns fag that now draws hinata - and only hinata - as "chubby" in the name of body positivity  she also hates her guts  do the math       bort the movie summary    Maybe pure just means something different in Japan. Goku is described as pure and he's also a pretty selfish character.  That said, isn't Japan the kind of country where individualism is seen as bad? Wouldn't a selfish character be considered quite bad?        everyone has a VA announced except Chouchou   everyone appears in the trailer except Chouchou   everyone is in this promotional art except Chouchou   Is she dying in the gaiden or are they ignoring her because she's black?        How do people become that butthurt with a nice, kind character who makes the main character happy? Fucking move on. The one time I recall being salty was about the end of Digimon Adventure 2, more on the grounds of the ending being geenrally shit rather than Sora going with Matt, but I shrugged and moved onto something better.  Probably Trainers, but after that I was finished with Digimon.      i dunno, chubby hinata sounds pretty cute.    Depends on how much of a pretty boy or cultural icon they are.     How do people become that butthurt with a nice, kind character who makes the main character happy?   self insertion, she is in love with naruto and project on sakura  hinata is basically the whore that stole her boyfriend in her brain        I see no problems with japanese adoption every week on my netorare    From based TL Anon from when it first dropped:   Jiraiya/Narrator: The sun shines over all of Konoha. The sun illuminates all the shadows of the village and the leaves bud once more.   Boruto: Shadow clone technique!   Sasuke: Are you Naruto's son?   Boruto: Make me your pupil! I want to defeat my dad!   Sarada: Stupid Boruto! I'm the one who will become Hokage!   [The battle of the new generation!]   Boruto: I don't want to be Hokage!   This parent shouldn't have been there from the beginning!   [A crisis approaches the village]   Naruto: Sasuke, I leave that guy to you.   [The inherited will]   Boruto: Isn't there an easier to understand method?!*   Sasuke: Naruto could do it.   Boruto: Why are you worried about me?   Sasuke: You're stupider (lit: usuratonkachi) than Naruto. Moreover...   Naruto: You really did it!   Because I was able to watch over your growth as your father.   Boruto: Shitty dad...   Gaara: Don't think you can make us run away!   Naruto: Even though the era changes, I wonder if the nature of shinobi will not change.   Sasuke: That's what I believe.   Boruto: 'Til now, what have I done...*   Sasuke: As my pupil...   Naruto: As my son...   Sasuke/Naruto: Go, Boruto!   [The little boy Boruto will surpass the great legend Naruto]   Boruto: Watch me, shitty old man!   Sasuke/Naruto: Boruto: Naruto the Movie   Boruto: I don't feel like I'll lose!   [I can't write anything greater than this! - Masashi Kishimoto]                                    She's probably even more shafted than Sarada. Both characters get plenty of panel time in the Gaiden, so one is severely limited as a rival to the MC, and the other becomes even more irrelevant, possibly failing in the prelims or something. Come to think of it that's a bit surprising as she could pull off moves that his dad could not do at that age. I'd love to hear at least a mention that she faced off against Sarada in the preliminaries, got her black ass handed to her but offered Sarada some potato chips as a victory prize, being a good sport.      How do people become that butthurt with a nice, kind character who makes the main character happy?  Because they want somebody else to make the main character happy. Somebody else they liked. Since this 'nice, kind character' somehow become the one that makes the MC happy and not their main character, they disliked her. The more you like the other girl, the more you're going to dislike this nice and kind character. If you base your enjoyment of a 15-year-long series on that other girl winning, you'll get pretty angry when she didn't.      She's on the poster for the film.     Pure just means a one-track mind.    B-buddhafuck...    I think it perhaps means pure in the way that they are purely devoted to fulfilling their own wants, uncorrupted by others' wants/needs?  As in Sasuke does whatever the fuck he wants, just like Goku does whatever the fuck he wants.      Stop typing like a stuttering retard.    It's not like it isn't their fault though.  Had they possessed basic reading comprehension they would have gotten the idea that if the girl they liked tearfully spelled out her love for the bad boy antihero on the MC's birthday for the fifth or so time, about which the MC was not hurt at all, they might have gathered the faint clue that shit ain't happening.     projection    mfw Salad will probably accept Sasuke as her dad despite the fact he doesn't really give a fuck about her, has consistently lied to her, hasn't ever even touched her and hasn't tried to visit her since she was a newborn in order to force a gooey 'happy ending'   Sakura hasnt and probably won't apologise for violently destroying their house and all of Salad's belongings because she questioned the legitimacy of sasusaku       Sasuke in a dress shirt and vest   He looks like a Hitman Reborn character.       Yeah, most of the promotional material just says that Sarada is Sakura's daughter. Only I think the only the fanbook said that Sarada was "born from" Sakura.     Rock Lee's kind looks really cute. I hope the mother is Tenten. They're both the closest the series has to "regular ninjas" and they both have that token Chinese character vibe to them.      Kuba 0:23    Tenten and Shino 0:36  How come no one mentioned this?      YO HO HO HE    To be completely fair, do you remember when Naruto completely ignored Hinata's "I love you" confession, never once blushed/showed any interest in her aside from friendship and then Hinata fell on her face trying to reach him?   However Kishimoto completely forgot to develop Hinata in Shippuden outside of 'n-n-n-naruto-kun i am here to bear your children' though, so that should have been a clue how things were going to end up.      Because no one cares.    fuck off she looks cute as fuck. nice shit taste    Kishi is not a good writer on this subject.     Kuba 0:23  eh?      Only I think the only the fanbook said that Sarada was "born from" Sakura.  I know what you're talking about. It's not a fanbook but I don't have the scan since I'm on my phone.     didn't you catch his cameo?    Enough with this "Hinata had no development" meme. Hinata did develop in Shippuden and had more development than Sakura. Hinata went from stuttering, blushing, and fainting to commanding the army, holding hands, and literally slapping sense into Naruto.    if you are talking about the guy behind lee jr, that looks more like kankurou   THROWING BIRTHDAY CAKE MOM GETS HEARTBREAK BORUTO'S DARKNESS IS TOO STRONG     DRAMA-FREE FAMILY HE SAYS    lol Sakura got shitty development because kishimoto couldn't work out how to make her ~popular~, but she definitely got more of it.  He pretty much just ignored Hinata until the war arc, and then all she did was some background fighting until Neji died for her. Face it, she didn't get shit until she gave Naruto a pep talk, and then she faded into irrelevance again until the movie.  Hinata never got to change the Hyuuga, stand up to her father, get any closure with her sister etc in the manga, she was only relevant for shipping purposes and used for cutesy/moe appeal in the anime.   Which is kinda sad because the manga moments she did get, she was generally a pretty cool guy.          no worries, everything will resolved in the movie     Spoiled kid need good spank      Has both Naruto &amp; Sauske's techniques    Has the potential for eyes stronger than the Byakugan   Bolt will be OP as fuck       Burito unlikable shit, thats why kishi made slad MC but pierot fucked it   That image swap is ironic.    this is pretty normal, though, hardly what i'd call drama    But he is unlikable brat, the only thing to redeemed him is by turned him into next madara      Face it, she didn't get shit until she gave Naruto a pep talk, and then she faded into irrelevance again until the movie.   Except for becoming the focal point for the climax of the Pain arc and saving Naruto repeatedly over the course of the war, as well as the telepathic connection they had during Infinite Tsukuyomi and getting more focus than any secondary character during chapter 699.    Hinata never got to change the Hyuuga, stand up to her father, get any closure with her sister etc in the manga,   That wasn't Hinata's arc. Neji's arc was about changing the Hyuga and confronting Hiashi, which he did at the end of the chuunin exams. Hinata's arc was about overcoming her shyness and lack of confidence, which she did in spades.         Isn't chidori only viable for sharingan users because of the timing required?  Salad's probably more OP if she's Karin and Sasuke's biological kid. Uzumaki and Uchiha powers. 2badsosad Sasuke's probably just going to ignore her and not train her in the movie       Hinata never got to change the Hyuuga   since when was that her goal?       Isn't chidori only viable for sharingan users because of the timing required?  Wasn't that Raikiri, which is Kakashi's special brand of 'lightning stabby thing'?     Sakura got more opportunities for character development but she never changed. Outside of her inner voice thing (which felt so out of place and I was glad to see it go after chunin arc) she's pretty much the same. Hell, even when it comes to her combat shes just a clone of Tsunade and hasn't developed anything herself.   What's with Japan and their need to toss strawberries on top of every flavor of cake? Is it some kind of trend?   No, during Kakashi Gaiden, Minato declares Chidori an incomplete technique because of its weakness of giving its user tunnel vision during the charge, which leaves him vulnerable to side attacks. The Sharingan has perfect clarity, though, so that weakness was overcome. Raikiri is just the S-rank version of Chidori.    chidori needing sharingan is just bs Run into someone with ur lightning fist, what else do u need?     http://web-japan.org/nipponia/nippo<wbr>nia33/en/appetit/index.html</wbr>   This little moment here made me hate Boruto with a passion.   I mean Seriously that edgyness is Uchiha tier.      Well even without Sharingan - Sauce developed Chidori so that it could be used without charging, and from range - if you had the proper level of manipulation, chidori could be used without the Sharingan.    “That’s lame, you shitty dad.”  The child doesn’t share his parent’s ninja way.  The new era that has developed rapidly after the long-lasting wars. New ninja are reared and the five villages combine in the Chuunin Selection Exams which are now being held by the Seventh Hokage, Uzumaki Naruto, within the village he leads, Konohagakure.  There are three genin classmates who train night and day at the village’s training grounds: Sasuke’s daughter, Sarada, who greatly admires Naruto; the superior shinobi Mitsuki, who holds many secrets; and Boruto, who holds great talent and calls Naruto a shitty dad.  Naruto, who doesn’t have time to spend with his family because of work, is resented by the lonely Boruto, who says “from the start, it would’ve been better if a parent like you didn’t exist.”  “Please make me your disciple!   There’s someone I want to beat!”  One night, Sasuke who had taken on a mission in a different dimension noticed a strange danger was approaching, and went to visit Naruto. Naruto and Sasuke talk about talk about shinobi of their mutual childhood’s era. As they do, Boruto hears from Sarada that Sasuke is Naruto’s “one and only rival”. Wanting to discover his father’s weak spot, Boruto begs Sasuke to take him on as an apprentice. Sasuke, who realises his friend’s situation, promises to be Boruto’s teacher “on one condition”. Boruto decides to apply for the Chuunin Selection Exams alongside Sarada and Mitsuki to show his real abilities to Naruto.  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127107847#p127114341">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    it's to the tunnel vision, which the speed, which is required for the Chidori to use at its fullest potential, creates also cake captcha     What the fuck is wrong with Hinata's design here, the hair could look nice (like in the panel in the gaiden) but here she has a severe case of manface that I only saw happen on Sakura before.   ZR vs Tights   My dick approves of both.    ZR no contest.    ZR is superior.   inb4 some fag posts a slut in tights and claims they are pure.   But Kurisu is pure.    Pure slut maybe.    You are a good man.    she won't be when I get through with her     oh lawdy     Both are good but whats even better is stockinged feet    I want those toes in my mouth right now!    CEEAR    ZR. Always ZR. Even the thought of licking the skin part between the socks and the skirt makes me rock solid.   Sexy bump.       Second best thing on that show, the fighting was number one.       ZR da best  implying she wears ZR in the anime[\spoiler]        ZR   But how are they kept on Barely any seem to have elasticated bands like regular socks      Why would you put two best friends against each other? Thighs and ZR go hand in hand, that is the only correct answer   Hey tights-guys! Could you explain to me the appeal in tights. No offense, but I seriously don't get it. ZR has the obvious appeal of following the golden ratio which is regarded a basic form of aesthetics. It also revelas skin in a perfect way by creating a lot of border are in proportion to the general area of skin revealed much like the recent boob window sweater, shirts with detatchable sleeves revealing armpits and of course various tops that reveal the midriff area. It is after all known that people concentrate on border areas when looking at something. It's also very arousing to see the sock bite slightly into the thigh in a way that emphasizes the fleshiness of the thigh area.  I don't get tights/pantyhose. What's the appeal?      ZR   With tights  What is wrong with you      I once heard that the most extreme japanese school girls go as far as using some water solvent glue product specifically designed to keep socks up.    thighs!= tight Maybe that anon misread the OP  like me.      There's the sheer definition of form of the legs, the slight opacity allowing you to see the skin and feet. If there's butt showing, there's the pantyline. When the contrast of lighter skin and darker tights, or lighter clothes, is made, it's delicious.  Also, tights lend themselves to office outfits, which is its own nook, and in general, tights tend to feel more formal than ZR does, since ZR is a teen and young adult thing.    How odd.         I like ZR the most because you can see some skin of the thighs. fucking fuels my imagination  ZR is obviously the best.   I love them both, and my reasoning comes from my dick turning diamonds. A combination of both are always great.    forgot image      Glasses make girls ugly   -3000 degrees outside  women wearing skirts with ZR    how        Pantyhose.    Which length is the best and why is it A?     In many cases tights do come of with a more adult wibe yes. Office ladies certainly have their own appeal.  I suppose the slight opacity does have something to it especially in scenarios where the girl isn't wearing shoes and the toes are visible. I'd guess tights are a better turn-on for foot fetishists.   I kinda understand the tights-thing better now thanks to you.         Thigh high always, the smaller the absolute territory is the more desperately you want it.    Stockings on plumper girls so you get that fat overspill at the top. Tights on thin girls    ZR has the obvious appeal of following the golden ratio   No it doesn't. You just think throwing "scientific" terms around makes your meme fetish look better.       mfw Rin only has B rank height in UBW   How does it feel, knowing ufotable doesn't even care enough to get a hugely famous and iconic fetish right, in the Rin route of all things?     Both   Feels better than being a frogshitter, and I don't even like fateshit    Depends, but it's between A and B. Not that bad.     It's still A is just that UFO shortened her skirt.    Why would she need help with studying? Isn't she the perfectest girl in her school? why does she wear the hood?   would you not help your himouto study the day before the big test?   She wants attention from her onii-chan you stupid dumb idiot  Yuuki Aoi has a grating voice and you should be ashamed for liking her and the characters she voiced.  http://otakomu.jp/archives/271413.h<wbr>tml It seems they changed the entire seiyuu cast of Shomin Sample.

I want to pee on every cure in turn.   Oh hey, it's a quiz motw. Tough act to follow after Suite's, though.   Whaaaa. Linear algebra should totally be a high school subject.

Shit like this is Commie level subbing.  At least Doremi had the decency to keep her name as Majorina.      It's a cameo you're not missing any deep jokes other than your usual Japanese duo comedy crap.     Haruka doesn't look comfortable here.     mfw fansub groups think they're 4kids    God live watch anons are more annoying that the kigposters. You spend more time screencapping and posting than watching the damn show.   Haruka is far too wet to be comfortable.    But she's under an umbrella.    It's fun to see people enjoying a show which I also enjoyed.  Also, it's on topic for the thread. If you don't like it, you should stay away from /pc/ except right after a new episode airs.      Obviously I don't mean her hair is wet.  I mean, she's probably wet somewhere that the umbrella doesn't protect.  Somewhere lower down.  Picture related, it's a wet Kirara with dry hair.           Aesir-Anxious   Aesir  That sounds fami --  Magenta  HA HA HA nope. Magenta takes large liberties with his subs. Just ask /m/. After using a joke/meme name for a characters real name, he got a bug up his ass when people complained how stupid it was to do so.          It's fun to see people enjoying a show which I also enjoyed.  Nah it's been one anon posting screencaps and playing reviewer the entire time.      Ryouma Warring      it's fun   nah   If you're not having fun, you're free to fuck off.       You rang?     Ornac     He's been at this for sometime now. I think most people got use to it and just ignore it just like with kigs.   I have a feeling your the live watch poster.      I want to marry Yuri's mom.  Did someone say kigs?  Been trying to go through the archive to find fight webms but there is so many threads. Anyone got some good fight webms?      I have a feeling your the live watch poster.  1/ Learn English, please. 2/ You're wrong.        Holy shit, the fighting in this show looks good. I need to watch this. It's tie I took off my hiatus for Precure.     Please think of the future of the thread and post responsibly. We don't want to sit through hours of a ded thread before a new thread pops up, do we?      Not even Precure can escape the scourge of Magenta.       Due to no new episode this week the threads have been slower than usual.    relay race episode  Nothing really interesting going on here. I guess character episodes are just kinda like that sometimes. Have a GoPri fight instead.  A little aside, I'm pleasantly surprised how likeable all five cures are in Smile. I suppose none of them are abrasive or controversial for any reason whatsoever, but it's a nice change from the usual. Though I suppose Fresh was a little like this too.   So what happens when we get to a series you hated?   Sounds like a pleasant character. To be fair, most of the subs haven't been horrible so far, I just hate that particular thing.            so you want us to sit though hours of a dead thread so we don't have to sit though hours of a dead thread     ignoring kigs     I think he's talking about the image limit. That dead zone when it's filled but there are another 50+ posts under the bump limit is brutal.    Screencaps and kigs have had the threads to themselves.    Sounds like a plan to me.    Nah, there's plenty of fan art in every thread. Of course most of it is the same 200 or so images getting posted over and over, unless it's from the current season.   What motif would you like to see in Precure? Pirates? Girls like pirates right? Pirate Cures who swashbuckle their way into our hearts.     Animal theme is way overdue.

IIRC there's some tension there because Youkai Watch is eating PreCure market share right now.  But hmm.  What if the Cures were the Youkai? Like, the faeries and "purified" things were actually Youkai? So the Cures would get Youkai powers to fight evil Western imperialist monsters (like werewolves and vampires and all that other shit from D&amp;D).

HaCha, because  I don't like them, so I won't mind if you soil their memory with fan-fiction .    Apparently not, maybe that's why I have so much trouble picturing it. Certainly the western cartoon portrayal of turtles hasn't been flattering, and in anime the only thing I've seen come up is kappa. And that joke is usually very, very unflattering to girls.    Kappa have nothing to do with the turtle mystical beast.  Seriously go watch Hyakko.      I think the toroise/turtle character should be portray as an honest character that always work hard despite its set back, just like the tortoise in The tortoise and the rabbit. That could work.

Hyakko  Ah, okay, that's just using that whole idea straight up, then. I wasn't trying to say that they were the same thing, simply that that was the closest thing to turtle-related characterization I'd seen in anime.   It could.

Wasn't that whole season about flowers?     Cure Ganymede  She's a trap, right?     What happened to Itsuki, and who is that wearing her costume?     Wait, weren't their motifs based on flowers?  How do you figure Moonraito is a flower?     Suddenly, Cure Mami     Don't remind me Saban has the rights to Precure in the states.      Moonraito  ...please stop...      Lily Moonbeam in the English dub   The Flower That Blossoms in the Moonlight   Her symbol is a blue rose        English dub  N word what?     I suppose I should've just taken their word for it, but I had no idea that (some) lilies only bloom in moonlight. Heck, I had no idea there were any flowers that did not.  Neat-o.  And you won't be laughing when it actually happens.        ...    English dub  No.  Her costume had a flower on it. Yes.  She's still not a flower, nor are her themes flower-oriented.  Erika at least had a dress that looked like it was made from flower-petals, even if "Marine" had jack shit to do with flowers.              I can't wait for Glitter Force.   Seriously though, Saban shows were my childhood, and the big Jew honestly does love toku. He tried to get kids into Jetman dubbed before giving up and making Power Rangers.     N word  Don't do that here, nigger.          Yuri's dress has a floral theme. It's just not the same kind of flower as the others'.    The entire theme of Heartcatch was flora life aka Flowers. Some of the Cure's motifs and names weren't directly flowers but their powers played into the who making flowers grow deal.    Saban Banzai!   Alright. The name "Yuri" is certainly flower-themed, but I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily, and I don't see any lily on her costume.  Her civilian form is more in-theme than her Cure form, I think.   Itsuki? Cologne?              Saban shows were my childhood   yadda yadda Jetman  It was Bioman and he isn't a "fan" he saw a business opportunity and persuade it. The idea that Haim Saban genuinely cared about the cartoons and shows his companies made is a lie create by people who want to numb the sting that he is a pretty shitty guy. Him making shows you grew up with shouldn't negate that.       I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily  Wisteria    Yuri is a finicky flower which needs lots of fertilizer to grow.  I think the "flower" label to Heartcatch is a mistake when it's theme is more about botany.   For some reason, the Japanese seem to catch the more obscure flower/plant name references that are largely lost in the western world. Erica is one of them, and might be the reason they named her that.    Hmm. At least the colors are kinda half right.    I know, I know. Just let me believe there's a kernel of love somewhere in his fat Jew heart.     Erica is one of them  I did not know that before. Thanks.   We are all cute little jewish girls in here, /a/non, and we have lots of love in our cute little jewish girl hearts.         We are all cute little jewish girls in here  I'm not.      Erica[note 1] /ˈɛrɨkə/,[note 2] is a genus of approximately 860 species of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.[4] The English common names "heath" and "heather" are shared by some closely related genera of similar appearance.

Leave /u/ out of this      Diesel Nightmare Fuel     Yeah not seeing how that ruffled, two-layer dress is anything like the smooth, single-petal flower you posted.  That lily you posted isn't even the right color scheme.  Sorry, but you're the blind one.         This one at least has something close to her color scheme, but it also looks nothing like her dress.    It's the form of the dress it's even open at the front like a lily.    And like a slut.    Lots of dresses do that. Picture related, you ought to recognize her dress.    That's funny I saw Mugino shitting pixiv again when Kanata appeared    Over the line.

Ah, cool. That does look like her dress. It wasn't in the first three pages of Google, though.  Point conceded.     Has anyone made a mega chart with all or most of the Cure's VA's other popular roles?   Just like Non Non Biyori episode one.    It was a rebuttal of the idea that an open-front dress is specific to a lily.  It's not.  It's pretty common in dress design.  Picture related, she's not a flower princess so you can't even get confused about that.            Might need an update.     Change the sub track to "with honorifics" and her name is back to normal.     Awesome, thanks.     Welcome to the Castle of Despair    Towa...?    There's no mistaking it, that's Towa!

Everyone of her special attacks has a fucking rose in the background with petals and her basic attacks are purple energy whips and blasts which can count as moonlight if you want to split hairs like the anon who started the whole thing.    Moonlight is as beautiful as 100 lilies!   How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif? Someone argue with me to increase the post count!     My favorite was Electro Woman and Dyna Girl. Could that be worked into a Precure show?     How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif?   It's because she's Dutch.      Electro Woman and Dyna Girl were completely tech based. That would be like making Batman a Precure.     How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif?  Because someone at Toei doesn't want to call a spade a spade.     In some other languages, Spade and Sword mean the same thing.    Well, yes. The playing card suit of spades is a stylized version of the swords found on tarot cards.    Thanks for ruining the joke    She got the label from daddy.

Just understand that sometimes the studio wanks Mana a bit too hard.  But other than that, it's mostly a good season.        Didn't at one point she go  fucking overdrive and make duplicates of herself to beat the final boss at the end?  That was pretty fucking OP.           Nevermind that shit! Why they call the girl Cure Peace when she spends the entire series kicking monste ass? That's ain't peaceful at all. Beat the shit out of monsters and representing peace. That's like Ghandi getting some street thugs in a head lock. You loose the right to call yourself the symbol of peace. Then you got Cure Black. How is she Cure Black? Is this some Rachel Dolezal shit? I'm flatter you want to be Cure Black but it what it's cracked up to be. Look at how the Black Ranger gets treated. Black Panther. Once you go black you get put to the back of the group photos with like you Shin from Kamen Rider.          Cure Black   Shows up an hour late to crossover battles       Then you got Cure Black. How is she Cure Black? Is this some Rachel Dolezal shit?  I chuckled.        What's with all the /b/ images in here tonight?       /wooo/ /m/ Chris Rock Not sure what /b/ you see.        There's some weirdness going on with their attacks, which are mostly flower-based but then you have the forte/fortissimo thing going, which is technically Italian but gives it away as purely musical with the f/ff visuals. They all have non-finishers that break theme, though.   Moonlight is mostly the lily motif, though, from her name Yuri, to (some) lilies blooming in moonlight, to the dress, to her heart flower being the (white?) lily. There are a few different readings for flowers in the Japanese interpretation, none of them fit perfectly; In the west, their association with funerals parallels the fact that everything she loves dies, but probably wasn't an intentional thing.  The violet rose thing is confusing, though. They're all over the background of her powers, and it's the backing flower for her solo purifying ritual. That said, Sunshine has a sunflower for hers, despite Itsuki's heart flower being the peony. (Blossom and Marine's purifying backers are the sakura and cyclamen, matching their respective heart flowers.)         There will never be a Precure who brandishes a sledgehammer like Triple H.   How cute! Today we get a little glimpse at these lovely cat's childhoods. Poor Hummy never managed to get the same growth spurt, but I don't think she minds.   What about Cure Rosetta Bitch can only speak Japanese      They all have non-finishers that break theme, though.   Butt Punch  is exactly what comes to mind when I think of flowers.   (Blossom and Marine's purifying backers are the sakura and cyclamen, matching their respective heart flowers.)  I feel like more effort went into Blossom and Marine as a cohesive unit, and that effort paid off. They were great. The added Cures didn't ever really jibe as a team when compared to the initial duet.   Tsubomi needed Triple H to sooth her flare-up after the butt punch.            Kanade  I was waiting for a chance to use this.     She should be Cure Cut    The Easter lily symbolizes purity, which is why it's often displayed at funerals. It's also a lily variety that's native to Japan.  I never really got why her image flower was the blue rose. I guess having it actually be a lily would have been a little TOO on-the-nose.       I guess having it actually be a lily would have been a little TOO on-the-nose.   It's a little girl show. They're allowed to use the obvious.  The one who had yet to bloom was TSUBOMI who became BLOSSOM.        So most people will recognize calling that the Peach Bomber as a Smash Bros reference, but it's actually a much (much) older gag than that, being the Japanese name given to fighting game moves where - typically only girl - attackers butt punched their opponents well before Smash existed. Thing is, the "peach" part isn't a reference to the butt, it's actually a reference to the vag (because of its appearance).   I'm actually not certain whether those lilies are used in Japanese funerals, isn't that a wholly western tradition?  Oh, I also forgot to mention that she's wearing a fricking blue rose on her lapel. I have no idea what's happening anymore.         The Japanese are weird about that. Mostly they like to be subtle but sometimes they like to on the nose. I think some creators/character designers want you to work for the reference.      Peach Bomber   Butt Punch  In pro wrestling it's called a hip attack and it is used by both men and women. The peach description has always been attribute to the butt in Japan not the vagina because not all vaginas look like the shape you're thinking of. I've seen instances where men refer to women's buttocks as pink like a peach or firm as a peach. Japanese peaches have a pink hue mind you.            This late already   fuck     Good to see this hasn't changed since I left.     This late already   Someone is imitating me  Fuck      Oh, I'm not professing to be some sort of vagina pro here. Just that that's been a metaphor for ages... like ancient Rome ages, and has butt-tons of examples in English literature.  Huh, I didn't think to question that it'd be different in Japan, but there you go. I appreciate the lesson. Now I wonder whether that's a pan-Asian thing: http://www.boredpanda.com/peaches-w<wbr>ith-lingerie-china/</wbr>       HIP CHECK HIP CHECK HIP CHECK  HIP CHECK   HOPE YOU DON'T LIKE GETTING CLOSE   HIP CHECK           like ancient Rome ages  Huh, I thought they were much more interested in discussing the peach-like nature of asses.  Words like "callipygian", and all that.  Their defining metaphor for the vagina was the sheath for their gladius swords, from which we get the word "cunt".         Oh good, people are using that. Looks like it was worth doing.   I haven't watched Doki but I want to cuddle Makopi.            I want to cuddle Makopi.  Makoπ is a qtπ.     So is Bukki.    Bukki is best girl in the series.

Onne blogger makes a point that lilies are used for 冠婚葬祭, which means 冠=ceremonies for an upgrade in social rank, 婚=marriages, 葬=funerals and 祭=appeasement of the spirits of the ancestors. Basically every kind of important ceremony. Chrysanthemum are also generally used and other white flowers (Callas, carnations, gladioli, etc.). Purple delphiniums are also popular. Of course they often use the flowers that the deceased liked too.  It may also depend on the religion: Buddhists and Shintoists use chrysanthemums, orchids and lilies. In Kansai, they also use the Japanese star anise. Christians use lilies.  Cluster amaryllises (Which name means "underworld/hell/funeral flower" in Japanese) were used in the past, but as far as I can tell by googling they are not used any more. The only half relevant result is a mother asking help to tell her little son that the flower she bought for her mother day is a bad one, and there are no images of funerals using them.           Translate Please!!!    Not sure where you get this idea that peaches represent vaginas when even in the west peaches have been used as a butt symbolism for centuries if not longer.  Even the Japanese use clams as a symbolism for vagina. NSFW but google あかがいエロ and you see what I mean.      Already translated in the previous thread.    That one is  here. Previous ones are  here.      It's a short synopsis of the next episode. "Princess vs Princess" and the other is a Twilight episode after. Literally nothing of importance is told. Wait it out.     Episode 22 actually tells pretty important stuff, like Twilight being fully redeemed already and more brainwashing incoming, crushing many anons' delusions of her remaining evil or "in a gray zone" after becoming Scarlet.    It's not important to those who would rather wait and see.    Those who would rather wait and see are not important either.

Kawaii    they mistook his thoughts as actual narration, and never caught onto the fact that it was disconnected from what was actually happening    Characters without flaws are not interesting anon    under 5'2"   thug     It's because he's a flawed but well written character?    What?     same height as the 10 year old child on your team   gangsta       tfw taller than Feitan     Is that suppose to be impressive?    yes, because I'm 5'2 he's a fucking midge     best onisan    I want to  put  Feitan  in my pocket .    He's not quite. Maximum 4'10" for midgets.     tfw shorter than Feitan     I hope you're a girl. Otherwise holy shit, you're a fucking mega manlet.     Hisoka really is a bro even if he only chooses to be a bro to people he wants to murder in the future.    Not him, but /a/ does seem to have a lot of manlets, I'm 5'4", nothing wrong with being short though,  if you're gay  for all the /a/ manlets that aren't, sorry.     tfw gay and kind of want to be a manlet  not that I'm unhappy with my height     Yeah but Killuafags tend to ignore Killua's flaws.   Why do Kalluto and Alluka wear girl clothes? Did their mum desperately want a daughter? Is it a Zoldyck family tradition for everyone besides the heir? (I'm assuming not since we've seen Alluka and Kalluto in male clothing in the flashbacks but if so, did Illumi and Milluki wear girl clothes as small children?) Did Alluka start it because they wanted to be the little girl and Kalluto copied because he wanted Killua to love him?   Killua hate  I was going to say "Killua did nothing wrong" but I know he made a lot of mistakes. Like letting Gon delude himself, never telling him his true feelings and then getting upset because Gon isn't a mind-reader and so but eveybody is being too harsh on him. Seeing his best friend sacrifice himself, carring what's basically his corpse on his back and then see him wither away must have been a traumatic experience to Killua and just like Gon, he's only a 12 years old boy that went through a lot of shit.     I think the kalluto copying alluka one is most accurate    I think that its a backlash against the previous Gonhate. How many people thought that Gon was just being selfish, realizing that a character that they once thought of as an innocent victim wasn't so innocent after all. Part of this comes from reading the actual manga, which makes the difference in Killua's perspective and what's actually going on more obvious. The fact that Gon learns and actually and grows up, while Killua doesn't and even guilt trips Gon, just makes it even worse.  The fact that many Killuafags can't admit to his mistakes without trying to make excuses for him doesn't help.      But Anon, Alluka is a girl so of course she's going to dress like one    I'd just like to point out that Killua did change a lot and grow as a person from the first arc where we see him, but still has to grow.    I miss edgy Killua. He was fun.    Would old Killua be reluctant about killing Pitou right there? Probably not.    While Killua has changed a lot since his first appearance, he hasn't learned anything from the CA arc.     because I'm 5'2  Damn     Killua has too many flaws and not enough likeable traits.    Most if not all characters in HxH are flawed. It doesn't justify Killua's popularity.    leorio will never carry his own arc     implying he won't have his own character arc in the DC     I kinda think that that's Leorio's appeal, that in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats he's just a guy with a good head on his shoulders who wants to do the right thing.   I'm also guessing the Japs don't like him because he's not the typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon) or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)       in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats   typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)        typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)      Oh you're going to get it now.     this entire post        M-m-muh kiddie protag isn't dumb just because he's observant and has a knack for combat!    M-m-muh other protags aren't edgy even though one literally rips people's hearts out and comes from a family of assassins and the other will do anything to get his clan's eyes back, including torture and murder!   Oh yeah, another reason Leorio doesn't get attention. Lack of bloodline. Nips love their family legacy and heritability.   Gon is the son of an incredible hunter     Killua comes from a family of insanely talented assassins    Kurapika comes from a special clan with magic eyes   If Leorio's dad was the world's best doctor or something I'd fucking guarantee they'd like him more.                  In the manga translation I read, somebody in the background says Killua's name.  I guess it was just randomly put there.      I love Leorio but damn your post is embarassing. First of all, he is pretty popular in Japan. Not as popular as the others because he didn't get as much paneltime, but still decently popular.  He even is miss Japan 2013's husbando.  Also, just like the other protagonists, he has a lot of potential, which is the reason why Hisoka didn't kill him.  Also, Gon is pretty far from being typical or dumb, you'd think the CA arc made that clear enough. Just like Killua hasn't been edgy since the first arc, or when Kurapika felt sick after killing Uvo, realized how unfulfilling his revenge was and was angry at himself for putting Gon and Killua in danger.        You must like danmachi    Nothing wrong with being a manlet, it is not like being a lardass     danmachi      Although Kurapika did fully backtrack on that until he met Leorio again  and fucked Mizaistom      It's never said he killed or tortured, and it'd be out of character considering the events of Yorkshin. I don't know where that theory came from.     True, just meant he went edge again.  The cow solves everything.        the pika lost his humanity  ;_;      implying  Leorio might not be a doctor yet but he already knows how to heal     What would happen if Killua went with Kurapika instead of Leorio?     Less suffering, but weaker.      killua in charge of emotional support    Did Pitou die thinking her death mattered and without knowing how Pouf tricked her? That's pretty fucking sad when you think about it.     How did Pouf trick her?     By pretending they got Komugi back.     I swear I love this person soooo much but I'm not going make them feel better  is this the face of autism?       her        The very last beast.   Fuck, why do I've the feeling that kurapika and prince bateman will both die in the fight. Even though he still has some business with the spiders.   Knowing how unpredictable and anti-climatic is togashi.          This meme is still alive?     BECAUSE GON IS MY MOST PRECIOUS FRIEND   treats a mermaid and a squid that he just met better than Gon      I bet Kurapika will die without getting the last of the eyes.  But anyway, the Troupe is coming to the DC too.      i bet that kurapika will be defeat by feitan .     the more he loves someone, the worse he treats them  how long until Alluka has to go through some shit and Killua just watches and blames her afterwards?     If Kurapika manages to get his chains on Feitan quickly without hurting him enough that he can use Burnt by the Sun he might be able to defeat him.     the more he loves someone, the worse he treats them  He must really love his aniki.     nah, he's just scared of and respects him    Post more Pika    No.    The best kind of love.   What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?   Sensei takes them to beach to relax after the competition.    what a relentless bitch    Please don't insult the happy couple.      I fucking wish   Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?   Apparently Luffy's D will pierce the heavens?     2 other One Piece threads out there   starts a third!

Nigga I ain't even been banned before    do you?   What do you think this bastard is up to?   Taking Haki cocks up the ass    Hope the scene switches back to sanji at the end of the chapter.    Only one other OP thread and is reaching bump limit.  Do you even know how to use the catalog?      Sounds good.   I am sure he does not. Clearly that comment in no way showed any ability of using the said function...      reminder that one piece &gt;  two pieces    For a second I thought I read "beginning". That would be fucking cruel!    yfw Doflamingo had another pair of glasses and the arc goes on for another year   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359   The one piece is actually the murder devil fruit and it just lets you murder murder pistol everyone ever and they all die in a giant murder circle they're all dead except you,   AND THEN THERE WAS BLOOD COMMING OUT OF YOU AND THE BLOOD GOT EVERYWHERE EVEN ON A SMALL CHILD AND LITTLE DOG!!!!   IT WAS DANGEROUS TO GO IN THE WATER WITH A DEVIL FRUIT BEFORE BECAUSE YOU WOULD SINK BUT NOW ITS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BLOOOOOOOOOOOOD COMMING OUT OF YOU AND ALL THE SHARKS WILL COME SWIMMING AT YOU AND EAT YOU.

Why is belly dance so hot?    we finally get to see his eyes next chapter   doffyfag tears  What, are you retarded ? Sure it's not a btfo thread but retardation wise it might as well be.        &gt;we finally get to see his eyes next chapter  What the fuck are you talking about?     His glasses fell off, silly.     glasses break last chapter   implying Oda won't reveal what his eyes look like next chapter     Doffy doesn't have eyes, he uses observation haki to see    It's not. It's the girl.     That'd be neat but I doubt it. He probably has plain, normal eyes. We know his right one is normal at the very least. Now the left one might be damaged somehow but we can't be sure.    His left eye is  a flamingo!    Doflamingo's glasses were actually a device to suppress his haki.   Calling it, his eyes won't be revealed yet, but Oda will tease us.    banned    Did anyone actually expect a shonen villain to win?    The time of teasing of over, Oda had his fun, now is the time for the reveal.    they do, sometimes    It sometimes happens, but just to allow the MC to come back fuck villain's shit backwards.     Crocodile won twice, Kizaru/Kuma won, Magellan won.     No but somehow retards in this thread make a confusion between being a Doffyfag and expecting him to win. Probably because anyone of average intelligence predicted Doffy wasn't out with just Redhawk.   What do you think Doflamingo's eyes are like?  They're probably kawaii circles.     It's not the destination, it's the journey       "D" pierces the heavens    Spoiler when?  Duh!   Doffy is Ruffy's father, obviously     I hope the penguinposter gets banned too    Exactly like pic related.    Shut the fuck up, Dentist anon is cool.    left one is missing    I hope shitposters get banned too     Say hello to Monkey  Drill  Luffy, anon.      What do you think Doflamingo's eyes are like?   photoshop Rocinante's eye onto Dofla   literally Zoro   This is why you're the master Oda        Because he can only draw three different faces?    Hopefully the entire board gets banned    MODS=GODS     (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)     i don't understand. what happened? did i miss something?    Press F5.    yfw Doffy gets up from that    What?    Exactly where luccifags belong     No I just want this shit to be over and stay that way.     HAHAHA SUCK IT LUCCIFAGS, WORST SAGA VILLAIN AFTER HODY    Followed by a sad, one page flashback of him shooting Rosinate, then fell back, unconscious. That would be good.    Quick, guys! Reply  with your best One Piece laughter!   no, like, why was he banned? i didn't see     Chronic shitposting.     This shit of villains being redeemed or feeling regret in some way needs to stop. If he gets up he should laugh and spill the 'secret'    But that hasn't happened in One Piece, has it? Except probably Moria's rant.    Just make the mods aware of the penguin poster and he will get banned as well.  Mods have banned attentionwhores before especially those that forced memes and also blog about their lives on /a/.  Penguin poster is an attentionwhore and also samefags his own replies as well and also tries to circlejerk with his equally attentionwhoring fanclub.          He was banned for constant ban evading.   Instead of waiting until his ban was over, the cancerous Luccifag kept evading his ban so now hopefully he gets a permaban.      Remembering when he used to be a woman and wondering if he will ever become Luffy's nakama    Doffy is such a step up from the older villains in every way, it would be disappointing if he 'fainted' and went to the background/Impel Down quietly following that fight like all the others.    Don't worry, Sugar will turn him into toy.   Reposting from last thread   Sweet sweet justice       Normal eyes with his left gouged out.      Thousand arrows ?! Zygarde is that you ?     aww, really? he'll be back within a day though. I can bet my leg on it.   Why is Usopp worst Strawhat?   Cause of his dick nose     Why the left one?     Why are you such a faggot?    But Sanji and Chopper are the worst.    We've seen his right one      I just wanted some pasta  ;_;       Luffy is worst strawhat. Usopp is best. Everyone else is good.    Shit I don't even remember that. Guess I'm a faggot    Ussop is best, Robin is mai waifu, and  Nami  is the worst    But Luffy is. He's literally the worst pirate of the worst generation.    so he's basically Zoro    Because he is a pathetic simpering coward  The only time he ever fought seriously was against his own captain over a broken ship and only because he knew Luffy wouldn't kill him.  The only fights he ever won were  1. Because he was so pathetic his self esteem actually could not get lower 2. Because he lost so badly that it startled Sugar   But he sniped sugar   Thats all            when do we get spoilers?   He fought seriously in Arabasta.    That wasn't solo    not as pathetic as Rebecca and her brain dead fans.      Oh shit, I didn't notice this.    But Usopp is the best Straw Hat, anon. He's well-written, almost always gets an interesting developing scene each arc, and has really grown a lot on his journey.  Brook is the worst. He has done jack shit since Thriller Bark aside from pointless singing and beating those godawful skulljokes to death.   b-but he beat Jora!  Wow, he sliced up the fat lady whose power is making art. Truly he is the most useful crew member.         I hate to admit it, but you're right. He was so cool in Thriller Bark but he doesn't do much now    While I don't hate Brook, I definitely think he's the "worst" one. Sounds kinda harsh, but Oda needs to go with him somewhere.    m8 he saved Usopp and Zoro on Fishman Island with his new ghost ability   I don't know if I want this arc to finish, because I fear we will get another fisherman island shit arc again afterwards.   Brook is the one who still has to be developed.  Also, he's been totally alone for +50years, he's just not used to interact with people yet. I hope the Wano saga will help him finding his new self (at least his soul was in Ryuma's dead body in thriller bark, i hope it's something)      things like this don't count for fightfags    I'm hoping that Wano being a samurai country will open up for more character development for Brook.    If the New World really is paralleling the first half of the Grand Line, then the next arc will be the "Skypiea".   yfw Oda randomly sends the crew to another sky island for 2 years        he doesn't do much now  he was the most crucial character in this arc     True I realised I was replying to marineford babbies, also I just remembered Brook sometimes drops quite a few knowledge bombs about the world.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127110374  GO DIE AGAIN SKULLHEAD!    Haha I have deleted the failed spoiler attempt before I could be massively flamed for it    Neither the opponents.    lolwat    fairy nuff    because of him the fucking toys turned back and without him Luffy and Law would have been turned into toys and everything would have gone to hell    The people who are going to get the most character development in Wano are going to be:   Zoro   Brook   Kinemon   Momonoske   At least I hope they will.            Kyros was actually, the one toy with free will and knowledge of what really happened to convince the Tontattas and Usopp into action    Hello animefag here, how far behind the manga is the anime?

Not just on Dressrosa but he even sniped Buffalo and Baby 5 during Punk Hazard but people always forget that.       Not just on Dressrosa but he even sniped Buffalo and Baby 5 during Punk Hazard but people always forget that.  you mean Cesar?       Sugar was just a rehash of the Chu fight, but considerably more pathetic     It doesn't matter whether the fight was pathetic, what he 'did' was certainly of note.  I mean, most of Dressrosa is calling him God now and he awakened his CoO.       I wish.   So, only like one in a million people is supposed to have conqueror's haki, but the suddenly every other person seems to have it. I find that a bit annoying.    It's more that those one on a million are all gathered in the same place.   That's how the NW is.       But that is silly. Like, does anyone who posesses it just feel like going to the New World?    Those who have Conqueror's haki are bound to be the top dog, and thusly will butt heads more often with other top dogs.     8 People   6 left   Everyone has it        Those with it are stronger leaders - they inevitably end up there.     It was all of them, shooting rocks at Baby 5 and Buffalo while the handcuffs land on Caesar.    chosen one fags in a nutshell.     No, but the ones who make it there are more likely to have said powers. Its basic fucking logic.  Also why do people think doffyfag people are going to be upset? I said from the start that there is no way in fuck that luffy will be able to 1v1 or even really 2v1 doffy. And all of your cuckboys denied it. And guess who was right. Me, a doffyfag. Luffy need law AND all the citizens of dressrosa to buy his ass time just to knock out dofla. He was never going to be strong enough to 1v1 someone as strong as doffy. Get rekt shitters.      Will Zoro have conq haki? I mean, Rayleigh has it.    He hasn't shown it so far, but who knows.   inb4 Ashura haki retcon.       That's like saying that a 140+ iq is 1 in a million and then wondering how everyone in mensa seems to be that 1 in a million.    Assuming OP has 8 billion people like we do that's 8 thousand people with conqueror's haki     Doubt the OP world has 8 billion (probably not even a billion), but there should certainly be a reasonable amount.     How the fuck does six people equate to   every other person has it     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N-U<wbr>TMrbo6vw</wbr>  [ ]  This deserves more views      act like a retard , like every main/villian ever   he needs law and other people hurrr     BTFO T F O     robin eyes confirmed    doffy is blown through the colliseum into the scrap yard, or trash heap, or however it was called   Fucking pottery.       strong enough punch to level the city itself   doesn't even put a scratch on Doflamingo's body even though any busoshoku haki he was using was most likely deactivated the second he was hit and lost consciousness  Either Doflamingo is still alive and kicking or that's just not how bodies and physics work      DEEPEST LORE  ODA = GOD      Looks like the ground collapsed into the scrapyard along with Doffy.     YFW he's still standing although barely and Rebecca finishes him off hailing back to how she told Luffy she'll defeat him at the beginning of the arc.   Please, no.        implying Law won't kill him while everyone is happy   CRAWLING IN MY SKIN        raises again after punch   not a scratch on his body   "looks like I'll have to use THAT"   activates eye power          activates eye power   another Rayleigh flashback   It didn't work huh   What will you do now Luffy?          Today I will defeat Doflamingo!   That would be one of the biggest trolls in manga history if Oda makes her words come true. Thankfully, she's shit so it won't. Would be worth it for the reactions though.        Madara obliterated the entire cast    Being this fucking new.   So does anyone know where I can read updated One Piece Party chapters? There's supposed to be this chapter where Luffy was asking Law if he had a tattoo on his penis, too...   Finally!     that pic   I will cry like a bitch that day     Daily Reminder:  Doffy's real face revealed     For a sec I thought you meant Gorilla.    It's because they're being funneled towards the New World/One Piece, isn't it? Those who take notice of their Conqueror's Haki are people with strong ambition, and it seems that everyone's goal is to either conquer the seas (which means going to the New World to fight the Yonkou, I guess) or getting to One Piece (and thereby becoming Pirate King?).    Nah    literally who?    why did this but not luffyfag/doffyfagfag not get banned?    The 'superficial' Red Hawk left more of a mark on Doffy's stomach than Leo Bazooka.   King Kong hit his face, besides blood that won't leave a mark at all unless Doffy is the new Duval.       Surprising that a hot body has created a legion of fans regardless of skill or talent   Do you even real life?      Holyshit Luffy actually killed him. Doffy is dead, no way he's still alive after taking such a hit.   Where has lucy been this entire arc? He was killing it in the coliseum and then disappeared all of a sudden. He had potential to be a powerful ally for the crew.    haha this meme is really funny just like the really super funny iroquois plisken jokes haha lol haha    Meanwhile in /a/cademy city   Don't run.   Just let it happen.          I have this classmate she's level 5 and is very good at sports, I think I've fallen for her. How can I get myself to date her?

Misaka Misaka hurts!" Then the darkness of a alleyway, Kamijo tries to stick it into Mikoto Misaka but can't get get it hard due to touching it with his Imagine Breaker. Kuroko rushes in from the dark to strike him down with a trash can.      Man. How long has it been since any update on that anime?   I swear its been like years, if I remember anything past the miserable collection of other moeblob ecchi shit I've had to repress in my head.  Are the producers just not caring anymore?        Stop posting your bullshit online, there will be hell to pay if they see this.    Sauce?    How do you call "controlling water with your mind"?  I need a dude like that to paint my room.      Literally any telekinetic worth shit can control stuff like water, I wouldnt use it to paint a room though, it basically never comes out even    well, i have this unlucky high school level 0 friend but somehow alot of girls seem attracted to him.  I heard he has alot of real magician friends. you should ask him      Real Magicians     Has anyone tried to poison this faggot yet?    You'd have to go around poisoning the coffee in every vending machine, there'd be too much collateral damage.

Dat terminator reference    Where's that Styil guy who yells out for kanzaki?  I'm Aihana Etsu.   That shitty tower blocks my view.     Sure thing bro, I got a couple jackhammers we can use.  We all know that Moot hasn't left us and is just hiding inside that damn building.       Yeah? And I'm Misaka Mikoto, AMA.    who?   Just yesterday, in Seventh Mist, I saw a blond-haired man getting chased by a girl in a tracksuit. Is Academy City this strange?  I was hanging out at a cafe the other day in District 7 when suddenly this fag shows up and starts attacking this girl with a flower headband. He kicked her and dislocated her shoulder and was about to curb stomp her when another guy with white hair showed up by throwing an ATM at her before I got out of there.  How often does this shit happen in D7? I wanted to help her but I'm just a level 1 and my power sucks.   Flower girl if you are reading this I'm sorry that I couldn't do anything       The Roman Catholic Church did nothing wrong. Except Biagio. Biagio did everything wrong.

Since we failed last time can we finally group up on that annoying spiky haired dude?  How would power levels work in /a/cademy city, would seeing how much anime and manga you've read and watched be an indication of your strength?   Dude, he's friends with one of the level 5. I've also heard, he basically never lost a fight, no matter howmany he fought. No way I'll fight him.    Power = GUTS!    All of my yes! That dude punched me just because I helped some middle schoolers up! He spouted things like 'Taking her as your prey' what the hell dude!    You're that weird guy with white headband aren't you?   I am Aihana Etsu!   He's just a level 0 so I've heard, what can go wrong?    Nope. Just an ordinary level 0 who saw that guy use that awesome ability. Super Amazing Punch!    Ah, sorry. I thought you're him   does he even know how to use computer?       I recommend you don't fight that idiot. I know him, and he's one of the most powerful people in all of academy city. He can stop Level 5 abilities, like mine.    Woah really?     level 5  Are you trying to doxx yourself?     ...Whoops.    What, has there been an update of S3 for Index?   I heard Tree Diagram was broken. Is this rumor true? How could this happen?  Where my level 3 bros at?   Aleister wont allow his dead.   MISAKA A SHIT A SHIIIIIIIT    W-WHAT?! Why, I oughta...

I have absolutely no idea why that worked for him.    No, my friend has it covered. She can get in all sorts of places...   If only she wasn't trying to get inside of me!       I don't remember that scene from Fate.   THE SPIKEY HAIRED BOY FINALLY TALKED TO ME   Really? Tell us! Tell us! What did he said to you?!

Guys what if we pretend were an imageboard in an anime universe: the thread   Ftfy      2025   Not being at least Level 3   Level 4 here, and I seriously pity the lot of you. Researchers are coming to me every other week, asking me if I can aid in their experiments and whatnot. Not only do I feel my powers develop, I get paid handsomely for it as well. A couple years ago I used to be Level 3, but just a few months ago, I was finally reclassified to Level 4 from how much my esper powers grew.

Because she was characterized damn well.    I know this is you, anniebot. Don't lie.   Thats not Sasha  is anniebot a  girl    I only liked her when she laughed at Armin.  I want to say Mikasa is the best but she is actually really boring.     How would either wall breach had gone if the full SL had been there? Slightly less casualties maybe?       It isn't Annie, it is Jean, who was by the way confirmed the winner of the Mikasab owl in the Live action movie (just saw the thread in the archive; funny how deluded autists thought it was supposed to represent Levi somehow).  I am celebrating victory over here, whilst EM/YH autistcucks are getting cucked the fuck out.  Allah akbar. *shoots his AK47 in the air*        kill yourself    *teleports behind you* *unzips katana* *slashes your AK47 in half* *teleports away with a cheeky grin*  Nothin personnel kid          Ymirfag owns a katana  Literally nobody is surprised.     I only read the AK47 part of your post Not gonna bother with shipping shit m8     Based Jean.   Is EH the hero we need?   EH is freedom from the tyranny of YH and EM.    are you high?   It's now official that Hanji is a tranny, Isayama just said it on his blog   dubs    nice one     the neckbeard has to post the same 5 pictures he has over and over again because Japan will never make any new ones for his delusions     We knew that already. What retard still thinks he's female at this point?    Because we haven't seen anything of her in so fucking long you forget about her and then remember her and you think she's the best, but really she was okay.    Annie a shit.    you sound underage    And has not been changed for years thanks to crystalization.  The rest of her corps' characterizations are now very messy.     so whats going on now, i stopped reading when that bitch got crystalized and they were trying to get to the basement, did they ever make it?  why are the walls titans? whos the gorilla man? why isnt everyone dead when they were all dying left and right  lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder        you'll never marry Annie    Hange is best, everybody else is a shit.   http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8867221.html  So Hanji is both male and female?  </wbr>  http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mt3WMO<wbr>fh2Wo</wbr>  [ ]  Dat kiss.     The fuck you say...    Annie worst girl    Sauce:  @hituzi2gou     Why do people care about the kiss?  best shingeki isnt a character but a concept. it's the concept of dropping shingeki and finding some self respect   It's inexpected I guess. And also it's probably because it's Mikasa.    Because Mikasa is only good for shipping fodder for self-inserting twats     Who is best kyojin and why is it Annie?     Blorphole Poover Poobar    It's okay, I got him covered.    Annie is love Annie is life Annie is the sun that warms my heart Annie a miracle of the universe Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out           think they will finale be going there next chapter or atleast to Shiganshina District      First king had them build the walls with hardening abilities.      monkey trouble he is a shifter and the one leading the others. He is waiting at Shiganshina District for them.     reanimation jutsu             I haven't been that legitimately sad in a long time.    Annie a shit.  Can't even run away properly and just gives up on life.      Butthole a love.    Blorp oozes from the Butthole.    Serves him right for the semen demon he is.   Eren x Annie OTP    lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder  SnK in a nutshell, I wonder how Flegel and the reporters are still alive.     I think the series actually does a decent job making you care about the cannon fodder characters.      Who, Marco? Petra? The rest of Levi's squad? Nifa? Mike? Not really.    Same guy, I wanted to add that I only know their names because I lurk here, otherwise I might only remember Marco and that's because Jean couldn't shut up about it in the anime. In the manga he was just a random dead guy.    It makes me sad that titans are primarily supposed to be war machines and this'll never happen.    The character grew on me when I read them in manga compared to the anime.    Maybe if you watched the anime first. For someone that reads/watches it for the first time most of these characters are just random redshirts.   I wonder what will the ending be. Most likely the entire wall will be destroyed but then what?  Was pretty cool.   Hey man.  You intentionally left your trip on.     Lelouch is intentionally a faggot, news at 11.   Does anyone have the most recent chart? I was withouth internets for 2 weeks, I missed the release hype  Who is Monkey Trouble, am I supposed to be able to tell who he is? It's just a long haired glasses dude     That guy who led the squade when taking back Trost and had Mikasa and Eren's back.  Those two guys who died last at Utgard.  That black haired chick who died because Eren's an idiot.       That guy   Those two guys   That black haired chick  So you agree with me.       Hey, I never said anything about knowing their names.    I thought Levi squad will live because they are like elite of elites.    Annie is eliter.    There no memorable I just remember all their names   Damage control        Damage control  Do you even know what that means? I only added more to my rant, I didn't take anything back.     To jump off your "Marco is just a random dead guy" comment, he's really not. His portrait is featured at the start of every volum of the manga, whereas other dead characters have their's removed.   I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow. Hopefully we'll find out when Annie gets uncrystalised.      Mmkay you don't remember every last one of them or anything I didn't even remember some of those names damn anon they really had an impact on you.     More like I lurk these threads a lot.        Historia a bestest.        You love them don't you I bet you cried when each one was killed off     N-No I didn't ;_;    Why I can't but agree with this.   Not that guy but I loved Petra, thinking she is qt and may be spared but not a single tears was shed when she died       It's one of the reasons why his characterfags think he'll come back.      I might be the only one who didn't give a shit about any of the fodder. Especially Levi Squad, they were too obvious.    Me neither. Although I wish Nanaba didn't die so soon.    Do not sexualize the queen.    No way he's coming back, but there has to be more to it than him just being a normal guy who died somehow.     I hope Levi died.   I remember Ian leaving an impression on me, he was an upstanding man and I'm sad he died.    Marco is Ymir's time travelling son from the future.  Marco will come back as a titan, Isayama said it.  Marco was just pretending to be dead, didn't you see that his left leg was moving?          I mean I didn't cry but I was like, aww, damn :/.     Ymir   Ever getting pregnant   I see through your lies.       :/  Get out.     She's the father.   So I heard Hanji was confirmed a beautiful transwomyn?   Fyi Ymir was just pretending to be a lesbian. Her true love, Bert, impregnated her and she's currently in labor. Baby Marco will be born soon and we can finally have our canon Jeanmarco.     :/  Scawwy angry face anon     Sounded more like she's a herm    It was just Isayama just fucking with us about the incognite thing.  &gt;2015   &gt;Still doesn't get Isayama's jokes       Marco is totally a BY spawn how did I not notice.      He sounded pretty serious.    Well are you up to date?    Bert actually has standards, he would impregnate Annie not some tranny-looking thing      So does Annie. He might have a chance with Pigner.    Do you think she will just be queen of orphans or will she get to try her hand at other things too?    If Annie had standard she would love Bert, not that self hating, crybaby titan with a huge role that he can't handle that is Er- wait, fuck.    I didn't say the Rageturd is any better.    That's who Annie likes though, and he's the same as Bert.  I like both anyway, she should too.     Not really.    Annie likes Armin       All this delusion.     Eren and Bert are completely different.  Bert is a pawn who's just going along with what's expected of him.  Eren is going against the world, and trying to change things. Annie respects that. I can't imagine she respects Bert.      You're a delusional retard    They are equally terrible characters though.    Ymir would rape his pathetic ass before he even touches her.    Look who is talking.    Eren is the scouting legion's pawn, which is quite obvious. He always does what he's ordered to. At first he wanted to go against the world but that's not really what happens, he's just a pet.     thinks Annie likes Armin   calls others delusional  /snk/ never ceases to amaze.      Only Reiner would want to touch Bert's second weak spot.    That's a trait that many characters have expressed respect and admiration for, it probably means nothing in terms of romanticism. Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point, maybe others that I can't recall right at this moment.    Historia admired Eren as well because he knew what he wanted to do. Even if he's their tool he still keeps a sense of self even though right now he's depressed over eating Grisha.    It also means that Annie has zero respect for Bert who is the complete opposite of Eren. If there's lack of respect there's also little room for romantic feelings to develop.     Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point  You mean Annie and Bert? Because Annie and Bert have pretty much the same worldview from what they said. About humans that go with the flow and being normal I mean.     Bert also knows well what he wants and has to do. Out of BRA he's the only one that never wavered from their goal even if he just wants to return home.    Bert's just a coward.     depressed  He showed symptoms of PTSD in the latest chapter.     Eren is just a whiny ragetard.    I'm thinking of the conversation between Eren and Historia during the chapter where they were in the cabin. Did she not say something about how she admires that about Eren? I could be remembering it wrong, it's been a while since I read the chapter    Maybe you should read the manga for a change.    It's much more emphasized in Annie's case, though, and she's very selective about who she associates with. I don't have anything against BA, but I don't see it realistically happening.    I thought it was more like envy.    From memory she was saying that she's jealous of the fact that he seems to know exactly what he's doing with his life.    And Bert is a whiny fag.    Sorry my bad, you're right. I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow as Annie or Historia describe him. From humanity's viewpoint, Eren does that and Bert is a pawn, but from the titan's viewpoint it's the other way around. If you look at it from a third person's viewpoint, both of them are pawns for their cause.      You both are getting to my words. I like both characters but in the end they're not much different from each other. Bert has acted like a ragetard at some points and Eren has acted like a crybaby. Both claim they have no will but both do everything to help their cause.     I think it's because Eren always calls other people out on not fighting back. At least early on he was always giving speeches about how humanity needed to stand against the titans.   Also, he did put in a hell of a lot of effort to become a soldier. That's respectable in its own right.      Eren put a lot of effort to become a soldier but BRA put much more effort to become warriors. Sure they're not the same, but Eren's will to go against the flow was there only in the beginning. After Levi and Erwin took him under their control he just helps the scouting legion with everything, it just happens that he agrees with their cause.  I expect Bert and Reiner to go against MT for whatever reason, since it's starting to look like MT is doing it for selfish reasons and BR disagree, but that's just speculation on my part.      Bert will go awol to save Annie. Reiner will directly go against MT and die for it.    Bert loves Annie but he wouldn't leave Reiner to die. Reiner always gets into trouble but that doesn't mean that Bert agrees with it, that's why he's always running after him.    Either way he managed to get two girls to envy or admire him because Eren comes across as a strong-willed person. Bert doesn't really have anything admirable about him.    So Reiner and Eren are equally dumb. Although Eren's behavior was even more retarded and got his team mates killed.    Bert is more strong willed that Reiner or Annie though, he only thinks he's not.    The SL's goals coincide with Eren's and it was a dream of his to join them. Why would he deter from that anyway? He still has a strong spirit to him and if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it.    Annie hides in a crystal and Reiner created a second personality, it's not like they're much competition.     He still has a strong spirit to him  Not as much, at least during the last arc that changed.  if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it  Really? He disagreed with the SL's intentions about Annie but he still helped them catch her.       Is this some sort of pretending to be retarded? Reiner wouldn't have developed a second personality if he had Bert's will and Annie wouldn't have hidden if she had his will. Although I think Annie did it to protect the information, not just her life. Point still stands about Reiner.    He also knows Annie is responsible for the deaths of many soldiers and is considered an enemy to them first and foremost.    Sure, but he still disagreed and he still did it. He doesn't do what he wants he does what the SL wants.    My point is that out of a guy with a split personality and a girl who hid in a rock, of course Bort is going to look like he's strong willed. But compared to others aside from his tagalongs he's a pussy.    Because for the most part he agrees with them. Do you think he would be okay with it if for some reason the SL told him to kill Mikasa and Armin?    He looks strong willed because Reiner and Annie are cowards too.    Annie was willing to risk being eaten by Titans. That's something.   What was he meant to do, let a Titan rampage through Stohess?        Sure I guess, he's far from strong willed in general. The problem is that people describe him as weak willed even compared to RA, hell some say he's more weak willed than the whole cast when that's not true at all. He just hates himself and thinks he's more worthless and cowardly than he really is.     Bert is just a weakling who shows signs of strength sometimes. Other characters are strong that at times show signs of weakness, as most humans do anyway.    Pretty much. He's just the least cowardly of a trio of cowards      Depends. Most humans are either weak that shows signs of strength or strong that show signs of weakness. He's not more strong willed than many characters in the cast, but he's not the most weak willed of the cast, unlike what the consensus thinks.    He is weak-willed in comparison to many others though.    That's what I'm saying too, in case you can't read.   Fuck off hetshipping scum. Only YH is canon and maybe EM.   He's not the most weak willed but he's definitely in that area.    Yes anon, in case you didn't notice we agree on that for quite a while.    I know that, I'm reiterating because some think otherwise.   How do Mikasafags feel about this?  Is it true that Mikasa's actress filmed a naughty scene with Shikishima's actor?   Jesus Christ, I wonder if Isayama will comment on this if the fanbase gets too loud.    No.    I like how that artist had to change Mikasa's expression and also turn the OC into Levi.    I'm looking forward to the massive amounts of LM fanart that this will bring about.   tfw Levi with a mustache      LM isn't as popular as people like to believe. Plus it's just a live action offshoot so who cares?    Yeah but we know nothing about him anyway. MT is anon-kun.   Am I the only one who doesn't care about Levi or Mikasa?   I guess anything's better than EM.     I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow.  Isayama killed him earlier than planned because he "didn't stand out"     You're never the only one, now stop shitposting.    Mikasa is qt but manlet a shit.    No, Kenny was the only interesting Ackermann. He had more personality than LM combined.    Marco was just a random good guy, like pretty much every redshirt in the series that dies two chapters after getting introduced.    Get out, neckbeard.  Kenny was just an autistic manchild.      I fucking miss when all we has were these ass threads and sometimes discussion.    The face of a cuck    We can still make the ass discussions happen. I'll take anything over more shipping cancer.    Annie has the best ass     neckbeard  Women with taste don't like the manlet. They go for better options like Erwin or Reiner.     You mean sleepy time threads?    Annie never to to see that.  Anyway Eren's still bent on his dream, he just recognizes the SL has the same dream as him. That's why he wanted to join in the first place so of course he'd do what they told him to. Eren has radical ideals for humanity that trump his regard for his own life and he's working towards achieving that, that's what Annie respected, and what Bert lacked.      That too, and Bert has a more gentle attitude and looks in general, and it may make him look even more weak willed than he is.   In the end I agree with the anons that say both Bert and Eren are pawns and just follow around orders. Which makes sense since they're soldiers and that's what soldiers do.      The difference is Bert's still going "with the flow" it's just that the flow is to do their mission. Like you said he's doing this because he wants to go home, it's not on the altar of a higher purpose unlike Marlo and Eren's goals.     I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow  Eren's living in a society of cattle. Everyone is encouraged to live with their heads down inside the walls, but he always wanted to go out.     Depends on how you see it, Eren wants to see the outside world, Bert wants to go home, they both do what's necessary for it. Along with their dream they also help humanity on Eren's case, and MT or the village on BRA's case.   Eren and Bert combined would make the perfect Shinji.   Nah I meant the threads way before and no one had any idea that Isayama would waste most of his girls into irrelevancy.    Well sleepy time had nice discussions too.    Erwin is a pleb and Reiner, again, looks like a deformed dyke. Tell me, what is so distasteful about the manlet? He has a better personality than the both of them.      Nice bait.    Manlet doesn't even have a personality.    Shinji a shit tho. Kaworu a best.    I wasn't implying that he isn't.    He's loyal, introverted feeler and consistent. What's not about him to like?     I have come to appreciate the manlet. He's better than characters like Eren and Bert. Erwin is good too.    So it makes sense that worst shingekis Bert and Eren combined make Shinji.    He's just a retarded lapdog who can't make any decision on his own and just repeats the same dumb speech again and again.    He's also mentally retarded, ugly, a manlet, can't think for himself and has an awful, bland personality. He can cook and clean sure but anyone with working arms and legs could do that if they tried.    I find manlet far worse than Bert or Eren    That's your opinion, but I disagree with it.    Because he is, manletfags are just desperate to make him rise up a little in popularity on /a/.    she is the queen of my heart    You and the rest of the retarded 13 year old fujoshits that populate 90% of the fanbase.    He is far worse. Bert and Eren at least have some conflict in their personalities despite being pawns, while manlet is just a lapdog that mindlessly follows orders no matter how bad they are. Bert and Eren think for themselves.    They already shit up the threads as is and hate on everyone who isn't the manlet because they think people only dislike him due to popularity.    I think out of all the characters who are consistently shat on here, which is pretty much everyone as is, Levi is the only one who deserves it. Especially since a good chunk of the plebs with bad taste will defend him no matter what anyway.    I'm neither a fujoshi nor am I a teenager. To be fair I don't even care about shipping. I'm not sure why you get so butthurt over a differing opinion.    I dislike his fanbase too but that doesn't mean the character is good. If Levi was a good character no one would mind his popularity.    Where do you think we are    No one is butthurt, just saying your opinion isn't unpopular.    I know I'm on 4chan but your level of butthurt over someone liking Levi is just childish. Did I shit on your favorite character or something?    Yeah he's pretty bad and this arc proved he's dumb as shit too    No it doesn't, really. The difference is ideological, that's the part Annie admires.  It's just that they have a dream or how far they're willing to go for it, though she does admire the way the "special" people stick to their guns, but the basis is quality of those dreams themselves.  In her conversation with Marlo she says he's special because goes against the society's mentality simply because of what he believes to be right even though the system itself is built on corruption, same as Eren who believes that people should go out simply because it's their world and it's their right even though everyone thinks it better not to mess with the walls and the SL are regarded as freaks.   Bertolt has probably the strongest determination out of BRA despite being underestimated, but in the end he admits himself that he doesn't have anything he values more than his own life. On a personal note I think he's not quite correct on this, I would bet he is capable of sacrificing himself for Annie or Reiner, but they're not dreams or ideals. He doesn't want to die for that, even on the off chance he was fed some bullshit about higher goals for their mission, what moves Bert are very personal things: his desire for home, and his care for RA.          Go back to Dumblr now    No one got butthurt though, your damage control proves you're the only butthurt here.     both Bert and Eren are pawns and just follow around orders  Difference is Eren believes in those orders while Bert just wants to get it over with.     I simply said I liked Levi and I got anons replying to me for no reason.    Ymir will get inside that with her BBC while you're gonna watch like an impotent cook.    How does that make someone butthurt?     implying watching your waifu getting fucked by another man with a big dick isn't hot     Clearly I'm not the one who's angry over someone liking a character I don't.    So in the end Annie admires Eren's ideals because he is selfless? Bert isn't as selfless, he puts RA above him but he seems like he doesn't care about the rest, like humanity and such. Not that he likes killing people, but if it means being happy with RA, then he's okay with it.   he admits himself that he doesn't have anything he values more than his own life  I don't know if that changed or if he never realized it, but that's not true.       I hope Isayama gives us canon beardlet soon. Beardwin was heaven sent from above      He has a better personality than the both of them.  I don't even hate manlet but that's just not true. Reiner is bro-tier and at least all Erwin's decisions are his own.     Ymir is not a man, she is a strong independent woman. Having a penis doesn't make her a man.     Ymir   man   big dick       Woah people replied to you? That's unusual, sorry about that, it will never happen again. Stop whining already, you should have expected that because almost no one likes Levi here.    A true Historiafag acknowledges that Ymir fucked her and impregnated her and is okay with that.     Eren's ideals because he is selfless?  No, it's because like she said, he's one of those "special" persons that don't go with the flow.   I don't know if that changed or if he never realized it, but that's not true.  Please read  On a personal note I think he's not quite correct on this, I would bet he is capable of sacrificing himself for Annie or Reiner, but they're not dreams or ideals. He doesn't want to die for that, even on the off chance he was fed some bullshit about higher goals for their mission, what moves Bert are very personal things: his desire for home, and his care for RA.          True, she probably has a tiny penis actually, from all the estrogen she used to take to help her transition.    Can you post that panel where she has Ymir's jizz all over her face?    This this this. Historiafags are all cuckolds with a bull fetish.    He always comments on other people's beards. Can he even grow one?     Nah.    No one gives a shit, Reiner was her first. He took her virginity. Nigmir can have sloppy seconds for all I care.    I can accept she will never love me like she loves Ymir.    I'm going to assume he has testicles so in that case the answer would be yes.    No mate no. She loves you just as much as she loves Ymir!!    You Ymirfags can't accept that YH is yet another one sided romance in a series full of one sided romance and Historia sees her as a dear friend and nothing more.    There isn't a single character in the series who wouldn't be improved with the addition of facial hair.    Reiner could barely even talk to her.    But he was malnourished so perhaps he can't and wishes he could?    I'm not a Ymirfag I'm a Historiafag. And YH is the only reasonable pairing for her because Ymir makes her happy.    And? He is an alpha male, he doesn't need to talk, he needs to  FUCK___ . He just put it inside her and gave her an instant orgasm with no talking.    I agree. Even shitren would improve slightly.     I'm not a Ymirfag I'm a Historiafag  Nice try, really subtle. Eren makes her happy too  and no EH is not a thing  and if you were a Historiafag you would understand that.     I believe this poster and everything he says.      Nice Historiafags hate Ymir maymay. But I really am one.    Who said Historiafags hate Ymir? Are you retarded?    That's not Ymir's liquid. The titan is not part of Ymir's body (since it is obviously male and we 4channers believe that gender is biological and not an identity thing).    like gordon ramsey?    Even the females?   The 104th are a bunch of 15 yr olds, they can only grow baby beards and shit.       Because that seems to be what some think here the moment you say you're a Historiafag who likes YH or Ymir.    Gordon Ramsey is an EH/hetfag? Fucking dropped his show.     Funny how Annie comes off as such a cynic but is openly into the idealists.     Umm no I said that YH is one sided, I don't care about Ymir and that means I also don't hate her. I also don't care much about Eren. I don't ship EH or YH particularly, but both Eren and Ymir make Historia happy, but at least Eren doesn't throw her off cliffs and force her to do things.    It's because you're not a Historiafag if you like YH.  Your fag status is determined by the most beta character you support.  Ymir is clearly the more beta out of the YH duo, so you are an Ymirfag.  If you liked, in example, Judenmadchen x Eren, then you are an Anniefag since she is the more beta out of the two (the one who wants his kebab dick; Eren himself has a harem to choose from).          Beardwin was great but mostly because of that smile. Not the insane one but the small one. That was the first time he looked soft.    Most Historiafags hate Ymir.    Annie a good but I'll always be loyal to MikASSa no matter how much Isayama wastes her potential.  Dem abs still the best though.      How can you love Historia but not care about Ymir? Ymir is the one who helped her stop being suicidal and I kind of doubt Historia only sees her as just a friend considering her reaction to being separated from her. As for Eren, he's important to her too but I don't see the romance in EH.    Fuck off. Hetfag scum are NOT real Historiafags.    You mean the two or so who hate literally anyone who gets close to her? They don't count as anything but bitter waifufags.    She is a cynic that wants to believe and it's breaking my heart.     Ymir helped your favorite, you MUST like her!  How many times do we have to say it for Ymirfags to understand this? Ymir doesn't appeal to me as a character, and thus I don't care about her. You should be able to understand this concept since grade school.     The threads ain't ever gonna be as cozy as back then, but sure. Unfortunately I lost my ass folder years ago ;_;     Ymir is the one who helped her stop being suicidal  Yeah, because she wasn't suicidal at all in chapter 50+. At no point was she like "Fahkeet, just kill all the humanities gibsmedat serum papa!". Nope, Ymir did everything, Ymir da man.  Ymir himself ran away from her because he knew that his future is somewhere else.      Previews of the ED and bonus tracks of the second recap movie: http://shingeki.tv/music/movie_op.p<wbr>hp</wbr>    I am afraid for her to be back now that the SL has a serum.    I'm not a Ymirfag, again. And if you devalue Ymir as a character then you're ignoring a huge part of Historia's growth as a person. Not only that but she's also the most important person to her above all else.    I never thought I'd say that but I hope she stays in her crystal a bit longer. It's safer in there ;_;    This movie won't flop now that it'll have a lot of Levi, will it.    Everyone hated Annie before and during the anime though, what are you talking about. The Annie a shit type of posts were everywhere and so was the Jew maymay.    Obvious sarcasm, but it is true that Ymir helped a great deal even after she abandoned her.    I understand that, but I still don't see why I should like a character that my favorite interacted with. By that logic all Jeanfags should like Marco even if he was a redshirt and so on. Liking a character isn't a chain reaction.    Did you even read 66? Her memory of Ymir is what caused her to rebel against Rod. It's obvious that Ymir's words to her mean a lot to her otherwise she would have went through with taking the serum and eating Eren.     what are you talking about  I don't remember much if any hate during the time of Pandaniku's reign and before, when no one had a clue she was FT.  Speaking of Pandaniku, does anyone have a fullsize of his Sasha one? With the heart eyes? That was him, right?       You just replied to a shitposter    I just don't see why you would dislike Ymir either. Even if you don't like her much then at least acknowledge Ymir's importance to Historia.    Now that MT's mentioned her chances are she'll be relevant in this arc.    It's kinda logical to appreciate the character that pushed your shingeki to become the person they are now. Individually this character may not appeal to you, but it's an undeniable fact that without Ymir Historia would have gone nowhere.     when no one had a clue she was FT.  Here's your reason.      I do acknowledge her importance to Historia, I just don't like her as a character. It's not that hard to understand and you should stop whining when someone has a different taste than you.     Those were fun days.    What exactly do you have against Ymir? Don't tell me you're one of those who thinks she's "abusive".    I'm not saying that you should like her, it's just that a lot of Historiafags seem to devaluate Ymir's importance to Historia and to me it just comes across as being ignorant on purpose. It's a weird concept to me that Ymirfags or Historiafags would look down on the other character.    I have nothing against her, I have a lot against your whining though. Not liking a character doesn't mean I hate her.    Let me do it again then.    Yes it does. It's literally a synonym. Hate = not like.     Nah I like Ymir a lot but I can intellectually acknowledge the impact a character I dislike has on a character I like without having to appreciate them. Like how I acknowledge that boring as fuck Marco had a impact on Jean.  It's a fucking simple concept and not hard to understand.        Uh, no, not really. Again, stop being so defensive. I don't like her but I don't hate her either, that means I'm indifferent.     Well I guess as long as you appreciate her for what she's done. I just don't get the other Historiafags who hate on her, they seem to be retarded.    No, it simply indicates a lack of like. Indifference can play into it.  Don't be an idiot.      For yet another time, your whining is annoying. It's a different opinion and you should learn to accept it.   I just created my own Ymir figurine  (on the toilet) , anyone wanna see it?     moar MikASSa plz?      I do understand that much. For example I don't have much of an opinion on Historia but I do acknowledge that she's important to Ymir. To be fair comparing it to Jean and Marco's situation is weird, Marco barely had any relevance in the manga and his interactions with Jean were too little to really form an opinion on him and his relationship with Jean.    You're replying to a reverse shitposter.     Keep you filthy wanking elsewhere, neckbeards.     No, he isn't. You are so fucking autistic that you can't even tell your posts apart from mine, Ymirbro.    There's no such thing as reverse shitposting, there's only shitposting.    I wonder how much her dad plays into it. She said he "was" "high on a pipe dream of an ideal" which means either he broke down/changed his mind or he died.  Given his apologies, he probably broke down. Her being bent on keeping their promise means he still means a lot to her. But does she feel like he let her down? Is she looking for someone who won't back down on their dreams?  Will we ever get more Annie backstory? ;_;        How am I a reverse shitposter?   When's that new game coming out?   This this this. Neckbeards and hetshitters go away.  Now let's post some delicious Bert x Reiner. :-^)      I'm replying to a Ymirfag that claims to be a Historiafag. That's some form of reverse shitposting but that person believes his claims.    I lost my collection.    With all the bloom effects and shit, it looks like an average picture of a cosplayer.    Just stop anon, it's embarrassing.    Eren and Armin then.     being in this much denial   I'm probably the biggest Historiafag here. Being okay with Ymir doesn't make me a reverse shitposter.     Sure why not.    Sure.    Bert is like Makoto-lite for SnKfags huh?    Why is Reiner an ANT?    Noice.    I'm hoping she gets a redemption arc, seeing as her crimes are far less than BR's.    That is a bee.    No. He has nothing in common with Makoto. Makoto is a cute tomboy Idolmaster, Bert is not cute or a tomboy.     her crimes are far less than BR's  Seriously? Annie is responsible for the same amounts of deaths as BR, since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well.     That's a bee, not an ant.    Fuck I hope not. I love Annie but redemption arc is way too cheesy for BRA and she's not looking for redemption anyway.    It's not a fucking bee. I studied biology for 8 years and I can tell a bee and ants apart. It's an ANT ANT ANT.    The fags have arrived. Abandon thread.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-qL<wbr>BEI0SFI8</wbr>  [ ]    What's so unbelievable about a Historiafag who likes Ymir? You're probably just projecting.     kiss  Por Que?       Nothing is unbelievable, just the whole  hey guys Ymir is best shingeki, I'm a Historiafag btw and why don't you guys like Ymir?      The belief that Ymirfags and Historiafags must always be at odds because of a few autists.    Just wait for Season 2, all the porn will be delicious.     &gt;&gt;hey guys Ymir is best shingeki, I'm a Historiafag btw and why don't you guys like Ymir?  You lack reading comprehension      since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well  Pure speculation.   She's only ever been shown fighting enemy soldiers. She never kicked down walls and caused civilian deaths. She's actually been shown having regret when civilians have died (when Eren punched her onto that church she seemed shocked by the people she crushed).       I never said Ymir is best shingeki, she isn't even one of my favorites. But I am okay with her and can acknowledge her importance to Historia.    I've reached my limit anon. Can someone please help us post more delicious shingeki girl ass ;_;    Te voy a encontrar en la vida real. Voy a descomprimir mi pene y lo puso en su boca y lo frota en el interior hay hasta materia blanca sale y te trague, maldito coño. MUJERES EN VIDEOJUEGOS NO MÁS    She was still in cahoots with BR and when discovered she was completely unrepentant and antagonistic. She doesn't want to work with the SL anon, face it. Embrace Annie as she is.     Pure speculation.  Sure, Armin's speculation and nothing so far proves the opposite. Armin is always right by the way, we know that well.     My ass is much more delicious than her flat ass.    Soon.     her importance to Historia.  Historia has now a good relationship with Eren. She doesn't need Ymir anymore, kek     So if we agree, I see no reason for all your whining, I see her the same way as you claim you do.    Wow thanks for ruining makoto for me you CUNT    When I said redemption I didn't mean working with the Survey Corps, I just meant her sort of going her own way and no longer trying to kill humanity.     kek   Hetfags, everyone.      Will the following chapters and Season 3 make them rise in popularity? Their role might be even bigger than the one they had in chase arc and Utgard.    At first I though that was a Mikaso.    Historia can have more than one friend you know.    I'm kind of lazy but eh, why not.    I think we can both agree that Ymir is as important to Historia as I am important to you.    Oh you dick    I hope so,    Oh but you're very important to me anon. Will you marry me?    Gringo de mierda, no sabes escribir español. Vuelve a tu país de mierda.       Thanks man.   I see. Annie as a free agent could be interestinf but I wouldn't call that redemption, to be redeemed she has to compensate for what she's done, and to do that she has to do something real big for the SL. But that's just semantics.          I just leave it here     back muscles  Yes.        "I won't forgive her"   proceeds to defend her against Connie      I fucking love Hysteria. Araki and her VA better not fuck this up.    Do you have any reading comprehension? She even defended her afters.      This and her screaming during Utgard.    Are you retarded?      You know the only this this proves is how much Historia cares for Ymir. And she's being rather possessive, too.    If anything that page just proves how much Ymir meant to Historia you fag.    I'm worried none of the extra pages will make S2    *afterwards     tfw their canon underwear looks nothing like this       The extra pages are part of chapters 50 and 51 and they were included in the official volume release.    I'm worried they'll cut out Eren's interaction with anyone who isn't Mikasa. I'm still annoyed they didn't include Annie offering to train him in S1.    They're important scenes and too short to make OVAs from.   Then again the Annie and Eren bonding scenes were important too.        I hope the make an OVA of it.      I want to see her go Hysteria as the queen.      In last chapter she talked with Eren about BR    And didn't say anything about Ymir  Yes, she is still really important to Historia, I see       tfw looking forward to fapping over shota-looking Armin on a bed   tfw Araki removes it for the sake of shipping faggotry  Fuck everything        How can they make an OVA of a few pages. I can see them making another OVA of the joke pages though.    She asked about BR because she knows Eren wanted to kill BR. Why would she even mention Ymir.    Why would she bring up Ymir when talking about if Eren wants to kill BR?    Because Eren is only angry at BR, not Ymir.    I don't.  Unless Zackly goes wild first, causing her to go Hysteria on him and removing him from his post.     Annie a shit.   What would she be Hysterical over? the only thing I can think off is when Eren finally dies at the end of the series so she has to raise their daughter alone      Combine them. Or add filler about BRY hanging out/traveling.      crystallized shit    I think I'm out.    I'm sorry you feel that way.    Nope, one more.    H-Hot    That was a valiant effort, anon, thanks.

Got me into the band that collaborated on it, Shinsei Kamattechan. They are really weird.      This. Everyone always cites the OP, but I honestly didn't find it to be that impressive. ED is amazing.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5Ef<wbr>0XEttdO4</wbr>  [ ]  Literally the best Gintama opening     That's because she's popular for Nitro+ VNs/anime OPs. If she was a regular anime singer she'd be ChouCho/MayN tier, pretty good but not so special.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GV1<wbr>p8511PhI</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zPe<wbr>NlsAHbbs</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xes<wbr>GxZNonWA</wbr>  [ ]   Even if the series went to shit, they had pretty catchy openings              Dudes, Zeta Gundam's best opening was when the English DVD release couldn't get the rights to the original songs.

Also:   Glad that BONES didn´t make S2 even Eureka 7 went to shit          Best OP/ED combo of the season I thought. Though there were a lot of good OPs and EDs this season. Houkago no Pleiades was probably the runner up for best combo OP and ED together, but I think Punchline comes otu on top.     Have you heard the Shokugeki ED, it's incredible.    das it mane     tfw you will never have a group of aidoru's asking you, "NANDE NANDE NANDE NANDE NANDE DA?!"     cant go wrong with bleach   gatchamaaaaaaaan    Houkago no Pleiades was probably the runner up for best combo OP and ED together  How? I love the show but the OP is so boring      I don't know, I like it. The visuals especially.

If you're calling me dumb because I said it's not talked about, and you're about to use the &gt;newfag or "it was talked about plenty when it aired" argument, then you're a fucking retard who's probably new as shit and should shut the fuck up. It gets little to no discussion on /a/. Period. I was in almost every single SxS thread, what little amount there were, even - when it was airing, so I'm unsure of what the fuck you're even talking about, you seem like the bigger retard here for simply calling me dumb and not offering a legitimate reason as to why.      awesomeness.

Its 2spooky4me    illustrations showing dark and horrifying setting   actual series is just as metal   wonder if Madhouse will put this series off.      Hopefully some tidbits make their way to West from the next weekend's pre-screening event. Though I doubt we will get another PV since it airs on 7th for real, iirc.   Where were you when Demiurge discovered that Albedo had steel abs?  Well, it'll be a fresh breath of air after all the cutesy trash they air now a days.   I'd rather see her tail or Papa Bones' legs.   I read the web novel and dropped it a few chapters in. It's another self insert RPG manga where the MC gets literally everything handed to him because he's the MC. Pretty fucking bad.  Manga chapter 7 when?   But this series still has lots of pandering and wish fullfilment. Its just presented in a different, more digestible wraping. Doesnt mean it doenst have pandering and wish fullfilment like every other LN under the moon.      Overrated anime of the season alongside Gangsta.  I'll be watching Skeletor's battles but besides that I don't give a shit.     Anime character design problems:  Ainz's spaulders. Albedo doesn't have enough frills. Shalltear's lopsided dress. Aura's lack of whip. Mare's lack of silver necklace. Demiurge's boney face. Cocytus's icebergs. Sebastian's chest and hands.            Gangsta is overrated?  Always seemed like a pretty niche thing only 5 people on /a/ were interested in, me included. Same deal here, only theres a bigger handful of people.      If anything, God Eater will be overrated since the normies are all fangasming over 'MUH UFOTABLE'    Gangsta is pretty hyped outside of /a/. Expect it to be popular.  Also, why is are Overlord sprites never updated on time? Literally takes 2-3 days after reaching 200 new followers or 50 retweets.      Weird, I would expect it to not be popular with all the prostitution and drugs themes in it, but I guess those things atract quite the audience.  People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon. Wonder how censored it will be. And I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.        normies  Normalfags, they are called normalfags Jesus Christ.     If anything, I know /a/ will hate it because of the fujoshit boogieman and the fact that the main girl is a literal prostitute.     People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon.  People is stupid, no big surprise here.   I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.  Why would you care what this "people" think.        fujoshit boogieman? You talking about the supersoldier lesbian couple? Cause if anything that will cause a bigger /v/tard-tier uproar, along with katana brainwashed twin sister.  If anything the main girl being a literal prostitute would be refreshing for /a/, but it could go either way since she has a "oh what a useless female" moments in the begining. I rather quite like her character and seeig her develop.   Inevitably whatever this "people" do will get reported here so I do care. I further care because like it or not we are part of this "people".          From what I've seen, the two new shows being hyped are Gangsta and God Eater.  Gangsta is drawing attention precisely because of violence and drugs. God Eater because of Ufotable.  Going by Twitter, they're leading in follows with Gangsta at 13.5K and God Eater at 24.6K.         God Eater is the usual post apocalyptic teens with weapons anime. ANY show with those things are bound to be popular. Post apocalyptic anything is popular even harems.   I'm sure they're expecting it to be Black Lagoon. You also underestimate how edgy normals can be about their anime. I always thought /a/ would be the cesspool of internet anime. Oh no, there's much worse going on out there.       I predict Gangsta will get a psycho-pass-like following, at least at the begining. If they manage to not fuck up the anime it could even become the new Black Lagoon for some people. Though tbh Im still scratching my head at how they are gonna pace things since it doesnt feel like the first arc is even done yet in the manga. Probly anime original ending since theres not enough material for a season 2 or a story arc for a season 1.      WHEN I SAY GANGSTA YOU SAY NIGGA  GANGSTA       Stop.     MC didnt choose to play a lesbian succubus   so much wasted potential      And it's bit sad only some of those can be attributed to the need to simplify so-bin's art so it's actually doable for animators/budget.    /a/ is one of the few places on the english-speaking internet anyone can enter and have a proper discussion about anime without any stupid filters or rules, provided you go to the right thread at the right time. Like most things on 4chan it is a pile of shit-stained straw with the ocasional diamond in it that makes it worth it. Yes, there are much, much worse places out there. Good god there are. May you never have to step foot in them.     More like MC didn't choose the roleplay lesbian succubus dorm master and all the servants were girls of varying ages.  Would have been best world conquest ever.      I honestly wish there was a series about some otaku that got sucked into an rpg world and it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  The whole LN concept where this "normal" guy uses his "gaming smarts" to just completely bowl over some game world is just retarded. What's the point? What's the great story here? Them crushing the competition like it's nothing and sucking the tension out of every scene? What vacuous waste of animation money he's gonna impregnate? To see the same tropes get subverted in the same way ad nauseum?  Come on.         If those were underdesigned so that they can be animated properly then I expect decent animation. So far the trailer does not impress on that regard.     I have an argument against that.  When I was watching Log Horizon back then S1 had this animation friendly style. Everything was seamless even when the scenes got QUALITY. Then S2 boasted about how they were going to be true to the light novel art. It didn't translate very well to the silver screen.  It's not a bit sad when you think about it.           Not that anon but I think the fujoshit boogieman he was referring to was this kind of thought process  oh there are two male characters   must BE FUCKING FUJOSHIT TIME TO SPAM THREADS ABOUT IT GUCBSNCJDBF  That kind of nonsense although it will definitely be a free pass for fujoshit works          May you never have to step foot in them.  I regret to admit I participated in some of them in the past. But I've learned my lesson. Even after becoming somewhat of a normalfag this is the only place I'll discuss anime.    it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  I know of two series like that, people who are very proud of their depravity. One is Highschool DxD and the other is a manga I forgot the title, but is about this neet named Niito who became a monster hunter when his mom died and he couldn't mooch off of her anymore.            using DEEN for a fair comparison     Theres probably plenty of LNs in which the MC stays worthless but those dont sell to the auduence that is looking for LNs for escapism. They probably gte filed under NTR-like fetishims. Youre looking at an industry that has grown fat from pandering and pandering sells and what sells gets animated so pandering gets animated. Theres probably some really fucking good material out there but you would have to find it first.   We are all a sum of our experiences so theres nothing to regret dude. All that matters is what you take home with you.          Hey if you've got other examples I'm all ears. I'm just saying, being true to the source art doesn't always translate to the big screen well.    Oh that shit.  Everything with more than one non-MC male character gets called fujoshit these days, even Shokugeki no Souma gets called that. Its like nerds are insecure that if their self-insert isnt the only noticeable cock in the neighborhood it will ruin the experience for them or something.      As long as they keep all the macabre humor and humanity is weak and the Nazarick attitude, I'll just shrug it off.  Since those are the major components to the actual tone of the series and the cast being what they're in novels.      The Gangsta manga is shit, dropped it quickly.    True but it could also be a mockup and the scene itself doesn't have that much motion either way. We'll see how bad it is when Ainz plays around in the Arena and the Lemegeton prior to that.    They may need to tone down/cut some aspects of the story to fit the censors/budget/time/pacing/etc. of the show.  Like the twins fighting the fire elemental at the start shit like that can be cut out and replaced with far more budget-firendly things. This is reasonable. I just hope we dont get too many "they changed/cut this tiny thing so it sucks" threads/atittudes.   Heres your reply.           It's strictly in the same genre as black lagoon, jormungand, noir etc  so yeah I'm fine with some gangsta loving      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106072  Shits pretty common everywhere on the internet, its part of human culture. Its just a matter of dealing with it, or not and moving on.  Even if you point out the double standard most people will wave it off with some lame justification. Better to just shrug, laugh and leave it, though there is a time and place for everything.      Who the hell is writing these summaries for the anime previews?  Most of these literally begin with "The story revolves around", "The manga follows", The story takes place in", "A romantic comedy set in", etc.   Do they not have any creativity?       They are souless anime watchers of course they have had every ounce of creativity sucked dry from them by all the moeblobs and pandering. Just look at what it did to Kentaro Miura the poor bastard.     There probably are plenty, they just didn't sell and no translator has any interest in them.    Another SAO ripoff with MC just another reskin gary stu that gets everything handed to him. Just beceause he looks like a skeleton doesnt mean shit everything is copy pasted from SAO with extra editing to look appealing for the edgy viewers that likes to masturbate to this garbage.    Please, this is clearly a Danmachi ripoff with the MC getting everything handed to him, and everything in the video game is on his boner.    Nah, this is Log Horizon ripoff.    Nah this is a Matrix ripoff      It's clearly a rip-off of Boku no Hack    I'll be going in for Manglobe and maybe they can deliver something good after their previous oddities.    450k views in 2 days. Holy shit      Mar 22  Not Jun 22     This is a Sharknado spinoff.    It's Madoka ripoff.    It's the 'LN Novel Superlong Title For The Sake Of Lazy Synopsis On The Spine/Front Equivalent For Lazy Reader's Allusion To Something He Might Have Liked In Past'.    I freaking wish.    For some reason I think that Overlord might have more international following than moonland alone. The novel has been licensed officially in ch and kr already.   Can't wait to hear Shalltear's geisha voice.  I only hope that Madhouse won't fuck this up too much.    Doubting madhouse     I'm kind of hyped.     Weird, I would expect it to not be popular with all the prostitution and drugs themes in it, but I guess those things atract quite the audience.   More and more normies are starting to get into anime because it's the new hip, cool thing to do. And they only watch the BRUTAL, METAL, DUDEBRO, METAL, HARDCORE, DARK, EDGY, GRIM, BRUTAL, BRUTAL, BRUTAL, DARKASFUCK, GRIM, EDGY, BRUTAL anime such as ATTACK ON TITAN HOLY FUCK IT'S SO FUCKING BRUTAL AND DARK THIS IS JUST LIKE MY WESTERN TV SHOWS ONLY ALOT DARKER IT'S SO FUCKING BRUTAL AND DARK SO GOOOD!      The director and script writer don't really get my hope up but I'll trust the chief animation director, even if he chose to go and do the anime char designs the way we saw on the website.  I wonder where he picked up that Sebastian is old dragon Chris Redfield, with those arms and upper torso of his. Maybe from his class/skill traits of being unarmed, inner/outer whatever energies voodoo.      After what Madhouse and Aniplex script writers did with Onii-sama, I'll be happy enough to see all the despair and magic/skills animated.  And guess who is doing script for Papa Bones? An Aniplex junior that was on the team for Onii-sama.      I still love how 90% of the comments are in english. It's like the japs don't even care.    Ever seen this?     An Aniplex junior that was on the team for Onii-sama  It's all over. Might as well watch Gangsta.     Gantz would be this for Shooters if they just added it was a game they played.     I honestly wish there was a series about some otaku that got sucked into an rpg world and it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.   Why the hell do you want a MC like that? I agree that overpowered garystue MCs are boring but watching a loser beta protag is worse, watching them just make you rage and facepalm. Instead why not have a MC that start weak and beta but have a decent character developement with up and down in his live.       Is there any Heroes become Demon King stories?   CASUAL: The Series Not an expert, not a scrub. He played the game now and then on his days off. Even learned a few protips from his gamer obsessive brother he keeps recalling. The Brother flashbacks helping him from total destruction, but nothing game breaking. His only benefit are the stats from the game transfered over to his new self, and he upped his Luck skill without knowing what that meant. So while he looks foolish (Charisma was not so blessed) he still gets amazing item drops and escapes. Even if he doesn't know what he gets.  Then discovering there is an OP antagonist in a far off country, slowly making his presence known. His Brother, also was sent to this land.       SAO clone   You can only hope the chief animation director (for his veteran status) took the helm for the series with the VA's that have actually been on the novel work prior to Madhouse &amp; rest.    I suspect Tsuyokute New Saga may become such story.     dual wielding black swordsman!  Nah, the cape is red, that's important.     Danke  Fallen Heroes are my favorite.     New volume spoiler when   So when are we getting next chapter of Lizard Romance? TLers are being slow this month.    this saturday. presumably.   I fucking love it and I am excited for the anime, a shame they will ruin it somehow. In other news, I am hoping for more translations this weekend.  Pretty obvious, isn't it? Was never a fan of time traveling shenanigans but I might put up with it      I finished Rebellion. ...So Madoka Thread. Reaction Images or general disscusion.  Will Ayanero deliver a new one in this comiket? His doujin is of course lewd but fun to read.   Nagisa arose that high? That's why you should've watched Rebellion before calling her a shit. A SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!    Homura is the best to be honest.     getting asshurt cause I said lol   accusing me on going to Tumblr    linking me to shit that I don't give a fuck about.   I'm not even going to bother with you anymore. You're being a jackass at this point and I'm just going to ignore this thread. No one cares that you are triggered by anyone who ships a pairing that isn't canon. None of the ships are canon, so who cares? You can't tell anymore what to ship. And by the way, you're not a mod, so fuck off.        tfw no Kyouko to eat a burger together with. </blockquote>]
