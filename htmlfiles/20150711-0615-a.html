Also Yugo looks unimpressed</br>  <br>Dude's thinking in his mind terms of: "Yep, he doesn't stand a chance better not tell her that."</br>  <br>Yeah she's shedding tears that Yuya okay and Yugo's impression's likely: "So I guy that looks just like me facing my all time hero, let's see how this plays out."</br>  <br>I want to lick Yuzu's tears.</br>  Is Yugo's Clear Wing the only one who can stand up to Jacks Scar-right?    <br>Haha Yugo is mad because Yuya fights Jack and he's been waiting 14 years to do it himself</br>  <br>Nah it will probably be a new Pendulum Synchro Yuya will develop after his duel with Yugo</br>  <br> Opp is not bennis <br><br><br>Those guys</br></br></br></br>  Literally JoJo Pt.3 Stardust Crusaders reference.  <br>Or the DRAGONS are at it again.</br>  <br>If Yugo can be in the stands without being ported away it a Yuya/Yugo duel seems possible in the Friendship Cup.</br>  <br>Yuzu won't be around to teleport them to begin with.</br>  <br>What?

Why would you do that?</br>  <br>So it took 22 episodes for them to see each other again, by far they beat the yugioh record</br>  <br>Why is Marik so fucking hot? <br>Shit's no fair.</br></br>  <br>What monster is in the chrome blue?</br>  <br> Security takes Yuzu away for absolutely no reason, making Bracelet-kun useless <br><br>The writers are gettiing smarter by the day</br></br></br>  <br>The Psychic or Ohajikid?</br>  <br>Probably a new Warrior monster</br>  <br>Are the rest of the bracelets useless?

I'm looking forward to the MISUNDERSTANDINGS that Serena's bracelet will cause.</br></br>  <br>I don't think so.</br>  <br>He does look pretty jealous. Like he's eyeing Yuya as a rival.<br><br>Come to think of it, Yugo doesn't seem to have a Kaiba to be his rival. Yuri doesn't either, and he was also pretty touchy about other versions of him existing.</br></br></br>  <br>Did Yuto have a rival??</br>    <br>Damn you</br>  <br><br>Oh shit I'm sorry, wrong pic.

All the characters post here on their free time because they heard this is where the cool kids hang.</br>  Sorry if this has already been asked, but, is there any chance Ruri is, either the ninja, or Sora?  <br> Ruri is actually Ninjabro </br>  <br>How did you ever know?</br>  <br>Ruri is actually Dennis, it's why Shun was confused and asked if Dennis was really from Standard.</br>  <br>But anon, the original YGO is more like Part 4 up to Duelist Kingdom, Part 3 after Duelist Kingdom.</br>  <br>Reiji told me.</br>  <br>That can't be right, When a female character plays a male one, you can tell. See: Blair. Some traits can be seen. I dont see any of these of Dennis, and I can seriously see him as a Fusion-Born.</br>  How hard will Reiji orgasm when he sees Pendulum Synchro  <br>That's what you think. Remember all those Ruri is actually just a flat chested girl? Dennis. Remember all those Ruri is braindwashed? Fusion. Remember all that Heartland is to make people smile and for entertainment? Dennis. <br><br>Dennis is Ruri.</br></br></br>  Raidraptor – Skull Eagle<br>Dark Winged-Beast / Effect<br>LV3 1000/500<br>You can only use the (1) effect of Raidraptor – Sky Eagle once per turn.<br>(1) If you activate the effect of an Xyz monster by detatching this card as an Xyz material: Banish this card from your Graveyard, then target 1 “Raidraptor” card in your Graveyard; Add that target to your hand.<br>(2) An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using this card as Xyz Material gains this effect:<br>● When it is Xyz Summoned: it gains 300 ATK.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Okay, but what is Devil Eagle?</br>  <br>So, this is the one that makes the new RR.<br>It's not good.</br></br>  <br>2 Level 3 "Raidraptor" monsters<br>You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card, then target 1 face-up Special Summoned monster your opponent controls; inflict damage to your opponent equal to its original ATK. You can only use this effect of "Raidraptor - Devil Eagle" once per turn.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty damn strong, considering it lays on 2000 dmg a turn on average. I guess it has to be, since it's an odd R3 in an R4 deck.</br>  Has anybody here ever made up fake cards? Any you wished were real?  <br>It actually is pretty good considering you can constantly recycle Impale and Fuzzy on top of the new Rank 3 RR Xyz.</br>  <br>We need a level 3 RR that can at least special summon itself or another level 3 RR for this to be usable right now.<br><br>Raidraptor - Call getting printed would be nice too.</br></br></br>  Imdb:<br> Yugioh DM: 66% <br> Yugioh GX: 65% <br> Yugioh 5ds: 68% <br> Yugioh ZeXal: 55% <br> Yugioh ZeXal II: 68% <br> Yugioh Arc V: 78% <br>All is as it should be.<br><br> Yugioh   The Abridged Series : 87%<br>The fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so fucking based</br>  <br>It's getting a second Rank 3, and they're mostly used for detaching Xyz material quick to do damage (with Skull Eagle) on top of Rank Ups. <br><br>It might not be the best in an actual situation, but I can assure you it's not entirely useless. Not like Singing Lanius at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Abridged was pretty decent honestly. It at least led to Black Judai, which is the best part about any of it. Only problem with Abridged is it turned into meme city thanks to the fans.</br>  <br>I fucking love you, please have my babies Yuya.</br>  <br>Singing is not that bad at 1. Easily searchable and you can use it if you need that extra material for Ptolemaios.</br>  <br>Eh, I only do pure decks because capital cardgame autism.</br>  This, this, this, is so horrible. This is way too lewd.<br>I don't think I've ever wanted to mount and fuck someone so badly.</br>  <br> DM above GX <br> Zexal II tied with fucking 5ds <br> Arc V reigns supreme <br>Wow, Imdb is actually accurate for once.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Are you turned on by girls tired out from hours of ultra-crude fist fights with each other?</br>  <br> not playing Hope Raptors <br><br>It's like you don't want to stop your opponent from playing the game.</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer decks that only operate under what their own archetype can produce. Forget all those stupid staple cards, I just find it's more fair when two decks go at it with only the support they've been given.<br>But if you have fun by doing un-fun things, then go for it.</br></br>  <br> fun being objective <br>lol no</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah this. If I wanted to be a Hope and Infinity shitter I'd just play Clownblade and not RR</br></br>  <br>Restricting your opponents options to surrender is not what anybody would define as fun.</br>  <br> not playing clownblade raptors </br>  <br><br>I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH YUYA</br></br>  <br>A shame, nobody uses Infinity in Cyber decks, as it was intended. A mono-archetype deck option would be interesting.</br>  <br> being competitive is not fun <br>lol</br></br>  <br> nobody uses Infinity in Cyber decks <br><br>Are you kidding me? I've seen people bring out 3 Infinity with Cydra decks.</br></br></br>  <br>Competitive and uncompetitive are different things you realise. I bet you were that kid that hid the football up his shirt.</br>  <br>Reason nobody uses Infinity in Cyber decks is because nobody uses Cyber decks. At least they would, if Infinity could only be summoned by using Cyber Dragons, and not literally any deck that can produce some Level 4's.</br>  <br>the fuck does that even mean<br>and yes while I will often play shit like the ds game to get away from the current meta, I find it much more fulfilling to actually make a deck that can see local or tourney play. Cause I like tourneys and locals. <br><br>And in the original post this wasn't about competitive vs casual it was about using lockdown and stun vs powerplaying each other with atk and shit. And I find both fun, one is just much more viable and thus fun cause it wins you the game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen people lean more towards a fusion based deck for Cydras</br>  <br>thats cause the new fusion is insane stronk.<br>but I think it would be fun if we got a defusion based cydra card to support both fusions and xyz's by going from one into the other and back.</br></br>  <br> I equally use bullshit and proper tactics because fun <br> I just prefer the bullshit because ensuring I win is more fun </br></br>  <br>look man don't get me wrong.<br>nothing is cooler then winning with my galaxy/blue eyes hybrid deck. but its not as fun as having a well build consistent deck that is viable for me to play irl at locals.</br></br>  <br>This is what I'm running with right now, I need to fix a few things in it, but otherwise it does it's job more than adequately enough. As for Hope, I can't justify actually using it, the card is too broken, and I used to use Spellbooks/Dragon Rules/TeleDAD to fuck around with.</br>  <br>Fair enough, but still, I can't respect a playstyle that no matter how effective, consists of<br> You can't summon any monsters <br> You can't play any spells <br> You can't activate any traps <br> Anything you do manage to do is immediately removed and/or negated <br> "Good game" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody uses Cyber Dragon decks anymore (sad one of my favorites) thanks to Nutellas, which can get Infinity out far more easily and get more shit out and be more consistent.</br>  <br>I'd shout stuff like REMOVE FUSION and REMOVE BLACKWINGS, but so long as you keep Rise Falcon and its subordinates in there you're already far better than anyone on /dng/.</br>  <br>generally, I will never fully lockdown. <br>I don't run vanity, I side it for when some asshole runs Nekroz or BA the worst stunlock I will do is vortex and infinity at the same time.<br><br>hell my magicians passively deny spells and traps in the battle phase so that kinda locks out a bunch of cards in its own way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Girls bare-knuckle punching each other is my best kept secret fetish </br>  <br>I've been meaning to get Blackwing out honestly, I rarely draw it and it barely helps the majority of the time. The fusion I don't even run anymore honestly, I think I switched out out consistently for 106 from the side deck. To be honest, I'm not even sure why that Fusion is still in there.</br>   That's a mighty fine R4 engine you have there <br> It'd be a shame if something... got mischievous with it </br>  <br>Yeah it'd be a real shame if every deck didn't have some way to negate traps, spells, special summons, draws, etc. while still being able to search through half their deck for the perfect hand on turn 0 just to be able to deal with anything afterwards for the rest of the game.</br>  <br>Yes, such a utopic world would be nice.</br>  <br>so is this like xyz encore but worse?</br>  <br>No silly, this is a Trap.</br>  <br>It can fuck with any decks that rely on monsters with specific levels, not just ones that use XYZ/have an XYZ monster on the field.</br>  <br> Singing  <br> Useless <br><br>This is news to me. I really like singing. My first turns are usually something like Vanishing &gt; Tribute &gt; Force Stryx &gt; Fuzzy &gt; Singing &gt; Force Stryx <br><br>It's been treating me well at 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only way Yugi/Kaiba can win is through plot armor</br>  <br>The "warrior" looks a lot like Viser Des. I hope it's related to it.</br>  <br>That's really the only use for it is searching it out with Strix. Mostly the problem is that it doesn't have any outstanding effect when it's summoned compared to the rest of the cards so it's poor support outside of being for Strix and overlaying it into something else, which isn't always going to work unless you have absolutely have a Fuzzy and sometimes it's just better to go ahead and use Fuzzy if you are lacking on Van, Trib, or Imp. It's just extending plays for longer than need be I find. <br><br>It's not entirely useless, just the most useless of the RR cards, except maybe Strix, since it's attack gain for RRs on the field is pathetic I feel, but at least Strix can Rank Up with ease.</br></br></br>  <br>The most useless RR is Readiness. Literally a shitty substitute for Mirror Force.</br>  <br>Take those trips and shove them up your ass /dng/.</br>  <br>Readiness isn't useless it's just bad to run them at 3, 2 at max.</br>  <br>oh yeah, this super fucks synchro decks too. That's pretty good, and it helps monarchs.</br>  <br>Also it can be used twice, and works even if it's MST'd. <br>Might have to try if with a deck that doesn't rely on specific leveled monsters, like Igknights or even... oh shit, Qliphorts.</br></br>  <br>inb4 Qli's rule again</br>  <br> Literally a shitty substitute for Mirror Force. <br><br>In no way are they similar or have the same use.</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't understand the rule of what MST works and doesn't work against honestly.</br>  <br>MST destroys, but doesn't negate.<br>That trap however can be activated from the Graveyard, so it doesn't matter if it's destroyed beforehand.</br></br>  <br>I made a RR deck to embrace the Revolution but I just can't win with it. Any strategies I need to know ?</br>  <br>Have a sister, and have her get kidnapped. <br>You will OTK every motherfucker that gets in your way.</br></br>  <br> can't win with a R4 deck <br><br>Other than getting better at the game in general and looking up plays on youtube, I don't know what to tell you.</br></br></br>  <br>Combos are hard. Back in my day you were winning if you had a strong monster on the field, not five.</br>  the field of study in the place where I am not a problem with this one of my life and I have nobody is the best way for me to be the same time it's a little bit of a shit  <br>So you're an old player getting back into the game? You could try playing a Gadget deck to familiarize yourself with card advantage and using Xyz monsters efficiently, there are builds over at /dng/ that you can copy and playtest.</br>  It's perfect ly shitty   <br>Heh.</br>  <br>Depends on exactly what RR deck you're running. Some rely a lot of Rank 4 Xyzs and stuff like Ptolemy. Others rely on similar to how it works in the show, with Vanishing/Fuzzy-&gt;Stix-&gt;Rank Up-Blaze-Rank Up-etc. <br><br>It just really depends, RR is a swarm heavy deck whether you're doing it to get shit like Castel or Hope out quickly or using it to get your RR Xyzs or whatever out. If anything use it against the AI or have the AI use it on YGOPRO, you'll figure it out if you work with it similar to the anime with added Xyzs, and the AI does know how to use the deck sometimes, so when it does you can figure it out from what it's doing.</br></br></br>    <br>I'd be fine if there was a Ruri who was built like Fumina</br>  <br>The Ygopro AI eats cocks unless it's told how to use a deck. It can't figure out combos for decks it doesn't know.<br><br><br>These are actually pretty good. Much more realistically written than most custom cards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad, they're all huge and crude and brutal.</br>  <br>I have the following theory:<br><br> Ruri will turn out to have a personality similar to Sora (pre-reveal). <br><br> Serena will be revealed to be Sora's big sis. <br><br> Then Serena and Shun are paired and so are Sora and Ruri. <br><br> And then Shun and Sora will be brothers-in-law. <br><br> Big happy family accomplished. <br><br>I know it's nonsense but I really love to see a scenario like this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I find it's hit or miss really. I will agree for the most part it's shit for decks it has no idea on. But I've found that sometimes, as rare as it is, it can pull out some decent combos with RRs and to a lesser degree IgKnights.<br><br>Well if the Cool Kids are Try Fighters, then that makes Ruri Sekai's sister, which means Ruri is the exact opposite of what we all believe, not DFC at all.</br></br></br>  <br> Serena and Sora are related <br> Japan loves drawing Serena as a sweet loving spoiled princess <br><br>Oh boy...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun would legitimately and actually rip his throat out before that can happen.</br>   Yuya will tell Yuzu to smile before she has to kill him   <br>More legimate reason for Sora to try to score with Ruri.</br>  <br>One time I had the AI use a Jurrac deck to see if it could make them work, but it just kept setting monsters over and over as usual. Then it suddenly activated Rekindling and suddenly steamrolled me with two copies of the L7 Synchro.</br>  <br> Yu  sho  will tell Yuzu to smile before he kills her</br>  <br>Some people see Yugo as the Kaito to his Shark or whatever.</br>  <br>Speaking of yusho, where the fuck is he? Is he ever gonna appear?</br>  <br> The ponytails <br><br>  The kinda similar colors of Serena's bangs compared to Sora's entire hair <br><br> The Dennis' DEEPEST LORE.dek with the Serena card and the Sora card revealed to be FIRE. <br><br> The sweet tooth <br><br>Seriously, I would be more surprised if they weren't siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll appear to shill Pendulum Magicians, but since they're topping in the OCG meta he doesn't need to appear as soon as Kamishiro thought.</br>  <br>I think Yuya has at least eight people he could consider his rival.</br>  <br>Well Serena was one of the few people Sora didn't seem to show upright complete animosity towards, granted it could be just because she was from Fusion, but it does seem odd for him to have taught Yuzu fusion and even the little Fusion Dimension chuuni hand clap.</br>  <br>I only see Sawatari, Reiji, and Yuri honestly speaking. But I'm open to hearing who else you have in mind.</br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br> Sawatari <br> Reiji <br> Yuri <br> Gon <br> Sora <br> Yusho </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot one detail:<br><br> same eye colors <br><br>Though I'm waiting to see if my theory is complete bullshit.<br><br>Fom the show, not from some random fag's comment -not talking about you-.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither of them even recognized each the other.</br>  <br>I couldn't see Gon.<br>I can maybe sort of see Sora, but I still don't really agree.</br></br>  <br>I recall Sora personally requested Yuya be his rival.</br>  <br>I don't remember that. Was it during their second Duel?</br>  <br>Oh god no<br><br>No not tears already<br><br>This isn't going to end well</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I miss Sora being a part of the main cast, he was great friends with them all - and even if some of that was a facade it hurts for him to be gone.</br></br>  <br>I know, that's why I'm sure that my theory might be wrong. But I like it so I'm still waiting to see what happens.</br>  <br>I warned you<br><br>I warned you since episode 1</br></br></br>  <br>If Jack learns of Clear Wing's ability before he Duels with Yugo, which may happen if he's forced to spectate the Friendship Cup, he may just attack it first for that unfathomable -500 points of damage. But if he's too prideful to do so (which I doubt to be honest) he'd activate SR's effect with something like Divine Wrath set in response to Clear Wing.</br>  <br> same eye colors <br>Not even the Kamishiro twins have the same eye color, mate.</br></br>  <br>Jokes on you Anon.<br><br>I didn't pick up this series to see Yuya get with Yuzu.  I came here to watch them kill each other </br></br></br>  <br>More to the point, Selena and Sora being related is moot. Sora didn't know of Selena until very recently, and Selena was raised with a very different concept of family. <br><br>Also the Yuyas and Yuzus probably don't even have biological families.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking damn, why is she so cute</br>  <br>Here's a pic for you.</br>    <br>Well they could be related, I mean if she was related with a different concept it could be just because they were kept separated, and that's her concept of family, distance. <br><br>I don't think they are either, but it'd be neat though either way.</br></br></br>  <br>Even cuter when she turns into a light-rending space alien demon queen.</br>  <br>SPOOGIE BOOGIE/10</br>  <br>Rio~</br>  <br> Yuya not relating to Yoko <br><br>His body and ass shows it though</br></br></br>  <br>She has to have something going for her considering she's Zexal's Asuka.</br>  <br> total number of victims: <br> Tetsuo <br>Really hoping for more from Yuzu when she goes off the wall.</br></br></br>  I need a hot-blooded deck that shows my fighting spirits of manly one on one action that doesn't involve dragons, does such a deck exist?  <br>Battlin Boxers</br>  <br><br><br><br>My Yu-Gi-Oh! waifu. Only even slightly contested by Rin. <br>Damn Rio made Zexal for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her son seems to be doing pretty well.</br>  <br>She'll just break down crying when Yugo dies, Yuya EGAOs, and she Yugo Shokans.</br>  <br>Hope.<br><br>You could also just summon Junk Warrior or Lightning Warrior and sit on them with S/T/Hand Traps.</br></br></br>  <br>Superheavy Samurai.</br>  <br>Just saying. It does make them look similar even if it turns out that they are not related.</br>  <br>I doubt Yuya is adopted, probably he's the unique one out of them all, also the way he looks up to his father is a normal father-son relationship every shounen MC has.<br><br>To be honest I think it will be shit writing if Yuya does turn out to be adopted.</br></br></br>  <br>Fire Kings</br>  <br><br>Neither of those are Fire.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>So much hot-blooded action. Looking forward to trying them out. Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess that's why Shun loves his sister so much.</br>  <br>Ha we'll be lucky to even get edgy Yuzu, Probably brainwashed Yuzu but not Edgelord, if anything only the MC in yugioh goes berserk when they snap, with the exception of Jesus Fudo.</br>  <br>Don't trust any of them.</br>  <br>That's why Yusei is worst. Never did a damn thing.</br>  <br> that art on everything but Penalty Box <br><br>Why does that look so off, it's like a weirdly drawn actual photo.</br></br></br>  <br>Brainwashed Yuzu taunting Yuya will be hot as fuck</br>  <br>I only thought that they were separated or something, like the Kiryuin sisters.<br><br>/a/rc-v also has the running theory that Sora and Yuri are brainwashed/mind-wiped or so I thought.<br><br>But I understand that my theory is kinda shitty.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus resisted temptation. Can have Yusei succumbing to the Shadow Realm.</br>  <br>I think the only instance of brain washing was the LDS trio. They still think Shun is their bro.</br>  <br>No, but even Jesus showed righteous anger. Yusei never showed any emotion at all.</br>  <br>So far we haven't had a single right theory outside of Reiji synchro keikkaku since the beginning when we aced the dimensions and multiple yuyas and shit.</br>  <br>And Sora being evil wasn't true? Riiiiiight...</br>  <br>Yusei showed righteous anger when it came to his bike and Stardust, especially Stardust, and especially when it got stolen in BBT. <br><br>But really, I liked Yusei and he was certainly better than Yuma (though that isn't saying much), but he really was just kind of there and a blank slate though. It was odd when compared to Yugi/Atem, Judai/Yubel/Haou/Ghost Cat/Professor Duo, and Yuya/Yuto/Evil Yusho Dragon thing?</br></br></br>  <br>He's not evil, just misunderstood. But yeah that was right too, it was just under the and shit category, but to be fair everyone was calling him the Bakura of Arc-V, which isn't entirely accurate, since I don't think Sora is the pen-ultimate villain.</br>  <br>Maybe the other bracelets simply don't have any function until Leo combines them with Yuzu's or whatever his ultimate plan with the Ruris is.</br>  <br> Yusei showed righteous anger when it came to his bike <br>I love manga Yusei sperging the fuck out when Akis qt Academy friends tried to touch his bike</br></br>  <br> Not evil, just misunderstood <br><br>I know that Sora will become good but that's going too far, anon.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;He will randomly appear in one episode, tell Yuya to EGAO, shill some new pendulum magicians and then go back home <br> &gt;Where he's been all these years is never explained </br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say anger, he was moreso ambitious to get said Stardust and bike back. He never displayed any notion of rage or upheaval to how he was betrayed. He just did the right thing for the sake of it, he wasn't very realistic or relatable as a result.<br>In a way Yusei and Yuma are polar opposites; Yusei being extremely dull and dare I say boring, whereas Yuma was way, way too eager and energetic and annoying. Yuya seems to be the tried and true balance between them. He's still jovial and happy-go-lucky, but at least shows some degree of pain when something goes wrong. He's a much more credible character that way.</br></br>  <br> Killing people is fun! Fusion is my only ally! <br>Poor guy, nobody understands him for what he really is.</br></br>  <br>But he's not killing people.<br><br>I know it, you know it, the entire non-children demographic that is watching Arc-V knows it that carding is just a way to be able to handwave a total party revival.<br><br>BUT HE STILL HAS TO BE A COMPLETE BUTTHURT JERK ABOUT IT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*IS<br><br>I hate this happens to me.</br></br></br>  Has anyone ever managed to get Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon'd by turn 2?  <br>Judging by Yugioh logic:<br>If you lose your soul you are hospitalized.<br>If you lose your entire body you are considered dead.<br>That's why getting 'carded' in this show is effectively death. Furthermore we have no way of knowing if the process is reversible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have... using Red-Eyes B. Dragon Engine w/ Odd-Eyes</br>  <br>You mean bring it out by Turn 2 or get beaten by it by Turn 2?</br>  <br>Yes, incredibly easy, especially with Red-Eyes I wish I was good at webms</br>  <br>What's a good way to combine Red Eyes and Odd Eyes/Magicians?</br>  <br>I don't use Magicians, it's an Odd Eyes/Apex engine</br>  <br>The way I see it, they'll all be revived at/towards the end of the show, and Reiji probably listed them officially as being "missing". That way, the people have some hope and we can also have dat dere juicy Xyz mass-uncarding for maximum feels.</br>  <br>I might have to update my deck, but 2 Odd-Eyes, 3 Antithesis Magician and 2 Synthesis Magician.<br><br>Its an old deck.</br></br></br>  <br>That still doesn't mean they're not presently dead. Some people define death as losing all forms of animation, and being paper is pretty damn inanimate. Whether it's reversible or not doesn't detract from the present consequence.</br>  <br>either one I've managed to pull it out twice in turn 2 before using skullcrobat joker. insight magician, pendulum call and sky arc before.</br>  <br> doesn't change anotther RR to level 3 <br>And here I was hoping it wouldn't be that bad.</br></br>  <br>It lets you access an optional R3 in an R4 deck. Did you expect it to dominate the archetype?</br>   want to try out BLS cards <br> there's so many of them you can't play a BLS-Gaia deck that is actually consistent <br> splitting the deck into BLS.dek and Gaia.dek works <br><br>Wanting to use all options in one deck is suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try using Qliphorts and Nekroz at once. Not easy.</br>  <br>I did not, but the option toturn your L4s into L3s would've been a huge upgrade. Mimicry also allows you to go into R5 with just your main deck RRs, I doubt the same in reverse would've been too broken.</br>  <br>I want Raid Raptors to be able to Rank Down all the way to R1 and Rank Up all the way to R12.<br>If you get from R1 to R12 in one turn you get an achievement.</br></br>  <br> Serena and Sora are related <br><br>I'm going with this, because it's adorable and insane at the same time.</br></br></br>  Ufff, too much conflict about Fusion fags. Post Academia images instead.  <br>BLS-Gaia Deck?<br><br>Why not try using with Odd-Eyes/Magicians?</br></br></br>      <br><br>Whoops wrong image.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait until Yuzu goes full ISIS. <br><br>BEHEAD THOSE WHO INSULT YUYA</br></br></br>  <br>http://ygorganization.com/blsdecks/<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>BLS and Gaia and Odd Eyes and Magicians and Blue Eyes and Fire Fist and Qliphort and Tellarknight and Igknight and Noble Knight and Nekroz and Hopu and Stardust and Raid Raptors and Super Heavy Samurai and Monarchs and McDonalds and Lamborghini and Mystical Space Typhoon...</br>  why to the Yuya and if that is the most important part is the best way for them, and the other being characters not important, how does?  <br>...What?<br><br>I don't understand and I tend to spell horribly a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Interesting that Zexal II is actually a completely separate series from the first part. It shows too.</br>  <br>hay retard, please learn better sentence structure.</br>   go to http://ygorganization.com/blsdecks/<wbr></wbr> <br> see the decks <br> think they're pretty cool <br> started reading the comments <br> all of them are cesspool lvl <br> one shitlord says he gonna make a Nekroz deck with them <br><br>why is it that majority of tcg players try to ruin things by adding shit to them to "make it better"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody uses decks the way they were meant to be made anymore. They always find ways to add shit from other sources to them to make them just as pointlessly broken as any other collection of the same cards.</br>  <br>Not TCG players, YGOrganization is largely infested with shitters.</br>  <br>To be fair, the official decks are pretty bad anyway.<br><br>Had much more success with my own one, and that one's not even optimized properly.</br></br></br>  Reposting<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TJ<wbr>fkBiCdaSs</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>The stream features the host of the Konami live streams, Yuichi and the producer of Legacy of the Duelist, Charles.<br><br>@3:04, Story mode is introduced and explained.<br><br>@10:15, The game will be using the January 2015 ban list. @12:15, This list only applies to ranked/online battles. If you want to play against your friends or the story mode, you can use whatever you like.<br><br>@10:45, There are attack animations for certain cards. Shown here when Seto attacks Yugi with Blue Eyes.<br><br>@23:20 and @1:07:50, Explaining/Showing off the in game card shop and the booster pack system. You get new cards by not only winning duels in story mode, but by also spending BP (Battle Points) that are awarded after a duel in the shop; with you getting enough BP to purchase about three packs per duel. Each pack contains eight cards, with the last card in the pack being of a high rarity than the other seven.<br><br><br>@ 34:20, Saving deck recipes is indeed back. A new feature they've added called "smart searching" allows you to highlight a card, then by pressing R1, you're able to instantly see all cards related to that card in your trunk without needing to filter your trunk and search for it yourself. For example, Charles went to Number 99: Utopic Dragon, used smart search, and saw all the cards related to it; e.g. all the Rank-Up spells and Utopia XYZ's, including various other monster and S/T support related to "Utopia". You can use smart search from your deck or trunk.<br><br>@ 37:30, No tag duels at launch, but it is being looked into.<br><br>@ 37:45, They show other new features that have been added to Deck Edit.<br><br>@41:30, Online server stability has been improved. But to really tell how well it’s performing, they'll have to wait until launch when the traffic will be high.<br><br>@48:00, Showing off Battle Pack Mode, both Sealed Play and Draft Play.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>@55:35, Another campaign duel. You can use the story mode deck or your custom created deck during story duels. <br><br>@1:02:10, By pressing the square button, you can play a "Reverse Duel", where in you play as the other character during story duels; e.g. you can play as Rex instead of Joey or Mako instead of Yugi to experience the story from the other side. <br><br>@1:03:10, This time around you can assign a different Yugioh character as your avatar to each individual deck you have, instead of just having one lone avatar to go with all of your decks.<br><br>@1:09:50, Once you beat a particular character once during the campaign, you have their deck recipe. So you are able to see, save, and use their story mode decks either locally or online.<br><br>@1:11:00, When using the card shop, it's easier to get three copies of individual cards; instead of buying packs hoping you'll pull what you need only to get 50 copies of the same card. <br><br>@1:15:45, Discussing DLC. Things that will be added and could possibly be added.<br><br>@1:17:35, Two new settings in the options called "Pro" and "Simple" were added. In all other Yugioh titles, the game would constantly ask you if you would like to respond to an activation or activate any spell speed 2 or higher card/effect whenever it was possible for you to activate it. Even though you could hold down the circle button to auto-skip the prompts and release it at any moment where you did want to activate something, a lot of people found this annoying/cumbersome. But with the "Pro" setting active, it will auto-skip all of the effect prompts without you needing to hold down a button and if you hold down X it will bring up a prompt. Since the window of activation is small, you better know when you want to play a card or the game will always assume that you don't want to activate anything (unless it's a mandatory activation of course).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The chat asked various questions throughout the stream and here are some of the responses worth mentioning:<br>The game comes out “Summer” of 2015.<br>The password option for inputting real card numbers to get that card in game in not in LotD.<br>There's no tournament mode. <br>There are card animations for particular "boss" monsters such as BEWD, Utopia, and The Dark Magician.<br>LotD goes up to The Secret Forces with "Nekroz", "Ritual Beast Tamers" and "Yosenju" being the last new archetypes added.<br>LotD follows the American version of the game, so cards that are not released in Japan are in this game, e.g. Burning Abyss.<br>You cannot trade cards between players in LotD.<br>Mircotransaction are confirmed for Story Mode DLC. With the possibility of the newest Arc-V cards being added over time.<br>Even though there will be a few cards coming out as DLC, all of the top tier archetypes (Nekroz, Shaddolls, Burning Abyss) will be obtainable in the base game.<br>There is no CPU vs CPU duel setting.<br>There is no voice acting in the game.<br>There is a Challenge Mode similar to Millennium Duels where you face <br>characters from different parts of the Yugioh series using the best/strongest possible version of their deck. You climb higher in the ladder as you win duels.<br>There is no Destiny Draw mechanic in the game.<br>There are trophies but no platinum.<br>With the ability to buy booster packs from the card shop, it is much easier to obtain cards in LotD versus MD.<br>More music tracks have been added with many returning from previous games.<br>TCG/EU exclusives are in the game, OCG exclusives are not.<br>LotD will be digital only.<br>Purchases made in Millennium duels WILL NOT carry over to Legacy of the Duelist.<br>Story mode encompasses Duel Monsters all the way to Arc-V.<br>The game includes voice chat for multiplayer.<br>The MSRP is $19.99.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But cards being usable and splashable in other decks as engines is a good thing. I wish they did it more, the worst archetypes and cards are things like Qliphorts and Ritual Beasts where all the cards are pretty much un-dilutable.</br>  <br>they're gonna fix it right a-anon?<br>they will add the fun r-right?</br></br>  <br> @1:15:45, Discussing DLC. Things that will be added and could possibly be added. <br>GX season 4 and the episodes of 5Ds that weren't dubbed will be DLC, along with more Arc-V content</br></br>  <br>Have you tested Envoy of the Evening Twilight?</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's by far the worst monster in the entire archetype. Unless you only banish 1 or 2 monsters for it, it's definitely not worth using.</br>  <br>So every time you beat a character, you get 3 of his cards?<br>Looks like I'm gonna be dueling Yusei a lot if I want to get my Synchron deck fast</br></br>  <br> LotD goes up to The Secret Forces with "Nekroz", "Ritual Beast Tamers" and "Yosenju" being the last new archetypes added. <br>What the hell? That's 6 months behind. They better add more recent sets in DLC</br></br>  <br>But if that happens it will just be the same cards over and over.<br>If anything Qliphorts are a breath of fresh air.</br></br>  <br>Or, you could just, you know, play on YGOPro.</br>  Is the next OP as catchy as Burn? I'm on episode 50 now.  <br>It's the best imo.</br>  <br>It's MARVELOUS!</br>  <br>Not really, it sounds like some jungle music imo<br><br>Like if Indiana Jones played Yugioh</br></br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure you have no idea how Indiana Jones mysic sounds.</br>  <br> If anything Qliphorts are a breath of fresh air. <br>I sure do love 80% of the cards in my decks being decided my Konami</br></br>  <br>I doubt they'll make it public. Rather, Archfiendman will covertly arrest her to use as leverage against Yuya so he'll teach Syncro's authorities about Pendulumu and do their dirty work by taking down the rebels. Then it will be revealed that they've been Leo's puppet state for ages since before the Lancers arrived.</br>  <br> tfw ritual beast but no gaiapelio </br>  <br>That's the idea, use this group of cards, and use them to fight that group of cards.

The usual appropriate time for flashbacks when you're in the middle of battle is when you're about to die, when you know the enemy you're fighting or watching someone you know fight and thinking of a related event.

It's just really VERY dull.</br>  <br> Rei only ever does what she is ordered to, <br>Nope, that'd be Asuka before Rei.<br>Rei even explains it herself in episode 6 that she doesn't pilot just because someone tells her to.<br><br>Rei had a personality since the very start, and it's her own personality. Rei can both do things for herself and for others, and that makes her more interesting and a better person.<br><br>We know this because there isn't anything in Rei that changes concerning that over the series, what changes are her motivations and relationships with the people she knows. This being Gendo, and Shinji plus the rest.<br><br>Rei's character development is steady over the course of the series, dealing with her emotional side (or lack thereof) which flows into her inner side. She has a character development worth following.<br><br>Asuka on the other hand stays the same over the course of the series as a person, and I'm talking about the fundamental bits that make you a person. She doesn't have a drive to change, she'll stay the same even if it kills her, and so it does.<br><br>That's why Rei has to save Asuka, and Asuka can't be there to save Rei later.<br><br> If anything, Rei is more purely for sex appeal <br>Nope, Asuka is the sex-appeal pilot because she has far more fanservice and her personality is largely ignored in favor of that.<br><br>Case in point: Shikinami.<br><br><br>I can say the same for Asuka. She just pilots because NERV tells her to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We know this because there isn't anything in Rei that changes concerning that over the series <br><br>aka she has no character development in a show about character development<br>aka she's a shit character</br></br></br></br>  <br> Case in point: Shikinami. <br>Shikinami is a totally different character from Sohryu and should be treated as such.</br></br>  <br>why cant we just ignore shikinami, anon?</br>  <br>aka you're full of shit<br><br>Rei has a personality since the start, Rei's character development doesn't encompass gaining a personailty and never did.<br><br><br>But the fans don't, since the only thing that matters is sex appeal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But the fans don't, since the only thing that matters is sex appeal. <br>I don't know many Eva fans (not shitposters on /a/) that don't class the rebuild counterparts of TV characters as different characters, Shikinami and Sohryu in particular.<br><br> Also there is no bad NGE character. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if we ignore Shikinami, the point is still valid.<br><br>20 years ago, Evangelion was made, and in it, Rei Ayanami existed as a character among many. In that series, the focus of the character was not sex, but it was the focus of another character; Asuka.<br><br>20 years ago, Rei was the best character and 20 years later, that fact is still true today.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you're full of shit anon.<br><br>NGE's characters are great, sure, but Rei just happens to be a superior character to Asuka. This is concerning the original.</br></br></br>  <br> I can say the same for Asuka. She just pilots because NERV tells her to. <br><br>Asuka's only defining trait isn't the fact that she's a pilot<br><br>She uses that rank as a pilot to hold an air of superiority over others, but that has nothing to do with any direct involvement from NERV. That arrogance is her own personality.<br><br>Later on she has a mental breakdown when she loses all her confidence once shinji starts beating her, and talks about how she hates herself and everyone else. That's a deconstruction of how she relied so much on her NERV-given rank to define herself - the show is aware of this, and uses it as a platform to expand her character by showing that she is left with nothing after the piloting stopped working out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nearly everyone, and I mean everyone, confuse Shikinami and Asuka. Same thing essentially by asuka fan standards.<br><br>It's because they NEED Shikinami as validation for NGE. The original Asuka was weak, unintelligent and failed as a pilot and a person in the original series, this is why Shikinami and other fantasy fanfiction versions are necessary to take the edge off reality.<br><br>People confuse them, and I don't think you're honest about not knowing someone who does.</br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder that all EVA waifus are shit and shinji is gay for kaworu  <br>That "arrogance" has been fostered by NERV since she was a child. Watch NGE, there's an episode where she's told she's "special" and was "selected".<br><br>Asuka's only defining trait is that she wants to be an EVA-pilot, the entire character is based around that, which is why when she can't, she loses it and fails as a person. She becomes her true self, a non-functional husk of a doll-person that purely exists for male masturbation. (EOE)<br><br>What all of this means, is that Asuka has no personality. She just latches onto a personality NERV gave her.<br><br>That's why Rei is the superior person with the superior personality, Rei's personality is actually hers. It's something she defined for herself and acted out herself.<br><br>Rei can betray "NERV" or Gendo as it suits her, but because Rei isn't a retard she knows that there needs to be a reason to do so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei only ever does what she is ordered to <br>Actually, that's a yes. In ep 22 she admits she'd kill herself if ordered too. <br>Asuka also develops in the series. The point of the two is to be opposites yet the same. <br><br> Asuka is the sex-appeal pilot because she has far more fanservice <br>Again, not true. In Japan where Rei is/was more popular, she has more pornography.<br><br> I can say the same for Asuka. She just pilots because NERV <br>No, Asuka pilots because she want to pilot and be the best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei's personality is actually hers <br><br>That's irrelevant<br>Rei's personality is nowhere near as interesting as a character, and it doesn't go anywhere. She has no development since all of her standards and guidelines are laid out ahead of time, with nothing changing about them.<br><br>In a show about developing characters, that makes her the worst written</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually, that's a yes. In ep 22 she admits she'd kill herself if ordered too.  <br>That's a no, because Rei doesn't need an order to kill herself. She'll do it as it fits her, and she does so in NGE even when NERV protests.<br><br>You misunderstand the situation just like Asuka did. Rei knows she can "die" and be replaced, and continue albeit broken. Rei knows that if it comes to it, she must kill herself because it'll give everything a chance to go on living. This is what she practices as a last resort, and if ordered, Rei would do so if necessary. If not necessary however, as demonstrated in the series, she wont. She won't follow any lesser orders either, as the series demonstrates in having her deny Gendo, the "main man" of NERV.<br><br> Asuka also develops in the series.  <br>But not as a person, she develops externally, her facade falls down. Her as a person never changes.<br><br> Again, not true. In Japan where Rei is/was more popular, she has more pornography. <br>Asuka has more pornography in Japan.<br><br> No, Asuka pilots because she want to pilot and be the best. <br>Something NERV told her to be, raised her to be. She was just a puppet all along. This is why the series likens her to a puppet in NGE.<br>Asuka then projects that onto Rei, who denies it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei doesn't need an order to kill herself. <br><br>Who said anything about 'need'?<br>Nothing's stopping her from killing herself some other way, but she would still kill herself if she was ordered to and she explicitly said this</br></br></br></br>  <br> That's irrelevant <br><br>How? It's the most relevant thing. If they have their own personalities or not. Rei's personality is her own, she grew that. <br>Asuka doesn't, her entire personailty is being the pilot NERV fostered her to be. Without it, she literally collapses.<br><br>Rei doesn't depend on anyone else like that, she's her own person. (not in the sense that she's a grown up, because that's a common usage of the word).<br><br>Rei goes many places as a character, her emotional bonds are explored and expanded upon in the series. She develops a better understanding of herself and people, and that makes for excellent character development. There's something Rei learns and takes into herself, that's development. It changes her.<br><br>Rei is the best written character because not only does she serve the purposes above, she also serves as a "what if" concerning transhumanism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the post again. She would kill herself if ordered, this assuming it's necessary. Rei doesn't do what she's ordered to do if it's totally retarded to do so. Killing herself isn't something that makes sense in every situation.<br><br>Rei will kill herself to save the rest and the others, something she demonstrates. <br><br>Like the show demonstrates, she'll do it anyway even if ordered not to, and if she's ordered to do something she doesn't think is right, she just won't do it.<br><br>Rei is very numb towards death.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What all of this means, is that Asuka has no personality <br>If that's true, then no one would have a personality as it's always defined by your job. <br><br>Rei is a retard and disregards her own existence because she knows she can just be replaced.<br><br>Rei is also not really a person since she's a clone with spare parts. Like a robot. This is why she has the personality of a wet sponge.<br>She was emo before emo.<br><br>Any personality Rei had was engineered into her like software.<br><br>Asuka is a REAL person. Rei is a doll, which is why Japan likes her so much. Obedient to a fault. Non-questioning, the perfect robot waifu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's irrelevant because why does it matter WHERE the personality came from? It's still a personality.<br><br> her entire personailty is being the pilot NERV fostered her to be. Without it, she literally collapses. <br>And we get to see what happens once she loses that in the show, which gives her character some actual depth. If that breakdown never happened then you would have an argument, but the fact that we get to see another side of her shows that she is a well written character with multiple layers.<br><br>The more you talk about rei the more it's apparent you like her as some mary sue perfect character who has no faults, which couldn't be any more of an idiotic reason to actually like a character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Again, not true. In Japan where Rei is/was more popular, she has more pornography. <br><br>Not really. In Japan, Asuka has more registered porn. You can also check that this is true by searching listings on doujindatabase or even sadpanda.<br><br>If you check pixiv, there's double the amount of Asuka images tagged "R-18" than there are Rei images also tagged R-18.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trucks can't have personalities.</br>  <br>Where you fail is understanding that she'd kill herself if ordered too. That doesn't mean she'd do so heroically.<br><br>So many statements you keep spouting about the character aren't, but a construct of your imagination to derive a perfect waifu in your minds eye.<br><br>If you like Rei great. I don't understand it but I don't need to invent bullshit to give a shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's irrelevant because why does it matter WHERE the personality came from? It's still a personality. <br>What matters if it's their own or not.<br><br>When someone just follows along a group or another person, doing what's expected of them or what they have laid out for them, we say that the person has "no personality."<br><br> And we get to see what happens once she loses that in the show, which gives her character some actual depth <br>It does give her depth, yes.<br><br>But it also confirms that Asuka has no real personality of her own. She's just a doll doing what NERV has trained her to do for around a decade.<br>She collapses without her identity, she's nothing, just a bitter failed husk of a person.<br><br>She is also discarded as such in the series, they get another pilot.<br><br>This is where Rei proves stronger because Rei has her own personality, and nobody can take that away from her except by literally killing her. <br>They did that, and do you know what happened? She still retained a core of her personality.<br><br>Now that's strength, now that's something that sticks.<br><br>Rei is not a Mary-sue perfect character, she is Rei Ayanami. Everything I've said about Rei is true and can be backed up by the series.<br>Rei is shit at social communication and struggles with mundane things, a Mary Sue doesn't do that.<br><br>She doesn't save the day and live, she has to suffer and die, and in the end the question is whether or not it was worth it. Not a Mary Sue at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   The visual representation of black isn't a color because no light refracts from it   <br>The series demonstrates that she won't do so even if ordered, or any other less things if ordered.<br><br>That's why you like Asuka, misunderstand the situation and the character.<br><br>Nothing is invented here. You take something at face value while ignoring the rest of the series, you've taken one statement out of context.<br><br>Asuka in NGE is an ignorant person, she doesn't know that Rei knows she can actually be replaced and would have no qualms saying that. You're being just as dumb and ignorant as Asuka is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What matters if it's their own or not. <br><br>You're making the mistake of analyzing all of these characters purely in-universe instead of on a higher level of analyzing a work of fiction regarding what makes a character more developed and interesting</br></br></br>  <br> She would kill herself if ordered, this assuming it's necessary <br>What evidence of this do you have besides your own deluded fantasy?</br></br>  <br> If that's true, then no one would have a personality as it's always defined by your job.  <br>No, Asuka places everything on her provided personality and fails because of it. <br><br><br>Rei is more of a real person than Asuka ever was, Rei had the guts and strenght to be who she is, to define that for herself. It doesn't matter how Rei was born, put together or otherwise conceived. She exists, like Asuka.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pink isn't a real colour </br>  <br>This has been gone over this and you are incorrect.</br>  Remind me never to make a reifag bait thread again<br><br>I've made a huge mistake</br></br>  <br>The anime. The only places Rei attempts to kill herself is when it's necessary. Nowhere else.<br><br>She even does this despite NERV personnel protesting, or not having her odered to do so. See episode 19 or episode 23.<br>When Gendo tells her to do as he wants with Lilith, she just says no and says he can't order her around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how when searching every one of those yields the same result.<br><br>Asuka has more porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't you just NOT be a fucking dick then?<br><br>I'm really tired of faggots trying to spout shit about Rei.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm really tired of faggots trying to spout shit about Rei. <br><br>go hug a body pillow</br></br></br>  <br> You're making the mistake of analyzing all of these characters purely in-universe instead of on a higher level of analyzing a work of fiction regarding what makes a character more developed and interesting <br>I'm using both. The in-universe just to explain what the character is, and the higher universe to relate it to our world.<br><br>Rei from our perspective directly pioneers many of Evangelion's concepts, some later used in EoE. The nature of the human being, the soul, the mind, and the heart. Everyone contributes, but Rei is within the show torn apart and has to discover those secrets for herself.<br><br>This is why Rei, before instrumentality even begins, is able to divine for herself ALONE the secret that Shinji finally gets in the end of the series. <br><br>Would it kill you to admit to the fact that in-universe, Rei is a stronger and better person than Asuka?<br><br>While they all make up a greater whole that is "Evangelion", what I just said here is true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She gets mind raped. Another argument without any merit. <br><br>And after getting mind raped and comatized; thereby becoming in essence Rei with a broken personality; She is forcibly awaken in combat new surroundings and becomes the hero, full of emotion and grown as a character.<br><br> This is where Rei proves stronger because Rei has her own personality <br>Again, delusion of your own mind<br><br> Everything I've said about Rei is true and can be backed up by the series <br>No it can't actually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei has no will of her own and thus no 'guts' to do anything she isn't told to do. <br><br>Rei defines nothing. Where the fuck do you get this shite from?</br></br></br>  <br> Would it kill you to admit to the fact that in-universe, Rei is a stronger and better person than Asuka? <br><br>From an objective standpoint she leaves a more postive impact on people<br><br>That doesn't mean she's a more interesting character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She gets mind raped.  <br>So does Rei, who has a different reaction.<br><br> She is forcibly awaken in combat new surroundings and becomes the hero, full of emotion and grown as a character. <br>In what fan-fiction does this happen?<br><br> Again, delusion of your own mind <br>You saying it's a delusion doesn't make it one. I proved it by showing that Rei's personality isn't provided, but since early in the series something Rei delves into herself.<br>There are internal monologues and references she makes that makes that clear.<br><br> No it can't actually. <br>Now you're just in denial.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd have to do it properly and well before the rebuild series.</br>  <br> evangelion is a good anime </br>  <br>Rei has more will than Asuka, the difference is that Asuka screams and cries a lot, while Rei stays quiet.<br><br>Rei and Asuka's will is tested in the anime, what Rei believed in is challenged and she is faced with emotional trauma and loss, every time Rei still stays strong.<br><br>Asuka doesn't. It takes nothing for her to crumble.<br><br>Rei defines the boundaries not just of her own personality but the very human soul in episodes like 14, on a level which makes Asuka a comparative kindergartener.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet she'd do so if ordered. Robot</br>  thread gets evacuated <br>please leave through the marked emergency exits<br>-sincerely your anti neet discussion department</br></br>  <br> That doesn't mean she's a more interesting character <br>Nor did I say so.<br><br>She's an interesting character on a non-fanservice level because she deals with issues (as an in-universe character) relating to human existence, and out-of-universe she is very clearly a sci-fi demonstration of themes like transhumanism and emotions.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Asuka has more porn dude. Count the number of Asuka pictures with the porn tag, and she has way more than Rei.</br>    <br>She wouldn't do so in every situation, something the series proves.

I-Is not! Actually, I’m not the one being sly, it’s you, senpai!” <br><br>Well if anything, I'm glad we got the full context of this scene. This line kind of confused me in the anime since the progression of the conversation didn't give me the impression of 8man acting "sly" in anyway; so I just assumed it was Iroha doing making a comeback. <br><br>But after reading the chapter it actual does kind of give the impression of 8man being sly; at least from Iroha's perspective. Denying the fact that he has a preference for younger girls, but bringing up her birthday and commenting that he doesn't consider her younger than him (in other words it could be interpreted by her as him saying she is still in his hit zone), does actually sound like he's being tsundere about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Watari sabotage her character like that?<br>I'm very depressed.<br>Does she have any chance of of development?<br>It looks like a never ending night for her.<br>I'm not so sure anymore about what will happen to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouhou, is that you?</br>  <br> Yukino <br> character </br></br>  <br>  not ZR <br>8/10<br><br><br>  being this much of a faggot </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yuki <br> no </br></br></br>  <br> Why did Watari sabotage her character like that? <br>It's not so much sabataging as it is setup. All of her defenses are down around 8man. She wants to be herself but doesn't know who that is. Yukino will be a much stronger character once her issues have been resolved.<br> I'm very depressed. <br>Fuck off with your blogshit.<br> Does she have any chance of of development? <br>She has the highest chance of character development out of any character in the series right now.<br> It looks like a never ending night for her. <br> I'm not so sure anymore about what will happen to her. <br>Quit being so pessimistic. Remember that this is literature. Every time a problem is introduce it's so that it can be resolved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukinofags <br> taste <br><br>Go back to animesuki and circlejerk with that Spyro tripfag.</br></br></br></br>  rip sexy yukino<br><br>fuck FEEL</br></br>   She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt.

Occasionally, I’d learn from the masses, take in the mood, and play it off. Then, I’d just brush it all off with a simple “it’s what everyone’s doing.” Doing that made you want to have expectations, be spoiled, lose yourself, and wait. <br><br> But I don’t think that’s something you should do. <br><br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br> “By the way…” <br><br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br><br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br><br>The fact in this scene that 8man genuinely take initiative by himself to step forward his relationship with Yui is something rare to seen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gigolo: a young man paid or financially supported by an older woman to be her escort or lover. <br>Not that anon, but she specifically mentioned that guy was a gigolo, who left and took the furniture with him when he was done with her.

Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br> “Huh? U-Um, yeah, I do… I think, “ Yuigahama said, prattling on and moving her hands in surprise. She fidgeted as she frantically took out her cellphone. But then, her movements abruptly stopped. <br> She shot a glance to the door of the club. After that, she had trouble bringing out her voice. And unlike earlier, her expression sank. <br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again? I just wasn’t confident in any of those. <br> Unable to exchange any more words, I glanced at her face, my back still slumped and my eyes downcast. The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. <br> To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying he didn't invite her just because he feel guilty about delay it too long (and gone with Iroha in the mean time also) </br>  <br>Thanks anon, been waiting to grab this for a while now. <br><br><br>I was thinking that might have been what motivated him to ask her. In the anime it feels like it almost comes out of nowhere, but considering that pang of guilt he felt at the end of the Iroha date, it seems likely that he asked her because of that.</br></br></br></br>  The producer of the anime said that the ending of episode 13 will be gut wrenching and very painful.<br><br> Where was the pain? </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I thought he feels guilty because he already doing date with another woman(Iroha) before fulfilling his promise with Yui.</br></br></br></br>  TL-Irohafag,<br>Can you give a summary of this?</br>  What is this face<br><br>trying to convey?</br></br>     8man can't make up his mind <br>   he gets won over by Yui during someday <br>   they start dating <br>   Yukino very supportive, but sad inside <br>   8man talks to Yukino alone about his relationship with Yui <br>   Yukino confesses her feelings one last time and cries into his chest <br>   she sneaks a kiss and they give into their primal desires <br>   8man starts ignoring Yui more and more while meeting Yukino on the side <br>   Yukino and Yui's friendship causes drama, 8man just avoids them both for a while <br>   not sure what to do, he decides to hang out with Iroha <br>   this time she's more sly than ever and 8man reciprocates, they fuck like rabbits <br>   8man, brimming with confidence, starts putting the moves on everyone <br>   he goes after Saki, Sensei, Haruno, and even Miura at one point <br>   word gets out that 8man is a manslut, he gets shunned by everyone in the school <br>   Yui says she still loves him after all this time, 8man is happy and they start dating again <br>   Yukino invites 8man over to officially end things between them <br>   8man recieves a textmessage <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aQ3<wbr>Xs86Io00</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It says  fuck you EOP, you girl is a slut </br>  <br>What's this face trying to convey?</br>  <br>Even so he is eager to fulfill his promise with Yui properly as his monolog in this scene.<br><br> I understood what Komachi meant when she said “next time”. The “promise”, though I wasn’t sure if I could really call it that, was something I did make tentatively. The problem was when, where, and how to ask about it. Having no semblance of experience with going out with others had me at a loss at a time like this. Just how did everyone invite each other when going out? <br><br>Which is actually weird where he could just try to half assed it like he did in iroha's date(movie scene, scoring scene) if he doesn't have any feeling for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's too alpha.</br>  <br>Is that so?</br>  Why does no one care about the translations? I haven't seen a single person comment on 8man asking Yui out other than myself. I feel like such a significant scene in terms of romance should have more attention.  <br>It has been brought multiple times, specifically, episode 12 and 13 tone down 8man's myriads of emotions.</br>  <br>Not a date, much less as a romantic gesture. Maybe until Hachiman starts praising Yui as the ideal and real thing he seeks, then maybe things will change. Until then though.</br>  <br>Yukinofags and Irohafags are trying to pretend this scene didn't happen.</br>  <br>I don't get why the anime staff would do that.</br>  <br>You missed SORE ARU</br>  <br>Because no one knows 8man intention to invite Yui to a date.<br><br> May be he will ask her out, may be he will reject her by confess he has feeling for another girl (this is what Yui thought, too) </br></br></br>  <br>Komachi x Saki no otouto</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's why he deliberately ask her out in the valentine mood. <br><br>That's also why he felt slightly upset when Yui rejected him.<br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? </br></br></br></br>  <br>At very least it implied in that scene he did it without intention to hurt her.<br><br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br><br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again?

The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. <br><br> To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br><br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br><br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? <br><br>So I think he didn't do it to reject her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Or maybe because this wasn't anything we didn't know about and they've been promising each other to go on a date since volume 6? <br><br>While it is significant that 8man was the one who asked, there's no point in talking about it. Much like every other time they've promised to go out before, it'll be pushed back, most likely because of Yukino's request.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that's also why he felt slightly upset when Yui rejected him. <br>Really? I thought he is feel hurt when he see her in that state.<br> The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm chalking they don't want to make him look unnaturally emotional... because he always look deadbeat outside genuine scene<br><br>Because all his frustration were monologue, and monologues are hard a shit to do properly</br></br></br>  <br>Yui's date been pushed back so many times it'll probably only succeed on the 8th try. cos 8 allegory and all that shit.</br>  <br>I was being sarcastic</br>  <br>I am a Yukinofag though, and even the Yuifags weren't discussing it.</br>  <br>Indeed he didn't want to hurt her, but that doesn't mean his intention wasn't to reject her.<br><br>Maybe he wanted to let her down in the smoothest way possible. Or maybe he was interesting in going out with her and was afraid he asked at the wrong time. It's really unclear.</br></br></br>  <br>Same old ambiguous approach kills it for me. Not wanting regrets but taking in the mood at the same time probably makes sense for 8man since he still needs an external reason to push him but eh it's so wishy-washy from WW. <br><br>Wouldn't hurt to make things stronger with the endgame in sight. Make things more high-stake for Hikki and us is all I'm asking.</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe he wanted to let her down in the smoothest way possible <br><br>I doubt it is his intention. The fact 8man himself know how fearful rejection are, and he did ask her out around valentine day out of any day just for reject her in the smoothest way possible is totally out character for me especially for someone inexperience in human relationship like he is.</br></br></br>  <br>At this point  pretty much sums up my feelings on the whole thing. There's an argument to be made for just about every possible intention imaginable<br><br>Watari has this nasty habit of progressing the story while somehow managing to never make it clear what exactly is going on.<br><br>For a story told from 8man's perspective we know almost nothing about how he feels.<br><br>Even his "something genuine" is something he explains he's not even sure exists and can't describe properly. Gee, thanks Watari, that helped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly Yahari would be better as third person narration<br><br>With absolutely zero bias, Watari can fully control the amount of information given to the readers at any given time.<br><br>Then again<br>  High school harem comedy <br>  3rd neutral POV <br>  Not first person self insert <br><br>Market demands</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monologues and introspection helps to make the individual scenes great imo and WW does it well. I don't mind ambiguity in those since it helps establish the gap the characters are facing but guddammit if my earlier point about WW being wishy washy doesn't tick me off time to time since it's clear he's playing coy too much about 8man's feelings.</br>  <br><br> 147,055　Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.

Can't even remember what it was about with all the drama</br>  <br> This fucker will pull a Komi <br>Not possible, it takes at minimum half year to update.<br><br>Just like with Infinite Shit, people's patience has limits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely the LN will end with their issues tackled, but if you want a romance end, buy the Vita VN</br>  <br>Basically the story started with Hiratsuka taking 8man to the service club and asking Yukino to help make him a better person.<br>She mentioned that they are both very interesting people and wanted to see what would happen if she put them both in the same room together.<br><br>Ever since then it has been about the service club helping people get through their issues and learn more about themselves along the way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>L-Lewd.</br>  <br>Sensei really nails this look.<br>10/10, would marry.</br></br>  <br>What about Yukino?</br>    <br> Responsibility <br>[ ] Take<br>[ ] Leave</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino is a beauty in anything, but yeah, she looked really good during that arc.</br>  <br> Yukino is a beauty in anything <br>Anything?</br></br>    <br>Nice boat</br>  <br>See </br>  <br><br>Her appearance is literally the only thing good about her,<br>yet FEEL fucked up her character design.</br></br></br>  <br>Because we all know Yui is going to win in the end<br><br>He has never asked another girl out on a date before; its foreshadowing the Yui conclusion</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not going to play your game, too exhausted for that.</br>  <br><br><br>For what it's worth, I'm glad you're venting your frustrations here instead of on your friends and family. May you all live long and fulfilling lives.</br></br></br>  <br>Well that's why i need proper translation of this page to conclude how 8man actually feel about Yui after seeing her "nasty" side.<br><br>Here my bizzare conclusion( i don't really confident about it though) from this page: <br>-In his monologue there is line that show 8man doesn't want to lie to someone important to him.(I think it refering how he reject Yui proposal because he thinks it is wrong thing to do and he truly think Yukino should solve her own problem by herself.)<br><br>-After Yui said" I thought hikki would say that...". <br>8man's face become like "copper"(red?/embrassed?) when seeing her face smiling with flowing tears in her cheek. and he said in his monologue he doesn't want to seeing her Zama-like face(sad face?/"not nice girl"face?)anymore.<br><br>-Another 8man and Yui broken eye contact(8man avert his face because embrassment i guess?).<br><br>- In his monologue 8man said something like<br>even i(8man) and her(Yui) had different answer for now. it doesn't really matter as long as they continue seeking right answer together.<br><br>-Yui seeing 8man with straight face, bla-bla-bla something cut off to next page.<br><br>source: google translate with some research for each word.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>forgot the image.</br>  <br>The weird thing is with Yui its all about taking steps over lines and shit. If you take into account his asking her out, I dont get the feeling there were romantic overtones in why he asked her out (as not Vol 11). Its just him yet again trying to gauge the distance between them and him taking into account the mood and shit<br><br>Meanwhile, when he asks Yukino to be his friend (twice mind you), he monologues about how his heart starts fluttering and how he feels passion swelling up in him. Im not saying that this points to a Yuki end but these emotions feels are closer to "romance" <br><br>Compare: <br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? <br><br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Haruno x truck-kun <br>don't bully Haruno</br></br>  <br>The whole "He and She have yet to reach the conclusion" is a theme that has been recurring with Yui and Yukino since the series began. <br><br>I remember in Vol 6, the final chapter was titled "At last, he and she find the correct answer" but in this case the she was referring to Yukino since that chapter wraped up the Yukino never lies subplot and HachixYuki's relationship was finally mended (at the time)</br></br></br>  <br> even i(8man) and her(Yui) had different answer for now. it doesn't really matter as long as they continue seeking right answer together <br><br>Seems similar to what he monologued to Yukino about the colors of the sky in Vol 10.5</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to believe this but at this point after seeing flag after flag raised for every single ending imaginable I've pretty much resigned to accept the fact that Watari is going to do everything in his power to confuse us.<br><br>I take solace in knowing the anime favored Yukino but it's not source material so as with everything else in the series you just have to accept that it's not clear evidence.</br></br></br>  <br>I like what you pointed out here but the bigger takeaway for me was this:<br><br> Yuigahama is a kind person, that was how I decided baselessly. <br><br> Yukinoshita is a strong person, that was how I forced my ideals onto her. <br><br> Thinking like that was how I kept relying on them. For that exact reason, I couldn't rely on them anymore. I can't run away from her kindness, neither could I answer that kindness with lies. <br><br> Because, Yuigahama is a kind person, and Yukinoshit is a strong person. <br><br>The characters for "kind" and "kindness" were kept the same throughout this part and it's pretty obvious it's referencing Yui right here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to this anime? Is the studio on a hiatus?<br>And also while I'm here, is the LN worth picking up if the best girl obviously isn't going to be the end game?</br>  <br>godammit I missed an a. sorry yukinofags ;_;</br>  Watari has an annoying habit of furthering the plot without actually advancing it (if that makes sense)<br><br>Take his relationship with Yui and whatever it may entail. He made progress this chapter but in the end he is still after Volumes and Volumes still trying to gauge the distance with her. <br><br>Yukino is slight different than Yui in that the gauging of distance has never been the focial point of their relationship (barring him asking about the career path). Its pretty clear that everytime shit happens between YukixHachi, they get closer to each other only for another problem to arise between them that leads to more conflict (though I suspect that wont be the case anymore)<br><br> Yukino never lies/Culture Festival Arc <br> Ebina Confession/Stuco Election Arc <br><br>Shit hit the fan between them and they grew closer by the end of the arc<br><br> Yukino's Identity/Dependency Issues <br>The current and I believe final problem that will arise in their relationship whatever it may be and I suspect that they will grow closer by the end of it as well. <br><br>If you're a Yukinofag, I guess you can take solace in knowing that the overarching plot has always been about Yukino and Hachiman since Volume 1 (though this does not mean they are endgame, Yui can still win)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is EOP speaking, but from what I get, Hachiman is thinking about the sheer difference of 'nice girl' and nice girl.<br><br>You know that stereotype about nice guys being secret assholes? The old Hachiman think Yui is the same, because he's not rejected and ridiculed not once, but twice by that type of girl.<br><br>But with Yui, he realized that her kindness and love for him is genuine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All it means is that he is over "nice girls" which everyone expected he would have to get over by the time the series ends.<br><br>It also means that he can either accept or reject Yui without regrets/baggage surrounding his decision. Because if he rejects Yui without ever fully being over "nice girls", then it wont be a genuine rejection (he rejects her because he hates nice girls and not for Reason X)<br><br>Same vein, he would never accept Yui's confession if he mistakens Yui's love for something else (nice girls being well nice)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> best girl obviously isn't going to be the end game? <br>But Iroha is clearly on track to winning</br></br>  <br>  clearly on track of winning <br>Did you miss the exact post where 8man flat out said her action didn't affect him much?<br/></br></br>  The very last volume, the epilogue, is going to be exactly like Ben-To's last volume.<br><br>Every girl will win<br><br> and when every girl wins, no one does </br></br></br></br>  <br>If nothing else I expect 8man and Yukino to have the strongest relationship by the end of the series, even if they aren't interested in each other romantically.<br><br>Like I've said before, at this point in the series it's clear they're likely to be lifelong friends at the very least.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop linking your shitty bait post</br>  <br>Stop getting baited</br>  <br>You could simply say that Watari is a hack author and can only advance the plot by using continued drama.</br>  <br>  Bait <br>Right, anon. Of course it's a bait.<br><br>Tell me why is Iroha never involved with main plot and the drama that entails?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now this is more clever. Well done anon.<br><br>Practice more and you can master the art of baiting.</br></br></br>  <br>Here is your reply</br>  <br>And what else would you suggest he use to advance the plot of his character drama? comedy? maybe a few fight scenes?</br>  <br>He could use more fluff to stop the fucking dramatrain and give them development all the same<br><br>But noooo, Watari gave literally everything to Iroha because he had such a big boner for his kouhai.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see your answer anon.</br>  <br>Here is your reply</br>  <br>ʎldǝɹ ɹnoʎ sᴉ ǝɹǝH</br>  <br><br>Ⓗⓔⓡⓔ ⓘⓢ ⓨⓞⓤⓡ ⓡⓔⓟⓛⓨ</br></br>  <br>Anon you're coming off as a frustrated YYfag who's envious of Irohafags.<br><br>Watar's writing is questionable and by no means perfect. If you really want to discuss this can you be more specific in what you take issue with? All you're giving us is vague statements.</br></br></br>  <br>He's an Irohafag, logic doesn't dictate their thoughts or actions. They just can't handle how far ahead Yui and Yukino are.</br>  I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?  <br>By using unexpected events. Like  Komachi failed the exam  for example.</br>  <br> against her will </br>  <br>It's confirmed to be 100% friendship<br><br>She's just confused since she has never had a genuine friendship before.</br></br></br>  You guys have been circlejerking too much, don't you get tired? Most of the replies have been recycled to oblivion.  <br>I like Iroha, but I wish Watari can balance things out instead of giving rom com to one side and full on drama to the others.<br><br>I mean, Iroha doesn't even see anything resembles conflict since V9. How the hell that's considered good storytelling? Or is Iroha really third wheel to YY like YYfags and Irohaters believe?</br></br></br>  <br>I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Yukino acting like a schoolgirl around her crush?</br>  <br>She already is a school girl so she can't not act like one.</br>  <br>Self inserters like school gurls that act virginal</br>  <br>Not him, but I do prefer those kind of stories that plot doesn't just happen conveniently to make the characters growing closer or solving recent popped up problems.<br><br>Also, I will be more pissed off if he introduce Iroha just to be a plot device. Like her existence is just for 8man to grow out of his fear for nice girl, change his perspective towards girls, make the other heroines realize their feelings towards 8man... or some of those cases.<br><br>WW must be better than that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875473 <br> nobody is actually stupid enough to believe _____ <br>you would be surprised</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875473 <br> mfw this is almost word for word the reply I expected. <br>4 months of BTBs and you know each and every kind of answer, bait, falseflag or reverse falseflag</br></br>  <br>deleted mfw because you've actually clarified your point much better here, sorry for implying you were just trying to bait.</br>  <br> I mean, Iroha doesn't even see anything resembles conflict since V9. <br>Because she's done.</br></br>  YYfag here<br><br>I think Iroha should win because she has the best chemistry with 8man, likes him the most without having issues, and has made his life better so far. He has shown that he has a much more healthy relationship with him than YY. YYx2 will be developed but I can no longer think of them as legit romantic interests.</br></br>  ^ DON'T REPLY TO BAIT  At this point I'm sure we're all aware that the anime highlighted Yukino's scenes and downplayed or cut out the other girls' scenes.<br><br>Is it naive to think that this was done because they know that Yukino will win?</br></br>    yfw V12 wrapped up all the drama <br>  V13 have Yahari returns to the roots of case per episode but with post-development character </br>  <br> At this point I'm sure we're all aware that the anime highlighted Yukino's scenes and downplayed or cut out the other girls' scenes. <br> Yui and Iroha got all the budget while Yukino scenes always look off. <br>Gee, I wonder if that's true.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>They did it this way because WW wants Iroha end to be a surprise. Yukino flags are red herrings.</br>  <br> mfw after stories almost never happen </br>  <br> Or is Iroha really third wheel to YY like YYfags and Irohaters believe? <br>I hate to say "yes" to a reasonable Irohafag but probably, yes. Yahari is drama now, and Iroha appears to quite literally be the comedy relief (as in comedic elements included in a serious work to relieve dramatic tension).<br><br>I'm a die hard Yuifag, but I have no issues with Yukino winning because of the direction the story has gone, and if Watari manages to actually bring Iroha into the central conflict as you suggest, I'd have no problem with her winning either.<br><br><br>I would love a full epilogue volume of "classic" Yahari shenanigans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention Kawasaki and Orimoto, too.<br><br>And Zaimokuza and Totsuka almost disappeared in volume 11.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just the director being Yukinofag. Watari wouldn't reveal the ending to anybody but his editor because it would be leaked<br><br><br>And then the series continues for 12 more volumes of drama-free SoL,  nandatte and best friends </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you anon I'm laughing so hard</br>  <br>You know what I mean. They basically cut out every hint that 8man has feelings for Yui. Meanwhile they made the infirmary scene a much bigger deal than it was in the LN.<br><br>And just look at pic related. If that isn't favoritism I don't know what is.</br></br></br>  <br> look at these dumb goys, they actually think there will be a resolution or a plot point during the next arc <br>I wonder how much he laughs about all the shekels he makes?</br></br>  Right now, if the feelings they have are really love then there's almost no way for 8man to answer one isn't there? I mean, seeing your bestfriend spend the rest of her life with someone that you wanted to do the same with, is just painful and would surely make their relationship crumble. I've always wanted Yukino to win but it seems like there's null chance of that happening.<br><br>One way I can see this getting resolved where someone wins is that:<br> they all realize their feelings <br> it isn't love, but friendship <br> Iroha wins at the end <br> YY happy <br> 8man happy <br> Iroha happy <br><br>All conflicts resolved, all characters happy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they want to put emphasis on Yui being underdog, seriously, all her suffering were beautifully animated while Yukino just meh.<br><br>The train scene was the worst offender. Iroha's 'take responsibility' was pretty touching while Yukino lost her socks for some reason (?) despite being very important to put emphasis to her budding romance and growing reliance to 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>  Yui lost <br>  Friendship <br>You serious M8?</br></br></br>  <br>Come on man, we're actually having proper discussion for once, save your retarded "Irohafag" posting for later.</br>  <br>not quite favoritism but no way a scene like this was going to be established in the novels.<br><br>Yukinoshita and I exchanged knowing smiles to each other while Yuigahama cast a forlorn expression towards the ground.<br><br>fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff<wbr>ffffffffffff</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw Iroha wins and WW is all like "what? Did I really say I dropped some hints in volume 10? Sorry but you heard it wrong, I said "during" volume 10 though" then point out to that alma mater twitter status </br>  Hayato x Yukino vanilla doujin when?  <br> vanilla <br>pls</br></br>  <br>When hell freezes over.</br>  <br><br><br>I wish there's one, even non-h would be fine.<br><br>It's not even NTR, I just like the possibility.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The artist could frame it by starting the story on a double-date with HayaYuki and HachiYui. Vanilla premise established.</br>  <br> Hayato watching ____ x faceless fat men vanilla doujin when <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br>The end of vol 11 he basically says that he knows that it will break them all up but would rather be genuine than not. Friends end can happen (it is likely to happen) but only after everyone suffers somehow, there will be no more ignoring of feelings by anyone but 8man. 8man can answer if he truly loves them romantically, he is already on the path of being able to handle human relationships.<br><br>There will be no "I don't want to hurt you (or other YY) so we will stop" plot line, genuine 2.0 nipped that in the bud.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a very rare market then. The only thing a Hayato x Yukino vanilla would do is piss people off. At least with NTR there's the masochists who would buy it. With vanilla it doesn't appeal to anyone.</br>  <br>You know damn well this will end in NTR  for Hayato. <br>If it were a doujin.</br></br>  <br> Like this one? <br><br> Yuigahama, however, shook her head and interjected. “I think… I really am unfair… It’s because I can never stop you or even help you. And also… for a bunch of other things.” <br><br> Yuigahama’s words were in a jumble, perhaps because she was trying to think while she talked. But it’s due to that that I felt her words were from the bottom of her heart. In the same way she’d laugh to hide her embarrassment or mumble her words and look away, I’m sure she wanted to play it off somehow. <br><br> But even so, she looked straight at me, as though wanting to tell me everything. <br><br> “That’s why… That’s why, when something like this happens again, I’ll make sure to do it.” <br><br> Her sincere expression and her slowly weaved words were imbued with a sense of reality but also an empty ambiguity. Eventually, everyone would make sure to do it. They had to, even if they didn’t know what it is that they needed to do or if they could do it. I’m sure that’s something that everyone thinks about, even if vaguely. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Typeset anon here. Can someone please translate this so I can finally complete the body swap doujin?  8man has no romantic feelings for Yukino  <br>Maybe, but why does he get so flustered when she looks at him.</br>  Iroha has no romantic feelings for Hayato  <br> anime </br>  <br>Because they were trying to represent his monologues visually instead of having Eiguchi constantly rattling them off.<br><br> He does have romantic feelings for her though.  Of course, the same goes for Yui and Iroha too.  </br></br></br>   Blah blah you jsut finished the book <br> Pokan is a God, gahamama kawaii blah blah <br> Holy crap, I already wrote so many books. <br> Blah blah watch anime, read manga, give money, make me happy. <br> See you in vol 12.

She then whispered quietly, “Jeez. You’re such a pain, Hikki… Fine. Why don’t you treat me to honey toast next time then…? Say, Chiba’s Pasela.” <br><br> “You’re going to choose the place too….?” I spoke bitterly, but even I knew what the meaning behind that was. <br><br> Because of that, I found myself gauging my distance with Yuigahama again. <br><br> I really do think we’ve gotten closer compared to before. I’m not so immature that I would deny that fact out of desperation. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not good at anything else though</br>  <br>Holy shit!

Yui-motherfucking-gahama Yui.<br>Oh, and sensei too, but she's pretty much irrelevant for this game.<br> Uh, and Saki indirectly, I guess. <br>Yui got a huge advantage, too bad she never used it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>14/16</br>  <br>this is so wrong www</br>  <br>15/16</br>  <br>this is nice though.</br>  <br> Even at this late point in the game, the both of 'em still don't have 8man's phone contact, nor he got theirs. <br><br>I have bad news for you, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>16/16<br><br>That's all folks.<br><br>Translated Yahari Fanart:<br> http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megurin Power is 2 stronk fanartist pls nerf</br>  <br>Why am I not surprised</br>  <br> Yui got a huge advantage, too bad she never used it. <br>Fuck, if you think about it, this is her greatest blunder so far. Some 10 months of being the only girl his age having his phone number, and she never EVER tried to flirt via mial, or even talk a little. Not even once she ever tried to strike a phone conversation with him, other than that stupid shit about hieroglyphics back then. Even freaking sensei had her beaten in that regard. Yui is really, REALLY dumb.<br>And I still don't get why motherfucking Iroha amonst everyone still didn't get his contact. Yukino is one thing since she's autistic as fuck, but Iroha? Seeing her character, you would think she'd have asked for it ever since their meeting back in vol.8 when 8man was with Hayama and Orimoto. Then she would've never let a day goes by without chatting up or just bothering her favourite senpai. This is really weird. Or is it just a mistep on Watari's part?</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe her flirts weren't genuine after all </br>  <br> Or is it just a mistep on Watari's part? <br>I don't think Watari can miss it, it has to be deliberate on Iroha's part because 8man can't be arsed to ask ANYONE their number.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying something changed on that front? Then you misunderstood me, it would actually be good news to me, anon.<br>But you're still right, though, there's still bad news for me, but I know of it already, since I can manage a little of moonrunes. Nothing changed about that in Vol.11. That's your bad news for me right there.</br></br>   “How the heck do you know her birthday!? That’s scary! You’re creepy, Hikki… No, seriously…” <br><br>Why does Yui's insults feel that much more mean spirited against 8man? IS it because unlike Against Komachi, Yukinon or Iroha he doesn't fight back against Yui? <br><br>She has by far the worst chemistry and interaction with 8man. Frankly even the likes of Saki, Totsuka and Sensei has better chemistry with the guy. Perhaps even to the point of the cunt, Tobe and Ebina having better chemistry. <br><br>I like Yui,  and Yuimom even more  but she's just a supporter to the cast.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you read volume 10.5 when Iroha got hold of 8man's cellphone for whole day?</br>  <br>You mean Iroha, right? Yeah,  I kinda think so, too. <br><br>Huh, what? I think you tried to say two different things, but mixed them up and fucked up...</br></br></br>  <br>That's her way to express extreme jealousy, moron.</br>  <br>Frankly, they failed at all accounts. Feel was far worse than the previous studio who adapted S1. <br><br>It's ridiculous how many important scenes FEEL skipped. Some of the scenes are extremely important and relevant to the characters and problems at hand. Fucking hell, I was one of the idiots who said shit like "let's give them a chance."</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha still has no 8man number.<br>8man won't ask for cellphone number.<br>Therefore Iroha did it deliberately, or just don't care enough/simply forgot to ask.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and? I don't think that what you presume happened really did happen, you know.</br>  <br>That doesn't make it any better. her Interaction with 8man is still terrible.</br>  <br>Iroha probably had his phone number by now, not only that she most likely had read his whole conversations history, text messages, emails, contacts, photos and everything else. <br><br>That's why she strongly suggested the three members of Service club taken a photo together by 8man's phone, because she didn't find any "memory" in that phone.</br></br></br>  <br> just don't care enough/simply forgot to ask <br>These are both not possible.<br>I say it's all a hack from Watari as usual, is the only logical conclusion.<br>Just think about Yui's study plan in Vol.2, WW is just a big, huge hack.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>One might assume that she didn't ask directly for his phone number because she doesn't want to appear to be really interested in 8man yet.</br></br>  <br>That seems to be the most likely answer considering her slyness/playing pretend.<br><br>She's too considerate for all out attack, lacking confidence to beat YY or both</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Did WW mention 8man doesn't have Iroha/Yukino's phone numbers in the novel before? If not then I think he just didn't mention about the phone messages that's all. This isn't a diary so 8man is free to omit stuff he doesn't want to talk about.</br></br></br>  <br>Based anon, many thanks. Full zip?</br>  <br>He probably has Iroha's (or at least Iroha programmed it into his during 10.5 when she had her phone)<br><br>Pretty sure he doesnt have Yuki's contact though</br></br></br>  <br>*had his phone</br>  8man will win the sensei contest and then order Yukino to give him her #  <br>Why does 8man look so fucking happy in that pic?</br>  <br>Perrier</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Didn't make one.

Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1. Yui<br>  + She is the only girl known in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her, she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha probably had his phone number by now, not only that she most likely had read his whole conversations history, text messages, emails, contacts, photos and everything else. <br> That's why she strongly suggested the three members of Service club taken a photo together by 8man's phone, because she didn't find any "memory" in that phone. <br><br>Irohasu kowai!<br><br>But it makes sense</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Memes</br>  <br>He can be good at it and has been shown to o so the problem is he literally doesn't care so he doesn't even try.</br>  <br>Did she ever create "problem" to another person because her stupidity in the story?<br>If she did, then show me the line from Ln that implied it.<br>If she didn't then why you even bother about it.</br></br></br>  <br> Yui <br> Flirting <br><br> Yuigahama, groaning as she was thinking, lifted her face in light of something and popped opened her gripped hands. <br><br> “Take this!

Umi is always shown hanging around Eli instead of Nozomi and Nico has this sort of derpy look to her instead of the whole jealous troll thing going on. Nozomi just seems like this clumsy oaf rather than spiritual leader of the group. In any case if I had to pick a voice that just does not seem to match a character most it would be hers. Too high pitched somehow. Some people also insist that they changed up how Hanayo was supposed to sound at some point but can't confirm that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>People need to stand up to Umi's tyranny more. I'm sure if they all banded together they could maybe overcome her....maybe.

Seeing it in video really shows how derpy they all looked though, especially Nico, Hanayo and Rin.

But overall they are all cute.</br>  Honk  <br>It's technically correct.</br>  <br>Эри</br>  <br>Nope, it's correct just for FFFs who don't even know how to info.</br>  <br>It's not wrong, but it's not right.</br>  <br>shut up shirou</br>  <br>It's Eli on SIF cards, it's Eli when it comes to School idol diary (which has been provided in this thread), it's Eli in the lives presentation, it's Eli even on the gadgets.</br>  <br>And the same goes for people who write Niko instead of Nico.</br>  <br> Nope <br><br>There is no nope. Eri is not wrong since it's the correct romanization for 里. It's retarded to throw shit around, neither of them are wrong since Eli makes more sense for "our" language.<br><br>Also, technically there is no romanized li so this is just an idiotic conversation. Japan doesn't have to worry about this either way so it makes no sense to get upset just because someone is using Eri.</br></br></br></br></br>  Honk...Eli<br>Eli honking Honk<br>HonoEli</br></br>  <br>When the creators have romanized it as li, then it's li. This shouldn't require any further discussion.</br>  <br>No you're right, the romanized version is li because it makes more sense for our language. There still isn't anything wrong with saying Eri though. I use Eli as well but I don't get upset when people use Eri.</br>  <br> technically there is no romanized li <br>Waterfall (Takano Saku) is japanese and writes "Eli" on doujin covers.<br>Then, since it's no problem, ルイズ・フランソワーズ・ル・ブラン・ド・ラ・ヴァリエール is Ruizu furansowasu ru buran do ra vaieru is the correct name because it's the "correct romanization"?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, and since we have to follows kanji this much, I guess you could even call her Esato. And Honoka could be Hoosamuhate with no problems.</br>  <br>The kanji can be read like that yes. But we all know that is not the correct way to read their names.</br>  <br><br><br>You're right, it would be stupid to go with that but this is different since we're talking about a name. One that has the special l/r relation for romaji. Again, there is nothing wrong with saying Eri. You should be going with Eli since it's obviously the one that makes sense and like<br>said the one that the creator wants. There is still nothing wrong with Eri though.<br><br>And the Kanji example is retarded since the reading for her name is always the same. It's supposed to be a romanized ri. What you said is simply not the correct way of reading the Kanji.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get that there's nothing wrong with Eri, but some people don't even know that the creator wants it to be Eli.</br>  <br>Well those people are idiotic and shouldn't be talked to either way. All I'm saying is that there is no reason to be upset if someone uses Eri. It's kind of hipster considering the god damn system of the language that we use but whatever.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care when people say Eri, it's just kind of obnoxious when people (like MAL) commit to it and say it's right over anything else.<br>Then again it's fucking MAL and this argument has gone on 15 posts longer than it should have.</br></br>  <br>m8 it's pretty deep if you can't see the nigger's body in the water.</br>  All that matters is  the "Singer" really voiced by Minami Takayama?   <br>No.</br>  <br>Is this a joke or did you actually spot a different name in the credits?</br>  <br>Who is this singer you speak of?</br>  <br> Now now, that'd be telling you a crucial part of the movie.

It's impossible to filter out furshit since they never use consistent tags.</br></br>  <br>Complete with shit typesetting!</br>  Western shit sucks ass because they upload 1-2 pages a fucking year and then just quit. They can't seem to, you know, make a full fucking doujin like nips do every year.<br><br>God western porn fucking SUCKS</br></br>  <br>The doujinshi paradigm exists because it's commercially viable. The western market (besides furry) isn't.</br>  <br>Just check Doujin, Manga, Artist and Game CG and you're set.</br>  <br>Many artists draw doujinshi for fun, not for profit.</br>    <br><br>Western porn just absolutely sucks<br><br>Drawn western porn is basically non-existent horribly, horribly awful on the levels of sonic the hedgehog porn because the porn "market" in the west is mostly limited to 3DPD porn in the shittiest porn video hosts you can think of.<br><br>Japan somehow mastered the art of making actually good drawn porn and most do it for fun or as a hobby while some people can make some money off it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet the average doujinshi as a whole is leagues better than the average american cartoon porn</br>  <br><br>porn games too, the west has none except some unfinished patreon garbage, while japan has a whole industry for it</br></br>  <br> avg <br><br>That's because their is more doujin made than western. Have you been to comiket, there is a lot of shit that doesn't get uploaded.</br></br></br>  <br>True but profit aside just making some money to recoup the time/money invested is also better.</br>  Is there a way to search whilst ignoring certain tags? Like say I want to look for Loli, but don't want any rape or dilf's is there a way to find only doujins/manga without those tags but retaining the loli tag?  <br>And its literally garbage.<br><br>Porn games in the west are usually unfinished trash with god awful art that either consist of someone doing it for "fun" or someone trying to suck money out of people with a patreon/kickstarter or a blog and a "PLEASE DONATE" button or a product that will never be finished or forever stuck in the development phase.<br><br>Its the same for VNs, all the visual novels the west has made trying to imitate japan belong in the trash and are usually just parody shit because its the easiest thing to do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You put a - sign in front of the tag you don't want</br>  <br>Wow, I feel stupid.</br>  <br> don't want any rape or dilf <br>But then how do I self insert.</br></br>   I liked the one about the dude sexually corrupting his femnazi little sister. Japan ain't gonna write a story like that.    cartoons <br> has 5x to 10x the budget of an average anime <br> -all- animation outsourced to koreans or canadian flash farms <br> no interesting or special animation cuts <br> no hand painted backgrounds <br> no class act soundtracks <br> no real plot, lasting character development, directing, or choreography <br><br>Get it together, western developers<br><br><br>Are you new to the internet<br><br><br>Doujins are for self inserting as the girl, stupid<br><br><br>Because feminazis don't exist in japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are many fetishes out there anon. Panda just tries to cater to as many as possible.</br>  <br>The Spongebob Squarepants movie was pretty good</br>  some shit they have on there is legit pretty rare like the benson books, I tried buying those shit on ebay since there are no more online rips and the price is crazy   mfw I find a Korean    not fapping to both east and west   <br>Gravity Falls is alright.</br>  <br> Shit tier west gets a free ride and spammed <br> artists like akabur or John persons gets expunged <br>fuck western shit</br></br></br>   go on pixiv <br> see hundreds of artists put out dozens of short hentai manga and sequences <br> western pornfag puts something out <br> DONATE PLS DONATE DONATE PATREON DONATE DONATE <br> takes 3 years to finish one sequence <br><br>The west should just abandon colouring, it's holding them back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was Steven Universe purposely left out?<br><br><br>When does it start back? The 14th? <br>I thought it always aired on a Monday though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not bad and at least Disney does do some of their own animation for some of the more important sequences, but they're nothing special. <br><br>I just think it's funny that they always have WAY more budget but don't actually look it, even if they have more frames. Evangelion was made for 60,000 an episode, while a handdrawn cartoon of the same length would cost 1 million.<br><br><br><br>Expect endless repeated hiatuses every 2 episodes and everybody is left confused and wonders if it's cancelled or not, another irritating thing about western cartoons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The west should just abandon colouring, it's holding them back. <br>I sort of agree but colouring doesn't seem to hold the koreans back that much tbh</br></br>  I know this isn't a proper sadpanda thread, but since it's related I'm posting it here anyway as I don't know when I'll be around for an actual thread.<br><br>[Hamao] Let's Do Something Nice!

And she makes squeaking noises in the drawing song.</br>  <br>Good taste, they don't get enough love.</br>  <br>I like Meru, her character concept is pretty unique and she has some of my favorite skits with her dad.<br><br>Also, yes, the squeaks. They're too cute. Almost make me forget what a bitch she really is.</br></br></br>  Esdese was the only reason for me to read that crap.  Esdeath thighs were the only reason to read and watch this crap.  <br> thighs <br>I liked her danger breasts more in the anime.</br></br></blockquote>]
