[  Precure Thread   Looks like we won't be attracting anyone new with that OP pic.  Twilight voice:<br><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435102926569.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143510292656<wbr>9.webm</wbr></a></br>  I'm going to marry Haruharu!   My 2ds has a cfw now <br>Any good precure games for 3ds?<br>The only played was that Futariwa beat up.</br></br>  <br> calls herself a princess <br> wears the mask <br> is evil but not really <br> same VA </br></br></br></br>  I love Kirara.  <br> You did it, Miki-tan. Truly, you have become a Perfect Blue. </br>  <br> How long did it take you? <br> I have only seen 15 episodes since two month ago. <br>I started downloading Futari Wa Precure 29th of May.<br>So it took me less than a month to finish both season 1+2 combined.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ww@ camilabros</br>  <br>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU</br>  <br> Perfect Blue </br>  <br>I want to fuck Opal.</br>      <br>Did you marry HaruHaru?</br>  <br>Nah, just enjoying some Doremi over here, and posting some images as I go. I wish anon luck though. HaruHaru a cute.</br>    <br>Fucking lewd<br> TFW no Precure rubing game </br></br>        Help I am not good with webms    <br>It would be more practical to just post a Youtube video.</br>  <br>for a minute and a half that's not really too bad. I don't think anyone really expects you to squeeze an entire henshin sequence into a 3mb webm and make it look perfect. That 1 extra MB if you were to go post it on /wsg/ instead makes a pretty big difference though.</br>                At this rate, we'll hit image limit long before ded thread.  <br>Episode's almost over. There was lots of cute Onpu that definitely needed to be posted though.</br>  Great Onpu episode. Very satisfying to see her learning that little lesson. I always thought she tried too hard to be a pro instead of just being a kid.    21話よろしくお願いします。 <br>Sounds like we'll be getting a lot of Itaoka.</br>  <br><br>I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought Onpu didn't act like a human child most of the time.</br></br>  <br>  Any good precure games for 3ds? <br>This one is good.</br></br>  <br>She totally didn't. She tried to hard to act like a mature professional instead and it was weird. Seeing her being all cute and having fun this episode was great. It was kind of like that one episode when Hana stood in for her without permission as the photo shoot, only it was actually Onpu letting herself be a kid this time.</br>  <br>Did he just pull her butt wings off?</br>  <br>GoPri game comes out next month I think. I'm getting it so I'll make sure to tell /pc/ about it.</br>  I started watching this ARIA thing by Doremi director Satou Junichi.<br><br>I'm sure Anonymous knows this, but it's great and well worth a watch.</br></br>  https://twitter.com/haimanji/status<wbr>/614849957133025281<br><br>いいぞ（R18注意）</br></br></wbr>    <br> You acquired "Princess Dress" </br>  <br>On the backlog for years. I always have trouble starting up a comfy SoL series. First few episodes are always so boring but then you start to love them after a while and you're stuck.</br>  I want to pafu Pafu's pafus.  <br><br>And I want to roma Aroma's roma, but we can't all have the things we want in life.</br></br>  <br>You can't marathon Aria you have to take it easy and watch an episode every few weeks or so or when you feel like watching something relaxing.</br>  <br><br> swimming in money like Scrooge McDuck <br><br>Woo-hoo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Doki game had a lot of cute outfits, I hope the GoPri game will too.</br>  Pandering.  <br> Kumojacky <br> Kaoru <br> Oresky <br> Syrup <br>I want them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wheres Bumbee?</br>  <br><br>And Scorp</br></br>  <br><br>I want Oresky, Pop, and Kaoru-chan.</br></br>  <br> Shut <br>Oh god, whyboner.</br></br>  <br> No Wolfeun <br>Wut?</br></br>  <br> Those Minamis on Minami </br>  <br><br>I think those two were in the first set. The pic posted is for the upcoming second set.</br></br>  <br>Why are there 2 Karens?</br>  <br> Oresky </br>  I saw this and thought of you /pc/  <br>I want 2 Karens for myself.</br>  <br><br>Thank you for reminding me. I forgot about it because chapter 21 came months ago.</br></br>  <br>I really tried liking this, but I couldn't.</br>  <br>Sadly the story has been way more about Yurithings rather than Prepurethings in the raws. I'm totes excited for the drama CD, still though.</br>  <br>How far did you get and what didn't you like?</br>  <br><br> way more about Yurithings rather than Prepurethings in the raws <br><br>Well, the Prepure thing is more of a gateway for Akina to become involved in otaku shit, so I don't mind that it's only occasional.</br></br></br></br>  SOIYA<br><br>YEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH</br></br>  <br>I read a decent amount, I can't really remember now, but I lost interest because of the yuri. I was only really reading it because of not!Precure everything else was just kind of eh.</br>  <br>I got into Shinozaki because my friend was like "What if there was a game that crossed PreCure and Monster Hunter?" I love all the otaku and BL stuff, and the yuri is fine when it leads to that.<br><br>Though, I did enjoy the chapter from the pov of the girl who likes Akina like Akina likes Kaede.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough. We're the same there at least.</br>  <br><br>Unfortunately yeah, there's only so many jokes about precure you can make. That said, the drama CD did reveal what the parody of Go Princess PreCure would be called. <br><br>It seems to be Lady Go! PrePure.</br></br></br></br>  We're getting an episode today, right?  <br><br> Lady Go! PrePure. <br><br>Jeez. That sounds like an unfortunate mix of Jewelpet and Precure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares.</br>  <br><br>It's going to be some hot shit, but I'm already worried about the third cour.</br></br>  <br>The song is pretty unfortunate.</br>  <br> I Don't Remember <br>A bit lame, isn't it?</br></br>  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/HueRuIQT_do  [ ]<br><br>Still better than the DokiDoki theme song.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dokidoki wasn't that bad. Though, that and Hapuri are nowhere near as good as HC, Suite, Smile or GoPri's OPs.</br>  If you force cast-off the Megahouse Cure Muse figure she has a camel-toe.  <br>Well this was a convenient page that I just got to.</br>  <br>Early Mako is a bit of a creep, but he's still a good brother towards Akina.</br>  <br><br>Early Mako is basically /prc/</br></br>  Daily Minamin!!  <br>China?</br>  <br>Has Minamin had her monthly yet?</br>  <br>With those minamins of hers, I'd expect so</br>  <br>???</br>  <br>Doumo Beauty-san, Precure Hunter desu.</br>  <br>That's /bll/</br>  <br>People's Republic of China. Sorry, I was making a bad joke.</br>     Towa Civ form <br>Yes I know Tumblr sucks and all that but I was stumbled upon it while looking for some dub reggae precure thing someone did on soundcloud a while ago.<br>I need it for reasons.</br></br>  <br>I like it. She looks like a princess.</br>  <br>She's beautiful. I like it more than Twilight's design. And that smug look on her face.<br>I'm in love.</br></br>  <br>I like it, she looks quite in that picture</br>  <br><br>You know, that doesn't look so bad. There's hope after all.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>What's with all the shills?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have a reply</br>  <br>Get your shit stained ass back to /v/, please.</br>  <br><br> he doesn't have hope for Man </br></br>  <br>I like that Towa, it seems her civil form is the best out of the four.</br>  <br>She looks like she stumbled in from a different show.</br>  Maybe Tumblr isn't so bad after all now that I'm stumbling around.<br>What are these things anyway?<br>Some Trading Card thing?<br>Are they official?<br><br>Why the fuck would Toei shill to a bunch of gaijin big friends?<br>They have to jump through hoops to buy their stuff at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also here's where I got that Towa thing.<br>http://goprincesspc.tumblr.com/post<wbr>/122583183343<br>Really I'm curious who the is that Orange Cure on this page.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>They're official trading cards that come out for every season. And yeah tumblr's cool, not the best thing in the world but better than this elitist shithole at least.</br>  <br>Movie only chara</br>  <br>New movie character.</br>  <br>The orange cure and the pink cure with red hair are from that game with the 6 candy kingdoms or whatever, I think.</br>  <br><br>Ah okay.</br></br>  <br><br>Cards like that are official, trading card things are like that. Tumblr isn't bad if you stay away from all retards, which is about 96.4% of the site.<br><br><br><br> better than this elitist shithole at least <br><br>Hardly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, doc!</br></br>  <br>Isn't this the 3 princess in the 3ds game?</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be Yui?<br>She looks awful.</br></br>  <br>This makes me laugh. Remember when some of you were up in arms defending that Towa would be a small kid because "muh time stops when I go evil theory" and "they have only showed us her child form!"? I sure hope those were all just very organized shitposters because I couldn't believe someone really though that would happen.</br>  <br><br> very organized shitposter <br><br>I think that kind of stuff was actually rare. The one I heard the most was "She's Ace 2.0 to she's shit." which isn't really shitposting as opposed to a very heated opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lolitards are incapable of logic.</br>  Aguri owned  <br>Those were the posts in relation to her Cure form that we've had since the first leak. What I'm talking about is after last episode's airing -- there were quite a few posts defending that, because of the flashbacks shown, she would be retaining the same age. Lots of stupid theories and senseless arguments were supported by what looked like a (at least vocal) majority.</br>  Which precure season has had the most pandering?     mfw /m/'s SHT thread is even more ded than us   <br>Is it even up?</br>  <br>Use the catalog.</br>  <br><br>They all shitpost on the stream instead of on the thread.</br></br>  That was a really odd moment to hop into the SHT stream. I'm not really sure but it seems like they made an episode out of Ez and his love of lawnmowers?  <br>Drive is boring and Ninnin is full of Takaharu. Why watch SHT except for precure any more?</br>  <br>Drive is good now, though.</br>  <br>Maybe I'll catch up some time but temporary brainwashed Gou just sapped the last bit of care I had.</br>  <br>Anon. Catch up now.</br>  <br>The constant brainwashing in Drive is the worst thing about it<br> BRAINWASHING <br> Next ep, lol I was just pretending </br></br></br>  <br/>    <br>Thats pretty lame. I mean, it's lame either way.</br>  Are the streams gonna be working again anytime soon?  <br> Not watching Drive with everyone else. <br><br>Why aren't you watching it with all of us.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I am, and I got it working again</br></br>  <br>There is but without sound.</br>    I kind of don't get that neetball thing. He is streaming but not precure? why?  <br>Check the little button at the side of the páuse botton.</br>  <br>I'm cliclikng it but it does nothing</br>  <br>I have same problem. I tried every web explorer, now I'm trying proxy</br>  <br>Sucks to be you then.<br>Have a cute Yayoi as consolation.</br></br>  <br>this is my favorite yayoi picture</br>  KONO ATO SUGU  KONO<br>ATO<br>SUGU</br></br>  KONO ATO SUGU<br>O<br>N<br>O<br><br>A<br>T<br>O<br><br>S<br>U<br>G<br>U</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  KONO ATO SUGU  Some people are too retarded to manually operate the mute button and volume slider.  KONO ATO SUGU  him again  Shit, streamup doesn't work for me. Is there another stream?  is  sherming not working?   KONO ATO SUGU!  <br>Try Chrome.</br>  shut up guys and pay attention to the show  <br>That worked, thanks.</br>   considering watching the raw tomorrow instead of a loading screen for ~20 minutes <br> but if I do it I'll have to leave the thread to not be spoiled </br>  where the fuck is neetball  <br>It doesn't work for me. Not sure why.</br>  I can't wait for the OP to change to "The four of us are aiming to be true princesses".  That henshin is still really cool  <br>How? It's unwatchable. The audio keeps skipping and when that's not happening, the video is buffering.</br>  <br>Dead for about a month now.</br>  <br>He streamed plastic memories but is not streaming precure. Fucking traitor</br>  <br>Aw fuck it. see you guys tomorrow</br>  <br>And now it's bugging me to register.<br>Fuck this stream.</br></br>  <br>lower your expectations</br>  Here we go with suteki na Lady again.

Oh look, it was brainwashing<br><br>who coulda guessed.</br></br>  Flora is super lovely  <br>hologram</br>  <br>She's a big mama.</br>  <br>Well now I feel dumb.</br>  muda something something zetsubou  <br>For you.</br>  Nice job, Puff.

RIP Kanata's heart seed. Will he be the final boss now?  Oh damn, the episode ended without showing the key screen.  <br>I have no idea about that.</br>  Oh, I get it. They made Kanata look girly for the tentacle rape doujins.  So Kanata will be the new general?  Kanata no!  Goodnight sweet prince.  <br>His soul gem staff broke so most likely.</br>  Good episode, except for the faces.  Spring Carnival soon?    <br>except for the shitty stream</br>  <br>What is Ace doing there</br>    HA  Lookin super scary Dyspear   Haruka and Towa role reversal <br> Dypear immediately tries to get Twilight back <br> Sleeps in Yui's bed <br> Cure Scarlet <br>Next episode looks fucking awesome</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's like poetry<br><br>it rhymes</br></br></br>  <br>Being a  best girl . Again.</br>    <br> Towa is even smaller that HauHaru </br>    <br>Bad touch.</br>  <br> liking ace <br/></br>  <br>She wasn't satisfied with only shitting up dokidoki.</br>  <br>More proof that Yui is the princess, not Haru.</br>  Don't forget the best of all:<br><br> Precure Suffering </br></br>  <br>you know that Haru is standing on something so why you are making those stupid implications?</br>  <br> Sleeps in Yui's bed <br>WIll Yui be jealous over Towa's relationship with Haruka?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Fuck Missed the preview because of the stream being too late. How was it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>H-Haruka's on a hill, that's all!</br>  <br>ZETSUBOU</br>  <br><br>She's just standing on a chair.</br></br>  <br>Nah, Yui doesn't have emotions. She exist just to fill empty space and now that space is not empty.</br>  <br> Sleeps in Yui's bed <br> Twilight was just the ghost of Towa's body <br> Yui was Towa's body <br> The moment the brainwash was broken the body was magically teleported the spirit's location <br> Yui gets effectively erased out of existence and Towa takes her place <br> Nobody at school aside the Cures notices any difference </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I also liked how Towa meeting Dyspear was mirrored with Haruka meeting Kanata.</br>  We Setsuna now?  <br>http://asahi.co.jp/precure/princess<wbr>/story/</wbr></br>  <br>Next week will be amazing.</br>  <br><br>I sure hope so.<br><br>I hope this eats away at her and she has to be healed very slowly and tenderly. <br><br>none of this "Oh I was brainwashed, but now I'm all better!".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dyspear trying to hug her daughter back to evil </br>  <br>Next Episode looks Hype!</br>  <br>Phantom.<br><br>Phantom was the worst<br><br> Oh I was a genocidal asshole that really did want to kill all cures, personally if I had to. But now I'm yuuko's fuccboi. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Forget the brainwashing. Her onii-sama be ded. He was pretty based too. And pretty.</br></br>  <br><br>It will all be resolved within next episode.</br></br>  <br>Erika tier womanlet.</br>  <br>He was basically your classic "devote your life to following a single person no matter what they say" meta-villain, so technically the blame was on Mirage and therefore Red. He also got off because he was a fairy, so that's like double the loyalty.</br>  I think the shitty stream is what killing these threads lately  <br>nothing personnel, cures</br>  <br>They're on a hill, just like the first time that they met.</br>  <br>It could be worse like /ai/ and have no streams at all.</br>  <br>Seriously.<br><br>Streamup is pure cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to lick Towa's shoulder blades.</br>  <br>A better stream won't make GoPri not shit.</br>  which kill would you la kill for?  the one with the red  Rags fan here. Fuck Tampa.  I have to admit I never liked Satsuki. She acted like a bitch the whole way through.  Nonon  <br>She was just a sison.</br>  she just wanted her baby sister  <br> which kill would you la kill for? <br>Best girl and waifu, Ryuko.</br></br>  <br> Tampa </br>  <br> MFW <br>How does this work?</br></br>  <br> tough fighter tomboy type <br> down-to-earth, knows when to cut her losses and run but isn't any coward <br> pragmatic and has a sense of decency <br><br>The thing I hated most about the show was her damn battle outfit. She looked a lot better in her regular school outfit. It was far less obnoxious, and she didn't need slutifying to be interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing I hated most about the show was her damn battle outfit. She looked a lot better in her regular school outfit. It was far less obnoxious, and she didn't need slutifying to be interesting. <br>So I am not the only one that thinks this.</br></br>  I hated this bitch so much. But at the same time her creepiness and always smiling turned me on   satsuki not being toronto maple laffs   Are you implying that Satuski loses?  <br><br>Not in the least. She's devastatingly cute in her normal outfit, when she's being her normal spunky self.</br></br>  <br>Nui is like a xenomorph. Creepy but then annoying. Far as I know she doesn't reproduce through face rape but I think Disco Mom would give her a gold star for effort.</br>  <br>I would literally murder a person for him to be real.</br>  satsuki is so fucking hot i want her to finger my belly button  <br> I would literally murder a person for him to be real. <br>I don't think he'd fly for that depending on the circumstances. <br><br> satsuki is so fucking hot i want her to finger my belly button <br><br> finger my belly button <br> MFW </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. Even if he hates me and I have to spend the rest of my life in prison, I just want him to be real.</br>  <br>The straight one.<br><br>Oh wait</br></br></br>  Tampa bay all the way  <br> I know. Even if he hates me and I have to spend the rest of my life in prison, I just want him to be real. <br>Just do it in the name of Satsuki. He'll understand.<br><br> The straight one. <br> Oh wait <br>One of them have to be. The one that is less likely to go lesbian because Disco Mom's rape and abuse caused mental scarring.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure theres probably a gamagoori walking around in japan<br><br>you're gonna need to ask him to blond his hair though</br></br></br>  The Red Girl.<br><br><br> rags </br></br></br>  I just want to ruffle her hair up. Even when it gets fluffy.  <br> Tampa Bay </br>  <br><br>Kill? They're not worth it. I would rape them, though.</br></br>  I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass.   /a/ giving a shit about sports. <br>Only the dead can know peace from this normal faggotry.</br>  <br> Kill? They're not worth it. I would rape them, though. <br>Disco Mom, what are you doing on 4chan?<br><br> I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass. <br>She seems like the type to enjoy that. Pic related and sorry for the mess. I'm an idiot like that.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>you're new as fuck m8</br>  <br><br> mention to Satsuki you want four children <br> suddenly she's pregnant nearly every day for the rest of her life and you have almost 100 children with giant eyebrows like hers who all feud with each other for position in the Kiryuin hierarchy and their mom's affection </br></br></br>  <br>She's a fan of the Detroit Red Wings</br>  <br>I think Ragyo would at least get a pick out of her grandchildren. <br> you have almost 100 children with giant eyebrows like hers who all feud with each other for position in the Kiryuin hierarchy and their mom's affection <br>I'd watch that oddly enough.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I AM AN IDENTIFYING MARK </br></br>    <br>Kek. Why is my internet going crazy?</br>     be Quebecker <br> hate hockey <br>I'm not a normie</br></br>  <br>nice, my favorite team<br><br>i'm gonna need someone to draw this up for me</br></br></br>  <br><br>So basically Kill la Kill meets Dallas.<br><br> Milf Satsuki  <br> groups of her children rally around her old lieutenants and Ryuuko for guidance and training </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Quebec <br><br>Fuck off faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure this can not end horribly.</br>  <br>Lightning</br>  <br><br>You don't want dozens of Satsuki's children being trained by Gamagoori in the ways of the Head of the Disciplinary Committee?</br></br>  <br>i feel like hockey is the only acceptable sport.<br><br>but i'm not from Canada so that could completely change my perspective, being surrounded by it and awful people talking about it constantly.<br><br>i would love a hockey anime for the record.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that. Let's see how that would go.</br>    How fast would Satsuki kill me if I broke one of these? How is she going to know? I'm not sure why there isn't one for dating Satsuki but that would involve signing a contract with Ragyo and probably babysitting Nui. Is it strange that I think Disco MILF would try her hand eugenics if Satsuki had the life fiber parts like Ryuko? Just one woman's goal to find someone that is highly resistant to life fibers and have them get her daughter pregnant.  <br>I'm thinking like this. I can imagedump the rest of them if anyone wants them.</br>    <br>I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass and then feed my dick to Ryuuko</br>  <br>I can't post the rest because my computer is having issues.<br> Hey, Anon, could you possibly help me with my plan to create a master race by getting my daughter pregnant?  <br>That's how I see the whole situation. <br><br> I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass and then feed my dick to Ryuuko <br> MFW <br>That's lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Tampa <br> not Rags <br><br>Better dead than Red, I guess.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12723656   could I join?   <br><br>This can only be stopped in one fell swoop.<br><br> After everyone else of the original group dies off Ryuko goes insane and makes the Kiryuin clan Highlander each other to decide the dominant heir left standing, she kneels to let the last student become the master, proceeds to have severed head start manacle laughter ala Ragyo as it reattaches to disappear and haunt and strengthen the family for generations as she cant die due to the loss of life fiber blades. Centuries of the family line are considered cursed by the woman in red until she gets bored and one day shows up on the couch like its completely normal and proceeds to live an average life as a freeloader in the estate. Teaches the current head of the family lineage how to kill the life fiber core that landed as all reference of fibers were taken by Inu to the grave when his hard drives thermite bombed themselves as his heart stopped. Proceeds to guides this poor sole into becoming life fiber Batman.

I'm just picturing Satsuki and the father just looking at this mess and wondering what went wrong.</br>  <br>Surprisingly this has something to do with that. Again, sorry for the mess.

This combination can only end well in the long run as her mind turns into a self contained hive if they take root. <br> MFW best girl goes even battier than when she wore Junketsu. <br>I think in that case Ryuko would probably need mercy killing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Incest makes it even better though</br></br>  <br>Satsuki is best girl but fuck Tampa.</br>  <br> Incest makes it even better though <br>How? That would probably cause memories of Ragyo's abuse to show up and Satsuki at least has a minefield of a psyche. That would be a rather messy explosion.</br></br>  Fuck blackkawks<br>Fuck Lightning</br>  <br> TFW she has the only means and ability to kill hybrids left. <br><br>At that point the only thing that probably could kill her is herself, unless someone realized the potential and made a contingency for it.</br></br></br>  anyone have the episode reactions/thread reactions?  <br>I'm with this anon</br>  <br><br>But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma.</br></br>  I'd rather stick my peter in some blue boipussi  <br> At that point the only thing that probably could kill her is herself, unless someone realized the potential and made a contingency for it. <br>Didn't Nudist Beach have some sort of bullet for something like this? Or go fishing for the scissor blades. I'm picturing Ryuko telling Satsuki to stop having kids before it got to the point it is now. At least around the tenth or fiftieth. <br><br> But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma. <br>At rationalize what their mother did to them. Chances that Satsuki would molest her own child do not look good in her favor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br> Tsumugu Kinagase has himself frozen in secret by Nudist beach splinter operatives that refuse to rest until all life fibers are destroyed.

There's positivity in embracing that which isn't accepted by societal norms. This includes sexuality, which was presented through their battle outfits.<br><br>Before you say "hurr it's just fanservice" - it's both. Senketsu and Junketsu being revealing are both for audience titillation AND as part of the series core themes. <br><br>Saying "They didn't need slutifying" is quite possibly the biggest way to miss the point of the entire show I can imagine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mostly true, but at the same time, I wish they'd picked a different theme than nudity and exposure (of your heart etc).<br><br>But no, sexuality isn't embraced in KlK. It's absolutely vilified. Only Ragyo, Nui, and Junketsu Ryuko ever display sexuality.<br><br>The show is not about the sexual aspects of nudity, and it uses the absolutely intolerable antagonists to marginalize it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a picture from the the drawfag threads a few years back of a character in a Canucks jersey</br>  <br>I'll admit that sexuality probably wasn't the best word - I was referring to nudity and exposure and should have used those words. My original point stands though. The exposure of Ryuko through Senketsus battle form is integral to the shows themes and her development as a character.<br><br>Wishing they'd picked a different theme means wishing it'd be a different show. KLKs use of nudity and sexuality is very much part of what I love about Imaishi and Triggers work in general, and a significant part of why KLK is one of my favourites.</br></br></br>  <br>KlK is my second favorite, and would have knocked TTGL off of #1 if the ending hadn't been so intolerable.<br><br>Nevertheless, I do wish it had been a different show. <br><br>You're not taking Imaishi or Nakashima or Sushio off the project, so the result would have been outstanding regardless, and an immense part of what made it great was the characters, who all would have functioned perfectly fine without the kamui being what they were. Ryuko is part of my soul and I wish Trigger hadn't decided they should work fanservice into the thematics just in case the show couldn't stand on the strength of its writing and character design. <br><br>It could have, it would have, and I suspect it would be doing even better in the west than it already is if not for the costume absurdity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Does anyone have that pic of Mako standing on the top of Honnouji tower, making fun of Satsuki?  <br>Could Imaishi and Trigger have written and designed a story like Kill la Kill without nudity? Probably, I don't doubt that it would also be great. <br><br>I would probably like it a ton, much like I like Little Witch Academia (I know that's not Imaishi but you get my point). But it would not be Kill la Kill.<br><br> I wish Trigger hadn't decided they should work fanservice into the thematics just in case the show couldn't stand on the strength of its writing and character design. <br>That's an absurd statement to make, to the point that I'm a little bothered you'd make it. <br><br>The idea that they worked fanservice into the series as a safety net in case the show couldn't stand up otherwise makes absolutely no sense in the context of Imaishi's works in general. Sex, nudity and extremity is central to almost everything Imaishi has directed, everything from Dead Leaves to Sex and Violence with Machspeed. Kill la Kill is much like all of Imaishis works in that regard, but beyond that, is the one that makes them the most central and important to its concept.<br><br> It could have, it would have, and I suspect it would be doing even better in the west than it already is if not for the costume absurdity <br>I'd rather they not undermine a core aspect of the shows theming and a design element that Imaishi celebrates significantly in his works, for the sake of more popularity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's the Raoh to pwirry's Kenshiro.</br>  <br> Sexuality isn't vilified, excessive sexuality and absolute dominance is. Relationships are meant to be a balance, the give and take of two people in equilibrium, you'd know that if you paid any attention to Ryuko and that absurd pointless costume.</br>  <br> makes absolutely no sense in the context of Imaishi's works in general. <br> What is Gurren Lagann <br> What is FLCL <br><br>Yoko existed almost solely to provide fanservice, but she was a (disappointingly) marginalized character and didn't reflect on the overall narrative. Meanwhile you have the two central characters (and almost every other character) stripped next to naked every episode in KlK. It was orders of magnitude beyond anything Imashi has ever done, and I'm vexed he decided to do it with KlK.<br><br>A year before KlK was announced I made a post in a "what would be your ideal anime " thread - my response was "A badass manly magical girl show by Gainax with Sawano composing."<br>Imagine my anticipation, and imagine my dismay when the hype threads degenerated into the transformed senketsu design posts being quoted 600 times.<br><br><br>The relationships weren't sexual in the least. Anon pls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  which kill la kill would be a devils fan?<br><br>someone has to like new jersey ;_;</br></br>  <br> no you don't get KLK <br> damn why did KLK go such a different direction, that was a dumb move <br><br>Anon, I don't mean to alarm you, but it just sounds like your saying you don't know what you're talking about and just inserting your fantasy show.</br></br></br></br>  I'm not saying the alternative is any worse. But there something about Ryuuko hot blood that turns me on.<br><br>I always loved angry bitches for some reason.</br></br>  <br> someone has to like new jersey ;_; </br>  <br>Imaishi had extremely minimal if any creative control with FLCL. He was an animation director, not an overall director, and that means he had little control over what was actually happening in the story or what themes the show used in general. He worked on FLCL, sure, but it has no bearing to this discussion at all.<br><br>Looking at the works where he actually had creative control (main Director position, namely) TTGL is the only one that doesn't use sex-related subjects heavily. It's the exception, not the rule. Dead Leaves, Panty and Stocking, Sex and Violence and Kill la Kill all use sex and related subjects a fuck ton. <br><br> It was orders of magnitude beyond anything Imashi has ever done <br>How are you able to say with a straight face that when Dead Leaves and Panty and Stocking exist? And Sex and Violence just happened recently too.<br><br>It sucks for you if you didn't like that people talked about the fanservice over whatever other aspects, but that's your issue and your issue alone. For me, and quite clearly based on Imaishi's works, for him and the staff working on Kill la Kill, the 'fanservice designs' are a core aspect of the entire series theming AND an element of design that Imaishi celebrates regularly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>orson dislikes philly<br><br>he has no issues with new jersey...except people who are eagles/phillies/flyers/76ers fans and live in jersey</br></br></br>  <br> youll enver form a happy family with ryuko or satsuki <br> not "&gt;you'll never form a happy family with ryuko AND satsuki </br></br>    <br>Our disagreements aside, it doesn't bother you that KlK discussions everywhere start and end with "lel fanservice xD"?<br><br>I've been avoiding KlK discussion for the past year because of that.<br><br><br>I drew that too ~</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm gonna marry Ryuko!  <br>You can't, she's not real.</br>    <br>I've never wanted a waifu, but if I did, it would be Satsuki.</br>  Funny enough, she actually had the best body.  <br> I'm sure theres probably a gamagoori walking around in japan <br>With a Mako and 4 animelets @ home</br></br>  <br>At the end of the day, fanservice is part of Kill la Kill, and a part that Imaishi and Trigger embrace and celebrate. If that's what people discuss a lot then I don't take much issue with it. It's fairly standard that the most immediately recognisable aspect of a work is often a major discussion point. I'd say the fact we've even had this discussion shows that discussion of the series is better than you give it credit for. I've had good, healthy KLK discussion on /a/ before now too.<br><br>Trust me, it could be worse.  I recently finished a game called Witch and the Hundred Knight and loved it, only to find discussing it to be near impossible because every time it gets brought up, the discussion turns into complaints about the localization company. Without fail. <br><br>Regardless, I should point out you have fantastic taste because Ryuko is love.

I know a lot of people like Gama/Mako but I kinda got the impression he was at least a little in love with Satsuki.

I'm not into tentacleshit or Senketsu or Satsuki being a bitch, so I deleted it the first time I saw it.<br><br>Then I gave it another chance and just looked at Ryuko and not what's happening to her and now I can't get enough of it. Zone actually drew her with canon proportions and pretty close to perfect expressions, which is pretty much unheard of. All the H stuff is cowtits garbage with dumb faces.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anybody have the picture of Ryuko as a baby with the back of her neck open when she was still being experimented on?</br>  <br> Pls, she's just being tsun. <br>Never thought she'd be like that.</br></br>  <br>This looks really painful</br>  <br>The fact that she was a baby when this happened doesn't help either.</br>   Anon, this was just too much.   <br>  six fingers </br>  Who the fuck does he think he is telling people how to live their lives correctly?<br><br> Misses most of his classes and is failing in school  <br> Doesn't even lift <br> Has no job and is broke as fuck <br> Always getting involved in fights outside instead of being a good student and studying at home </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's in middle school dude, cut him some slack. At least for not having a job and not lifting.</br>  He's saying this to a girl that declared war on science because she's mad about roller coasters and blood transfusions.<br><br>Touma's life may be a mess, but the people he ends up lecturing are usually completely batshit.</br></br>  Uh, is it me or is this guy designed exactly like Minami Ikki from Air Gear?  <br>Sounds like the typical anon to me!</br>  <br>The Motherfucking TouMAN of course</br>  <br>He's doing God's work, that's why. <br><br>You don't have to be a moral person to teach other people to be moral, especially when your fist does most of the talking.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a wannabe hero.</br>  <br>He's one of the worst MC around. <br>Any anon could probably beat him up since they don't have an ability to be canceled.</br></br>  When will we have a fucking season 3?  <br>I'm watching the second season now.<br>This anime is so fucking stupid it hurts.</br></br>  <br>I chuckled.<br><br><br> anons <br> beating anyone up </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He's one of the worst MC around. <br> Any anon could probably beat him up since they don't have an ability to be canceled. <br>Kihara Enshuu confirmed that it is not the case.<br>His thought pattern alone is quite a weapon against incorrectly living people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's going to be a sucessfull breeder alpha man. He don't need no school or education.</br>  <br> Misses most of his classes and is failing in school <br> not ditching classes to help people in need <br><br> Doesn't even lift <br> implying he need to lift when he's already capable of sending a 2 meters tall guy flying with one punch. <br><br> Has no job <br>But he does, AC pays students for taking part in the esper power curriculum. Everyone has an income.<br><br> broke as fuck <br>Blame it on the freeloader with a black hole inside her stomach. And since when being broke means not living life correctly?<br><br> Always getting involved in fights outside instead of being a good student and studying at home <br>It's not his fault that troubles and misfortunes always find their way to his life. AC is fucking tiny, one step outside and he'll run into either Brbr or suspicious magicians. DARKNESS is everywhere, his home house a walking treasure of magic knowledge, his neighbor is a fucking multi-organization spy, his daily activities are monitoring 24/7 by a freaky heretic floating upside down in his own piss.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Touma is a faggot, just like Shirou.  <br>This, the best guys drop out of schools.</br>  Why didn't he ride the Kongou Gundam?  <br>Shirou is way more manly than this faggot.</br>  <br> Touma doesn't need to lift <br><br> Got beaten up by skinny ass blonde twig </br></br></br>  <br>nope you got that the other way around kiddo<br><br> muh ideals <br> muh morals <br>break that illusion of your delusions</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aside from those fight against espers and magicians, Touma almost never lost to anyone in a typical street fight, he has showed to be confident to win in a 1 vs 3 situation. The only one who did stomp him was Tsuchimikado, but that guy's like Captain America of the Toaruverse.</br>  <br><br>Yet he ran away from the niggas who wanted to rape misaka. <br><br>Bet aogami would even reck his shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying normal high school student™ could do anything but run away from a dozen of opponent. <br>He was fine with 1 vs 3 tho.</br></br>  <br><br>He's in high school. Misaka is the middle schooler.</br></br>  <br><br>He wasn't trying to attack them, he was trying to save them by getting them to chase him instead.</br></br>  <br>ur stupid, nerd</br>  Best woman  <br> normal </br>  <br>He's still a faggot</br>  <br>I actually gained mad respect for Touma after learning that he makes his moralfag speeches on the spot to bullshit the villains, he's just a dude trying to deal with the crazy things that happen in his life. Unlike that faggot Shirou who actually believes in his nonsense but never does anything to back it up.</br>    <br>this<br><br>my brother died so i could live- SCIENCE MUST DIE!<br><br>i was dying with laughter at her stupid speech. Personally i wish Touma had beat her down harder then he did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep. Touma is just a normal highschool boy. Index is just a normal head crab cosplaying as a nun. Biribiri is just a normal oujo-sama; and accelerator is just a normal cripple.<br><br>PS: Touma is surrounded by more hot underaged pussy then a heterosexual male at a katy perry concert; and unlike said male, all that pussy wants him to fuck them.<br><br>If that's what life is like if you're a normal highschooler living your life correctly, i'm ready for Touma-sensei to teach me how to live my life correctly.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That sounds like a shitty excuse for weak niggas.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Kukaku as Rosy the Riveter with a wide smile on her face.</br>  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume.

If you want a specific outfit, a classy dress fashioned after her Astral Dress.  <br>maybe</br>  <br>super cute and soft! Love the colors and design on this. Appreciate the work laharl-anon, hope your weekend goes smoothly<br>I'll get there one day, hopefully I won't lose my way</br></br>   get free drawings <br> complain <br><br>If you can't be grateful for a low quality drawing what makes you think you deserve one from a more experienced drawfag? <br><br>I try not to believe in the summer effect but holy fuck this weekend is bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  Since I have plenty of pictures of my waifu in her frilled uniform and because I heard that her hair is a bit complex to draw, requesting her in an outfit of your choice and in a cute hairstyle that the drawfriend finds a bit easier. Long, straight hair is something she's done for example  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio, enjoying and dancing/playing Dance Dance Revolution.<br><br>For the outfit, you can draw her in her highschool uniform (in the ref picture) or in any casual clothes you want if you feel like it, as long as it's not vulgar/too lewd.<br><br>Anything cute would be good too.<br><br>Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  With the release of a new OVA, I'd like to request my angel Tachibana Kanade enjoying a picnic with anyone. These could be other waifus or characters from the Angel Beats! cast. The additional people are of course, entirely optional and up to the drawfriend; I'm aware that having multiple characters can be a pain. <br><br>Please have fun with this request! I just want a quaint little picnic. <br><br>As always, anything cool or cute of my angel is always welcome and much appreciated!</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you asked your neighbor for some sugar and he shat on your lawn would you thank him?</br>  <br>Free fertilizer!</br>  <br>That's not the same, though.</br>  <br>neither is getting a shitty delivery when you asked for something sweet</br>  <br>Why would you give someone a low quality drawing?</br>  Requesting waifus with dicks  <br>I would say is closer to asking for some sugar in public, and then having the one guy that gives you some lick it all before putting it in your cup. <br><br>It's just as bad though.</br></br></br>  <br>gross<br/></br>  Requesting Misha in a zipper bikini or the lingerie in the bottom-right corner or like a trucker with the hat too, please and thank you.<br>Additional references: http://imgur.com/a/CbSUD#0</br>  <br>What are some husbandos that want a big dick on their cute loli waifu?</br>  Could I request ghost girl Kanoe Yuuko as a Ghostbuster?<br><br> Bonus points for any gratuitous Bill Murray inclusions... </br></br>  Hello everyone!, requesting Reimu wearing a bikini, maybe like the Asuna's one with that hawaiian style, or like Miku enjoying a drink on the sea, or like Hibiki with a flower in her head, you can choose the one you like it more for my dear Reimu, please and thank you in advance  <br><br>you missed this</br></br>  <br/>  would you let your waifu put her dick in your ass?  <br>I know for a fact that  is ok with futa. Big futa.</br>  ok fourth thread of the weekend everybody<br>ill be requesting the usual Template character insert<br>Requesting Diego Brando as the guy on the right (with facial cracks and mouth tearing with bandaid/patch over the mouth tear) and the end of the "dick" not being a human face but a velociraptor head instead (with DIO pattern on the side of the ..."shaft")<br> that felt weird to type out <br>thanks and remember to take it easy guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off haremfag.</br></br></br>  <br>If anything I'd want a cute little dick on my waifu with a little red ribbon tired into the tip.</br>  <br><br>That is not a correct analogy at all.<br><br>A more correct analogy would be if you asked a neighbor for some milk and he gave you coffee creamer.<br><br><br>Its probably the best that person is able. At least that person is drawing. More than get be said for most people.<br><br>You get what you get. If you don't like it, leave.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this place was suppose to be fun for all drawing skill levels  <br>I'll remember that next time I open MSPaint and decide to be a sack of shit. And hey if you don't like it, too bad you don't get to request, why don't you leave instead? At least I'm contributing with my scribbles.</br>  Request anything cute, funny, or cool of Nio, please. <br>Specifically, I'd like to see her wearing a plugsuit from Evangelion. If possible, please keep her bowtie on as part of the design.<br>If colors are applied, it would be really cool if the color scheme could be based on the black, red, and gold of her school uniform.<br><br>Thank you to anyone who may be interested.</br></br></br></br>  requesting mochi  <br>It's more like you ask for milk and the guy goes and milks his cat and gives you it. <br>It's not about it being shitty, it's about it being shitty and clearly had no effort put into it.</br></br>  Think like your drawing<br>Feel your drawing<br>Become your drawing</br></br>  <br>scribbles are 100X better than some entitled idiot begging to have get his porn drawn for free.</br>  <br> milks his cat <br> no effort <br>anon</br></br></br>  <br>Milking a cat sounds like a lot of work</br>  <br>nobody except retards like marikafag request porn in here and it already looks like he's moved on to a new girl for his harem shit</br>  Requesting Mazaki Anzu at the beach/pool applying/requesting help applying sun tan lotion.<br>Swimsuit up to artist.<br><br>Any other works are very much appreciated.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn! sorry guys I need to put mor attention thank you<br><br>And thank you so much drawfriend she looks gorgeous in that bikini, I love the pose and that navel dear lord fantastic, again thank you so much cya everyone next weekend</br></br></br></br>  <br>not Natebro, but the guy who did the gif. thanks for drawing her!<br><br> been a fan of your stuff in /v/ and your Rukia and Dorothy Deliveries are nice, I'm glad that I saw her in your style, I hope you had fun drawing her! </br></br></br>  <br><br>No effort in it being good. How about that.<br>Putting in effort to make it extra shitty does not score any points.</br></br></br>  <br>just because a drawing isn't explicit doesn't mean it isn't pornographic, or fetishistic <br><br>do you even know what a waifu is?</br></br></br>  <br>favorite girl to avatarfag as in the drawthread, according to the last thread<br><br>or a girl you have a "common interest" with in jerking off to and find other people with said interest in so you can all jack off to her together</br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously implying it's wrong to find your waifu to be sexy? It's like you want to be in the friend zone your whole life or something</br>  <br>i-i drew this with my blood, anon<br>b-b-baka</br></br>  <br>Shit-tier drawfag here. Playing devil's advocate and defending obvious troll deliveries is far more insulting than anyone complaining about the quality of a drawing.</br>  Requesting my mermaid waifu Mei Mer relaxing on a super comfy bed.  <br> talking in the movie theaters <br><br>REMOVE SAKUYA<br><br> Nice drawing. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so you're the devil?</br>  <br>That's actually really cute, thanks.

And to make it look like there's a glass wall between the viewer and the inside<br><br>-Something that really emphasizes her eyes<br><br>-Cleaning/doing maintenance on her goggles (note that her goggles and hairband are two different things)<br><br>-Doing/wearing anything steampunk related<br><br>-Reading some blueprints with a broken gadget in front of her<br><br>-Wearing enough gadgets to cover her head to toe. Maybe make it look like she's having trouble walking with all the weight?<br><br>-Anything with her in chibi form<br><br>-Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop<br><br>Thanks for considering!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thx</br>  <br>The difference is that all of the Shark deliveries will have been requested, which was the contention with the mass deliveries; people being sniped without requesting what they got.<br>Plus, I doubt anyone will be so ungrateful as to not take a Sharkbro delivery on the grounds of it being a two minute sketch.</br></br>  <br>I don't mind futa of my waifu</br>  <br>Same here. Just one of his deliveries essentially destroys the thread for that day. Let alone something like this.</br>  <br>go back to painting peanuts gimmicks are the only thing you're good at</br>  <br> -Doing/wearing anything steampunk related <br>I've thought about requesting something like that, but it doesn't fit the theme of her show. Good luck with that one.</br></br>  /r/ing Elizabeth doing something cute  <br>I hope he starts posting right when the first thread is made and we have 3 days of chaos.</br>  <br>ur a meme coin</br>  <br>Buttmad Ryoufag detected.</br>  <br>Like the pixelfags right? Because that gimmick got them constant deliveries</br>  <br>Not from me</br>  <br>Thanks! My waifu loves steampunk, good luck with your request too.</br>  <br>You don't deliver quality</br>  <br>Or it could be posted in a doc like the collage was so it wont effect the thread for everyone who requested for him to draw something.</br>  <br>rekd</br>  <br>I don't know about that.</br>  I know.  I'd like to see my Noir as a redneck-y fisherman<br><br>Denim shorts, flannel shirt, suspenders and a boonie hat with ear holes<br><br>Anything is good though, have a good Saturday</br></br></br></br>  <br>Based.</br>  <br>WHAT DO YOU KNOW ANON?</br>    <br>I didn't request and he's never drawn her before. I honestly just didn't want to request, I'd rather just have my normal requesting like any other weekend.</br>  I'd like to make a request for Makise Kurisu. I'd prefer seeing her in a lab coat slicing a cross section of a brain, but anything that you'd like to draw would be fine as well. Any sort of theme goes.<br><br>Thanks in advance for doing this!</br></br>  <br>I like his experimental style.</br>  <br>I can't wait</br>  <br>This is pretty damn good, thank you for this I really like your style, its also different from the usual delivery which I like so thanks again and have a good week!<br> Thank you aswell CrayonBro for doing the arttrade for this. </br></br>  <br>PROJECTILES UNLEASHED</br>  <br>THE NUMBERS, MASON</br>  <br> arttrades <br>There you go.</br></br>  Quick! Someone give me an uncolored rori drawing to color or Oora gets it!  <br>Fuck off tamafuck</br>  <br>what does she get...</br>  <br>the dick</br>  <br>The  brush  </br>  Requesting Hibiki relaxing while wearing DT770s.<br>http://i.imgur.com/OjN3M1C.jpg</br>  <br>This is cute anon, thanks! Keep on working hard and one day you will rule these threads!<br><br>Have a great weekend!</br></br></br>  <br>If you could add colors to this, it'd be great!</br>  <br> hey tamabro, did you have prior coloring knowledge before coming to the threads or is this all while you were here? Thought I might try getting into it too once I get a tablet. </br>  <br>Don't bully Tamabro!</br>    Requesting a drawing of Cave at the beach in her swimsuit.  <br>i wonder how long youre gonna go with this ryoucuck</br>  Does anyone else feel like coloring and shading takes fucking forever? I started screwing around with it but I never really finish until many hours later.  requesting Kanna, being cute, or doing whatever<br>thanks in advance!</br>  <br>Coloring and shading takes me about 20 minutes at most usually for me. It's also the most fun part.</br>  <br>Picked up. <br><br><br> I started coloring in these threads with nothing more than a mouse a few years ago with no prior experience whatsoever. Your first 6 months to a year will be base color and cel shading city, the next year will be ohgodwhydoIevendothisanymore, the next will be startingtogetbetterfeelsgoodbutstil<wbr>lsuck, and after your first 3 years you'll start to gain actual confidence and start looking at real artists to copy their styles. This is all assuming you're like me, but then again I'm really lazy and easily discouraged so your mileage may vary. Good luck anon-kun!</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it's because I get distracted or keep going back and changing things because it doesn't feel right to me or something. It's a cool little thing to do after getting a delivery.</br>  Requesting Aichi, anything is appreciated.  Requesting Risty wearing shorts and a bikini top or her in a gym uniform.  Any poem requests?  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Roses are red<br>Violets are blue<br>If some nigga don't draw my waifu soon,<br>Then fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wrote this one poem<br>I wrote it for you<br>I want a nice drawing of my waifu<br>Or I'll shitpost real soon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give me names.</br>  <br>Please draw my waifu<br>She's pretty, I tell you what<br>Her name is Oora!</br></br></br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>I don't like big breasts<br>They are useless sacks of fat<br>Prefer mine petite.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Makise Kurisu.</br></br>  Requesting Snufkin in a costume swap with a husbando of your choice  Evening, /a/!<br><br>Here are some ideas, but I'm okay with anything!<br><br>- Requesting my waifu wearing Fatima's witch outfit from Luminous Arc 2! Any pose is fine and any variant of the outfit is cool too - either a version fitted to her own stature, the outfit as-is and her being embarrassed trying to cover herself, or an older version of Hinagiku with proportions to fill it out.<br><br>- Her dressed as Saber Alter or Saber Lily (looking at my past deliveries I kinda want to complete the set, haha)<br><br>- Her waking up in the morning wearing nothing but a bedsheet and a smile. More tasteful than lewd, if that helps at all.<br><br>- Cosplaying as another waifu in this thread.<br><br>Please and thank you as always!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You could be a top tier drawfag in 3 years.</br>    <br>what are normies?<br>this one has my tears</br></br>  <br>It's harder to get started drawing than it is to color though.</br>  Requesting Yomi sumbathing with a slight tan and either with visible tanlines or showing them off  <br>use colouring knowledge to draw<br><br>dive in with no regrets and no  survivors </br></br></br>  <br>What the hell happened here?</br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and making the ribbons match the outit is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too. Thanks and good night.</br>  <br><br>Wait have you been just coloring for three years? You should be at photo realism rendering at this point.</br></br>  <br>deviant art shitposting</br>  Which drawfags have drawn you're waifu?  <br>Coloring is all part of the drawfag bundle. If it takes 3 years to start to feel confident at nothing but coloring, you are doing something horribly wrong.</br>  <br>tamabro speaks the truth<br>I should've became a colorfag</br></br>  <br>Phalanx.</br>  <br>tamafag</br>  <br>ch2o</br>  <br>A lot of them</br>  <br><br>I forgot to mention there was a period of about 6 months to a year that my tablet sat in my desk drawer collecting dust and I basically had to start over from square one when I started coloring again about a year ago. And besides, its not like I seriously practiced much anyway, coloring is just something I do in my spare time to make some anons happy. <br><br><br> drawn </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/aRrU0ptD</br>  <br>You could have used that time to draw</br>  <br>but it was drawn! And it was rare!</br>  <br>Well no offense intended, but if someone actually tried they could get to your level in about a week or two, and your advice was really bad.</br>  <br>Wow, rude.</br>  I guess she wont be drawn again.  <br>why dont you go back to roleplaying with your other circlejerk friends</br>  Requesting anything cute of my waifu, please.  <br>What's her name?</br>  <br>no u dont</br>  <br>What anime/ manga is she from? She looks super cute.</br>  Hi everyone. Requesting my love Shinobu laughing after hearing something particularly ridiculous.<br><br>Thank you for considering!</br></br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/MiFdV75N</br>  <br>Oh, stop it you, we all know her name</br>  Weekend is slowly spiraling down into despair. Just look at this attempt  . I don't know how much I can take. When will 34 or hakase or ch2o or boa draw her? What do I have to do?  <br>I don't even keep track or know their "names"</br>  <br>And even if I had I would still be below SSF's level. Your point? Not everyone has the time, energy, or raw talent to be the next sharkbro, doom, or mascot. I'm content with my mediocre coloring skills for now. <br><br>You're probably right for the most part. 2 weeks is a little soon for someone starting at the same level as I did (no experience whatsoever) but someone more motivated than me could easily be better in a couple months.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I haven't requested very often, and most of the deliveries have been anonymous. I think one guy named Stronger gave me a sketch once, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but that's it.</br></br>  <br>happy aniversary b-baakaa</br>  <br>Kill yourself autistic shit.</br>  <br>Tamafag reveling his true self</br>  <br>A lot of my stuff on the booru is missing artist tags, but ones I do know are boa, audere, monsterbro, mistren, sharkbro, luna, pixelbro, azylsagara, sora, crabbu, sock, ch2o, cantdraw and cahlil.</br>  <br> mediocre coloring skills <br>I-I like it! I really appreciate the work you've done for me!</br></br>  <br>The only one that matters.</br>  <br>lol gimmi ur babies</br>  I was a tough decision to make, but I need to move on...<br>I would like to thank everyone who stuck with me, it was fun ride. <br><br>for old times' sake. <br> https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=BNMOTIVE</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br> BNM is still the only person who gives a shit about BNM </br>  <br><br>Where are you going? Is that an old piece of your work?</br></br>  <br>You never drew my waifu but I liked you so good luck with whatever you decide to do in the future.</br>  <br>You're leaving? What happened? I haven't been around the thread really, but why are so many people leaving&gt;?</br>  <br> I need to move on... <br>Well, my weekend could get worse, probably.</br></br>  <br> ten years for some 5 minute sketch from some shitposting normalfag <br>Worth it!</br></br>  <br>Plugging your shit while leaving is kind of in poor taste you know.</br>  <br>So long, and thanks for all your work!</br>  <br><br>Well it kinda has to be at that point, right?</br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Are you gonna keep asking that, anon? Cause the first time I requested I asked if it was okay to ask for art of her, people said yes and now I have six deliveries in some 8 or 9 weekends I've asked.<br><br>It just makes you look bitter.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad anon, that's all I've ever really wanted. It doesn't change the fact that my work is mediocre, but again it doesn't bother me much because I do this for fun!</br>  <br> drew like 10 things <br> GOODBYE 5EVER PLS WATCH STREAM ONE LAST TIME BBY ;_; <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank god, please stay gone.</br>  <br>If you're coloring just because that's fine but if you are trying to learn drawing through coloring you're doing it ass backwards. <br>Instead of learning how light and shadows work and how anatomy is you're learning other people's stylization of those things.</br></br>  <br>Your deliveries have all been really cool. Best of luck to you in your journey arc.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127271458 <br>You should really just fuck off. Nobody really cares. The only autist being triggered about this and flipping their shit is you. Just stop.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127271458 <br>Let me guess, your waifu seldom gets deliveries.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127271458 <br>Or you could just stop shitposting about it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127271458 <br> judging other people's waifus <br><br>Sure is normie in here</br></br></br>  <br> The only autist being triggered about this and flipping their shit is you. <br>I just don't bother because I know most of this thread is full of people without waifus, and real waifufags are a minority. It's a waste of time to bitch for the umpteenth time that some fucktard is calling a fanart with no personality or anything a waifu.</br></br>  <br>No I'm completely serious. Someone with no experience whatsoever could be at your level in a couple of weeks if they really wanted to, and in 3 years you could most definitely become a top tier drawfag if you put in the effort.</br>  <br>Real waifufags got delivered already<br>Just join the circle and circlejerk if you really want something.</br></br>  <br>I also care but I don't post about it because I know the majority of you are a bunch of stupid fucks that don't actually have a waifu. There's no point talking to you stupid people, I just post my request and leave for a few hours before coming back and skimming to see if I got a delivery.</br>  Remember to have fun when you draw!  <br>Thank you a great deal, I appreciate this drawing. A normie is like a normalfag. What do you mean by "this one has my tears"?</br>  kubo draw my waifu please  <br>No point in advertising a stream that has no relevance here if he is leaving</br>  <br><br>You're right</br></br>  <br>Does he have average to large sized breasts and long hair?</br>  <br>Well then, start enlisting and training more drawfags/colorfags if it really is that easy; maybe if we had more people to do my job I would finally be free!</br>  <br> he </br>  <br>I really wish people wouldn't say this when I haven't been delivered yet.</br>  <br>yes</br>   All the self-proclaimed "real" waifufags are cunts. <br><br>Guess that's why they need waifus.</br></br>  <br> Real waifufags got delivered already <br>Like who?</br></br>  <br> Real waifufags got delivered already <br>B-but I wasn't</br></br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>My waifu fits Kubo's tastes perfectly.</br>  <br> you're a cunt for pointing out that a lot of people here just have favorite characters or are haremfags <br><br>So which of those two groups did you fall under that you felt so offended?</br></br></br>  Requesting my beautiful Rikka Takanashi in a wedding dress, please?  <br> Nobody really cares <br> only one newfag is futilely trying to make all the /v/ermin listen to him that dogfu isn't a waifu because everyone else has already done this a million times and given up trying to ration with the people in this thread because the majority are muh favorite character retards <br>People care, they just don't whine about it because it's a waste of energy.<br><br> real waifufags are cunts because they don't like retards posting random characters and saying MAI WAIFU xDDD  <br>I'm a massive cunt, then. I don't give a shit if you think we're dickheads, go back to where you came from if you think waifus are just a joke.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I usually only request here but I thought I should start learning how to draw so i can contribute too. I liked umineko so I wanted to draw her. I'm sorry, I know it's not very good. You can rerequest if you want.</br>  <br>It's all about the effort you put in. Giving people false information is what annoyed me, just because you are still mediocre after 3 years doesn't mean other people with motivation will be.</br>  <br>sorry for the late response, i just got in. thank you!</br>  <br> wah you guys are meanies for wanting idiots without waifus to fuck off from the WAIFU draw thread <br>Hit a little too close to home, huh?</br></br>  <br>But I never said anything about people with motivation, my original post was about people who are lazy and unmotivated like me.</br>  <br>Serious question, why did you feel like you had to practice by drawing someone's waifu, and pretty badly, rather than practicing on your own until you are good enough to deliver?</br>  <br>Is this a joke?</br>  <br>Give the guy a break, he told him to rerequest</br>  <br>Can you draw my waifu?</br>  <br>u r joek</br>  <br><br> only good drawings allowed <br>And you realize now why drawfags only draw for each other.</br></br></br>  Here you go Bupiti, thanks for making the nanami figure like over half a year ago, consider this an art trade for back then. I was trying to understand how hair works so nothing else is really good at all. I will be sure to draw her again when I get better.  <br> draws poorly and can't take any criticism  <br>Retard.</br></br>  <br>I only asked because it wasn't even just bad, it looked more like scribbles and like they didn't even care at all.</br>  <br><br>Don't put him down for trying he was just trying to practice and deliver for someone. I thought it was a nice effort. <br><br><br>You are just starting out and will get better in time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> draws <br>And he did. What's the problem again?</br></br>  <br>The problem is you being a little bitch and crying about it, it's a shitty drawing. Sure, it's a drawing, but it's poor quality. No one said only good deliveries are allowed.<br><br>Oh, are we not allowed to criticize anything now?</br></br></br>  <br><br>OR here, to be perfectly honest I am a bit conflicted about this, but I definitely appreciate the time that went into it, I don't want to be greedy or selfish. You have my thanks, really.</br></br>  <br>there's a difference between constructive criticism and being rude, anon. Besides, drawfag said it was ok to rerequest so there's no issue.</br>  <br> must avoid drawing legs...at all costs! </br>  <br>Where's the criticism again? The "practice until you git gud" which is basically saying "fuck off, you're not sharkbro"?</br>  <br> there's a difference between constructive criticism and being rude <br>When you make anything that isn't dicksucking "rude" in your mind, there really isn't.<br><br> which is basically saying "fuck off, you're not sharkbro"? <br>I refuse to believe anyone who isn't delusional or just a butthurt drawfag would interpret "why would you practice drawing someone's waifu and posting it" as "FUCK OFF REE ONLY SHARKBRO DELIVERIES ALLOWED"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why anon? Do hate legs like one of these leg hating faggots?</br>  <br>Goddamn, I actually feel sorry for you. I wouldn't want my 10 year anniversary with my waifu to be commemorated by some doodle.</br>  Why is this cute girl such a boy crazed slut?  She got boobs.  <br><br>Well, that second part was already taken care of. As far as the first goes, Miu is already kind of a slut. No doubt she will keep on in that direction but at least I can pretend she might remain pure, seeing as we know she still is as the end of the series</br></br>        I AM ERROR  <br>new thread?</br>  <br>What happened to her body anyway?</br>  Too soon!<br>Besides, I'm pretty sure they get recycled or stolen by the black market dudes.</br>  TEARS IN RAIN  Ending sucked.  Did Michiru cut her hair?    <br>TIME TO DIE</br>  <br> filename </br>  One thing that almost bothered me was that they got to treat themselves in a special way for the return of their giftia. No other retrieval got to do that.<br><br>As a whole it was a nice ending though.</br></br>  <br>don't hurt best girl</br>  <br> Filename <br><br>Clever</br></br></br>  Not gonna lie, it was average and predictable to the very end. That said I still got choked up at the end.  The entire premise of this show was forced suffering. What were you expecting?  Did they fuck in the bathtub?  <br> What I watched  <br>Plastic bullshit<br><br> What I expected <br>Chobits 2015<br><br> What I got <br>Retarded comedy, bad jokes and horseshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forced suffering <br>I'm pretty sure you know the actual premise instead of this stupid shit that you just regurgitated so I'm not going to label you as a complete retard.</br></br>  <br>I like how whether they fucked is the most important thing to most people who watched this show.</br>  <br>Go back to your yahari thread, shitposter.</br>   Bladerunner plot or conspiracies never touched on again <br> No twist or reveal with Tsukasa's bouts of passing out <br> Plays it strait with Isla dying and leaving letters <br> Just restates what we've heard a dozen times <br> Timeskip epilogue with implied new Isla-body partner <br>I get that they want to tease for season 2 or whatever, but really? No one thought that ending was good, right? That was disappointingly weak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The ending wasn't controversial. They didn't pull something stupid out of thin air. It was consistent with the rest of the show, and that was definitely for the best.<br><br>Whether 'Plastic Memories' is good or bad is a little up to personal taste, but I think it was memorable enough that I won't forget it any time soon.<br><br>It wasn't perfect, but it could have been worse. It's probably one of the better shows this year, even if it's not a big thing in the long run. Between this and Etotama, I had a good time in different ways.</br></br></br></br></br>    His expressions are what got me the hardest. Just falling to the floor embracing your decease lover isn't something I can deal with emotionally when played this well.  <br><br><br>There wasn't actually much suffering at all. I was expecting this show to be getting more into the whole griftia thing itself, how they are created, what makes them so human-like etc ultimately leading up to some big ass conspiracy or some shit that will change the fate of all griftias forever and that Tsukasa would fight until the last second to try to save Isla. I guess in a way the big twist of this show was that nothing unexpected ever happened.</br></br></br>  You people told me this was a SoL<br><br>You told me it was cute loli robots doing cute things<br><br>You told me it would have an asspull happy ending<br><br>YOU TOLD ME EVERYTHING WOULD BE DAIJOUBU<br><br>YOU LIED TO ME</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Timeskip epilogue with implied new Isla-body partner <br><br>And pic related made me so fucking mad but overall I liked the show. BUT HOLY SHIT I AM STILL MAD ABOUT THOSE TWO SCENES FUCK</br></br></br>  <br> implying he and tsundere won't eventually hook up <br>I honestly thought they were setting it up so they would be together eventually after Isla dies.</br></br>  <br>That ending was just nothing. I didn't shed a single tear or feel bad for a moment. As soon as it started with happy fun time and she dropped the letter on his desk I knew exactly how it'd end. It was just flat out disappointing.</br>  <br>You completely missed the entire point of it then.<br>Anyway, I thought they left the other stuff untouched because they may want to make a dating sim or other similar material in the same universe, but not necessarily with the same cast, instead of a second season. <br>Or they just didn't give a fuck at the end like usual.</br></br></br>  webm where?  Liked the show overall, ending was fine and pretty much what I expected which wasn't a bad thing since I thought it pulled it off well.<br><br>Those middle episodes though, fuuuuuuuck. If it weren't for them I'd have practically zero glaring problems with it.</br></br>  <br> You completely missed the entire point of it then. <br> You just don't get it! It was consistent with the themes! <br>The idea was hammered into our heads with repetitive and banal dialog. There were a few red herrings that were dropped, and the delivery was just flat. The actual relationship bits between Tsukasa and Isla were very well done, and the humor was good. There's no mature message that anyone missed, the series was about as subtle as the average LN. I'm saying the series is supposed to be a romantic drama and I didn't feel anything outside of boredom and disappointment during the finale.</br></br></br>  <br> Timeskip epilogue with implied new Isla-body partner <br>Only legitimate retards believe this bullshit. She is dead. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br> I didn't shed a single tear or feel bad for a moment <br>Good for you nerd. I bet you want a pat in the back for noticing the most obvious shit.<br>Fucking dipshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Aright folks fresh out of paint whaddya think</br>  <br>Try to reel in that anger, anon. No need to feel bad that not everyone liked the same flat drama you did.</br>  <br>The best part is that actually thinks they even implied that shit.</br>  <br>switch expected and got if you watched the last 3 episodes.</br>  <br>It would be an interesting plot for a second season though. Not-Isla falls in love with Tsukasa, but Tsukasa tries to distance himself from her because everything about her reminds him of Isla.</br>    <br>I don't think this show was written with continuation in mind.</br>  <br>Already watched it. How about no.</br>    Tsukasa then   People mad that they didn't pull a fast one or switch to another subplot. <br><br>Way to miss the entire point of the series. This was about dealing with death and coping with the loss of a loved one, not some shitty Philip K. Dick copy.</br></br>  <br>Did you see that ending? They left it completely open for some sort of continuation.<br><br>Honestly I hope they do something. A new season with his new partner, something exploring how the robots are made and why, Tsukasa becoming an engineer to try and fix that ass backwards design, literally anything. The ending as it was just felt like nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsukasa now.<br>What the hell happened?</br></br>  <br> It would be an interesting plot <br>No it is stupid and it throws everything they did (as little and insignificant as some think it was) to the fucking shitter.</br></br>  <br>That's not even close to how that movie went.</br>  <br>If you want to watch Psycho Pass then go and watch Psycho Pass  also ignore the 2nd season. <br><br> I get that they want to tease for season 2 <br>Pretty sure they don't.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This was about dealing with death and coping with the loss of a loved one <br>Yes, 10 minutes of crying and a timeskip really expounded on all of that.<br><br>Have you ever lost a loved one who knew they only had a short time to live, anon? The anime didn't touch on how those feelings happen at all. It just outright stated them then played the entire thing strait to a fault.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did you see that ending? <br>Did you see that show? The entire point was to make those people with giftias move on with their life after they dispose of their artificial family.</br></br>  <br> /a/ complains about an obvious asspull ending <br> no asspull <br> /a/ complains <br><br> /a/ complains about an obvious asspull ending <br> asspull ending <br> /a/ complains <br><br>I am used to it by now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you want to watch Psycho Pass then go and watch Psycho Pass <br>Already did.<br><br> also ignore the 2nd season. <br>That ship already sailed. At the very least I could laugh at how awful it was.<br><br> Pretty sure they don't. <br>They left the possibility for themselves there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't miss the point, they thought the point was stupid and the show was ultimately pointless. Which is the truth.</br>  <br> The entire point was to make those people with giftias move on with their life <br>Yeah, going from her dying and reading a goodbye letter to the ED then a timeskip with everyone smiling was some top notch story telling.<br><br>Do you people actually think you're shedding any sort of insight or sharing wisdom when you say "But anon, the point!"</br></br></br></br>  Adorable scene or the MOST adorable scene?  <br> As if /a/ would EVER be happy with an ending </br>  <br>No, anon, the entire point is that there's no implication of future seasons because of that ending.</br>  <br>ass pull ending would have been horrific, I don't know how people can be mad at this ending.<br><br>They said she was going to expire and she did what more do you want to happen?</br></br></br>  <br>If anyone had any problems at all the with Gunbuster/Diebuster endings, then they're objectively wrong.<br><br>Also, fuck off with your frog memes.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of the series is that it's over <br>Brilliant.<br><br><br> what more do you want to happen? <br>Something that isn't boring.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   you will never catch a robot loli waifu   <br> every show needs to ask deep questions and change my worldview because I'm a deep thinker and peerless intellectual <br><br>Just wait until you discover nihilism, anon. Gonna be a hard day for you since you don't know in which direction you have to tip your hat anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But I expected it to turn into a battle shounen!<br><br>Pretty disappointing that there was no tournament arc either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I think you accidentally clicked on /a/ even though you wanted to be somewhere else.</br>  <br> The point of the series is that it's over <br>Stop being a retard. You initially mentioned that it was open for some continuation and I'm telling there isn't going to be any more of this.<br>Those last moments didn't implied anything of the sort.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry Anon. They told me that Isla would be Neo-Renge. <br><br>And there wasn't even a single nyanpassu.</br></br></br>  <br> autist bitch <br> attention-seeking <br> obsessed with the thought of being needed <br> chooses a hiki beta faggot <br> best <br> best indeed.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you understand what "Leaving a series open for more" is and why it's different than a season 2 announcement?</br>  Will he draw a new ending for this one as well?  <br>Every series ever is "open for more" if we grasped at straws like you are doing.</br>  <br>A LN was announced, maybe the novel ending has closure.</br>  <br> ultimately pointles <br>Oh, I haven't heard this one before.</br></br>  Man this universe is open for lots of shit.<br><br>I want more lore, I don't even care if we never see Tsukasa again.</br></br>  <br>I don't know why this post makes me laugh so much...</br>  Why couldn't Isla have been this adorable prankster the whole series?  <br> grasped at straws <br> Ending is a timeskip that introduces a new character to the MC and teases their identity <br> grasping at straws  <br>Ok.<br><br><br>On the one hand I want to wait to hear if they're any good before I read them. On the other hand, I don't want a bullet point list of spoilers some chucklefuck ESLfags read on animesuki to spoil what might be an actual conclusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They need to go Terminator on this shit.<br> And then Isla was back </br></br>  I was secretly hoping for an outrageous ending like another Bladerunner type episode with Isla going crazy and Tsukasa having to put her down. I don't know why. Maybe just to break up the silly, predictable flow it got into. Ending was a little too tame and mellow to me given the subject matter. Tsukasa's emotional faces were nice though.<br><br>I would have liked if the show had done more world building in regards to the Giftia. I feel like there's still so much unknown things about them and their place in society and peoples' views on them. It almost felt irrelevant at times. Like you could have replaced the concept of Gifita with someone that just had an fatal illness (without any of the messy work). I feel like that's a bad thing in terms of writing. Maybe if they had expanded on other Giftia and their thoughts instead of just solely Isla it might have created something more.</br></br>  Honestly I don't see how anyone could not see this ending with bad end/no ass pull end. The entire series was a very obvious allegory towards the acceptance of death and people with terminal disease (hence terminal services). If it did asspull it would be spitting over everything the series ever did, unless of course they depict the asspull in a way tha basically makes tsukasa a monster and it's not really Isla but some abomination.  <br>But that's Isshuukan Friends</br>  <br> Not-Isla finds Isla's journal in Tsukasa's desk <br> Does  n't  regain her memories<br> Feels immerse guilt over existing <br> Goes into science to prolong Giftia lives <br> Isla is   still dead </br></br></br></br></br>  What if Isla now has short hair just like Kanade from Angel Beats? I wouldnt mind either but if I had to pick one: long &gt; short.  <br> introduces a new character <br> teases their identity <br>Fucking contradicting yourself, idiot.<br>It's just her replacement, like how Isla replaced her senior giftia and how every other giftia replaces each other. Whoever that new giftia may be, it is meaningless unless you want to continue being stubborn with the "but the story goes on, guys" argument.</br></br></br></br>   story goes the way its supposed to with no asspulls and Isla dies <br> BORRRRIIING <br><br> story has an asspull at the end and through some miracle Isla lives <br> WOW ASSPULLLL <br><br>whoever wins, we lose</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> story ends with isla going berserk <br> WOW EDGY <br><br>there's literally no way to end this anime without somebody losing</br></br></br></br>  <br>forced waifu<br>island and PM a shit<br>imgladitsover.jpg</br></br></br>  Too perfect to live.  <br> HAPPY ENDING THEY SAID <br>TOP FUCKING CUCKEROONY<br> Now how does it feel to have a half-dead OTP? Not so good, huh? </br></br></br>  <br>I know how you feel and I wonder if /a/nons are going to be assblasted the last few minutes before their death when they start to notice that there's no asspull to be seen.<br> What! So I'm just going to die after all only because I got this old. Fucking bullshit ending. <br>And then they croak.</br></br></br>  Holy shit in this episode they behaved like a real couple. Are anime went too far?  <br><br>You could do something unexpected that isn't an asspull.</br></br>   I hope one day, you'll be reunited with the one you cherish <br><br>I lost my shit fuck me</br></br>  <br>they spent the series going over how every single way a giftia would try to avoid death would totally fucking fail<br><br>there's literally no way for isla to live that isn't an asspull<br><br>and there's literally no way for her to die that isn't what we got or edgy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please give us one of them.<br>What I love about these threads, since the very beginning, is reading how everyone wanted this to end.</br></br>  Well, they did meet again after a minor timeskip just as expected. Great ride and robo-waifu romance, Dogakobo and Hayashi found a way.  <br>I don't understand what's your point but, yes it feels pretty bad. I just wanted them to be happy together.</br>  <br> Well, they did meet again after a minor timeskip <br>not_this_shit_again.jpg</br></br>  <br>That was the ending we got though... it wasn't big, but moving away from the car for the retrieval was unexpected, as it wasn't how it was done for anyone else.</br>  <br>They did, faggot. Get over it.</br>   /a/: thinks it's shit <br> /m/: crying themselves to sleep <br><br>Figures. /a/ wouldn't really understand the love for robots.</br></br></br>  <br> Fucking contradicting yourself, idiot. <br> Introducing a character means their identity has to be revealed <br>Oh, so you're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>They did not, queer. I will not get over it.</br>  <br>Stay edgy then, scumbag. Wont change the fact that giftia at the end is no one other than Isla.</br>  <br>Isla's gone you stupid manchild.<br>Maybe that was her body but it has no significance.</br></br>  <br>So mad and edgy. Must feel bad to be constantly wrong and BTFO</br>  <br>It's not Aira, it's just her physical hull. <br><br>You should be capable of seeing the difference between those two things.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, this show was mediocre and dull for the most part but I can't fault their handling of the ending particularly. They carried through with what had been established earlier, and did so reasonably well.</br>  <br><br>webm when?</br></br>  <br>Stop typing like an idiot.</br>  <br>Isla is dead, she's Archipielago now</br>  <br>It seems you completely ignore how that it doesn't matter who that giftia is.The only way they can pull that "tease" is because is just another coworker and not the meaningful partner that expired months ago.<br>Just keep throwing those single cookie-cutter sentences.</br></br>  <br> Maybe that was her body but it has no significance. <br>It could be, It could be not. Just see this way, they didn't show the body so if the show sell well they'll do another season where that's Isla body and magically get back her memories. If the show sell bad that's just a giftia.</br></br>  <br>They spent an entire episode explicitly outlining that once Giftias expire then that's it anon, nothing of the old personality is left. It's like the one element of the setting the show managed to communicate decently.</br>  <br><br> throwing the edgy shit for something that isn't even edgy <br>Two can play that game! <br>I want /v/ to go away immediately.</br></br></br></br>   edgemasters on suicide watch and grasping at straws <br> final episode title: literally we will see each other again <br><br>itshappening, the glorious asshurt and backpedal in full force</br></br></br>  <br>It's that one guy who went around saying how Isla won't die, now he's mad that she did die and he can't accept being wrong.</br>  <br> It seems you completely ignore how that it doesn't matter who that giftia is. <br>Because it doesn't matter?</br></br>  <br> they'll do another season where that's Isla body and magically get back her memories <br>I don't think highly of this show at all but that would be absolutely horrible.</br></br>  <br>Did you miss when they spent an entire episode for the sole purpose of making sure it was 100% unambiguous a giftia could NEVER get their memories back?<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Anon, please just stop posting.</br>  Be nice to each other.  <br>Are you trying to trick me?</br>  <br>good ending, not a huge fan of the after credits scene, and I wish they hammered the themes home a little harder (cause I'm a sucker for that) but overall this is probably the best ending I could have reasonably expected.</br>  Just started Yu Yu Hakusho, what can I expect?  <br>Have you seen DBZ, Bleach, or Naruto?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  Expect non stop fighting. Decent character development and the biggest asspull of its time.<br><br>Overall 7/10 In my book. Pretty corny, but fun and mindless. Just like it's inspiration, DBZ.</br></br>  Expect to get fucking spoiled for posting this on /a/.<br><br>What are you, crazy?</br></br>  <br>Also, Kuwabara is one of the best supporting characters in my opinion too.</br>  <br>Spoilers in your thread</br>  <br>Starts off as a gag manga with some nice 80s art, then turns into a dull fighting manga with tournaments.</br>  Generic shounen.<br><br>Well done generic shounen that a lot of other series have borrowed from because it came before most.<br><br>You'll have fun, OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>URAMESHI!!!</br>  <br>more of that</br>  Best OP and EDs. Great directing and sound design one of the most unique for an action anime.  I just started Evangelion earlier this week and I'm up to episode 8 now. I of course don't want any spoilers, but what I want to know ahead of time is--should I just skip the final episode of the anime and go straight to End of Evangelion once I get there?  Make sure you watch the Director's Cut versions of episodes 21-24. Skip episodes 25/26, watch EoE instead. Watch 25/26 after EoE if you're interested, but don't expect a huge amount. (I'd recommend waiting a few days)<br><br>Ignore the rebuilds.</br></br>  <br>Misato, rei, and asuka dies. No need to thank me.</br>  do you want me to spoil the show for you?  <br>Kaji dies and Unit 01 is Shinji's mom</br>  <br>Not true<br><br><br>Half true</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaji dies</br>  <br>OP you should know that /a/ is just a bunch of immature fucks who will spoil to you anyway. As for your topic personally I found those episodes interesting but do as you want.</br>   Misato is best girl<br/>   <br>It's sad if you actually believe eva can be spoiled.</br>  <br>This guy explicitly said he doesn't want spoiler.</br>  <br>Thanks. I'll look for the Director's Cut versions on my own time once I get there. 21-24 you said? And stop at 25, got it.<br><br>Leaving the thread (and probably this board) now, thanks to anyone who tried to be helpful.</br></br></br>  <br>I would still watch 25/26 before EoE...<br><br><br>  And don't forget the rebuilds, they are the sequel to EoE  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, you CAN skip 25/26 but I advise against it<br><br>All I ask of you is don't watch the Rebuilds</br></br></br>  <br> Not Maya </br>  <br>This is leddit nigger.</br>  Watch EoE and if you liked the parts where no robots fought each other and everything was happening in a dream (or tang or whatever), then go back and watch 25/26<br><br>Otherwise it's just a bunch of reused animation because they ran out of money. Watch the Omedatou ending on youtube and save yourself 40 minutes</br></br>  <br>Watch Episode 25 and 26, first, OP<br><br><br>Don't do this<br><br><br>And form your own opinions on it yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NGE looks shit nowadays.<br>It's over-rated trash. The writer now wants the anime industry to die because of the fanbase.<br>Enjoy your mainstream garbage m8.</br></br></br>  <br>no, it's actually good</br>  <br>The final two episodes won't make a lot of sense until you watch EoE. They happen concurrently during the movie.</br>  <br>OP, just watch the director's cut of the TV show and then watch EoE, don't listen to all this crap about mixing them together and other retarded shit.<br><br>After that if you feel like it watch Rebuild, but a lot of people feel it's much shittier because it changes a lot of shit and goes in a totally different direction. It's fucking missing what made the characters and a lot of the show good.</br></br></br>  Nigga just hold on. If you start skipping you might as well drop it. <br><br>If you really want to start from ep 16, then things get interesting. If you can still hold on then go to ep 20 and watch on from there.</br></br>  Fuck wish I would have seen this thread earlier OP. I just finished all the episodes and about to watch EoE. I'm quite confused, hopefully EoE helps clear stuff up. Didn't watch the DC episodes either  <br>The DC episodes don't add much at all. There's just no real reason not to watch them over the originals.</br>  <br>Ah, so did they really just run out of time and re-use scenes? I felt really blue balled to be honest. It was so anti-climatic. I felt like they were foreshadowing a giant event. I mean I know that giant robot battles 24/7 isn't the best but idk I just felt like stuff was unexplained. Like wtf was the lance and the instrumentality</br>  <br>Have you watched EoE?</br>  <br>I'm about to</br>  <br>Do that then report back here. It'll clear up a good portion of your post.</br>  <br>Terrible advice.<br>Watch first ep 25 and 26, THEN EoE<br>Rebuilds aren't as bad as some people say.<br>It's a different story, and characters behave differently, so it can be upsetting, but they still are good anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Literally only the kind of complete moron who browses /a/ does that.</br>  <br> wtf <br><br>Fuck off to tumblr</br></br></br>  <br> being this much of a fucking idiot to ask if you should skip the last episodes of a huge classic like this <br> expecting not to get spoiled <br><br>People this fucking stupid don't deserve to enjoy anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats with this random credits scene like 40 minutes in</br>  <br>Different guy.<br><br>I've actually finished evangelion and did not understand what the fuck was going on with the last two episodes.<br><br>What do the DC versions add to the episodes?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But isn't confirming spoilers, or deconfirming them, a spoiler itself?</br>  <br>I just finished it, so can someone explain what the hell was that all about?<br><br>It was really hard to follow.</br></br></br>  <br>One was a scene of Kaji and Asuka interacting.<br><br>Another was some lampposts. <br><br>Alternatively, you could just watch it yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I've actually finished evangelion and did not understand what the fuck was going on with the last two episodes. <br>Fucking<br>how?<br>Just how?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seele wanted to mix an ancient prophecy about the destiny of life on Earth with bioengineering and "metaphysical biology" (the fictional field of study about the correlation between biology and the soul) to force man (or possibly only themselves) to evolve into a higher lifeform<br>Gendo, who always was a selfish bastard, tried to hijack the plan just so that he could live with Yui's soul inside Eva 01 (which contains You Ikari's soul)<br>In the end Eva 01, Kaworu and Rei all independently worked to give control of the whole mess to Shinji who in EoE proceeded to spoil this wonderful opportunity by being his usual whiny emotionally stunted faggot</br></br></br>  <br> refusing to pretty much crawl back into the womb to shelter yourself from any pain the real world might present even if it means forfeiting all the good it has to offer <br> whiny emotionally stunted faggot <br>You're a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>He only refused after Kaworu and Rei had to convince him not to. He happily accepted it in the beginning.</br>  <br> proceeded to spoil this wonderful opportunity </br>  <br>Ok so what was the Instrumentality and the Lance? Just part of the prophecy? I thought the anime ending implied they became one single being per say, but in EoE he decides to make things as they once were? Were all those people slaughtered then? Rei says something about people can revive if they want to or something, so does that mean that everyone was revived?</br>  <br>I would expect someone handed disposition over the life and souls of everything on Earth could find something better to do with it other than "keep being alone and miserable in a dead world"<br><br>They weren't really slaughtered, but their bodies dissolved and their souls merge into the sea of LCL. Apparently they cna revive if they have enough willpower to go back to simple isolated beings. The one-in-all, though, is the natural state of all life on Earth; we put up AT-Fields just like the Angels do to keep ourselves separated from everyone else<br>The Lance is a failsafe that comes with the Seeds of Life that aliens threw across the universe to, well, seed planets with life. Earth was supposed to only get Adam, but Lilith crash landed on Earth too and started creating life. Sensing this, Adam's Lance activated and impaled him, blocking his terraforming and the embryos he was seeding Earth with. When the Katsuragi expedition fucked with him he awoke and did nothing more than continue where he left. I don't remember if there's a Lilith Lance, I think it was destroyed on impact.<br>Instrumentality is a plan to manipulate the whole process to fuck with life and souls to Seele's ends. They wer able to plan this because they found the Dead Sea Scrolls - the "prophecy" is actually an instruction manual for the Seeds that the First Ancestral Race (aliens) wrote.<br>And no, you cna't infer any part of this from the anime. It's all in a booklet that was released in japanese theaters at EoE screenings, plus in a videogame Anno had a hand in writing. Since he was directly involved shit's supposed to be canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Ignoring ep 25/26 <br>Are you all fucking retarded or just casual as fuck? Those eps are the very core of what Eva is really about. Its the real ending.</br>  <br> Earth was supposed to only get Adam, but Lilith crash landed on Earth too and started creating life. <br>So basically, everything is Lilith's fault.</br></br>  <br>Alright thanks anon. I mean I get what it was going for, with the anime ending and the character insights. I think I'll need to rewatch them sometime because I was just reading the subtitles and not really soaking in what was being said. I had to ask the questions about the movie though because the damn plot sucked me in as well. Great series though, might check out the newer movies too. I just hope Kaji and Katsuragi revived ;_;</br>  <br>Skip nothing. Confused, angry, and thirsty is the only way to go into EoE, you can only have it once.</br>  <br>More people need to know about the director's cut episodes, they have very important and the best scenes</br>  <br> I've actually finished evangelion and did not understand what the fuck was going on with the last two episodes. <br>it's really simple, Shinji stops being a pussy, EoE is happening during the original ending.</br></br>  <br>The rebuilds are shit. Especially 3.0.</br>  Spike dies  <br>Why would you ever? Just watch the fucking show, then watch the fucking movie, then watch the fucking rebuilds. It's like 5 hours of your time. Just do it.</br>  <br>NAGISA DIES</br>  <br>Reported.</br>  <br>Intermission. Also it's a creative decision. This way, the ending of the film will end with the story, no credits sequence to affect the tone of the ending.</br>  <br>But why in the end only shinji and Asuka remained?<br>Was all ancient soup?<br>Why did he tried to kill Asuka?<br>Why didn't asuka cared and called him a fag?<br><br>And of course, why would Rei give the decision to shinki?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Eva fags are this delusional now </br>  There is literally no reason to skip any episodes...That's something only faggots do.<br><br>Watch all of the episodes and then EoE. It really is as simple as that.</br></br>  <br>But how did you...<br> nd no, you cna't infer any part of this from the anime. It's all in a booklet that was released in japanese theaters at EoE screenings <br>What!?<br>Then how are people supposed to understand all this stuff.?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if he finally accepts himself, why is he trying to kill Asuka again?</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about now? Try to express your opinion in actual human language instead of memephrases I don't speak retardese.</br>  <br><br>I've seen them, its just that they seemed not that special.<br><br>one was how the second impact went down, the other was Asuka's craving for Kaji's D, and one which was actually interesting, showed the last angel working with seelee.</br></br></br></br>  Why did Gendo fucked almost everyone?  <br>'cause he's a cunt basically.</br>  I thought this was overall a great series, quick question though. How many other anons identified with the various characters in this show and had their eyes opened, yet still remain depressed losers? Thats how I'm feeling right now  <br>Because he never had to take a Professional Ethics course in college.</br>  <br>I think he meant that not everyone is as smart as you, anon-san.</br>  <br>It's not like it's at all obvious what the fuck is going on in 25-26. It's it only "makes sense" because of the fan post-hoc rationalisation that it all takes place in Shinji's head during the midst of EoE, but even that isn't necessary since he imagines/talks to characters that haven’t been tanged (hence there's no need for it to happen then aside from superficial similarities and the fact that people assume it must take place at some specific point in the real world) and he undergoes an emotional resolution that doesn't match up with any experience that happens in the movie (where he is more or less continuously broken), unless you see the events as a completely and entirely delusional rationalisation (which I feel would make more sense, but so many people seem to think 25/26 are actually unironically positive).<br><br>The fans acts like a ton of shit that they've just agreed upon is somehow trivially true.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it's pretty much everyone on /a/.</br>  But seriosly, why is Shinki  trying to kill Asuka in the end?   <br>To see if he's still in Instrumentality or Reality. When he sees Asuka doesn't reject him, but rather touches his face; he knows he's in reality.</br>  <br>And then Asuka gets mad or something.<br><br>If I'm not mistaken they're the last humans on earth so they should be nicer to each other.</br></br></br>  <br> When he sees Asuka doesn't reject him, but rather touches his face; he knows he's in reality. <br>That makes absolutely no sense.</br></br>  <br>Because the Asuka in his mind would have just called him a baka and fought back.</br>  <br><br>I'm retarded, is this correct?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ho0<wbr>7Ag6lV9g</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>So that means everyone will go back to life sooner or later?<br>Who patched Asuka?<br><br>I agree with anon, it makes no sense he tries to kill her for that, would you mind explaining deeper?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And the real asuka would accept death and call him a pussy anyways?<br>I-I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>They're not. Essentially they're the first humans because they were able to visualize themselves as they see themselves in their hearts.</br>  <br>She says disgusting as a reference to human nature in general, not just Shinji.</br>  <br><br>You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. The whole 'baka' thing IS Asuka. He didn't choke her to see if they were real, he was still angry from their fight. He stopped because she did Yui's signature caress.</br></br>  <br>Why is there a penis on the right side of the picture?</br>  <br>That's a finger. One can only guess why you're seeing dicks everywhere though.</br>  <br>As opposed to the one in the real world that was slapping dudes like it was nobody's business?</br>  <br>Welp, can't unsee. Fuck you.</br>  <br>Can somebody post double cup shinji?</br>    <br> I agree with anon, it makes no sense he tries to kill her for that, would you mind explaining deeper? <br><br>Eva fans constantly assimilate each other's headcanon and then subsequently assume that their assumptions are the actual explanation of what is going on. The result as a massive scale circlejerk where everyone comes to the same conclusions despite there being nothing in the original series that would allow you to narrow down the events into something so simple or 'obvious'.</br></br></br>  <br>No but I can post this.</br>  <br>Good thing art is supposed to be up for interpretation.</br>  <br>Art is shit</br>  <br>Shinji is a B cup at most.</br>  <br>i always try to spot the elevator scene when looking at this.</br>  <br>Now that's more like my interpretation</br>  <br><br>From wikipedia:<br>"The most widely circulated translation of the last line of EoE [End of Evangelion] is "I feel sick," but Amanda Winn Lee (Rei Ayanami's English voice actor and director of End of Evangelion) said she asked several translators, and she felt "disgusting" was the most accurate adaptation. You could say she is disgusted with/sick of the situation or with Shinji himself. My favorite explanation though, is this one: My husband, Matt Greenfield, directed the TV series and is very familiar with the whole Eva franchise. Matt has said that although (Eva creator) Hideaki Anno seems to change his mind frequently about what various things mean in Eva, Anno once said that Asuka's comment about feeling "sick" was a reference to morning sickness. Now THAT gives ya something to think about, doesn't it! Of course, Anno is quite passionate about the idea that every person should decide for him or herself what Eva means to them."[19]</br></br></br>  <br>What's your reasoning for that?</br>  <br>I especially connected with Shinji when he said he was sad but couldn't cry, thats how I always seem to feel</br>  <br> going with Matt Memefield's dodgy explanation <br>Better kill yourself now.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you go listen to more Hybrid Theory you mopey cunt?</br>  <br>elaborate on this please, I dont know any background from that guy</br>  JJL 44 soon. <br>Josefumi has shit hair, discuss. <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br>  What the fuck  Post-Scratch Dio has arrived  When will this get scanned?

There are Stands in Part 7 that don't originate from Corpse parts if I remember right. I don't think In A Silent Way or Tomb of the Boom came from Sandman or the Boomboom Family having a Corpse piece, so maybe enough exposure to either pieces or Devil Palms enable the use of Stands without them.</br>  <br> Killer Queen <br> The Spin in general <br> Bohemian Rhapsody can probably do something similar <br> Diver Down <br> No idea <br> Yellow Temperance? <br> No idea <br> Atum? <br> Atum as well? <br> Rockmen? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why no other part did this?<br><br>Feels less complete.</br></br></br>  <br> and "I win" <br> loses against diego </br></br>  So I've been reading the manga because I finally thought that I should see what all the fuss is about.<br><br>I've started part 5. <br><br>My question is, does the plot ever get better than "let's fight a bunch of one-time stands, learn every infinitesimal detail about how they work, and then never see them again (because we killed or otherwise incapacitated the user so they're no longer relevant)"? I liked parts 1 and 2 a lot, but starting at part 3 and the introduction of Stands I started to feel this way. <br><br> Also, I'd just like to say that while I enjoyed him, I feel like Dio's popularity is way overblown compared to his actual screentime, especially Part 3 Dio. The last part/final fight of Part 3 was very anticlimactic.  <br><br>I think I might watch the anime, maybe seeing things animated and in color would make me more hype about things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Missing ones were Spice Girl and the Pillarmen.<br>Oh and mind read could be Hermit Purple as well</br></br>  So if Dio decides to masturbate, does he end up jerking off or does he end up giving Johnathan a handjob?  <br>If you can't get used to the one-off stands, you probably won't enjoy the rest of the series.</br>  <br>its just jonathan jerking off with dio watching</br>  Post your favorite pose  <br>It's not so much the fact that they're one-off stands, really, so much as the fact that the comic spends so much time going into detail about the exact way their powers work. Literally pages and multile chapters dedicated to it. Hell, half the time the user is the one monologuing that shit directly to whoever they're fighting.<br><br>It's really like that the rest of the comic? Maybe I should quit, I dunno. The Italian gangster stuff in Part 5 has been sort of interesting so far, I'll probably at least finish off Part 5 I guess.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes, it's more or less the same flair.<br>Stand fights are more or less puzzle fights. They each have their own rules that need to be explained as their powers become more and more abstract. Part 6 has a lot of abstract stands.</br></br>  <br>It's a fighting manga. The whole point is to create situations that the protagonists struggle to resolve by brain and brawn. In a lot of ways Jojo is entirely responsible for the modern shonen "overcome all odds with my friends" genre. I can see why it'd become dull, the writing has never really been it's strong suit. I like it for the art.</br>  <br>part 5 also has an ass translation for a majority of it (thankfully the pace of the re-translation is picking up). Like, if duwang was bad because the translators didn't have the best grasp on english, the old part 5 translation is bad because the translators don't have the best grasp on japanese</br>    <br>It's been 100 years, the body is DIO's now.</br>  <br>The art is definitely part of what keeps me reading. The art in Part 4 started to get a bit more "generic" in my opinion, and I suddenly realized in part 5 that no one can do anything without posing like they're on a fashion magazine cover, but it's still beautiful to look at (weird hair and clothing aside). <br><br><br>Part 4 was absolute hell for me to get through because of that. Even besides the Duwang shit, I recognized two absolutely unnecessary references to Homestuck in the translation that made me pissed because if you throw in shit like that, how am I supposed to be able to trust your translation at all?<br><br><br>The fact that that body can produce a Joestar would indicate otherwise to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fuck?</br>  ITT: We post JoJo songs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e0q<wbr>3lby5bDQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Wait, what were the homestuck references? I've read part 4 twice and noticed nothing.</br>  <br>After the one Joestar it produced 3 Brandos.</br>  Fuk , I need a panel to prove my painting skills<br><br> don't go full apeshit with the panels  </br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NHy<wbr>wdqH3F6Y</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>In the part where Rohan was fighting the rock paper scissors kid, the translation I was reading gave the kid the line "You have all the luck! All of it!"<br><br>And then, when the alien guy was introduced, Okuyasu was trying to think of the word for crop circles and called them "lawn rings." They were pretty close together too, and that's what made me sure of it.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VvM<wbr>FhYMVawk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>PB had no damn characters left that weren't in future parts.<br>SC had the same problem, Jotaro, Joseph, and Pol are all in future parts.</br></br>  <br>They had a different translator near the end, so that's why that happened so close to each other.</br>  <br>Well, then its your fault for reading homestuck then. Those aren't even the obvious kind of references, hell "lawn rings" sounds like it could've been in the original.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Hrx<wbr>X9TBj2zY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mud<wbr>lXF3MA8Q</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>That's some magical blood there if its glowing red.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vmf<wbr>TE5ryMAU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Joestar blood isn't magical?
