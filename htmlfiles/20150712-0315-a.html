Mostly from Europe.<br><br>Baby don't hurt me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I remember Taketatsu got an email from Europe at OreImo radio.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_Wy<wbr>aysYQoFI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah.</br>  Finished watching all episode of Ozanari. This show healed me more than I though. Both of them certainly become closer each episode.  So, I watched  read  all episodes and I still don't know who the murderer is. It's not actually Kanon and Shanon, right?  <br>How does that work?</br>  <br><br> Is R07 actually involved with manga? </br></br>  <br>Yet even Erika realized (don't have the quote with me right now) that the truth can change depending on the angle you look at it, thus Erika was merely trying to force her own truth on to Rokkenjima. What ange wanted was an absolute truth</br>  <br>so? is he?<br>make some sense instead of posting random reaction pic.</br></br>  <br><br>Do I really need to fucking reply seriously?<br><br>Jesus Christ man, get real and use your little brain.</br></br></br></br>  what is it about Haruhi that gives her that raw sex appeal?  <br>Nigga you can land a plane between them eyes</br>    gibb me fugg    <br> Not liking S1 Nagato's distant look <br><br>Disappointing.</br></br></br>  If you had been born as a girl, do you think your taste would be better or shittier?<br><br>Would you even like anime/manga in the first place?</br></br>  <br>I would be either a normalfag slut or a fat fujoshit, so no. I am perfect the way I am, as a man should be.</br>  I've thought about this a lot actually... I figure I'd have similar taste, but I probably wouldn't be as fat as I am currently, and probably might be a little more outgoing but thats about it. It would probably be better overall, I wouldn't have to worry about SJW lynch mobs and shit for being a white male.  <br>I'd definitely look a lot like my sister except with different hair and eye color. Height and measurements might be different too, but overall features pretty much the same.</br>  <br>I am not too ugly so if i was a girl my life would be pretty much perfect and the worse things happening would be being ashamed my crush saw my panties after a wind blew up my skirt. And i won't have to resort to escaping into anime or movies and series and i would have a great life ahead of me.</br>  <br> I am perfect the way I am <br>It's good to be aware that making you a girl wouldn't inherently improve you or something, but let's not go too far in the other direction.</br></br>   oh look ANOTHER school anime <br> fine I'll give it a try <br> one school 5 guys hundreds of girls <br> this looks like service shit already <br> suddenly dominatrices and leather and whips and shit <br> it's a fucking submissivefag-pandering show <br> fuck this shit <br><br>It's shit like this that's the reason I never tell anyone irl I watch anime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not loving femdom <br>how pleb can you be?</br></br>  <br> You're retarded for getting mad about it. Lurk moar, stupid whore. <br> pic relevant <br><br><br> Well, you really embarrassed yourself here. <br>lol I keep telling you see </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lol <br> umad <br><br>Seems like they are right. You are stupid and new.</br></br></br></br>  I loved it. But of course I love the manga even more. Already pre-ordered every volume on AmiAmi.  <br>Yep</br>  The First King caused this right?  <br>Eren doesn't want to kill BR anymore. He said it himself.</br>  <br>nah, Armin has caught the bloodlust now. No one is safe.</br>  <br>What do you think he would do if they killed Armin? Stand still?</br>  <br>Definitely not, but it's not like Armin will die anyway.</br>  <br>It could be a live action cover. The movie is coming out next month.</br>  Lolis are for   BULLYING!    <br>I don't blame her, all that those snacks must be bad for her teeth.</br>    <br>bully the burg</br>  <br>What is this pic showing, I don't understand</br>  <br>I really really really like this picture</br>  Yuzu is sexier than sex itself.  <br>It's all the batman hobo charm and crazed imouto obsession that black cards give you that makes Xyz so beautiful</br>  <br>XYZ is best butt dimension</br>  <br>Ruka and Kotori are SHIT<br>S H I T<br>H<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being either Xyzfag or Synchropleb <br>The only good ED monster type is Fusion.</br></br>  <br>Hey, I never said Synchro wasn't pretty.<br>But you're gay if you wouldn't let Shun and Yuuto have their way with you</br></br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  <br>He's definitely more of a chink in the '99 version.</br>  <br>Who's death he used in the hunter exam?</br>  <br>I hope so. Really looking forward to pic related too</br>  Why do half of the young boys in this show look like girls?<br><br>Is Togashi a pedo?</br></br>  <br>Kalluto is the only boy that looks like a girl.</br>  おあがりよ!   people bash megumi or niku <br> it gets met with people agreeing that they're shit and call out defenders as "mehgoomyfags BTFO'd" or shit <br> people bash Erina <br> "here's your reply" <br> "secondary animeonlyfag" <br><br>why is /a/ so bias for Erina?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's a voice actor, he doesn't have to be good looking.</br>  <br>But most of them are.</br>  <br>He is average, but he does look really ugly in that picture.</br>  Shitty scans up:<br><br>www.readmanga.today/shokugeki-no-so<wbr>ma/126/all-pages</wbr></br></br>    <br>It's everyday life for these girls. It's a show about them not just trying to survive, but trying to both cope and make the most of the situation they're in.</br>  AOTY  <br> everyday experiences <br>Whose everyday experiences? Yours? Mine Those of people in real life? Most SoLs that are interesting are interesting because they showcase the everyday life of characters in uncommon or fantastical situations. By your definition, most of the good SoLs aren't SoLs, because of their unrealistic settings or scenarios.</br></br>  <br><br>Hm, point taken I guess. It's not a bad show by any definition, just not what I was expecting. I prefer my SoL to be comfy cute girls though</br></br>    What manga/anime did you guys start off with? <br><br>Pic related, was my first</br></br>  <br>I dont know, it must be something like Sailor Moon or Detective Conan, back in the day where it was airing on TV in my country</br>  Eureka Seven. It was my gateway into a lot of other mecha stuff.  I remember watching Samurai Pizza Cats on occasion in the early 90s, but I didn't see it as anything distinct from Western cartoons, so that probably doesn't count.<br><br>Sailor Moon (the mid-90s dub) was the first anime I watched that I actually recognized as "anime", so I would say that.</br></br>  accel world and hellsing  Episode 2 ETA 9 hours.<br><br>Leaked OP:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7hk<wbr>MDd3v-8s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  What is Shirou doing here  <br>Is that Umi?</br>  <br>How lewd!  I want dat KeyWeed now. </br>  Damn, that was close.    Old designs were unique. This new trash looks generic as fuck. That's what happens when an artist has had 15 years to 'refine' his technique.  <br> Anatomy <br> On anime designs <br>Jesus christ I swear I don't know where you people come from</br></br></br>  <br>Who would order him not to? Nasu? I understand that letting someone else do the coloring makes things go easier and faster when working with VN sprites(and sprite/CG artists rarely do backgrounds at all), but otherwise, I don't see what should prevent him from coloring himself other than laziness and lack of skill.</br>  The tsukihime remake is the only thing I'm looking forward to, after it's over I will kill myself  <br>The same way how people bitch about original Higurashi art a decade later.</br>  <br>Still, Tsukihime was fine for what it was: an eroge made by a few guys in their cramped Japanese apartment. That's easily the most memorable part about it.</br>    I think everyone is just shitposting now  <br> now <br>It was nothing but shitposting from the very beginning</br></br>    <br> Contrary to moving goal posts, I'm merely dragging the topic back to the original debate. The mention of rape fantasies came up as a justification for sharing sexualized and similarly rapey images of Hirasawa, which is clearly ridiculous if you ask me. <br>No, we arguing if you could "respect" hirawasa whilst carrying sexually suggestive pictures of her and you went on a tantrum of how men are disgusting shitlord pigs.<br><br> Sex *is* a normal part of human life, and unsurprisingly people do or try to imitate porn in real life, with unsurprising results. <br>Epic, and what are these results? Have I said "fantasy is not reality" enough? Have I implied that "people may have sexual fantasies that they do try to enact in real life" enough?<br><br> Regardless of whether this sexualization of women of yours does or doesn't affect your real-life encounters with them, <br>I'm glad you've dismissed that fucking stupid baseless argument.<br> we know that in general they would be repulsed by the mere knowledge of you doing this in private, and if you still continue doing this nonchalantly, that's a sign of dire disrespect to the person. <br>Is that the fantasy you're assuming that anon has? It's very evident seems he just wants to make love to her (which I don't see how it's any way disrespectful), not fucking tell her "hey I'm masturbating to pictures of you and it's hot".<br>You're getting fantasies mixed up. Don't know what's going in your mind.<br><br> I care when that shit is smeared in my face in every thread I enter. <br>You're on the wrong website<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127915577#p127925323">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The opening statement was not. pretty much everything past was</br></blockquote>]
