Maybe when she turns into a women she'll be better.</br>  What was even the point of bringing the Sternritters along? They basically killed themselves.  <br>Well never hurt to try.</br>  <br><br>Kubo is being very harsh with his characters, he is not even giving them the chance to have one last decent fight, the same is gonna happen with the vice-captains, there is really not point in bringing them along either.</br></br>  <br>For the first time, I'm actually getting the impression he just wants to bring Bleach to an end. Whether it's because he's tired or because of its fading popularity, the more this arc goes on the more he seems to be rushing through things.</br>  <br>Everywhere else is already fucked, where else are they going.</br>    everyone jobs, the chapter <br><br>But GODAMNIT, I refuse to believe Liltotto/Gigi/Bazz are dead, did they seriously went against their broken ex-boss who has gotten even more overpowered without any plan ? And what's more this happen right right away at the start of the battle ? Cut this shit Kubo, I want more of them.<br><br>Though Giselle looks as "dead" as in her previous defeats so there is still a chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yhwach has future sight. Whatever they plan will be useless in front of his eyes.</br>  <br>Because Jump rankings are mostly about what series Jump wants to try and push, and theres no reason to push a series that doesn't have an anime and is in the last arc.</br>  <br>So ? They could still try something besides attacking him straight ahead like retards. He's not omnipotent. Might as well say the same thing for the shinigamis and we know they're gonna win. Why making them back to set all the 'abandoned soldiers" revenge if it's only to make them die right at the start of the battle ? Especially when it was shown Liltotto is far from being stupid.</br>  <br> Bad guys want to join you in fighting the main bad guy <br> They run off to their deaths while occupying strong enemies <br>Two birds one stone.</br></br></br>  <br> I really wonder why bleach is suffering so hard in the ratings. <br>because focus on boring characters. At least the esada were fighitng against fan favorites or where fan favourite themselves. But who the ever living hell cares about bazzbe and lord toofsy?<br>Blue balling us with a few anel of grimjow, el, aizen and kempachi before changing focus didn't help.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no fading popularity, its been pretty steady since this arc has been going on.</br>  Hype  <br>They foolishly try to get revenge and fail, showing how strong Toofsy and Bach are. I see no problem with this at all.</br>  <br>What in the world is this thing?</br>  <br>Yeah but that's the thing, they didn't occupy shit. Ideally you'd come up with a plan to make them useful before you use them as fodder.</br>  <br>They should know their strengh way more than the shinigami, there is foolish try and being retarded. Might as well help a bit the shinigamis to get all the changes on their side. It's like they weren't even trying.</br>  <br> Zaraki and Mayuri double team <br>This has the potential to be one of the craziest fights yet. Hope Kubo doesn't fuck it up.</br></br>  <br>*all the chances on their side</br>  Why did Kubo have to kill off Gigi? But at least now things are getting interesting, Kubo has my attention. Oh and I guess Hisagi is also dead so no bankai from him.   Hisagi snipped and dies like a literal bitch <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br>I always keep repeating Ken and Mayuri gets way too much screentime when others characters would deserve some, but damn, this duo is way too good.</br>  <br>I fear it's another fake hyppe that will be followed by some asspull ass resurection to mirrror what happened with the sternritters a few chapters ago.<br>Might b Orihime, Mayuri, or Squad 0, most won't stay dead.</br></br>  <br>And he has a particular hatred for Kensei and Mashiro too, they both jobbed off panel by never mentioning them ever again for the rest of the ark.</br>  <br>They aren't trustworthy enough to actually plan around or rely on, but they are disposable enough to let them tag along and rush in ahead.<br><br><br>The sternritter wanted revenge for themselves, even though they knew they could never win. I couldn't really see them actually seeking help from the shinigami.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Kek.<br><br><br> Mayuri <br> Too much screentime <br>No such thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The X's shot seemed to go through around where the heart/lungs are, and his shots go through everything. And you know Kubo and his hearts.</br>  <br>Try reading Bakuman to know about Jumps inner workings thanks</br>  <br>Oh, Kubo will definitely fuck it up.</br>  <br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Just like Kira is not dead, right? Kakked at Kubodrone.</br></br>   Miracle is the team joke more than levar hiself <br> power is literally miracles <br><br>I can already see the resurection plot coming.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a bit of a difference between getting shot and having half of your torso blown away. It also seems that you're forgetting the golden rule of Bleach deaths, that no matter how injured someone is, as long as a top tier healer gets to them before they die they can be saved. Hisagi might be dead and he might not be, but its too soon to assume for sure and be mad about it.</br>   Fuck it... I'm gonna kill it. <br><br>Kenpachy best Bleach.</br></br>  rip in holes hisagi  <br>The only thing worth being mad is how shit Bleach became.</br>  Grimjow, more like Grimjobber amirite?<br> cafeine AND milk poisoning <br>he's literrally sharting himself to death</br></br>  Hisagi will survive because the sniper didn't blow his head off.  <br>If you don't like it why are you reading the chapter as soon as it comes out and then discussing it in the thread?</br>   liltotto portrayed since the beginning as a caculating rational person <br> dies after attacking the very source of her power heads on <br>This is the worst. Gigi being tupid is OK but liltotto as literally disposed from the tory there with no dignnity</br></br>  <br>Reminder that when an arrancar uses resurreccion their wounds are healed.</br>  <br>It was obvious from the beginning that the sternritter were launching a rage filled suicide attack. The only people upset by this are liltotto fans who wanted her to survive.<br> MUH WAIFU IS 2 SMART 2 DIE LIEK DAT </br></br>   Liltotto, Giselle, Grimmjow and Hisagi literally one-shooted <br><br>Also, based Askin Nakk Le Varr and Lille<br><br> None of them died, right?! Right?! Gigi is still alive, huh? Huh?! </br></br></br></br>    tfw Grimmjow got really beaten like this and will be out of the battle for months <br>  tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works </br>   Hisagi down <br> Grimmjow down <br> Rebellious Quincy down <br> Kenpachi nearly decommissioned <br><br>Not a bad chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His power is OP when he doesn't explain it to people.</br>  <br> kenpachi <br> nearly decomissioned <br><br>it's like you haven't read this manga ever.</br></br></br></br>    Rebellious Stern gets offscreen'd after doing nothing <br><br><br>I just want a Liltotto/Gigi/ZBambi/Bazz SoL spinoff in the real world damnit.</br></br></br>    <br>yeah and?<br><br>kenpachi with an arm twisted is nowhere near defeated.</br></br></br>  <br>If they stopped to get him or heal him they'd also be sniped.</br>  <br>Liltotto and Giselle got beaten off screen, we don't know if they were one shot or not. Also Hisagi was already injured and a weakling so meh.</br>  If ASKIN is dealing with Grimmjow Ichigo and Co<br>PERNIDA: Kenpachi and Mayuri<br>LILE with Shunsui Urahara and them<br>who will URYU and GERARD end up facing when the only people missing are Yoruichi and Aizen. And I doubt Yoruichi hopped over to another plate and I definitely doubt they let aizen go off on his own</br></br></br>  So who will appear behind Barro next chapter?  <br>He can't use 2 hands. That's like not having a Bankai.</br>  <br>I think our lord and savior Aizen will crush gerard with reiatsu, and uryu will have a round with ginjo and facebook.</br>  <br> &gt; tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works <br>Exactly what I'm expecting. But Kubo might Kubo and reveal that Nel's ability to eat other entities spirit energy allows her to adapt to it or something.</br></br>  <br>Given how some of these fucks didn't even use their Bankai against Aizen, I doubt it matters.</br>  <br>I know it isn't really lined up to happen, but I really hope that Gerard ends up fighting Chad. I don't know why, but I think that would be a really cool matchup.</br>    Orihime, Chad and Ganju are looking for Askin on their own <br>  Separation themselves when most of the group is pretty weak to begin with <br><br>Why the fuck is no one mentioning this.</br></br></br>  <br>SOi fon uses bankai kills everyone close<br>Shunsui uses bankai ends up getting everyone killed<br>Hitsugaya uses Tenso Jurin in bankai accidentally freezes everyone<br>Yamamoto uses bankai everyone incinerates rom being close to him<br><br>See why sometimes bankai is a bad idea in group fights?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Parnkgjas, "C", going full zit.</br>  <br>because they don't matter</br>  <br>he will drop his pants and use his dick</br>  <br> orihime rejecting the doses from Askin <br> kills him by healing him and putting him to a normal level of tolerance becuse he is constantly poisoned or some shit <br><br>it would be a curious matchup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Askin can't do shit to Orihime with his power. He'd have to got beat her up old school and we have no proof he isn't fodder tier without his ability.</br>  <br>I would be genuinely impressed if Kubo makes Orihime relevant, especially when her power just works too well against Askin.</br>  <br>  All of the group job against Askin's power <br>  tfw Orihime kick beat him </br></br>  <br>Even for Ken chan, it's still his whole arm.</br>  <br>No Kendo</br>  <br><br><br><br>KUBO MAKE THIS HAPPEN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, a lot of them (soi fon especially) were too weak/tired to even be able to use bankai by that point. The only people still healthy enough to bankai against Aizen would have been Shinji and Kyoraku, and they both have weird zanpakto that would lead to friendly fire.</br>  <br><br><br>this would be gold if it happens</br></br></br>  <br>Akin can do whatever he wants because if you don't know what's going on you just fall dead.</br>  <br><br>Every fucking time. Every fucking time Kenpachi is paired up against these crazy abstract powered weirdos, and every time his raw power blows them away.<br><br>His only appropriate fights were Noitra and his reigai self.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gremmy is the only person hes fought like that</br>   people think Ken lost his arm for real <br> with Mayuri around him <br>He'll gladly zombify im and you know it</br></br>  <br>That's not how you spell Yoruichi. It's even right there in her name, "Ichi".</br>  <br> Ishiin </br>  <br><br>Not only Mayuri, the royal guards may still have something to say.<br><br>Maybe.</br></br></br></br>    <br>That's not Rukia, the reigning queen supreme.</br>  <br>This is only the second time though.</br>  <br>Not tall enough to do that, she'd be facing his dick.</br>  <br>If we're talking about flat tiny girls Liltotto is better.</br>  <br>that's a very cinematic page</br>  Thread needs some most popular girl.   when did you fall into the impression you didn't see kyoka suigetsu? <br> it was momo all along who took all those hits </br>  Just like to note, Hisagi probably ain't dead. He was wounded to attract attention of the medic who will be killed. Think more that he is bait for Hanatarou/Isane/other healers.  <br>hisagi vs nigger round 2</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  Why do I get the feeling that this match-up : Kenpachi &amp; Mayuri vs Pernida is important? That the revelation of Pernida's identity will be shocking to the two of them?<br>Is there somebody who could be connected to both Kenpachi and Mayuri that is now Pernida?</br>  <br>The only ones that would be shocking to Kenpachi would be Unohana or Yachiru, and I don't think Mayuri would care much about them. I doubt it would be somebody we know.</br>  <br>if it's yachiru everyone will shit bricks.</br>  why did the chapters release today?<br><br>will this be the schedule again?</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't really like it but at least it would be something other than the awful "yachiru is sword" theory.</br>  <br> will this be the schedule again? <br>Nope. The magazine simply came out earlier than normal in Japan and as a result we got the chapter earlier.</br></br>  <br>Oh I see.<br><br>I was just surprised.</br></br></br>  NIGGA AND PANDA TRANSLATIONS ARE SO FUCKING DIFFERENT THEY'RE BASICALLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CHAPTERS<br><br>WHICH ONE IS THE BETTER ONE?</br></br>  <br>pernida's reveal will be a  twist </br>  <br>mangastream always unless they go full retard then wait for Cnet or Badkarma on mangahelpers</br>  <br>..c'mon Carlos, not now!<br>But I admit, I chuckled.</br></br>   Grimmjow is dead <br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br>    FINALLY some plot progression. And thinning the numbers, too, which is a good thing.  <br>You say that but then shit like this comes up.<br> ain't no shame in kinging like kong retard </br></br>  <br><br>Don't think the numbers willg et too thin, the royal guards will do somethign for sure, like revive all the injured/dead shinigami or some other shit.<br><br> I am watching you! <br><br> how are the tracks going? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was Akins really planning to do back here  <br><br> unless they go full retard then wait for Cnet or Badkarma on mangahelpers </br></br>   It'll be 100+ chapters until Rukia and Ichigo see each other again   I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a Bleach chapter.<br><br>I literally don't give the slightest fuck about any character in the manga. That wasn't the case before and I was always looking forward to someone's fight.<br><br> About the only thing that might make me interested again is if Ichigo led Orihime into an alley and made out with her on-screen, as he's groping her all over. </br></br></br></br>  <br>This disgusting shit taste.</br>  <br>the same everyone else is planning, to kill everyone.</br>  <br><br> low test babby <br><br>sickening</br></br></br></br>  <br> We have two plus years before the delusional shippers start shitting up the threads again <br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>Cool blog bro. If you don't like it then stop reading it and browsing the threads.</br>  <br> wanting Ichigo/Orihime <br> calling another person sickening </br></br>  <br>I remember when wanting Rukia and Ichigo to interact didn't mean you were a shipper.</br>  <br><br>The only way is to get off the ride. <br><br>I can't believe people are still watching Bleach.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> being a Rukia pedophile <br> haven't already offed yourself </br></br></br>  <br> brings up Rukia all of a sudden <br>Someone's defensive.</br></br>  <br> people complain about the pacing being slow because side characters get fights <br> people complain when Kubo offscreens unimportant fights to speed up the pace <br>No matter what he does he can't win with /a/.<br><br><br>Wanting them to interact doesn't make you a shipper, but them interacting always brings out the shippers in full force.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching <br><br>if only....</br></br></br>  <br> implying people other than ichiruki shipper are passionate enough to bitch about ichihime </br>  <br>Literally anyone who wants shipperfags to fuck off will.<br><br>That said, fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't want good material because it may bring out shippers? What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>  <br> good material <br>Well thats really more of an opinion than anything else, personally I find most of Ichigo and Rukia's interactions either boring or annoying. But anyway, I never said I don't want them to interact just that I was glad it wasn't going to happen for awhile.</br></br>  <br><br> hating shipping <br><br>What are you, gay?</br></br></br></br>  <br> round 2 <br><br>the number of times Hisagi has gotten KO'd, even though he's supposed to have gotten stronger and show a Bankai is just disgusting</br></br></br>  Pictured: the only good thing about this trainwreck of a manga.<br><br>Everything else is just meme characters (i.e. Kenpachi, Aizen, Mayuri), stereotypes, filler, asspulls, needlessly extensive exposition, and powerlevels.</br></br>  <br> I find most of Ichigo and Rukia's interactions either boring or annoying </br>  <br>I'm not 200 lbs overweight, or mentally unstable, or a NEET, or a tumblrwhale, or retarded, or even unreasonably stubborn.<br><br>You can keep doing what you like with your meager pitiful life, just keep that shit away from here so we can get on with our meager and pitiful lives.</br></br></br>  <br> If you don't like shitty tsunderes and boring glances you must be gay! </br>  <br> our </br>  <br>You're on 4chan are you not?</br>  <br>Absolute shit tier opinion. Rukia isn't even the best girl, hell she isn't even the best shinigami girl.</br>  <br> The fights we get to see are repetetive and slow as fuck, you can predict the outcome before they even start <br> Meantime characters whose powers we rarely see see get ofscreen fights <br><br> WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU GUISE WHATEVER KUBO DOES YOU COMPLAIN </br></br></br></br>  <br>Another delusional opinion. Such a simple fanbase.</br>  <br>Dont act like people knew MAsk de Masculine was going to destroy Kensei and Rose</br>   Bleach's fanbase doesn't appreciate best girl. <br>It must be hard to recognize quality when you're used to shit.</br>  <br> el aizen </br>  NOOOOOOOOOO LILTOTTO!  <br> actually wanting to see Grimmjow, Aizen, and Kenpachi instead of based Chad and Orihime. </br>   just be a good boy  <br> be a good boy <br> BOY <br><br>kek'd, Gilette was the trap all along!</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The fights we get to see are repetetive and slow as fuck, you can predict the outcome before they even start <br> &gt;Meantime characters whose powers we rarely see see get ofscreen fights <br>This seems like a decent argument but it doesn't even remotely apply to this chapter. You're saying you want fights with obvious outcomes to be skipped, yet you want to see the weak quincy fighting against the quincy boss when we all know he can easily defeat them without any effort? You want to see fights where we see powers we haven't gotten to see, but you're mad about a fight involving 3 characters whose powers we all know? The fight had an obvious outcome and wouldn't show anything we haven't already seen, so why would you want to waste the time of it happening on screen?</br></br></br>  What happened?<br>Why a new one on Wednesday?</br>  <br> only Rukia fans are shippers and people who don't even read Bleach </br>  <br> &gt;unless they go full retard <br>which is their natural state</br></br>  <br>Why would people with good enough taste to appreciate Rukia waste their time with such a terrible series?</br>  What's this 10/10 character doing in a 3/10 series?  <br>I didn't realize pedophilia was considered good taste.</br>  Askin continues to be the most amusing Quincy and we're finally probably gonna see Pernida's face next chapter. And Gerard seems like he'll be fun to watch when he gets focus.<br><br>I'm guessing that Yoruichi went to get the stuff her brother brought with him, as she disappeared from Ichigo's group. But Ichigo really is an idiot sometimes as splitting the group in hostile territory is never a good idea.<br><br>Anyway, while I did expect it, it's still a shame that Lilitotto and Giselle were off-paneled as I was at least hoping to see them at least start the fight.<br><br>Well, including the entertaining Zaraki and Mayuri interactions this chapter was pretty decent I suppose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> callinga one 6/10 a 10/10 and a 4/10 a 3/10 <br>0/10</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Fuck off, samefag</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As expected of an earnest reader of Bleach, your brain is the size of a pea.</br>  <br> But Ichigo really is an idiot sometimes as splitting the group in hostile territory is never a good idea. <br>I would disagree with that. In Soul Society and again in Hueco Mundo they split up and it worked out well both times.</br></br>  <br>Your idea of reality is so skewed. I almost feel bad for you.</br>  <br> discussing a series that you hate and don't follow just to push your love of a fictional character <br> thinking you're smarter than anyone else in the thread <br>Funny m8.</br></br></br>   ship posting <br>Well, damn.</br>  <br> getting agitated when someone tells the truth about MUH SHONEN MANGA </br>  Another great thread, people! Keep it up. See you!  <br>The only person in this thread thats agitated is you, anon.</br>  <br>But they all got wrecked or captured when they split up in those arcs Anon-kun. It only turned out good in the sense that they beat or escaped their opponents.</br>   yfw kenpachi and mayuri rape the elite kill off the royal squad that now has to obey yhwach.   <br><br>at least the two most overhyped support characters are fighting together so they aren't cluttering up something like 4 months of chapters with two different fights. At least Mayuri's fights tend to be interesting with their gimmicky special moves. This might be the first time Zaraki's been in a legitimately interesting fight.</br></br>  <br><br>but mangastream is always full retard</br></br>  <br>Damn, Niggastream Nemu would have had her shit smacked hard if she ever spoke that way to Mayuri.</br>  <br>what a fucking faggot you are</br>  <br>The thing is that if they split up, even if some of them are defeated they can still be rescued/complete the mission. But if they are grouped up and get taken out by a hax power then its immediately over.</br>  <br>Oh yeah! Isn't Ichigo's birthday supposed to be around this week or something?</br>  <br><br>Every mayuri fight excluding Ishida has been the same interact with someone close to him and die</br></br>  <br> Ichigo vs Kenpachi not a legitimately interesting fight. </br>  <br>Actually it's today.</br>  Wow. I was expecting jobbing, but I wasn't expecting jobbing of quite this magnitude.   Thor and B. Sniper will fight Kyoraku and co <br>Talk about filler</br>  <br> Projecting this much.  <br>It must have been a rude wakeup call, to suddeny realize that Rukia is above and beyond the manga like this.</br></br>  <br>Mangastream is better this time.</br>  <br>While that is true, my point is still that they tend to get fucked up badly when they split up; and besides this arcs opponents are all are hax or strong as fuck, so team battles are still a better idea in regards to finishing the mission this time.</br>  <br><br><br><br>what the fuck are you all on about? thats just a fleshwound for zaraki. his battle power goes up with the amount of blood he loses ya' know.</br></br></br></br>  I see that Kubo is trying to appeal to the cancerous part of the fanbase by setting up a Kenpachi and Mayuri battle.<br><br>Needs more Rukia. This is a shitheap.</br></br>  <br>the outcomes being obvious aren't the point. The details of the interactions at least have some dynamism with Mayuri's science antics filling the space differently in between the obvious overarching plot developments. Zaraki's fights are all just the same shit filling the space between the same old beats, none of it ever changes. The best fight Zaraki was in was the one where he was the villain fighting Tousen. And then it was only any good because Tousen's end of things kept it interesting.</br>  <br> Actually it's today. <br>Amusing I had thought his birthday was 17th for some reason, but I guess I combined the date Masaki died with his b-day for some reason.</br></br>   Caring about a shitty protag's birthday.   <br>Here's your reply, but I'm not even going to grace that post with a fish image.</br>  <br>How is that even possible?</br>  <br>People actually enjoy Kenpachi and Mayuri over Rukia? Yikes, this fanbase does it to itself.</br>  <br>my thoughts exactly</br>  <br>We all know that Ichigo is going to fight 1v1, having people with him just gives him spectators, not more fighting power.</br>  God this manga is awful. How the fuck can Kubo live with himself after writing this shit?   Kenpachi &amp; Byakuya tag team got offscreened. <br><br>KUBO I'M WATCHING YOU</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck</br>   all that hype about grimmjow <br> he dies like a bitch <br><br>LIKE A BITCH!</br></br></br>  <br> people actually think Bleach characters are dead just because that got knocked down in a chapter <br>When will you people learn?</br></br>  <br>Hopefully he offscreens more of these battles so we can get to Rukia faster.</br>  Liltotto was the last of the rebel quincies standing, strongest female quincy there. She is strong somehow but we never see it, like in the fight with Byakuya or when he put down Meninas.<br><br>I will riot if Liltotto dies, but I now I need for this to advance to confirm if they are truly dead like with Harribel.</br></br>  <br>Well this arc kills off characters much quicker than it was before, so...</br>  <br> Next time we see them, Mayuri and Nemu is in twisted pieces and Kenpachi is a ball. </br>  Did Yhwach just call Lilotto a boy?<br><br>How many more of these people are traps?</br></br>  <br>It was panda's translation but I think what he said translates to "children"</br>  <br>EVERYONE!</br>  <br>Since when has there been so many Liltotto-fags around?</br>  So Jugram has The Almighty after all. Is that a common trait of all the "defective" quincies, or does it appear because he and Yhwach are two sides of the same coin?  <br><br>I assume being able to see fucking everything is pretty stressful. He can probably just pass his power to Jugram in order to relax for a while.</br></br>  <br>he can see the future wen yawach sleeps, we don't know if the all mgihty are those eyes.</br>  <br> We all know that Ichigo is going to fight 1v1, having people with him just gives him spectators, not more fighting power. <br>But Ichigo really is the lone exception in this case considering his power and MC status. And everyone else who was with him don't have those benefits, so they should stick with him, or be partnered up with another to even stand the slightest chance of surviving. <br><br>Besides that, I doubt he'll be fighting anyone 1on1 properly unless it's Yhwach, Jugram, or Uryuu, but I guess we shouldn't factor out of series logic into this though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he just does it gather souls more efficiently, or it has another purpose. At least he spared Gigi and Liltotto. Either way now we know that they both have the potential to use the almighty at least. If the Sternritter had waited just another hour they'd probably be more successful now that the transfer has taken place.</br>  <br><br> Yoru/Ichi banter topped every Ichigo/Rukia back and forth, forever, in the span of a single page </br></br>  <br>The almighty eyes thing is shown on Hasch immediately following the panel Yhwach's own eyes close. So it stands to reason the power was transferred to Hasch rather than him having it all along.</br>  <br> banter <br>KEK<br>Shippers are truly the worst.</br></br></br>  <br> so they should stick with him, or be partnered up with another to even stand the slightest chance of surviving. <br>Well, they are still in groups just smaller groups. It looks like Ichigo went with Nel and Chad/Orihime/Ganju went together.</br></br>  <br>The way I think it works is this:<br>When Yhwach sleeps, Jugram holds all his powers for safety.<br>Here, Yhwach was awake killing Lil, so Jugram killed Bazz on his own.<br>Then, after Yhwach goes back to sleep, the powers he had, including the Almighty, go to Jugram again for safekeeping</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The ironing.</br></br>  <br> trying to salvage your ego that reaching <br>Take refuge in your shitty fanart.</br></br>   Retards arguing with retards over who's the biggest retard. <br><br>Typical Bleach fans on /a/</br></br>  <br>Even Bazz knew better than to take Yhwach on personally, even if he had more personal reasons to go after Hashbrowns.</br>  <br>If soul distro comes with The Almighty then it makes sense that Yhwach would need a second user to safeguard his powers while he sleeps. Begs the question of does Yhwach having Jugram on board strengthen his powers of foresight?</br>   People are deluded enough to think that any self-respecting girl would be interested in Ichigo   <br>But he's a manga protagonist, that means that girls will slob all over his knob like corn on the cob.</br>  <br>Only three girls. Orihime, Riruka, and Nel. Who are all shit-tier girls. Thankfully, Rukia and Yoruichi are above that shit.</br>  <br>and that tsundere chick.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br> Well, they are still in groups just smaller groups. It looks like Ichigo went with Nel and Chad/Orihime/Ganju went together. <br>Hopefully that's what Kubo was doing with that panel and they did form those teams. But we'll have to wait and see if it turns out that way next week or the next time we see them.</br></br>  <br>Those are the ones that are full on lusting after his dick, but there are more than that interested in him.</br>  <br>If they split up individually I want them to do the chant that Renji made them do in Hueco Mundo.</br>  <br>No, not at all. Just those three. Anything else is reaching and baseless speculation.</br>  <br> If they split up individually I want them to do the chant that Renji made them do in Hueco Mundo. <br>That'd be an amusing throwback. But, unfortunately, I doubt Ichigo, Chad, or Nel the only ones present that were there in HM during the chant even remember it.</br></br>  <br>Even if they did remember it, I doubt they would do it without any actual shinigami there. But like you said it would be a great throwback if they did something similar.</br>  ITT: common misconceptions you had about anime characters before you watched the anime<br><br>I'll start: I thought Holo was a catgirl</br></br>  I thought Death Note was about Light with his Death Note and L with his detective skills teaming up to find a serial killer named Kira  <br>I thought steins gate was good</br>  I thought holo wasn't a bitch  <br>This. And I thought it wasn't a harem.</br>  <br>I thought Death Note was a yaoi because of it's huge fujo following.</br>  <br>Would watch</br>  <br>I thought that everyone would be trapped in the MMO in .hack//sign. I got the best anime about video games in return, though.</br>  I thought the Tatami Galaxy was set in space or some shit.  I thought LotGH was like Star Wars. Turns out it's Romance of the Three Kingdoms in space.  I thought Neon Genesis Evangelion was a shitty harem anime that I felt obligated to watch because of sheer popularity.<br><br>Instead, I got an anime about tearing appart otaku delusions and an in depth exploration of depression. <br><br>I learned that it's very easy for things to go over /a/'s head even when it's basically screamed at them and explicitly stated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's kind of disapointing to have anime billed to you as being about quantum mechanics, only to to get that.</br>  I thought princess tutu was going to be a generic girly fairy ballet series, but it was actually pretty good. I mean, it was still ballet, but I enjoyed it.  I thought Lain in Serial Experiments Lain was a boy.  Originally I thought Yami was the main girl in To Love-Ru. Though I did find out about Lala a long time ago.  I thought Alphonse in FMA was a robot butler. I have no fucking reason why, I might have read a troll post or something and thought it lined up with the design.<br><br>Thought Krillin was a child in DBZ from only playing the games.</br></br>  I thought Kamille was a male name.  <br>well, at least you're not french then</br>  Up to a couple of years ago everything I knew about Jojo's came from that fighting game on the Dreamcast<br>Didn't even know that parts other than Stardust Crusaders existed</br>  I tought Integral in Hellsing was a guy.  <br> Accel is the MC, Mikoto is the main girl <br> Kumagawa is Medaka <br> The Count of Monte Cristo is the MC <br><br>I think I can be forgiven for the last one, at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumagawa is Medaka <br>nigga what?</br></br>  <br>All I knew about Medaka Box was that the main character was named Medaka and that that black haired guy I was seeing everywhere could warp reality. I assumed he was the MC, Medaka.</br>  <br>well, he definitely is the bettter character, I'll give you that</br>  I thought AoT characters were believable and likable  I thought that Klaus was the MC of Kekkai Sensen and Leo was part of the supporting cast. <br>I'm not entirely sure how I reached this conclusion.</br>  I thought Hitagi was an archer-class servant  <br>unlimited crab works<br> still way better than anything fate-related </br></br>  <br>I haven't watched Kekkai Sensen, but I actually thought the same just based off seeing a couple of pictures of Leo while browsing a booru and then seeing Klaus as the wiki page's pic when I only briefly looked it up without really reading anything.</br>  <br>Careful, you'll trigger the autists.</br>  <br>pic for reference</br>  <br>Beware of the consequences of your words. They smell shitposting from all over the net</br>  I thought Amagami SS was a harem on a space station.  <br> not thinking it was about cute Schutzstaffel doing cute things </br>  I somehow managed to pick up Wixoss S2 without realizing it was a second season,until about ten minutes into the first episode.  <br>I thought holo was a bitch</br>  <br>I thought Baccano was going to be super dark edge-shit. Like if Berserk were set in NYC in the 1930s.<br><br>Instead it was just really fun.</br></br></br>  <br> don't want to have immortality <br> get it anyway <br><br>Things you don't look for are already yours.</br></br></br></br>  <br> common <br>Sorry OP but you are an ape for thinking that.</br></br>  I thought Inferno Cop had actual animation.  For some reason when I read the title for NHK my mind did an abbreviation association to NHL and I thought it was going to be about hockey. I'm retarded sometimes.  <br> the NHL is conspiring to keep him a NEET </br>  I thought Lain was supposed to be good  I thought Freiza was a very masculine female due to my exposure to the dubs first.<br> Turns out, even in nihongo, he still sounds like a masculine female. </br>  <br>I thought kill la kill was going to be about a transfer student struggling In her new school to make friends and fit in. <br><br>I was very very confused 10 minutes into the first episode I had to check if I downloaded the right show.</br></br></br>  <br>You take that back you little shit.</br>  <br> S;G <br> anime <br>pleb</br></br></br>  I thought Mechazawa was a robot. Boy was I a fool.  I thought that Bakemonogatari was psychological and plot heavy  <br>I thought holo was a fox</br>  <br>If it's not anime, what is it?</br>  <br>Why on earth would you think that? He doesn't even look robotic.</br>  <br>I also learned this was false for 2 reasons<br> the anime paints her very orange <br> she is a wolf <br> the book describes her as being auburn and orangish-brown <br> the manga she is brown </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A visual novel?</br>  <br> pic related </br>  So this is pretty much "JUST FUCK HER ALREADY" the anime x1000?  Yup. <br>It's an ecchi harem, what do you expect? A good MC?</br>  <br>He'll go to jail. Would you go to jail just because you can't control your fucking dick?<br><br>The other chance is him getting married but that means only one.</br></br></br>  Doesn't he love them all equally or some bullshit like that?   but they made up an excuse for him not fucking them! <br>haremfags will defend this.</br>  <br>but she's not best girl</br>  <br>in which country would you go to jail for fucking a snake?</br>  I'll be back in this thread when spider queen and zombina get some time on the show.  <br>Most of them?</br>  <br>No. If you want to see people fucking go watch some hentai or some shit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128102828 <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting, fuck off.</br>  <br>Papi and Centorea have legs too.

Guess he understand how close to the line his works are.</br></br>  <br>Which one? <br><br>Her dad?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say that's pretty much what's happening.</br>  <br>How is she not attracting every single male? She's better than her shit sister.</br>  <br>Not to mention how he had his house modified several times and the astronomical grocery bills. All while his parents aren't home and his inner fear of them arriving at any moment without notifying him eats him inside out.</br>  <br>I'd say he cares immensely. It's just that he cares more about not going to jail than he cares about fucking.</br>  <br>Kenshiro, the 4 armed teacher and her childhoodfriend.</br>  <br> Japanese government spends millions to shit on one guy for the hell of it <br>And here we are complaining about Obamacare being wasteful.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Darling is independent at this point, he has a job, we arent sure about his age and all that but he seems to be a young adult living on his own.</br>  <br>They don't have jews sucking the economy dry tho.</br>  Based Papi  <br>He was living with his parents and they're out on a trip.<br>The house is his parent's house.</br></br>  <br>You forgot  ;_; </br>  <br><br>America will never have a stable enough economy to afford it's own Fuck Darling Fund.</br></br>  <br>Nah 1 mill is nothing for a country that a few trillion is debt. It's not even .0001% of the current debt. We can afford it.</br>  So I haven't seen anyone taking into consideration the fact that rachnera will have to shed her spider carapace at some point.<br>What would you do with a giant empty spider carapace?</br>  <br>Well he  did have one, before the car crash a couple of years ago </br>  <br>Eat it?</br>  <br>A fort.</br>  <br>Put it on display</br>    <br>Hang it outside the house to scare the neighbour's kids, duh.<br><br> <br>So what are the odds that Darling's mom is actually some divine monmusu in disguise or something? That indestructible body and being able to come back from the dead so many times.</br> </br></br></br>  <br>I know, if we elect Donald Trump then he can send our lamias down to Mexico so they can keep all the rapists occupied.</br>  <br>I thought coming back from the dead was because of Lala.</br>  <br> Naked Apron <br>Dick is diamonds</br></br>  <br>Paint it and bring to tourneys with me.</br>  <br>Wow that's so meta!</br>   you will never be tenderly squeezed to your death in Miaa's loving embrace   <br>Why even live</br>  <br>I'd rather chill in an hammock with Rachnee on top of me.</br>  <br>That will not be comfortable. Try chilling in a pile of sharp plastic tubes sometime.</br>  <br>Would Rachnee even bother Darling with the carapace anyway? She doesn't seem like the type to bother him with this kind of stuff, but Darling would realise that she's not going down for dinner and such.<br><br> And then he climbs up to the attic to check on her, sees the carapace, and not Rachnee, who's sleeping in a corner after shedding her carapace. </br></br></br>  Would you help a Harpy?  <br>Everyone already loves bikecop</br>  <br>He'll team up with the MON girls and fuck them and Smith.</br>  <br>You are a gentlleman of good taste for kn owing that book. Need to read it again myself. Its been years.</br>  <br>was there a big shitstorm when this came out?</br>  <br>That's what Darling thought too, but Lala herself stated that she wasn't doing anything. According to her, he was coming back to life under his own power.</br>  <br>How? I mean aside of oral I have no clue.</br>  <br> oral </br>  <br>is he in any way involved with the anime production?</br>  <br>She has human puss and even then would that really be the best you could do anon?</br>  <br>Worry marry and then help forever.</br>  <br>She can stick her tail in your anus and you will both have fun.</br>  So just watched the first episode of the show, I take it that both the TV and Crunchy rip are censored? Is this one those buy the BDs situations? Way less lewd going around than the manga.    <br> She has human puss <br>no she doesn't</br></br>  what is the pixiv tag for this anime?  Remove hamburger, fuck dog.  so i just caught up on ep 2, my god Smith is perfection personified, I knew this before but dam  <br>Nah it'll be pretty chill, she's apparently very light for her size  also physical contact with Rachnee is worth a thousand cut. </br>  <br>Mero please leave.</br>  <br>what<br>do you see in her?</br></br>    <br> Perfection </br>  <br> lazy slob <br> perfection </br></br>  <br> Implying you would get any cuts when cuddling with Rachnee <br>She ain't like the other monsumus, nigga.</br></br>  I want to play video games all day with Papi  and then have really rough sex at the end of the day.   <br>well perfection is boring then</br>  <br>Yeah because it is so much fun to explain the rules and controls of games. <br>Who wouldn't want to do that a million fucking times?</br></br>  <br>The only issue with Rachnee is she isn't trusting due to how she was treated up until she met her honey.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> implying <br><br>It's shown she plays vidya in the manga though. It's not like it'll be anything new to her.</br></br></br>  <br> rules and controls <br>She doesn't give a shit. Push the things and waggle until it goes.</br></br>  <br>but will they show her playing vidya in the anime<br>and more importantly<br>which?</br></br></br>  <br>Wii Sports.</br>  <br>I can vaguly her remember her playing some wii game, don't think it showed which. I hope it shows it in the anime.</br>    <br> Would you go to jail just because you can't control your fucking dick? <br>You realize that is literally the reason thousands of people are in jail</br></br>  Another week for the next episode.    What is the appeal? Doesn't seem much better than SAO and I've seen both episodes.<br><br>Don't tell me to read the novels</br></br>  <br>Read the novels.</br>  <br>They are probably garbage like every novel in this genre.</br>  <br>Guess you should drop this and never look back then.</br>  <br>Stop compare everything to SAO.<br>SAO didn't invented the trapped in a game plot and this is the only comparisson you can make between those two shows.</br></br>  <br>You not a fan of light novels?</br>  <br> what's appealing about spooky skeleton taking over the world <br><br>You have no taste, at all. It's not even shit, it's just nonexistent.</br></br></br>  <br>Then it's simple. This title is not for you.</br>  Leopard-Raws out, fuck I wait for this.<br>Ohys can't into encoding.</br>  <br><br> Just light novels with this premise. Most seem to be bad. I thought this would be something new and refreshing.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm getting bad harem vibes. I like spooky skeletons just not badly written ones. For what its worth the mc seems fine.</br></br>  <br>So Ainz doesn't like the anime?</br>  <br>How is it a harem with only two women?</br>  <br>Does it matter? It's not like the plotline is about lot's of girls fall for average high school guy.<br>Those bitches are practically created to suck to adore the ground he is walking on.</br></br>  <br>2 so far. It can always increase.</br>  <br>If you are getting harem vibes, you need to rewatch or stop watching, because he is the leader not not a love tool</br>  <br> SAO </br>  <br>Everyone wants his dick harem not genre harem<br><br><br>Middle school fantasy tier</br></br></br></br>  Why is everyone trying so hard to convince a retard he's wrong? 8/10 times he's probably just a deliberate shit poster trying to rile things up. 2/10 he's a dense mother fucker who thinks he knows what he's talking about and will just make up more excuses when you explain in detail cause he doesn't wanna look like he's wrong on the internet.  <br>But he has no dick. Shalltear only likes him cause shes a necrophiliac, and Albedo truly loves him due to his editing.</br>  Hey, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Can you kindly post stitches for episode 1?  <br>You are the person watching and enjoying an escqpist fantasy show for otaku.</br>  <br> dick <br>Have you even seen Papa Bones yet?</br></br>  <br>And you're the person in a thread about a show you don't like.</br>  <br>Don't bother objecting people love to entertain the shit posters.</br>  <br><br>Wants his bone</br></br>  <br>There's like ten of them and I don't want to spam the thread, any specific you want?</br>  <br>Its not like he can bone them either<br><br>Nigga's libido is also being supressed</br></br></br>  Would you rather a Mare with boobs or a flat Aura?  The anime is fun so far.<br>Is the novel a good read?<br>Are there enough chapters translated to cover a few days with reading?</br></br>  <br>Can't I just take Mare as is?</br>  <br>Why do people compare everything in this genre to SAO?<br><br>Jesus christ, have you only watched like 6 anime or something?</br></br></br>  <br>there's 4 complete vols translated. Took me 5 days to read them all.</br>  <br> MC has no dick <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Not him but how about Mare running up to Ainz in episode 2 at the end?</br>  Would you like to have dinner with the maids?  I want to hold Shalltear's hand and caress her softly and make sweet and gentle love to her and pamper her as she carries our undead child and gives me a beautiful true vampire daughter and we live in a 2spooky mansion and not care about what the world thinks of us  <br>Yep on both counts. First couple of chapters are a bit rough in terms of the translation/grammar, though.</br>  <br>I'm not the one fat fingering a single sentence because my ass was split apart on the internet.</br>  <br>SAO is universal for gamer trash</br>  <br>I had a slim hope of optimism. But yeah, time to throw it away.</br>  <br>I've always wondered, why is Yuri holding a whip/rod thing for dinner?</br>  <br> Middle school fantasy tier <br>Why do you even watch fantasy shows?<br>It's called fantasy for a reason.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't realize it was this easy to upset people.

I've cooked crab for years and I've never used a hammer. I just take it apart with my hands/pliers/scissors.<br><br>That just sounds awkward as hell.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate baseball.</br>  <br>Sarcasm new friend</br>  <br>Crossover when?</br>  <br> There's like ten of them and I don't want to spam the thread, <br>B-But I want them all ;_; <br><br>Maybe it's best if you do what the StitchBro did last season.

The tip doesn't even look sharp/thin enough to stab like a skewer.</br>  <br> I just take it apart with my hands/pliers/scissors. <br> Not using your teeth like a man <br><br>What a savage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hammers allow for less physical effort to crack the crabs, since all you gotta do is aim and swing, and also probably helps with stubborn pieces, like claws. I don't eat crab, but my parents used to use crab hammers when eating King Crab.</br>  <br>Never</br>  <br>Whats the point?<br><br>Do you want to see them juiced or Arche'd or something?</br></br></br>   bunch of secondaries who don't read the novel <br>Jesus weeps.<br>They don't even know how intricate and personal the novel is, compared to other light novels that assume readers to have the attention span of a goldfish. Does any other fantasy light novel dare to waste half of the first volume on the melancholy of the main character without any action? Or tell us about the love stories of lizardmen?<br>Then they shitpost on /a/ and complain how it's not like their usual SAO or shounenshit. Then months later, after reading some rants from Hayao Miyazaki, they complain about how anime is dead.</br></br></br>  <br> waste half of the first volume <br><br>Your word choice here disturbs me.</br></br></br>  <br> LN <br> intricate </br></br>  albedo is honestly starting to remind me of anchorage water demon from kancolle  <br>s/waste/spend/g</br>  <br>Fate/Zero, Baccano and DRRR are LNs<br>Not all LNs are shit</br></br>  <br>Alright.<br>http://imgur.com/a/AUls6</br></br>  <br> Not dedicated enough to become a chair all the time. </br>  <br>Well I just like how instead of the lizards being fooder shallow character they put in some charÃ¡cter into them</br>  <br>I watched this on a whim and it reminds me a little of  Disgaea , except more laid-back. And much better than the anime for that was.</br>  Papa Bones is tucking you into bed, what story do you ask him to tell?  <br>Read a Kawakami book and come back to me.</br>  <br>About how everyone left him</br>  <br>Wow.</br>    <br> http://imgur.com/a/AUls6 </br>   13 episodes <br><br>Why does it have to be so short?

Doesn't capture the atmosphere/feel of the novels. It fails to convey how grandiose the scenes were.<br>The initial gathering in the throne room as well as the one in the arena neither measured up to how I imagined them to be when reading the novel.<br>The art style and choice of VAs aren't exactly helping either.</br></br></br>  <br> ONE fag from Sword of Darkness implied that Ainz would find new friends to replace the old ones and look how they ended up.<br> What do you think is going to happen to you, faggot?</br></br>  <br>Bones didn't do shit to them.</br>  <br> &gt;not another SoL snoozefest <br>But it is. Episodes 1 and 2 were all comfy SoL.</br></br>  <br> implying he didn't use his Overlord of Death powers to fuck up with their fates <br> I find your lack of faith on Ainz-sama's power disturbing.</br></br>  <br>Nah, he gives her a few compliments as a chair. Like how she arches her back to fit him snuggly or something. She's a good chair bro</br>  <br>Would any book adaption ever beat our own imagination?</br>  <br>I felt the scene where Ainz flew into the sky was pretty great. I particularly liked how he ripped his helmet off almost right away, not even taking it off casually, just ripping the thing off and tossing it aside so his boney eyes could fully take in the majesty before him.</br>  <br>This show is fun but so awkward. I keep expecting him to mess up and ruin his subordinates expectations of him.<br><br>I was about to instadrop this show during the first scene when I saw the mecha looking dudes fighting Skeletor. But then Skeletor ended up being the fucking MC. Now there's a twist I didn't expect.</br></br></br>  <br>That flying scene was great <br>It just captures something.</br></br>  <br>It was fucking beautiful. If we get any more comfy atmosphere in this show I'm definitely calling it AOTS.</br>  <br>He never messes up in front of his subordinates, even when he messes up in front of his subordinates</br>  <br>Flying skeletons on black armor is great</br>  <br>I can tell that every scene involving the Virtuous King will be amazing if they pull it off right.</br>  <br>Wonder. It captures the wonder of someone who realizes they aren't in their own world anymore, that they are in a mysterious new world, a fantastical new world. Even as an expressionless Lich, you could still feel the awe Ainz felt as he took it all in.</br>  Anyone made a webm of that flying scene  <br><br>Hell yeah nigga.</br></br>    <br> even when he messes up in front of his subordinates <br>As expected of Papa Bones; he admits his faults and is so humble about them. I want Papa Bones to put his big skeleboner in me and give me skelebabies.</br></br>  <br>I thank you</br>  Episode 2 was boring, honestly. Nothing happened at all.  <br>I agree with that other anon. So fucking graceful. Even his helm fades away, like he doesn't want to sully this jewel box with some scrap metal. Why are skeletons so graceful and considerate?</br>  What subs do you guys recommend?<br>I usually just go full speedsubs but this time around Funi fucked up for real good. I usually bear their shit but this time it feels like playing a game at 20fps for fucks sake.</br>  <br>  Explosions! Moving Pictures! Stabbings! Violence!  <br>No sense of class.</br></br>  <br>Because, without the worries of life, they can truly comprehend the majesty of the world around them</br>  <br> video games </br>  <br> tfw you will never experience seeing a majestic skeleton fly in the distance <br><br>I have the sudden urge to play as a skeleton now in a game</br></br></br>  <br>The jewel box scene has immense importance, anon.</br>  <br> Nothing happened at all. <br>You should head over to movie theater of your choice and watch Mad Max: Fury Road. It's as if it was made 4u.</br></br>  <br>All there is Funi.</br>  I'm enjoying the animu and I'm looking forward to how he uses his forces against the other guys out there, I'm also looking forward to how he reacts to burnt out and destroyed villages and the cunts who have done it  <br>I guess without all that sinful, earthly flesh, skeletons reach enlightenment easier. I wonder if Blue Planet-san was a skeleton, or perhaps had skeleton blood in him.</br>  <br>There's nothing to recommend, only funishit left. At best you can wait for [ayy] for retimed and somewhat fixed funi subs, or use ripped 100% funi subs http://pastebin.com/43X55q7x</br>  <br>truly you are worse than hitler</br>  <br><br>Let's keep things grounded in reality, as this is still a chinese cartoon about a talking skeleton.<br><br>The episode was padded as fuck. You don't know how proper exposition works if you think every moment was needed.</br></br></br></br>  So will that faggot demiurge betray the skeleton king?  <br>Fuck you, Demiurge is a bro, and best son. He spends hours a day rafting cool fancy shit for his papa, like a fucking bone throne. Fuck didn't even sit in it either, chose a second rate chair instead.</br>  <br>I feel like this anime is more of a treat for the LN readers rather than an advertisement for the LN.<br><br><br>He's loyal as fuck, just very very mean to the squishy low levels.</br></br></br></br>  Bone stooooooooorm   Draw a girl, call it a boy <br>Why is this allowed?</br>  <br>Gotta agree, and I love the LN. Maybe it's because I've been through this part several times but I have to say I was really unimpressed with this episode. Though a lot of it was because I really don't like the anime artstyle. I get that you can't emulate So-Bin but still.</br>    <br><br>I was getting a betraying cunt vibe from him. So does Albedo turn into a yandere?</br></br>  <br>Because the creators will it</br>  <br>It's just because he looks like a lawyer.</br>  <br>Anon is rude.</br>  <br> See a drawn trap <br> Want it to be a girl <br>Far more heretical.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck his onee-chan in front of him.</br>  <br>I've read the LN, but I wanted to see succubus reactions.</br>  So basically the guild members all quit? or just didn't log in during the last day?  Whoever's ripping funishit subs pls do the same with Aquarion second episode, Funi's one is blurry as shit  <br>There never were other guild members. Momonga was so mad at being ganked so hard his psyche split into a persona that would 'save' him. From this point he created his guild, and created a whole bunch of alts to play with himself. He had each alt create NPC's and he programmed them himself to play out his fantasy of belonging in a guild, to keep him from being too lonely. and then he got powerful, and devoted more time to his Overlord character, and didn't use his alts so often. At the end it was only him and his overpowered character, inactive alts, and empty guild.</br>  Is the next episode going to be the village invasion and angel curbstomping?  So what's this show about? So far it's just been everybody sucking the MC's dick.  <br>Thanks for this.</br>   Holy shit, that fight with Clementine and Kajit. At first I was disappointed that Ainz didn't take on Kajit just show off he was a Lich, but Ainz killing Clem was fucking brutal, it was so great.   <br>Put this shit in the spoilers tag</br>  <br>He's lying.</br>  <br> Nigga, just hurry up and get to volume 3. </br>  <br>No way.</br>  <br> to think something like that lives in everyone of us <br><br>Truly marvelous.</br></br></br>  <br>But SAO is the gold standard of "trapped in virtual reality".<br>Not that it is a very mature genre with bad franchises like HACK and Snore Horizon.</br></br>  <br>I just did, am I in for something great?</br>    reminder that current beta CCCP + current madVR fixes the issues with Funi's colors  <br>Layers like a cake?</br>  What race is Albedo?  <br><br> CCCP </br></br>  <br>This isn't the Gakkou Gurashi thread.</br>  <br>The climax of the first 3 volumes. The author likes to do that kind of shit every 2 or 3 volumes but volume 3 takes the cake for all the volumes currently translated.</br>  <br> mindflayer, she hides her squid </br>    <br>Doh boy.</br>   Anime takes out Demiurge talking about how Mare should capture elves and such for breeding purposes. Probably because it's not child friendly. <br><br>Should I be worried that there'll be no darkness in my chinese cartoons compared to the novels?</br></br>  <br>Gorilla</br>  <br>I'd rather use CCCP, which is heavily tested and has custom patches, over KCP's "just use the latest versions always!" mentality.</br>  <br>That's Neuronist to you.</br>  <br>Next episode is Death Knight Deathmatch<br>Episode after is throwing Angels into the void</br></br>  <br><br> 41 alt accounts  <br>dude got a lot of free time</br></br></br>  <br>They still use xy-vsfilter so that makes them shit. Well granted that xy-subfilter isn't yet out there in final form and has slowpoke level development. But still.</br>  <br><br>it sounds like you are trying very hard to be convinced that you don't want to watch this, you don't need our approval you know</br></br>  <br>The twist is he was a skeleton all along, and because of his unholy stamina he could simultaneously manage all accounts at the same time and even work in fake 'sleeping schedules' where some alts would be logged out and he would pretend that they were asleep, just to make it more authentic. And when he was pretending to be asleep, he would have all his alts go "where's momonga?"</br>  <br>And "patching" dead in water Haali is pretty retarded, or even carry it along when it's job is done by other compontents, same as xy-vs. Haali can't even into hevc.</br>  <br>Funi's color issues are merely a colorspace/dyn.rng conversion, not really hard to fix when HorribleSubs do it automatically for you for their files. Since last month or so, slow but yeah.</br>  <br>Which NPC did he write again?</br>  <br>Who uses Haali still? CCCP removed it last year.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br> he was a skeleton all along <br>S-stop scaring me anon</br></br>  <br>Victim? He's overly protective of that one</br>  <br>You want to know the real twist tho? You know that pic posted saying that we are brains and as brains we're actually the ones trapped inside skeletons?  There's a skeleton in his brain, too. <br><br><br> Literal meatshield <br> Overly protective </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm actually pretty impressed at the dedication to this lie.</br></br>  <br>Remember, there is always magic. Heck if you can quite literally "make a wish" growing a tentacle dick or 2 should be plausible.</br>  <br>He's a double skeleton roleplaying as a human trapped in a skeleton. I'm calling it now, and you'll feel the fool for doubting me.</br>  <br>How big of a autist was he to do this shit?</br>  <br>Skeletons don't get autism. I mean, do they?</br>  <br>They have problems emphasizing with meatbags, they all have autism.</br>  <br>No anon, I think you have it the wrong way around. I think Autism has skeletons.</br>  <br>Often refered to as a demon, only race class we know she has is lvl10 imp, but there are atleast 20 levels of other race classes unknown.</br>  <br>But the squid is her husband</br>  <br>Pandora Actor</br>    <br> heteromorphc <br>Wait, he made a genderfluid Hitler?</br></br>  So what is /a/'s recommended way to watch this? From previous threads Funi rips seem like a no-go.<br>Raw with Funi subs? If so, Ohys-Raws ot Leopard-Raws?<br>[AU]? [AE]? Or, god help you, [AnimeRG]?</br></br>  I'm 95% sure next episode begins with the prologue. If it does, I actually think it wasn't a bad decision to not begin the show with it, considering it would take 3 episodes to get to the point where it was relevant.  I hear the novels get pretty dark. How dark?  <br> Ainz kills someone by squeezing them to death in his arms, it's pretty graphic. And theres also a man who gets swallowed alive by a maid-slime and dissolved slowly alive inside her.  </br>  <br>Yeesh. Really? There's more along those lines?</br>  <br> Not to mention the adventurer being eaten alive by cockroaches and other funny ways Arches team got fucked by. </br>  <br>I'd imagine so, the second example is only one part of a pretty gruesome scene.</br>  <br> And ofc there is Demiurge and his human farm skinning and healing humans for parchment materials. </br>  <br> You will read about little girls shitting their pants at the sight of papa bones and what makes it worse is that you will learn her story and it makes it feel bad to watch </br>  <br><br><br>These are our protagonists</br></br></br>  All the talks about squids and Pandora's Actor made me go recheck the chapter. Did Ainz actually use any of the world-tier items he said he would retrieve from the treasury and which one did what?  <br> Arche ;_; </br>  <br> From previous threads Funi rips seem like a no-go. <br>Funi is fine for the second episode. They fucked up the first.<br>Ayy is probably better but they're days late due to raw availability.<br>AnimeRG is Funi.<br><br>Basically just go with Funi if you want to watch it soon and they aren't known to be fucking up again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have 11. Ainz carries one by guild agreement (previously in-game obv), Albedo carries one and was secretly given one by Tabula, that leaves 8 and 3 of those are one-time use only so Papa Bones retrieved 5 and hands them out for Guardians when needed (ie they go out without proper support and need something they can rely on in ambush and so on).</br>  what's with that slut, shalltear, was it? is she gonna betray the skeleton as the OP implies?  <br>He retrieved the thing that converted him into a warrior from a mage, right?</br>  <br>Her name's Albedo, you shouldn't confuse them.</br>  <br>No, that's regular spell available for all mages if/when they want to fool around with items unavailable for them. Doesn't make them good melee classes or anything but Ainz banked on the Divine class gear left behind by the guild.</br>  <br>Then was it touch Me's armor that he went and got?</br>  <br>Yeah, though we don't know if he used those p2w items (the sticks he broke in the fight with Shalltear) by placing the sticks on the gear inside the Mausoleum or if he had to take the gear to his inventory and use the sticks as fast switch. Either way, they returned to their original place, the Mausoleum on the avataras or into his item box when he "let go" from them and broke another p2w stick.</br>  <br>No, no Albedo is the devoted waifu , you can't fool me LNfag</br>  <br>I remember now. He lends them to any guardians on field work to shield them from world-tier item effects.</br>  <br>Yeah, sluttear turns traitor. If you're gonna waiu some one, Waifu best grill, final Solution.</br>  <br><br>Oh you.</br></br>  <br>Aye. And maybe use them if their effect/usage is beneficial in the situation. They aren't automatic "I win" buttons outside of the Twenty.</br>  <br>How many times do we have to have this conversation<br><br>Yes shalltear betrays him<br><br>But she was being controlled by a world class item</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably bank on the gear staying in their original place since each of the stick/charms had to be inscribed with what their pairs were on and he had them in certain order on his gear's slots/whatever before he initiated the fight.</br>  OH GOD<br>Just read Vol 7 chapter 1 now because i saw it on Baka.<br> I DON'T WANT ARCHE TO DIE, I WANT PAPA BONES TO HELP HER<br>SHE DESERVE MORE THAN THIS</br> </br></br>  <br>Well too bad.  Her dead body was cut into pieces: Entoma uses Arche's voice to replace her old voice, Demiurge takes her skin, several undead take her arms and legs, her head is used as decoration for the devils and the leftovers become food.  A shame indeed.</br>  <br>We can still hope her  sisters make it through though . But I wouldn't count on that.</br>  <br>Fucker, it's bone breakingly bad.</br>  <br>shots fired</br>  <br> How high are the chance that Papa bones revive her for politics and shit, reading about her family make me mad and I want her at least to be happy <br>I wanted a spooky Papa bones but not this.</br></br>  <br><br>Blame the nips that voted for her death.</br></br>  <br>I think the scene were they first bowed before Ainz was actually very well made with the music and the zoom on his face with his eyes glowing stronger. That captured it very well. However, I do think that the scene in the sky did fail to capture it's importance. Well, we do still have to see Demiurge conveying his point of view to the others.</br>  Remember that if you like the ED you are Deaf  <br>What do you mean by voted?</br>  Was episode 2 good?  <br>holy fuck how are they going to animated that</br>  <br>Depends on your taste but I think most people who watched it liked it.</br>  <br>Author: Hey readers, here's a poll. <br>Option A: Arche lives<br>Option B: Arche dies</br></br></br>  <br>They aren't.</br>  <br>Was boring and nothing happened.</br>  <br>why you should relate to him</br>  <br>She lives in the WN. Author asked Japs if they wanted a tragic end instead. They voted yes. Same with  Gazef .</br>  <br>are some of the maids human?</br>  <br>As an animeonlyfag, I thought it was okay.</br>  Shit, I'm having low frame rates with the first episode, is anybody else experiencing it?  <br> Nazarick <br> Only non humans required <br>What do you think?</br></br></br>  <br>It was boring for the most part<br><br>But I really like the whole flying in the sky with taking over the world needs mightt be fun thing</br></br></br>  <br>It's Funi, second episode kinda fix that.</br>  <br>Narberal looks like a normal human, though.</br>  <br>I want him to tell me a story of world conquest. Like how he made his will imposed on some city of moralfags or something.</br>  <br>No one in Nazarick are human maybe except the 41 homunculus maids  the last member of the Pleiades is a human.  </br>  <br>I'm watching project-gxs releases.</br>  <br>what it really was<br>Option A: Arche lives while being sexually abused and played with till her mind breaks and is fed to Entoma.<br>Option B: Arche Dies</br></br></br>  <br> Skeleton blood <br>I like you</br></br>  <br>Imagine what kind of gigantic faggot would pick option B there.</br>  <br> Option A: Arche lives while being sexually abused and played with till her mind breaks and is fed to Entoma. <br>More like: Arche "lives" become a vampire bride of Shalltear, then she teach Ainz how to dance.</br></br>  <br>But we're all skeletons in the end.</br>  <br>Doppleganger. She can mimic humans so shes the one Ainz picks to go out with when playing human since she's easiest to disguise.</br>  <br>Japan thought she was better off dead, thats all there is to it. Now you can just feel bad for her or laugh at her head decoration.</br>  <br>Too bad she's retarded.</br>  <br>No one is human in Nazarik. Any human would instantly die from being eaten or from the curses/evil aura around the place.</br>  <br>What he didnt take into account was that she is (mentally) probably the most dangerous maid towards humans. She sees them as litle more than annoying insects that should be exterminated.</br>  This show has good OP and ED  <br>Wall this is a sad start to a morning</br>  <br>Except Lastborn of Pleiades.<br><br> The Lastborn of Pleiades is the leader of the "Pleiades Seven Sisters" system. She is the only human NPC of Nazarick and possesses eternal life. Her name and other detailed information are unknown.  </br></br></br>  <br>Probably nil, unless Ainz decides to instigate a rebellion against Blood Emperor by using the ousted noble families. I doubt it.</br>  <br>come again?</br>  <br>Well it's technically a novel right? Just not a light novel. I mean, I've got a few of the books and they are not light by any means.</br>  <br>Anyone have that keanu edit</br>  <br>re-encodes don't magically fix framerate problems in the source.</br>  <br>Was she being controlled or did it just screw her mind up? It didnt seem as if her actions were being directly manipulated. I always thought the item just caused her to go psycho and lose all sense of loyalty. More like it freed her from the setting of being loyal.</br>  Since the anime started airing, how many skeleton images have popped up?  <br>Read the novel</br>  <br>Correct, Overlord is sold as a legal novel, not a LN.</br>  <br>They're novel length but people still refer to it as LN due its root in WN category and the authors' "skill". He wasn't a writer or hadn't studied writing iirc, before trying his hand at storytelling on a web platform.</br>  <br>He wanted mage backup and she was the most magically inclined of the Pleiades. Yuri is a frontline brawler, Shizu is ranged, Entoma is freaky even in neutral, Solution is assassin, Dog is ignored.</br>  <br>He wanted someone who could look and act normal. He didn't know Narebel hated humans that much. Stop making shit up.</br>  <br>Obviously people here wouldn't know because they wouldn't even dream of BUYING something<br>It's bigger than a normal novel and costs about double too</br></br>  <br>Half the Pleiades could look normal but they don't look good paired with the dark knight Momon. Solution is the rogue/assassin and would be the best at deception.</br>  <br> It's bigger than a normal novel <br>Heavy novel confirmed</br></br>  Is there a huge difference between the LN and the manga?  <br>yes</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Massive, manga is only good for expressions and visuals and cuts out far more than the anime which is decent.</br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>I don't know</br>  <br>could you try asking the question again</br>  <br>LN is dark and gruesome.<br>Manga is full of comedy.</br></br>  Fuck, it's like some dudes role play with his self made characters.  <br>the first two episodes have been so boring, this is why you don't do a page for page, scene for scene LN adaption. it makes for terrible TV. <br><br>simply terrible. at this pace the anime will end with papa bones fighting shelltear.</br></br></br>  <br> at this pace the anime will end with papa bones fighting shelltear. <br>That's the idea nigga. Where you been?</br></br>  <br>Which is a good thing, since 4th and 5th volume serve as horrible places to stop. And going for 6/7 switchover would just be another Madan no Ou to Vanadis with similarly rushed shit job.</br>  <br> &gt;at this rate the anime will end in the best moment possible, oh noes </br>  When does papa bones talk/fight whit the lizards?, im tired already of the volumen 4, also where can i go to read the novel, or is it just in the drive google  <br>Vol 5 prologue and first chapter are already up on translators page.</br>  <br>nice, il try looking for them</br>  <br>The drive is behind releases by what, 2 months, either read it on sky's blog since he hosts it there or grab them from https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>thanks for the help, and also the links</br>  <br> &gt;at this rate the anime will end in the best moment possible, oh noes <br>not close. best moment was papa bones the "hero" displaying how he's really the demonlord of the world in the war against the lizardmen.</br></br>  <br>Uh, no, he kinda did. He know's Narberal's alignment.</br>  <br>no shit, for real? i need to pick up this right now, in what chapter is that?</br>  <br>there only is little difference</br>  <br>Lol</br>  <br>Narberal is the only one among Pleiades which more neutral into human. The rest of Plediades hate human very much, one of them even regards human as food.</br>  <br>Why would you do this, anon?</br>  <br>if you actually readed the LN, you should know that she hate them, she is like that because of papa bones, if not she would killed them all</br>  <br><br>Except Yuri, she actually likes humans along with Sebas.</br></br>  <br>No he didn't, he literally says "I didn't know she would be like this, should've brought Yuri instead."</br>  <br>ok, didn't meant to reply<br>sorry</br></br>  When does he meet the royal family anyway?<br><br>I need him to curb stomp those nobles<br><br><br>Also lizardmen evolving into dragons when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>volume 9</br>  <br> Also lizardmen evolving into dragons when? <br><br>Never, you'll have to do with hot and steamy lizard sex.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>you sir, made a great job, i truly admire you</br>    <br>I wonder if Entoma and Cocytus get offended by that.</br>    Seems like shitposters of the "I'll pretend I know what I'm talking about and spread misinformation" variety are at work.  <br>did the one who draw these also made Shikkoku no Sharnoth?<br><br>i don't like that face, it looks like a slut and she isn't one, don't destroy the best waifu</br></br></br>  Why is albedo so cute    Summary for Chapter 1 vol 9<br><br>Notice: The beginning of Volume 9 is the continuation of where Volume 7 left off.<br><br> Emperor of the Baharuth Empire, Jircniv Rune Farlord el Nix invites the two dark elf envoys to the palace after they kill off more than 100 elite guards in the Imperial Garden. The casualties include one of the Four Imperial Knights - Nazami Enec. Jircniv tries to extract information as well as prolong the negotiation time but fails due to Aura's threat to destroy the country if he does not hurry and apologizes to Ainz Ooal Gown.  </br></br></br></br>    <br>because she's the most pure of the 2 brides of papa bones<br><br><br>Damm, i want to know one thing, is it true that papa bones got a city or two?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Jircniv, with 20 elites guards, then travels to the newly built tomb that Aura constructed with the original purpose of warehousing. On the way, he talks about resurrection magic with Fluder Paradyne and finds out that while 5th-tier resurrection magic makes the revived objects lose vitality (meaning level drop), The Dragon Queen of Dragon Dukedom's wild magic can revive without loss of vitality. The discussion ends when Fluder comments that Wild Magic is from a completely different system so there is no way to confirm the theory. </br>  Can't wait to see the anime cover Shalltear's fight against Ainz. I hope most of the budget goes into that epic showdown.  <br> Upon arriving, he is surprised at the beauty of the battle maids and the wealth of Nazarick. When they see five Death Knight suddenly appear and form a line, Fluder immediately screams and the others become frantic. Even Jircniv's strongest guard, Leinas Rockbruise cannot stop trembling. Upon learning the Death Knight's strength and Yuri's confirmation that Ainz has absolute control over them, Jircniv now realized how powerful a magic caster he's meeting with, while Fluder laughs and faces the sky. He is even more surprised when so many races gathered in the throne room: dragons, demons, insects, demi-humans, etc while all of them seemingly possess significant power. He is actually less surprised seeing Ainz as undead since imagining a human ruling these monster would be odd. </br>  <br>No,  towns/villages at most iirc. He didn't lay out his domain that far, just to create a buffer zone around Nazarick .</br>  <br> After apologizing and blaming everything on Count Femel whose head he brought along, Ainz turned the dead Femel into a Death Knight right at the spot causing the envoy to be more fearful as he created a legendary Undead on the spot and with apparent ease. Leaving with heavy feelings, right in the carriage Jircniv calmly assessed the situation and suspects that Fluder had betrayed him. He silently seeks to recruit potentially powerful magic casters in the event he will have to replace Fluder; at the same time seeking to form a grand coalition against Ainz with Re-Estize Kingdom and Slane Theocracy. He also wants to gain an insider spy in Nazarick after seeing so many races in there. Jircniv thinks there should be at least one creature discontent with his position who would trade some information. </br>  <br> Ainz and the Guardians on the other hand already saw through Jircniv's betrayal thanks to Demiurge and laugh at how shallow minded he is. Shalltear suggests turning him into a vampire. However Ainz - using Demiurge's idea, has better plan: if Jircniv's intention is to form an Alliance with other countries, then Ainz just needs to show each country what will happen if anyone dares to oppose Nazarick.  </br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br>   if Jircniv's intention is to form an Alliance with other countries, then Ainz just needs to show each country what will happen if anyone dares to oppose Nazarick. <br><br>I assume that's what led to the massacre at the end of the volume.<br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>Shit, volume 9 translation when? I'm hyped as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In due time.</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br>Does anyone know if this is exactly what happened in the WN as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just cant get used to how much dialogue isnt in the novel. I'm too pampered by western novels which narrate most of the stuff happening with minimal dialogue  Who are the faggots who believe that just because  Nfirea can potentially use the Staff  means Ainz would ever let him get his hands on it. He'd be dead before that ever happened.<br>Fags.</br>  <br>Fucking Nips those sick ass mother fucker</br>  <br>Not exactly.<br>In WN Ainz never makes Nazarick an independent country.<br>The emperor befriend Ainz and makes him a noble in his empire not scheming against him with the 2 other countries.</br></br></br>  Ainz gonna use a super OP spell during war on volume 9.<br>Those Dark Young is way too overkill.</br>  <br>It sounds suitably terrifying though, for the people of the kingdom and empire.</br>  <br>It's ok; there's the sisters he saved and Sebas' future wife.<br><br>It makes up for rest.<br><br>Though I wonder what will happen to Ivileye.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems like Emperor's words didn't get to the fools in Kingdom soon enough. And I wonder how Gazef and Ranpossa and Raven even let that fiasco go through.</br>  FUCK.<br>Stop hyping me so much for volume 9, damnit.</br>  <br>especially since it will be two years from now until we get to there.</br>  <br><br>At this pace we are going to read it next year.

Didn't really have a Digimon waifu.<br>Closest was </br>  <br>No, OP, I wanted to BE Sora when I was little.   Not the name I chose, but little me would still be proud. </br>  I never thought about it until now, but you're probably right.  <br>I didn't really care, honestly.<br>This may come as a shock, but as a kid I watched Digimon for the monsters beating up monsters.</br></br>  <br><br>No, Sakura was. something about CCS gave me that feeling.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>This.

It was also my first experience of NTR too come to think of it.<br><br>Fuck Toei</br></br>  Reminder that those kids are our friends, not our waifu/husbando    She actually was my first waifu, I was like 5. When I turned 6 at the end of the year, I blew out my birthday candles and thought about Sora.<br>I guess my wish kinda came true. The next semester of Kindergarten a girl admitted she liked me and wanted to be my girlfriend, even gave me a heart-shaped rock she found during recess. I immediately chucked it back onto the playground and said I didn't want to be her boyfriend. We were still cool after that though.</br>  <br>Nice blog</br>  I liked Sailor Mars  Kari was my first waifu, although she looks pretty ugly in the official art to my current eyes. Fan art is another story.  <br>02 made her more delicious. What are you talking about?</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br> Kari's best girl. </br></br>    <br>On the one hand, you're probably the only one to give Miyako the time of day.<br>On the other hand,<br> being a Rukifag <br>disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, this was my waifu.

The DVD is finally out.  <br>I want to feel him.</br>  Is it only available physically? Not digitally on any Japanese sites?  <br>I literally just finished watching the first season 20 minutes ago. While I enjoyed it I don't think I can bring myself to watch the next.<br><br>I don't generally don't consider myself an edgy guy but I was rooting for Makashima nearly the entire time. I guess the ending is very Japanese in the fact that Akane values order above [spoilers]letting a collective of hundreds of sociopaths control every aspect of everyone's lives[/spoiler] but I don't agree and it left me with no characters I remotely like.<br><br>I literally have no desire to see any criminals get caught and Akane is a piece of shit. The only reason I would watch the next season is if the "bad guy" fucks up the Sibil system good. but I doubt whoever it is will be better than Makashima. Is 2 it worth checking out?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Akane is a piece of shit <br>I'M ONTO YOU</br></br>  <br> DVD <br>Fujo get out.</br></br>  <br>I have no idea who that is having not seen the second season.  sorry for screwing up the spoiler people who haven't watched it </br>  <br> Psycho-Pass will never have the protagonist it deserves <br><br>Also what the fuck is up with Ginoza. They keep acting like he's an important character but he barely gets any screentime after S1.</br></br></br>  <br>I generally had the same reaction as you, but when I rewatched it I realized how great Akane is.<br>Movie seems like it's mostly action and politics in Cambodia.<br><br> I don't generally don't consider myself an edgy guy but I was rooting for Makashima nearly the entire time. <br><br>It not that strange, it depends if the person values freedom over order. Butcher himself said that if he had to pick a side, he would join Makishima. <br><br> Is 2 it worth checking out? <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the last thing you see at the end of S1, in fact that is where the screencap is from.</br>  <br>some anon is uploading the raw as he said here </br>  <br>Okay, so that was basically the new Akane at the end. Wasn't on screen long.</br>  <br> s 2 it worth checking out? <br>Eh, if you want to gauge a small, japanese woman's gradual transformation into Judge Dredd.</br></br>  <br> They keep acting like he's an important character but he barely gets any screentime after S1. <br>Probably for fujobait</br></br>  Where were you when Moria cucked arlong and joined the revs to take revenge on the WG.  <br>I don't think a fleet commander counts as recurring or important though. Realistically hes not going to travel with an entire fleet, most likely anyone in his fleet will just do their own thing and then show up at the final battle when Luffy needs them.</br>  <br>She'll just constantly wreck the sunny.</br>  <br>http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Sabo<wbr><br> Sabo left for the harbor on a flock of ravens. </br></wbr></br>  All signs point to Bellamy joining.
