[ ITT The most badass moments of manga        Best exchange I can think of.    big, but you have to see the whole thing.      A cheesy one, but I always loved this page.          <br>I've never noticed this before, but for someone who's been through hell, Guts has really nice teeth.</br>    This guy is so strong that by just flexing his muscles he creates shockwaves that make his enemies explode.  <br>essentially perfect, yes.</br>  <br>As shit and twisted Naruto became. Madara was saving the ending with his baddass'ness. Too bad he got rediculous then culled as well.</br>  I was screaming like a little girl out of joy.  <br>Meaning every time he moved at all he would kill everyone around him?<br><br>Shit writing is shit.</br></br></br>  <br>based madara</br>  <br>You dont understand anything. Thats the secret technique it isn't like every time he moves he does it. Fucking baka</br>  This entire arc was the best thing that's ever happened to me  <br>As badass as he was in the whole manga and for all the shit he actually did he looks gay as fuck in this panel.<br><br>But still looks hella good</br></br></br>  <br>Oops</br>    <br> he looks gay as fuck in this panel. </br>    <br> This guy is so strong that by just flexing his muscles he creates shockwaves that make his enemies explode. <br><br>Going off your description.<br><br>Also, what causes the shockwave? His muscles themselves tensing and moving the inch or so at max? So that convulsion of the muscle is so fast it's causing a shockwave? Doesn't this make it a massive waste of time? If he is capable of creating that large of shockwave from simply tensing, why not just whip his arms or something, creating a much larger, faster movement resulting in a stronger shockwave?<br><br>Again, shit writing is shit. The ability makes zero sense beyond "HE SO SUPER STRONK HE ONLY TENSE AND EXPLODE EVERY1!!!!!11!!1"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mourn Lara Croft </br>    easy    <br> not the " don't be popping a boner over my head" <br><br><br>I prefer the one with Jill when she attempte to join Guts</br></br></br></br>    <br>The war arc was one of the worst arcs I've ever read in Naruto, all the way from the Kage summit right through until the final chapter. <br><br>But it could have been redeemed if Madara had just murked everyone, including Naruto and Sasuke, without absorbing the Jyuubi or the tree and without Kaguya existing and without any stupid fucking god-powers. <br><br>Hashirama could've defeated Madara to end the series. We didn't need some bull shit god-power up, Kaguya, or Sasuke and Naruto's horrifically anti-climactic gundam battle.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Ever read in manga, I mean.</br>  I feel for all the tomboys in the world who were born with huge tits and have to carry unnecessary additional weight when doing sports and feel embarassed when someone compliments them on their huge funbags  I'll always stand behind them to support that weight.  <br><br>No oppai!</br></br>  <br>why not? they are good at all sizes</br>  <br>I think that there is nothing more beautiful than a tomboy with generous mammary glands.</br>  <br>On 7th grade in PE class a friend said "even if you fell you'd have nice airbags" and I felt extremely ashamed, he then felt bad and I felt bad. That's the end of the blogshit for today.</br>  what about tomboy butts?  <br>airbags are to be appreciated and admired in silence and from a distance with a dick in your hand. unless you're married</br>  <br>You know what? Even if you fell you'd have nice airbags.</br>  <br>It's weird, even nowadays I'll always prefer a flat chest. Be it on tomboys (best girls) or other types of girls.<br><br>Damn, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>girls these days in 7th grade would file a lawsuit for sexual harassment over that comment and then go to their tumblr hugbox to get comforted by their SJW army. i hope you did none of this and instead were thankful</br>  <br>Jesus fucking christ man, said friend wasn't even being rude or anything (still short and slim until this day), I thought he was nice and just making conversation; of course dumblr would think otherwise. Other than me feeling ashamed at first, I was and am cool with it.</br>  <br>You must have been a very fat boy.</br>  <br>42kg pure fat.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128323443 <br> tbh <br>Don't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well done.  got you to blog a bit more about your tits  </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128323637 <br> &gt;&gt;out </br>  manyuu hikenchu was essentially an anime about slicing off breasts. would you watch an anime about slicing off dicks?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128323637 <br>Like I said, don't.<br><br>Well shit.

Delinquents have long skirts.</br>  I actually have a friend IRL who has somewhat above-average tits who's a bit of a tomboy. She's not sure whether she wants a reduction or a tattoo for her 19th birthday. On one hand, considering the back problems she's had because of them, she'd definitely be better off getting the reduction, but I kinda want to talk her into getting a tattoo of  the Joestar family birthmark.   I love busty tomboys because they have the right combination of femininity and boyishness.<br>Busty tomboys that have no shame about their assets are best because other girls can make fun of them for acting so un-ladylike but they can't deny the awesomeness of their breasts.<br>The girls that can flip the switch between bro and seductress are the greatest.</br></br>  Tomboys with big tits have nothing on reverse traps with big tits.    <br>She wouldn't be able to perform a lethal super 180Â° kick with a long skirt.</br>  <br>What about not getting any tattoo at all?</br>      Chifusa is a miracle of the universe.

The hearts are only inside her pupils.  Originally I wasn't that into Anna, since she seemed like she'd be the student council president who doesn't like lewd things archetype.<br><br>Then these last two episodes showed there was more to her than that. She's so pure that she has little to no actual knowledge on anything lewd, and she may end up being very receptive to that. I hope very much to see her corruption into a pervert.<br><br>Also, I don't know what the official name is for censoring like this, but I'm actually liking this style.</br></br></br></br>  I need Hiryuu to hurry the fuck up.<br>Or is clawhammer acceptable?</br>  <br>Isnt it just HS slapped onto uncensored version?<br><br>Wait for Hiryuu</br></br></br>  you think anyone is gonna translate the manga or 8 light novels now that this show is out?  <br>it's called mormon bubbling</br>  <br>It's called bubbing.

As a result it's become a meme in Japan and has shown up in doujins, manga, and more recently in non-h TV shows and films.</br></br>  <br>Damn, are those rooms a common thing in Japan? Since it looks comfy as fuck to have a pool like that and I refuse to believe that the porn makers actually went through the trouble to build their own pools.</br>  <br><br>The building it's in was made back in the late 80s before the economy crumbled. It's a product of 80s excess that still endures.</br></br>  So MC is going to end up with white hair or black hair?  <br>When will the economy go back to making those?</br>  <br>It's a pool that was used in a lot of AV's.<br><br>It's part of a very expensive high rise apartment (that now, nobody can afford, but cheap porn producers can rent.)<br><br>Its nickname translates to "that pool". It's a meme in Japan because it was so common.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Black Hair. MC's don't end with the girl they have a crush on, they end with the girl they discover to love later on. It's like a law in mango/animu. Just like what Komi is doing with Nisekoi.</br>  <br> MC's don't end with the girl they have a crush on <br>Dude this happens all the time.</br></br>  <br>Name three examples.</br>  <br><br>Name 3 examples of that happening. We are talking with a Harem MC having a crush at the beggining of the animu, not getting the crush along the animu. That crush never gets canon.</br></br>  <br>We need perverts like YOU.</br>  <br> Dude this happens all the time. <br>Chew you havisfaction a singlelicious satisfact to snack that up?</br></br>  <br>anyone have the uncensored version?</br>  <br><br>Is there even an uncensored version?</br></br>  <br><br>Nourin, Baka no test, DxD?</br></br>  <br>Of the OP? No. Funi has added a couple extra censors, but a lot of them were there to begin with.</br>  <br>DxD is harem but I agree with the others.</br>  <br>Nourin MC ends up with both girls, Akihisa from Bakatest ends up with his dream girl Himeji.</br>  <br>MC here could end with both also no? The focus here is different from something like Nisekoi after all.</br>  <br>No, the situation is "MC is in love with one girl but ends up loving another one later"</br>  <br>Thanks Picard.</br>  <br> DxD is harem <br>Yeah I was iffy with that one. I also don't remember if he liked Rias before the anime started since his crush started once he saw her in the balcony I believe.</br></br>  <br>There was even a book published about that pool.<br>http://www.amazon.co.jp/ä¾ã®ãã¼ã«-ä¾ã®ãã¼ã«<wbr>ç ç©¶ä¼/dp/4757222750</wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh I see, yeah those only go one way.</br>  <br>White Album 2 says hi</br>  <br><br>A collection of assorted scenes shot at that pool:<br><br> http://minkchan.com/blog-entry-2432<wbr>.html</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the situation is "MC is in love with one girl but she abducts him and wants to keep him in her closet to cultivate their love"</br>  Oh man, imagine living in a world where all the girls are sexually repressed and curious.<br><br>Goddamn.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh my, even Maria Ozawa shot some scenes there LOL</br></br>    A kiss awakens the lewd inner slut of a pure woman <br>What would happen if anon got kissed?

So if the romantic crush was whom the MC interacted the most with in the first couple of arcs, he ends up with her. <br><br>However, if the MC gets up to his shenanigans with another girl in an attempt to get closer to his crush, it's likely that he'll end up with that girl instead. <br><br>Unfortunately. I'm guessing either an open-ended ending, or MC+vice prez pair, gorilla/single end for president, and the scientist+artist form a doujin circle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never noticed how much Anna resembles Ajimu.</br>  Is it true that you can find protein samples in your Urin after beating it?<br>I imagine after pissing two times everything should begone.</br>  <br>This is a comedy. A comedy with a really far off absurd premise. 3p end, joke harem end, and even gay ends are more probable than people think.<br><br>I wouldn't even be surprised if this shit ended with MC becoming the prime minister.</br></br></br>  <br> 3p end, joke harem end, and even gay ends are more probable than people think. <br><br><br>If by more probably, you mean 5% chance compared to 1% chance, then maybe. <br><br>But the ratio of those ends you mentioned vs a straight male-female pairing end is probably like 1 to 20.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A straight hetero end or an open-ended conclusion. Those are common too unfortunately.</br>  <br> open-ended <br>This is like handing me a plate promising me food, but it having nothing on it so I can imagine all the tasty food that might've been there.</br></br>  <br> LOL </br>  <br>Too small of an increase.<br>I'd at least say it goes up to 6~% from .5%.<br><br>How absurd the series is dictates the chances of the other endings. Assuming a series hasn't made it blatantly obvious that it's going for a harem end, then the chances of the other aforementioned endings happening can potentially rise up to 25% versus the usual main girl or open ended shit. Omnibus endings lack data.<br><br>Source: My well-renowned ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Waiting for Hiryuu.  <br>Yeah, but they didn't give you a dish you hate the taste of so you can't rightfully complain about their cooking.</br>  <br>Couldn't find the pool in Shimoneta Ep 2</br>  <br><br> it's turning into a harem </br></br>  NTR<br><br>NTR<br><br>NTR</br></br></br></br>  Why is scientist not in the gang yet?

Fusion and Synchro feel almost useless at times because of the difference in power and they only have a handful of cards that are actually decent. Synchro is a tad better off though since they're a little easier to get out in most archetypes, but they're starting to quickly fall behind. <br><br>Making most of the Rank 4 Xyz Rank 5 or making them require 3 Tributes would fix a lot of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If the effects aren't good enough, or the costs aren't high enough, people won't buy Xyz and just keep using Synchros. <br> If the effects are TOO good, though, then it guarantees sales at the sealed level! We can always hit the shit in the banlist if it gets too out of control. <br>What Konami didn't realize is that this path of logic only works if you have a handful of overly-useful generic cards. By the time the phrase "Rank 4 Toolbox" had been coined, Konami had already lost the war.</br></br></br>  <br>Why'd Konami decide to abandon Synchro and kept on shilling Xyz? What happened?</br>  <br>Sadly I'd have to agree, I honestly imagine that either the game is going to get so ridiculous that it tanks on itself after another summoning method from the next YGO or they're going to have to do a hard or complete reboot on the whole scene, even if they try to adopt both the OCG and TCG.<br><br>Because they gotta sell those new cards and instead of balancing the cards around existing cards, they just give them stupid power creeped effects so they are for sure to sell and call it a day.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not entire sure, but I imagine that Xyz snowballed, and if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.<br><br>Xyz were doing well, so there was no reason to do anything with Synchro.  Although they did print Phonon Pulse Dragon in Primal Origins, which in my opinion is one of the better Synchro Tuners. </br></br></br>  <br>Any summon method can be great, only need good support cards/archetypes.<br><br>I'm a Synchro scum because I love permanent effects and all that awesome plays from the Infernity Era.</br></br></br>  <br>Just the new cards that sell, they're starting to abandon that and go to Pendulum now, though they're still trying to create a few here and there. <br><br>YGO really needs multiple formats or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I have yet to actually find any real application of Clear Wing beyond cockblocking Superheavies and Nekroz of Trish, which are both easily dealt with because YOU HAVE TO FUCKING PUT CLEAR WING ON THE BOARD FIRST, TELEGRAPHING WHAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO.</br>  <br> if you can't beat then join them <br>I can see it happening to pendulums soon. The pendulum magicians engine is insanely cohesive, even when they can't OTK you they can stall like mad and non-destruction removal are limited.</br></br>  <br>That's a problem with a lot of the Arc-V decks and aces actually. They're too telegraphed.</br>  <br>Qlis and IgKnights are like that too, if you can't set shit up super quick you can stall like crazy.</br>  Normal Summon, Gemini Summon, Flip Summon, Special Summon, Tribute Summon, Syncrho Summon, XYZ Summon, XYZ Chaos Change, <br><br>How many summons can summons</br></br>  <br>Clear Wing is good if your opponent is stupid and thinks they can Castel you.</br>  <br>Alchemy Summon, Rank Up Summon, Graveyard Summon, Banish Summon, Summon Summon</br>  Why was this ever made? It's a counter to literally everything in the game.  <br>Kisses everywhere should calm him down<br>I'd approach it that way even if it doesn't</br></br>  <br>Because it can actually be dealt with pretty easily honest, at least in my experience. I use the deck and I love it and it definitely works wonders, but Dark Law can be dealt with, and HERO decks start getting iffy the more you cycle through your low amount of monsters and they get sacked quite fast if you aren't drawing what you specifically need at the right time.</br>  <br> Everything <br>What are Ritual Beasts?</br></br>  <br>  Macro Cosmos on legs for your opponent. <br>  Any dark deck can SS it <br>  Screws up people's hands after searching <br>Nah man its fair as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>An archetype that durdles but doesn't get anywhere?</br>  <br> Any dark deck can summon it <br><br>As long as you have a HERO sure.</br></br></br>  <br> https://twitter.com/yugioh_anime/s<wbr>tatus/622968650887118851</wbr> <br>I need the Yugi one.</br></br>    Zuzu isn't that bad of a name imo.  <br>  Although I'm legitimately terrified about what they'll do to the Ruri and Yuya clones' names.  </br>  <br> what is mask change II </br>  <br>People give Performapals shit, but 3 Friendonkey, Pinch Helper, and Revival make cards like Performapal Swordfish pretty silly, and that's before you take into account shit like Pendulum Summoning proc'ing Fish's effect. Then you combine it with OEPD and the Gazers and you easily get tons of damage.<br><br><br> Superheavies can't do much without Big Benkei or Susano-O on the field, and without Shutendoji, they have no real outs to S/Ts that might slow down or stop them. <br> Melodious suffer from having too much good shit to run and not enough search power to guarantee any plays. A good hand may as well have been pendulum summoned, but a bad hand can't even Set 1 and Pray. <br> RaidRaptors are actually good, but with the current TCG cardpool, they suffer from massive consistency issues despite their inherent search power being pretty decent. Also all of their good monsters are 3-material Xyz, which means "play 2+ Vanishing Lanius a turn or fall back on your R4 Toolbox". <br> Performapals have solid battle phase plays and good BP utility, but are absolutely trash if your opponent doesn't battle, or has ways to get around your battle. Also suffers from bricking fairly routinely. <br> Fluffals lack the search power they need, and don't have Scissor Tiger in TCG, making them entirely useless most of the time, with one of the best plays still being Scissor Wolf + Fusion Weapon. <br> Phantom Knights aren't printed and likely won't ever be. <br> Sybils and Aqua Actresses feel more like support archetypes than standalone archetypes, even with both having boss monsters. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>u jist mad cuz u r bad</br>  <br> durdles <br>Cute word</br></br>  <br>I don't know why you would be running Dark Law without having Shadow Mist and just running Mask Change instead of Mask Change II, but yeah you're right, that does work.<br><br>RR suffer extreme mass consistency issues even with their OCG cards, they're a little better off, but they can stuffed unless you resort to Rank 4, because some of the decks just get Xyz out so fast that it just quickly trumps Strix and then you have to rely on hoping to get Rank Ups and other things quickly and sometimes you need to blow spells just to keep your small guys alive in the meantime.</br></br></br>  <br>  SHS have no real outs to S/Ts that might slow down or stop them. <br>Nusu-10 is a thing too.<br><br>also, relying on the big bosses is what you're supposed to. It's how they want you to play it.</br></br></br></br>  When did this become /dng/?  <br>There's a bit of a difference between relying on a boss monster and "if you don't have a boss or one of his offshoots on the board you are doing incredibly poorly and need to get on that".</br>  <br>About the same time I fell in love with you</br>  <br>This convo is actually logical and extremely tame compared to /dng/. Besides it usually happens in spurts when we've got nothing to talk about or when half the characters aren't posting any arguing at each other.</br>  Ok I have a really shitty question about Pendulum.<br>In Ygopro/Devpro I can't place a pendulum card in the Red Zone before having one in the blue one. However this rule doesn't seem to be written on the rulebook.<br><br>What I want to know is: can I place only one Pendulum card on the RED zone pr do I have to place it on the BLUE one like in Ygopro/depro ?</br></br></br>  <br>  tits or gtfo  </br>  <br>YGOPro doesn't give the option because cards don't have different scales yet.</br>  <br>You should be able to place them on either one, but I don't think it really matters if you're only placing one at a time. I've noticed it doesn't really matter which one you place them in, but maybe I'm just blind.</br>  <br>Auto card placing</br>  <br>Wait... Does that mean I can Pendulum summon by setting one 8 scale and THEN a 1 scale ?!<br>If it's the case I played like shit for a while.</br></br>  <br> anime about a card game <br> expect people to not talk about the card game <br>you stupid or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you can set them in any order, I do it all the time with IgKnights.</br>  <br>I feel so fucking dumb.

It's finally over. Ending was satisfactory, but the overall show was still shit.   ignored the show since day 1, because fuck "hurr an ep every 2 weeks" <br> now can watch through it in one go </br>  I'm amazed you made it through the end. Congratulations.   Chibi Usa goes off to help Sailor Moon <br> Other senshi mention that they should probably go with her <br> Queen just shakes her head "no" <br><br>Inner senshi get shafted yet again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm amazed myself. I wanted to drop it halfway through the first cour, I stuck with it because I wanted to fully see how the adaptation would turn out. <br><br> "We got close to a perfect adaptation of the manga so what is there to complain about?" <br><br> I fucking hate MAL.</br></br></br></br></br>    Knew when I saw ep 1 it would be a pale shadow of the original. Both openers have exactly the same plot but direction/cinematography of the original is miles ahead.      <br>Now that Crystal has ended, maybe in another 20 years we will get the reboot that Sailor Moon deserves. It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu which in itself was following the manga plot but differed later on.</br>      <br> another 20 years <br><br>Everything about that would be fine but I just don't want to wait another 20 years for it.</br></br></br>      <br>Rejoice, at least your children can watch it.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>        <br>If it did happen, by the time it came out my children would probably be too old to give a shit.</br>      why did this turn out so shit but dragon ball super turned out good?  <br>No idea. Toei dropped the ball on this and Saint Seiya.</br>  <br><br>Because Toei doesn't give a shit about any properties other than Dragon Ball.</br></br>  <br>That's why Tri will fail. I already lost all hope for it when it turned from tv series to movie series.</br>  What arcs did the anime cover, put the show on hold around ep 10 because the directing got very bad and the pacing got shit on hard.  <br>Dark Kingdom and Black Moon. Don't bother watching the rest though.</br>  <br> It's finally over. <br>There is a "See you soon" at the end and a planed announcement though</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Hey, were these characters in the show? Cool.</br></br></br></br>  At least the Black Moon arc was better as a whole. Black Lady is still best girl.  <br>Crystal is an ONA. It has a lower budget. DBS is on tv with a higher budget.</br>  <br>When is this announcement supposed to be?</br>  <br><br>They haven't said. It'll probably be a few weeks or months.</br></br>  I don't get it. The director, producer, and composer had all done great things before (and even together, with Suite Precure.)<br><br>It has to have been some sort of higher-up decision to make the show the way it was. Probably the same people who decided to make Tri into a handful of movies and give DBS a hundred fucking episodes.</br></br>  <br>This man. I liked it, and it made me like Chibiusa more than I did before from watching the old show and reading the manga</br>  Venus and Tuxedo Mask were literally the only likable characters in this mess.  <br>they got shafted the whole time in this show<br><br>not even the 90s show did that as bad as crystal</br></br></br>  <br>Missed out on the announcement of a planned announcement, but yes I was aware of the "see you soon" at the end. When I said "it's finally over" I was referring to the fact that this travesty of a show was over...for now and whether a second season was coming was up in the air based on what I had read earlier. The rumor I read that a second season was in the works was called a mistake at the time. I guess that is not the case now.</br>  <br> ONA <br> Lower budget <br><br>No excuse. There are other ONAs that were produced in the past that look way better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think toei is focusing on DBS so their budget has to shift <br>when they finish that you can bet sailor moon crystal s will come</br></br>  Were there any songs at all other than the OP and ED?<br><br>By this time in the original series, we had insert songs like Ai no Senshi, Eien no Melody, Koibito ni Hanarenai Kedo, etc.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much just run of mill background music and for more dramatic moments they played a children's choir.</br>  My dream would be to see a 90's style Sailor V anime.<br>I think expanding the story would work as well as it did with the 90's anime.</br>  <br>why was the background in crystal so lame and unispirsing <br><br>the original series upbeat 90s jazz and pop sounding music were great <br><br>why couldnt they hire back that composer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's dead</br>  but he is a skull in every other iteration    Finally the show which don't exist ended.  <br>Doubt it. It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake. They probably hoped fans would forget about the anime and shat out the cheapest possible series to calm them down at the end. Toei only cares about currently hyped endless series, sadly.</br>  <br>the constant delays should have tipped us off really</br>  <br>Does it even make sense for them to do s2? I guess s1 sold like 50 BDs or something. Or did the ONA have high ratings?</br>  <br>It had more than 2k preorders before the show even came out. They didn't lose money on it, but yeah there really is no reason to make an S2.</br>  <br><br><br>If Toei put more work into it, by the time they got to Stars, people would be asking them to adapt the musicals, Sailor V, or new story arcs.<br>They really goofed on what could have been their greatest cash cow of the decade.<br>I still hope Toei finishes it though. It would be more of a disappointment to end after the Black Moon arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  i only watched the first 13, was the show in its entirety worse than the original sailor moon?  <br>It's supposed to be more like the manga.</br>  <br>Oh God. Oh God what is that. <br>This is a frame from Crystal? Jesus Christ I'm so glad I dropped it early.</br></br>  <br>yeah i know i read the manga but its not necessarily better</br>  <br><br>All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. The shittenou got an even worse treatment in it.</br></br>  <br>Fuckin' joke's on you, mate</br>    lor<br> All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. <br><br>Thank you. This, right fucking here. Naoko Takeuchi and her publishers were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.</br></br></br>  <br>If Sailor Moon Crystal had been released today without the history of the 90's anime, the manga, and all the nostalgia that goes along with it to back it up, it would have came and went with barely a blip on anyone's radar.</br>  <br><br>I posted both of these, I just had more to add.</br></br>  <br>Ayyy</br>  Which Sailor Senshi takes it in the ass the best?  <br>Toei just wanted the keep the rights to the Sailor Moon anime which was in danger of expiring.</br>  <br>Mars.</br>  <br>Do you really have to ask.</br>  <br> no La Soldier <br> Act 26: shit <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KDy<wbr>59hBJ-Cw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you for making me want to read more Black Dog doujins. <br/></br>  Did  Luna's human form  show up again since that episode?  <br>Not in anime, but in manga during Dream arc (Super S of original anime) all cats show up in their human forms.</br>  They even gave her the wrong brooch.        JUST TOUCH YOUR MOON 3 TIMES WITH YOUR NIPPLE PANTS AND YOU GOT YOURSELF UHH MCMUFFIN  <br> It's finally over. <br>So when will Togashi get off hiatus?</br></br>  http://sailormooncrystalfailures.tu<wbr>mblr.com/</wbr>   you postponed your suicide for this   <br> dragon ball super turned out good </br>  <br> Suite Precure <br> good thing </br></br>    <br>The queen knows the senshi are useless in Crystal.</br>  <br> filename </br>  So if Neo Queen Serenity and King Endymion are the future Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, why don't they remember what their past selves went through?  <br><br>That rumor has no evidence supporting it. Quit spouting it everywhere.</br></br>  <br><br>Heartcasuals please go.</br></br>  <br>I think it was because the Crystal anime was trying to see if they can do something with it but decided in the end to trash it because it would take a lot of rewriting and they don't have the time and budget for it. Takeuchi always said that there were plotlines she wanted to do but wasn't able to do due to time constraints with the manga. The SeraMyu musicals did play with some of the plotlines I heard. <br><br>Maybe if Toei didn't treat the franchise like a red-headed stepcousin and gave it the SM franchise the treatment it deserved, we wouldn't regret how bland Crystal turned out to be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He is half right that Toei did want to prevent losing the IP property of the anime because they were still making bank from memorabilia and re-releases of the 1992-96 anime. Takeuchi would probably on the verge of suing them until they threw a little bit of money for the budget to keep her happy and not cut into their funds. They weren't interested in marketing it to anyone other than the 25-35 year old women who grew up on PSSM.</br></br>  Wait, why did they only made classic, R and no S onwards.  Crystal looked so bad honestly. Liked I know it's based more off the manga but I read the damn manga and in my opinion it was drawn very cute and pretty. Usagi was willowy not a bug eyed spaghetti beast. Crystal seriously took whatever life was in Sailor Moon and sucked it out with shit animation , shit pacing , and shit characterization. Compared to the 90's anime I'm aware the manga wasn't as fleshed out but still it had more vitality than this crap. I honestly wouldn't have minded if it looked more like pic related. At least that looks like it could be fun.   No outer senshi <br><br>okay</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Cu<wbr>A1ov1-Pk</wbr>  [ ]  <br> wanting the outer senshi to be desecrated in Crystal too <br>Thank god they were saved by not appearing in the first two arcs.</br></br>  <br>If you were nearly 1000 years old, you would have a hard time remembering everything you did as a teenager.</br>  <br>True. But I would have liked to see more Haruka and Michiru lesbian shenanigans.</br>  Would you rather have more Crystal episodes or this? <br>https://<span>youtu.be/ODz7ankdTHw  [ ]</br>  <br>neither?</br>  <br>Saban Moon easily.</br>   crystal's animation    900+ years old <br> Goes to train under her 14-year-old-mom <br> Queen mom tells Pluto never to stop time but sends kid back to play with past self on a whim. <br><br>How did this retard family get put in charge?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The time travel in Sailor Moon is fucking weird. NQS and King Endymion seem to act like the stuff with the Black Moon and future villains never happened to them UNTIL it happen in the main time line... (ie. The events of the original series -&gt; time jump of peace -&gt; crystal tokyo with no events of R, S, SuperS or Stars happening) almost like they're from an alternate future and yet events in the past (current manga time) directly affect the future.<br><br>Like with NQS's weapon, she only just gets the Spiral Heart Moon Rod there at the end of Black Moon and yet if her future followed the direct timeline of the entire manga, she should already have her Eternal Tiare from the end of Stars.<br><br>Basically, Naoko made it up as she went along and didn't look that far into the future with properly connecting the past-future.</br></br></br></br></br>  Which senshi has best butt?  <br>I like how there's different music depending on who's singing and they're dancing to their own "theme" at the beginning.</br>    <br> exclusive at hhtp://shitty hentai sitedotcom <br><br>Why is this still a thing?</br></br></br>  <br>This is the kind of thing Crystal could have explained better.<br><br>There are a lot of "mysteries" in the manga.<br>One is what the "Pets" are in Sailor V. I think they're from Mau and other animal planets, but there's no evidence of that. They get 3 chapters and it's never explained where they're from or why they're collecting energy. They're probably connected with Stars somehow, since Naoko wrote the chapters at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> both parents have blue eyes <br> mother is a blonde <br> father has black hair <br> grandmother has blue hair <br> grandfather and uncle have light brown looking hair <br> come out with pink hair and red eyes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Queen Serenity and Neo Queen Serenity are different people, and Pluto dying from stopping time is probably the same as Usagi dying if she uses the power of the Silver Crystal too much.</br></br>  <br> not a single lewd leg or ass cheek shot of her unlike the others <br>Prude apologetic shit, that's what Crystal is.</br></br>  <br>considering that they were fucking with us for 2 fucking years before they actually started the damn thing and showed that damn image, yeaaaaaaah i dont see a continuation anytime sooner.<br><br>this was a fuckolossal disaster</br></br></br>  <br>All for a rabbit pun</br>  <br>Usagi </br>    <br><br><br>On those lines, if the originally planned Sailor V anime had been made, the exact same thing would apply.<br><br>The only reason Sailor Moon as such exists is because Toei wanted to create their own sentai maigcal girl show and took the opportunity to ride on the back of the name of Takeuchi's Sailor V when its anime never panned out. While Naoko's manga technically came first, it was never the reason for the genesis of the series proper or the success of the original show, which would have been spawned in an alternate form anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Oh god it would be such a delicious trainwreck if it had come to fruition. I would seriously pay cash to get the pilot to show up somewhere.</br>    <br>You should give the new musicals a go.</br>  Did ShitennouxSenshi happen?  So it's pretty much confirmed that the original &gt; crystal right?  <br>Been that way since like episode 6.</br>    I know the art made it terrible, but it was much more than that. What do you think it was that bad it shit?  I can not get enough of these Babies and manchildren who thought sailor moon crystal is bad. Stop being such a bitter nerd that you have to loudly profess your dislike for something that, by the way, doesn't affect your life at all???? wow whoa???? Keep crying tears about how this series pales to the ~original~, I've taken off my rose-tinted glasses long ago and look ahead towards what the future holds.    <br> It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu <br><br>You have no idea how hard my boner is for that idea. I cum buckets just thinking about how awesome something like that actually being made would be. It would BTFO of all other anime pretty much by default.</br></br></br>  So this was supposed to follow the manga but then the show only ends half way through it? What the fuck bullshit! I was waiting to see Chibi Chibi and Sailor Cosmos.   the animation was never this   good <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lXh<wbr>-u9MuEmE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>So the abomination is finally dead. Rest in peace once more, Sailor Moon. Now to focus our energy on forgetting this ever happened, just like Drunker than Hobo.</br>  I cant' wait for the fixed designs in the BDs. Because they will be fixed, right?  Wait, is Pluto dead and not coming back? I wanted a happy ending.  <br>watching sailor shit.</br>  Second part was much better than the first at least. <br><br><br><br>Well it's very dated and hasn't aged well.</br></br></br></br>    <br> It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake <br>Gee I couldn't tell with this WONDERFUL animation quality</br></br>  <br>Honestly, only having to see it raped a couple times a month was better. I bet you drop it after episode 4 trying to marathon it.</br>     Hotaru is waifu since forever <br> just want to see her animated and an animated transformation <br><br>Game transformation doesn't count.<br><br>Was there a reason the old anime didn't animate Hotaru properly? They cut her out of SuperS and other things then just had her back for a moment in Stars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The staff literally didn't know what was going on during SuperS for a schedule problem so Ikuhara and the team improvised, what mean more sexual innuendo, surreal imaginery, bizarre humor and other shit Ikuhara loves. Stars was mess from the beginning to the end and nobody mattered except for Usagi and the starlights, especially Seiya</br>  So there's really only 26 total episodes in Crystal and covers both the Dark Kingdom and Black Moon arcs? I'm watching the original and there's about 90 episodes between the two arcs. What gives? Is there no character development at all?  <br>It took a few months to make a new manga chapter, so there were a lot of episodes in between. Crystal is one episode per chapter.</br>  <br>They had to make a lot of filler while waiting for the manga to move. That filler is so damn worth it though as you are probably seeing already since it really helps really establish the characters and the anime staff managed to have subplots and such going on.<br><br> Is there no character development at all? <br><br>For anyone not named Usagi, Mamoru, and Chibiusa (with Pluto getting some focus), pretty much. The other 4 girls basically lose all their character after becoming guardians.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still no Sailor V animu <br> no Super/SuperS/Stars remake <br>disappointment.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>Sailor V needs an anime.</br>  <br><br>There is a Sailor V anime though.</br></br>    Who /dropped/ here.<br><br>I stopped watching as soon as mars hit the building and never looked back.<br><br>I got best senshi and that was good enough for me.</br></br></br></br>  How do I get through Sailor Moon R? I want to enjoy it but it's somehow not nearly as entertaining as the first season.<br><br>Maybe the 9 month break since I last saw an episode will help.</br></br>  <br> I got best senshi <br>She's not showing up for quite a few more episodes.</br></br>   tfw the original sailor moon is still better, even if it looks like shit   <br>looks better than crystal</br>    <br>Dropped mid episode 2. I couldn't take the soulless animation. Even the manga had goofy faces, why couldn't SMC have any??</br>  <br>It got some during the Black Moon arc. They looked really out of place though.</br>  <br>Nah, this is done. Sailor Moon goes back to sleep probably for good. If they couldn't attract a new audience, why bother?</br>  <br>Stick with it, it picks up after the alien arc, then you have the God tier S to look forward to</br>  <br>Pretty fucking much.</br>  I think Toei will surprise us.  <br>Surprise us with a quality presentation for S, SuperS, and Stars arcs? I would love to see that. <br><br>I would even forgive them for giving Sailor Saturn an actual transformation sequence as well.</br></br></br>  <br>please no more</br>      PRUDE SHIT<br>R<br>U<br>D<br>E</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes and it was terrible.</br>  can shiki kill sailor moon  <br> over <br>didn't they announce another 2 cour?</br></br>  <br>They meant the Black Moon arc would be on TV.<br>I hope Toei finishes the next 3 arcs and Sailor V too.</br></br>  I liked it okay, I just wish the animation didn't jump around from alright to pure shit.<br><br>The very last episode ends with "See you soon" and they've announced that they're making an announcement. So it may yet be continued. If it is I hope like hell they do a better job on the next season. So much wasted potential.</br></br>  <br> Sailor V <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Ugh yes.</br>  <br>Definitely.<br><br>Crystal is a nice little treat. I mean as shitty as it was in spots I still appreciate that it was made. But it can in no way be compared to the original series.</br></br></br>  <br>-the horrible animation<br>-the stupid 1 episode ever 2 to 3 weeks<br>-the fact that they only spent one 22 minute episode per entire manga chapter so that the story had to be rushed through so fast you barely have time to comprehend what the fuck just happened<br>-the fact that they damn near don't even let them fight because the budget is just too tight for all that animation<br>-the fact that they lose virtually every fight<br>-the fact that they decided to shoehorn in a stupid "MARS MERCURY VENUS AND JUPITER WERE IN LOVE WITH JAEDITE, NEPHRITE, ZOISITE AND KUNZITE" subplot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh man I didn't even realize the show was being made the same time the manga was. I see why there was so much filler now but yeah definitely worth it. I love all the characters' personalities and personal stories.</br></br>  <br> announced that they're making an announcement <br>I love when they do this. I hope the announcement will be  about how they're going to make an announcement later, because yo dawg I herd u like announcements </br></br>    <br>Aha I just watched that episode. I actually liked the alien arc but it's become almost tedious to watch during the Black Moon arc. As  mentioned, I at least have S to look forward to!</br>  Just a reminder that the toku did a better job with the story than Crystal<br><br> No seriously, if you haven't watched it, you should. It's really damn good. </br></br>  <br>why didn't the toku get a second season :( they would've done such a good job with R</br>  <br>Didn't it kind of totally end? It had like two epilogues or something. It was going in a different direction in the manga anyway</br>  Can I just say that Crystal's version of Jupiter is fucking awful.<br><br>I mean, I know most of them are bad but it hurts especially with Makoto</br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br><br><br>the chick that played usagi was really uncute</br></br></br>    Remember when the first images of this crap series came out and looked like shit, and every SailorFags defend it like "No! it will look good when animated!". Where are they now?  <br>I thought the first key visual looked really nice but only as a pretty key visual. I didn't think it would actually look like that in the series and man did it not work</br>  <br> How do I get through Sailor Moon R? I want to enjoy it but it's somehow not nearly as entertaining as the first season. <br><br>R is the one season where I'd honesty recommend just skipping half the episodes, you can come back later if you are really curious. The show picks up several episodes from now and gets progressively better as you get through S, which ends up surpassing everything else so far.<br><br> Maybe the 9 month break since I last saw an episode will help. <br>I understand. I did the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought the first key visual looked really nice <br><br>Same here, that actually got my hopes up.</br></br></br>    <br>Crystal did get the long hyperextended fingers correct.</br>    <br> It's finally over. <br><br>I've still got 12 episodes to watch  soon. </br></br></br>  I'm a bit surprised to see this thread still alive.  <br>The previous Sailor Moon general was up for a few days. Both have lasted longer than a majority of the threads I watch on /a/.</br>  <br> Great moments in Sailor Moon Crystal </br>  <br> There was a lottery for tickets to a Sailor Moon concert <br> Theatre full of little girls <br> "Hey, do you want to appear on one episode of Sailor Moon?" <br> Little girls see Minako fainting, probably dying <br>Sasuga Toei</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss the good ol' fanservice of the 90's</br>  <br>That's black dog art so t doesn't count</br>    Im really looking forward to just skipping through episodes looking for scenes with Mars or Venus    <br> the fact that they decided to shoehorn in a stupid "MARS MERCURY VENUS AND JUPITER WERE IN LOVE WITH JAEDITE, NEPHRITE, ZOISITE AND KUNZITE" subplot <br><br>wasn't that in the manga?</br></br></br>    <br>Why is Jupiter worse off than the others?</br>  So there is going to be a season 2?  <br><br>I has an OVA.</br></br>  <br>Mushibugyo is generic shoubeb, but I think it has what you mentioned with the female ninja.</br>  Would this work in a real fight?  <br>yes go try it out right now.</br>  It's a nice way to have your palms sliced open.  <br> Advanced Americlap Fighting Technique </br>  <br>Get in a fight<br>Clap your hands<br>See what happens :^)</br></br></br>  <br>An eagle will come to my rescue, right?</br>  <br>Precisely.</br>  Why didn't they just call this Circle Jerk - The Anime?<br><br>I'm getting tired of all the dick sucking in this show.</br></br>  That can be applied to most current running anime shows right now.<br><br>Gate? Japan stroking itÂ´s own penis while releasing itÂ´s pent up frustrations on the west soiling itÂ´s myth and legends. ItÂ´s blatant rape.</br></br>  <br>now you see his dilemma</br>  <br>Because they thought you'd have the sense to see the potential issues and problems with all the dick-sucking.</br>  <br> Circle Jerk - The Anime <br> Saying this while fucking GATE is airing <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br><br> dick sucking <br><br>But anon he has no dick. Just a raging boner.</br></br></br></br>    <br>The dick sucking is the biggest flaw of the guardians, Here is a guy that had his emotions killed and has the knowledge base of a hardcore mmo player and a salaryman winging it as an evil overlord and everyone just treats his word as the greatest thing ever no matter how bad of a decision he is making. Hell at one point he compares asking the guardians for their opinions on par with giving no opinion at all.</br>  <br>The funny thing is that the MC doesnt want it at all. His minions mis-understand his motives most of the time and he feels he has to act a certain way too (be an all knowing evil overlord) and it makes for some great situations.</br>  Not enough Albedo in this thread  <br> Gate? Japan stroking itÂ´s own penis while releasing itÂ´s pent up frustrations on the west soiling itÂ´s myth and legends. ItÂ´s blatant rape. <br>I-I never thought of this before.</br></br>  <br>this is truly the best</br>  <br>So you too now understand Momonga.</br>  Pretty sad that Cocytus is the first guardian to stop the dick sucking, being the dumbest out of the group.  <br>Not enough maids too.</br>  <br>How would the guardians react if Skeletor simply came out and said that he's not the ambitious evil overlord they think he is? Since it seems like they're hard wired to love and respect everything he does.</br>  <br>They would stop everything and turn the Tomb into an heteromorphic daycare.</br>  <br>they would claim it was all part of a greater plan.<br><br>Guardians would become yandere level at that point.</br></br></br>  <br> those reaction faces <br>Maybe I should read the manga after all.</br></br>  <br>Well at least he got Cocytus to voice his opinion. And Demiurge kind of does shit on his own. The real issue is dealing with the girls I think.</br>  <br>It's pretty fun</br>      <br> it was all part of a greater plan. <br> Of courshe. </br></br>  <br>Its not that hes the dumbest, hes just the most focused of them.</br>  I know people are thinking Papa Bones is going to get a sad end but I disagree. The story's going to end with him ruling his empire of nonhumans. The theocracy will probably be in ruins and Renner will be the queen of the Kingdom. As for the Empire, who knows.  <br> has to message Demiurge and ask 'why my zerg rush losing to tactics?' </br>  <br> We'll almost certainly see this animated in 2 days <br><br>I can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>He knew why they were losing, but Ainz gave him specific orders and he wasn't sure what to do with them. So why not ask the smartest guy you know?</br>  <br>more like in three weeks.

As a matter a fact, it's more likely than not because Ainz himself states that at the height of Nazarick's power, they would still get their ass whooped by one fag wielding World Savior which is a club that grows and grows. <br><br>So unless the damn thing suddenly gains +Ignores damage resistance instead of the more likely situation of just unending growth of damage, it would mean Touch Me was not capable of taking a hit from that thing even at his best.<br><br>And last thread I already pointed this shit out.

She's all bright and bubbly and nice but won't hesitate to murder you in cold blood. Plus she's cunning and brutal in her actions.<br><br>In other words, she's the perfect Nazarick meido. Although she friendly towards humans on the surface, she won't hesitate to murder them all if she has to.</br></br></br>  <br>What is even happening in this image?</br>  <br> read the novels </br>  <br>No one has actually confirmed what his build was that made him untouchable. We just know that it was overpowered enough that he could become a world class champion.</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br> She's taking care of some trolls?Ogres? in Carne Village. </br>  <br>Please tell me the water at least has sharks in it? No evil lair water death trap is complete without sharks.</br>  <br>We might be buying sharks, depends on our budget. Undead Sea Serpent is essentially free since we can raise it ourselves, and we're strong enough to kill one.</br>  <br>The wishing ring isn't a world class item. It was a gasapon/lucky prize item.</br>  <br>holy shit you're retarded</br>  <br>Does that affect it's power? Even if it's from a special raffle, what would the actual ranking of the item be?</br>  <br>Yeah along with 8 others.</br>  <br>So she's Neutral Evil then huh?</br>  <br>It's super ranked, so it's below World Class but above Divine and probably Guild/World Champion tier, since Ainz specifically said only WC items can deny it.<br><br>Which is ironic because World Champion items are not world class, but only guild weapon tier. Then again that's practically the best damn tier for any stat stick we've ever seen. <br><br>Cause if you think about it, no WC item is like +5000 to all stats or some shit, they all have a function, an activation, and aside from making the holder resistant to most WC item effects they have zero known passive effects.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Ainz could do that he would done it in his fight against  Shalltear .</br>   No warping in with your full Guild of level 100s with Max gear <br><br> Not raping and pillaging all of Ainz shit <br><br> Not shattering his dreams and hopes while PKD laughs </br></br></br></br>    <br>-200. Not as bad as a lot of people in Nazarick.</br>  Reminder : If you hate Overlord you also have to hate One Punch Man.  <br>I'd just kill his guardians in front of him one by one and then use the magic of asspullery to make it so that he can't revive them.<br><br>Then teleport out.

Must be that weird squiggle mouth and centipede hair.</br>  <br>We're already reaching that in modern times, I imagine in 100 years it'll be totally standard.</br>  <br><br>I voted Lupus too but Entoma came out of nowhere.</br></br>    <br>Yea, they would be farming gold for years at a time for floor guardian resurrections.</br>  Post more Albedo.  So I just started reading the light novel, but I'm having trouble getting through it at times. I have never read a LN before, do they all tend to be written this awkwardly, or is the Skythewood translation just really poor?  <br>Back to your Monogatari containers.</br>  <br>Care to elaborate? The way you described it would make for a very interesting read.</br>  <br>LNs are awkward to read because a lot of translations don't get through the character speaking quirks. So it can get a bit difficult to figure out who's speaking.</br>  <br>Eh, first couple of chapters are rough because it was different TLs. Just push on through or try the mega.</br>  <br>he is translating a chinese translation of a Japanese LN.<br><br>also keep in mind LN are called LIGHT for a reason, they are mean to be consumed by lots of people not read deeply into like us foreigners do.</br></br></br>  <br>it's a common thing from what i've read. there's a very idiosyncratic method of talking.</br>  <br>Fuck&gt;Marry&gt;Kill</br>  I really wish the LN would get localized in NA though that's probably wishful thinking. It's one that I'd actually spend money on.  <br>Again, Overlord is a bonafide novel. Not that it makes that much of a difference but get it straight.</br>  <br>How can someone be so best girl, how can someone be so girl of the season? How? Explain this to me ASAP, scientists and /a/nalysts.</br>  <br>Assuming toilet is penguin in which case he is the best and mightiest butler and a capable ruler</br>  <br>You should read High School dxd or Campione. Matter of fact, I'm still stuck at volume 7 of Campione.</br>  Okay so as far as the still not seen NPCs go there's Lastborn who is confirmed the human NPC, the miko who is all but confirmed to be the last level 100, the cherry blossom guardian (who isn't confirmed to be the miko but you'd assume), and then Rubedo/Spinel who while confirmed to be two separate beings could be either of the above yeah?  <br>I hope you're fine with having to wait 5 years for them to catch up to where we currently are, followed by them dropping it forever but keeping the rights to it so that no one else can translate it.</br>   Albedo arrived just as Mareâs wand descended on the manâs head. The helmet hit by the wand deformed, and the skull underneath had also formed a depressed crevice, with the eyeballs squeezed out because of the powerful impact. The skull was completely smashed, just like playing watermelon bashing by the beachside in summer.  <br><br>Trap is hardcore.</br></br>  <br>Toilet is the whore that Sebas picks up on the street</br>  <br>It's because the previous thread had some fanart of her.<br><br>Also, have some badass Narberal</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;those reaction faces </br>  <br> staying as Papa Bones, master over death and life <br> or going back to being Satou Suzuki, generic Japanese office worker that is liable to die from overwork <br>I know what I'd pick.</br></br></br>  She's so perfect.  <br>But anon.<br>She's a bitch.</br></br>  <br>Tits onee chan! ia ia! tits ftang ia ia !</br>  At least he's aware of the dick-sucking and not<br> eh, what was that about <br>all the time</br></br>  Rejoice people, for the next chapter will focus on Sebas.<br><br> We get to see him continue being handsome and pick up Toile. <br><br> We also get to see Solution rat him out. </br></br></br></br>  <br>   We also get to see Solution rat him out. <br><br>Fucking bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait until you see her true form.</br>  <br>AINZ - SAMAAAAA!! KISSU! KISSU!!!</br>  <br> Toile <br> wikifag </br></br>  <br>It's very likely Rubedo is the cherry blossom guardian who is likely the miko. <br><br>You can't be the strongest being in Nazarick while not being level 100.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm looking at the chinese translations. I'm just using the name that's been commonly used here.</br>  <br>You talking about the manga?<br>I just finished reading it. Its pretty damn nice. and the artist makes some excellently expressive faces.<br>Just look at that aura good god.</br></br></br>   Reading through the books <br> 70% of a novel is setting up characters I give no fucks about <br> 30% is left for Papa Bones to come in and fuck their shit up <br><br>It was cute at first, but JESUS CRUST, I don't care about lizardman, adventurers, and kingdoms. I only care about Papa Bones and his crew, yet why do the novels spend most of their bulk on others? The anime is about Papa Bones, but the books are focused on everyone except Papa Bones and his staff. <br><br>I read 4 volumes in the span of two days, but it's been 5days and I can't get through vol 5, this is so fucking tedious. It's like I have to endure all this extra bullshit just to get to the good parts. <br><br> My face chapters are spent building up a character only for them to die  <br><br>WHAT WAS THE FUCKING POINT??</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Shalltear was just a necrophiliac in her settings. She only seems interested in Ainz though.</br>  <br>So you can care they died.</br>  <br> I actually like how the give a fuck about those mooks.<br> Also, WN was worst. Ainz was just some faggot who shwoed up from time to time and ALL the focus was on his minions.</br></br>  <br> no diamond pupils </br>  <br>Hamster in a sense is lucky, or at least according to the guardians. Gets one of the best positions possible.</br>  <br>She talks about wanting to fuck her vampire brides constantly and gropes them in front of Sebas.</br>  <br>So you only care about the MC and his party in any story? What are you doing here instead of reddit?</br>  <br>Is being Ainz's mobile chair really a position worth striving for after you were a forest king?</br>  <br>funny because its a plot point and how Papa Bones doesnt want any of that.</br>  <br> king of some shitty forest filled with weak creatures <br> the Supreme Being known as the Overlord of Death's mobile chair <br> What do you think?</br></br></br>  <br>Rather have a pumpkin all to myself than a velvet cushion and be forced to share.</br>  <br>Blame the translators for that one, prose is the first thing that dies in translation, I'm still having fun though. Compared to most other TLs I've seen the translation of Overlord is a masterpiece.</br>  <br>I'd agree but only on Climb's part. Everybody else were relatively interesting and sort of likable but holy shit is Climb one of the most grating characters I've had the displeasure of mildly giving a fuck about. At least show more of the dysfunctional princess instead of that poor little fucker.</br>  Is this the first time they talk about Saoru's work/life before becoming Ainz?<br>If it is, the way this is introduced felt kind of sudden. Were there other mentions of the previous life I've missed?</br>  <br><br>But that's the thing tho, I don't and never did. The books are clearly centered around Papa Bones and his staff. So when a lot of time is spent on characters that aren't them, I stop caring. Some characters, extend the story or world, but others lead no where. They are a narrative dead end. It feels like time spent was wasted, when they die or fuck off never to be seen again.<br><br>It's too repetitive, too often. As a reader, we don't need to be on the backs of these side characters to understand them or feel for them. Why not have spies follow them, or why not have Momon act as a vehicle for these side characters. In a story, there are many ways to introduce side characters. It's just so fucking monotonous to be forced on these characters, that aren't part of the main crew. Just by that fact alone, "that they aren't the main crew", gives me cognitive dissonance. I know not to trust these fucks or put my heart into them. There is only ever 2 out comes for these characters too. They die or fuck off to be a reference.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He talks a lot about it in the first volume.</br>  <br><br>Please don't bully.<br> Actually, yeah. I hate Climb as well. I hope he dies sooner rather than later. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Ainz' past life is only ever brought up to contrast his current predicaments. It's to make you sympathize with how an average shmuck is thrown into these outrageous situations.</br></br>  <br><br>He gets to  train under Sebas but I still don't know if he gets to live later on. </br></br>  <br>This bitch is straight evil.</br>  <br><br>B-But muh hime.</br></br>  <br>You didn't like Darkness Sword?<br>I think the whole point of the overlording thing is the little people he crushes to do his dastardly work. You'd think he'd be even a little bit more moral considering he still respects humans as living things, for now.</br></br>  <br>I hope Sebas kills him<br>But that's just unlikely</br></br>  <br>Do you feel the same way about the lizardmen? I didn't care about them that much at the start, but they grew on me after awhile and I was somewhat glad things didn't end horribly for them. I think the time they took to develop them made the side story pretty interesting.</br>  <br>Okay then just don't read any book where someone dies because as a reader if you're aware someone is likely to die that means you cannot relate to them at all and should only focus on the people you think will live.<br><br>Whenever you start reading a book just research ahead of time who lives and only read pages with them involved.</br></br></br>  <br> Why don't you just distance yourself as far as possible from any side character since they're ultimately worthless <br> A story is about the main characters who I know will live and that's it fuck off with anything and anyone else <br><br>You've never read a story in your life have you</br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you feel the same way about the lizardmen? <br><br>Honestly, the feeling I got from lizardmen volume, is that the author was trying to turn me furry. Not even joking.<br><br>It had a lot of scenes of lizardmen romancing lizard woman, suggesting lizard mating, spying on actual lizard mating in the dark, lizard acting cute and lizard sex slaves. <br><br>It was all so bizarre. Like the author had an underlying predisposition to sexy albino lizards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked that mook Shalltear absolutely destroyed and he only had god knows how little pages dedicated to him compared to what Climb is getting. Shit. Even that guy who got destroyed by the honeypot was far more enjoyable to read.<br><br>Admittedly, it gives background on the Kingdom and its internal working but shit is it hard to read through just because it focuses on Climb the most.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But Albedo is the worst part of the show followed closely by the vampire.</br></br>  <br>That's kinda fucked up, you may as well have the same complaints watching The Lion King.</br>  <br>Again, LIGHT Novels are called that way because they are easier to read than HARD or CLASSIC Novels. For example: Legend Of the Galactic Heroes was one of the very first LNs created, but it isn't shallow or short by any means.<br><br>Comparing Classic Novels to Light novels is like comparing Western novels written in Old English and Modern English. Most Japanese classic novels require native Japanese to bring along a dictionary just to understand half of the words.</br></br></br>  <br> Okay then just don't read any book where someone dies <br><br>Only main characters are exempt from death and only their deaths have any meaning in a story, since the story fundamentally cannot continue as it had before. <br><br>How the fuck do you not know this basic principle? You can't have Harry Potter without Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes without Sherlock Holmes etc. Anyone that isn't a main character, is a prime candidate for death and as such, I never sympathize with them.</br></br></br></br></br>   I-I like Climb. ;_;     <br> Was hoping that Ainz would eventually Vetinari it up <br><br> He lacks the composure too <br><br>Ah well : Hopefully a few centuries will give him enough</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only main characters are exempt from death and only their deaths have any meaning in a story, since the story fundamentally cannot continue as it had before. <br> only their deaths have any meaning in a story, since the story fundamentally cannot continue as it had before.  <br> only their deaths have any meaning in a story <br><br>You were doing so well but just had to give yourself away.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hah. Get a load of this faggot.</br>  <br>I bet you hate Gazef</br>  <br><br>No talent scrub located.</br></br>  <br> You were doing so well but just had to give yourself away. <br><br>Do you remember the shit storm of Lelouch vi Britannia? Do you remember Kamina? What about Spike Spiegel? Can you explain what happened to L in Death note?<br><br>I bet you do and do you know why? Because they were the main characters of their story and they all have the same thing in common. I don't need to explain myself, when the evidence speaks volumes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forced to share <br><br>Man, he IS the velvet cushion now</br></br></br>  <br>You're trying too hard. Just take a shit and go to sleep, and you'll save yourself 5 hours doing the same thing here.</br>  <br> Me too. </br>  <br>why hate fun anon?</br>  <br> You're trying too hard. <br><br> You replied and I merely gave my opinion. This is getting out of topic, so I'm going to politely ignore you for the thread's sake. But I want to have the last word. Only main characters and their deaths matter, anything or anyone else is just a tool of the author. </br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=keW<wbr>j755icyY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> You will never be a sexy dancing girl putting on magical dance performances for Papa Bones </br></br>  <br> But I want to have the last word. <br> All those no life reaction images <br> Still trying to make people believe you aren't shit posting </br></br></br>  <br><br> Climbfags <br>Excuse me?</br></br></br>  <br> and fail and kill every dancer in the building in the process while getting away scot-free and shrugging and going "oh well" <br>I love Water.</br></br>  Reminder that Narberal is undisputably the best meido<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4970584/r</br></br>  <br>They would call him a very modest an all-mighty overlord</br>  <br><br>It's really nothing more than a publishing designation.</br></br>  What would happen if Ainz just announced that he doesn't want to take over the world or hurt anyone and that he plans on chilling in his tomb for the rest of eternity?  <br> We already went over this, the Guardians would think that's part of his master keikaku.<br> They would think he is testing their resolve or something.</br></br>  <br>You'll see Ainz in all of his glory come Volume 9.</br>   You will never be a level 100 fighter in the new world and able to solo whole armies and kick down castle walls <br>Why must life be so cruel</br>  <br>Then the guardians would probably go out and ensure Ainz will never be disturbed by the foolish world outside the tomb and so he may chill comfortably without worry.</br>  <br>I somewhat blame Demiurge's creator, Ulbert. He's very similar to how Lakyus of Blue Rose is, and I kind of think Ulbert designed Demiurge in a way that Demiurge will implicitly fulfill his masters wishes, even if those wishes don't have any basis in reality.</br>  This entires season is the shittest season I've experienced. Shokugeki is ok. Charlotte is watchable-ish. That's it. Also what the fuck with kekkai sensen not even finishing. The entire film industry lost a lot of face with me with that.  Welp, chinese translations are stuck at 8 and someone's already working on 9. Decisions decisions.  <br>VOL 5, CHP. 3 FUCKING WHEN</br>  <br> Never. </br>  <br>test</br>  <br>Demiurge taking and making little devil babies with Lakyus confirmed?</br>  <br>She is quite pathetic isn't she?</br>  Ainz will never resurrect Arche.<br>;_;</br>  <br>Next Saturday. Hopefully. There's a short intermission between, I think. They might just translate that, and count it as a chapter.</br>  So is LN Ainz going Kingdom route instead of Empire route like in the WN or is he going "fuck you niggahs I'm creating my own kingdom with blackjack and skelingtons"?  <br>christ.</br>  <br>Just JDF wrecking some fantasy romans while they show off all their military equipment to the said otherworlders bask in their amazement. Oh and american spec op team getting rekt by JDF special forces.</br>  <br>Read the manga, then pick up the LN from were it stops.</br>  <br>He's creating his own  kingdom. <br><br>  After the battle against the Kingdom's army, he takes the city that Momon and Nabel are based in. Carne Village has also significantly expanded, since Enri manages to summon 5000 goblins. Adding his 500 death knights and the dark young that he summons, he's literally the top dog of the region at the moment.  <br><br>However,  Platinum Dragon Lord  finally notices and begins to move.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best chair.</br>  <br>Now that's some serious self-fellating, even by MURICA standards.</br>  <br> all that groaning and camera pans to the crotch <br>calm down man, dont have a heart attack over a little arm pit and leg</br></br>  <br> Platinum  <br>That's a pleb tier metal in the eyes of Nazarick's residents.</br></br>  <br>W-what do you mean? Isn't it going to happen next saturday?</br>  <br>In the WN, Ainz conducts a undead orchestra. No idea how the author is going to do for the LN.</br>  <br> There have been other players in the new world before Ainz <br><br> It was the Platinum Dragon Lord that has been combating them </br></br></br>  Is there a world map?  <br>NEVER</br>  Why doesn't Ainz just set up a magical barrier than brain washes everyone within it into worshiping him without resistance?  <br>Im reading it just for the sheer amusment, it's bad but it's good kind of bad. I want to see how far they're gonna go.</br>  <br>Mikoto, pls.</br>  I liked the first episode but the second one was really really boring, literally nothing happen.  <br><br>Dude you don't even know.<br><br>Gate's been toned down by THREE separate editors. Once for the web novel, once for the LN, and once for the manga. And Japan is STILL super uncomfortable about it. It's fucking hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for it. Tomorrow will be more stuff happening.</br>  <br>It's not a secret, they literally put it in the OP.</br>  <br> implying you have enough irl money to pay for all the .0000001% rolls for max level p2w gear. </br>  <br>You got the sequence wrong. Manga came before the LN and is closer to the source novels.</br>  <br><br>First, it's the CIA, not a special forces team, and the JSDF only managed to hold them off for a little while (which, given that its their own terrain with a the whole JSDF at their disposal and agents were in a small unit, isn't that surprising), before they are killed by the Rory, who is fucking immortal and can heal from bullet wounds.</br></br>  <br>I thought Japan would praise something like that just like America praises things that sucks its red, white, and blue cock, including itself.</br>  <br> Japan is too ashamed of itself for that.</br>  <br>Japan's left wing thinks even the JSDF is unconstitutional. And the moderates aren't much better. Japan is in full disuhonoraburu disupuray mode since the war.</br>  <br><br>I think Japan needs to win a war in order to regain their honor.<br><br>Nothing big, maybe against the philipines or some other 3rd world shitpile.<br><br>Just enough to let them taste blood and feel sufficient again. As of right now they're just a vassal state.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Demiglace is just jealous he doesn't have is own Ainz body pillow. Seriously though she's suppose to be borderline Yandere.</br>  <br>Is this anime well liked here so far? I think its a better concept for far then fucking sword art which put me asleep. all these fucking dot hack clones.<br><br>Also was gonna check out gate because it actually has a protag older then 18, more so 30 even i hear. this season is pretty awesome, I haven't new watched anime in like a year. ever since i watched 80s anime i could never go back.</br></br></br>  <br><br>wait so whats the problem with this gate anime? should i watch it or read the manga which i hear it far more serious and bloody? how much more serious is the LN. Is gate actually so not shit and actually about a older protag and mature concepts that they cant handle it? If its this toned down is it even the same show?</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>It's "like", but that's mostly because of the LNs being translated online for free. LNfags know what's coming, so they're more patient.</br>  <br>The yandere thing gets more serious in Volume 6 and 7.</br>  <br><br>wait its been this long and even when america agrees it should have a army again , they still dont even want a fucking army when they are right next to china? dont they see the problem?</br></br>  <br>Terrible idea, you're completely ignore the existence of Mermaids/Fishkin/etc</br>  <br> china <br> doing anything </br></br>  <br>Wait so should i watch the anime of overlord then maybe read the novels? how well translated are they?<br>gate is translated too? how far away so far is gate's anime from the manga which i hear is a LOT more Gorey.</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding? The jewel box scene is the most important scene in the entire series.</br>  <br>The people in power in Japan right now were born after the war anon. In the late 40s, 50s and 60s. Maximum guilt tripping.</br>  <br>Make sure your reading the edited translations, anon's have been posting a mega link to them.<br>And yeah, it's things getting lost in translations and imperfect translations. But LN's do have a different writing style to normal novels (I'd liken them to a script for a play, less lengthy descriptions more focus on dialogue and actions).</br></br>  <br>well that makes sense i guess.</br>  <br> it's the CIA, not a special forces team <br>If it was CIA, they were SAD guys. SAD qualifies for special forces (or rather, requits from them) and is about as elite as it gets.</br></br>  <br>The LNs are translated by Skythewood blog up to Volume 5; currently, a chapter a week. The translations are what's usually fueling the weekend Overlord threads. The anime and manga are both abridged versions of the LN, which is the real material. The anime itself will only go up to Volume 3.</br>  <br>It makes him the closest one two Ainz second only to his 'child' (Pandora's Acto). That's why everyone was so jealous, also Albedo and Shalltear would be fine with being his pet (assuming he had no intention of taking a wife/lover/concubine).</br>  <br>Not him but could i get a link to the edited versions of overlord is it caught up all the way? <br><br>how different is the anime so far? and its translated pretty good so far/<br><br>What about gate? is that light novel being translated so far too?<br>how would you rate the novel of overlord so far for someone who actually reads books? (im reading the stormlight archives right now). <br><br>As i have said ive been watching 1980s anime before the whole otaku take over and lost track of anime ever since, everything felt awful and this season seems different so far. looks like some people are actually taking chances or thinking just a bit out of the box. (even though this is a dot hack clone of many) more so gate too im gonna look into. is that another novel thats being translated?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So does he actually start to fall in love with the demon women who is programmed to love him? how does that go so far in the novels? It seems she is the authors main girl so far in the anime.</br>  <br>The anime skimps on a few of the smaller details, but captures the important bits. I don't remember reading it, but apparently they skipped a scene where Demiurge was talking about using elves for a breeding program, might have been a lie though, dunno.</br>  Ainz would probably commit sudoku if it wasn't for the guardians.  <br>What is that for gate or overlord? im guessing gate? So gate is not censored as much as ive heard? because from what i read the mangas tone and art is really different. <br>should i even bother watching overlord and gate and just reading them? (if gate is translated also)</br></br>  <br>Here https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br>But please use the archive next time.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Sorry I haven't been on /a/ or the anime world in forever, just joining back in now. I feel like im from the past after watching 80s anime for the past like 3 years. not to say I haven't been watching whats been airing but its been all trash. I gave up on anime and went to reading books.</br>  <br>Read the Gate Manga and Overlord LN.<br>Then if you find them enjoyable consider watching the Anime adaptations and possibly the Overlord Manga (Though Honestly the Manga is a real disappointment).<br>I'd also suggest avoiding Gate threads since Amerifats keep shitposting them to hell.</br></br></br>   Using Liches for construction work <br>Hmn, It almost feels like a waste of resources.</br>  Did anyone save the spoiler text from volume 6 with Albedo talking to herself?  <br>Oh, just to add, make sure to check out Overlords audio drama as well.</br>  Why is this edgelord doctor allowed to live? He singlehandedly ruined the village, should have killed himself of he is all about protecting Sotoba  Seishin pls fucking go  Get off the internet shitty priest traitor.   tortures his own wife in the name of science <br> indiscriminately killing shikis without caring for their circumstance <br> genocide without due process <br> overall edgelord <br>This villian should not have been a survivor</br></br></br></br>  <br> tortures own wife in the name of science <br>She was a bitch, and it was for SCIENCE!<br> circumstance <br>They were dicks and were indiscriminately killing people<br> due process <br>No way to give them a fair trial. Vampires are dead people, and dead dudes can't be held accountable for any crime, and therefore do not have any legal protection<br> overall edgelord <br>Fuck off priestfag. He was the real edgelord</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he hadn't done what he did everyone would have either died anyway or become Shiki. He did what he had to do, and would've succeeded were it not for the fire.<br><br><br>The last three points can be easily applied to the Shikis as well, particularly Tatsumi. Really, one of the main points of the story was to show there is no absolute good nor absolute evil.</br></br></br></br>  He did nothing wrong. It's a doggy dog world. You kill or be killed.  <br>Fuck off faggot monk</br>  <br>Great Russian Communist.</br>  Twilightfag pl leave  <br>shikishitter pls go<br>doc did everything right</br></br>  some of the deaths in this show really bothered me<br> never got to go to the city </br>  <br>Fuck that cunt. Her getting run over was the most satisfying death in the whole show.</br>  This guy on the left was the biggest fag  Great designed character wasted on a small role. Sad, she had so much potential too.  She didn't deserve it, it wasn't her fault, to start with she was manipulated with the idea that she would bring their family back with her, and by the time she realize it it was too late, she was a good person in the middle of the circumstances and the author is a fucking edgelord faggot.  <br> doggy dog world </br>  <br> tortures his own wife in the name of science <br>Implying a vampire slut can be a wife</br></br>  <br>Literally every single Shiki except the grandma and the nurse were murderers.</br>  If the doctor proved that you can get recovered from a Shiki after they feed on you once after some days, why don't the Shikis just eat 1 human one day, and then another human the next day, and so on, and then after let's say, 7 humans repeat the cycle, so nobody never died, and Shikis and humans can live in peace.  CAPITALIST PIG GO AWAY!  <br> implying you wouldn't betray humanity for a cute eternal loli waifu </br>  <br>The wife never drank blood</br>  <br>They're sinful gluttons, that's why decided they are worth exterminating<br><br><br>I wouldn't</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, wife as well.<br>Other than the three of them, every single Shiki was a murderer.</br></br>  <br>Because the goal of the Shiki was to exterminate the humans in the village and turn it into a safe place for their kind. Coexistence was possible, but the Shiki had no interest in it.</br>  You don't show human courtesy to demons. No matter what you do they're gonna try to kill you. You kill them before they can go anywhere near you.  <br> He singlehandedly ruined the village <br>Get out fucking faggot monk.</br></br>  <br>Move aside, superior loli moving through</br>  <br> I wouldn't <br><br>Are you a faggot? I bet you're a faggot. How about you go and kill yourself you little faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>People actually like this kid?

They started the conflict, firstly by coming in to town, and then caused it to escalate drastically by killing the people they were taking blood from (which was unnecessary). They did that to increase their numbers, which in turn increased the amount of blood they needed, which then increased the amount of people dying. It was an unsustainable cycle. You could argue that the humans were cruel, but in this situation, the Shikis' death was the only thing the would solve the problem. If they killed off the humans, there'd inevitably be a (now large) number of vampires that would have to move on to other villages and repeat the process. <br><br>Sure, the townsfolk turned in to vampires never WANTED that to happen, and they were drinking blood out of necessity, but it doesn't change the fact that humans and Shiki could not coexist.</br></br></br>    <br>All capitalists shall be crushed beneath the wheels of the revolution!
