[ Season 4 when?<br><br> Ryoko best Girl. </br></br>  Ryoko is the ultimate waifu.  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>I don't think they can repair the immense damage they've already done to the franchise. The OVA ended with season 2 for me.</br>  <br> The OVA ended with season 2 for me. <br>You could be right, it is just an end of an era for some of us. I myself refuse to let go of my waifu, and accept she will never be relevant again.</br></br>  <br>sooner than expected.</br>  <br>I was a member of the RFFC back in the day, but there's no hope for the Tenchi franchise with Kajishima at the helm. He just doesn't give a fuck about the original cast, and I suspect he particularly dislikes Ryoko.<br>Look at how she's been treated in everything he's written since the 90s. She's become a joke character with almost no screentime.</br></br>  <br>Japanese are afraid of tomboys. Pretty much every main girl for the last couple of decades has been some ultra generic bitch.</br>  <br>I think Ryoko was the most popular character when the first OVA were released in the mid-90s, even in Japan. However, her popularity declined as they watered down the franchise and made the characters into caricatures. When there is any kind of focus on the original cast, it's usually on Sasami/Tsunami, followed by Washu and Aeka. Most of the focus seems to be on the terrible new characters Kajishima wants to force into the show.<br>The only thing he's made in the past 15 years that was half-decent was Isekai, as some of the characters were actually endearing and well designed. I don't see the point of setting everything in the Tenchiverse, though.</br></br>  Let lay this age old question to rest.<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4990159</br></br>  <br> http://strawpoll.me/4990159/r <br><br><br>Fucking Washu is hacking the poll again!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, that third OVA was brutal. Sure, it flat out tells you what's going on in the series, but god damn it was bad. Might as well read the Tenchi Wiki, or better yet just pay closer attention during the earlier OVAs.</br>  <br>Representing.</br>    <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br> best girl <br><br>No one knows who she is...</br></br></br>  <br>Superior lifeform</br>  <br>Were her tits that big before?</br>  <br>Best waifu</br>  <br>That's your problem, not mine.</br>  <br>Anon, she’s not in the strawpoll, how does that makes you feel?</br>  <br> anybody caring about Kiyone Masaki <br>Kiyone Makibi is the one in the poll, fool.</br></br>  <br> denial is a powerful allied  <br><br>Keep posting Kiyone Makibi, I'm really just trolling but you have to accept the fact that shes no canon.</br></br></br>  <br>When and what?</br>  <br> she was made by the three people who made the original OVA story line <br> appeared in the novel that the OVA was based on <br> appeared before Noike and Kiyone Misaki <br> SHE'S NOT CANON </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was an obsessive Tenchi fan in my youth. I bought, downloaded, watched and read everything I could come across that was related to the OVA or Universe.<br>But I couldn't actually finish the third OVA. It was so fucking bad.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to Masaki Kajishima. You will be surprised by the answer.</br>  <br> Masaki 'real women don't act like they do in my anime' Kajishima <br> Masaki 'My self insert is being ignored for these hot women, better dumb them down.' Kajishima </br></br>  <br>Ironically I was going to add a note next to Kiyone's name in the poll that reads (Yes, shes canon). I should had done that.</br>    She will always be the voice to mai waifu.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD9<wbr>cMvxkOHY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>"Why is Galaxy Police Officer MAKIBI Kiyone not in the original OVA series or the Okuda manga?"<br><br>Because Kajishima-sensei didn’t make her up; she was invented by HASEGAWA Naoko-sensei for her spinoff novels and didn’t see the screen until after OAV 1 was completed (first showing up in anime for the Mihoshi Special). The Okuda manga is based on the OVA series, so it doesn’t include her either.<br><br><br>Please just.... LET IT GO</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except she's canon. Kajishima is just a giant man child and couldn't handle all the women having a better personality then his self insert. Watch this video, pleb. <br/></br>  <br>Nah, she can do angry Ryouko but she can't do sexy Ryouko.<br><br>Superior Ryouko's singing makes me diamonds.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Achika and Kiyone were introduced to the lore first, making them canon. </br></br>    <br>Burchard could do sexy Ryoko, but she couldn't do emotional Ryoko.</br>  <br>I don't care about this "canon" bullshit.<br>Kiyone is the best girl out of the damn thing.<br>Kiyone was in Ryo-ohki manga, and computer game.<br>Kiyone appeared in almost any possible spin-off, except for the latest ones, where it's actually a relief.<br>Nothing else matters.</br></br></br></br></br>    Fuck, wonder if I should rewatch Universe. I don't think I've watched it since the 90s.  <br> not finding Petrea's faintly raspy voice sexy. <br>Where I do respect, and appreciate your taste in all things related Ryo(u)ko. I wont hesitate to fuck up your face for undermining her original dubbed VA.</br></br>  Best non-canon girl  <br> irrelevant logic </br>  <br>Universe is a great watch. I watched it first before the 1st season of the OVA. It is wacky star trekking space hijacks. With a hot, and sexy bounty hunter to boot.</br>  <br>A few months ago Kajishima released a doujin.<br>Only a few pages and no dialogue, it's mostly just a preview for what he has planned.<br>He just has to get it greenlit and produced, which is likely as Ai! Tenchi Muyo was successful in it's purpose, which was to gauge the interest in the franchise, and results were positive.</br></br></br>  <br>Never liked her. Too much of a Mary Sue.</br>    <br>I remember first watching that movie on sci-fi one Saturday morning in the mid 90s. God bless you sci-fi, and your Japanimation Weekends.</br>  <br>Goddamn, Mihoshi.<br>Also count the carrots.</br></br>  <br> Best non-canon girl <br><br>Now, this is an entire new debate we can have...</br></br></br>  <br>And here comes the new info.</br>  <br>True, but she was still quite attractive. Her role was not that major to be anything other than a thorn in Ryoko's hot sexy butt.</br>  <br>I wonder what the purpose of all the shitty spinoffs is. I could get Universe, as they wanted to capitalize on the success of the show, by making a TV series. But all the other shitty shows? Shin, GXP, Ai, Pretty Sammy? What the fuck.<br><br>Why does this fuck keep making paper thin caricatures based on a show that was carried entirely by its cast? There's a reason this stood out among the plethora of other OVAs with a similar premise, and he just keeps shitting all over its legacy.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn Ryoko's got a flat butt. Thank god she got an ass in Ai Tenchi.</br>    Nagi was meant to be in Tenchi in Tokyo, but her voice actress didn't want to voice her again.  <br><br><br> mfw you will never see 90's animation in Tenchi Muyo again </br></br></br>  <br>And Rea joins the cabal of women that rule the universe.</br>  <br> dem hot bath scenes </br>  <br>Take your negro preferences elsewhere.</br>  <br>The new shit looks so ugly.</br>  <br> Ai Tenchi Muyo <br> any good <br>Look upon these abominations, and weep.</br></br></br>    <br>Seems like fan art from pixiv...</br>  <br><br>Hey, she had a great ass in Ai, and wasn't afraid to show it.</br></br>  <br>she's always been pretty stacked, even flaunts them in front of ayeka</br>  <br>Might as well be. I gave Ai a try just for the sake of seeing my waifu again, and dropped it after the first 5min episode when none of the original main girls were in it.</br>  <br> Shin, GXP, Ai, Pretty Sammy? <br>Shin was a manga series that picked up where OVA 2 left off. It makes complete sense to make a manga when you're not about to get the funding for more OVAs.<br>GXP I can't explain, but I enjoyed it.<br>With Ai, they were given money to make it.<br>And Pretty Sammy was jumping on the Mahou Shoujo bandwagon expanding on a concept from Universe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dat story arc <br> dat concept art <br> dat short running time <br><br>Tenchi Muyo is dead</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the Japan hairspray supply went scarce for Ryoko.</br>  <br>I like Washu, save for the fact he got rid of her crab hair.<br>Sasami and Ayeka are alright too. A bit more sexualized, but no major change.</br></br>  <br>it wasn't anything to write home about<br><br>her original designs are superior in every way<br><br>as with everyone else in Ai, it was just shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no love for Beni the Oni </br>  <br>To be fair, it was just promotion animations for tourism. All the episodes were funded simply to help bring in tourist to Takahashi.</br>  <br> no major change <br>It was all shit.</br></br>  <br>Some may say that TenchiMuyo is the Call of Duty of Japanese animation.</br>   Ai has Ryoko and Ayeka reading yuri <br> before it cuts away, they look at each other <br>Think they remember what they did in Universe?</br></br>  <br>they remembered they used to be relevant</br>  <br>I'm going to Japan next years is not helping Takahashi at all.</br>  <br>You made me feel sad after I thought about it.</br>    <br>So you are the one multi voting for Washu!</br>    Sad to see how the style just devolves over time.  Wish there was something new to talk about instead of feeling like this is a circle jerk of nostalgic faggots pining for something new, and relevant.  <br>The Anime Ryokos look nothing like the way Ryoko looked in Ranma 1/2.</br>  Name a few good animation studios that can do honor to Kajishima's original art.  <br> Shin was a manga series that picked up where OVA 2 left off. <br>No, Shin Tenchi Muyo is what people now refer to as Tenchi in Tokyo.</br></br>  <br>Toei.</br>  <br>Anything new on "New Paradise War"?</br>  <br>What studios that are still around and not bought out, bankrupt, or shut down?<br><br>That is rough.</br></br></br>  DUDE CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!  <br>What an amazing trick</br>  <br><br>The eyes, hair, and jaw line in all of the incarnations except Ai were close to the original. My biggest problem was how the art direction in Ai completely revamped the original designs, and ruined any sense of attachment to the original characters.</br></br>  <br>At least they kept their personalities.</br>  <br>I think we have a Ryoko, and Washu fag fighting with proxies.</br>  <br>Technically yes, but I was too put of by the overall design of the show. It felt and looked way to fucking generic.</br>  <br>Kajishima's original art looks like shit. Not sure if it always looked like shit, but I'm guessing the art was adapted by someone for the original OVAs, and that they didn't rely on Kajishima's style entirely.</br>  <br> put off* <br><br>In addition, it is just a bit depressing that there is still no good translations of the lite novels. To me that would be the only new thing left to read that has anything to do with Tenchi Muyo.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm guessing there's a Washufag using a proxy, while the Ryoko votes are real.</br>  <br>The company that did the Tenchi OVAs for Kajishima was contacted by Toho to do a Godzilla anime.</br>  <br>I voted for Ryoko, but we only have 14 unique posters in this thread.</br>  <br>Ok?</br>  <br>mah nigga, best girl</br>  <br>You can vote without posting. Lurkers usually far outnumber posters.</br>  <br>You would probably know more than me.</br>    <br>Ryoko with lip stick is gorgeous, but kind of off putting because it seems too out of character for her.</br>  <br>I really don't know. I was hoping to see news about New Paradise because I heard that War on Geminar gained some attention, but after Tenchi Ai all news about TenchiMuyo went cold.</br>  <br>There's only like 3 of us that know that Washu is best girl regardless of what deluded Ryokofags think, but proxyfag is not me.<br><br>Also<br> Ayeka <br> having votes <br>Shit pole.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ryokofag here<br> Mihoshi that low <br>Fucking bullshit</br></br>      <br>Mihoshifags are sound asleep</br>  <br> deluded Ryokofags <br>Hey, fuck you buddy.</br></br>    <br>More like generic cunts.</br>  <br>Well they should wake up</br>  Butt?  <br>SHA-WING!</br>  I think Ai Ryoko looks okay  I am almost finished downloading the torrent for this. Had trouble finding it and I think it is recent, no peer except one had 100%. Took me months to get to 95%.        Harem fags get the fuck out, it's Ryoko only or bust.  <br><br>And I thought it couldn't get any worse than Tenchi in Tokyo. TiT would have been better if they had simply come up with new characters.<br><br><br>ayyy lmao</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel you dawg, but harem end is canon.<br><br> Ryoko is still head wife. </br></br></br>  <br>Ryouko a best</br>  <br>Between the harem end and OVA 3, Universe became the superior version of Tenchi.</br>      <br>Tenchi stuck his dick into a cat/rabbit hybrid thing, that also transforms into a space ship.<br><br> I so fucking jelly. </br></br></br>      <br>Lum was pretty much Proto-Ryoko.</br>      <br>Or was Ryoko 90's Lum?</br>    <br>derp</br>    <br>Yes? What would be y2k's Lum/Ryoko? Quality waifu I mean.</br>                 Tenchi's OVA/Universe animators were contacted to make a Godzilla anime. <br> they did this image. </br>  My Ryoko folder is expanding.<br><br>Gracious</br></br>          <br>You can't post that here! This is a Christian image board!</br>  Just rewatched the OVA on BD. Is it just THORA or were those transfers kind of shitty? I'm sure new ones would look really good, but the lines were so soft.        <br>Heh. I made that probably a decade ago. Just copied the picture in the opening, but still.</br>    <br>Film grain and all. You don't see that kind of detail in digitally produced animation. It reminds me that someone drew, and painted all those cell frames by hand. I adore it.</br>    <br>I will now fap to it, again.</br>     Ai sets up a scenario with Ryoko and Tentacles <br> no doujins have been made for it. </br>      <br>Looks like those tentacles are about to get pwnt.</br>  <br><br>That's what I'm talking about, the lines were still extremely soft when normally film transfers should be really soft. I attribute it to Tenchi being an earlier BD, but check out something like Shin Cutey Honey where the grain is more visible with a better overall image.</br></br>    <br>Most likely the encoders ran a DNR filter or two to take down the grain, which blurs the lines.<br>But THORA is usually good about not doing that.<br>It's possible the the studio who released the BD may have done their own DNR.</br></br></br>    <br>Do you have a screen cap? I don't have any BDs to compare anything other than a few caps I've saved in my folder.</br>          <br><br>I'll just take from the OP, since that's usually where the best quality is.</br></br>      After that disgrace called Ai Tenchi Muyo, I want the franchise to just RIP.    <br>It was better then Sailor Moon Crystal.</br>  <br><br><br>Tenchi IS still recoverable despite Ayyyy, but yeah, SMC is a much larger blight.</br></br></br>  <br>Hold that thought until OVA 4.</br>  <br>Not even doujin makers watched Ai.</br>  <br>First off<br><br> OVA series <br> Season <br><br>Second, a Tenchi thread on /a/? Pinch me, I must be dreaming</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see what you mean. It looks like someone used blur in photoshop to soften them lines. That sucks.</br>  <br>We have exactly one a fortnight</br>  <br> Tenchi thread on /a/? Pinch me, I must be dreaming <br>You're not dreaming, just a bunch of nostalgic old farts re-menacing days past.</br></br>  <br> liking booty means you're black <br><br>I mean, I am one, but you can't deny her breasts and legs shouldn't be the only good things about her body.</br></br></br>  <br> reminiscing <br><br>Fucking auto correct.</br></br></br>  <br>You know it's canon that she sleepwalks naked in Tenchi's room everynight?<br><br>That's the kind of face she did.</br></br></br>  <br> brown skin <br> pink nipples <br><br>Don't give me the "Oh, she's not human" excuse, that shit looks weird.<br><br> still hot tho </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> harem anime isn't supposed to have a real harem ending <br><br>Nigga.</br></br></br>  is the pics where tenchi married and porked them all and had a couple of kids with the girls canon still?  Aikan Muyo anyone?<br><br> Ryoko forever waifu after that one, even if completely non-canon it's exactly how'd she'd be. </br></br>  I heard that GXP's officially canon LNs are far superior (and without NB, I believe that), so wouldn't it be nice if we got a new anime after OVA 4?  <br>'real' harem endings are just as bad as 'MC doesn't make a choice at all' endings.</br>  <br>People still remember that?<br>Wonder what happened to Happosai. He just seemed to disappear after the last chapter.</br></br>  <br>How many series have gone the "real harem end" route?</br>  <br>How?<br><br> Everyone is happy <br> no depressed women "who want their beloved to be happy" <br> it's always the worst girl who wins (except Universe canon, Ryoko is best girl   but only in Unverse <br><br>I guess Love Hina really turned me off to that shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Buddy, only written thing I've ever fapped to. <br><br>That dude must've been doing some sort of writing major, his work was magnitudes above all other fanfics/lemons. He never answered any emails I sent to his uni address.<br><br>Would've loved to see that story continue, especially since Nagi was getting involved, even her scene was hot as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Mihoshi went from being a ditzy, lazy genius in the OVA canon to full retard in Universe <br><br>What happened?</br></br>  <br>they gave her a smart beautiful genus for a partner</br>  <br>She got Flandersized.</br>  <br>But then they gave her another, and she still stayed the same (only difference is that they act like older-younger sisters now).<br><br>Noike sucks by the way.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Sasami only has two votes <br><br>I will murder each and every one of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here Sasamifag, a gift. I'm salty that Mihoshi is so low myself. Maybe they just remember retard Mihoshi instead of second best girl Mihoshi.</br>  Why was Isekai no Seikishi so great  <br>Literally the only elf I don't want to see raped.</br>  <br>Best girls.</br>  <br><br>Lots of Aura and Lashara, some good fights, long episodes meant a lot could happen in each ep, plot that stood on its own without Tenchinanigans needed to prop it up. And the comedy was just solid fun, especially the entire pillow fight scene.</br></br>    <br> That 90's brightness from the back of the cel light.  <br><br>I miss it.</br></br></br>  <br>How could one man be so right? Are you me?<br><br>Quick, who's your favorite Tenchi girl?</br></br></br>  <br>Washu, Mitsuki Rara, Ryoko Balta, and Yukine, respectively.</br>  <br>Waifu2x'd</br>    <br> everyone is happy <br><br>No body is happy sharing their love anon. And with Tenchi you're sharing with like 10 women. Including girls that didn't even have that much interest in Tenchi like Sasami and Ryo-oki. It's all the same thing. I really can't see it working with the girls in Tenchi anyway. Rather than satisfying someone, you disappoint everyone. It's a non-choice.</br></br></br>  <br> And with Tenchi you're sharing with like 10 women.  <br> Including girls that didn't even have that much interest in Tenchi like Sasami and Ryo-oki. <br> Sasami <br> not much interest <br>The fuck show are you watching?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ryo-Oki and Sasami <br> no interest in Tenchi <br>Nigger, what?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sasami has a girlish crush on an older guy, but it isn't even developed much. If you want to argue that Ryo-oki should be a contender and has serious romantic feelings, then yeah you're going to have to show me because I don't remember any.</br></br>  <br>Shit taste, aside from Yukine.</br>  <br>RyoOhki openly tries to help Tenchi as much as she can, going out of her way to protect him. She even blushes when Tenchi compliments her.</br>  <br>you're denser than any harem MC</br>  <br> They turned Mihoshi into a bumbling retard and stripped out her competent parts to make Kiyone as a character.  <br><br>BOOOOOOOO<br><br>COME SE DISE BOOO!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  Ryoko is like beer: cheap, easy to get, and only good for consumption in your home, away from public.<br><br>Ayeka is wine: sophisticated, finely aged, high-brown, and worth showing off in fine company.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking kidding me?</br>  So the best way to watch this is just sticking to the OVA's right  <br>You know as little about alcohol as you do about women.</br>  <br>You fucker. Why aren't you die in a ditch somewhere? It's been over half a decade.</br>  <br> why aren't you die in a ditch <br>Do you have brain damage?</br></br>  <br>OVA1 &gt; OVA2 &gt; GXP &gt; OVA3 &gt; PHOTON &gt; ISEKAI</br>  Brown booty bitches!  <br>Dual after OVA 2.</br>   mfw no more Ryoko   <br>Seeing the horror that are your worst girl reaction images left me momentarily in a stupor. I can't take that much shit taste all at once.</br>  <br> shit taste <br> bleach trip </br></br>      <br> ova3&gt;photon&gt;isekai <br>all good besides that</br></br>  <br> sophisticated <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cAJ<wbr>M30VOl5A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> implying femdom isn't the height of sophistication </br>    I think she is the only anime girl I ever knew who was activately scienced in the anime into being dere  <br>I won't try to pretend that Photon is the height of any quality writing, but nothing deserves to be ranked lower than OVA3. Nothing.</br>  <br><br>While I always like Ryoko, I never found her attractive. Then I saw her like this and goddamn.</br></br>  <br>Photon was a masterpiece of funness. That is all. No higher meaning, no pretentious cock gobbling, just good old fashioned fun. And some quality animation all things considered.</br>  <br>You strike me as a dress pants kind of man. Nothing like a business casual set of black slacks to give you a classy hhhhnngg.</br>  <br>I've been savoring this show for  15   years . I'm about halfway through and I've restarted the series several times. I don't want the ride to end.<br><br>Ryoko best girl</br></br></br>  <br>Since renting the VHS from blockbuster years ago, Papacha's dub has been one of my long-standing guilty pleasures.</br>  I remember when this ran on Toonami way back when and it came on after school. My mom walked in while I was watching a/the beach episode with some kind of swimsuit contest and made me change the channel.<br><br>I went right back watching it and feeling weird in my pants as soon as she left the room.<br><br>Watching Ryoko was like..../ss/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ryoko made many a young boy into a man.</br>  <br> man <br><br>You mean perverts...</br></br></br>  <br>That's not a ranking, it's a watching order.</br>  <br>Tumblr would say those two things are exactly the same. <br><br>Do ho ho.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasami was my first crush. I was about the same age as her at the time it was broadcast on Toonami.</br>  <br>  I was about the same age as her <br>700?</br></br>  <br> my face when seeing my beloved ryoko's new design </br>  <br>Asobi ni Iku Yo<br>And it was EXCELLENT</br></br>  <br>Best and only taste worth noting</br>  I was kinda sad when it turned out airi the gmilf was a red herring before introducing noike. having an older looking final harem member would have been cool.  <br> having an older looking final harem member would have been cool. <br>Agreed. At least there's Flora and Yayoi.</br></br>  <br>Relax my brother of ebony skin tone, it is not canon.</br>  Fact: Tenchi in Tokyo was the greatest deconstruction of harem ever created. Anyone who doesn't like it doesn't understand what it was actually about.  <br>I get it now, but I'm still not going to rewatch it.</br>  <br>Fact: Tenchi in Tokyo was just garbage. Anyone that actually likes it have shit tastes.</br>  <br>I had to go into the vault for this one, friend.</br>      <br>Which one is the 3rd OVA again? There's so much Tenchi OVAs out there.</br>  <br>Ryo-Ohki, the sub-par one. Introduces members of Tenchi's family and the last member of the harem.</br>  <br>Most of /a/ wasn't born when that was a meme.</br>  <br>And that's why most of /a/ doesn't appreciate the genius that is Tenchi in Tokyo.</br>  <br>Apologist please.</br>  <br>Plebeian please.<br><br>Tenchi in Tokyo was not about Tenchi at all, and that's what made it better than all the other Tenchi media. It was about Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and Kiyone and how fucking weird they are without plot expediency always covering up their bullshit.<br><br>And the episodes that are mostly just about Tenchi? They show how fucking boring of a character he is. Those episodes lambast him as the hollow, worthless character that he is. Yoshihiro Takamoto completely deconstructs Tenchi Muyo and shows us how ugly, uninspiring all the characters and settings are. It's 26 episodes of "fuck you, harem cliche'" that manchildren cannot properly appreciate.<br><br>THAT is why Tenchi in Tokyo is an achievement in anime and THAT is why you people, the people who consume the rest of the garbage Tenchi medium, hate it. Because it exposes you. It makes you think. It shows how shallow your tastes are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is pretty stale pasta.</br>  <br>You seem to be under the impression that all of the alternate universe shit is Kajishima's doing.<br><br>Anything not connected to the main OVA universe (e.g. Tenchi TV, TiT, Pretty Sammy TV, the movies etc.) was AIC being greedy fuckers who kept producing cash-in spinoffs, instead of funding a continuation of Kajishima's canon, even though there was material available.</br></br></br>  <br>Could be worse, could end like the manga did.<br><br> Build up the second to last volume where Kagato Disciple shows up and clones Kagato. <br> Turns out to be imperfect so it's just a doll. <br> She also decides to clone Tenchi's Mother <br> Could turn into a huge battle <br> All but the last two issues are Tenchi with an Oedipus complex.  <br> Disciple and Kagato clone get one shot by magical energy. <br> NOTHING CHANGED <br>Glad I never met the artist at a con, I'd have thrown my chair at him for that horrible ending.<br>Also, imagine if /a/ existed during the Toonami run. Because Tenchi Muyo trail blazed some new ideas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tenchi being on Toonami was one of the first instances of having something that wasn't a pure action series being broadcast. Having those pure slice of life episodes are a complete shift from your Gundams or Dragon Balls.</br></br>  <br>I'd love a GXP adaption of the novels, without Nabeshin's self-advertisment brand of directing.<br><br><br>She looked so damn pretty in the first OAV episode.<br><br><br>I was generally ok with the redesigns, but dropped it over it being yet another reboot that seemed flanderize the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was actually better when Mihoshifags were sound asleep.</br>  <br> Mitsuki Rara <br><br>who<br><br>Either way, you are me, except I would have Mihoshi and Washu as a combo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She, like the rest of her species, does S&amp;M to the male during their wedding night.</br>  High quality  <br><br> http://strawpoll.me/4990159 <br>Kiyone needs more love!<br> or at least a promotion </br></br></br></br>  OOOOHOHOHOHO! RYOKO PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY  <br>Well don't worry, Seina gets to be treated by her (whether he wants to or not)!<br><br>Her and Lady Seto (speaking of, GXP's dub is even worse than the 1994 OVA dub) get to have their turns on him, even though he's already married to 9 other women</br></br></br>  <br>Well at least she doesn't whip the shit out of them like a certain dyed hair skank</br>        <br>Shit, I forgot that one isn't SFW.</br>  <br>Muh Dick. God Washu is amazing. Always instantly diamonds.</br>   Sasami is pure     Check this shit out    <br>That's a hell of a geneology. Lets introduce some sex linked dominant/recessive traits and start predicting whether or not a descendant can produce light hawk wings.</br>  <br>I change my vote</br>  <br>Pretty much i think the real reason was just lazy design so they set it up so they could make as many look alikes as possible.</br>  <br><br>I wonder if Juraians are less inbred than their human subspecies.</br></br>  <br><br>How was the new brown girl?</br></br>  <br>Never, I hope. I love Tenchi Muyo! too much to want it dragged through the mud any further by Kajishima. OVA3 and the second cour of GXP were a travesty. Isekai was a return to form, but I couldn't give a fuck about an all new cast. It hurt me deeply to see Ryoko relegated to third string status.</br>  <br>NB is in it but he's not the same thank god. Kajishima has said he wants it to get an anime but I doubt it will.<br><br><br> It was about Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and Kiyone and how fucking weird they are without plot expediency always covering up their bullshit. <br><br>Nigga please. It changed all the sarcasm, back-biting and vindictiveness of the girls into physical violence played off as comedy routines. Tenchi in Tokyo is garbage for trash people.<br><br><br>OVA3 wasn't even that bad and the blame should be placed on the studios for cutting his episode allotment and making him wait so long he gave up on trying to finish it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Second cour of GXP <br> travesty <br><br>It had the god mecha and Seina actually being badass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cour2 was pretty much the only decent part of it.</br>  <br>When did this happen?</br>  <br>Back when anime could have nipples<br>What happened?</br></br>  <br>Blu-Ray sales.</br>  <br>Every time she spoke was sexy Ryoko.</br>  <br>Japanese version of Parernt/Teacher Associations (PTA) cracking down on media and asking for censorship. <br><br>Godless Japan was best Japan. Moralfags have almost ruined it.</br></br></br>  Zero Ryoko....<br>Why are we not including her to the harem again?</br>   Comiket just around the corner <br> New canon Masaki doujin <br><br>Hyped</br></br></br>  <br> Zero Ryoko.... <br> Why are we not including her to the harem again? <br>She is IN Ryoko now. The real Ryoko allowed her to fuse because it benefits her to gain more emotions.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I raised you Minagi</br></br>  <br>GXP has flesh colored nipples, which suck. Even the dog-cat people have colored ones.<br><br><br>No, Ryoko was always a cyborg anon. It's just that she was separated from her more emotional form.</br></br></br></br>       No one translating the material on Ex <br> No one translating GXP LN which is now at 12 books <br> Not even translating Paradise Wars and its 1 volume at the moment <br><br>What the flying fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, Ryoko was always a cyborg anon. It's just that she was separated from her more emotional form. <br> That was a lie by Washu. </br></br>  <br>LN translations have never really been a thing, anon. Not in any large sense. <br><br>It's a shit ton more work than just subbing a show. I'd love for those to get translated, but we'd have to probably get professionals to do it.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe being biased but it feels like every time I turn around there's a new harem LN or WN getting translated.</br>  <br>Damn, that outfit was so sexy, I wish Ryoko wore it more often in the show.</br>  <br>Probably for shows with more current and active fanbases, sadly. <br><br>If only we had the resources and talent we have now back then.</br></br></br>   mfw the thread still lives and has become depressing   Last bump before imminent thread death.  It's kinda sad seeing people shit on the series because of various spin-offs when the creator wants to do something else but frequently gets cockblocked.  <br>What if I told you that there's a ton of untranslated material and canon porn?</br>  <br><br> accept </br></br>  <br>What if I told you I already knew those things exist, but that doesn't help the fact they are not available because of lack of mass appeal.</br>  <br> except <br>English is hard anon.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you check the poll?</br></br>    Man I love anything an all tenchi related, except Tokyo. so i'll eat this shit up    All waifus are beautiful.<br><br>Which three adjectives would you use to describe your waifu?</br></br>  <br>Brave, Benevolent, Beautiful.</br>  <br>Yunocchi is my wife!<br><br>Cute, diligent, and determined.</br></br></br>  Funny, bad ass, simple  <br>daijoubu, okay, and all right</br>  <br>perfect</br>  Does your waifu ever wear jewelry?<br><br>(Mai wears makeup and nail polish at times in her manga, but we never see her wearing any rings, necklaces, bracelets or earrings.)</br></br>  All anime girls, even the bitchy and evil ones, even the ones in shows I haven't seen or shows yet to be made are my waifu.  <br>Kind, pure, thoughtful</br>  <br>Intelligent, creative, determined.<br><br>Just the way I like 'em.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes indeed, everyone's waifu a cute.<br><br>I'd say shy, brave, and  androgynous .</br></br></br>  How soft is your waifu? Do other characters in her series try to experience her softness?<br><br>(Mai has quite a full figure despite being athletic, so I'd say she's pretty soft. Two of her friends like to feel her up on occasion for that reason.)</br></br>  <br>Bewitching<br>Bespectacled <br>Beauty!<br><br><br>Have not, and she doesn't prioritize things like that. Her glasses are a jewel of her own.<br><br><br>A little soft, but not overly soft.<br><br>I hope you all are doing it for her (or him) today!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  words can not describe how hard I want to do her.  <br>Kind<br>Smart<br>Gentle<br><br><br>She wears a necklace when she's grown up, but her younger self doesn't wear any jewelry<br><br><br>No one has said anything about her softness but she looks really soft</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Posstive<br>Naive<br>Adorable<br><br><br>Nope, she doesn't.<br><br><br>Misao is supposed to be athletic and not really feminine, so i take she isn't very soft, but still, i like it rough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pure </br>    What's the funniest thing your waifu has done?  Hotheaded, serious and fragile.<br><br>Never, apart from the one time she wore a tiara as a part of her ballerina outfit for a talent show.<br><br> She has at least some soft parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Devine, Stalwart and Perceptive.<br>A mere three adjectives of the many I could ascribe to her.<br><br>Not often, Rukia's outfits are usually quite simple, she does not adorn herself in jewelery of any kind unless it's a special occasion.<br><br>Not very, Rukia has a rather petite figure lacking the required assets to appear 'soft'.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Persistent, dutiful, sexy.<br><br>Soft as a plank of wood.</br></br></br>  <br>minchi is kind, hard working and dorky</br>    Playful, Joyful, and Ambitious.<br><br><br>Sometimes. I think that would dampen her active lifestyle.<br><br><br>I think she would be soft in some places but mostly firm because she is quite active.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>me</br>  <br>Streaming?</br>  Draw your waifu  <br>I like your taste anon. I'm a Nozomi man myself, but I can definitely respect your choice.</br>  You and your waifu are attending a ball with all other waifus and husbandos.

Yuzuko is smart, lovely and lively.<br><br><br>She's not the type to wear lots of jewelry.<br><br><br>It's hard to say.

Besides our wedding ring. <br><br><br>She's athletic, but she definitely looks pretty soft. Pic Related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai doesn't really do jokes or pranks. She tends to react to things done by her friends instead. One running gag involving her is that she loves the cooking of one of her friends which sends almost everyone who tastes it to the hospital.<br><br>If Mai used magic to boost her physical abilities I think that she'd have the strength and speed necessary to take out a T. rex.</br></br></br>  Your waifu demands intensely pleasurable anal sex?<br><br>Are you skilled and endowed well enough to provide her with it?</br></br>  Is your waifu active? Would she rather hang out with you outdoors, such as a road trip, picnic, or the ocean, or indoors, such as at home, in a cafe, or a restaurant?  <br>She tried to say the English word "leader" and she sounded so incredibly adorable i couldn't stop laughing<br><br><br>She's more of an indoors person but she doesn't seem to mind going outside</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she is a fun girl but not really a funny one.<br><br><br>No way, she is just a normal girl.<br><br><br>She is totally active, she would choose road trips, picnics and the ocean.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, you're waifu a beautiful too!<br><br>3 adjectives I would choose is - cool, beautiful and quirky<br><br><br>Usually, she wears earrings in the shape of a daimond. At formal events, Erza can be seen wearing more elegant clothes and jewelry. In pic related she is wearing a gold necklace and ruby earrings. <br><br><br>I think she would be quite soft in some areas, but obviously she would also be toned as well due to all her fighting and training. She's actually more likely to feel other girl's softness than the other way round.<br><br><br>I'd say the funniest thing she has done was when she got drunk and started rebuking her other guild members, however she got all their names wrong!<br><br><br>I think she's generally more of an outdoors type so a picnic would be nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does your waifu have any cool or interesting hobbies?  <br>Honk is a very close second</br>  <br>Intelligent, dutiful, driven. Formerly melancholic.<br><br><br>Nope, she's rather plain in that sense, despite the goth lolita attire.<br><br><br>She's hardly "soft", but she turned into a big softie inside as people came to her help in the series.<br><br><br>She isn't very funny.<br><br><br>Shinobu isn't very active and she's more of an indoor person.<br><br><br>She has slightly offbeat fashion sense and likes tea, but that's not massively interesting.<br><br><br>What are some problems in her life you'd be able or like to solve? How about vice versa?<br><br>I'll answer this one; for most of her life, Shinobu always saw the world as dark and in her own words, twisted and ugly, and tried to solve problems via taking them on herself. Through the course of the series she gained more faith in the world and especially when people came to aid. I want her never to feel alone or adrift again - the world isn't sunshine, but it isn't hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quiet, intelligent, sleepy.<br><br><br>Does a hairband count? Otherwise, nothing.<br><br><br>She's small, rather than soft. Small and cute. <br><br><br>If she had a tank, yeah. Otherwise, maybe not.<br><br><br>Definitely not active. But you can still be lazy outdoors.<br><br><br>Sensha-do is pretty cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its called horriblesubs for a reason.</br>  <br>aww shit, you defeated !YUNOcchiS2's script <br><br>How?</br></br></br>  I haven't been in one of these for a few years but I just wanted to say your waifu a cute. Keep the love alive waifuanons.  Say something nice about a random waifu!  <br>so, your waifu is a no name, original piece of whore?</br>  <br>She sings, and plays all sorts of instruments.<br><br><br><br>Mako is a talented individual. I'm sure she won't have difficulties navigating through life.<br><br>Would you set up a small business with you're waifu?<br>Maybe a flower shop, coffee shop, a bookstore, bakery, or even an audio equipment store?<br><br> I think running an audio store with Miku would be incredibly fun. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, she plays vidya and hangs out wirh friends.<br><br><br>I would love to make her a more mature and responsible person.<br><br><br>Fuuka's shyness makes her really cute, also dat short hair.<br><br><br>A bakery or a small restaurant sounds nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erza likes to read novels that are a bit inappropriate, but apart from that, I guess her major hobby is collecting armours to use.<br><br><br>I'd like to help her overcome her fear of letting others into her problems, as she always tries to solve everything by herself. This is a problem she's gradually solving by herself, but still, I would to do anything to help her. <br><br><br>Rukia has a very strong will and I like how she cares deeply about her friends. <br><br><br>I would love to work in a sweet shop with Erza. I'm sure we would be very happy together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Date ideas with waifu?  <br>Help her every now and then with her job.</br>  Levia-San<br><br>Adorable, strong and funny</br></br>  <br>Lazy, flirty, ace.<br><br><br>Nope, she comes from a reasonably well-off family but you'd never guess it!<br><br><br>Not very. She has my preferred petite figure.<br><br><br>Where to start? The most obvious example is stealing a colleague's shimapan, causing a chaotic chain reaction of pantsu-stealing around the base.<br><br><br>Easily.<br><br><br>Not in the least! We go on dates but nothing beats relaxing indoors together.<br><br><br>Uh... sleeping, eating, reading... interesting to me at least!<br><br><br>Dokuro is hilarious and has a radiant smile!<br><br><br>Fighting the Neuroi. The war is the only problem but she does a great job in dealing with it. She's already helped me through a lot of the issues I had as a result of my crappy upbringing, including anxiety, anger and an opiate addiction. If it weren't for Erica, I'd be homeless or possibly dead. Instead, I have my own apartment with her and I'm a much better person than I used to be. I owe her everything.<br><br> 128437910 <br>Nope, it's not our thing.<br><br><br>If I had any, I'd tell you. We just go out, improvise and have fun. It's wise to have a backup plan in mind to fill in any gaps, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuzuko is pretty active, but at the same time she can be pretty lazy; it really depends on her mood. That would depend on how she felt at the moment, although anywhere would be fun as long as we were together.<br><br><br>She does read a bit, and look up random things on Wikipedia.<br><br><br>Miyako has very nice hair.<br><br><br>Running a coffee shop with her would be wonderful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  strong, sexy, and tomboy  <br><br>Yuzuko is the life of her friendships!<br><br><br>I wouldn't mind if I had a bit of a nest egg built up. I'd love an audio or hobby shop, and she could keep me in check if I do something stupid or end up being sick of something I previously liked. She would probably prove better at talking to people than I.<br><br><br>Take her out to a nice cafe and pamper her a bit. This will also allow her to dress up if she likes.<br><br>What is the craziest thing your waifu has done?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You are waifu a shit.  How many people have hentaifu, do you think? Threads about the latter tend to get quite long.  I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <br> Oh my, you're too kind. Miku is likewise a talented young lass, as well as being super cute. <br>A bookstore would be great. Maybe with a little cafe at the front so people can drink tea while they read.<br><br><br>Woodland picnics, walks (piggyback rides) through the countryside, that sort of thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confident, Teasing, Controlling<br><br>None<br><br>She has arcane and technological stuff at her disposal so fairly soft, I think she averages at around 2 place in levels of soft in her series.<br><br>Break the 4th wall and be aware<br><br>Easily<br><br>Anything I like, she likes<br><br>Teach her how to play fighting games<br><br> Good luck guessing who she is </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai is pretty fit and has been out on excursions. I think she's fine with either indoor or outdoor activities.<br><br>She doesn't really have a specific hobby. She just hangs out with her friends in her free time. She's very skilled in swordsmanship if that counts.<br><br>Mai is pretty capable and willing to address her problems. Her main goal is to prove herself to her father, which is something I think she'd want to do by herself.<br><br>I was at the right place at the right time.<br> <br>Miyako shows great persistence.<br><br>Mai is of aristocratic descent so, while she has no hangups about her lineage and isn't snobbish, I do not think it would be fitting for her. Also I wouldn't want that either.<br><br>Deliberately? Sneaking into her school with her friends at night in order to investigate the 7 mysteries of the campus, which ended up setting off all of the building's defensive systems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful<br>Overachiever<br>Cheeky<br><br>She does! She's often shown wearing necklaces and has pierced ears. I absolutely love her silver heart earrings.<br><br>She has a round, soft face, which is noted a few times.<br>Other than that, her thighs and stuff look soft but I can't imagine they're terribly soft considering she's an athletic model.<br><br>She runs track and field, but I feel like she would like a mix of both. Maybe a picnic and a jog, and then cool down with some iced coffee in a cafe.<br><br>She's a 14-16 year old girl who's into loli imouto eroge/media, I'd say that's pretty interesting.<br><br>Shinobu's EGL fashion is super cute!<br><br>I think running a clothing shop with her would be very nice, since both of us are experienced with fashion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Determined<br>Decisive<br>Radiant <br><br><br>Not unless hairclips count.<br><br><br>Only in the sense of having a curvy figure. <br><br><br>Planned and executed an overcomplicated Count of Monte Cristo revenge scheme in a failed attempt to destroy her evil, abusive mom.<br><br><br>I can't imagine how, but I'm confident she'd find a way.<br><br><br>She doesn't like sitting around, and she stays in shape, but I wouldn't really call her "active" in the athletic sense. When she has downtime we relax at home, or get together with friends. About once a year, we plan a sightseeing vacation. <br><br><br>She likes reading nonfiction books, mostly history and biographies of famous leaders. She also enjoys live music, especially classical. <br><br><br>I want to support her as she deals with her history of sexual abuse. <br><br>She wants me to be more self-confident.<br><br><br>She already runs a major fashion label. I'm not heavily involved in either the business or creative sides of it, but it can still be fun and interesting to tag along. Last spring, we got to meet Derek Zoolander!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fighting superpowered bad guys with superpowers sounds pretty cool, and collecting mountains of seductive lingeries is super interesting.<br><br>I have only known improv and last minute, but it has always worked out. Doesn't help, I know.<br><br>Trying to stop an armed robbery when she was probably 10 was pretty crazy, and stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you!<br>Beautiful, intelligent, demure.<br><br>No, she doesn't. She doesn't place a lot of importance on material possessions.<br><br>I'd say relatively. Unless her scars take away from that.<br><br>No.<br><br>She'd rather stay indoors, preferably alone with each other.<br><br>She likes to read. There's also a game she plays with the tiles on the floor of the school, but not much else. Pretty boring.<br><br>Well, the obvious answer would be her anxiety and self loathing. At the same time, I don't want to "solve" them for her, because at the end of the day, they're her problems she has to deal with. I guess I want to be her support, to make her believe she's worth all the live I could give her and to help her help herself.<br><br>Sure! Probably a bookstore; she loves reading.<br><br>Dinner somewhere quiet, maybe a walk in a park somewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw feeling lazy to reply all these questions   <br>I have been too lazy to answer for the past six months.  That and answering the same shit for the 200th time doesn't help either </br>  <br>Sometimes I try to bring some funny questions to break the ice.  Like what would Anon do if he caught his waifu baneposting <br><br>I want people to be innovative with questions.</br></br></br>  <br>Dirty, perverse, and adorable.<br><br><br>On stage, most likely (have to get facial tones right so you don't look pale on stage). Off the stage, I'm not too sure about that.<br><br><br>Sadly, no. <br><br><br>Tell the team working on the Amaburi PV to add  muscular men  in it.<br><br><br>Not a chance.<br><br><br>She's sociable, but would most likely want to stay indoors and work on her doujin circle's latest work.<br><br><br>Writing BL doujins would probably cool if I was into that.<br><br><br>Helping the park she works at to reach its expected visitor numbers.<br><br><br><br>Your waifu has a strong integrity and unwavering morals.<br><br><br>Running a doujin store with her would be a blast, we'd bicker endlessly over which genres should go in which areas.<br><br><br>Go somewhere garden-related.

It's funny they kept Miia's face from that small panel  <br>Mr hands pls</br>  He's the worst part of the show and sadly, he takes all the screen time  how can you guys enjoy this without nipples    That series is garbage and people who like are fucking disgusting.  <br>The fanbase is full of crossboarders so it's baby first harem for them.</br>  <br>So, what are you doing here, faggot?</br>  <br>They probably compile shedding and director chapters in one episode.</br>  <br>You mean the shedding happens and then the next day/half of episode is the director stuff?</br>  <br>Yes, and next episode is Ranchee's appearing and jealous Centorea chapters.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br>Nice meme!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br>Why would you care about secondaries in a harem adaptation<br> implying there's plot or any notable character development </br></br>  <br> not liking anti spiral darling <br><br>Get a load of this new faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br>First, you discard any dignity you still have.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br> x, x everywhere <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431576 <br>You fags screaming secondaries left and right are just as bad</br>  <br><br>Easily.<br><br>Sheer willpower would allow me to, solely because it was with Miia,</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431576 <br>Doesn't that post imply he read the manga?

Next episode will be the shedding chapter and Suu arriving.</br>  The horse girl is the best because she is cute  <br>You mean Suu surviving. Look at the preview</br>  <br>MCs being clueless to a specific scene(s) in general isn't limited to haremshit.</br>  Papi &gt; Smith = Miia &gt; Cerea<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br> Not including more girls </br>  <br>Which is why it's such a shame that she's attached to a big ugly horse body.</br>  <br>Well, sweet slime rape will begin.

Yes.<br><br>Cuter than Miia? Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> birdbrain or normal human <br> superior to Lamia </br></br></br>  <br>I find it encouraging that the show is popular enough for so many people to come on and insult it. Its a compliment really, unpopular things tend to get ignored.</br>  <br>The trouble is the "character development" people seem to want tends to be things that would end a major element of its comedy (i.e. more of the girls figuring out how to not hurt Kimihito), or end the series itself (him picking one or all the girls). On the latter, as much as I would like to see Kimihito's married life, it seems unlikely the series would be as popular if it focused on that.<br><br>Also, given how the series has covered only a pretty short span of time (a couple months at most), its had a reasonable amount of character development. Course much of that has been revealing just who the characters already are in more detail.</br></br></br>  <br>Ive watched the scene like 5 times already where she introduces her, its just too adorable</br>   Yfw they skip the MON chapter so there's more Mero early   <br> &gt;Wanting to fuck horse pussy <br>No, I want Cerea not a horse.</br></br>  <br> only 5 times <br>I've watched that first half at least 2 dozen times by now, I get a heart attack every time</br></br>  <br><br> hurting MC <br> comedy <br><br>do people actually think this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> horses are disgustingunless Z-ton draws them <br>Horitomo centaurs are cute too.</br></br>  <br>I think they're supposed to laugh when he gets hurt sometimes. I self insert instead</br>  <br>Horitomo can go fuck himself after the last doujin he made</br>  <br>I don't like NTR too. But the story of the donkey centaur, the tsundere lizard and others doujins are nice and heartwarming.</br>  <br>supposedly a handsome guy makes her hot and then another centaur fucks her like horses do</br>  <br>But Cerea has a big fat stinky horse cunt, you can't get around it anon.</br>  <br>I do as well<br><br>I really want Miia to rape me and hug me so tight and close that she breaks a rib when we both cum at the same time and I impregnate her</br></br></br>  BEST<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>GIRL<br>I<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I just unlocked the 1500 point second letter for Miia<br><br>Can someone translate?</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna go home and re watch it and then EP 3 since I forgot it released yesterday</br>  <br>Or you know, kick the centaur on the head and fuck her yourself</br>  <br>This. Please shut up.</br>  <br>What if a centaur woman was a shotacon?</br>   two weeks until worst girl   <br>Shes a big girl</br>  <br>But two weeks for MON.</br>  <br>2 years until monstergirls invade the real world</br>  <br>this was the 1100 pic for Miia? haven't seen it until now</br>  Well the MC could be worse I guess. He could be Kampher 2.0  <br>do centaurs sport more pair of tits on their horse parts<br><br>and why is she covering her horse part chest? Her genitals is way behind her.</br></br></br>  <br>Cerea is incredibly moe.</br>  <br>Ya, I unlocked it awhile ago<br>I also have those 3 face response app things that I can post when I get home<br>And I posted her second letter a bit earlier in the thread</br></br></br>  <br>The more clothing they put on Miia, the more she looks like a worm.</br>  <br>Sasuga Chiyo Sakura</br>  <br>Imagine Monmusu with Muromi instead of Mero. Or even better, Levia-san. I mean, just any fish who's actually interesting.</br>  I like Miia, she's cute.  What if mero's dad is a serial killer  <br>Its allowed to be considered funny in part because he recovers so fast. And given he tends to get hurt unintentionally I find it a lot more tolerable than the mean-spirited "how dare you accidentally touch me" injuries harem MCs suffer in other series.<br><br>It also makes Rachnera look better so that's a plus. ^_^ I do have to suspend some disbelief though that the other girls still haven't learned better how to control themselves (perhaps if, like Rachnera, they ever inflicted an injury that lasted more than a few panels they would take things more seriously).</br></br></br>  <br> Levia instead of Mero <br><br>Best show.</br></br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off back to plebbit, you shitfuck</br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  Kind of a weird thing to notice but I did too. I think they took it a bit too far in the last episode.  Not going to lie: the jokes aren't really landing for me the second time around. Watching the anime is just reminding me of all the things I didn't like about the manga like the non-entity of an MC  <br>I'm only watching it for scenes with my waifu</br>  <br>It's not just ass and tits man. Legs also work well with a good ass and tits.</br>  <br>It's a good thing I don't take things here seriously, I guess that face has negative connotations here. Consider me naïve.</br>  <br>Consider what we know of the other parents, unlikely. He's probably a human prince or something that gave up his royalty to be with Mero's mom.</br>  <br> Miia <br>They are all cuter than her.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense if mero mom is royalty Then why would he give up royalty</br>  <br>Aside from parodying morons from other sites, emoticons haven't been considered acceptable on 4chan for at least 5 years.</br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  MON SQUAD WHEN?<br>LALA WHEN?</br>  <br>smith a shit.<br>that pig voice.</br></br>  <br> talking shit about Yu Kobayashi <br><br>This is some poor bait. Not even worth a bait image.</br></br></br>  <br>think whatever you want.</br>  <br>I have nothing against people liking Lala, but you have to admit that she is the most underdeveloped character so far.</br>  <br>MON in two weeks.<br><br>Lala never.</br></br></br>  <br>This being terrible bait is a fact, anon.</br>  <br>Sure, but I feel like she has the most potential for development. <br><br>I mean, I like her this much despite the lack of development. I will love her with some development, I imagine.</br></br></br>  <br>Cereas ears.<br><br>I wanna touch them a play with them.</br></br></br>  <br>A bit longer than that <br>I remember people being shat on for it back in 2007</br></br>  <br> Lala never <br> implying </br></br>  <br>I want to nibble them while she squirms and pants.</br>  Which one of Zombina's eyes is originally hers, the yellow one or green one?  <br>I pretty much only come on here to see comments on Monster Musume, read the translations from Translator Fag etc. I know little of general 4chan stuff.</br>  <br>Where the he'll are you people coming from?</br>  Wouldn't this anime if better if they weren't monsters?<br><br>If it was just 3 cute girls all dating Darling-kun with the intent of marrying him?</br></br>  <br>Look kid, lemme help you not embarrass yourself and also not make this place more of a shithole than it already is. I'll give you a little bit of advice.<br>Stop posting.</br></br>  Ok so a Scylla is next. Predictions on her personality or the awkward situation Kimihito will be placed in?  <br> Wouldn't this anime if better if they weren't monsters? <br>Absolutely not</br></br>  <br>No, that's stupid.</br>  <br>GET.....OUT</br>  <br>You're mean</br>  <br>That's fucking sick</br>  <br>I've been reading and posting about the Musume threads here for over a year, no reason to stop over one emoticon. In fact, I think this is the first time I've offended anybody here.</br>  Will Darling get any more harem members, or will is just be monsters of the week from now on like the farm chapter?  What's the point of including a girl if she has no chance of winning?  <br>I think the house is crowded enough. Hell Lala doesnt really have that much of a reason to be there</br>  <br>leave and don`t come back</br>  <br>But this way, the monster is on the outside of the girl.</br>  <br>Where did you come from</br>  <br> we want the pedo audience<br>i see her more as a sister than an actual competitor</br></br>  Anybody got the English lamia subspecies end thingy?  <br> pedo <br> same age as the others <br> body isnt even young looking, just petite </br></br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>The fuck you mean papi isn't winning?</br>  <br>But Horse pussy's already there.</br>  <br>not even in the running really, her and Suu are in the same boat of being adopted daughters or sisters like you said</br>    <br>None of them are in the running.<br><br>It will be a harem end or nothing.</br></br></br>    <br>I need the practice, so I transcribed it as best I can. Like the others, Miia's second note is basically an apology for some unspecified thing, she says she likes that he takes care of them, and she loves him. Wait for TF or someone with a better grasp than I for high quality translation.<br><br> だぁりん <br>  <br> このまえは、怒ってごめんね。 <br>  <br> だぁりん、私のこと想って言ってくれたのに。 <br> ほんとうに、ごめんあさい。 <br>  <br> いつも優しくしてくれるだぁりんが、 <br> 私は大好きです。 <br>  <br> だぁりんとずー、一緒にいられるように、 <br> これからはちゃんと言うこと聞くね。 <br>  <br> だぁりん、大好きだよ。 <br>  <br> ミーア </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this one gets it</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Everyone assumes its a harem ending, which it very well may be. But hypothetically, what if Crabman did decide to have a single victor? How would that even go over for the fanbase?</br>    <br>How can Darling-kun afford to feed these girls? He mentioned Miia and Papi ate a lot and I'm sure Cerea eats like a literal horse. how is he not broke? Does he ever work?</br>  <br>he would probably get murdered</br>  <br>Government</br>  <br>Later explained in the manga</br>  <br>Possibly, but Id give the crab points for having the balls to do so.</br>  <br>Explain?<br><br>I forgot about keeping up with the manga long ago. Didn't even read until Suu's arrival.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga</br>    <br>Welfare money. Liberals will defend this.</br>  <br>Read the bloody manga</br>  <br>These are pretty bad. I thought I remembered downloading one where they didn't just try to type over the Japanese.</br>  <br>Well first off shame on you. But as for your answer, Kurusu was struggling with a budget until he found out Smith would compensate those expenses.</br>  <br><br>Nah.<br><br>There are many leeches on this board.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of the monster jokes wouldn't be there.</br>  Will you faggots ever stop spoonfeeding  <br>as long as it gives me qt3.14 monstergirls</br>  <br>I absolutely will not read the Manga</br>  <br>And also posting the original Japanese.<br><br>Anyone know what font I should use? I'm gonna redo these so the words don't cover any more than the original Japanese text did. Because muh Crabman's art.</br></br></br>  <br>then don't complain when you don' get something</br>    <br>Olive Garden serves a better pasta than this...</br>  <br>I dunno why, but the combination of ridiculously large tits, the way she dresses and her horse body makes her unbelievably repulsive to me. Like vomit-inducing repulsive. I feel physically ill whenever I see her on screen.</br>  <br>I feel physically ill when I see your posts.</br>  <br>You're the one complaining</br>  <br>I'm not even a Cereafag and I think you're a faggot</br>  <br> That's just you wanting to throw up all that shit from having shit taste.</br>  <br><br>flying miia is the best.</br></br>  <br><br> sametails <br>Crabman is a hack.</br></br></br>  <br>So is God, because every snake with the exception of rattle snakes have the same tail. Rattlesnakes are the SJWs of the snake world, because "LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH, SILLY SERPENTS!"</br>  <br>If you see just her face, she's cute, but the further down you go, the worse it gets.</br>  What did the author do before this and his other series got published? He only had those small doujins before that, right? Assistant work or something?  <br>Posting the other English one as well. Too troublesome to directly transfer from phone to netbook.</br>  <br><br>Not him but I haven't even touched the anime. What chapter do they explain that? At ch. 21 by the way.</br></br>  <br>Sometime after chapter 21.</br>  <br>And as a manga only fag, how is the anime so far? Because like I said I haven't touched it yet.</br>  <br> You will never pet a Medusa's head. <br><br>God is a true bastard.</br></br></br>  <br>its almost exact except for the censorship here and there</br>  <br>Average</br>  <br>I like lamias, but logically Centorea sp? really is the best girl she hurts the mc far less then the others and really looks out for him its actually pretty touching.</br>  <br>Animated monstergirls but censorship everywhere</br>  <br>Imagine the shits she must take...</br>  <br>Anime voices match manga voices</br>  <br>Just as shallow and cute, I read the manga a few years back how did that end up?</br>  <br>Meaning the voices are what you expected to sound like?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128435487 <br> SECONDARY </br>  <br>What if you use an actual horse?</br>  <br>Hell no, the only good voices for now are Cerea and Smith's</br>    In the translation of the Manga I read, Papi calls Darling "Husband", but she calls him Master in the anime. I really dislike that she's being used as the loli-body train for the incest and maid fanbases.  <br>No I did not mean that</br>  Do you prefer Papi referring to him as either Master, Husband, or Boss?  If Papi gave you a handjob, would she fly?  <br><br>Rattlesnakes have actually stopped rattling-a number of them, at least</br></br>  <br>Husband, honestly. I still don't understand the logic behind Boss for some reason...</br>  <br>No one care about her, anyway</br>  <br>I think it stems from Miss Smith telling Papi that Kurusu is the boss of the house and should listen to him or something.</br>  <br>Rude</br>  <br>Considering the genre, all of them have about the same chance as anyone else. Doppel could suddenly win the Darling bowl in the next chapter and no one would be surprised. Although, it's a moot point since it's a given he will end up with Lala, no matter who he chooses.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128431417 <br>This is an anime board first and foremost, it's retards like you who should fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Her ears are awful design</br></br>  <br>Then stop watching this shit and read the manga.</br>  <br>I should really check out the 7Sea release one of these days. See for myself just how much of a trainwreck it is.</br>  <br> ridiculously large tits <br>peadophile detected</br></br>  <br>it's a fresh dank meme</br>  <br>As someone who hasn't read the manga, is this just going to be "DAARIIING~~" getting abused and continiously used as a slipper for 10 more episodes? Because that seems like lost potential<br><br> I do want to fuck Cerea though, so there's that </br></br></br>  <br>I buy it mainly to support Crabman, but yeah they need to proofread that shit. Tio and Polt were accidentally referred to as Tia and Port -_-</br>  <br>I'm not sure if Papi and Cerea are using the exact same words to call Kimihito, but yeah the fansubs use "Master" regardless. <br><br>I'm curious how the english dub will do it</br></br></br>  <br> -_- <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Port I can understand, but Tia? Where'd that come from?</br>  <br> http://imgur.com/a/GEpNq</br>  <br>If you haven't bought the english volumes, then that means you bought the original versions, right?<br><br>Anyway, I guess 7seas has a lot of silly animal puns, I remember mostly when the girls are making fun of Cerea. Other than the jokes I think it's a fine translation though I have not compared it to the online translations</br></br></br>  <br>Horse shit is way cleaner than human shit nigga.</br>  <br>I prefer Boss. Calling him Master seems too formal for her.</br>  <br>Well Papi uses they typical Goshujin, while Cerea uses a ceremonial form that I don't know the romaji for.</br>  <br>Considering that Sentai has the license for it, I shudder at the thought.<br><br>Hillary Haag as either Papi or Suu. I'm willing to wager dollars to donuts on this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Duh. No wonder I haven't heard that yet.</br>  <br>Does Hound do the translations? I remember someone explaining how it's hard to translate the exact term Papi uses into english.</br>  <br>It was some kind of mistranslation, but kept in for consistency's sake.<br>Papi is saying something like "boss."</br></br>  <br><br>If Papi can lift Miia, why can't Melusines lift themselves?</br></br>  <br>My guess is that they forgot Tio is suppose to be short for Tionishia and used an actual female name for their translation.</br>  <br>Read the credits page.</br>  New video<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14375<wbr>65938</wbr></br>  <br>People seem to worship horse pussy, but would centaurs even feel human dicks?<br>Centaurs can only mate with other centaurs.</br></br>  <br> It is Miia's toothbrush </br>  <br>Well, the shu in goshujin is the same kanji as the su in Kurusu. Also the same as Aruji(Cerea). And yes, they're from the root Chinese word for Master</br>  So, every time he rides Cereal, she can feel his balls and dick on her back, huh?  <br>If they're equipped exactly like horses, then no a human dick wouldn't do squat, she wouldn't feel anything and your dick wouldn't even penetrate far enough for impregnation to occur. So you sex life would have to consist of lots of fisting and if you wanted to have kids it'd have to be done through artificial insemination.</br>  <br>Most likely, since he also must get hard from grabbing on her tits.</br>  <br><br> believing chuuni delusions when they've been explicitly revealed as such in the manga </br></br>  <br>If you've read the manga you'd know that Cerea is born of a Centaur mother and a human father, so I guess it works out. Snake pussy wouldn't work either, going on real world anatomy, since cloacas have no muscles.</br>  <br>Thanks. Think I'll probably still redo them, just for redrawing practice, as well as the big white chunks cut out of the girls triggering my autism.</br>  <br>Eh, Cerea was conceived somehow, so I doubt centaurs have the full same physiology of an actual horse.</br>  <br>For some reason, I can't get tired of hearing the sheep-counting, especially when Papi does it.<br><br> Possible to get the same from Suu, Mero, and Rachnee in the future. <br><br>The suspense is terrible. I hope it'll last.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well in Monmusu at least we know that Lamia's have the same set up as humans, with the vagina being where the tail starts.</br>  <br>Where do they shit?</br>  <br>from their asshole, they have a normal butt</br>  <br>We've never actually seen it so that could just be the cloaca.<br><br>In which case  it all comes out and goes in the same hole.<br><br>I think it's better to just assume that in a grand coincidence humans and monster girls are perfectly sexually compatible.

I have a faint recollection of that, but I might be wrong</br>  <br>Nope. The sumo date went from talking about yokozuna to plain musubi to  Disgusting </br>  <br>None of the boys know of her birthday.</br>  <br> I have a faint recollection of that <br>What the hell? Tanabata wasnt even mentioned till 130 something chapters when gakuto said something and then again when kiyoshi was having his journey under the futon.</br></br>  What could have been  <br>It will be, just wait for the blu-rays</br>  <br>Pretty much a preview of the BDs, which will be released when?</br>  <br>I think its says 9/30 right there <br><br>right?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a smart person, thanks</br>  Next chapter is going to be pretty good.<br><br>These next few chapters will resolve many questions around the series. How exciting.</br></br>  <br> resolve many questions around the series <br>There are only 3 questions that will be answered.<br><br> Who is Andre's real mistress? <br> What is Kate's trump card? <br> Does Mari like Kiyoshi? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm predicting a Meiko vs Andre battle once Kate let's him go berserk on Mari</br>  <br>kates trump card was using andre</br>  <br>Using Andre was also Mari's trump card.<br>Andre is a giant walking card with a small face.</br></br>  will we ever find out why an all girls school would hold a wet t-shirt contest? am I just thinking too hard about this?  <br>You forget<br><br> Does Chiyo actually know about Hana and Kiyoshi? <br> Does Kiyoshi know that Hana actually likes him? <br> What is Hana's backstory? <br><br>These are most of the big questions in this manga and they will be answered within the next ten chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the USC was lying to them.</br>  <br>For the yuri loving students, of course</br>  <br> Your school didn't? I'm sooo sooorry anon. <br><br>My school held a camping trip and one of the games consisted of hosing the opposition. I hope that counts.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are not going to be answered in 10 chapters. Kiyoshi still doesn't realize it; this will be the main conflict going forward for the next 5 years.<br><br><br>Because it's  the Boys Wet T-Shirt Contest. They'll be like targets in a Capture The Flag-style battle royale where the girls try to soak them for points, and then auctioned off for the night to the highest bidder like the last scene of Groundhog Day. </br></br></br></br>  <br>but then what if, theyre getting chased. and they run and hide behind bushes. and the student council orders a charge to finally get them and just as everyone surrounds them, they bust out of the bushes inside a giant 5 man plastic bottle rocket ship tank with water gun turrets and just rule the battlefield, and then later on they take it to the river and hand out the reservation tickets and they finally get all their summer hopes and dreams.</br>  <br>No, they'll be split up into 5 different teams and dragged around the battlefield.</br>  <br><br><br>The time dilation is just going to increase. Soon each chapter will only be a few seconds of their time. The summer won't come in our lifetimes</br></br></br>  <br>flash news: women like boobs too</br>  <br><br>That's Kate.</br></br>  <br>MAybe he'll start adding completely random monologues and images into the normal story events, like what he did when Hana finally  pissed on Kiyoshi. </br>  <br>I was getting into the adventure of Principle Butt. It will turn into a collection of manga with prison school being a side note.</br>   Kiyoshi considers himself boob man <br> chases after flats like Chiyo and Hana  <br> only boy to never show interest in Meiko  <br>Plothole much?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forgot how happy he was when he joined Mari and Meiko in school prison?</br>  <br>Chiyo isnt flat?</br>  <br><br> My Theories so far <br><br> Who is Andre's real mistress? <br>Risa, He's more dedicated to her than VP<br> What is Kate's trump card? <br>She didn't use Hana and Kiyoshi's photos yet so it might be one of her trump card. Hana's blackmail photos becomes Kate's Trump card for blackmailing her. They need to go deeper<br> Does Mari like Kiyoshi? <br>as?, i can see Mari respecting Kiyoshi but liking him?..nahh<br> Does Chiyo actually know about Hana and Kiyoshi? <br>She's Speculating<br> Does Kiyoshi know that Hana actually likes him? <br>Kiyoshi wouldn't even think about that<br> What is Hana's backstory? <br>isn't obvious? Karate dad and Tea something Mother (or Role Reversal) blah blah blah decency blah blah wear pants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boobman in the Outside, Assman in the Inside</br>  Preview for EP 3<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XDh<wbr>bM0cClHE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, and he realized that after he saw Mari's ass. He's assman in the closet.</br>  hitchhiker is Kates mother. calling it now.  <br>Time to see Gakuto's ultimate sacrifice animated.</br>  <br> Gakuto's ultimate sacrifice <br>what?</br></br>  <br>where he ruins a perfectly good set of headphones</br>  <br>what a shithead</br>  <br>....<br>The Figurine, Boy. Have you forgotten...ALREADY?</br></br>  <br>that's not for a while though</br>  So, is Hana going to win or what?  <br>No, Mari will win.</br>  <br>No, Chiyo will win</br>  <br>No, Kate will win.</br>  <br>No, shinai fugly will win.</br>  <br>No, Gakuto will win.</br>  <br> No, Chairman will win. </br>  <br>I personally can't wait for the episode where Gakuto shits himself in the middle of class.</br>  <br>No, Andre will win.</br>  <br><br>No, Meiko will win.</br></br>  <br>No, Anzu will win</br>  I feel kind of bad for Kate, the way Mari abused her feelings. <br><br>Also just like in School Rumble  dumbass main guy x blonde tsundere best pairing </br></br>  <br><br>Kate's just as much a bitch as Mari, hard to feel sorry for her.</br></br>  <br>At least she got half an hour in heaven.</br>  <br><br>Is Mari's Cunt really heaven?</br></br>  <br>He has already won.<br><br><br>The bully deserved it.<br>Every part of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, having sex for the first time, with the person you've made your goddess and obsessed about for years must be a fantastic experience.</br>  I wish to call something to attention, something that everyone has seem to forgotten. It wouldn't be right for us to just move on from anything unless we have been sure to have dealt with them in the fullest sense of the word. That we who consider what has happened until now will also have to remember that we hold the highest responsibility of remembering that the USC was, and still is an enemy of the boys. That they may have begun to help each other doesn't make up for the fact that Mari, Meiko and Hana are no less deserving of punishment than the normal student council. I see that people are starting to empathize, but this is just a case of "The enemy of mine enemy is my friend". After this is solved we still have to remember the immense bullying done from the USC and that they still have within their agenda the expulsion of the boys.  <br><br>That's what the next arc's going to be about.</br></br>  <br> implying the end is not near </br>  <br>First there is that food thing those 3 will do<br><br>Imo in the new arc Mar/Kiyoshi will have more situation like Hana/Kiyoshi, with Chiyo always a cuck, like she deserve.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, is 185 already out? Anyone got a link?</br>  <br> backward ntr <br>You ntrfags sure are obsessed</br></br>  <br>No, Cake-san will win</br>  <br>Why bullying Chiyo? She may be the worst girl for Kiyoshi, but aside from being boring character, she's nice and deserves happiness with some sumo star.</br>  Piss fetish<br><br>Never thought I would see an anime character with one.</br></br>  Prison School needs more lewd content. There's no Mari doujinshi, just only one of Hana.<br>I want to impregnate Mari, where's my hentai.<br><br>Cake&gt;Anzu&gt;Chio</br></br></br>   prison school threads are now pissfag circlejerks <br>Hana ruined everything.</br>  <br> Crying <br> Piss fetish <br>The Fuck!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>look at this fucking square lol</br></br>  <br>Why create lewd content when manga will always look way better? There is that one shitty Kiyoshi/Hana doujin, if that's the alternative, I'll stick to manga.</br>  <br><br>I just want to see Mari and Kate's scene explicitly.</br></br>  <br>Her name's Diamond-san.</br>  <br>Doujin can go further than manga<br>Like  in full details.</br></br>  What is this about  <br> Father is an overdramatic porn addict and assman <br> Sister is a huge misandrist with daddy issues <br><br> Somehow people think that in this family is someone normal. <br> Somehow people think that in this story is someone normal. <br><br>I'm just waiting for Chiyo's mask to shatter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> backward ntr <br>What does this term even mean?</br></br>  <br>are you impying they have never been?</br>  Gentlemen, there is an issued we urgently need to discuss, one which was pending for far too long.<br><br>The issue of the kind of pubic hair each girl has.<br><br>My views on the matter are as follows:<br><br>Mari: properly trimmed into a simple, pleasing shape<br><br>Meiko: fully waxed at all times<br><br>Hana: almost no hair to begin with, just a hint of something growing there<br><br>Chiyo: similar to Mari, albeit more plain than pleasing<br><br>Kate: makes it look like what she presumes Mari has, however it ends up being more base and porn-star like<br><br>Rube Goldberg-chan: full bush<br><br>Risa: full wax<br><br>Cake-chan: similar to Hana, but a bit more pronounced because of darker hair<br><br>Anzu: simple, practical shave<br><br>Complaints and criticism are always welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a school with two repressive student councils and an auschwitz facilities nearby and you question the contest of all things.</br>  <br>He doesn't chase Hana, it's the other way around.<br><br>Chiyo is "the cutest in his class".<br><br>He doesn't show interest in Meiko because he got infatuated with Chiyo. Same with other boys who got girls later.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tears of happiness.</br>  <br> Rube Goldberg-chan <br>who</br></br>  <br>The whole shaved vs. non-shaved debate boils down to one simple observation. Consider the following:<br><br>If the pussy, including the mons pubis, looks good, then you see more of it without pubic hair.<br><br>If the pussy is aesthetically pleasing, then covering it with pubic hair will make you see less of it.<br><br>Contrariwise, if the pubic hair looks good, then why shave it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that Hana's pussy is ultra hairy.</br>  <br> Mari: properly trimmed into a simple, pleasing shape <br>this is exactly what I imagined. A nice little triangle.</br></br>  <br><br>Ah, but you are forgetting one thing. The hair and the pussy can complement each other, thus increasing the overall aesthetic experience.<br><br>Just as a woman wearing erotic clothing can look much sexier than if she were completely naked, so can the right combination of hair and flesh.<br><br>Fully shaved vaginas, just like completely naked women, leave nothing to the imagination, which is why both are predominant in porn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Contrariwise, if the pubic hair looks good, then why shave it? <br>reading comprehension on /a/</br></br>  <br> backward ntr <br>wouldn't that be a nice guy with a tiny dick turning a slut into a pure loving woman by having a ton of awful sex with her?</br></br>  <br> Hana <br> not ultra hairy <br>Her pussy called medusa for a reason.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, the reason being it turns Kiyoshi's mushroom into stone.</br></br>  <br>No, that's <br> double backward reversed drift NTR </br></br>  <br>No, in friday ususally realease</br>  <br> Didnt understand the metaphor <br><br>Jesus christ.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, he might get turned on by excessive bush. All we know is that he likes what he sees.<br><br>I still maintain that this probably accurate as far as Hana is concerned. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying those snake hairs are not a sign of jungle on her pussy </br></br>  <br> Snake <br> Reptile <br> Hair </br></br></br>  <br>It's a symbolism for a long pubic hair.</br>  <br>Then you see in the futon chapters that she has no hair there. You are completely missing the point of the medusa metaphor.</br>  <br>Her hair is censored, moron. Hana has ultra bush in there. Stop being in denial. If you can't be a hanafag if you don't love her jungle.</br>  <br><br>And you forgot<br><br>  what is the real face of Joe? </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a prophetic meta joke about anime character voiced by same VA as snake in monogatari. Just can't be anything else.</br>  <br>it's about prison in school.</br>  <br>No, Kiyoshi will win</br>  MT finally works again!<br>http://mangatopia.net/main/</br>  <br><br>Neat.</br></br>  <br><br>He has already won, anon.</br></br>  <br> &gt;double backward reversed drift NTR <br>I need more.</br></br>  <br>Well they better get into gear before 185 is out. Most have already read 183 and 184 by now.</br>  <br>well, I don't think they'll do it so fast cause maybe they werent there, and they need more man for cleaning I think. Also, they use jap. raws which coming out every monday.</br>  So, apparently, the first volume of the manga has been officially released in English yesterday.<br><br>For those of you who want to support him, get on that shit.<br><br>Also,<br> horror manga </br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Amazon staff confirmed for tumblrites that frequent ANN.</br></br>  <br>Still to call it horror, what the fuck</br>  <br>Wow, it's amazing how you came up with that.</br>  <br> Gakuto is now Gackt <br><br>No buy. What in the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Tits are too spooky for murrica.</br>  <br><br> the amount of girls drawn in a way to please the male gaze is downright horrifying  <br> what is scary is that girls will get the wrong idea on how relationships are supposed to work <br> there is a well justified fear that unrealistically attractive female bodies will become the norm at the expense of other body-types <br><br>There, bam. I can do this shit in my sleep.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is that one shitty Kiyoshi/Hana doujin <br>Implying JUN has a shitty doujin</br></br>    <br>Kiyoshi is full of shit, news at 11.</br>  <br>The boys were clearly creeps and rapists</br>  <br>I do agree that Kate will try to blackmail Hana to get To Mari. It would be OOC &amp; Kishimoto/Usagi Drop tier writing to have Kate to have not obtained those pics as insurance.</br>  <br>Why are you so stupid?</br>  <br>The medusa metaphor was that it turns his dick into stone. <br>I don't think shed have a bush anyway, she wears tihut pants frequently, so thatd be uncomfortable.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Just why? Why "Gackt"?!<br>At least read a few chapters to see that Gakuto has no resemblence to Gackt you filthy lowly official translator, whoever you are.<br><br> We will live to see the day Gakuto be named Gackt in the majority mindset. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Let anon project his fetish, there is no harm in that.</br></br>  <br><br>It's Eoten/Zolo all over again. Some translators feel the need to be special and set out to "correct" the widely accepted meaning/spelling.</br></br>  <br>Wiki says "Gakuto".<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priso<wbr>n_School<br><br>Wikia says Ga-ku-to.<br>http://prison-school.wikia.com/wiki<wbr>/Takehito_Morokuzu<br><br> ガク"ト" <br>Some dumbass translator that is, translating "to" as "tsu/tu" which allows for the cutting off of the "u" at the end, forming Gackt.<br><br>Why do these official translators hire people with shittier comprehension of nip than your average fan translator?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Yeah, just let them all project their fetish...no harm. We'll just have to deal with that one, the one who wants the girls raped, the one who wants drink pee, the who wants to get beat, &amp; a few others... Yet, fuck this shipperfags who are, ironically, on topic.</br>   PURIPURIZUN, AI NO PURIZUN   This is probably a common question, but only I read the manga recently up to the current chapter.<br>Is every one just waiting for the BDs or is it worth watching now?</br>  <br>Watch it now, and if nipples matter that much to you, wait until Wizard releases a compilation of all the nudity.</br>  <br>The fucker has been working just fine with the previous audience he has if you give him more money you turn them into lazy pieces of shit</br>  <br>You can pretty much tell what's being censored, so if you don't mind not seeing nipples, I'd recommend watching now</br>  <br> It's the work of the committee. They are yuri and/or lewd. </br>  <br> delusional shipper <br><br><br>She wears pants underneath her skirt for a reason, you know? She's clearly uncomfortable with her lower region and overgrown pubic hair, which regrows quickly. She has a stinky wild jungle of a pussy and that's why Kiyoshi called it a medusa.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mostly looking forward to voiced scenes enhancing the comedy, sorta like how I prefer Gintama anime because of seiyuus.<br>Nipples aren't that big a deal, I prefer other girls to the VP anyway.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm entitled to get shit for free, and anyone wishing to support the creator is literally Hitler <br><br>Someone get this hothead out of here!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Heres your reply shitposter</br>  <br> im a cocksucker that doesnt ever think about of the consequences <br><br>but ok you fucking moron, go "support" your favorite "artists" and watch as they stop updating their shit because you have enabled a lavish NEET lifestyle for them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The nipples are not the problem, the frame-ruining beams of light are.</br></br>  <br>The seiyuus are on point, with Hana and Kiyoshi standing out the most. Sayaka Ohara seems to be doing a fine Mari, but I'm still not used to it</br>  <br>What about the fact that you don't understand metaphors have anything to do with being a shipper?!</br>  <br> muh shitposting <br>If you have nothing to add to the discussion, then fuck off.</br></br>  <br> What is shitposting <br><br>Report and move on.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You do know you have to be 18+ to be posting here? You can enjoy saying naughty words with your little buddies after class.</br></br>  Fuck this shit is so good I started yesterday and marathoned it i'm on 179 right now. Hana is the best girl  <br>You're the one who doesn't understand metaphors. You are either retarded or just trolling.</br>  <br>cool retort fucko, you can stop replying now. I will.</br>  <br>There is a guy that frequently lurks these threads so mad at hana breaking his self insert delusion it is as if she pissed on this guy himself.</br>  <br>If Hana is good that's a lot of incentive to dive right in.</br>  <br>It's probably THK, he always shits up on those type of girls and almost always aims for girls like Chiyo.<br>The irony here is that he calls shipperfags 'that vermin term cancer' in these threads while shitting up the thread with his own shipfaggotry.</br></br>  <br><br>Calm down friend, your bottom will develop an inflammation if go on like this.</br></br>  <br> Medusa metaphor clearly indicating turning dick to stone as even the MC specifies this himself with "hardest ive ever been" <br> Retard thinks its about hair <br> Starts calling people hanafags for getting the metaphor wrong because hes a retard shitposter </br></br></br>  <br>Yea hes a pretty pathetic piece of shit and is always ontop of threads with similiar characters, his room must make people drop dead with the smell alone.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi got hard, because Hana has a wild jungle there. How hard is that to understand?</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself THK.</br>  <br>She wears pants under them because she's athletic and modest. And both her panties and pants are fairly tight, so if she doesn't keep it down, it'll get uncomfortable. <br>She may not be bald, but she has to keep them short, most athlete s do.</br></br>  Chiyo is horrible plot device doll.  <br>But would a puffy Hana not be fine? Imagine being sat on with that.<br><br>By the way, I agree that the Medusa was her ability to turn Kiyoshi's dick to stone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only one to realistically have a full bush is the yaoi fangirl.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Keep your forced meme to shitty LN threads, tsunderefags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There is nothing to agree or disagree about, Kiyoshi literally said it in the manga. She COULD BE sporting a bush independently of the metaphor, but circumstantial evidence points against it.</br></br>  <br> THK <br>wat?<br><br><br>Nigga, please. If that was the case she would wear spats or longer skirt. Hana has an ultra hairy manko, like it or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hardcore shitposting</br>  <br>I really hope that it turns out that she planned everything from the start, down to encouraging her father to make the school co-ed.</br>  <br> I got caught in my shitposts <br><br>Theres was an oreimo thread up for you.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Hana has an ultra hairy manko, like it or not. <br> Hana sits on you while wearing her pants and you feel her puffiness. <br>I dont see the problem with this.<br><br>Then again, if she were shaved it might feel better, and less kimochi-warui to some.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Theres was <br>THK believers, everyone.</br></br>  <br>There was absolutely zero fucking reason she needed to send chairman and mari those pictures. The bitch is a spy.</br>  <br> Hana has an ultra hairy manko <br>Public hair don't grows from behind, cherry boy</br></br>  <br>I don't see the problem either. I don't mind Hana having a junglek in there as it only score her points with Kiyoshi.</br>  <br>Good thing we're talking about pubic hair then.</br>  <br>They are family members.</br>  <br>Thats even worse when theres an illicit relationship rule. Sending it to two people that are there to enforce that rule is the dumbest shit you can even do.</br>  <br> not bragging about getting a boyfriend to your family </br>  <br><br>USC rules are not the school rules. The boys were punished for attempting peeping, not because they went against UCS policy concerning boys.</br></br>  <br><br>Also, Kiyoshi was punished because he escaped confinement, not because he went on a date, same with Shingo not returning on time.</br></br>  <br>That's not the point. Who knows how thick her bush is, point is that you are projecting. It's not relevant.</br>  <br> overcensorship for BD purpose. <br> shit quality adaptation popular manga from shit studio for free money <br> ching chong animation <br> zero direction <br> airbrushed shadows <br>I hope for shit BD sales. Scum deserved it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't they just call "Gakuto" Gary and "Kyoshi" Kevin?</br>  <br>They are part of the rules otherwise is there an entire council devoted to enforcing the rule?</br>  <br><br>There is no rule against dating. There is a political agenda that UCS is trying to enforce, and you can be punished for going against it by being ostracized and such, but legally there is nothing they can do about it. <br><br>What part of UNDERGROUND Student Council don't you understand? They are not an official governing body, but more like a school club, admittedly one with a lot of pull.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because that would have at least been somewhat funny, but we can't have any of that. What matters is that the translator has his way.</br></br>  watching this show with my mom was a mistake  <br>Well you were a mistake so it evens out.</br>  <br>nope I was planned, I know because she had a miscarriage after I was born and then my sister.<br>Also she and my dad were together for 10 years before they got married and had me.<br><br>That's okay though, I know you didn't mean it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering Mari is apart of it &amp; got the better room it's safe to say that the USC hold the real power. It's part of the reason why Kate wants them out.</br>  <br>Why is Kiyoshi begging so hard to be abused in that cover?</br>  Localized names:<br>Kiyoshi - Keane<br>Gakuto - Garrison<br>Joe - the same<br>Shingo - Sherwin<br>Andre - the same<br><br>Mari - Mary<br>Meiko - Melinda<br>Hana - Hannah<br>Chiyo - Cheyenne<br><br>Kate - the same<br>Risa - Lisa<br>Mitsuko - Michaela</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aw, how sweet.</br>  <br>the USC holds quite a large share of power in the school, mostly because Mari is the daughter of the chairman and he let's her push him around</br>  <br> What are social networks <br>Nobody knows anybody's birthday nowadays</br></br>  <br>yeah, now you have to tell me about your parents and how you were conceived.<br>It's the rules.</br></br>  <br>Kate is pure. Now do you Underground Student Council sympathizers see?<br><br>Base woman is best Kangoku Gakuen.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>For sure, but they can't do things like make a rule stating that "girls can't talk to boys", and then proceed to legally enforce them. <br><br>They work from the shadows, influencing everything that goes on in the school, but they can't outright make up laws, or break them indiscriminately. <br><br>If they could just do whatever, they wouldn't give a shit if boys had evidence of entrapment, nor could they be sent to prison themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keito's rule is a mistake.</br>  <br> tfw watching this show with my 15 year old cousin <br> tfw she said she liked it </br></br>  <br>But but...  I like Kate. <br><br>Who and where did the rumors that the USC prez was a slut originate from?<br><br>I can only remember the earliest 10 or 20 chapters where students were gossiping on how the USC were keeping the boys all to themselves via the prison complex, and that no other girl was actually offended with the boys "accidentally" peeping on them in the showers/baths.<br><br>What do you anons think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Who has a better body? Him or Kiyoshi?</br>  <br>Kiyoshi.<br>Gakuto's hips are too wide.</br></br>  <br>We need a (male) wet-t-shirt contest to determine that.</br>  <br>Andre.</br>  <br> Who and where did the rumors that the USC prez was a slut originate from? <br>Kate.<br>She's a base woman through and through.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you asked her what scenes she liked?</br>  <br>We've already seen them in their underwear, that's way more than what we would see in a wet tshirt contest</br>  Which girl will you ouroboros with /a/?  <br>Yeah, but wet-t-shirt is sexier.</br>  <br>If I was a girl in an ecchi show I'd be kinda mad. Can't walk two steps without some fag trying to trip and grope you or look up your skirt. I can sympathize with tsunderes now.</br>  <br> Not <br> Kiyoshi - Kevin <br> Gakuto - Gary <br> Shingo - Steve <br> Chiyo - Chelsey </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok I'm not disagreeing with your post but you gotta admit that Kiyoshi has been pulled through worse shit than that and he's not a girl</br>  <br>No! I refuse to accept that. Well, actually I can understand but I still like Kate the best, because she did nothing wrong.<br>Kate a best Kangoku Gakuen. A BEST!!<br><br>The USC tarnished their own image and the ASC took advantage of their downfall, like any rational group would.<br><br>Also, Kate wouldn't talk or associate herself with bullies, particularly if they are her upperclassmen too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what to do now.</br>  <br>I hate Kate, but I love Kate.</br>  <br> because she did nothing wrong. <br> Kate wouldn't talk or associate herself with bullies <br>Are you delusional? That's her entire M.O.<br> bullied the Meiko <br> bullied the Meiko AGAIN until she lost her resolve <br> intentionally tries to destroy friendships   Mari is also a shit for doing this <br> only member of the regular Student Council who doesn't see the boys as anything other than stupid pawns <br> fights dirty <br> broke into someone's cell phone <br>Kate did everything wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up, Nui.</br>  <br>all of the boys have been treated worst than the girls</br>  <br>And they're still treated like shit. They have to do their races in a fucking parking lot.</br>  <br>Andre asked for it.</br>  <br>But all of those were less severe versions of what the USC did to the boys.<br>With the exception of the fire.<br><br>Mitsuko and Risa are also way more tolerant of boys than how Meiko and Hana treated them. Hana was way too easy to get violent (I mean in an actual offense taken state) on the boys, and Meiko was just strict because of loyalty to Mari.<br><br>Risa had a sword, but she never used it to severely beat the boys or girls like Meiko would with her whip.<br>Mitsuko only uses words.<br>Most of the pressure from the ASC members, comes from enforcement of the rules, not personal motives, like needing to watch someone pee.<br><br>Kate's reign is the best, and the most fun. Flexible, and lenient if need be, but strict when necessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>previews say that'll be this friday</br>  <br> Flexible <br><br>That's another word for corrupt.</br></br></br>  <br> Second volume releases November 17th <br> 4 months between every volume release <br> currently 17 tankoubons released <br>Jesus christ, hopefully it really won't take 5 fucking years to catch up to the Japanese release.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not as corrupt as Mari. Remember the gate and Shingo?<br><br> HE WAS IN SCHOOL GROUNDS ALREADY. <br>But to the USC prez, who was smug throughout, he broke the rules. They never bothered to open the gate for him to give him a chance, but rather counted down on his demise.<br><br>Kate would have allowed him in, but she'll cause something else to bear down on the boys as punishment, to cause confusion, rather than just destroy the boys willpower right there and then, like Mari would.<br><br>Kate is pure, and less corrupt. When she got Chiyo to be sent to prison, she also freed Meiko from her imperilment. Chiyo's imprisonment was also in accordance to the school rules, and Kate did not scheme against Chiyo for speaking to the chairman, but rather discussed the situation with regards to her position as Student Council president.<br>Not to mention, Kate freed Hana ASAP, as she did not see an opposition member as a threat, like Mari would otherwise. Kate is kind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, it'll be seriously disappointed if the school doesn't end under gakuto's rule. I'm hoping for him to go full keikaku at the end.</br>  <br>How is kate corrupt? I see this meme being posted a lot lately, it's obviously shitposting, but I want as entertainment an attempt to justify it. Not why kate is a bitch or a stalker, sure, she is, I accept that. But why is she "corrupt?"</br>  <br> implying I implied that Mari and the USC are any better <br> implying that not being as bad as the USC justifies anything <br>Kate is far and away the worst part of the ASC. I mean it's good and all for the plot, but just think of how much better things would be if they didn't have yet another vengeful, psychopathic bitch in charge. <br> Most of the pressure from the ASC members, comes from enforcement of the rules, not personal motives <br>Kate's entire motivation as a character is tearing down Mari. That's literally the only reason she does anything in the story. If the USC hadn't been run by her hated foe, she would've never complained to the Chairman and gotten them locked up and you know it. She broke Meiko to undo the good that Mari had done to her, she drew away Hana to leave Mari all alone, and then she showed Hana the Ouroboros picture so that she'd hate Mari even more.<br>The woman is fucking obsessed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> obviously shitposting, but I want as entertainment an attempt <br><br>I won't waste my time.</br></br></br>  <br>Kate is obviously lacking some screws in her head, but on the whole she caused less suffering than mari, ergo she's better.</br>  <br><br> But all of those were less severe versions of what the USC did to the boys. <br><br>That's like saying a serial rapist is not as a bad as a serial killer. <br><br>They're still both terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> For those of you who want to support him, get on that shit. <br>I don't think you know how that works<br>Hiramoto doesn't get a single additional cent whether you buy or not the volumes,the only money he already got were to pay the rights.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just one fag who's always blabbing about Kate and corruption.</br>  <br>What you fail to understand was that although the Aboveground and Official Student Council held power, when the Underground Student Council were also in power, the ASC were treated like shit and had no say in any USC activity. They were absolutely and completely powerless.<br><br>They didn't even have a proper venue/office, to perform their activities.<br><br>Did you conveniently forget that chapter when Andre and Gakuto helped the ASC move from their old office?<br>What I saw were actual equipment used in council activities.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mari's office was a lounge with a dessert table.<br><br>Even considering that Kate wants to destroy Mari, you fail to understand that for years now, Kate and the true student council have been treated like shit under Mari's bootheels.<br><br>If I were Kate or even Mitsuko or Risa, I'd want to keep the USC from rising to power again as much as possible. Even taking into account personal reasons, they actually finally were able to perform their duties to their school. Of course they'd do their best to keep Mari, Hana and the Four Eyed Pig who abuses power from taking the reigns again.<br><br>Kate and the ASC are better. Even the boys agreed. Only reason they decided to fight the ASC was because Kiyoshi and Gakuto were seduced by Mari's "Wet T-Shirt Contest" apparently being replaced under the ASC's version of the plan.<br><br>Think about it, Risa and Mitsuko were tolerant enough to work together with the boys, while this never happened when the USC were on top.<br><br>Stay delusional Mari fags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can prove me wrong, go ahead, anon-chan.</br>  <br>Aside from "she's great fapmaterial" I don't believe there's an actual marifag, he cunt is among the most despicable, hate-inducing characters I've seen in manga ever.</br>  <br> he cunt is among the most despicable, hate-inducing characters I've seen in manga ever. <br>Are you serious? She may be a bitch but if you really think that this must be your 5th manga. It's just a gag manga.</br></br>  <br>Its going to be great when the wet-tshirt contest isnt what the boys assume it will be. Then again thats dependent on whether either council even wins. Im all for the boys council madness.</br>  <br>But Hana is breaking the USC's own rules. Also, the USC were abusing them &amp; setting up.</br>  <br>I don't usually encounter bigoted characters who act on borrowed authority.<br>Obviously, there are dozens of characters who just randomly kill people for fun or whatever, but that annoys me less than what she does.<br>It's one thing to be horrible, being self-righteous about is what really grinds my gears.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Both student council presidents are awful people. The only reason why Mari is worse is that there's no way for Kate to rope Risa and Mitsuko into the core of her bullshit, which is her single-minded hatred for Mari. Still, writing an article that blames someone for a fire that you set up before it even happens is pretty fucking corrupt, as was locking the boys in their rooms on nothing but a vague suspicion of wrongdoing.<br><br>Oh fuck off. Mari is still the worst girl. But Kate was hardly a saint before she met Mari and was so fucking obsessed afterwards that she went out of her way to follow her to the school her father owns. Anyone that hateful should be kept away from power at all costs, unless the only other alternative is Mari.<br>At least Risa and Mitsuko are fine. But Kate is now, was in the beginning, and ever shall be a snake, world without end amen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> corrupt <br>manipulative, jesus<br>and it doesn't reach the limits of mari trying to break the boys' friendships</br></br></br>  <br><br>In fairness, there's not too much she could do to make Meiko break her friendship with Mari aside from mindbreaking her, Hana was a possibility and she tried it with her.</br></br>  <br>But your entire argument and angle stems from a flashback wherein we find out why Kate hates Mari and Meiko. And this happened when they were wee lasses.<br><br>Keep in mind that the USC did fall on their own, and not due to Kate.<br>Kate just took advantage of the cards given to her as she got in power finally, to finally push Mari to the place that Kate saw fit. Which may or may not have ended too good for Kate herself.<br><br>But still, she wasn't so mean, you know. Even taking to account her hatred of Mari, she invited Mari for lunch and talked to Mari. Keyword is talk. And she gave Mari an option to give up all her power, or else Kate would act against Mari.<br><br>My point is that although she had every reason to, Kate never intentionally "set out" to destroy Mari. Kate gave Mari an option, something that Mari herself never gave to the boys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look, I'm not trying to excuse kate or anything.<br>Kate is a cunt.<br>Which is not a surprise given she idolises the uber-cunt.<br>But for crying out loud, the word you're looking for is manipulative, not corrupt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They would not have become friends if the rules had not forced them together.</br>  Kate has something in store for mari and nobody knows what it could be. She said she cant wait to see maris look of despair on her face at the cavalry. Both of these bitches are straight out of a damn soap opera.  <br>That doesn't make her attempt to break their friendship any less despicable.<br>Plus teen boys need peers, they're the only boys in school, they'd have become friends eventually.</br></br>  <br>I hope she didn't mean andre.<br>I hope she meant double-social suicide with both ouroboroi revealed.</br></br>  <br>Giving up power to a known bully is not a real option.</br>  Threadly reminder that Kate is he best and that all you hananiggers need to kill yourselves  <br><br>Corrupt by the very definition involves dishonesty and fraudulent which also means it involves deception which was used to break Meiko. <br><br>Kate is also corrupt, not as bad as Mari, Mari should've stopped many times, especially when Joe stabbed Kiyoshi resulting is massive blood loss, but no she kept at it, someone with some sort of humanity in em would've though "Fuck, this has gone on too far, this guy just had a fucking stake shoved up his ass and is bleeding everywhere". Mari is indeed by worse than Kate, but they're still both corrupt with Kate helping start a fire which could've hurt someone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody knows what it could be <br><br>Or whether it will make a difference.<br>Kate's acceptance of MAD is a bigger problem for Mari.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Known bully. <br>Its not really fair to say that their experiences as little kids translates to their relationships in college.<br>I really think you are ignoring how in their high school life, Kate and her friends were the ones bullied out of power even when they held the proper positions via voting.<br><br>Karma was a bitch, but it has already happened before even the prison complex was made.<br><br>And this only strengthens my belief in that Kate is the best prison school.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My deepest apologies.<br>English is my third language I assumed corrupt meant what corrupted meant. Yeah, ok. I assume kate being dishonest is the blaming meiko part?</br></br>  <br>What Kate did to Meiko in prison confirmed that she is still a bully at heart.</br>  <br> Lesbian Whore <br> Not the worst girl <br>You should join your disgusting girlfriend in the garbage.</br></br></br>  <br> actors </br>  <br>I hope its not andre either that would be pretty shitty. Mari didnt look too despaired about it though. Kate probably has something in store that will mindfuck the hell out of mari.</br>  <br><br> dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery. <br><br>She basically deceived Meiko into making a snack for her friends to enjoy in an area which was laced with flammable liquids, this could've easily set some poor fucker on fire, Kate is in authority and oversees this thus she's using her position and control of the scene to cause harm in it inmates. <br><br>Yes Mari did it, but Kate did too. <br>Yes Mari is the devil, but Kate is still a demon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look, at least we should agree that all the females in Prison School, with the exception of Mitsuko, Anzu, and Chiyo, were massive bitches at each other one time or another.<br><br>It doesn't make any one of them the better person but at least there are three girls that were clearly not participating.</br></br></br>  <br> writing an article that blames someone for a fire that you set up before it even happens <br> locking the boys in their rooms on nothing but a vague suspicion of wrongdoing <br> blackmail <br>Those are clear abuses of power. Which is corruption.<br>And there's that episode with the snakes. Did the USC ever make the boys feel like their lives were in immediate danger?<br><br>Shit man I've been re-reading the manga and I'm going through the second arc right now. Anyone who uses the Stanford Prison Experiment as an inspiration is not trying to make amends. Fuck, man, at least there was a time when Mari wasn't a misogynistic cuntbag, Kate was evil then and is evil now.<br>Mari was shit. Kate is shit. We need a real leader who won't rule with their personal biases. Gakuto for President 2016.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chiyo was a bitch to kate and kate made her eat the floor.</br>  <br>Yes, I don't really mind it.<br>What annoys me is Kate-whitewashing.</br></br>  <br> frog meeem <br> hanafag <br>Not surprising.</br></br></br>  <br>The snakes were actually  non-venomous. They weren't in danger at all. <br>What it did was cause great boner material.<br><br><br>So we have Anzu and Mitsuko.<br>Then again, Anzu  beat the shit out of Shingo , but Anzu never participated in the female to female shitstorm.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kate deserved it for putting best girl PBR in the trash</br>  At this point if you don't see mari and kate are the same type of bitch i don't know what to tell you. Never trust a smile from either one of these people. They will lie to anyone to get what they want.  <br>no, the usc beat them to a pulp which involved severe physical damage.<br>actual damage &gt; fear of damage</br></br>  <br><br>It really doesn't matter if they were or weren't. <br>It made them fear for the their lives , like the guy just said.</br></br></br>  <br> Never trust a smile from either one of these people </br>  <br><br>The guys actually liked the damage though, until Hana rolled in but that only lasted like a day due to Kiyoshi. <br><br>They had the fear of death, not damage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>However <br>I do not recall Risa just beating the living shit out of Kiyoshi just because.<br>Although she beat the Four Eyed Pig, who deserved it actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Risa beat the shit out of andre because all of his friends were calling her ugly.</br>  <br>the first part of meiko only wasn't the most intense, I'm talking about later on anyway. past the stage that mari was pissed at daddy looking porn.</br>  HOLY FUCK<br><br>HE ACTUALLY PEED ON HER<br><br>Has anime gone TOO far?<br><br> where can I see some piss porn, I think I'm into it now </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She beat him up with an iron pipe for just laughing.</br>  <br>andre doesn't count, he asked for it and was happy about it</br>  <br>Hanafags aren't cancer they said.</br>  <br><br>Meiko beat them as they liked it, one of them went insane because she stopped beating them and Kiyoshi's friends got mad at Kiyoshi because he stopped her. All of them actually liked it abit more and only began to hate it until she covered up. <br><br> <br><br>They didn't fully hate it until she began covering up, she hit them harder, but never were they in fear that they were going to die, until Hana rolled in atleast.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep. Risa was helping him recover from being a complete wreck of a person.<br><br>Andrenomics had failed. I mean Risa even bothered to spend all of her allowance in her Piggybank just to try and help Andre. Of course it didn't work but it shows that the ASC weren't as bad as the USC.</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot she beat the shit out of kiyoshi because she thought he was laughing at her for being ugly.<br><br><br>He didnt ask for any of that. It wasnt even S&amp;M at this point. It was straight up risa taking out her frustration on andre.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and again, I'm not referring to the first chapters with meiko. but anyway, we're comparing hypothetical threats with actual damage, even if the threats were of something bigger, it doesn't compare.</br>  <br>Your shitposting is actual cancer</br>  <br>That's why I said "feel like", not "put". It's still torture, and is still very, very illegal. Just like how waterboarding makes you feel like your life is in immediate danger.<br><br>Beating is bad. I don't deny that. But making someone believe that they are going to die is a far greater level of shit that is not okay.<br><br><br>And venomous or not, animal bites aren't to be taken lightly either. There's still the risk of infection or parasites and shit. There is no way to excuse what Kate did. At all. I can't even say that she's better than Mari since she's clearly done ACTUAL FUCKING RESEARCH on the best ways to break a person. She horrifies me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're bullshitting andre clearly enjoyed and it was for his sake.</br>  <br><br> Being bitten by a snake and fearing you may die <br> Having a large titted slut scrub her vagina across your mouth to suffocate you  <br><br>I dunno about you but i'd pick the second one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>honestly, the only thing to take out of both of them, is that if the mangaka doesn't deliver some intense pacakages of kate and mari suffering and misery, he's wasting opportunities. And I'm really fearful this won't happen with how mari is handled now.</br>  <br>Why so vicious?</br>  <br> frog <br> upset because has a crush on a girl  <br> hanafag </br></br></br>  <br>FOR THE MILLIONT'H TIME I'M NOT REFERRING TO THE CASUAL MEIKO SPANKS WITH THE WHIP.<br><br>it's being beaten by a snake and fearing you'll die vs repeated kicks to the teeth, at least, if you want to compare. and that's not taking into account the stuff like leaving kiyoshi in prison when he suffers several rectal bleeding.</br></br></br>  <br>How do you know kate and mari wont decide to team up in the ultimate dyke combo and get rid of the boys for starting everything thats happened? This is a gag manga afterall.</br>  <br>Because they're that much of cunts. Like, honestly, mari especially pushes more than 85% of my buttons, it's as if she's designed to be hated.</br>  <br>That would a great twist.<br><br><br>As a Marifag, that amuses me.</br></br></br></br>  So we can at least agree this is AOTS  <br>It's Shimoneta.<br>Its been said multiple times in this thread</br></br>  <br>This, pretty much.<br><br>I hope you faggots don't report this again because this copypasta is actually pretty good even if it was intended as bait at the same time:<br><br> This show reeks of your typical "liberal" idiocy of "either you have to be an ultra-conservative prude who keeps children laughably sexually oblivious because you think sexuality is dirty, or you have your culture revel in all kinds of perversions and pornography which also do jack shit to challenge the status quo of seeing sexuality as something dirty." <br><br> The anime's title claims that it plays in a world where dirty jokes don't exist. Clearly they do exist, because people register them, except for ignorant children (just like in our current real-life culture, except the age of ignorance is raised). <br><br> A world where dirty jokes actually don't exist would be a world where people don't associate sexuality with perversion in first place. The whole concept of a dirty joke is based on the premise that sexuality is dirty, and hence a joke referencing sexuality is a dirty joke. This is the very same backwards, conservative mindset against sexuality, with the sole difference that now it's not banned but paradoxically celebrated despite still being exercised in perverted (dirty) ways. <br><br> Ask yourself why real-life women and especially young women and girls tend to be less inclined to partake in sexual discussions and dirty jokes. It's because in our current conception of dirty sexuality, the dirtiness serves as a way of demeaning the female side in sexuality. Either a formerly "pure" woman is dirtied, or an already dirty slut's dirtiness is enjoyed. In either case the female side's dignity is sold off for the male side's pleasure. <br><br> Which is why it's also bullshit that the girls in this show would naturally/instinctively find the pictures they're shown to be attractive. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128437931#p128440949">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its leaking to other boards, that's why, and with that let me tell you that Prison School  manga  is the best this season.</br>  <br> Prison School isn't an anime <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Maybe he means it's a slideshow or something.

I know that love is not based on merit but If Yukino wins, her win would have been achieved without having moved a finger:<br><br>1) Yui was pretty much sinking her own ship throughout vol. 11 because she didn’t want to be “unfair” to yukino. Furthermore, she was being considerate of Yukino and gave her chances to advance her relationship with 8man but she wasted them because of muh drama. To make matters worse, Yui will most likely get her heart crushed in vol. 12 in order to get 8man to understand that someone as wonderful as Yui can love him.<br><br>2) Iroha is teaching him how to be comfortable around girls and she is also teaching him how to be more open and conscious of a relationship (how 8man discovered that girls are sweet and spicy).<br><br>3) Sensei seems to want 8man to give yukino the genuine. Komachi, the cunt, (and haruno?) also seem to ship them and are actively trying to help them.<br><br>4) Haruno has been doing what she can to help Yukino get over her dependency issues. It is true that she can go about it in a nicer way, but who is to say that she hasn’t done so before and that only led to yukino taking advantage of that kindness and turning it into reliance.<br><br>5) Even though everyone is helping her, either indirectly or directly, she still has the audacity to ask 8man to help her some day.<br><br>6) When someone finally calls her out on her dependency issues, her only reply is:<br><br> Hurrr durrr, you are right, therefore I’m going to depend on you guys and make a request. <br><br>I know that by the end of the series she is going to get some character development which is going to prove that she is not dependent, but if she wins, her victory would have been attained by having everything handed to her. Everyone is doing their best to get Yukino and 8man together or to win the 8bowl for themselves; meanwhile, Yukino is too busy counting how many scratches the shoes of the people she talks to have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how it works, anon.</br>  I want to kill these fucking threads.  <br> Yui understands him the most. <br><br>No. Komachi, Sensei, and Yukino understand him better; you could even argue that Iroha, Haruno, and the cunt understand him better than Yui.</br></br></br>  It shivers down my spine, I feel it drawing closer. Can you sense it, too?  <br>Yukino understands him the same way he understands her, they're always wrong about what they think they know.</br>  <br><br>Soon her warmth will embrace us all.</br></br>  <br>I can give you Komachi and Sensei, but Yukino's relationship with 8man is practically defined by the fact that the two of them misunderstand one another. The last three might understand his way of thinking, but they don't understand jack about his feelings.</br>  <br>Komachi I agree, but Yukino? nah.<br>Iroha definetely understands him.<br> “I mean, if I invited you normally senpai, there’s no way you’d come, right?” <br> “…That’s true.” <br> You’re quite something. She understood me enough that she could probably receive a third grade Hikigaya certificate. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's probably going to tease her about it from now on.</br>  How long do you guys think this madness will continue on for?  <br>Until Volume 12 and beyond.</br>  <br>Everytime I see that image at first glance I see Sestuna from Gundam 00.</br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  <br>"I want something Gundam"</br>  <br>Yuigamamas</br>  いろはす～  <br><br>Has Yui ever tasted MAX COFFEE?<br>We already know Yukino has and comments about how incredibly sweet it is, which she then later comments about how 8man loves sweet things since he's always drinking it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are these for petting?</br></br>  <br>I mean yeah she probably has at some point in her life, just like how most people have tasted grape juice. It doesn't mean it's at all a common occurrence for them.<br><br>It just so happens 8man and Yukino both happen to like the same drink more than the average person. 8man is a bit of a fanatic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  いろはす〜  What if she's dishonest to herself until the end?<br>What if Hikki finds out about her feelings when it's already too late?</br>   Yui  <br>Typical LN heroine who likes the MC just 'cause and is only crushing on him for comedic effect and the occasional sad look. She isn't actually in love with him.</br>  <br>Then we get WA2 ending.</br>  <br>Why do you think she made her daughter wore a yukata just for "that" occasion?</br>  <br>It isn't a question of if, it is a question of to what extent. Does Gahamama know how much her daughter loves him or does she figure it is a cute crush? <br><br>How do you think she figured it? Yui going on and on about him or was it the change in tone and mood when she spoke about him?</br></br></br>  This fucking thread with no proper title is going to either die off or take two days to get to bump limit.  <br>Pardon him, he's a Yuifag</br>  <br>Doesn't this make you think OP's like a faggot or something?</br>  If 8man wanted to avoid having a romcom with Yukino then why did he make her fall for him?  ITT people that need to move on  <br>There is no love triangle. Only one girl genuinely loves him whom he's willing to reciprocate and also willing to struggle against his trauma because he loves her too.<br><br>Another one is just having a misunderstanding because she's been copying her BFF's attitude, got fucked around by her sister, and low inter/intrapersonal skill.</br></br></br>  <br>This must be the third of fourth Yuifag thread that has the OP fuck up.<br>I'm blaming penguins.</br></br>  <br>He's using her to get revenge on all the girls who turned him down in the past.</br>  <br>ITT hypocrites</br>  <br><br>ITT people that should just fuck already.</br></br>  <br>What if this actually happened. 8man wrecks both their hearts and rides off into the sunset?</br>  <br> her feelings <br><br>What? Like she is still having a lingering affection towards Hayato? And she misattributed it to 8man?</br></br></br>  So nanodesu is taking down their yahari translations. It also looks like YP is aware of the fan translations going on right now.<br>You guys might be fucked.</br>  <br><br>Please don't bully the Yui. She's a very sweet girl and Yukino's best friend. She's done nothing to warrant such abuse.<br><br>Remember back when we all celebrated Yui's birthday? Channel those memories.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>for some reason i read that last part as "And she masturbated to 8man?"</br></br>  <br> Remember back when we all celebrated Yui's birthday? Channel those memories. <br>You mean when she sang the ED alone and appeared in the ED alone?<br>Yeah, good memories.</br></br></br>  <br>How is it different than any other licensed LN? The Spice and Wolf anons did it for years.</br>  <br>At least there was no fighting.</br>  <br> "I want something bona fide" <br> "hikki" becomes "hikigaya" <br> "senpai" becomes "hikigaya" </br></br></br>  <br>Surely even Yuifags found this funny.</br>  <br>You mean the drama CD where all of her "normal friends" completely ditched her?</br>  <br>Don't worry, no one's fighting in this thread.<br>OP's a faggot and everything's alright.<br><br>Nevermind.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on. Even I was laughing at the Iroha bag scene. A bit of comedy at another character's expense, even your favorite, is fine in moderation.</br>    <br> "Did I just hit someone   again?" </br>  <br>Almost murdered a schoolmate and a dog.</br>  <br> never had to lift a finger </br>  I love Haruno  <br>You'll be happy to know there's a 70 fucking page doujin for her on pixiv.</br>  The fuck is that shit this cunt is using as a "tie"?  <br><br>She loves you too.</br></br>  <br><br>bolo tie<br><br>maybe he's a westaboo?</br></br></br></br>  I don't understand the Haruno hate, if anything she's actually quite analogous to 8man lol.<br><br>I'd be quite happy if her question "does genuine really exist" is solved by 8man.</br></br>  S2 was a mistake.  <br>Bolo Tie, rich faggots wears them all the time.</br>  <br>She is the best. Fuck ultimate form Yukino (which is just how she was towards the end of volume 6), Ultimate form Haruno will be the most genuine and the most breathtaking.</br>  <br> Ultimate form Haruno <br>She'll be a Christmas cake by then<br>Wait, that's even better.</br></br></br>  <br>  Implying Yukino will ever blossom into a true woman. <br>8man needs to go for the true Yukinoshita.</br></br>  <br>I hope genuine wrecks her panties too one of these days.</br>  <br><br><br>Agreed, Haruno is the real prize.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. In the end, it all plays into Haruno's hand.</br>  Are Harunofags the new senseifags?  <br>We aren't cakefags. Haruno's a young woman.</br>  <br><br>8man should have kissed her during that scene. I wonder how pissed she would get.</br></br>  <br>She openly flirts with him every time they meet up. I don't think she'd be in any position to be surprised at his reciprocation.</br>  いろはす～  <br>Isn't she's the face of her family?<br>If anything a scandal would rise</br></br>  <br>No joke, No trolling, I honestly think she wants to bang him herself.</br>  <br> Isn't she's the face of her family? <br>Who knows? 90% of her character and the Yukinoshita family in general is a mystery.<br> If anything a scandal would rise <br>She's a college student from an upper middle class family, not the prime minister's daughter. Nobody would care.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously. And that is what will happen. Just embrace it.</br>  <br>She's an attractive female character in a harem series. Of course she wants to fuck him.</br>  <br>A bit more than that. Papa Yukinoshita is a diet member.</br>    <br> this kills the Yuifags </br>  <br><br><br>Aren't we hurting the Yukinofags more? Haruno is literally a better version of her in a every way.</br></br></br>  <br> Haruno is literally a better version of her in a every way <br>Explain why 8man's a Yukinofag</br></br>  <br>I want to bully Yui and make her cry, <br> and then hug her, give her a kiss and tell her how much I love her </br></br>  <br>8man is a mix of Yukinofag, Irohafag, Saikafag and Komachifag.<br>Such a faggot.</br></br>  <br>What makes you think that? We know next to nothing about Haruno other than her personality which 8man thinks is a facade.</br>  <br>They are just a bunch of fags who don't know how to read in between the lines or Yukinofags who truly believe that being Yukino is suffering, even though this anon has proved how everything is handed to her.<br><br>Haruno is the true batman of this series. 8man “solves” problems by making people hate him (social suicide), however, he either doesn’t care about those people or he dislikes them. Haruno, on the other hand, plays the villain in order to fix her autistic sister, a family member whom she is extremely fond of. She plays the villain for her sister's sake albeit the fact that she wants to be close to her.<br><br>Haruno playing the villain is only a small example and a small glimpse of her sacrifices.<br><br>We don't even get to see what truly happens behind the scenes with their family problems. Yukino turns into the biggest autistic character whenever her mom shows up. However, not only does Haruno interact with their mother in a daily basis, but she also does everything without complaining and performs each of her mother's request seamlessly. She puts up with their mom in order to give her sister freedom and the potential to live a happy live. <br><br>Haruno sacrifices her own happiness to help her sister; meanwhile, Yukino is too busy thinking of her drama and why the world is so cruel to her. Haruno executes every single one of these deeds without resentment or hatred of her sister; as a matter of fact, she feels quite the opposite, she wants nothing but the best for her.<br><br>Being Haruno is suffering and the thing that makes her so great is that you never hear her complain or whine about her own issues. That's why I truly wish that 8man is able to show her that genuine bonds exists. Because I feel that all the bullshit that she had to go through for her sister's sake has made her the cynic that she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br>Yukinofags hate her because she's the character that is constantly calling out Yukino on her bullshit.</br>  <br>Yukino will hate her, because she can take it. Because she's not her hero. She's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A dark knightess.</br>  <br>10/10<br>New copypastenon material<br><br> I totally agree with what you said here </br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruno is a cute little girl to me though.</br>  <br>I want MTSP to do a vanilla doujin on her.</br>  <br>Yo, sup!</br>  <br>Try to be less obvious with your bait next time. <br><br>I will agree with <br> Such a faggot. <br>though. It's the only logical explanation for why he hasn't impregnated this and taken responsibility yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he excluded the girl that gets shit on all the time <br> it's bait! </br></br>  <br>He prefers Yukino because Haruno is too scary for him, he finds it disturbing when Yukino smiles like Haruno however.</br>  いろはす～  What if Yukinon is just mad because they don't let her have a cat?  <br> 8man can have that any time he wants <br> he doesn't do anything <br>Is he a queer?<br><br>I wonder, how would Yui feel if she knew 8man actually did like her.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 8man actually did like her <br>I would love to post a Costanza but I'm on mobile.</br></br>  <br>Why does Yui call Hikki kimoi when she likes him?</br>  <br>8man would miss most of his 3rd year of higschool too from being laid up waiting for a pelvis donor.</br>  <br> I wonder, how would Yui feel if she knew 8man actually did like her. <br>And here we go, delusion time.</br></br>  <br>8man likes her  as a friend. </br>  <br>I wonder how fast she would be on top of him if he were to confess to her. What do you think is her dream confession?</br>  <br>Something generic as fuck in a shoujo manga or j-drama that gets your average nip nigh school girl wet as fuck.</br>  <br>When 8man for the first time called her "Yui"?</br>  <br>Someday</br>  Loved Iroha's reaction when Yuki and Hachi were arguing about how they'd solve the StuCo fiaso  <br>Well he did called her "YuiYui" during her birthday's party if it counted.</br>  <br>Are Drama CDs even considered canon by WW?</br>  <br>He straight up called her yui on her birthday party. Yui was just left speechless and 8man decided to avoid eye contact.</br>  <br>Birthday Song for You is a bonus track just like the Christmas party, I'm sure they're canon.</br>  <br>It'll be too embarrassing for him. He'll probably bring back "Gahama" when talking to others and go with whatever the male equivalent is to women addressing their significant other as "anata"</br>  <br>Then he had "slip of tongue" and called her "Yui".</br>  <br>He called her 'bitch'.</br>  <br> Yui was just left speechless <br>Was it that kimoi?</br></br>  <br>You guys should at least learn your hiragana, it takes a few hours.<br> Gahamama: Hikki-kun!!

I would think him calling her "Yui" would dry her up.</br>  <br>You should know by now that "kimoi" is the Yuifag equivalent of "platonic"</br>  The only sexual attraction they feel for each other is about friendship and nothing more.  <br>That's why he should call her "bitch" or "slut" again, those were the times where she showed the most emotion. When he called her "Yui" she didn't say anything (implying that she didn't like it).</br>  <br>Is she ded?</br>  What if Volume 12 is only the climax of this arc?  <br> speechless = dislike. <br>Yukino pls</br></br>  <br>Yui - Dog<br>Yukino - Cat<br>Irohasu -  Doroboneko ?</br></br></br>  <br>Bolo tie = gift from Yukino<br>Pan-san = gift from Hayato</br></br>  <br>Yukino's family is the final arc unless there's some arc for "genuine" too.</br>  <br> When he called her "Yui" she didn't say anything <br>She probably needed a change of pants.</br></br>  <br>There has to be an arc for genuine.

Or does she even understand the implications of time travel?

It’s not that I didn’t want to take someone’s hand because I was uneasy. It’s not that I wanted someone to support me because I couldn’t walk on my own.  <br><br> To hold hands was something for an even more different occasion. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So if Yukino likes 8man and Yui likes 8man won't that put their friendship in danger? It is hard to be friends if you like the same guy, this will be a huge plot point going forward. There is no way there wont be hard feelings. I wonder how they'll handle it.  <br>I feel you and the monologue was the clincher but there was no way to integrate it without breaking the flow.</br>  <br>This isn't real life anon.<br><br>They'll just cry a bit then stay friends.</br></br></br>    <br><br> Yuigamama edition, couldn't find a sad image. <br><br> Hikki-kun chose Yukinon-chan <br> But that's only natural, isn't it? <br> Why would he choose my dumb Yui? <br> Maybe I shouldn't have put my hopes up <br> I had always thought that he understood my Yui <br> She seemed so happy when she talked about him and Yukinon-chan <br> But they were just like the others, always hurting my Yui <br> Why didn't he see that Yui loved him? <br> Why didn't she see that Yui loved him? <br> Or maybe they knew but they chose to hurt her <br> Yui hasn't left her room for days <br> I always hear the quiet sobbing from her room <br> Why didn't he reciprocated her feelings? <br> But, I am being selfish, aren't I? <br> Hikki-kun and Yukinon-chan looked so happy together <br> Maybe my Yui is destined to be alone after all...... <br> I'll never forgive you, Hikki-kun...... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>let it not be said yuibros don't enjoy poking fun at our favorite girl at her expense.</br>  <br>Yes how dare Hikki be honest with his feelings only to be alienated from one of his closest friends.

It was like an illusion or a scene from a painting. It was if she would still be sitting there, reading, even if the world had ended. <br> The moment I saw that scene, both my mind and body froze. <br> I was inadvertently fascinated by it. <br><br>Vol6.<br> Under the setting sun, she was quietly moving her pen. <br> This painting like scenery gave the illusion that even if the world had ended, she would, without a doubt, still be here in this room. <br> The moment I saw that, both my body and mind stopped. <br> ––Against my better judgment, I was fascinated. <br><br>At what point did Yukino go from something that would be there forever, to something transient?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn this actually kinda makes sense<br>I'm not sure about sensei's motives, though<br>Why does she steal Rumi in the first place? Why did she even time travel?</br></br></br>  <br>things only stay the same when your knowledge of them stay the same.</br>  <br>Where did you find this?<br><br>It says something about Komachi and Orimoto.<br>8man returning and talking with Komachi<br>8man wondering about his relationships<br><br>Finally, a call from Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only one girl genuinely loves him.</br>  <br>Where did you get this from?<br><br>Kind of a letdown to use Orimoto this way. I guess that ends her story and role.</br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps Sensei never stole Rumi at all. It's possible that while sensei was visiting the marriage timeline she spoke with and was on good terms with alternate 8man and Yukino.<br><br>They likely sent Rumi with sensei on a journey that would help them both grow as people. Sensei because she would find closure in helping an alternate version of herself find love and Rumi because it would teach her the importance of being honest with your feelings and how her parents fell in love.</br></br></br>  <br>They aren't penguin, they're humans</br>  <br>I heard Orimoto, someone TL.</br>  <br><br> guy here.<br>I didn't understand the orimoto part.<br>Care to explain?</br></br></br></br>  <br> From that, Yuigahama’s hands dropped weakly and her face was about to burst into tears. <br>It was certainly a rejection for her.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty good, although it would be rather awkward to watch your parents fall in love<br><br>Would it be incest if Ruri were to accidentally fuck 8man? I mean it's not her dad technically</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you guys know why Yukino and Yui got bothered by this sign?<br><br><br>It was because she thought 8man has given up on Yukino and the club you dense fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gahamama should take revenge by seducing 8man and ntr Yukino.</br>  <br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Please stop with this time travel crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We were talking about what it looked like, not the reasons why it looked that way.</br>  <br>Why are they so bothered by the penguins sign? They're fucking human, they can share unlike penguins<br>8man has enough inches for both of them</br></br>  <br>Genetically, the rules for incest should still apply. That is, never incest for more than one generation since their genes are too similar.</br>  <br>That would give it some Back to the Future vibes though, would it not?</br>    Yukino doesn't like 8man, it's just misplaced feelings  <br>Exactly. Their true feelings are entirely platonic.</br>  <br>That's not how it worked in LN. Yukino left after she saw how 8man and Yui interacting. Then Yui pushed 8man to go after Yukino.</br>  <br>Of course, they only want to be friends and nothing more.</br>    <br>The only reason why Yukino gets flustered in front of 8man is because she has known Hayama for a long time and she knows that he's very gay. The reason why Yukino was mad at Hayama during the Rumi incident was because he couldn't come out of the closet to help his ostracised crush, this is why she lambasted him with the phrase: "and you couldn't do it before." Now that Yukino discovered that Hayama isn't afraid to show his feelings towards 8man and realized that "things weren't the same back then," everytime she gets an intimate moment with the 8, she feels guilty for being too close to him hence why she gets flustered all the time.</br>   finally watched episode 13 a couple days ago <br> hype for Gahamama <br> Gahamama only had about 20 seconds of screen time <br> should have had 20 minutes <br>JUST</br></br></br></br>  Hikki &gt; Hikio &gt; Hachiman &gt; Hikigaya &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hikitani  <br> Senpai  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hikki &gt; Hikio &gt; Hachiman &gt; Hikigaya &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hikitanieverything</br>  <br>The fuck did you say about Tobe?</br>  <br>You forgot Senpai~</br>  <br>I see that Yukino knows who's boss. When will Yui and Iroha learn who 8man truly belongs to?</br>  <br>Hikitani was Hayato's nickname for him, Tobe thought that's his actual name because of the spelling.</br>    <br> Hayato, Slytherin <br> Hachiman, Gryffindor <br>Somehow this feels wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does she call him Hikio?</br>  Hey look, that 1 guy showed up.<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4986461</br></br>  <br>Only people who genuinely like 8man give him nicknames.</br>  <br>Well, Hayama is a cunt. and 8man is the good guy. So yeah<br><br>Ironic Justice</br></br></br>  <br> no Haya x Yuki <br> no Tobe x Iroha <br>Shit poll</br></br></br>  <br>So Totsuka and Yukino don't genuinely like him?</br>  <br>8man is not considered a name anymore, it's just a nickname; or as komachi implies, an insult.</br>  <br>Totsuka likes to call him by his first name just like Rumi.<br>Yukino calls him way too many things.</br></br>  <br> What exactly is the JUST meme? </br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>I think they try to use the term sarcastically. Calling it just even though it's injustice. Something like that anyways.</br>  <br>How many different HIki_____-kun has Yukino called him since volume 1?<br>Can you list them all?<br><br> For eg. Hikifroggaya-kun </br></br></br></br>  <br> Hikicasting-kun <br> Hikifrogaya <br> Hikifroggy <br> Hiki-gay-kun <br> Hikigerma <br> Hikikomori-kun <br><br>In contrast he calls Yukino<br> Ice Queen <br> Demon Superwoman <br> Yukipedia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Stuff<br><br> http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi </br></br>  <br>even after vol 12, the ride will still go on</br>  <br>Spoiler thread on 2ch</br>  <br><br> here.<br><br> I don't completely understand it myself. <br><br> But it's a Tumblrism. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you TL it? Google is shit for these things.</br>  <br><br> Gahamama not in the picture </br></br>  <br> <br>Oh, I thought it was a song lyric or some shit.

If for some reason 8man's romantic relationship doesnt develop with double YY or Iroha, Sensei's, Saki's, and Rumi's routes become unlock. Even if that doesnt work out for him, he still has Komachi.<br>8man is flooded with bitches and acts as if it's no big deal.</br>  <br><br>I have no problems with yui carrying the label of fan-service girl for this series.</br></br>  <br><br>You mean Orimoto and Miura.</br></br>  <br> that sex hair <br>Good god.</br></br>  <br> 8man <br><br>You mean, Hayama?</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly do you mean by 8man losing though?</br>  <br>No, Hayama is part of 8man's harem (pic related)<br><br>Not going out with any of the three main girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  <br> Not going out with any of the three main girls. <br>Wouldn't exactly call that losing, unless he chooses a girl but it becomes impossible for them to be together.<br>Although the only one I see this happening with is Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br>i wish iroha was a main girl...</br>  <br>Komachi and 8man talking about Orimoto, phone call from Yui</br>  <br>source? Could be fan fiction for all we know.</br>  <br>How bad do you think she wants to call him Hachiman?</br>  <br> Since the morning, Miura seemed like she had been trying to keep me out of her sight. Be it during class or break, she’d always look away from me with her cheeks in hand. And during break, Yuigahama and Ebina-san would go up to her and chat about various things. <br> Although I did feel a little guilty for watching her so closely, she was much calmer than she was yesterday, though I wasn’t exactly sure why. <br>Why is he always looking at her is the better question.<br><br><br>Spoiler thread in 2ch, it's most likely fake or from Volume N.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants to say it but decides not to for some reason so she uses his name as an insult like Komachi just so she could say it.</br>   yfw when the service club temporarily disbands because of all the drama <br> Yukino becomes more independent, Yui becomes more assertive, and we don't get much of Iroha because she doesn't have an excuse to hang around 8man <br> The club is empty (it got disbanded) <br> 8man remembers that he left one of his books in the club <br> He goes to get it and finds a familiar face <br> It's   Yumiko <br> She wants to make a request <br> Her request is to get into a genuine relationship with Hayato <br> Although reluctant at 1st, he accepts her request because it resonates with him but declares that he is going to be the only one able to help her <br> Yumiko and 8man start spending time together and they find their relationship refreshing due to the fact that there is no romance between them <br> As they get more comfortable with each other, they find that both of them have their positive traits and they learn to accept each other’s flaws <br> The closer she gets to know 8man, the more she realizes that Hayato is a cunt and is only using her to keep other girls away from him <br> Yumiko, feed up with Hayato’s BS, declares that her relationship with the cunt is the furthest thing from a genuine relationship <br> She thanks Hikio for his help and apologizes for ending her request so rapidly <br> 8man feels troubled at the sudden end of her request because he knows that they are not going to talk as much  <br>  8man says: “even if it’s not with Hayama, I-I can still fulfill your requ… Never mind, goodbye” <br> Yumiko couldn’t say a word due to the sudden change of 8man’s character and she sees him leave <br> Yumiko falls out of love with the cunt and is now just friends with him <br> However, something is still prickling in her heart <br> The service club reopens and it seems like everyone is doing better than before <br> The three girls await 8man’s arrival but someone else shows up <br> Yumiko formally asks the club to help her ask 8man out   to saize  because they are the people closest to him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you guys know why Yukino and Yui got bothered by this sign? <br>8man will only have one partner. There are two of them. Both of them like him. It is implying that the girls got faced with the cold reality that one will lose.<br><br>Why didn't Yui just tell Yukino she loved Hikki? Yukino wouldn't have fallen for him so it wouldn't hurt their friendship and gave her the best shot at Hikki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>not tellin Yukino about her liking 8man was in a way keeping Yui's promise to Haruno to not burden Yukino with the knowledge like other people did in the past, where they would eventually get jealous and leave her. <br><br>by the time infirmary scene happened it was too late for Yui to do anything.</br></br></br>  <br> Why didn't Yui just tell Yukino she loved Hikki? Yukino wouldn't have fallen for him so it wouldn't hurt their friendship and gave her the best shot at Hikki. <br>This would've only worked in the early volumes, after the sports festival Yukino began to grow conscious of 8man that was Yui's last chance to tell Yukino before her own feelings began to develop.<br><br>Remember Yui is good at reading the mood aside from that one misunderstanding at the animal expo/mall date, she's seen how 8man and Yukino are when they are alone and that scares her because it makes her think 8man might have feelings for Yukino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only bad girls in shoujo doing such thing to their friends. She doesn't have rights for it. 80k is not her BF.</br>  <br> Only bad girls in shoujo doing such thing to their friends. <br>She never said she was a nice girl.</br></br>  <br><br>All Yui would be doing is saying "hands off" which isn't a bad thing to do. I am saying Yui should have done this in like July or August so Yukino would never even become attracted to him.<br><br><br>If he might have feelings for Yukino it would be in Yui's best interest to squash any chance he has with Yukino.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember, Big Sister is watching you!</br>  <br><br>I wonder if Yui deep down is supremely jealous and has dark thoughts about Yukino.</br></br>  <br>Heee... So what about claim to Haruno "I want so such thing!"?<br>And don't you remember how it ended in same case?</br></br>    <br> won't do </br>  <br>Not likely, look at how she acted in volume 11 and her diary from volume A. She's too busy dealing with her rapidly crumbling self-esteem to be jealous.</br>  <br>I thought Yui was refering to getting jealous of Yukino in general. I didn't understand the hesitation. Are you implying that when Yui hesitated she had thoughts of 8man running through her head?<br><br><br> her diary from volume A. <br>I thought her diary was set between vol 9 and 10.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why was Yui blushing from seeing 8man and Yukino so close?</br>  <br>http://peace.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>bookall/1435150076/l50</wbr></br>  <br>she will use that image to masturbate later that night</br>  <br>Her cheeks were just flushed from the heat permeating from the infirmary (8man even alluded to how "warm" the room was).</br>  <br> Iroha is a main girl now <br> Orimoto is the true dark horse <br>I saw this coming since day one.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think the time period would make a difference, since Yukino expressed her distaste for such a tactic very early on. Yui probably thought to leave those things out, or was never one to do so, when establishing her r/s with Yukino. And it was reinforced by the promise she made after her chance encounter with Haruno.</br>  <br>dunnoe moon but caught the date for 3/13. <br><br>showdown on 3/14 on who 8man will give his White Day gift to?<br><br>inb4 Komachi</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> who 8man will give his White Day gift to? <br>White Day gifts aren't important or special, they're just literally thank you gifts.</br></br>  <br>Nobody can blame Yui for this.<br><br>Forcing her to stay with Yukino &amp; 8man after getting her heart shattered is just too cruel.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't at all a fair holiday. Women have time to prepare and know exactly what will happen. Men on the other hand have no idea what's going to happen and have 1 day to find a gift 3 times as meaningful as the one they received.<br><br>I hope 8man just buys the service club 6 packs of MAX COFFEE™. That'll show 'em.</br></br></br>  <br>I can. She must forget about her feelings for Hikki - they can't be together for long, she is not smart enough. Sex friends at max.</br>  <br>Sex leads to baby, baby leads to together for a long time.<br><br>Also she isn't completely stupid she just doesn't get big words  or know what penguins are. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure at the very least Yui isn't stupid enough to try for a teen pregnancy.</br>  <br>It isn't as if Yui would leglock 8man, forget to take her pill, or forget what day is a safe day. <br><br><br>I hope 8man shows up with nothing not realizing he had to get something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no way 8man will show up with nothing. After all we know he'll get something for Komachi which will inevitably remind him of the others.</br>  <br>1 day? Aren't the two days a month apart? <br><br>the max coffee example is hilarious though. I can see it happening in the second year of 8man's r/s with any girl he ends up with, since they would be fine with his bs by then.</br></br></br>  <br>Only unprotected sex, dummy.</br>  <br>They gave him cookies made out of false pretenses and hope aka shit he doesn't want, he should return the favor three fold.<br>So he should secretly send each of them letters telling them how much he cares about them and loves them and to meet up in front of the station for a special date.<br>They ask what the other one is doing, when they arrive at the meeting spot, and try to get the other to leave before 8man arrives.<br>8man shows up and tells them it's a 3P date and "YOU GUYS ARE MY BEST FRIENDS."<br><br><br>8man gives Iroha earmuffs and gloves to match her cardigan and scarf.<br><br>8man gives komachi a monkey paw that will grant her three wishes.<br>She asks for a new toothbrush, milk, and for her onii-chan to ride his bike safely everyday when they go to school together.<br><br>8man gives Keika the E and Saki the D plain white panties <br><br>Haruno gets genuineHachi-kun time, a tea date at cafe that isn't about Yukino, for calling out the service club for not being genuine.<br><br>Since Shizuka told him she can't watch over him forever he'll tell her  I don't plan to live forever, so we can watchover each other until we die. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui did but he knows the "thank you" was fake, Yukino has yet to give him anything.</br>  <br> Yukino has yet to give him anything. <br>Hopefully she doesn't. No one wants to eat menstrual blood chocolate.<br><br><br>Yui wouldn't want to do him without it. Teen pregnancy probably runs in the family though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> aka shit he doesn't want <br>He wasn't expecting them but he sure as hell enjoyed them.</br></br>  <br> Yukino's magical shifting cookies </br>  <br> menstrual blood <br><br>Twilight fangirl feeding her BF her menstrual blood in hopes of turning him into a sparkler.<br><br>Yukino is autistic enough to self-insert into Twilight and do that to 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> teen pregnancy <br><br>It's in her blood. It will probably happen in "someday". When Yui lead him to do something fun, but then Hikky insist wanting genuine, then he proceeds to rape her.</br></br></br>  <br> showdown on 3/14 on who 8man will give his White Day gift to? <br><br>He has to give a gift to everyone who gave him choco in Valentine day. You seem dumb or just doesn't know jack shit about White Day in Japan.<br><br> That means Iroha will certainly get one. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure about Yui but at the very least we know it doesn't run in 8man's genes. His mother is more responsible than that.</br>  <br>White stuff for White Day!</br>  <br>she is adult asuna</br>  <br>No, it's him dropping Orimoto off around his house since she lives nearby. Komachi and Saki's brother run into them while they're talking, and she reacts since she knows Orimoto shot Hachiman down before. Hachiman speaks with Taishi somewhere else and he's asking for advice on how to become popular at high school. Then he goes back home, talks with Komachi who wants to know what's the deal with Orimoto, and then he gets a phone call from Yui.</br>  <br> rape her <br>Can't rape the willing</br></br>  <br>Rape of consent.</br>  <br>Consensual rape you say.<br><br>Is that anything like platonic sex?</br></br></br>  <br>Basically yes, but if you really want to get into semantics, platonic sex is at least theoretically possible.</br>  <br>My bad. <br>Yui: consensual rape.<br>Yukino: harassment reverse-rape.<br>Iroha: training-for-Hayama rape.<br>Saki: failed rape, too scary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> harassment reverse-rape <br>That sounds intense.</br></br>  <br>Verbal reverse-rape then.</br>  I am being pull apart, anon.<br>I was Yukino fan all the way till Vol.10. But Iroha is so good! Genuine girlfriend material, I say. Cute, sweet and spicy.</br>  <br>Yukino should keep teasing him until he has no choice but to hate fuck her</br>  <br>I know just how to solve that problem.<br><br><br>Imagine Iroha and Yukino were both drowning and you only had one life preserver to throw.<br><br>Who lives, who dies? Keep in mind if you don't give an answer they both die.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just try not to go full retard about it like most of the other Irohafags.</br>  <br>Yukino should solve her problem by herself.<br><br>Jump down to save Iroha because my oniichan instinct is kicking in.</br></br></br>  <br>It's too cruel, anon! Why they can't use same life preserver at once? Why not harem? Hachiman can be house husband while all girls working!</br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  <br>The divine angel of light has made his will known. One lives, one dies. If you do not pick immediately then he shall claim them both.<br><br>I'll make it easier. If you do not choose then you die as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Iroha only child in family? <br>Chances for Yukinon early death from Japanese cough?<br>The divine angel can't ask such thing, it's a demon in hide and should be purged. Or it's a challenge from God and no-one dies. But wait, I'm the atheist! All good on Earth.</br></br></br>  <br>Let them both die then go play beach ball with my YuiYui.</br>  <br>No, I sacrifice Yui. She is not nice girl and must be punished. I even add Yumiko as bonus!</br>  <br>You don't deserve Yui if you'd let her BFFnon die.</br>  So, is it true that Spyro won't be translating Vol.11, hence why other random anonymous translators are doing the job?  <br>He is just busy or want to present more chapters.</br>  <br>He's continuing. Just at slower pace since ep 12 &amp; 13 covered all the plot points already.<br><br>random T/L only covered chapter 9 anyway, which the anime did pretty well.</br></br></br>  Double YY and Iroha a shit.<br>Hachiman deserves a decent girl on his side. Someone like Saki.</br>  <br>fite me</br>  <br>Who like Saki? No, who is Saki?</br>  <br>I heard it's the Japanese version of Jane Smith.</br>  <br>Hey, you're not me.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127941<wbr>427/#127972934</wbr></br></br>  <br>I despaired when I found it, I thought they died 2 days ago.</br>  <br> lol <br>And nobody bats an eye. Fuck you guys.</br></br>  <br>I caught on. <br><br>Tee-hee~</br></br></br>  Why aren't the girls willing to share?  <br>Would you really want to be the sex toy of two people who clearly care about each other more than they do about you?</br>  <br>8man can handle being the odd one out if they love each other more than him.</br>  <br>No, you read the rewrite. The actual story is he's the girl's BF who meets her mom for the first time.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/495373/e64111<wbr>b86d/<br>This is the original.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>What is this supposed to be spoiling?

He was sad.</br>  <br>Try being less obvious next time,<br>false flagging Iroha proxyfag ;^)<br><br>I guess this explains why Iroha was always on top in the last few polls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So that's what we're going to post about now, huh.<br><br>:^)</br></br></br>  <br> vote for komachi <br> only one vote for Komachi <br> yui it at 70 <br>That shit is rigged.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Last time I checked, <br>Iroha and Yui were pretty close before the proxyfag showed up.</br></br>  Can Yukino do this? I don't think so  <br>Yukino can't do shit.</br>  <br>Can Yui do this? I don't think so.</br>  Miura end when?    <br>Please don't bully the 8man.</br>  <br>L-Lewd.</br>      <br><br><br>Why do I find these things disgusting?</br></br></br>  <br>probably because you are gay</br>  <br><br><br>whores doing whore things<br>iroha a pure</br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha <br> pure </br></br>  <br>What's wrong with me?<br>I can't even fap to Yui</br></br>  <br>That's because you've seen countless Yuis before, so it's not good enough to do it.</br>  <br><br><br>those SAMPLE signs.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino does not have any motherly features at all, how kimoi</br>    <br>I want to  hug_  her so fucking hard.</br>  <br>well this is going to cheer Spyro up.<br><br>Many, many times over.</br></br></br>  <br>I see that yukino never learned to share.<br>What a bitch.</br></br>    <br>This happens when there's attachment with the character. I could fap to most characters before watching their series, but it suddenly felt wrong later on. For example, OreImo is completely fine, but I can't even begin to think about fapping to the Yaharis.</br>  <br>Or maybe it's because a single image with no nudity can't do it anymore. There are alternatives you know.</br>  <br> If this keeps up, I... I WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD BACK! <br>Every fucking time.</br></br>  <br>Just because your waifu isn't important enough to merit big-ticket merchandise is no reason to let jealousy get the best of you anon.</br>  <br> not fapping exclusively to characters you have attachment too <br>Slut.</br></br>  <br>I don't see any problems with a 3P end. Both of the girls are friends so they can share, neither has expressed they want to be his only one, and neither of them have shown jealousy streaks or depressive streaks.</br>  <br>Didn't Yui stop coming to the club when she thought 8man and Yukino were dating?</br>  <br>Out of consideration and not jealousy. Also 8man said mean things to her beforehand.<br><br>Yui knows them better know, she wouldn't mind 3P. Even if Yukino is chosen Yui wouldn't be that hurt or flip out.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> no dakimakura for Yuimama <br>What a shame.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 8man could have all this <br> he doesn't do it <br>Fag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and neither of them have shown jealousy streaks or depressive streaks. <br>This seems to be a borderline meme since I see it so often and it's patently not true for either of them, but the irony of the statement kinda misses the point of "genuine"<br><br>In all honesty, I think they could make it work if 8man decided that's what he really wanted. It would take a lot of work and care to keep everything happy, but 8man clearly has no qualms about taking the hard road to happiness in his life. More importantly though, is that both girls care a lot about each other, and I think with time that could blossom into something on par with what they feel for 8man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>since we're posting them anyways</br>  <br>have what?</br>  <br>dakimakuras of two of the girls from his school.</br>  <br><br><br>What will her Hikigaya-kun do to her here?</br></br></br>  <br>Use your imagination.</br>  <br>I imagine both of them not doing jack shit</br>  <br>Are you kidding? The sexual tension between those two is so off the charts that they can barely even look each other in the eyes without their hearts racing.<br><br>When it happens, it's going to get primal.</br></br></br>  <br> Sexual tension <br><br>You mean autism?</br></br></br>  <br>Where is this from?<br>The volumes released with the BDs or what?</br></br>  <br>Mercy.<br><br>Any experienced buyfags know why these aren't showing up in any shops other than Animaru?</br></br></br>  How the hell did she get so good at spinning this bowl /a/? Seriously just look at this shit, it's fucking crazy.  <br> sexual tension <br>That scene is a complete mess, both are loners that had their faces put close to the other's very suddenly. <br>Yukino is an emotional tsunami aftermath and 8man doesn't know what he wants at all.</br></br></br>  <br>What? Watch it again. It's not portrayed that way at all. It's supposed to be a very heartwarming moment.<br><br>Another anon described it well.</br></br></br>  <br>Practice for skulls. She'll have Hikki and Yukinon.</br>  <br>Nigga it's not about just watching, it's about reading the fucking LN. There's a reson secondaries talked so much shit while S2 was airing.<br><br> but end up falling in love <br>8man is not in love with anybody yet and Yukino has no idea what she feels, quit spouting bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so aggravated by this? Throwing insults only makes you look like you're insecure about your beliefs.</br>  <br>She's similar to pre-character development 8man in that they're both massive cunts, sure</br>  <br> 8man is not in love with anybody yet and Yukino has no idea what she feels, quit spouting bullshit. <br>You can blame the interview for this, after the infirmary scene friendship and romance begin to intermingle for Yukino and 8man.</br></br>  Will 8man ever get that genuine feeling?  <br>Maybe once he sees the "real" her and not the doll.</br>  <br><br>Haruno:<br><br>  1. “Teehee, you’re playing coy. Big sis won’t forgive you if you make Yukino‐chan cry.” <br><br>  2. “Oh, that reminds me. Hikigaya‐kun. Wanna go out for tea with me if you’re free? I have to make sure you’re good enough to be Yukino‐chan’s boyfriend.” Haruno‐ san threw out her chest and winked lightly in my direction. <br><br>  3. “Yeah, you’re right. It has nothing to do with me,” she said, pulling back abruptly as if jumping away. “As long as you’ve put thought into it, it’s fine, Yukino‐chan. I was trying to help, but I was butting in. Sorry about that.” <br><br>  4. It might’ve been due to looking at Yukinoshita Haruno with a perceptive view that I felt that Haruno-san might in reality be fond of Yukinoshita. <br><br>  5. “That’s what everyone says at first.

I'm personally not using anki with a timer, because it's not rare for me to do other things while I do my reps and anyway I don't see the appeal of stressing myself over a timer, the goal is to get what I need to learn into my skulls.<br><br>Is it anki deciding I'm too dumb for a particular card and "deleting" it from my deck? How can I prevent this? It's true sometimes there are cards that are fairly hard for me to remember but that doesn't mean I want to give up. Usually I can recognize myself if I don't care about a card and I simply delete it myself, I don't want anki to do that behind my back.<br><br>tl;dr : how can I prevent anki from doing this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is it anki deciding I'm too dumb for a particular card and "deleting" it from my deck? <br>It's not deleting it, it's suspending it. You can unsuspend it manually by going into Browser and filtering by suspended cards. Then you can pick which cards to unsuspend or keep suspended.<br><br> tl;dr : how can I prevent anki from doing this? <br>You don't. Anki is your bro.</br></br></br></br></br>   the particle wa (は) is a subject-particle - similiar to the first or fourth case <br><br>These fuckers think I know my own language.</br></br>  <br>Go into the options and look around. You can switch the Leech action from "Suspend card" to "Tag only"<br><br>It doesn't "delete" your cards, it suspends them. You can find them easily in the deck browser. It doesn't "do it behind your back", it tells you straight up with a prominent message. It's not about being "dumb", it's about not wasting time in Anki.</br></br></br>  <br>Google it none of us really know grammar like that not even japs know their own grammar, grammar is bullshit.</br>  <br>Pretty stupid advice for someone who has started Core2k/6k and Tae Kim/Genki grammar.

Or do I mean that it requires more than four players?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, inclusive always.</br>  <br> Pretty stupid advice for someone who has started Core2k/6k and Tae Kim/Genki grammar. <br>Not really. If anything, before you get halfway through TK, reading is more important than Core. And after that then reading is still just as important as Core, and TK takes a backseat to those two as a trickle of information.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for the replies, got it.</br></br>  <br>I can (partially) vouch for this. I hadn't even gone through half of Tae Kim and knew something like 600 kanji plus 1 or 2 words for each of those kanji when I decided to try my hand at actual reading and I was greatly rewarded for it. My first reading experience was with LN's by the way. It was hard and demanding but I managed to read an LN front to back and by the end of it I felt like I had learned more Japanese from the LN than the totality of the Japanese I knew before I started it. I know that's not quantifiable, I just mean to say it was probably the biggest leap in learning Japanese I ever took. <br><br>Of course, the amount guesswork I had to do was huge, but my personal experience has taught me that there is no long term harm in making wrong guesses as you read. The benefits far outweigh the problems. The important thing is to press on and try to learn as much as you can from the text, as if it were a huge collection of example sentences in a learners book. Full of juicy information to be obtained.<br><br>Also, I said partially because I didn't try reading before I had acquired at least a minimal vocabulary. I can only confidently say it pad off for me and I knew at a good amount of really basic words, the kind that come up dozens of times each time you sit down to read something. Still, I personally believe that even without knowing many of those you can still work your way through, since you'll be forced to learn them early while reading anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What LN did you read?</br>  <br>変態王子と笑わない猫<br><br>Not hard, but not too easy on a beginner either. It uses a harder voabulary than something like oreimo in my opinion, but that can be my biased view at work because I read it when I was only just starting.</br></br></br>  What's the deal with adverbs followed by は? <br><br>私は、前ほど高い所が恐ろしくはない。 <br><br>Surely the second は isn't needed? What purpose does it serve here?</br></br></br></br>  <br>....が</br>  <br>The way I have always interpret it is as<br>それ、食べたくはない = I don't particularly feel like eating that.<br><br>I read it somewhere, for example, when asked to go out with a group of friends.<br>行きたくはない = I don't want to go (but feel free to tell me all about it once you come back)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>afaik it's equivalent to 恐ろしくない</br>  <br>It's the conjunctive form of the adjective.<br><br>I'm going to assume that it's using は before the ない because ない&lt;-ある and the copula is a bitch about abnormal nuanced uses of particles.</br></br></br>  Is this website <br>http://kitsunekko.net/<br>with incorrectly timed subtitles really the best and only resource for watching Japanese media with Japanese subtitles.

Untranslated stuff is barely tagged on MU, unfortunately.</br>  <br>Not sure, but I was thinking of maybe making a chart of only stuff that had a decent portion already translated.</br>  <br>I can't find that many really. And it's my favorite genre too.</br>  <br>I should do that Vinland Saga too, haven't read it in ages. Same with Otoyomegatari.</br>  I'd like to read a few but I have no idea what's good.  <br>Yeah, think I read through chapter three, then forgot about it. I rarely finish anything.<br><br><br>Vinland Saga's pretty good, though it isn't really what I expected from a viking manga.</br></br></br></br>  i'd read innocent if there were more chapters to read. meh.  <br>Well, you could choose one you feel like reading, then read it for a little while, and decide for yourself whether it's good or not.<br><br><br><br>How is it? It seems very mature.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like they've upgraded searching on MU, now you can search only for translated series and exclude gook/chink/novels. Shouldn't be that hard to make a chart now.</br>  <br>it's incredibly good.</br>  <br>It gets points for the historical characters but it would probably be better classified under Fantasy.</br>  <br>Vinland Saga, Otoyomegatari, A Chef of Nobunaga, Vagabond, Historie, Jin and Zipang come to mind. As for anime: Hyouge Mono and The Ambition of Oda Nobuna. Latter is hardly a serious historical series but it's fun.</br>  <br>It's been ages since I've seen most of the characters so I might be wrong, and Hirano is lazy fuck as usual, but aren't most of them fictional?</br>  <br>No, it's the other way around. The setting is fictional while the characters are historical.</br>  <br>I know that, just don't really remember whether all of the characters really existed or not. There's been much Nobunaga being a goofy retard that I forgot about everyone else.</br>  <br>Well all the residents of the fantasy world are obviously fictional. The Drifters are all real dudes pulled from Earth before the moment of their death.</br>  <br>hox i love you. i'd give you a kiss on the lips if you'd let me.</br>  <br>Wish someone would do it with tank scans and do a better job in general. Kinda funny is a sad way that history is repeating itself, just like with Hellsing a decade+ ago.</br>  Sure, hard to find translated one though.<br><br>How far behind are we anyway? Last spoiler I read make it seem like the story already went pretty far ahead.<br><br>I'd make a chart, though I don't know that many historical manga other than the popular one so I would need suggestions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most manga scanlations don't get tank scans if they're being translated on a monthly/weekly basis. It's a lot of work, after all.</br>  <br>Does Yona count as historical? The latest chapter was pretty intense.</br>  <br>It's in the middle of 8th volume and there's 13 out.</br>  <br> It's a lot of work, after all. <br>I don't know, doing a volume once in 4/6 months rather than doing it every week/month with shitty scans sounds easier. That's what I do.</br></br>   Read Sangokushi for 45 volumes <br>   Liu Bei dies <br> don't feel like reading it anymore <br>also I really don't want to get to the part where  Kong Ming  dies, that'll make me even more sad</br></br></br>  <br>If it's a separate guy/group doing it, then yes, it's easier. If it's the same guy doing it as the weekly/monthly scans like me with Historie currently, it's just more work on top of everything.<br><br>Usually, scanlation groups want to do something new as to attract more readers. Doing something that others have already read isn't very attractive for all but the most popular manga like One Piece or whatnot.</br></br></br>  <br>You really do have to read the Northern campaigns though. It's the most iconic campaign after the Red Cliffs in Rot3K.</br>  <br>but  Kong Ming  dies in the Northern Campaigns</br>  <br> One Piece <br>I don't think people that read it weekly actually care about quality, you know how Jump manga scanlations looks like in general. What I want to say, I wish people who scanlate cared about quality more.</br></br>  <br>When I watch the Chinese TV series (2010 version) I get sadistic pleasure out of their suffering.</br>  <br>All humans die, anon. What matters in a story is if they die well...  Which isn't really true for Rot3K since plenty of guys get shitty anticlimactic deaths </br>  <br> &gt;anticlimactic deaths <br>Isn't that how it should be though. They're normal humans after all.</br></br>  <br>nobody dies a nice death in Sangokushi. They either get betrayed, die of illness or get their head chopped off embarassingly.</br>  <br>There's enough of a readerbase that cares enough to want HQ tanks scans, which is entirely separate from the weekly scans, for which only speed matters.<br><br><br>Oh and also, the most trolliest death in the whole novel comes after his death, so that's definitely worth seeing. The 2010 series didn't cover that, so that's definitely a point down for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is, and it's fine for the most part as it goes along with the more "historical" feel, but there are a few guys like Taishi Ci, whom the novel purposely changed to give them a more flashy death.</br>  <br>I only read manga about cute girls doing cute things</br>  <br>Don't worry anon, every major historical event has a manga adaptation with all characters turned into cute girls.</br>  <br> historical event has a manga adaptation with all characters turned into cute girls <br>This makes me so fucking sad.</br></br>  <br>Translations already 4 volumes behind. I need more.</br>  <br> tfw there will never be more </br>  <br>But anon, Nobunaga is way better off as cute girl. So as everyone else.</br>  <br> That Chapel <br>Noice.</br></br>  <br>Well damn, guess I'll go buy the manga then. Thanks,<br><br>There's plenty of cute girls doing cute things in historical setting.</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of my greatest fantasies that I could go back in time and meet those great men of Japanese and Chinese history with a box full of that kind of stuff.</br>  <br>That opening theme, though.</br>  <br>Would be great to see their reactions, I wonder if any of them would actually like it.</br>  Do you know any manga that takes place around/after Napoleonic Era? It's one of my favorite Era's and I can't seem to find any about that time.  <br> I wonder if any of them would actually like it. <br>That would be really weird.</br></br>  <br>The only one I can think of that's translated is Gunka no Baltzar. It's more late 19th century than early 19th century though. It also takes place in a fictional setting, but heavily inspired by history.</br>  <br>Gunka no Baltzar, not really historical but set in Not!Europe, focusing on Not!German/Austrian<br><br>I'm sure atleast one of them would find it funny.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a great intro but the best piece of music in the series is this: https://<span>youtu.be/tN7gVHZws18?t=20m3<wbr>8s</wbr>  [ ] (also one of the scenes that had the biggest impact on me, despite that joy not being very long-lasting)</br>  <br><br> Gunka no Baltzar <br>Just skimmed through first chapter. Looks very interesting will definitely check it out. Thanks.</br></br></br>   Thread that has anything to do whatsoever with history <br> Hox is immediately summoned <br>It's almost as reliable as Yunocchi with waifu threads.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm probably going to buy it in my country, it passed too much time.</br></br>  <br>there's a physical edition of that out in your country? neat. also congrats to your nice quads.</br>  <br>It's almost entirely Prussia from what I've seen. The Austrian army was rather pathetic in the late 19th century. Some of the chapters outlining differences in tactics seem heavily inspired by the Austro-Prussian war or Franco-Prussian war.</br>  <br><br>Yes, i didn't buy it yet simply because i'm giving precedence to other hobbies, but it's time.</br></br>  <br> still sending your infantry in platoons <br>Ishiggydiggy</br></br>  <br>it helps that Hox is the one who translates all of these manga</br>  <br> Austrian army was rather pathetic in the late 19th century <br>Considering their situtation I think they did rather good.</br></br>  <br>Explain further. Do you mean just in terms of the difficulties stemming from multicultures?</br>  <br> Do you mean just in terms of the difficulties stemming from multicultures <br>Both in that aspect and the problems with their leadership and officer ranks. While the Empire was in danger of being split to pieces and staff couldn't catch up with other European armies in both tactics and equipment the individual soldier was still able to do what was expected of him. I think that's a success on it's own.</br></br>  <br>Ah, right. I keep calling Prussian German, my mistake. <br> The Austrian army was rather pathetic in the late 19th century. <br>So the Baselland army.<br><br>It's just training, also this nation's military is still very backward in both technology and leadership techniques.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Weisssen looks like Prussia.<br>If Erzreich is Austria, I think Basellland is Bavaria ?</br></br>  I remember that manga about Tuskish and the mc look like a girl, other look fabulous, forgot the name though  <br>Read this manga if you like suffering and only suffering. Every chapter. No, fuck that shit. Dropped it when it became too much.</br>  <br>Otoyomegatari?</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot that Bavaria existed an independent kingdom. That might be it, I don't remember much about Erzreich so I can't tell if it's really Austria or not.<br><br>Otoyomegatari? The one with fabulous art and the MC is a shota?</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it about battlefield, war and some economic shit</br></br>  <br>Pastanon?<br> Jpop editors are fucking idiots forcing such a well-drawn manga in that minuscle format. Also i've heard that vol 2 have some badly cut panels and vol3 terrible black printing. All for a quite high price. I would've already bought it if it wasn't for the publisher. </br></br>  Which trap is best trap?

She is the 'granddaughter' of Yure Shinatose, but it is unknown whether or not Izana had any parents as there were no mentions of them or even if Yure herself actually had any children or if Izana is a clone of Yure due to their similar appearance."</br></br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br> who's a cute trap <br> my bf <br>But that's wrong though.

Even Berg Katze made a better Rui trap.</br>  Have /a/nons ever crossdressed or fantasized about it?  <br>If I was a trap I'd do it all the time.

Same question for job, you in public relations or something where you're basically the face of the company? Because I mean hell, even in the deep south in 'Murrica you can get away with long hair.

If you have a harem your manly charm alone should be enough to keep them bitches loyal. If not, well, not like you can complain if they have a dude on the side. You got a bunch of girls on the side.

You are right that value of a crew member isn't just fighting ability.</br>  <br> smokers spot of top jobber <br><br>please anon, smoker and sanji have jobbed equally post timeskip and sanji jobbed more than smoker did pre time skip, sanji is clearly the top jobber</br></br></br>  <br>You know you've gone full retard when Luffy calls you naїve.</br>  <br><br>Sanji actually won some fights. I don't remember when that was though. 10 years ago probably.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what point you're trying to make, but you still haven't done it. You posted the panel of Sabo riding away on birds and green texted something about Doffy being the king of birds, a title he was referred to by once by Luffy. What is your point?</br>  <br><br>That's back when Luffy wasnt yet flanderized into being a complete moron.</br></br>  <br>Wadatsumi.<br>Also, he won big by making Viola defect.</br></br>  <br> having any expectation for Burgess to begin with <br>He's a loudmouth brute, and not a main character. The fact that you didn't automatically recognize he wouldn't be a problem for Sabo or (Luffy) is your fault.

A captain who abandons his crew just like that is a shit captain and a shit pirate.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant Bellamy joins Bart.

He stutters and puts on a shocked reaction to the question then clumsily asks "why am I surprised, no comment" and changes the subject. That was him playfully acknowledging the theory as correct.</br>  <br> point you are trying to make <br>I just posted an observation which connects the start of Dressrosa to the end, I could start theorizing that Doffy is Uranus based on this and the painter DF users painting of the sun being blotted out (most likely a lunar eclipse) but there's no evidence so its just an observation anon.</br></br>  <br> D: Odacchi! I noticed an amazing thing!!! It is that if you show the Straw Hat Devil Fruit users in numbers, it will be the numbers from 1~10!! <br><br> Luffy→Gomu Gomu (5.6.5.6.), Chopper→Hito Hito (1.10.1.10), Robin→Hana Hana (8.7.8.7.), Brook→Yomi Yomi (4.3.4.3.)  <br><br> (1.3.4.5.6.7.8.10), but there is no (2.9), so is the one who ate the Nikyu Nikyu (2.9.2.9.) no Mi, Bartholomew Kuma, gonna be a Straw Hat next? Please tell me!!! P.N. SHANKUS.LOVE <br><br> O: WHAAAAAT?! (shock) Gosh that surprised me! Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! NEXT!! <br><br> really obvious confirmation </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> O: WHAAAAAT?! (shock) Gosh that surprised me! Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! NEXT!! <br><br>http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/SBS_<wbr>Volume_59<br>Okay, he didn't stutter, but he wasn't exactly subtle about it.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Franky said they owed Kuma when they recovered the sunny, no doubt they will meet again.</br>  <br>It's missing zero, also the japanese craziness with multiple pronunciations also have a few other variations.</br>  <br>He also said that Kuma was a braindead robot WG slave.<br><br>Unless they find Kuma's brain in a jar somewhere or something I'm not seeing how he can be cured</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I meant for </br>  <br>I think the said<br> we have to repay him <br>Kuma saved them on Thriller Bark (imagine if Doffy came instead), saved them from Kizaru, and guarded their ship.<br>Vega seems too altruistic to kill Kuma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Franky said they owe him, but that next time they see Kuma, it wouldn't be him anymore so they need to treat him as an enemy.</br>  <br>I dunno I'm going off memory and could be wrong.</br>  <br>Why is this so ugly?</br>  <br> Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! <br>Why would Oda raise this question if the pattern was nonsense?</br></br>  <br>Using a ton of different quality scans and bad resizing.</br>  Very disappointed with the way Doffy was taken out. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Doffyfag, I just don't like the way Luffy didn't use King Kong Gun from the beginning. The flashback panels established that Luffy had already developed the technique during the time skip, and there's no evidence that it was particularly difficult to pull off or that it only worked in a special situation. <br><br>If you look at the final Croc fight and the Lucci fight, Luffy wins by pushing beyond his previous limits and developing new techniques. When he won there was a real sense of accomplishment, that Luffy had pulled off something that he wouldn't have been able to do before. In the Doffy fight he wins by using a pre-practised move designed for punching through powerful defences. He might as well have pulled out Bat-Anti-String Spray.</br></br>  <br>why did it take so much to beat doffy?</br>  <br> take so much <br> literally 5 big punches <br><br>This was the most underwhelming over hyped garbage fight in the entire series.<br><br>Oda isn't himself anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice.<br>I have the first one.</br></br>  <br>Because he is tough. Doffy stats and haki are pretty strong.</br>  would anyone really care if sanji died?  <br>Everybody would.<br><br>Who doesn't love Sanji?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Hey anon, I understand your concern about this fight and Oda having lost it.<br><br>Don't worry, this was to show us Luffys's based power and then enter Kaido.<br><br>The strongest creature, when that finisher move barely beat a gorilla.</br></br></br></br></br>  When did Sanji's character start slipping?<br>Around Ennies Lobby IMO, from Thriller Bark and onward he's replaced Usopp as full on comic relief.</br>  <br>Gear 4 is a mode that has a huge drawback that leave him vulnerable for 10 minutes without haki. Of course luffy isn't going to use it unless he have no other choice.</br>  <br>Sanji has historically been the third most popular OP character period and was only pushed down to fourth because of Law<br><br>This thread is really the only place ive seen that dislikes Sanji</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought of that as natural progression, Usopp had severe self-esteem issues that finally exploded in Water 7, and Sanji was his biggest backer throughout that whole saga, constantly reassuring Usopp of his worth. After he rejoined, the crew stopped making fun of Usopp and were a lot more supportive and complimenting towards him.<br>Sanji, having great confidence and self-worth, naturally became the new whipping boy, remember he gave that speech to Usopp about how each of them has their own roles to play, that there was something he could do that Usopp couldn't and vice versa. Sanji took on the butt monkey role that Usopp couldn't handle.</br></br>  <br>Thinking about it, Usopp in return kind of adopted Sanji's previous role of nagging Luffy. For most of the story before Water 7, Sanji would often be Nami's wingman in admonishing Luffy for his antics. Together the two of them would be the ones most often to hit Luffy when he did something stupid. Before Sanji, it was Zoro who teamed up with Nami. Sanji took over around Alabasta and lost this role in Water 7.<br>Usopp from Thriller Bark on, has taken that role. In fact after the time skip, he's become Nami's equal in terms of nagging Luffy, and he now hits Luffy all the time. Where before when Usopp hit Luffy, Luffy doesn't punch back anymore, instead treating him like he does Nami.</br></br>  <br>autism</br>  <br>That's just dumb jap kids liking characters for their strength rather than for their personality though.</br>  <br>I'd say it's more from the fact the fujoshi voted for him, he was for a long time one half of the most popular ship in the fandom.</br>  <br>how does that change anything though?</br>  Would a blushing Jinbe turn purple?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128422640 <br>nice try anon look at my trips</br>  <br> one half of the most popular ship in the fandom <br><br>Is this LawLu or KidLaw am I missing something? Law, to me, feels like Luffy. They ship him with almost everyone. Now I'm curious about what the top ships are. If this discussion isn't allowed, though, well, carry on then?</br></br></br>  <br> there's no evidence that it was particularly difficult to pull off or that it only worked in a special situation <br><br>Nonsense. There's plenty of evidence that King Kong required set up time and that it significantly drained Luffy far more than any other G4 attack. If Luffy could have avoided using it and defeated Doffy with simpler and faster G4 techniques, he certainly wasn't going to risk it. Up to that point Luffy had no idea what Doffy's upper limits were and what he could to counter G4, Luffy only knew that G2 and G3 were jokes to Doflamingo. If Luffy used it from the start and failed, he would have possibly knocked himself out and forfeited his life. It was completely reasonable to hold back King Kong Gun.<br><br>You may as well ask why didn't Zoro just Asura Kaku from the begigning. No other Zoro attack ever broke through Kaku's Tekkai or even caused bloodshed, they only pushed him back to the wall. The better answer is that this is a Shonen, Zoro using nigger haki and Asura from the start would make for some shitty fights.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro/Sanji obviously<br><br>it's been going strong since Sanji was introduced<br><br>Seriously, just go google Sanji and count the seconds before you find a picture of him tonguefucking Zoro</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know the exact hierarchy, just that ZoSan dominated unchallenged for over ten years, than LawLu came along. Other ships are below them, but I have no clue what order they fall in.</br>  <br>Nami with Luffy, Zoro, or Sanji, one of those three ships are the most popular hetero pairing. I think currently ZoNa is tops but it is positively dwarfed by the slash.</br>  <br> Ipponmatsu <br> suggesting that to be a Chink name <br><br>You gone full retard<br><br>Also you're replying to a retarded troll</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, ZoSan is strong. That remains obvious, but I meant the ship with with Law in it. Thank you for answering, though. So I it's LawLu, yes?<br><br>I was under the impression that KidLaw was stronger than LawLu but I can't really be sure. I thought ZoLu was also very popular. Like almost as popular as ZoSan. I thought LuNa was strong too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy and Hancock had a time in the sun, but that was long ago, and most of it was pornographic where the Nami pairings at least got Non-H fan stuff.<br>Nami and Robin are the most popular yuri ship, mostly cause of lack of competition though.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, Robin's role in the story is bigger than the rest and Brooke has yet to show any relevance to the story. It may not even happen until he's reunited with Laboon at this rate.</br>  Ok, where's that image with all luffy forms and as comparation a bunch of rubber materials?<br><br>i need for teaching purposes</br></br>  <br> Luffy and Hancock had a time in the sun <br><br>So it's possible that LawLu ship will die after Dressrosa? I'm asking, not mocking. please don't hit me.</br></br></br>  <br>the hetero ships arent as strong because straight boys dont ship and the gays ship gay pairings, plus girls usually ship gay pairings.<br><br>lawlu is above kid law because luffy and law got some mad bromace this arc, as opposed to sabaody being the only basis for law kid and kid luffy</br></br></br>  <br>ah Lawlu gets the most new art lately so i'd crown it as king right now. Zosan is likely right under it in rank<br><br>KidLaw was popular around the time of Sabaody but the hype has since cooled for it. It still gets fanart but not like LawLu.<br><br>Zolu is the most popular Luffy ship after Lawlu but that isnt saying much since Luffy has few ships to begin with. It got a moderate following but was never a huge deal<br><br>Law on his own is starting to overshadow Sanji is fandom bicycle though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I thought someone was referring to Sanji when they talked about dumb kids liking strong characters, in the case of Law's popularity, he is currently part of the most popular ship in One Piece fandom's history. He is also shipped with practically every male character.<br><br>Unrelated, but I've noticed a disturbing trend of Western fans to self insert into Nami and pair her with Law as a sort of wish fulfillment, like Americans, French, even the Russians, it's weird.</br></br></br>  <br>luffy and law arent gonna split up after dressrosa, theyre still going for kaido together, so no.</br>  why did oda abandom sanji?<br><br><br>I don't even see his name being mentioned.</br></br></br>  <br>not likely unless Law has been preparing to stick a knife in Luffy's back this whole time<br><br><br> a disturbing trend of Western fans to self insert into Nami <br><br>because Robin and Law have no chemistry and Nami is easy to pair people with. And Law hasnt interacted with any other girls since, what? Punk Hazard?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who's that guy holding the cigarette?</br>  <br>probably a future nakama</br>  <br><br>I have a question for you guys, as you seem to be informed gay posters. I can't see why Law is so popular in the fujo and gay fanart community that he gets paired with literally everyone, I understand luffy, doffy, cora, smoker(I guess), kid, but why does he get paired with other male characters that hes literally never interacted with</br></br>  <br> as opposed to sabaody being the only basis for law kid and kid luffy <br><br>im still alittle sad KidLu never took off. You'd think fans would be all OVER Kid's boner for Luffy</br></br></br>  <br> starting to overshadow <br>Law usurped Sanji like two years ago.<br>Take your picture for example, Law/Smoker have gotten dozens of doujinshi, and that's like Law's third most popular ship.<br>He's paired with Luffy, Kid, Smoker, Doflamingo, Vergo, etc. and that's not even counting the ladies, he's paired with Baby 5, Monet, Nami, Robin, etc.</br></br></br></br>   yfw sanji is going to be replaced   <br>komatsu is a better cook, but he cant fight for shit (just like sanji)</br>  Annoying asspull. Doffy should have won.  <br>he's hot<br><br>Literally Tall, Dark, Handsome and easy to mess with. He's also fashionable and moody, which is why people love Sanji so much</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks for responding. This whole shipping thing seems to have a science of its own.<br><br><br><br> He's paired with Luffy, Kid, Smoker, Doflamingo, Vergo, etc. and that's not even counting the ladies, he's paired with Baby 5, Monet, Nami, Robin, etc. <br><br>Well that's a lot. Why the hell is he so, um, "pairable"?<br><br><br>Are they still going to go after Kaidou? Or do they have no choice anymore because Kaidou's going to go after them? Based on the events on the last two chapters, it looks like a lot of people are after their alliance because of what they did to Doffy and his underground business.<br><br>I think it's up to Law to come up with a plan for this although it's impossible for him to actually plan something when we're talking about Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck Law and any arcs focused on him. <br><br>I want the old strawhats back.</br></br>  <br> Well that's a lot. Why the hell is he so, um, "pairable"? <br><br>Tsundere. Easiest character type to pair</br></br></br>  <br>But these people literally write over Nami and Law, as if they were Bella and Edward from Twilight.</br>  I stopped reading One Piece at the time skip. Is it worth reading past that? Is the series still good?  People who obsessively hate Law and Sabo are just as autistic and moronic as people obsessed with the said characters. <br>It's such a pathetic pot calling kettle.</br>  <br>gross<br><br>Nami is easy to 'vicariously live through' She's shown like no sexual desire so it's easy to put your own there. For Law.</br></br></br>  I really hope the next arc is better...<br><br>Dressrosa wasn't bad, but it could've been better.</br></br>  <br>Oda completely finished Law's whole purpose in life and his character story, he will have Moriah and Drake on his plate for Kaido, Law will need to be put on the back burner for the rest of the Kaido story at least if not the rest of the story entirely.</br>  <br> anime Spain <br> Running of the Bull  shit character intros <br><br>at least it's out of the way now so he doesnt have to write a 5 chapter arc for each new coliseum character</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy and Kaido are linked.We'll probably find out that Kaido is ready to rain hellfire down on Luffy and Law and is holding Law's crew hostage or something for fucking up his Smile supply</br>  <br>Doflamingo isn't dead, right? <br><br>Kaido will probably break him out of Impel Down.</br></br></br>  <br>to do what with him?<br><br>three Impel Down break-ins seems a bit much</br></br></br>  <br>I want the Sunny team to be hostage or separated or something. And then Law and his crew helps Luffy to reunite with them. Because I want Luffy to ride that damn submarine. Also the possibility of Zoro getting lost in that damn submarine. I'm shallow, I know.<br><br><br>It's more likely for Kaidou to just get Cesar so he won't have to use a middle man or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn that pic is disgusting.</br>  <br>4 words.<br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want Kaidou to recruit all the criminals in Impel down, just like buggy did.</br>  <br>well Luffy's already been in it. I dont think they'll want him back in it though considering the shape he left it in last time</br>  I really hope that when we see Sanji again he is dressed in Okama gear and just standing in a sea of fire and rubble smoking a cigarette.  <br>I know, you say so everytime</br>  <br>But Moriah and Drake have narrative heft and tons of flashback foreshadowing each, they require tons of focus, we see that Oda can't juggle so many pieces at once with the Sunny crew MIA for over a year, Law is the character with the least connections to Kaido and we just got finished with his life story and archenemy.</br>    <br>I should've been clearer. I want Luffy to travel in it. But, yeah, "the shape he left it in last time" might be a factor, I guess. It's an alliance, though. They have to let him on it if he has to, right? Please?</br>  <br> we see that Oda can't juggle so many pieces at once <br><br>that's all Dressrosa's been though</br></br></br>  <br>it's cute how you still blow up over tumblr nose. Even /v/ has moved on from it</br>  <br>I don't understand. Yeah, he was gonna lose, what's the big deal about it? Was there anyone who thought he would win? Certainly not with Dressrosa in Birdcage.<br><br>Biggest question is who will the new nakama be?</br></br></br>  <br>yeah it'd be cute<br><br>maybe they'll give him a jumpsuit to signify his honorary Heart Pirate status</br></br></br>  <br>Dressrosa had so many characters, Oda shunted half the main cast to fit them in, and most of the new characters got simple back stories told not shown. With the amount of build up both Moriah and Drake have gotten, each are likely to have Law-sized roles and flashbacks.<br>For their first Yonko, it would be really bad if the crew doesn't all do their part, it would be their greatest threat ever, Oda can't split the crew and sideline half of them again for such an important enemy. The crew needs to be in solidarity for this fight.</br></br>  <br> /v/ <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Different anon, anon</br>  <br> maybe they'll give him a jumpsuit <br><br>Luffy in a jumpsuit. Oh my god the cuteness.<br>Zoro in a jumpsuit. Robin in a jumpsuit. Why do I want this?<br><br>What does Law get for being an honorary Strawhat?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nah<br><br>/v/ has better One Piece threads than /a/ does<br><br><br>well not you in particular, /a/ I suppose</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing since Luffy's too cool to enforce a dress code. Seriously, how dorky is Law?</br>  <br>Well, I wasn't talking about a dress code. Vivi had that x-tattoo thing. I wanted Law to have something like that even for a moment. But considering the events, seems kinda unlikely to happen.<br><br>Why does Law's crew even wear jumpsuits? Medical teams wear jumpsuits?</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I would be ashamed to draw something this shitty, even stickmen are better then this crap. It can't even be called an artstyle, nothing would look on with that shit.</br>  <br>Law's crew is in Kaido's territory though. Oda wouldnt put them there if law had nothing to do in the area<br><br><br>Well they already tied Chopper to his head. Maybe Luffy will let him wear the Hat for awhile</br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe Luffy will let him wear the Hat for awhile <br>This is too much. But I want it. I want Luffy to wear his hat, too. Dammit. My heart.</br></br>  <br> nothing would look on <br><br> britbong tastes <br>I could just pinch your cheeks, anon! What time is it where you are? How weird is it that Trafalgar is named after a common area in London?</br></br></br></br>  Luffy asked Kinemon to join his crew on first sight.  <br>For what purpose?</br>  <br>Why is Rule 63 Apoo such a qt?</br>  <br>Kin'emon also had his fruit hidden, if I were to guess the reason Oda's hiding it, it's because it's the Fuku Fuku and would immediately out him as the next crew member.</br>  <br>he asked Kin'emon's ass to join</br>  <br> Doflamingo isn't dead, right? <br>I hope not, but with destroyed inner organs it's difficult to live...</br></br>  <br> apyapyapya~ <br><br>okay that's cute. Still prefer Apoo Original but can't hate the femme flavor</br></br></br>  <br>Just confirms him even more.<br>His only reason not to join is Zoro but it's abundantly clear Zoro was handed the sword by Ryuuma, Zoro's descendant.</br></br>  <br> but with destroyed inner organs <br><br>that shit translation will just never die</br></br></br>  <br>Killer is a cutie too</br>   Dellinger's going to become an onahole for Impel Down prisoners         Zoro in a suit is a damn good look.  Just wanted to blast away the Dillinger ona.  <br>Well, I don't care because you know, I'm not british, but that doesn't change my point.</br>  <br> I'm not british <br>you're from SOME brit dominated country though. India maybe?<br><br>you've perhaps been on this site too long</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy's a moron, but he knows being a pirate and he's made terms with death. Even now, that's fairly consistent.</br>  <br>plenty of people want that<br><br>kind of makes me wonder where Dellingerfag went</br></br></br>  <br>Dellinger's sweet 16 year old boipussi is going to get a rougher pounding in jail than Doflamingo received from gear 4</br>  <br> anyone going near Dellinger with teeth like that <br><br>I dont see it happening. Who's crazy enough to attempt to fuck a piranha?</br></br></br>  <br>Law's a friend, but he's not a Strawhat. Lots of the pirate crews wear themed outfits for no particular reason.</br>  <br>Yeah, sure, buddy, whatever pleases you.<br>Have this, fap and maybe you'll be soothed.</br></br>  <br>It's not like he has anus dentata  I would be </br>  <br>what a strange attempt at a backtrack<br><br>but you should probably at least note when you let 4chan dictate your likes and dislikes</br></br></br>  <br> anus dentata <br><br>had a dream about that once. It wasnt as weird as it should have been</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I'm pretty sune 4chan has nothing to do with me being able to know when I'm seeing shit.<br>You, however may have let tumblr dictate your tastes. But that's okay, everyone makes mistakes, just don't shove that shit in everyone's face.</br></br>  <br> implying Barto, Cavendish, Sai, Pink and Kyros are not based as fuck <br>stay pleb</br></br>  <br> im not shit YOURE shit <br><br>okay</br></br></br>  Based Zoro. Can't wait till he duels Kinemon.  <br>bullshit, Luffy always has been a goofball with some serious moments here and there</br>  <br>i dont mean them, I mean all the literally who characters that only show up in groups like Abdullah and Jeet, the Jacket brothers? Longarm dude and some others im surely forgetting</br>  <br>Oh, I'm sure you're having fun, but don't expect me to go on this discussion.<br>Still, have fun.</br></br>  <br>then what is your problem? they never were the focused and only were prominent in a few chapters</br>  <br> but don't expect me to go on <br><br>seriously, where are you from? I KNOW ive run into you before but you never tell me when I ask</br></br></br>  <br> then what is your problem? <br><br>what problem? There was never a problem on my end</br></br></br>  <br>The anime turns to shit right around/after Water 7. When they reach Enies Lobby, it all goes downhill from there. The most obvious thing is the shit quality animation from Brand New World, especially the first run of it before it was edited.</br>  <br>the straw hats need more allies</br>  <br>What happened in a proper translation?</br>  <br>most likely kinemon isnt in his league, considering his reaction to zoro vs pica and his questioning of wether they could stop the birdcage</br>  <br>Luffy has always been a complete moron.</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.   Catch up on last three chapters today <br> Chapter 793 <br>holy information that was amazing</br></br>  <br>Good job catching up.</br>  <br> Because I want Luffy to ride that damn submarine. <br>Me too, anon. Me too.</br></br>  <br>Why am I not surprised Kuzan can't cycle in a straight line for shit?</br>  <br>Please kindly edit Kagura out of this picture. Much obliged.</br>  <br>Ah IIRC it's the Kagura meme!</br>  <br>;^)</br>  <br>She's handsome.</br>  <br>Natsu Uchiha</br>  MFW no string string vs stitch stitch fruit battle<br> oh the irony </br>  Why isn't there any people discussing One Piece in this thread? Did everyone get bored of One Piece just because there isn't any chapter tomorrow?  <br>Nah, Chopper will cure Doc Q</br>  Who had the best battle this arc /a/?  <br><br><br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about you leave instead of insulting other people?</br>  <br>Bartolomeo v Gladius.<br><br>Though not the main show....<br><br>GOD FIST - BARI BARI NO PISTOL!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Franky v Senor Pink</br>  <br>Bartolomeo vs gladius was by far the best fight of the entire arc.</br>  Daily reminder that Zoro and Robin is a thing.  <br>kewl meme m8 :^)</br>  <br>Law + Luffy vs Doffy was clearly the best fight<br>other than that it was Gladius vs Barto</br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that Robin wants that red hot rocket</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>SS+Bestiality with Robin<br>why does this turn me on?</br></br>  <br>Do you mean this is stupid or do you mean this is something you agree with?</br>  <br>something i agree with</br>  <br>Gear 4th Luffy vs Doflamingo was the hypest shit in this arc</br>  It's kinda absurd how much damage it took to finally bring Doflamingo down, and how many differenc people fighting.<br>Luffy would have been wrecked if it was a 1v1.</br>  <br>Okay yay</br>  <br> Luffy would have been wrecked if it was a 1v1 <br>nope we don't know that, because we can't just guess how well a healthy doffy would do against gear 4 from the get go.</br></br>  <br>Yep, this one no doubt.</br>  Nice to see there are more and more people up in this thead.  <br>Zoro disapproves.</br>  <br>He's trying to avoid dolphins. Cut him some slack.</br>  <br><br>Or its this: Chopper is like Robin and Zoro's kid. He acts childish enough and always runs to Zoro when scared. Also remember the bath scene where he washed Chopper's hair?</br></br>  <br>Just imagine how hyped we will all be when One Piece is close to ending and all Luffy's allies show up like this to help him...</br>  <br>yes, because he wants it for himself</br>  <br>Are dolphins really that common?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>You're making me want to ship Zoro and Robin. I must not.</br>  <br>Why not? All thats needed is for Zoro to age 10 years while Robin stays the same age. Or Robin could be Modo-Modo'd by that girl in Z and then they would be the same age.</br>  <br>Oh I'm hyped alright</br>  <br>Which of Doffy's crew is gonna escape and have his own cover-story where s/he opens a tapas restaurant?</br>  <br> Baby 5 gets a cover story where she plans her wedding </br>  <br><br> Zoro is only 21 <br><br>I always thought he was older, damn.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Baby 5 doesn't even need to escape;<br><br><br> inb4 wedding cover-story and honeymoon </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Sai will bang this everyday from now on and will make her pregnant with lots of monkey children</br>  <br>Apparently. Or they're drawn to Kuzan for some reason. He always almost hits one.</br>  <br>Good for them. Finally Baby5 gets the love she deserves.</br>  <br>I am suddenly reminded that Law is older than Zoro. Is it just me or doesn't Law look like he's 26? And Kid is what? 23? I initially thought Kid and Law were of the same age.</br>  <br>shieeeeeeeet nigga i never realized she was drill haired.</br>  <br> mfw I'm older than Zoro  <br><br>Maybe because of the goofy hat? I think he looks his age though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, I was kinda surprised by Law's age too. Always thought he was like 22-25.</br>  <br> drill haired <br>Ringlets. That's the word you're looking for.</br></br>  <br>Berserk</br>  <br> wanting Doffy to fight a shitty dwarf <br>Nigga pls.</br></br>  Reminder that haki is planned.  <br>Makes it weird when Kid always seem to top in kidlaw.</br>  <br>I hate it so much when people just throw whoever happens to be the oldest on top. It's all about a character's preferences in bed, personality, assertiveness, and the dynamic between them and their partner. Age has nothing to do with it. <br><br>Law is a huge tsundere while Kid's a sadist with anger issues and a (seemingly) very dominant personality. It's kind of obvious why most fujos prefer Kid on top.</br></br></br>  <br>Vergo and Monet</br>  <br>I-I'm sorry, anon.</br>  <br>Normally I'd say they're dead, but then Bellamy hapened.<br>Are there any other characters that are "presumed" dead?</br></br>  <br><br>Never mind Bellamy, but then Pell happened.</br></br>  <br>Don't tell me you actually thought Bellamy died?</br>  <br>This and Ace's boat just seem so unsafe and impractical. One slip or unexpected wave and the rider is DEAD.</br>  <br><br>Well Aokiji can just freeze everything.</br></br>  <br>that was so stupid</br>  <br>It's okay, I forgive you.</br>  <br><br>Veritas, Sun Ken Rock, Toriko, Prison School or just rewatch the Takamura vs Bryan Hawk fight again for the 1000th time.</br></br>  <br>Bartolomeo vs Gladius and Luffy/Law vs Doffy up until the 10mins lull. The ending of that fight was good too but took too long to get there.<br><br>Personal favorite was LaoG/Baby5 vs Happo Navy, not because of the fight, but cause LaoG almost dying of old age was one of my favorite scenes in Dressrosa kek</br></br></br>  <br>Usually I'd use this image to say we dont need a reminder, but with how slow the Law posting has been after you put that, I think we do need a reminder</br>  OFFICIAL STRAWHAT RANKING<br>1.

He's still so mysterious. His past with Whitebeard, Ivankov and the WG all need to be expanded on, as does his devotion to not letting Luffy die at their hands. He's got some huge backstory, and I can't currently see an obvious way for Oda to reintroduce him<br> - Zoro will be allied in some way with Don Sai and King Elizabello <br>I like this idea, Zoro being the liaison between the fleet captains and Luffy. <br> - Law will unfortunately stick with the SH at least 'til the end of Wano's arc, so for a few more years <br>I like Law a lot, but any longer and its going to be weirder when he finally leaves and inevitably returns at the end. Around 5 years on the crew, how long could he be gone for his return to be good and not just a gap in his time with the crew</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>someone really need to translate OPparty 4. <br>I need to know how they're bullying Law this time.</br></br>   this faggot is literally naked   <br>Theres a 4th one? now I need it to, i'm loving especially with the page I showed in </br>  <br> Law is a huge tsundere <br>yes</br></br>  <br>my hero academia, black clover, fapping</br>  <br>I've read the translation for this somewhere. It's something like:<br> Luffy: [Law], is there a tattoo on your dick too? <br> Law: There is no such thing! <br> Chopper: Is there a tattoo on your dick that says "death dick"?  <br> Law: I told you there is no such thing!!! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe it, but I doubt it</br>  <br>i'll give you MHA, but Black Clover? Only good thing about BC is decent tsundere.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's real, at least dicks are being mentioned and the "there's no such thing" part is correct as well.</br>  <br>I'll trust you</br>  <br> The guy who makes the spinoff had to ask Oda whether Law had tattoos on his dick. </br>  Post your favurite color spreads.  <br>But Perona is pregnant of zoro</br>  <br>no</br>            <br><br> vs bb <br> no vs gorousei <br><br>get your shit together</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm very sorry</br>   Law screaming helplessly as Doffy is about to finish him <br><br>Anyone thought this was kinda out of his character? Now I don't mind tough-acting boys showing weakness but this is far away from his "I don't care if I die" kid's mentality. It shows that Law grew to appreciate life as growing up.</br></br>  <br> his mentor saves his life <br> his only goal is to kill his mentors murderer <br> he fails <br> doesn't appreciate life <br><br>the fuck did you smoke?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that was his mentality until his life was saved by Cora, now it has become "I dont care if I die, as long as Doflamingo also dies."</br>  <br> corazon saves him <br> literally expresses several times how grateful he is <br> It shows that Law grew to appreciate life as growing up. <br>You are whatever the opposite of a mach 20 reader is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a slut</br>  <br>this is true</br>  <br>It was just like my doujinshis.</br>  <br>Sometime I feel bad for LawxBaby5 shippers. When the hetro ship is one of the least popular Law's ships you know something not right. Hetro ships are so uncool these days I guess.</br>  <br> mu <br> 6 <br> to <br> 10 <br> 4 <br> Yo <br> 3 <br> mi <br>What?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes.<br><br>I'm fujo as hell but I think Law/Baby 5 is kinda cute. Same goes for Law/Monet. I hate to see him paired up with the female strawhats though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>mutsu, tou, yottsu, mittsu</br>  <br> I hate to see him paired up with the female strawhats though. <br><br>Whoever pairs him with any of the strawhats can fuck right off. Robin is taken by Zoro and Nami is a slut for everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, number in japanese can be read in various fashions, like the number 4 that can be read as shi or yon, so yeah, also, they can have even more various ways to be read when used in words like first, second, etc..</br>  <br>I agree with the first part, but Robin belongs with Franky and Zoro is with Perona.</br>  <br>The fuck is up with Nami in that picture?</br>  <br> toei </br>  reminds me of this for some reason  <br>Toei kindergarten animation as usual</br>  <br>meant for <br/></br>  <br><br>I thought they were still good in Enie's Lobby</br></br>  <br>  Nami is a slut for everyone. <br>who is female.<br>Nami a lesbian.</br></br></br>   yfw toei puts one piece on hiatus after the dressrosa arc and starts One Piece Kai instead of a filler arc to let the manga produce enough to adapt    ordering new phone <br> will finally be able to play dance battle  <br> mfw <br><br>Nah she's bi.</br></br></br></br>  So was there an Usopp vs Trebol fight supposed?<br><br>signs<br> Trebol's sniper skill was shown <br> Usopp asked Viola, that how many of the enemies are left. <br>I think he was supposed to go after Trebol after Violet would told him that Trebol is in the same room and captured Luffy with his sticky fluid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying the children and manchildren watching care about a kai <br>DBZ Kai worked because it had been off air for years and the now largely adult audience wanted it, and it was an excuse to re-air the show for new viewers. Since One Piece still airs a re-edited series won't pull in any new audiences</br></br>  <br>Did they capture Sugar or she turned herself into a toy?</br>  <br>Nah</br>  <br>Did Luffy use haki, when he was angered about how Arlong talked about Nami?<br>I mean, Arlong was surprised, he can not move the Kiribachi, and Luffy broke it with a single grip.</br></br>  I found something weird again.  Post stuff you will forever remember wrong due to growing up with a (bad) synchronisation.<br><br> the shichibukai are the Seven Samurai <br> Kuro is Captain Black <br> Kuroobi is Blackbelt </br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you are from Germany</br>  <br>What was Doffy's name? I can not remember.</br>  <br>I actually prefer Kuma as "Bartholomäus Bär", and Blackbelt is kinda a cool name aswell. But those others are wack.<br><br><br>He was just the same.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope there is no one here that experienced luffy as captain drake</br>  <br>In Germany they call im De Flamingo and Defi<br>makes me mad everytime</br></br>  <br>Other than obvious ones like Zolo the Viz translation was great as a kid.</br>  <br> Hiluluk is Doc Bader </br>  <br>still better than Del Flamenco</br>  <br>Wasn't there a synchro that called Luffy just "Rubber"?<br>I think it was the italian one.<br><br><br>Oh now I remember that in the german dub Zoro was called "Lorenor Zoro".<br><br><br>Where did that even come from?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don Quichotte de Flamingo</br>  <br>I found something uncanny vally</br>  <br>Welcome to the Greek club.</br>  <br> Ace is Puma D.
