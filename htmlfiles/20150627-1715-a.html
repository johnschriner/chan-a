[ Subs are out!  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=download&amp;t<wbr>id=705482  ATA!  </wbr>    Well I can honestly say I get why Japan thinks Yui is gonna win the 8bowl.   Yukinon is still way to autistic to even have a chance. She can't even say no to Yui's proposal without someone doing it first. I've always thought Yukinon was pretty awful as a character but this episode just proves how shit she truly is. How can anyone like her?    First for Gamama  Anyone else think the ending was bad? It didn't answer any questions, and  we didn't get to see Iroha   Goddamnit Commie.   Just give it up, dude.   What the fuck happened to the other thread?  Did the other thread get nuked or was everyone too busy being genuine to notice it was at bump limit?  so what happened to the other thread?       cuntkiller OP would be my guess.        it got nuked   Sides currently colonizing distant planets.   Mods are mad   Horriblesubs are out.  Tomorrow is the final episode/epilogue so I thought I should post this.  For those who don't know. A artist on twitter by the name of Tsukumo has for every episode since UBW started up in October has posted multiple comics of Saber reacting to watching the UBW anime and Shirou reacting (along with other characters watching it). He was doing it based on what was should happen in the episode based on the VN (So he posted it when it happened live) and everything original in the anime.  It got really popular on both twitter and pixiv and he even decided to publish it as doujin.  Going to post all of it from episode 0-episode 24 along with the translated text and Shirou's reaction he posted with it on twitter.  Hope you enjoy.           Prologue/Episode 0  Saber:Shirou... I heard we are going to be on the television today.  Shirou: "Saber, calm down. There's still about 3 hours left."       Shirou! It's starting, Shirou!!   Shirou: "You've been sitting straight while waiting for way too long, Saber..."     That was all the screen time I have...?  Shirou: "Mine's just the same"    Episode 1  Shirou... Apparently we're supposed to see me in action today...   Shirou: "Are you going to sit there and wait like last week, Saber?"       Shirou: "Yeah, I can see it just fine! Saber in action!"  Shota Shirou is fine too...  Shirou: "Where did you learn such a line?"    Shirou: "...Saber? What's wrong?"  On TV:STOP SABER   Shirou: "… I didn't know Command Spells or something…"    Episode 2   Shirou: (She's waiting even earlier than last week...)    Saber singing the first opening of UBW   Shirou: (......What is this cute Heroic Spirit?)    Though Shirou is a Master, the fact that he's such a half-assed Master seems to be the fault of a ghost.  Shirou: "The Holy Grail grants you even that sort of knowledge..."   If anyone actually reading this let me know as thread autosages if only OP posts      Shirou! I don't know why, but suddenly I want to eat mapo tofu!  Shirou: "What an amazing coincidence, me too!"       On TV: I like people like you.  Rin:Hey Archer Archer:Yeah Rin:This is being recorded right? Archer: Dunno        Okay that got a laugh out of me.   I like people like you.    I laughed    Episode 3 (did I mention he did a shit ton of these)  Lets use the Grail and make everyday Saturday, Shirou!  Shirou: "The staff will keel over, so lets not."      Onii-chan  You must be so happy, being called Onii-chan like that...   Shirou: "THAT'S NOT TRUE"       What is Sakura holding?   Ah~... I would have won this if Archer and Shirou had not interrupted me... Right? Shirou??   Shirou: "...Sorry."      Illyasviel... poor thing ... It would be a good thing if she had just inherited Irisviel's lovely appearance... She definitely inherited that devilish cool-headedness...   Shirou: "I don't know who you're talking about, but as far as you said, she must be such a..."      A hug pillow. I must say, she's taking this NTR extortionately well, How very mature she is. Look at her, just smiling at her crush being stolen away by her princess of a sister all with a big smile on her face. What a saint, too bad Rider had to be sacked with Shinji instead of her. I should read the novel one day   ...How much did I spend just in this episode...? No good, no good... If I start thinking about it I can't get over it... Be composed and elegant as always... Be composed and elegant as always...! Uugh... I'm starting to have butterflies in my stomach...    I'm reading  Damn, how many of these did he do?  I don't know if my heart can take this.   Darn, these guys... Who do you guys think is in charge of cleaning up the mess... Although it was less annoying without that damnable Caladbolg there last time... Ahh.... My stomach...      Lets use the Grail and make everyday Saturday, Shirou!   tfw no more UBW on saturdays     Episode 4  They say I'll be going to school in the next episode preview. So I borrowed this from Rin for just today!   Shirou: "Maybe, but I doubt you'll be wearing it in the main part."       There should of been a CPN episode where they make the stupidest most mundane wish they can on the grail just to see how it could possibly warp it to "Kill all of humanity"  Shirou... My stomach...   Shirou: "It's useless to look at me with those eyes. You have to wait till breakfast."    Kill... Wow, that's not gentle! Well, why don't you stay away from Rin then, Shirou!   Shirou: "Oh! Then properly return that uniform to her, why don't you!?"     Hnnnng, seiba 3cute5me  Shirou: (In the screen and in front of me... She's showing off from both sides...!)  I see... So it's this kind of body language....  These are great. Thanks for posting OP.    Episode 5   Shirou: (Hmm?... After she saw that newly appeared servant, Saber's spirit seems to be lowered suddenly.)    You use the command spell right after I told you to refrain from it... You got close to the enemy servant when I told you to stay away... You don't even think of calling me even if the situation demands it. The Holy Grail War this time also seems difficult to deal with.   Shirou:".....Well....I mean...That is...."         Holy crap. Bumping.     That slow realization that she's practically a non character in this adaptation.   Shirou's inexperience is also Kiritsugu's fault.... ....It's all Kiritsugu's... again...   Shirou: (Somehow, she's always gets so emotionally unstable when it comes to my father....)      A bag of worms. Dick worms.     Heheh... Saber. ... Why do you take it for granted that you sit at that side of the table...     why am I so perfect    Rin reaction to Episode 5  Archer:What are you writhing in agony about, Rin..? Rin:...When I look at my own behavior in an objective perspective I start falling into a state of self-loathing... Archer:Hoo... So you do have some self-consciousness. You are what they call a Tsunde- Rin:DON'T SAY IT!       Saber got too excited and thought UBW was suppose to air a day early  Shirou... Even though it's already past midnight, there's no episode 6...   Shirou: "Saber, calm down and check what day is it today."       you forgot to translate this   Episode 6 On TV: I want you to stay over tonight also.   Shit you're right. I was planning on skipping that as it was a extra one he made that was not in the episode. It is just talking about Shirou relationship with Fuji-nee and Sakura       Tohsaka Rin pleases old men.   Shirou: "Saber is usually in high spirits when watching Fate, but it's scary that she makes an expressionless face each time Shinji is on-screen..."   Looks like Sakura punched her head back.    Jesus Christ, Saber Dial back on the cute before you kill everyone   Hoping there is more Sakura watching this route. It's getting more hilarious.          When did Sakura get so scary?   On TV: I can't leave my sister with you.   There is      She realized she fucked up her chance.   The King's cuteness is clearly ∞. Hnnng.  I want to see Saber's reaction when she's forced to destroy the Grail by Kiritsugu.  tfw rewatched that scene 10+ times because it's so good    Illya and Rin, Rider then Caster, fufu... Being assaulted by all sorts of females everyday, Shirou is such a sinful man.   Shirou: "Don't say such misleading thing!"      A Samurai.....huh I really wanted to get some fighting experience with a certain sword style I think it was called..... Hiten Mitsurugi-ryuu! Kenshin:I don't want to work!   Shirou "So why does the Holy Grail grant her that sort of knowledge?"         Reminder that these violent bitches beat shirou up together once because he wouldn't listen, where as Rin just scolded him then told him not to do it again or at least include her in on it as well so she doesn't feel left out. Truly the best girl.    On TV:Once I get my hands on the Holy Grail, I'll just leave this world.   Shirou: "Even though it's your own line, why are you making a face as if this is the first time you hear it?"     Does Shirou have the most women beating him up out of all Type Moon Protagonists?     Reminder that these violent bitches beat shirou up together once because he wouldn't listen   When did this happen?     Episode 7  Shirou...! When did you get so much closer to Archer...!?   Shirou: (Somehow, she began to go huff huff)       No, I think Shiki gets abused worse   I won't lag behind Archer in swordsmanship... Caster's spells are also ineffective when met against my Anti-Magic. As long as that Assassin guy isn't here, I'm probably the Champion of this place~ Really, as long as that Assassin guy isn't here....!   Shirou: "Oh, right."        HOLY SHIT IS RIN TYPING ON /a/ AS WELL!?  This comic is getting a bit too meta for me       Not that guy, but there is a scene in the novel where, if you don't get home to Saber quick enough to make her dinner, she basically beats the shit out of him under the guise of "training".      early heavens feel and a scene in HA. Also, both bitches are cockblockers in that game where as Rin leaves Shirou alone. Seriously worst girls only whiteknight faggots would like these balls and chains.   Three strokes were released in one swing...huh. If I master this technique, I'll be able to overwhelmingly secure the side dishes from Taiga.   Shirou: "To use the technique that is capable of matching a Noble Phantasm for that...?"      Someone is into selfcest   Shirou, by any chance, is that his own wording he created based on the phrase "absorbed in the ideal"...? About that, let's ask the person in question carefully this time.   Shirou: (Forced to explain what he said with so much confidence... How frightening...)      Shiki's harem are more aggresive but he can tame them. Meanwhile shirou only aused by Rin.    Are Mikiya and Shizuki truly the most blessed Type Moon MCs?    So close Sakura  Since the beginning of time     Yeah... Archer attacking Shirou is certainly... ... "fine".   Shirou: "Wait a minute, what are you implying?"       Meanwhile shirou only aused by Rin.   Maybe in the HA dream world. She never hits him in the original novel.     .......Why did you do that....? Ah, so it's that kind of attitude. Hmm.... Then keep kneeling there until you say something.     When she accessed literally unlimited mana and became god    Fucking fujo.    Does Saber actually love Archer as much as Shirou?  How happy would Archer be if he knew this, considering his Saber is gone?     Episode 8 Today's Saturday, Shirou! And moreover...! It's also the "Good Meat" day!   Shirou: "Today's dinner's fish."       Well, with her, it's probably like being sandwiched by two shirous. So she'd love it.    Shirou... I'm sorry but, could you please refrain from putting anymore seaweed into the miso soup for a while...?   Shirou: "Don't blame the food... Although, I can see the connection"      Shirou: "Today's dinner's fish."   BTFO     Shirou...! Stop taking the periodical "Food Terrorism" during this time period!   Shirou: "Can you ask that to me in the screen?"      When it's Shirou it's okay   GJ, Shirou...! You're finally willing to obediently listen to my advice...   Shirou: "Ah...uhm, I'm sorry, somehow."     This stuff is great. Thanks for posting it, OP  Rider:My turn... Why does it have to end...?  Sakura: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that useless brother    TV:Ah, looks like everyone's still alive. Now what's left is to get help. ...So, should we get an ambulance in this situation? Kirei:Hmm... Right, since I have my hands full with the growing matters at Ryuudo temple...  TV:It'll do with contacting the Church. Kirei will manage the rest after we explain. Kirei:I KNEW IT       Episode 9  Shirou: (Archer's stir-up seems to have worked extremely well.)    Didn't have a chance.  Keep em coming.    Let's bear with it for now, Rider. We will be key characters in the movie version, eventually... our patience will be rewarded....    What did Sakura do to Shirou after seeing that?   TV:Issei, don't say anything, just take off your jacket!   Shirou:"(Oh no..! She's seems to be having some strange misunderstanding again...!)"    Heart attack thread? Heart attack thread.  Ah, while the TV's showing that blonde guy, can I turn it off, Shirou?   Shirou: "Why?"    I'm excited   Made me laugh, poor Kirei   TV:Kiritsugu-san was the kind of person that was OK with anything you did. Good things, bad things - everything was just a part of life for him. When you see someone like that, you can't help but do something about it.  Saber:Oh, you're a funny one, Taiga~   Shirou: (The Kiritsugu I remember and the Kiritsugu that Saber remembers really don't match.)        You can think of me like an older sister if you want, Shirou.   Twitch    Shirou: (A tiny older sister....Huh? Why does this feels strangely familiar...)       Come on, Saber. I know you use to be a guy, but- Er, wait   Please explain        Episode 10  In the face of my Anti-Magic, Caster's attacks are insignificant.  It's a pity for them, since now without Assassin around this battle is gonna be a one-sided victory for me!   Shirou: "As expected of you, Saber!"          Rin:...When I look at my own behavior in an objective perspective I start falling into a state of self-loathing...    Shirou: "Ah."     Oh lawd   Any prediction for chapter 34?   Haise gets to work on the mass kidnappings that will lead him to Tsukiyama.   Is autisma's ownership rights permanent or is there a limit as with haise and hinami?    Is autisma's ownership rights permanent or is there a limit as with haise and hinami?  No, Autisma has the CCG's permission to use Haise as their weapon as long as he is useful.    Is Hinami best imouto and girl? Also whats going to happen to her   I don't understand this manga at fucking all. How come "haise" forgot that hes kaneki? I got that he didn't want more of his friends dead so he went to work for ccg but how did he forgot who he was? Did they brainwashed him or something?     He got brainFUCKED Literally     Autisma skull raped Kaneki causing him amnesia. CCG took advantage of this and created him a new personality, Haise. And seeing at how Ishida is treating the whole Kaneki vs Haise's plot, they are two personalities fighting for the same body. Chapter 32 and chapter 33 and this article:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disso<wbr>ciative_identity_disorder Support this. </wbr>      Why isn't anyone in here?   Because this manga is shit. It lacks nearly everything that made the original good.    Like what?    no spoilers   we will see her again   Because spoilers come out at 2 not 9 pm. I have better things to do the hear you guys complain    An MC that's not shit, for one.    1) Yes.  2) short term, no idea. Long term, she'll be rescued     Is there a bigger jobber in CCG than Sasucky?   What's wrong with Haise?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227108  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227164  DON'T DO THIS TO ME      Is Hinami best imouto and girl?  No. Best imoutos don't join domestic terrorist organizations with a cannibal supremacist agenda. And they don't become roommates with serial killers and mass murderers. If anything she's been kind of a crap imouto for the last few years.     I figured you guys who actually liked him would be happier he was gay now.    /cgl/ on /a/  This kills me.    Report and ignore.     who actually liked him would be happier he was gay now  Are you talking about Haise? The only thing I want for Haise is the void.      Look at this wasted character.    Look at this wasted panel time.    We did that game already.    It was fun.    It's just gonna be shitty build up.  It'll have a bit of new info and a little bit of happening at the end, serving as the cliffhanger for this chapter.       It's just gonna be shitty build up  At least I hope Ishida keeps the Quinx content at the minimum.     in quinque form.     I hope Ishida doesn't develop the main cast   Why does Ishida develop the main cast?   I hate the main cast!   Bring my edge back!   The realtionship /a/ has with this manga right now.         I want the real main cast    You seem to think I care about the Quinx at the least to wish development for them.     main cast  You mean when Ishida changed Anteiku cast pre Aogiri to Kaneki's gangster team after 6 months timeskip? There is no such thing as main cast, all characters are relevant.      Exactly.  At this point Ishida focuses on Qs and CCG. When he is done with them, he will move on, with Kaneki-Haise-Next_Stage being the only constant.       The only thing I want to know about is about Our Hero Amon and his Batgirl Kuro.    When will Haise have time to complete his kakuja? He could eat faggyama maybe   Damn, I wonder how strong he'd get if he ate Tatara, Noro, or pineapple.  I imagine that he would need to go full kakuja to beat Arima or Eto.       When will Haise   Haise  Reaching this point with that pussy still acting like someone splits on his faces whenever someone connects him with Kaneki, Haise is going to die crying because someone called him Kaneki.       You know I mean Kaneki / Kaneki after he absorbs Haise    Yeah I agree. He might be able to keep up with Arima without it eventually, but that's probably it. If Arima has time to set up IXA mines he needs Full kakuja         Wait is Kuro still kicking around     I imagine he'd need to eat someone with huge amounts of rc, he probably won't start regularly cannibalizing again. Either that or he was drinking ghoul juice all along and suddenly goes full kak against arima      You know I mean Kaneki  No, anon, I didn't know you mean my lord and savior. Use the correct word.    What are the CCG feeding Haise? Can he eat food now?    Sorry anon      What are the CCG feeding Haise?  Probably ghoul juice.  Can he eat food now?  No.       Once you get to the point of eating human meat you can't go back. He probably eats death row inmates or ghoul juice.     No one would care how strong a character can get. Besides if already they all can eat each-other and become whatever they are, and I talking about half ghouls and ghouls too.       Could ghoul juice be giving him rc points? We really don't know if his count has been reduced since part 1      Amon said in chapter 31 "Yasuhisa" (written in a diferent way), which is Kuro and Shiro's family name.     Come again?     Did you have a stroke while typing this?    Ayyyy that's gonna be great     I think he's saying power levels don't matter, or that he'll just absorb the strength of who he eats so it's pointless to talk about      I was talking about the MC. You seem to suck his dick all the time.      What does the second sentence mean?      Everyone sucks Kaneki now that Haise is around     Can I suck both   I would really appreciate if a particular fag stop double spacing your sentence.    Only in batoto     I forgot to mention if they cannibalize each-other their RC level increased by a ton.    Yup, honestly she's great  Nothing, there's literally 1% chance Ishida will do anything to her, 0.00001% she will die.  Once someone's parents have died and they're spared death like she was, she wont die anytime soon. Plus most characters still have residual plot armour since he still hasn't explained shit about anyone who existed in the original manga.        Seidou was far worse when he was in the CGG     Amon was a jobber too. As well as Shinohara. Urie.     Haise/Void OTP, Hoid for short.    They wanted edge and he gave them Urie. Its like making a fucking wish on the monkey paw.      Kaneki will be the non edgy autist badass   Yes please        Funny thing is that Pineapple and the constant cockteasing of Kaneki is literally keeping TG:re from being a borefest.      And they don't become roommates with serial killers and mass murderers  Implying there something bad on becoming one or liking them. The CCG Pov really mind fucked you since they are all fucking criminals. And don't worry humans are not so moral in reality too, for slaughtering animals like chinks doing it without any problems.     Yeah, barely, as opposed to being being great if he took the developments he's turtleheading in stride    Then dumblr wants Tsukiyama and Ishida gives them a shit tier crying princess, I bet Hide is their next wish.    Nice edge, anon. Please don't post more till you're 18, though.     I'm tempted to just wait a few years so I can just read the whole thing through and see Kaneki finally become the strongest and a full kakuja     Good, get out then.    Nice projecting. It's not even faggot, just because I like them doesn't mean I'm edgy. You forgot? They are all morally grey.    Don't cut yourself on that edge, friendo &lt;:^)    Why has projecting become the newest buzzword? It has absolutely nothing to do with this context. It's basically "NO U" now.     oh how the tides have turned  At least now that he's Pineapple I don't have to pop a blood vessel out of boredom each time his character comes on screen.      Why are you like this?     Yeah such a beautiful princess    I thought edgy is the buzzword. And whats the problem with liking the other group?    You are now aware that CCG and Aogiri deployed all of their jobbers at the auction while all the competent characters were fighting offscreen in the escort battle.   auction arc was LITERALLY the jobber arc       4 leafs trebol. It's good luck for Hinami Right?     There is no problem. The problem is his childish moral rationalizations.   The ghoul investigators we need, but not the ones we deserve.   She has been wearing it ever since her mommy was still alive and no luck has come.    Someone should dress them up as the Qs     Hoid for short     No, it's just this thread filled with CCGfags     Pineapple and the constant cockteasing of Kaneki is literally keeping TG:re from being a borefest  So true that hurts.      ___fags   No anon, you are the cancer.     There's something I'd like to figure out, cause this shit's been bugging me for some time.  Did Touka lose her Kagune? Ayato ate that shit up. Can ghouls even lose their Kagune? Touka hasn't used her Kagune since her fight against Ayato.  I'd assume that ghouls can't lose their Kagune as long as their Kakuhou is still in place, correct?       I think she's just useless and wanted to focus more on school so she avoided any chance to use it.    Such words from a shipperfag yourself.     their kakuhou regrow too. Kagune and kakuja come from kakuhou     top b8.   If you really are that retarded, I was just dumping whatever image I had in order to hopefully give my shitty meta post slightly more value.       If faggots like this speaking for everyone, like Hinami is a bad person for joining a group like Aogiri, you nothing bad delusional.    But*    But they can't all be the dog...    I want to see more stuff with Eto and her dog Seidou. Doujins never.     I just want more Eto. Maybe soon enough there be more screentime with her.    I want to enjoy watching her torturing suffering-kun for my tragedy boner.     Flashback of her raping seidou when      that will lead him to Tsukiyama's dick  Fixed it for you, anon.     While in Owl mode?     Maybe soon. But I don't really care about him, I just want to know more about Eto      He eats Tsukiyama dick first, obtaining boner shaped kakuja     Owl mode best mode     everyones face when some random fuck draws and animates this     Kek   <br/>   The only thing that TG has is fujoshit. I wish I could draw to draw het doujins.    She can eat me any day ifyouknowwhatimsayin    Owl mode is stronk and has a very long tongue. I need say no more.         has a very long tongue  Eto's owl tongue is very long. Kinda want to suck on that.     Moon people is with you. Volume 3 sold less than volume 2 even though when it had 6 days, when vol 2 had 4 days when the sales were counted.     Some 2ch ppl have been saying it is because of trump ticket effect.     trump ticket effect.  Care to explain?     The only way to obtain trump card deck is to buy vol 1, vol 2, and some certain Jump issues.  Now that the decks are distributed, there is no need to hoard more volumes.      Is Shirazu the chosen one? The only other Rank 2 investigators who have rocked an S ranked quinque are absolute monsters.       Makes sense. Now most fans will just buy young jump     Editor-kun needs other ways to make people buy :re until Ishida is done with Haise.    Saiko is the one who actually rekt her. Shirazu only dealt the killing blow once she was incapacitated.   Supoira- when?    Now most fans will just buy young jump  Moon people doesn't buy the magazines, they buy the volumes. So if the volumes are doing bad is because people isn't happy.     Nah he formed the plan to immobilized her so that Saiko can do some shit. He contributed more the subjugation of Nuts.   I will go back to the normal trend.       soon     Oh I see. Will Ishida pander to shonen and fujo now,     He needs to carter more to his seinen fags who are mostly adult males and they are doing a pretty good job at complaining.     Moon people doesn't buy the magazines  You saying they just go to convenience store, loiter, Read what they want to read, then leave? Even if they end up in the garbage or in manga cafes, somebody has to be buying those issues.       Ishida pander to shonen and fujo now  Is Ishida shitting on this manga on purpose? Haise was more tolerable in the early chapters, but now it seems it has became Ishida's hobby to make him shittier and shittier.      You saying they just go to convenience store, loiter, Read what they want to read, then leave?  According to some nips that came here, moon people waits 3 mouths to continue with the manga.      pander to shonen and fujo now  Fuck them, the other group should just keep on complaining. And Ishida just could ignore the fujos but no he wants the money.     The number is insignificant compared to volume buyers.     It seems like shonen and seinen fans both just want kaneki or a merge, full kakuja, and more badass fights with banter. I have mixed feelings     That so odd though, as you would expect general issues to have greater sales volume as it has a more diverse buyer base as opposed to single volumes of issues.   Now though. are you mentioning, issue to total any series volume?      I stopped discussing his characterization 3 chapters ago because it is so convoluted. I'm only reading Re for V and Clowns now.    Are you telling me you are happy with this amnesia bullshit and with Haise's complaints "Gua, someone called me Kaneki, I-I'm not Kaneki"?    nobody who read the original TG likes haise, this is basically a fact, he is even a step below kaneki from chapter 1, a character who basically lost all of kaneki's development and acts like a beta cuckold   I want to know if amon knows about haise sasaki, and if he is going to fight or talk with him. And i want more pinezawa, is fucking hilarious, do you think the ccg has coverted arata kirishima in an armor factory? What will do haise if he gets full kaneki? he is going to act, to gain time for hinami or he is just going to fuck everything and trying to scape?    Spoilers should be here already    kaneki  Ditch CCG and make a group with Amon, Kuro, Hinami and Ayato.     Two problem that I myself avoid buying the issues is the paper quality and I can borrow it from friends or from a cafe to read. It is similar to reading newspapers.     issue to total any series volume?  I don't know issue sale data but most of my twitter friends wait for the volume release or if they are curious, they can read the raw online.        No but I don't want it to become nothing but epic fights and double spreads     Nah we won't know any of that since the Qx and Tsukiyama's family faggotry will take most of panel time.     nothing but epic fights and double spreads  But this is what :re has been so far. The epic fight with Seidou and Haise.    Spoilers when?    Actually that'd be better than this fujo garbage     i don't think anyone really enjoys the amnesia plot, but i prefer that re avoids going into shounen powerlevel bullshit territory     No but I don't want it to become nothing but epic fights and double spreads  Are you aware that the central point of RE is the teasing of Kaneki's return, all those epic fights and SoL for 33 chapters?     I don't think so, it would be awesome, but ccg isn't amon objetive, kaneki too he will remember all of his ccg friends, i think they're going to destroy aogiri, not in group but they will do it.     That was only half of one chapter     But Amon knows about CCG's dark secrets, Kaneki can join him and fix the world.     I would honestly love that over this amnesia      That was only half of one chapter  Fight with Qx and Nishiki, fight with Nuts and CCG jobbers and Shirazu, fight with Pineapple and Haise. So far the catharsis of the volumes are being fights.      Well, the best arc was the owl operation, and it was full of fights, but with psychological issues too. Was interesting, when kaneki was dying remembering all his life and things like that.      but i prefer that re avoids going into shounen powerlevel bullshit territory  And why it would have to go to powerlevel territory?     Kaneki should just become kakujautist now instead of at tarot 19 so these fights aren't just annoying     CCG's dark secrets  They need to fix their balance sheet and or squeeze all those ghoul shorts.     Excuse me, but this was awesome as hell.     It already is. Everyone becoming kakuja, Kaneki confirmed to surpass Arima, probably other shit too      That wasn't the fight, it was the foreplay. And it was annoying because Haise won't just use his full power and become Kaneki      i don't mind the fights themselves, just as long as they don't get too kitschy. i said that in my other post in reference to people wanting kaneki to be the strongest, etc etc      Everyone becoming kakuja, Kaneki confirmed to surpass Arima  I think different of powelevels, but well that's your opinion. With Kaneki remembering and ditching CCG after meeting Amon and doing something would be more interesting than Haise complaining because people called him Kaneki.       You don't think he'll become stronger than Arima?    o-ok...   sauce?    Umareru Kachi no Nakatta Jibun ga Anna no Tame ni Dekiru Ikutsuka no Koto     Oh hey its that manga where the MC is a total ,fucking scumbag, holy shit how can he be like that.     my kinda mc    It's the most realistic second chance series    I hope he gets killed, he's such a colossal piece of human garbage    you're good at gibberish     that title      He gets a happy ending with the chick he likes after he is murdered in this life.     Sure   That MC is a fucking edgy fucklord. HE HAS A ULTRA CUTE LOLI TOMBOY THAT -LITERALLY- LOVES HIS DICK  AND WHAT HE DOES? DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT HER AND IS EDGY WITH EVERYONE  FFFFFFFUCKING HELL             realistic  Not really, no.      realistic   Sure if you're a total fucking fatass loser that hasn't contributed anything to society and just remained an edgy Gaylord blaming everyone but yourself for your problems.      l-m-a-o     there is actually something called that  And here I was about to applaud your nippongo and creativity.     But it can't be a happy ending. The only way to end it happy is to let that anna go and have 3 kids with the blonde.        second-chance story where early on he finds out nothing will change at all   decides to do whatever the fuck he wants because he might aswell enjoy this new life        There's other ways to enjoy life than being an edgelord elementary school rapist.  That's a strange sentence out of context, huh?      The most realistic one is probably Again!! since he literally just makes people join a club.    This is the third timeline, the 2nd he did something similar.  The person possessing anna's cousin is his rape baby from the second timeline.     Bullshit, he doesn't even try to do anything interesting with his knowledge of the future.    Doesn't he explicitly not give a shit? Like, that other guy keeps wanting to be chuuni about it and get rich and fuck idols and stuff, and the MC isn't having any of it.    Hiro knew what was up.  Should have bought some bitcoins.       Hiro kun is a fucking edgemaster, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor.  I would have given the go at winning the lottery, I mean MC doesnt even want to work or study anyways.      The cute tomboy blonde girl is literally the perfect girl. Fucking settle with her and be done with it. That's what I'd do.    Apathic, non desperate, non retard MC that doesn't fill a self-insert quota for the NEETs that have exhentai as their home page  Picked up     Might be a self insert for the author.    Shindol: The Manga    Is there a scanlation group for this that's faster than Mankitsu scans? The raws have been out forever and I'm losing my patience...       They never mention the guy's father. I wonder if that's another reason he's so rotten.   This manga makes me angry just thinking about it. I wish it didn't exist.    A realistic second chance series would involve you simply doing the same things you did the first time around.    Yea, let's be honest here, the people that have such a shitty life style in the first place wouldn't have the willpower to do anything differently.    What kind of retard would do that?    I'd totally fuck my sister if given a second chance.    People that already made their life into something shitty.    You really underestimate second chances. I often see people that don't study for a test at all and go in knowing they are fucked, but the test gets postponed and they start studying.  Now think that you can salvage your entire life. If your life has already started going shitty, it can easily snowball, but these manga put people in a position where they can stop it before it even starts.      jesus, seeing that typed out is maddening. how gay do you have to be to refuse that?    Picked up.  The MC is a fucking demon, I love it.       refuse  He fucks her several times, but she is just a fuckbuddy.    MC is blood infuriating. I hope his death is painful.    tfw not enough anime/manga have scumbag MCs    Why are you guys freaking out about a little rape?  Kek   More like freaking out about MC being a retarded cunt.   Classic Japan shitting on tomboys, nothing to see here.    How can he not love her, fucking wife material AND from childhood, right off the bat.  Yes, I mad.       What does japan have against tomboys for fuck's sake.    She'd fuck anyone who treats her like a girl      He then hits her with a crowbar or something.     a guy who gets a second chance and makes things even worse how do you not enjoy the morbidity of that  still a better second chance series than that piece of shit Again.   Again was fine till around chapter 40-50 can't remember. Whenever he starts jumping back and forth.   I remember it was getting pretty popular and then dropped off from /a/.      I think it completely lost any sense of direction after the baseball game.    I hope Kazuya beats the Cousin.  His misdeeds are the best.     MC is the biggest piece of shit in all of history. How can people seriously like him?  So a yandere is after his dick, he is fucking a cute tomboy, he wants his other childhood friend and someone's out to kill him. JUST     a yandere is after his dick  what? where did you get that from?     Wait isn't braids after his dick?    Thanks for reminding me of the shitty Shamo ending.    Ki special attack route doesn't seem so bad now over REALISM, huh?    That was stupid too, but fuck, I didn't think the author was THAT mad about the whole thing. It seemed like he wanted to kill it as hard as he possibly could and just forget about it.   so the cousin is from the new future he's creating right? that's a nice twist.   hey, me too    If you mean she wants his dick chopped up and given to the pigs, then sure.    He's worse tho    well he just has to treat her like a girl better and she will only love him then     non desperate  He's desperate as fuck.  non retard  EVERY one of his actions is of a retard   that doesn't fill a self-insert quota for the NEETs that have exhentai as their home page   He is acting like a edgelord that goes to sadpanda and only fap to NTR rape.         Why do you have to remind me about this shit manga?  holy shit i'm just barely at the part where he fucks his bully over. this character is so detestable but it doesn't mean that can't be entertaining in its own right  Wow, I got curious so I read this shit, the mc is so fucking retarded it really hurted me  is there any manga where the MC had a cute tomboy after his dick and DIDN'T act like a complete autist and ruin it?   TWGOK...    He doesn't find out that nothing will change. He just gives up on accomplishing anything after a single setback and then blames all of his problems on other people.  I guess it is realistic in the sense that a loser like him would give up quickly and blame other people for his own shortcomings but the speed and ease at which he's fallen into depravity aren't. He's a very unrealistic character grounded in some very realistic problems I suppose?  Anyway, his edgy faggot routine aside, I'm enjoying the manga. It makes me laugh and I'm interested in seeing how low he'll sink. That's more than I can say about other manga at least.        Where are the raws? I can't find them on senmanga.   This manga was so stupid. Instead of using what he knows about the future to become filthy rich or something he goes and starts drama over some fucking middle school crush. Who the fuck would even do that if it happened to someone?   also that scene where he fugs the tomboy is kind of hot    Check the comments section for mankitsu's latest chapter translation.     Gets bully killed and then fucks his bitch on the day of the funeral  Top keks were had.     Kazuya, I love you  I hate that fucking frog but REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE    An mentally crippled otaku of thirty years plus, mind warped by manga and anime, that's who.    wait he kills the tomboy? this is one grating as fuck manga     Yes, after she took a stab to the shoulder for him.     he kills the tomboy  I want him to die so badly I can taste it.    pssh now I need to fap to some loli tomboy hentai    What the fuck?     Can I have some more context? was it childhood crush cousin stabbing him?    but what if it goes something like all you need is kill, where everytime you die you reset? That would just give him another chance to fuck things up    Bless you anon.    I was thinking he was living under the assumption that all he has to do is die so he'll reset his life or revert back to his normal life. That was the reason he's acting like this.   Someone roughly translate volume 3 please   Well, IIRC from what a spoiler anon said MONTHS ago  Cousin is being possessed? / has the conscious / is Anna's Rape baby with Kazuya. Anna committed suicide in the girls timeline due to the mental trauma caused by the Rape. Kazuya was pretty much a playboy/not NEET. Considering that I only know limited moon I can only assume based on the image that Kazuya and Tomboy set up an ambush to kill the cousin. Kazuya said something to Tomboy to make her go into shock and drop her knife, cousin picks it up and tries to fling it to Kazuya but its instead taken by Tomboy. She comes on to him and he basically goes insane.      well, in a certain way, dying does release you from all your obligations.   Also this is the epilogue.  When is this shit gonna end? I enjoyed reading but at the same time hated it, I just want it to fucking end so I can forget this ever existed.   it already ended?    Goddamn, that's some brutal shit.  I'm amazed he still gets a good ending or so I hear.      Why didn't he just concentrate on skipping grades and getting rich from knowing the future?  Seems like easy mode to me     i don't know the least about of moonrunes but given the type of answer i'm going to assume yes    完　is the moonrune end.    fucking hell, it doesn't even have a proper ending?  How shit can this manga get?      damn...    she didn't die. She reverts back to before the shit happened with Kaz. With the newfound knowledge she avoids him like the plague and lives her life correctly.    i hate you why can't i read moonrunes    this is probably the edgiest manga I've read in my life. like, why? This is so edgy and depraved it's completely nonsense It's like a parody of itself.    That was my delusions speaking. I dont think anyone gets happy end this manga.   Someone just translate the last few pages      ---        This series is so fucking terrible. Dropped it hard.    Just enjoy how much of a scumbag the MC is. It's a refreshing twist from a goodie goodie sometimes.    It looks like we have a " Oh it's just a dream, those horrible things never happened to me "-end    that's it?     can you at least post the pages of mc  dying?        Not the anon dropping the raws. The translation is pretty slow.             I wouldn't even pretend to myself that I was going to change anything that would require long-term effort to change or that was caused by my own laziness or whatever the first time around, because I'd still be just as lazy and shitty. I would, though, change shit based on knowledge I didn't have the first time around. Spend a few weeks of allowance on bitcoins, tell the right people about a kid's depression, etc.       All I'd do is invest in buttcoins too so I can be what I always wanted to be     http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/nisekoi/en/0/176/  FUCKING DROPPED  </wbr>  Please tell me this won't turn into some contest where she chooses Raku to compete for her right to marry someone else against this unknown suitor. It'll be like that arc from Medaka Box but less fun.   I doubt Yui has fans, also she's familyzoned    We're approaching the end of their second year, that's why stuff seems to be happening. But I'm afraid the story ends at the end of their third year. No climax soon, sorry.     Could be worse. Could be a "I'm the rightful heir to this family and i'll beat you to prove it" and essentially be the Varia arc from Reborn! but without the sudden battle asspull     LMAO   RIP thread. Let's try again, shall we?  Captain, please don't. just this time.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127235892  So they are troubled by a love triangle? If I am interpreting this right that means 8man gave them the go ahead to have one, and they consented to give him something genuine. Does that mean the love triangle will be a plot point going forward?   First for possibly the shittiest anime original ending ever.  Sento that is all    Horny teenagers that is all.   As I expected. Her long hair looks shitty.  all of my yes    OVA?    Subs when??    mature people aren't allowed to be horny   looking sexy is a bad thing          blushing in the bathtub    She just itched the ditch to Kanye, didn't she?   Yeah, just came out.          Literally perfect.   Sento is good for nothing but breeding.   Her Sentos are bigger, perfect.      Ova??    I don't know man, I think she's also good for  hugging  and  squeezing       high quality sexual experience      Adorable.      she could single-handedly solve the birth crisis   Special episode 7 when?   Dick status: muh    How does this girl manage to lose blood so easily ? She bleeds more than Mirai      So, AV-chan is only loser,  because she won our hearths and shes too good for this?        How much does Sento, flick the bean ?        All these bare shoulders are putting my dick in trouble.          Fuck you gundam for this fetish         HAVE MERCY ON MUH DICK      She probably doesn't and just goes to bed frustrated.    Bath Fairy not blushing in the bath would be stranger.       This is the perfect ratio.      get out of the cave and stops being a NEET   get to hang out with fairies regularly  Nigga's lucky.      Fuck you KyoAni,  my dick can't handle this        How does this girl manage to lose blood so easily?  Illegitimate daughter of Ric Flair.     Brilliant Sento Park     How does this girl manage to lose blood so easily ? She bleeds more than Mirai   She s cursed. An evil fairy possessed her. The Fairy feeds off Hope, and picked her as a host because she is a strong optimistic girl. The fairy generate more hope to feed on by making her life miserable whenever he can, forcing her to fight the pain with even more optimism.      these hips should be illegal     Nigga's lucky.  Gatoh said that he is actually a very decent mid-rank manager. So he is good for something.     They are. I'll be taking them into custody for a while.    wrestling is my fetish    Why is fire so happy   Sento is  boring .     She's wearing her best friend's outfit.    I really like Eiko, but she hasn't won my hearth.    Subs?     Why is fire so happy  Indirect scissoring.     Hestia, please.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127209709  Yeah, I guess    Surely they washed the outfit before she put it on. Otherwise it'd be covered in Muse's sweat and water.    Definitely wouldn't want that. Not one bit.     All these bare shoulders   All this bare midriff   I can't go an episode without getting hard       She lost, but she's the winner of Best Girl  Human Division     I want to lift with her.   i dropped this despite sento   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210313  I still haven't finished it despite Sento.     Does she really do bestiality videos?    Anon, think about how many times that outfit changed hands. Muse -&gt; Sento -&gt; Koboli -&gt; Sylphy -&gt; Salama -&gt; Sento -&gt; Muse I don't think they had time to wash it six times. That thing must have been filthy by the end of the day.          hnnnnnnnngg    I think I want to smell it.    She narrates animal videos.      Where does she keeps her gun hidden?     That ara ara  Why isn't Eiko a mom?     what the fuck is wrong with her hands?    that is litterally the most fertile bodyto be ever drawn.     Sexual Tension Intensifies       Sweet Jesus     Why isn't Eiko a mom?  Because  she is avoiding her fiancée from an arranged marriage, and is taking up this job to get away from him.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210496  That's a dude, Anon.    Is it weird that I find the different shoes she is wearing the most interesting part about it all?    I'd plunder their booty    No, animating feet is actually extremely hard so most animated things go out of their way to not show them at all, outside of the most basic shots or fanservice.   Thank you based Kanye.    Sento with wind clothes  My  heart  can't handle this.    Subs please. Please.  please   Is such a perfect body even possible?   So, what exactly is up for this to happen, are they switching roles for the day?      damm now what am i supposed to do with this boner? is there a sad panda of these 3 semen demon?       Muse messes up her neck   Sento took Muse's place   Latifa took Sento's while Muse take Latifa's  And then Sento go through auditioning for other fairies role to see if they can get her to fit anywhere.       Latfia in Sento's place is going to be hard, through it'd be hilarious to see her with sento's trademark gun.    Okay, why does she speak seal?  And why are the seals aroused by Macaron falling into the tentacle pit?      she's an animal expert  those seamen have been at sea for a while anon      Find a flaw? Protip: maybe her butt hurts.    This isn't a school uniform but I'm sure Gatoh approves.   Now I want a S2. Take responsibility Kyoani   Well, he wrote the script for the OVA afterall.    Koboli has the flyest shoes     Kyoani plays with your dick but doesn't take responsibility and give you an S2     So he wrote this. What a cock tease.     Princess Muse      those seamen have been at sea for a while anon     Koboli would be right at home watching a bunch of horny sailors engaged in homosexual acts.    just fuck already     Subs when   never    can't autismoe    I wonder how long before they show Pirate Sento figma.   Why is she so perfect /a/?  no srsly, what makes her so perfect? In every other anime she'd be that boring brown haired girl beside all that other interesting characters,     In my headcanon she does.    She's a kuudere with just the right amount of thickness    she is one of the best designed characters out there, i like to think she is one of the fulfillments of the "perfectly attractive girl" ideal     being this wrong   Sento is just another autistic bitch with cowtits. You guys love her purely because you're chubby chasers in denial.      I too don't think Sento is perfect. However, I don't think she's bad either.     Thank you BASED Kanye!      liking planks and skeletons  get a load of this faggot       yeah she's autistic but shes not even close to chubby    As a buyfag I will put my title in line and sell all the figures I owe if I don't get 2 of them.   Godammit Kyoani. You made me rewatch the show for the third time now.  where are the subs  How can a girl be so perfect? It feels wrong. It shouldn't be allowed.   Somebody please tell Kyoani to stop saving anime so much, I need to drop that shit hobby already.   Salama needs to start lifting.   What's the name of that fetish exactly?       Spandex+Midriff lover?    Trips confirm the truth - as if there was any doubt.   I suppose it'll do. I was hoping for something more concise. It's a quality fetish though.       SPATS    But it's not just spats, is it? The sports bra thing is important too.   Does this mean she can't be my waifu anymore?   Maybe it's familial love?    They're magically bonded to her and she can pull it out of any area where her skin is exposed. She prefers to pull them out of her thighs    I wouldn't mind being a magical girl with gun summoning powers, kinda like Mami.     Is S2 habbening?  Are you virile enough to impregnate all the Amagis?    In one orgy? Maybe not, unless they share the cum. I can maybe go 3 times in one session.     What happens if you impregnate Latifa close to her yearly revert-back?    spontaneous abortion    Free abortion mang       And why are the seals aroused by Macaron falling into the tentacle pit?    ...were you not?       They're not touching my dick, that's what.   But in all seriousness, KyoAni can never seem to be able to draw hands for whatever reason. Everything else they can pull off perfectly.      whatever fetus she has reverts to its component parts and requisite semen flies out of her vag and back up your dick       8 safe months a year       Mexican heritage night at the park    yfw we won't get a mascot special     What happens if you impregnate Latifa close to her yearly revert-back?  She is not physically old enough to have hit puberty you silly.     i prefer fat stronk bald faceless man ceo with lots of experience plz   Sento a dead fish and major waste of a nice body.    nice body  She's literally obese     Trying a bit too hard there.    Him and KyoAni both.     tfw I know what you're talking about   It's kind of sad really       Earth gets embarrased because she's wearing a skirt   Her normal uniform shows more        In a couple sessions, yeah probably    she wears spacious panties  muse wears a tight thong      sheer heart attack    A skirt seems lewder somehow.  It is what you don't show that is most exciting.      i dont think that explains the pictures on her phone    DEM LEGS  dancing in heels   Sento is a sex goddess.      Subs when?    muse wears a tight thong  That thong must have been filthy by the time she got it back at the end of the day.     I want to wear it as my mask   Link for the ovas?   What did Salama tell to Koboli about that picture.     sento in stockings    jesus christ i'm so hard i could hammer nails with my dick     I'm starting to think this show was horribleand overrated. The only things Amagi threads even talk about is waifus, nothing on the plot, nothing on the characters, just how much they wanna have sex with those characters. Must of really been a bad show.   Why don't you go try it you retarded little faggot    what is wrong with you nice digits btw      Sento as Salama  Oh gosh     I don't remember blood sport in Amagi Park except for the pirate show, but this is fucking amazing.       threads on /a/ are full of lowest common denominator retards who can only post about how much they want to fuck the girls  Man what a fucking shock   most anons don't bother discussing shows with fanservice because philistines will just call them shiteaters trying to justify their waifubait or something equally illogical.       it's a comedy, and a pretty good take on how grim &amp; unfulfilling working at an amusement park is, even one run by fairies. /a/ just talks this way about every single show. even the ones with almost all male casts  reinhardt is my waifu     tfw this will be the last general thread of amaburi   rip sweet prince     no it just attracted obsessive creeps  I should know I made like half the threads since december      Hi, welcome new friend.      There will probably be another one once the subs come out. With twice more shitposting.   Which element would you ario?   Water or Air Hands down      Thank the maker, but even so I wish for the day that we'll get S2.   I know it's tiny and impossible but even so, I must.        Water's waterballoons on one side, Air's airbags on the other.     sento    Air.  Hot retards are my fetish      Choosing any Amagirl other than Sento.   Ease on the shit taste, Anon.     Subs fucking when?  Where can I watch the OVA?   http://jkanime.net/amagi-brilliant-<wbr>park-ova/ova/</wbr>    If I took it off, would you die?    Thank you very much, my friend. It looks like it's magic hour one last time!   how can sento be so perfect    Sento cosplaying the fairies  Wait what the fuck how did I miss this. OVA? Specials?     Those hips are perfection on her frame     You live under a rock or something? It's been days.     How about in English?    there's been threads all month     streaming      Wait, it has Spanish subs. Fuck. I can't find it anywhere with English subs.      This post    Just marathoned this show overnight  Pleasantly surprised with how little the MC had to use his power, was initially put off by the code geass power-bestowing. Concept of restoring a dead amusement park was surprisingly fun, and characters were quirky without being fucking annoying. Could've done without the school substitution episode and every scene with Latifah was pretty awful, but overall much better than I expected.        Why is politely expressing your gratitude disgusting?      every scene with Latifah was pretty awful     Fire.  Air is worst girl in the entire show         in existence   ftfy       Air   Not Heart      The show that .gif is from was also terrible and Hibiki is ruined by the war between Hetrofags and /u/. Kyoani really lost their way.     Could've done without the school substitution episode  Are you kidding me that was like the peak of the series for comedy.     What a tub of lard     Kyoani really lost their way  DON'T     THIS      Chu2.      Kill la Kill and Ninja Slayer made me hate Trigger so much. Just like Punchline made me hate Mappa. Why'd Gainex have to split to make this these cancer a reality ?     Kyoani really lost their way.  implying     Because you have shit taste and clearly didn't watch any post 2000 Gainax anime with an open mind      Jesus, those child bearing hips.    I Did watch the garbage they put out and it seemed like a half assed attempt at riding on their gainex affliacted coattails. Kill la kill was Female Gurren Laggan and Punchline was a trying so hard to mix Fooly Cooly ridiculous with Gunbuster/Daibuster heaviness.   Until they realize they ain't gainex no more they're nothing but a bunch of loudmouths.       Kyoani really lost their way   Yes, After Gay Swimming.       Fire Sento=Water Sento&gt;Air Sento&gt;Earth Sento   Damn. Best office lady in anime of ALL TIME.      not enjoying Tiramie being a playboy     But the school episode was the best one.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227950   no Gatcha subs   no Amagi subs   no Yahari subs  time to quit anime      Name one good Amaburi doujin. protip:  you can't     When can I insert my dick?    That one with the ecstasy heart sleeve fruit was good    The show was okay.   You've missed all the discussion about the plot and other things back few months ago when it was still airing. There's actually not much thing to discuss anymore until they finished the translation for 2nd vol. of the LN and so on.    Punchline was a trying so hard to mix Fooly Cooly ridiculous with Gunbuster/Daibuster heaviness.   Just because some staff from Trigger also work in that show doesn't mean that the story is some kind of abomination created between those two shows from Gainax. The story and everything in PL actually accord well with the games that the creator has been doing for years.  Trigger is also not fully consisted from former Gainax members.  You're shitting up the thread with your pathetic taste and horrible opinion, please go away.               of ALL TIME  I really wish I had a picture of Kanie doing a mic drop right about now.     The Yahiro Pochi one.     was initially put off by the code geass power-bestowing.  That is a pretty forgettable element of the series.     I dont remember this...    that's because it wasn't on tv     not being able to hammer nails with your dick     did anyone found a movie from the real porn actress?    Eh? Was it a BD special or something? An OVA?    OVA/"unaired episode" which came with the last BD. No subs yet.    Yes, Volume 7 just came out along with an OVA     Those Water Sento's  Good lord     fan subbing is dead    It came with the last BD? But then why so late?   Now I know what I'll fap to tonight.  Thanks /a/. You always come through when it matters.     The last BD came out this week.     http://exhentai.org/g/770269/b93319<wbr>42ab/  All I can say is   inverted nipples     </wbr>      Spoiler   My man of good taste      Holy shit dat Chun Li victory glee     Is that in english? I found it on nhentai but only in chinese and jap.  Fuck the panda.       A shame they are so rare in manga.    Nope, I don't think there's an english one at the moment.         A shame indeed. Such is life, my invertabro  Oh lord, that sounded better in my head       vertabro sounds like a pokemon.     Is it weird that I found Koboli the sexiest amongst the fairies?    24 hours   still no subs   its all over   well considering theres only four of them theres a 25% chance you would         Nope. Straight dark hair, a reserved personality, dem bloomers, the lewd bellybutton, secret fetishes, it's all there    Since there is already a spanish subs why don't any anon start translating it to english?    That's how duwang happened anon.    Nah, it's mostly just the spats. Most people who subscribe to this fetish are ass-men with excellent tastes. They don't necessarily HAVE to be together, but when they are, it's a nice bonus.  Personally I prefer spats with ribbed sweaters or better yet, Ribbed sweaters with nothing but underwear or nude underneath.       A little bit, Anon.     Mmmmmm     Ribbed sweater with pantyhose my man.  Imagine Muse in that. Or Sento.      secret fetishes  She clearly shows her desire to see men having buttsex.     Fuck off, it was just as good as this fanservice shit.    Nah man. Kneesocks.    maybe she has more lewd thoughts in her little head that she'll never reveal     Kneesocks  My fucking dark skinned brother     The yahiro pochi one and the paizuri only one, also the cowsuzu.     I'm still in crisis over this, help.     The main problem with those doujins is that mcfaggot always try to take them out, like, why? What's the point if they are not inverted anymore? Fapping is suffering.   I just want to plough Salama.  Is that too much to ask for, Nigel?     Dammit Latifa is too cute on this    yes   she's mine      this OVA   Kyonai has gained redemption after the shitphonium blunder. Amagi S2 when?     She's pretty uninterested with lewd surrounding her daily. I think she's just a plain old fujo.    You just have a better taste than any other fairyfags, anon. Good for you.    to be fair salama and muse don't seem to show interest either   Is Amagi the most sexualized KA show ever? I think its their only one where lewd took over cute, there is also sex jokes overload and a bunch of explicitly pervy characters    Yeah, there's nothing worse than a good looking doujin with an inverted nipple tag only for them to last like 4-5 pages.  http://exhentai.org/g/824885/b41a36<wbr>0c6f/  Link related, they always, ALWAYS, do this infuriating shit  </wbr>        Yes, it's overlewded.     This fag doesn't even want to watch yaoi and get a handy from his waifujo    FUCK YOU KYOANI WHEN IT'S A SMALL GIRL YOU HAVE TO PAN QUICK AS FUCK AND DON'T GIVE US A SERVICE SHOT? FUCK OFF.       overlewded   No such thing.       But they were explicitly like that in the first place. I actually enjoy the mascots acting like a bunch of old guys. Made it kinda real but not really.     Stutter-chan isn't for lewd, Anon.   So much Sento service.   Fuck off and Kyoani too. She is not for lewd, Latifa also is not for lewd, because they are shitty small girls right? God damn it, did this OVA magnify all their moralfaggotry Jesus Christ. Even the camera angles always took care not to show her crotch or ass, this was beyond ridiculous. Also gotta make sure not to show even a slightly lewd shot of Latifa! Fuck these faggots.        Sorry I was staring at her buttcheeks     No fucking buttcheeks of worth, we can hardly make out anything on contrary to the other girls in this segment who both got their service shots and details. Holy fuck KyoAni confirmed for the hugest "can't sexualize small girls" studio all over again.     Latifa's plenty lewd.    Fuck off.    You're grouchy when she isn't sexualized and you're grouchy when she is. You're a hard person to please, Anon.     and you're grouchy when she is  But she wasn't ever, you funny kid.  Even in her micro bikini scene it was made sure she covers her crotch are and only get shown in awkward angles.      Does every store sell that poster or is that a pre order bonus?    the crotch isn't the sexy part, it's the vagina bones and they were visible     We hardly saw anything in her close up shot compared to all the lewd poses and details of the others. Really, they made sure to make her as tame as possible while still adapting that part, since fans were anticipating it. However everything else was cut from her, along with her only bath scene, and this OVA is a proof of what KyoAni thinks of her. Not even a cute butt shot. Nothing. But you can just compare Chuujou's wrestling outfit scenes to others in terms of details too. This OVA made my blood boil more than anything in recent history.        You are one angry pedophile.    Yes, I am.     Cops called, fucko. Enjoy your jailtime     You seem upset. You should really cool down      hey doll    I can't. I guess satisfied big girl fans won't ever understand. They are being served what they like on silver plate.       Are you a lolicon?    not even 2 minutes in and already there's melodramatic bullshit going on  I'm trying to give Kyoto drones the benefit of the doubt by watching this straight through, but so far it's goddamn boring. Literally WHAT is the appeal?   Masturbation material.   2 minutes in   boring  Kill yourself.    You sound pretty dumb, just stick to Gintama or your haremshit. You won't have to use your brain.   I didn't say I stopped there, you illiterate monkey.    2 minutes in   WHAT is the appeal?  This is bait.    nice blog  subscribed     any present-day KyoAni series   requiring brainpower  The fact you're serious shows how far the fanbase has fallen, holy shit.      If you don't enjoy it, then simply don't watch it. Don't force yourself through it just to sperg out about it here.    kyoanusfags blogging  what a surprise.    I was trying to avoid asking when it picks up, because the 3 episode rule be damned, I feel I should have been grabbed by now.    not liking literally the greatest anime ever made     Friendly reminder that it's only blogging when it's written negatively about a show you like.     Actually it's the other way around idiot    No, it's blogging when you create a whole thread to voice your shitty opinion when there are already threads for the show    Correct me if I'm wrong, but in japanese isn't talking of peeling skin extremely lewd?    The entire board is blogging, outside of generals.  You can fuck off with your meme now.      When it first started a ton of people here shared your impression. It stopped around episode 3. Whether it's because the show got more interesting or because they dropped it I don't know.  I for one found it engaging right from the first episode.   sage because there's already a hibike thread         Nice     implying they were any different in the past     It doesn't pick up till episode 9, and gets boring again after episode 11.    There was FMP! so, sure.     everyone else is doing it!  Not an excuse. Don't make shitty threads when there's already shitty Hibike threads for you to post in      Why are you forcing yourself to watch an unpopular show by FujoAni? At least pick something which actually sells and not just their loyal landwhales buy. And never expect quality from them.     FMP required even less brain to be honest, being a shounen which reeked off teen catering.     FMP   requiring brainpower       popularity == quality     Don't worry, that pass fast. Keep watching.     sales  People actually look at those? I thought those threads were just a small but dedicated circlejerk.

So when a person feels it, is it not real?]   pls go out with me, anon      Did you call me?   You are stupid. Love being a certain mixture of chemicals in the brain means that love is very much real. It may be something different from what some people think it is, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Seriously, stop being fucking retarded in a thread not even meant for you.    this is a level of comfy i have never experienced before   the original yuri-bait  Gaiden's almost over, will you avoid the spoilers this next week?  Naruto looks so based and grown up. I love it.    It was just another of Tobirama's mistakes.  Tobirama was the CNN of his time  Uchiha murder circles create child soldiers in Konoha   Is evil hereditary? Shocking report on Uchiha genetics   The militarization of police traced to Uchiha rebellion         Dadruto has been one of the best parts of the Gaiden. Looking forward to seeing more of him in the movie.      he's just gonna ignore Salad     People are trying to defend Boruto but won't even tell me why they think he's stronger. Like what can make him strong enough to beat a Uzumaki/Uchiha descendant. Boruto is just a plain Uzumaki just like Pain was.   Reminder that Super Strength is not genetic.  Reminder that the narrative theme of this Gaiden is that ideas/familial love trumps genetic heritage  Reminder that Sakura a shit        Because he is the one with genius and talent plus power.    Salad has her own father she can fistbump with.    They better give us some Hinata to make up with no appearance in the gaiden    Be careful what you wish for.    It wasn't just Tobirama's fault, when you're born in a world full of wars with an ability like the sharingan you know for sure what's going to be your fate.   threadly reaminder that Tobirama's nightmare isn't over yet   shieeeet where is all this coming from? I've been missing a lot of shit recently    Tell me how Sarada will counter Raiton+Rasengan (rasenkunai?).     Not all Uchihas and Uzumakis are uber tier like Nardo and Sauce are. We still have to see how Kishi  or someone else  will handle them, because in a series like Nurutu plot convenience is king.     Sarada is a Uzumaki and Uchiha. She has more growth potential than Bort.      Sarada is an Uchiha and an Haruno.   If Salad creates enough shadow clones through her daddy issues, could she awaken MS by massacring her self-images?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qyo<wbr>nn5Vbg7s</wbr>  [ ] New trailer     She is a woman so whatever potential she could have had has been dwarfed.   fuck off    Boruto is basically Sasuke+Naruto   Sarada is mini-Sakura   People still arguing who's strongest       Uzumakis have a pretty good statistic, 4 out of 5 shown characters were good, only Karin was shit tier Uchiha... not so much     With a good hotdogging.    What a little shit, hope he gets fucked up also  not even 15 years old and already doing susanoo rasengan  Fucks sake      I want Sarada meet her (biological) mom in the last chapter    You want reasons?  1. Sarada's only talent so is Sakura's super bitch punch, an ability notoriously associated with mediocre fighters like Sakura, Shizune and Tsunade (who is arguably the weakest Hokage and sannin and probably lost more fights than she won). Because the author is obsessed with parallels and thinks it's a good thing to make the kids just mini versions of one of their parents with all the same abilities it seems like Sarada is being prepped to be a second Sakura, which isn't a good thing considering Sakura had literally no noteworthy abilities besides being able to punch the ground heal, making her one of the most ineffective fighters  2. There's still a good chance that Kishimoto will pull out of making Sarada an Uzumaki/Uchiha hybrid. One chapter is all he needs to explain away any of the evidence in the most haphazard way he can so Sakura/Sasuke's fangirls don't have to kill themselves. If this is the case, her potential is almost entirely destroyed.  3. While she does have the Sharingan, Sasuke only unlocked all his abilities by going through a dark and depressing period of his life. If Kishimoto is the type to spare Sarada from harm by saying "Nope. Sakura was her birth mommy all along, he will most definitely spare her from too much further stress needed to awaken further stages of the Sharingan.  4. She's a woman and woman normally get the short-end of the stick in this manga. Think about it. Was Karin any greater of a fighter than Sakura in spite of being an Uzumaki?              *Sarada is a Haruno and Uchiha  FTFY     I would commit suicide if Sasuke was my dad.    yeah, all the uchihas shown were some shit-tier irrelevant jobbers, like Sasuke, Itachi, Madara, Obito, Shisui etc.     Aren't there still like 6 or 7 chapters left?   mama Hinata why so sad :'(     Haruno  Literally who.     Isn't Karin fucking dead and buried somewhere?    where is the uncensored version where he is holding a gun in this shot?    Then you're fucking retarded  having a sharingan   genjutsuing hot chicks and drowning in pussy       Next week is the last chapter. Might have some extra pages.     your dad does not give one fuck   he enjoys you having so many friends   never asks why the girls follow you   he just understands         7 good named uchihas   the rest of the shown clan was mediocre at best from what is seen  That's still a bad statistic compared to 4/5     What is this expression trying to say, /a/?     What's the point of drowning in pussy with no dad to be proud of you?    That he finally found  Boruto's  spare.     coup d'etat incoming      I'll be back to fuck shit up some more soon.     shit that makes me sad, I actually like this spinoff a lot   Why are the new kids so /fa/?   Anon you don't know how statistics work  Having a sample size of 5 is not going to give you a strong undeniable conclusion. For all you know, those 5 Uzumakis were the only ones relevant to the plot because all the rest were trash      she's still alive in the different hideout    i just need him to interact with his daughter at least once  it's already ridiculous that he only has a photo of bolt on his desk      Why does he sound like luffy     tfw when Uchiha were never once at the top  Senju/Uzumaki all day.     Every Uchiha who managed to awaken the Sahringan became at least a jonin. Also we literally know 5 Uzumakis: -Nagato, talentless ninja blessed by Madara with the Rinnegan -Kushina, just an housewife -Karin, jobber -Mito, jobber -Naruto, blessed with the Kyuubi and Asura's tranasmigrant        Gaiden could run as long as Naruto. Why is kinshi being a fucking lazy sloth? Doesn't he want money?    Enhanced.      I'm holding my final judgement. One chapter is all Kishimoto needs to screw everything up.  At this point, Sarada could go from being a most interesting and dynamic character to complete trash depending on how Kishi chooses to resolve her character arc.        so /fa/   black and red everywhere   Kishi has to make it seem like there's been some sort of progression in the Ninja world I guess.       It was a joke. Of course you can't use 5 people to come to the conclusion that the Uzumaki were an uber clan  Though some people here seem to do just that       dat pose  what a slut      -Karin, jobber   Karin isn't a jobber cause she was never really a fighter to begin with.       Man that girl kicks ass.   She's pretty hot too.      Suigetsu was pretty based in this series.   you will never hang around Orochimaru's Totally-Not-A-Supervillain Base, running DNA tests for random children because you have nothing better to do with your time       Uchiha shits should never smile.    I can't believe I'm saying it but I don't really want it to end. I actually want to see more of this generation. Maybe a capable assistant can pick this up and make something out of it.    Itachi and Obito killed the entire clan. Most uchihas where shit tier     -Nagato, talentless ninja blessed by Madara with the Rinnegan  kek  -Kushina, just an housewife   -Mito, jobber  Both were able to control the Kyuubi, a being more or less made of hatred their whole life  Also, the whole Uchiha clan was massacred by two guys. Can't have been that great          Does he even know he has a daughter?   Do they have the same VA or something?         Madara has the cutest smile    I agree, I'm really hype about this new series and it's a shame if it doesn't continue in some form    We all know how this story goes.  She turns into mini-Suckera cunt who is tsundere for Boruto.      almost over  Wait what? Its ending so soon? Literally THE sequel to Naruto isn't even about his Son who only showed his face for like 3 panels its just about Sakura being a cuck and the Uchiha's being the worst fucking bloodline in history? What a fucking joke.       It's no shame to be slightly autistic   I bet Gaiden would go on if somehow Kishi finds a way for Madara to be able to create an offspring who carries his ideals.     If Sarada isn't Karin's, I don't think I'd want it to continue if Kishimoto is only going to create false conflicts.      I dont follow naruto and this sequel but  Gaiden's almost over  Did you mean the entire sequel or is this just a prologue to the sequel or something?      Sarada already hogged all of Naruto's father/daughter time    What is there to like about the gaiden? It's just a retarded soap opera. Maybe it would be better if it actually focused on the other kids instead of just Sarada.     Same. I'm actually kinda hype for the Boruto movie and Kishi delivering on his promise that it will be his best work in the Naruto franchise. Trailer looks fucking GOAT.     Sarada  Gotta work on the ideals part tho     Sarada has Sakura's exact same part 2 outfit only with Sasuke's edgy arm warmers.      The gaiden is only one volume/ten chapters  After this, there's just the Boruto Movie.  After the Boruto movie, it's anyone's guess what happens next. Maybe Kishi will take a twenty year break and come back to it like Toriyama.           Literally THE sequel to Naruto isn't even about his Son who only showed his face for like 3 panels its just about Sakura being a cuck and the Uchiha's being the worst fucking bloodline in history?   Literally THE sequel to Naruto  That's the Burrito movie coming out in August.      Itachi did it for the sake of the Konoha village, please respect him. He cares Konoha more than his clan. he's a true Shinobi.    The only reason Naruto is good with Sarada is because he has a daughter of his own. I bet he spoils Himawari like crazy.    The gaiden's purpose is to provide buildup for the Boruto movie which is the main attraction.     Himawari grows up to be Tsunade 2.0  oh boy     The gaiden was always meant to be a mini series who's purpose was to lead into the Boruto movie. Kishimoto decided that the mini series should have nothing to do with the thing it was supposed to lead into for whatever reason.    You realize that Boruto is facing Shikadai and not Sarada in the exam final right?  And do you remember that the final exam was composed of a tournament fight? Unless Boruto and Shikadai was the very last fight (and being the winner doesn't gurantee the ascension to Chuunin), nothing was supposed to be set in stone.  In any case, aliens interrumpted the exam.         It's just a retarded soap opera  Exactly.     and Kishi delivering on his promise that it will be his best work in the Naruto franchise  You and I know both know that could go either way.         Then why doesn't he go to his birthday party, have a picture of her on his desk or has acknowledged her existence?       In any case, aliens interrumpted the exam.  We'll never know how based Shikadai is?      Himawari grows up to be Tsunade 2.0   loud    drunk   emotional   compulsive gambler   massive tatas   finds some fine young girl to be her bitch            Yes, but at least if the DNA Test is legit and the whole issue around Karin isn't a misunderstanding, the actual plot doesn't feel like a waste of time and Sarada stands out as the most mature and developed character so far of the new generation. Horrible abilities can be forgiven if she's actually a good character.  Making her Cuckura's doesn't just give her bad combat potential, it also kind of ruins her whole character arc for this story.       because himawari is kishimoto's kryptonite    female    looks like hinata    daughter    sister          Bort probably kicked his ass with pic related, whatever it is.    sasuke searches for some huge threat for 12 years   ignores his "family" that entire time   he never finds the threat and they show up on their own to kill Naruto  Smart.      Watch as this scene turns out to be Dadruto's ghost.    It'd be pretty pointless to go on this whole journey only to end up where we were at the start. Kishi's not the best writer, but even I have trouble believing he'd set up, pursue, and then destroy a lesson in which his story hinged upon in no less than 10 chapters. It took a long time for the whole "hard work overcoming genius" shtick to fall apart.    How much are you betting that there are at least another 4 babby mommas among the villages?      why would you even save such a quality crop?    Shut up, anon. Dadruto is going to live.     Gee, Burrito! How come Kishi lets you have two dads?     Oh Jesus you might be right.     daughter   now that you mention, has there been any positive father/daughter relationships in naruto? other than naruto and sarada       implying Kishi would shoot his cashcow  As long as the dosh flows in, he will never kill his beloved protagonist      is that the fucking Chidori   and it's hurtling toward my son   fuck you Sasuke   fuck you   should have had your edgy ass executed while we still had the chance          implying he'll kill off the main character of one of the most beloved franchises in the entire world   If he does without any revive shit, then he'll have the biggest balls of any shonen mangaka I've ever seen.      No, he's just this movie's "kidnapped princess"  Sasuke, Boruto and the kages head on a mission to rescue his ass.      haku and zabuza    still no byakugan on burrido   himawari when?   Kishi you fucking twat         I can't write anything greater than this   cause I killed the main character        Kishi said he thinks of Nurudu's family as his own, so I doubt he'd ever kill him off.  Then again Kishi says a lot of things that turn out to not be true.      Hashirama and Tsuna, somewhat   Friendly reminder that there's still one more chapter to go and pic related is still a thing.     Why would Boruto have the byakugan? Neither Naruto nor Sasuke have it    This is why it's weird for Kishi to make Salad a girl. Why didn't he just give Sauce a son?    What do you mean? Sauce has his Burrito.     the right eye will have sharingan. The left eye will have Byakugan! (laughing)   (laughing)   &gt;&gt;(LAUGHING)   KISHI YOU CHEEKY CUNT        He wants the Uchiha name gone    Sakura fighting with Sai in shippuden was pretty based. Too bad after that arc everybody turned into wizards with unlimited mana and magic tricks     Kishi really wants to make Bort the official SN kid   but he has to give Sauce a child or else people will bitch   I know I'll make it a girl    I'll even say she wants to be Hokage as a joke  And that is how Salad was born.        He wishes Bolt was his son.     yfw he starts having Itachi flashbacks while hanging out with Burrito       He seems motivated.     "Boruto... have you ever gone boar hunting before?"      I'll even say she wants to be Hokage as a joke   there was this jump festa (2010 I think?) where somebody asked Kishi if Sakura could be Hokage and his answer was "no way"       4.  yeah but there are plenty of women who are powerful in their own right.  Temari's a Jonin and gave Shikamaru a run for his money during the exams. Plus, she got promoted earlier than he did.       Not any of significance.  No important female friendships either.      It'd be pretty pointless to go on this whole journey only to end up where we were at the start.   The funny thing is, I could see the people who defend this saying that because Sarada now wants to be Hokage, whereas she didn't even see the point of being a ninja before, that that is enough character growth, but then if that was the only amount of character growth Sarada was going to experience, why not write a simpler story? Why use an overly-complicated plot centered around a certain character only for them to make a moderate change that could have happened in a simpler manner?   If all you wanted was for her to decide she wants to be Hokage or find meaning in being a ninja, you could have avoided all this drama around her mother which has nothing to do with that decision.   Kishi's not the best writer, but even I have trouble believing he'd set up, pursue, and then destroy a lesson in which his story hinged upon in no less than 10 chapters.   Again, the Kishimoto Internet Defense Force would probably say that the lesson isn't destroyed, but even if it isn't "destroyed" it would remain seriously undermined by the narrative. When Sarada found out that Sakura wasn't her "real mother" and had been lied to her whole life, she was ready to disown both of her parents until Naruto told her that it doesn't matter and what matters is what she feels. Even if it doesn't matter to Sarada because she remains happy either way, it matters to the readers because the readers are being preached to and aren't given an example to as to the validity of Kishimoto's philosophy. It's too easy for someone who thinks that Sarada's relationship with Sakura doesn't go beyond genes to just write everything off.  It would also leave open a question as to how much Sarada really learned because she isn't compelled to learn anything from what Naruto said in order to have her old life back.               implying 'Dai doesn't just dodge all the chidori hits, guide Burrito into the shade and then use the circular shape of the arena to haxmode his shadow possession.   He'll then give up the fight because his chakra's too low to continue.  Then the big shit happens immediately after.  Calling it here.           No important female friendships either  There was Sakura and Ino but the Pink bitch threw it all away because they both crushed on the same edgy piece of cardboard. Even though Ino still considers the flower she gave Sakura her favorite possession.   I'll never understand why people like her.        but then if that was the only amount of character growth Sarada was going to experience, why not write a simpler story? Why use an overly-complicated plot centered around a certain character only for them to make a moderate change that could have happened in a simpler manner?  This.      tfw I got promoted to Chuunin while your edgy genin ass cried like a bitch in the clinic     Kishi has a really fucked up portrayal of human relations.     but then if that was the only amount of character growth Sarada was going to experience, why not write a simpler story?   pretty much  you could even keep the daddy issues by having sasuke be an absent father who only comes home one or two times a year         Implying that's not how some humans act.  Just look at the actual Sakurafags.       ino's favourite thing is the flower she gave to sakura   pinkshit is truly the worst         This. If Kishi wanted Salad to learn a lesson about what it means to be a ninja, then he should have just focused on Sauce from the start. Why the fuck would Sakura even be a part of this if she was always Salad's biological mother?   Of course to the SScucks this doesn't matter because they think the Gaiden is some love letter to their asinine ship. Speaking of which, thanks to the Gaiden, SS is ruined beyond repair regardless of whether or not Salad is a cuckbabby.          remember that move Kakashi taught me and and told me never to use unless I intend to kill someone   and that the only reason he taught me said move was because I was fighting a literal psychopathic monster who got his rocks off by killing people   how about I teach you that so you can use it on your good friend Shikadai         Does she even have any redeeming traits?   I want to believe in Orochi Experiment end    So Sasuke is in the village   Got another assignment   So soon, what is it this time?   You know, secret ninja stuff        She raised a future hokage by herself    Unfortunately Sarada ambitions will end up like Kushinas.     she learns she's a cuckbabby and that her father is a deadbeat manwhore   she learns that she's Pink Shit's kid and her entire quest was not only pointless but she's basically destined to be a jobber bitch like her   she learns that she's some kind of horrible abomination created by a pedophile snake tranny in his creepy basement   she decides that she doesn't want to know her real origin and her entire journey and trauma was pointless   in every end she ends up the weakest link of Bort's squad  Every end for Salad is a bad end.         They look so fluffy and well cared for.     you could even keep the daddy issues by having sasuke be an absent father who only comes home one or two times a year   If the only goals Kishi was going for was Sarada to want to be Hokage and to admire Naruto, there are plenty of ways to do this without involving any question about Sarada's real mother. Maybe Sarada already looked up to Naruto a lot, given that her own dad wasn't around and then finally gets to see him in action. Maybe she meets Sasuke and just finds him cold and impersonal towards her while Naruto is friendly. Maybe in addition to these, Sarada confides in Naruto her doubts about being a ninja meaning anything and he gives her a pep-talk that really motivates her. You don't need a soap opera to do this and if really wanted drama, having Sarada just hate her dad for never being there is more than enough, you don't need to make her think she's his side chick's child let alone drag it out for this long just to make it not mean anything.  At this point, if you went back on making Karin the real mother, you reduce the entire plot of Sarada trying to find the "truth" to just a convenient set of circumstances that motivated Sarada to finally put some effort in trying to meet her dad whom she's never known because had she not discovered the picture, she would have never followed Naruto, and you also put the character through trials for no other reason than to watch them suffer for nothing. While it is true misunderstandings do happen in real life, they don't really make for an entertaining read as much as scandal and tragedy. That's why people still watch Maury.         she actually becomes the Hokage this time but only because the other guy wasn't interested   she inspires confidence in her village by giving Burrito head under the desk while he sits in the chair   every Gokage meeting is punctuated by him popping in with Hiraishin for a quickie       Only in one of those she doesn't gain extra tomoes   That poster though   ino and her dad, i think    Please no. I actually like Naruto as a grown man     &gt;she actually becomes the Hokage this time but only because the other guy wasn't interested  It's the same with tsunade. She only got the job because Jiraiya said no.     There's a Kishimoto internet defense force?     only relevant characters shown   subtle spoilers for who will face who in the Chuunin Exams   shows off the main villain and what he can do  I always liked the hand-drawn posters the most. Kishi's not the best artist, but it shows he's invested in the story he's about to tell, regardless of whether it's good or bad.          She only got the job because Jiraiya said no  Unless Bort miraculously wants to be the Hokage by the end of the movie, which he better fucking not. He has no reason to want the position. Let Salad have it. It'll be the only significant accomplishment of her life.     Anyone know what it says? Also I like the whole carpentry theme we've got going on for Bort's posters and shit.    Boruto wearing Sauce's scratched headband and Naruto's Part 1 outfit in the climax(?) of the film   OKAY WE GET IT FUCK      If Kishi wanted Salad to learn a lesson about what it means to be a ninja, then he should have just focused on Sauce from the start.   I'm a little confused as well as to what Sasuke's purpose here is. Is the point for Sarada to realize how honorable her dad is and how much he cares for Sarada and Sakura? Or is it for her to realize that her dad's a straight deadbeat? Or is it for her to realize that while her dad isn't so bad, she has no emotional connection to him at all?  Cause the way it seems, Sarada in the end is going to end up liking Sasuke. In which case, I'd have to wonder what the point is of her admiration for Naruto.  Her admiration of Naruto makes a lot of sense if she sees him as a father figure to substitute for her rather mediocre dad. And it would also make sense if she saw that Naruto is insanely more powerful and skilled than her dad. But so far, Naruto hasn't done anything spectacular and if Sarada ultimately forgives Sasuke and recognizes that he's a good dad in spite of his absence, I have to wonder why Sarada would look up to Naruto more than Sasuke. Heck, even if Sakura is the mom, you could try to make up for it by applying that lesson to Sasuke whom Sarada has no relationship with, but that doesn't seem to be the direction they're going with this. It looks more and more like Sarada is going to end up recognizing that Naruto was right about how cool Sasuke is by the end.    hypothetically speaking.               tfw Sasuke teaching Bolt the Chidori which kills Shikidai causes Shikamaru to go dark and become the greatest, most maniacally efficient villain in the Narutoverse      Unless Bort miraculously wants to be the Hokage by the end of the movie   I'm gonna become the Hokage 'ttebasa!   just kidding       Wait, who's the girl above Chouji's kid and next to Shikadai?    Salad still thinks spending time with her papa is shannaro (whatever the fuck that means), yet at the same time she expresses her butthurt at seeing Sauce spend so much time with Bort instead of her.    That's Inojin. Also, that's a dude    What if he becomes in Jiraiya 2.0, kabuki shit and all    NO NO  YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POTTERY IT'S PERFECT THEY RHYME  DON'T YOU SEE HOW THEY RHYME   That said it's actually pretty appropriate for him to be wearing those two articles of clothing. Still cheesy as fuck though.             I want to fuck that girl      implying he wouldn't take the lazy route and just ask Temari to make another one     That is Inojin, and he is the prettiest girl.    Why is she so perfect    Well, he did say he wanted his first born to be a girl.    I get what it's for, I'm saying the POTTERY is kind of ridiculous.  I think we would get the message if he just did his Chidorasengan but this is hammering it in there       not having a #YeaSorry      he becomes the new Jiraya   Himawari becomes the new Tsunade     Salad  becomes the new Orochimaru      Hiden already establishing him dropping the lazy persona and becoming "the adult".  I guess serving as the Chancellor for three different Hokages and assassinating an s-rank criminal while Naruto slurps down ramen and fucks Hinata does that to a guy.  He's morphing into quite the edgelord in the novels.        Himawari is voiced by Saori Hayami   OH WHAT THE FUCK?  Now I'm super mad she won't get much screentime       He will chase after mitsuki's ass running all across the all that dimensions. Another Jiraiya Orochimaru route, then Salad will be the next Hokage.   I fucking hope so.      I bet the headband is going to be a reminder for Bort not to be a shit to his dad and respect what he went through to get where he was. Like spending three years of his life saving Sauce's edgy ass, dying twice, and losing an arm in the process.     I want to feel that feel.   although realisticly it leads to Bolt dying in pain at the hands of Temari   Wow... it would shatter them. Thoroughly. Their thing was being the slightly more sane and practical ones, putting up with a lot of shit, and they sank everything into making a family together. A decade later, one of the people of the kind they resolved to endure kills their son with an assassiantion jutsu during a rank exam because Daddy Doesn't Love Him Enough.          My daughter's has awoken the Sharingan!   My twelve years of Cigarette mission is worth it!   Now I only need to teach her how to kill this kid.        girl  Inojin is a trap.     Boruto dies, Himawari becomes a drunk virgin riddled with gambling debts and Sarada gets the happiest ending?    The prettiest Yamanakan.   Who hype for Ninja Storm 4?    she learns that she's Pink Shit's kid and her entire quest was not only pointless but she's basically destined to be a jobber bitch like her   Learning that would be literally what she intended to find out,      What's the point of drowning in pussy if your dad is proud of you?    Himawari confirmed for Stoic character.     takes the backseat in the Gaiden   DiD in movie   Naruto's been reduced to a supporting char.       It'd also bring that Sasuke Retrieval Arc back full circle. Shikamaru nearly kills himself trying to protect his team AND rescue Sasuke, pulls out a fucking batman gambit only for this guy to return a decade later and teach his best friend's son an assassination Jutsu that kills his only child.  I wouldn't put it past Kishi. He's been pulling the rug out from Shikamaru's life on a pretty regular basis. This might be the crowning moment.      Except that in here, Sarada wants to be Hokage because of Naruto, not despite Boruto.    Too bad he still makes Inojin look like a corpse.  He looked actually alright in the anime character sheet and in the trailer       Sarada wants to be Hokage because of Naruto  Tsunade only took the job because of naruto in a way too.  I always felt like tsunade and naruto's relationship was a missed opportunity. Thought she could have been more motherlike to him, since that was set up so well.       Honestly, the only bad thing we know about him is his backstory (dismembering opponents in pitfighting and enjoying it). We never see him engage in anything really heinous. At least Jugo hulked out once. He even put head on the chopping block by standing between Taka and a Tailed Beast Bomb. AND TANKED THE HIT.       I'd hit it.     Karin has those chakra chains    It looks bretty gud. The games have always been the best way to experience Nurudu.     She was conceived by a Sai possessed by Ino's shintenshin technique.      I always felt like tsunade and naruto's relationship was a missed opportunity  Don't worry, anon. The doujins covered that. Thoroughly.     Does that mean Ino fucked herself?       it's already ridiculous that he only has a photo of bolt on his desk  What?     The only naruto doujin I ever liked was the one with shizune and nardo.      Kishi's coloring is the right one  ink gangbang m8     Does that mean Naruto is finished forever once Gaiden finishes?      equating guts with greatness  (Brazilian) (American) ? pick one      #Iamnotmadara     Yeah just like Dragonball finished 1995.    Studio Pierott will never get rid of Naruto. It's literally the only anime they have    It's one of the pictures you see in that multi-photo frame in The Last. The one with toddler Bort and his dad making the peace sign.    Nigga I can't see shit.    10/10   NC - NO CONCUSSION    It could all work out if the Gaiden ends with her being more of a tsundere towards Sasuke, but really, the only thing that seems to be holding her back from having a better opinion of Sasuke is the issue with Karin and Sakura.  Notice that she doesn't even call him "dad" in her mind during this scene now that she "knows" what he did. But given that immediately after she wondered what his relationship with Sakura really was to him we saw Sasuke show some concern for Sakura's well being, I wonder if Kishi won't just make the whole DNA/maternity issue a misunderstanding for no other reason than to save Sasuke's image.      How do you pronounce "seventh-sama"? nana-sama?   Probably something like nandaime-sama    nanadaime-sama    I thought the gaiden was supposed to be about fixing Sasuke's relationship with his daughter.  Instead it's taken a backseat in favor of Sarada's relationships with Naruto and Sakura. Sasuke is still just some stranger that they keep telling her how awesome he is.       , I wonder if Kishi won't just make the whole DNA/maternity issue a misunderstanding for no other reason than to save Sasuke's image.    Why would he do that when he could pull a Jotaro and call it a year. The difference is that Sasuke actually seems to give shits about Sakura.       Which explain this    Her relationship with him might be left strained after all.    Damn, it's not as catchy as its predecessors.           I don't know about kanji reading rules but Shichidaime-sama sounds cooler.     Her relationship with him might be left strained after all.   Does Kishi even plan on fixing it when the movie is shaping up to be all about Boruto having two daddies?      But Boruto is Sasuke and Naruto's son. They have no other children.    Maybe they actually have an ongoing bet on who can neglect his daughter the most.         I thought the gaiden was supposed to be about fixing Sasuke's relationship with his daughter.   Instead it's taken a backseat in favor of Sarada's relationships with Naruto and Sakura.    Right now, there's only two things that hold Sarada back from having a high opinion of Sasuke since he's already outshone Naruto:   his absence for 12 years   his apparent affair with Karin, resulting in her birth   Given the way things have been going, it feels like the creator wants Sarada to have the highest opinion of Sasuke possible under the circumstances, seeing as how he even went so far to nerf Naruto just to make Sasuke look badass and Chouchou can't stop "envying Sarada." If Kishi can excuse or remove one of these obstacles to Sarada admiring her father, I don't see why he wouldn't at this point. He might even make Sarada understand that the mission was so important that the village had to come first before her.     I don't watch Jojo, so maybe you could explain that to me.                   tfw it's this scene when it's shown  Goddammit Bort.         why does kishi and sp hate himawari so much? isn't she based on his daughter?       Doesn't hate her that much apparently since we'll see her in the movie.    Nips don't kiss their children or their parents.    She's just there so Naruto can have a bigger family.  It's clear that Sarada is Kishi's daughterfu.      No. 15 years from now they will have Naruto Kai and then they'll have constant Naruto movies until we get Naruto Super. The first new Naruto anime in 18 years.     It's clear that Sarada is Kishi's daughterfu   makes Bolt the child of POTTERY and gives Salad nothing but shit and suffering    daughterfu        kishimoto doesn't surprise me, he's shit at writing daughter/sisters and Himawari seems to exist to give Hinata something to do while Burrito becomes the sasunaru kid  SP doing this  to a mini Hinata is weird, though. Specially considering how popular she is with so little screentime.        his absence for 12 years   Muh missions, muh loyalty to Hokage who you love so much, etc. etc.   his apparent affair with Karin, resulting in her birth   You don't actually believe this, do you? Next chapter is the explanation for the wacky misunderstandings.          Could be worse. Sakura could be your mom    I'm not mad. It just means that other people will have to realize the potential that Kishi wasted.    So....shouldn't he have some kind of eye hax? He is Hinata's spawn after all...    Byakugan is for losers.     &gt;daughterfu     Considering how Boruto is ignored in the gaiden I'm not surprised Himawari hasn't showed up. I guess it should be a good think Himawari and Hinata aren't caught up in this soap opera shit. Even Naruto feels out of place in the gaiden.       She       gives Salad nothing but shit and suffering   Suffering it's actually the way Kishi shows which characters he cares about, he thrives off cheap drama. Look at Shikamaru, Kishi started to take a like to him and what did he do? He killed off his sensei and then his dad.  Don't think that Bort will escape it. His dad gets kidnapped by ayyliens, his last words to him are probably the "I rather have no father than a parent like you" and Sauce has to save him from getting horribly killed in an explosion.   daughterfu  The Naruto/Sarada relationship is the closest and most we've seen to a father/daughter relationship in the entire manga.           See:        There's supposed be some special announcement after the movie or something, so maybe they're just going to go straight to doing a Boruto anime    You don't actually believe this, do you?   I think you misunderstood me. I was saying that it's unlikely that Kishimoto won't remove those obstacles which is preventing Sarada from having the highest opinion of Sasuke possible. Which is why it's very likely Kishi will make the matter with Karin a misunderstanding, unless he thinks he can justify it in such a way that makes Sasuke look "not so bad" in the end.  Really, our problem is that we've been assuming this whole time that Sarada does have a strained relationship with her dad in the movie, but nothing has come out to confirm this except for an ambiguous "spending time with papa is super shannaro" statement which may or may not be in the movie. Heck, according to the plot summary, Boruto searches for Sasuke after hearing Sarada say her papa was Naruto's "only rival," which may imply that it's Sarada's commending her father that compels Boruto to want to be trained by him. As much as I don't like it, this is probably going to end with Sarada saying "Papa was the coolest guy"             That's probably Sasuke's susanoo, man.     Before Tobirama's death the whole Uchiha clan was a thing, and now there are only two.   He would be happy.      It is. The pottery thing is how he's wearing Naruto's jacket and Sasuke's scratched headband.  Boruto is meant to be a combination of Naruto and Sasuke, giving him the byakugan would get in the way of that.       That's exactly what's going to happen. It's not even a joke.      Don't forget that every couple of years, there will be a new movie or OVA      he doesn't know that Salad is going to have her face carved onto the same rock as him     there will be a new movie or OVA  This would be okay.          Chidori   Nah, Sasuke went full Raikiri when teaching Burrito.      Looks like the Bolt movie is getting an Australian release. This means we might get another Aussie camrip.    what about an Aussie dub?    Shit, nigga, we got clearer images of that wall poster. That means we might even get translations of the character profiles.   And here's the second. Gives us a better look at Himawari's design, too.    that's one manly dadruto    Is the villain a chick or a trap?    the uzumaki clan was so fear they where wipe out and there allies didn't help cuz they knew how powerful they where      Schwarzenegger neck      Voiced by Hisoka so trap.   What if Tobirama and Donquixote Doflamingo and Aizen teamed up to kill all peasants, Uchiha, and shinigami?  lol this is the woman who voices naruto in english   That would be absolutely mind blowing, the fallout from the fanbase would be cataclysmic to say the least   and to my surprise, the idea saddens me because love it or hate it, anyone who watched this show or read it when they were young teens like I did cant help but feel its somewhat ingrained in their appreciation of anime &amp; manga       Every time an Uchiha smiles, something terrible happens.   Next chapter confirmed for drama.         slowpoke.jpg      can you awake the byakugan or as soon as your born you have it     everybody knows that      he  where is the proof      Crikey Nazza, howa we gonna deal with all these sharing-cunts   fackin malty-shadoh clown jitsu mate, no worries       Sasuke, Boruto and the kages head on a mission to rescue his ass   no Salad       More like   Just don't fall in love with him Shikadai   Why would I do that mom?

For research purposes, ballistic gelatin is considered comparable to human flesh, and the experiment thus supported the viability of this form of torture, not its historicity. In her memoir "Hakka Soul", the Chinese poet and author Woon-Ping Chin[3] mentions the "bamboo torture" as one of those tortures the locals believed the Japanese performed on prisoners.[4]   holy shit thats fucked up    </wbr>      Eh, I've heard worse.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scap<wbr>hism</wbr>       I don't want it to be over.

With the warm/gentle personality inherited from her mother, she thinks of her brother.       mom is Hinata   Nurudu clone for a brother   voiced by Sayori   Himawari's gonna fuck Bort, isn't she?        With the warm/gentle personality inherited from her mother, she thinks of her brother   she thinks of her brother  Gee, I wonder why.       Does that mean Sarada will be Karin's love child?     In this context, it's probably more like "loves" her brother.     why don't they just do an entire series with the kid characters? Gaiden was already 100x better than Naruto has been for the last 5 years.      Who is the silver haired faggot on the right?      Are you retarded enough to think he won't get anything and that salad will be the star of the show? He comes from hamura's and haga's line. He WILL be getting some bullshit later on.     Mitsuki.      It says that Himawari likes her brother a lot      Be careful what you wish for anon.     That's because seals fuck everyone up in this manga. Which is why kishi limits them.     Regular blue eyes?     it's probably more like "loves" her brother   nii-san   remember that time when you destroyed by birthday cake   that really turned me on        Source?    look here and Same mag pics we have been seeing for the past few days.      What is the true identity of his respected parent/parents...?   respected parent/parents from another village   Well Oro isn't widely respected and Toneri fucked off to the moon, haven't seen The Last yet but I assume since he's the villain he's not exactly respected by many people either, who created this kid?        yellow eyes   stretching powers   I don't think he's Toneri's       He will have a mental link with Kaguya. For some odd reason, they will get along very well, and Boruto will affectionately call her Rabbit Granny.     He's got some freaky stretching powers and pale-ass skin with yellow eyes.  Kabuto after he ate Orochimaru and became the Dragon Sage?      Official or not, I really hate those colors.      Bolt /ss/ with Kaguya  I didn't know how badly I wanted this until now.       Oh come on we all know it's a oro/kabuto related experiment      shannaro  http://www.urbandictionary.com/defi<wbr>ne.php?term=Shannaro</wbr>      I don't think he's Toneri's  I'm just going by hair and what other anons have guessed.      Oh come on we all know it's a oro/kabuto related experiment  But how the hell are Kabuto and Oro well respected? Was Mitsuki adopted by sane people?      They parents could be agents being used to pretend Mitsuki is theirs. I mean fucking kabuto infiltrated Konoha for such a long time. It's not that hard to make up backgrounds.     I wasn't too keen on them either, but they're really beginning to grow on me.  I may have to eventually draw some, since there probably won't be any.      Wait, is Mitsuki the villain? He seemed cool from his showing in Gaiden.     means two completely opposite things  Was that supposed to help?    I may have to eventually draw some  Are you any good?         What if it's Mizuki?    I'm the one who drew  so I guess you can be the judge of that.      Is that drawing yours? Really nice.    Not bad. If you drew lewds I'd fap.      Hinata's personality   doomed to be irrelevant       Nobody likes Mizuki     Found a better quality/bigger version.    More like doomed to suck her brother's cock.      ALL ABOARD TO BROCON TRAIN!       Kabuto/Orochimaru's-new-body body-birth.    IM JUST A GIRL WHO CAN'T SAY NO  What do you think of the last episode of Plastic Memories?  I thought it aired tomorrow  is this some sort of troll/meme op?  I'm going to miss her.  ;_;   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227312  Shit, I've only seen the first episode, but from what I've heard if I skip straight to the end I won't be missing anything.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227312   Isla got an upgrade, She's has big tits now, she literally sucked Tsukasa's dick and Michiru confessed. A lot happened.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227312   there are some really tender and sad moments, honestly worth watching all the way through.   a new show hasn't made me feel this way in a while      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227312  The show changed genre completely, it's pretty much a mix of Psycho Pass with Blade Runner now. Final boss battle tomorrow, shit's going to be great.    That board of directors hit some SEELE level shit, and Isla's gonna go full fucking ragemode.    What you talking about? Last episode aired last sunday, we got a big party for Isla, and Tsukasa walking Isla gently to home, perfect ending.    Can't wait.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227312  wow, mods are fucking tools. are you aware of how many hotpockets you earned for deleting this post? you know it's zero right?   Is someone going to stream it? I think it airs around 1 AM EST tomorrow, but can't into Nip schedules.   12:30   I know Isla is going to die, but my heart will go on.   10/10 song related   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SIY<wbr>vkGJHr08</wbr>  [ ]      I am going to have to wait for the subs, so I won't be on /a/ all day tomorrow. I know that the show has to end with Isla's death, but..........  I don't wany it to   Good night  And remember   /ai/ idle activities   will always be with you~   First for Lala.  Who ever could be the one getting married?   I want Rinne and the RAW to come back.   Fuck EVERYTHING   Pretty sure they have more than one job    just play the ova in the background while reading it then.    It's not gay if the dick is feminine    Just watched episode one of that trash. How high do I have to be to enjoy it?    Are you talking about aqua teen hunger force or futabu? </blockquote>]
