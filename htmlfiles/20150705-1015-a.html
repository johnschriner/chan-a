This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.   The sequel was just as good as the first one <br>based trigger</br>  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's one of those magical times where /a/ actually agreed on something</br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

I love you Akko.<br>I love you so much. <br>You are so beautiful and perfect.<br><br>I LOVE YOU!</br></br></br></br>  Why is this not a 12 episode anime?<br> YOSHINARI COME ON.</br>  <br>I was only replying with the same logic he used.<br><br>If he wants us to tolerate anime with fanservice without telling people to go to /e/ then he has to tolerate anime without fanservice without telling people to go to /co/.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying that she doesn't use her poison to rape you </br></br>  <br>Sucy does the raping.</br>  <br> while you're facefucking her  <br> lucy shoves a mushroom up your butt causing you to lose strength  <br> she rapes you instead  <br>   you can't ejaculate due to the mushroom and you can only feel pain from the absence of your ejaculation </br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how her face switched from surprise to that smile</br>  <br>Do you honestly think that people don't like LWA2 just because it didn't have fanservice?</br>  <br>You need to pay the Jews shekel is magic.</br>  I wasn't liking the first half very much but the second half was so freaking great I forgave all of it's faults.  <br>You need 12 kickstarters then</br>  <br>Oh what then, it's not Japanese enough for you? It's not even western enough. It's more of a mix of both.<br>We like Japanese anime and manga, but we aren't all wapanese here, you know.</br></br>  I'm actually a bit upset now because Mandy was so great and now we'll never see more of her.  <br>People not liking LWA2 is a strong overreaction that is always mandatory when a large amount of people are hyped over something.<br><br>They will whine and whine about it because they can't stand people being happy.<br><br>This has happened with every show that generated large amounts of hype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lets make TWELVE kickstarters! Lets do it!</br></br>  <br>I cannot comprehend people not liking it</br>   For the second time a "big bad" gets BTFO by Shiny Chariot move <br><br>How was Shiny Chariot not OP as fuck? No one seems to respect her, but she had the most OP as fuck wand, constantly took on huge "ancient" bullshit.<br><br>The power levels in this anime make no fucking sense.</br></br></br></br>   you try to fuck a slavshit <br> she farts and kills your boner </br>  <br>Yes anon. You should be able to buy it.</br>  <br>Because they didn't backed up the kickstarter</br>  <br>SUCY Best magical Egyptian dancer.</br>  <br>But that is Atleir.<br><br>Did you think the potions and food and bombs you make in Atleir can't be used in combat?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the Mahou community excommunicated her and pulled a pic-related.<br><br>Didn't work out as well as it hoped, though.</br></br></br>  <br>She put on flashy shows for Muggles which was frowned upon by the witching community. Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>akko becomes the new shiny chariot that's it</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana always</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality. It would break everyones budget.</br></br></br>  The wallpaper makes a lot more sense now.  http://i.imgur.com/XfS1BQH.jpg  <br>You can.<br>But that would probably take 5-10 years to finish.</br></br>  <br><br>Just use JDownloader.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

So where's the website where I can jerk over my name if I backed just 20 american euros?  <br>These designs are extremely anime-like; you won't find a western cartoon that looks like this unless it's directly influenced by anime. It's not "westaboo" it's just traditional anime aesthetics executed well.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure. Now Akko sounds like Hime to me rather than Hime sounding like Akko.<br><br>I guess that's what happens when a show runs for an entire year VS. a single OVA</br></br>  <br> so he at least knows that he's not white <br>Animators only do line art, you know?</br></br>  Team Sushio  <br>This works because it's short and there was large pause between 1 and 2.<br>If this ends up normal 12+ anime series you'll get your usual load of QUALITY, cliches, filler and inane shit.</br></br>  <br>Do we need more though?

KLK was disappointing.  even Rocky had a montage  Good subs when?  <br> I wonder what Trigger's next TV series will be like <br>Nowhere to go but up</br></br>  noice   Constantze's wand turning into a drill   <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-02/trigger-teases-new-pro<wbr>ject-and-new-inferno-cop-little-wit<wbr>ch-academia-crossover-short/.90008<br><br> Studio Trigger teased a new project, its fourth major project, at its Anime Expo panel on Thursday. It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it. Either that or you're a shill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me /a/, LWA e-mail is apparently spam.</br>  <br>Tattun and at least Wakabayashi went to Pixar for multiple days before the con.<br><br>They almost certainly are doing something for them.</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop will never get a 1080p BD release with smooth 60FPS animation </br>   <br> I cannot refute this claim because I know nothing about what LWA originates from! <br>Thanks for continuously showing how little you know about anime.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it. The manga ran in a seinen magazine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty slow for a sticky if you ask me.</br>  <br> I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one. <br>You don't seem to get my point. When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy. It's like watching something you've already seen, and know all the lines to.

If you were unfamiliar with that kind of stuff then I understand you missing it, but it's super Japanese and really blatant.</br>  There are VIDEOGAMES made out of MAGIC in this world, I need me some of that.  <br> then the teacher did the whole Japanese live stage thing where she calls things out for the audience. <br>no. that's not what she did. She was pretending that it was all part of the show.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's a bit dissapointing. At least it's still totally something you could show to your daughter.</br>  <br><br> trigger never release sheet music. <br><br>I guess I could transcribe it myself i guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what he said.</br>  <br>You are a pretentious poser. You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing. Everything was going good till that pile of shit showed up. Trigger better leave this series as a girl only cast.

It's not like we get a sticky for other anime announcements? Some serious favoritism going on here.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

I NEED doujins of Amanda and Diana sandwiching Akko with their futa cocks.  <br>Dress up like a trap, go for cakes and they'll be all over you.</br>  <br>Only thing LWA related is the first one from Trigger's site.</br>  <br>I half expected the giant to step on him before getting defeated.</br>  <br> tfw 5' exactly <br><br>If you're skinny, maybe you could make a decent trap.</br></br></br>  <br>Dolphin porn, you say?</br>  <br> Not liking both <br>Poor guy.</br></br>  <br> Tried to put poison mushrooms in everything <br>This includes Akko.</br></br>  So we're getting a released ost, aren't we?  <br>It's better if they're eiffel towering her.</br>  <br>I've always wondered, is there a quick definition for this "hands symbolizing lewd genital interaction" thing?<br><br>I need more reaction images of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully. Michiru Oshima's soundtracks make me a very happy person.</br>    <br>It's one or the other, there is no middle ground.</br>  <br> eiffel towering </br>  <br>Doggy style plus irrumation.<br>That way they're not all smooshed together and you can actually see all their perfect bodies.</br></br>  Next episode when?  <br>2 years</br>  <br>Spitroasting, and you high five each other in the middle.<br>And then it looks like the Eiffel tower. Or an "A".</br></br>  <br>It's called spitroasting</br>   tfw gg is dead and all I have is 720p horribleshit   <br>What a shitty name</br>  <br> high five each other in the middle <br>It has to be making out for a double futa scene.</br></br>  <br>Dancing and delinquent funtimes with amanda.</br>  <br><br><br>My fellow fun-sized bros</br></br></br>  <br> mfw 6'5" <br>GAIJIN SMASH!</br></br>    <br>Thw way she spoke was similar to the black speech of mordor.</br>  <br>My giant brother from another mother.  6'7'' here. </br>  <br>Lanklet pls go, nobody is intimidated by a beanpole.</br>  Anyone have the concept art of the characters?  <br>trigger doesn't care about staying on-model, they'll freely deform anything to enhance movement. it's wonderful and rare to see.</br>  Thread is making everything lag. See you fags later.  Why does every single sticky inevitably turn into rampant shitposting about height?  I didn't even know this was a thing that was happening today. i am filled with joy and smiles.  <br>Because you're short.</br>  <br>Sucy didn't have that much detailed animation, she was just long.</br>  How the fuck has no one made and posted a webm of Amanda's heist scene to get the golden egg during her intro?  just finished it<br>people weren't joking about the fat ass being completely useless, what a fucking waste of a character</br>  <br>On it.</br>  Any working DL links?  Lotte is such a bestgrill it ain't even funny. I want become her husband and comfort her every day.  <br>She definitely needed a more triumphant moment to prove herself than jumping on the catapult</br>  <br>Better than gay lewd shit.</br>  <br> useless <br> is crucial counterweight of the catapult which is a vital part in the chain of events that lead to victory <br><br> honestly though, yeah, she was kind of a comic relief char </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127593511 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> comic relief  <br>that implies she did anything funny ever</br></br>  Sucy wants to get you high!  I want to sniff Lotte's butthole.  <br>And this is a bad thing because?<br>It's an accurate representation of a fat person.</br></br>  What makes these characters so likable? Even discounting the quality of the animation, there's no amazing hook to it or anything, but somehow it's all just... really nice.  <br>This.<br> <br>I'm just so jaded from watching almost every kickstarter fail or be huge scams that even this one project that looked like a miracle spooked me. <br><br>Fuck, I want to give trigger money.</br></br></br></br></br>  Sound: http://webm.host/816d2/vid.webm<br>I'll do the others as well.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127593511 <br> XD <br>Half-way there brah</br></br>  <br>well maybe not comic relief in the strictest sense<br><br>but kind of a character to freshen up a bit in story intensive scenes by showing her eating? i dunno she didn't feel that out of place for me</br></br></br>  <br> tonight /u/ </br>  <br>You just know she's the drug lord of the academy.</br>  Should of been more explosive like the first one.  <br>I want to intercrural or hotdog loli-Fujiko in her catsuit.</br>  <br>I like them because they're expressive. And when I say expressive, I mean the animators actually had the time and money to spend on moving their faces unlike in most anime where the faces are pretty much frozen, changing only once or twice in a closeup.</br>  <br>wait a sec...<br><br>is that rarity next to the clock??</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't notice her :3 face when I first watched it</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>she didn't feel forced I agree, but seriously she did absolutely nothing</br>  <br>The thing is Trigger = Startoons.<br><br>Trigger is not Telecom.</br></br></br>  I WANT TO RUB MY NOSE AGAINST AKKO'S BUTTHOLE  <br>Constanze.<br>Sound: http://webm.host/4a425/vid.webm</br></br>  <br>there was a twilight in the first one, remember?<br><br>it's just a slight  tip of the hat  towards the show</br></br></br>  <br>well if i think about it<br><br>she DID hand out candy at the parade which helped bringing the little kids around<br><br>nothing she as a character would have been absolutely needed for, but at least it's something eh?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She really was the star of this.</br>  <br>Her grumpiness pleases my german heart</br>  <br> HANDA <br>Hmm, I wonder who could have animated this scene...</br></br>  <br> her goggles are over her hat <br> she is watching through her hat and then through her goggles  <br><br>i didn't notice that when watching, cool</br></br></br></br>  <br>He slaved the fireworks in the first one</br>  <br> Sign says "Braunschbank" <br> VO says "Braunschbank" <br> Subs say "Braunschweig" <br><br>What is this?</br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't back it, but where can I by the BD?  <br>*slaved over<br><br>also did this bit</br></br></br>  <br>She was the cutest<br>My favorite by far.</br></br>    Saw the premier. So glad I backed this.  <br>Braunschweig is a popular/known city here in germany maybe the TLs just didn't look/listen to close and assumed the name they had heard somewhere?</br>  <br><br>Jasmineka.<br>Sound: http://www.webm.host/4e78e/vid.webm<wbr><br>Loop1: http://webm.host/b536d/vid.webm<br>Loop2: http://webm.host/2c28b/vid.webm</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I cannot blame a single person for not backing it.<br><br>Kickstarter has been such a scam machine for the past few years that anything that gets put up deserves nothing but contempt until it can prove itself otherwise. <br><br>I didn't even back that thing Iga was doing, and I trust him to at least make something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Braunschweig is popular <br>Please don't tell lies to the clapistanis</br></br>  <br>My best guess is that they were thinking of this guy.</br>  Wait whats going on im confused are they doing a full anime of this? i really liked the short ep they did.  <br>She's literally the worst character.</br>  <br>They'll make one if the second OVA is popular enough</br>  <br>Are you aware of the concept of an OVA? <br>I'm serious, because it's been so long since studios tried to seriously make a stand-alone OVA that you could very well not know about it.</br></br>  <br>you know i typed popular at first and thought to myself 'nah, POPULAR will upset someone' so i changed it to 'known' but kept the popular<br><br>and still here we are.<br>you have to admit it's one of the bigger ones at least</br></br></br></br>  <br> full anime <br>LWA 2, 50 minutes long got released. Don't ask for links, read the thread.</br></br>  Amanda = Diana &gt; Akko &gt; Sushi &gt; Lotte &gt; Machine girl &gt; Fatty  Where can I go if I want to give money for this right now? <br>Downloading this feels sour.</br>  <br>most useless character</br>  <br>EVERY GIRL IS BEST GIRL YOU PLEB<br><br>It's gonna be at least another month till pre-orders I think. This was just for the backers.</br></br></br>  <br>Amanda &gt; Constanze &gt; Sucy &gt; Diana &gt; Lotte &gt; Akko &gt; Jasmineka</br>  <br>Some girls are a little more best than others though.</br>  <br>Almost<br>Amanda &gt; Diana &gt; Constanze &gt; Sucy &gt; Akko &gt; Lotte &gt; Jasmineka</br></br>  <br> I'll be back </br>  <br>I can't choose, man. I want them all. Even the background girls.</br>  <br>Diana &gt; *<br><br>The others are a bunch of filthy philistines barely worth condensing into an asterisk when compared to a goddess such as Diana.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you a little girl?</br>   Technomagic <br> Pew Pew <br><br>You can't top this</br></br></br>  <br>B R O W N <br>R<br>O<br>W<br>N<br><br>W I T C H E S<br>I<br>T<br>C<br>H<br>E<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how do we make it popular?</br>  Witches are supposed to have orgies.<br><br>Why aren't they having orgies?</br></br>  <br>she dresses like gary oak</br>  anyone else who gets reminded of  trixie  by diana?  <br>this isn't blue drop</br>  [gg] or horriblesubs guys or are they the same?  <br>Constanze = BAMF.</br>  <br>What does that gun even do though?</br>  <br>I'd pay a fiver to fuck top right in a favela.</br>  At the LWA panel they said they want to do a third part but they don't want to Kickstart again.  <br>post yfw when amanda is just  sunset shimmer  with a haircut</br>  <br>w-was it a bad experience for them...?</br>  <br>but I have a good paying job now, I can drop 1000$ if i wanted now.</br>  <br>No, they said it would feel like cheating.<br><br>Yoshinari says that he is going to polish/fix LWA2 even more for the BD/theatrical run.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah that too<br><br>but i got the diana vibe even in the first one</br></br></br>  <br>Semi-automatic magic missile.</br>  <br> semi <br>do you know what that means? that thing is full auto if i ever saw one</br></br>  <br>While I wouldn't mind another KS but you got to applaud them to not KS if they don't need it.<br><br>If they need it then well... I'm game.</br></br></br>  Why is he so based?  <br> Yoshinari says that he is going to polish/fix LWA2 even more for the BD/theatrical run. <br>Oh nice, I was wondering about that. There are some shots where the animation doesn't always seem quite finished, but I wouldn't want to be presumptuous enough to assume I can tell whether or not they are intentionally that way...</br></br>  I really loved it, even more than the first one. This should be a series, too bad it's impossible.  <br>Why aren't all those kids dead?</br>  <br>It's not shooting by itself now is it?</br>  <br>They weren't really trying to hurt them and their power was nerfed anyway because they weren't near the Sorcerer's Stone.</br>  <br>Semi-auto = 1 trigger pull, 1 shot. Auto = hold down trigger, gun keeps shooting shot after shot.</br>  <br>I love him</br>  <br>Makes sense, no need to go to the well too many times. I just hope it does well in Japan. If that happens, they can secure funding easy.<br><br>Also, figures when?</br></br></br>  Lotte &gt; Amanda &gt; Sucy &gt; Diana &gt; Akko &gt; Constanze &gt; Jasmineka  <br>Automatic = magic gun shoots by itself.</br>  <br>Suzy and Amanda best girls by far. But I have to admit Lotte climbed up several positions in my ranking.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but I know nothing of guns.<br> Semi-auto = 1 trigger pull, 1 shot. <br>What's "auto" about that, let alone "semi-auto"?</br></br></br>  <br> Lotte first <br>No one can have taste this shit.</br></br>    <br> Redwood likes LWA <br><br>I thought you were a bad guy. Did /a/ lie to me?</br></br></br>  <br>By firing that shot in a semi auto gun, the gun itself will ready the next shot rather than you having to re cock it</br>  <br>littlest witch best witch</br>  <br>Automatic is synonymous with self-loading. Semi-auto is a weird workaround to divide automatics into burst-fire and not.</br>  <br> gets put up deserves nothing but contempt until it can prove itself otherwise. <br>Which Trigger did with the first LWA. Without it, I wouldn't had backed them two years ago. Imagine trying to justify backing LWA if Trigger only work up to that point was Inferno Cop.</br></br>  Was it worth the weight?  <br>I see, that makes sense.</br>  Thank you all backers in this thread.<br><br>I wasnt able to this time due to funds but enjoyed it thanks to your efforts! <br>i'll make sure to contribute for the next one if it gets a kickstarter again.</br></br></br>   Akko - Harry Potter <br> Lotte - Ron <br> Sucy - Hermoine <br> Amanda - Cho <br> Constanze -  <br> Jasminka -  <br> Diana - Draco  <br> Hanna and Barbara - The Draco fat twins <br><br>everything is better as little girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>semi auto reloads semi automatically<br>you pull the trigger and it shoots, you pull again and it has reloaded and shoots one bullet again<br><br>full auto means the reloading cycle will work and therefor the gun will shoot until you let the trigger go or it runs out of ammo<br><br>no auto means you have to manually reload after every shot, bolt action etc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  That was really fucking good, based Trigger.  Magitek witch best witch  <br>You can't base kickstarter trust off of people's past works.<br><br>Look at Schafer and Inafune. I would have considered them complete gold even a few months before their kickstarter, but to give them money on a pseudo-investment that I had no rights to? I didn't trust them that much.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>THIS<br><br> You will never be at her side, transforming the world into magic steampunk. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Manual = 1 trigger pull, 1 shot, 1 reload, 1 trigger pull, 1 shot, 1 reolad, etc<br><br>Semi-Auto = 1 trigger pull, 1 shot, 1 trigger pull, 1 shot, etc, 1 reload, etc<br><br>Full Auto: 1 trigger hold, X amount of shots, 1 reload, 1 trigger hold, X amount of shots, 1 reload, etc</br></br></br></br></br>  I hope this gets a dub.  <br>I hope you fuck off.</br>  <br>Lotte is much more like Hermione than Sucy. She's the voice of reason of the trio</br>  <br> "First you grab the ball sack and then gently work your way up the shaft..." </br>  <br>I hope this gets a good dub.</br>  <br>So what was this about technology being banned again?</br>    <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127593511 <br>This sticky has stayed up too long<br>Mods please delete</br></br></br></br>   all these webm-able scenes <br><br>hnnng</br></br>   mfw finally got around to watching LWA1 and this back-to-back. <br>Now I finally understand all the saving anime memes.</br>  <br><br>I'm not remotely a fan of dubs but if this wholesome show were to get a dub and young kids would be more likely to watch it and see that 2D animation needn't be ugly sterile Flash shit, then I'm all for it.</br></br>   Sticky for this shit.  <br><br>/a/ literally has the worst taste,</br></br>  <br>I can't even open this thread, my computer commits sudoku immediately. All I can do is reply to the one comment that is visible in the sticky. And I agree wholeheartedly with you.</br>  <br>Are you using Google Chrome? If so, don't.</br>  <br>Download more ram.</br>  fantasy mecha spinoff with constanze when?  <br><br>Ha, the sign was too small!</br></br>  <br>I suppose but with Trigger, more or less (I'm not entirely sure) the entire team is still around and the first LWA was still fresh. It isn't like we're digging through a decade or two of previous works.<br><br>I also got to argue that making a game is harder*. The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction. The only things up in the air is the animation quality and the story. <br><br>*I'm not excusing Schafer and Inafune though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My chrome doesn't have any trouble with this thread.</br>  <br>My PC has 8gb of ram and I have some trouble with Chrome in this thread.</br>  <br>What would the "spent casings" be for magic?</br>  You guys will surely back Studio 4¬∫C's notMegaman Legends anime right?<br>https://www.kickstarter.com/project<wbr>s/mightyno9/red-ash-magicicada-by-s<wbr>tudio4c</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br><br><br>Why would you use anything but Firefox?</br></br></br></br>  <br>We planetside nao</br>  <br>I don't have problems either, maybe you have a bad cpu or connection.. or have you like 50 extension?</br>  <br>Maybe, but Firefox is fine so whatever.</br>  <br>Amanda is more like Ginny.</br>  <br>maybe antimatter, since it shoots out some form of energy (=matter)<br>would be dangerous though...<br><br>otherwise probably some throwaway piece that absorbs excess heat/energy</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>As far as kickstarter goes, it's probably also because you can only go back to that well so many times before it becomes impossible to raise any hype. <br><br>Probably best to reserve KS for their new unknown shows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Ask for 150k <br> Still makes Goal up to 2.5 Million </br></br>  DL link please?  <br>This was so good, holy shit!

Some compare him to Shakespeare (trust me, this isn't actually overselling, seeing as Shakespeare was kind of trashy all told) but I don't think their styles are terribly similar. Voltaire jabbers on a lot, is really blunt about a lot of things. and drips everything in satire. That's Nisio in a nutshell. Except Nisio is no fun, somehow it's all like shit in my mouth when I read his stuff or watch adaptations of his work.</br></br></br>  <br><br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>Gundam 0079<br>NGE<br>Blue Submarine No.6<br>Ideon <br>Utena</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Good taste anon</br></br>  <br>I just want to say that I really like the picture you posted.</br>  I'm not really surprised, when I think about it.<br>Titanic, Avatar, and Avengers are the top grossing movies of all time too.<br>Titanic and Avatar are still in the top 5 even when adjusting for inflation.<br><br>It's really the same concept here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dragon Ball GT outselling DBZ <br> Thinks these numbers are accurate at all </br></br>  <br><br><br>Samefag<br><br> Gundam <br> NGE <br> Fucking Ideon <br> good <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only like Eva.<br>I didn't know Monogatari sold so well.<br>Madoka is crap...</br></br></br>  <br><br>Monogatari sales are down to something like just under 30k a pop now,it's very realistic to expect that there are things that will sell better and considering it's only 2 discs a pop now it's going to be topping out at like 55K an entry soon. It really doesn't have any other sources of revenue either since the novels are done for now and it doesn't seem like any merchandise is coming out. Shaft is practise just clinging to it now because they're locked into finishing it on account of their promise and it's still their best selling series by a wide margin but it has nothing on the likes of Love Live or Gundam or possible even idolmaster and Utapri these days even just counting disc sales. It no longer even has the record for best selling volume since Love Live 2nd season. It took a while but franchise decay has set in and eventually Shaft will have no choice but to move on one way or another.</br></br>  <br> Thinking NGE is bad </br>  <br><br>Bandai Namco does report it's sales in annual 50 page reports that are broken for stock holders sake but that's about the only one I know cause they are huge public ally traded company.</br></br>    Why is Monogatari always the main target of shitposters? Is it because of this?  <br>why do people who feel like they have to defend their taste only post older anime? Is it because they are afraid their taste will get rekt if they post something made in the last 5-10 years?</br>  <br>They think it makes them seem mature and well read.</br>  <br>Damn, Tsukimonogatari sold that well?</br>  <br><br>I kind of noticed that. I didn't mind that Oshino guy much in the first season but everyone else is obnoxious as fuck. I'll give credit to that character designer Watanabe but I could say the same for everything he's worked on porn or not and he gets to join a myriad of other character designer from Japan in terms of drawing hot girls which is sometimes I swear the only area of the industry where I'm seeing any talent anymore. Japan cannot tell a story anymore typically but boy are they good at drawing attractive females.</br></br>  <br>  602,584 </br>  <br>I think it will still sell decently (over 20k at least) for a while. They will probably finish adapting the series before we see numbers bellow the 10k mark. They have to move on to something else eventually but not any time soon. And it's not like they can't survive off of normal 5-10k sales. They've been mostly getting those numbers with everything else that isn't Madoka or Bake. Hell SZS sells average but they made like 5 seasons, same with Hidamari.</br>  <br>Because people who have seen them typically like them since they went out of their way to watch an older show and don't want to shit on something they enjoyed and everyone else hasn't seen it and can't really comment on them without sounding retarded, though I suppose that doesn't stop some people from trying.</br>  <br>Joshiraku wasn't made by SHAFT</br>  <br><br>I'm just glad I'm the only one that can't stand the dialogue in that show. I swear it's part and parcel the reason that so many shows have such inane nonsensical dialogue now. The whole banter thing only ever really worked for me in Gintama. Isin dialogue is just insufferable to me in general though. Like I'm sorry but anything he's written it's just obnoxious, can't think of any other way to put it.</br></br>  <br>Well excuse me for being 30 and not into the hip and trendy stuff the kids watch these days. <br><br>There were shows in the last 10 years I really liked, but none could weasel their way into my top spots</br></br></br>  <br>I think they're good shows and am glad that it's also the general opinion of them even if people argue that that's one of the reasons they're shit.</br>  <br><br>He seems to want to write things that people will be polarized over. Has he ever written a story that isn't just some power fantasy featuring chick's with ridiculous god like powers with a humiliation angle that the protagonist eventually triumphs over via the power of talking them to death? It seems like every female character he writes is some sort of extreme with Medaka being the most obvious.</br></br>  What weirds me out about Madoka and Monogatari is that SHAFT did not do anything knew with either. They've always down weird visuals, head tilts, fun OPs/music, text slideshows and so on. I guess all they needed was cuter girls.  <br>Maybe I'm wrong, but that sounds more like "I don't like this because other people like it" than anything else.</br>  <br><br>Reminder that the last Gundam Unicorn volume actually outsold the Madoka movie overall and that's just one volume. Eva also does like 300K+ a movie.</br></br>  <br>Shame, maybe it would've actually been good.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>SDF Macross is better than 0079 or Ideon, Turn A is better than 0079, Utena is a self indulgent RoV, and Blue Submarine No.6? Really?</br>  <br>His writing style is very dependent on puns and various types of wordplay. The Japs love that more than anything. Not all of it can be translated properly.</br>  <br>Sorry, I was thinking in Kumeta, replace Joshiraku with Katteni kaizo</br>  and another yuru yuri thread         trips <br>great start!<br>also reminder that all girls are best girls</br></br>    Remember that all girls are best girls, and that there is no girl that can't eventually be made best under Namori's guiding tentacle.    <br>does mirakurun look just like chinatsu?<br>like they seem the same to me but something is different, it's just a feeling i got, like something is off</br></br>  <br> tentacle <br>I want Namori to guide me too.</br></br>      <br>different hair and eyes</br>    <br> eyes <br>fuck, never saw that<br>but the hair, isn't that pretty much the same?<br>actually i take that back looking at the images</br></br></br></br>    <br>Be careful anon, getting stung by a jellyfish is no joking matter.</br>    What's with the image dump? We've hit the image limit many times without one, so dumping for the sake of dumping seems pointless  <br>Best episode.</br>  Only two hours to go, anyone else expecting some fun?  will mirai be in this episode?  <br><br>You mean her? No. She's not in the line up of characters. In fact from what I hear, she's introduced MUCH later. Given that this is a J.C. Staff show, we'll probably see more than one cour/season.<br><br>BTW what is the name of this character?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody knows her name. I actually made a thread on /a/ asking her name, but it got deleted. Last I heard, she was going to be in the show.</br>  <br>No clue, since I can't read moon.<br>But if that is her, I have the first four LNs here and she doesn't appear on a single illustration. So I doubt we'll see her in the anime.<br><br>I believe her first appearance is, just like the cover says, in volume 8. Didn't see her on the other samples at all.</br></br></br></br>  I'll just go ahead and post everything I have.    what the fuck is this about?    <br>If no fun SJWs ran the world and 4chan fought back.</br>    <br>Who do you think runs 4chan?</br>  <br>Picked<br><br><br><br><br><br>UP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>juice</br>    OPs picture is erotic.          <br>yes please</br>                                    Neetball, right?

Main girl obviously will win.</br>  <br> no sound <br> internet too shit for the stream to be watchable <br>So was this as shit as the description sounded, or as unexpectedly good as the PV looked?</br></br></br>  <br>It was good.</br>  Man, I hope it keeps it up.<br><br>The only thing that can ruin shows like these is when they go too much into DRAMA.<br>Happened with Nourin, hopefully it won't happen here.</br></br></br>  Seitokai was better/10  <br>How the fuck is that vulgar?</br>  <br>I'm not sure it's possible to beat Seitokai at its own game, so that's okay.</br>  <br> If I pull that off, would she die?</br>  <br>Depends on the country.<br><br> In Japan this sign is called „Çª„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ (sekkusu) and means sex. </br></br></br>  ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wlvn0</wbr>  For those who couldn't watch it.<br><br> [Ohys-Raws] Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai - 01 (AT-X 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4 </br></br>  <br>MAFUYU<br>A<br>F<br>U<br>Y<br>U</br></br></br></br></br></br>  any groups subbing this?  <br>Hiryuu.</br>  Some stitching.

We have long waiting  Subs when?  Subs are out  Was it good?  why so ded  <br>I missed half of the stream but it seemed fun.

Or should I wait?</br>  How long until Hiryuu?  <br>There isn't that much to censor and AT-X is also censored.</br>    I've never seen an anime make an entire school cum.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was 7</br>  <br>What's the fourth?</br>  Why would they translate it as this?

I feel bad for the EOPs, pun based shows like this are difficult to translate at the best of times, having Funi shit is like shooting yourselves in the kneecaps first.</br>  <br>They announced that they're doing it.<br>Now we have to be patient.</br></br>  <br>What's it supposed to be?</br>  <br>Use polite speech while talking to your senior.</br>  Guess I'll wait then.  <br>MC talked in an overly familiar manner, gorilla man chastised him for not using polite speech with someone older than him.<br><br>Funi inserted "hell" for no reason as a "swear" word, and the whole fucking point of the show is that swear words are banned. It's like the stupidest choice ever.</br></br></br>  <br>If he was swearing he would be in jail, you retard.</br>  <br>Is this considered forbidden as well? What was the original?</br>  <br><br>Best. ****ing. Girl.</br></br>  <br>Are you deaf?</br>  <br>Anal was fine there. It was a pun revolving around shiri, the nip word for ass.</br>  <br>It wasn't really okay as it is not something he would say.</br>   the entire school coming <br>My fucking sides</br>  <br> like shooting yourselves in the kneecaps first. <br>Anything but raws is. EOPs are wasting their time.</br></br>  <br>Even though Funi made him say "ass" here.</br>  Best dad.  <br>You can use "anal" without it being a lewd word, dude. Shiri &gt; anal is fine if you're trying to preserve the meaning of the pun.<br><br><br>Yeah, they fuck it all up 2 seconds later, but what are you gonna do? Wait for fansubs? In this day and age? Enjoy waiting 2 weeks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not using raws is like shooting yourself in the head. Using funi is like kneecapping yourself beforehand, so you suffer even more in your final moments.</br>  <br>This "can" is enough for it to be a banned word. It is suppose to catch on words anyway, not context.</br>  <br> but what are you gonna do? Wait for fansubs? In this day and age? Enjoy waiting 2 weeks. <br>For this I actually will. Funi are ruining the whole viewing experience. I'll just avoid the threads so I don't get spoiled.</br></br>  What does it mean  <br>  No. She's not in the line up of characters. In fact from what I hear, she's introduced MUCH later. <br>Well fuck. That was the reason I was thinking of watching it.</br></br>  <br>That wouldn't make any sense, as there are tons of sentence fragments that can potentially sound lewd.<br><br>It's got to be running off brainwaves, are people going to go to jail every time they say ÈÄÄ„Åè?</br></br></br>  <br>my cake?</br>  What does she mean by "docking"?  <br>Her dirty jokes are so bad, or basically she already spouting very lewd words here, not even jokes anymore.</br>  <br>What part of the fucking anime did you not get?</br>  <br>I'm assuming you don't even have Rikaichan installed or something, ÈÄÄ„Åè doesn't mean butt or anything lewd, it means "to retreat". The system has only activated thus far when someone intentionally said a lewd word. "Peacock" would be fine, "cock" wouldn't. Unless you were talking about a rooster, I guess.<br><br>Or maybe it is just anything that sounds naughty, which would be hilarious, because it'd cripple Japan's vocabulary pool even further.</br></br></br>  <br>"melding" according to funi</br>  <br>IKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</br>  This reminds me of Noucome, an anime that looks shitty as fuck at first impressions but actually ends up being the best comedy of the season. Based JC Staff delivers  <br>Where are you going? You're not making any sense.</br>  Censored on Funi.  fello fello fello  <br> those fingerlike toes <br>burn it.</br></br>  <br>And this.<br><br>Everything else remained censored, RIP.</br></br></br>  <br>Can confirm, waiting for Hiryuu it is. I need my lewd handgestures.</br>  <br>That was the only one uncensored unfortunately.</br>  <br> Hiryuu <br><br>I hope you enjoy being 5 weeks behind.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>O-oh. Disregard  then.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. What I don't understand is, why AT-X left sex at this scene, but censored every fig sign which means the same thing in Japan.</br>  <br>This actually kind of show that better watching it raw.</br>  <br>Probably because it's in English.</br>  <br>English words I guess.<br><br><br>My chinese pornflicks tell me raw is always feels better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> is always feels better <br><br>Anon in charge of grammar.</br></br></br>  <br>AT-X has age warning on it like DxD and Okusama, so it should be uncensored if there is anything to censore.</br>  This is the stupidest show I've watched all day.  <br>Isn't it great?</br>  <br>AOTS</br>  Finally an anime about australia  Fucking Christ, Funi.<br>I may actually have to wait for better subs with this one.</br>  So what is this show like?<br><br>Funny/comedy basically?</br></br>  <br>I honestly liked the script, it didn't feel like Funi at all.</br>  <br>Solid AOTS contender. Comedy AOTY contender too. Provided you watch it raw or with good subs.</br>  OHOHOHO  <br>Funi snatched up anything and everything this season, there shit at uploading stuff, fuck, Gangsta isn't even on there yet and I downloaded it with hardcoded subs days ago.</br>  I wouldn't be surprised if those at the helm of the nation are the most immoral of all.  <br>Literally 12 year old humor.</br>  <br>Anon</br>   anime about how censorship is bad <br> awearwrods are censored <br><br>The fucking irony</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had those porncards when I was 12, looks like I was really missing out.</br>  <br>It's because you don't know any better.</br>  <br>Her name is Annie Braun.</br>  <br>Do you?</br>  <br>Tbh I think the censorship fits the atmosphere of the show better.</br>  <br>I know enough to tell when something is wrong but I don't know enough to be able to watch it raw. It's a bad situation to be in.</br>  <br><br>Very weird that they censored some things and uncensord other (or only these two) things.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait what? Did it air in twice? what happened here?</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Why is one censored an the other isnt? Which one actually aired in japan?</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>He probably mean the censored part.</br>  <br>Both versions aired in Japan but only AT-X aired it uncensored.</br>  <br>It aired in two TV channels? Weird</br>  <br>Are you new or something?</br>  <br>Things air in different stations throughout Japan, so some might censor things while other will not, like that one short show with the titty sucking and condom throwing this season.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to relax, take it easy, and celebrate FREEDOM<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>That happens anyway though...</br>  <br>Ah I see.

[3] These hand-embroidered vintage suzanis are infused with the character that only comes from everyday use. Perhaps created by a bride-to-be to show her devotion to her betrothed and then in lean times bartered away to a traveling Gypsy for money or household necessities pulled from the depths of his donkey cart. The story of each of these suzanis is as rich as their colors, as intricate as the designs that cover their surfaces. </br></br></wbr>  Reminder that you're useless if you don't get married and have kids.  <br>That's what is good<br><br>Don't you like hairs?</br></br></br>  <br>Best girls.</br>  <br>Which chapter is this face of enlightenment from?</br>  <br> ruined herself <br>More like improved herself.

But I like the idea of the show from a different person's point of view. I imagine they must have done it during FW/MH at some point though, eh?  <br><br>Yeah that's probably the one. <br><br>That image would make an interesting rage meme picture come to think of it.</br></br></br></br>   The series director, the one who did the mindbreak episode of Smile, is doing this week's episode <br><br>I'm so hyped it hurts.

Nomura is shit</br></br></br>  <br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1IZ0QKgCWzLfofu4vvSRgaV0DBk48aH4o6U<wbr>DUad7EAAY/edit<br><br>+<br><br>https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/id6<wbr>28266108</wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>It's a "pick your poison" kind of question.<br><br> Although I wouldn't mind a season that looked like Angel's Egg. </br></br></br></br>    Man, they've really pushed this WolfrunxSunny thing, haven't they. Their fight at midseason was awesome and with him coming after her personally this episode, it certainly sets up a ton of hype for a final battle in the finale arc.<br><br>And judging from the same kind of identical "I am Yayoi" intro to the next episode, I guess they're doing another round of spotlights with their power-ups. It's nice that they're not these super bland episodes, though.<br><br><br>I'm genuinely hoping that once I get to GoGo it'll make them all a little more interesting, because as of the end of Yes!5, the only distinct way of describing Rin is "insufferable redheaded bitch".<br><br><br>You wouldn't want to go puttind someone's eye out, after all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's like a cross between Peace and Love. I don't know if I can handle this.  <br>Fap on her.</br>  <br><br>I am not sure who either of them are.</br></br>  <br>GoGo! is inferior to Yes! 5 (little focus on the plot like Smile! but the episodes are boring unlike Smile!'s) so I doubt it'll improve your opinions of anyone except Bunbee and maybe Milk.</br>  <br>I disagree. It's just as good as Yes5 with Milk and the other new characters, the focus is the same, Urara's high animation episodes aren't just for her, they're shared amongst everyone in them, and they're still superior to Smile.</br>  <br>pls don't burn my daughteru</br>  <br>That looked really cheap, hopefully this is just a teaser and the real thing won't look so shoddy.</br>  So what is he (or she) playing anyway ?  Battle Yayoi. So weird.<br><br>Other than Yayoi, I'm not sure anyone really changes or develops, but it seems like they're still full characters all the same, and not just cardboard cutouts with personality traits stapled on.<br><br><br>That's a bit of a shame. At a glance it looked a lot sharper so I was hoping for a little better overall. Oh well.<br><br><br>I'd guess it was fan-made.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IYA IYA CURE FLORA FHTAGN</br>    <br> IOS <br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>20:47?

And guess what I get to hear EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY? "Oh hurr hurr that looks like a dildo! Hurr hurr how many dicks do you think she could fit in her mouth?" Fine, whatever, shrug it off, it's only few hours. Work keeps my mind off it considerably.<br><br>I get to my apartment and go on /pc/. Guess what I get greeted with? Of course, a Cure in a provocative situation, with a bunch of idiots saying the same shit I have to deal with in work.<br><br>So what do I do? I have no interest in bitching at every single person on /pc/ that annoys me, and hell, it's the internet, so of course, I make my own topic, for discussing possible ideas regarding any of the certain specific Cures.<br><br>Worst case: I end up replying and debating to myself for 20 posts, coming up with an idea I enjoy, only to have people go, "lolpowerlevels" when it wasn't even a powerlevel topic. I think it's fucking retarded that people just making up ideas for Pretty Cure get bashed when posting random jokes and porn is generally acceptable. Shit, I don't even bother you guys in your little porn topics or anything, at the very least let me talk to myself for the next 10 posts in peace.<br><br>Best Case: I end up replying and debating to myself for 20 posts, coming up with an idea I enjoy, having a few serious posters come in and make a few replies, having more than a few people coming in and making their lame jokes, then having the topic die. I then go to bed, thinking of the grand possibilities I could recreate in doujinshi if I had the drawing skills necessary.

It's just sad, but not even in a cringey way, just... pathetic. <br><br>It's one thing to just ignore shit you don't like because you're genuinely at peace with the fact that there are morons in the world, and it's out of your control.

Good job to whoever is in charge of this.</br></br>  <br><br>LNfag,are they samefag?</br></br>  <br>Damn, nice ED<br><br><br>Yeah, she is a bitch tho.</br></br></br></br>  <br>better than five volumes in one cour</br>  <br>dang she has nice tits</br>    <br>And the QUALITY begins.<br>Sasuga Passione</br></br>  I feel like there aren't enough fantasy anime with a good director/good production values  <br>Reminds me of vanadis where they only adapted one chapter of the LN for a whole episode. <br><br>Then the pacing went to shit after.</br></br></br>  <br>They might be doing 4 episodes per volume with the start of the barrier next, then investigation of Adlet follow by resolution</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, Im happy they putting more details into the anime.<br><br>All the city and forest are all better than my imagination.<br><br><br>She soon goes dark.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well unlike Vanadis, Rokka doesn't need rush for the whole arc.<br><br>And i believe Vanadis first episode already rush pretty hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are some very thick legs.</br>  We're not getting to the zombie part, are we?  <br>Seirei no Moribito comes to mind, but that's from 2007.</br>  <br>Fine, juicy rabbit meat.</br>  Well maybe we'll get some good Fremy doujinshis out of this series.  <br>I dont think so, 2nd 7th gonna be around in 5 or 6ep. Travelling and stuff until the end of vol 3 I guess.</br>  <br>How bad are we talking? I started the first volume just before and I'm about 2/3 through it.</br>  <br>The second episode ends with four of them together. They're going for five episodes for the first volume probably then 4 episodes for volume 2 and then finally 3 for volume 3.</br>  <br>The theme of whole Lns is  betrayal and doubt .</br>  <br>Enjoy the volume, you'll see soon enough.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127588562 <br>You're an ass.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127588562 <br> No one yet. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127588562 <br> cat assassin kun dies in volume 2 </br>  Also I love all the promotions shipping Adlet and Nashetania.<br><br>Cant wait till shit hits the fan.</br></br>  <br>Nah the first episode was pretty good in terms of pacing in vanadis, just they rushed after in the next episodes. <br><br>Well anyways when is the subs for this out?</br></br></br>  <br>OTP.</br>  <br>A couple minutes</br>  [Ohys-Raws] Rokka no Yuusha - 01 (MBS 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4  <br>Meanwhile Ushio and Tora is dead<br>Fuck CR</br></br>  <br>Vanadis is more on the harem, fanservice LN type.<br><br>Rokka is more on the mystery so I dont think they gonna rush.</br></br></br>  So, CR is in 35 minutes, did I get that right?   Bunny is the traitor <br>Is bunny at least still a virgin?</br>  <br>Well the novel was shipping them in the beginning of vol 1 with Goldof getting jelly and all. Of course we find out the true waifu was Fremy all along later</br>  Guess I will have to avoid these threads.<br>What's with you faggots spoiling everything?</br>  <br>Horizon series anime writer in charge the adaption, i can trust him.</br>  <br>It's /a/, you should know better than to go into thread not expecting spoilers</br>  <br>Well, all kind of monster have literally been inside her.<br><br><br>Hope so, I dont like the moeblob blood saint.</br></br></br></br>  <br> beard <br>So now he is an old man?</br></br>  <br>Do you not grow stubble when not shaving for a few days?</br>  And for one, monster side has quite of really interesting charaters.<br><br>Tgurneu best  fruit .</br></br>  <br>That's not armor, Goldof, that's not armor at all.</br>  Adlet &gt; Fremi &gt; Hans &gt; Mora &gt; Chamo &gt; Goldoff &gt; Nashetania   [HorribleSubs] Rokka no Yuusha - 01 [720p].mkv <br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07945</wbr></br></br>  <br>Noice.</br>  <br>ITS TIME.<br><br><br>Who is on the manga cover?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chamo.</br>  <br> The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. <br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>It was there, I even downloaded it.<br>Turned out to be Working!!!<br><br>Guess HS messed up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HS fucked up the ripping earlier.

Passione <br>I can't wait for the QUALITY.</br>  <br>Sure it does. That's the Saint of the Tits.</br>  MC is pretty chunni.<br>And what's wrong with his skin color, is he sick?</br>  <br> MC is pretty chunni. <br>It's about the only thing holding him together.</br></br>  Can I call worst character already?  <br>He's from Argentina so he is super white, he come Mexico to troll the Mexicans.</br>  <br><br>Lower-left person girl or boy?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127588562 <br>Posts like this are why originals are superior.</br>  <br>Best bro and best male character.</br>  <br>No he's one of the best.</br>  <br>Genderless entity of rage and hate .</br>  <br>He is actually one of the best. His verbal tic is annoying, though.</br>  <br>Not to mention he's the weakest of the bunch and needs a bunch of tools to actually fight on par with them. Why doesn't he have pocket sand for effective blinding makes me sad</br>  <br> showing drummers doing their work <br> only trumpets play from speakers <br>Who is directing this shit?</br></br></br>  That batshit insane face.   Aztec-like setting <br><br>Even if it's only for one episode, I loved it.</br></br>  <br>Just the way I like them.</br>  Oh so bunny is the Red Man, shame I guess  It's shit, right?  <br><br>SHINY SHINY</br></br>  PRINCESS IS BEST GIRL  Manga readers. What happens with Goldolff?  <br>Always a bitch's boy likes he is.</br>  <br>Swamp loli.</br>  <br>It could be worse. It could be Liden.</br>  Whole grain  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127588562 <br>fuck you</br>  wait are you serious fucking best girl is a traitor? what the fuck? that's not okay.  <br>Liden should make more shorts like Senyuu and Miss Monochrome rather than full-length series.</br>  Is there more to Nashetania than just being the imposter?  <br>Anon, look at OP's image and do a head count.</br>   Synopsis tells you about how there are 7 heroes <br> Makes you think this happens in ep1 <br><br> By end of ep1, they are far from being even close to meeting the other 5. </br></br></br>  <br> Yes, much more. </br>  So how is it ? Story looks generic as fuck but that's not the most important.  There will be more Aztec stuff right?  <br>Nanatsu no taizai.jpg</br>  <br>Sweet, that's all I wanted to know. Thanks.</br>  <br>MC is okay<br>3 on left is shit<br>3 right is good<br><br>Blue is my fav<br><br><br><br>There is more, she is  shit <br><br><br>There are 6, they need 4 more, watch again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn. I like him.</br>  <br>Good lord i feel dumb. but either way its a sad development. i would have greatly enjoyed having her as a real character</br>  <br>You'll learn a little bit after she gets caught and more after Goldof's volume</br>    <br>Not really, It would be mostly demon hunting and  backstabbing  in wasteland.</br>  <br>Nah, 7. Since one is a traitor/the demon king or whatever.</br>  <br>You will enjoy her as a real character because even a idiot like Goldoff has depth to him.</br>  <br>How about you watch it?</br>  <br><br>Shame, i liked the setting.</br></br>  <br>At least Chamo gets better while Rolonia started getting annoying in 4</br>  <br>i guess real character wasn't the best phrasing. maybe as Adlet's love interest is how i would have liked her best</br>  <br>She still sticks around, you couldnt escape the rabbbit.<br><br><br>HAHA, I will wait for your face when you see the  8th </br></br></br></br>  <br>Calm your autism, anon.</br>  Another mc this season that annoy me from the first moment i saw him.  <br>Rolonia is annoying as hell + urgly as pig.</br>  <br>Nigga this bunny ain't useless at all.</br>  <br>I like her, but Fremy more.</br>  <br>This is nothing but the carbon copy of Mondaiji, MC is izayoi, the fucking impostor is kuro usagi and the rest are the secondaries from the LN. <br><br>And there still fags defending this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You know nothing, nothing at all.<br><br>Those lips of hers ruin her design something fierce, yeah.</br></br></br>  That was really fun. I was pretty into it the whole time. I love fantasy shit.<br>But wow the princess is prime breeding material.</br>  <br>i posted this before realizing what happens so sadly im not sure if its true anymore</br>  <br>That's pretty terrible bait.</br>  <br>Thanks for always using the same image when baiting so I can filter you.</br>  <br>Be a man anon.</br>  <br><br> Assblasted Rokkafags </br></br>  Goldoff is best boy.  <br>Rabbit is still good, its just she is a bitch.</br>  <br>Haha, you couldnt be more wrong.</br>  <br>Agreed</br>  Doesn't Nashtasnia's rapiers look more like long needles?  <br><br>literally cucked by a rat</br></br>  <br>You mean cucked by a literally pikachu.</br>  Would  be betrayed by  Nashetenia  <br>Too late for surprise boxes now.</br>  <br>Can you explain why is she a bitch? I read some shit about her being an impostor, a shit, a whore, a cocksucker, and she likes buckets of semen.<br><br>What is true?</br></br></br>  To the anon who told me to finish the 3rd volume. Well, I just did and  I wonder how they can they adapt it. It stalled for too much, especially when everyone was running around searching for the princess. The autistic knight's POV was funny though, especially when he smashed her head on the ground. <br><br>Also do not reply to bait.</br></br>  I should have left the thread the moment I read it was an LN adaption.  <br>Source? I dont read the manga. I just like knightly boys.</br>  I still don't understand what mc planned to achieve when he ruined that duel. Is he so retarded he didn't expect he gonna be killed or imprisoned for this? And how does he have even any strength to train and heal wounds in prison getting a potato per day.  <br>He did it to get chosen as one of the heroes.</br>  <br> I dont read the manga. <br>*LN<br><br>The man is MacGvyer and has poisons, traps, weapons, strings and shit all over his goddamned body, he did it to get chosen as a flower becaue he has unfinished business with a certain fig fruit, they can't do shit to him because he's got the crest now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS!</br></br>  <br>Ln Manga the one thats not the anime. Whatever.</br>  <br> And how does he have even any strength to train and heal wounds in prison getting a potato per day. <br>His original training was much, much more harsh than that.</br></br>  <br>Same. I am not sure why I didn't just instantly start on the LN so I can safely come back to these threads later.<br>Is my own fault for being spoiled I guess.</br></br>   MC is an alchemist <br> fights throwing his alchemical weapons <br><br>I can easily get behind this.</br></br></br>  <br>Comes as part of the "Saint of Swords" package, same way Fremy can pull bullets and bombs out of her ass as the "Saint of Gunpowder".</br>  <br>So what does the Saint of Salt do?</br>  <br>Purify stuff and instagib kyouma.</br>  <br>Gets angry at literally everything<br><br> Able to make salt barriers that kyouma cant really cross and a few other things <br><br>Think king midas but instead of gold, salt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gust such a faggot for being afraid to do this.</br>  <br>You find out at the end of the volume.<br><br>Moras a cunt for because of the second volume and Godlof is a faggot the entire time after the first volume.</br></br></br>  I wish the OP/ED were less lackluster.  I really liked this, what a great opening episode.  <br>They might just split it 6/6 and only adapt 2 volumes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127588562 <br>Should really spoiler shit you faggot. Its against the rules to do that to people.</br>  This is nice. <br><br>Anyone know how many episodes this is getting?</br></br>  How's the pace looking so far?<br>Any prediction how many volumes they'll adapt?</br>  <br>Blood saint a shit<br><br>A SHIT</br></br></br>  <br>do you just not read threads</br>   incomplete LN <br>welp no ending now I guess. do they at least find out who's not supposed to be there?</br>  <br>But how can she be the sword of saints if she is "a traitor", aka not one of the six heroes.</br>  <br>Hans &gt; Fremy &gt; Chamo = Adlet &gt; Mora &gt;  Blood Saint  &gt; Goldoff &gt; Nashetania</br>  <br> welp no ending now I guess. do they at least find out who's not supposed to be there? <br><br> Kinda, but not really. It's still a mystery in the LN. </br></br></br>  A nice long introductory episode, It was okay.<br><br>MC seems cocky confident and sneaky which is pretty nice, I just hope going to the meet up spot doesn't take 3 episodes.</br></br>  <br>So wrong it hurst<br><br>Actually, ima leave the typo in</br></br></br>  <br>She still wants to kill half of them even after Goldof saves her. I wish Fremy really did set off those explosives on her knees</br>  <br>Shes a heartless childish greedy cunt that wines and bitches if she doesnt get her way.<br><br>Typical overly sheltered princess.</br></br></br>  <br>With this pace it probably will, maybe even 4 episodes. And that is perfectly fine.</br>  <br>There are over 50 Saints, being a Flower has nothing to do with being a Saint.</br>  <br>Oh. That ain't what I understood from the infodump. I've been misled!</br>  <br>You have to display your worthiness in front of the statue of the Goddess of Fate to get chosen. He barge in to prove himself by doing a 2v1 although people call him unhonorable but like it matters when fighting against the Kyoumas</br>  Why is aztec princess a blond playboy bunny girl? I don't understand  <br>Im still upset at Mora. She needs a good smacking  again, hopefully by Chamo, again </br>  <br>There's even a Saint of First Aid  who's the 8th Flower  but I'm not sure about the first aid part. Don't check the spoiler if you don't want to get hyped eventually for the possible next season.</br>  <br>Can you at least try?</br>  <br>You should have understood it since the scene in the prison named a bunch of saints that were killed and they were only potential flower candidates.</br>  Is sawashiro only doing the narration?  <br> cucked <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> First Aid <br> *blood, girl has a whip filled with her blood that she can control. </br></br>  Why the MC looks so much like Luke?  <br>But  Mora did that too, she chose the life of her daughter over the world.  </br>  <br>The right pace for this novel.<br><br>2 volumes is my prediction but it might be 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Mora was alright in my book since she was doing it for her loli daughter and she became a good team player afterwards unlike Pikachu and Nash which stir things up again when they rejoined the group. Hurr Adlet you could be the seventh so give leadership rights to someone else</br>  <br>She might voice Saint of Blood, which would be pretty funny with her berserker mode.</br>  <br>Is that you, Moot?</br>  Who is the demon?  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127585173#p127596995">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The semen demon?</br>  <br>The Majin?
