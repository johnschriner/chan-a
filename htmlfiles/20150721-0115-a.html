You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like how the RTK deck puts the meaning word on the front instead of the back and with kanji on front.</br>    胸がいっぱい   mfw after drinking a large frapp from Starbucks and a red bull <br> lying in bed with my head spinning still studying Japanese </br>  <br>That's the correct way, read the introduction. You go from keyword -&gt; kanji i.e. production. The things you've got to remember for RTK are few enough that you can do production in a non-time-consuming way and you get recognition for free with it.</br>  <br>Then read the introductions again, Heisig explains why it should be that way.</br>  Are we being raided by koohi?  <br> mfw just imagining getting raided by koohi <br><br>That's pretty funny anon.</br></br></br>  <br> 2 posts correcting anon's misconception about rtk <br> koohii raid </br></br>  <br> trying this hard to fit in </br>  <br>They're not that different from us:<br>http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?pid=215732#p215732<br><br>Koohii is the only other sane Japanese learning community I've found (though nowadays it's kinda dead).</br></br></wbr></br></br>   went from 59% correct to around 79-80% correct just cause i started writing each new kanji 5-10 times.  <br>I feel like something else must've finally clicked in my brain too.</br>  What's with this surge in the RTK defense force lately?  <br> Summer </br>  <br>People are finally waking up to /djt/'s irrational denial of RTK. You won't be able to conserve your dogmatic status quo any longer.</br>  <br> irrational denial of things you can learn from any dictionary while studying vocab </br>  <br>You literally have to memorize stories to get a vague understanding of what each kanji means. Fuck off already with that marketing bullshit. It's as retarded as Rosetta Stone with muh immersion.</br>   侍 <br> 待 <br> 持 <br> 時 <br><br>Love similar kanji.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The presentation of content isn't the same, but you're too blinded to see so.<br><br> literally <br>What is with idiots and this overused word? And you're wrong by the way, not like I expected any less. Stop getting so emotional about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the anti-RTK arguments are people who haven't read the introduction and are making straw-men about how people spend several months doing nothing but RTK when it can realistically be completed in 2 months (maybe 3 if you're a bit slow) while still doing other stuff alongside it.<br><br>Or people like  who don't understand what mnemonics are or that the connections are intended to be temporary (kind of like translating in your head when you first start out). Most of the stuff people bash about RTK is refuted in the introduction, but people are too impatient to read it.</br></br></br>    日本語の勉強はキツイやな？  <br>あんたのケツ穴ほどじゃないけどね</br>  私は日本語を習れる<br>だからあなた達も諦めないで<br>きっと性交するから！</br></br>  Would a good way to say "Fab Squad" like ( https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RoV<wbr>7ZctemsM</wbr>  [ ] ) in Japanese be 「イケメン連中」, 「イケメンスクアード」, or something else?<br><br>Just curious</br></br>  <br>What?</br>    <br><br/></br>   still no messages from qts on hellotalk <br><br>Would I be more likely to get people messaging me if I made my profile in English?</br></br>  <br>give up anon how many long has it been</br>  <br> give up anon  <br>No, I will not give into dekinai-chan<br> many long has it been <br>What?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's 習う, but that's very unnatural to use here. <br>性交　-sexual intercourse<br><br>（私は）今日も日本語を勉強する<br>だからあなた達も勉強あきらめないで<br>きっと成功するから</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably depends more on what country it has you listed as.<br>I got a message from someone a day after signing up but only 1 person so maybe I just got lucky.<br>I haven't talked to her in a while though because I ran out of things to talk about, unless I want to just pry into her life more by asking personal questions which might be kinda creepy.<br>She probably hates me now</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What is your profile like?

I got one girl who messaged me but hasn't logged in in 2 days. Then I messaged some dude who said he liked anime and we talked a bit, but it petered out. I'll probably message him again once I get a chance to watch this seasons shows.<br><br><br>Yep. The pic is from a couple years ago though so I might look kinda young.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yep.

(I think they might have been doing a survey or something so that was just random)<br>and that's it, I first registered I think maybe 2 weeks ago</br></br></br>  <br>not him but surely jap qts like well kept beards, don't they?</br>  <br>No, you are a disgusting barbarian.</br>  <br>Only if your face has good symmetry</br>  <br>Trimmed at about 5mm</br>  DJT Daily How Do I Make Cuties Talk To Me Thread :3<br>This place is about as bad as fucking r9k.<br>There hasn't even been a single post about Japanese so far.</br></br>  <br><br>There actually has.

If it has Sankrit, that's probably what it means by runes. So the character is saying that The God of Destruction that came out was Shiva, the god with the same name as was inscribed.</br></br></br>  <br>lol wut? Being retarded litterally makes you the best. Learning Japanese without being retarted is just dumb. Fuck on out of here, normie.</br>  <br>No, see it's literally runic characters, you know like vikings and shit and I've been trying to find sources that show Shiva's name in runes.<br><br>The only reason I brought up sanskrit was because that's the only source I can actually find his name in, the letters on the chainsaw are actually runic letters.</br></br></br>  <br>The question was more should I just take it as face value that the characters that are engraved in the chainsaw say Shiva god of description or whatever?</br>  <br>It is extremely likely that they say, or are supposed to say "Shiva", yes. It is of course possible that they just stuck random runes on there though.</br>  <br><br>Don't fret over it. It's probably just there to be cool. It really doesn't matter.</br></br>  Is there any difference between using 自動車 or 車　(くるま)?  <br>自動車は　Is a bit more formal, you'd for example say　自動車保険　and 自動車税, <br>but use 車 when saying driving,車に乗る in daily conversation.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, it's just more technical, not formal. You can use 車 in formal conversations just fine.</br>  Am I correct in assuming that when a verb has っても　attached to it that that more or less means "Even if [subject] ___"?   practicing with your tulpa   <br><br>The same difference between automobile and car.</br></br>  My google IME is completely fucked and not giving me what I type in<br>'a' for example turns into ち<br>Anybody know how to fix this?

I don't have a tulpa though.</br>  <br> schizophrenia <br> a long-term mental disorder of a type involving a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior, leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation. <br> faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion </br></br></br>  <br>Tulpa is literally self-induced Schizophrenia.</br>  Seeing Wizard makes me want to throw up. Why is this fat fuck relevant at all?  <br> leading to faulty perception <br><br>As far as I can tell this is wrong. <br>You wouldn't be able to process the shit that you can see without your brain. So technically that's just your perception, you imagine things all the time, how is that harmful or schizophrenic? <br><br>Also Schizophrenia is supposed to be harmful. Tulpas, as far as I can tell are not harmful. It doesn't seem to conflict with your daily life.<br><br> withdrawal from reality <br>How exactly?

Those people usually learn about 20-30 new cards a day (because they're learning without context), whereas if you know the Kanji beforehard, you could do as much as 70 on a normal day and 120 or more if you're motivated.<br>DJT is okay for asking light questions but usually shit for serious ones.<br><br> has posted some links, I could link you some other shows if you want.

What i do for kanji is i just look up the stroke order, and use my finger to scratch it in my skin like 20 times, helps recognition a lot. spend time to learn each kanji</br>  <br>We're never going to make it, are we?</br>  I feel like I'm not getting the feel for the language...<br><br>I don't know many words and I know most of the grammer, although I still can't understand many texts by just going through the explanations and the dictionary alongside them.<br><br>What am I doing wrong? should I maybe try to learn from something like a VN?

Problem is, I'm running into a "second-language" hard-wiring I apparently have. Things start happening like 私 habe 食べ物 gern. And other shit like that.  <br>I've no idea why you're suggesting memrise given that Anki and memrise are both SRS programs and Anki is far superior to any flashcard program I have tried or encountered. <br>What specifically in memrise solved your problem?<br>I've used anki till now with 93% retention for both Young and Mature cards and I think the CSS and HTML and notes-&gt;cards flexibility of Anki helped me a lot with that, correct me if I'm wrong but based on what I've seen with memrise, it doesn't have the capability to that..<br><br> I can usually remember what the words mean if I were to see them in hiragana <br>I wonder why it's the opposite for me, i.e., i usually have lower retention rates for vocab written in pure hiragana<br>e.g.<br>左様なら vs さようなら<br>いる、要る、居る<br>ある、有る<br>i think it has to do with me being able to associate the meanings of the Kanji with the vocab, the same might work for you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not other guy, but I can remember what words mean if it's in Kanji but can never remember how the fuck to pronounce it, especially those ones with 3-4 readings.</br>  <br>It takes time. I learned grammar early on but it still took a long time before I got to the point where I could understand most of what I read, and I had to do a lot of reading practice to get there.<br><br>I think when first starting to read it's best to find something that's already translated and open both the raw and the translation. Try reading first and then compare what you thought (or didn't) it said</br></br></br>  <br>Those are the hardest for me i always forget them if they dont contain a kanji.<br><br>じゃぶじゃぶ じゃんじゃん すべすべ かんかん きょろきょろ くしゃみ ぐずぐず くすぐったい がやがや せっかち すらすら うきうき<br>and so on and so forth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Z4FQLNWcpN</br>  <br>Thats so stupid i had to chuckle a bit.</br>  <br>I've been learning English since I was around 6 years old (thanks Cartoon Network). I also "studied" German in high school with like nothing but two sentences I ever used remaining ("Ich weiss es nicht." "Es interessiert mich nicht.") after all these years. I sometimes insert German words when trying to formulate a Japanese one, though it also happened that I said すみません instead of sorry cause of the 's' interfering. The more proficient you become in the languages the less it will happen. Just put up with it, it's natural, your brain is just trying to help you.</br>  <br>Don't try too hard memorizing too many facts at once. Stick to the minimum information principle (http://www.supermemo.com/articles/<wbr>20rules.htm).<br>You could study those other pronunciations (most of them are kunyomi I'm sure) in your vocab deck.<br>For example<br>生<br><br>生まれる<br>生む<br>生える<br>生かす<br>生ずる<br>生じる<br>etc... the list goes on<br><br>Some people make the terrible mistake of trying to memorize all of those AT ONCE. You'll eventually get stumped and demotivated, even if you manage to memorize the info in that one card I'm sure you won't for other cards because it's too much information. It essentially breaks rule #10 (Avoid enumerations).<br><br>I've made this mistake in the past and it resulted in too many relearn cards piling on top of new cards and review cards. I was aware of the 20 rules but being the pretentious asshole I am I tried to subvert it to no avail.<br><br>The only things you'll have to memorize are the meaning/s, the onyomi and a few kunyomi readings (up to 2 will do). Study the other kunyomis as separate cards in you vocab deck.<br><br>What deck are you using btw? You might find the mnemonics from the KanjiDamage to be qutie useful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> What specifically in memrise solved your problem? <br>having it give me tests when i learn a new word that get greater in difficulty helps me remember the new word much better then being told. here's a new word, try and remember it</br></br>  <br>Sounds interesting..<br>Is it something filtered decks can't solve?</br></br>  So 運動場 appears twice in a row in the core 2k/6k.  <br>don't know what a filtered deck is so i can't answer this question<br><br>it gives a bunch of community mnemonics, so you can pick the best one. it starts off with multiple choice, gets harder then asks you to remember the word. my retention rate is insane, compared to me forgetting a new word in anki probably 10 times before remembering it</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which, has anyone else had a look at the kanji deck cor くん posted? Um, the post was  I've been thinking about going and doing core6k to touch up on vocab but a lot of it I already know and last time I tried going through core I gave up out of boredom. I gave this kanji and vocab deck/s a quick look over and they are set up to be done in tandem, like 4 vocab cards using the next due kanji in the kanji deck. <br><br>Trying to learn kanji out of context never worked for me and to an extent it hasn't been all that helpful and picking up readings and being able to produce the correct kanji from memory from recognition hasn't been working very well. Going to give this deck a trial for a few months and post feedback. It is the first time I've seen this sort of arrangement with kanji and vocab in anki before. Might be more than just a novelty.</br></br></br>  <br>I see, it's somewhat similar to koohii's SRS where you also get to pick from community mnemonics. It has it limits though, especially when it comes to studying more obscure decks such as vocabulary decks, but yeah I can see its advantages because it's a feature I've also wanted.</br>   tfw listening to your favourite music <br> tfw getting everything right in todays anki cards <br><br>やった!</br></br></br>  <br>it gets better the further along you go and the more japanese gets carved into your head</br>  Not that I'm going for a few months yet, but for when I am in Japan, I have a query for you DJT clever people.<br><br>How would I ask for a Grade 0 haircut all over?

It is the way this deck has a production side based on the vocab which perked my interest. I've only reviewed 40 vocab cards/10 kanji cards but it is more enjoyable and difficult/rewarding than learning a bunch of words using the same kanji in an optimized order.

I know French because we had to learn it in school, though my production is way behind my ability to understand it.<br><br>I just noticed that sometimes Japanese words instead of French words came to mind when I was looking for a word in French. Though that seems to have stopped happening some time ago.</br></br></br>  <br>lel, why would anyone use that shitty kana keyboard instead of qwerty</br>  <br>people seem to dislike turning their phones sideways to get the bigger keyboard. I have no idea why. I turn mine sideways every chance I get</br>  <br>Probably to emulate flip-phones. You get used to it pretty fast. I don't think there is a way to change the japanese keyboard to qwerty format on iphone.<br><br><br>I don't know about that but I do think of the meaning of the word in English instead of Portuguese. Obviously I'm learning with an English deck but I find this caveat humorous.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In Japan (also Korea if anyone cares) you spend a lot of time using your phone with one hand (eg. on the train). This might be a more Korean than Japanese thing, but it also makes it really easy to type without looking too (eg. in class writing with one hand and texting with the other). There's also the fact that people are just used to the way they typed on their flip phones, and since compared to the Latin alphabet, 1 character holds a lot more value in a syllabary, the relative efficiency is a lot higher compared to our understanding of "tap 3 times for a letter".</br></br>  <br>there is for iPhone</br>  <br>That's true. At least for japanese I did find the flick was a lot more intuitive than it would be for english</br>  <br>same here, I can sometimes do it with classical (even then, leaning towards baroque), but it just lowers my efficiency and I retain a lot better if I can completely focus on anki, but everyone's different I guess</br>  <br>I see, having two decks in tandem should be a good feature, but, mnemonics + radical breakdown is invaluable to me.</br>  <br>It was a little "tsu." So the "k" in "ka" is doubled.</br>  <br>As long as I'm listening to a song that is mostly instrumental it's fine. I don't know if it lowers my efficiency or retention rate but it helps with long anki grinds.</br>  <br>At least there are already some great resources and anki decks for that like RTK and Kanjidamage.</br>  How many words are enough?<br>When does it stop?</br>  Any good anki deck for business/technical vocabulary?  <br> words <br>no that's not how it works<br>study kanji<br>and grind grammar, there's like quadruple the material of any vocab deck you might know</br></br></br></br>  がんばれ！<br><br>彼女は待っている！</br></br>  <br> and grind grammar, there's like quadruple the material of any vocab deck you might know <br>Confirmed for not knowing japanese, don't take this person's advice. The proportion of grammar to vocabulary is much higher than "quadruple".</br></br>  <br><br><br>Just fucking start reading easy level material with a grammar guide and dictionary. It will get better. The common kanji will stick better in my opinion.</br></br></br>  Has anyone worked through Tobira?

I only translated the dialogue segments though. The descriptions of motion, the rooms and such would've tripled the amount I had to write, so I just summarized the most important parts of it. Also I am not a translator, I am just somebody who likes to read moonrunes, so this is going to be worse than amateurish. If you have any parts that you would like more detail on that I didn't make clear though, just respond to that post and I'll get back to you. Also if you want to say thanks, just respond to the OP, don't quote like ten posts because gets messy.<br><br>Also stated previous, this is just the Mizore and Nozomi segments which I would say covers about 50% of the novel, so this is going to jump around a LOT. There's also some Mizore/Nozomi segments I didn't translate because there's a lot of small scenes of them which I didn't feel like writing in the context.<br><br>I put everything in a pastebin if you just want to read it by yourself<br>http://pastebin.com/9Vwpgzzu<br>it's unedited though so no bully</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The plot of volume 2 is centered around the Oboe player Mizore, and her friend Nozomi who was a freshmen that quit last year. Nozomi wants to come back but Asuka refuses to let her back in and this leads to the main drama. Kumiko gets involved playing detective as she interviews every second year student in the bass section about what happened last year, including Mizore and Nozomi themselves. But as Kumiko digs deeper, she isn’t entirely sure about what is the right thing to do anymore.<br><br>The subplots of the second volume revolve around themes of friendship and how easy it is to lose a friend you considered very dear. Kumiko and Azusa don’t talk anymore despite them being best friends in middle school. Kumiko also worries how long her relationship with Reina will last since Kumiko can’t keep up with Reina’s ambitions. Reina’s subplot is about her love for Taki sensei as another adviser comes to the club who everyone thinks is Taki sensei’s girlfriend. This leads Reina into spiraling depression but she gets her smile back at the end. Taki sensei’s subplot revolves around his wife who is finally revealed by Taki sensei’s best friend, Hashimoto who also comes to help advise. And then there’s a subplot about the change of Asuka and Kumiko’s relationship from section leader and club member to something more like mentor and protege. Asuka starts grooming Kumiko to be her successor but at the same time Kumiko butts heads with Asuka on their ideals. As Asuka starts to peel off her mask little by little, Kumiko is afraid of what she sees. <br><br>The major events all take place around a 3-day band camp and the events that follow which you could consider the equivalent of the audition from volume 1. However this summary only covers Mizore and Nizomi’s scenes so most of that band camp is left out until I one day do the same thing for Asuka which I really am contemplating because rereading what I wrote, it turns out I messed up on a lot of things and I hate it when that happens.</br></br></br></br>  The second volume begins with Mizore and Nozomi at the prefecture tournament after the results of their performance (sound familiar?). Mizore is sitting on the bus next to Nozomi with her shoes and socks off after the Kyoto competition. Mizore is deep in thought, thinking about the nature of competitions. When they say competition, they always refer to music competitions such as the Kansai tournament.<br><br>Nozomi: Carsick?<br>Mizore: It's not that, I'm fine<br>Nozomi: You sure? Then that's good<br>Nozomi: The competition is really over<br>Nozomi: I thought we'd make it all the way to Nationals this year but the world just doesn't work that way <br>Mizore: uh huh<br>Nozomi: It really sucks that it’d end this way<br>Mizore: ...yeah<br>Nozomi: Hey Mizore<br>Nozomi: Do you really think that?<br>Mizore: I do<br>Nozomi: Sorry, I said something stupid. Of course you’d be upset too<br>Mizore: It's fine, I'm not really that upset<br>Nozomi: I'm being a little strange right now. Sorry, I'll shut up<br> Mizore mumbles to herself <br>Mizore: Just what are competitions really?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you based novelanon</br>  <br> Mizore and Nozomi's middle school (also Natsuki and Yuuko's), Minamichuu was a fairly famous school. They made it to the Kansai tournament six times and got dud gold three times but never made it to Nationals. They could never figure out what they were missing that was needed to make it all the way to Nationals though. Nozomi is the current president of the club after reaching her third year. The previous years they got dud gold and then silver. <br>Nozomi: This year we're definitely going to Nationals!<br>Nozomi: This is the last competition for us in middle school, so lets really make it to Nationals!<br> The club practices their free-choice piece "Daphnis et Chloé" to perfection, spending their entire summer rehearsing instead of having fun, all in order to make it to Nationals, Unfortunately, the result was nothing short of a disaster <br>Club Member A: So this is the result huh<br>Nozomi: This has to be a mistake<br>Club Member B: We couldn't have gotten Silver. It's still Kyoto right?<br> Mizore is speechless and keeps thinking to herself that this all must be a mistake. That at any moment now, a staff member will come to tell them they messed up. And then... <br>Neighboring School: KANSAI TOURNAMENT!<br>Nozomi:..... lets get on the bus<br>Nozomi gathers everyone up<br>Nozomi: I'm real sorry guys, for putting you through all this<br> Everyone is back on the bus now and the scene shifts back to conversation between Nozomi and Mizor. The bus is eerily quiet, everyone too tired to cry anymore. Mizore now thinking about how all their effort and work amounted to nothing in the end. Nozomi suddenly asks Mizore another question <br>Nozomi: Hey Mizore, do you like competitions?<br> Nozomi's is facing the window with her back turned towards Mizore but Mizore can see through the window’s reflection that Nozomi is about to cry. Mizore’s throat starts to burn but all she can do is shove her face in her lap and pretend that she's sleeping. She mumbles <br>Mizore: I hate them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Season 2 never?  Mizore’s first actual introduction in the novel is when Reina tells Kumiko about despite the fact that Reina shows up at 6am for practice (and to see Taki-sensei), Mizore is actually always the first one to club. Kumiko agrees to join Reina for early morning practice, and after Reina’s daily visit to Taki sensei’s office, they find Mizore already in the club room practicing. Mizore’s oboe is so beautiful that Kumiko thought it was someone singing at first until she saw it was infact Mizore playing her oboe.<br><br>Reina: This is Mizore, the one I was talking about<br> Kumiko listens to Mizore’s long tones, thinking about how beautiful they are but at the same time she says <br>Kumiko: It feels like something is missing though<br>Reina: Good morning<br>Mizore:.... How rare<br>Mizore: Two of you today?<br>Reina: Yes that’s right, today we came together<br>Kumiko: umm, Mizore senpai, do you always come this early<br>Mizore: yes, always<br>Kumiko: It’s really early though. Do you like practice?<br>Mizore: Who knows<br> Mizore goes back to practicing while Reina and Kumiko look at eachother, both thinking that Mizore is a strange person and leave her be. Kumiko feels like this is the second time she’s felt this way about a person since she joined the club. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Based.  This is the first scene with Nozomi. Prior to this scene, Nozomi has been with Natsuki, the both of them planning on how to get Nozomi back into the club. You also get to see the other side of Natsuki for the first time, a bit more serious side of her which she only shows when she is around Nozomi. Kumiko sees Nozomi in the hallway, peeping into classroom 3-3, the bass section practice room<br><br> Nozomi: ....eh?<br>Kumiko: Um, can I help you?<br> Nozomi blankly stares at Kumiko, and then goes “ahh” and then stares at Kumiko’s euphonium <br>Nozomi: Are you by any chance a first year from the wind ensemble club?<br>Kumiko: Ahh, yes. That’s right<br>Nozomi: This room is the bass section’s practice room right? Do you know when Asuka senpai is going to come?<br>Kumiko: Umm....<br> Kumiko is wondering why this girl wants to know about Asuka senpai and gets lost in thought thinking about where Asuka might be and if she should tell her. Suddenly Natsuki runs down the hallway towards them with an extremely frantic look on her face. This is the first time Kumiko has ever seen Natsuki lose her cool. <br>Natsuki: Hold it Nozomi! What do you think you’re doing?<br> Nozomi goes “crap” and Natsuki is panting, trying to catch her breath after running here <br>Natsuki: Didn’t I tell you to hide somewhere until I told you to come? What happens if you get caught by the other club members?<br>Nozomi: But...<br>Natsuki: No buts! You’ll get in even more trouble than you already are in.<br> Nozomi gives in to Natsuki’s angry gaze <br>Nozomi: Okay I get it I get it. If I got not say in this, then I’ll be waiting in room 7 until you call for me.<br>Natsuki: If you get it then good</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Noice  <br> Nozomi then takes a close look at Kumiko and says “you look like a real mischief maker”. Kumiko isn’t sure if she should agree or disagree with that. Nozomi starts laughing and &gt;Natsuki sends a a suspicious look at Nozomi <br>Natsuki: hold on, you didn’t say anything weird to her did you?<br>Nozomi: I didn’t say anything~<br> Nozomi pats Kumiko on the shoulder a few times and slings her backpack onto her shoulder <br>Natsuki: Don’t do anything strange like this again. The one who’s going to be in trouble is you after all.<br>Nozomi: I said I get it<br> Nozomi starts to walk away, her ponytail swaying back and forth. She then slowly turns around. Nozomi tries to make what resembles a smile, her bangs covering her eyes. <br>Nozomi: Natsuki<br>Nozomi: ...Thanks<br> Natsuki is silent, her throat tightens a bit and she lets out an unusual sound. She looks like she’s trying to choke something down. Some time passes until Natsuki responds <br>Natsuki: You don’t need to thank me <br> Natsuki groans <br>Nozomi: well, I’ll be waiting then<br>Natsuki: Kumiko, I’m sorry but could you keep what just happened with her a secret? I need to think about a lot of things.<br> Natsuki’s voice almost sounding like a threat, Kumiko nods repeatedly. Relieved, Natsuki finally returns to her normal cynical smile. Midori walks towards them, cradling her contrabass in both arms. <br>Midori: Kumiko chan, lets hurry and practice!<br> Natsuki goes into the band room <br>Midori: Did something happen with Natsuki senpai?<br>Kumiko: It was nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Later that week, the bass section is gathered up as usual for practice. Since the incident with Nozomi, Natsuki has been asking very strange, especially around Asuka. Asuka takes notice to this and asks<br><br>Asuka: Natsuki, do you need something from me?<br> Natsuki unnaturally sits up straight <br>Natsuki: Ahh, no, sort of kind of.. not really..<br> Asuka looks deeply at Natsuki through her glasses. Kumiko mentions how Asuka’s gaze is sometimes scary. Everyone in the room looks at those two worriedly. <br>Natsuki: Actually, I do have something to consult you on senpai<br>Asuka: Consult me? Do you mean with me as a person or me as vice president?<br>Natsuki: Both..... will you hear me out?<br>Asuka: Well if it’s just listening then whatever<br> Natsuki leaves the room with everyone puzzled as to what she’s doing. After a few minutes, Natsuki leads Nozomi into the room by hand. <br>Riko:...... Nozomi chan?<br> Riko suddenly stands up, knocking her chair to the ground. Gotou takes a big gulp. Nozomi looks to Kumiko and shrugs her shoulders. Midori and Hazuki both make eye contact, realizing how grave the situation is. Asuka as usual does not act surprised or act anything for the matter. She fixes her glasses and then says <br>Asuka: Nozomi-chan, why are you here?<br> Asuka says this with an intonation that is telling her to leave. Nozomi stands silently in front of Asuka and bows her head. Goto and Riko watch with eyes wide open. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: I want to return to the club!<br>Asuka: ha?<br> Asuka turns to Natsuki <br>Asuka: When you said consult, did you mean this?<br> Asuka is in her emotionless uncaring state now, asking only to get confirmation. Natsuki takes a step back due to the pressure exerted. But then she resolves herself and bows her head too, alongside Nozomi <br>Natsuki: Please let Nozomi back into the club<br> Nozomi raises her head in response to Natsuki’s plea and looks at Asuka <br>Nozomi: I’m not asking to be let into the A-team right now. I just want to be let back into the club, like in the B-team. I want to help support the A-team and see with my own eyes us making it to Nationals. Please let me back into the club. Please I beg you.<br>Asuka: Not happening<br> Asuka is completely unshaken with Nozomi’s plea <br>Asuka: At the very least, I’m not letting you back into the club until the A-team’s competition is over. If you still want to rejoin the club, then go Taki sensei and receive permissi-<br>Nozomi: I want your approval!<br>Asuka: If that’s the case, then give up on wanting to rejoin until Nationals is over. After that, you can come back whenever you want.<br> The room is filled with silence, Nozomi with a strained look on her face <br>Asuka:.... I want the freshmen to go home. We still have things to talk about here.<br> The scene ends here with Kumiko, Midori and Hazuki leaving the club. Midori and Hazuki are disappointed they don’t get to see the ending. They then start making plans to go to the pool together instead since they haven’t hung out together in a while. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you're going to translate it, translate it, don't adapt it into a screenplay.    <br>Nozomi comes back to the club several times making the same plea and the freshmen as usual are kicked out everytime. This scene involves Kumiko, Hazuki and Midori listening through from the doorway after being kicked out as usual<br><br>Nozomi: Senpai, why cant I come back?<br>Asuka: Nozomi-chan, will you give it up already? Even if you keep coming here everyday like this, I already said I won’t let you back in. And I want to practice.<br>Nozomi: But if I don’t ask, then you won’t give me permission to come back. And even if I’m here, you can just ignore me and practice if you wanted.<br>Asuka: Just by coming here you’re wasting my time. And in the first place, Natsuki what are you trying to do? Why are you trying to bring this kid back into the club?<br>Riko: umm, Asuka senpai, I think Natsuki is just trying to help out a friend in need....<br>Gotou: Riko..... that goes without say. Asuka senpai already knows that.<br>Natsuki: Always sucking up to Asuka senpai aren’t you Gotou? Even though your girlfriend said something good. I wonder when Riko is going to ask you to decide between her and Asuka.<br>Gotou: Natsuki, be quiet. Riko wouldn’t say that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shut the fuck up and enjoy. <br><br><br><br>Thank you so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: Senpai!, I really just want to help everyone. I want to come back to the club one more time. Is there anything wrong with that?<br>Asuka: No, there’s nothing wrong with what you’re saying Nozomi chan. Not a problem at all. Simply put, the only reason why I wont let you back into the club is my ego. If you really want to come back to the club, just forget about me and go to the Taki’s office and....<br>Nozomi: Then there’s no point if it’s not you!<br> The sudden outburst from Nozomi silences the room. Nozomi mutters <br>Nozomi: Asuka senpai is special<br> Kumiko agrees that Asuka is special and thinks back to all the times Natsuki has repeated these words. Asuka takes a deep breath <br>Asuka: Take a second to think about why I’m not letting you back into the club<br>Nozomi: huh?<br>Asuka: I can’t approve you coming back to the club. You wouldn’t a plus in my book.<br>Natsuki: What do you mean?<br> Asuka doesn’t answer and leaves the room. With a big grin on her face, she looks at Kumiko and the others who are now caught in the act. <br>Asuka: Lets end this discussion here today. We can all agree to that right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Favorite Hibikek?  This is another early morning scene but this time Yuuko arrives too and you can see Yuuko’s interactions with Mizore. Ever since Nozomi left the club, Yuuko has always spent what time she could with Mizore to keep her company.<br><br>Yuuko: Good morning!<br>Reina: Good Morning, Yuuko senpai<br>Yuuko: ahh, the first year duo has arrived too<br>Mizore: Yuuko, do you not like them?<br> Kumiko is surprised that Mizore is the one who said it  <br>Yuuko: Not like what?<br>Mizore: Those two, Yuuko<br>Reina: Is that true? Senpai?<br>Yuuko: Who knows? Whatever, Kouhai<br> Reina and Yuuko both start laughing. Kumiko is slightly creeped out at this scene. Yuuko moves next to Mizore. <br>Yuuko: Mizore, you really dont know much about the band drama do you?<br>Mizore: Because I’m not interested<br>Yuuko: Well, that’s one of your good points I guess.... speaking of which I just remembered something<br> Yuuko stands up from her seat and suddenly turns to Kumiko and Reina who are eavesdropping <br>Yuuko: Are you two making sure to practice or what?<br> Yuuko then walks up to Mizore and whispers in her ear <br>Yuuko: Yesterday it seems like Nozomi came to club and said she wanted to come back<br> Mizore’s eyes that were shut while she was playing suddenly widen and she gasps but doesn’t say anything. Mizore then lowers her eyes and shuts them again, as if to shut out everything around her. <br>Mizore: is that so?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kumiko after practice finds Mizore balled up and sitting on the stairs with her face in her lap, visibily shaken. Mizore looks up and sees Kumiko when Kumiko walks up to her. Kumiko describes Mizore’s eyes as looking like the ocean at night. So dark you can’t see through it but calm like the surface of still water. This scene kicks it up a bit, there's a lot of stuff that happens beforehand though.<br><br>Kumiko:.... Mizore Senpai<br>Kumiko: Senpai, are you okay?<br>Mizore: I feel awful<br> Beads of sweat roll down Mizore’s face <br>Kumiko: Senpai, whats wrong? Should we go to the nurses office? It’s summer break so I don’t know if its open or not though...<br>Mizore: It’s fine, I don’t need to go<br>Kumiko: Your complexion is awful though. Are you sick?<br>Mizore: It’s not that. Don’t worry about it<br> Kumiko tries to drag Mizore onto her feet when suddenly she hears the sound of a flute playing. It’s the flute solo from the start of their free-choice piece. The warm and lovely sound of the flute suddenly makes Kumiko recall where she heard this sound from. <br>Kumiko:.....This is the sound of Minamichuu’s flute players<br> Minamichuu is famous for their flute players. Kumiko in particular has always loved the sound of their flutes and has listened to recordings of their flute players countless times. The person who is playing the flute perfectly right now is like listeneing to that recording once again. Kumiko knows for a fact that none of the third years can play this well which makes her look towards the direction from where the flute is coming from, curious as to who is playing. <br>Mizore: I’m going to throw up<br> Mizore’s expression has gotten worse. She gets up struggles to hold onto the handrail. <br>Kumiko: Senpai, are you okay? Don’t push yourself<br>Mizore: This sound. No. I don’t want to hear it<br> Mizore uneasily descends down the stairs, as if she’s trying to run from something. She disappears down the hallway. <br>Kumiko: I wonder if she’s okay?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko continues on her way to find her competition piece she left behind while listening to the sound of the flute, which has moved onto the next part of the song. She arrives at her room and finds Nozomi <br>Nozomi: Oh hey, it’s the UFO kid<br> Nozomi then suddenly gets worried and uneasily points at Kumiko, realizing she got caught. Kumiko notices that Nozomi has a folded up copy of their competition piece <br>Nozomi: ahh, well this is uhh that you know. I just wanted to try playing it.<br>Kumiko: Where did you get that from?<br>Nozomi: I got it from Natsuki. Ahh, can you keep this a secret. It’s not like I want to participate in the competition or anything. I just wanted to try playing it you know.<br>Kumiko: Is that right?<br>Nozomi: yes yes. Hey wait, isn’t it kind of early today? Your ensemble.<br>Kumiko: Today’s ensemble ended early. It’s the Firework festival.<br>Nozomi: Ehhh, That means Asuka-senpai left already right? There was no point in waiting for her then!<br> Nozomi shrugs her shoulders. Kumiko actually knows that Asuka is still in the music room but decides that its better to keep her mouth shut for once to stop any drama from happening. <br>Kumiko: Anyway, Senpai, you’re really good. I’m surprised.<br>Nozomi: Ahh, thanks<br> Kumiko is looking around for her copy of the competition piece that she left behind which she has now found <br>Nozomi: You came looking for that?<br> Kumiko notices that the silver flute in Nozomi’s hand is not one from the school <br>Kumiko: Senpai, is that flute your own?<br>Nozomi. Ahh, it is. At Minamichuu, if you don’t own your own flute you couldn’t play, so I asked my parents to buy it for me<br>Kumiko: Senpai, you really like the flute don’t you?<br> Nozomi’s mouth suddenly shuts and she squeezes her flute. Kumiko looks at Nozomi  <br>Kumiko: What’s wrong senpai?<br>Nozomi relaxes herself and then makes a smile<br>Nozomi: I like it. Love it.<br> Kumiko feels like Nozomi was trying to convince herself what she was saying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Mizore's eyes were blue? KyoAni changed her eye color.</br>  It’s pool day and everyone is here. Kumiko Hazuki Midori and Reina all arrive together. Hazuki is the only one who can swim since she went to swimming school as a kid. Reina mentions the previous day it’s a good time to go to the pool because her bikini is getting tight. Kumiko asks where but Reina won’t answer because she’s embarassed. Reina and Midori surprisingly hit it off, Reina likes Midori because she’s very talented and Midori likes Reina because Reina has big breasts (not even kidding on this one). Asuka and Kaori then arrive together, in black and white bikinis respectively. Kumiko at first doesn’t recognize the dazzling goddess in the front of her because Asuka isn’t wearing her glasses. And both of them are licking icecream cones because why not. Midori comments that Asuka and Kaori look like models. Reina sarcastically says that it’s a good thing Yuuko isn’t here or else she might faint if she sees Kaori in a bikini. And speaking of the devil, Yuuko screams in the distance and rushes over to them, with Mizore right behind her. Not wanting to get involved in the chaos, the girls leave. Midori and Reina go off to buy some icecream while Kumiko decides to go buy the drinks at the vending machine. When she gets there, Kumiko suddenly gets a cold shock when someone places a cold bottle on her nape  <br>Kumiko: hyaaa<br> Kumiko turns around, and sees the smuggest expression on Nozomi’s face. <br>Kumiko: Nozomi senpai, why are you here?<br>Nozomi: I came with my class. Natsuki is here too<br>Kumiko: ahh, speaking of which, Asuka said she saw Natsuki too.<br>Nozomi: So Kumiko, how long have you practiced the euphonium?<br>Kumiko: ah, since elementary school. I was in a brass band.<br>Nozomi: I see <br> Kumiko feels the mood is kind of bad since all the previous incidents and tries to twist off the cap of her bottle but it’s too wet to get a grip. Then she finally asks <br>Kumiko: Umm, Senpai, why did you quit the club?<br>Nozomi: hm? You’re interested in that?<br>Kumiko: I’m curious<br>Nozomi takes the bottle from Kumiko’s hand and swiftly twists the cap off<br>Nozomi: It’s quite a long story but are you okay with that?<br>Kumiko nods her head and they both sit on a nearby bench<br>Nozomi: You’re in the A-team right?<br>Kumiko: Ah yes. I am.<br> Kumiko is worried about the question she was asked and grips her bottle  <br>Nozomi: What do you think about Natsuki being put in the B-team?<br> Kumiko stops breathing and her eyes widen. Nozomi is still smiling at her but her eyes look very serious <br>Nozomi: Nozomi is a 2nd year but in the B-team while you’re a freshmen in the A-team. What’s the deal with that?<br> Kumiko then goes through a bit of audition trauma in her head again and there’s a long reminder on what went down last volume. Kumiko is worried that Nozomi might hate her for taking Natsuki’s seat. <br><br><br>hrm, I think everyone has actual normal Japanese colors in the novel, like every has either brown or black hair so I assume the eyes are brown. Kumiko just thinks Mizore's eyes look like the ocean. I'll have get back to you on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko:.... it’s just how things turned out<br> Nozomi makes an unexpected expression at Kumiko while Kumiko continues speaking <br>Kumiko: Kitauji is planning to go to Nationals, so it’s expected that there should be an audition to choose the members. In a competition, an individuals skill is also necessary. As long as the individual excels in skill, even if they’re a first year, I think that them being chosen is just how things are going to turn out<br>Nozomi: Well said, I think so too<br>Kumiko: eh?<br> Kumiko was taken back by Nozomi’s unexpected response. She expected Nozomi to be angry but Nozomi starts cackling and then smiles <br>Nozomi: Well, I also understand that it’s better to pick someone based off of their skill rather than some ambiguous standard. It’s unbearable to have someone be put in the A-team over me just because they’re older even though they’re hopeless.<br>Kumiko: You didn’t have auditions last year?<br>Nozomi: That’s right. It seems like last year’s advisers goal was for “everyone to get along and have fun in club” so members were chosen from the third year down. Just thinking about it now still pisses me off.<br> The bottle in Nozomi’s hands make a crushing sound <br>Nozomi: What are the serious members supposed to do when they’re told that? You can’t win if you gather together all of the useless slackers. If that’s the case, then normally you should be putting the skilled first years who are practicing into the A-team. If you gather all of the kids who who want to try and win, then even if you get silver or copper you can accept it when that happens.<br>Nozomi: But, that adviser from the start never planned on winning in the first place. We couldn’t accept that. If we could all play together, we’d be fine, that’s what we truly thought. But under that adviser, those dumb third years got cocky.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thanks for this, OP  <br> Kumiko starts thinking about the adviser before Taki sensei who was Rikako sensei. She was very kind and gentle adviser but had no drive to push the club to win. She left because she got pregnant which is how Taki sensei ended up at Kitauji. <br>Kumiko: If you were so determined then why did you quit the club Senpai? Why are you trying to come back now after all this time?<br>Nozomi: Simply put, I’m jealous<br>Nozomi: During Minamichuu’s last competition, we got silver. At first we were extremely disappointed but when we got to highschool we got back on our feet. My classmates from middle school and I, we decided that in highschool, even if we couldn’t make it to Nationals, we’d at least take gold at the Prefecture competition. Well, Kitauji is a weak school but we were enthusiastic about being able to reshape the club.<br> Nozomi looks like she’s thinking about the past while a sudden breeze blows between them <br>Nozomi: But the moment we joined the club, it didn’t go at all like we planned. When we were first years, there were a lot of third year students you see. Furthermore, our club is a lot like the sport clubs right? There’s a pecking order. That’s why no matter how hard us first years tried to speak out, nobody would listen to us. Instead, they called us annoying. The second years were afraid of the third years so they didn’t listen to us either... and thanks to them there were a lot of complaints.<br> And then this goes on for about another few pages and ends with Nozomi and the rest of the members quitting when they’re all put into the B-team while the third year slackers get all the A-team seats without audition. The members who quit joined the K-ON (light music) club. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko: Mizore and Yuuko senpai were all from Minamichuu right? Why didn’t those two quit?<br>Nozomi: When we asked Yuuko, she said she’d like to try it for a little longer. Mizore... from the start nobody tried to ask her to leave I think.<br>Nozomi: That’s because she’s Kitauji’s one and only oboe. I don’t think she understood how we felt. That’s why nobody said anything to her.<br> Is that really what happened thought Kumiko. That since Mizore was the only freshmen in the A-team, nobody asked her. Maybe it was just because they were all jealous. But Kumiko didn’t have the courage to say this to Nozomi. <br>Nozomi: Speaking of which, Yuuko asked me the same thing<br>Kumiko: Yuuko senpai did?<br>Nozomi: Yeah. She asked me why I didnt ask Mizore. The reason why Mizore was in our club in middle school was because I invited her. Mizore and I are childhood friends, we’ve always been close. So I think that’s why Yuuko asked me about it.<br>Kumiko: So then, what did you say back?<br>Nozomi: hm? Oh, I didn’t say anything important. Just that I didn’t have a need to ask her, something around those lines. I don’t really remember.<br>Kumiko: ..... is that so?<br> Kumiko didn’t feel like Nozomi was being dishonest, and that Nozomi answered with how she actually felt. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: When I tried to quit the club, Asuka senpai called out to me. Everyone thinks Asuka senpai is special and to be honest, even the third years were scared of her. Asuka senpai refuses things that would be a loss to her through her calculation and treats everyone accordingly. The bass section was called Tanaka’s Kingdom and was mocked by everyone but I think the bass section was better off than the rest of the club.<br>Kumiko: What did Asuka senpai ask you?<br>Nozomi: Well, I was really surprised when it happened. I was going to submit my form to quit the club and Asuka senpai just happened to be there submitting something. As soon as we met she suddenly looked and me then started laughing and said “Wow, you’re really quitting? What an idiot”, she was treating me like a real fool.<br>Kumiko: Huh, isn’t that actually really mean?<br>Nozomi: It was mean wasn’t it? I got really huffy too when that happened. I said back that “this isn’t an idiotic thing to do” and I don’t know why but she just laughed some more. Then she said “You’re going to sacrifice yourself for a bunch of worthless people? That sounds pretty idiotic to me. If you just leave them alone, sooner or later they’re going to graduate”. Going that far to say that, I realized that Asuka must’ve hated the third years too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozomi: Thinking back on it, Asuka senpai must’ve been trying to stop me from leaving. She asked me if I couldn’t just wait for the third years to graduate but I said I couldn’t wait. If I could wait, then I wouldn’t be trying to quit in the first place. Senpai I feel was a bit shocked and then said “I don’t know about the other members, but you’ll definitely come back to the club. The fact that you didn’t already join the Light Music club is my proof. You still have lingering affection for our club”. “If you quit now and later you want to come back, there’s no time limit for when the club will accept you again. If I feel like your presence in the club will become a minus though, then I’m sorry but I’ll object to you coming back. If you don’t want that to happen, then I’d prefer you stay in the club” she said.<br> Nozomi says Asuka hit the bullseye and continues <br>Nozomi: I don’t know why but that really set me off and I said back toher “No matter what you say, I’m not coming back and even in the most unlikely case that I do, I won’t come back until I get your approval!”<br>Kumiko:..... so is that the reason why you’ve been so obsessed with Asuka senpai?<br>Nozomi: well, yeah thats about it. I don’t really care about Asuka senpai herself, but the words she said to me those days I’ll never forget. What she said was right, a year later and here I am trying to come back to the club.<br>Nozomi: I was angry that time, but from the bottom of my heart I probably must’ve been happy when Asuka tried to stop me from leaving. I.. was a problem child in the flute section and I didn’t have a place where I belonged. I don’t have any good memories of that time..... the bass section on the otherhand must’ve been a very lovely place. Well there you have it, until Asuka senpai accepts me, I won’t rejoin the club. Asuka senpai is very special to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi goes on to talk about how the real reason why she wants to come back to the club is because of how Taki sensei replaced Rikako sensei and now the club made it to the Kansai tournament. It’d be obvious that anyone who quit last year would want to come back after changes like this she says. Nozomi’s dream has always been to make it to Nationals, and she doesnt mind if she doesnt get to play but as long as she gets to go. <br>Nozomi: Asuka is a really amazing person. She can see parts of me even I can’t see. Senpai won’t let me rejoin the club because she thinks if I rejoin I’ll become a minus. But I dont know what she means by that. I don’t think there’s anything Senpai would be worried about either.<br> Kumiko thinks back to a conversation she had with Reina about Nozomi. Reina thinks that Nozomi ran away from the club but Kumiko thinks that Nozomi chose the best option she had available to her. <br>Kumiko: I’ll look into it<br>Nozomi: huh?<br>Kumiko: I said I’ll look into why you can’t come back to the club. And then I’ll get you back into the club. The fact that you can’t come back is strange.<br>Nozomi: Just the fact that you care makes me happy. Thanks Kumiko-chan<br>Kumiko: hey wait a second... my friends bought me icecream!<br>Nozomi: If you don’t hurry won’t your icecream melt? Sorry for keeping you for so long<br>Kumiko: It’s fine, I should be thanking you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nozomi is so smug, I knew she was gonna tease Kumiko.  I really love this scene since it's a Taki sensei scene<br><br>It’s around 7pm at school and everyone except Kumiko, Mizore and Taki sensei have left. This is a really great Taki sensei scene, not so much a Mizore scene even though she’s there. This is another one of the scenes where Kumiko and Taki sensei interact and it reveals a bit about Taki sensei’s past and character. Kumiko is staying late to practice. During a period where both of them are taking a break from playing, Kumiko starts talking with Mizore.<br><br>Kumiko: Senpai, have you ever lived anywhere besides the Kansai region?<br>Mizore: I haven’t. Why?<br>Kumiko: ahh, I noticed you don’t speak in the Kansai dialect so I’ve always been curious<br>Mizore: My cousins live in Saitama. Probably that’s why.<br>Kumiko: ah, so you’re infected? It makes sense that if you’re always speaking the main dialect, you’d be infected with it.<br>Mizore: uhuh<br> Mizore goes back to practicing and so does Kumiko. Taki sensei peeks into the classroom <br>Taki: I see you two are still here practicing <br>Taki: Isn’t it about time for you two to go home?<br> Kumiko hurriedly stands up from her seat but Taki sensei says its fine and gestures with his hand that it’s okay to keep practicing <br>Taki: I only came to see how you two were doing, I don’t mind if you still want to practice<br> In Taki’s hand are some bottles of green tea from the school vending machine <br>Taki: These are some refreshments. Keep it a secret from the other students though<br> Taki puts his index finger on his lip as he says this. Kumiko thinks about how strange it is that Taki sensei is acting a bit smug with that gesture, even stranger that it actually looks natural. He hands the bottles to Kumiko and Mizore <br>Taki: This one is for you Yoroizuka-san</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko: Sensei, do you always stay this late?<br> As Kumiko asked this, Taki looks a bit troubled for a moment but then laughs <br>Taki: Well, it’s that kind of job after all<br> Kumiko’s heart feels a bit tight as she looks at Taki sensei’s usual smile and grips her bottle <br>Kumiko: But aren’t you always here early in the morning too? Isn’t the club a lot of hard work?<br>Taki: It certainly it is a lot of work, but it’s a fulfilling job. Pursuing the same dreams with all of you and spending everyday like this is truly enjoyable. And well...<br> Taki pauses for a short moment, his eyes becoming slightly strained. The intonation from those last words were unpleasant. Kumiko looks up at Taki sensei, and Taki sensei changes his tone to a sarcastic one <br>Taki: I don’t have a wife or any kids after all. The only thing I have is this job.<br> That’s a lie, Kumiko immediately thinks. What part of it is a lie, Kumiko doesn’t know, but Taki sensei is an adult and hiding things are what adults do. Kumiko keeps quiet though. Taki sensei then walks up to the music stand <br>Taki: Since you two are still here, shall we practice?<br><br>Also I saw you guys talking about it in the other thread, but they actually talk about it in the novel  Kumiko think's Taki sensei's wife looks like Kaori </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So this is the jump to band camp, it's quite a big event but you only get to see the stuff that happens with Mizore<br><br>This scene takes place at band camp, at around 1am. Kumiko gets something to drink after Reina keeps her up all night being frustrated about Taki sensei and Niiyama sensei flirting. Mizore suddenly taps Kumiko on her shoulder from behind and Kumiko screams, thinking Mizore is a ghost. This leads to the first major conversation between Kumiko and Mizore. This is also the first scene where Mizore actually shows emotion when speaking normally she's very quiet and expressionless. Also Kumiko is afraid of ghosts which leads to some funny stuff in later stories.<br><br>Kumiko: [screams externally]<br>Mizore: ...... you don't have to act that surprised<br>Kumiko: Senpai, what are you doing up this late?<br>Mizore: Couldn't sleep. Decided to play a game<br>Kumiko: What kind of game?<br>Mizore: Rhythm game<br> Kumiko notices Mizore is playing a rhythm game on her cellphone on extreme difficulty level, the notes flying by too fast for Kumiko’s eyes to keep up with <br>Kumiko: Senpai, do you like games?<br>Mizore: Not really<br> Mizore turns off the game, and points to Kumiko's music player with wrinkled eyebrows <br>Mizore: That song, turn it off<br>Kumiko: eh?<br>Mizore: Daphnis et Chloé. I hate it<br>Kumiko: Ah, I'm sorry<br> Kumiko thinks Mizore must have really good ears if she could tell what song was playing just by listening to the sound that leaks out of her earbuds. Mizore moves over to a bench next to the vending machines. <br>Mizore: Sit<br>Kumiko: umm, so why did you join the wind ensemble club?<br>Mizore: I was invited, by a friend<br>Kumiko: By friend do you mean Nozomi-senpai?<br> Mizore's eyes suddenly widen in response and then she nods  <br> umiko: umm, why did you not quit the club last year? A lot of the other members from Minamichuu quit <br>Mizore: ...... did you want me to quit?<br>Kumiko: ahh, no, I didn't mean it like that!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore:...hey<br>Kumiko: w-what?<br>Mizore: Competitions, do you like them? (they’re talking about music competitions in this conversation)<br>Kumiko: come again?<br>Mizore: I.. hate competitions<br>Kumiko: Why do you hate them?<br>Mizore: Competitions are unfair<br>Mizore: Objectively evaluating music, that's unreasonable<br>Kumiko: Why do think that?<br>Mizore: Because in the end, it's up to the taste of the judges<br>Kumiko: Well, it's true that it's hard to attach a score to the performing arts. Stuff like dance is like that too.<br>Mizore: That's why skill is important.<br>Mizore: When it comes to Nationals, all the free-choice songs will be the ones of the highest difficulty. It's easy to judge something based on skill and hard for it be influenced by personal taste<br>Mizore: Despite that, in the end it's still decided by the taste of people. There are a lot of things I cannot accept about these evaluations.<br>Kumiko: Hrmm. But that’s just how things are. It's gotta be hard evaluating it in any other way.<br>Mizore: Just how things are?<br>Mizore: Words like "just how things are" don't justify anything. Competitions are painful. I wish they would just disappear.<br>Mizore: Sorry<br>Kumiko: That was unexpected. Senpai, you don't like competitions?<br>Mizore: Hate em<br>Kumiko: Then why are you still in the club? If you just wanted to play, you could do it outside of the club.<br>Mizore: I don't know<br>Mizore: I don't know anything anymore<br> Mizore and Kumiko then return to their rooms. Kumiko lies in her bed thinking about how competitions have effected her life. Both the pain but also the happiness from winning them. Kumiko thinks about what must have happened to Mizore for her to come to hate competitions. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Asuka a shit as usual  <br>Taki is such a best ;-;</br>  <br> Asuka did nothing wrong <br><br>This scene takes place between Asuka and Mizore on the last day of band camp, with Kumiko listening in on their conversation of course.<br><br>Mizore:.....I’m sorry<br>Asuka: I told you not to worry about it Mizore-chan<br>Mizore: But, at this rate, Asuka senpai you’re going to become a villain<br>Asuka: But you’re still afraid right? It’d be much worse if this leads to trouble during the competition.<br>Mizore: I don’t know myself why I’m afraid. Nozomi didn’t do anything wrong<br>Asuka: It’s true that kid didn’t do anything wrong. But, Mizore chan, you didn’t do anything wrong either<br>Mizore:.... I’m sorry<br>Asuka: ahh, why are you still apologizing?<br> Asuka and Mizore start walking further away from where they are. Kumiko wants to keep listening but she realizes that this conversation is not something she should be peeping on and runs away as fast as she can as to stop herself from coming back. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is a really important scene between Kumiko and Asuka because it shows how much their relationship has changed since the first volume. Kumiko waits until the cafeteria is mostly empty and approaches Asuka who is still eating. This is the scene where Asuka reveals why she hasnt been letting Nozomi back into the club to Kumiko. <br><br>Kumiko: um, Asuka senpai<br>Asuka: hm?<br>Kumiko: I have something to ask you<br>Asuka: What do you need to ask?<br>Kumiko: It’s about Nozomi senpai though<br>Asuka: oh it’s about Nozomi-chan? Okay okay<br>Kumiko: um, why wont you approve Nozomi chan coming back to the club?<br>Asuka: hrm, so it’s about that.... well why do you think I should?<br>Kumiko: well, because Nozomi is very talented. We had the incident between Kaori Senpai and Reina, so maybe you’re worried about another incident between upper and lower classmen... I think<br>Asuka: ah, okay. I see<br> Asuka gives an expression that shows she really wasn’t listening to what Kumiko was saying which annoys her a little <br>Kumiko: Please tell me then<br> Asuka starts laughing <br>Asuka: I’m sorry. Well, I’ll tell you but before that there’s something I need to ask you<br>Kumiko: What is it?<br>Asuka: If I tell you, what do you plan to do? Are you planning to tell Nozomi-chan?<br>Kumiko: S-should I not?<br>Asuka: It’s fine if you tell her. It’s just that I think it might be a bit painful for you to do so.<br>Kumiko: What do you mean by painful?<br>Asuka: Just like the word means. Well no matter what I say you’ll still want to do so I’ll tell you<br>Kumiko: Please tell me<br>Asuka: That’s what I was planning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka scrapes her fork against her plate, a high pitch screech rings out <br>Asuka: Mizore chan, she can’t handle Nozomi chan<br>Kumiko: Really? What do you mean?<br>Asuka: It’s what I said. Mizore-chan seems to have some trauma towards Nozomi chan and just by looking at her makes Mizore-chan sick. That’s why until the competition is over, Nozomi-chan can’t come back. If she has an effect on my dear Oboe, it’ll mean trouble.<br>Kumiko: What do you mean by trauma? Nozomi senpai and Mizore senpai have been close since middle school haven’t they? I heard the reason why Mizore senpai joined the club was because Nozomi senpai invited her.<br>Asuka: Well<br>Kumiko: huh?<br>Asuka: Nozomi-chan wouldn’t even dream that Mizore-chan was avoiding her. Infact she still thinks of her as her close childhood friend. Despite that, do you think you could tell Nozomi to her face that Mizore can’t stand being around Nozomi? Even I’m not that much of a monster.<br>Kumiko:.... so that’s why you’re against Nozomi coming back to the club?<br>Asuka: That’s right. No matter what, our club only has one oboe player. If I had to choose bewtween those two, who do you think I should pick?<br> Kumiko feels like she’s being lectured like a child right now. Asuka gets up and pats her on the back. <br>Asuka: my my, don’t sulk so much. This is a problem between those two and maybe by some chance it’ll be resolved. It might not be fair to Nozomi but she’ll have to wait until that happens though.<br>Kumiko:....okay<br> Asuka starts rubbing Kumiko’s hair. Kumiko feels like Asuka is treating her like a dog now. <br>Kumiko: Senpai<br> Satisfied, Asuka stops rubbing Kumiko hair <br>Kumiko: When Nozomi senpai was about to quit, why did you stop her?<br>Asuka: Well isn’t it obvious that I would stop my beloved kouhai from trying to quit?<br>Kumiko: Can you stop with that? I know you’re not that kind of person <br>Asuka: oh my, how harsh<br>Asuka: It’s because Nozomi is a talented person of course. Kids with talent might become useful to me in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Best Natsuki scene <br><br>Kumiko is late at school practicing again but instead of Mizore remaining, its strangely Natsuki who is still at school. Since they’re together, Natsuki decides go home together with Kumiko. They talk a a bit about how the seniors are must have it rough since they have college exams to take too. Natsuki brings up how Asuka has the best grades in the entire school despite still practicing so much. Then Kumiko asks Natsuki<br><br>Kumiko: Senpai, why did you join the Wind Ensemble club in highschool?<br>Natsuki: hrm, why are you asking about that?<br>Kumiko: ahh, no real reason<br>Natsuki: I was in the Go Home club in middle school. Three years, I had a lot of free time. So when I entered high school, I decided to join an easy club.<br>Kumiko: So you joined the Wind Ensemble club?<br>Natsuki: That’s right. Wind ensembles, there’s a lot of people so they’re famous for slacking off<br> Kumiko thinks that can’t be right while Natsuki runs a bit ahead of her. <br>Kumiko: Senpai, why did you give Nozomi the music sheet for our competition?<br>Natsuki: What’s with that all of a sudden?<br> Natsuki starts laughing as if to deceive Kumiko <br>Kumiko: Also, why are you trying to make peace between Asuka senpai and Nozomi Senpai?<br>Natsuki: There’s not really a reason. It’s just that she told me that she wanted to come back to the club, so helping her out is the least I could do...<br>Kumiko: I know that much is a lie<br> Whether Kumiko suddenly grew a spine or if it was another slip of tongue she doesn’t know. Natsuki is wide eyed but fixes a smile <br>Natsuki: and what do you plan to do knowing that?<br>Kumiko: I’ve been talking to a lot of the second year students and I now I decided that I want to help. Like you, I want to help Nozomi senpai get back into the club. But after talking to everyones stories, I’m not sure if that’s the right thing to do anymore.<br>Natsuki:.... so now you want to hear my story?<br>Kumiko: Yes<br> Nozomi stops walking and they’re standing in the parking lot of the train station </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Natsuki: Nozomi, I’ve always admired her<br>Kumiko: Admire?<br>Natsuki:Yeah, admire<br> Natsuki starts to blush a little at what she just said <br>Natsuki: I don’t like bothersome things so I’ve always avoided things like clubs. That was pretty fun and comfortable. But, during my middle school graduation ceremony, I thought to myself. Just what have I done these three years?<br>Natsuki: Nozomi was the president of the wind ensemble club, the exact opposite of me, hot blooded and passionate. During the graduation ceremony all of the kids from the Wind Ensemble club were crying and I thought they were all idiots since they were going to the same highschool anyway.<br> But says Natsuki <br>Natsuki: I was a little jealous of them. So in highschool I decided to join the same club as them. And then before I realized it, I ended up playing this strange instrument called a euphonium.<br>Kumiko: You really like Nozomi senpai don’t you?<br> Natsuki smiles without saying anything and they start walking again, Kumiko by Natsuki’s side this time <br>Natsuki: Kitauji’s Wind Ensemble club had a rotten atmosphere but to me it was a pretty comfortable place. There wasn’t a lot of practice and it was easy. But Nozomi didn’t think that and defied the Senpai. Watching her, I was honestly a bit surprised. Spending all that effort on a bunch of people who weren’t going to listen to you? That’s a huge waste of time right? Despite that she clashed with time like an idiot. If only she could’ve just weathered the storm and waited until she was a third year.<br>Kumiko: Her patience wore out I guess<br>Natsuki: So that’s when a bunch of kids starting talking about wanting to quit the club. I thought that it couldn’t be helped. The way the senpai felt about them was pretty blunt, and then the ignoring incident happened. They treated them like they weren’t even in the club. So even if those kids quit, nothing would change.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Natsuki pauses for a bit to think about something and then spills a smile <br>Natsuki: I got a little pissed off so I said some pretty rude stuff to the third years<br>Kumiko: What did they say?<br>Natsuki: hrm? Well it wasn’t really that big of a deal. Something like “you’re all crap”<br>Kumiko: huh?<br> Kumiko thinks thats a pretty damn big deal <br>Natsuki: That period was really horrible. Because of what I said to the third years, we became the targets of the third year. I really caused a lot of trouble for Riko and Gotou. Goto in particular is still pissed off about how Riko got hurt, so even now he doesnt talk about what happened in the past. Asuka senpai managed to talk to the third year students out of it so things were finally resolved peacefully.<br>Kumiko: So that’s the reason why Gotou doesn’t like to talk about the first year incident?<br>Natsuki: Right. Well, he also just doesn’t want to tell the first years about this horrible incident. Gotou’s, he’s a good guy. His personality is a bit gloomy though. <br> Natsuki tries to hide the fact that she’s blushing a little after what she just said <br>Natsuki: So that’s the whole story. There’s this incomplete burning feeling in me about how Nozomi senpai quit the club, I haven’t accepted it yet. So that’s why when she said she wanted to come back, I felt relieved.<br>Kumiko: Because now you two can be in the club together again?<br>Natsuki: well, there’s that too<br> While on the platform, a train rushes passes them. The light shining on Natsuki’s face, dying it red <br>Natsuki: I wanted to atone for my sins<br> The train exits the station, the wind pressure blows Natsuki’s hair. Natsuki starts to walk forward, as if to avoid looking at Kumiko. <br>Kumiko: What do you mean by atone for for your sins? You haven’t committed any crimes<br> Natsuki doesn’t turn around but begins to speak </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Natsuki: In the end, I didn’t do anything for her, even though I felt the pain she was in. I just watched from a distance. I wanted to do something for her. Nozomi really loves playing you know. With all her heart. I didn’t want to see the girl I admired be in that much pain.<br><br>Kumiko: So that’s why you’re trying to help her?<br>Nozomi: That’s right<br> It’s a hopeless and pathetic reason don’t you think says Natsuki. Natsuki’s is forcing her voice to be cheerful but it’s still pained. <br>Kumiko: It’s not pathetic at all<br> Kumiko’s voice is her shaky Kumiko voice. Upon hearing that, Natsuki turns around and looks at Kumiko with surprised eyes. Natsuki gently puts her hand on Kumiko’s hair <br>Natsuki: Sorry, for making you worry about me<br>Kumiko: There’s nothing to apologize for, you haven’t done anything wrong<br>Natsuki: Kumiko, you’re a good kid<br><br>Best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  nice  While doing some self practice, Nozomi finds Kumiko. Kumiko is relieved that Mizore isn’t anywhere to be found. This is the start of a horrible chain of disasters that leads to the finale.<br><br>Nozomi: It’s almost time for the concert<br>Kumiko: Senpai, long time no see<br>Nozomi: It’s right before the concert, so I didn’t want to bother your practice. There’s only three days until the Kansai tournament right?<br>Kumiko: You’re not going to see Asuka senpai today?<br>Nozomi: I went, but she already went home<br>Nozomi: Hey, about Mizore, how is she doing?<br>Kumiko: Mi-Mizore senpai?<br>Nozomi: I heard lately that Mizore has been having trouble with her solo part. I thought about giving her some advice.<br>Kumiko: ahh, well, umm, yes. That’s true. Umm, she’s been told she needs to put more emotion into her solo when playing.<br> Kumiko is trying her best to cover up whats going on <br>Nozomi: They said that to her? That’s strange<br>Kumiko: What’s strange?<br>Nozomi: Well Mizore, she’s a very quiet person, but when she plays, it’s like an explosion. This is so fun! kind of feeling.<br>Kumiko: Is that so?<br>Nozomi: Yep. That’s why I think something must’ve happened.<br> Kumiko now understands that to what Asuka means by Nozomi thinking that Mizore is still her close friend and that she hasn’t realized what is going on. That’s why nobody can tell her the truth. Asuka’s words ring in Kumiko’s ear about how Mizore and Nozomi can’t meet. <br>Nozomi: I hope I can help out Mizore<br><br>And then two days later, it happens</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The day before the competition during rehearsal<br><br>Nozomi: MIZORE!<br> Nozomi’s voice echoes down the hallway. The sound of frantic slippers can be heard. The voices of students gossiping. Mizore runs out of the music room. Nozomi: MIZORE! WAIT! <br> Nozomi screams from the doorway with her arms reaching out towards Mizore’s fleeing back. Nozomi stands there and watches as Mizore disappears. <br>Asuka: You’re the worst<br>Yuuko: Hold it! What the hell are you doing?<br> Yuuko is gripping Nozomi by her collar with both arms. Nozomi is shocked at what’s going on because she has no clue. <br>Yuuko: Why are you going this far to hurt Mizore?<br>Nozomi: wait, I didn’t do...<br>Natsuki: Hold on, Yuuko, what are you doing!?<br> Natsuki tears off Yuuko’s arms from Nozomi’s collar. Without calming down, Yuuko lashes out and shoves both of them. Natsuki and Nozomi both fall to the ground. <br>Natsuki: The hell you doing?<br> Natsuki is angrily glaring at Yuuko, different than what usually goes on between them. Natsuki is probably really angry thought Kumiko. <br>Natsuki: What are you trying to say Nozomi is doing? And I can’t believe you’re being so violent all of a sudden.<br>Yuuko: I’m not angry because she did something, I’m angry because she didn’t do anything!<br>Natsuki: Haa? I don’t get what you’re saying<br> Yuuko is looking back at Natsuki with the same angry glare, like they were natural enemies. Kumiko takes a look at their surrounding which is still in the classroom and decides to take a step back from the situation but Yuuko suddenly grabs onto Kumiko’s arm. <br>Yuuko: Are you going to look for Mizore?<br>Kumiko: ha?<br>Yuuko: If Mizore runs into someone while in that panicking state with someone who doesn’t know her, it’ll be a disaster. Hurry up and go look for her.<br>Kumiko: ahh, that, umm<br>Yuuko: I’ll look in the third and fourth floor, you go look at the first and second floor<br>Kumiko: R-roger!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good. Now summarize vol 3 I want the exact details where Asuka gets bitch slapped by her mum.  <br> Kumiko looks into Yuuko’s eyes. Besides anger, Kumiko can see that Yuuko has other emotions mixed into them and it’s a look that Kumiko knows too well. Yuuko lets go of Kumiko’s arm <br>Yuuko: Hurry up and go then<br>Asuka: Kumiko chan<br> Kumiko turns around <br>Asuka:This was an error in my judgment. Anyway, hurry up and find Mizore<br> Kumiko wonders what she means by error in judgment, and what the heck happened in the first place. Kumiko’s head is filled with questions but she prioritizes finding Mizore first. Kumiko runs throughout the first and second floor, covered in sweat by the time she reaches the last room. And what do you know, it’s the abandoned run down drama club room. From the doorway, Kumiko hears Mizore trying to catch her breath. Kumiko finds Mizore, balled up like she was during the last time she saw her on the stairs. Mizore covers her face with her hands when Kumiko walks towards her. <br>Kumiko: Senpai, um, what happened?<br> Kumiko sits down next to Mizore despite how much dust has gathered up in this abandoned room <br>Kumiko: Do you hate Nozomi senpai?<br> Hearing that name, Mizore raises her face slowly and stops covering her face with her hands <br>Mizore: I don’t <br> Mizore’s voice is horribly scratchy. Some time passes before she speaks again <br>Mizore: I don’t hate her, it’s not like that, at all<br>Kumiko: Then what happened? Did Nozomi senpai say something horrible to you-?<br>Mizore: No!<br> Mizore suddenly speaks out, surprising Kumiko <br>Mizore: No, Nozomi, isn’t bad. I’m the one who’s bad.<br> Kumiko gets a good look at Mizore’s face and notices her skin looks like the scarlet light filtering through the red curtains <br>Mizore:......Just now, Nozomi came to talk to me. And then, I got scared and ran without thinking. It’s because I’m afraid of seeing Nozomi. I don’t want to see her. So that’s why I hid.<br>Kumiko: Why are you afraid?<br>Mizore: Because then I’ll understand<br>Kumiko: Understand what?<br>Mizore: Understand the reality</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore: I never had interest in the Wind Ensemble club. Never planned on playing any instruments<br>Kumiko: Then why did you join the club?<br>Mizore: Because Nozomi invited me<br> Mizore lowers her eyes, as if she was trying to run from something <br>Mizore: I’m... afraid of talking with people. My personality is depressing, I never had any friends in middle, I was always alone. But, Nozomi talked to me. “Lets play instruments together” she said. So then, my life changed. Being with Nozomi was fun.<br> Mizore wraps her arms around herself tighter, her nails digging into her arms. Kumiko feels like there’s a transparent wall between the two of them <br>Mizore: Nozomi is special. She’s my dearest friend.<br> But says Mizore. Kumiko notices there’s a bit of red mixed into Mizore’s black eyes <br>Mizore: No that’s wrong. What Nozomi means to me and what I mean to Nozomi are completely different things. To me, Nozomi is my number one best friend. But to Nozomi, I’m just another one of her friends. Nozomi has lots of friends, I’m just one of them. It’d be the same if I wasn’t around.<br>Kumiko: T-that’s not true. Just recently, Nozomi senpai was worried about you Mizore senpai, and there’s....<br>Mizore: But when she quit the club, she didnt say anything to moe<br>Mizore: Even though she she asked everyone else. It was just like that in band. I didn’t know anything. When I asked another senpai “Is Nozomi taking a day off from club today”, I was told that she quit the club. That’s how I found out. It was a shock. Extreme. I mean, that means our relationship wasn’t worth enough to tell me these things.<br> Kumiko scrambles to find the words to say even though they don’t exist. Time passes but Kumiko still cannot respond </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore: I also joined the highschool Wind Ensemble club because Nozomi invited me. She and I are different types of people, so I thought if we didn’t have the club between us, our relationship would end right there. But in the end Nozomi quit. I don’t understand why I’m still in the club though. I really don’t know.<br>Kumiko: B-but! Senpai, you come earlier than anyone to practice. It’s because you love to play right?<br>Mizore: I was afraid<br>Kumiko: huh?<br>Mizore: That if I don’t play, Nozomi wouldn’t need me as a friend. This instrument is the only thing that connects me and Nozomi. This is all I have. I don’t have anything else. If I can’t play well, Nozomi will think I’m useless. That’s why. That’s why I play.<br> Kumiko is now at a loss for words. This is the first time Kumiko has ever met a person who plays for such a reason. People play to get good results at competitions or to be cool (Reina I’m looking at you). Kumiko thinks that the reason she and Mizore play are much too different. That if we’re all aiming for Nationals, this isn’t a time to be thinking about friendship. <br>Mizore: I’m... afraid of seeing Nozomi. Nozomi probably doesn’t think anything of this. She hasn’t done anything wrong. She thinks that just leaving the club like that on a whim wasn’t the wrong thing to do. But I’m afraid of coming face to face with this reality. I’m afraid of being stabbed with the fact that I’m not anything important to her.<br> Mizore covers her face again and groans <br>Mizore: It’s disgusting. To be obsessed with a friend this way.<br>Kumiko: It isn’t<br>Mizore: I think it’s disgusting. I think I’m disgusting<br> Mizore buries her face into her lap, her hair covering her face completely </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore: I wish competitions would disappear. If that would happen, then Nozomi wouldn’t have disappeared. She wouldn’t have cried over not being able to accept what happened with our results. It’s idiotic. How everyone is so obsessed with this stuff. No matter how much you try, there’s nothing fun. There’s nothing left. Just the feeling of pain.<br>  The door slams open. I’ve been looking all over for you says a voice from the doorway. Kumiko turns around. Standing in the doorway is Yuuko, covered in sweat, her hair a mess. Kumiko wonders how many times Yuuko must’ve ran around the school considered she started on the fourth floor. Yuuko walks quickly towards Mizore, brushing her uphevealed bangs to the side. Kumiko takes a step back from the intensity and even Mizore shrieks a little bit. Yuuko puts both her hands on Mizore’s shoulders. <br>Yuuko: What the hell are you doing!? I’ve been so worried<br> Mizore taken back by that says she’s sorry. Yuuko takes deep breath <br>Yuuko: What did Nozomi say to you?<br>Mizore: Nothing, she just came to give me advice<br> I just got scared on my own replies Mizore. Mizore looks down. Yuuko takes her hands off Mizore’s shoulders and holds her hands. Yuuko gently squeezes them and tells Mizore to look. <br>Yuuko: Are you still afraid of talking to Nozomi?<br> Mizore nods <br>Mizore: after all, Nozomi is all I have. If she’s not around, I can’t do anything. That’s why I’m afraid of being rejected.<br> Yuuko stops holding Mizore’s hands and then Mizore’s eyes frightenly shuts her eyes. Yuuko takes a deep breath and then claps Mizore’s cheeks together with both her hands  <br>Yuuko: Idiot<br> Mizore timidly opens her eyes and looks at Yuuko. Mizore’s eyes are suddenly overflowing with emotion, turning pink like her cheeks which are pressed between Yuuko’s hands </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuko: Hey, is Nozomi really your only friend? Just because she was the first person to rescue you, that makes her a special friend to you? Does that mean everyone else means nothing to you?<br>Mizore: That’s not it...<br>Yuuko: What about me? What am I to you?<br> the sun is setting, the lights in the room falling.  <br>Mizore: Yuuko, you’re only being nice to me because you think I’m pathetic right? Nozomi left me, so you thought I was pitiful by myself. You were just pitying me. Right?<br> Mizore turns her eyes away immediately as she says that. Like if she was actually asking that to herself and not to Yuuko, thought Kumiko. Yuuko takes her hands off Mizore’s cheeks and instantly pulls both of Mizore’s ears. Yuuko shouts, point blank to Mizore’s face <br>Yuuko: ARE YOU AN IDIOT? You really are an idiot. Will you cut this crap out already?<br>Mizore:...that hurts<br> Mizore mumbles that as a response to having her ears pulled like that but Yuuko ignores her <br>Yuuko: I wouldn’t think of hanging out with someone I didn’t like just because I felt like it. I wouldn’t be able to do something like that. Pity, what is that supposed to mean? Don’t you think of me as your friend?<br>Mizore: It’s not that. But...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuko: Club is like that too. Are you really only still playing for Nozomi’s sake? Have you never had any fun or felt happy? Didnt you feel the pain of competition? What about the Kyoto tournament? When it was decided we made it to Kansai, weren’t you happy?<br> I was happy says Mizore, straining her voice to the point of losing her breath. It seems that Yuuko’s passionate words has finally gotten through to Mizore thinks Kumiko. <br>Yuuko: I was happy we got this far. That our effort didn’t go to waste. That our hard work paid off. I was finally able to think that. I felt like we were finally able to escape from our memories of middle school. Don’t you think so Mizore too? Didn’t you feel anything?<br> Mizore shuts her mouth and grips the hem of Yuuko’s uniform. Then Mizore spits out <br>Mizore:.... I was happy. I really was. But at the same time, I feel guilty about the people who quit. Is it okay to be happy?<br>Yuuko: of course it is.<br>  replies Yuuko immediately <br>Yuuko: Of course it’s okay to be happy about something like that. There isn’t anyone in the world who would want you to be sad. At the very least, I don’t want you to be sad. So smile.<br> Embracing those words, Mizore takes a deep breath. Her lips are quivering as she bites down onto them. Large tears start to flow down her face. Yuuko spreads her arms and Mizore buries her face in Yuuko’s shoulders, and starts crying outloud. <br>Yuuko:.... hey<br> after some time, Mizore’s tears have finally stopped. Kumiko who has been standing there watching this whole thing wonders if she’s being a bother. Taking notice to that, Yuuko turns to Kumiko and says <br>Yuuko: It seems like Mizore’s calmed down so can you call the people who are waiting outside?<br> As Yuuko says that, Kumiko looks to the door to see that they have been peeping on them from the crack. Kumiko slides it open <br>Kumiko: What’re you two doing?<br> Natsuki and Nozomi both look at eachother with a “we’re busted” expression. Nozomi is hugging Mizore’s oboe case. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nozomi: Ah..... Asuka told me to bring this<br> Nozomi walks into the room. Natsuki worriedly looks at Kumiko as Natsuki doesn’t know what has happened just yet. Nozomi walks up to Mizore and looks at her. Mizore rubs her eyes, which are still red and swollen <br>Nozomi: Mizore, did I do something bad to you? I can’t think of anything I might’ve done though<br> Mizore holds onto Yuuko’s arm. Yuuko takes a deep breath and takes Mizore’s hand off of her and pulls Mizore onto her feet. <br>Yuuko: Talk to her about it<br>Mizore: Huh? But...<br>Yuuko: It’ll be okay, I’m here with you<br> Yuuko walks Mizore to Nozomi, Mizore holds onto Yuuko’s uniform <br>Mizore: No-Nozomi, why didn’t you tell me to come with you?<br>Nozomi: Come with me when?<br>Mizore: When you quit the club<br>Nozomi: That’s because I didn’t have a reason to tell you to<br>Mizore......why didn’t you?<br>Nozomi: Well because you were always trying to hard in club. Even when I became a bad apple, you were always practicing. Even when there wasn’t anyone to praise you for it, even when nobody else was practicing with you, you were always diligently practicing by yourself. So why would I tell you to quit the club? That would be an insult to all the work you’ve put into playing<br> Mizore’eyes flicker with relief. Mizore lets go of Yuuko’s uniform. <br>Mizore: So that’s why you didn’t say anything?<br>Nozomi: Hrm? Well yeah<br> Nozomi also has relief written on her face <br>Nozomi: Don’t tell me that I made you feel left out because of that. It’s not like that at all. I would never hate you, ever. I’m sorry, this was a misunderstanding.<br> The flustered voice of Nozomi is both light and beautiful. Kumiko thinks the difference in their personalities, Nozomi being hot and Mizore being cold, is why Nozomi can be this innocent around Mizore. I’m sorry I didn’t realize this says Nozomi. It’s fine says Mizore.  <br>Mizore: There wasn’t a misunderstanding<br>Nozomi: You sure? I didn’t do anything awful?<br>Mizore: mhm. It’s fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi shouts out happily. Kumiko looks a bit down, wondering if Mizore is going to keep her feelings about Nozomi to herself. Nozomi then says shly says to Mizore <br>Nozomi: You know, I actually went to the Kyoto Tournament to see you play<br>Mizore: You did?<br>Nozomi: Yep. And there, I was so jealous. Everyone was so radiant. Your solo was so cool too.<br>Mizore:.... really?<br> Mizore looks to the case in Nozomi’s hand and with a smile on her face Nozomi waves it by the handle to Mizore  <br>Nozomi: It really was, why would I lie about it? I’ve always loved the sound of your oboe, since middle school. How should it put it... just by listening to you play, my heart starts pounding. It’s like I’m the one who is having fun.<br>Mizore: Do you really think that?<br>Nozomi: I do. That’s why I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s performance at the competition too. You might be in a bit of a slump right now but if it’s you Mizore, I just know you’ll be able to pull off a great performance.<br> Nozomi hands Mizore her case. Mizore hugs her oboe case tightly. Without trying to hide how red her cheeks are, Mizore looks straight at Nozomi <br>Mizore: If it’s fine with you, would you like to practice with me? I want you to listen to my solo<br>Nozomi: Do you even need to ask?<br> Upon hearing that, Mizore bursts into a smile. Kumiko gets caught up in the moment and smiles too. These two are going to be fine from now on thinks Kumiko. Suddenly, Yuuko grabs Kumiko and is drags both her and Natsuki out of the room. Natsuki is not okay with being dragged by Yuuko though. <br>Yuuko: Well then Mizore, you can go home ahead without us<br> Mizore nods and Nozomi waves bye without shifting her attention from Mizore. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuuko: You two should really be able to read the mood when something like that happens. You two need to pay attention.<br>Natsuki: Here she goes again! Trying to show off how more mature and caring she is at worrying about other people!<br>Yuuko: Huh? Natsuki, you picking a fight?<br>Natsuki: Not really picking anything. I was just thinking that just this reminds me of something<br>Yuuko: Uwah, what are you even trying to say? I’ve been thinking this for a while but isn’t the attitude you have towards me too rude?<br>Natsuki: Can’t be helped, you make me feel irritated<br>Yuuko: That’s absurd! No way!<br> Looks like things are back to normal between them thinks Kumiko as she keeps walking away noticing how dark it’s gotten outside <br>Yuuko: ah<br> Everyone turns around and stops talking. A familiar sound fills the air. It’s the sound of Mizore’s oboe. The echoing of her notes down the hallway sound divine.  <br>Natsuki: Is this, Mizore?<br>Yuuko: It’s beautiful isn’t it. Mizore can play like this.<br> Yuuko looks down the hallway <br>Yuuko: In the end, Mizore was always playing for Nozomi’s sake.<br> Yuuko grips her skirts <br>Yuuko: To be honest, Nozomi really pisses me off<br>Natsuki: Why?<br> Natsuki looks at Yuuko with amazement. It’s not often that Yuuko is honest with herself. <br>Yuuko: Think about it, even though Mizore was going through all that pain, Nozomi didn’t realize a thing. Mizore has been always worried about it since Nozomi quit the club. Look at what just happened before, when a friend starts running, shouldn’t you be chasing after them? It isn’t time to just be standing dumbfounded in the hallway like that.<br>Natsuki: So that’s why you grabbed Nozomi? You really are short tempered<br>Yuuko: That’s just the kind of person I am<br>Natsuki: Well it would be kind of gross if you were to suddenly become a good girl<br>Yuuko: Uwah, what are you saying? I’m already a good girl.<br>Natsuki: is that how it is?<br> Natsuki breaks out in laughter as she teases Yuuko but Yuuko shrugs her shoulders. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuko: In the end, I couldn’t win against Nozomi. Even though we were together for a whole year. Even then, Mizore’s most important person was still Nozomi.<br>Natsuki: Well that can’t be helped, Nozomi’s a 100 times nicer girl than you are.<br> Yuuko shrugs even more <br>Yuuko: You don’t need to say it, I already know that<br>Natsuki: But you know<br> Natsuki turns away from Yuuko <br>Natsuki: I think Mizore was glad you were around Yuuko. If you weren’t, I think Mizore would’ve fallen apart sooner. Probably.<br> Yuuko is at a loss for words and then suddenly changes to a mischievous smile. Without trying to hide how flustered she is, Yuuko moves sneakily behind Natsuki and starts poking her. <br>Yuuko: What’s that? Are you trying to comfort me or something?<br>Natsuki: Haa? No that’s not it<br>Yuuko: Not being very honest are you. You’re always so rude to me, but you really love me don’t you?<br>Natsuki: Ugh, you’re so annoying. What’s with you.<br>Yuuko: ahh, okay okay. It’s fine to be embarassed<br>Natsuki: Annoying, so annoying!<br> Yuuko laughs at Natsuki with a pleasant smile on her face while Natsuki is quite openly disgusted. Kumiko leaves those two alone and walks away with a smile spilling out of her face towards the music room. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kumiko returns to the music room to find that everyone has left except for Asuka<br><br>Asuka: Kumiko chan, good work<br>Kumiko: Senpai, were you waiting?<br>Asuka: Well I guess<br> Asuka looks out of the room to see Natsuki and Yuuko still bantering <br>Asuka: Ahh, we should just leave those two alone for now. So, how did it go? Did Mizore and Nozomi make up?<br>Kumiko: Yes, more or less<br>Asuka: Is that right? Well then good<br> Asuka sighs with relief. Kumiko asks Asuka <br>Kumiko: The one who told Nozomi senpai to bring the oboe case was you right? Why did you do that?<br>Asuka: Hrm? Well, simply put, this was the only chance for them to make up.<br>Kumiko: I see<br>Asuka: I was planning to keep Mizore chan and Nozomi chan apart until after the competition was over though. But since that plan got blown apart in the music room, I had to do something about it right?. So that’s why I decided to do things directly. It’s called shock therapy.<br> In the end, everything was okay! says Asuka with a fearsome smile. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka: Well, the MVP for this time was Yuuko. If she wasn’t around, things wouldn’t have gone so well<br>Kumiko: Yuuko senpai, she’s always been worried about Mizore-senpai<br>Asuka: Well, there’s that but Mizore-chan is just a very dishonest person<br>Kumiko: Dishonest? What do you mean?<br>Asuka: The reason why Mizore chan is so insistent on Nozomi chan is because she’s actually just afraid of being alone. That’s why she would’ve just realized that she had Yuuko by her side, she would’ve been able to face Nozomi-chan like she just did now. Even if Nozomi-chan rejects her, as long as she has Yuuko, she won’t be alone. Well, to Mizore chan, Yuuko would basically be a back up I suppose.<br> Kumiko is at a loss for words, and honestly quite offended with Asuka just said. What Asuka is saying isn’t right thinks Kumiko. <br>Kumiko:.... Mizore senpai isn’t that kind of person.<br>Asuka: You sure? I think people’s actions are decided by calculations though. But if you don’t open your eyes you won’t realize this.<br>Kumiko: You’re just too shrewd<br> Asuka just laughs at what Kumiko says. Kumiko wonders what Asuka must see in the world to think this way and how scary it must be.  <br>Kumiko: So can Nozomi senpai come back to the club?<br>Asuka: Well, yeah. There’s no reason to stop her anymore.<br>Kumiko: That’s great<br> From behind somebody calls Kumiko’s name <br>Reina: Kumiko, let’s go home <br>Asuka: Looks like it’s time for us to both go then<br>Kumiko: Ah, okay<br>Asuka: Let’s do our best at tomorrow’s performance<br> <br>Also if anyone read my earlier spoilers, I made a mistake when I wrote that Nozomi wasn’t allowed to come back to the club until next year just in case. That’s what I get for writing things from memory at 5am. Nozomi is back in the club she just isn’t allowed into the A-team* until next year because reasons and stuff. She and Natsuki practice together in the B-team throughout volume 3. I was wondering why Nozomi was still around in club when I re-read volume 3.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Final Nozomi Mizore scene for the volume go! <br>Everyone is standing around, getting ready to go on stage and perform. <br><br>Nozomi: Mizore<br> Mizore turns around to see Mizore whispering her name. Nozomi starts to walk towards Mizore with a music sheet in her hand. Nozomi’s hair which is usually in a ponytail is in a wave perm today. <br>Nozomi: Good luck on the solo<br>Mizore:.....Okay <br> Mizore blows lightly into her oboe <br>Mizore: I play for your sake Nozomi, so I want you to listen<br>Nozomi: Got it<br> Nozomi says with a smile. She starts to pat Mizore on the head, her fingers running through her hair <br>Nozomi: I’m looking foward to it<br>Mizomi: Yeah<br> Unlimited budget works ten page long performance intensifies with a wonderful oboe solo. Extremely narrow gold victory secured because the story can’t end here in volume 2. Another huge ass trophey for Asuka and Haruka to carry because they don’t enough enough trophies. <br>  Kumiko finds Mizore after the celebration and asks her <br>Kumiko: Senpai, do you still hate competitions?<br>Mizore: Just now fell in love with them<br> Mizore smiles, Kumiko thinks that this is the first time she’s ever seen Mizore this happy before. <br><br>Volume 2 ends on this line<br><br>And that's about it. S2 one day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you so much.

You translate it and post a link.</br>  <br>well Reina loses her smile when she meets Niiyama sensei. She's like a sexy female Taki sensei who is a professional flute player. And Taki sensei is pretty fond of her because Niiyama is his kouhai from college.<br><br> Taki: For today and tomorrow, Niiyama Satomi sensei will be in charge of directing the woodwind section. She will also help direct the woodwind section after the training camp. <br> Taki: Tomorrow, Hashimoto sensei will also come to direct the percussion section. <br> Taki: The woodwind section will practice in the second hall, percussion and brass will be practicing here. Niiyama sensei might young but she is is extremely talented. Make sure to follow her orders. <br> Niiyama smiled shyly in response to what Taki sensei said <br> Niiyama: Extremely talented? You're not getting anything from flattering me you know <br> Taki: of course not, but I am only saying what is true <br> Niiyama: oh my, well I'm happy to hear that then Taki sensei <br> the club members watched with a cool gaze as the gorgeous couple in front of them scattered an air of freshness. <br> Curious as to what Reina was thinking, Kumiko turned her head to the trumpet section. Reina was watching the couple with eyes that greatly resembled a dead fish. <br><br>But she gets it back later when Kumiko finds out that  Niiyama sensei is married </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn, if they make a second season it's gonna be filled with Yuri.<br>Gotta make you wonder why they'd go for Reina and Kumiko this season when they have the least potential.</br>  <br>Thank you so much. Nozomi is now my favorite girl, god she's such a goof ball and hotheaded idiot but like her. Also the Natsuki/Yuuko parts were intense and adorable.</br>  <br><br>I want Reina yandere moments next season.</br></br>  I want more added Yuuko/Natsuki bantering. they are epic.  <br>Kumiko is a good friend</br>  <br>this scene happens after dinner at band camp. Ribbon is wearing a fluffy parka and short pants and then suddenly Natsuki out of nowhere<br><br>Natsuki: Whats with that outfit? Why'd you choose that?<br>Yuuko: I don't want to hear that from someone wearing such a shitty t-shirt with a lame design<br>Natsuki is wearing a black t-shirt under her track suit<br>Natsuki: What's lame about my shirt?<br>Yuuko: That english on your shirt, it says "I am addicted to cement"<br>Natsuki: Look who's talking, that frilly logo on your pocket says "my staple food is love"<br>Yuuko: Stop speaking in english! This is Japan!<br>Natsuki: Aren't you the one who brought this up?<br>Yuuko: Shut up. What's that, is it possible that you want to care about me?<br>Yuukoi: ugh, you're so creepy. I get goosebumps when you say weird stuff like that<br>Yuuko: That's it! It's time for another showdown!<br>Natsuki: ah, okay okay, You haven't learned your lesson yet from every other loss though.<br>Yuuko: I'm going to win this year. I'll be waiting in my room!<br>Natsuki: If you lose again this year, it's going to be so sad (smug sound)<br>Yuuko: Why won't this girl shut up? She's so annoying<br>Natsuki: I can't beat you in being the most annoying though<br><br>And then they went back to their room and had a sit up competition or so says Riko. They do this every time they go on a school trip because Natsuki and Yuuko always end up sharing a room.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Porn when?<br><br><br>Hahaha, jealous Reina is best Reina.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm addicted to semen <br><br>can't wait for the Season 2 photoshops</br></br></br>  <br> I am addicted to cement" <br><br>I read it as semen.</br></br></br>  <br><br>are you two addicted to semen?</br></br>  <br><br>y-you too!</br></br>  <br>new meme</br>  <br> Yuuko: Shut up.

They seem to have nice chemistry.  <br> Reina and Midori surprisingly hit it off, Reina likes Midori because she’s very talented and Midori likes Reina because Reina has big breast <br>Reina confirmed for biggest tits</br></br>  <br>They're friends but they don't ever become any closer than this since Nozomi spends more time hanging out with Natsuki and Mizore.</br>  <br>Asuka has the biggest boobs.</br>  <br>Ahh I see, so Nozomi just likes to tease her and that's it. I'm OK with that.</br>  Midori powerlevels off the chart. I wonder how her audition went?  Also at dinner at band camp, after hearing from Riko that Natsuki and Yuuko are going to have a sit up contest, Hazuki stands and up claims that there's nobody who could beat her in a sit up contest, and proves it by pulling her shirt up and showing everyone her abs. Everyone including Goto across from her who turns tomato red.<br><br>I fucking love the band camp arc</br></br>  Holy shit, Nozomi is another flute player. Why are there so many talented flute players in the club?  <br>Fucking based, Hazuki.</br>  <br>She's actually the best flute player.</br>  <br> most kyoAni heroine whose win the MCmalebowl are airhead <br> Hazuki doesn't have a chance to win <br>Poor Hazuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is she so perfect? <br><br>Does she get any meaningful stuff in volume 2?

Kumiko has sex with Shoe for the first time while wearing the hair flower ornament  That Buchou holding the Gold  <br>Why are all the hibikek so slutty?</br>  <br>outside of volume 1 she doesn't get any meaningful scenes. She gets a lot of her own sidestories in volume 4 to make up for that though. The sidestories are in first person too so they're better than screentime I suppose.</br>  <br>Haruka and Kaori get so little screentime in volume 2 since they had to make room for Nozomi and Mizore<br><br>Volume 3 though is great for them. When Asuka leaves, Kaori is the one who makes and names "Operation Bring Back Asuka". Which basically involves throwing Kumiko at Asuka until Asuka comes back.

So the novels only comprise Kumiko's first year in band? Are the novels finished then? The author doesn't think Kumiko's 2nd and 3rd years are worth writing about?  <br>Yeah, they're finished. It's only four volumes, and the fourth one is a collection of short stories.</br>  <br>They're not finished. They're on hold. She went back to finish school now that she could afford it after Hibike sales, she'll finish it once it's out and there's a chance that the Anime might cover it with her guidance, considering they sort of bought the rights to do that.<br><br>I CAN DREAM CAN'T I?!</br></br></br>  Any numbers on how much more sales the Hibike novels got due to the anime adaptation?  <br>I vaguely remember reading some posts about how they sold out but it could be bullshit.</br>  <br>Kyoani has a similar deal with the writer of Hyoka, where they will continue the adaptation at whatever pace the novels are finished at, and with the author's input. There's some option too for them to be able to release both around the same time, since the author can work with the sudio once they know how the next book will go, and they can start animation early so they can both sort of promote each other. It's part of what makes Kyoani different than other studios, that they can even make long term deals like this that are so favorable to authors.</br>  <br> Kyoani has a similar deal with the writer of Hyoka, where they will continue the adaptation at whatever pace the novels are finished at, and with the author's input. <br>Source?</br></br>  Which section and why?  <br>Not that anon, but you are fucking stupid.</br>  <br>my own harem on horny</br>  <br>Buchou section because best girl and saxophone is pretty cool.</br>  <br>4chan.org</br>  <br> The subplots of the second volume revolve around themes of friendship and how easy it is to lose a friend you considered very dear </br>    <br> both thinking that Mizore is a strange person and leave her be <br>oboe haibane.jpg<br><br> Kumiko feels like this is the second time she’s felt this way about a person since she joined the club. <br>Reina was the first?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>novelanon is so based<br><br><br> Nozomi gives in to Natsuki’s angry gaze <br>Why is Natsuki so mad?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi then takes a close look at Kumiko and says “you look like a real mischief maker” <br>What does she mean by that?</br></br>  <br> Riko suddenly stands up, knocking her chair to the ground. Gotou takes a big gulp. Nozomi looks to Kumiko and shrugs her shoulders. Midori and Hazuki both make eye contact, realizing how grave the situation is <br><br> all this drama  <br>jesus.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi: I want to return to the club! <br>I hate indecisive bitches.</br></br>  I want to have sex with this man.  <br>why, exactly?</br>  <br> man </br>  I hope that if it gets a second season, they play Carmina Burana.  <br>That outfit</br>  <br><br>Have you fucking looked at him?</br></br>  <br> Asuka:....

Not only is Asuka one of the best/special people in their band, she also has the personality trait that made Reina so fixated on Kumiko in the first place: a 'good girl' skin that hides a more cynical self, which occasionally, slips out.</br>  <br>Because Reina is only interested in Taki</br>  <br>The only reason Reina realized Kumiko is merely pretending is because Kumiko slipped up and told Reina her honest opinion in the middle school. Asuka is much smarter than Kumiko and doesn't reveal her real personality that easily. Reina is hardly a people's person, so she probably isn't even aware that Asuka isn't miss perfect.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tk-<wbr>5RVMerfI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That's actually a good question. Maybe Kumiko was closer to her since they went to the same school?</br>  <br>But anon it seems everyone knows Asuka is holding a tick mask.</br>  <br>We the audience know it, and Kumiko and Shuichi know it. But who else?<br><br>Haruka seems to dislike Asuka because Kaori is obsessed with her, but that's about it.<br><br>There was that one scene were Asuka sperged out and left to practice alone when Midori was being a bitch, and /a/ hated Asuka for weeks after that scene, but I don't think it affected the opinions of the other band members that much. Reina wasn't even present during that scene, was she?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ hated Asuka </br>  Just marathoned it and adored the hell out of it. Definitely felt like a return to form for KyoAni. Really hoping for a second season.  <br>It's absolutely disgusting, but it's true. After that episode aired the thread was filled with people shitting on her and calling her a bitch.</br>  <br>Come on you can't possible fall for the 3~4 tryhards shitposters samefagging.</br>  <br>What was your favorite episode?</br>  <br><br>Isn't there a scene in the second novel where Asuka basically screams at Nozomi to get out? That would seem out of character if Reina thought that Asuka was all cat smiles and magic tricks.<br><br>Although, even if Reina knew how special Asuka was and tried to approach her, I can't imagine that Asuka would do anything other than keep her at a cool distance. What would happen after that is anyone's guess.Would Reina resolve to work harder to expose Asuka's inner self or would she write off Asuka's previous behaviour and label her not special?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tough call. Probably episode 12. I'd say the festival episode (with Kumiko and Reina playing a song together on top of the hill) would trump it if it hadn't been for the tedious childhood love triangle nonsense.</br>  <br>Eh. Reina is already friends with Kumiko now. I think Reina is more than happy to have one close friend and doesn't feel the need to befriend a lot of people. Although she's not a complete loner and speaks to Mizore (and later on) Yuuko, if the novel spoilers are correct.<br><br>Maybe if Kumiko went to a different school, Reina might have forgotten all about her and become intrigued with Asuka instead. But then again, Asuka is two years older and doesn't seem to care about Reina (or other people in general) at all, so when would she get an opportunity to befriend her? She only befriended Kumiko "on accident" since Kumiko invited her to the festival. Reina would probably stare at Asuka a lot but never approach her until the year is over and Asuka graduates.</br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko:.....This is the sound of Minamichuu’s flute players <br> Minamichuu is famous for their flute players. Kumiko in particular has always loved the sound of their flutes and has listened to recordings of their flute players countless times. The person who is playing the flute perfectly right now is like listeneing to that recording once again. Kumiko knows for a fact that none of the third years can play this well which makes her look towards the direction from where the flute is coming from, curious as to who is playing. <br> Mizore: I’m going to throw up </br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi: ahh, well this is uhh that you know <br>We got another Kumiko lads.</br></br>  <br> Reina and Midori <br>is this even a fair match anon?</br></br>  <br> Asuka and Kaori then arrive together, in black and white bikinis respectively <br> Kumiko at first doesn’t recognize the dazzling goddess in the front of her because Asuka isn’t wearing her glasses <br> both of them are licking icecream cones <br> Midori comments that Asuka and Kaori look like models <br><br>Please Kyoani I need this in my life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can Kyoani make Kaori look attractive without completely redesigning her character? They wrote themselves into a corner here.</br>   think tall tuba and tubby tuba would make a cute pair <br> they're actually going out </br>  <br>What are you talking about, they kept her character design the same. Kaori is suppose to look like Taki sensei's wife.</br>  <br>Then it's bad writing, because she looks like a nerd, not like a supermodel.</br>  <br> Kumiko turns around, and sees the smuggest expression on Nozomi’s face. <br>I can't imagine her with a smugface.</br></br>  <br>Nozomi is a smug character when she's isn't in a bad mood. Natsuki and her are similar to each other.</br>  <br>I fucked up, I thought it was Mizore. <br><br>And holy shit, we will see Nozomi wearing a bikini. Can't wait for this.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for Yuuko scenes. Her character is hilarious and amusing.</br>  <br>She is in the pool too, right?</br>  <br>Yeah and we also get Reina making sarcastic remarks of Yuuko fainting if she see's Kaori in a bikini.</br>  <br> Just thinking about it now still pisses me off. <br> The bottle in Nozomi’s hands make a crushing sound <br>She's so based</br></br></br>  <br> The members who quit joined the K-ON (light music) club. <br>D-Did Nozomi play with the keions?</br></br>  <br> Everyone thinks Asuka senpai is special and to be honest, even the third years were scared of her <br>Best girl being a best.</br></br>  <br>wow, Nozomi is dumb and pathetic. Sorry season2fags</br>  Where do I go now that I've finished the anime?  <br>conclusion: Nozomi will end up losing 2 years of school club because she was mad, instead just waiting for the 3rd years assholes to graduate and enjoy It now</br>  <br>Watch other anime.</br>  <br>Wait for s2.</br>  <br>Learn moon and read the novels, or wait until the novels are translated and read them, whichever happens first.</br>  <br>post in every hibike thread because that will make a season 2 happen</br>  asuka pool preview  <br>I'm back and I figure I should start translating these Taki sensei scenes then. I found out I misread something that was actually a pretty big deal if they ever adapt this. These are a bit more translated, I wrote out the majority of the description lines I think.<br><br>Reina and Kumiko on the train ride to school together<br>Reina: Did you know? Today’s there’s supposed to be an outside teacher coming<br>Kumiko: Really, what kind of teacher?<br>Reina: Percussion. Apparently like he’s a friend of Taki sensei<br>Kumiko: Taki sensei has a lot of friends it seems <br>Reina: There also’s arrangements for a woodwind instructor for the Kansai Tournament<br>Kumiko: There isn’t going to be a brass instructor coming?<br> In response to that, Reina showed a sign that she was slightly offended <br>Reina: For a brass instructor, as long as Taki sensse is here, we’re fine. There’s no need to call for any other instructors<br>Kumiko: That’s right. Sorry sorry.<br> Kumiko hurriedly spoke the words needed to calm Reina down. Speaking of which, Reina loves Taki sensei. Of course, in a romantic sense. This beautiful, attractive, and genius girl came to Kitauji just so she could learn under Taki sensei. Even though she could’ve gotten into any prestiguous school with her grades. <br>Reina: Taki sensei played the trombone in music school. As long as it is related to brass instruments, Taki sensei is more than capable enough.<br> Reina announces, with a somewhat bragging tone. In relation to Taki, she is always this blindfully devoted, so Kumiko who has gotten used to this plays the usual yes man and replies okay okay. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part of Reina’s morning routine is to go to Taki sensei’s office to get the key to the music room. Mizore always comes first though but Reina still goes to Taki sensei’s office anyway.<br><br>Reina: Excuse me<br> Taki sensei approaches the door with a coffee mug in hand <br>Taki: Oh, you brought Oumae-san with you today<br> Taki sensei says with a smile on his face. Reina's cheeks rise slightly. She then swallows her spit and says in a more excited voice than usual <br>Reina: Um, is the key for the band room here?<br>Taki: If it's the key you need, Mizore-san already came for it. I believe the room should be open right now<br>Reina: Is that so? Thank you<br> Reina quickly bows her head. Speechless, Kumiko sees that Reina is blushing so hard that even her ears are red <br>Taki: That being said, I truly appreciate how you're always here so early in the morning practicing<br>Reina: I do it because I like it<br>Taki: Is that so? Well keep up that attitude then<br>Reina: I will!<br> Reina's response is so loud that Kumiko plugs her ears with her fingers out of reflex. Then Kumiko wonders if Reina is being way too obvious about her feelings. Reina takes a deep breath and leaves the room, Kumiko follows behind her <br>Kumiko: Don't tell me that the reason why you always come so early is just to see Taki sensei?<br>Reina: It's not like that's the only reason I come early<br>Kumiko: Hmm<br> Kumiko starts poking Reina's back. She can't see Reina's face right now but Reina is probably blushing <br>Kumiko: This side of you is pretty cute you know<br>Reina: Idiot, it's not like that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hashimoto’s introduction to the club<br><br>Hashimoto: My name is Hashimoto Masahiro, nice to meet you all. Feel free to call me Hashimo-chan. It might not look like it, but me and Taki here are the same age. But I look much younger don't I? Nevertheless, you girls must be giggling with excitement to have such a hottie as your teacher<br> the class suddenly turns very quiet. The third year clarinet answers with a red face <br>Clarinet: Taki sensei is really popular with girls outside of the club<br>Hashimoto: Oh? So you're saying he's not popular with you girls?<br>Clarinet: ah, I didn't mean that but, it’s just, during out first concert, Taki sensei’s impact was too much<br> In response to her honest response, the band members around her starts laughing. Hashimoto sensei starts cackling with a pleasant smile on his face while repeatedly slapping Taki sensei’s back <br>Hashimoto: Man, it seems nothing has changed with that then. Sorry, but when Taki sensei was young, he was always very rude.<br>Taki sensei: I wasn’t like that. Please stop saying weird things in front of the club members.<br> Looking at Taki sensei with a smile, Hashimoto suddenly screams out “owow”. If you looked carefully at their feet, Taki sensei’s shoe was trampling on Hashimoto’s sneaker. This is the first time Taki sensei has been seen in such high spirits. He must be Taki sensei’s buddy thought Kumiko, as she looks again at Hashimoto. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>you are so based, thank you</br></br></br>  <br>Are you the one that says Nozomi is pathetic?</br>  <br>You got it wrong I like her but the decision of leaving the club was pathetic for her, she was a hothead and should have waited, please you should work on your reading comprehension.</br>  <br> Kumiko: That’s right. Sorry sorry. <br> Kumiko hurriedly spoke the words needed to calm Reina down. <br>  In relation to Taki, she is always this blindfully devoted, so Kumiko who has gotten used to this plays the usual yes man and replies okay okay. <br>Poor Kumiko. Having to deal with friends when they're in love with someone is insufferable.<br><br>Does Kumiko ever tease Reina about Taki?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the post in sequence, anon</br>  So are Kumiko and Reina gay for each other or are they just weirdos about their friendship because they don't have other close friends?  <br><br><br>I love you so much</br></br></br>  <br>have you never tried to discover new things with your friends anon-kun</br>  <br>It was pathetic but honestly, if you were in a situation and was treated like shit, and you had an passion as great as her, would you stay? It can honestly get aggravating. I'm in the performing arts so I should know. <br><br>But you are right, she should of waited, its her won fault and it seems she knows that.</br></br></br>  <br>The later  if you don't have a yuri goggle. </br>  <br>She gets used to it, but it can still come off as tiring to endure all the time. Which seems to be happening.</br>  Novelanon. What about the scenes with Kumiko and Asuka. You said throughout the second novel their whole dynamic changes completely. Are you gonna share more of their transition?  <br>Reina is sixteen years old and Kumiko is her very first friend.<br>Kumiko is a spineless loser that easily gets caught in the trends and does whatever people around her do.<br><br>Fortunately, the both of them seem to grow out of it. Kumiko starts standing up for herself and realizing she has interests of her own, and Reina slowly starts to become friendly with other people as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and was treated like shit <br>That's how life goes, sadly. It's the most normal thing in the world, but in her case it would only last 1 year but she decided to quit anyway and now she is running begging for Asuka everytime even though Nozomi was so sure herself she wasn't going to come back and that's what I would call pathetic. <br> <br>Again, I like her .She seems to be just like Kumiko, but she shouldn't have done that, this is the only bad thing I could say about her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the cafeteria during lunch time, some clarinet girls are heard nervously gossiping<br><br>Clarinet: I h-heard that someone who looks like Taki sensei’s girlfriend just arrived<br> Crash. Kumiko immediately turns to the sound of the shocking noise. Standing there was Reina whose cup had fell out of her hand with a look of shock on her face. <br><br>During ensemble practice<br><br>Taki: For today and tomorrow, Niiyama Satomi sensei will be in charge of directing the woodwind section. She will also help direct the woodwind section after the training camp.<br> Taki sensei began the afternoon practice with announcement. The young woman standing next to Taki sensei nods lightly and says “Nice to meet you all”. A very cute girl with a gentle impression. Is this person Taki sensei’s girlfriend? thought Kumiko with a slant of her heard. Reina having heard the gossip of the seniors was fidgeting nervously. Somebody should just confirm if it’s true. Kumiko thought, but gossiping during practice was forbidden so everyone was quiet. <br>Taki: Tomorrow, Hashimoto sensei will also come to direct the percussion section.<br> Cheers are heard from the percussion section. He must be very popular with them, thought Kumiko as a bysander. <br>Taki: The woodwind section will practice in the second hall, percussion and brass will be practicing here. Niiyama sensei might young but she is is extremely talented. Make sure to follow her orders.<br>Niiyama smiled shyly in response to what Taki sensei said<br>Niiyama: Extremely talented? You're not getting anything from flattering me you know<br>Taki: of course not, but I am only saying what is true<br>Niiyama: oh my, well I'm happy to hear that then Taki sensei<br> the club members watched with a cool gaze as the gorgeous couple in front of them scattered an air of freshness. <br> Curious as to what Reina was thinking, Kumiko turned her head to the trumpet section. Reina was watching the couple with eyes that greatly resembled a dead fish. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will second this. Can you please do the same about vol 3? Of course, take you time, please don't rush yourself.</br>  <br>R-REINAAA<br>you're doing god's job novelanon. I love you and I can't believe you're giving us all the Reina-Taki scenes. <br>You're so based.</br></br></br>  <br> Clarinet: I h-heard that someone who looks like Taki sensei’s girlfriend just arrived <br> Crash. Kumiko immediately turns to the sound of the shocking noise. Standing there was Reina whose cup had fell out of her hand with a look of shock on her face. <br><br><br>Is this a healthy person?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait how is she like Kumiko? Please explain?</br>  <br>She's just madly in love, anon.</br>  <br> clarinets this <br> clarinets that  <br>Fuck dammit those sluts</br></br></br>  <br>Dammit Taki sensei is the best.</br>  <br>Still not healthy.</br>  <br>Novel and Manga Taki are hotter.</br>  I will honestly marry this clarinet.    <br> Taki: I don’t have a wife or any kids after all. The only thing I have is this job. <br>Jesus. Fucking. Christ.</br></br>  <br> So this is the jump to band camp, it's quite a big event but you only get to see the stuff that happens with Mizore <br>Kyoani will change that, I'm sure. They will make a proper environment.</br></br>  <br>He really does need someone who can give him at least 10 kids ;-;</br>  <br>I think he'd be fine with 2 or 3. Kids are hard to handle and when they are babies their even worse.</br>  <br>Can you imagine him living happily with his new wife and family? <br>I need it. I must have this.</br></br>  <br>Fubuki?</br>  <br> Its never gonna happen. </br>  <br> reina turns out to be a great musician but often needs to take breaks from the band because she get's pregnant every year </br>  <br>Of that we'll never be sure because the author finished the story. <br>But an anon can always dream based on butext  and look at pretty fanart </br></br>  <br>I'm really hoping for this actually. <br>I like to think that Ayano after doing her college shit will finish Hibike for good with them doing good in the nationals with a proper band and then in a special volume just like volume 4 they would meet after 5~10 years since highschool ended and Taki is married with Reina.  ;_; </br></br>  <br>Hibike! Euphonium. (The title of the books) Is about Kumiko and unofficially Asuka. Asuka's father wrote Hibike! Euphonium, and she finally passed it down to Kumiko. The story was about them and their developing relationship.<br><br>I don't think Takeda will continue, she'll probably just write a new novel.</br></br></br>  <br>The way she ended the vol 3 was pretty sad for those who like Hibike and for the hibikes, I don't think she will leave it on that.</br>  <br>Never stop believing anon ;-;</br>  <br>Damn Asuka is amazing.</br>  <br>The novel is not that popular though. If it was a hit novel sure, but really its not.</br>  <br>y-yes  ;_; </br>  <br>They didn't win at the Nationals this year, but just getting to the Nationals was a huge thing. Next year they'll get a lot of promising new members from all over Kyoto as the news that they got to Nationals spread, and all the old members will get even better at playing, and Taki-Sensei will still be there to guide them.<br><br>By Kumiko's third year, they'll definitely win gold at the Nationals.</br></br></br>  <br>Ensemble practice, everyone is rehearsing their parts over and over and it’s honestly quite tedious but necessary. But Reina’s solo on the otherhand...<br><br>Taki sensei: Kousaka-san, what’s wrong? Your solo feels different than usual<br> Taki sensei says still looking at the music sheet. Lowering her trumpet horizontally, Reina shakes her expressionlessly. <br>Reina: I’m sorry, next time will be fine<br>Taki: That’s fine then but our time is limited so please make sure not relax too much during the individual practice.<br>Reina: I won’t<br> The color of her face as she answered was sullen. Next to her was Kaori, who asked how Reina was feeling with a worried face. <br> Taki sensei turns the music sheet, and then takes a breath <br>Taki: Then, let’s start once more from the trumpet solo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko's and Asuka's story ended nicely that's all that matters. Asuka passing down Hibike! Euphonium is a beautiful ending.</br>  <br>Everyone is returning to their rooms to sleep, it’s a futon arrangement. The lights go out and Kumiko tries to sleep but the futon in front of her is rustling<br><br>Reina: ....Kumiko, are you asleep?<br> Says Reina as her head peeks out from the futon’s crevice. With eyes that are used to the dark, Kumiko can clearly see Reina’s face <br>Kumiko: What’s wrong?<br> Kumiko whispers back, trying not to wake up the other members. Reina is painfully silent for a moment but then takes a deep breath. She crumples her bedsheets. <br>Reina: Taki sensei... is he really dating Niiyama sensei?<br>Kumiko: Shouldn’t you know this Reina? Aren’t your your dad and sensei friends?<br>Reina: I don’t know anything about Taki sensei’s personal life. He just comes over to my house every once in a while.<br> As she says that, she incessantly blinks her eyes that are about to spill out. Is that how it is replies Kumiko. Kumiko pulls her futon up to her shoulders, wondering if it’s because of the AC. There was a cold feeling in the air. <br>Reina: I guess a woman closer to his age is the better fit. I must look completely like a child compared to her.<br> Kumiko became worried listening to Reina being so down on herself. Just where has the confident Reina gone to? Kumiko extends her hand to Reina’s hand that is sticking out of her futon and lightly holds it. Reina’s hand is soft and kind of small. Kumiko heart beats at the hand of a perfect girl. Feeling the warmth of Kumiko’s hand, Reina cast her eyes down. <br>Kumiko: You’re not getting anywhere just thinking about this. Isn’t the only thing you can do is to ask him directly?<br>Reina: Well, yeah there’s that<br>Kumiko: It’ll be fine, it’ll definitely be okay<br> Repeating those uncertain words, Kumiko tightens her grip. Reina slowly blinks her eyes, and then her lips finally curve up. Inside a world painted black, by chance her long breath could be clearly heard. <br>Reina: Thanks, Kumiko</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I think as well. <br><br>Plus it is blatant how it's said in the novels how Taki sensei will attract good players for future years. <br><br><br><br>Now with this I can't argue. Kindly fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>N-nooo<br>Leina ;-;</br></br>  <br>Kumiko really becomes an incredible friend.</br>  <br> Next to her was Kaori, who asked how Reina was feeling with a worried face </br>  <br>Two girls at night, in a bed next to each other, touching hands during a very emotional scene?<br><br>I can only imagine how Kyoani will make this scene look like in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Reina: I guess a woman closer to his age is the better fit. I must look completely like a child compared to her. <br>So she's aware the age is a problem mhm.</br></br>  <br>They are gonna make it like the Tomoya and Nagisa one of course.</br>  I want to marry No velanon___   <br><br> it’ll definitely be okay </br></br>  <br>I honestly want the Asuka and Kumiko scenes from the second novel. I want to read how they change. I want to read Asuka grooming Kumiko to be her protege.</br>  <br>Pink spiders fighting to the death?</br>  <br> mhm </br>  <br>it makes me consider things mmmmhm</br>  <br>Everyone is shooting fireworks on the last day of band camp. Midori is swinging out sparklers like she’s a magical girl and Hazuki is trying to stop her. Reina and Kumiko are sitting on a bench, Reina is holding a sparkler. Reina is very cute in this scene because of how nervous she is.<br>Reina: It’s been a while since I did something like this<br> Reina by Kumiko’s side had an expression that resembled a smile. Her soft cheeks covered by the rising shadows. Even though it was dark outside, the lights from the fireworks lit up the area. While looking at the sparkler in Reina’s hand, Kumiko narrowed her eyes. It was driving away the darkness or something like that, thought Kumiko. <br>Reina: Ahh, it went out <br> Reina grumbles, looking at the burnt out tip. Reina slowly turns her gaze to the bucket. Over there is Taki, standing by himself as he watches over everyone. Even though Taki sensei usually wears the same outfits, only during this time was he wearing a black t-shirt and gave off a rough appearance. <br>Kumiko: Go and throw out that firework?<br> Reina started shaking in response to the line that has been said countless times already. Reina arches her back with a miserable “ooo” sound coming out from her <br>Reina: My heart isn’t ready yet.<br>Kumiko: But at this rate, the time for fireworks is going to end isn’t it? Hurry up and ask him already.<br>Reina: B-but, if he says “yes that’s right” or something, I won’t be able come back from that<br> Where is the usual composed Reina thought Kumiko. Reina starts slapping both of her own cheeks repeatedly, making an exaggerating sound. Kumiko sends a vague smile towards Reina and slaps her on the back. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kumiko: Reina you were the one who said it. That you would confirm with Taki sensei himself if he and Niiyama sensei were dating.<br>Reina: well, I did say that...<br>Kumiko: If you don’t ask now, you’re going to regret it<br>Reina: I get it<br> Reina says, as she buries her face into her lap. Kumiko doesn’t say anything as she looks at their surrounding. A white smoke coils up into the night sky. Kumiko tries to stop herself from yawning, and quietly asks the curled up girl next to her. <br>Kumiko: Niiyama sensei is talking with Michie sensei right now. It seems like they’re getting excied about something.<br>Reina: What are you trying to say by telling me that?<br>Kumiko: Isn’t the only time you have to ask now? If you wait any longer, Niiyama sensei is going to walk over to Taki sensei. Won’t that mean that you won’t be able to recover anymore?<br>Reina: ..........<br>Kumiko: Hey, go throw out your fireworks already<br> Whether or not those words gave Reina a push, Reina started to stand up. Reina stretched her legs out from her short pants. Reina gripped the burn out fireworks in her hand and turns to Kumiko <br>Reina:... I’ll be right back<br>Kumiko: Good luck<br> Kumiko waves to Reina. Watching as the figure of her friend disappears, Kumiko didn’t move from her seat. Kumiko can see Reina trying to ask Taki sensei something. She was depressed just now but it seems like she’s a little happier now. <br>Hashimoto: That girl, she’s in love with Taki sensei huh?<br>Kumiko: ahhhh!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Even I’m not that much of a monster. <br>Did she say it like that? Holy shit. <br><br> Asuka: Well isn’t it obvious that I would stop my beloved kouhai from trying to quit? <br> Kumiko: Can you stop with that? I know you’re not that kind of person  <br>w-wow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh my god Reina so cute  autistic .<br>I'm even more in love with her now.</br></br>  <br>Heh Kumiko is such naive a kid, my god.</br>  <br> Hashimoto: That girl, she’s in love with Taki sensei huh? <br>Oh shit</br></br>  <br> Kumiko: You really like Nozomi senpai don’t you? <br> Natsuki smiles without saying anything and they start walking again <br>She's so best.</br></br></br>  <br> I really caused a lot of trouble for Riko and Gotou. Goto in particular is still pissed off about how Riko got hurt <br>h-holy shit that's why Gotou despises Natsuki. Thanks novelanon</br></br>  How can one anon be so based?  <br>natsuki is so best it hurts</br>  <br>So Reina can act in a non autistic way in front of Taki and is also courageous enough to do it.<br>I like it.  no hope for /u/ now </br></br>  <br>She still acts autistic dude. Also she knows nothing about his personal life. For someone that knew him thats sad.</br>  <br> Hearing a voice suddenly coming from her back, Kumiko jumps. Turning around, she sees Hashimoto with his horrible sense of humor smiling jestfully. While still being bewildered, Kumiko respond with her own smile. Whether or not Hashimoto understood the situation or not, he took a seat next to Kumiko. <br>Hashimoto: Taki-kun, that bastard. He turned even a highschool girl into his lover.<br> Hashimoto says, as he happily laughs. Kumiko was a little flustered <br>Kumiko: H-how did you know that?<br>Hashimoto: hrm? How did I know what?<br>Kumiko: That Reina is in love with Taki sensei?<br> Hashimoto bursts into laughter in response to Kumiko’s question. Kumiko took offense to his cackling <br>Hashimoto: Well I’m an adult too, so I would know that much<br>Kumiko: Is that how it is?<br>Hashimoto: That’s right<br> Is that really how it is grumbles Kumiko in her head. Hashimoto takes the hem of his shirt and starts fanning himself. Just by looking at him Kumiko starts to get kind of hot. <br>Hashimoto: Just so you know, Niiyama-kun and Taki-kun aren’t dating. Niiyama-kun, she has a husband you know.<br>Kumiko: eee, Niiyama sensei is married?<br> Kumiko unconsciously starts staring at Hashimoto’s face. Hashimoto makes a strange smile and says that’s right, in a light tone. <br>Kumiko: T-then, what is everyone’s relationship? Hashimoto sensei and Taki sensei, you two look like you’ve always been close.<br>Hashimoto: Hrm? We were in the same year in the same college. Incidentally, Niiyama-kun is our kouhai. It was a music college we were in.<br>  Hashimoto closes his eyes, reminscing fondoly of the past. Hashimoto took a glance towards Taki sensei and then loudly exhaled. <br>Hashimoto: You know, since Taki-kun’s wife died, he was always depressed. Seeing him laugh like that makes me really relieved.<br>Kumiko: huh<br> Hold on a second. Did he just casually say something absolutely unthinkable? Kumiko looks at Hashimoto with wide frozen eyes and Hashimoto replies “ah..” in voice showing his stupidity </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko: ahhhh! </br>  <br>holy fucking shit hashimoto</br>  <br>Hashimoto is sex on a stick, KyoAni make him unbelievably hot.</br>  <br>He just is, anon. He just is.</br>  <br>It's not austistic, an austistic person wouldn't gather the courage to ask the difficult things.<br>And she might know little about him, yet the loves she feels for him is a serious one, pure on its own. So cute.</br></br>  <br>She still couldn't ask him if they were dating, Kumiko learns and tells her later.</br>  <br>That the woman is married.</br>  <br>Was there ever a full webm made of Kumiko's noises throughout the whole series? I have one composed from like the first 8 episodes or so.</br>  <br>If she wasn't pushed by Kumiko she would of never gotten the courage.</br>  <br>you are doing gods work anon I love you <br><br><br>No anon, Reina IS autistic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>T-that's...way too fucking cute. All I can think is Reina going to Taki then casually turning around as if nothing happened.</br>  <br> No anon, Reina IS autistic. <br>She's not. She's an adorable girl with a big heart for the man she loves.</br></br>    <br>Have you ever loved someone anon?</br>  <br> This denial. </br>  Kumiko is such a down to earth character.  <br>o-of course, my waifu!</br>  <br> Such a naive child. </br>  <br>would you ever confess to your waifu? how would you feel if she tells you she's already dating other MC?</br>  <br><br>At least learn how to greentext first before posting, tumblr.</br></br>  <br> confess <br>Heh.<br>Have you ever confessed to anyone? Really?</br></br></br>  <br> I don't know what love feels like <br>I'm sorry for you.</br></br>  <br>c-come on what happens next I'm getting anxious and my autism is attacking</br>  <br>Hashimoto: Crap. I said something I shouldn’t have.<br>Kumiko: Taki sensei had a wife?<br> Kumiko recalls the words Taki sensei said to her. I have neither wife nor or any kids after all. The only thing I have is this job. Taki sensei definitely said that. In response to Kumiko’s question, Hashimoto slightly straightens his neck. Without thinking, Kumiko turns her head towards where Reina is. What is she talking about? She’s still happily talking to Taki sensei. Hashimoto’s tongue makes a self depreciating shape. His eyes, were filled with sadness. <br>Hashimoto: That wife<br>Hashimoto: Died five years ago<br> The sound of everyone’s joyful and innocent laughter could be heard in the distance. Kumiko gulps and looks at Hashimoto. Taki-kun was extremely sad. Hashimoto’s soft voice disappeared somewhere into the lukewarm night sky. Silence surrounded the two, enveloping them in a thin membrane from the world. An invisible wall cut them off from everday life around them. Kumiko squeezed the hem of her shirt. Hashimoto looked downtrodden. <br>Hashimoto: You know, before coming here, Taki-kun never had any experience as an adviser but he helped other people in many ways such as an assistant adviser. But, when his wife died, it seems like he tore himself away from everything since then. He distanced himself from music. I worried if he was okay or not. Niiyama and I we, just couldn’t fill the void that his wife left. All we could do was watch from a distance. That’s why when I heard Taki-kun was going to become the adviser for Kitauji asking being asked whatever I don’t know, I was extremely relieved. When he was asked to help conduct the band, I honestly was about to cry.<br> Not knowing what to say, Kumiko kept her mouth shout. Perhaps Hashimoto wasn’t wanting her answer to show that she was listening. He’s an adult afterall.  <br>Kumiko:... I<br>Hashimoto: hrm?<br>Kumiko: I’m, happy that Taki sensei is our adviser<br>Hashimoto: Me too<br>＞The words he said were without a doubt true to his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You kinda have to do that in order to pursuit a relationship, unless your'e drunk and are feeling courageous enough to go for it right off the bat.<br> Drunk Reina humping Taki doujin when? </br></br>  <br>I do know what it is and its not how japan portrays it which is autistic and the reason why they have such a low birthrate.</br>  <br>WAIFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</br>  What's happening here? Someone is completing the missing parts from where OP left?  <br>Kumiko x Hashimoto Yes? She's even hot for him.</br>  <br>Jesus</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> when I heard Taki-kun was going to become the adviser for Kitauji I was extremely relieved. When he was asked to help conduct the band, I honestly was about to cry. <br>He is such a bro.</br></br>  <br> Hashimoto: Taki-kun, that bastard. He turned even a highschool girl into his lover. </br>   Kumiko: I’m, happy that Taki sensei is our adviser <br> Hashimoto: Me too <br>＞The words he said were without a doubt true to his heart.<br><br>I can't help but think that Ayano is a prodigy and will write a fucking masterpiece.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujoshi's are gonna go crazy with this paring.</br>  <br> Nozomi: MIZORE! <br>Shit.<br><br> Asuka: You’re the worst <br> Yuuko: Hold it! What the hell are you doing? <br>Fucking shit. <br><br> Yuuko is gripping Nozomi by her collar with both arms. Nozomi is shocked at what’s going on because she has no clue <br> Yuuko: Why are you going this far to hurt Mizore? <br>Holy fucking shit. <br><br> Natsuki tears off Yuuko’s arms from Nozomi’s collar. Without calming down, Yuuko lashes out and shoves both of them.  <br> Natsuki and Nozomi both fall to the ground. <br><br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When people are saying that Asuka handed down Hibike Euphonium to Kumiko, is that her silver instrument?  <br>nope, Hibike Eupho is a book written by Asuka's father</br>  <br> That night, Kumiko had trouble sleeping. Asuka’s story, Hashimoto’s story. Lots of information was swirling around in Kumiko’s head. <br>Reina: Taki sensei and Niiyama sensei aren’t dating. He said he doesn’t have a girlfriend.<br> Kumiko thinks back to how happily Reina was smiling after she said that. Reina’s dad and Taki’s dad seemed to be very close. That being said, I wonder if Reina already knows about Taki’s dead wife. But, Kumiko says as she curls up in her futon. When Reina said she was in love with Taki sensei, she was too innocent. She probably doesn’t know. Thinking about it, Kumiko’s heart suddenly grows tight for some reason, and she shuts her eyes. Mizore’s situation is like that too. Asuka said that Nozomi is a source of trauma to Mizore. But Nozomi doesn’t know that.  <br><br>So that wraps up things with Taki sensei and Reina for volume 2. Thing I miswrote earlier was that Kumiko tells Reina that Taki sensei isn’t dating Niiyama, but it’s actually Reina who finds out herself. In the novel, we only see things from Kumiko’s point of view, so if they adapt this, we’ll probably see Reina and Taki sensei’s conversation during the firework scene. This is a pretty big deal for Reina’s love since she took that step herself instead of hiding behind Kumiko. Too bad when she finds out about Taki sensei’s wife, things get kind of ugly. And then things get kind of great afterwards. So I hope you people have a better understanding of Reina’s love now.<br><br>Now I either need to write or Taki sensei stuff or write Asuka stuff to balance things out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Too bad when she finds out about Taki sensei’s wife, things get kind of ugly. And then things get kind of great afterwards. So I hope you people have a better understanding of Reina’s love now. <br>Y-you can't leave us hanging!</br></br>  <br>Ahh so she isn't autistic.</br>  <br>Asuka and Kumiko stuff please!</br>  <br>Good choice of images, anon. Thank you so much. <br><br>Well, I'm really interested in Asuka more than any other thing. <br><br>  Too bad when she finds out about Taki sensei’s wife, things get kind of ugly <br>Wh-What do you mean?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know I never expected Natsuki to be such a great person. I thought she was just a drama queen slacker at first.  I wanna hagu Asuka and tell her everything will be daijobu.  ;_;  And have rough sex after she cries   thank you for this Novelanon<br>it was an interesting read</br>  Bless novelanon.  <br><br>How does Shuichi encourage Kumiko in 2nd vol before the performance does he whisper lewd things into her ear again?</br></br>  <br>OTP<br>T<br>P</br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/hLRbBCp5 put the Reina stuff messily into a pastebin if you ever want to use it.<br><br>Thinking about how massive all the Asuka stuff is though is kind of mindboggingly though. It's easy to type out the Reina scenes because they're really self contained but the third volume is literally all Asuka and there's so much stuff that happens in volume 2 that connects to volume 3. I need to find a good place to start it all.<br><br><br>Natsuki is a Bestsuki<br><br><br><br>I'll need to write out the last Taki sensei scene then</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'll need to write out the last Taki sensei scene then <br>How can I pay you? I honestly don't care I want your privates in my mouth right fucking now</br></br>  <br> Hashimoto takes the hem of his shirt and starts fanning himself. Just by looking at him Kumiko starts to get kind of hot. <br><br>Slluuuutttt.</br></br></br>  <br>I ship them together.</br>  <br>When does Asuka and Kumiko's relationship start to shift to becoming more equal?</br>  <br>Doing gods work. <br><br>You are not bad translator at all means, anon. Love ya.</br></br></br>  <br>Time for some Shuuichi then <br><br>At night, Kitauji’s river is kind of eerie. The surface of the water becomes dark and you can’t see the bottom. Holding onto the wooden handrail, Kumiko sighs deeply<br>Shuuichi: Good job on today’s practice<br> A sudden voice from behind, Kumiko turns around. She sees a smiling Shuuichi still in his uniform coming her way. Speaking of which, it feels like it’s been a while since I’ve talked to him. Looking up at Shuuichi who was standing above her, Kumiko lets out a smile <br>Kumiko: You too. On your way home?<br>Shuuichi: Yeah I guess<br> While answering, Shuuichi takes out his ear buds. The sound of the music slightly leaks out. It’s one of the sections of our pieces. Whether or not he took notice to what Kumiko was looking at, he embarassingly scratches his head. <br>Shuuichi: Hey look, the competition is closing by<br>Kumiko: It’s really soon<br> Shuuichi leans on the handrail to be next to Kumiko. Looking at his big hands, Kumiko thinks that Shuuichi really is a man or something. <br>Shuuichi: Meikou, Osaka’s Toushou, Shudai’s Buzoku (these are three schools, I have no idea how to read them).... yep, no matter which of them you look at there’s only veteran schools<br>Kumiko: The order in which we play, if we’re after any of them it’ll be the worse<br>Shuuichi: Well, there’s plenty of chances that’ll happen. Ahh, I hope the new adviser at Meikou makes them worse.<br> He says with a tone that gives off a joking impression as Shuuichi makes a bring motion his arms and then brings them together. Kumiko glances Shuuichi’s way and then mutters <br>Kumiko: If we lose here, the competition is going to be all over<br> Shuuichi glimpses Kumiko. Looking at Shuuichi’s eyes which are fumbling for the right words to say, Kumiko gulps. Looking down at her feet, Kumiko looks at her black high socks. Sewn on there is a white logo. From there peeks out out a thin line impression on her kneecaps. <br>Shuuichi: You anxious?<br> Shuuichi asks. Kumiko nods </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko: I’m anxious, scared. What will I do if I mess up during the concert?<br>Shuuichi: I said it’ll be fine. We’ve practiced so hard for this.<br>Kumiko: But, even so. I just have this horrible premonition. I can’t explain it but I just feel like something is going to happen.<br> Kumiko can’t arrange the words properly. These scatted fragments of thoughts are falling all over here and there in her mind. Kumiko keeps stretching out her arms trying to gather her thoughts but whenever she gets a grip on them, they silently slip away. <br> Shuuichi slaps Kumiko on the back. His large palms sent a shock across Kumiko’s body through her clothes <br>Shuuichi: Isn’t it better just to not think about it too much then? Generally speaking, our school was originally a weak school. If everything goes well, we’ll probably just think we got lucky anyway.<br> Kumiko timidly raises her face towards the sound of Shuuichi’s voice, full of brightness. Shuuichi is trying to cheer me up. His gentle gaze looking down at Kumiko made the inside of her heart feel restless. Her back feeling itchy, her heart beating just a little bit faster. Feeling her face grow warmer, Kumiko turns away her face. For some reason, she felt a little embarassed. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If in the end of this someone put all parts together in order I'm seriously think about translating to my own language. <br>Ganbare!</br></br>  <br> Looking at his big hands, Kumiko thinks that Shuuichi really is a man or something <br>kek lost it</br></br>  Help, my nose is bleeding.  <br> Kumiko: I’m anxious, scared. What will I do if I mess up during the concert? <br> Kumiko: But, even so. I just have this horrible premonition. I can’t explain it but I just feel like something is going to happen. <br>Kumiko is a pessimist just like me, great.</br></br></br>  <br>Yurifags BTFO beyond belief.</br>  <br>No one cares about Yuribait, People moved on to Yuuko/Natsuki and Mizore/Nozomi. They have the gay as fuck scenes.</br>  <br>Taki must be 100% aware of Reina's love for him. <br>Why won't he give himself to her? he needs it, she needs it, WE NEED IT.</br></br>  <br>fucking this.</br>  You guys just have to live with an open ending. Write fanfics if you want a conclusion.  <br>Third novel is when shit goes down. Kumiko even goes as far as to call Asuka  a normal highschool girl . And by the very end Kumiko receives Asuka's notebook of songs.</br>    <br>because Taki sensei is a man of morals and Reina is still his student. Maybe when she graduates.</br>  <br>What about in the second novel? You say there is a lot of connected scenes between them.</br>  <br>Of course he'll wait until she's of legal age. <br>Just two years, two fucking years.<br> How can he survive as her music advisor when he's aware she's in love with him? How can he overlook the staring? the mumbling? the blushing? how can he ignore his boner? </br></br></br>  <br>He never got a boner in general. Plus she leaves when she becomes 18 overseas.</br>  <br>well the scenes were the ones posted earlier in the Nozomi sections since Kumiko isn't afraid to call out Asuka on her shit anymore. But there is one realllly important scene in the second novel during band camp. Watching  EVO   though so I don't have time to translate it. But Kumiko finds Asuka playing a song on her euphonium very early in the morning. It's a beautiful song but she never heard it before. Asuka doesn't tell her what the name is but she plays it again when Kumiko asks. <br><br>This song is something Asuka plays repeatedly throughout the rest of the novels. Asuka plays it when she feels sad and whenever Kumiko is feeling sad Asuka plays it for her. You can read the Asuka spoilers to find out the importance of this song. But at the very end of the novel, Asuka gives Kumiko the music sheet for it and tells her to play it for her underclassmen the same way Asuka played it for her. The very last line of the novel, Kumiko finally finds out the name of the song. It's titled  Hibike Euphonium </br></br></br>  <br> Plus she leaves when she becomes 18 overseas. <br>And she'll come back to him as a young woman. Oh yes, it'll be glorious.</br></br>  <br>He's gonna have plenty of girls in love with him during the next years. I think he's just gonna group all of them together. Also he knew that the girls of this year finds him attractive, doesn't mean he's interested.</br>  <br>What if he's not in Kitauji anymore? Taki's not gonna stay in the same place, not after he wins gold.</br>  Season 2 OP to have Niiyama and Hashinoto directing the band with Sensei. Band camp and NozomoxMizore<br><br>Will they top Dream Solister?</br></br>  <br>There's a difference between being attractive and being someone's love, anon. Besides Reina is not like any other girl, and he's a family friend. Their connection goes beyond that of a teacher and student.<br><br> Implying Taki needs to be in Kitauji for Reina to contact him.  <br>He can show up at her house like he's done before, anon. <br>There's no stoping this ride.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By something everyone already knew for months?</br>  <br>And a more screen time of Natsuki and Yuuko.</br>  <br><br><br>You just know that Kyoani is gonna downgrade this scene to hell.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, so she actually plays it when she is sad and for kumiko too<br><br>Dammit novelanon, than you.</br></br></br>  <br>What ride? Taki doesn't want anyone but his wife. If he had a chance in resurrecting her he would.</br>  <br>They were trying to convince themselves Reina is painfully awkward around Taki, so they could argue it wouldn't work. <br>But it was confirmed they actually talked and Reina got the information she needed.</br></br>  <br><br> Shuuichi slaps Kumiko on the back. His large palms sent a shock across Kumiko’s body through her clothes <br><br>This would be 2nd time in the novels. In the anime though he dindu nuffin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They have the strongest connection in the novels anon. It may even be stronger than the Reina one.</br>  In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet <br>Counting seconds through the night and got carried away <br>So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars,<br><br>"Hey, I wanna get better!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is both painfully awkward, and able to talk to him. She still doesn't know shit about his personal life.</br>  <br>Have you read the spoilers? Taki is recovering from it and will eventually move on. By that time Reina will be a delicious +20 years old girl looking for him.</br>  <br> Taki doesn't want anyone but his wife.  <br>I can tell Taki would like to have a family. He loved his wife, sure. He'll never forget her, sure.<br>But he's getting better. He just needs healing and another chance will rise, and Reina's been waiting for that all her life.<br>It's like pottery</br></br></br></br>  Hibike threads have been pretty comfy since the show ended  <br> 1200x675 </br>  <br> She still doesn't know shit about his personal life. <br>He already opened up to her. If they sit down and have a conversation about it all problems will be solved.</br></br>  <br> 23:23:23 </br>  You guys only care about Reina's feelings. Tell me where Taki thought of her differently? Do we ever get his thoughts on this matter in canon, or will it always be about Reina's feelings? I would be for this couple if Taki actually likes her like that. But honestly I see them going out for 2 years and then he'll end it cause he wants her to have a future.  <br>You guys honestly don't know anything about having a real relationship with anyone, let alone someone twice your age.</br>  <br>This absolutely makes no sense, what a whole stupid rubbish.</br>  <br>Please take this bullshit argument to tumblr. <br>Age doesn't matter when the people involved love each other and their compromise is perfectly legal, anon.</br></br>  <br>Well what are his feelings for her? This shit works both ways, at least Kumiko and Shuuichi has that. I'm a Takifag and I want him to be happy, but not with someone who he doesn't have feelings for. There is a thing called one sided love. Its common in most Japanese fiction. Hell he's better off with Hashimoto. Those two are real close.</br>  <br>He was distraught for five years anon, closed up in his own little depressive world. <br>Now he's getting better. <br>Look at Reina. She's gorgeous, talented, and madly in love with him for the right reasons. You seriously t think she's doesn't have what a man like Taki needs?</br></br></br>  <br>You seriously think you know what Taki needs. Jesus you're just self inserting with him. Why would I take you seriously?</br>  <br>What does a man like Taki needs? Someone with the same characteristics as his wife in order to replace her? or someone who'd be nothing but selfless and loving towards him? which one fills the void, anon? you tell me</br>  <br>Neither. He needs his friends, and his fucking father who should act like a real dad.</br>  <br>So cute ;_;<br><br>They are lovely, my god</br></br></br>  the thing is that the novel is always from Kumiko's point of view so we really can't know what Taki sensei is thinking. Reina makes it pretty fucking obvious though. Going to have to wait for them to animate new Taki scenes.  <br>Those weren't capable of doing shit for him during the time he was depressed as fuck, anon. Only the possibility of fullfilling his wife's dream motivated him enough to be productive again.<br>What he needs is someone to give him that inspiration again, I don't see why Reina couldn't.</br></br>  <br>What's making Taki happy and more focused is his students and how hard they are working, its not only Reina, its everyone in the fucking band. He cares about all of his students, and seeing them happy makes him happy. That's whats helping him further recover, the Kitauji wind ensemble.</br>  <br>band orgy when.

That may of been the first intention but it did change him.</br>  <br>Wow just finished reading It. What a ride. <br><br>What a ride. <br><br>Is this really Ayano's first work? It can't possibly be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not completely.<br> Taki: I don’t have a wife or any kids after all. The only thing I have is this job. <br>Anyways, Reina made him laugh.

I can think of whatever ending for either of them. Kumiko/Shuuichi is the only confirmed couple.</br>  <br>Not Taki. I think he finds the whole Reina love for him cute.<br>And yeah, she was mistaken as his daughter when he was buying flowers, but then again, Kumiko is quite childish looking.

OK.</br>  <br>OF THE SEASON</br>  <br>Not Midori level, but yeah, pretty childish looking.</br>  <br>To me she looks more grown up, especially for her height. but too each their own.</br>  <br>Her hair is fluffy and her chest is flat.</br>  <br>Too each their own dude. Also is by far the most mature looking female in the cast.</br>  <br>is Asuka.</br>  <br>wow I have to reply to this <br><br>Yeah they are really alike, since Sakamichi took part in the 60's she would probably be her grand grandmother.

Plus she told them about Megunee.</br>  <br>Who are you, some kind of tsundere? I love you too, just like all tsunderes. You aren't special at all :D</br>  <br>Nah she didn't try to bite them, she wasn't a zombie at all just a worst girl.</br>  So is the OP going to get more grim after every episode?  <br>What did the girls know about Megu-nee, anyway? Did they see her getting bitten? Did they know she went away by her own will?<br><br>I've always wondered how they reacted to Megu-nee just disappearing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope<br> I'm expecting to see Megu-nee and dog like a zombie at some point </br></br></br>  <br>They know everything. Read the manga.

It is the most cancerous general in /a/ after TG.</br>    <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>Which Gurashi is most likely to do anal? Rii?</br>  <br>NOW WE'RE TALKING</br>  <br>any of them if i force them</br>    What I didn't like about the helicopter pilot incident was the glaring lack of oversight over a precious resource like a helicopter being allowed to take off from a military base without a backup pilot in attendance.<br><br>These military guys are one of the few survivors from this zombie apocalyse yet they let some faggot essentially hijack what is likely their only helicopter without anyone suddenly cussing the pilot out on radio and asking what the fuck was he doing and where the fuck is he going with their only helicopter even if the pilot had successfully gone up in the air, preventing anyone from pointing a gun at him and demanding he to come back to base.<br><br>Because prior to this, we saw the military all traveling together and wearing haz mat suits and coordinating together yet somehow this helicopter pilot managed to sneak away.<br><br>Don't military helicopters have black boxes as well?<br><br>You think they would have been alerted that a helicopter went down and then tried to do a search and rescue asap but days passed by and no sign of the JSDF going ballistic that they lost a helicopter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Miki the only person wearing garter?  <br>If the incident is contained to Japan (which it most likely is) you would also question why no other country has checked it out on satellites or whatnot, since people would ask questions if a major country went dark for months.</br>  <br>He was probably their last helicopter pilot in their last helicopter.</br>  <br>Why do you think he wasn't given permission or orders to do that? He looked calm when he first got in it. If he was doing it without permission he would have looked a lot more hurried and nervous.<br><br>Agree with all the other points, though. I really wonder what the hell he was trying to do alone, with a copilot or crewmen.</br></br></br>  <br>without a copilot or crewmen, I mean/</br>  <br>They have been stuck in school for months with no help or any military presence.<br>Radio is dead.<br>Internet is dead.<br>Telecommunication is dead.<br><br>It is either we are looking at an isolated experimental island where no one in the outside world know or the whole world is gone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The helicopter pilot should have already told the captain or any doctor on base that he had been bitten before and had taken those vaccines and such a person would never been allowed to travel alone in case he suddenly loses control of his body when the infection can't be prevented anymore from corrupting his body.<br><br>It just felt too surreal seeing him casually fly away with a helicopter and the base being so unaware about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Radio isn't dead.<br><br>Anybody with a car in the area would have been able to listen to the radio since the radio chick and her office radio building still successfully broadcasted music.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, that is what I am talking about. It was a private radio broadcast and not emergency government released broadcast telling people to evacuate to safe area, news update &amp; etc.</br>  Your face when zombies keep their old habits and go walk around to their favorite places.<br><br>In Japan, the countryside is losing a lot of young folk.<br><br>Your face when the countryside like Hokkaido would be the safest areas in Japan right now because not too many zombies will be having the habit of walking to the country..</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's not only retarded but literally insane?</br>  <br>Electricity still works though.<br><br>The girls managed to fill up their car with gas from the local gas station if I recall.<br><br>Someone is still working at the power stations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that faucet dick </br>  <br>This one has writing on the top panel as well.</br>  <br>Too bad about that middle child, though.</br>  <br>Why do helicopter pilots have to wear gas masks again?<br><br>Doesn't that make it a pain in the ass to respond to radio?</br></br></br>  Just watched the first ep, I knew something was off when i saw pic related, but then the rooftop scene happened and i realized something very bad was happening in this show, i was actually expecting something more like Higurashi, this was really good anyway.<br><br>/animeblog.</br></br>  <br>They might catch an airborne zombie shit and start nuking friendlies with missiles. Either that or it's supposed to be an oxygen mask though this one isn't connected to anything.<br><br>(idk)</br></br></br>  <br> like Higurashi <br>Meaning what?</br></br>  So if a zombie invasion happens to you, where would you prefer to go?<br><br>Costco or Walmart, if those are the only two choices for you.</br></br>  <br>Costco probably, build a shelter on those huge shelves they got there.</br>  <br>Out into the badlands. Everyone else will be rushing to Costco, and it will only take one infected getting in to affect everyone else.<br>After a good while, I'll go looting.</br></br>    <br>Target.</br>  <br>No guns, though.</br>  <br>Why either of those? If you have a choice at all goto lowes/homedepot. The possibility of survival and weapon making are endless.</br>  <br> wanting guns </br>  <br>Only answer is Lowe's</br>  <br>My parents have a cabin about 2 hours away from the nearest town stocked with guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Only enough food to last maybe a month, though. But there's huge blueberry fields nearby, a vegetable garden, and large wild game that just walk right up to the front door every other day that we can shoot.</br>  <br>Home improvement goods don't really translate to good weapon making.<br><br>A sports equipment store would have better weapon making potential than Home Depot.</br></br></br>  <br> Lowes <br> not Home Depot </br></br>  <br> Home Depot <br> not Menards <br>do you even save big money?</br></br></br>  <br> Only enough food to last maybe a month, though. <br><br>Doesn't Costco Online have this option of buying one year of canned goods for one person?<br><br>Like you could buy an entire year's supply of canned goods even though I'm not too sure of the taste or quality myself.</br></br></br></br></br>  Should I watch this show  <br>I hope you enjoy zombie deer crashing through your windows.</br>  <br>Buc-ee's.</br>  <br>Are you shitting me? Look at <br>thats just two bays of one isle. There is enough raw material, wood metal ect, in even a SMALL homedepot to arm a whole platoon and build them a comfy mansion base attached to the store to live in.</br></br>  <br>Is that another one of those flyover state things?</br>  <br> Home Depot over Lowes <br> Ever <br>I needed to make spare keys, so I went to HD.<br>2 trips back.4 keys, and a refund later and they still can't fucking up.<br>Went to Lowes and got it done in a minute.<br>Never again</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and large wild game that just walk right up to the front door every other day that we can shoot <br><br>But don't bears love breaking into cabins and killing your pet dog?</br></br></br>  <br> deer <br><br>If only.<br><br>Think wolves, moose, caribou, and brown bears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menar<wbr>ds<br>also known as the best home improvement store</br></wbr></br>  <br>Yeah you're fucked.</br>  <br>The hell is a Cotstco?<br>Why are you assuming I have a Walmart in my country?</br></br>  <br>You just haven't been freed yet. Pray that Obama brings your little democracy a good dose of corporate freedom. <br>You do have oil, right?</br></br>  <br>Costco, it's a warehouse wholesale store that isn't run by greedy Jews.</br>  <br>Home Depot.<br><br>If watching Home Alone taught me anything, it's that simple hardware and accessories are more than enough to hold off a pair of bumbling idiots. I'd hate to think of the cleanup I'd need to do for a horde of zombies.</br></br></br>  put that shit in a museum  <br> Canadians will literally cross the border to get better Costco deals </br>  <br>There's also more creative ways to handle zombies as well</br>  <br>Indiana Jones pls.</br>  Was that reference to the Stand even foreshadowing? Try as I might, I can't even think of any similarities between any characters and not even the setting is similar except for it being some kind of apocalypsemaybe.  <br> The Stand <br> Randall Flag <br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> Randall Corporation </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah. That.</br>  You know I find it odd that Kurumi is the only one armed in a way. Remember when they wanted to check out the helicopter and Yuki isn't even holding anything?  <br>Miki, you mean?<br><br>What weapon would you like Miki to have? A baseball bat? A metal pole? A piece of wood with a large nail through it?</br></br></br>  <br>A paddlesaw.</br>  <br>Dildo.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, Higurashi starts like  a normal Slice of Life on a rural town, with every episode really wird and supicious thing happen in the first 2 episodes then at the end of ep 3 one of the MCs gets killed by one of his school mates. <br><br>So i was expecting somethin like that, slowly building the tension and eventually reveal the real plot, but instead this show did it in the very first episode.<br><br>its not a complain, i still like this show.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the most athletically skilled of them, and thus the most likely to win in a fight.

The bear isn't. Kurumi is perfectly aware of that, that's why she doesn't let go of it. And I personally wouldn't either.</br>  <br>Yuki is extremely perceptive. Kurumi was cold ever since she almost turned back when she was bitten.</br>  What if the twist is that glasses isn't planning anything at all?  <br>shit twist<br>Blood must be shed for the Blood God.</br></br>  <br>The twist is that  they're all futa </br>  <br>She is also extremely smart and know how to raise the morale of everyone.<br>When they were given the choice between going to randall or the emergency shelter, she changed the topic for it to work vs university.</br></br>  <br> 米軍根岸住宅 <br>I think I found who's to blame.</br></br>  On page 16 of chapter 37, Miki says to turn on the radio all of a sudden. Why does she think to do that?  <br>The radio was already on. She heard something and asked them to increase the vol.</br>  <br>She says "turn on the radio!" Could that just be a translation error or a result of translating from Korean rather than the original Japanese?</br>    I swear, if they fuck this scene up, I'm gonna go to their studio and stuff a shovel so far up their asses they gonna have to live the rest of their lives with it.  <br>Don't buy it.

The anime's not going to go anywhere where it's relevant.  <br>It's going to be very awkward when this is over and she tells the survivors "hurr durr I was just pretending to be retard"<br> Ain't that right, Megu-nee? </br></br>  Why didn't they try to take to the ocean yet? I mean wouldn't that be your first thought if you were stuck on an Island with zombies?  <br>no shit captain</br>  <br>You just want to hear Yuki shouting UMI DAA!</br>  <br>I'm here again.
