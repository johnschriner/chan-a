[ I feel kind of pissed off at Tanigawa and Kadokawa over the whole lack of Haruhi S3. <br><br>I don't get it. There's more than enough stuff to do 2 more seasons even without Tanigawa publishing more chapters. What's with Kadokawa?</br></br>  No idea, but rather than a third season I'd much rather some OVAs and Movies (for the longer arcs) as hopefully it would mean better quality.<br><br>Anyway, have there been any news on the next novel or are we still in the dark?</br></br>  <br>The last thing he wrote in the last 4 years was an 11 pages short story, so no.</br>  <br>As I understand it, Kadokawa wants to wait until the next novel is ready to come out and then use a new anime series to make people buy it. If they did it now they could get new people to buy the old books but the ones who are already into Haruhi wouldn't buy anything.</br>  <br>And the ones who were already into Haruhi would buy the new book regardless if there's an anime or not.</br>  <br>Would they?<br>It's been almost half a decade.</br></br>  <br>yes. volume 10-11 selling like hotcakes despite released after many years</br>  <br>Fuck there are still 5 books left, I don't understand why KyoAni didn't just animate them from the start. Haruhi was a huge hit.</br>  <br>They haven't the rights to do so.</br>  <br>They only had the right for the first 4 books? If I'm not mistaken, weren't the 5th and 6th books also written when the anime was airing?</br>  <br>They didn't have the rights to those books either. They were just contracted to animate them.</br>  http://kat.cr/blog/SushiKushi/post/<wbr>an-open-letter-to-nyaa-herkz/<br><br>ayy</br></br></wbr>  <br>  Whats up guys? <br><br>Fuck off scene fags.</br></br></br>  What the hell? Anime uploads are no longer allowed on nyaa???  <br>It's just one sub group, but still, that sucks.</br>   AnimeRG <br><br>And nothing of value was lost.</br></br>  literally who  <br>I've never even heard of those guys. That's how insignificant they are.</br>  <br>Damn that sucks. Any idea why?</br>  Is this why SubaHibi is delayed? herkz please.  It would be interesting to know the reason for the block though.<br><br>I doubt it's because of bad quality when shit like Hadena is allowed on Nyaa.</br></br>  Just the cartel protecting their territory.  <br>Hadena is allowed ironically because Hadena have a history of making people shit their lungs out with laughter.</br>  <br>Nyaa mafia.<br><br>Nothing new.</br></br></br>  Just your usual Nyaa cartel bullying.  <br>I don't give a fuck who uploads what and it doesn't matter if AnimeRG's subs are shit. The fact that he's bitching about herkz makes me feel better. Any negative feedback that this guy gets is good in my book.</br>  DAIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZZZZZZ   herkz <br><br>literally who</br></br>   Fansub Drama <br><br>Really?</br></br>   nyaa <br>literally why the age of streaming and instant anime watching is here stop being a autist hipster shit and wathc anime like the rest of the world does</br>  <br>http://ask.fm/Xythar/answer/1307577<wbr>23000</wbr></br>  so, what exactly where they banned for?  <br>And we thought fansubbing was ded</br>  <br>That faggot with the giant pony avatar.</br>  <br>moot's second name</br>  Are these the same faggots that tried to tell me TT was redundant? I don't even use their dumb site, why does this matter?

You're allowed to upload tv encodes from some stations but not from the others? How come?</br></br>  the fansub cartel is known to bounce people off of nyaa. it's a good reason why we should never let fucking daiz completely consolidate his grip.<br><br>like Doki was b&amp;, too, because one of their members was stirring shit with nyaa. but the funny thing is the guy who GOT doki b&amp; was kicked out of their group for being a fucking faggot, but the guy joined one of the sub cartel's approved groups while Doki remained blacklisted. <br><br>Herkz+Daiz just carry stupid grudges.</br></br></br></br>  Isn't AnimeRG just another Horriblesubs clone?<br><br>They sometimes rip whenever HS fucks up or is late with their rips.</br></br>  <br>Because some stations have terrible video quality.</br>  <br>Anon, you are not the smartest guy around, are you?</br>  <br>Okay, but why should that be banned?<br>It's one thing to ban people because they steal subs and stuff like that, but this seems a bit over the top.</br></br>  <br> [herkz] bitrate-starved remakes <br>deadfish<br><br> [herkz] not flagging torrents that use other people's subs as remakes <br><br>Why aren't commie flagged as remakes for using CR's subs?

Station means TV station, right? Or did I misread that?</br>  <br>Because there is no reason to upload a 4k video of a station that only broadcasts in 720P? Use your brain for a second.</br>  <br>It makes no sense to upload 1080p (because mostly they're upscales from 720p)</br>  <br> Herkz+Daiz just carry stupid grudges. <br><br>They're unnecessary retards. Nyaa is unneeded compared with the huge amount of other anime trackers out there and fansubs will hopefully die even further so we're left with actual fansubs and not these e-whores</br></br></br>  Commie a  meme shit  Is there a bigger faggot than herkz left in the anime scene? Koda was notorious bitch she doesn't even come close to this colossal homosexual.  <br><br> mostly <br><br>Digital anime has finally caught up to the point where you can go for 1080p on BD releases to get the best possible quality.</br></br></br></br>  Scenefags are fucking autists.

HS dropped the ball once in a while.</br>   mods deletes legitimate anime threads <br> but not this fansub drama bullshit </br>  <br>The wording by herkz is admittedly a bit confusing if you're not familiar with the rules, but "uploading 1080p encodes from CR" here means that they were making their own 1080p encodes from web sources like CR, which is currently disallowed by default:<br><br> Web source video is limited to 1280x720p or source resolution, whichever is lower. <br><br>(You can try to argue for exceptions - this is what happened with Working S3 this season, but these guys obviously never did that)<br><br>And for TV channel 1080p encodes:<br><br> TV source video is by default limited to 1440x1080p. The BS11, BS-NTV, NHK-BS Premium, and WOWOW channels are limited to 1920x1080p.

You really are that predictable, huh?</br>   Daiz will never get executed for his crimes against humanity    2015 <br> nyaa <br><br>just let this meme die already and move on to AB like the rest of us</br></br></br>  <br> now <br>They have been doing this for many years, but it's not the same as reencoding without downscaling.</br></br>  <br>And they're all Daiz.</br>  <br>I'm killing time while I wait for NNB to be typeset.<br><br><br>Sure, no prob.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't they died off?</br>  <br>HS surely at least reencodes Funi, if nothing else.

Anyone can do what they do and be within the rules.<br><br>Anyone can also use any simulcast script they like without it counting as a remake, since those scripts are available to all. The only time it's a remake is if you use the script from another fansub release.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi releases are shitty though, any group that rip it must reencode that shit.</br>  <br>Anon let me tell you something.  You are Daiz, too. </br>    <br>There has only been an experience with a couple of shows last season m8.</br>  <br>It only does that if you're stupid. There's a difference between one reencode and two. Again, why not just use untouched video without making it even worse than it already may be?</br>  <br><br> They don't? <br>pic related. I guess it's ok for Comeme, but no one else.</br></br></br>  anyone who gives a fuck uses AB anyways  Who the fuck cares about AnimeRG?  <br>Did you know?

I thought they just watched their shit on youtube?</br>  <br> He's a big bully <br> no 4u joke <br>They really need to step their game up</br></br></br>  <br>Then link me NNB 2nd episode on AB.</br>  <br>Every casual and their mom has utorrent.</br>  <br>Commie's basically the godfather of the cartel nowadays.</br>  <br>I excrete him two times a day I i eat enough fiber so there no problem.</br>  <br>Seems like every time someone gets banned on Nyaa they always give the same answer "they didn't follow the rules!" but refuse to state specifically what rule it was they broke.<br><br>Sounds fishy to me. I don't mind much when it's just shit groups like this, but still I'd rather those guys didn't arbitrarily decide to shut out groups like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, it doesn't matter. Who gives a fuck about some random group that "produced" shit? This is about herkz being the biggest faggot on this planet.</br>  <br><br>I thought this was  funny. </br></br>  <br>By the way, I hope you don't take people here seriously when they talk about subs, parroting shit about the "cartel"; it's all jokes, like Daiz killing fansubs and such (he's still a faggot for being a fakku s̶h̶i̶l̶l unofficial PR). The ones who are serious are either newfags or straight-out idiots.</br>  <br/>  <br>Aside from not being funny it's not even well done.<br>If you're going to pull this shit at least put the effort in and use curves rather than straight lines.</br></br>  <br>HS does re-encode Funi because at least the colour palette is changed.<br><br><br>So are CR.<br><br><br> There's a difference between one reencode and two. <br>Yea, the difference being that one of them is by a cartel-approved group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   not using AB <br> not having daiz filtered <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Ever consider that you're a fucking faggot?</br>  <br>But then he wouldn't be  edgy </br>  <br>Well ok then, I guess that's fair enough.<br><br>Still haven't seen an adequate explanation for why Doki is banned though</br></br></br>  <br>It's shit and the retard who QC'd it should hang himself.<br>And you who whiteknights him should kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Sorry we're not as cool as you.</br>  <br>Was shitposting part of your plan?</br>  We have a picture of Daiz, can Xythar or herkz give us one? I always imagined Xythar to be 6'2 and pretty lean.  <br> Yea, the difference being that one of them is by a cartel-approved group. <br>Ok, I see you're just pretending to be retarded.</br></br>  <br>Trying to take down Nyaa's domain is not a good enough reason?</br>  <br>The answer is that daiz is trying to kill fansubbing.</br>  <br>AB is still not ideal for currently airing stuff. When they get the kinks worked out of that I'll probably not bother with nyaa much anymore. (Though then again most sub groups upload directly to Nyaa so even then I'd just be imposing extra delay on myself to go elsewhere.)</br>  <br>What do you expect from an anime fansub tracker? I'm just glad they channel their faggotry by dealing with annoying uploaders who contribute nothing.</br>  <br> wanting these plebs to go to AB <br>It's like you wish reddit will die without realizing that they're there as containment and therefore necessary evil.</br></br>  <br>No one cares about the faggot in the OP, after reading his blog post, he's probably some reddit faggot who just recently got into anime. This is about herkz and the memecartel</br>  <br>That has nothing to do with their fansubs. Nyaa decided that their fansubs should not be uploaded to the site. This should only be done because of a specific problem with the content itself, not some other retarded scene drama.</br>  <br>I don't even know why you keep replying to me. You are obviously from the cartel and I obviously would never believe your lies.</br>  <br>There's another faggot, see .</br>  <br>herkz is a Russian that can't squat.</br>  <br>That has been explained many times. They uploaded Princess Lover OVA (hentai) to Nyaa instead of sukebe. Multiple times despite the warning.</br>  <br> not making use of the multiple options <br> being such a snowflake and using filters <br><br>Stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AB is by far worse than reddit. Just see the IDC and you'll understand. At least reddit watches anime. Also, most ABusers have reddit and MAL accounts, and there is even a podcast. <br>Stop being so elitist.</br></br>  <br>So because of that one bad upload, now none of their good uploads are allowed on the site either, no matter who actually uploads them?<br><br>That's bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck do you even care whats on nyaa besides elitist bullshit? its just a fucking tracker.<br><br>if people want to download animeRG just let them</br></br></br>  <br> not making use of the multiple options <br><br>hi reddit</br></br></br>  <br>I used to, but these days I don't pay a lot of attention. I have a lot of things to do and reading random flames and shitposts isn't very productive.<br><br><br>Nope. They just tag it with the correct colour matrix. You can do the same with two keypresses in madVR, and it should be pretty obvious that no re-encoding is happening there.<br><br><br>Every day, anon, every day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Absolute worst people in fansubbing rankings:<br><br>1. People who don't contribute anything and dedicate a site to complaining about subs, even though they don't know Japanese (Dark Sage)<br>2. People who don't contribute anything and complain (/a/)<br><br>that is all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>suck my butt</br></br>  <br>Nice one AnimeRG devs.<br><br><br> not a troll torrent <br>Yeah, that's definitely not a troll torrent, but you can't say that the subs were meme-free.<br><br><br> HS does re-encode Funi because at least the colour palette is changed. <br>I won't bother explain but it's just some parameter in the MKV container.<br> Yea, the difference being that one of them is by a cartel-approved group. <br>So you're the type of anon that have been baited hard and trust 4chan meme? Welcome here, newfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hahahaha, top kek thread. <br><br>Pays off knowing Japanese, I can just observe all this from a distance.</br></br>  <br> hentai <br>TLR is also hentai, then?</br></br>  <br> joining a private tracker for the forums <br>lol</br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, it was done in such a manner(through softsubs) than it technically didn't violate the rules, but as such it would come down to a mod decision on whether to keep it or not. I assume herkz giggled at [WhyNot]'s release so it was allowed and he helped create the s2 end episode shenanigans as well so it was also allowed.<br><br>A double standard, but I can't say that it surprises me.<br><br><br>Hi random Comeme twitter follower!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Commie <br> Effort </br></br>  <br> Every day, anon, every day. <br><br>Did you figure it out?</br></br></br>  <br>Because I can't find what I want with their garbage polluting it. Also kept uploading bad encodes with hardsubs and dubs of individual episodes of series aired years ago in various resolutions like the dumb attention whoring faggots they are.</br>  <br>So now we learned that we can put up whatever shit on video as long as it's softsubbed, upload it on nyaa, and that will be perfectly fine.<br>I'm going to screencap this post and save it for future use.</br></br>  <br>Couldn't they deal with it like adults and just ban the users instead of the group releases?</br>  <br><br>I want to join you, how is the view?</br></br>  Wait, I thought everyone here used Crunchyroll?<br><br>Don't you fucking faggots even support the industry</br></br>   nyaa <br>reddit: the tracker</br>  <br>Dark Sage is the best thing to have come out of anime.

Your point?<br><br>Note: I don't give a shit about AB's community and freely use whichever (AB, Nyaa, BBT etc) has better seeds. However, deriding the entire site based on one forum that exists practically as a containment forum, is just silly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daiz is HorribleSubsLeader and HorribleSubs is a CR proxy.</br>  <br>How do you know I'm not an encoder and fansubber of fine Japanimation who likes shitposting on the side?</br>  <br> Because I can't find what I want with their garbage polluting it. <br><br>congratz you are actually retarded</br></br></br>   cartel <br>Nice meme everyone.</br>  <br>Yeah, you go on downloading your torrents from MAL then.<br><br>Oh wait, you can't, you fucking retard</br></br></br>  I love fansub drama. I think I almost like it more than anime itself. So many theories and conspiracy's, the fun never ends!  I FUCKING love how neither Xythar nor Daiz can come up with anything smart/fun to defend themselves but are butthurt enough to stay in the thread shitposting with retarded one liners  <br>Princess Lover OVA, not the series, IS hentai.</br>  Is this the shitposting thread of the hour?  <br>You're right, honestly.

It's all jokes and fun here with some legit stupidity every now and then. If you don't have the time, can't get the humor, or you can't appreciate the variety, including the dumb shit, then you really shouldn't bother.

Then one of their members tried to take down the NyaaTorrents domain. He was caught with his pants down, and Doki then tried to claim that he didn't actually do anything and that his "e-mail was hacked" and whatnot (even though the person in question had exclaimed multiple times how he hates Nyaa and ran his own tracker, yes, clearly he wouldn't do something like this out of pettiness). This is what got them banned from the site. <br><br> For years they claimed the person in question did nothing wrong, though a while back someone from Doki finally admitted that the guy was indeed behind it. <br><br>(Albeit the group leader has continued to insist the guy did nothing wrong even after the previous case, so it seems like the official party of line of Doki continues to deny reality)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To Nyaa and Herkz.<br>Normally I would say fuck you guys, but for once you've done good.

Unfortunately a lot of the people here need your subs to understand shows and then come here to discuss them. I'm sure your script is riddled with other mistakes, but the one that really stuck out was that last line in episode 3 of Symphogear because everyone posted a screencap of your subs and started acting confused. Apparently you guys translated 胸に浮かばない as "I forgot". Any chance you guys could start getting the lines translated correctly so that when big plot developments happen we don't get a bunch of confused and angry people because you misinterpreted a scene and completely rewrote the meaning? Do you not have competent translators that understand both languages, because that's really important for being able to exchange ideas between the two languages. Your constant need to turn everything into hyper colloquial English or slang doesn't really make for a good translation or a script that "flows" well like some of your supporters think.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> butthole scans presents : manga <br> it's written in some kind of evil papyrus looking font with another series' anime character slapped on a white background <br> lists credits on a separate page <br> next page is a fucking comic the redrawer made talking about blogshit  <br> next page is just fucking blank for no reason, nothing on it <br> next page is the fucking cover, spine, and back <br> another fucking white page <br> fanart  <br> finally the manga starts <br> water mark on every 4th page in full color near the very middle of the page <br> it's 16 pages because they cut the release in half <br> full of spelling errors, have to wonder if the translator actually speaks English  <br> ANOTHER FUCKING SHITTY COMIC BEGGING FOR TRANSLATORS/TYPESETTERS USING CHARACTERS FROM THE MANGA <br> credits again <br> white page <br> some shitty fan art and them hosting some kind of event and using the scan release to advertise it <br> this portion takes up 3 of its own pages  <br> black page <br> white page <br> white page with a character's face in a small circle in the bottom <br> white page <br> next manga  <br><br>It's like a hot draft coming out of someone's butthole and straight into your face.

In what way does time erasing allow you to phase people into shit? I've heard multiple attempts at explaining it, but never been convinced.  <br><br> Waaaaagh, goodies died <br><br>God forbid the results of the final battle actually accurately reflect the given abilities of the fighters and not hinge on the MC winning due to sheer plot armour like most parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds like it<br>like all games that Time Stop has been in the rule has always been either prevent time stop before it happens, or have someone who can stop time to counter it<br><br><br> EoH is coming out on PS3 too right? <br>yes.<br> Hope it will get a Yurop release. <br>already confirmed<br><br><br>i always thought he used the erased time to place her over the bars and then when "time resumed" she was disoriented and confused (King Crimsons greatest ability) and then fell onto them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "i cant handle good guys losing and dying for once!! why didnt anyone pull something out of their ass like my other shounen?!?! Wheres Stone Free Requiem?!?!?!?!" <br>every god damn time.</br></br>  <br>King Crimson skips the cause but leaves the effect. With 「FATE」being a solid part in JoJo, seeing Narancia on the bars with Epitaph means it is absolutely going to happen no matter what. Maybe he was punched or thrown into it, we just don't know how he got on the fence, but as long as Diavolo uses King Crimson, Narancia would have absolutely died.<br>Basically if I was walking at 1m/s and King Crimson "skipped" time then I would find myself 5-10m from my original position, I just wouldn't know how.</br></br>  <br>It's been 20 years since GioGio, just let it go. It will never ever be explained.<br><br><br>Nigga it's not the fact that the cast died. It's the fact that Jotaro failed to beat Pucci. In a world where people have SUTANDO POWAH, wouldn't you keep your timestop power in check? Also, part 6 is still a really good part, I'm not denying that. Jolyne's smarts were Trickster-tier and I'd put her in the top 3 Jojos.<br><br> plot armour <br>If anything there was a lot of PIS in the last fight, and Pucci having a myriad of abilities with his stand also being a punch ghost is stacked as fuck when compared to Stone Free. You could tell Araki wanted to do something about quantum strings with Jolyne's mobius strip, but he never went through with it. Maybe he just got tired of that universe because of the shocking powercreep that happened as the parts went on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this looks like the work of a enemey stand haha ora ora bro jotaro dies read the mango  <br>who are you quoting<br><br>the ending would have been infinitely better if Emporio didn't win</br></br></br>  <br>haha ora ora bro read the manga</br>  <br> who are you quoting <br>some dipshit who thinks SO is the worst jojo part<br>it doesnt even have to be the best, but anyone who would put it that low is just a sore anime kiddo sad their favorite anime character Jotaro got killed with the entire cast except Emporio<br><br> the ending would have been infinitely better if Emporio didn't win <br>you're absolutely correct and i 100% agree<br>felt kind of forced to be honest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> some dipshit who thinks SO is the worst jojo part <br>it is the worst part read the manga</br></br>  <br><br><br>do not reply to shitposters</br></br></br>  <br> Pucci having a myriad of abilities with his stand <br><br>Name a single main character stand that didn't have multiple abilities. <br><br> stacked as fuck when compared to Stone Free <br><br>That was the entire point being made. The heroes SHOULD have died because Pucci not only outsmarted them and constantly achieved his goals but had a more powerful stand. Compare that to part 3 where Jotaro has a shittier version of the same stand and wins just because he is supposed to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so far im havin fun hopefully the older jotaro has a cooler GHA</br>  <br>haha ora ora bro *does a king crimson attack*</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br> shittier version of the same stand and wins just because he is supposed to. <br><br>No, he had the same stand as DIO, only DIO fully developed it faster than he did. He didn't win because he was "supposed" to, DIO lost focus because he was high and whatnot, and was not in his usual mood since he found it Jotaro could stop time too.<br><br> Stand with multiple abilities <br>Mosts stands had two abilities at most.

I think he thought "well KC broke the bars and put Narancia into them, then when time resumed the damage of the bars was erased but Narancia stayed inside" then forgot and broke the bars visually when he came back once he had decided KC can actually break inanimate objects...but it could also cut the hand of that one guy... fucking KC HOW DOES IT WORK</br>  Ayy Dio  <br>whats good?</br>  <br>Gay priest heard Dio</br>  Why didn't Diego just turn Valentine into a dinosaur?  <br>It was trademarked in EU.<br>I can't see them not releasing it in the US, but didn't ASB sell like shit in there.</br></br>  <br>0m range stand</br>  <br>Because Diego sucks dick tbh.</br>  <br>Do you really think he could win against a dinosaur with Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap? Valentine's patriotism is too strong to let him follow the orders of a limey, and Diego knows that he shouldn't turn Valentine into an even greater enemy.</br>  I've been told that there are things that are made up in the older Part 05 scans. Is that true, and if so, could you provide an example?  <br>They're lying, they're araki fanboys who don't want to admit he fucked up</br>  <br>He cut his fucking throat, m8. He obviously touched him enough times.<br><br><br>So basically Araki conveniently forgot about his ability to allow Valentine to win?</br></br></br></br>  <br>didn't he cut D4C instead of him?</br>  <br>Oh, if it's just boring or made poorly in parts, I can deal with that. I'd just like to avoid having incorrect information or interpretations of the characters if at all possible</br>  <br>The translation is emotionless and might miss on subtleties (which jojo doesn't usually have) , but that's it. It's boring and only the stand fights are good, at least those where Giorno doesn't pull a Jotaro.</br>  <br>Well, alright then. Thank you very much.</br>  <br>He did cut both, but maybe you're right. Maybe he only wounded Valentine with fatal wounds and thus did not need to turn him into a dinosaur. he could have just attacked his leg and made him one though. He can transform people pretty fast, like instantly.</br>  Well, I just finished Part 6, planning to start 7, but from what I've heard of Johnny he's completely different from Jonathan, who's one of my favourites  <br>I thought that Dr Ferdinand was the one that had the ability to turn others into dinosaurs, and Diego could only could control those dinosaurs and control his own state.</br>  <br>He's better</br>  <br>If anything Gyro is more similar to Jonathan, you'll probably like him.</br>  <br>Nah, Diego made dinosaurs for Soundman and also turned flees and other creatures into dinosaurs later.

Sometimes you really have to wonder how people can listen to certain dubs without reflexively shutting them off.  <br>Oh come on you aren't even trying</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4wG<wbr>84efH4sw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>There's actually even worse DBZ dubs out there, but at least this one has some entertainment value.</br></br>  <br>TPCi dub of Pokemon: horrible voice actors, horrible script writing, replacing more music than 4Kids did, terrible 30 second themes...fucking hell.</br>  Anything where they try to make Bryce Papenbrook try to sound like some hotblooded action hero.  <br>If you really want to put yourself through an even worse DBZ dub.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xcS<wbr>3svAZPBY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>He's still better than Sarah Natochenny.</br>  <br>4Kids Sonic X<br>4Kids One Piece<br>TPCi Pokemon <br>Malaysian DBZ<br>Big Green DBZ<br>Odex YGO: DM<br>Odex One Piece</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, only noteworthy thing she has done is voice Ash and then got replaced.</br>  <br>No, she's still fucking up his voice to this day.</br>  <br>this is fan dub right? no way something like this can be real</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>I ask the same about this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bxT<wbr>xlKvQFU8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>All of them</br>  Don't be so negative. Tell me instead, what is the best English dub in your eyes?  There is literally nothing wrong with dubs    <br>Natochenny is still voicing him to this day horribly is what I mean: Papenbrook isn't doing that.</br>  <br>I think Papenbrook's miscasting is worse.</br>  <br> nothing wrong with dubs <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bxT<wbr>xlKvQFU8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1-a<wbr>Leo_Ep1k</wbr>  [ ]<br>http://noodlerama.tumblr.com/post/9<wbr>8016557586<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hN9<wbr>BvB24gjA</wbr>  [ ]</br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wolf's Rain.</br>  <br>No, because he's not been miscast for almost a decade, and his Red voice is less painful on the ears than Knotz's Red or Natochenny's Ash.<br><br>Papenbrook isn't great, but not cancer tier on the ears like them.</br></br></br>  <br> giving the main star of the movie the worst voice <br><br>Also Nintendo trying way too hard to hype up their new Pokemon.</br></br></br>  <br>Shin-chan dub</br>  <br>TPCi a shit: even 4Kids was better.</br>  <br>Kirby was pretty good.</br>  <br>I think the Cromartie dubs are hilarious in their own way. It's not even remotely close to the Japanese humor you find in the voices.</br>  <br>I like how that implies 4Kids Pokemon and YGO: DM are better than TPCi Pokemon and Odex YGO DM, because they are.</br>  <br>TopKek</br>  <br> that aussie accent in the dbz vid <br>ahahahahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br>  <br>TPCi dub of Pokemon is ear rape.</br>  <br>What did they hire the guy from The Room to do some dub work?<br><br>I'll cut that one some slack since it is a fandub and likely by kids no less.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder this is an actress who has voiced a lead for 9 years in a row now:<br><br>http://noodlerama.tumblr.com/post/9<wbr>8016557586</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently, a Boys and Girls Club thought that the Funimation dub was too violent and made that fandub version instead:<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/vie<wbr>wtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=17187</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>That shit's no official, so I can let it go: the new Pokemon dub is cancer, however, and that shit cannot be forgiven.</br>  <br>Oh dear god why am I hearing this?</br>  US Cardcaptors dub is easily the worst English dub ever made.<br><br>It changed the show almost entirely. Ironically enough, despite the fact the dubbers and writers probably put in way more work with the shit dub than they would have with just a simple translation, they ended up with a far worse product as a result.</br></br>  <br>I hear some people like the changes.</br>  <br>4kids is criminally underrated. Their censorship was bad but their voices were spot-on. Usually.</br>  <br>This is how bad TPCi Pokemon is, that's why: 4Kids outdid them- THAT 4Kids, yes.</br>  <br>4Kids did the superior Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh DM dubs over the alternatives: TPCi and Odex are fucking cancer across the board.<br><br>The current English Brock and Ash VAs in particular are fucking atrocious: it's like they were told not to take a shit for a week, then smoke a few packs, and then record.</br></br></br>  <br>The one on Adult Swim? I remember that one being alright. Super Milk Chan was fantastic, but I don't even know if it was actually Japanese in origin.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GU3<wbr>Gg696yrM</wbr>  [ ]  <br>A lot of them. It took me years to get into anime because I didn't want to listen to bad voice acting, or read text while listening to higher-pitched Nip voices.<br>Then when I asked /a/, they said I was a faggot and told me to watch Evangelion and Bebop.</br></br>  <br>But that one is superior to the original.<br>Hentai dubs make hentai watchable.</br></br>  /a/ pretty damn casual after all.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wxP<wbr>sucXGkm4</wbr>  [ ]  <br> no perkel </br>  <br> clannad <br> bad dub <br>come on, it's better than the 40 year old MC and 5 year old females that the japanese version had.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember Shaman King allowing a lot of shit for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but there's a difference between "bad dubbing" and things like that. I usually ignore what happens to shows that get adapted in the DIC / 4kids fashions because they've been redesigned entirely.<br><br><br><br>It was, and ADV did two dubs for Super Milk Chan. One is as close to or as literal a translation as possible to the Japanese and the other is a more localized script. The former comes off as dry and unfunny while the latter makes the jokes work but certainly incorporates some pop culture referencing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of them. <br>Out of 10 English dubs you might find one that's tolerable. While English dubs have come a long way they're still inferior to Japanese dubs. The small talent pool and screen actor guild really prevent English dubbed anime from doing anything decent.</br></br>  The Yuri Kuma Arashi dub is pretty atrocious.

The Guin Saga dub is still somewhat watchable (overall, that video is a montage of some of the worse moments), if not remarkably cheesy because of how hard the actors try to sound ye old. Really it's like one level lower than the Spice and Wolf Dub, which was fine.</br>  The dubbed negima voice is probably the only thing worse than japanese goku<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9tN<wbr>IpJYEA6I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  As cancerous as this thread is, I'm surprised it isn't worse.

To those who think that Eva wasn't influential or a breakthrough in the medium I invite you to think about one thing. How many adult or young-adult oriented and avant-garde/experimental tv series (not films or ovas) do you know that aired before and after 1995? Just compare.  <br> Eva <br> adult or young-adult oriented <br> avant-garde/experimental <br><br>hi reddit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not talking about eva just what was before and after. Eva didn't start out as adult-oriented but ended up being moved to an evening time slot for adults. If you don't see how Eva was unconventional and experimental with its genre you shouldn't just go back to reddit, you should probably go back to facebook.</br>  <br>Evangelion is Anno mashing up a bunch of things he likes from other series, anime, books, people, etc. <br>It's not that it was the first of its kind, it's just that it was the first of its kind to be financially successful.</br></br>  <br>And how is that not important? It allowed directors to have more creative freedom and create works with more unconventional narratives, art designs and exposition. There was a surge of experimental movies in between 84 and 88 but evangelion influenced both series and movies and the boom exists probably to this day or at least till 2012.<br><br>As I said just think about how many of these kinds of series there were after and before eva.</br></br></br>  <br>You want to see actual directive liberty watch either Akira or Steamboy.
