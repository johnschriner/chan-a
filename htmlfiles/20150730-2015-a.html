[ What happened to him?  Died of autism.    <br>This is the true injustice out of all of this.</br>  He is still in jail. Got like 7 years or something.  He's banned from watching anime.  I just started the weirdest fucking show...  <br>are you slow?</br>      <br>why are her fingers wrapped up?</br>  <br> town of about 15 people <br>Oarai schoolship houses about 1000 times that. And Kuromorimine houses 100000 people.</br></br>  All aboard the hype TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>I could see why doffy shots himself in front of this horny version of whitebeard</br></br>  <br>It's more th at he's trying to find these non definite ways that may be able to kill him.<br>So while he wouldn't jump into a volcano or swallow a pill of cyanide he'd jump off of a sky island or try to tank an asteroid or fight someone.</br></br>  <br> &gt;side character </br>  1. if his immortality is Devil fruit based. why not just eat another one.<br>2. if its not devil fruit based. why not eat 2 of them<br>3. If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times?</br></br>  So who beat kaido those 7 times?<br>White beard and shanks?</br>  Kaido looks a lot cooler than I ever figured he would. How fucking strong does Shanks have to be to intimidate him into not attacking Whitebeard who was clearly stronger than Kaidou even in old age and poor health.  Anybody ever finish one of these?  <br>The quality is awful.</br>  <br>What did you expect from MS paint?</br>  <br> all these tits <br> Lain as imouto <br>You're one deep person</br></br></br>  /a/utism: the thread.  <br>It's a good kind of autism.</br>  Akari appreciation thread!<br> plus Chinashit defamation thread </br>  Tell me about it.  <br>I want to hug you.</br>  <br>I want Namori-sensei to coordinate my outfits!<br><br><br>i want to kiss you</br></br></br></br>    <br>Welcome back!</br>  She's the kindest girl in existence. Prove me wrong. Protip: you can't     <br>Have fun!<br><br><br>Really sexy!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, Apple~chi.</br>  <br>S-sorry.</br>    http://www.mangapanda.com/boruto-on<wbr>eshot/1<br><br>Mitsuki is cute I tell you. Cute !</br></br></wbr>  <br> implying he can be a bad guy/girl when he gave us best boy </br>  <br>The previous Hokages did not get to pick their successors, otherwise Danzo would not have had a shot at becoming the one after Tsunade.<br>Technically it is the feudal lord who appoints the head of the mercenary city state under his vague vassalage, but he is heavily advised by the clan heads and the elders who look for someone who is sufficiently popular, powerful and connected to the previous Kages in some way, probably reflecting various clan interests.<br><br>It's a real shame the main focus of the series was Uchiha fucking shits and DARKNESS, because we could have had a story focusing on missions and intra- and inter-village politics, with some shit with the feudal lords and elemental nations thrown in. And when the story would inevitably go to a Fourth World War it would not be against faceless plant zombies and characters we've already had a resolution with, but against fellow (ninja wizard) humans fighting for their country like the good guys, maybe having to face characters they have previously met under more positive circumstances in joint missions or in the chuunin exams.<br>Or we could have vaguely gay, continent-busting Uchihas ruining everything for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The previous Hokages did not get to pick their successors <br>Tobirama made Sarutobi the hokage out of the blue.</br></br>  <br>Hashirama picked his brother. Tobirama picked Hiruzen. Hiruzen picked Minato. Minato died and then Hiruzen died and here we have the only case of someone other than the Hokage picking the next Hokage. Tsunade picked Kakashi and then Kakashi picked Naruto.<br><br>Naruto's a military dictator.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We see the feudal lord and the elders/clan heads actively discussing who to pick to succeed Tsunade.<br>So out of the successions we see in any detail there's the elders asking Jiraiya to either take the post or hunt down Tsunade and make her take the post, and the above case.<br>That points to succession not being directly controlled by the Hokage. By all means it is possible to steer the process if you make precautions while alive so that it goes to someone you want, and it might be a different matter if you step down on your own accord.<br>The real question, then, is whether Naruto would step down after, say, ten, fifteen years like Kakashi.</br></br></br></br></br>   Berserker Vlad <br> Saber Lancelot/Giles <br> Lancer with a blue version of Archer's half-jacket <br> Rumors of Heroic Spirit Waver <br> More news coming in every second <br>Looks like I'm not sleeping tonight.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>What Nasu says have never meant shit.</br>  <br>We know this since Fate/extra anon</br>  <br>If that's real, then Heroic Spirit Waver is real since the Caster is El-Melloi II. Also, who's the second Saber supposed to be? Sounds like the name should be Arteria or something, but doesn't ring any bells.</br>  k-on is objectively the best thing ever created alongside haibane and tex  <br> crying ritsu.jpg <br> THAT webm. <br>Fuck you anon, you made me tear up.</br></br></br>  <br>sorry for making you cry, anon.<br>Here, this should cheer you up <br><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437889583831.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143788958383<wbr>1.webm</wbr></a></br></br></br>  <br>I knew exactly where you were going with that, but you know what, I watched it anyway.<br>Sure that scene makes the rain fall particularly hard but I see it as their most beautiful moment together.<br>They come to terms with it,  well not Azusa  and so have I.<br>HTT will always have a place in my heart.</br></br></br></br>  <br> sexualizing the K-on's <br><br>Please don't.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=18O<wbr>bVdcCkdI</wbr>  [ ]<br>what do you do when you realize everything you love is a lie? If I didn't have a sister, I legitimately don't know how I could go on.<br>How do you guys cope with this?</br></br></br>  Is yu yu hakusho underatted or overrated?  <br>The English version is made by Americans and only watched by Americans and westaboos.<br><br>Its dub also featured a Leprechaun-talking Jin, mispronunciations of Urameshi's name, cartoonish voices, and horrid dub changes par for the course when it was made.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I never saw Seiya and thought the first parts of Jojo were glorious, but damn if HnK didn't get repetitive real quick with Bruce Lee beating down those mohawk fucks. Entire thing was a complete fucking disappointment outside of the fight with Raoh and that air slashing guy with green hair.</br></br>  <br>HxH is better written and less predictable, but if you're just after a generic fun battle shounen, YYH is more suitable.</br>  <br>The manga is always on hiatus tho. It's a slow pace series.</br>  <br>Under, it's way better than HxH.</br>  New chapter just came out and we get more information on  Kaidou <br><br>How do you kill a man that is  immortal  also he fought whitebeard and lived.</br></br>  <br>He should have a fruit, solely because if he doesn't to ensure nobody asks why he didn't drown himself, it'll just create another problem.<br><br>The problem will be: why doesn't he just eat a devil fruit THEN drown himself? He has a constant supply of artificial ones. So you can't say he can't acquire one.</br></br></br>  <br>A really fucking bad translation from mangapanda.</br>    <br>Luffy should never become immortal</br>  <br> thinking shank'ss crew needs any fruits <br><br>ur the fruit m8</br></br></br>  All waifus are cute.<br><br>What is your waifu's room like? Does it reflect her personality?</br></br>  <br>I work 16 hours, hours man, and I sleep 5 hours before that.</br>  <br>the fuck do you do?</br>  <br>Work at restaurants prep food/bus/put up/set away tables, chairs, etc.</br>  <br>how many hours a week?</br>  <br>Varies but usually 72.</br>  Why is /a/ so afraid of fujoshis when they are such a small fanbase that yurifags outnumber them by a landslide?  The only reason I can see why people would think that fujos have an actual large fanbase is simply because they are loud as fuck and they make the largest amount of porn.<br><br>Know what else acts like that? Bronies.</br></br>  <br>Add Locodol on that list as it was already confirmed yuri by the scriptwriter.<br>Unless you are still waiting for confirmation from the mangaka</br></br>  A general dislike of 3DPD, being grossed out by homos, feeling threatened by women in 'their' hobby, a variety of misconceptions about the entire concept including that fujos actually believe characters are gay (they don't) and that fujobait shows are always overtly gay (it's usually pretty subtle).<br><br>Fujos are not a small fanbase though, they have significant buying power in nipland. I don't see how anyone could get bothered by them when all they really do is draw porn.</br></br>  I WANT TO IMPREGNATE NERO AND MAKE HER HAPPY FOREVER  But seriously, I would kill to creampie Nero.  <br>Highly doubtful.<br><br><br>Who wouldn't?
