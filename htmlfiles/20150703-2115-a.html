[ Joukamachi no Dandelion is airing soon. The everyday lives of the nine super-powered siblings of the royal family are monitored by more than 200 surveillance cameras and broadcast nationwide. The people of the nation who are watching the broadcast will have the ability to elect the next monarch. Akane is the third-oldest sister who can manipulate gravity. She is shy and desperately does not want to be caught on camera.  Seems that maybe me and OP will watch the stream since anyone being silent about this show.<br><br>Oh well.</br></br>  <br>Was watching the Laplace stream, besides there's still an hour to go and that sabage show in 30.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was pretty excited for this show, I'm sort of confused as to why nobody else is. Unless &gt;Laplace. <br><br>Also, is it just me or is CC down?</br></br></br>   HanaKana as the lead <br>Oh well, I did watch and enjoy Saekano despite Matsuoka.<br><br>I'm good to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I checked the archive and found that CC is dead. RIP</br>  Akane is the cutest, Scarlet Bloom too<br><br><br>CC has been dead for a while unless he came back without me noticing. Neetball is the new. <br><br>As to why people aren't interested, no idea honestly. It's a kirara series so I expected a few more maybe, though it only has something like 3 chapters translated so maybe that's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shuu and Satou are best OTP. Kanade's a cutie too.  <br>Maybe because subs are not ready for new season</br>  <br>Shouldn't stop people usually, there's plenty of things being discussed that still only have funi for subs.<br><br>Some group might pick it up after it's aired too. No idea who though.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi hasn't even released any of their new simulcasts this season.</br>  Don't worry anon, I'm in for this  <br>And stuff is still being talked about? There's plenty of people on /a/ who watch the livestreams. I'm watching it right now.</br>  Manga is finally scanlated. First 3 chapters are out since yesterday  <br> I'm watching it right now. <br>I thought it didn't start until like 20 more minutes</br></br>  So wait which stream should I be watching? Sorry I haven't watched a livestream for a while so no idea where I should be looking.  <br><br>People can't really talk much about the shows without subs, don't you notice how /a/ is slow as fuck, new season /a/ is usually fast</br></br>  <br>Who picked it up?</br>  <br>Some survival game show is on, it's alright. This is on after.<br><br><br>People still talk about the source and just random shit. This is strangely slower than a lot of other stuff. Faster than some things though.<br><br><br>Neetball</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see channel offline at Neetball is that right? Or do I have to sign up or something.</br>  <br> Neetball <br>I've been on neetball for like an hour now and it still says channel is offline.<br><br>Is this just a problem on my end?</br></br></br></br>   can't into Nip <br>Guess I'll wait for subs.<br> Funi <br>Kill me.</br></br></br>  <br>Discusting!</br>  <br><br>Connectcast is messed up or something, follow the vaughnlive link below</br></br>  Here we go.  The dad doesn't seem to gigantic.  starting<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  Ah, this colorful art is so refreshing.      <br>Good start<br><br><br>Yeah he seems to have been scaled down a little.</br></br></br></br>  kanade best girl  Oh an advert for Urara Meirochou, interesting.    CGI Cameras, oh baby    Tail Red S2        I would vote for her   Hayamin as background character           seven thousand incest doujin<br><br>or none at all</br></br>  <br>Manage to get a screen of all the posters?</br>  <br><br><br>These images are hi-res. What are you streaming from? It can't be netball, that's like 240p.</br></br></br>      Didn't expect so much QUALITY during the 1st fucking episode.   IMS <br>How long until this show completely falls apart?</br>    GOD HAND  <br>Not really a background character, she got a name and even appears in OP</br>    Is this yuri?      <br>Gay as fuck</br>    Smooth Haruka, smooth <br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br>  JAPANESE TRUCK TAKES MANY DIFFERENT FORMS    <br>Yay!</br>  I vote for Shu.  Why doesn't Akane just wear pants?    <br>Pants aren't kawaii</br>    Man, this show looks retarded already.  why is misaki such a slut?    <br>Has to appeal in some way because she's got nothing else. All her clones are excellent in specific ways and she's just average in every way.</br>  That was actually better than the manga    <br>She can split herself into a load of copies<br>Imagine the possibilities</br></br>  <br>The girls are cute, which is enough for me. But the QUALITY and plot is retarded, I agree</br>    Is the monarchy and power gimmick really needed. It feels like this could stand on its own if it was just a SoL.  end card  <br>Yeah it did a good job of introducing the powers. You don't learn some of them in the manga for a while if I'm remembering right. Next episode is Satou, excellent.<br><br>End illustration by Harikamo too, guess kirara might be trying to push their manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If it wasn't the for the King competition and their superpowers what would the story be? Just a slice of life about a huge family?</br>    <br> QUALITY <br>Looked fine to me honestly, unless you're that autistic over CG cameras.</br></br>  <br>such lewd body</br>  <br>What's the problem with that? It's not like we've had a fuckhuge family SoL before.<br><br>Though don't get me wrong, I don't really mind it that much. I just personally would have preferred if it didn't have it is all. Still good fun.</br></br></br>  I feel like the monarchy is unneeded, that as a large family with powers it would work. The monarchy is retarded. They have all this money, yet come home to a small home instead of a mansion, and have family dinners where the mom cooks. Its like masturbation material for the "average Japanese family", as if that's the best way to live.  <br>Akane is my favourite, but oh god Misaki is so hot<br><br><br>Camera's looked fine honestly, they even blended in fairly well which is strange for CGI. Drones looked a bit dodgy when she first created them. Not something that ruins the episode though.</br></br></br></br>   AOTS   OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3ue<br>ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3x0</wbr></br></wbr>  this is probably shit but I love the character designs. How are they so good?  <br>Same guy who did twintails. <br>I don't think it's that shit, but I did import the manga a while back so I'm a little biased maybe.</br></br>  Is somebody saving us from Funi?  <br>Why the fuck do would you need all that space anyway? And family dinners are GOAT fuck you.</br>  <br>No one. Not yet, anyway.</br>  <br>Could be using all the money on the economy</br>   [Ohys-Raws] Joukamachi no Dandelion - 01 (TBS 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4 <br>Raw</br>  <br>Hopefully someone, there's a lot of groups who don't seem to be doing stuff yet so maybe one will pick it up. Was surprised to see Underwater pick up Gangsta.</br>  <br>Great. An exploitable.</br>    <br>Is that the show from this season? Okusama ga Seitokaicho?</br>  *teleports behind you*  So who has the best superpower?  <br>yes</br>  <br>Akane or Aoi. Akane could just crush people, Aoi could tell them to do anything. <br><br>Misaki for sex<br><br><br>I must have tabbed out when this happened, or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Here is the template (v2 with no white spots - sorry) with added pixels to make the image look more like its on the screen. Just put whatever you want on a layer below the template.<br><br><br>Misaki</br></br></br>  So its Mikagura Gakuen of the season?   dat shit eating shota <br>And the series was dead for me.</br>  Oh fuck I missed it, how the animation? Did they do some yuri?  <br>Less fighting and less obnoxious characters.</br>  <br>There's some QUALITY, but its IMS, so that's to be expected. I don't remember if there's any Yuri. There is, , however. The girls are all cute.</br>  <br>Is that some shota?</br>  <br>The little one is Shiori</br>  <br> Didn't expect so much QUALITY during the 1st fucking episode. <br><br>It's Production IMS, it's inevitable.</br></br></br>      Picked up    <br>It doesn't need superpowers. Just make it about the competition.</br>  <br>The whole story later on is the family getting votes by using their powers.  Akane becomes Scarlet Bloom, Hikari an idol, etc. </br>    <br>It was only a matter of time</br>  Man, it's been so long since I read the manga. I wish there were more.  That was fun, now to wait for subs. <br><br>Akane being perflat is a glorious thing. As is the fact that all of Misaki's clones have a different hairstyle.</br></br>      Are they all real siblings?  <br>The dad get around much, Aoi is the only real daughter with the queen</br>  <br>Yay, i was going to ask somebody make a yuri vertion of this</br>   Pls no ban.   <br>Are you keeping up with chapters or just volumes? I haven't read past the last chapter of vol2. Should have the third coming out soonish.<br><br><br>I want to be those covers</br></br></br></br>      subs when?  Red girl is a miracle of the universe!  <br>Only the 2 volumes, don't know of any individual chapter scans.</br>  Subs when?  Let me guess. There not actually related. Why can't Japan make something that's more tangible once in a while and stop with these cultural cliches?  <br>Your guess is wrong.<br>The mother literally spew out new babies every year</br></br>  <br><br>It's probably gonna be a couple of days late, Funi is doing it.</br></br>   Spanish  subs are out.  <br>50 millions of "americans" are happy</br>  <br>that's some fukin rare pepe</br>  If Akane can manipulate gravity, then those flying knees are a lot more dangerous than they look like.<br><br> waiting for all those incest doujinshi </br></br>  <br>Why does she fly with a skirt?</br>  <br>Why doesn't she just wear spats or shorts under her skirt?</br>  <br>Me neither, shame.<br><br>Please appear soon, Scarlet Bloom</br></br></br>  <br>Really?</br>   Hikari can age herself up <br> magical loli that can suddenly become a teenager or a christmas cake <br>I didn't even know I wanted this</br></br>  <br>Who is that?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> Akane <br>It shows her again right after</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Is Scarlet Bloom just Akane with glasses?</br>  <br>Akane but chuuni</br>  This was great. <br>Can't wait for next season</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>fuck, I meant next episode</br>  <br>What did you like about this first episode? Anything in particular?</br>  <br>Oh god that's even better.  I probably should have caught that earlier as chuuni HanaKana was mentioned in this thread. </br>  S-subs where?  <br>They had practice with the author's style through the Twintails anime. The shots they have of Akane are much lewder here than they were in the manga.</br>  <br>Heh, I don't have problem with monarchy and superpowers in this anime. If you want to watch anime with family, just watch something like Sazae-san, Chibi Maruko-chan, Shinchan, Atashinchi, or Kyouran Kazoku Nikki.</br>  <br>Don't just assume things out of your ass, idiot.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Highschool Spanish, don't fail me now!</br>  <br> not vaguely understanding Japanese, learned through associating sounds with words, enough in order to have a basic understanding of what's going on the scene, then using visuals to further your understanding </br>  <br>http://animeflv.net/ver/joukamachi-<wbr>no-dandelion-1.html<br><br><br> not speaking spanish, english and vaguely understanding japanese </br></br></br></wbr></br>  I'm shocked this hasn't been done earlier.  <br> not learning 6 different languages in order to consume Japanese media at the soonest moment. (Those languages being Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Japanese, French and Russian) </br>  <br>b-but you only need japanese then<br> korean, french, russian <br>Do they have a big sub community?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but sometimes they get raws and translations faster than our communities. Russians love to put stuff online illegally, also.</br>  <br>I'm quite upset that I didn't even think of it.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they would. Spent a year abroad in Korea and one of my roommates was a korean weaboo. Watched his shows same week they aired and the officially translated LN business there was exploding with series. I think they get their books like a month or two after the release of the original in japan.</br>  Best girl coming next week.  <br>Why was I under the impression that her hair was pink all this time?</br>  <br>Same here. That said, why does this anime studio always fuck with the source material?</br>  Is this incest?  <br>Are you incest?</br>  When will HS come out? Or Do we have to wait for some groups pick it up?  subs wheeeeeeeeeeeeeere  <br><br>Thank Funi for this.</br></br>  I'm not a raw watcher but how yuri is this? I know there's a guy but he doesn't seem relevant from the promo so I have high hopes since the girls are 2qt and iirc this is published in Kirara.  <br>hardly yuri except some cute sister bondings</br>  <br>Wrong, she wants to fuck her brother.  Also fuck off spicshit. </br>  <br>Think we will see that animated?</br>  <br>There's no yuri but lots of incest.</br>  If Haruka can calculate the chance of anything, wouldn't he already know who will be king?  <br> inb4 the TWEEST is that he was final boss all along </br>  So the shota wants to fuck the loli, there's some pinkhaired twincest and the MC has a thing for her brother too?  Picked the fuck up   Did Haruka calculate the chance of grabbing Akane's ass?   not expecting incest in a royalty  <br><br>Royalty are notoriously known for inbreeding so this shit isn't a big deal anyway.</br></br>  <br>why doesn't she wear spats</br>  <br>Only sluts wear spats.</br>  <br>sluts don't wear (no) panties?</br>  How come the teleportation dude is the least popular? What did he do?  <br>Make muh dick bigger</br>  <br>Calculations depends on present state of affairs. You'll see some fun keikakuing around it during his focus episode.</br>  <br>He doesn't care.<br><br> As long his waifu votes for him. </br></br></br>  bump if I can  Did Shuu always have a fucked up leg? Never noticed it in the manga. I wonder if it'll pop up in volume 3, or maybe it ties in with what Kanade seems to be indebted to him for.  Subs when?  <br>The anime stuff they've done so far is a better opener than the manga is. So long as they don't meddle later on now that introductions are done it should be alright.<br><br><br> If I say we should work together I have 100% chance to grab her ass <br> 計画通り </br></br></br></br></br>  1.

Color me impressed.</br>  oh cool, they paired up the two worst girls from each series.  <br>you're funny guy</br>   No Arakawa <br> No SZS <br> &gt;No Kagerou </br></br>  <br>I bet this is a false-flag by Kevin-kun</br>   Homura not together with Hitagi <br> Mayoi isn't in the same picture with kyubey <br>bravo shaft<br>r<br>a<br>v<br>o<br><br>s<br>h<br>a<br>f<br>t</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well, they needed an excuse to effectively give Shinobu an entire section and still pretend they're not playing favorites, so they had to mix up Homura and Hitagi as well.  FINALLY.<br><br>KIZU REREVEAL.<br><br>I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN ON THE SAME YEAR AS THE LAST GUARDIAN REREVEAL.</br></br></br></br>  <br> KIZU REREVEAL <br>When, where, how, why?</br></br>  Holy shit, why can't I stop grinning like a kid while watching this? It revived my desire for adventure and the world and setting seem so interesting. Seriously, if the manga is anywhere near as fun as this I'll definitely pick it up.  <br> ^^ <br>Typical fujoshit doesn't understand what it takes for a manga to have good art.</br></br>  <br>It sells even with the ridiculous hiatuses added on top of that.</br>  <br> ridiculous hiatuses <br>The wait is half the fun.</br></br>  <br>That's what we have learned to tell ourselves.</br>  That's me too OP, It's like getting up super early to watch Yu gi oh or Pokemon, It's just such a refreshing show to watch that you know will have patience build up and everything because its 148 episodes.<br><br>I'm a fool for not picking it up when it aired, You could have told me /a/..</br></br>  In the SBR universe Joseph sent a T-rex Kars into space and we'll never see it.  why live? <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br>    Post yfw David animates the Rohan Spin-offs as Part 4 specials.  You'll cowards are doing your part, right?  <br>That would be really nice but idk if they'd do it. I feel like it would be something they'd do during/after part 7 since the style isn't the same as part 4 and is way more serious.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for part 5 and 7. And probably part 4, I still don't make up my mind.</br>  <br>I never expect a hot girl</br>  i got you fam  <br>meant for </br>  Why are you guys mad that they are taking advantage of the recent anime? ASB did the same thing. It would be retarded not to do so. It's not like the game is only the first three parts, if that were the case I could definitely see the frustration.  <br> tfw we will never get to see kira joestar's predeath and Joseph 2.0 adventures </br>  Gyro a shit. He is one of my least liked characters in SBR.<br><br>Caesar &gt; Gyro</br></br>  <br> implying we won't get flashback chapters after Gappy regains his memory </br>  Will Gappy get a partner in EoH?  When will the 「Vampire Dicksucking」 end?  <br>We're nearly half way through part 8, what makes you think that, retard? Also what  said<br><br><br>I think you just have EXTREMELY shit taste, anon.</br></br></br></br>     Josefumi Kujo   <br>Yasuho, hopefully. Maybe with part 4 Josuke or even Kira.</br>   people hate Last Train Home   <br>There's only one person he could team up with.<br> Joushuu </br></br>  Objectively the best theme out there<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=u0Z<wbr>NsycW__k</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Was about to say this, most part 8 ally stands can't even attack. We've barely seen Joshuu's stand either so it would be hard to come up with a good moveset for him.</br>  <br> Caesar <br>Literally yamcha. Lost every battle he had with pillarmen and drawed with Joseph without any training and messina who's only trick is making a glass of water into jello<br><br> Gyro <br>Fucking carried the entire steel ball run race, had an amazing personality, and was the only person in the race who wasn't doing it for selfish reasons. <br><br>Defeats Avdol, pocoloco, stroheim, mrs robinson, ringo roadagain, elven men, Disco, Wekapipo/Magenta, and almost 1 shot the president. All while holding 2-5th place in most stages of the race and teaching Johnny how to walk and spin.<br><br>Fucking Gyro put in more work than anyone in the entire series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Caesar <br> Literally yamcha. Lost every battle he had with pillarmen and drawed with Joseph without any training and messina who's only trick is making a glass of water into jello <br>And he was then flattened<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VsJ<wbr>eQWZqCpU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why you no expect a HOT PANTS? She is a hot girl</br>  <br>Seriously though, Gyro was a better protagonist than Johnny. And don't even give me that "muh JoJo" shit because SBR wasn't meant to be a JoJo part to begin with until the editors and fans pestered Araki to make it one.</br>  <br>Is EoH still single player?</br>   Be me. <br> Be watching Battle In Egypy arc. <br> Ep 22, 22:15. <br> Dio goes to stop time. <br> "THE WURLDO!!" <br> Mfw video stops playing. </br></br></br></br></br>  Lisa Lisa and Pet Shop in Eyes of Heaven  <br>Gyro and Johnny were both pretty great characters, I always considered them co-protagonists.</br>  Is it possible that Magenta is still alive in part 8?  <br>they were equals I think. Gyro the teacher and Johnny his student. <br><br>And really it was always meant to be a Jojo part, no matter what others say. Araki said he would continue JJBA at the end of part 6.</br></br></br>  <br>m-mommy</br>  <br>It flashed the death title card on him which Araki seems to be proud of keeping true.</br>  what's the name of d'arby the gamer's theme?  <br>Maybe? It is said that he stopped thinking like Cars, but it could be that he was found later on.</br>  <br> Gambler.mp3 </br>  Over Heaven is weird and not canon but entirely plausible  New episode of Urojojo is up <br> http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26<wbr>384104</wbr> </br>  <br><br>I ask because I am not sure of 20CB limits, does it stop him from aging too? Sounds plausible since he doesn't even need to breath to stay alive.</br></br>  Y U K A K O<br>U<br>K<br>A<br>K<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  Giorno is a great Jojo. He scores dead last on almost everyone's MC ranking. But no more! I got his back. By the end of the year, he'll be in everybody's top 3.  How is it the special Joestar secret technique if only Joseph and Jotaro used it?  <br>these images don't really work unless you give it a filename</br>  <br>Tippity-top teir yandere</br>  <br>It wouldn't be special if everyone in the family used it, now would it?</br>   Goodbye Nostalgia <br><br>I don't even know what he's saying and I'm sad.</br></br>  Let's not talk about Kira today. He's a fucking retard and we should just let it go.  <br><br>My local Travelling Man has a 3 for 2 deal for all manga published by Viz, so yeah. I felt like a total moron when I asked for part 3 though and the girl just looked at me like I'm a retard and said "its not out yet".</br></br>  What would Jonathan said to his descendants?  <br>Jolyne and Josuke also used it, are you a fucking idiot animefag?</br>  <br>He'd be proud of them, even if they are a bit... Weird. Jonathan used to dress like a fag too, remember?<br>I think he would be specially proud of  Giorno <br>Maybe he would be a little weirded out by Jolyne</br></br></br>  <br> We've barely seen Joshuu's stand either so it would be hard to come up with a good moveset for him. <br><br>You could've said the same about Josuke before ASB came out yet they did it.</br></br></br>  <br>He speaks to them daily through their courage and passion.</br>  <br> SONO CHI NO SADAME </br>  <br>20th Century Boy makes Magenta invincible, not inmortal, even if it did prevent him from drowning on the river, his "stopped thinking" pretty much means he died</br>  <br> Joseph <br>You're a cunning one, I like you<br> Jotaro <br>You're my true heir, although too aggressive<br> Josuke <br>Get a job and you'll be the perfect Joestar<br> Jolyne <br>Have some decency you slut<br> Johnny <br>Have some decency you slut</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jonathan would never insult anyone. He'd just tell Jolyne and Johnny to do what makes them happy.</br>  <br><br>When Japanese Patrick Bateman dicksucking begins.</br></br>  <br> Johnny <br> descendant </br></br>  <br> the dolphinfucker <br> a true heir </br></br>  <br> Joseph <br>Too rude but would be sorry for not being present.<br> Jotaro <br>WAY too rude and would teach him some manners but would still be happy that he stopped Dio.<br> Josuke <br>Would buy him lots of expensive stuff (just like he would to any descendant) and be mostly happy with him but wouldn't like how hotheaded he can be.<br> Giorno <br>Would love like a son, even if he is mostly Dio's. I think they would get along pretty well and he would tell stories about his school days with Dio.<br> Jolyne <br>Too rude but he would understand that her behavior is mostly Jotaro's fault. Would teach her how to be a proper lady.<br><br> Johnny <br>They would trade stories about their Dannies and Zeppelis and Johnny would teach him how to ride horses.<br> Josuke <br>He would do his best to help him find about his past and take a family photo with him and all the others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if grandpa Jonathan had to raise the Joestars?<br> Joseph, stop ruising Speedwagon <br> Jotaro, stop calling your mother a bitch <br> Josuke   get a haircut <br> Giorno stop hanging out with those kids <br> Jolyne put on some clothes </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of them save Joseph being half-breed with inferior non-English blood. Joseph himself having bred with a Nips. He would disavow them all.</br>  <br>Everything in the bloodline goes to shit after   Joseph </br>  Does anyone here have this in color?<br>Please.</br>  <br>Now that you mention, I think he would be REALLY mad at Joseph for fucking someone other than his wife</br>  Could Dio beat John Cena?  <br>What would Dio said to his descendants ?</br>  <br>We know from the PS3 game that he likes Giorno.<br>The others are just a bunch of faggots.</br></br>  Finally about to watch the SC anime. I can't wait to see how David does this final fight. I know animation wise it may not top the OVA but I am still expecting big things.<br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/6dce374<wbr>e8bad9aab31cd6995008f0691.webm</wbr></br>  <br>Nothing because he didn't give a shit.</br>  <br><br>I don't think he would say anything nasty about them. He didn't say anything nasty about Speedwagon and he was a street thug. Even in ASB when he triggers Josuke's heart attack, he doesn't insult his hair, he says "I woonder if I can hit his hair with my ripple?"<br><br>He would just accept them for who they were.</br></br></br></br>  How do you think David handled the Jotoro vs. Dio fight compared to the 1993 OVA?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_CN<wbr>rNQjWGHI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Joseph <br>You are even more cunning than Mr. Zepelli...<br> Jotaro <br>A man shouldn't insult his mother.<br> Josuke  <br>Your hair is...is...."Great"(?)! (Slightly embarassed but still loving)<br> Giorno <br>Your dream truly is just. You would make a good gentleman<br> Jolyne <br>We all appreciate it very much. And I know that so did your father.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   yfw David retcon Part 4 and this beautiful man (who did literally nothing wrong. not one single thing) wins the Crusaderbowl, becoming the next MC   <br>EL MUNDO</br>  <br>I never wanted this feel.png</br>  <br>O MUNDO</br>  <br>I flat out don't understand how people don't see Johnny as the protagonist.<br>He literally narrates that it's his story, he got the most character development, he was in just as many fights,  he doesn't fucking die .</br></br>   be Kakyoin, an intelligent and sensitive student <br> have a talent for art that nobody cares about <br> have no friends <br> Chads like Jotaro get all the attention <br> suddenly, for the sake of saving an innocent woman and surpass your fears, you go on a journey that could be mortal <br> sacrifice you life for victory to let the normies go back to their quiet lives <br> still regret nothing <br>Kakyoin is a saint.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can The Sun defeat DIO?<br><br>Even though it's the stand beaten the easiest, it's also the one that can beat DIO the easiest, isn't it? I mean, even if it's night, it can create a sun that would fry DIO instantly. How come the user of The Sun end up being DIO's bitch?</br></br>  <br> wins the Crusaderbowl. <br>Does that mean he fucked them all?</br></br>   It's Thursday   <br>How many times is this gonna be posted</br>    Jonathan Joestar is best Joestar  <br><br>  Phantom Blood is best Bizarre Adventure </br></br>  <br>prbably cus the user was lazy and probs didnt eve know dio was a vampire, just some creepy charasmatic dude who looked unfuckable. we also donbt know how long it takes for sunman to take out his stand, so if dio sensed danger, he might be able to kill him wquickly. 1hand typing sorry</br>  You now remember Avdol.  <br>Don't we have video game where this happens?</br>  <br>Lots of QUALITY, but otherwise pretty good.</br>  Last episode was faithful and yet was a gigantic turd. How did David turn some of the most exciting chapters into such a dull borefest is beyond me. Even Dio sucks. I guess the budget is no more and the staff is on its deathbed.  So were the Part 1 and 2 dubs shown already? Or is that tomorrow? Can't find info on that anywhere.  <br> Dio actually appears in part 5 <br> saves his son from Diavolo <br> Dio vs Diavolo <br> The World vs the Crimson King </br></br></br></br>  <br> Why you no <br>Go back to reddit</br></br>  <br>Well, in ASB he likes Giorno.<br>Don't know how he would react to his less well-adjusted bastards. <br> Why the fuck are you dressed like a bloody cow, stop crying! <br> Hideous! How did my blood, Dio's blood create such an ugly child? <br> You, I like. You and Giorno. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Last episode was faithful and yet was a gigantic turd. <br><br>It was brilliant, I don't know where these diverse opinions are coming from. The most I've enjoyed an episode of the whole of Part 3. Are you just another fucker from /v/ comparing it to the OVA?</br></br></br>  <br> Are you just another fucker from /v/ comparing it to the OVA? <br>Please don't compare it to the OVA, it's like putting dog shit next to caviar.</br></br>  <br>Both horrible?</br>  <br> he genuinely prefers the OVA <br><br>I was going to say go back to /v/, but fuck it, please stay. You are an endless source of entertainment.</br></br></br>  Am I the only one who likes both the anime and the OVA?    <br>Yes, the only one in ZA entire WARUDO</br>  I hope mods give us a sticky to discuss the next episode<br><br>They gave one to fucking kill la kill.</br></br>  <br>heaven confirmed</br>  Who is maining Mariah?   Leave Jotaro to me   <br> the /v/ boogeyman </br>  <br>Tomorrow. I doubt we'll be able to see anything from the panel, though.</br>  I was just rewatching some episodes and I like how DP adds some retroactive details like the birthmark on Joseph.  <br>I, DIO, love the crispy delicious chicken flavor of KFC. They're WWRRYYYYYYYLY DIOLICOUS</br>  <br> Rikiel <br>Weakened throughout his own life by his own power. He could be strong if given guidance, and his ability could be very powerful if used well. High potential.<br><br> Ungalo <br>He would blame Ungalo's mother for making him a weak man prone to addiction, as DIO has never suffered from substance abuse issues. Bohemian Rhapsody would be another cause for disappointment: rather than facing reality, it lets his failure of a son summon fantasies to fight for him.<br><br> Donatello <br>Little bastard who digs up memories of the past because he's too focused on his lack of a father, and ends up in terrible situations because he's too passive. A true man uses relics of the past to carve out a new future.<br><br> Giorno <br>The most potential, with the greatest drive and the most flexible abilities, but he takes after Jonathan a bit too much and squanders his power. Only becoming the boss of Passione is a bid disappointing, but worthy of Dio's heritage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Stands of time  GUYS<br>GUYS<br><br>WHAT IF AT THE FINAL BATTLE<br><br> YASUHO DIES </br></br></br></br></br>   post yfw part 4 mentions or refrences duwang   Post yfw the part 8 antagonist has a stand named after  Gorillaz.   <br> Dirty Harry </br>  can someone explain to me how the fuck did this little faggot got ripped all of sudden? <br>i thought he was some fat dumbfuck with title and retarded ambition</br>  <br>d4c</br>    <br>USA</br>  <br> 「Feel Good Inc.」 <br> 「19-2000」 <br> 「Dirty Harry」 <br> 「On Melancholy Hill」 <br><br>All would be rather good stand names.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Araki decided Valentine was going to be a boss, and as such had to get swole for the role.</br>  <br>Even though Giorno was the most violent, he was oddly the one that was most like Jonathan.<br>He was a pure hybrid between Jonathan and Dio. Relentless and violent like Dio, but caring and good hearted like Jonathan.<br><br>Like fathers like son.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He swapped part with buff Valentine. There's probably some small variance in the parallel realities, after all.<br>Or alternatively corpse did it.</br></br>  <br> Not including Giorno, his fucking son <br> Including Johny, his other universe counterpart </br></br>  <br>You can partner anyone with anybody.</br>  <br>Yeah, I got them. I picked up the Viz Part 3 Vol 1, but I probably should've waited for the Jojonium of that. I really love the original volume cover art, so I might get the whole set of them.</br>  <br> Jonathan technically cheated on Erina when DIO used his body </br>   plays video games all day long <br> free food, housing and protection for working as a butler in a mansion <br> work consists of welcoming guests (which is never) and maintaining the mansion <br> get to live with this cool vampire who's over 100 years old and can stop the fucking time <br> get to know really interesting people, one of them is like a gay terminator  <br>d'arby is living the dream</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he does? I mean, not IN his Part, but he does.</br>  <br>Erina deserved it. Didn't she save Dio?</br>  <br>I mean we still got the SC test dubs and that was a private showing as far as I know. There's a good chance someone will get their hands on them.</br>  <br>But Soft &amp; Wet did SOMETHING. It already had the powers up to Fun Fun Fun. Nut King Call has shown up in one scene.</br>  <br>Those got streamed on Crunchyroll though, no word on these ones gettinf streamed.</br>  jojo is gay  <br>We don't know if The Sun uses the same kind of light as the actual Sun. It could just make stuff really hot, which has been shown not to be a problem for DIO. DIO just petted Arabia Fats' head like N'Doul and he fell for him.</br>  <br> work consists of welcoming guests (which is never) and maintaining the mansion <br>I'm sure he's had to pamper Dio's women before dinner.</br></br>  <br>i can see it happenin.<br>also i cant wait for a yasuho 1v1 fight</br></br>  <br>Well, so do all the other JoJos by that metric.</br>  <br>Makes me wonder how Giorno, and his brothers mothers fucking survived a Dio dicking, seeing as how he eats the women or kills them afterwards.</br>  <br>i'd imagine that d'arby would be really autistic around women, his gentlemen demeanor would just come off as creepy and insincere</br>  <br>But Kira skips and Mandom rewinds.</br>  <br>So, he's /r9k/?</br>  <br>In Over Heaven, which may or may not be canon. It had an All-Star Battle outfit, so maybe.</br>  <br>no, not that pathetic, just off putting, all the blood sluts probably saw him as "the video game weirdo", i bet ice was really popular among them, not that ice would care about such lowly scum</br>  I'm glad they didn't kill Polnareff off!  <br>no your jojo</br>  <br>Are there translations for that?</br>  <br>Yeah, it's translated. Should be in the pastebin. The Purple Haze novel had some sort of thing in All-Star Battle. That's also translated. Anyone know how good the novels are?</br>  Someone has a good quality pic of Enigma from the manga (not colored)?  <br>Me too! Death is the worst thing that could happen to a character!</br>  <br>Kira loops</br>  <br>Yes?</br>  <br>nice meme friend, although i think it belongs here<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br>  <br>Could you post it?</br>  <br>He certainly could.</br>  <br>I got Vol 1. Will get Vol 2 next month.</br>  Can someone post more pepe with Jojo version?  <br>But will he do it?</br>  <br>I always thought the corpse parts made him like that.</br>  <br>1</br>  <br>Doc has an entire JoJo pepe folder he updates regularly <br>http://imgur.com/a/sxh6d</br></br>  <br>What's even the point of this, what's so Pepe about DIO?</br>  <br>2, If you want better one's i can search for them</br>  <br>Nice, thanks a lot anon.</br>  <br>No, but Jonathan could.</br>  <br>Even better.</br>  <br> Patrician taste </br>  Josefumi looks handsome with those Crazy Diamond Eyes.      <br>i hope he only did that shading incorrectly because it really looks like the lower part of his brows stick out like it's a tumor.<br><br>maybe i am just retarded.and cant see past that.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sVE<wbr>GMax42dw</wbr>  [ ]<br>i love this theme, it's so creepy and yet upbeat, like "everything's coming up to kira", you can really hear kira's confidence after gaining BTD in the theme</br>    It just hit me why DIO doesn't use any of the advanced vampire techniques from Phantom Blood.  He's not not using his body.   <br>They likely fell in love with him and he decided to keep them alive. AFTER impregnating them, of course.</br>  <br> space ripper stingy eyes are located on his body </br>  <br>He said that he got vampire powers from having total control over his body (stopping blood flow to control body temp, shooting his essence out of his eyes) He didn't have complete control over Jonathan's body. I'm pretty sure he did when he got Joseph's blood, or maybe he would have once he got Jotaro's.</br>  <br>He only uses those in HftF, and it's clearly still his head, since he used it while decapitated.</br>  <br>it makes sense that he can't do his frozen arm thing without being in conntrol of jonathon's body, but he was able to use space ripper stingy eyes as just a severed head</br>  <br>The only bullshit assumption I can make is that somehow being attached to Jonathan's body prevents him from doing that.</br>  Which JoJo is closest to Derek Zoolander?  Who bit who? <br>Was Josefumi biting Kira or Kira biting Josefumi?<br>Was Kira also a vampire?<br>How did they both get buried?<br>Were they fighting when the earthquake happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Johnny would teach him how to ride horses. <br> Implying a British aristocrat from the 1880s wouldn't know how to ride <br><br>How else to stare disdainfully down at the peasants from a proper height</br></br></br></br>  <br>they were having rough sex in the woods when suddenly a sinkhole swallowed them</br>   Pucci is unaffected by the time acceleration <br> Pucci waited millions of years just so he would finish off Emporio and complete DIO's goal. <br>I don't know if I should be impressed or disturbed.</br></br>  <br>Then who bit Joshuu?</br>  <br>volume 3 was preordered for me as a gift, will get the battle tendency volumes, and I hope that they release the jojoniums for part 3 in the west (I love the orange bichrome look)</br>  Someone dun goofed and updated their IMDB early.<br><br>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1240448/<wbr><br><br><br>The panel is tomorrow right?</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>His perception of time itself could be affected so it didn't feel like billions of years to him.</br>  <br> Petshop <br>Oh boy here we go</br></br>  <br>did they mention that he can alter his time perception?</br>  <br>I thought Jonathan was already announced? <br><br>On the dub note, does anyone need 1080p versions of the 3 test dub episodes?</br></br></br>  <br>Jonathan isn't some strict conservative faggot, he's just pure-hearted and gentlemanly by nature.</br>  <br>He waited over 20 years just to get Jotaro's disc. Pucci is dedicated as fuck.</br>  What kind of monster rancher monsters would Pucci's disks make?  <br>if you have them i'd love 'em</br>  <br>It has to be a required secondary power. No one, not even Kars, can wait billions of years while the rest of life itself slows to a standstill without retaining his sanity at the end.</br>  <br> DIO has never suffered from substance abuse issues <br><br>This is a blatant lie, he takes after his alcoholic father. In part 1 before the dracula-ning he specifically says "dammit I can't stop drinking"</br></br></br>  I made Joseph Joestar's baby food from the Death 13 yesterday. Wasn't bad.  No, I didn't add poop. That shit's gross.   <br>Wonder what alcohol does to vampires.</br>  <br>The only one that was officially announce was Joseph - Paul Diskin<br><br>There was a rumor going around that it was going to be JYB but that was never confirmed. In hindsight, it was just a screenshot of the convention announcement page. Pretty good troll. Solid 9/10 considering how wide spread it was.</br></br></br>  Anyone have the pic of high DIO scratching his head  <br>how'd you do it?</br>  <br>*ben diskin</br>  <br>He was probably praising it the whole time while waiting.</br>  <br>A albino naga</br>  where's Dio?    <br>where should i upload them?</br>  <br>Well, it's a depressant I believe, so that. Depending on the specific mechanics of the metabolism of the vampires in question, it might have less of an effect.</br>  <br>mega</br>  <br> Najimu!

Then they talk shit about everything that's in it because they don't ACTUALLY like it, they just bandwaggoned. First they don't like stands or "monster of the week", then they'll say SoL is bad, then they'll say it's too gay with Part 5, but they'll keep watching for some reason. I don't know if they'll like Part 6, but they'll definitely complain about the ending. Then they'll hate Part 7 for being something new. The worst part is that they don't stop watching. When they reach their next Part to complain about, they're praising the last as if they never complained about it. It never ends.</br>  <br>When I heard that they're not doing Part III I was a bit apprehensive but I'll pick 'em up to support muh Joey JoJos</br>  <br>Proof? I feel like you're making this shit up</br>  <br>Brianstorm</br>  <br>Are you into conspiracies by any chance?</br>  <br>Well they already have the normal part 3 release (partially censored) so if they said they were gonna do it eventually they'd esentially have to stop selling those since most would wait for the prrmium versions. So they'll deny it now, but once they're done with Part 2 they'll probably annouce it as a premium uncensored release. (They only censored some of the dog violence I think with Araki redrawn art, but stopped by Pet Shop.)</br>  <br>Use what?</br>  <br>Thanks.<br><br>It sucks that pomf and loveisover are down now.

Tumblrshits posted all the time when SC was starting. You see people complaining about "monster-of-the-week" or asking "What happened to Ripple?" all the time. Also saying stands are "like Pokemon" or some bullshit. Also some le totally epic comparisons between Jotaro and Mako's bancho outfit.</br></br>  What do you think Pucci was doing when Dio was about to be killed?   <br>I'm but a wave to..</br>  <br><br>what are the translations like in these? do they have the censorship like straizo instead of straights?<br>can you post a pic of a page?</br></br></br>  <br>『PAPARAZZI』<br>I feel like this one of those stands that fucks over the stand user.</br></br>  <br>I still think one of the best twists for part 8 or 9 would be Giorno existing exactly as he was in the previous universe with full knowledge of what occurred.<br><br>Though at the same time the SBR universe is apparently different from the Pucci reset so who the fuck knows</br></br></br>  <br>Price of hosting a file server is too much (I think he mentioned it costed about 600 a month). Loveisover went down because everyone from pomf switched over to it and they couldn't handle it either.</br>  <br>I've been in this general for months and haven't seen that shit posted as much.<br><br>I just think you're been full blown autistic about "muh seekret club being invaded"</br></br></br>  <br>We don't get to if they fucked with the names until volume three</br>  <br>They have Bruford as "Blueford". I don't know if they changed Tarkus. They only have up to Tarkus and Bruford first showing up, so we'll know if they use Straizo when it's out this August.</br>  How would Sex Pistols work if Mista didn't have a gun?<br><br>How would they attack another stand/person?</br></br>  <br>Why would they change Tarkus? They used the name in Dark Souls and no one objected.</br>  <br>They probably could use whatever projectile Mista wanted, really. It's just that they're optimized for a six-shooter.<br><br>For example, if Mista took up archery for whatever reason he could probably use Sex Pistols with the arrows, I'd think.<br><br>Sex Pistols is actually one of my favorite Stands I think, at least so far as I've read.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>which one is better, emperor or sex pistols, and why?</br>  <br>Being gay</br>  <br>Emperor cannot be seen by muggles, it only fails because Hol Horse kind of sucks. Why not just go all out and unload on those niggas? The gun is supposed to have no recoil and be pretty strong.</br>  <br> Cosmic Slop <br><br>I don't want to know what my stand looks like</br></br></br>  <br>Sex pistols, Emporor is a gun and a guided bullet with a set stand range of around 20 or so meters like most long range part 3 stands, but sex pistols is automatic and interacts with the world, mother fucker could use a heavy machine gun and they would kick and guide the bullets still</br>  <br><br>Thanks, didn't know</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=euX<wbr>QbZDwV0w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Pucci in an alternate universe?</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Emperor can cast more than one bullet at a time. Emperor's sole advantage is that the gun doesn't apply to physical rules and it's a stand itself.</br>  <br>This , plus I really like it when stands have personalities.<br><br>I realize it kind of defeats the purpose of having them be part of the user or whatever, and it would probably lead to a lot of cringe-inducing stuff if it were more common, but I still like it. I wish there were more shenanigans with Stands totally clowning on people (including their users).</br></br></br>  How old was Jolyne when she died and entered the prison?  <br> I'm a TTGL/KLK fag <br> I jumped onto JoJo since people were talking about how they were gonna start watching Part 3 after KLK ended <br> I'm all caught up on the manga and have a Crazy Diamond statue along with a King Crimson figure on the way. I've loved every part, even 5 with its bad translation. I love this series so goddamn much, not because its "le manly anime XD" but because everything about it is great. <br>I am probably still a huge faggot though.</br></br></br></br>  CONFUSION IS MY EPITAPH  How many animefags are going to be upset at  Sandman's or Wekapipo's deaths?   I think I have  the JoJo sameface <br>Should I be happy?</br>  <br>its never fired more then one so we can only guess, and it still has the stand range where sex pistols does not, emperor is also a manual revolver where sex pistols can work with any fire arm or ranged weapon, he could throw knives if he wanted</br>  <br>He did when he shot the pipes and shortly after himself.</br>  <br>Hol Horse shot like 10 bullets into the pipe.</br>  Thanks    <br>post proof</br>  <br> universe resets <br> giorno nor diavolo have stands <br> diavolo fucking wrings giorno's neck and eats the remains <br>if only</br></br></br></br>   Chocolate Disco <br>I didn't knew it was possible for a manga to have an actual filler fight.</br>    <br>I don't think you know what filler is.</br>    <br>I don't want to be called a faggot though</br>    <br>yeah but do it though</br>  <br>I don't know, it just seems really tacked on. Like, you could replace it with any other distraction and the plot wouldn't change. It isn't even a nod like Avdul or Stroheim, it's just some guy that comes out of nowhere and he's just like "this is my stand and that's all there's to it".</br>  <br>None, the anime will never get there.</br>  <br>When the stand is attached to someone/something it removes them/it from perception. Whatever is effected is still there in space but it just can not be perceived.<br><br>No harm can come to you in a space you have deemed The Danger Zone. The placement of The Danger Zone is permanent. You may only have one Danger Zone.<br><br> A stand that removes negativity.<br><br>A stand that makes people become hopelessly enamored by the user.<br><br>A stand that can make sound physical.<br><br>A stand that stalks a target and feeds the user constant updates.<br><br>When hit by the stand the target will start to have an experience similar to an acid trip. Subsequent hits amplify the effect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Trapped In The Drive-Thru <br>Welp, I'm an enemy stand user.</br></br>  <br> Elegia <br><br>Dunno, like Echoes?</br></br></br>  <br>Feather someone tell whatit's abilities are<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jfF<wbr>TT3iz740</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>i think of a song that, the longer you listen to it, the more it takes your life force</br>  <br> volume 3 was preordered for me as a gift <br>not quite the same but i just got volume 1 as a gift for my birthday<br><br>it truly is a bizarre world</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just for you <br/></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Who else?

It really did change everything.</br>  <br>who</br>  <br>A wandering stand that takes the form of a taxi and takes people for one hell of a ride.<br><br>A stand that acts as a personal elevator.</br></br></br>  <br>oh shit i definitely see it</br>  Where can I read a properly translated, properly scanned part 5? I got decently deep into it and then it went to shit, so I've just skipped to part 6 for now. Color would be incredible since I'm somehow bad at reading B&amp;W Manga but I can make do with decent B&amp;W scans.  <br>Listening to Mada Ugoku. I always knew it'd be a weeb song.</br>  <br>Just some asshole on youtube<br><br>I don't find him that bad, actually.</br></br></br>  I'm not the only one who feels like Jotaro went to shit, right?<br>He started out as absolutely ridiculous in Part III. Kicking ass, taking names. He was THE Protagonist.<br>I realize he stopped being the protagonist in Part IV, but he was still OKAY.<br>But from what I've read of Part VI, he just went to complete shit. He couldn't even stop bullets and White Snake just shit on him like it was nothing.</br></br></br>  Why does the SBR universe suck so much?  <br>Get yourself a neat hat or hairstyle and look for a person with the initials J.J. Either attempt to kill them or give your life for them.</br>  <br>Shouldn't Crazy Diamond be in there?</br>  <br>One you stop being the protagonist, and especially once you get out of Designated Competent Protagonist Age Zone you lose your privileges.<br><br>Ask poor Joseph.</br></br></br>  <br>I forgot he still did videos. I found a link of one of his Lootcrate videos and I almost died from how cancerous it was. What happened?</br>  Anyone have the Killer Queen "I AM THE FUCKING STRONG" pic?    <br>It has the least amount of pages per volume of JoJonium, but still a lot more than the original tankoban release obviously. Color pages are all tinted a single shade so they're pretty much useless. Only real reason to get it is the nice feel of the hardcover and the fact that you're supporting the series.</br>  <br>Thanks man</br>    <br>I'll also try to get buff, thank you.<br>I know a Jordan and a Jonathan, I hope that works.</br></br>  <br>all you are is cute</br>  <br><br>Applies to Joseph too</br></br>  Is it ever mentioned what would happen to a vampire who used the mask with the red stone?  <br>Not too buff I hope, that's a face clearly meant more for being a later Parts fuccboi than someone from Part 1 or 2</br>  <br>I think you mean faget</br>  <br>Aren't vampires basically what Kars and the others were?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>But that's fair seeing how he was affected by old age.<br>Also don't post Gohan, everyone knows Gohan was jobbed due to fan asshurt that he was stronger than Goku.<br><br>And at least Joseph is the oldest living Joestar ever, living into his 90's before not existing anymore, thanks to his grandsons grand fuckups.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably nothing. Vampires already got their brains fully perfored. But the masks alone were not enough to pierce the brains of the pillarmen which is why they needed the stone.</br>  <br> Young Joseph would somehow be able to stop Pucci </br>  <br> somehow <br> Implying he wouldn't just Bugs Bunny the shit out of him <br><br>Young Joseph would pull it off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They were ancient homosexual aztec superhuman Gods<br><br>Quick question<br>Would it have been so bad to let them become Ultimate? Kars didn't need food, even if he did they'd be a great way to lose criminals and shit.<br><br>They never said anything about killing all humans, ruling them, making the world theirs, just conquering the sun, becoming truly immortal, and killing anybody in their way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't doubt he can do it, I'm trying to think of a way he could trick Pucci</br>  <br>like<br><br>said, he would've tricked Pucci to death too</br></br></br>  <br>Then what would they do? What do homosexual aztec gods do for fun?</br>  <br>Magically put 50 grenades on him.<br>Pull out a tommy gun and fill him with holes<br>Use Puccis abilities against him. "Oh, you took my stand? Here's a clackerang!"</br></br></br>  <br>Kars could fly, turn his anything in to anything, an go out during the daytime.<br><br>They could enjoy the fucking world for once.</br></br></br>  <br> Fast forwards a recording of his own voice to trick Pucci into thinking Joseph can resist his stand <br> A trick that works similarly to what Jolyne did with the dolphin <br> Some shit with mirrors and very thin blades <br>I can see it</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I BROUGHT TEQUILA </br></br>  <br>Is it harcover?</br>  <br> Not existing anymore <br><br>Does he? SO's ending is really confusing, did everyone survive except for those killed by Pucci? Did everyone die? Is the universe were Pucci got rekt by emporio the ireneverse? Is Irene the same girl that's talking to Jotaro after the first reset?</br></br></br>  <br><br>to all of them: MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!!</br></br>  <br>Uses Hamon on DIO's bone</br>  <br>What pose for Josuke can be decribed as his defining?</br>  <br>What I've been told is that the people who died during the accelerated time ceased to exist, and were replaced with couterparts, EX: Irene<br><br>So I guess Joseph still exist.</br></br></br>  <br> did everyone survive except for those killed by Pucci? <br>Everyone died, but they kept their souls, the ones killed by Pucci didn't, Jolyne2 and Jotaro2 are just empty shells<br> Is the universe were Pucci got rekt by emporio the ireneverse? Is Irene the same girl that's talking to Jotaro after the first reset? <br>No, and no, after Emporio rekt Pucci, the universe reset happened again, killing Pucci's "heaven". Irene is more Jolyne than Jolyne2, the Joestar birthmark implies that, at least that's what I got from it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're talking about part 4 Josuke then this is the obvious choice.</br>  <br>could not agree more.</br>  <br>I'd say Emperor since you don't have to take care of the Stand, are not limited to just six bullets at a time, no reloading or recoil, and a good range of up to 50 meters away from the user.</br>  <br>Gotta give Gyro something to do.</br>  <br> have a talent for art that nobody cares about <br>You saw that drawing he did, don't bullshit.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't.

People will just get fed up.</br></br>  <br>Bikkibro is that you?</br>  <br>If you're looking for boobs, go watch Love-ru Darkness S2</br>  <br><br>Why not?<br>Someone pointed out that because they are dolls they could be singing like vocaloids. I liked the idea. Also it's better than the Traitor field, that's one of the worst of my old version, I don't even understand why you kept it. So I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine and made the free space Vocaloid.</br></br></br>  <br> I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine <br>Making it unnecessarily difficult.<br><br>Vocaloid is dumb.<br>They're dolls not robots.<br>We don't even know if they're singing.<br>We know they already have seiyuu.<br>Making the audience listen to shitty vocaloid speaking voices all the time would be a terrible decision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also the traitor field is fine.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if one of them defects. It won't be the dolls, and it won't be what's-her-face.<br>Elfnine being a traitor is a good, plausible, and simple one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tama's voice through a shitty robot filter <br>Just kill my ears.</br></br>  <br>Elfnein isn't a doll.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I thought she was the playing the red one for some reason.</br>  <br>Not difficult, it just says Elfnine is Fine. She's the most likely candidate.<br><br><br>Point taken, guess I just wanted it worded differently now, like "Elfnine Defects" would be more clear.<br><br>She's really the mysterious one, whose role and actions can't really be predicted yet.<br><br>Anyway, I'll leave the bingo alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's the most likely candidate. <br>True enough.<br><br>I'm pretty worried about whether her seiyuu can pull off a serious character.<br>Her design really doesn't suit such a squeaky cute voice. Maybe she has more range than I'm aware of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She voiced Cerebrum in Geneitaiyo, she'll be fine.</br></br>    Nana a lewd.  <br> believe in justice and hold a determination to fist </br>  Official relationship charts of S1 and G.  Is cc still alive over at the .tv? It's been months since I last streamed.  <br>I forget what she sounded like there.

But the loli was only for one scene, and I can't remember how she sounded.<br>The other forms were different voice actors.</br></br>  <br>If you mean cc as in the old streamer, no, neetball does it now.<br>If you mean cc as in the website, at the moment yes.</br></br>  When does it air? 1 pm?  <br><br>Oh, indeed.</br></br>  <br>1pm in every time zone.<br> Filtered. </br></br>  <br>Got it.

You shouldn't watch it.</br>  <br>They should have made Kawakami the DM. Imagine the level of world-building.</br>  Where are the subs  Airing in 5 hours. <br><br>Story :<br>The story takes place at a certain middle school where several murder cases take place. Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school, meets genius detective Akechi, who comes to the school to investigate. Kobayashi takes an interest in Akechi and, in spite of his friend Hashiba's worries, he volunteers to be Akechi's assistant.<br><br>Also, reminder that the cute ass is a  trap </br></br></br></br></br>  Meanwhile Kobayashi is MC of the Milky Homes VNS<br><br>http://tanteioperamilkyholmes.wikia<wbr>.com/wiki/Opera_Kobayashi</wbr></br></br>    Found surprisingly interesting observation on where i did not expect to find it (ANN anime previews, which are read as source of gigles every season)<br> His reactions are continually blasé in contrast to how the others around him act, and he sees people as gray shadows until they become important to him or his story. At first this can be written off as an artistic affectation, but the truth of it can be seen when he meets his new homeroom teacher – when she touches him, her hands become “real” while the rest of her remains gray until he looks up, indicating that he can clearly see the gray. This is yet another foreboding sign, especially since his parents remain gray shapes when they come to pick him up at the police station. <br><br>Then again, they are as ignorant about everything else as always. Random /a/non that did not watch any show knows more about it than ANN person paid to review it.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is that ejaculator investigator?</br>  <br>Who is this erector director?</br></blockquote>]
