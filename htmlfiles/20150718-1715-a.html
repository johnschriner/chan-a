[  airing in an hour <br> no thread <br><br>Dead show.<br>Dead fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  I could list everything wrong about it, but it's 1:00 AM here.  <br>I thought this aired on saturday.</br>  <br><br> Classroom <br><br><br>This is a complete turn off for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to watch it live, I was just too lazy to make a thread.</br>  Igarashi SB today, hyped  <br>It's a corporate drama with betrayal and intrigue. Or something like that.</br>  <br>It has much more than a school setting since they have on the job training as engineers as well as a corporate plot line</br>  Please don't mock sensei today. He's trying his best.  <br>isn't that tomorrow?</br>  <br>I want to marry Sensei.</br>  <br>Is it though? Is it anything?</br>  <br>No, you're confusing it with A/Z again. It's today.</br>  <br>Supposedly it will be clear by ep4.</br>   Motivated by his own speech.   <br><br>Great, he's turned into the jaded veteran who drinks instead of doing something useful. I hope he gets over it off screen.</br></br>  <br>Sensei a shit.</br>  who /Engineer/ here?  Half an hour to go.  Who /purple Inaho/ here?  <br>She's the reason I'm watching this.</br>  Who /yuriOTP/ here?  <br>Engineers best A-TECs</br>  <br>Girl Inaho/Orange Girl best couple. The guys can fuck each other, everyone's happy.</br>  STARTING  Sensei got rekt<br>Also dat Kobayashi Yuu</br>  <br><br><br>Me</br></br></br>  What was that about a spin-off about Iris and Mizuki?  Well done sensei, now they're all unemployed  <br>I can't into moon. What happened?</br>   that part where Iris tried to console Mizuki   Is Nagisa homosexual?  <br>how was it I missed it</br>  I want Nagisa to look down on me.  Suddenly Nagisa ass.  <br>  grill?  </br>  Too much dialogue, I didn't understand shit.  This seems to be shaping up what I wanted Plastic Memories to be, company stuff + a group actually working together instead romcom drama. Also Christmas cake flirting with underage man. Lot of good faces thanks to Igarashi.  <br>Dat ass though.</br>  <br> Dead fanbase. <br>There was no fanbase in first place, retard. To die something must exist.</br></br>  <br> bullies Sensei while encouraging him to try and drag him down <br> ignores hot woman in a towel <br>You tell me, anon.</br></br></br>   no capper on futakuro <br><br>Completely RIP.</br></br>  <br>I can't figure out my opinion of this show is. It's kinda shit, but I'm still intrigued.<br><br>Pilot best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Same. I'm still watching for GirlNaho, Mizuki and maybe Sensei. Also they said episode 4 was going to be important.</br>  I watch it for OreImo art style  <br>Sera was made for bullying</br>  I just want a show about mechanics ding mechanics things. . . <br><br><br>Pretty sure this is as close as I'm going to get.</br></br></br>  <br>Same.</br>  The only consistently good thing about this is Iris giving zero fucks about absolutely everything (except of course Mizuki).  <br>Iris is the only reason I watch this crap.<br><br>Her blowing off the Edgelord Buisiness guy is great</br></br></br>  <br> Igarashi storyboarding this episode <br>Can't wait</br></br>  Sensei was moe today.  <br>To be fair, there isn't any caps of Shokugeki no Souma episode today on futakuro as well.</br>  <br>TBS must be fucking up something then.</br>  Episode was 95% talking and money drama, the rest was Sensei drinking, Nagisa shower scene and 1 second of Iris/Mizuki. Still going to watch the next one.  <br><br>That only means that no one cared to be capper in there</br></br>        Who's this bitch    <br><br><br><br>Reminder that Nagisa finds this less interesting than working on the computer and angsting in the shower.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how successful men are made. You can't get to the top if you're weak to flesh.</br>    <br>Dat ass.</br>  Why do people link Purple with Inaho? I thought she looked more like Yuki.  The cutest.<br><br><br>Which Inaho are we speaking?</br></br></br>  <br>What other Inaho do you know?</br>  <br>She acts exactly like Inaho. So she's either Female Inaho or Inaho and Hime's lovechild (because she has Hime's VA)</br>  <br><br>I guess you mean A.Z Inaho then? I didn't watch A.Z S2 and wasn't sure if I'm remembering the name right.<br><br>I see the similarity but the fact that she's not MC and is openly recognized as a super-talented person who's been fished out from all over the nation as opposed to just being coincidentally there makes the whole thing much more believable and less obnoxious.</br></br></br></br>  Sensei will save A-TEC next week. I believe in him.  <br> complaining about mecha MC coincidentally being there </br>  <br>Because they are retarded newfags<br><br>Except Inaho was planning everything and was backed by the eye, Iris is completely reckless</br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched almost no mecha shows in my life but going by the only other one I remember, Buddy Complex, holy shit you're right.<br><br>Didn't know this was a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inaho was completely reckless whether he planned things or not.</br>  HS is up now    <br>Yes! I can finally understand boring business crap and Nagisa angst.</br>  <br>Inaho confirmed for beta<br><br>Iris confirmed for alpha.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why you bother watching it if you find the business stuff boring.</br>  <br>Is she also female L-Elf/Yuuki Kazami as well?</br>  <br>It has potential. I'm waiting for A-TEC to start fighting back not just them getting BTFO because their fucking around isn't profitable.</br>  How long until Iris will fall for Nagisa for real?  <br>fuck off, this is maruto's first attempt at yuri</br>  <br>They're both gay, so never.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are brother and sister from the same mother, you mongoloid.</br>  <br> Oreimo character design <br> MC is a 20-something old dude <br> Male ass shoot <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br><br>Just who is this show aimed at?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both reckless but stoic types who do everything for a girl. They're whatever that means.</br>  <br> yuri <br>Stop it<br>She obviously was disgusted by gay antics of her friend in this scene<br>Yes, even autist like her showed real human emotion</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>    <br>Everyone other than shounen, haremshit and straight romcom fans.</br>  <br><br>Take off those anti-yuri goggles.</br></br>  <br>Maybe there's some medication that could help with your autism, anon.</br>  <br>And if you think that's not enough, read the lyrics of the very same OP.<br><br>It couldn't be any more blatant really. Absolutely no holding back on this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Iris seems pretty into Mizuki, but it doesn't seem to be the same way in reverse</br>  <br>Lyrics about her and Nagisa, retard</br>  <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br>Like Hyouka's first ED?</br></br>  <br>Anon, you're cute.<br><br><br>The ED has Mizuki being all over Iris, and the show showed us Iris being all over Mizuki.<br><br><br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking retarded<br><br> takes away all the tools <br> use your creativity <br> told to top-end R&amp;D </br></br></br></br>  <br>He is going to get orange as a rebound.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are sibling, retard<br><br> Nagisa knows her name <br> ED shows Iris being all sad and shit, hinting sad past <br> Nagisa is a bastard child <br><br>HURR HURR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is dumb.  Not enough female Inaho.  No I don't want the cute nerd boy to leave  I still don't get the point of this garbage anime  <br><br>Maruto wanted to try something different from haremshit. Unfortunately, it backfired.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? It was pointed out the most simple way possible in this episode. Just drop it if you can't follow it even that much.</br>  <br>It's a clusterfuck</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/notcycaiyt.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Don't worry, it'll catch fire eventually, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>  Podracing when?  <br>How exactly, or are you just spouting out words? So far it's very simple story of two plotlines, Nagisa VS his brother and Sera trying to save A-TEC. And both of them are getting connected together.</br>  <br><br>Your face is a clusterfuck.<br><br>How fucking ADHD do you have to be not to get what's going on in this show?<br><br>Well, some parts are complicated. Nagisa's exact intentions aren't clear yet, but that's all.<br><br>One of the better shows of the season so far if you ask me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salarymen are right - the anime</br>  <br>now rei clones are called "female inaho"</br>  <br>It's just for the Mars setting retard.</br>   she sees your budget management   <br>Monstershit and haremshit prison are right next door.</br>  <br>That makes even less sense though given the amount of mecha newfags on this board its no wonder they think A/Z invented everything</br>  <br>Is Yuu Kobayashi typecast nowadays?</br>  <br>Yeah, A/Z is now also the only mecha anime that did the generic Mars/Spacenoids VS Terrans setting. Now I get why everyone on this board compare anything to that forgettable show, it's the only war themed anime they've seen.</br>   there are people that honestly haven't realized that edgy oreimo-man and girl inaho are going to end together   This ending reminds me of the Hanamonogatari ED.  <br> I am this blind </br>  <br>Without a doubt. It's sad considering the range she can do.</br>  <br> there are people who are honestly going to force this meme in every thread from now on <br><br>We need context-sensitive mods so we can successfully report shit like this.</br></br></br>  I really enjoy Nagisa and the accountants side of things compared to the A-TEC team. To see Sensei get absolutely laid into both Nagisa and Accountant in the beginning felt so satisfying to watch.<br><br><br>The engine the class was working on in the very beginning looked like Anakin's podracer engine.<br><br>When it gets up and running, someone better shout "IT'S Working, IT'S WORKING!" or else I'll be very disappointed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's the only war themed anime they've seen <br><br>While that might be true, A.Z is still fresh in the board's memory, hell there have been comparisons a lot of comparisons with Valvrave too. There's no need to get all butthurt only because you watched some other entry level mecha like Gundam.</br></br></br>  <br>If you've seen lot of robot war anime then it's just another forgettable one among many others. It did nothing special and it doesn't really deserve the attention it gets, whether it's positive or negative attention. Comparing CC to AZ because both have Mars setting in them(when you can barely even notice they live on Mars here) is just ignorant. I'm surprised people still even bother remembering it.</br>  <br><br>I hate it.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter if it deserves the attention it gets or not, people still keep talking about VVV or Cross Ange despite both being absolutely horrible too, they just happen to be quite recent or left some impact in the board, for one reason or another, when they were airing. That's all there's to it.</br>  <br>It's even worse when A/Z never actually explored the Mars setting at all so the comparison makes even less sense. I would have went with Rei-clone, female Chirico or hell even a female Setsuna since at least they're more popular.</br>  <br>Do you actually think this will be a thing? /u/ bait very rarely becomes anything more than bait.<br>There probably won't be any romance at all.</br></br>  <br>You've never had a job with a shit boss?</br>  They have no creative spirit. Terrible engineers, all of them.<br>This anime hits me in the right spots though. I'm enjoying it.</br>    <br><br>Yup, she's also Smith from Monmusu lol<br><br>Well, Iris is Miia, and Mizuki is Papi as well...</br></br></br></br>   tfw your teacher fucked up with his naive dreams and you now have no education or experience for any real job <br>Becoming a boipussy is the only choice.</br>  <br>10/10 hank hill ass.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>I have yet to watch the episode... they fired shortpants?</br>  <br> boipussy <br><br>Wait isn't that a girl?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you understand how art works.</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you so autistic about this? At this point you're just bringing more attention to A.Z. Let it die in peace.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you?</br>  <br><br> Get OreNoImouto character design <br> Do a speculator ass-shot with it <br><br>Sure, why not?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He left on his own, he's the rocket tester and can't do shit in those conditions.<br>Though I'm hopeful they all come back and can do podracing again.<br><br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a girl called Subaru last season.</br>  <br>Fuck these kids and fuck the teacher. Bunch of spoiled self-entitled cunts.</br>  <br>He quit.</br>  <br>Well, yes.<br> Also most Japanese names are gender-neutral, newfriend. </br></br>  <br>I hope we will see them cry like bitches the moment they realize they did the wrong choice.</br>   nii-san   So Nagisa's broher is hogging the money to his own pocket and uses A-TEC as excuse?  <br> Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you? </br>  <br>MC saved A-TEC. Had he left them in their state they would have disbanded in less than 3 months.</br>  I want to fuck girl Inaho and watch her stare blankly into my eyes.  I'm really enjoying this. It's Maruto and all, but I hope this continues to ignore romance for the business and regular drama.  Is MC a faggot?  I skim through the episode now after the first ep.<br>It's so fucking boring.</br>  The Glasslip of the season.  <br>He has no time for needy Christmas cakes</br>  <br>Fuck off, retard</br>  <br>He's alpha. Wanting to fuck constantly and doing it when presented the opportunity at the drop of a hat, is a sign of a virgin.</br>  <br><br>Next episode looks like it's gonna be hijinks...<br><br>He said to watch out for ep 4, but it's probably another bait and switch episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you people understood that wrong. He said that by episode 4 you have the whole idea what kind of show this is, as it's more slow-paced and we still aren't entirely clear what Nagisa is about to do.</br>  <br><br>Yes, end-game pairing are Iris x Mizuki and Sensei x Nagisa</br></br>  The best transfer student  <br><br>Guess that's when Nagisa lays out his goals then</br></br>  <br> his goals then <br>Become CEO<br>Destroy brother<br>Get some student pussy</br></br></br></br>  DISREGARD BITCHES<br><br>ACQUIRE INFLUENCE AND POWER</br></br>  At the same time I think it's good if the cast size is being cut half but then again I don't want some characters to leave. How can the smug boy leave his nerd bro behind, at least keep him.  <br>Whit dat ass nobody notized the scars on his back.</br>  <br>But anon, I too would prefer to work on a functioning spaceship than wasting my time with a girl like that.<br>It's much more thrilling and satisfactory.</br></br>  Not you too.  So, is the CEO secretly embezzling funds for some shadow project? <br><br>I hope it's not going to be that the Kirishina company is somehow trying to create weapons or new types of military craft because that is more profitable, or even fund a private army of mercenaries to take over stuff. That would be too cliché.</br></br>  <br>Asumin leaving, THAT really broke my heart. Though now that they have Angelina I guess she's become actually superfluous. If only they had listened to her all along, they could've prevented this.</br>  <br>I think the brother is incompetent and the company is going down the drain.</br>  <br> posting Korrashit <br><br>Now you have me convinced you yurifags are just trying to stirr shit up. That is, if you even are the real thing and not just some bunch of falseflagging shitposters who are still riding high after your success of killing countless Hibikek threads.</br></br></br>  STOP BULLYING  <br> yurifags <br>You realize that's an anti-yuri poster?<br><br>The yuri in this show is overt. Go watch it.<br><br>Also I don't remember a single time I've seen "yurifags" ruining a thread, but I've seen countless times people were complaining about "yurifags" supposedly shitting up threads, and actually shitting up the thread in the progress.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But they're selling laser-guided vehicles and are some sort of huge insurance company now. <br><br>By having made the A-TEC R/D department irrelevant, surely the company wouldn't have any financial problems anymore. <br><br>Unless the big brother CEO did some really terrible investments.</br></br></br></br></br>  You guys seriously have nothing better to discuss than the potential yuri or lack of thereof between a background character and the MC's sister? Really?  <br> The yuri in this show is overt. <br> This is what yurishitters actually believe <br><br>Here we go again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first time witnessing shitposting on /a/? Forcing straigh vs yuri wars has become the method du jour for that.</br>  <br>Thank you based Christ. I got about three minutes into this episode before realising I needed to start 120Sing it.<br>Returned for dat ass, though.</br></br>  Just finished ep 3. First episode was ok, second was meh but this one was actually good, just need a little more of this and we are good to go.  <br>Shame it's starting out so slow and takes some sweet time for getting into gear. That's a risky road to take for an anime original show, since a substantial portion of the brain dead general audience suffering from ADHD will have dropped it by the second episode. Just look at our very own threads.</br>  For what purpose?  <br>Yes I have, what is Subaru going to do from now on, will he ever come back, will he ever be smug again.</br>  <br>yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom<br>gotta bait those fujo bux if you want to turn a profit<br><br>kiryuu is a true business hero, saving a-tec and disc sales at the same time</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. Despite the company he's still managing to fuck it up, and due to the brother complex, he don't want to be seen as inferior to his little brother. So he's thrown him at all the toughest problems and given him impossible jobs, but he's still managed to save every company he worked for and give them V shaped results. <br>Now the older brother is getting even more angry and has thrown him at the A-TEC department, hoping he won't be able to save it.</br></br>  <br>There's lot of man ass this season. Kobayashi's little boy butt in Chinpo Kitan, shower scene in Prison School and now this.</br>  What's wrong with alpha-females?  <br>Only faggots let themselves be pushed around by women.</br>  <br> Angist in the shower <br> Sensei red face shows up <br><br>I thought he was going to fap to sensei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri people are wearing their goggles tighter each season, anon.<br><br>Soon they'll claim that BL-shows are yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean, why did she got mad when she was called alpha?</br>  I love the faces, it was especially good with Igarashi's SB this episode. Also that Iris.  So did DDY drop this show or what?<br>they had the only good release of the first episode.</br>  <br> yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders </br></br>  <br>I think they're aware the material might be a bit boring for some, so they add in some fanservice to keep people interested until something exciting happens.</br>  <br>nobody watches this shit</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be easier for the big brother CEO to simply promote his little brother into a position where he'd have absolutely no influence? Also, there would still be that problem with the funds for A-TEC that aren't being reported to the rest of finance and administration. They do say that the money has to go somewhere. Would the big brother CEO really use it to pay some huge debts that were caused by his own incompetence?</br>  <br>Igarashi and his sunsets</br>  <br>And since when that stop they keep making yuri?<br>Probably is a sucess but you are ignoring other things</br></br>  <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders <br> and yet the show as a whole barely sold somewhat decently <br><br>your revered hibikek was no smash hit, anon</br></br></br></br>    <br>you are cancer<br>kill yourself</br></br>  This show is really bad. I think it's only going to get worse. The only shows this season less deserving of threads are like:<br><br>- Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan<br>- Dandelion<br>- Shimoneta</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's professional baiting.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>i am the quimioterapy</br>  <br>Japan likes their women to be subservient Yamato Nadeshikos. Therefore instead of calling her "alpha woman" she might as well have called her an unlovable hairy bull dyke.</br>  <br> Kuusen <br><br>The only one you got right.</br></br></br>  <br>Engineer Flamenco just wanted to dream</br>  <br>You're probably just some random shitposter who's into roleplaying. In a way, it's even worse than tripfagging. So yes, you should definitely kill yourself.</br>  What is this show even trying to do?<br><br>They marketed it with the two girls, but they don't do anything and Kaito and Nagasa are for all intents and purposes the protagonists. Then they yuribait in the ED while having the actual show focus only on Kaito and Nagisa, complete with gratuitous man-ass of Nagisa. Commit to one thing and stop trying to pander to everyone, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>Either you're retarded, or you're commenting despite not having watched the show yet, which I guess also makes you retarded.</br>  This show needs more of the shota.  <br>But he left  ;_; </br>  <br>He and the IT guy are the best characters.</br>  <br><br>That's why</br></br>    <br>This director's last work ignored the cutest smug shota most of the time after episode 1, I don't trust him anymore.</br>  <br>FFF is doing it, though I have no idea how their release is.</br>  I'm not picking this up until the ending is confirmed to not be edgy drama relationship garbage like WA2.  <br>At the very least they're better than Crunchyroll</br>   Claris ED <br><br><br>I thought they had split up?</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't much better than CR, which they were likely editing from. They did typesetting and fixed some of the more blatant errors, but name orders were still getting switched around.</br>  <br><br>WA2 was an exception, the last anime he worked on was very fun to watch.</br></br>  <br>One of them left the group, remaining one brought in another friend.</br>  D-did they fuck?  <br>Saekano was also edgy relationship garbage with that bully tsundere.</br>  <br>Apparently not. She did intend to, he on the other hand just baited her by allowing her to use the bath.</br>  <br><br>I see. Still sounds more or less like before to me. Not that I mind.</br></br>  <br><br>That was only one scene in episode 9 and it ended with the tsundere getting BTFO</br></br>  <br>He's gay.</br>  <br> shower scene immediately cutting to this face <br>No wonder</br></br>  <br>Please, even if he was gay he wouldn't have such low standards.</br>  <br> hot teacher <br> low standards <br>pl--<br>oh, you mean teacher about Nagisa. Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Nagisa is rich, ambitious, powerful and good-looking.</br>  <br>He's scarred to hell and back, probably ass raped used goods.</br>  <br>Ahhhh, corporate politics and embezzling fraud. I love this so much it hurts.</br>  <br>But Sensei is hardworking, cute and kind<br>Please don't bully</br></br>  I wanted to drop this show, but god damn that cast. It even has Chiyo-chan. I can't do it.  <br>I like him, that's why I bully him</br>  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>Thought that was her voicing Angelina<br><br><br>Didn't he call her Hattori-kun before going to the shower?</br></br></br></br></br>  I watch this for her.<br><br> Yes, my autism is at such level. </br></br>  2cute4me  <br><br>Only reason to watch this show. I want to see more of her racing.</br></br>  Nagato a cute   Subaru quit <br> PR qt quit <br>Will they come back, /a/?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Of course. Theres going to be that generic scene where the characters that didn't leave are all working towards some goal which has time constraints and then all the characters who left start showing up one by one saying stuff like "Heh looks like you can use a hand." and all that.</br></br></br>  This is bullying.  <br>Nothing wrong with that. Those sensei and those kids were running things like lockheed martin.</br>  <br>Literally the only reason I'm still watching  but to be honest I'm still kind of interested in all the business drama. </br>  <br> probably ass raped used goods. <br>This, you don't go from illegitimate child from rich soon-to-be-CEO without pleasing few old-men for money.</br></br>  He wants A-TEC to succeed ultimately?  <br>Seriously, she was the best.</br>  <br>Probably. Even if it's just to spite his older brother. Of course, officially, he will comply with his orders and do whatever is necessary to downsize A-TEC, but in a way so that it actually still retains enough efficiency and really forces the staff to be extremely creative, searching for new ways to be cost-effective, environment-friendly, cheap, and yet good.</br>  Who Subaru here?  I really like the ED song. Full version when?  Nagisa wants to fuck Kaito right?  <br>They actually the spoiled kids, they really should known that money is serious problem.</br>  <br>Yes. Chief said Nagisa needs him sexually.</br>  another show that could have been great with maybe half the characters. I feel like the other half is just there because they had some anime cliche quota to fill.  <br>Ehh. R and D should be the last place you cut money if you're a megacorp. Google pisses away billions on its new hires, and they do so because one good innovation can literally change or even create an entire industry.</br>  <br>Well you're in luck because half the cast just left forever this episode</br>  <br>Yeah, he's the tough love boss.<br><br>...AKA totally fucking boring, give more screentime to Iris</br></br></br>  <br>Is it really R&amp;D if it's a group of sixteen-year-olds pissing away their money with nothing but a busted rocket to show for it?</br>  <br>Yup. Have you seen the first few Space X launches? The early days of Nasa? Shit's on fire, yo.</br>  <br>Was Space X created by sixteen-year-olds?</br>  <br> Chinpo Kitan <br><br>How have I not heard that before? Also, what the fuck is up with all these shitters watching this show and complaining about it not being haremshit?</br></br></br>  <br>What about F-35-chan?<br>What's the excuse?</br></br>  So will sensei plow the delicious Christmas cake?  All auditors as scary as Angelina?  <br>This show is about business. Like all this shit is about business. Next thing you know, they're going to be doing six sigma or some shit as well as have someone do the quality and process management.</br>  So, do they expect us to be on the side of A-TEC? So far, I'm feeling Nagisa has the better side.  The A-TEC students and Kaito are spoiled as fuck. That much money wasted on a rocket that ultimately got destroyed, and they request even more? Angelina was 100% correct with everything she said to them. All that money with no innovation. Terrible.

They just engage in marathon sex with their favorite teaser, pausing only to put their husbands back to sleep.<br><br>I got to thinking about Cerea though. That bra video, as well as other evidence, suggests she's only 103I when she exhales. Her mother is a "mere" 110J(K?).

Tripod legs  <br>For my penis</br>  So am I the only one that reads the Sailor Moon  hentai  series  on ImageFap ? Mercury and Venus on the train are my favourite ones.  Did you like the new opening and ending songs?  No and no  The first ending was great, it managed to get me hyped for the next episode every time. This one is just "fine"  ED visulas were saved thanks to based Nao.  Its decent but I loved the old ED especially the ending of it.  Opening is better but ending song is alright.  SHIT they changed the OP and ED?<br><br>I accidently conditioned myself to eat a specific meal while watching this show. <br><br>I freak out if i dont watch the Op while eating.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is really good<br>Especially the part where Megumi orgasms while tomatoes are raining</br>  I feel the new OP fits really well for all the stuff that's going to happen soon.  Not nearly as much as the previous OP/ED. Good episode though, I'm hyped as shit for next one  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>Didn't like the songs for either, but liked the visuals of the new ED.</br>   They replaced the glorious first opening with this shit. <br>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.</br>  They're really good. The last ED was overrated as hell, the only good part of it was the changing faces every episode.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  I've never watched the entire OP for this show  <br> First opening <br> Glorious <br>It was shit</br></br></br>  I don't understand how anyone could possible prefer the first OP over this one.  Spot the  otp   Full color chapter is out.<br>http://imgur.com/a/8jmzj<br>Shit scans never.</br></br>  <br>If the characters in the ladle indeed change, I figure Isami will be visible then and these guys will be turned around.</br>    <br>All I can see is Hisako's butt and that slutty look on her face like she desperately wants some cock.</br>  I like the new OP, it's kinda spoily for Animeonlyfags tho.    <br>why the fuck is meat in there<br>that makes me mad as fuck</br></br>  <br>Souma's dad beat you to it.</br>  <br>This.<br>Ibusaki and Marui got even a higher score than her.</br></br>  Souma reaching top 5 and Erina moving to the polar star when?  I want Kanon to appear in the festival.<br>A maid cafe would be good too.</br>  <br>she's the love interest</br>  <br>Both OP are ok, but the first one is glorious and for comparision this one is shit.</br>  <br> I want Kanon to appear in the festival. <br><br> Kanon visits Soma's booth <br> Soma and Megumi offer her their food <br> she's all happy seeing them again and eating their food <br> Soma sees Erina passing by <br> "Oi, Nakiri!" <br> Erina and Kanon respond   "Nani?" <br> everyon'es face when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the irrelevant one.</br>   There are people that don't pick Yuki   <br>They literally could not have picked a worse ending song. I didn't think i'd be able to hate vocals that bad in an OP/ED song since fear and loathing in Las Vegas</br>  <br><br> no more fuwa fuwa <br><br>Fucking dropped</br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck that voice on whoever sings the ED, what the fuck she sounds pretty annoying  It's the nasally vocals that put people off from the new OP, right? You guys probably don't like Nano Ripe, either.<br><br>I can see why it's a bit of an acquired taste, but I like it.</br></br>  <br>It's better than the last OP, not that that means much</br>  I TOLD YOU ALL<br>I TOLD YOU ERINA AND SOMA ARE SIBLINGS<br>YOU DIDN'T LISTEN</br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br>is anime your autism medicine</br>  <br>animeonlyfags, everybody</br>  <br>They aren't.</br>  <br>are you fucking retarded</br>  <br>ED's not that bad, but the OP is tragic.</br>  <br> Erina <br> living in some dorm like a commoner <br><br>I'd like to see grandpa slap the shit out of her with an eviction to Polar Star</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has her own money. Has a job that pays extremely well. Has connections and high level of business acumen.<br><br>In short order she would buy, remodel, and stock the polar star dorm with servants without even needing her family's money.</br></br></br>  オオオオオオ lives on.  Did they add a lot of anime only scenes or was it just me  Does the new OP mean were going to end at the end of the Autumn Election? Looks like it from the moon. <br>Either way, I'm fucking hype.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3i_<wbr>0j4vFnUk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I dig the ED. You just have to listen to it a few more times.</br></br>  <br>No, we'll get only the preliminaries. Gigga Nigga wasn't even in the OP.</br>  Casanova is out.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/127/page/1<br><br>wow how come so fast compared to last week?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Because Jump came out early this week for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Was wondering how they would have pulled off like 50chapters, but alright, I'm down. I want the Election to be thoroughly adapted, so let's hope for S2.</br></br>   surstroming  <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>   he does it for free   <br>These lyrics are fucking weird.</br>  <br>The Alice trio scene was great.<br><br>Also, Nao a cute.</br></br></br>  So Ryou with his flattering is like a bad influence for Alice.  What Souma is planning? God damn it, I really want to know. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br>  <br>I just like how he's basically saying "hey, you don't have to mean it, just do it".</br>  why doesn't casanova just put the translations in the full color pages  <br>We still need to know whom he gave a key to and why, along with what's happened with Eizan and Rindou.</br>  <br>Because it's far harder to clean.</br>  <br>It's hell to redraw color pages.</br>  They were both shit. The ending specially so.  <br>I don't know much about that process but I figure redraws are harder?</br>  <br>Yeah. The first OP is one of the worst I ever seen (sound wise)</br>  <br>Hand was mysterious girl from chapter 117.</br>  <br>Probably a man's hand. It was the same size as Souma's and notably larger than Megumi's on the same page.</br>  <br>how do you tell</br>  <br>She was the only background character that wasn't full colored in the color chapter. Same with Yugi and Nene.</br>  So is Souma gonna be able to marry Erina knowing that everytime they fuck, she's gonna be thinking of his dad?  So they skipped the introduction of the AE which means half of the dialogue is going to be original. Gonna be wierd.  I like this OP more. Builds anticipation for the tournament really nicely.<br><br>The ED is okay I guess, but it's no Fura Fura~ and it will take some time for me to stop missing that ED. <br><br>I do like that they featured stalker-chan in it though.</br></br></br></br>   tfw jc staff are doing 2 other shows this season   <br>His goal has always been to beat his old man. On every front.</br>  <br>What if the punishment includes grandpa using HIS connections to get her temporarily blacklisted by her usual clients?</br>  <br>The loli master strikes again</br>  <br><br>Thank you, someone else who can see her charm. It's the same charm as Tomoko, but useful.</br></br>  I only liked the old OP when Soma was singing it drunk.  Hinako and Donato a best.  This series has provided the most lighthearted enjoyment out of any series from at least the last 5 years, if not the last 10.<br><br>It's great, relaxing, interesting, and fun to watch. I love it.</br></br>  I see we got scans of the recipe book's SS today, I'll get started on them right away.  <br>Yeah there's few shows I don't procrastinate on anymore, but even after catching up on the manga I still look forward to new episodes of this.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  I like the new OP and how it shows everyone's dishes (I'm sure Ryo's will also be revealed later). The ED is sexy but nowhere near as fun as fura fura. Also, /u/ overload.  <br>I want to make Souma a little half-sister.</br>  Neither songs for OP or ED feel particularly good.<br><br>Visually the OP is pretty nice but I feel like there is too much emphasis on Hayama being the top rival.</br></br>  <br>I think that might only seem the case for mangafags. <br><br>Should ask animefags the impression they got from it.</br></br></br>  <br> Same with Yugi and Nene. <br><br>Maybe that was a rejected design for Rindou.</br></br></br>  How did Ryou get from<br> talk shit after you have more wins against me <br> as usual, your cooking is too pretty but lacking taste <br> you lost because you're too casual <br>to<br> hey currybro, you gotta compliment her first  <br>? <br>And all the first three was said by unbandanaed Ryo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not seeing how that's incompatible.<br>They're competitive, but live together and have to work together, so he learns to grease her wheels when he needs to, so to speak.</br></br>  <br>We know that he is quite competitive so it's no surprise for him to trash-talk in the situation he was in. On the other hand he is quite docile when in butler mode.</br>  <br>He realized the reason his father's recipe loses to Yugi's is because the guy deliberately made it milder since they run a special of the day restaurant. <br><br>Hence there is a way to "complete" the recipe for full spice.</br></br></br>  How do we go from this  <br>to THIS?</br>  <br><br>I don't know but I'm not complaining, that shit was hilarious.</br></br>  <br>I really liked this scene, J.C. Staff did a good job.</br>  I really like how Souma can get along with just about everybody.<br><br>The thought never came to mind about these two meeting but their interactions are pretty funny and has great potential.</br></br>  <br>wait, is the new issue translated? I just caught up and dont remember reading this</br>  <br/>  <br> not yukihihihihihihihihira </br>  <br>thank you friend</br>  <br>I wish she smiled more.</br>  <br>So the bandannas do nothing?</br>  <br>They lower the salt content of the dishes.</br>  <br>It's just his full gear.</br>  <br>looking fey there, Donato</br>  Would you cut your vegetables on this chopping board?  seriously, I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. I suppose its more interesting to have him struggle some, but how long can they keep it going?  <br>He'll probably get in in his second year.</br>  <br>the first year will end soon, the top 5 E10 will graduate and there will be 5 spots open.<br>being top 3 Souma will get into E10 easily.</br></br>  <br>What if skill is not the prime requirement and instead it is influence? You win Shokugekis, increase your resources and then when you have the pull, you get into the E10?</br>  I'm really hoping they have a new ED every week focusing on another character/relationship from the Elections. <br><br> Hayama's Oedipus complex <br> Alice/Ryou childhood Shokugekis <br> Takumi/Meat 'Tsundere off' <br> Giganigga    version of Spice where he replaces every character  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then he will also get into the E10 easily.</br>  <br> I thought by this far in Souma would have already made the elite 10. <br>why? You did notice that except for the freak of nature that is Erina, that they are all upperclassmen right?</br></br>  <br> new ED every week <br>That's a tall order, bub.<br>Do you want a full new themed song every week, too?</br></br></br>  <br>well one of the purpose of the the autumn election is to rank the first year students.<br>but there will surely be an arc about selecting the new E10, there will only be speculations until then.</br></br>  <br>Bleach did that shit for all 13 divisions back in season two or something.<br>It is rare but we can always have hope.</br></br>  <br> Takumi with some slut he just talked like two times. <br> Not his fucking brother. <br><br>Anon pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the first year will end soon <br><br>Not really, the training camp was just some weeks after the start of the school year, the Autumn election was almost immediately after that and now we're in the Moon Banquet, the last event of said Autumn.<br>Sometimes I wonder if the series is even going to cover the second year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it has only been about 6 months then? <br>I am retarded.</br></br>  We don't know how the rankings are done. Is it all through Shokugekis for position? Then the higher ranked would never have a reason to accept a challenge with a lower rank unless the lower rank gambled something so risky that getting a higher rank wouldn't be worth it. It would still happen that way, but it would be less frequent, and losing would cost your seat at least.<br><br>It's probably ranked primarily off regular events like the election.</br></br>  <br>Should be early november, since that's when these festivals take place. The leaf viewing a few weeks back in Oct.<br><br>School year wraps up in early March with 3rd years graduating. Before then, there's also winter break for a couple of weeks.<br><br>There's around 4 months left for the school year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also SHAFT just did it for Nisekoi.</br></br>  <br>DEEP LORE</br>  <br>How? He doesn't really have much to offer. Sure, he's beaten a lot of people in Shokugekis, but all he took was knowledge. For groups willing to give their assistance, all I can think of is the Don RS and the Polar Star Dorm. Compare the current E10 that we know of.<br><br>Isshiki has a company and is more or less the defacto student for the Polar Star Dorm. Eizan has ihs businesses and his groupies and Kuga has won enough Shokugekis to become in charge of one of the biggest RS in the academy. Then you have Erina with all fo her own personal cooking facilities and her money from God Tongue.</br></br></br>  <br> Not putting the tsundere's together <br><br>No anon, you pls.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm all aboard putting two tsunderes together!</br></br>  <br>He gains reputation, which seems like a pretty good kind of currency to have in Tootsuki since everyone worth a shit is out for glory and recognition. Then he can get challenges just for having a good record and get stuff that way. I'm sure you're not absolutely REQUIRED to have an outside business going or something of the sort to be in the elite 10.</br>  <br> Since Takumi is aware of girls I wonder what is the type he likes </br>  <br><br>That's better than I could've imagined myself, it's things like this that justify watching the anime adaptation.</br></br>  Did Alice change her mind because of what Ryou said (she became aware of his consideration for her all this time) or what Hayama said (finally someone tells it to her like it is)? The big panel of her serious expression before Ryou starts speaking seem to indicate the latter.  <br>Pretty sure it was because of Hayama.</br>  <br>I just didnt think they would put so many challenges between him and the goal, since early on he seems so gifted I was surprised when they introduced so many people in the frist years besides Erina who could challenge him. I thought he would quickly reach her level.</br>  <br>I can see it happening, especially when she's rich and enrolled in a class handled by a 7th seat</br>  <br>She's not stupid.</br>  <br>Anyone who his nii-chan approves probably.</br>   Tadokoro, I'm sorry, but we might be sleeping a bit less from today on. <br>L-lewd.</br>  <br>So will she also be in the elite 10 or will she use her newly discovered skills to follow him around like an assistant?</br>  <br> since early on he seems so gifted <br>We already know that's not the case. It's gonna cost him some blood to reach the top.</br></br>  <br>yeah we knew that later on when his dad explained it, we didnt know it if the first few chapters</br>  <br>I like to think it was because of both.</br>  So with J.C Staff skipping the Karrage arc in the anime entirely, how will they show Soma's conflict with Eizen?  <br><br>Am I seeing a potential new ship?</br></br>  <br> mangapanda </br>  <br>Probably will get OVA'd</br>  <br> inb4 Gigganigga doesn't exists, they replace him with Nikumi. </br>  <br>I just want to know how the ending of the anime will ruin everything</br>  <br>I will fucking laugh if Hayama wins the Alicebowl.</br>  is next chapter going to be the final day of the moon festival? I remember reading it would last only 3 days, but I might be wrong  <br>Maybe, but then what hope is there for a second season if they're skipping manga content? <br><br>Episode 15 ends at Chapter 41. With 127 chapters out as of today, there's more than enough for 3 seasons already (If it were to ever get more than 1)</br></br></br>  <br>5 days.</br>  Are you excited to finally get off the boat!  reminder that people have died or given up hope of seeing what happens to Guts &amp; Co    <br>I'm ready for the return trip.</br>  <br> They don't show what happens on the island <br> they simply skip to the party leaving the island </br></br>  <br>Don't joke about these things m8 it might actually happen!</br>  <br>honestly i stopped reading after the chapter with a girl that was a mermaid?

The chapter gets pretty Cthulu like and has a few terrifying scenes, even for Berserk.

Nobody mentioned it last thread, but Griffith being born of the demon child's "sacrifice" to protect his mother means that Casca can faintly feel his essence inside of Griffith. Griffith also recognizes that when he involuntarily rescues Casca from some falling rocks caused by Guts' battle with Zodd, but dislikes having been made to do that.<br><br>Says a lot about the kid's power, doesn't it?</br></br></br>    This is highly irregular.  <br> mangafox <br><br>Sacrifice yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> adult human being <br> too scared to do something because shyness <br>I'm having a hard time believing this.</br></br></br>  What manga should I read while waiting for the new chapter?  <br>Personally I recommend all of the good ones and none of the bad ones.</br>  <br>You are a good person.</br>  <br>I dropped Berserk long before they even got on the boat. Most people itt reading it weren't even old enough to be into anime when I dropped it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=27N<wbr>FgaQlyA8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Master of Martial Hearts.</br>  <br>Vargas.

He's also the complete opposite of Miura in that not only does he deliver, but JoJo will never end because Araki is an immortal pillar man. </br>       &gt; 6 months later on indefinite hiatus again <br><br>I moved on and now Vinland Saga has taken its place</br></br>  <br> almost to the island <br> intercepted by Griffith/Apostles <br> Gut dies on the ship <br> Guts literally never gets off the boat </br></br></br></br>    <br> Guts and crew arrive at the suspiciously small island <br> It's actually an Island-shaped apostle <br> Transforms itself into a prison boat </br></br></br>  <br>I've just finished reading all of berserk up until the latest chapter. I saw some threads about how berserk is being resumed, so I figured it was finally time to start reading.<br>But two and a half years? It's so short compared to all the other arcs. It's also pretty insignificant to the story.<br>Reading all of it finally made me realise why people complain about it so much. It's really good. The art is amazing. The story is amazing as well.

Point is, everyone in Berserk is a slut.</br>  All these people saying we're only getting one chapter are wrong, Young Animal put it on monthly when it was announced to be coming back.  <br>At least post a manga page you faggot</br>  Daily reminder that if you don't spend at least 5 minutes appreciating a panel like this you're reading Berserk wrong.  <br> not liking best doujin </br>  <br>What emotion is this picture trying to convey?</br>  <br><br>I can't wait till it comes crashing down.

He started reading manga when I got into it since I would go to his house after school. It was a past time of ours. Around 6 years ago we found it and read it. He died 2 years ago (T_T)</br>  <br> there are, RIGHT NOW, people on /a/ who have not experienced vol 13 <br><br>why is this allowed</br></br></br>        <br><br>Does she have any chance land her Gutsman husbando?</br></br>    <br>This page always makes me smile.</br>  <br>Can't wait for Guts to lose all his companions again.</br>  <br><br>no hope: guts x casca<br>likely: guts x farnese<br>i wish: guts x shierke</br></br></br></br>  <br> my girl's <br>Too cute.

It's as if Miura wanted to keep it at the absolutely best and stay that way when he was fine with a lower standard.<br><br>He went from 80s artstyle to pretty damn good art to every page must be a fucking masterpiece.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lower the number of details </br>  <br>Because Berserk is famous for its art you dolt</br>  <br>nice dubs anon, but im sorry, it wont work out between them. i honestly would like it to be as simple as <br><br>Casca: "Guts my love!, lets be together forever"</br></br></br>  <br>Guts is gunna impale her figuratively and literally.</br>  <br> Did you not go to school? <br> How do you even use this site? <br>Well maymay boy :^)</br></br></br>  <br><br>A lustful loli following you into Hell and beyond because she's so enamored with your manliness and will risk death just to claim you is a must-have requirement for any hero worth his salt.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Yeah I know, but he is not going to finish it even without the breaks.<br><br>He is going to get ill before that. Ilness or health issues are codewords in japanese society for working too much, but because it might be seen as shameful, they just use "health issues"<br><br><br>Has he ever done weekly? Obviously his art improved over the years, but if he once tried a weekly schedule or even two weeks, then he can produce it faster and actually get it done before getting too ill to draw.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128230315 <br>K</br>  <br>Jesus, he's really been through some shit. By the end of the series his whole body is gonna be one large lump of scar tissue.</br>  <br> weekly <br> i dont know what work is <br><br>Anon this shit takes time, he probably spends a week on two pages<br>Even if he went full shit tier art a week is pushing it, unless he worked sleepless all week.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been thinking a bit about Casca for awhile now. Especially this image where Guts says ''it doesn't mean it will be back to normal''.<br>I always wondered if that would apply to Casca. If you piece her back together, would she become normal like the old Casca we all used to love.<br><br>And, personally, I think so. There's an old notion and art in Japan called Kintsugi. Basically, the concept is that something broken, with added gold, is considered more beautiful than in its original state. It solidifies the original object and shows that it is stable and has been through hardships. <br><br>So concerning Casca, if she were to ever be pieced together, not only would she perhaps not become normal as she once was, but she will become more beautiful and stronger than she used to be.<br><br>Also the fairy dust looks a bit like gold.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> actually wanting Berserk to look like generic shit out of Jump  <br><br>I'd rather it never finished.</br></br></br>  <br>Oups, forgot pic.</br>  <br>What if she is restored, but she remembers nothing. Oh man that would destroy Guts, and me.<br>I want them to have one last moment together, Guts deserves it.</br></br>  <br>shit</br>  <br>Damn straight.<br><br><br> she remembers nothing <br>I doubt that. Skull Knight said that what Casca wants is not what Guts wants. Meaning, to me at least, is that she would be content with not remembering that she was raped and betrayed.<br><br>But I think that Casca will get over it. She can't be *that* weak.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> still look enjoyable <br>But Berserk is known for looking fantastic without compromise. The chibi/chestnut shenanigans are as cutesy as it's ever going to get.<br>Probably.<br> Hopefully. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also wondering how Casca would be if she stopped being retarded.<br><br>I doubt her brain is retaining most of her current adventures with Guts and his party. Not only would she have to remember all of her old memories, but there is also explaining to her all of the shit she missed while she was out. She has so little time to absorb so much information.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are there so many faggots in Berserk verse?<br><br>In medieval times homosexuality was instant death.</br></br></br>  <br> it's impossible to hide homosexuality <br> you would kill a noble for homosex <br> you would kill a noble for doing anything <br> nobles are peasants <br> nobles have to follow the rules <br>You poor pleb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>Faggots still existed you moron</br></br></br>  <br>F<br><br>honestly a really sad moment, it didnt phase me the 1st time through, but the re-read had me feeling.</br></br></br>  <br>We only get those for a page at most.<br><br><br>Have you read History? Fucking little boys has been a staple of western culture since the Greeks and that has never changed. It's still a common practice today.<br>Boylove is even more horriying when you realize the insane amount of rich people who have fucked young boys out of temptation, not because they were gay, but because they were taboo, even more so than young girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure about that.</br>  <br> She can't be *that* weak. <br><br> tries to kill herself because leading the hawks was too much stress and Griffith didn't want to sleep with her  <br><br>not everyone is Guts m8</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That coincidentally looked exactly like griffith</br>  <br> I don't understand history at all: the post </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128230930   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128230930 <br>Speaking of Catholic Church, something I greatly admire with Miura is that none of the priest ever do something sexually immoral like fucking young girls or lusting over people, etc.<br>Sure, they're dogmatic assholes and never listen to reason but they are have never been brought down to that stereotypical level.<br><br>I really find that interesting in Berserk.<br>Miura could have easily done it but he didn't. <br>It's the same with Mozgus. He killed a shitton of people but was still very kind in an era that would never give a damn about disabled or ugly looking people. And he never delved in lustful sins, as far as the story has shown.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>4 weeks in a month means he made 8 pages, yet there is over 20 in the monthly?<br><br>Come on anon this is just simple math.<br><br><br>He can easely tone it down to other manga level of art who release it weekly aswell.<br><br><br>Greeks arent white, so no, it would be punishable by death.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4 weeks in a month <br><br>Uhh<br>Ok<br>Anon its not just drawing, he has to write the story too.<br>You clearly havent got a clue what youre talking about</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was punishable by death but that doesnt mean people didnt do it you retard<br>Griffith didnt run around screaming I SUCK OLD MAN DICK he did it discreet, only Casca knew because she saw them.<br><br>Tl;dr you're an idiot</br></br></br></br>  <br> weebs in charge of knowing anything aside from chinese cartoons </br>  <br> it would be punishable by death. <br>Yes, and I'm sure weed being illegal in several states causes the police to instantly know when someone is getting high.<br><br>There's never been a gaydar that picks up every homosexual act. If you really think it would be that hard to cover up buttsex and cock gobbling, you are fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am sorry to disappoint you but at this point I'd be surprised if Guts even gets off the boat. Miura has obviously lost interest several years ago. People tend to get bored if they work on the exact same thing for decades.</br>  Casca can't hate Griffith. Even if she was raped, abused, betrayed. She can't hate him because she fucking understand that for Griffith, the end justifies the means.  <br>No. If she really can't hate Griffith, it is because she's a stupid and also very naive character. She has obsessed about him ever since he rescued her.</br>  <br> griffithfags </br>  <br> She has obsessed about him ever since he rescued her. <br>She loves him more than her life, more than anyone's life.

Goth loli confirmed for girl of the season  Anime Rory a shit  <br>Fuck off manga nerd</br>  <br>right. The show itself is kind of meh, but she has smugfu levels of show carrying potential. Her animated scene are nicely done as well. Very satisfying choreography.</br>  <br>Make me animeonlyshit</br>  <br>Have you ever been in a fight? Because i have.<br>Im pretty sure i could hit you so hard your mother would start bleeding.</br></br>  <br>The only good thing about the anime is Itami's VA, he does a superb job.<br><br>Everything else is off.</br></br></br>  So far the anime has been better than the manga. <br><br>I'm completely serious; the manga is objectively terrible pacing.</br></br>  Join today!  Manga &gt; anime.<br><br>It doesn't even matter what the anime may have done better. Fucking up Rory and Kuribayashi's designs is just too much.</br></br>  <br><br>No Fair!</br></br>  <br> better than the manga <br>So you don't mind butchering of characterisation due to censorship/cut scenes?<br><br> objectively terrible pacing <br>How? The manga did things like explain how the elf was in the well when they found her which the anime hasn't done yet. Also Spending 15 min on how otaku Itami is in the first ep was terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  gothic loli (rori?) saved the show  <br> butchering of characterisation due to censorship <br><br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>    <br>Her voice was the best part of the episode.</br>  <br><br>Same here OP. I watched these three today, and said fuck it and read all the manga.<br><br>While it still has a bit of a harem going on I really do enjoy  the fact the Military is still a strong giant force to not even be touched in their world. Like the premise of something existing that could actually take down the stationed Japan Military just doesn't exist. I wonder how the manga will end, setting up all these different things. I think the most recent chapters where they take down the Fire Dragon was pretty nice, especially with them flying in on the fighters and just demolishing everything. Generally if a character meets a hurdle in the manga and the military can't do anything it's for diplomatic and real reasons instead of some stupid anime tier reasoning. <br><br>But now that I read it all I'm kind of sad. Is there any manga/anime similar to this? Basically two worlds meeting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The they cut out things like how Rory and her goddess don't believe murder or even rape to be a sin just "human nature".</br>  <br><br> vlcsnap </br></br>  Help me, anons, I have become the lowest common denominator. I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime.<br><br><br>Well, there's Outbreak Company. The anime is really good but it's way more focused in politics and pacific relationship than the use of military.<br>There's really one episode where they BTFO a dragon and everyone gets impressed but it doesn't really affect the anime in any way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much the only things so far (it could still be inserted on Italica, though)., also in my opinion her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself Other than that they added a bit of characterization for both Itami and the female medic.</br>  I don't really mind things getting cut. It's easy to understand why they can't fit everything due to time constraints.<br><br>Besides, if I have read the source then all that nice background info is in my head already and I still understand. If I haven't read the source then I got something to look forward to if I decided I like it enough to go read.</br></br>  <br>I agree, i kinda wan't to drop it but i will give it a chance if it gets better.</br>  <br> could still be inserted on Italica <br>Hopefully they won't censer that battle and how she gets when near battles.<br> her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself <br>It just gives people an early idea of how she isn't just some simple goth loli who has a different sense of justice to normal. Anime only people may miss out on that point.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I know of Outbreak Company already. It was semi enjoyable. I feel the the MCs tendency to be a giant weeb and start teaching everybody "otaku" culture was a bit too much, but it wasn't terrible. It feels like these two are the only ones though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>How do I get me a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped?</br></br></br>  After seeing the first episode I thought this would be one of the best animes in a long time. But now it's quickly diven headfirst into a pile of mediocrity. It's like when you see a commercial for a delicious burger and then you try it and it tastes like the frozen burgers you get at safeway.  <br><br>Would No Game No Life suffice?<br><br>Not quite military vs. military action but definitely two worlds colliding in a way. Very good anime in general, either way.</br></br></br></br>   that bemused knowing look <br> diamonds <br><br>It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. The dragon was nowhere near as threatening as in the manga. Why do they do this shit?</br></br></br>  Why aren't they studying the sky?<br>They should research astrological stuff, like how much a year takes, if they are still on the milky way, no, if they have any similarities between the constellations and super-clusters.<br><br>If they two worlds are actually in the same universe it would be pretty fucking neat.</br></br></br>  <br> that bemused knowing look <br> "perhaps I have finally found the right group of men who can finally successfully rape me" </br></br>  <br> I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime. <br>ya, you're hopeless.</br></br>  <br> Japan <br>Better keep looking.</br></br>  Lips make every female character 10 time better<br><br>We need more lips in anime</br></br>  <br> lol those lovebirds, so hopeless! <br> meanwhile... <br> "can't wait to get back to my porn video tonight!" <br><br>Don't let your dreams be dreams, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already a thread, no need to make another one.</br>  <br> trying so hard to appear tough you start lying on the internet </br>  Same VA.<br><br>Yes</br></br>   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/<wbr>world/asia/japans-lower-house-passe<wbr>s-bills-giving-military-freer-hand-<wbr>to-fight.html?_r=0</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Coincidence?</br></br>  <br> Saki from Shinsekai Yori <br> Yukari from Yuyushiki <br> Ayaya from Kirino Mosaic <br>Is she going to be the new HanaKana?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not at all.

This show could definitely use more gore, because you know... Chinese cartoons with sex and gore are for mature adults like us. Right? <br><br>Anyway, I honestly don't mind that they toned it down for the show. I think that they are still covering the things that most deserve coverage.

The "blood and guts" added nothing, and was even a bit of a distraction.</br></br>  <br> It's miles better than the manga <br><br> Rory murders bandits with not a drop of blood in sight </br></br></br>  <br>Take off your /pol/ goggles dumbfuck, Abe's approval ratings take big hits from LDP voters as about much as any "librul" groups, it's pretty much across the board in Japanese society.</br>  <br>They have been, it mentions it later in the novel.

Over 100 would have to be the lower bound, right?</br></br>  <br>Necrophilia doesn't count, so she's still a virgin.</br>  <br>How old is she? I thought she was a few hundred years old, in which case 100 might not be enough.</br>  <br><br>900 years Anon. Even if she fucks somebody only once per month (yeah, right) the number is quite a bit higher than 100.</br></br>  <br><br>she's an Elf, she thinks that little sheet are her clothes now</br></br>  I thought she was telling him off in this scene. Don't Japs have a thing about showing your inner eyelid as being akin to sticking your tongue out?  <br>They do, but they also stick their tongues out while doing it.</br>  That scene was so much more dramatic in the manga  <br><br>The manga gives her the unexpected characterization of a girl who actually prefers long term relationships with interesting people.<br><br>Still, I bet it's quite a few.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that breast line thats not a smooth curve <br><br>Augh</br></br></br>    <br>Japanese people need more subtlety. Im sick of reading LNs and having the faggot of an author spend pages explaining minor details.<br><br>It's implicit from her being part of a religious cult and slaughtering people.<br><br><br>Blood and guts takes a fair bit out of budgets. This isn't the 90s either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The manga sure has ugly art.</br></br></br>  <br> a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped <br><br> men who can finally successfully rape me <br><br>Did I miss something here or does she actually want to get raped?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>She was acting like a semen demon the whole time.</br>  <br>It's just /a/nons screwing around</br>  <br>okay im convinced. going to horriblesubs now.</br>  The jeep scene needed more animation  <br>It's a good thing they fucking FINALLY introduced the girl characters in this piece of JSDF propaganda trash. This show was up until now failing my 3 ep test.</br>  <br>Did he kick her off, or did she just not like sitting on his "pistol"?</br>  How the fuck will they animate  the prince raping the bunny queen and dragging his sex slaves over the ground with chains on their necks and then getting completely beat up? <br><br>They can't leave that out since it will just ruin everything.</br></br>  <br>Too costly, it's easier to just loop the jeep shaking.</br>  <br>This is supposed to be wholesome nationalist propaganda. Not porn.</br>  <br> showing your inner eyelid <br>what?</br></br>  <br>Kicked her off, went back on, had some petty fighting and then settled for leaning on to him from the side.</br>    <br>Ah I'm silly. That makes sense.</br>  <br>That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well.

Because her family are aliens.</br></br>  <br>Also  Itami washing off Rory after her killing spree there. <br><br>I don't get why they went this way for the anime, doesn't fit the series at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well fuck it the anime's not gonna live up to the manga or LN any possible way so I may as well fuck around with edits to enjoy myself. Was planning on doing a side story following the adventures of bane and cia in this magic world if I felt like it or it was received well. <br><br><br>Pic related(resized for file limit) is 1st(or 2nd if I plan on editing the invasion) and the 2nd(3rd?) is the one I did earlier with cia standing in front of the jeep titled "Gate: Thus The CIA Crashed There!" Tell me what you think took like an hour to make the bane exploitable since apparently no one bothered to make one before. <br><br>Also manga Rory is better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The anime made me pick up the manga again after putting it on hold.<br>Currently around the 4th tank.<br>Is the princess added to Itami's harem?  looks like it from the garden party. <br>Same with brown elf right? hope so at least, even if we already know who's gonna win.</br></br></br>  Leilei a cute<br>That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though.</br>  <br> That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well. Continue for 900 years. <br>Well she only got 39 years left, so Itami is her last partner in this world.</br></br>  <br> That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though. <br>Most of it is</br></br>  <br> 720p </br>  <br> anime </br>  Blimey that .50 Cal was weak as shit<br>Sound design guys step yer game up</br>  <br> /a/ </br>  <br> Blimey </br>  <br>I'm not the only who think the anime art is a big improvement over the manga, right?<br>I like the manga but it's fucking ugly.</br></br>  <br> Not contrabanding your porn using fish <br>works everytime</br></br>  <br> contrabanding <br>You mean smuggling?</br></br>  <br>Yes, i do.</br>  <br>When you eat the porn to get rid of the evidence, it becomes contraband.</br>  <br>One more reason to dl shit instead of being a buyfag<br><br>lol "offensive to moral standards of reasonable adults".

They're a bunch of hypocrites.<br><br>They're not the good-willed, rational, egalitarian-minded people that are needed to weaken and ultimately destroy feminism, along with its bigotry, fear mongering, and double standards. Every time a red piller opens his mouth to speak on gender politics, it reinforces the idea in the minds of neutral observers that feminism is right and women are the victims.<br><br>"You're only as strong as your weakest link."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does this word even mean in Australia? When I see you guys writing things on the internet, I can only think that you speak a separate language than we do.</br>  <br>Will the Dark Elf waifu appear this season?</br>  <br><br>It means the same. Equate it to bitch in American English.</br></br>  I don't know what's more erotic.<br>The girls, the /ak/ porn, or a contemporary army wiping the fuck out of a stuck up and stubborn old one.</br>  <br> Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br><br> Sequel has started, don't know what happened in the interval but it seems like nobody has made babies with Itami yet. </br></br></br>  <br>No I'm just not a retard.</br>   Show sucks <br> /a/ loves it anyway because it has a cute girl in it  <br>Every time. You see the same thing on /v/ and /co/ as well. It's amazing how willing people on this site are to forgive bad quality in exchange for some T&amp;A.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't mean the same. In American English, "cunt" is one of the last, most sacred dirty words that we have yet to dilute through mass, common usage.</br>  <br>   Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br>Disgusting. But I guess expected from the country that has mastered unsatisfactory endings.<br> Is the sequel in form of LN or the standard Novel? Is it about him going back or dealing with stuff inside the gate? is he the only one? <br> Are these spoilers easily found in baka tsuki or something similar? </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It's really annoying how quickly people change their mind on a show just because of some cute girl and/or loli.</br></br></br>  <br>Show sucks in some areas but manages to do an alright job in others.<br>If you can ignore some plot elements, the nippon steel folded a thousand times propaganda, and other shit, it's an enjoyable dumb ride.<br>Although to be honest, I only expected /ak/ to watch it.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been having fun since the first ep</br>  <br> Not wanting assploding corpses. <br>Faggit.</br></br>  <br> I believe it's LN format. Just lurk around Gate discussion sites, like /a/ or Animesuki. Basically, Leilei figures out how to control Gate magic and they start opening Gates to try and find their way back to Japan and end up finding other alternate universes instead.    Bozes and Tomita have a kid though, so make of that what you will regarding Itami and his ever-growing harem. </br>  <br>did you miss the pol bait threads?</br>  <br>Why would that annoy you? Unless you base your own opinions on what /a/ thinks....?</br>  <br>I rather watch 1 mirrion Obama swordsmen than any redpilling /pol/ shit like oni-sama!</br>  <br>I don't know what /pol/ has to do with my comment, did you mean to reply to someone else?</br>  <br>The last part of your comment actually, back when the anime got announced, both /pol/ and /int/ fuckwards came in like rats, droving /ak/ away.</br>  <br>lmao<br>Can't find he panel from "Crecy" where the narrator mentions it's punctuation.</br></br>  <br>I don't follow vocal opinions on /a/ at all. (That's probably the worst thing to do).<br>But shit like this happens all the time, that's what I find annoying.</br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br> runaway censorship and indecency laws gone crazy <br> thought crime <br><br> Monster Musume <br> promoting race-mixing and possibly bestiality <br> immigration of animal-like races of "humans" into human nations <br><br> Gate <br> Japanese nationalism <br> JSDF/Japan Army promotional material because Japan wants the ability to wage war again <br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> promotes delusion-enabling (the girl is mentally ill, and instead of making her confront reality, they try to accommodate her delusion, letting her live that way) <br><br> Joukamachi no Dandelion <br> only royalty can rule over us because they have special powers that we don't have bluepill </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, it's annoying because it's common? Are you also annoyed by commonly occurring buyfag and loli threads? I don't think you understand your own opinion.</br>  <br>Actually I like it because I enjoy the idea of a civilized democratic country using obscenely advanced technology to teach backwards authoritarian regimes the errors of their ways. Rory is just the icing on the cake</br>  <br>She looks much better in manga.<br>Hat doesn't look like ears.</br></br>  Best Girl  <br> face slapping <br> banned in australia <br>Literally worse than UK</br></br></br>  <br> You will never see her again so enjoy her. </br>  <br>No, the best girl would be Shino. Unfortunately, the anime has no Shino.</br>  The BDs will have all the censored parts right?<br>I doubt because if they do the average episode would move up from 22~25 mins to 35~40 mins.</br>  <br>I know it's polbait but whatever:<br><br> Shimoneta <br>I like the commentary, especially with japan right now passing decency laws in light of the 2020 olympics.<br><br> Monster Musume <br> nothing wrong with race mixing if the races aren't retarded or disgusting, especially if they are delicious like rachnee <br> immigration isn't retarded if the countries can't hold a steady birthrate, blame white people being cucked and not having babies <br><br> Gate <br>It's retarded as fuck in that front, but they tend to be like that. They are still a cuck country no matter what they wish to be, so whatever.<br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br>Their priority is survival, if her facing reality makes the group be at risk (by her going into a panic attack and fucking up their safe area for example) then it's better to be conservative when making decisions such as that.<br><br> Dandelion <br>Power rules, if the population hasn't gone through revolution already it means they don't have the means to suppress them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's so sad that although she has good chemistry with Itami, she isn't in the running for Itami's dicking.<br>Cute as fuck.</br></br>  <br>What's annoying about it is the fact that it'll change in a instance and suddenly it's the new meme opinion. It's a really 'sigh and roll you eyes' moment.<br><br>As for those threads they can be filtered, I sometimes poke around the buyfag treads anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> the fact that it'll change in a instance and suddenly it's the new meme opinion. <br>Again, why does this inconvenience you?</br></br>  <br>Fuck you nigga, Elf best girl.</br>  Anyone else boiled with rage when  the prince mentioned the japanese slave? <br> Fuck, I just wanted the jsdf to deploy without mercy upon their ass. </br>  <br>She will appear again to deal with  monster prostitutes  and  Tuka's trauma , then when she and the rest of the squad disappear from the spotlight.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Great. Another anime to watch.<br><br>God fucking damn it.<br><br> How's the backlog? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By how much is being censored i doubt we will see her in the  prostitue saving  and she only was for some pages in the  trauma .</br>  <br>Try asking any American.</br>  anyone else thought those two female squad members looked like grown up versions of naru and hina?  <br>kekd and saved</br>  <br>They surely will be more similar to hostess, being seductive and all but not showing her nipples like the manga. About the other thing this episode made me feel the director has a soft for her so she should at least have a decent appearance secured (not that they'll give her more than a couple of minutes, obviously).</br>  <br> Why does inconvenience you? <br>I think you're mistaken, I've just grown sick of the same cycle. It doesn't overly 'inconvenience' at all. Surely you'd rather see a nice mix of opinions about something rather than a bunch of similar opinions that gives the impression that everyone is thinking the same?</br></br>  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Here's the executable I made if anybody wants to play around with it.</br>  <br>You are this  Faggot, aren't you? <br> All depictions of violence are edgy hurr </br></br>  <br>I agree but when you say the anime anything is better than the manga on /a/ people start having aspie breakdowns.</br>  <br>Not him (and not that it matters), but the violence itself is not edgy, the edgy are the babies who believe that the series is worse just because there's not rape and guts.</br>  I was considering dropping it but the goth loli kind of peaked my interest a little.    <br>Remember /a/non, anime is for entertainment. If you start going OCD, just fucking drop some shit, it's not a fucking job</br>  <br> peaked my interest </br>  <br>961 years old.</br>  <br>So Australia has a giant warehouse of offensive and immoral content they have stolen.</br>  <br>Oops meant<br/></br>  <br> tfw they censored Rory's breasts. <br> mfw this is the result of the retarded pointless morafag law about depictions of naked DRAWN children being illegal <br> mfw it doesn't even matter she's the oldest member of the entire fucking cast </br></br></br>  Haha you guys are so easily pandered by cute girls.  <br>It's being "studied" by top men.</br>  <br>It directly impacts on the severity of the narrative. I didn't even feel real when the dragon's arm was cut off, let alone when her fuckhuge axe was slicing goons to pieces with nary a blood splatter. It will likely omit the 'we might have to give them out bodies' scene, and if they keep this shit up, the prince scene and consequential beating will also have no impact. The violence and rape is hardly hamfisted in GATE as it is in other shows, and to omit it adds nothing and only takes away.</br>  <br>I wonder if that warehouse actually exists. Imagine how box castles you could make in that fucking place. The 8yr old in me is getting shivers</br>  <br>My dick knows what it likes.</br>  <br> this <br><br>When Rory goes medieval on those guys, you know it's for a good fucking reason in the manga</br></br></br>  <br>No but i cant resist girls in military uniforms, my only weakness</br>  <br>Damn, man. You gonna cut someone with all that edge!<br>Go get wasted or something.</br></br>  <br>I had a feeling it was wrong, I'm so sorry anon I know I'm a failure ;_;</br>  Why is the opening so shitty.  <br/>  <br> Edge <br>...what? What exactly was edgy about that post?<br><br><br> And now we proceed to never get a rational reply </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone needs the gore to understand the severity of the situation depicted, but to each his own.<br><br><br>We already knew they were murderers. The dead raped bodies are nothing but shock value.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Every country has one.<br>Most of that shit gets destroyed in a timely manner.<br><br><br>I wonder how someone as young as you cannot comprehend the world he lives in. Children are supposed to be fast to adapt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gore <br> Michael Bay </br></br>  <br>You shouldn't have to "understand the severity", it should be immediately apparent to you. If you're relying on the audience to piece together the scene and mood, you're a fucking failure of a writer.</br>  <br> Most of that shit gets destroyed in a timely manner. <br>Except in the UK it seems, where heads in the gov are apparently mayor players in the pedo market.</br></br>  <br>Gotta start a twin thread for this type of thing that starts every new episode. Call it Gate Bane and friends editors or something.</br>  <br>We have a temporary storage area in Adelaide where confiscated goods are held for about a month if things are wrongly taken but at the end of that time everything is burned at the local CBC mill</br>  <br>Isnt michael bay obssesed with dick mutilation?</br>  <br> censorship <br> good <br><br>Pick one, retard</br></br></br></br>    <br>When we capture shit like this in Eastern Europe - Russian pedo underground flicks mostly - they destroy that as fast as possible. Some times in front of the TV crews on site.<br><br>I wonder what will happen when we get thought crime laws like in the West, some pedo might get his lolishit sliced up on camera.<br><br>I'd personally laugh my ass off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're just nitpicking at words. Who said that such "understatement" was a long process devoid of responsibility from the author. Good lord.<br><br> Not everyone needs the gore to see the severity of the situation <br><br>There, happy?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> "Yo bruh, the manga is edgy as fuck." <br> "How so?" <br> "It has blood and corpses." <br> "Many animes and movies have blood and corpses." <br> "Only Michael Bay movies and animes do, fuck off." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No that's RoboCop.</br>  <br>The problem with thought crimes is that they always seem far away from you until you're being the group being targeted.<br>So while it would be funny entertaining to see pedos get their dick chopped on tv, it stops being funny when let's say... one can't watch hentai, or gets 10 years in prison for watching anime.<br>Also, I'm a bit of a conservative myself, but let's say the far left goes into power... then I'd fall out of favour and get fucked in the ass for not supporting leftist propaganda.<br>Not cool, but I don't know what first world countries are safe from being en route to thought control.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Yo bruh, the manga is edgy as fuck." <br> "How so?" <br> "It has fucking Yellow Eyes, Red Dragon." <br> "W-Wha-" <br> "YELLOW EYES, RED FUCKING DRAGON" </br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't know who the JSDF chick with long black hair is meant to be.  <br> Who said that such "understatement" was a long process devoid of responsibility from the author. <br>Now who's nitpicking. This is anime, there's no 'long process' to understand anything. That said, the author is most definitely passing the responsibility onto the responder. <br><br> Not everyone needs the gore to see the severity of the situation <br>Have you even read the manga? The tone is vastly, vastly different to the anime. It's like if the manga were MA15 the anime is trying to get a PG adaption going, and it's just fucking stupid. Face it, that kind of gore goes hand in hand with GATE. It's all about modern weaponry meets asshole-roman medieval fantasy, and the result is messy as fuck. Cleaning it doesn't just do nothing for it, it actively harms the adaption. <br><br><br>The tall beauty in his squad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First aid? the "nurse" of the team. Sarcastic, has like 3 lines in total, sadly.</br>  <br>Kurosawa, the medic chick, elfs best friend</br>  <br> I wonder how someone as young as you cannot comprehend the world he lives in. Children are supposed to be fast to adapt. <br>What is that supposed to mean?</br></br>  <br> animes </br>   comfy GATE thread with no shitposting or excessive complaining about anime secondaries <br>What universe am I in?</br>  <br>Nah, it's still funny.<br>We already had a thought police once in this part of the continent, you know? <br><br>I'm pretty sure leftism will come back and in force. It's inevitable. And then the robots will kill us all.<br><br>~Good end~</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a joke.  Nice trips. </br>  <br>Gate threads are like that actually. Not much controversy except for the anime pussyfying the manga</br>  <br> Now who's nitpicking. <br>Not sure, but sure you're contradicting yourself (or the other guy if there's such). Why are you saying that passing the responsibility to the responder cannot be avoided when you previously said that such thing makes you a failure as a writer. And how can the audience piece together the scene and mood if everything is immediate.<br><br> Have you even read the manga? The tone is vastly, vastly different to the anime. <br>Of course it is. It relies vastly in shock value and usually fails at portraying any other type of scenes, making them forgettable. THAT is being a failure as a writer/author.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Michael Bay treatment. <br>Uh, it did get PG13'd</br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure leftism will come back and in force. <br>With the recent development in Greece I doubt that. Many consider it a failure of the left.</br></br>  <br><br>Improved version</br></br>  <br> Now who's nitpicking. <br>Its not nitpicking when you have this much to select from.<br><br> Select food <br> select dog and meat <br> Captcha passes </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What am I reading.</br>  <br>oh god just stop<br><br>if your shitposting it isnt funny and if you're serious its just fucking cringeworthy</br></br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Precedence is a major concept in the law system, which in turn makes the law very prone to the snowball effect. Furthermore, the law is an ax, not a scalpel. It's not good for only picking off one very specific case that people don't like.<br><br>The minute that you see something in the law that belongs to a general concept that's outright dystopian in nature (such as producing or possessing something that offends someone else being a prosecutable offense, simply because someone is offended), you need to chop the head off of the snake before it has a chance to grow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't illegal because it offends someone anon, it's because kids by definition have to be abused to make it. As far as drawings/animu are concerned, banning that or not is not exclusive to either right or left.</br>  <br><br>That's both wrong and retarded. I could draw a picture right now and say that it's a naked 10 year old.

I ordered a mug and a key chain, and didn't hear anything from them for two weeks. I sent an email and asked what was up, and they said the key chain wasn't in stock and they were ordering it. A week later they said they couldn't get the key chain and refunded me for the key chain and extra shipping cost, then they expedited the shipping on the mug for free and got it to me the next day.</br>  <br>Instant buy</br>    <br> outrageous pricin <br>I noticed this. Definitely a last resort then.</br></br>  <br><br>That's actually weird I mean, yeah, bad on them for selling something that they didn't had on stock (or that went down just as you order it) but shipping you the rest for free and fast is really awesome actually.</br></br>  post shit you've ordered entirely on dick motive.  <br>Not great, but one of the best so far, which is saying a lot.</br>  <br>I need that ass in my life.</br>  <br> brown <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>They didn't ship it for free, but they did upgrade the shipping from the standard 2 week type shipping to 1-day shipping for free. They also responded very quickly when I messaged them about the delay. It was a bit annoying that they delayed the order originally with no explanation, but I'd say they made up for it. I'd use them again.</br>    Why is God Eater 2 - Ciel Alencon so much more expensive than anything else in the series?<br>Is it because Good Smile Co just churns out money?</br>  <br>what's wrong with you?</br>    <br>try comparing it to any one of those other scales</br>  <br>He's just gay, anon. Leave him be.</br>  <br> shit taste  <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br><br>1- She's easily the best God Eater scale. <br>2- Retards thought that she was going to bin for the high price but they forgot that she was damn popular in Jap. That means there's not many people who have her but a lot who want her.

I can't stand TLR honestly.</br>  <br>Looks like an Angela Knockoff</br>  <br>You call that pancake ass good?</br>  <br><br>99% of the figures "bin" a few weeks/one two months after release, almost no exceptions, because stores are trying to free as much space as they can, is after that period when some skyrocket, only exclusives go up in price right on release.</br></br>  <br>That being the case, I suppose I'll need both of those asses.</br>  <br>Not really, there are plenty of figures that never go below the original selling price subclauses they are sold out on mere preorders, also, the fact that exclusives+Limited exist make your statistic a joke.</br>  Any reason why the Kotobukiya Ika Musume fig is going for so cheap on amazon? is there something wrong with it? because MKC says nothing about there being any bootlegs.

I can't wait!  I ended up watching this series without seeing the original Haruhi version or the movie until 2 weeks ago.<br><br>I have to say I ended up hating Haruhi in her own series. Spoiled cunt.</br></br>  i thought they ended this after season 1. The endless eight sucked. Thats what made the show shit. Haurhi should have remembered she was god and ruined everything.  Where the fuck are muh subs?!  <br>subs  never </br>  <br>How could we allow Horrible Subs to do this to us?</br>  <br><br> I have to say I ended up hating Haruhi in her own series. Spoiled cunt. <br><br>A lot of people did, myself included. I never felt she was MC though, she's like a prop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not Horrible Subs (at least I don't think it is) it's Funimation. They haven't posted the new episode yet either. <br><br>If there's a problem, then that's okay as long as they say that they're working on it, but so far I don't know anything.</br></br></br>  Just watched raw. I liked this episode, and my favorite moment was when Itsumo no Fuukei started playing.<br>Still waiting subs, still waiting S3, but it was a fun ride.</br>  <br> she's like a prop <br>That's more generous than me. I considered her the villain.</br></br>  <br>Definitely not HorribleSubs' fault, they just yank whatever is on crunchyroll, so it's whoever makes those subs who is to blame for this delay.<br><br>And last week's delay</br></br></br>  <br> It's one of my favorites from spring. </br>  <br><br><br>I  like  Haruhi</br></br></br>  SUBS WHEREEEEE  <br><br>Yeah, the episode wasn't even up on Funimation's site the last I checked, so HS can't deliver because they don't have it.</br></br>  <br>yeah, but they're getting this show from Funi.<br>Funi hasn't posted it yet, therefore HS doesn't have it yet.</br></br>  <br>T H I S<br>H I S <br>I S<br>S</br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part is that even if funimation releases the episode, it will take some time for horriblesubs to rip it because it has to be done manually.</br>  Well I guess I'll check back tomorrow then.  <br>I  love  Haruhi.</br>  <br>Asakura might not be best girl (pic related) but surely she is best waifu</br>  <br><br><br>ITT people who haven't read the LNs and likely watched the original in broadcast order.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's me alright. I don't hate Haruhi, but she's not my favorite character in the original series (that I watched in broadcast order).</br>  What's with no sub this late?  <br>a lot of Asakura and Tsuruya appearance that make me keep watching this show</br>  <br>I know of someone that has read them and dislikes her quite a bit. <br>That doesn't stop me from gushing over her whenever we talk about the series.</br></br>  <br><br>Sir I may not agree with your choice but I sure as hell respect it.</br></br>  Fuck this, I wanted to finish this shit today and pretend it never existed.   1080p out <br>It's time.</br>  ITS OUT  <br>KITAAAAAAAAA<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K6y<wbr>4EPDtuRc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  That firework scene had me really confused in the RAW. Glad subs finally showed up though. I really enjoyed how this ended.  KYON-KUN DENWA  <br>Why does she sit like that?</br>  <br>May as well wait for Lemon. They normally finish in like an hour or two anyways.</br>  <br>maybe her butt hurts</br>  <br>FROM WHAT?!</br>    nyoron~  webm requests?  EH, NANDATTE?  <br>The first scene with the fireworks if you wouldn't mind. I've been too lazy to make them myself.</br>  So the other Yuki comes back for just a moment just to hear his confession, it's alittle weird but I'm okay with this.  <br>It's a bit more like she was still there, in some aspect, and he was talking though yuki-chan to the other yuki for just a moment.</br>  So what's the OVA gunna be? Place your bets.  mfw  Haruhi lost   SOON  had no idea was last episode; watch l8r  <br>DENWA</br>  <br>rendering now</br>  NANIKA OKASHII  <br>KYON-KUN DENWA</br>   Bouken desho desho   Shit show.
