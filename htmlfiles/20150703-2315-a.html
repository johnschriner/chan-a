I also did the knife design. I was asked not to make it too threatening.”<br><br>そして志貴を描いたのは俺じゃねー。おされメガネになったのも俺のせいじゃ<wbr>ねー。塗っただけじゃー。ナイフのデザインはワシがやりました。ドスになら<wbr>ないように、というオーダー。</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> I also did the knife design <br>Fuck him.</br></br>  wow nice shirou with bangs it goes great with the homura we have  <br>I miss the pear peeler already.</br>  <br>He looks fine, it have been too long since I played the game, did he look super edgy or what? Why are people crying now? I guess Arc's skirt was fixed to the proper version at least?</br>  <br>Koyama doesn't like the new glasses, huh?</br>  <br>That was Shiki's hair originally, trip.<br>I can't believe that people are in a roundabout way admitting that Shirou has Shiki's hair now after denying it all these years.<br><br>Yes, it's Shiki's hair.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Don’t blame me for the black-rimmed glasses either <br>Does this mean there has been sizable backlash against the new design by the Nips?</br></br>  <br>He looked like a generic otaku protag of late 90s, now he looks like a generic otaku protag of 2015.</br>  <br>Tsukihime's old designs were ugly as fuck, people are just nostalgiafagging.<br><br>I also think he's fine.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Shirou has much shorter forelocks and his spikes are smaller but bigger in number. And for some reason he's often drawn with small a center split like Rin these days.</br>  <br>Well it's Shirou's now the way that Arc is a Saber<br>Needs more blue and orange shirts for this shit to be palpable</br></br>  <br>He's too fluffy and cutesy. Should've kept the older smoother hairstyle, since Shirou has already become the fluffball in recent years.</br>  <br>Where is the engraving on the new knife?</br>  <br> people are just nostalgiafagging. <br>Pretty much, especially about Arc.</br></br>  <br>You're just Saberfagging.</br>  <br>Shirou had the hair he's drawn with these days already in HF epilogue.</br>  <br>She looked fine outside the skirt, so no big deal Id say, if they fix that Im happy.</br>   Don't blame me for it. <br><br>At least the artists know the new designs are shit.</br></br>  <br> I was asked not to make it too threatening.” <br><br>Knives are meant to look threatening though.<br><br>Even a steak knife looks more threatening than the knife Koyama drew.<br><br>Fuck him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Knives are meant to look threatening though. <br>Not fruit knives.</br></br>  <br>https://www.google.com/search?q=fru<wbr>it+knives&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X<wbr>&amp;ei=vSSWVbb5AYWaNrXJgLgI&amp;ved=0CAgQ_<wbr>AUoAg</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>Remakefags blown the fuck out.<br><br>The new designs are shit.<br><br>Not like it will come out before the Japanese Olympics, anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the whole point of the knife to be as ordinary and useless as possible just to emphasize Shiki's eyes?</br>    <br>Does this mean that they aknowledge the complaints this new design has arised?</br>    <br>Just give her the dress-like long skirt and Im good, looks very good in the end.</br>      <br>The knife is not supposed to look like something that will slit your throat just by looking at it. It's supposed to look harmless. Shiki could cut you with a ruler if he wanted to.</br>  <br> looks very good in the end even though it looks like shit  <br>She only has one hair vent for chrissakes</br></br>  <br>The skirt is cute. Definitely better than the grandma skirt.</br>  <br>The problem that Arc's current design is pretty generic and boring. The long flowing skirt worked well with the idea of her being a princess. The air intakes looked really good once Takeuchi refined his art, so removing them just doesn't make sense.</br>    <br>She looks gorgeous, she was always better than Saber but now she's even more so. <br>Red hair, blue eyes. I want to marry her</br></br>  <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>It's a fruit knife, nigga. Making it look threatening is stupid.</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm saving this all, thanks anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Will she have the chance to be a main heroine now?</br>  <br>Too freaking cute.</br>  <br>Yes. <br><br>Nasu always wanted her route and it's a whole new route + cool cgs and whatnot is a great way of selling the remake.</br></br></br>      <br>LONG SKIRT<br>LONG SKIRT<br>LONG SKIRT<br><br>WHERE IS IT?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The hair is literally the Nanaya hairstyle from Melty Blood. Even the face is a Nanaya copy.<br><br>The hair in the original was still very short and unlike what it is now, unless you're talking about the Realta Nua version, which was just the hair becoming far more Shiki-like than the original.</br></br></br>    <br>Okay but can you tell me who it is supposed to be?</br>  WHY IS TAKEUCHI TURNING THEM INTO RHINOS?  <br>Takeuchi does it again. <br><br>The man makes good cakes and maids, what can I say?</br></br></br>  <br>Thankfully, not everyone has nostalgia goggles stapled to their forehead.</br>  <br> DLC </br>    <br>Ciel is supposed to look plain like this.

What makes you think that?</br>  <br> Worse than Greed Island! </br>  Nostalgiafags would have complained no matter what just because it's different.<br>This is no different from /co/ trolls who think batman should still wear his underwear outside his pants.</br>  <br>The reason why the Nanayas are perfect killers is because they give off no killing intent.

This isn't just a problem of nostalgia, people are complaining about some genuinely bad design choices made for the sake of modernization.</br>  <br>No, would probably have to be (True), not Fake</br>  <br> were ugly as fuck <br>They were just dated, you need to chill.</br></br>  <br>Other way around, Emiya have True.</br>    Will have full voice or will be another visual novel stuck in the stone age like Mahoyo?  <br>CONGRATULATIONS NASU, YOU LITERALLY KILLED LEN.</br>    <br>Will probably have considering Mahoyo made a mistake in that.<br><br>Not that I mind if it doesn't since I read faster than the voices and just find myself cutting them halfway in dialogue but yeah, it'll have seiyuus.</br></br></br>  <br>slut-sensei</br>  <br>Don't worry, she'll just drink blood or feed on dreams or some dumb shit.</br>  <br>God damn it why is it misnamed<br><br><br>There's no way it'll be like Mahoyo, unless they hate money and success</br></br></br></br>  <br>Akiha is a goddess</br>  <br>She looks pretty pure actually, not a slutty one-san vibe. <br><br> mfw she gets a route instead of Sacchin </br></br></br>  <br>I am extremely disturbed now that I have realized that the Lens are not in Fate/loliservice<br>I mean it's Fateshit yes but come on</br></br>  <br>Maybe she'll have a sub route that'll end in a bad end or something.</br>  <br>It isn't, Nasu even commented about that and what he imply with that is self-explanatory.</br>  <br><br>Source</br></br>  <br>All TM VNs are all ages now. Sells more. <br><br>They'll probably release some time later an 18+ one like they did with RN last year</br></br></br>  <br>Source? there's no way Nasu is this retarded right?  right? </br>  <br>In Japan that just means 'less than four scat-guro rape snuff sequences'.</br>  <br><br>Is it supposed to be a butterfly knife now? Butterfly knives are cool.</br></br>  <br><br>An assumption is not a source.</br></br>   there wasn't a Tsukihime/KnK game on the DS where you trace death lines with the stylus <br><br>literally why?</br></br>  <br>Q: What is the difference between Eye of the Mind True and False?<br><br>A: "True" is the insight and perception gained through training. If a human were to have the "Eye of the Mind" skill, its true mechanism of action then is not sixth sense but accumulation of experience. As a result, it is designated as "True". "False" of course is the opposite. It is the "perception and resolution of the current situation" through the sixth sense. "False" is something that can never be achieved through training or experience. Really, the former should be "False" and the later should be "True". However, I hope you can discern my intention in this reversal.</br></br></br>  <br>They should promote Koyama ahead of Takeuchi. He has always been better anyway.</br>    <br><br>She looks wonderful in her new uniform too.</br></br>      <br>You're not very good at this are you?</br>  <br>I do the same and eventually turn the voices off. Cutting them off every time for annoying.</br>  <br>Like Muv-Luv? Fuck Japan and its anti-cake sentiments.</br>  What happened to that guy scanlating the Mahoyo colored manga? Anyone remember?  <br>I actually think she'll be one of the DAA or something just because.</br>  <br>Nigger, if you want to clean it up, go ahead.</br>  <br>Koyama has his own big flaws.</br>  <br>Then why don't you do it fag?</br>  <br>He doesn't draw rhinos, that's fine by me. <br>He's really good actually, much better than what Takeuchi is now</br></br>  <br>Why is he typing like a delinquent?</br>  <br> promoting your boss </br>  There's way too much black in these redesigns. It flattens everything.  <br> no hair intakes <br>I miss Arc already.</br></br>  <br>I feel like she'll take Sacchin's place in the Dark Side route if Shiki goes down Sacchin's route.  i.e. get murdered. </br>  <br>Or she's just a teacher to make it feel like they go to class, a character like Taiga maybe. <br>She doesn't have to be relevant you know</br></br>  Anyone want to play Melty Blood?  <br>I actually like the new Shiki more than the old Shiki, but I mostly prefer the old Arc design to the new one. It isn't nostalgia.</br>  <br>Fuck. <br><br>I didn't know I wanted this. That game would be sweet. <br><br> Make it KnK so that they don't have to have so many unique characters to make.  <br> Add in some cameos.  <br> Make Aoko the final boss/secret unlockable character.  <br> Satsujinki as the Secret Boss who can cut lines like Shiki can with a 100% accuracy rate.  <br><br>That'd be sweet. Make it multiplayer or have some form of support system going so if you were playing Ryougi, you could have Ayaka pop up on screen to combust some heads in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that secret character <br>Well, he's not secret anymore.</br></br>  <br>I think Shiki's new glasses are too thick. I liked the wireframes more.</br>    I just want a KnK game with narrative of Ryougi's inner sexual frustration.  <br>Because touchscreen phones are better.</br>  <br>H-Here</br>  <br>so sad, sacchin</br>  <br>Mikiya walks into the room with ice cream. What do you do?<br><br> MEoDP his belt, maybe he'll get the hint <br> Stay stoic, Cocteau is a master at romance obviously. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's an otf's knife.</br>  <br> He doesn't draw rhinos, that's fine by me. <br>Yes he does. Koyama actually has a lot more problems with noses and facial features than Takeuchi. He also tends to fuck up anatomy and head proportions no less than Takeuchi. Another problem he has is that he draws all busty women with the exact same body and half of the time draws breasts as either helium-filled balloons or sagging sacks of sand.<br><br>Wat Koyama has going for him is better coloring and visual depth. Otherwise, he's not much better than Takeuchi from a technical standpoint.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Don’t blame me for the black-rimmed glasses either <br>surely they can't be that bad<br> click picture <br>ALL I SEE ARE GLASSES AND I HATE THEM<br> <br>knife looks like a shitty butterfly/switchblade bastard child too</br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> remember no more long skirt <br>I PLATINUM MAD</br></br>  <br>Between that and Prisma Illya's Shirou it's like TM protags are turning fluffy.<br> Fluffy Ryougi when </br></br>  <br><br><br>The knife are kinda hit and miss.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mDI<wbr>QSOmzxQM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd take fluffy over generic VN protag hairdo any day.</br>  <br> Don't blame me <br><br>He looks fucking amazing though</br></br></br>  <br>Miss his original "iron rod" knife. Just a flat rectangular bar of metal. Simple and extremely sexy for it.</br>  <br>Yeah, in Shiki's case it's only nostalgia faggots having a fit of HE LOOKS DIFFERENT.<br>The only shitty change for the remake so far is Arc's skirt. I don't even want granny skirt back but fuck, this is way too short, did all that CCC bullshit got to their heads?</br></br>    <br>What the fuck is with this short skirt complaint. Have you guys ever been exposed to Japanese media before?</br>  <br>she aint some 13 year old whore and  it totally clashes with the rest of her outfit </br>  Just threw together a very (very) rough mockup of what vermillion akiha might look like         short skirt <br>JUST</br>  <br>Takeuchi already confirmed 18+ "due to violence".</br>          I hope new Ciel gets sick tats      <br>Still perflat, just the way I love her.</br>  <br>The tats always felt weird to me.</br>      <br><br>It's actually body paint.</br></br>              I wonder which set of designs the majority will use in Tsukihime doujinshi from now on. Personally, I wouldn't mixing and matching, even though it be weird at first.            <br>It's not like Shiki's really different. It's the exact same design barring the thicker glasses, he's just drawn with fluffier hair.<br>And the girls will be naked anyway.</br></br>     ShingeTSUtan <br> It's actually pronounced Shingettan </br>    <br> It's not like Shiki's really different.  <br><br>He looks less dorky now.</br></br></br>    Guys, what if Shirou is Shiki and Aoko's son? <br> She went back in time and seduced Shiki when he was like 9, not realizing that his H game protagonist sperm was strong even then. So she just jumped forward in time 9 months and dropped Shirou off at an orphanage. <br>That would explain their likeness, Shirou's Magic Circuits and Origin!</br></br>  <br>If this ends up being an eroge I can pretend she's Homura.</br>  <br>It doesn't look good with the sweater and boots. Also, the skirt also played a big role in keeping Arc's age ambiguous. The new design makes her look like a typical schoolgirl, while the old one made her look like a young woman, which went well with her being a centuries old vampire.</br>    <br>nope, no necklace at all.</br>      <br/>    <br>thank you</br>  <br><br>The knife had always been retractable you fags. Go back and actually read Tsukihime. sage</br></br>   bitching about one fucking knife <br>Seriously, guys. How much further must you guys challenge the limits of autism?</br>    <br>One of the complaints I remember hearing about the Tsukihime anime is that they changed the knife from the "chunk of metal" fruit knife to some kind of switchblade. So it's not like it's a new complaint or anything.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Who designed the backgrounds? Takeuchi?</br></br></br></br>  <br> have to walk home <br> get home <br> have to walk another mile to get to your house <br><br>No wonder having maids greet you at the gate is a customary service.</br></br></br></br></br>  It'll be 10/10 as long as there is a Sacchin route  "Oh, not at all. I merely wondered for a moment."<br>...... Like I said, you do wonder what's inside.<br>"Alright, let's open it. One, two... three!"<br>With a dry sound, the wooden box opens.<br>Inside, there is----a ten-centimeter bar of thin iron.<br><br>"...... It's... an iron bar."<br>Undecorated and worn, it has finger marks all over it.<br>...... The old man must have really hated me to leave me a piece of junk like this.<br><br>"No, Shiki-san. It's a fruit knife."<br>Kohaku-san takes the iron bar out of the box.<br>"See, isn't it one of those folding knifes? One, two... three!"<br>With a "pachink!", a ten centimeter blade pops out from the bar.<br>...... I see, it certainly is a knife.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>only thing I don't like is how Shiki's legs sort of just stick out from his school jacket. It's like they forgot to draw his pelvis</br>  <br>Heh, reminds me of that gag in Hayate no Gotoku where Hayate spends a good amount of time cycling just to get out of the mansion.</br>  <br><br> I like em. </br></br>  <br>The arm is also stiff as fuck. But, that's jsut a problem of that particular drawing.

She is cute, fit, easygoing and down to earth, and funny. The other Keions are great too, but the rest of them have more negatives than Ritsu does when looking at them as potential wives. Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. Ritsu may be lazy but she is nowhere near as bad as Yui is. Ritsu could be reasoned with and taught to do things. Yui would just forget to do everything I told her to do. Mio and Mugi will both get fat once their metabolism slows down in their early-mid 20s. Many would think that Mugi being rich would be a huge positive for her, but to me it isn't. Even though she would be kind about it, she would always expect more than what I could provide for her on my own. I also would not want to leech off of her family's money. Mio's personality is adorable but overall I prefer Ritsu's. Ritsu is just more interesting to me. Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. I don't want to deal with her tsundere bullshit for 60 years. Jun is a fucking shit. She deserves no explanation beyond that. Ton-chan would be a better wife than Jun would be."<br>-Anonymous</br>  <br>Sure thing, right after you off yourself because you realize that even if she existed in this dimension she'd be sleeping in the bed of a slightly older woman and not a fat moefuck like you.</br>  <br>She doesn't know me Anon, she doesn't know either of us.<br>But I live my whole life for the moment when I can finally tell her I love her, even if that moment may never come.</br></br>  <br>Our day will come Anon.</br>  <br>Maybe  in death </br>  <br>Nope. Only Hell awaits.</br>  <br>I always picture her like a animal in the bed, crazy sex for sure<br><br><br><br>Exactly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that's not a good thing. It sounds interesting, which is why so many men agree to take her on at least one date. However the end result is always the same.</br>  <br>I tried to watch K-on, but failed to like it.<br>Based on all the doujins I've fapped to, I'd say.<br><br>Asuza &gt; Yui &gt; Ritsu &gt; Mio &gt; Mugi<br>Of those listed anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love Mio!</br>  <br> tanned Azusa </br>  <br>Yes, you little bitch.</br>  <br>wow they all look like shit</br>  <br>I wish to sexually dominate Mio!</br>  <br>Azusa is the only one who can look good tan and pale</br>  <br>FUCK <br>OFF</br></br>  <br>Stop</br>  <br>Real fuckin disgusting.</br>  <br>She is very civilized in public so I can't complain.<br>Plus as a bonus, you get to meet the band on special occasions as well.<br>I'd say I could live with it.</br></br></br>  <br> However the end result is always the same. <br><br>Men take her on dates because as an ex-rock chick they think she'll be easy to get into bed.<br><br>When they find she's looking for more than just a quick lay, they lose interest.<br><br>Men are animals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The end result is always the same.</br>  <br> I tried to watch K-on, but failed to like it. Based on all the doujins I've fapped to... <br>fucking disgusting</br></br>  <br><br>I remember seeing this one now.</br></br>  <br> I tried to watch K-on, but failed to like it. *Based on all the doujins I've fapped to*, I'd say. <br>That's a kind of cancer I haven't seen in a while.</br></br>  <br> that picture <br>fucken saved</br></br>  <br> Mio is the best <br> Mugi is the best <br> Ritsu is the best <br> Asuza is alright l think <br>Correct<br><br> Yui is the best <br>Wrong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's an even darker one, but I forgot to save it. Nice to giggle at how extreme it goes. </br>  <br>ya mad?</br>  <br> tar queen </br>  <br>So you've never been to a K-On thread before? Mio is the unquestionable most popular girl. Hell, she's so popular she's become the face of waifuism.</br>  <br>kind of, yes.<br>I don't mind lewds, but I really hate those poorly drawn ones.<br> especially when the one drawn is my waifu </br></br></br>  <br>She's the most popular on 4chan, Azusa is slightly more popular overall</br>  <br/>  <br><br>It doesn't matter what other men have done.<br>I mean sure I'd wanna bang her but that doesn't mean I wouldn't want an actual relationship.<br>Ahh what does it even matter, I can never prove any of it anyway  ;_; </br></br></br></br>    <br>I've always had the impression Mio and Azusa were the most popular in Japan but amongst Americans on 4chan Ritsu was the most popular.</br>  <br>Riiiight.<br>So few responses, and primarily Ritsufags.</br></br>  <br>how's that damage control?</br>  <br>Someone make a new one of these but make reasons for answers mandatory</br>  <br>Damage control the archive, guy.</br>  <br>most of the answers were meme shit\<br>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/193<wbr>AvGTbrXZ-4UgCjUUJh0LuIC_VDkXFP-Y084<wbr>DZjPJ0/viewanalytics?usp=already_re<wbr>sponded</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>http://strawpoll.me/4812666</br>  <br>Good luck™.</br>  <br> proxypoll <br>yeah, no</br></br>  <br>And so it is settled, for all time.

Someone who is better at moon please correct/clarify. Because based on the context, that's how it looks like to me.

There's nothing wrong with it, people draw other peoples' waifus all the time.</br>  Requesting any female character wearing this hat.  Requesting Carol drawn in the style of ZUN.<br><br>(repost from last thread since I posted right before it died)</br></br>  Requesting Rena Ryuugu nude or semi-nude while on top of the viewer with her having crazy eyes and optionally having her cleaver.  <br>With<br><br> or<br/></br></br></br>  Was  meant for  ?  <br>Oh I didn't think of BRS. That contrast would be cute.</br>  Requesting a parody/or something similar to the image on top with Haruhi, Kyon and Sasaki. Sasaki as the childhood friend, who ultimately loses to Haruhi.  <br>Mirai</br>  <br>I will make it my mission to poorly draw every one of mishafags harem so he can't rerequest this weekend</br>  Requesting a drawing of the average poster in a loli thread.  Requesting Ryouko (Left) or Megumi (Middle) in a wedding dress looking towards the viewer.  <br>He doesn't care about any of them, you could put that time into trying to make something that will make a waifufag smile.</br>  Requesting full-idol raifus<br>And wearing (power?) armour like their actual gun</br>  <br>Or I could make him fuck off.</br>  <br>Why do you say he doesn't care? Like any other OR they give proper thanks, so why does that invalidate from those on a shitposting-intended list?</br>   less than 12 hours  <br><br>I can already feel the freedom.</br></br>  <br>He'll just going to ignore like always and continue to request, because he is that greedy and selfish.</br>  <br>You're doing god's work son.

Its killing me.</br>  Requesting Hori and Miyamura having cute, yet awkward first-time sex or more of Miyamura 'abusing' or treating Hori roughly because she likes it. Total Maledom, or having Hori being his pet bitch in pet-play  <br>Pretty much shoot themselves in the foot. Most of the time they have to wait til Sunday to get a delivery.<br><br>But yeah, Sawyerfag has been around for ages. He is a dirty double dipper but he never shitposts as far as we know and thanks for all the deliveries he gets.</br></br></br>  <br> Sawyerfag has been around for ages. <br>No he hasn't.</br></br>  Rea as a futa fucking Ranko and pumping her womb full of cum<br>Rea is a partial zombie so make her have only fucking her on her mind, and power of a zombie (really strong) and her eyes are supposed to be red</br>  <br>Did you mean Mimifag has been here for ages?</br>  <br>I've been here for a year and he has been around all that time. I can only speak from my point of view. <br><br>How long has he been around?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why aren't you following mimifag example and requesting your waifu right now? There's no consequence anyway</br></br>  <br>It looks like Saki's author.</br>  <br>My waifu doesn't have oldfag status yet. Maybe once she joins the over 300 club.</br>  <br>Two years here, he was around before me. I remember the day he made that reference. I told him it was cool. He seemed really excited about it, it was cute.<br><br>He kinda seems like his smile and optimism are gone these days.</br></br></br>  <br>His requests seem almost robotic. More like he is requesting out of habit more than anything. I'm sure he loves his waifu dearly but the honeymoon phase is long over for him.<br><br>Time does that to ya I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>You'd be pissy too if you were stuck with the same ugly skank for over 2 years too, mate.</br>  <br>Not very long compared to most oldfags.</br>  <br><br>Who is the longest running requester in the WWD? Not straight but consistently over the years? and for how long?</br></br>  <br>Mimibro.</br>  <br>Gotta be Akarifag or Mimifag.</br>  <br>Gwen lasted a long time until things got pretty bad, but probably Akari or Mimi, could be wrong.</br>  Looked up the thread of my first delivery just for shits and giggles.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/363805<wbr>78<br>We've changed so much.<br><br>If I had to guess I would say Akaribro and Mimibro.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  Quick!

Obviously the Miia will be another bellydance but the idea I had for Cerea is as good, at least for me.  Shy Cerea lifting her skirt to show her pelvis/hips, like she doesnt have a vagoo I can do that, but still it somehow feels lewd. </br>  <br>Cute lewd is ok. Plus Cerea is great.</br>  <br>Seconded for cute lewd Cerea that won't even require spoilering but will because  some mods are easy to trigger .</br>  <br><br><br>Casting my vote for cute lewd Cerea as well.</br></br></br>  <br>You do you loen, but belly dance Miia  or really any Miia   is always welcome</br>  <br><br> Obviously the Miia will be another bellydance <br><br>Stop it, Loen. Stop trying to kill me by having my penis rupture.<br>Why must you do this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Plus there is so much Miaa and Rach-nee art, give a good girl like Cerea some love. She deserves it.</br>  <br> mangafox </br>  Fuck these ridiculous Adobe Illustrator prices.

I think it gets some hate in /ic/, at least the few times I have been there its been like that, but Im not sure why, since it works wonders for me. And PS too, just pirate it.<br><br><br><br>Okay, Cerea then.<br><br>No, I want you to suffer anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit that looks old as fuck</br>  <br> C-Cerea </br>  <br>It's fine,it's just that nips can't into design<br><br>That's why Japanese sites look like they're 90's geocities hosted shit</br></br></br>  <br>Loen, what's your setup?</br>  <br>windows 98 was one of their priority OS's</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl   <br>A crappy genius tablet<br> cdn1.tokopedia.net/img/product-1/20<wbr>11/11/25/80539/80539_beacee24-1719-<wbr>11e1-a7b9-acf230380690.jpg</wbr></wbr> <br>SAI, PS CS6 and thats about it. I really should get a better tablet but its not like a expensive tablet will give you magical drawing skills, its just a tool, so this one will do for a while. But this comes from someone that has no idea about tablets, this genius is my first and only one.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you use pen pressure?</br>  <br>Of course. I remember doing drawings with a mouse, pen preassure really feels like heaven.</br>  <br>I need a tablet for drawing.<br>What should I look for in my tablet?</br></br>  <br>She is best girl  in the first chapter. </br>  <br> no dubs or trips  <br>Ha.</br></br>  <br>I dont know anon, I just got mine because  it was the first one that I found, I knew I wouldnt find another one anytime soon so bought it the very same day.  You will have better luck in /ic/ with that question.</br>  <br>They'd be suggesting high priced/overly complicated ones and hating each other's tastes.</br>    <br>Thanks Loen. I'm the anon who drew the big nippled Rach and I was considering buying a tablet to further my drawing. Any tips to get clean lines like yours when I draw in Sai/PS?</br>  <br> Okay, Cerea then. <br>God's be praised!</br></br>    NTR doujins practically here  <br>Literally can't wait.</br>  <br>There's already a preview for a Papi one<br><br>Glad I couldn't care less what happens to Papi</br></br></br>  <br>You monster.</br>  <br>Fuck you!</br>  <br>You have a point there anon, but I really dont know.<br><br>In SAI, change your Ctrl+Z to a shortcut, a single key, because you gonna need it a lot (I have mine on backspace, Im left handed so its a well placed key for my free hand). Then do clean smooth lines in one swing, thats what makes it look clean. You will be re-doing the very same line 5+ times til it makes you happy, and same proccess with every single line.</br></br></br>    <br> Papi <br>Such a waste when we have Miia and Mero begging for a NTR doujin.</br></br>  <br>Mero yes<br><br>Miia no<br><br>I will genocide crusade anyone that makes anything with Miia that's not vanilla and love filled</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When was this done?! My hea..hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhnngggg</br>  <br>Still think Miia as a DJ doesn't exactly fit her personality-wise. I think she should be an idol.</br>  <br> Miia no <br>Sorry but your waifu was probably created with NTR in mind. It's no wonder Okayado filled the house with other girls, including one with this particular fetish.</br></br>  <br>Damn straight.</br>  <br>So all of them<br>Because let's face it, the artists will be able to pull the most contrived plots out their asses for each girl to be NTR'd. Every single one of them.</br></br>  <br> implying Suu can possibly be NTR'd </br>  <br>This yours?</br>  <br>Is this really a life worth living?</br>    <br>She can be NTR'd away from Papi</br>    <br>That dragon girl looks alarmingly like she's &gt;shiggy diggy doo-ing</br>  <br>But if we're following the logic of her being main girl, wouldn't she be a bad singer on top of being a bad cook?</br>  <br>Somehow I think Papi would be the one being NTR'd in that situation.</br>  <br>Suu inflatable-seats for sale when?</br>  <br>Jesus, can anyone stop the slime menace?!</br>  <br>No.<br><br> But who would want to? </br></br></br>  <br> tfw a slime will never rape you for your juices </br>  <br>Well, duh. You can't rape the willing.</br>  <br><br><br> rape </br></br></br>  <br>By your logic she would also be fucking terrible at being a DJ as well, so it really wouldn't matter. That aside, it is still easier for me to picture her being an idol than a DJ in my head.</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure Matsu-Sensei did this one.</br></br>  <br><br>She may not be a very good singer. She also seems only marginally OK with being the center of attention in public.</br></br>  <br><br> Yukio. <br><br> Pretty easily in fact. A universal weakness for polymorphs like Suu in both science-fiction and fantasy is low temperatures. A chilly day was enough to threaten to freeze Suu solid. She's literally be powerless against a being that wields ice-magic. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Go ahead. Would be amazed if it travels past this board, but if you can get a  3D  to say it in a video, that'll probably work.</br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>That was a prentender. I use actually use correct punctuation. Also the file name is a give away. As seen in <br>.<br>Jerks trying to steal my waifu.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where are her  downy pubes.<br><br>Samus told me they'd have those.</br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>Mustard is a spice, the reason people use mustard is it provides the fiery sensation of spice without lingering on the palette.<br><br>You can literally notice this by going to the kitchen, taking out a mustard bottle and trying some. That harsh "mustard" flavor is "spicy."</br></br></br></br>  Shirt designer guy here.<br><br>Started a new  Centorea -themed design last night that is coming along swimmingly.<br><br>Here's a sneak-peek of it.<br><br>I warn you, though, it's a parody-logo that not EVERYONE is going to be into...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NOPE</br>  <br>Not even surprised.</br>  <br>No mate. You fucked up. Just no. We like you, really, so abort mission while you can.</br>  <br><br><br>It was a request from someone here on /a/.<br>You know I can't turn one of my own down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, stop. Cerea fans do not, I repeat, DO NOT need this. <br> ... <br>Get out.</br></br></br>  <br> It was a request from some retard here on /a/ <br> You know I can't turn one of my own down </br></br>  <br>Tell the fan to fuck off</br>  <br>Anon no.

You all win. Never say I don't listen to my critics.<br><br>If you simply MUST put a damper on my creative spirit, let's try something else. And here I was thinking the world of high-art was a place WITHOUT taboos.<br><br>How's this for something a little but closer to everyone's speed?<br>This one's nearing completion. I just need to make sure it's perfect before final submission for printing.<br><br>How does this look? My primary concern is the color of the scale texture. Does it look right to you?<br>Too red? Too pink? Not pink/red enough? I need a second opinion on these things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> that file-name </br></br>  <br>Darker red, I think. Just realised something though. If it's printed in a solid red, over time, the print cracks and makes its own scales. At least, that's how it is with some of my old sheets.</br>  <br>Darker red. I think Miia's scales are a darker red</br>  <br><br><br>Honestly, Rach's exoskeletal arms and hands are one of the few things I don't really like about Okayado's Arachnae/Dryders.<br>Yeah, it makes them more exotic, but the inflexible chitin on a very important part of their body just seems very dehumanizing.<br><br>That and the extra eyes are the only things I never really liked.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You are a graphic designer, so am I, so a little advice: dont pick up requests from only 1 anon. Pick requests that will satisfy many anons. You do something your fanbase doesnt like, you will lose them, so you change and adapt to their liking if you dont want to lose them.<br> If you simply MUST put a damper on my creative spirit, let's try something else <br>And dont start with this, that one sentence is basically the reason why deviantart and tumblr are the way they are when its about art. When you are a graphic designer, you dont work for yourself, you work for the public. You keep the masses happy, many happy anons&gt;1 happy anon. Keep it up anon, you are doing great things.</br></br> </br>  <br><br> And dont start with this, that one sentence is basically the reason why deviantart and tumblr are the way they are when its about art. <br><br>I was joking and speaking sarcastically.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit just die please</br>  <br><br>On the other hand, I guess I can see where he gets the pink from.</br></br>  <br>What is Miia's scale colour anyhow? Red or pink?</br>  <br><br><br>How's this?<br>I'm dealing with some very fine tolerances here, so they may look very similar, so I was very precise and incremental in fucking with the shade and hue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's sort of the point</br>  <br><br>It fluctuates due to just Okayado's inconsistencies, but I'm pretty sure it's a relatively light red (slightly lighter than her hair-color), but they're very shiny and reflective when she's not close to a shedding, so they reflect a lot of light that makes them appear lighter.</br></br>  <br><br>....What? That could be adorbs, not cancerous.</br></br>  <br><br>End of Eva flashbacks, man. <br><br>One whiff and you're reliving the trauma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it couldn't have<br><br>Do you think there's anything to be gained by referencing MLP? Anything at all?</br></br></br>  <br>And here I was considering purchasing one of your other shirts. Oh well, guess I get to keep that pocket filled.</br>  <br><br>Money from the freaks so he can finance his other works? A strangely sarcastic / and or flustered Cera denying any affiliation? <br><br>Come on, /a/nons, use your imagination. Did Lavar Burton teach us nothing?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not the shirt guy, but you're so full of shit it's running out your ears. <br><br>Either buy or don't, but I really hope you don't believe people give a shit when you write/say things like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Congrats. You're cancerous.</br>  <br><br> All the people mad at this. <br><br>Why? Clever graphical t-shirt designs are all about taking something from culture and modifying it to become something different, but recognizable.<br><br>How is MLP any different? It's a facet of modern pop-culture that many people are familiar with. What's wrong with fucking with their logo to turn it into something comically related?<br><br>Are people just having a knee-jerk reaction because they've been taught to get pissy any time My Little Pony is alluded to in any capacity?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure this person is trying to be funny, but have to remember this is /a/.<br><br> Refusing to buy something from an artist because at some point they did a commission for someone else that involved referencing a show you don't like. <br><br>That'd be a sad new level of autism. Thank God you probably aren't serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's a fine line between "exotic" and "alien" though.<br><br>The point of Monmusu should be to create women with exotic but appealing features, not off-putting alien-looking creatures that happen to also have some feminine human parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL THAT MAD because he did an awesome job with the Suu shirt. The Rach shirt is very cool and can pass off as some normalfag MMA thing, if not a very stylized Punisher.<br><br>For Cerea he could have gone with something very chivalrous/knightly (or even ginormous boobs/dat ass joke), but instead we see MLP which came off as derivative from a different fandom instead of something near and to monmusu.</br></br></br>   first MLP <br> now SJW defending it <br>funny how things turn out sometimes</br></br>  Did anybody else see this?<br><br>Was this an actual, official advertisement for the anime, or just a fan-made thing?</br></br>  <br> Cerea's sick burn  <br>Ouch.</br></br>  <br>I'm . I don't care for the new stuff, even if I've never seen an episode. Maybe just hype backlash. I just generally prefer the older style.</br>  <br><br> For Cerea he could have gone with something very chivalrous/knightly (or even ginormous boobs/dat ass joke), but instead we see MLP which came off as derivative from a different fandom instead of something near and to monmusu. <br><br>He said it was a specific request from someone on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is all just a ruse cruse, everyone knows MLP is hated here. And making that t-shirt knowing it is MLP and trying to tie Cerea to it. This is top top bait.</br>  <br><br>I don't see the problem. She still gotr a human torso/head.<br><br>And she could wax the chitin to get it shiny like a dominatrix in pvc. Fits perfectly if you ask me.<br><br>And I don't even know how chitin behaves as a material at human-size scale.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> getting this fucking mad because something relates to a show you don't like <br><br>You realize you are currently on a board that has not only frequent, but consistent threads about Naruto that are totally and completely unironic, right?<br>And that's been the case since before MLP was even a thing back in like 2010/11.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stroke a giant beetle. Or a crab shell. Or hell, use the broad part of your fingernail to touch/manipulate objects. The former will be what she feels like to touch. The latter will be what she feels when touching things.</br>  <br><br>You realize you're on a site that had an attack of the MLP fandom so severe it had to make a containment board for it?</br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Half the point of /a/ is to shit on things we don't like.</br>  <br><br>Talk about being cancerous. <br><br>Being open minded and not an asshole doesn't immediately mean SJW.  doesn't exclude it either </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> a fandom was/is bad <br> that means the media that created the fandom is by proxy inherently bad, and therefore we must imbue it with the status of some sort of supernatural evil that can never be mentioned even in jest <br><br>No, I think you just need to calm your fucking tits down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no problem with the texture of beetles.<br><br><br> SJW <br> open-minded <br>good joke</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Graphic design guy:<br><br>Do a GIS for "polo" "logo".<br>Make a parody of any of them, using Cerea and a lance.<br>???<br>Profit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not sure if you read that correctly, chief. <br><br>Try again. I'll wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> now SJW defending it <br><br>When did this happen?<br>I thought Monster Musume was too obscure of Tumblr land-whales to care about, and even if they did, the presence of breasts above a C-cup would make them run in terror.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell I just think it was a tacky/lame design, even if it was a request(?)</br>  <br>Yea? But at least Naruto is /a/ related. I don't need anymore shit thrown at Cerea. It's bad enough I have to dea with "horse pussy" all the time. The image just makes it worse for Centaur fans. Yes I mad.</br>    <br><br> Do a GIS <br> GIS <br>What does this stand for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some are already angry about it</br>  <br>I'm saying it being open-minded does exclude SJWs</br>  <br>More accurately it had an attack of shitposters that found something that people were willing to respond to endlessly<br>The show wasn't that great, but the thread on /co/ was relatively self contained and decently behaved, from an outside perspective. Most of the rest of the shit was people pushing because it guaranteed a reaction</br></br>  <br>I meant that for example, stroking her arm is akin to rubbing a two-foot long section beetle/crab shell. How would she deal with a broken arm(or leg), I wonder? With most land arthropods, they seldom live long enough for it to matter.

Almost better than the Hen-Tie.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I see. I'll allow it.</br></br>  <br> stroking her arm is akin to rubbing a two-foot long section beetle/crab shell. <br>crabs live underwater with all kinds of things growing on them, friction scratching their shells and all that. Rachne on the other hand could use specialized "skin care products" to keep it smooth and somewhat soft.<br><br>also<br> Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of calcium carbonate <br>they composite chitin with calcite from sea water, which makes it much harder than just chitin<br><br><br> How would she deal with a broken arm(or leg), I wonder? <br>Sticky spider webs obviously. That stuff is pretty good for sealing wounds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> For Cerea he could have gone with something very chivalrous/knightly <br><br>Designer-guy here.<br><br>That was actually the same guy's other suggestion.<br>We were brain-storming something to do with Centorea's Armor from Chapter 21 since the image of her fully suited-up would work well for a logo that breaks a complex image down to simple shapes.<br>However, he couldn't come up with a request that utilized it, so I tried my hand at his other idea.<br>I just didn't realize some people on /a/ would lose their fudge when reminded of a cartoon they didn't personally like. I don't like MLP either, but somebody offered to buy the print from me so I started making it. Seemed like a moderately clever idea for a parody-logo that would be feasible to make.<br><br>I'm just trying to create things that people will like here, guys. Calm down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't get it. Am I overlooking a pun here?<br><br>Is it just "Horse Pussy" that is the pun? Low-hanging fruit if that's the case.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I meant that for example, stroking her arm is akin to rubbing a two-foot long section beetle/crab shell. <br><br>This is assuming she's made of a similar material.<br>Just because part of her body is shaped like a spider, that doesn't mean it has the same texture.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But at least Naruto is /a/ related. <br><br>Shame that doesn't make the fans any less autistic, eh?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> How would she deal with a broken arm(or leg), I wonder? With most land arthropods, they seldom live long enough for it to matter. I think crabs and lobsters jettison the damaged limb then regrow them. Arachne=??? <br><br>Despite their spider-like portions, Arachnae are pretty assuredly mammalian and very similar in core biology to humans. Lamias are too, for example, despite being pikothermic and having various reptile-like properties.<br><br>Her limbs might even have an endoskeleton in ADDITION to having an exoskeleton for all we know, meaning a broken leg would heal like any mammalian species.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Even Miia's little D-shaped clips are making a "&gt;_&lt;"-expression. <br><br>Too cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But it is. We've seen that her hand is basically like a half-crab(with her digits forming the legs), sharp and hard enough to tear human flesh. Granted, the actual sensitivity on her part is up for debate(most arthropods have chitinous "hairs" jutting through the shell, which allows them to feel more things than just direct pressure against the surface (eg, wind blowing across the surface).</br></br>  <br><br><br>Did you mean the Ralph Lauren Logo? Or something similar to this? The Ralph Lauren Logo is often called the "Polo" logo.</br></br></br>  <br>her fingertips might be specialized, extra-hard material for digging into surfaces though. like teeth are a lot harder than other "hard" structures in the human body. So the rest of the chitinous cover might be different</br>  <br><br>Forgot the pic.</br></br>  <br><br> can't hold hands or cuddle with your Arachnae waifu unless she wears gloves <br><br>Sad stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ferrari logo could be cool</br>  Oh my. Have some WIP.  <br>thimbles might do the job</br>    <br><br> Centorea appears slightly bustier in the manga. <br><br>Aside from that I am happy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>on MAL it says it started airing. Where the fuck is it ?!</br>  <br><br><br><br>Combine the two. Replace polo club with lance. I actually meant pick any of the polo silhouettes.
