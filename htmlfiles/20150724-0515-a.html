[ What if she is secretly the lewdest one of them all?  <br>she's going to be pregnant so yes.</br>  <br>It's not a what if it's that the actual situation.</br>  <br>She's going to bear a child so yes</br>  <br><br>who's the father? the mc?</br></br>    <br>That's clear at the end of last episode</br>  <br> You'll never give a blowjob to Kajou under the table </br>  <br>That's not a very good secret since everyone knows this already</br>  <br><br>wait what, sauce please</br></br>  <br>She's the only girl I would suck her dick if she was a futa</br>  <br> she's going to be pregnant so yes. <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>I think it started here: https://archive.moe/a/thread/128375<wbr>500/<br>Also i found this one</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>So is this one of the drama that the lnfags told us?</br></br>  <br> sucking Kajo's dick <br><br>GAY</br></br></br>  <br>So what exactly does it say?</br>  <br> not wanting to suck Kajo's dick <br>what the fuck are you doing in this thread and watching this anime<br><br>Tanukichi gets Anna pregnant</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anna was the only reason I was even interested in this show, dropped.</br>  <br>I really wanted Kajo getting the Okuma.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br> Orgy End </br>  <br>Okuma is a pervert, but he's a good man. He's one girl only.<br>Also, Anna could be a major pervert and a cock slut, but it's OKUMA's cockslut. She wets for him because she's in love.</br></br>  <br><br>It's Tanukichi and Anna, together, informing Sofia, who expects that something is wrong, but hitherto was unaware of Tanukichi's relationship with Anna, that there's a problem. Anna informs her mother that, to her, Tanukichi is the most important thing in the world, and that she loves Tanukichi; this profession of love surprises Tanukichi, not because he is unhappy but it's the first time she's saying it, simultaneously informing both him and Sofia. <br><br>It doesn't say she's pregnant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If this pregnancy rumor is true, that's quite the change of mood for a lighthearted comedy. It's pretty doubtful in fact</br>  S O X  <br>I find it hilarious that no one on /a/ can read Japanese.</br>  <br>The pregnancy stuff was made up because 90%people in /a/ can't moon. The kanji used for pregnancy 妊娠 is nowhere seen in that text. <br>For what I can see, is just Anna telling her mother that she's in love with Tanukichi, that he's the most valuable thing for her. Shit is that Tanukichi can't aswer shit because she had Kajo (I think?) in his mind too.</br></br>  <br><br>Read it again<br> そこの卑猥なゴミに妊娠させられたことで情緒不安定になっているのでは.<wbr>..</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. How did I miss that? But it doesn't say she's pregnant though, it says that pregnancy is considered garbage or stuff.</br>  <br>So do you just not know Japanese or what?</br>  <br><br>Collusion! fuck you guys!</br></br>  <br>Line please? can't fuckin see it</br>  <br>13th</br>  <br><br>Nevermind, I found it. It doesn't say she's pregnant, they are talking about pregnancy. It seems that anon got confused and got shimoneta fandom mad.<br><br>She's not pregnant. Okuma can't decide if he likes Kajo or Anna, Anna wets for him and turns to be more pervert than Okuma and Kajo together.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That isn't Anna saying she's pregant you dumbass. It's wonder if the reason for Anna's recent emotional instability is a result of her being pregnant. <br><br>It isn't. It's because she loves Tanukichi, and she hasn't been able to admit it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Be she does admit it at the very last, but Tanukichi is the one undecided.</br>  <br>And at the end<br> アンナ先輩、僕は――― <br>It seems that Tanukichi, like us, wants the Anna but at the same time wants to suck Kajo's dick</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why can't he fuck Anna while simultaneously taking Kajo's dick in the ass?</br></br>  <br>because even when he's a pervert, he's 1 girl only</br>  <br>Well I don't mind at all if he gets both. I'd love to see a menage a trois.</br>    <br>She likes him. So?</br>  it's pretty clear that he will end with Kajo <br> being this dense </br>  So Anna being pregnant was just a mistranslation and we went mad for nothing?  <br><br>Yes, they were saying if the reason she was emotionally unestable was because she was pregnant.<br> trusting in a <br>is your fault</br></br></br></br>   Still not Hiryuu   <br> secretly <br>too late</br></br>  You fags ruined it. Of course she is not pregnant, they did pregnancy test and it was negative. Also Ayame confessed to MC in front of Anna in vol 9, fuck you.  <br>See you next week!</br>  <br>whats his reaction? How did Anna take it? I can see Anna dont giving a fuck but he is spilling spaghetti everyone</br>  <br>Speculating you mean?<br><br>Yea I never fully trust /a/ but I thought that as a prank was too much elaborated and in the face to pull it off for such a not-so-popular anime, but as a dumbass I forgot Hanlon's Razor and didn't think about /a/ simply being dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you really thought this would last? Also, where I can find Vol 9? I wanna read that cuck</br>  <br>Read this </br>  <br> secretly </br>  <br> そこの卑猥なゴミに妊娠させられたことで情緒不安定になっているのでは.<wbr></wbr> <br><br> With it has become emotionally unstable that it was allowed to pregnancy to the bottom of the obscene waste . <br>w-what</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isnt this Reverse Cuck? Doesnt Cuck require a white dude getting his GF banged in front of him?</br>  <br>I was correcting him by saying that the characters were actually speculating</br>  <br><br>Read the whole page, anon. Anna isn't pregnant.  even says it's a misunderstanding.<br><br>The reason Anna has been recently distraught is not because she's pregnant, but because she's soberly, but firmly, come to the realization that she loves Tanukichi.</br></br></br></br>  Anyway, with that business out of the way, he can get down to getting best girl pregnant instead.  <br>Tell us more of that confession, please.</br>  <br>I don't know, I bought them.<br><br/></br></br>  She's perfection.  <br>She isn't lewd because she doesn't know what lewd is.</br>  <br>Translate please. I'm about to Iku Iku! here<br> Anata no [unreadable kanji for me] ga daisukiyo! </br></br>  So this thread just proves that /a/ don't know how to read moon at all ?  <br>She also isnt pure by that reason. You can only be pure if you atleast know whats lewd is, choosing to be pure is what truly perfection. Anna and all these guys arent really pure, they just dont know any better.</br>  <br>She just discovered what lewd is at the very end of the episode.<br><br>And she doesn't even know what it is yet. It's her first time feeling it.</br></br></br>  S<br>O<br>X</br></br>  <br>S<br>O<br>S</br></br></br>  <br>wait, i barely understand moon but did just Takunichi likes her back? I can see a "Honto ni yokatta ne! sayonara! bye bye!"<br>She's relieved or something? Anna a cuck?</br></br>  <br>I can see Anna not giving a shit. " Oh you like him too? Well guess we are rivals now, k thx bye, i try raping him anyways."</br>  <br><br>it says <br><br><br> And then, Kajō, at once, declaimed something unbelievable; <br> "I love everything about you, Takunichi !"  <br> "I'm forever grateful, truly, to have meet a person as funny as you; as kind as you;" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> haremshit <br>DROPPEEEEEEEED</br></br>  <br>And then she leaves right? Why she leaves after confessing to him?</br>  <br>This is also the point of the story if you want to find a social critique into it</br>   tfw no english translated LNs   <br><br> "Tonight's special is a big, steamy wiener. Enjoy, sir." </br></br>  <br><br> Orgy end <br> three people <br><br>You'll need more than that. We'll need Saotome, Goriki, and Fuwa.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not the whole school </br>  <br> the anime will never get here <br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>Who a fairly basic love triangle makes it harem?</br>  <br>She is maximum overlewd?</br>  <br>Jesus fuck, this lewd Anna thing is really going places in these threads.<br><br>Will the anime actually go that far?</br></br></br>  <br>For sure she will try to rape Okuma in his apartment</br>  <br><br>Even the flies?</br></br>  <br>Harem requires at least three unique characters to have romantic feelings for the lead main character.</br>  <br>Was that the context of the next episode preview?</br>  Well, that's how this shit usually plays out, isn't it?  <br><br>Here's all of it if anyone wants it:<br><br> And then, Kajō, at once, declaimed something unbelievable; <br> "I love everything about you, Takunichi !"  <br> "I'm forever grateful, truly, to have meet a person as funny as you; as kind as you;" <br> "... But for now, farewell, at least for a while." <br> Takunichi, flustered, asked himself what, what has she gone and said this time?  <br> "Kajō, who in;"  <br> Anna, to his side, screamed... Terminally and completely cutting through Takunichi's response. <br><br> I omitted the fact that Kajō' inserts "hooters" into her sentence, as it ruins the emotion of the scene. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br> implying there isn't another character that likes the MC </br></br>  Why don't nips just have sex  This wouldn't be half as boner inducing without the heart pupils. I don't even know what's it about them anymore, but the mere mention of it makes me hard in no time.  <br>It isn't even about heart pupils for me, it's just irregular eyes in general. Then again, eyes have always been my primary attraction feature ever since birth, so it's not surprising that variance in them makes me diamonds.</br>  <br>Especially the flies.</br>  <br><br>Scientist girl exists. not!Mirai exists. pic related exists</br></br>  <br>wait thats the police chick in the first episode. Is she actually Kajos mom? She seems pretty similiar to hers</br>  <br>Are they part of the main cast, with "main character" levels of screentime? Then you can include them.<br><br>Are they side characters, or main characters that get side character level screentime? They aren't counted.<br><br>Rare exception: If the lead main character is romantically interested in them, they are automatically included by default, albeit with an asterisk.</br></br></br></br></br>  PLEASE HELP, WHICH SUBS ARENT FUCKING SHIT AND WHICH VIDEO ISNT A CENSORED FUNI RIP  <br>So Takunichi likes her back right?</br>  <br> Anna <br> pregnant <br> from Tanukichi <br>Far and few between are those Spoilers that would be able to improve a show immensely.</br></br></br></br>  <br>clawhammer is uncensored and fast.</br>  <br>that's from the LN? This show won't make it far.</br>  <br>what police chick?</br>  <br>They haven't even subbed 3rd ep yet?</br>  <br>pic related<br><br><br>of course they have, check nyaa,<br>only 3 hours later than horriblesubs, yet all oncensored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you can even see Anna's bracelet in that</br>  <br>Did you see the preview? It's actually the plot of the next episode, so the anime WILL make that far at least. Even the cookies, that happen the day after</br>  <br><br>It still uses Funi's shit tier scripts. Hiryuu is the best choice.</br></br>  <br>Two is enough.</br>  <br>Hiryuu is so late though, 4 days later than the other subs. EP3 isnt even out yet. They are fine for archive saving but if you want to watch the show with /a/ they are too slow</br>  <br>Incorrect, two is a love triangle. Different genre, different target audience.</br>  <br> pic related <br>I hope it's her. I love when shows break serious girls.</br></br>  <br> Secretly </br>  How did we get that far without mentioning the COOKIES?  <br> What if she is secretly the lewdest one of them all? <br>You just need to watch the Opening to figure it out</br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck. Is this where the series gets serious?</br></br>  <br>But if MC loves another person who doesn't love him and there are two other characters who love MC?</br>  <br>Refer to <br><br>"Rare exception: If the lead main character is romantically interested in them, they are automatically included by default, albeit with an asterisk."</br></br></br>  <br>I wondered if Anna likes sex a lot why her mom doesnt like sex or she is hiding something?</br>  <br>I'd ask why she has a daughter to begin with</br>  <br>The morality law was only implemented 16 years ago. It's only Okuma's generation that's completely ignorant.</br>  <br>Yes but she and her husband were the one that pushed for these laws. If she hates sex so much and considers it dirty, how does she have a daughter at all?</br>  I don't even watch this show, I'm here exclusively for the Mirai-like  <br>faggot</br>  <br>Maybe they noticed Anna's slutiness as an infant when she wouldn't stop touching herself and pushed the laws to protect her?</br>  <br>She probably won't even appear season. She came out in volume 8 of the LN. the last episode concluded volume 1 I think.</br>  <br> concluded volume 1 <br>not yet, probably one or two more episodes.</br></br>  <br>This could be an interesting plot about shit parenting</br>  <br>She is.</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br> Anna with a wig. She is in SOX mode </br>  <br>You can remove the collars?</br>  <br> the father is   Tanukichi<br/> <br>crisis adverted, then. I would be pissed if there was some  NTR busines  going on.</br></br>  <br>The hottest design<br><br> I was expecting her to join SOX at some point but I never figured out it was her in that pic, I would have expected standard panties on the face </br></br></br>  <br>Their society leaves little time for anything other than work. Japanese birthrates are abysmal</br>  <br>What? Stop spreading false spoilers.</br>  <br>WHO DO I BELIEVE NOW</br>  <br><br>- Anna isn't pregnant<br>- Anna isn't a man<br>- Both Anna and Kajo confess their love<br>- The show is shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me. She's a new character, and her name is Annie Brown.</br>  <br>With that one, Anna and Kajo we're officially entering harem territory then?</br>  <br>ANOTHER CLONE ADDED TO MY LIST!</br>  <br>But Anna isn't pregnant</br>  <br> preggers <br>Proven false.</br></br>  <br><br>You've never seen the chart, have you? It's full of humorous lies and isn't supposed to be taken seriously.</br></br>  <br>Oh. so the the rape of MC scene and love honey cookies is still volume 1?</br>  <br>At least change it to lewd Youmu</br>  <br>Do you think the BD's will have no annoying censorship like it does right now?</br>  <br> implying the censorship wasn't intentional and not played as gags </br>  <br>if you mean the splurts and other noises I get the feeling its intentional<br><br>the stickers? probably</br></br></br>  <br>If anything it should remain as preggers Youmu just to confuse animeonlyfags and newfags in the future.</br>  <br> The show is shit <br><br>nice try</br></br></br>  <br>X<br>O<br>S</br></br></br>    There really needs to be more notMirai art.  Hopefully Okuma gets some of that Annas from Anna.  <br>well he's getting some of her love honey soon</br>  <br><br>huh, so Anna will prove to be truly sexually perverted, depraved even. While Kajou only likes dirty jokes and is open and the mc was raised on dirty jokes and pretty fucking open. ahh shit Anna is a no go. kajou best girl confirmed even plot wise it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>Is this actually confirmed to be Anna?</br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  <br>The collar is different. so I don't think so</br>  <br>damn, the image has been around for days now and still no one has confirmed who she actually is. Shame. NewMirai best Mirai.</br>  <br>This is most certainly not the world The Boss envisioned</br>  <br> days <br>Try months. This shit is OLD.</br></br>  <br><br>I found out her name!<br><br>It's  Ranko Okuma </br></br></br></br>  Will she ever find the secrets of procreation?  <br>I've seen this image around for months now.<br>Didn't even know she was from this series until a week ago though.</br></br>  Please. I fucking bow my head down. Don't make this another main girl wins shit. Please, it's so damn cliche and the main girl is so fucking ugly, I never asked for this.  <br>She looks like she is pretty close.</br>  <br> Okuma? Is related to the MC ?</br>    Well tips to the guy who wrote it and i get what he's trying to say, the only problem he exaggurates the censorship in Japan way too much.<br>No one forces you to watch japanese porn anyway, you can watch chinese there's hardly any difference.</br>  <br>But Anna is pregnant<br><br>Were you not present in the last thread or not read the first few posts of this one?</br></br></br>  <br>Japan fucking hates China and would never masturbate to any porn they'd produce.<br><br>Not that they can, because porn is banned entirely in China anyway.</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah Kajo's design is pretty shit. Every time I see her hair it triggers me because it looks like she's going bald. <br><br>Need MC get some of those Annas from Anna.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Japan hates Korea too<br><br>Doesn't stop them from frequently having their popstars on their TV shows nor stops kpop from topping nip music charts all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Post a trans faggot</br>  <br><br>I didn't even realize it's the same. I just saw a piece of fanart on pixiv of her and then looked it up to confirm. We won't know since she's a late character unless we get another cour or future season.</br></br>  <br> fanart  <br>POST IT</br></br>  <br>Ranko is Tanukichis's mother, it's not her on that cover.</br>  <br>What fucking garbage are you spreading<br><br>That person is clearly Anna</br></br></br>  <br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51563549</wbr></br></br>  I wish Anna had gotten pregnant. That episode would have had the best threads of the year.  <br><br>That fanart is defo not based on Anna. New character confirmed.</br></br>  <br>It would have been one hell of a shift for a show like this to take.<br><br>I want to see that version too.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you serious<br><br>The original picture is Anna cosplaying as MIrai from KnK<br><br>It's not a new character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did someone do this with Anna?</br>  <br> 7 hours and 48 minutes ago <br>Still no Hiryuu.</br></br>  <br>Collar is different tho. And Anna doesn't wear glasses.</br>  <br> Anna doesn't wear glasses <br><br>What part of <br> cosplay <br><br>Don't you understand</br></br></br></br></br></br>  any links for the full ed?  <br>How do you explain the collar then.</br>  <br> casually not mentioning the fact that the collar is completely different to Anna's. </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I read in some other thread here that this new character's name is Annie Brown. Not sure if it was a troll tho</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>tbh given that they have the cellphone in order to suppress the collars it's not impossible to be there a way to change collar for a disguise<br><br>still unlikely despite the uncanny resemblance with Mirai</br></br></br></br>  <br> Annie Brown <br>Yes, that's her name.</br></br>  <br>American?</br>  <br>I don't care who she is. ALL I WANT IS MOAR.</br>  <br>Proof?</br>  <br><br> implying Yuzuki couldn't have decided to have drawn a different collar <br><br>The person looks exactly like Anna if she were to cosplay as Mirai, how do you explain that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sameface.</br>  NEAT  <br> lol you know what I feel like doing today? Drawing a different collar on Anna just becuase i feel like it. No one will care or anything. It'll be cool, what a great idea, I hope the loyal fans don't mind.  <br>No.</br></br>  <br> implying artists don't change things about their characters especially when they're making them do shit like cosplay <br><br>Are you retarded or something, just because you'll get your panties in a bunch because her collar changed doesn't mean Yuzuki gives a shit</br></br></br>  <br>The  wiki  lists Ranko Okuma as a different person.</br>  <br>ITT people who think the artist has to cater to their every whim and never do anything that they want to with their own characters</br>  <br>Sure thing, friendo.</br>  <br>also Nadeshiko Kajou is likely , making her Ayame's nee-chan</br>  <br>Hahahaha good one! XD</br>  <br> wikipedia <br> a site literally anyone can modify <br><br>i like how there's nothing written underneath either of those entries</br></br></br></br>  <br>I known there is a reference in this poolroom, I have seem this miltiple times, but honestly it went over my head,<br>Can someone explain it</br></br>  <br>b-but I don't wear panties, anon-kun.</br>  <br>Find all the JAV covers involving a swimming pool</br>  <br>Google jav pool</br>  <br><br>Kajou wanted Tanukichi to run away, while she delays Anna. She tells him that she will definitely find an opening and soon catch up with him. She puts a lotion all over herself, so for a while she has an upper hand in that fight. Anna tells her that it was a mistake to entrust Tanukichi to her and that she wants him back. She says that Ayame betrayed her not only once, but twice. She was Setsugen no Ao and she stole Anna's beloved. She thinks that Ayame is somehow deceiving Tanukichi. Ayame tells her that there is nothing to return. She thinks that, because unlike Anna, she didn't do anything ecchi with Tanukichi, she only gave him 10 yen chocolate on Valentine's Day and passed it as a joke. Then she decides to confess to him through PM call(that fragment).</br></br>  <br>I don't have any, I'm just reporting other claims.<br><br>On the other and Annie's name popped up the same time Anna's drama began.<br><br>Especially reporting a part in which Anna asked Okuma who was the most important person to him end he couldn't respond because he was undecided between Anna, Kajo and "Annie" and I was like "wtf who is this".<br><br>Then maybe it is all made up and some decide to peg the name on that picture for shit and giggles</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will the manga be translated  <br><br>Ohh, I get now, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>get it*</br>  you can find that pool even just by searching "that pool" on google  <br>Yeah Google seems to confirm people think she's called Annie brown.</br>  <br>So we have Anna in a fit of jealousy and Kajo beating each other?<br><br>I dig it</br></br></br>  Anna or Kajo?<br><br>Who would be a better wife?</br></br>  <br>Tanukichi should just give them both the D.</br>  <br>I'll take Anna.</br>  <br>Is she a political threat to Anna presidency?</br>  <br>Kajou for me</br>  <br>Slavs make better wives.</br>  <br>He for sure is going to give it to Anna.<br><br>Or more appropriately, she is going to take it from him by force.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing beats jav if we are talking about 3dpd</br>  <br>kajo</br>  <br>If I had a son with Ana do you think she would try to rape him? If so then Ana.</br>  <br>Anna.</br>  <br>But main girl is Ohoho this time. She's is literally as good as it gets as far as main girls go.</br>  This is literally the first show where I want the main girl to win.  <br><br><br>You are thinking too small. The orgy will encompass the entirety of Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>poll pls</br>  <br>Kajo<br><br>She has a great sense of humor. Everywhere we would go, we would be the life of the party.<br><br>She's also fairly blunt and to the point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She has some shit hair though.</br>  <br>I like both her hairstyles.</br>  <br>You have some shit hair.</br>  <br>Kajo</br>  <br>I know, it's the shit</br>  <br>both of her hairstyles are great, and she actually has a realistic hair color.</br>  <br>Anna would be a depraved slut until the day she is truly satisfied, and by then, she will have your child  oops <br><br>Kajo would be a fun little rocket, but would eventually mature and the jokes would stop. She'd say that they are for kids and that in her youth, she had wild dreams and had fun with it, but now it's time to grow up. <br><br>In terms of longevity, Anna would definitely make a husband happier. Kajo would be a great deal of entertainment, but would eventually just stop.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br><br>There are way too similar between this anime and MGS V.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GJV<wbr>xPAiB7as</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I first heard SOX, Metal Gear was the first thing I thought of.</br>  <br> WORDS THAT KILL </br>  OP sure is a slowpoke  So which release best release? Horriblesub is censored garbage  <br> censored <br>wait there is a group that releases an uncensored version? already?</br></br>  <br><br>Hiryuu and Clawhammer use the ATX version which is less censored. The only difference is that there aren't as many of the censor stickers. A lot of it is censored intentionally as part of the joke</br></br>  This thread is too confusing. I'm just going to forget it ever happened.  <br>Just how is it confusing to you?</br>  Is the manga/LN picked up yet? The anime is only 12 episodes...  <br>Apparently her name is Ranko Okuma.<br> Only know this because of a pixiv tag </br></br>  Well, apparently Okuma Ranko is the name of the MC's mom.  <br>Read that at the MC's character introduction in aniwotawiki: http://www49.atwiki.jp/aniwotawiki/<wbr>pages/30519.html</wbr></br>  <br>So she's his freakin mother? What a tweest</br>   hiryuu STILL not done <br><br>WTF???</br></br>  <br>Dunno if that blond girl and MC's mom is the same person though, since the name Annie Brown is also there on the wiki.</br>   tfw manga isn't translated   <br>Only the first 2 chapters of the manga was translated and only a few selected paragraphs from the LN.</br>  <br>No way that blond girl is his mother. I saw a picture of that blond girl straddling Tanukichi.<br><br>Would your mum do that to you?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128464577 <br>Boku no Pico</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128464577 <br><br>Shimoneta</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128464577 <br>Seitokai Yakuindomo</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128464577 <br>Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai <br><br>(its in the title of the thread)</br></br></br>  <br>Living in a sexually repressed society turns people into bigger perverts than they'd usually be.

I mean I know they are popular, but isn't BNHA more popular than Bleach right now in Japan. I mean why doesn't someone scan the whole magazine so we get everything at once. There is probably a good explanation but I don't know what it is. Naruto gaiden scans were coming out like 3 days before we wouldn't even get a BNHA spoiler. And the gaiden would be translated like five days before we got a translation for this series.</br>  <br> 3 days before we wouldn't even get a BNHA spoiler. And the gaiden would be translated like five days before we got a translation for this series. <br>Just lies.<br>We pretty much always got scans within 24 hours and china bro gives us a translation within that time frame too.<br>FA usually had their thing out within 48 hours, sometimes they went a little over but the longest i noticed was 3 days</br></br></br></br>  <br> but isn't BNHA more popular than Bleach right now in Japan <br>No. Just no.<br>BnHA is just well accepted, it isn't that much popular. You can't use ToCs alone to determine which series are popular.</br></br></br>    Awaiting scans.  <br>Bleach? Nah, but series like World Trigger yeah.

We get jap spoilers about the same time as other Jump series, and chinkscans one day after the big three. It's mainly Ishuhui that's the bottleneck in the process. <br><br> But no seriously when can we at least expect a spoiler <br>We get reliable spoilers on Thrusdays.

I have brain damage.</br>  <br><br>The author said on his twitter he always wanted a frog character in his stories as soon as her popularity boomed he was surprised since he thought he was gonna be the only one to like her.

Look at how aggressive he defend it there. For no reason.</br>  <br> hey have been called the monster trio <br>not here on /a/ thought. At least not by more than one samefag. We don't steal terms from diffent series and use it for everything besides retarded shit like cuck.

As Deku finds himself in a pinch, it's his turned to be saved.... this time by none other than Todoroki....!!!"</br></br>  <br>No, it's not really a term that's used in these threads with any sort of regularity. Trying to cover up your faux pas with bluster and indignation just makes you an idiot.</br>   everyone is shit except deku, todoroki, and bombguy <br><br>and what the fuck is that pro hero doing right now, stain is using his powers on iida</br></br>  <br>Maybe his power can work on various persons at the same time</br>  <br>I thought the other guy was passed when Stain pointed at him</br>  Great manga. Terrible fanbase.  <br><br>no, he was cursing him and then iida came.<br><br>and stain really is a shit villain, even the random gero iida was with was able to figure his pattern. how come no big name hero has stepped up to stop this guy yet since he's maimed and killed a lot of heroes just doing their job?</br></br></br></br>  <br> B But the fanbase  <br><br>back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br><br>it's an average manga with fanbase as annoying as any other</br></br>  <br> no, he was cursing him and then iida came. <br>I meant pic related. He looks like he's still under stain's control and/or passed out. Either way Stain used his powers on Iida after that page, so maybe he will wake/stand uo this chapter-<br><br> how come no big name hero has stepped up to stop this guy yet since he's maimed and killed a lot of heroes just doing their job? <br>Based Endeavor had probably the same idea as Iida.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Newfag.</br>  <br>It's a manga that runs in Shounen Jump. Is in black and white and reads right to left. Therefore a manga.<br><br>Having elements of an American comic doesn't change the fact that its a manga.</br></br></br>  <br>I notice this with everything I enjoy.</br>  <br> Get call out <br> better call him a newfag <br>now fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Manga means /co/mic.</br>  <br> Based Endeavor had probably the same idea as Iida. <br><br>What he said last chapter implies this, at the same time the random hero that Iida was with knew the pattern as well... meaning that most heroes are probably aware and yet stain hasn't been targeted or anything even though he's been pulling this for the longest time.</br></br></br>  <br>Epic greentext newfag.</br>  <br>Yes manga does translate to comic in Japanese, however this specific section is of /a/ is for Japanese animation and comics.</br>  <br><br>newfag calling anyone newfag cute</br></br>  <br><br>Most heroes probably don't care/think that Stain wouldn't stand a chance against them. I mean, that's why Stain is so pissed in the first place, because heroes nowadays only care about money and prestige, and not about helping/saving others except for their own gain.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, to be honest a lot of heroes seem like they have terrible powers and really shouldn't be doing the job.</br></br>  <br>There are different types of heroes. For instance No13 does disaster relief. <br><br>But yeah the whole system is really just a popularity contest, which means that at times the best will be passed over for the more popular.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, Horikoshi did a good job in making powerlevels tame. Even though All Might/Deku and Endeavor/Todoroki are monsters, most characters aren't overpowered, so even simple powers are still pretty useful/strong. I mean, it's not like other shounens were anyone can train and lift buildings/become faster than light/be immune to earth-shattering blasts, so even normal weapons (guns, blades and the like) are still dangerous. Just look how menacing Stain or manchild are, even though their powers are quite simple and straightforward. In any other shounen they would be joke/filler enemies.</br></br>  <br><br>epic maymay</br></br>   Can rape Stain with ease. <br> Nah lets just ignore this guy despite having a strong as fuck quirk. </br>  <br>Fuck you faggot, Anon suspected me to be you just because I said that I like Mindfuck. Now people hate best boy because of your attention whoring.</br>  <br><br>lelouch pls</br></br>  <br>not sure he can trigger him though.</br>  <br>kek, horikoshi said he has many things planned for mina so maybe her winning the dekubowl are one of those  would be perfect if gravity actually start liking deku and she end up as the zessica of this series .</br>  <br> Zessica <br>You mean the character that never had any chance of winning at all? But instead of moving on continues to stalk MC for the remainder of the series while conducting her own pity party, causing one of her friends to get kidnapped and turned into a man?</br></br>  <br>spider-man gloves</br>  <br>Idk why people keep ignoring that Deku clearly like Ochako, are you guys that desperate for your ships to happen?</br>  <br> Almight taking a selfie </br>  <br><br>Come on, chinks. Wait is suffering.</br></br>  <br><br>He probably can't control people who have a stronger will than himself, which Stain easily has.</br></br>  <br>It's a 50 characters long vote result buddy, not a list.<br>You read it from top right to bottom left</br></br>  <br>so she's Anarchist from X-Statix?</br>  World trigger just went up. That means Bnha is next. Might take them a little bit longer thanks to the colour page.  <br>But anon, deku is still a beta when it comes to the opposite sex, can you assure that if a girl corner and confess her love feelings for him he'll reject her? Not to consider if it's a carnivorous one that straight up  hug him, hold his hand, interlock fingers and kiss him , can you be sure he won't fall for that girl and forgot ochako even exists?</br>  <br>Or it might just make him uncomfortable since he may not be attracted to her.</br>  <br>Where did you read that he likes her? Take off your shipping googles, he is intimidated because he is not used to talk to girls and she's kind. Yeah, I can see the hints that there are hints that they will become a couple later but you are making up stuff.</br>  <br>lol tsuyu fags holding onto the last thread of hope they have.</br>  <br> Deku <br> Monster <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>He talks to a few other girls in the series and doesn't react the same way, be delusional if you want I guess. I'm going to bed, night anons.</br>  <br> Implying <br>You know Stain and psychos like him love to run their mouths about their ideals. If Stain doesn't begin by talking, if the guy just asks "Why ?" he's sure to get an answer.</br></br>  <br>Didn't he throw a ball into orbit, with like, 1% of his power?</br>  <br><br>I was talking solely about their quirks. Even though Deku is weak right now, OFA is probably the strongest quirk, there's really no contest.</br></br>  BnHA is the only thing left to translate on Ishuhui, we're getting the chapter soon.  <br>Hey lelouch, when are you going to kill yourself for the greater good, we all hate you already</br>  <br>It was more than 1%, since he actually got hurt a bit. <br>And a few hundred meters isn't orbit.</br></br>  fucking chinks can't even do their job of stealing right  <br>he may have confused it with Uraraka.</br>  <br><br> Iida's despair face <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, so it was Uraraka?<br><br>Yeah but 5% is bone breaking. He didn't break his finger did he?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> Class-Trip-to-America arc. <br> Just in time for prom. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm certain he did break his finger. That was full power. He wasn't able to hold back until after he punched Noumu.</br>  There are probably people with fantastic quirks who don't waste their time with being a hero and just live a normal life.  <br>What ? 5% isn't bone breaking, it's his current maximum without hurting himself</br>  <br><br>Well I guess I'm just confused as shit. Nevermind me.</br></br>  <br>I am not even a shipper. Remove your googles and you'll see better, there is no other girl who is that kind with him.He is a nerd who is happy because a pretty girl is that nice with him, typical reaction.</br>  <br><br>Also uraraka didn't send it into orbit.<br>She nullified it's gravity, she sent it into whatever was in the direction she threw it in, be it the sun or infinite, endless space.</br></br></br>  <br> Chapter 350 <br> Aliens kidnapp Ochako after identifying her as the one who threw a ball on their ship </br></br>  <br> Also Uraraka didnt send it into orbit <br><br>never said she did, the confused guy said deku sent the ball into orbit so i said he may have confused it with the moment when Uraraka sent the ball flying.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> 150cm <br> 159cm <br><br>Why are all the girls in this manga so short?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they are nips?</br>  <br>Nips and also teenagers</br>  <br>They're japanese</br>  <br>Because short girls are cute as fuck and the taller ones tend to be sexy (hint:momo) so he's going more for cute with heroine then sex appeal</br>  <br>And it's one year, everybody<br>I'm really glad he got to this point, his previous series barely break a year when combined.<br>Here's hoping for the next to be as good as the first one.</br></br></br>   deku's parent both have quirks <br> he doesn't <br><br>What says he doesn't get a quirk that just takes longer to develp?</br></br></br>  <br>Medical examination</br>  <br>His parents have quirks and they don't manifest after 4.</br>  <br><br>More importantly, where is Deku's dad?</br></br>  <br> sadrock is happy <br>The miracle of one year of serialization</br></br>  <br>He has an extra joint in his pinky toe, which is the sign that no mutation has occured.<br>And if you knew a bit about biology, you'd know that even if both your parent have the same trait, you're not sure to have it too.</br></br>  <br>The sheer amount of gayness from that. What would he do with a quirk that lets small object float and what does his dad do? Breath fire here and there, that would be BS to give deku definitely now</br>  <br><br>No one with a quirk has the second pinkie toe bone.<br><br>Surprised no one noticed during the cavalry battle.<br><br><br><br>He's Jack from the MHA oneshot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Get hype.</br>  <br> Stain: This pleases me greatly. </br>  <br>He is a shonen cliché'd dad</br>  <br>Boner</br>  <br><br> deku saves the day again while everyone remains useless except kacchan and flameice kid </br></br>    <br> Flameboy getting serious, using his fire powers. <br>Noice.</br></br>  <br>anyone else getting hisoka vibes?</br>  <br>Awesome</br>  <br>Hey, Todoroki changed his costume. I guess he isn't all right now.</br>  <br>Is that a new costume I see?</br>  <br>TMNT's Villain is happy.</br>  <br><br>Honestly, Deku and Todoroki should obliterate Stain. He doesn't have the agility to dodge both their attacks. <br><br>Honestly, he shouldn't be able to react to iida or deku since both them can move at superhuman speeds.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No one noticed because it's not common knowledge they only knew about the pinky toe because they went to a specialist.</br></br>  <br>great. so the fight isn't even going to be completed this chapter.<br>let me guess next weeks cliffhanger, a 3rd hero comes to save the day at the last minute repeat ad infinitum</br></br>  <br>So it's confirmed that Shouta went Endeavour right ?<br>Also<br> Over-confident kid looking at his phone mid fight <br>God I hate that</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>What a loving smile</br>  <br><br>Yes, someone please explain this to me. How is stain reacting to Iida and apparently Deku? Isn't his ability immobilizing people only? He doesn't have super agility.</br></br>  <br> Deku on Iida's shoulders  <br><br>Why does this make me so happy and so sad?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>don't think too much, its just an average shounen manga</br></br></br>  <br>He's just a bad ass<br><br>I mean, eraserhead doesn't have super agility, but I'm sure he could still hang with iida/deku</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't, but his powerlevel is high enough to react to these amateurs.</br>  <br><br>It's more with both of them being inexperienced than him having super reflexes or something like that. I mean, Stain already fought a lot of heroes with all kinds of quirks, even Ingenium, so for him reading/predicting his enemies is easy, even more if said enemy is a kid that has no intent of killing someone.</br></br>  <br><br>Then explain how he reacted to Iida's brother who is certainly not an amateur nor a shit hero.</br></br>  <br>He beat countless heroes and is a massive threat, don't think of him as if he was a normalfag.</br>  <br>Surprise attack.<br><br>Ingenium only have human-like reaction speed.</br></br></br>  <br>People in BNHA seem to have drastically increased natural limits.<br>Even miina and uraraka were getting like olympic level results in the sports test thing and they're just kids and todoroki is supposedly more physically strong than base deku.</br></br>  <br>This is how fights in comics and shounen work:<br>1. Villain wins and gloats( AM SO STRONK. LET ME TELL U ME EVIL PLAN. )<br>2. Hero activates his trick card( MUH FRIENDSHEEEP/MUH SCRET POWER/MUH PLAN/MUH TRICK)<br>3. Villain loses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and tail bro's only power is having a tail but he still made it to the second round of the competition</br>  <br> Todoroki chose to go with his Father over Superman </br>  <br>Shouto wants to get over his Issues so it's probably the best thing to do.

And that 100% in one finger sent it over 700 meters (same as kacchan's). <br><br>I don't think I need to say this, but that is absurd. The best way of throwing a ball is to use your whole body, with hips and waist and shoulders being especially important.

From his previous works the dude isn't one of those mangaka who likes love triangles and shit.<br><br>People keep misinterpreting Kohei being good enough to write in subtle personality changes and quirks for shipping. Yeah, Tsuyu might like Deku and Aizawa. Thing is, everyone in the class likes Deku. And it's natural that Tsuyu would be more concerned with Aizawa's condition (she's the first to ask about his condition after the USJ attack ends, and she's the first to say that she's happy he's out of his bandages) when he's the guy that saved her from having her head popped like a ripe tomato.<br><br>Like the most obvious pairing is one Kohei himself says on Ochako's description page. He likes pairing her with Deku. Tada. Done. The MC will get the female lead if he gets anybody and that's fine. Shounen tradition.<br><br>Bakugou however is tsundere as fuck to the point that even I wonder if that nigga's gay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's smiling because  the manga she's in is celebrating it's first anniversary </br>  <br><br> 1 year already <br>B-But it feels like It just started a few weeks ago</br></br></br>  <br>Not confirmed, but since Gran Torino was acting like using it 100% all over was the right way to go, I think that is the case. <br><br>An important thing to note is that the only reason Deku thought of only using it in one spot was because he always saw All Might do like a crazy strong punch or kick.</br></br></br>  <br>Man how awesome would that be, if Baku actually turns out to have the hots for Deku but after its revealed its never mentioned again.</br>  <br>Wait, how did Deku get slashed?</br>  <br><br> Deku texted Todo to get his ass over there. <br><br>Half the class is gonna show up next chapter too.

He obsesses with Deku because he is the weakest person he knows, and guys like him need to tear down weak people to feel better.</br>  <br><br>Have we been reading the same manga?</br></br>  <br>Deku really loves that overhead punch attack.

Should it please you." Holy shit you're right.<br/> <br> But the way I saw it, the doll was actually something similar to the moon presence, because once you kill the moon presence, the dream and the hunt should all die, but its still there, with only two people (well, two beings) still left, you as a squid baby and the doll. </br></br>  <br> so deku is todo husbando now? <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>If that happens I can imagine Stain just rage quitting after being cockblocked for the nth time.</br>  <br>Whose to say that it's just because of an inferiority complex. I think being attracted to someone who you think is below you would just make things worse.<br><br>  Though I agree with you Kacchan's reaction is just because of an inferiority complex.  </br></br></br>  <br>seeing as it's a celebration, and a formal event at that, Deku is the best dressed, as his outfit most matches a Tux.</br>  <br>Him and All Might</br>  Objectively right now todoroki when using both his sides he is on a whole other level than deku and i find it logical that he's the one to battle stain instead of deku because right now deku can't do shit.  <br> best dressed <br> wearing a fucking backpack <br>He's a dork, that's it.</br></br></br>  <br>a bowtie, backpack and a elbow pad.<br>because a prom isnt an excuse to stop being tacticool.</br></br>  <br>SADROCK IS PINK?!</br>  <br> Shouji showing off his guns even in a suit <br>Dayum boi</br></br>  <br>more like sadflesh, right?<br><br> if he was just a big gross mass of flesh it would be disgusting </br></br></br>  <br>No, this arc was horribly planned out.

Seems to be pretty easy since it's only a vice admiral  <br>they werent there yet?</br>  <br><br>I really hope Kaido turns out to be the former second division captain of the Whitebeard pirates. I wanna know more about Whitebeard's past.</br></br>  <br>then they should have set sail earlier. <br>Probably marco alone would have been able to fly on that ship and steal it. <br>Enspecially since noone in the world of one piece is able to hit a target with canon balls</br></br></br>  <br>he's not going to, because its not true.</br>  <br>I would presume they didn't have the intel to know which fleet was transporting ace so they just waited to strike where they knew he'd be.<br><br>Also I feel like whitebeard was trying to send a message to the world government by attacking marine ford. "This is what happens when you fuck with my family." "I will strike anywhere, no one is safe." That sort of thing. Too bad it kinda back fired a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I think its just a straw hat, jim.</br>  <br>What people fail to understand is that the whole Marineford War was nothing but a display of power from both sides.<br>The Marines could've easily killed Ace on spot yet they decided to give him a public execution to show the world that they're not afraid of a Yonko.<br>Whitebeard could have rescued Ace from Impel Down too yet he decided to challenge the Marines head on to show the world what messing with a Yonko's close subordinate will cause to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>b..but anon, why would someone tell lies on the internetz?</br>  <br>You are not even a fish, you are a fucking fat whale dropping right on my boat. Gotta feed all the village.</br>  <br>Why are they so happy about seeing semen?</br>  <br>how were they to know though?<br><br>for all they knew, Ace was already at Marineford</br></br></br>  <br>Who on earth would do such a thing?</br>  <br> Poor gunnery <br>Probably not Odas intention, but that's actually historically accurate. Gunnery sucked. 2% hits was ungodly accurate.</br></br>  <br>Gin<br><br>Johnny and Yosaku</br></br></br>  <br><br>That isn't CP9</br></br>  <br> Big Mom/Kaidou War Saga <br><br>Fuck, I will have to search all the archives to find my "you heard it here first"</br></br></br>  <br>Gin is with the Heart Pirates, that was already shown.</br>   Robin joined after Alabasta <br> we'll never see her in belly dancer outfit </br>  So is there no issue this week?  <br>why do you THINK a bunch of Daddy's boys would be happy about a bowl of semen?</br>  <br>i was thinking about that too. However, It seemed so important to him that ace gets away alive that he could have just free'd him in impel down/ on the way to marine ford and then go to marine ford anyway just to fuck them up.</br>  <br>No, next week yes.</br>  <br>No. Oda died in a car crash. I am sorry.</br>  <br>Or next week.</br>    <br>read the last page of the recent chapter</br>   All this speedfaggotry <br><br><br>Only Marine vessels can sail the Tarai current.<br><br><br><br>Only Marine vessels can sail the calm belt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gin is Japanese for Silver <br> He's Rayleigh's brother. </br></br>  <br>It wouldn't have the same effect on the public opinion though. <br><br>Marco can fly</br></br></br>  <br>Marco could have just put Whitebeard, Jozu and Vista in a box then flew with them all the way to Impel Down</br>  <br>To where? Being able to fly does not give you GPS.</br>  <br>Birds actually have an internal gps.</br>  <br>so Whitebeard and his fleet were able to get right into marine ford but a couple 100 meters before marine ford was not doable for them? <br><br>They could simply wait on the other side of the gate of justice till it opens</br></br></br>  <br> Show proof</br>  How or why is Robin losing this much? Didn't expect Boa's votes to be this high. I thought people would favor Nami or something. Or did they like her outfit better?<br><br>Holy fuck, Law. I didn't think the results would be this far from Ace. How is Zoro losing to Barto?<br><br>Maybe it's because I assumed people would be voting for the character instead of the jeans they're wearing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They could've sailed with their ships just a few miles away from Impel Down through navigable waters and then fly there</br>  <br> two members of Whitebeard's crew becoming yonkou <br>Can't say I agree.</br></br>    <br>Also, daily reminder that Law a slut.</br>  <br>Well I agree on this one, thou, they were probably too late for any kind of hijacking, even with a flying type user.</br>  <br><br><br>Brava</br></br></br>  Reminder.  <br>horny jap boys vote for boa, because one piece characters say shes beauty incarnate, so they just agree without actually looking and seeing that theres hotter women in the op world.</br>  <br>because no tan</br>    <br>No tan?</br>  <br>stop posting this image</br>  <br><br> Robin lowest of them all, even lower than Rebacca  <br> Zoro and Ace are lower than ''Just cuck my shit up Sanji'' and ''I love the guy who mollested me as a child'' Law </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>My stash needs more of these pictures. Why isn't there a thread on /cm/ dedicated to this sexiness?</br></br></br>  <br>tan robin &gt; no tan robin</br>  <br>She's still pretty hot with or without the tan, I think.<br><br><br>Ace even went shirtless and all that. The hell happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean "I hate her because she looks like my childhood friend" Zoro and "I will make all my father and brother's efforts of saving me go to waste because this bastard mocks my father's name" Ace.</br>  <br>Never<br><br> and ''I love the guy who mollested me as a child'' Law <br>How dare you impugn gay mime's honor</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kid-Luffy-Law friendship is cute. But I wouldn't like all of the Supernovas to be friends immediately. Maybe eventually, but not immediately. I need the The Law-Luffy alliance to fight the Kid-Hawkins-Apoo alliance.</br>  <br>I want Kid to get mugiwara'd REALLY hard but I doubt he'd take their shit<br><br>Apoo would roll with it and fit in faster than Bon did.

Such a shame.</br>  <br> Why the fuck is he so constantly obsessed with sex <br> and not only that, Law also seems to be traumatised <br> What are those guys speaking <br> Say, those people doesn't look like parent and child <br> i think he's a kidnapper </br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Robin so ugly?  <br> If you see that way, ooh he's forcing children to suck </br>  I'm still curious, do Luffy and Zoro mean mean Teach and his crew or just Teach alone by 'it's they'?<br><br>Isn't there the theory that Teach is somehow 2 people or something and can therefore use 2 devil fruits?</br></br>  <br>Mainly that he's a chimera or so.</br>  <br>They were aware of his crew</br>  <br>It's pretty obvious Luffy and Zoro mean Teach, Nami even asks where his companions are to clarify that they're referring to Teach as 'they' not his crew. (I'm not even sure if BB even had a crew at this point in time.)</br>  <br> I'm not even sure if BB even had a crew at this point in time <br>He already got Jesus, Auger, Doc Q, and Laffitte in Jaya. But yeah, Luffy and Zoro didn's seem to know they're his companion.</br></br>  <br>Luffy and Law will take Kaido down, not Moria.<br><br> Moria will take Kaido's shadow after his defeat. </br></br></br>  <br>maybe they were just respecting his choice of pronouns, you shitlord</br>  <br><br>Let me guess you guys believe in the retarded cerberus theory too?</br></br>  Wheres the chapter?  <br>And maybe Roger and Newgate just trolled everyone with One Piece bullshit.</br>  <br>No chapter this week.</br>  <br>This  post has nothing to do with any cerberus. It is in Thriller Bark.</br>  <br> like Bart or Bellamy <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>he probably has conjoined twin or something</br>  <br>I believe the 'multiple people' bit of the cerberus theory, I used to believe in the whole thing until I remembered that blackbeard used claws to fight in his WB crew days which is likely how he caused shanks that claw-shaped scar.</br>  <br>But this theory has been proven wrong because Blackbeard held a wolverine like claw weapon in the past.</br>  "Lick it, anon."  Daily reminder that Zoro and Robin is a thing.  <br>"But babe theres soap on it, i'll have diarreah wipe that shit off first."</br>  <br> dat Perona <br>HNNNNNNNNNNNNNGH</br></br>  <br>I used to ship this, honestly.</br>  <br>I feel like they'd be more of a bootycall for each other.<br><br>Like if Franky is too busy building big ass ships and Tashigi is polishing other swords then ZoBin would be doing the nasty.</br></br></br>  This is the best canon outfit for Robin, followed by her Thriller Bark outfit. You can't prove me wrong.  <br>They're the only couple that would even make sense in the crew.</br>  <br><br>you mean Franky and Robin</br></br>  <br> Teach's crew are revealed as a whole right after this <br>Oh I dunno, context clues maybe?</br></br>  How lucrative must be it be to a bounty hunter in OP? Just capture a bunch of no-name bum pirates and you're swimming in millions of Beri. Unless inflation in OP is weimar germany-tier where a few million only gets you a loaf of bread or some shit.  <br>There's still the 'Teach has a special body' thing that Marco said.<br>Before that I also thought the crew was meant, but I wasn't so sure afterwards.</br></br>  <br> They'd be more of a bootycall for each other <br><br>I have no problem with this. Except for the Franky and Tashigi part.</br></br></br>  <br> Franky and Tashigi part <br><br>Why? They're literally made for each other.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm totally with you. Oda often finds things to hide under a guise of the obvious but on the other hand it sounds like classic looking too much into it.<br><br>At the end of the day, there isn't really enough to go on and it's pointless really debating it until we know a hell of a lot more. In all honesty, I doubt it. Fun theory though.</br></br></br>  Interesting article on the possibilities of the true underlying story of One Piece. Goes pretty deep.<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/<br><br>Not really a big fan of the One Piece Podcast but they come out with some interesting shit some times.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Mostly personal preference. I don't like Tashigi, honestly. And I like Zoro. And I'm not shipping a character I like with a character I don't like.<br><br>As for Franky and Robin, I just don't feel their chemistry. Maybe it's there, but it just won't hit me. Same with the Luffy and Nami ship that's so popular. I tried but couldn't really ship it.</br></br></br>  <br>"It came from the moon" prediction is nowhere near deep, I liked oro jackson's one piece theory more until that moment which he said Smoker would be the last member, i dropped after that and led to the conclusion that every one piece fan theory is utterly shit </br>  <br>Already posted here m8  but I agree it's really well written</br>  <br>i think nami paid 100 belly for a news paper once, so it's not as much as a million $ but still decent.</br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br>He makes a pretty compelling argument from the clues we've got. It's one of the better fan theories out there. Mainly because he isn't over assuming too much and only taking things as written<br><br><br>Zach definitely writes better than he fucking talks</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You need to be more specific in your questions anon....are you thinking of pic related?<br><br><br>I don't listen to the podcast because all they talk about is retarded shit like merchandise that no one cares about. But I do love the hints he found on Punk Hazard with Uranus and Elbaf.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but I'm wondering what the possible correlation would be, other than random ancestor souls inside the Fruits.</br>  <br> hints he found on Punk Hazard with Uranus and Elbaf <br><br>Not the person you're talking to but could you share what hints?</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck do they need a ship.<br><br>Ships doesn't matter.<br><br>They are pirates so they most likely slay the poose on the couch, the floor, the kitchen, outside.<br>They fuck wherever they want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/#Uranus<wbr><br><br>I'd bet money on this one.<br><br><br>It's good when they get Stephen on, someone who actually understands One Piece translation better than anyone and Greg. Even if Greg is an insufferable twat.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>As I've said, it's more of a personal preference. I just answered a question. If you think they don't need a ship then that's well and good. Go on and live life that way.</br>  <br>Anon I'm not spoonfeeding you, literally just copy pasta the link and click the Uranus section and it's right there.<br><br><br>The connection is that devil fruits most likely originally grew on trees, since in the original romance dawn Luffy's fruit came from the rubber tree, and the fact that artificial fruits in the factory needed trees to grow. And if we use bible logic it's likely the Adam and Eve trees grew devil fruits originally, especially when you consider that special sunlight flowers were needed in pic related and the Eve tree just happens to be called the Sunlight Tree Eve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You stupid anon?</br>  <br>Anon forget about him. <br><br>Can you spoonfeed me instead?</br></br></br>  <br>See  he was nice enough to spoonfeed you plebs</br>  <br>Well sure but "DFs originally grew on trees" doesn't sound like much to make a major theory over.</br>  <br><br>While your at it, continue down and read the stuff about the Volume 27 cover. I really think that theory might have legs as well. Old as hell but is just as strong today.</br></br>  <br>That's not spoonfeeding you useless fuck.<br><br>I'm not clicking that sketchy ass link.<br>You stupid or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see it, Luffy what does Luffy winking and having winks have to with anything?</br>  <br><br><br> Many explorers during the Age of Discovery first set out to the seas thinking that the world existed on a flat plane. <br><br>DROPPED.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is reading? </br>  <br>I've read it but it's not even a theory, he's basically stating what we already know.</br>  <br>I'm a fan of her Punk Hazard outfit</br>  <br>About him being half Moon?<br><br>How did we already know that?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You were saying magma brat?</br></br>  <br>Because not everyone is a speedreader</br>  <br> speedreader <br>I've been reading the manga for about 10 years buddy. Read through the entire thing about 4 or 5 times.<br><br>At no point is it ever explicitly mentioned about the D being a pictogram rather than a letter. The theory only got around in English when Greg posted it about 5 years ago. It's a popular theory but don't pretend that it's more explicit than that. I just really think that there's something to it. Greg even said a little while ago that when he wanted to mention this theory on his one-piece.com column, it was rejected for possibly getting a little too close to the truth. The only time anything he'd ever had anything censored.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chill mate I was just baiting, that's interesting that it got censored though.</br>  Did anyone else notice the in pic related that for 10 million beri you can get a female,bifurcated mermaid? Who the fuck would buy a mermaid split in half?  <br>So the only thing Ace accomplished by ignoring whitebeards warning is to get whitebeard killed while getting killed himself.<br><br>What a great guy</br></br></br>  <br>Greg's about as close to this shit as it gets. He's even met and spoken to Oda about a few things himself. Interestingly, when he met him last he gave him a boxset of Game of Thrones. He got really into it and it's thought that it influenced the lion symbol on the shields that Capone's men were holding a few chapters back.<br><br>It's funny if the Volume 27 cover does turn out to be a major hint though. The book came out 12 and a half years ago, millions of people have seen it, he outright told you the what the D is and almost no one noticed.<br><br>Motherfucker does it all the time. Most recently was probably hiding a picture of Rosinante in the Marines, a year and a half before he turned up in the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but w-what is the D then?</br>  <br>What like Kokoro? Not all of them are that fucking ugly.<br><br>That's fairly cheap considering</br></br></br>  <br>What the hell?<br><br>What am I supposed to be looking at?<br>Where's the D?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still think that Davy Jones will be related to the D somehow, wouldn't be surprised if he's the main character of Void Century flashback</br>  Was this ever explained somewhere?  <br><br>Remember, Greg now writes for V-Jump and the columns on the official Japanese One Piece website (which are in English as well). The only time he had something rejected was when he was mentioning something about this.</br></br>  <br>I was thinking that they got a mermaid,split the human and fish bits and then sold it. I thought it was pretty dark for OP because it's a fairly comedic shonen.</br>  <br>Yeah they used the barrels as replacement diving suits.<br><br>The long rope looking thing is for them to breathe air so they don't drown.<br>Also Luffy needed 2 barrels because he's a norokshuki user.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh goddamn that's scary<br><br>What was it rejected from?</br></br></br>  <br>What's there to explain? It's just exploring a ship.</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't this a picture of Vivi's mother? <br>Am I imagining things?</br></br></br></br>  <br>WWAIT SO LUFFY IS A SKYPEIAN SO THAT MEANS DORAGON MADE LOVE TO SOME CHICK WITH WINGS?<br><br>WHERE HE BEEN HIDING HIS WINGS THE WHOLE TIME?<br><br>HOLY SHIT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Entirely possible, but since the tail splitting is actually a thing in the One Piece world, I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to that.<br><br><br>His column<br>https://one-piece.com/special/greg/<wbr><br><br>He's a pretty big deal over there these days. TV appearances and all sorts of shit. Get's noticed out in public all the time. Word is that the rejection came from fairly high up.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes because the ship is way older than that</br>  <br>This theory makes too much sense for it to not be true, when this comes true I can finally be one of those faggots saying 'called it 10 years ago mane'</br>  <br>Quack?</br>  <br>Oh wow that's pretty interesting then. Are there any other major theories that have pretty solid evidence behind them?</br>  <br>Oh also how is Shanadora part of the giant kingdom?</br>  <br>That doesn't make any sense as it would suggest that every D. has a "earth"- parent and a "moon"-parent which is obviously not the case. One can argue that the D. was given to the children and so on because it's lost it's true meaning, but that would make luffy himself not that much releated to the moon people as his blood came from the all the mixing beforehand, making him not a real half-earth/half-moon human. The closest thing to a half-moon boy would be garp in luffy's family making luffy having the D. basically meaningless.</br>  <br> Word is that the rejection came from fairly high up. <br>Elaborate pls</br></br>  <br>See  </br>  <br> As for Franky and Robin, I just don't feel their chemistry <br>Maybe because you're a ZoRobin faggot.</br></br>  <br>And Oda fucking told us in 2003.<br><br>That guy is laughing at everyone. So fucking good at giving us so many details that we just gloss over. Let's be honest, before last week, no one had noticed the crow motif with the Revolutionaries but it's been there for years<br><br><br>Pretty much everything in that OPP article. There isn't anything else that is actually THAT solid but some really strong theories kicking about to do with the Void Century, the weapons and the shape of the world.<br><br>The article ends with a really fucking strong idea of what One Piece might be which never really occurred to me before.<br><br><br>Descendants. Not half, exactly but the idea is he's got the blood of the ancients in him. Works so far. Everyone in the Monkey family so far has it.<br><br>What's quite funny is that Teach's D might actually be a letter D.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the link anon. I'll check it out soon.<br><br>Can you link me to the other theories, primarily about the Century and the world's shape? I'd be real interested in those.</br></br></br>  <br> What's quite funny is that Teach's D might actually be a letter D. <br><br>I'm willing to give Oda the benefit of the doubt about a lot of things but the interaction between WB and BB during Marineford really made BB seem a lot less interesting. His role as being basically Luffy but a villain was a nice spin on what you usually see in Shounen. To have him start grovelling for his life and to be afraid of losing it kind of soured me on him in general. It's especially bad when you consider how big into Fate the BB pirates are.</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno really what more there is to say. The article rejection came from fairly high up the line. That's all that he's said really.<br><br>I imagine it means something like, not my boss but my bosses boss declined it. If it was anyone else, I'd say that it could be nothing but since it's come from Greg - I'd be inclined to think that his feelings about it skirting too close to the truth has some weight to it. That guy is fucking connected. He knows the short term game plan for the upcoming story.<br><br><br>I don't really know any solid articles on the subjects but for the world's shape - I'm not the best person to explain this but I'll give it a go as best as I can.<br><br>There's a popular theory that the Void Century is basically the WG reshaping the world, using the weapons and possibly Oars (the continent puller) to reshape the world in their image. For what reasons? I dunno. To hide something, to cover something up. Something about the war that Clover mentioned.<br><br>It basically explains the bizarre state of the world and the fact that the magnetic structure of the Grand Line is completely fucked up. Mainly because it shouldn't be. I mean needing a triple compass to navigate the fucking New World? Hiding whatever is to be found at Raftel by making it near impossible to navigate is definitely one way to do it. To our knowledge, it mostly worked for 800 years. Only the Roger pirates found it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought blackbeard being cowardly and a bitch was pretty interesting and different. Usually the big bad shounen villain is egotistical and smug,like aizen for example, until the very end but blackbeard is actually shown to be pretty human.</br>  <br>Oh that sounds really cool but kinda scary from the WG. Gonna be real interesting to see what all goes on towards the end.<br><br>I really like that One Piece is mostly 'original'.<br><br>Oh yeah, was pic related anything legit?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crocodile's look manly as fuck. Zoro's, Ace's and Kid's look the most practical and comfortable.</br>  <br>That theory in your pic is absolutely retarded and is entirely speculation, or more like fan fiction.</br>  <br>Nah not at all.<br><br>Robin's importance in the story has been known since Enies Lobby. At all costs, she cannot die or the truth of the world dies with her. She's the last person alive who can read the language and unless Luffy learns to tap into this 'hearing all voices' power that Roger could properly then there's absolutely no chance of finding the true history. What you have there is just fanfiction with a sprinkling of wishful thinking.<br><br>The OPP theory on Uranus being linked to Elbaf is really good but it's got no weight to it in the story as yet. Just a potential easter egg in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Robins' shoe.</br></br>  <br>That picture doesn't fit with her backstory at all. go back and read it. Robin was extremely smart and avoided death several times. Crocodile wanted her because she could read the poneglyphs not because she was a fucking super weapon. i know you didn't write that but it triggered my autism</br>  <br><br>Figured as much. Saw it lying in my folder.<br><br>Is there anything highly regarded involving the 'Voice' that we know of yet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No arguments here. Objectively the best design of the character.</br>  Was that just a bad translation (ambition) or the first mention of Haki?  <br> Is there anything highly regarded involving the 'Voice' that we know of yet? <br>Whose voice ? I'm not really sure what you're talking about, here.</br></br>  <br>Voice of All Things</br>  <br>If you're buying a sex slave might as well make sure you have a hole to put it in.</br>  <br> he's not interested in small fries <br><br>So he only likes medium or large fries?<br>What a fatso.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if Luffy knew how to hear the poneglyphs he wouldn't understand with his 13 year old mind.</br>  <br>Really a stupid theory, we've been given a blatant, gripping, and very good reason for the government wanting Nico Robin on two levels. One is that most poneglyphs contain instructions for superweapons the government would enjoy having, and the other is that the World Government's stability is based on censoring 100 years of history only she can read.</br>  <br> Voice of All Things <br>Oh that power of Roger and Luffy ? Always thought that it was the mix of CoC and being a D that allowed them to hear the "voice of all things".</br></br>  <br>It's not a mistranslation</br>  <br>Don't you know mermaids are 'ornaments for the rich'? They're not sex slaves at all anon jeez, get your mind out the gutter.<br> <br>Seriously though, I know OP is a shonen but why not straight up call them sex slaves? It's not like most readers don't know what those shady nobles are going to do with beautiful slaves. They're not gonna fucking frame them are they?</br> </br></br>  <br> Luffy is a special snowflake <br><br>Dropped faster than a 2 year old riding a bike without any training wheels.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, that OPP article seems fairly strong. It's been checked through by both Greg and Stephen and doesn't really have any fanfiction tier assumptions. I think Fishman Island will be regarded in an entirely different light in a few years when more of the story comes through. There's so many 'bigger picture' elements to it than most people realise. The part with the Sea Kings at the end really makes a lot more sense with what the voice is and how it works.<br><br><br>Bad translation. The earliest mention of Haki by name is the Shanks/Whitebeard meeting. He actually means ambition there.<br><br><br>I think you miss the point.<br><br>It's not blatant exposition. It's more of a feeling. How many arcs has he beaten the main villain now without really knowing what's going on? He didn't hear about Nami's past with Arlong, he didn't see Chopper's flashback and really know what was going on in Drum, recently he didn't know the full history of Dressrosa - he just knows. It's about hearing the voice of all things. Feeling the history and problems. He somehow managed to connect with Kalgara and Noland 400 years apart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy <br>No. The D's as a whole. It's not exclusively Luffy. It's just not Teach.</br></br>  <br> Butt's waifu <br><br>Is that the face of guilty pleasure or am I just a naughty naughty anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but why might Teach not be a real D.?</br>  <br>Doesn't matter.<br><br>Luffy is still a special snowflake.<br>A stretchy special snowflake.</br></br></br></br>  You know, I was about to make a <br> you will never fuck Killer 7 <br>But I realize, this is probably one of the easiest cosplay to do.</br></br>  <br>despair, but also an erection.</br>  <br>Because Roger told Whitebeard what the D means and he figured out that he wasn't one. It's right before he dies</br>  <br> wanting to fuck a chick named Killer <br><br>Anon please stay safe and don't forget to bring some protection.</br></br></br>  So, Luffy. Yeah.<br><br>Who's the MoM?<br><br>Doesn't look like he has any Ivankov features on him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know Roger told him but how did he figure it out? Or I guess that's the real question then.</br>  <br>All we know is the answer, not the question.<br><br>I suppose it's obvious if you know.<br><br>Either way, it doesn't matter. He isn't. We've been told.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In that big theory link, right?</br>  <br>Luffys mom is Enel<br>Enel is from skypiea and his fruit is hard countered by luffy because a mother couldn't possibly harm her own child. Dragon likes his women slim and shady.</br></br>  <br>In my opinion, Whitebeard figured it out when Teach starting begging for his life that time.<br>The thing we've seen in common with all D's except Teach is that they die smiling. Roger, Saul, Ace all died with a smile on their face. Teach looked as if he was going to shit himself.</br></br>  <br>Whiteboard told me telephatically right before he died in his gay dream with his gay crew that Teach is the 'D.'arkside of the D.<br><br>He's a true 'D.' but his special luck isn't helping out others but its actually fucking the world around him and its not necessarily a bad thing either.<br><br>Teach is the Yin to Luffy's Yang so there has to be balance.<br>Teach is the balance.<br><br>Holy fucking SHIT i'm a fucking genius.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What?<br><br>All we've got is what Whitebeard said. How he knows isn't important but Roger knew we saw him start to explain to Whitebeard in a flashback.<br><br>Whitebeard knew what the D meant and he knew that Teach couldn't possibly be a true D because of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot pic.</br>  <br> slim and shady <br><br>You're a funny guy.</br></br></br>  <br>That would actually explain that totally.</br>  <br>Sorry but, Whitebeard is my dad and he said that the 'D' in Marshal D Teach is  The Heart </br>  Why didn't Dragon attack Mariejois, when he knew all of the marines naval power was amassing at marineford?  <br> not wanting to fuck Killer <br>Don't you get it?<br><br> her long golden hair flailing wildly as you pound deeper into her <br> her long toned legs, built from running, jumping, kicking and fighting gripping you tighter as you go <br> the buildup of sweat leaking out of her helmet as she growls, snarls, and moans in that minor echo you only get wearing a helmet <br> while your hands were initially holding back her arms with their blade contraptions, she's since started to focus on the ride, and has relaxed, so you move your hands down those slender arms, relaxing in a bed of beautiful golden locks, and rest your hands on her helmet <br> you grasp her body and helmet, that slender powerful figure, that rough metal helmet, and one of your pinky fingers slips through the holes <br> she adjusts her head, and you can't tell whether it's just condensation or she's started to lick and suckle on your finger, reaching in her headcage for that extra level of intimacy <br> you grasp her helmet harder as you climax with her, as her whole body shakes and spasms with it, her armblades tearing up the ground around you both, barely missing you and her locks, while her legs totally embrace you like a lover's arms <br> as you lay collapsed on her, breathing heavily with her, she places her arms, carefully, around you, and locks you both to the frame with her sickles <br> you're not getting up for a while, but frankly you don't want to </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Friendly reminder Luffy wants a bronze statue.</br>  <br>The revs don't wage war they inspire other countries to wage war and free themselves.</br>  <br>You so stupid.<br><br><br>Doesn't matter I didn't even read that wall of text.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because that would defeat the purpose of the Revolution.</br></br>  <br>The 'secret' at Mariejois that makes everyone scared as fuck of the celestial dragons? The real question is why dragon himself can't just Solo the marines. He's probably got some wind logia/weather control DF that can just fuck shit up easily from a distance. Who needs an organization when you're gangster?</br>  <br>tl;dr</br>   doffy scared as fuck by kaido and willing to take orders from law to not get any shit from him <br> rufy can barely defeat him blowing the secret timeskip training weapon and still needed the help of trafalgar "lol only 9mm" d law,100ish experienced fighters and fujitora not doing his job <br><br>how can rufy even think to be a match for kaido/mom yet</br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo is yonkou-tier</br>  Anyone have that three part ms paint comic with "anime in the beginning, a bit later, and now"? I need it for research purposes.  <br><br> blowing the secret timeskip training weapon <br><br>Just wait as he pulls more 'secret' weapons out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop this nonsense, Anon!</br>  <br> rufy </br>  <br>sorry ken sama i don't speak nihongo enough to know the correct transliteration of names<br> i actually call him "rubber" because i started with the anime </br></br>  <br>the correct romanized name is Rufi</br>  <br>I always interpreted that as Blackbeard just trying to make Whitebeard hesitate. I don't see him as the type to genuinely fear death, although he is the type to fake being a D. so I dunno.<br><br>I hope he's a D. It would seem too contrived for every D. to be a good guy.</br></br></br>  What happened to Robin's giant turtle?    <br>That's only because the Japanese alphabet has no L sound<br>it is, and always has been, Luffy even in the untranslated graphic novels.</br></br>    <br>I agree, with the full wallpaper</br>  <br>I thought R and L simply are the same in japanese (with a bit of D mixed in). So it really doesn't matter if we write him Rufi or Lufi, because both will not quite match the way it is originally pronounced.</br>  <br>Luffy ate it.</br>  <br>Ok so I would like to know, how the hell would Whitebeard get to Impel Down?<br><br>Yes, he could enter the Tarai Current through Enies Lobby which was destroyed, but he'd still have to get someone to open the gates for him to Impel Down, and he'd then have to make an escape which would include going right by the entrance to Marineford<br><br>And this would obviously include a fuckload of Marine reinforcements from Marineford, which means he wouldn't likely make it out of the Tarai current alive</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128476325 <br>s-source?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128476325 <br>This is fucking scary.</br>  <br>No idea, found it on Gelbooru.<br>The models are from One Piece: Pirate Warriors, so maybe it was made using SFM?</br></br>  Has oda named a successor if he can't finish one piece? <br><br>like how miura has kubo</br></br>  <br> like how miura has kubo <br>you mean like every mangaka has kubo as plan B</br></br>  <br>It was stated by Nyon that pirates take an extended detour to get to Impel Down, was it not? The reason Luffy HAD to enter the current was to get to Marineford fast since the current links the three facilities. <br><br>Like Enies Lobby, Impel Down is not completely walled in. As long as you can deal with sea kings, you can reach Impel Down (as Alvida stated when the Buggy Pirates considering rescuing Buggy)</br></br></br>  So I was rereading fishman island and came across this page. What clan are they referring to? Water 7 maybe?  <br><br>pic sums up my ramblings more clearly. Impel Down is located within the Calm Belt but is not sealed off from the world, the only purpose of the current is to get there faster and to get between facilities faster (which is why Luffy needed to go through the gate to get to Marineford)</br></br>  <br> like how miura has kubo <br><br>what</br></br></br>   The last time we saw Chopper, Sanji and Brook was on December 2013. <br>When will Oda stop being an asshole and show us what's going on with them?</br>  <br>Isn't it the D's?</br>  <br>The fact that its in the calm belt means that it is sealed off, surely? How is Whitebeard supposed to get through the calm belt?</br>  <br>The context implies they want the clan to fix the ship for them. I'd have though so too, but nothing says the D's were great shipwrights.</br>  <br><br>Decided to do a little digging, the models were extracted and rigged using XNALara and animated in Blender.</br></br>  <br>I doubt the marines wouldn't have prepared for it as much as they did if they thought it impossible, even if WB took the current to get in, he'd still enter the Calm Belt at some point.<br><br>The Calm Belt is a deterrent, but I doubt Sea Kings are enough to stop a Yonkou and his entire crew, hell, Rayleigh swam through the Calm Belt.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck no, they don't have the L sound and can't pronounce stuff, doesn't mean Luffy stops being the official name since it's not a japanese word to begin with.</br>  <br>yeah when miura dies kubo will be taking up berserk <br><br>enjoy your backgrounds while you can</br></br></br>  <br>If we go by the theory that the D clans origins are the moon people, I'm sure they are good engineers considering they came to "earth" from the fucking moon.</br>  <br>My thinking was more in terms of propulsion and navigation than about the sea monsters. The calm belt is supposed to have no wind and no currents. Also, impel down probably doesn't show up on a log pose. I've always imagined the calm belt as being more immensely impractical rather than being a danger because of the sea kings. Maybe thats just me though.</br>  Where the fuck did the marines get Fujitora and Green Bull/Ryokugyu from? They're both admirals and implied to strong as fuck but for some reason they weren't at marineford or foreshadowed at all? <br><br>Did Akainu just happen to pull 2 admiral-tier individuals out of his ass, what the fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Considering how pirate flags in OP have usually depicted the captain, flag of Blackbeard should not be overlooked.</br></br>  <br>They were drafted</br>  <br>Whitebeard would need the special kind of ships that the Marines or the Kuja Pirates had to get his entire fleet through the Calm Belt, or paddle his entire fleet through there, which I'd imagine that'd be a massive bitch with the Sea Kings also there<br><br>But he didn't have those special ships, so there was no way for him to go through the Calm Belt and get to Impel Down<br><br>So he'd have to go through he Tarai current, which would have been harder than attacking Marineford head on</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes he did. There are plenty of strong people in the world of One Piece who are not pirates or marines.</br></br>  <br>From where though? There's no way it could be a draft from inside the marines seeing as every strong marine was at marineford and it seems like a waste to not have an additional 2 people at the level of admirals helping out.</br>  <br>2 years passed anon, that is a long time in One Piece</br>  <br>He could be from the national military of one of the countries affiliated with the WG. Most of them probably have their own standing armies.</br>  <br>the Tarai current empties into the calm belt though. Nothing about the current circumvents having to enter the calm belt.</br>  <br><br>Maybe parasitic triplets?<br>Have we ever seen Blackbeard without his shirt on?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh shit, I forgot about all the countries allied with the WG, now it actually makes sense as to where they actually got them from.</br></br></br>  <br>In the jaya arc he was pretty much not wearing a shirt, the only things covered were his back and upper arm and I doubt there's something there. Where do parasitic triplets usually show?</br>  <br><br>anywhere that is the point of a draft. It probably went down like this.<br><br> Akainu or some high up greet fujitora <br> offers him a position <br> he refuses <br> they tell him he can gamble all he wants <br> accepts <br> notices 7 sea lords are corrupt as fuck <br> decides to stay in and tear the system down </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora could very well be from Wano, look at that kimono.<br><br><br> Where do parasitic triplets usually show? <br>It could be anywhere, inside or outside the body.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>didn't we see him shirtless when he got the antidote for Magellan's poison?</br>   OP threads at this time <br> good discussion <br> not much retarded discussions <br> no shitposters <br> no fake sjws <br> no samefags roleplaying <br> no fujoshi shitposting <br> no dumb angry autists who can't into english <br> no illiterates <br> no newfags defending fujoshi <br> all of that is only late at night <br><br>So OP threads are only bad thanks to aussies, good to know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can show up anywhere, even inside the body.</br>  <br>"Times have changed" apparently. So they're probably talking about a clan that used to be good with stuff like this.</br>  <br>there is no chapter this week, normally the threads would be total cancer on this day</br>  <br>My point is Whitebeard intended for a quick full frontal war in Marineford, rescuing Ace, and then a quick escape back to Fishman Island<br><br>Attacking Impel Down would have been harder or even impossible, since Whitebeard would have had to row through the Calm Belt, or sail through Enies Lobby after making sure someone could open the gate for him at Impel Down<br><br>Could it have been done? Probably, but Whitebeard's crew wouldn't have made it home alive. Having to row back through the Calm Belt after fighting the Marines or going back into the Tarai Current, past the Marineford entrance, and to exit through Impel Down would have been much harder than attacking Marineford head on</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the cancer I pointed happens anyway and always late at night. No chapter just makes them louder and adds in a few more shitposters.</br>  <br>Funny, I've been reading up on such things recently.<br>In particular the case of a guy called Sanju Bhagat peaks my interest.<br><br>http://abcnews.go.com/Health/man-tw<wbr>in-living-inside-medical-mystery-cl<wbr>assic/story?id=2346476<br>http://www.vegmomos.com/pregnant-ma<wbr>n-of-twin/<br>Could be the real life blackbeard.</br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw Fujitora was the previous greatest swordsman <br> until Mihawk blinded him </br></br>  <br>What am I saying exit through Enies Lobby</br>  <br>I highly doubt it.</br>  <br>Oh, well I never argued that it was easier, just that the current isn't necessary for travel to and from Impel Down, nor is it possible to avoid entering the Calm Belt regardless of entry point.</br>  <br>What was Roger's jolly roger before he grew the moustache?</br>  <br> implying blinding a character in a shonen makes him weaker </br>  <br>I'd say either one with the straw hat or just a completely plain skull and crossbones.</br>  <br><br>He is literally Zatoichi the character so its highly likely he lost his sight due to illness.<br><br> Little of his past is revealed other than that he lost his sight as a child when he was around two years old through an illness. His father disappeared when he was about five years old, again for undisclosed reasons. He is described by his kendo instructor as having practiced constantly and with extreme devotion when he was a pupil to develop his incredible swordsmanship. Zatoichi says of himself that he became a yakuza (gangster) during those three years he spent training (which immediately precede the original The Tale of Zatoichi) and had killed many people then, something he later came to deeply regret. Despite that moral re-assessment, his new perspective and remorse (and most often because of them), he usually has a bounty on his head from one source or another throughout the movies and series. <br><br>if we could get a flashback or him coming back for wano that would be awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He has fucking scars right through the eyes m8.</br>    So which one will it be?  <br>Comes back as a cyborg or zombie and names the island Sniper Island.</br>  <br>There is something about his ears that bug me.<br><br>Also 1</br></br></br>  <br> There is something about his ears that bug me. <br><br>They're way too low.</br></br></br>  <br>All of the strawhats will return to their homeland before the final battle obviously. They probably tell there goodbye ones and then head to raftel again, because when they reach raftel there will probably be a time wuirk, so they have some freetime until they find out what the one piece is. Usopp will tell his whole village about his adventures then head back to raftel and die there</br>  <br><br>copyright retard.</br></br>  <br>Considering that 2 isn't a lie, 1.</br>  <br>Wait, which one is 1 and which 2? I read it right to left.</br>  <br><br>What are 1 and 2?<br>Left first or right first?<br><br>I really wish Usopp will die at the very end in an epic final battle screaming "I am Usopp, brave warrior of the seas!"<br>...and all the SH see him die and get a rage boost.<br><br>That would be just awesome  and would make me cry like a bitch <br><br>But him sailing all blue after red line is destroyed, telling the tales of Mugiwara and everyone calling him a liar, would also be quite nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded or are you retarded? Hancock is probably top 10 of hottest anime girls in history. Sure nami looks gud but Orange hair? Also her breasts are gross. But that's probably from them being in the sun all day. When was the last time she wore a shirt? Vivi looks nice but she's to sweet. She won't know how to please you in bed after the 2nd time. She won't know any tricks and I bet she doesn't suck dick. Fucking vivi is like fucking a Christian girl. theirs rebecca who is even worse than vivi. I bet she's been raped in the colloseum before. She is 16 by the way. She has a girl charm but not a woman charm. Perona is certainly very submissive but her legs are just ew. Both robin and vivi have better thighs. Now lets talk robin I'd say she is near Hancock tier but she lacks one thing. Sex frequency. Let's be real. Hancock would let luffy hit it every week if he wanted. But robin is one of those once in a while lets fuck. If her and franky or zoro became a thing the more years their relationship would last the less she'd want to Fuck. She just wants to be loved not fucked. Tashigi is a submissive girl who would cry when you stick it in. Youd have to whisper I'm sorry I'll be gentle and tell her sweet things for the whole fucking time you fuck her. Monet looked like a 10/10 girl but think about it. She has wings and talons. How do you shave your vagina with wings. Her potential is gone cuz she dead too. VA hina looks great with her new design. But she's hella dominant. You would have to be smoker level of alpha to dominant her and make her beg in that relationship. Now let's talk boa. Super submissive with some nice thighs. Down to do whatever you want and if you told her she needs to work on her skills she would spend all day in the lab figuring out what you want. She swallows and did I mention anal already? Plus if you told her ass to shave she will shave. She won't care if you don't. You could fucking pee in her armpits and she'd like it</br>  <br>this pic<br>exactly my reaction when reading  I didn't read it though  your shit</br></br>  So, the next nakama isn't even Jinbe, just some fag with an iron logia?<br><br>How does iron even work as a logia, anyway? Sounds more like a paramecia. Unless it's molten iron or something?</br></br>  <br> Her potential is gone cuz she dead too <br>I like how that part is almost an afterthought for you.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm sure they changed his face for copyright to have scars right throught the eyes but will have the same fucking origin as the source character anyway, retard.</br>  <br>what makes you think it will be an iron logia?<br>the 2-9 theory?<br><br>cause there's much more possibilities</br></br></br></br>  <br>People were mentioning it at the start of the thread.<br><br>Also what other possibilities are there?</br></br></br>  <br><br>1 is the first scenario that happened, i.e Left.<br><br>And I don't think Usopp would die. I think he and Zoro has the highest chance of living, actually.<br><br><br>Jinbe is pretty much a Strawhat already. And Logia's don't really have to be liquid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you find the supposed evidence that was supposedly in a thread a week ago or whatever ? Or will you believe me if I said Zoro kills Luffy in about 3 chapters ?</br>  <br>People were only mentioning it because some fag put some '100% true leaks' up that no one screenshotted or pasted. It's bullshit. Jinbei is pretty much confirmed next nakama anyway.<br><br>And Kinemon if he has the Fuku Fuku fruit which fits in the 2-9 theory.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and Kizaru will have the same origin as his actor too. Are you autistic or just pretending?</br>  <br>Sengoku's face is the greatest. Of all the things that happened in the war, just mentioning One Piece's existence was the thing that set him over the edge</br>  <br> Also what other possibilities are there? <br><br>Kuma and Kinemon are two.<br>I'm sure there's a lot more, I'm not a gook.<br><br><br> And Logia's don't really have to be liquid <br><br>No but they have to be intangible, and iron isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ice is intangible </br>  <br>No but cold is.<br>Ice is created through the generation of cold.</br></br>  I really Hate when Luffy is painted as dumb. Rash,reckless,blunt, and goofy are words to describe him but not dumb.  <br>Cold is not even a thing, it's just absence of heat.</br>  <br>What if Gin is with Bart?<br> both from East Blue <br> both worship a member of the Straw Hats <br> Gin needs a crew to sail with <br> funny juxtaposition between fanboy Bart and super serious Gin </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would ba an iron paramecia because it would be the same thing as jozu but weker</br>  <br>you're being picky<br>ice is intangible as portrayed by oda<br><br><br>darkness is not even a thing, it's just the absence of light</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> D: Why does Luffy have so little "tension"? <br><br> O: It must be because he's so stupid. </br></br></br>  <br> Luffy kills Zoro <br><br>No, but Zoro kills Kyros by accident. It was leaked on February and already confirmed to happen, go check it.</br></br></br>  <br>isn't daz bones kinda the iron paramecia?</br>  <br>Shut up</br>  <br> two characters that come closest to dying  <br> highest chances of living <br><br>not that I'm doubting you, just found that funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek what</br>  <br>That be nice too.</br>  <br><br>He has the blade blade fruit plus his blades are steel</br></br>  <br>But he is dumb.</br>  <br>Yeah that is a funny joke. But refresh my memory when is luffy actually portrayed as the retard that we all think him to be?</br>  <br> go check it <br> it's there for real <br><br>Holy shit guys, it's confirmed, go all check through the archives, it's true and already leaked. He even predicted a bunch more of stuff on those leaks!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, that's just more reason for them living till the end.</br>  I'm gone for two days and look what happened<br> confirmedfag rampaging <br> release day cancer eats up everything <br> discussions about fake confirmed facts <br>I miss the gay shitposting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah I agree with dude. He is just reckless</br>  <br>When he visited the Salinedine City.</br>  <br> implying <br><br>If you actually get triggered by obvious fakes and wants fujospam, then you are the cancer here. The thread is weirdly healthier than usual actually, I think the shitposter faggot got banned.</br></br></br>   2 futatsu, fu, futa, ha  <br>  ni, ji, aru t <br>  su, tsū, tū <br><br> 9 kokonotsu, ko  <br>  kyu, ku nain <br><br>Can anyone make a japanese word out of these that isn't 'nikyu' or 'fuku' because the SH crew devil fruit numbers theory is all but confirmed and points to a nakama somehow having the nikyu nikyu fruit (Kuma's fruit) or fuku fuku (Possibly Kinemon's fruit)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> enjoy your backgrounds while you can <br>why, they're not going anywhere  like the manga </br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> People legitimately questioning whether or not Luffy is a dumbass </br></br>  How come we don't have any women admirals? Fishman island was all about diversity and equality and luffy likes diversity in his crews and enemies so why no women admiral. After the dressrosa arc with rebecca and oda saying mom is the opposite of adventure I'm starting to believe he's a misogynist. Just like kishimoto  <br>I think it could imply Bonney but I forgot how.</br>  <br>one of the funniest moments in one piece<br><br>but way after the introduction of  Crocus </br></br></br>  <br>You're the one getting triggered by my post. I only stated my feelings on the whole affair.<br>Have a gay something. Get triggered.</br></br>  PLEASE DON'T RESPOND! PLEASE!  <br>Please post more gays. My collection needs some.</br>  <br>At least hide a bit when roleplaying alone.</br>  <br>Okay. Want something in particular ?</br>  <br>I hope ryokyugu is a female because I'm tired of Odas shit</br>  <br><br>That's what I mean that is not being dumb that is literally just half paying attention to something you don't care about. like back when your grandparents would talk about how supermarkets back in the day.</br></br>  <br>Not really. The more the better.</br>  <br> th- th- th- there can't possibly be more than one fujo in this thread ! </br>  <br>This and reporting are the sure ways to dealing with samefags who just need attention. Even by shitposter standarts they are the lowest you can go.</br>  <br>This is a story for 12 year old boys. Who cares about diversity?</br>  <br>Okay.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br><br><br>WHY? What was the need to respond to a known shitposter?</br></br></br>  <br> new ip <br> samefag </br></br>  <br> implying a woman can handle admiral position </br>  <br> asks what Nami's on about <br> hear what Nami's on about <br> has no idea what Nami's on about <br>No, it's like my bloody grandparents at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You used my tip from another day, good to know, it's fucking easy to bypass the poster count and you should knew it before starting.</br>  <br>Still I wish we got a female admiral. That admiral bunnysomething was a cute. Too bad she's not canon.</br>  <br>I'm actually trying to start a discussion</br>  STOP FUCKING RESPONDING YOU GODDAMN CHILDREN. JUST STOP FUCKING REPLYING.  Back when the anime was good.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=koh<wbr>raW3rj3M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>this niggas been killing me since yesterday</br>  <br>I think hina would be able to be an admiral</br>  <br>Not him, I appreciate that, but posting cosplay pictures is looked down upon here. Moreover it'll probably get you banned in a few minutes, just saying.</br>  <br>Nigga what.<br>I haven't read One Piece since they entered the new world. I just saw a gay picture and asked for more. You guys are ridiculous.</br></br>    <br>this desillusion<br>but to be fair I'm really scared of seeing Smoker becoming  White Snake  admiral</br></br>  <br>IRC fags want an excuse to ban OP threads so they shit it up when they can. THey couldn't even get rid of nurutu of all things but they think they have a shot with OP.</br>  <br> I haven't read One Piece since they entered the new world <br>Then you need some introduction about new best pairs</br></br>  <br>You have never heard about something that might be interesting,asked a question about it ,and lost interest instantly? I get that it is played for laughs. But it doesn't really make him dumb. Like I'm specifically talking about intelligence not lack of attention span.</br>  <br>Responding to who?</br>  <br> only reddit likes Sabo <br><br>the fuck outta here</br></br></br>    <br> asking for /y/ spamming <br><br>This is already ban worthy if you weren't pretending.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo is actually a decent character who can link to the revos, through your fanart is all shit.</br>  <br><br>Both, both are good. <br>Hopefully One Piece's epilogue will deliver.</br></br></br>  <br>I will concede to this one . that is actually fucking retarded. Forget about the little interactions like this one</br>  <br> and then a quick escape back to Fishman Island <br>Picturing all the fleets gathering in FI waiting to launch the attack is great, shame we'll never see it</br></br>  <br>No, because I would know whether or not I'd be interested in knowing about something. If I didn't want to know, I'd just go about my business.</br>  <br> /y/ <br><br>clearly you dont know what /y/ is<br><br><br>how about this one then?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's be realistic in the epilogue either tashigi or hina will be an admiral</br>  <br>Oh look it's that guy who convinced himself gay posters got banned for posting their shit.</br>  <br><br>but every admiral we've seen had OP DF<br>and Smoker is far overpowered by almost everyone in the NW<br>I don't see him ever catching back</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apart from being tumblr shit it's not as bad for not making anyone looks like a teenager girl for the sake of projecting into a character who has nothing to do with you. When you feel the need to fag aroung through, you still should try other boards who won't get you banned.</br>  <br>Is Franky flying?<br><br>how the fuck id moving that fast?</br></br></br>  <br>Smoker will be Fleet Admiral, Fuji would be Kong 2.0.</br>  <br>Could be Smoke, Coby and Helmeppo. Or maybe Fujitora stays for being a good goy.</br>  <br>There's a theory that women can't use any types of haki. We've never seen a female show case haki so that's probably why</br>    <br> the entirety of AMAZON FUCKING LILY <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>"Hey man tell me about this anime"<br>"Well its about an average teenaged boy who meets a gir-"<br><br>Happens to me all the time in defence of that retard you are replying to</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody actually misses a roleplayer here, but good job pretending to find an excuse to shitpost yourself later on IRC-kun.</br>  <br> There's a theory about how I forgot about literally every human being in Amazon Lily </br>  <br>isn't there an other example of Luffy being explained something and he's sweating cause he doesn't understand shit and says something like "I see..."<br><br>pretty vague but maybe someone knows what I'm talking about<br><br><br>lrn2rd<br>amazon lily and tashigi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i want for usopp an realy epic battle, where he fights brave as fuck and after a long and very hard and strategic fight he wins, maybee against kuma or so</br>  <br> There's a theory that women can't use any types of haki. <br>nope there isn't<br><br> We've never seen a female show case haki so that's probably why <br>Mach 20 reader pls go and stay go</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it ever shown they can use haki in the anime?</br>  <br>All admiral are logias, Smoker is a logia. <br>It's not farfetched by any means. Heck it might be planned since the beginning of One Piece. <br>Anyone can get stronger if Oda wills it so. Heck even Garp wasn't strong since day one. Smoker'd probably be nicknamed jobber admiral in the thread should that ever happen, but still.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. I don't watch the anime.</br>  <br>It was never shown in the anime though</br>  Post more stupid luffy  <br>yes, the sisters used CoO. And the women chasing Luffy used CoA on their arrows.</br>  Would Capone be a good minor arc boss since he's after Caesar? I feel he's not there to be a long-running rival like the bigger supernovas.  <br>No, but that's different though. You lost interest because you don't like that kinda anime. Not because you had no idea what the shit your friend was saying. Luffy didn't go "Never mind, not interested". He heard Nami and just made up something in his brain.</br>  Kuro &gt; Illya &gt; Myu  <br>why is illya wearing a diaper</br>  Preview images for episode 1 are up: <br>http://anime.prisma-illya.jp/story/<wbr><br><br>Things are looking pretty INTENSE.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Holy shit that's what I thought.<br><br>The yellow tint doesn't help either.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks pretty mediocre to bad for me.<br>I hope they will actually manage to draw them this time, and won't be like Zwei all over again.</br></br>  <br>Why are you not using capitalization and punctuation?<br>The answers are surprisingly similar.</br></br>  I wonder what illya and kuro's buttholes smell and taste like.  <br>Prepare your tongue Illya.</br>  <br><br>I swear to god if they blow the fanservice budget on the kissing again, I'm gonna burn someone.</br></br>  <br>someone edit illyas diaper to be wet please. thanks</br>   trying on someone else's lingerie/underwear <br><br>Do girls actually do this?</br></br>  <br>All you pedos need to chemically castrate yourselves.

The plot hasn't really gone anywhere, with Miyu being a side character in S2 after having S1 being about their friendship.

We’ll be picking up Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai as well as Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya 2wei Herz! in UTW’s place. <br>Fuck yes, it's true. But they're going to take forever aren't they? They're even late on Shimoneta today.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I can't even register bath scenes as fanservice, and they are rarely such.

Is this shit worth reading if I only care about  EMIYA ?  <br>there are some funny scenes with shirou<br><br>if you have good taste and lik best girl illya it should tide you over until tsukihime remake comes out</br></br></br>  <br>The full version of this will end up being spammed all over the other boards, just like the Kuro x Miyu one.</br>  <br> end up being spammed all the other boards <br>Wait. Really?</br></br>  <br>Dude, the Miyu kiss was posted literally everywhere.</br>  <br>Yeah, I can attest to that. It was spammed a lot.</br>  <br> but not as much as there is in tsukihime <br>You're delusional.<br><br>I hope they will cut this shit short.<br>Last season blew all fanservice money on that, and we got things like diaper bloomers instead of the heaven that was the manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/boards<wbr>/int.jp.mlp.tg.v.vg.vp/image/LbYA66<wbr>Nsi9E4OqZ71xaOmg/<br><br>I even saw it used on /g/ as an OP a few days ago.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Oh fuck man.

I heard over the next 3 days theres supossed to be<br> New manga chapter <br> New OVA <br> New season <br><br><br>Also, i think the first two episodes will be shopping + Beach</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the OVA is on the 24th as well. So maybe a few days after that?<br>Probably Herz &gt; OVA &gt; who the fuck knows with Paitouch.</br></br>  So how i think the episodes will be<br><br>EP1<br> Shopping + beach, ending with the presents scene <br>EP2<br> Beach, the serum, the clash of the characters, ending with "Where did all the time go" <br>EP3<br> Review. Team meeting, attack, ending with "A cave filled with malice" <br>EP4<br> Fight against MudGil, ending with how he breaks free from the mirror world <br>EP5<br> Gil escaps, karin shows up, end with mudgil exposing the great cavern and the grail seal <br>EP 6 + 7<br> Fighting the Gil <br>EP 8<br> Illya zweiform, rescue of Miyu <br>EP 9<br> Angelica and the little bitch arrive, taking miyu with them <br>EP 10<br> Awake in the parralell world <br><br><br>What are they going to do?

I wouldn't even be surprised if it were 4 episodes considering last season's pacing.</br>  Some early spoilers for chapter 31 of 3rei.    <br>baby miyu.....MUH DICK<br>so thats kiritsugu? or kotomine or ainsworth-nigga</br></br>    <br>They really do need some help in animating the pantsu department.
