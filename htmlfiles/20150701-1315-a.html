I fucking loved it. Some of it was really good, some of it was pretty rough, but the whole thing was fun. The fact you shoved various instruments to take the place of vocals was pretty fucking funny (and even worked occasionally). A+, keep it coming guys,  <br>Well they're gay for using secure tripcodes anyway.</br>  <br><br>Guilty as charged, but I've seen people try to impersonate each other on these kinds of threads before, which is a pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>Only Clarinet uses a secure one though.</br>  <br> list <br>Why would you keep a list of trips?</br></br>  This shit is worse than /jp/'s compilation album  <br>Classic Guitar and Sax also use trips.<br><br><br> Not keeping track of wannabe e-celebs </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to my filter list</br>  Dat fucking Renai.  <br> worse <br>Worse is better with these tracks.</br></br>  <br> comparing an album of rerecordings to a mixtape <br>Well, I guess that's fair.</br></br>  <br>I know I do.</br>  <br>Sounds like an overreaction, but sure, whatever.</br>  <br> /jp/ album <br>I actually want to hear this, link?</br></br>  <br> not immediately filtering all trips who have no reason to be using a trip <br>It's made my life on 4chan a lot more enjoyable, that's for sure</br></br>  <br>Filters are for the weak.</br>  <br>moot was right, /a/ is indeed best girl!</br>  Imitation is really good, it sounds like the real thing except at a lower bit rate.  <br>moot?</br>  <br>There's an option to make everyone appear anonymous. Even then all the trips in this thread are harmless.</br>  <br> native anonymize filter <br> trips are actually useful (at least not harmful) for this thread </br></br>  <br>too soon</br>  <br>This is fucking beatiful</br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/c<wbr>az9uuvan03c5z1/%EF%BC%8Fjp%EF%BC%8F<wbr>+Music+Compilation+One.7z</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>But I actively want to ignore tripfags, not just make everyone anonymous. Although it's true that I come from  /sp/  where trips are generally a lot worse. Still no real reason to use one here.</br>  <br>Trips have a way of talking that is very unlike other anonymous posters, they play it safe because they feel they might harm their internet rep and make internet personalities. Not to mention interactions between two tripfags.</br>  <br>I don't know why the link came out like that<br>http://www.mediafire.com/?caz9uuvan<wbr>03c5z1</wbr></br></br>  <br>It works either way, Anon.</br>  <br>I don't even use a trip outside of this thread when I normally post, how the fuck do I even have internet rep.</br>  There's an orchestr/a/!? How do I get in on this!?  <br>Sounds like you have personal experience with tripfagging.</br>  <br/>  <br>Please stop being a namefag and read the thread for your answer.</br>  <br> 222 <br>Nice trips brah</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's called spending any amount of time on any board of 4chan.</br>  <br>Uhm,<br>titanpad com/orchestra<br>when it's not down.</br></br></br>  Probably going to be redundant but it still lacks power from lacking musicians. <br><br>On the other hand it's pretty good, nisemono is perfect.<br><br>Still no pianist though?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A guitar has strings, r-right?</br>  <br>That sounds nothing like the trips on /a/.

Even if he wasn't dense enough to consider it, he's eventually planning on leaving Rin behind to wander the world as a seigi no mikata. They're enjoying their happiness in the short-term while it lasts, but eventually Rin will settle down as a clocktower mage and Shirou will go off to chase his ideal. There's no real future for them, outside of a few meetings here or there.<br><br>This is remedied somewhat in Fate/Extra where it's implied Rin traveled with him, but the UBW epilogue seems to imply otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean you clearly didn't watch the episode<br>Or are you doubting the Word of Rin ?</br></br>  <br>Jesus censor that shit.</br>    <br>Stay mad wormfag.</br>  <br>It's this guy again.</br>  <br>but who is the blue man?</br>  <br>She touched her hand.<br>Hatesex confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Shirou wears a cardigan.<br>Rin wears a polo.<br><br>When did everything change?</br></br></br></br>    <br> UBW Shirou was Archer all along <br>That Shyamalan twist.</br></br>    <br><br><br>easiest bait ever</br></br></br>  <br>After Rin started buying him clothes.</br>  <br>he's finally making the right choices for once</br>  <br>This new bait pics are already becoming useful.</br>  <br>I think it's Shinji<br>don't know why he's there</br></br>  <br>I want to see Rin an Luvia having ravenous hatesex as they furiously scissor one another.</br>  <br>That Nasu was actually self inserting into Tohsaka's anus?</br>  <br> mfw bait </br>  <br>I don't buy that, though. While Rin may be able to make Shirou take value in his own happiness, he's still ultimately going to pursue his ideal. Since it doesn't seem like Rin goes with Shirou to fight ISIS, and he doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of guy who'd take a break from his ideal to visit his waifu, I just don't see it ultimately lasting.<br><br><br>It's never stated, in F/E Archer just says that he was accompanied by a stalwart friend and an understanding lover. Most people think it's either Issei or Shinji.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being in another man's girlfriend's cell phone's contact list </br>  <br> I don't buy that, though. <br>Well that's your bad because this was as close to an author statement as you possibly get without a omniscient narrator<br><br>But it's always nice to see headcanon get crushed by Nasu</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of get where your getting at, but like I feel as though that they both love each other dearly and Rin isn't the type to let go of him</br>  <br>But where is Saber going to get her magic semen?</br>  <br>Is it possible that in addition to having the Mystic Eyes of Petrification, Rider also has the Mystic Anus of Overwhelming Lewdness, which has the power to give anyone who views it lewd nightmares about her?</br>    <br>I feel like they would fight to see who makes the other cum more times, and reinforce their ladyparts to last longer.</br>  <br> 3DPD </br>  <br> secondaries </br>  she is angry because people think she won't stay with Shirou forver  <br>Is green his color?</br>  <br>I like how you left out the part where Rin and Shirou both agree he'll likely have the same outcome as Archer, and then Rin explains that she plans to settle down at Clock Tower but will travel with Shirou temporarily just to "get stuff out of her system." <br><br>Rin wants them both to have their happy endings, but their paths are different. The entire episode was about Shirou wrestling between settling down at Clock Tower (choosing a path alongside Rin) or becomine a seigi no mikata, the same path as Archer. He chose seigi no mikata.<br><br>There's a reason their agreement ends on a handshake and not on a hug or a kiss and Shirou is depicted as alone in the symbolic ending. He made his choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of guy who'd take a break from his ideal to visit his waifu <br>Are you saying he will go back on what he just agreed on, because that's your head canon?<br> I don't buy that, though. <br>Sure ignore what they both agreed on.<br> Since it doesn't seem like Rin goes with Shirou to fight ISIS <br>And she stated she was going to go with him, not seeing her in a symbolic scene makes no difference.<br><br>You really need to stretch it to keep your headcanon going, but that's fine because it shows how concrete the ending was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I like how you left out the part where Rin and Shirou both agree he'll likely have the same outcome as Archer <br>I like how you are leaving out that she says that he will surpass Archer, and the symbolic ending shows that. I also love how desperate you are, bending the whole context to fit your head canon.<br><br> There's a reason their agreement ends on a handshake and not on a hug or a kiss and Shirou <br>Because it's a serious conversation about their future. That agreement is as clear as day, he will pursue his ideal but at the end settle down for their happy ending.<br><br>I am giggling if you aren't baiting, this is a whole new level of sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Most people think it's either Issei or Shinji <br>I don't really know what to believe though, I mean "a stalwart friend" makes a lot of sense because of Issei's personality, but I can't really see Shirou telling him the truth about mages and shit out of fear of getting his friend killed one day<br>Shinji would make a bit more sense but "stalwart" isn't really something I would see him as, unless he changes as he grows up and stops being an egotistical and vain douche</br></br></br>  <br>It's implied that he will grow in HA.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>kill yourself</br></br>    <br><br>I think Clock Tower Shirou is even more swole than Dadruto.</br></br>  <br>Important to know that the japanese text directly implies a "male friend"<br><br><br> hug/kiss <br>Because they are japanese in a japanese show made for japanese people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh. that's actually kind of interesting considering his character personality. Also because he's a douchebag. and a piece of shit.</br>    <br>The thumbnail mad me think it was Eren Jaeger before expanding it.</br>  <br>Renaming your shit doesn't mean no one will notice.</br>  <br>In HA he wants to leave his house because he knows it's full of shit. Shirou agrees because he knows Shinji will manage as long as he puts his head on it.</br>  <br>get out of here Saber no one likes you</br>  <br>Go back to sleep, Arturia</br>  <br> Shirou cums inside Rin <br> Saber sucks it out of Rin's Vagoo. </br></br>  <br><br> What is Avalon </br></br>  <br><br>Nice.</br></br>  <br> Ciel <br>Didn't see that one coming<br> CCC is canon? <br><br>Also, reminded me of this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Saber sucks it out of Rin's Vagoo. <br>By scissoring</br></br>  <br>Certainly not a place that you can travel to from London by bendy bus.</br>  <br>Most boring place on earth.

Prisma is canon.</br>  <br>Takeuchi, I think or someone from UFO.</br>  <br>Why does Taiga look the most uncomfortable out of all them?</br>  <br> Why does Taiga look the most uncomfortable out of all them? <br> Virgin </br></br>  <br>Wakame</br>  <br>What a sad and lonely creature.<br> Taiga a best. </br></br>  <br>Doesn't that just mean seaweed?</br>  <br> Mah brother </br>  I like her character design and I like the personality she has in SOME portrayals, but in her interaction with Shirou she seems absolutely obnoxious and annoying and that far outweighs everything else for me.  <br>I would like to kiss taiga and see wats happen and how she react.<br><br>Illl probably get beat.</br></br></br>  <br>The yakuza would probably throw you into the ocean.</br>  <br>I dont know why people call her a tsundere. She acted very mellow and very direct in showing her interest in the MCs dick in this UBW thing.</br>  <br>I hope you are a descendant from a major Japanese Yakuza family or you are toast.</br>  <br><br>Not only do they end up together, the bone of Shirou's sword ends up turning Rin full dere.</br></br>  <br>I like to swin<br>Ill swin with taiga,</br></br>  I would fight off a whole yakuza army to be Taiga's man.   everytime I lose an argument online.   <br> her interaction with Shirou she seems absolutely obnoxious and annoying <br>Dude what?</br></br>  <br>She is a shy tsundere.</br>  <br>Surpassing Archer means accomplishing more as a seigi no mikata, not abandoning the path and treating it as a vacation. Rin and Shirou both say flat out that Shirou's result will be the same. Shirou says he can't change his ways. No where does that agreement imply anything like you are saying, it's just Rin's wish for them both to find happiness. <br><br>Stop missing the point of UBW and its theme because of shipfaggotry.</br></br></br>  <br> My headcanon will prevail </br>  <br>Except Shirou saw what would happen and he even admitted it was hell.<br>He will enter the hell, but atleast he will enter hell with his waifu.</br></br>  <br>how romantic</br>  why can't they just cancel fate and do more KnK.  <br>Doesn't print as much money.</br>  <br>waaaaah...???</br>  <br>Doesn't this heavily imply that he will indeed find his answer eventually?<br>Or am I missing something?</br></br>  <br>Nah he fucked all that was said there was wishful thinking.</br>  <br>Even then the episode ended on a very positive note with them both agreeing on a happy end, even Rin who was so opposed to the idea was sure Shirou wouldn't end up as bad.<br><br>Just a few episodes earlier she was screaming in anger at EMIYAs way of life, I find it very unlikely she would let Shirou end up the same way, especially after the promise with archer.</br></br></br>  <br>horribly underrated post</br>  <br>You are talking to that one Sakurafag who absolutly hates UBW and Rin</br>  <br>Why would he just pretend to argue like that, what a meanie.</br>    <br>I take you weren't hear 2 or 3 weeks ago?<br>Before EP 24 he was arguing that Rin only loved Archer than Ep 24 and 25 destroyed that argument so he switched to this</br></br>  <br> Escort explaining mana transfer technique to elementary school girls </br>  <br>I just got around to watching the last episodes now, I was a little disappointed by the first episodes of season 2 which is why I took a little break. <br><br>Now that I'm finished though, I'm pretty satisfied with the adaption, the filler parts were really bad, but the final battles made up for it.<br>The Hogwarts part was pretty damn good too.</br></br></br></br>  holy fuck you autistic shits go outside this board is actually cancer  <br> this triggers people here  <br><br>Typemoonfags are pathetic.</br></br></br>   there will be no more Rin till the HF adaption <br> she will never be as good as L O N D O N waifu Rin <br>Literally no reason to live whatsoever.</br></br>  <br> F/Z <br>Bad start, good middle, bad ending.<br><br> UBW <br>Good start, bad middle, good ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'll get to see the strongest Rin in action, and she gets a lot of development in HF.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>HF Rin literaly doesn't make sense with how Ufotable adapted Rin's adventure in Zero.</br>  <br>What? why?</br>  <br><br>Fate/Zero had a great start. Ur dumb.</br></br>    <br>In the LN Rin completly fails and it traumatizes her so that she decides to not try impossible things anymore.<br> That part actualy neatly set up Rin's mindset for F/SN </br></br>  <br>Watch they will make Rin completely tame compared to the VN.</br>  <br> F/Z <br> Good start, good middle, decent ending. <br><br> UBW <br> Good start, bad middle, great ending. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be one 90 minute RN movie anyway.</br>  <br>Saving Sakura is not only impossible, it brings danger to everyone.</br>  <br><br> good start <br>Maybe if you're a secondary that doesn't know shit about how the HGW works. <br>If you read the VN or LN the first episodes feel incredibly slow and redundant. It'sundeniable that Zero suffered from pacing issues, especially when it was airing. <br>Having to watch five episodes until the series starts to pick up is not a good start.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 90 minutes <br>Any source on this?<br>I'm a huge UBWfag, but even I will be disappointed if it's only 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>That's my point, it's hard to develop character with that. Parts will be cut and I am sure her going against Shirou at the start will be cut.</br>  <br>My ass<br><br>But as you see in F/SN before HF and in Ufotable's F/Z Rin has a disposition to try to do the impossible which in the LN was dampened by her failure to save anyone</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love if the movies made the characters harder to relate to, really pulling out all the dark shit they hide. <br>They are magi after all, they live surrounded by death and have to constantly shoulder the burden of really tough life choices, tey should really be as mentally fucked up as the Zero HGW participants.</br></br>  <br> there will be no more Rin till the HF adaption <br>You retard we have Fate Illya Prisma season 3 this summer season!</br></br>  <br>It's a movie the highest it might go is 120 minutes.</br>  <br> prism <br>I'd rather read Fate route 3 times in a row.</br></br>  <br>Remember how Rin's traits are optimism (F/Z) and perfection? <br>There's a reason why optimism was only present in Zero, her parents death showed her how cruel is the world of magi and that she would get herself killed if she continued to be that innocent.</br></br>  <br>Yes that was added by the Butcher later. It's perfectly fine not to have it and I guess UFO didn't deem it that necessary.</br>  <br>I thought they'd do multiple movies like with KnK</br>  <br>That's not confirmed and it's pure speculation.</br>  <br>Prisma RIn doesn't do justice to her VN/Ufo counterpart.<br>I'll only watch Prisma for the occasional good battle and to see who wins the Shiroub owl.</br></br>  <br>It's going to be hard to keep that with a movie especially when the viewers are coming from F/Z and UBW.</br>  <br>Rin's past was pretty much a blank.<br>Completly inverting what she "learns" from that part of F/Z was stupid.<br>I mean it works somewhat with UBW and Fate but not with HF.</br></br></br>  <br>Her actions are justifiable without that. You are right that they should have kept it as it helps.</br>  <br>Prisma Rin has some pretty okay moments in 3rei.</br>  <br>Shit, we might get this side story this season. Maybe.</br>  <br>There's something incredibly cute about dense Shota Shirou and Foolhardy Loli Rin.</br>  i never see these posted in rin threads and i have no idea why  <br>I think her command seals are on the wrong hand.</br>  <br>Because her command spells go in the left hand.

Almost everything could use more Jazz, but I did enjoy high school band setting. I haven't enjoyed watching a Kyoani show this much since Hyouka.</br>  <br>better to be a hetfag instead of a yurifag</br>   Euphonium in the title <br> herpderp this is going to be jazz! </br>  There will be a second season right?  <br>very unlikely</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>relax anon, the very title of the series says , why wait all series for jazz if it was obvious it was a school band?<br><br>this should make you happy, anon</br></br></br>  <br>Thx for these gif. Made me laugh so much.</br>  <br>I hope, we need an episode in a pool or on the beach, I need natsuki in swimsuit</br>  <br>not a lot of material left, author ended the series at like 5 books I think?</br>  <br>But this season didn't cover the entire source material right?</br>  Now that it's all over can we all agree Hibike Euphonium was AOTS? DanMachi was runner up.  <br>No, this season only covered Volume 1, there's still plenty of material left. I don't think there's going to be a second season because the final episode gave no indication of it being a possibility and the sales haven't exactly been stellar.</br>  <br>  Natsuki in swimsuit </br>  <br>No, that would be sidonia S2.</br>  She looks lovely.  <br> the trailer was saying that everywhere <br><br>Sounds like you're just a retard that cant tell the difference between a Jazz band and an Orchestra. It's your own fault for being such an ignorant piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Saturday Night Live <br>worst meme of this show tbh</br></br>  <br>Actually, I love you.</br>  The part at 18:30 was a little bit too off-key, and Reina still kept playing like a god. Due to her god-like performance the other instruments were only shadows.<br><br>She won the competition.</br></br>  <br>I don't even understand it. Why do you make these images? Are they supposed to be funny?</br>  <br>imagine all the hibike girls in swimsuit</br>  <br>Of course there will. This episode made it very clear. Anyone who thinks there isn't is literally retarded.</br>  WHERE'S SHUIICHI  <br>W-wrong picture</br>  <br> group picture <br> owari <br> no previews or anything <br> oboe-chan didn't even get any lines <br>I'm not sure anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>idiot</br>  <br><br>Bottom left</br></br>  <br> imagine all the hibike girls in swimsuit </br>  Novel anon, didn't lie. Kumiko was expecting him.  <br>Oboe and Fagot girls get a certificate for being the best girls.<br><br>We did it /a/, we did it.</br></br></br>  I think Natsuki and Reina grew on me, with Natsuki not caring for, and Reina me disliking her.<br>Ironically, I loved Asuka, but I ended up not liking her as much due to her bs. Not hate her or anything, just not like her as much as I did before.<br><br>How has your opinions changed of characters throughout the series, /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's Knuckle, he don't chuckle</br>  Voice says "Fagotto"<br>Sub says "Bassoons"<br>Why is this allowed   for a good taste  ?</br></br>  Knuckles and entourage anime when?  <br> Hibike EUPHONIUM <br> expecting Jazz </br></br>  <br><br> Eupho is not a jazz instrument <br> herpderp I'm retarded <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PDM<wbr>R9IhAecI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Between Sensei and mini-sensei.</br>  <br>In order for it to be any more confirmed they would have had to have given Natsuki some line like "Btw guys S2 next year keep it up"<br><br>It's as good as set in stone, it was obvious.</br></br></br>  In the end, did all the yuribaiting make the show better or worse?  <br> Implying it's standard <br> Implying you couldn't do 2 seconds in google to see what kind of music it's originally about </br></br>  <br>That's strange, why does he look so happy.</br>  <br>It made the threads focus on something almost completely irrelevant to the show</br>  <br>Obviously worse. Landed a few more sheckels in KyoAni's pockets though, so there's that.</br>   Stop talking about my husbando, please. ;_;   What was the last anime you marathoned in one sitting? <br><br>Mine was pic related.</br></br>  Samurai Flamenco <br>It was glorious</br>  Tenchi Muyou <br><br>It was nice and nostalgic.</br></br>  Gunbuster, it was overrated  Persona 4 The animation. Thought it was gonna be a shit adaption but shit was surprisingly good and a lot more funny compared to the game.  owari no seraph<br>wanted to check out another anime of the season, thought it was average and i guess it did get me interested in the second season</br>  <br>this one</br>  Madoka. <br><br>No regrets either, it was fucking great. I wasn't really expecting anything out of it, and started watching it just because someone on /a/ said there would be yuri. Holy fuck what a ride.</br></br>  Sabagebu and Jinsei, both yesterday.<br><br>Both were pretty good.</br></br>  This was a pleasant surprise to watch.  Noragami.  <br> marathoned in one sitting <br>Wow, Anon, did you get up at 7am in the morning to watch it on your LCD display TV?</br></br>  <br>Kyoto crows was awful except the 1st op and kon and hanakana</br>  Outlaw Star. Had a shit day yesterday, and wanted something reliably entertaining.  <br>White Album 2<br><br>I should not have done it. I feel horrible now. <br><br><br>My nigga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  punchline the day it ended  <br>Was pretty good, although I think if I'd have not marathoned it I'd have been able to pay more attention.</br>  <br>I want to, but I am afraid the sudden turns will give me whiplash.</br>  <br> having an LCD Tv display  <br><br>Plasma is where its at faggot.</br></br></br>  Motherfucking Gankutsuou  <br>What anime is this?</br>  Evangelion + EoE. No regrets, although I felt like I was mind-raped by the end.  <br>Tokyo Ravens</br>  Mondachi. Based MC.  Shirobako. This anime about anime was too fun plus the girls were cute too.  Texhnolyze and it was fucking worth it.  <br> 7am in the morning <br>As opposed to 7am in the evening?</br></br>  snk  dubbed <br><br>I had it "backlogged" for the longest time, but was bedridden for a weekend due to some kind of serious cold last winter and watched one season each day while semi tripping off the cold medicine, so the main thing I remeber about it was that the op songs were fucking cool, but otherwise the whole plot aspect is blurry. I remeber the general gist; theres the main guy who can transform, his sister who wants the d, some guy named levi who is basically roy mustang, and some chick who turned out to be a secret giant all along. And mc guy and biribiri join the scouts and they ride around outside to fight bug dudes outside for a bit before fighting them inside again.<br><br>Might rewatch it someday in a more coherent state.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I chuckled.</br>    Amagi Brilliant Park. <br><br>I'm glad I marathoned it. I dont' think I would of been able to sit and watch this weekly consistently.</br></br>  Black Rock Shooter<br><br>I really enjoyed it.</br></br>  had a poster made of this image as well  Sakamichi no Apollon<br><br>It was okay, 10/10.</br></br>  <br>Is it as fujo as you can get?</br>  <br>It wasn't really fujo at all, I thought it would be at the start because there was one part where they accidentally hold hands. But girl problems are a large focus in the show.</br>  <br>Teekyuu and Inferno Cop <br>It was really fun</br></br>  <br>Shiki. Doctor was so based.</br>  Dude!  <br>what is this? i don't recognise it <br><br>same. i thought it was pretty good.</br></br></br>  This.  <br>Yuru Yuri season 2. I just couldn't stop, it was too comfy.</br>  Post-FinalBoss Yuusha story where the original yuusha is a mentor for a group of adventurers, and generally jolly adventuring around the wilderness.  <br>Wrong thread.</br>  Detective Conan  Oregaiu S1. <br>  On a LAN when everybody else was already asleep.  </br>  still best OP ever  <br>It says "White Album 2" at the end. Is that it? I honestly don't know.</br>    Inferno Cop.<br>This scene made me sad.</br>  So who is best Loli?    So who is best Loli? <br>Those are words for war anon, but i'll say Hinami of Barakamon</br>    <br>Your mother lmao.</br>    <br>Yasuna's a high school girl, dingus.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to him, anon. He's simply channeling Yasuna's spirit of bakaness.</br>  cunny    Miracle of the universe.  <br>Very proportionally tiny, flat high school students.<br><br>But to answer OP's question,  Kohina. </br></br></br>  Dubs for Mooki.  <br>What a cutie puppie!</br>  <br>If only, if oh so only.<br><br><br>Stop trying to make a fight. All lolis are best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That may be but that doesn't make them loli's.</br>  <br>Didn't say there were, Sonya and Yasuna are just somewhat proportionally similar. Somewhat.<br><br>Agiri has small, somewhat noticeable boobs though. Sometimes. In some scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Aikawa count?</br>  <br><br>That's debatable in KMB's case, since the artstyle is ambiguous. However, old girls can definitely be lolis.</br></br>  why is loli being bullied?  <br>Looking like a loli doesn't make you one (you can joke about it though).<br><br> old girls can definitely be lolis. <br><br>That doesn't make sense. Aren't you supposed to be a child to be considered a loli?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aren't you supposed to be a child to be considered a loli? <br><br>Loli is body type, mate. Not age.<br>As long as you look like a normal little girl aged 14 below you qualify, even though your age is 65.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, loli is a body type. We've long since been over this. Consider immortal vampire lolis, they're old as fuck, but yet inarguably loli.</br></br>   There are literally <br> right now <br> metaphorically <br> geographically <br> at this very moment <br> people who don't think and accept witches <br><br>Being smart feels so good. You can observe the common rabble from your ivory tower and laugh at their delusions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant mostly in the question arcs, hence the "changed his mind" bit.
