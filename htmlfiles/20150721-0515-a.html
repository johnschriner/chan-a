I love the recent stuff, but I honestly dont know if berserk will ever reach that level of quality again.  <br> Implying <br><br>Were not even sure of his full intentions or why all the godhand are involved. Or why griffith fused the fantasy realm with the physical.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you're willing to brand this mark onto your flesh and be devoured body and soul by lovecraftian horrors, sure.</br>  <br> Getting a brand tattoo <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br> Shes literally one of the only things he has left <br> Yet she hates him in her retarded state </br></br>  <br> not wanting to be hunted by demons until your eventual demise <br>Fuck right off.  Tattoos are fucking gay though. </br></br>  <br> Rickert tells off griffith as an asshole he doesnt recognize anymore <br> Yet he still treasures the old griffith and the old band of the hawk <br><br>I love how true miura stays to the characters even though he started writing this shit almost 30 years ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can he even do an arc as good as conviction anymore?</br>  <br>The reveal of the god hand and guts' destiny might be cool. But I think berserk reached its highest point with the black swordsman arc, retribution, lost children and conviction. Who knows though, maybe miura can top them. The storys hardly done.</br>  WHY THERE IS NO ANIME OR FILM CONTINUATION?  <br>There should be a new anime that skips over the golden age with miuras art style. And for fucks sake, no cg unless its for demons.</br>  <br>I would pay top money for a Berserk adaptation by KyoAni where everyone is even more moe. The rage and shitstorm on /a/ alone would make it worth the price.<br><br>Isn't the story approaching its end though? I mean he can finish all the loose ends in 2-3 tanks right now and I imagine he has a plan about how to finish it.</br></br></br>  <br> Berserk <br> Moe <br><br>Even for shits and giggles, its not worth it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Supposely, they will release a fourth film covering the Black Swordsman Arc, maybe a trilogy covering the Conviction arc.<br><br>But there's been no talks this year, I hope they pick up the project (again) next year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, it's not me.<br><br>It makes me wonder how modern day weaponry would do against apostles.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's virtually impossible for him to finish all the characters arcs, especially Guts/Casca in 3 volumes bro.<br><br>It might end in like, 10.<br><br>I really hope Berserk will remain monthly for a long while.<br><br>New movie/PS4 game when?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> More movies <br><br>I hope they try to stick to the mangas artstyle more. And they seriously better not abridge it like they did with the golden age movies.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Theres still alot unanswered. Who the fuck are the godhand and the idea of evil? What about skull knight? Whats falconia really about? Shit would take like ten more volumes indeed. Although I feel like berserk shouldnt have an end. Maybe its because its felt endless for 30 years.</br>  <br> It makes me wonder how modern day weaponry would do against apostles <br>Pretty sure you would never lose with modern weaponry.</br></br>  <br>Will Casca kiss Guts when she's cured?</br>  <br>Military weapons would wreck them, but anything else would be useless. Except machetes.</br>  <br>ALERT!

Heavier artillery and bomb strikes maybe. But there are apostles that wouldnt be possible to kill, like the kushan emperor. <br><br>Anons also forget that apostles would just adapt and start using modern day weapons with their demonic powers.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasnt slan controlling those people?</br>  <br>  90% men 5% goat 5% whores  <br><br>Ok.</br></br></br>    <br>YOU SICK FUCK</br>  <br>What?

Still, nice to see references in Berserk.</br>  <br><br>Well on one hand real puck is shotabait, I mean i've seen pages where Miura draws him in deliberately femenine poses, he also works as his personal nurse and is shown as an overly sensitive person at times.<br><br>However as the series progressed he became more of a joke/4th wall breaking character, specially after loli witch kinda took his place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wyald gives so much pleasure to those who don't know pleasure.</br>    <br> not knowing Takarajima <br>Come the fuck on. Is this your first year watching anime?</br></br>  <br>No. Now answer like a normal person or fuck off.</br>  <br>It's like asking a dog to talk. You can try, but it's not happening.</br>  <br> I'm too lazy to google the answer spoonfed to me <br>I don't even know why I bother. It's a very famous and well known anime.</br></br>  <br><br>Everyone is expecting one or more of the human companions to die, because they're generally cunts. <br><br>What nobody expects is that Puck is going to be the one who dies.<br><br>If Caska died, Guts would fall into crippling depression. If anyone else died, Guts would be sad, but he could move on. But if Puck died? The guy who's been there all along, protecting Guts from the nightmares, acting as his conscience, the one bright spot in his time as the Black Swordsman seeking vengeance? The character who is practically the mascot of the series by now?<br><br>Guts will go absolutely batshit. Whoever does it - kills Puck, I mean - is going to die so hard it'll be downright frightening. It's going to be the single most emotionally intense scene of the entire story to this point, the culmination of everything up to that point. People complain that the story's gotten boring now that not everyone is dying instantly and Guts has a proper adventuring party going, but it's all to lure the audience into a false sense of security, or to convince them that it's going to be one of the other companions who dies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Puck is too important to die.<br>Plus he's literally the voice of wacky comedy Miura that losing that would be the equivalent of losing all sense of comedy in the story. If you kill Puck, you basically have gone past the point of no return concerning the mood of the story.</br></br>  <br>best fetish<br>best girl</br></br>  <br><br>I expect another hiatus.<br><br>In fact, I won't resume reading this until the guy literally announces the last chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure you wont</br>   they get off the ship at their destination <br> Gut says "We got here faster than expected" </br>  <br>Lost children Guts is downright scary</br>  <br> nameofseriesnumber <br>Autism</br></br>  <br>I havent read it in 5 years, and tired of serious getting in hiatus., HxH, Berserk, D-Gray Man.<br><br>Fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br>I always pictured Schierke with auburn hair.

I can no longer get hard with pump. Why did I ever leave my 2D</br>  <br>Ishido is going to become important later on, so I don't see it happening.</br>  <br> letting a fat girl mount you <br><br>Meant to be the other way around, you kind of had it coming.</br></br></br>  why even care<br>the fucker is going to die before he finish the story anyway<br>fuck everything</br></br>  <br>he doesnt have to balls to touch Rickert</br>  <br> Four days left, what do you expect to happen? <br>they postponed it to next month though<br>something about someone getting sick</br></br></br>  <br>Here's leaked plot from GRRM. He and Miura are best buds. <br><br> Guts dies fighting a never ending horde of monsters, the berserker armor leaving nothing but a skeleton. <br> His soul is taken to the Idea of Evil. <br> The swirling godlike entitity explains to him how he created Griffith, that he is the embodiment of fate, and humanity's saviour. <br> Because the universe must be in balance, the creation of Griffith also gave rise to Guts. <br> This has happened before, with the skeleton knight, and the brain god-hand. <br> The skeleton knight lost because he was still tied to fate, <br> Guts can only win if he is allowed to exist free of the fate that the Idea of Evil resides over. <br> Guts becomes the enbodiment of free will <br> He is returned to Earth, in full flesh, consuming the sacrifice mark in the process. <br> He is now the only living thing in the universe which is not governed by fate, and thus nothing is impossible to him. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>mite b cool</br>    <br>He might touch Rickert's balls tho</br>  <br>Neat</br>  Would black swordsman arc guts have taken Ganishka's offer of going against Griffith? I mean thats pretty much what guts spent 2 yrs looking for. A chance to kill griffith. Yet the only gets that chance when he stops giving a fuck.  <br>10/10 nice prediction</br>  <br>But why would the idea of evil grant Guts such power?</br>  <br>Black Swordsman arc Guts would be like "fuck no dumb monster" and would die in 0.5 seconds after leaping himself into Ganishka's avatar.</br>  <br>Well, three feasible scenarios come to mind.<br><br>  Guts simply takes it, because he is badass <br>  The Idea of Evil has no choice, by creating Griffith, Guts must be granted the power. <br>  Skeleton Knight pops in from a dimensional hole and does some crazy shit resulting in this. <br>  Either way, the grand theme is fate vs. free will. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because as it stands Guts will never be able to fight Griffith. He has a crystal dragon and 4 other landwhales to fight, and Zodd.<br><br>Another powerup is needed.</br></br></br>  <br>Then creating Griffith is meaningless. Granting Guts free will would be stupid because it'd go against the idea of evil's argument to create Griffith.</br>  <br> Another powerup is needed <br>No it isn't.<br><br>The Berserker armor needs to stay until the end. The sole reason so that Guts can progressively keep destroying himself as he keeps fighting and using the armor.<br>Having another powerup would lose that.<br><br>Guts, in my estimates, won't have to fight Zodd because  he will be fighting with him against Griffith. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What are Griffith's powers, anyways?  <br>Not replying to a pedophile, fuck off.<br><br><br>I think IOE can just fuck shit up if he wants to, and create something to counter Griffith. He clearly tried something like that before, with SK and Void, so who knows.<br><br><br>Spacetime shit, and godliness etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't meaningless. I won't argue that because the idea of evil is a god, he is impossible to understand, but consider this:<br>When Guts is granted free will, that only means he is not fated to lose. Yet, he is not fated to win either. It's like Guts now has the option to roll a natural 20 and win, it's highly unlikely, but somehow was the only way to make Griffith because reasons</br></br>  <br> implying epic capes can be too long </br>  <br> Then creating Griffith is meaningless <br>Not necessarily, Guts may fail despite not being tied to fate. Just because something isn't impossible doesn't mean it has a 100% chance of happening.</br></br>  <br>Well, that's much, much better and I actually dig it.</br>  <br>is he a confirmed pedo?</br>  <br> Not replying to a pedophile, fuck off. <br> discriminating for no reason <br>Kek, can't argue against someone with better opinions than you?<br><br> create something to counter Griffith <br>He already created something to counter Griffith, it's called Guts.<br><br><br>Guts has no free will. Don't assume that because Skull Knight said he does that he's correct or right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br><br>Let me rephrase that, Guts has free will, everyone has free will, but IoE manipulates people to the extent where they are guided to the point where it seems like everything is deterministic.</br></br>  <br>your welcome</br>  <br>essentially the same as only Guts having free will after powerup, i.e. free of the IOE's machinations</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128341473 <br> deleted <br>I'll remember you brrrrotha</br></br>  <br>wrong thread?</br>  <br>No one can or will ever be free from IoE's control.<br>The non-canon chapter says that IoE manipulates people's emotions on a subconscious level just enough for them to make decision guided towards what it wants.<br>No powerup can be free from the strongest force in the story.</br></br></br>  <br>stop breathing</br>  <br>I'd say Guts represents humanity's struggle to rid themselves of the fate, the rejection of pre-determined life of shit ruled by angry gods. It's my prediction that the story will develop to match this, but that's it.</br>  Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that this guy took the time during a chaotic operation with lives at stake to edit the Wikipedia article of K2 to maintain factual accuracy.  <br>What was his name again? I hope he survives until retirement.</br>  <br>Is that HS? I guess I'd rather keep watching memesubs.</br>  <br>As expected of a highly-trained operative of S.O.N.G.<br><br>That's not H&amp;D, nor is it Commeme. I don't know who it is.</br></br></br>  <br> second highest <br> factual </br></br>  <br>I meant third highest.</br>  <br><br>It's HS, yes.</br></br>  This shit feels like I am watching Nanoha befriending all the little misunderstood bitches all around while fate is always being jealous of them. Because they get Nanoha attention.  <br>Wait, shit, I thought nobody was simulcasting it. Where is he getting 1080p geahs?</br>  <br>Crunchyroll is simulcasting it starting friday, and the first two episodes are already out.</br>  So the SUBS WHEN craze is officially deprecated starting friday?<br>I feel like we're losing an important part of the Symphohype.</br>  <br><br>I think I like the commie line more. What did H and D translate it to?</br></br>  <br> The peak elevation of the mountain has dropped to the 3rd highest in the world! </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Commie translated it as "K2 is now the third highest mountain in the world".</br>  <br><br>If so, HS is better.</br></br>  <br>Crunchy might be more amusing but there's no way in hell it's more accurate.</br>  <br>Crunchy's subs are even worse than Commie at some points. Plus they only sub some songs.<br>They only have the best video rips and starting next week Commie and H&amp;D are going to use them too, so there's no reason to keep HS except for speed.</br></br>  Reminder that Carol is a legitimate threat and deserves to be feared. Fail to do so, and you'll find some Autoscorers sucking you dry.  <br> Getting sucked dry by an Autoscorer <br>Not a bad way to go</br></br>  Did Hibiki suffered enough to be able to deal with her insane personality? I feel all she needs is time, maybe some talk with enemies. I'd like to see her getting kidnapped, would be better than another "Miku is in danger so Hibiki finds temporary solution for her problems".  <br>Reminder that I masturbate daily to Carol's legs.</br>    <br> Carol <br> Legitimate threat <br><br>She is going to break before Episode 10. Just in time to join the fight against the real threat.</br></br></br></br>  Some drawfag should make a Symphogear version of this:<br><br> DO NOT FIST AUTOSCORER GIRLS </br></br>  <br>Who wants a big hug? That's right, Carol does!</br>  <br>I thought she's going to die in Ep 7.</br>  <br>That's Genjuuro.</br>  <br>That would be Maria. She is going to "die".</br>  Remove miracles.  <br> Autoscorers sucking you dry. <br>Aww yeah that...wait, no, shark teeth. NO.</br></br>  <br>Please don't kill Hibiki. She's just a little insane, she doesn't deserve to be removed.</br>  <br> the page is protected <br>Anyone with a wiki account here? Some facts must be corrected.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is a very disturbed child. She needs to be put down.</br>  <br>Both bridge bunnys will die in fact they will all die when Red gets on that sub.</br>  <br>CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGES SYMPHOGEARS</br>   people will now watch HS instead of waiting for based commie   Just watched both episode HS put out and their wage slave translators make Commie look like native speakers. Seriously how are you paying someone and they fuck up that bad on top of the vomit educing type setting.  <br>They wont. The villains have to be redeemable and them killing people for real would make them immune to befriending.</br>  <br>I just wait for accurate subs every week so this changes nothing for me. <br><br><br>The doll with razor blade hands will not be befriended.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you care about other people? They can watch what they want, I'll wait for Commie for sure.</br>  <br>Elfnein is going to die. Really, they won’t kill off anyone else, and there aren’t a lot of things Kaneko would put in that would make nips uncomfortable. <br><br>There’s a brutally on screen dismembered loli.</br></br></br>  H&amp;D WHEN?  <br>The Autoscorers already killed a shitton of people. Besides, they're just killer machines. Doll joint terminators.<br><br>To be perfectly honest, redeeming Carol would also be fucking retarded after her Autoscorers killed so many people already.<br><br>  "You caused alot of people to die, but hey, I like your hat, let's be friend!" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria killed tons of people and was still befriended.</br>  <br>She was protecting civilians.</br>  <br>Chris killed loads of people with Solomon's cane though.<br>That why she turned all angsty near the end of G.</br></br>  <br>Yup</br>    I want to see Hibiki beat and tear one of the dolls to death extremely brutally.<br><br>It would probably be the red one, after it stabs Miku.</br></br>  <br> the way this post was written <br>this is why HS subs was a bad idea.</br></br>  <br>We didn't see her killing anybody on screen, though.<br><br>Carol orders her dolls to fuck some people up.<br><br><br>I would love that.<br><br>Especially with Carol crying like a scared little girl while watching.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Discussion of episode though</br></br>  Befriending/befisting regardless of the casualties is par for the course with Symphogear. Chris being the best example by a landslide, followed by Miku,  I'LL JUST SING GUNGNIR AWAY FROM YOU  Maria, and DMJii befriending each other. Big bads were taken down in both seasons, however. <br><br>I want to see if Carol will keep her big bad status until the end of the season.</br></br>  <br> The Autoscorers already killed a shitton of people. <br>We don't actually know they're dead.<br>I mean, yeah, they're PROBABLY all dead, but it hasn't been confirmed.<br><br>Maria only killed soldiers that were firing on civilians.<br><br>Chris only ever used the Cane against Geahs. In fact she deliberately lead them to unpopulated areas, against Fine's orders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to see if Carol will keep her big bad status until the end of the season. <br>Nah, whoever created Carol will show up to fuck things up</br></br>  <br>You mean shitosting about subs.</br>  <br>We do not know if kissing kills.</br>  <br>I think there'll still be planty room for discussion when Commie release their version. They're faster than with G after all.</br>  <br> Carol being a homunculus specifically created to create other homunculuses <br><br>Oh boy. I can't wait.  Wait, does that mean Carol is genderless? </br></br></br>  <br>I'm fairly certain a bullet to the head does though</br>  <br>Why would I want to discuss the episode with people that don't understand what the characters are even saying? "I can't remember the words".</br>  <br>If she doesn't it's going to make Hibiki's arc another wet fart where no one learns anything just like last season. Her entire moral dilemma completely loses its teeth if Carol isn't absolutely serious.</br>  <br>What if Elfnein created Carol, and she's just fucking with us?</br>  <br>You do know they both look the same right?<br><br>They're both genderless, correct</br></br></br>  <br>It was in autodefense, and the guy looked like a faggot anyway.</br>  Plot twist: Carol is not destroying the world literally.  <br>I would like that a lot. She probably sets up the Gears to destroy the world themself.</br>  Does Carol have an age? A physical one, I mean.  <br>Unknown. Probably a few hundred years old since her dad got burned at a stake and that doesn't happen too much nowadays.</br>  <br>Europe is called the 'dark continent' or something now, so you never know.</br>  <br>Well, we don't know how the other countries are. We did see London, but we don't know what happened to the Euro zone following what happened to Greece.</br>  <br>How can I fear something this cute?</br>  <br>I want to bully her.</br>  <br>I want to rub her hair as she gives orders to her dolls while she tries to maintain a straight face</br>  <br>Everybody wants to bully her. Take a ticket.<br>Or we can all go together simultaneously, and hope at least one of us is still alive by the time we reach her hat to take it off.</br></br>  Biki is a baka!  <br>I wonder how many anon will flip their shit if they decide to kill off Carol for real.</br>  I want to  undo Carol's braid .  this is why symphogear is AOTY  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>I don't get it</br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  After listening to Exterminate a few more times now, I've really started to like it. Definitely more than Vitalization and it's pretty tough competition to Synchrogazer.  <br>Im starting to like Exterminate as well. I believe that much like Vitalization, its an acquired taste. It takes a lot of listening to appreciate the intricasy of the song. <br><br><br>Right now for me its<br>Vitalization&gt;Synchrograzer&gt;=Extermi<wbr>nate<br>but by the end of the season it will probably be more like<br>Vitalization=Exterminate&gt;=Synchroga<wbr>zer</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did they give Kirika a hotblooded metal song while Chris was given a meh song?  <br>FIS girls &gt; original girls. Satelight agrees, don't bother them about it.</br>  <br>I don't even mind it. TRUST HEART is amazing and one of the 2 best songs of GX even though it's not entirely the same style as Chris's previous songs.</br>    Hello, fellow Mikafags.<br><br>Have a nice day.</br></br>  <br>Chris always tried mitigating civilian casualties and thought she was helping people, hence her conflict. Hibiki is trying to befriend an insane loli with killer dolls.</br>  Why only the memories of dudes?<br><br>Where's the dead women?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki probably thinks otherwise considering she saw Carol cry. Not really much of a defense, but that's what Hibiki is like.</br>  <br>That's gay</br>  I want to invade Carol's privacy.  <br> FIS girls &gt; original girls. <br>Only in terms of being sexy.</br></br>    <br>Very good, thank you</br>  <br> that's what Hibiki is like <br>A blubbering retard? Yeah, we've caught on.</br></br>  If you held a gun to Miku's head would Hibiki let you shoot her? You're human after all.    <br>Why would you do that</br>  <br>She'd be paralyzed with fear, but if you actually killed miku she'd probably snap, and go berserker mode even if it meant she had to impale gungnir into herself.</br>  <br>Miku is the only thing Hibiki will protect even if it requires punching humans or throwing away her own life.</br>  <br>That's an unfair situation given that any sort of threatening action would just result in you shooting Miku, so if anything Hibiki's only option would be to do what she usually does.</br>  I want Elfnein to kill Carol and become the final boss.  <br>What if I told her that she has to kill me if she doesn't want her to die? Either way she'll be breaking her one rule.</br>  <br>Miku can throw weighted objects over 1000 feet.<br>If you're just holding a gun to her head I'm sure she could move fast enough to avoid you shooting and beat out your reaction time of her moving.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry Miku it's just that your waifu's ideals are so ludicrous I can't help but want to see them break. It's not you, it's her. You understand.</br>  <br> yfw elfnein is the real carol and the carol we've seen is just a decoy </br>  <br>Male privilege.</br>  DESS DESS DESS  <br>Carol.<br>Please.<br>Into the dungeon. Take your hat.</br></br></br>  <br>She was ready to remove Ver because he was exception to her "we can understand each other" delusion. If you cross the line, she will kill you.</br>  <br>Carol is right though. She's an idiot and has ideals that would never work.</br>  <br>Exterminate is definitely my favorite of the OPs. I really like both Vitalization and Synchrograzer, don't get me wrong, but Exterminate is the only one I can just sit down and listen to on repeat.</br>  <br>Ver wasn't a cute girl like me.</br>  Is Hibiki going to go Unlimited Gungnir's Work?  Years later and I still can't get over how stupid Shirabes Geah is.<br><br>I'm glad they decided to not add any new Geah users because they clearly ran out of ideas.</br></br>  <br>When did she attempt to kill Ver though? She even stopped Maria from killing him.</br>  <br>I think you're gay and stupid but I don't go around telling everyone how gay and stupid you are faggot.</br>  <br>I still love it.</br>  <br>Kind of true, Hibiki attempted to beat the shit out of Miku when she got mind controlled, afterall.</br>  <br> hating on Shul Shagana <br>Shirabe isn't even close to my favorite gear user but Senki Zesshou Twintails was inevitable regardless, and the Heelies are adorable. That and seriously, flying around with buzzsaws looking like some sort of hourglass of death? Shul Shagana is great.</br></br>  <br> Dainsleif will be a gear, since it isn't a complete relic <br>I kind of hope Garie just flat out steals gungnir instead.</br></br>  <br>It's just because Agematsu is a twintail faggot.</br>  <br>Unlimited Dáinsleif Work maybe.</br>  <br>But they might also put a little bit of Dainsleif into everyone's gear to repair and upgrade them.<br>Their pendants are different in the official art and opening.</br></br>  <br>That scene after "My life... is symphogear!". DMJii had to stop her.</br>  <br> everybody gets a little bit of the magical bloodlust murdersword embedded in their geah <br><br>I don't see this backfiring in any way at all</br></br></br>  Every thread until you like it.<br/>  <br> everyone gets the chance to go into rage and berserkermode <br>Would be glorious.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I'm calling that as being Dr Ver's personal touch. They're all V changes afterall.</br>  <br>Literally saved the episode.<br><br>Well, that and DESS DESS DESS.</br></br></br>  Will Hibiki start using Dainslef and give Maria Gungnir?<br><br>Is dainslef a very edgy and powerful relic that will transform Hibiki into a berserk like monster, like the one from the logo?</br></br>  <br>Don't think too much about it, just do it.</br>  <br> saved <br><br>Chris, Hibiki, and Tsubasa needed some saving, but I can't remember the episode being in need of saving.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria is obviously not using Gungnir in the OP.</br>  <br><br>Watch the OP.</br></br>  <br><br>I've watched it but it seems like I'm missing something</br></br>  <br><br>Nothing in the op saying she can't use it temporarily until it breaks, because Carol wants it broken and Hibiki can't even do that right now.</br></br>  Will Maria finally get new attack cards with Airgetlam.  <br><br>Clearly, Maria is not using Gungnir in the OP, thus it's highly improbable that they'll have Hibiki give it to her and have Hibiki use Dainslief.<br><br>Maria MIGHT use Gungnir next episode as an emergency measure kind of thing, but there's no chance of a permanent gear exchange. She's shown in the OP using a different gear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's dainslef?</br>  <br>It's so stupid that it becomes cool</br>  I bet Carol would calm down immensely if she just got some dick. It's the cure for everything.  <br>A sword.</br>  <br>To be fair, there is still the (rather slim) possibility of the OP being a bait&amp;switch.</br>  <br><br>A very nice looking demon sword</br></br>  <br> it doesn't have to be beef <br>It's clearly  Carol's dad </br></br>  <br>Someone turn this frown upside down please</br>  I don't like idea of Maria using Gungnir because Hibiki can't. I want Bikkie to be in danger. Bullied by dolls. Tortured. This girl needs to realize she herself needs, and is worth, protecting. There will be no lesson to learn if she will be saved by friends again, or will have to find temporary determination to save Miku again.  <br>For all we know, it could also be  Heavenrend </br>  <br><br><br>She's being shown with Maria's gear multiple times in the OP.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying they have Budget to change the OP that much </br>  <br>A norse sword made by the same dwarf who made Gungnir<br> Once drawn, it must kill a man before it could be returned to the sheath. A blow from this magical sword never failed to kill or cause a wound that never healed.  <br>It's pretty evil</br></br></br>    <br>Is that gae bolg in sword form?</br>  Let's Salsa  <br> made by the same dwarf  <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>It didn't work for Chris.</br>  <br>So, who is Hibiki going to scar for life?</br>  <br>Miku's hymen.</br>  <br><br> inb4 the mystery character is that dwarf who reincarnates like Fine because he has unfinished business </br></br>  <br> Implying it is still intact after the beating in G </br>  <br>The one in her heart or the one in her vagina?</br>  <br>Hibiki's most important things are probably like 1. Miku, 2. Gungnir. Having it taken away from her because she isn't good enough to use it anymore would probably affect her very strongly.</br>  <br>That's what I heard /a/nons say.</br>  <br>Hibiki annihilated Mikus heart hymen long ago.</br>  <br> Dorfs name is Muramasa </br>  <br>But we don't need that kind of impact. Hibiki just now was forced to see that because of her decision to not hurt Carol she caused death. No reason to kick her even deeper into depression, instead it's now time for something that will finally teach Hibiki her own value.</br>  <br>Was it rape?</br>  <br>Gungnir isn't that important because she tried to return it to Maria in G finale.</br>  <br> It must kill a man before it could be returned to the sheath <br> Give it to the girl whose conflict is not being able to hurt anyone <br>Great idea</br></br></br>  <br>Jus have it hanging out of its sheathe. I haven't had my sword in a sheathe for over 20 years.</br>  <br>No. Dain made Dainsleif. The sons of Ivaldi made Gungnir.</br>  <br>You poor bastard.</br>  <br>She could just kill herself with it.</br>  <br>No. However, Hibiki heart-raped Chris and FIS.</br>  <br>She was just being nice.</br>  <br><br> Are you jewish? </br></br>  Carol is cool and intimidating, not cute at all!    <br><br>She's cute and cool and intimidating at the same time, just like an Elin Berserker.</br></br>  Why is Airgetlamh a dagger?  <br><br>It's a snake sword.</br></br>  <br>Because Maria likes swords.</br>  I want Carol to fuck me in the ass while staring in my face with that ice cold glare of hers.  <br> reverse gripping a whip <br>This seems really inefficient.</br></br>  <br> snake sword animation <br>I can already imagine the QUALITY.</br></br>  <br>She's useless, might as well look cool while being useless.</br>  <br> whip <br>No, it is snek sord.</br></br>  <br>Carol is a girl, she can't fuck you.</br>  <br>She is an assassin in this season.</br>  <br>Can girl fuck girl?</br>  <br>Snake sword, whip sword, chain sword, what's the difference?</br>  <br>Good for her, Lancers have the worst luck.</br>  Why is it that fan fiction doesn't exist in Japan? I'm not complaining, but it's seems odd that with all these doujins that it's 100% porn.  Only porn doujins get scanned.  What is LN    most doujins are not porn<br>it's just the ones that you look at that are porn</br>  <br>They just make up their own original characters and call it a "light novel".<br><br>The quality of writing is the same as fan fiction.</br></br></br>   100% porn <br>Absolutely not. All-ages doujinshi are the majority, but simply never get scanned.<br><br>I can tell why. I have scanned an all-ages one, but the viewing statistics are abysmal.</br></br></br>  <br> tha pic <br> filename starts with 14 <br>hi newfriend</br></br></br>  <br>I just grabbed if off the archive. I don't save every single image that I might use.</br>  <br>The only all age doujins that get any kind of traction on /a/ are the Fate ones.</br>  What was the doujinshi based around a ~30 year old christmas cake Mami who was jealous of all the other megucas and their successful lives?  <br> Why is it that fan fiction doesn't exist in Japan? I'm not complaining, but it's seems odd that with all these doujins that it's 100% porn. <br>It probably does. <br><br>A good point by  .<br> They just make up their own original characters and call it a "light novel". <br> The quality of writing is the same as fan fiction. <br><br>I guess Japs are way better at monetizing their work than other regional Fan Fiction Scenes.<br><br>(with the Exception of Fifty Shades of Twilight)<br><br>I bet even Twilight is Fanfiction of some kind. Just more subtle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reads glorified machine translations of Japanese young adult fiction <br> judges quality of writing <br>Pretty ebin, though you forgot the usual comment about two LNs (the ones you've "read") being good.</br></br></br>  <br> all-ages doujinshi are the majority <br>Well, it's only partially true. It depends of a series. I think the big series like Touhou are the main reason for this majority. Many series have mostly pornographic doujinshi. <br><br><br>So you don't like yuri? <br> Exhentai <br> girls_only <br> at least half is non-h </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's very easy to enter the manga industry in Japan. The "comics authority" bullshit we have in America doesn't exist there. <br><br>A lot of manga looks like they're done by amateurs; that's because they are.</br></br>  <br>People submit short novels and stories to pixiv all the time.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/novel/search.p<wbr>hp?s_mode=s_tag&amp;word=%E3%81%8D%E3%8<wbr>2%93%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D%E3%83%A2%E3%<wbr>82%B6%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AF%20%E7%99%BE<wbr>%E5%90%88</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  Why does everyone keep saying this guy is gay? It's obvious as fuck he's in love with Asuka.  <br>The real question is when this fujoshit will stop making threads. Dude no one gives a shit about this faggot. Go back to tumblr.</br>  <br>He's not a faggot, he likes girls.</br>  <br>He loves Asuka? Since when?</br>  <br> responding to bait <br> bumping this shitty thread </br></br>  <br>It's been a while since I've last seen the show. Did it happen in the new movies or something?</br>  <br>Because he acts in a way that's "stereotypically" gay. If you have sex on the brain, you'll inevitably interpret every little thing as something related to sex or homosexuality or incest or rape or child molestation or some other thing</br>  <br>He's not gay, because he's not male.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, and we can't forget the "cucking". That's even worse than all the others, since most people aren't gay and this kind of thing viscerally affects anyone who has sexual hormones in their body at all</br>  <br>They don't even meet aside of the manga.<br><br>The pairing is popular because he saves her ass in the pachinko or tries to advice her in the girl's bathroom in the manga and she gets tsundere max.</br></br></br>  <br> The pairing is popular  <br>Landwhale pls</br></br>  <br>I'm still so confused as to why AsukaxKaworu is ten times more popular than ShinjixRei</br>  <br>I'm not a landwhale. The pairing is fucking popular even if I don't think it makes sense.<br><br><br>You and me brother. Or KaworuxRei because at least that one makes more sense. They were joined together in EoE... and Rei I has a crush on Kaworu in some spinoffs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Koreans</br>  <br>I am genuinely curious about this, because I thought this ShinjixRei thing was the most popular thing ever (for some reason, which I genuinely don't get, because it's so psychologically crazy that the whole "fetish" makes no sense to me personally)</br>  <br> and Rei I has a crush on Kaworu in some spinoffs <br>Because of this scene.<br>I assume it isn't popular because it looks like incest.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, this is definitely one of those things where you're just so similar to someone and know them so well that the whole "romance" thing is just bizarre and weirdly extraneous. Kind of like actual siblings in actual families in the real world</br>  <br>Japanese Reifags don't ship</br>  <br><br>GOOD. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU. YOU ARE WONDERFUL</br></br>  <br> I assume it isn't popular because it looks like incest. <br>Why the fuck isn't incest more popular in Eva? ShinjixRei (actual) and KaworuxRei (only in appearance). Isn't this supposed to be a big fetish in Japan?</br></br>  <br>KaworuxShinji is the most popular pairing (not that's strange or surprising, and reason why they have backpedaled about Kaworu's gender a lot of times to make it 'less gay'). AsukaxShinji is also popular. After them, MarixAsuka.</br>  <br>Because in the show ShinjixRei hardly gets any teasing in comparison to ShinjixAsuka and ShinjixKaworu, and her fans are much more interested in shipping her with themselves. <br>With KaworuxRei I guess it's the same deal, but they love him with Asuka for some reason.</br></br>  <br> Rei doesn't have a single popular pairing <br>Isn't it sad</br></br>  Fuck off  <br>The nips don't want her with anyone but themselves. Or alternatively, her clones.</br>  <br>Kaworu's love for shinji is like a parental love, he's giving Shinji the affection of a parent that Shinji never received from his own.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128345331 <br>Women aren't the only shippers.</br>  <br>Probably because it just seems really weird to imagine her in a romantic relationship.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128345121 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128345331 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128345395 <br>Don't use emoticons on /a/</br></br></br>  <br>They never tried to make it less "gay". Being gay is the whole reason it's even popular. Fujos don't give a fuck about any gender shit.<br>And Mari x Asuka is the 2nd most popular. Asuka and Shinji doesn't get as much fan content as it, but it does have a lot of fans. Just not as much as the Mari one.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Back in the 90s a good chunk of Kawoshin doujinshi had Shinji genderbent into a girl so it would be okay for nips. Then again, the ones making those doujinshi were guys.</br>  <br>Shinji and Gendo are the only people who even talk to/about Kaworu. Asuka never acknowledges his existence even when she's fighting his Eva.</br>  <br> The pairing is fucking popular <br>Stop lying. Holy shit. <br>The only legit popular pair is Kaworu and Shinji. Kaworu and anyone else is minuscule.</br></br></br>  <br>ReixAnyone is incest</br>  <br>That's because Kaworu is Shinji's imaginary friend. He doesn't exist outside of his mind.<br><br><br>Rei x anyone besides Kaworu is incest, ironically.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're exaggerating again. I have no idea why you're trying to convince people of this, it's a fujoshit pairing. Anno didn't make it to be "straight". He never tried to make it "straight" nor gives a shit about it being gay. It makes far more money that way anyhow.</br>  <br>I didn't see that, there's plenty of old m/m doujins still.<br>There's even an officially licensed (by Gainax) Kawoshin doujin with soft gay porn in it.</br></br>  <br>Kaworu and Shinji have gotten at least THREE prize figures/statues with them together: this one, one with the pose from the Q poster and one where they're just sitting together.</br>  <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/3821/4cf597b6<wbr>9f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/3860/45eea873<wbr>e7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/3908/11997ed3<wbr>2e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/3908/11997ed3<wbr>2e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/3911/100ff3bd<wbr>30/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/5056/81ad6835<wbr>f6/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Only kaworufujos try to convince people pairings are more popular than they actually are.<br>Asuka x Kaworu or Rei x Kaworu are not popular. Most of the art for either are few and by the same artist. Nobody wants their girl with that faggot and fujos don't want their boy being hetero.</br></br>  <br>I don't know why they'd bother pairing Kaworu with anyone else when it's so ridiculously clear that Shinji alone makes his s2 engine go doki doki</br>  <br>Why would fujos care about those pairings if they're fucking fujos?</br>  <br>I've just seen a lot of Asuka x Kaworu doujinshi on sad panda lately, I assume it must have a considerable following.</br>   You will never crush Kaworu in your giant hand <br> You will never watch him smear raspberry headjam on the sides of an entry plug <br>Feels bad</br></br>  Kaworu was a mistake. The only flaw in the series.  <br>Sounds hot</br>  <br>I don't think being gay is the whole reason. Kaworu's groomed to be what we want to comfort us. Like Death from The Sandman. I'm a straight man, and I'll have Kaworu as my lover over Rei and Asuka because of the emotional comfort he could provide.</br>  <br>0/10 Could've been higher quality</br>  <br>Rei stands on her own as a character.</br>  <br> Rei <br> stands <br>Hah, I get it.</br></br></br>  <br>Towers above the rest like a giant.</br>  <br>Anon I think what you want is a mother's love more than anything. That whole unconditional love/comfort ideal. You really need to get it together and face reality because real people are not going to be like that, selfless and lacking in personality beyond being "nice". Don't get me wrong though, Rei nor Asuka aren't good choices, but a fantasy escapism isn't good either.</br>  <br>Female otaku =/= Fujoshi<br><br>Kaworu is a sex symbol on the anime fandom and arguably the main reason why a woman would pick Eva (we're not in the 90s anymore). While many women are fine self-inserting as Shinji, some women would prefer to sefl-insert as one of the girls. Women like to root for het ships too but only trapfags like Shinji</br></br></br>  <br>But likewise, there are guys who would rather self-insert as Kaworu than Shinji for being too girly when fucking their waifu, thus why LAK and LRK have supporters.</br>  <br> That whole unconditional love/comfort ideal. You really need to get it together and face reality <br>Not him but you shouldn't expect it from everyone you meet obviously, but everyone needs comfort from time to time, especially Shinji who had no one to confide in or tell him he was worthy of anything.<br><br>Speaking of unconditional comfort, that's actually used as a form of therapy and it does help the patient/person receiving it.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncon<wbr>ditional_positive_regard<br>One of my psychology profs from college actually went to someone who practiced it and gushed when talking about it. From the way it sounded it's EXACTLY like talking to a Kaworu for a whole session.</br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can literally do the same exact thing with a computer program that spits out the last few words you inputted in the form of a question.</br>  <br>Because it involves him. Kaworu fujos have an obsession with shipping cause shipping is all he has. Plus I recall a shitposter who likes to dump Asuka/Kaworu whenever they get butthurt in eva threads. It's like a defensive mechanism even though at most people feel indifferent or confused.</br>  <br>Shinji is hated by every demographic, except for the trapfags.</br>  <br>If it's het pairings they're shipping/posting, then they aren't fujos. It's that simple.</br>  <br>Not the Rei fans.</br>  <br>Fujos don't only do rotten same/sex pairings. They do rotten different/sex pairings too.<br><br>You're also obviously a faggot since you use terms like "het".<br><br>I think you're disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fujos don't only do rotten same/sex pairings. <br>Yes they do you retarded nigger.<br>Fujoshi by definition are women who ship same sex pairings. If you're shipping dicks and vaginas together, you aren't a fujo. This isn't fucking rocket science.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you getting triggered by the word "het"? People use it because it's shorter and easier.</br>  <br>Nah, it's fujos. Likely just like you. They ship gay and still have a folder for "shitpsoting" whenever they get offended people think they are annoying.</br>  <br>Nothing beats real human contact and interaction.</br>  lol delusionfags  <br>Unless you are a huge newfag, the het posting follows them talking about or posting gay shit. Because fujoshit get butthurt for one reason or another.</br>  <br>If they're seriously shipping male/female pairings, then they aren't fujo. That's it.</br>  <br>Reifags hate everything since 3.0</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Never argued otherwise. But what the character provides is coddling and unconditional love akin to a mother's for nothing. It's like the ultimate fantasy because you don't have to try and build the relationship or anything, everything is handed to you on a silver platter.</br>  <br>Yeah right. Someone post the picture of Rei kicking Shinji's face in.</br>  <br>Good thing the shitposter isn't seriously shipping it and only resorts to it when butthurt. Seriously, stop trying m8.</br>  <br>Except Shinji.<br><br><br>Not representative of Rei fans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Misato and Kaji?<br>You could also list Gendo and Yui but sometimes I wonder if Yui truly cared for the guy.</br></br>  <br>Okay, cool. But we're talking about people seriously shipping it, remember?<br>For example Aihara-Otome, who's also a hardcore Rei/Shinji shipper:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/827793/5ee33e<wbr>d815/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/192108/4824e1<wbr>9bbe/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/202362/b47355<wbr>9085/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>They do ship everything.<br><br><br>Only tumblrites and fujos use it.<br><br><br>They ship everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not representative of Rei fans <br>It was drawn by a Reifag</br></br>  <br>Not representative of Rei fans.</br>  <br> Herewego <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J-m<wbr>Vhf7n6yc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>This is wrong.<br>Most of the female fanbase likes him, and shippers self-insert as him for LRS, LAS as well as kawoshin.</br></br>  <br>As far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>Unless you can't read, the discussion began with this. <br>Which is specifically referring to a shitposter on /a/.</br></br>  <br>The shippers who self-insert as him don't really care about him. They're just using him for self-insertion and a tool of validation for their waifu.<br>But a lot of Kawoshin fujos love Shinji, they're always drawing him and gushing over how cute he is on twitter and shit.</br></br>  <br>Which is why I said most of the female fanbase likes him for who and what he is.</br>  <br>I wouldn't call treating Shinji like a cute object as "loving". They aren't better than any other shippershit. The fact that you follow twitter and what they say says a lot about you, but that isn't healthy.</br>  <br>How the actual fuck does anyone manage to self-insert as this guy</br>  <br>The post you're replying to is me, saying fujos don't ship straight pairings which was the whole beginning of this conversation. Or else they wouldn't be fucking fujos. You don't just get to come up with new definitions for terms because you feel like it dumbass.</br>  <br>I'm a Shinjifag, of course I'll follow twitter as that's where most of his quality art and news related to him gets posted. Those artists just happen to be girl fujos, confirming my point.<br>You don't see Reifags or other waifufags drawing Shinji unless he's fucking their respective waifu, off-model and all.</br></br>  <br>Then your concern is shit. There's far more drawings of Asuka or Shinji abusing Shinji. Either beating him or raping him, take your pick.<br><br>But I don't say it's necessarily representative of the respective fans.<br><br>Understanding whether or not they hate Shinji is best understood in how they discuss and talk about the character, whether they defend it or not. Rei fans are the only ones left defending Shinji.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka or Kaworu*</br>  <br> Rei fans are the only ones left defending Shinji </br>  <br>You mean you're a fujoshit, so of course you're follow fellow fujoshits. Yeah, it's much better to see Kaworu fucking Shinji because it's more "intellectual" or "deep", amiright. <br>Goddamn fujos can't just admit they like what gets them off.</br></br>  <br>They pretty much are. <br><br>Pity isn't defense or respect.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd much rather see Shinji happy and smiling with the one he loves then turned into a faceless slobbering monkey man fucking the shit out of Asuka or Rei, thank you.</br>  <br>She's literally his voice actor, she hardly counts.<br>Even then, she isn't defending him as much as she's blaming him while also feeling sorry for him.<br><br>I read some statements from her, although they might have been a paraphrasing of things said during recording, she said "this is all my shinji kuns fault" or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but<br>You are seriously retarded if you think fujoshi don't ship other types of pairings. Many of them in nip fanbases like GL, BL and NL. Even if 90% of their art is BL, they still can like non gay pairings. Doesn't make them suddenly not a fujo.</br></br>  <br>The only thing Reifags are defending is Shinji choosing to rescue her in 2.0. Again, they only care when it concerns them or their waifu. They couldn't give less of a shit about Shinji's struggles and feelings in regards to Misato, Gendo, and now Kaworu. You fuckers are so fake it's hilarious.</br>  <br>That's bullshit. They're defending the entire character and always have.</br>  <br>Hilarious. They couldn't give less of a fuck when it doesn't concern their waifu, same as all the other waifufags. Which is why you NEVER see a Reifag drawing Shinji or posting about him on twitter and such.</br>  <br>Yeah because that doesn't happen in the inverse in fujoshit doujins. The hypocrisy is palpable.<br><br> m-muh shippershit is b-better than the other shippershits!! </br></br></br>  <br>I've seen them defending the whole blaming Shinji for being worse than hitler thing 3.33 tried to pull. But not only him as pretty much everyone but Kaworufags thought it was bullshit.</br>  <br>Blatantly untrue though. The defense covers every point, also saving Rei. <br><br>It's more accurate to say that Kaworu fans or Asuka fans don't care about Shinji since they'll aggressively attack or blame the character all depending. Not the case with Rei fans.<br><br><br>Nope. They're the only waifufags to still defend Shinji. Kaworu fans only see him as a shipping accessory.<br><br> Which is why you NEVER see a Reifag drawing Shinji or posting about him on twitter and such. <br>Drawing Shinji or posting about him doesn't imply defense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in the inverse in fujoshit doujins <br>Only in the Mangaverse Kawoshin doujinshi. Which is understandable, they act like any rape-y BL generic shit couple in there. Thanks Sadamoto.</br></br>    <br> fujoshi's defense is the fact that some artists on twitter draw him as a fuccboi <br>I'm not even a reifag but you gotta come better than that<br>Fujoshi and diehard fanboys are the only ones defending the shit 3.33 pinned on him</br></br></br>  <br><br> let me make up lies I can't prove and hope people believe me! <br>Too cute. <br>Last time I checked the Reifags on twitter and 2ch couldn't even be arsed to even mention Shinji's name. It's all about their waifu to them, no one else matters.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kaworufag please.<br><br>Asuka fans still enjoy Shinji's suffering as revenge from 2.0 and other times. You never saw a Rei fan hate on Shinji for failing to save Rei, but it's a common complaint on e.g Evageeks and some times on /a/ that he didn't save Asuka.<br><br>Kaworu fans gladly discussed that Shinji should die to repent for his sins during the generals and from what I'm told, it's a topic over at /cm/ as well.<br><br>While most sane fans thought it was bullshit, there wasn't a single Reifag who thought it wasn't that I've seen.<br><br>You'd gladly watch Shinji die or be tortured as long as it implies he's Kaworu's eternal boytoy. I don't think posting a twitter image of Shinji getting stabbed by the lance or longinus or crying in Kaworu's arms make it better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sadamoto has a rape fetish.</br>  <br>Posting Shinji's name on twitter isn't an act of defense, neither is shipping him with their favorite character.<br><br>Seeing Shinj's side of things and trying to understand the situation is. Kaworu fans on the whole accepting that Shinji is the one to blame because it's the idea 3.0 peddles is the direct opposite.<br><br>You'll see Reifags say it was poor form of Rei to slap Shinji, but never you'll see an Asuka fan say Shinji didn't have it coming or a Kaworu fan admit that Kaworu betrayed Shinji and attacked him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most Asuka fans do too, you know. Like he was getting what he deserved for trying to save Rei.</br>  <br><br> please believe my headcanons, you guise ;) </br></br>  <br>Yes because one butthurt, insane and biased fujoshit's word is somehow than a non-shipper's and non-waifufag. Keep telling yourself fujoshits drawing Shinji in dresses crying into Kaworu's arms on twitter counts for shit. It may delude you, but not anyone with a lick of common sense.<br><br>I seriously haven't seen an argument this retarded before.</br></br></br>  <br> headcanon <br> actual facts <br> kawofujoshi in charge of differentiating reality from fantasy <br>Head back to tumblr.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As one from the generals, I can say whenever there were arguments about the culpability of Shinji, I was on that side that defended him. And I could tell a lot more were as well. There will be a lot of trolls and spiteful ones of course. And then kaworufags just plain shit stirring. But saying all is an exaggeration.</br>  <br>Anno ships his head cannon of him and Ikuhara.</br>  <br><br> I may not have any citations or evidence for any of this bullshit I spout, but I SWEAR it's true! <br> please, you have to believe me! <br>Oh, it's getting desperate now. So uguu.<br><br>Who were the ones who participated in the Shinji birthday threads, Reifags? Who were the ones making artwork and celebrating that day every single year without miss, Reifags? Oh yeah, not you faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's always been your generic BL tropes with them. Fujos turn him into your typical submissive uke and Kaworu is your generic seme. So much for love for actual characterization.</br>  <br><br>gee I wonder what this scene was a metaphor for</br></br>  Most of you don't really like Shinji, fujoslugs use him for his yaoi shipping fantasies, without that he's a selfish pig, Asukafags and Reifags simply don't care about him except for the monster cock doujins.<br><br>I do remember back in 3.33 generals that Kaworufags were the ones against Shinji because Anno himself was saying he was the one who should shoulder all the blame, the OST track names and all that shit Kaworufags like to cherrypick.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no. You're indifferent to him. You couldn't care less until he does something for your waifu, and only THEN will you pretend to care. <br>A Kawoshin fujoshi drew this picture, by the way. Celebrating Shinji's rescue of and relationship with Rei.</br></br>  <br>First one ain't a reifag. You are the one trying to convince people fujoshit art turning Shinji into a fuccboi means shit and backing it up with nothing but<br> m-muh feelings <br> m-muh otp </br></br></br>  <br> Anno himself was saying he was the one who should shoulder all the blame <br><br>But he changed the plot so misato was the one directly responsible for his death?</br></br></br>  Busy day today, and this nearly slipped my mind because of it.

First for cute cat waifu in the bottom left.  <br>do you think he has mindrape slave fantasies after this?</br>  <br>it's a dog</br>  <br>Mindbroken Sinbad doujins when?</br>  <br>Is this a Stargate manga?</br>  This is pretty pathetic. Are you telling me Kou's entire intelligence network relied on Al Thamen? <br><br>They desrve to get BTFO.</br></br>  <br>holy shit, the fujopandering in AoS is off the charts right now</br>  and sinbad still has the mind control magic in kougyoku's brain, so kouha's pretty much the only reliable metal vesser user they have on the frontline, tfw kouha  <br><br>Kouha ;_;</br></br>  <br>When you realise Kouen and his siblings are just shitters</br>  If Aladdin doesn't get involved, this should be done in a couple of chapters.<br><br>But we all know he's going to get involved and protect Kouen. Probably Muu too</br></br>  <br>Magi was never really straight.</br>  <br>Alibaba will come back, Aladdin, they'll do some feelzy feels shit and it'll get some "twist ending"</br>  <br>yeah, they basically relied in At and SSA not doing anything, look how scared they are now that Sinbad is actually trying to attack them, and these are the same people who want to conquer the world</br>  The more I see Kouha and Kougyoku interacting the more I want of them. Such a pity.  <br><br>If anything, this chapter made it clear that she's the kind of woman that would totally let your boss fuck her raw if it meant that you wouldn't get fired.</br></br>  <br>She needs a strong man with a big dick like Sinbad.</br>  <br>I don't even have that much problems with fujo but that's straigth not straight at all.</br>  <br>Judar will probably side with Kouen, since allying with Sinbad wasn't part of his and hakuryuu's edgy plan</br>  <br>Alibab will obviously come too late.<br><br>When has a character who said that he wants to get there before its too late ever gotten there on time?</br></br></br>  The doujins write themselves  Hakuryu ended up as a tool,kek. That oughta teach the kid.  <br>I doubt he'd ally with Kouen, he probably knew about Hakuryuu's plan already, he was already pretty apathetic with Sinbad, and Sinbad only cared about Judal's Al Thamen connection, but who knows</br>  <br>Why does this joke never get old</br>  <br>I guess it depends on how much the manga is planned to go on for, if it's a last arc or something then it'll probably end with a major outcome, if not Aladdin and Alibaba will stop the war again and it'll be some dumbass stalemate until the next arc</br>  <br><br>What's Artemyra's real life counterpart? Heliohapt is obviously Ancient Egypt, but I can't find one for Artemyra.</br></br>  <br>Not like he cares. He's only upset that he's got to rely on someone else to take back his country.<br><br>Pride aside, Hakuryuu is coming out of this with both his country and his sister. Sure, Sinbad is winning the most out of this but Hakuryuu is looking pretty good.</br></br></br>  I'm curious where Rametoto's troops are, considering how there are a lot of ships involved you'd think they're pretty significant  <br>If I remember right, the end of the Al tharmen arc was supposed to mark the middle point of the story, so now there's around 1/3 left to do.</br>  <br>amazons? with you know, Artemis</br>  <br>The amazons.<br><br><br>Im sure sinbad gonna call favours later.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno.</br>  <br>At the start of the AT arc was the halfway point if IIRC so Magi would end at 400-450.</br>  <br>I think this is the moment when Sinbad will show his true colors by killing Kouen despite him surrendering or using Kougyoku to kill Kouha</br>  <br>he fucked up Gyokuen and al thamen too, to be fair he did more than anyone in the whole manga so far, I only dislike the fact that they're forcing Belial into their shit but whatever</br>  <br>I think it'd be more along the lines of Sinbad making Hakuryuu do the dirty work</br>  <br>  Sinbad gonna call favours <br><br>Probably the case.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fucking Anubis and Ra<br>Kou is so screwed</br></br>  Shota Masur is super cute  <br>Is Sinbad the Aizen of Magi?</br>  <br>Maybe it was at the start yeah. Anyway, the conflicts will probably not be settled that fast. I mean, the Reim empire have yet to choose sides and even if Sinbad is the OP character of the story, all the Magi are suspicious or hate him so I can perfectly see most of them siding with the Kou empire just to fuck with him.</br>  This is the latest chapter counting the raws or this is 2 weeks old chapter?  <br>Remember we got the Dark Continent adventure with the Fanalis furryfags still and all the business with David/another spaghetti monster/Arba's return.</br>  <br>Apophis is there too</br>  <br>The Reim Empire is also an ally of the Seven Sea Alliance. <br><br>Right now, the Seven Sea Alliance plus Reim Empire plus Kou Empire under Hakuryuu can probably be considered the world hegemonic power.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh.. So this is getting interesting now<br><br>undropped</br></br></br>  <br>There was a week break</br>  <br>  Reim Empire is also an ally <br><br>Worst fucking allies ever. How long till Sinbad shits on them for disrespecting?</br></br></br>  Is Maader a pedophile or does she has some kind of mother complex?  <br>I doubt any of the magi would ally with Kouen, even Aladdin</br>  <br>Al Thamen was in charge of the country until recently. Super mages who know near everything would not only make your own spy network inconsequential but they would also know you were secretly setting it up and react accordingly.</br>  <br>Fug.</br>  <br>So you just skip the lines of dialogue? Judar knew of Hakuryuu's Original Plan, that and Judar and Hakuryuu formed a bond in their deep edge, Judar was shown not give an damn about any of the Kou but Fish Princess.</br>  <br> Reim Empire is also an ally of the Seven Sea Alliance <br>They aren't. Mu and Sinbad had a conversation between them during the conference which pretty much indicated so.</br></br>  Those heliohapt swords look retarded tbh  <br> for disrespecting? <br>How so? Reim Empire became allies recently when Muu came begging for assistance for his dying Kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Aizen is not that evil</br>  <br>they technically are, it's more of a non agression pact than anything though, also Titus is still the leader so it's up to whatever the fuck he wants to do as well</br>  <br>Is Maader the other motherly person who kidnapped kids in Magi? Or is she a different character?</br>  <br>they technically aren't at all.<br><br>They simply won't invade each other but if one fucks up he gets fucked without hesitation.</br></br></br>  <br> looks identical <br> has the same name <br>what do you think</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a sword, but a scimitar.</br>  Remember when people thought Hakueii would get together with Ren Kouen?<br><br>Between that and the new Seven Seas alliance has anyone ever been BTFO so badly?</br></br>  <br>And he's already made his decision. His decision was to stay out of any conflict between Kou and SSA and ally with Aladdin.<br><br>Again, worst fucking allies. SSA policy is to fuck shit up when they invade their allies and thats what Kouen and co are doing. Reim as part of the SSA are obliged to support Hakuryuu's side.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Otoutos before husbandos</br></br>  Kouen is fucked. What his side will do now?  <br><br>Did you guys forgot this scene?<br>Mu sided with Kouen at the summit</br></br></br>  <br>yeah they are<br><br>that's why I've said they're technically allies but it's more of a non-war agreement</br></br></br>  <br>The far side, running. Hehehe. Or he could seek asylum in Reim and start shit up.</br>  <br>he's just being slippery, but I highly doubt that he'd employ the whole Reim army to a war, if anything they just want to stay out of it</br>  <br>My guess is bring back Al Thamen/Arba or show they defected to his side. Black metal vessels everywhere.</br>   That's the reason why I was brought back <br>I wonder what that means.</br>  <br>Just some awkward wording by Sense most likely.</br>  <br>Yep. Reim joined both Kou and SSA playing both sides, stopping conflict at the summit and ensuring they didn't have to side with one or the other</br>  <br>Even for a scimitar they look retarded</br>  <br>muu did say that the empire is declining, and they'd have to get through magnostadt again which is pretty much a ssa puppet state now</br>  <br>He's still got the shota.</br>  I fucking hate when Ohtaka goes "Aladdin/Alibaba must hurry to the battlefield". It's like the fate of the world isn't allowed to progress anywhere unless they are here.  <br>Sharrkan looks a shit compared to his brother.</br>  <br> Hakuei doesn't want to support her "Now let's plunge our homecountry in a civil war!" little brother <br> some some funny anons call her a slut <br> Hakuei seemingly finds a way to stop the war and save her evil little brother while stopping him from doing what he loves to do the most now <br> some funny anons still call her a slut(plus something about NTR) <br>Nice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well they are the main characters</br>  <br>If it's a woman then it's a slut, no matter the situation</br>  <br>Shit is progressing pretty damn fast.<br>That seems to be why Alibaba needs to get there, stop some bad juju from happening because of it.</br></br>  <br> stop some bad juju from happening because of it <br>It's like the fate of the world isn't allowed to progress anywhere unless they are here.</br></br>  <br>It's a shonen, and they're the two main characters. Of course they will be involved with the most important events taking place. <br><br>However, I still believe that Alibaba and Judar will return after the War has finished.</br></br></br>  <br>Judar wants to fuck Hakuryuu before Sinbad does.</br>  <br>  Hakuei stopping the war <br><br>What? All she did is side with her brother and betray Kouen and co. Sinbad is still going to shit on Kouen in Balbadd.</br></br></br>   Kouen vs Sinbad soon <br>There's no brakes in the hype train.</br>  <br>They weren't there in Alma-Toran when the world needed them and look what happened.</br>   tfw no edgebro <br><br>And some people said he doesn't care.</br></br>  <br>  People hyped <br><br>We all know Sinbad is way stronger than him right? Have you guys not seen how pathetically easy Sinbad has defeated all the other KVs he has faced? And we're talking about some of the strongest KVs in Mira, Kougyoku etc.</br></br></br>  <br>He claimed in this very chapter that he wanted to talk. I doubt it will end peacefully(hence 'seemingly') but her intent is clear.</br>  <br>Not really. Even if he gets back the throne, he's going to exist as one of Sinbad's many puppets. He'll be beholden to the SSA and be hamstrung by his obligations thereof.<br><br>This was the only way he'd realistically get back his empire but it's hard to call this a good move on his part.</br></br></br>  Where is Yamuraiha? I didnt see her any where. Also, is Magi on break this week?  <br>it's not like the ssa has many obligations, don't be a dick and send your troops if I tell you, that's pretty much it</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if she showed up with some magnostadt magicians at some point, it was last week</br>  <br>But he never said that. He said he 's going to Balbadd to end the war. He's obviously going to tell Kouen to surrender which the latter will obviously not do and so a fight will obviously happen.</br>  <br>Yeah, all he has to do is not start unnecessary wars and help the allies when they are in trouble.<br><br>Basically just behave.</br></br></br>  <br>idk, he'd be alone against 3 metal vesser users, like 12 household vessels and an army of troops, if he has a brain he'd surrender, or they can escape with Koumei's magic, unless something unexpected happens in the meanwhile</br>  <br> it's not like the ssa has many obligations <br> don't be a dick <br>That's already too many obligations for poor Hakuryuu.</br></br></br>  Does this mean Alibaba and Judar are already back in their world?  <br>I'm not even sure what they want to do after getting their empire "back", this is the problem with these kind of characters, once their objective is fulfilled then it's like okay what now, like sylvanas, okay arthas died, now what, I guess we'll just fuck around then</br>  <br>Oh, you're right. But Hakuei certainly doesn't want to see her half-siblings(some of whom she admires) and their men. She's like Alibaba and Aladdin.</br>  <br>*doesn't want to see her half-siblings(some of whom she admires) and their men die<br><br><br> I guess we'll just fuck around then <br>That was their plan, yes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> , Sinbad is winning the most out of this but Hakuryuu is looking pretty good. <br><br><br>Oh Hakuryuufags</br></br></br></br>   There are people who think that Sinbad is not a main antagonist of Magi   Just caught up again, damn. Well Magi is fun again, I like this war.<br><br>Also hopefully best girl Kougyoku will be happy again in the near future ;_; <br><br>Alibaba needs to get another metal vessel or some kind of power up and get back there.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>David is</br></br>  <br>inb4 she gets fukt</br>  <br> David <br> not a true hero </br></br>  <br> that face </br>  <br>He got the BBQ down alright.</br>  <br>The most villainous things he have done so far are:<br><br>1)manipulating Kougyoku<br>2)making too many flashy appearances<br><br>I don't doubt the possibility of him being a major antagonist later in the story but so far he is more innocent than Kouen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Kouen is somehow on par with sinbad I will call it bullshit, Sinabd is some kind of special snowflake ,that's basically the point of his character, Kouen is not.</br>  <br>he has the magic shota by his side</br>  <br>Greece?</br>  <br>People are looking forward to some epic fights when its just going to be Kouen desperately trying to defeat him while Sinbad has that trademark poker face toying with him and then switching to a Djinn that will counter him.</br>  What if Sinbad is slowly getting insane by maniacally wanting to unite the world  <br>they are probably the same person</br>  <br>maybe, I guess we'll see what the alaali duo decides to do</br>  <br>we also had a bunch of characters, saying he's super shady and shit</br>  <br>I don't know, Kouen is incredibly OP for no reason whatsoever</br>  <br>No, they are still in space.</br>  <br>Artemyra is related to the name of the Greek Goddess, Artemis Myra though, as a word alone means "Fate, Destiny". Not to mention Pisti means "Faith" in Greek.<br><br>Also, something I noticed: Kina means China in Greek. I wonder if Ohtaka knows it.</br></br></br>    <br>kina means china in basically every language other than english....</br>  <br>I guess this arc will eventually cover how sin learned how to control light &amp; dark rukh</br>  <br>Well I didnt know this. I only know Greek and English.</br>  <br>not really<br>anyway the kanji basically means ancient japan</br></br>  <br>well as far as western languages go, obviously eastern languages usually refer to it by derivations of it's native name zhongguo<br><br>not really, the first kanji is demon, the second is na from nakoku, "ancient japan" would be yamato, like in the king's name</br></br></br>  <br>10/10 rusing sinbad</br>  So, Kina is the name of NotJapan.<br><br>What will be the names of NotBritain and NotAmerica?</br></br>  <br>I don't think there is an America in this series. Really the only reason why people think there's a Japan is because it's an island country.</br>  <br>it's ancient times, britain is a reim province and america is just indians</br>  I really like that even if Sinbad is by all means the "good guy" he comes off as a complete and utter bastard.  <br>And because the king is called Yamato Takeruhiko (Takeru being a different spelling of Takeshi)</br>  Pisti is a huge slut and I want to cum on her tits  <br>And it's somewhere near not-China. And they dress like samurai and wear horns like Oni.<br><br>But why is their leader a mutant?</br></br></br>  <br>I think he looks fine, it just feels like he got those shoulderpads from an mmo</br>  <br>he looks like he is wearing a whole rooftop as a shield</br>    <br>He managed to look kind of derpy even in the last chapter.</br>  <br>Darius looks pretty creepy with his djinn equip</br>  <br>why yamato is so  lewd </br>  <br>i think it's ok, at least he's not a sinbad clone</br>  <br> britain is a reim province <br>Scotland isn't. Get some kilts and Wallace in there.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon. I can see it too now.</br>  Will Aladdin help his fellow shota?  <br>Shota Alliance against Seven Seas Alliance?<br> bring it on </br></br>  <br> Those hips  <br> That hair <br> that delicate face <br> Earrings <br>Give her a pair of chest tumors and we got a cute girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Sin is also a shota.</br>   Let's build a peaceful world together. <br> It's not like that. I didn't want to take my country back this way. <br>Edgemaster is sad he didn't get to go full edge. Wanted to mind control himself into power and kill people himself to satisfy his hateboner.</br></br>  <br>Not America is the Imuchakk. The filthy white man has not taken over their lands.</br>  <br>dem abs tho</br>  <br>An abominable one.</br>  <br>At least he doesn't have to worry about his sister anymore</br>  <br><br><br>When will Hakuryuu/alibaba get their own shota djinn?</br></br></br>  <br>Go to the next page. He's just sad that he has to rely on Sinbad.<br><br>  muh pride </br></br></br>    <br>Alibaba would look weird as a shota if he's next to Aladdin.</br>  <br>Hakuryuu was fine with using Judal's power. Sinbad's just not edgetastic enough to be his ally.</br>  <br> husbando is touching a girl once again <br>It hurts. &gt;Inb4 He was always a slut</br></br>  <br>nah Judal was a follower, now Hakuryuu is the one following.</br>  <br>Anon does this <br>look like someone who is pure?</br></br>  <br>Sinbad's edge is much sharper than Judar's. He's merely hiding it.</br>  So what are the chances that Al Thamen and that bitch are actually dead and this won't just be a plot twist later on?  <br>0/she will return in the worst possible moment</br>  <br>There is a difference. Judar was his subordinate while Sinbad is the one leading shit now.</br>  Guys i have a feeling Sinbad MIGHT be final boss.<br><br>Nah, nevermind, cant be.<br><br><br><br>Fucking Horus</br></br></br></br></br></br>  New page  <br>I bet she's good at hip thrusting ,deep throats, handjobs etc.</br>  <br>I was unfamiliar with this work, but it looks like good hijinks.

Intial D, Slam Dunk, Major, Berserk and FMP maybe some day.</br>  <br>Casshern on hold, my nigga. Series is weird, good but really hard to watch.</br>  <br>Ergo Proxy is the the bottom 20% in terms of how good it is out of everything there.</br>  <br>why not? hikaru no go had an awesome anime, even if you've read the mango</br>  <br>I don't read manga. I have no intention of watching it because I have never looked into what it is even.</br>  <br>I see, that's too bad, but well you already watched a lot of the list so I guess it's ok. I'll give you the animepro stamp on the hand and here're the official papers.</br>  hehe  <br>so you've seen everything on the left list? nice, here's your stamp too</br>  <br>You're still far from obtaining the title of animepro but since you've passed the 20 titles cap I'll give you a well deserved cookie, with a cup of tea</br>  Shit list for normalfags.

Personally I thought that the part with the kids was a bit too long and yeah it was meant to be a pre-arc/build-up arc for dressrosa, but I still thought that it was pretty good as a standalone. The only thing that was really off is that Ceasar was the main villian. The endboss, the last one fighting before baby 5 arrived, should have been Vergo in my opinion. It would also have been good if law took out the arc boss in taht arc instead of luffy who got doffy in dressrosa.  <br>Jinbe fought to a standstill with Ace.<br><br>Fucking Ace.<br><br>The strongest fishman alive, is on par with a guy who was one-shot by an Admiral.<br><br>Fishmen suck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon it's a mongolian picture book<br>I don't think 100% realisim is the intent here</br></br>  <br> but not actually real rubber <br>Yeah, no shit. But his body is still made out of One Piece universe rubber.</br></br>  <br>That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm glad we agree.</br>  <br> real world <br>are you seriously watching one piece going "that's not how it works in the real world"?</br></br>  What is this character's appeal?  <br>There are lots of ways that your body can use that energy besides immediately storing it as fat.
