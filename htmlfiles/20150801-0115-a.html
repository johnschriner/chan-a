[ Dressrosa officially over<br><br>Now it's Zoo time</br></br>    <br> I'm older than Kidd </br>  <br> Apoo and Hawkins almost a decade older <br><br>I laughed</br></br></br>  <br> Dressrosa officially over <br>It's been a great ride guys. I'm going to miss Doflamingo and the family.</br></br>  <br> Zoo </br>  <br>Me too man, Kaidou looks like a tough motherfucker but I highly doubt he will reach Doflamingos level of complexity</br>  <br> Army of animals <br> not a zoo <br><br>I bet you still think Luffy is from Fuschia Village</br></br></br></br>  Remember when some retards thought Doffy was going to actually win?  <br>Yeah, from here on out I think it's going to be all about the powerhouses; Oda doesn't really need to develop any more villains to the extent of Doflamingo.</br>  I hope Hawkins gets some actual development besides padding out Kid's alliance<br><br>His scarecrow thing is cool and I want to know about the talking cat</br></br>  <br> Talking cat <br>Isn't that a man in a mask?</br></br>  <br>it could be. But I want to know more regardless</br>  <br><br>So Kidd is going to convince Kaidou to join his anti-Shanks alliance, right?</br></br>  <br>Remember when some retards thought Doflamingo could beat Kaido by trapping him in Bird Cage?</br>  <br>Zou means elephant you fucking dumbass</br>  I was reading the SBS from volume 76, and someone had asked what would the Straw Hats' jobs be if they weren't pirates. All of them made sense to me except for Brook, which Oda said would be a detective. Does anyone know why? Is it just because he's really really old?  <br>Why would a Yonkou join a supernova? It'd be the other way around if anything. I honestly think Kaido's just going to leave without a fuss anyway; he doesn't seem to fight every person he sees, as seen when he was talking in a friendly manner with Urogue.</br>  Why is no one excited for seeing Law's crew? They're on Zou, right? I figure the Penguin and Shachi fags would be all over that.  <br>so he can spy for naked women yohohoho</br>  <br>it's written in katakana you fucking rube</br>  <br>I could see Brook being a slapstick detective.</br>  <br>He's fairly inquisitive I suppose.</br>  <br>Kaido scared the homosexuals away for now.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Sanji still be a chef and Chopper still be a doctor?</br>  <br>He has the ability to fly around as a soul, he can shift through walls he's a great detective.</br>  <br>Reindeer can't be doctors.</br>  <br>I think that was a sport one now that I think of it.<br><br>He can also play dead if he's about to get caught</br></br></br>  Kaido is basically a weakling who only got where he his due to immortality. <br><br>Whitebeard probably fucked his ass multiple times back in the day.</br></br>  <br>That word is often written in katakana</br>  <br>  </br>    <br>He probably told Whitebeard that his little quakes tickled him.</br>  <br>so then its ambiguous then<br><br>Zoo makes more sense than Elephant</br></br></br>  What if  they don't even fight? Kaidou just apologizes and leaves.   <br>Sanji was a chef because Zeff is a chef<br><br>on his own, he'd be a Hair Stylist</br></br></br>  <br>What I'm hoping happens is that the Kid alliance get extremely intimidated by Kaidou's presence, with them starting to sweat from the fear and feeling Kaidou's ''aura'' or whatever. Then Kaidou notices them there, then walks away muttering to himself about not-dying things, and Kid collapses to the floor.  Then they decide to pussy out and not fight Shanks, since they witnessed a Yonkou up close. </br>  <br>That would be way too lame.</br>  <br> Kidd's legs spread open <br>And I thought Law was the slut here.</br></br>  <br>What were the rest?</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's Zou. Elephant. Zoo in katakana would be ズー, or zuu. It's a fucking name of an island. It's as relevant as "Cocoyasi Village", "Little Garden", "Jaya", and "Amazon Lily". Anon stop talking you're just embarassing yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Zoo in katakana would be ズー, or zuu. <br><br>nice source. Japs dont always follow english pronuciations exactly so you either back yourself up or take your rudimentary katakana knowledge back to class<br><br>Do you still call Oars, Odz?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so, rather they'll just be like "seems like we'll get two at once". I actually don't think they will fight, Kaidou will notice them ready to throw their best attacks and laugh, stating that small fry like them can never beat him. He leaves and the shit alliance is glad they didn't have to fight.</br>  <br>its gonna fucking hurt</br>  <br>I actually fully expect that what happens between Kidd &amp; Kaidou now to take place off screen</br>  Anyone else thinking that Kaidou ate a fruit that makes him Nurarihyon?  <br>Luffy - firefighter <br>Usopp - graphic designer<br>Robin - cabin attendant<br>Zoro - police officer<br>Sanji - beauty salon worker<br>Franky - pilot<br>Nami - childcare worker<br>Chopper - elementary school teacher</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's gonna be 2 on 1.<br><br>Appo is not gonna help but run away because almost every instance of Appo shows him running away in the manga.<br><br>Kidd will likely lose another arm.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>look up skullduggery pleasant, its this childrens book series about a talking skeleton detective. maybe hes referencing that</br>  <br> Odz <br><br>Christ, that was an annoying time</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Hawkin's ability a perfect counter to Kaidou?

Japs dont always follow english pronuciations exactly so you either back yourself up or take your rudimentary katakana knowledge back to class <br> Do you still call Oars, Odz? <br>You do know that "Odz" was the random guess of some translation group trying to figure out what his name was meant to be? If you actually hear it, it sounds just like the word "oars" with a Japanese accent. Zou sounds more like "zo" than "zoo".</br></br></br>  <br> Sanji - beauty salon worker <br>confirmed for closet homo</br></br>  <br>As long as Hawkins has enough disposable mooks.</br>  <br> Zou sounds more like "zo" than "zoo" <br><br>yes and Fuschia was accepted until Oda corrected to 'Windmill'<br><br>Name one reason why an island of animals would be called Elephant over Zoo?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Hawkin had a doll with Kaidous hair or some shit, maybe.<br><br>We don't know how his power works exactly, besides that his damage is inflicted to others via voodoo dolls.</br></br></br>  <br>Even though it's his design isn't hugely innovative or anything I gotta say he looks pretty fucking cool. <br><br>Looking forward to seeing what this big bastard can dish out.</br></br></br>  <br>this is Jap-made.<br><br>It doesnt have the same connotation there</br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking if he even has a fruit it's probably the Nemean Lion<br><br>King of the beasts with impenetrable skin would fit his theme.</br></br></br>  <br>what if I told you Kaido's skin color was purple?</br>  <br>Fuschia was a retarded decision anyway. "Fuusha" is Japanese for "windmill."</br>  <br>Full metal alch....I mean magneto.<br>Shit. He's gonna end up a quad or something, right? Controlling a mechanical robot body with his df.</br></br>  <br>yes exactly<br><br>Elephant over the obvious Zoo would be dumb considering what's on the island</br></br></br>  <br>My source is common sense. I don't need to provide a source of how a simple sounding word would be written in katakana; it's you who has to provice source on why it wouldn't spelled like that. "Japanese doesn't always follow english pronunciation" isn't fucking evidence of anything, especially for a word like zoo.<br><br>Oars is spelled as オーズ, or oars in english. Who translated that to Odz is as much as a dumbass as you.<br><br>How much a fucking dense dumbass can you be? Someone else already explained why it's elephant. Your argument is literally "Well I'm wrong but SOMETIMES a word isn't pronounced like it usually is"<br><br><br>Because it's a goddamn name of island and it does not mean anything whatsoever.<br><br>Damn I'm getting baited hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it. He gives a Rostam or Heracles vibe.</br>  <br> My source is common sense. I don't need to provide a source of <br><br>stopped reading there. Not interested in your opinion</br></br></br>  <br>I mainly think that he is Nurarihyon because of his alias hundred beasts Kaidou. The parade of hundred youkai is led by that guy and Kaidou seems to be linked to Wano.</br>  <br>I'd tell you I think it would look a little strange but I wouldn't be entirely against it or anything considering how used to Oda design fuckery I am at this point.</br>  <br>he still have to develop the villanest of them all, the world goverment.</br>  <br><br>Whitebeard should better be the one who left that scar on his side.</br></br>  <br>Stop it anon. Your stupidity is so dense that I'm getting embarrassed for you.</br>  <br>Anyone else thinking that Kaido has no fruit at all?</br>  <br>Spelling it as Zou or Zoh would probably avoid confusion with people pronouncing it as "Zuu"</br>  <br>Whitebeard would only tickle him.</br>  <br><br> Basil <br> dying </br></br></br>   yfw Law can kills him in a second by room-ing his heart out <br>I remember when Enel was supposedly invincible until Luffy shows up<br><br>Also in case of this guy being a fruit user, I wonder if the Marines have tried dipping him in water or slapping sea stone on him yet?<br><br>If not, can't they just like have Akainu hugs this guy or something in order to kill him,, you know, instead of using normal weapon like pistols and spears, or hanging</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Name one reason why an island of animals would be called Elephant over Zoo? <br>It might not even be either? One thing is for sure, getting "zoo" out of Zou is a much bigger leap than "fuschia" from Fuusha, which by your own admission was wrong.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps he's Typhon the father of monsters? The snake on his arm could be a clue?</br>  <br>No fruit would be more interesting for someone billed as the strongest living creature.</br>  <br>I'm hoping he has none!</br>  <br>I think it's a possibility but his animal theme is too tempting to not speculate.</br>  <br>He was caught by Marines numerous times it said and he has been carried away on 9 prison ships, only to sink them. I honestly cannot see him having a fruit, both in regards to seastone zapping his power as well as sinking ships and being fine. He could also kill himself effortlessly if he had a fruit.</br>  <br>I dont think Oda cares about that. May even have done it on purpose since he's weird with English sometimes</br>  <br>Fighters without a fruit tend to be boring.</br>  <br>Not ones who can jump 10,000 metres and hit the ground only to brush it off. Do you also find Zoro and Sanji boring? A fruitless Yonkou wouldn't even be farfetched, since Shanks (likely) doesn't.</br>  <br><br>Why does he not just drown himself?</br></br>  <br> One thing is for sure, getting "zoo" out of Zou is a much bigger leap than "fuschia" from Fuusha <br><br>no it isnt. both are only slight alterations of the other word<br><br>And it COULD be something else but of what we know. Zoo sounds correct AND makes more sense that elephant</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he ate a fruit once in an effort to kill himself. I can see Oda playing that for a gag. His fruit could be something like a Mayfly Zoan.</br>  <br>Yes I find Sanji and Zoro boring. Most strawhats are boring even the ones with fruits.</br>  <br>Go read bleach</br>  <br> no it isnt. both are only slight alterations of the other word <br>Either way, both are wrong.<br> Zoo sounds correct <br>No, it doesn't. I have never heard someone try to say "zoo" in a japanese accent only for it to come out sound like they are trying to "zoh" or "zaw".</br></br></br></br>    <br>sounds correct as in 'Island of Zoans=Zoo'</br>  <br>God I love Brook. Digging the return of the tophat</br>  <br> Law can kills him in a second by room-ing his heart out <br>hello speedreader-kun, you certainly must have missed the part where Law had to get close to Smoker to use the attack to remove his heart. He just can't "room" everything he wants. Pay more attention next time.</br></br>  <br> a few decades ago I wou grown a new bone! Yohohoho </br>  <br> kidd didn't even earn a nickname <br>That's pretty fucking lame</br></br>  <br>what an ugly "orange", this is not how it should look like</br>  <br> dat bellybutton <br> dem vagina bones <br> dem thighs <br>MUH DICK</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, not to be picky, but make-up artists and beauticians are often stereotyped as either gay or okama over here in Japan too.</br>  <br> that miniskirt </br>  <br>Why is she so perfect?</br>  rereading older stuff and this pic got me so hype for the whole crew being back together again. <br> such bro-ship  <br> muh captain oh captain </br></br>  Does someone have the Kaido/Coldsteel thing?  <br>The archive does.</br>  <br>It's funny how Moriah was going to use a continent-puller giant to fight Kaido again. He seems to be a hybrid of one based on his appearance.</br>  <br> wanting this shitty, unfitting and unfunny meme picture </br>  So how will Luffy and company get to Zou? Especially without Nami. Even with the Vivrecard, the New World weather is crazy.<br><br>I'm betting Viola is gonna join the crew and lead them there.</br></br>  <br>Law will get them there.</br>  I made this OC a couple of threads ago. Could someone please clear up the head area? I only have MSpaint.  <br>There are probably a ton of people on Dressrosa right now that wouldn't mind giving them a ride. I think they're alright for now.</br>  <br>Ok no. Amazon Lily is clearly relevant. Dunno about the others, I can't really remember those arcs too well. But AMAZON Lily. Its a jungle based land with a tribe of FEMALE ONLY warriors. Come on.</br>      <br>Shanks looks like he got hung with an invisible rope</br>      <br>See </br>  <br>it was called little garden because it seemed little for the giants</br>  <br> Robin: Cabin Attendant <br> Franky: Pilot <br>Yet more fuel for the good ship Frobin.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope next arc won't suck just like everything that came post timeskip.</br>    <br>Jaya's name could be referencing an actual island in Indonsia, Papua (It was initially named Irian Jaya before changing to Papua). The Island was in the shape of a bird's head, kinda similar to how Jaya was to a skull. Not to mention the south birds were prevalent creatures in the the Jaya/Sypiea arc.</br>      My theory: Kaido ate hundreds of zoan devil fruits to kill himself but failed.<br><br>Now he can use a lot of them and of course awaken some though not lose control unlike impel down's guards.</br></br>  <br>You obviously have shit taste then because every arc has been good and post timeskip has been fantastic<br><br>The only improvements I would like are using multiple figures in the same panel to show new moves off properly, even if there are lots of events to show. As in if Zoro was performing a move, it would show the start, the swipe, and the finish in the same panel so they can illustrate them as well as in previous, simpler arcs</br></br></br>  <br>dont reply to bait</br>  <br>I wonder how Kaidou was on a sky island.</br>  <br>c'mon anon.</br>  So with a quirk like this, there is only two things I could see Oda do with him. Kaido will either:<br><br>-be beaten so close to his death that he actually starts to fear the possibility of dying<br>-or he'll just be killed</br></br></br>  <br>this is the best one.</br>  <br> not shutting down even baitposters <br>Get good</br></br>   hawkins does a tarot reading <br> kidd asks what their survival rating is <br> hawkins just says nothing and starts trembling </br></br>  <br>He jumped</br>  <br>he would die if he fell into water.<br>so according to your theory he's not serious with killing himself</br></br>  <br>-or almost gets beaten to death by Luffy, but still retains his quirk, so he follows Luffy around protecting him thinking one day this kid will become strong enough to kill me.</br>  <br>Moria might have had the right idea there, fight fire with fire and so on.</br>  <br>Of course you cannot eat more than 1 fruit if you aren't immortal or extremely lucky maybe</br>  What if he is so ridiculously strong that he can't drown?  <br>Cabin attendant? What?</br>  <br>that's assuming he has a devil fruit. and assuming his species or whatever he is can't just breathe underwater</br>  <br> Niggastream version. </br>  I'm still in disbelief at this guy's introduction i was expecting him to be shown the way Whitebeard and Big Mom were.  <br>Marinefordbaby: The post</br>  <br>lame? Of all the many captains on the sea. He is THE captain.</br>  <br>The crew is a bunch of /pol/ nuts, but their JR is pretty cool.</br>  <br>Does Kaido have two peglegs or is it just me?</br>  <br>What's that supposed to mean? Whitebeard was introduced attached to some medical equipment and drinking sake by the barrel, Big Mom was introduced eating her own mooks.</br>  <br>We still haven't formally introduced with Big Mom.</br>  <br>I mean him just just chilling with his crew getting news of Doffy's failure and getting pissed.</br>  <br>So Kaidou is GyuuMaou. Yeah, a magical Monkey will defeat him for sure.</br>   the strongest supernova doesn't even fear Kaidou <br>When will Urouge oneshot anyone important?</br>  <br>When Sentoumaru tries to arrest him.</br>  <br> Kaido tries to make Luffy marry his daughter </br>  <br>Time to share it.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Nami isn't the only capable navigator in the World, you know. If fucking Lola could travel backwards from the New World, I'm sure someone can help Luffy out.</br>  <br>flight attendent</br>  <br> 9 hours ago <br> not 2 years ago </br></br>  <br>It's still weird.</br>  <br>That one reminds me a bit of Roshio's<br> RIP </br></br>  <br>It could be an old picture</br>  <br>Now I remember how excited I was when we first got to Mock Town and actual pirate shit happened.</br>  <br> le everything sucks post timeskip maymay </br>  <br>Yeah, it was a pretty nice thing to come into. Also Blackbeard</br>  <br>i want mad hyena bellamy but on luffys side<br><br>not this pussy shit where all he does is suck doffys feathery pink dick</br></br></br>  So, after Fujitora presented everything to the whole world, the wg is bound to give them new bounties right? <br><br>Can we look forward to bounties for God Usopp and his crew then?</br></br>  <br>Man, Pizarro looks like Oars/Oars Jr./Kaido</br>  <br>Yes and yes. This is another obvious parallel to Alabasta. After the Straw hats get a new bounty we probably see quite a few people being fed up/surprised about it.</br>  <br>This has been pointed out before. But does it mean anything?</br>  I think Kaido will be an ally. Almost every single major villain Luffy has fought has been rather 'quirk'less. Kuro, Krieg, Arlong, Crocodile, Bellamy, Enel, Lucci, Moria, Hody and Doffy. The people with quirks end up being allies, like Buggy.<br><br>So Kaido is probably going to be a sort of rival for Luffy. His tattoo and and design could reflect Gear 4. He probably would lose to the alliance to advance the plot but he'd stick around as an ally.<br><br>This is completely baseless speculation, of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is completely baseless speculation, of course. <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br>I won't <br>it was a good arc but it had a few flaws, one being too long</br></br>  <br> Kuro <br> Crocodile <br> Bellamy <br> Moria <br> Doffy <br><br>In what world are these characters quirkless? How did you finish typing Doffy's name without realizing how dumb you were being?<br><br>not understanding characters is one thing.. but DOFFY? come the fuck on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't see it. If Kaido actually wants to die, he isn't going to team up with someone that can't kill him, or can't offer a solution to the not dying problem<br><br>Also I was thinking, if Whitebeard presumably can't kill him, Kaido's war is also kind of pointless because surely there isn't going to be anyone in the world that can actually kill him anyway since Whitebeard was fighting exceptionally powerful opponents while sick and dying.<br><br>The only way I'm thinking this might end is if Blackbeard decides to appear and actually kills Kaido after a bunch of people have been fighting him, setting BB up nicely to be an extreme arse-raper and worthy of final boss status</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are read the whole post</br>  <br>how was Doflamingo complex exactly?<br>fallen noble who wants to fuck the world up because muh childhood trauma<br><br><br>they must be thinking he's not actually caught by the marines and it's all part of his plan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's doing that thing called "joking" ever heard of it?</br>  I believe Kaido will just ignore Kidd and his gang deeming them as useless piece of shits who won't even be able to touch him.  <br>I just hope so. It's what I'm looking forward the most for the last half year.<br><br>Too bad Sanji won't get a decent bounty again. Probably to make him do more spy work later.</br></br></br>  <br> as seen when he was talking in a friendly manner with Urogue. <br>we didn't see them talking<br>for what we know Kaidou may have been completely ignoring them</br></br></br>  <br> stopped reading at the end of the post <br><br>Man you're some motherfucking though guy.</br></br></br>  <br>great more fanart for everyone...</br>  <br>Kuro's quirk is him fixing his glasses ?<br>Crocodile's is what ? Bellamy, what ? Moria is lazy, sure but not really a quirk. Doffy's quirk is his nickname ? <br><br>What I mean by 'quirk' is stuff like Buggy being pissed about his nose or Magellan's diahrea or Hannybal's Warden ambition. Funny stuff like that. <br><br><br>You really think Kaido will die ? Come on bro, even Doffy lived through it. And I don't really mean Kaido will be on Luffy's side, he just won't be against him, if that makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kaido has actually eaten 100 zoans <br> constantly switches animals mid-combo <br> like grabbing someone as a snake, flying upwards as an eagle, then falling down on them as a whale <br>  Luffy gear 5s him down to a draw eventually with a lot of help after a ten chapter fight <br> Kaido seems down for the count <br> suddenly grabs into a barrel next to him <br> pulls out a fistful of rumble balls <br> eats them all at once <br> no chapter next week <br>Post yfw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no prove for this, but to me it seemed like he didn't noticed them. That's quite a big difference to ignoring someone. Maybe he is actually bling as people suggested or he has no CoO. I would also guess that he can't hear. but that is impossible as his subordinates called for him.</br>  <br>Sanji was already working in a kitchen before meeting Zeff you dingus</br>  <br>Don't read weekly if you can't handle it.</br>  <br> next chapter he explodes and dies <br>GODA<br>O<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kidd will likely lose another arm. <br>he doesn't need them anyway</br></br>  <br> fallen noble who wants to fuck the world up because muh childhood trauma <br>typical summary by a childish, superficial thinking mind</br></br>  <br>doesnt mean he would have stayed there<br><br>without Zeff saving his life, maybe Sanji would realize his true calling instead of achieving someone else's dream out of some misguided sense of obligation</br></br></br>  <br> Any damage is inflicted on the person the Doll corresponds to <br>where do you get that? all we know is that Hawkin can transfer his own damage to one of his dolls<br>nothing more<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  Is it me or is Luffy really handsome?    <br> Name one reason why an island of animals would be called Elephant over Zoo? <br><br>because we don't know anything about this island? why would an island be called after kaidou's men? the name of an island is probably older than that</br></br></br>  <br>Kaido won't die if it's Luffy fighting him, but Luffy fighting him and being victorious would be a total asspull even at this point. The Doffy win was only satisfying because Law severely weakened him so Luffy wouldn't get decked</br>  Post YFW Doflamingo comes in to save the day with his Heaven String:16 Heavenly Arrows and defeats Kaido  I think Oda should have made Kaido's head bigger, it's starting to irk me.  <br>Are you talking about urouge?</br>  <br>Just you bud.</br>  <br>I agree and that's why I'm leaning towards the "not an enemy" route. Then again, I can see Luffy beating him if the Kid alliances joins him. 7 supernova's is nothing to laugh at. Still, Kaido won't die, of course. Just beaten.</br>  <br>it could have been cool if the enemies weren't so much forgettable<br>FI worst arc</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, fag! We've had such a nice time since the Kaidou reveal.</br>  <br>He's like Zodd. All the nutrients go to the horns.</br>  <br>I don't know what the problem with FI is, it was clear from the start the the villains won't be much of a challenge and it made complete sense. Instead Oda focused on making it a theme heave arc and in my humble opinion he succeeded with it.</br>  <br>Judging by the things in impel down, I imagine monster chopper is basically Toni's awakened zoan form, so a rumble ball is basically an awakening kickstarter for zoans.<br><br>Three questions remain:<br>if Kaido ate 100 zoans, did he awaken them? If yes, all of them at once? Only a few? As in his selected few "main" fruits?<br><br>Is there another Zoan user with multiple "points"? We only ever saw human, animal or half-half.<br><br>When was the last t time someone called Chopper Toni?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mistaken journey to west with dbz</br>  <br><br>This guy is going to cause the death of thousands of people, it's not something Luffy will forgive and become bros after exchanging some blows like with Z, the island under his control must be hell too.</br></br>  <br><br> implying the trio won't explain they want to take down Big Mom <br> implying he won't have them join his side in the upcoming war <br> 2011 + 14 <br><br>ISHYGDDT<br>S<br>H<br>Y<br>G<br>D<br>D<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> luffy has a talking reindeer <br> law has a talking polar bear <br> hawkins has a talking cat <br>What does it mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuro is super intelligent man wasting his talent doing convoluted, goofy shit<br><br>Crocodile is smug overly aggressive wildcard<br><br>Bellamy, when he isn't being beaten and crying, is Bartolomeo's schtick.

Fucks with marines in their own base only to stand down because his favorite old woman told him to. Killed his immediate family then spends the rest of his life taking in strays. Cant make up his mind between killing Law and saving Law even after shooting the bastard multiple times.<br><br>No one IN this series is more quirky than Doffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mistaking DBZ for Saiyuki </br>  I fell out of reading One Piece around about the Gladiator arena storyline, about 12/18 months ago because it got kinda played out. I know that Sabo came back, but I didnt get that far.<br><br>Has OP been worth reading in that time I was away from it? I see a lot of threads about it, but I'm not sure if it's worth getting back into or not. To clarify, I was a huge OP fan, but it got kinda slow after Marineford, at least for me</br></br>  <br> Has OP been worth reading in that time I was away from it? I see a lot of threads about it, but I'm not sure if it's worth getting back into or not. <br>No, it's not worth it, now fuck off.</br></br>  <br>god that gif makes me so hard. i just want to make out with luffy, and then suck his young thick, uncut 6 inch cock and his hairless, firm balls, all the while i get fucked by zoro's massive, 9 inch, uncut, veiny cock with his low hanging balls from behind, getting sandwich inbewteen luffy's fit, toned muscles and zoro's rock hard, bulging abs, chest and biceps</br>  <br>How the fuck are we supposed to know your taste to be able to answer that question?</br>  <br>it's the longest arc of one piece<br>calling it too long should be in no way surprising<br>and I've been reading it weekly for a very long time now<br><br><br>the enemies aren't the only problem<br>I hated the island design<br>absolutely no interesting character there<br>I AM EVIL BECAUSE I AM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True, I don't think they'll really be friends. Kaido is just gonna be that guy who keeps coming back again and again, I think. <br><br><br>None of those are things that I would consider to be "quirks", unfortunately. I get what you're trying to say but most of it is just their straight personality. Like, no one bats an eye about Moria's existence or Doffy's fashion sense. It's all fairly normal for people to have wild and crazy designs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> cringe: the post <br>This is like those lame ass comments people leave on porn videos.</br></br>  <br>He was not "evil just because". Hodi was evil due to culturally perpetuated hatred.<br><br> He was basically mad at memes. </br></br></br>  <br>I thought Madame Shirley was incredibly interesting to my crotch.</br>  <br>Read it yourself you lazy faggot and form your own opinion, you even have the chance to read the rest of the arc without any weekly breaks.</br>  <br> I AM EVIL BECAUSE I AM <br>that was all part of the arcs theme</br></br>  <br>There always has to be the longest arc of any series. Why not make it one where it is full of events and characters which are highly important to the whole world of One Piece?<br><br>I notice you also dislike FMI. I'm not going to call you one, but you sound a lot like a Marineford Baby.</br></br></br>  <br> absolutely no interesting character there <br>Shirahoshi is very interesting<br>and I mean that in the visual appealing way and the being an ancient weapon and stuff way</br></br></br>  Dragon will come to Zoo.

I don't know why people kept expecting a fight. It probably wasn't anything more than Sanji kicking a few cannon balls before they used a coup de burst to get away.</br>  <br>do you suppose he banged Iva? I think he'd do it if asked</br>  <br> Shirahoshi's very bland almost as bas as Rebecca <br>not even remotely close</br></br>  <br>Sanji won against the entire crew of that big mom ship, m8<br><br> :^) </br></br></br>  <br>You're complaining about the length, but for the shear amount of content within it was reasonable. I loved Skypiea but just to compare it, it had less content per the length of it. How did you feel reading Skypiea weekly since you claim to have read since Jaya?<br><br>Don't bother bringing up underagers, because most of them have the same outlook as you do.</br></br></br>  <br>at least Shirahoshi did something and even rescued everyones asses at the end of the arc and she at least will play a huge role later in the story due to being an ancient weapong that will also get trained by someone on top of it. I am already looking forwad to seeing here again and who exactly trained her. She is a character with still a lot of potential, Rebecca has nothing of that sort to offer.</br>  <br> that shit shit mushi <br>hah! neger!</br></br>  <br> Shirley's the only redeemable part of this arc <br><br>Den-chan was a cutie</br></br></br>  <br>2nd den den mushi from the left<br> Hey, who let that nigger in here?" </br></br>  <br>Relevant</br>  <br>ah I mean from the right</br>  <br>how lewd</br>  <br> Coating Franky's brother </br>  <br> Kaido has Kaiju devil fruit <br> We find out more about awakened zoans <br> King Kong vs Godzilla end-of-arc fight <br><br> yfw </br></br></br></br></br>   army of zoans arc <br> zou <br> zoo <br> mindblown </br></br></br>  <br> glasses fuck up Iceburg's beard at the end of the gif <br><br>I was going to post something witty but this gif is triggering me hard</br></br></br>  <br> Dressrosa officially over <br><br><br>So after Dressrosa is over, can we agree, that story was rewritten during the arc?<br> Trebol was shown as a good sniper, so an (second) Usopp vs Trebol fight was erased <br> Leo, Nui Nui user was introduced and his power remained nearly unused. I think he was supposed to be the opponent of the Ito Ito somehow. <br> Executives' fights were speed up and mostly shit <br><br>And so on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can just imagine Robin walking down the aisle offering the passengers coffee while making morbid jokes like ''I sure hope there are no terrorists on this plane'' or ''Hopefully the engines don't fail or we'd all be dead''.</br>  <br>ah it's headcanon-kun again<br>go away please</br></br>  <br> can we agree <br>No, fuck off.</br></br>  <br> I AM EVIL BECAUSE I AM <br>That's how racism works. There is no constant reasons behind it.<br>And that whole arc was about how racism work and why is it stupid.</br></br></br>  <br> I think he was supposed to be the opponent of the Ito Ito somehow. <br>If you really think that, then you are a fucking retard.</br></br>  this chapter confused me, I though the last think we saw was a ship stand-off between strawhats and big mama's ship, what happened after that that led here?  <br>Capone saved them</br>  <br>animefag here, finally caught up a few days ago<br>I knew hody was fodder before he even crawled out of the woodwork<br>are you thick?</br></br></br>  <br> Trebol was shown as a good sniper, so an (second) Usopp vs Trebol fight was erased <br>And Gladius was shown to be the best sniper in the family, but it doesn't mean Usopp had to face him.<br> &gt;Leo, Nui Nui user was introduced and his power remained nearly unused. I think he was supposed to be the opponent of the Ito Ito somehow. <br>He stitched Law's arm together, used his power to restrain Robin when they captured her, defeated Jora and sewed up all the executives and probably a few more things. He got enough use.<br> Executives' fights were speed up and mostly shit <br>They were fine; I enjoyed them all. You can't have long fights when there's so many to get through, otherwise the arc would take another 6 months.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>obin is the worst strawhat ?<br> slut <br> irrevelant <br> never speaking <br> suck at fighting <br> awful outfit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  If kaido doesn't have the invulnerability fruit, or some kind of mythical zoan that grants immortality, oda has to explain why he can passively and unwillingly destroy any killing method used to execute him (guillotine etc).  <br>Ceasar said they escaped from big mom and then got in new trouble right away. Oda did not show us how they met this girl they were talking about and how they ran into Kaidous men.</br>  <br> mfw when dragon is not luffys dad but his mom  <br>  you heard it here first </br></br>  <br>He's so powerful that things just break.</br>  <br>Oh hai Robin-hate fag. I take that as an invitation to post Robin</br>  <br>alright, thanks!</br>  <br> the local plot decrypter is irrelevant <br>the rest of those are good things<br>if those hands won serious battles i'd question oda</br></br></br>    <br>Go back to pre-school you fucking murrifat.</br>    <br> and someone had asked what would the Straw Hats' jobs be if they weren't pirates. All of them made sense to me except for Brook, which Oda said would be a detective <br>Nigger Oda didn't declare their jobs. Another fan had already sent him a postcard saying what their jobs might be and Oda said "sure why not."<br><br> O: Ok. So about this, I actually ended up finding the answer on a postcard from another fan. <br><br>That's how all character birthdays are decided.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Strawhat banter is best banter  <br>so... he declared them?<br>are you high?</br></br>  <br>I think Jaya/Skypiea's the best arc of One Piece since it's the embodiment of what the manga is supposed to be about<br>fun adventures and romance<br><br><br>I agree<br><br><br> That's how racism works. There is no constant reasons behind it. <br>lel<br>people actually believe that<br><br><br>understanding that he'll be fodder since the beginning doesnt make him any less bad<br>since we had to put up with this shit for a long time<br>also<br> animefag <br><br><br>I won't be baited that easily /a/non-chan<br><br><br>his body is that strong<br><br><br>nor whose the people they're trying to save</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was really hoping he would be the one to suicide</br>  <br>Godd thing Nami changed her mind about not wearing a miniskirt</br>  <br>it means you're not supposed to get invested in shit tier fights, you're supposed to get invested in what made him so fucked<br>"nothing at all" was a top tier scene</br></br>  <br>I love how everyone excepts no less from each other. Sanji just kicks a fucking behemoth out of the way and their all just dicking around.</br>  <br> otherwise the arc would take another 6 months <br>don't see the problem</br></br>  <br> excepts <br>accepts. I think.</br></br>  <br>the problem is that oda is not actually immortal and actively limits himself</br>  <br>Maybe he is. Think about it, Kaido is an anagram for Oda Ki. Kaido has the ki of oda, which makes him immortal. Oda can draw this out as long as he wants.</br>  <br>Who will replace Oda when he dies, anyway? I doubt he'll last until the end when he's so absolutely nonchalant about his health.</br>  <br> oda will die when the manga ends <br> we will never get those supernova grand line first half spinoffs <br>why live</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Kubo<br> the ride never ends </br></br>  <br>He'll pull a GRRM and not let anybody finish it.</br>  <br><br><br>Same tbh</br></br></br>  <br>His assistants of course. His editor already knows everything about one piece until the very end (including teh major plot tweest), it wouldn't be too hard to end it after odacchi dies.</br>  <br><br>Assisants/editor - they already know the ending.</br></br>  <br>Oda will only die when we forget him anon, don't you remember Dr Hiluluk's words?</br>  Monet is Cute!

Welp, Sanjis time to shine!</br>  <br> we will never get those supernova grand line first half spinoffs <br>WUT</br></br>  Is Kaidou a descendant of Oars ?<br>Can we assume he's DF-less since if he was he could simply kill himself by jumping into the water ? Why doesn't he eat one for that reason ?<br><br>Will Luffy's gear 5 involve giving the properties of his fruit to a seastone staff ? (Sun Wukong)</br></br></br>  <br> replying to fujoshi scum <br>How new?</br></br>  <br> strongest <br>Kaido<br> Weakest <br>Big Mom</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hilarious and original shishishi</br>  <br>she swallowed a lot of nutrients</br>  <br>Kaido &gt; G4 Luffy, therefore 795 &gt; 784</br>  <br>Oda really has good tastes, I just wish he wouldn't go too far with the boobs</br>  <br>Also how long is one gomu gomu?</br>  <br>here's a cleaned one</br>  <br>He's a hybrid human/continent-puller giant. I wouldn't be surprised if he's semi-related to Oars Jr</br>  <br>debatable</br>  <br> Out of all pirate crews his is the least creative </br>  <br>I don't know. G4 King Kong punch seems like something that'd tickle Kaido. What he just brushed off without even a scratch was more deadly than King Kong punch.</br>  <br> Kid is born in the same year as me <br>Mah nigga</br></br>  <br>she's a good girl</br>  <br>probably all really close to each other, in the end Blackbeard will be the strongest</br>    <br>I'd say Shanks is currently the "official" strongest among Emperors, although the general population might think Kaidou is, but Blackbeard already surpassed him and will soon prove it.<br>I know I'll cry like a little bitch.</br></br>  <br>aren't we comparing hype levels?</br>  Kaidou's reveal did not disappoint. Now hopefully Big Mom won't either when we'll get our first clear view of her  Why is Urouge considered so strong? His power doesn't seem that great, and he got beat up like the other Supernovas just as easily.  <br>he's not. Do you really believe people claiming Urouge will become a Yonkou and such are actually serious?</br>  <br> he got beat up like the other Supernovas just as easily <br><br>implying current big ones weren't defeated sometime during they journey when they were young beginners</br></br></br>  <br>I guess; Kaido's been awaited for like a decade now though. A lot of the negative faggots ruined things when G4 came out because they didn't get their "ebin cool protag" design, while the rest of us enjoyed it. I personally read both chapters without reading spoilers first (great decision) and the Kaido one got my blood pumping more than G4 did.</br>  <br><br>Are you gus retarded? Urouge is obviously the strongest of the supernova. Oda gave him the lowest bounty to show how he differs from Kidd the guy who had the highest. Kidd was a mass murderer will Urouge helped the people and fought his own fights. It's like Urouge is almost a nicer guy than luffy.</br></br>  <br>I know anon, but they just won't understand. Better keep it simple. One day they'll know.</br>  <br>Because he talked like old pals to the strongest and most fearsome living being and tried to talk him out of killing himself. He had no fear of him whatsoever.</br>  <br>I wonder how his face fits to his former silhouette.<br>Only Big Mom was the one whose design was changed and got rounder. But it's happened maybe during TS.</br></br>  <br>Getting beat up is what makes Urogue stronger. It's literally his DF.</br>  <br> my semi-OC's get reposted <br>wow</br></br>  <br>He didn't know it's Kaido.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh fuck. I don't know what to believe any longer. This is some super saiyan shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How upset do you think the general's gonna be when it turns out Monet is alive?</br>  <br>I think Kaidou's appereance alone is threatening enough or do you suggest that the Kidd alliance knows Kaidou and only Urouge doesn't? Which would be quite retarded.</br>  <br>nope, because he doesn't remain strong. He only releases the power he tanked before. And I bet it has a time limit too.</br>  <br>Maybe he did, maybe he just doesn't fear him.</br>  <br>She is literally the most relevant Straw Hat aside from Luffy due to her ability to translate poneglyphs. <br><br>Also Franky is more relevant than everyone but Luffy and Robin due to his knowledge of Pluton. <br><br>Literally every other Straw Hat is expendable. <br><br>Deal w/ it Zorofag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How upset do you think the general's gonna be when it turns out Monet joins the Strawhats?</br>  <br>Well that sucks. I'm sure he could learn to harvest it though, no? Reminds me a bit of that X-men villain, who is incredibly powerful.</br>  <br> He only releases the power he tanked before. And I bet it has a time limit too. <br>Doesn't changes the fact that the fights are still making his original body better. He will naturally become stronger and tank more. It's the logical conclusion.</br></br>  <br>Why would be retarded? Luffy barely knows something about the big names. <br><br>inb4 timeskip</br></br></br>  <br><br>According to Oni mythology monks don't fear Onis, and it's likely Kaido has the oni oni no mi</br></br>  <br>because luffy is an ignorant brat maybe?</br>  <br>What if Urouge is ignorant too?</br>  <br>So you're suggesting that Urouge did not know kaidou and didn't fear him because of that, but the Kidd alliance knows who Kaidou is and only fears him because of that name? I don't think so m8.<br><br><br> likely Kaido has the oni oni no mi <br>No it's not Kaidou only looks like oars or do you think every oars has a oni related fruit? That's literally wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>   Kidd actually beats Kaido <br> this thread when </br>  <br>Does this angel look ignorant?</br>  <br> No it's not Kaidou only looks like oars or do you think every oars has a oni related fruit? That's literally wrong. <br>What if those types of giants are Oda's species/interpretations of Onis. It does't have to be fruit related, especially since it seems like Kaido might not have a fruit.</br></br>  Guys, shut the fuck up, Kaidou had no reason to fuck Urouge up, they just met on a sky island while Kaidou was gonna try to suicide.  <br> onis are immortal <br> are made up of multiple beasts <br> he even has the oni clothes, anklets, chains and horns <br> monkey statues (aka Luffy) guard against Oni </br></br></br></br>  He can't have the oni fruit and the luck fruit at the same time unless Oda went full hack and decided double DF is just a thing now.  <br>Not really. There's more than enough evidence that could point to her not being dead, like the icepick not being in her heart anymore despite Ceasar stabbing right through the ground, and it's still standing upright (meaning he'd have to have dislodge the pick, take off the heart, then stab the pick in the ground again because reasons, and pass out).<br><br>THIS is what would piss off /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>well that's possible why not<br><br><br>And literally nothing suggests that he has a oni FRUIT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have the Luck Luck fruit you tard</br>  <br> Kaido ate the oni fruit so exploding doesn't do anything since he's so durable <br> Luffy eats a second fruit and doesn't die because he's made of rubber </br></br>  <br> &gt;he even has the oni clothes, anklets, chains and horns <br><br>what? he's dressed like a Sumo, m8</br></br></br>  <br> he didn't read the real translation </br>  <br>Since Kaidou is silhouetted and at a semi-far distance away from Urouge in the panel I assumed that he thought it was just some guy. His crew doesn't identify him as Kaidou either. The Alliance saw him up close and could identify him<br><br>Also do people think it's pronounced Sheeps-head or Sheep-shead?</br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind forgot that Urouge fought him, my bad</br>  <br> Since Kaidou is silhouetted and at a semi-far distance away from Urouge in the panel I assumed that he thought it was just some guy. <br>I think kaidou appearence is unique enough that you would probably guess who or rather what the fuck the guy in front of you is. Even if the guy was a bit away, Urouge talked to him, so he clearly wasn't too far from the high priest.</br></br>  <br>100% made for sex</br>  Kaido has the cockroach fruit.<br>He can survive anything. Even nuclear explosions.</br>  Will Oda ever stop samefacing/samebodying women?  <br>Does not explain the luck aspect</br>  <br>Will you ever stop being a faggot?</br>  <br>Will you ever stop sucking dick?</br>  <br>nope, you get a Wasp or a Blob</br>  <br>I don't know man he might- candy</br>  So Sanji beat Big Mom's crew? So he's Marco/Jozu level?  <br><br>Or they ran away.</br></br>  <br>Siapa?</br>  I just now realized that this was Kaidou's shadow being projected from the sky island. A throwback to what happened in the beginning of the Skypea Arc.  <br>That's not how shadows fucking work. Goddamn it Oda.</br>  <br><br>It's sad to what extent you will go to do damage control. Just admit that you were wrong, and move on.</br></br>  Anyone else notice how Kaidou has the same horns as Oars Jr.?<br><br>Maybe he's part whatever breed of Giants Oars is, or maybe they're just horns because horns are cool. Or it could be part of his DF.</br></br>  Where do people get the idea that he has a luck power? Sounds more like he is just incredibly tough. Was it just a bad initial translation?  <br> Anyone else notice how Kaidou has the same horns as Oars Jr.? <br>No you're literally the first one detective</br></br>  <br>What is he doing damage control for?</br>  <br><br>Having the dumb idea that that's his silhouette/shadow, and not a building.</br></br>  Shut up Kaidou, we just started the second part of grand line. We don't need another war already.  <br>I was only asking, sperg-king. I hadn't seen anyone else bring it up. <br><br>What do you reckon though?</br></br></br>  Can't Kaidou just let Akainu fist his asshole for a whole day? That should help both of them.  <br>fuck off back to reddit or whatever board you came from you shit stain</br>  <br><br> Akainu tries this <br> rips his arm off </br></br></br>  <br>Never even been to reddit fam. This shit stain is home grown 4chan! Why do you hate yourself so much?</br>  <br> This shit stain is home grown 4chan! <br>Fucking mememaster, if you look down on 5chinks then why are you even here?</br></br>  <br>How fucking fast are you faggots drawing?</br>  <br> looking down on <br>How was I? Project much?<br><br>Why are you so salty? I just wanted to talk about Kaidou's horns for fuck sake.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How about you just stop reading something you don't renjoy? Oh right, your life is that shit and you actually enjoy it but are too depressive to acknowledge it.</br>  <br>They have suspiciously similar Jolly Rogers too (Assuming the guys going after the Curly Hats are Kaido's men)</br>  <br> How was I? Project much? <br>commit kaidou</br></br>  <br>Do you think he didn't in one of the several times he got captured? Whatever is the way they'll kill him it will be very stupid regardless since Oda set the bar way too high.</br>  <br>Shit dude, I hadn't looked at the Jolly Rogers. They do look pretty similar. I hope we get more about the different kinds of giants from Kaidou, we need to good giant arc.

Zesshi could beat an unarmed Shalltear when she has full equipment on<br>2. PDL was compared in strength to Demiurge by Evileye<br><br>We don't even know if Kid Captain or Evileye is a reliable scouter anyways.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Other than World class items or possibility of other players?<br><br>Not really</br></br></br>  <br><br>Platinum the scheming dragon.</br></br>  <br>Do other players show up?<br><br><br>Who?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shalltear <br> Not winning the Ainzbowl </br></br>   start listening to drama CD <br> the first conversation is Albedo offering herself <br><br>Oh yes, I like this already.</br></br></br>    <br> who? <br> ____Read the novels______ </br></br>  <br>Look at her face, dont recognize her?<br><br>Also, read the LN if you can.<br><br>Other players existed in different times before Ainz appearance</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, damn.</br>  <br>It's just a chair.</br>  <br> Who? <br>Ainz vs another undead lich.  Ainz isn't the skeleton in that picture. </br></br>  <br>Yeah, but didn't she get promised to Entoma?</br>  <br>But anon, what good is a retard meido if I can't bully her?</br>  <br> Promised  <br>Evileye is too unique to become  a snack. </br></br>  <br>She's also good for other things anon. For example,  petting and hugging </br>   Bestest meido isn't in 1st place <br>Fix this.</br>   adventure of Climb <br><br>Holy shitto literally who-gives-a-shit tier bitchboy</br></br>  <br> Two magazines inside the gun </br>  <br>But it only lets me vote once.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but could be anything between strong enough to provide some amusement/chance for the guardians to show of for "Ainz-sama" to strong enough to actually have to take seriously. I'll be disappointed if they are both on a similar level to the tree from the drama cd.</br></br>  <br>Sauce anon?</br>  It's times like these I wish I could into moon. I would very much like to read physical copies of the LNs.  <br> fix this <br>"uwahhh" some more robotfag</br></br>  Saw some anon(s) actually have physical copies of the light novel. Where the heck do you buy it from? I can't find it.  <br>amazon.jp<br>amazon.kr<br>or<br>amazon.cn</br></br></br></br>  So about that girl from Black Scripture that's supposedly super strong?<br><br>Is the author hinting that she's going to get defeated by someone from Nazarick (or Momon) and then attempt to marry them?</br></br>  <br>Yes, Shizu does</br>  <br>Either Korean or Chinese anons. I guess</br>  <br>I don't think she can actually pose a threat head on, just like PDL. But given the opportunities the threat of assassination is there and it's not like she's alone.<br><br>For example Razor's Edge seems to be hot shit given it can smash against a Dark Young and still take no damage, and even inflict slight damage to it despite Gazef being only around Hamsuke's level if not less.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thank you. I want this to be serialized so badly. Hell I might buy these just for the art value</br></br>  <br>She's pretty much a future contender for the Ainz bowl.<br><br>Cap this.</br></br></br>  <br>Dont know much about LNs<br><br>do some get official translations?</br></br></br>  <br> do some get official translations? <br>In Korean and Chinese, yes.</br></br>  <br>So was  Gazef , but we all know what happened to him.<br><br>I think you may be talking about a certain dark elf daughteru there anon<br>I'm pretty sure retard maids are for scolding and head chopping</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cocytus will win her. Mark my words.</br>  <br>I mean in English</br>  <br> Ainz Bowl <br> One's a human slave <br> One's a vampire that's promised to a spider <br>It's only a love triangle with Shalltear and Albedo. Nobody else will ever be more than a side character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, there's some. Spice and Wolf for example.</br>  <br>Which chapter is that from?</br>  <br>That was a different case though. Ainz had to fight there, whereas Evileye isn't his enemy.</br>  <br>3</br>  <br>Volume 3, chapter 4</br>  <br>Truly PA is the best NPC</br>  <br>Why is PA so perfect?</br>  <br> Aura is for petting and hugging <br>Have you seen her hips anon? She's for wild sexual intercourse in a jungle</br></br>  <br><br><br>I want Ainz to leave.</br></br></br>  If Ainz is a lich, does he have a phylactery?  <br> Ainz <br> Caring about PA </br></br>  <br>punished meido a best</br>  <br>Was he a human to even make a phylactery?</br>  <br><br>Please. We all know deep down inside he thinks PA is the hottest shit ever.</br></br>  <br>Yggdrasil liches don't have phylactery.</br>  Narby a retard but still moe  <br> Anyone even remotely related to PDL <br> Not an enemy of AOG and Nazarick <br>Her only hope is to immediately offer any and all information she has on PDL and submit herself to Papa Bones's judgement.<br>Maybe then she could get away with some mild punishment that would satisfy Entoma<br>If she resists in any way, I'm pretty sure she's just gonna end up bug food.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But she's Entoma's enemy. That's enough.</br>  <br>Entoma was beaten, she doesn't deserve Evileye until she can beat her.</br>  <br>She was given a chance at Ivileye in vol 7, and Ivileye doesn't have any other tricks than Insecticide. So long as Entoma is prepared Ivileye is dead, since she needed Gagaran and Tia's help to begin with.</br>  <br>Certain Death, black/white haired  supposed dragonkin  from the Slane Theocracy's Black Scripture.</br>  <br>Was Ainz the strongest of his guildmates or was he just the most loyal and stubborn to the game?<br><br>Because one of his original guild mates sound like he was an awesome character creator and MC wasn't that good at creating character background.</br></br></br>  <br> Was Ainz the strongest of his guildmates or was he just the most loyal and stubborn to the game? <br><br>The latter. Others were definitely stronger.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Chair <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz was the same people who continued to play Ultima Online until it died. He was a hardcore nut about the game and kept playing and replaying the same daily instances even while the rest of the Guild moved on to other, newer MMOs or to real life.</br>  <br> That spoiler <br>What would happen if she met a real one?</br></br>  <br>is that a fetus dragon?</br>  <br>That's too sad. Just too sad. What if she just goes "Take me to your leader?"</br>  <br>Where did it imply she was dragonkin? I just remember she hides her ears and is long lived.</br>  <br>Ainz was upper-middle tier with his equipment in Yggdrasil, but because he was more interested in RP'ing as a spooky lich, his build wasn't optimal for either PvP or PvE and he was more of a support. He was only guild leader because of his dedication to the guild and because Touch-Me had problems with another member.</br>  <br>It's the highest level Angel.</br>  <br><br>I admit, x character is strong. But can they beat Touch Me? And I'm not talking about World Champion Class Touch Me with his Guild-Weapon tier armor equipped. I'm definitely not talking about World Champion Class Touch Me as leader of Ainz Ooal Gown, a top ten guild, equipped with full divine gear, Guild-Weapon tier armor, and capable of the special forest-destroying skill World Break. I'm talking about World Class Champion Touch Me with 100 levels in Justice Warrior, physical stats and all resistances exceeding the limits through a cheap build and P2W, with Guild-Weapon tier armor, all of the World Class weapons owned by Ainz Ooal Gown, riding the Devourer of nine Worlds because he's a fucking dragonoid, with support from 9 level 100 NPCs and 40 other level 100 characters, one wielding the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, to begin with Ivileye likes Momon, not Ainz. So your point is kinda complicated to discuss cause we lack prophets here.</br>  <br>I totally forgot about that. I love the dual role he plays around with. I just wonder if the Momonga thing will backfire on him in the future.</br>  <br> riding the Devourer of nine Worlds because he's a fucking dragonoid <br><br>This always gets me.</br></br></br>  <br> Ainz was upper-middle tier with his equipment in Yggdrasil <br>This. And he wasn't even taking in the account of AoG or that he was decked out in all divine gear. He only put all divine gear on when the game was about to shut down. Ainz himself probably only has 50%-75% of his equipment slots in divine.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps the main problem for why Ainz's guildmates slowly lost interest in the game was because they were the only high level people in the MMO?<br><br>Since Ainz said that no one managed to successful raid their headquarters much less encounter their combat maids in front of the throne room, we can assume that the MMO got boring because no one could give Ainz's guild a real challenge.<br><br>Therefore, Ainz's guildmates in real life sought out MMOs where they could discover actual rivals since the MMO they were currently playing had no one worthy of being a rival.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Ainz had full divine for every slot by the time the game was ending, all his. Everything that belongs to his guild mates he adorned onto the Avatara so he didn't steal shit unless you count the guild staff, which isn't part of his divine tier items.</br>  <br>She was wounded when caught by surprise with a spell made specifically to kill insects. Evileye and co. were lucky she had that or Blue Rose would be recruiting right about now.<br>It's unlikely that it will be nearly as effective now that Entoma knows about it. If they meet up again, and Evileye doesn't get the jump on Entoma, she's as good as dead.</br></br>  <br>The rings he wore on each finger were divine-tier as well, right?<br><br>Or were they just really high level accessories?</br></br></br>  <br> Perhaps the main problem for why Ainz's guildmates slowly lost interest in the game was because they were the only high level people in the MMO? <br><br>Confirmed for not reading the novel.</br></br></br>  <br>All divine tier except the cash item ring which is above divine but below guild/wc. He's filthy rich.</br>  I'm living in Japan. Has been trying to buy the novel here. It's fucking sold out every stores, I've been trying for days but no result. It's sold out on Amazon too. Need to wait until 08/11 for restock. Fucking anime effect  <br>You should have bought it earlier then.</br>  <br>mug people and demand theirs overlord LN, i am sure you can find one</br>  <br>It's probably more like EvE Online or that Korean MMO where one player becomes the King of the server for a year through PvP. When you reach a certain level of play, you're more interested in protecting what you have rather than destruction. That's why other high level players didn't challenge their guild with their full might, and those who were willing to risk everything weren't skilled or wealthy enough to break through Nazarick's defenses.<br><br>Just look at EvE. The same players and roughly the same corps have sat on the top for several years now, especially the various generations of Goonswarm. I'm sure there's been attrition in the ranks, and we've seen the effects of people becoming bored with the game and going out with fiery bangs, and that's kind of what happened to Ainz's friends. Most of Ainz's attachment to Yggdrasil was the memories he made too, not just the game itself.</br></br></br>  <br>Uhh, most of their raiders were top tier, and at least one group had a World-Class item with them.<br><br> because they were the only high level people in the game <br><br>Come on, son. Don't skip over the talk segments like some kid with ADD.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tried Honto?</br>  <br>The Slane Theocracy is conducting some kind of Dragon experiments that would enrage any of the Dragon Lords if they ever found out, shortly afterward, Certain Death is introduced. So she's most likely either a result of those experiments, or a descendant of the Six Gods.</br>  <br>She's described as a legacy of the six gods anon</br>  <br>Are you talking about vol 4 intermission? Are you a moon reader? Cause I'm going off by the TL on Sky's page so correct me if I'm wrong but the discussion about Dragons was related to the revelation that the Dragon Lord of Calamity was rezzed which turned out to just be Sebas walking outside during the first chapter. <br><br>Naturally trying to kill a Dragon Lord would enrage other Dragon Lords no? Though in vol 4 intermission there was no mention of that at all.</br></br></br>  <br>That was  godkin  not dragonkin you retard<br>She's a descendant of the 6 six gods, who were all human. Otherwise, I highly doubt the Theocracy's specieist policies would be a thing.<br><br>No, an angel fetus plague bomb of about level 35</br></br></br></br>   The Goal of All Life is Death <br>Who the fuck in the New World can even survive this shit?</br>  <br>Sold out too</br>  <br>Maybe she's an NPC they made?</br>  <br>The ones who picked up cash items from 6 gods and 8 kings of course.</br>  <br>No one who doesn't have access to a self-revival item left behind by a player. So maybe about a dozen people max.</br>  <br>She's way too dumb if she is. It's much more likely she's just a descendent but of mixed blood like a human and an elf. Even theocracy faggots can't say shit if her ancestors are the 6 gods.<br><br>Plus she hides her ears for a reason.</br></br></br>  <br> The Goal of All Life is to Get BFTO* </br>  <br> New copy <br> About 1000 yen <br> Used copy <br> 1500+ </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there any fan art of her?</br>  <br> She's way too dumb if she is. <br>But what about Narberal?</br></br>  <br>Pixiv Doesn't have much of anything besides Albedo.</br>  <br>It's actually more of a punishment for Papa Jones than anything.</br>  <br>Pls anon no bully</br>  <br>Narberal at least understands that everyone got transported and their home was Yggdrasil as well as the concept of players. If CD knew as much as Narberal I suspect the Theocracy wouldn't be having as much trouble as they are now.<br><br>Or CD could just be a bitch keeping everything to herself, but that's unlikely as well, because she would be asking for hints of Shalltear being a npc instead of a Dragon Lord.</br></br></br>  Why is Narberal referred to as a retard?<br><br>Clearly I've only watched the anime</br></br>  <br>Even Retardberal probably knows more about players and NPCs than her so she's still most likely a native.</br>  <br>Read Volume 3. Or wait 3 weeks for the anime to get to that point</br>  <br>I meant Vol 2</br>  Why is this anime so good?<br><br>Why is Papabone so based?<br><br>Why is Albedo so moe?<br><br>Why is Chair VA so good?<br><br>Why is Mare so fuckable?<br><br>Why is Cocytus best uncle?<br><br>Why are pleiades best maids?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because even simple orders are too much for her to not almost immediately fuck up and then not realize what she's done wrong when scolded.<br>Only thing she's good at is being bulliable and zapping shit with lightning.</br></br>  <br>Did SkyTheWood drop the Log Horizon translation completley?</br>  <br><br>I guess I can wait-<br><br><br>Aww, I hoped she'd be a bit more competant than that.<br><br>Least she isn't an incompetent moe blob like I usually expect</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you haven't realized, the doppelgangers are always the most moe characters. Aside from Ainz, of course.<br><br> PA <br> Retard </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know I don't follow LH watched 2 seasons and said fuck it I'm ahead of the novels already.</br>  How does Narberal feel about Ainz?  <br>Like everybody else that's not Albedo or Chair.</br>  <br>Moist.</br>  <br>But the webnovel's not the final product.</br>  <br> Narberal <br> only one level in Doppelganger <br><br>What's the fucking point?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically I'm pretty sure all the npcs of Nazarick would jump at the chance to sleep with Ainz if allowed. They just don't dare budge in line.</br>  <br>I thought the LH anime was based off the LN. Pretty sure the LH threads kept saying that over and over and over. I've never even heard of a WN -&gt; anime adaptation.</br>  <br> The subject of Narberal’s adoration. No matter how far away he was, she definitely would hear him. </br>  <br> What's the point <br>The point is in Doppelganger, anon</br></br>  <br><br>These answers directly contradict one another.</br></br>  <br>see out of teh 200 world class items Ainz had 11, and the guild with the next most had 3.</br>  <br> inside you <br>How little you have yet to learn. Haven't you thought about the skull, anon? Where your brain is?<br>YOU are the one inside the skeleton. The game was set and match from the start.</br></br></br>  <br>Moist is not soaking wet.</br>  <br>The Light Novel is what the anime is adapted from, but the last few episodes of S2 were based on the Web Novel that gets written before the final editing into Light novel form. <br><br>But I actually misread your post and thought you were saying you were ahead of the novels, assuming you meant you were reading the raw webnovel, and not meaning the last few episodes of S2.</br></br></br>  <br>she's better than Shallchair at least in that she doesn't cause messes that Papa Bones has to clean up later<br>and she's pretty cute if you have a retard moe so there's that</br></br>  <br> Ainz suddenly telling one of his loyal subjects to come lay with him on his bed <br><br>Now that's a sight to behold. Demiurge will probably have the best reaction.</br></br></br>  <br> Come hither, Entoma <br> burst into a pile of bugs <br>Fuck man. A literal God asks you to sleep with him. I'm pretty sure every devout Christian would be more than willing to accept their god's hot and steamy love inside them.</br></br></br>  <br> The bed is just Shalltear </br>  <br>Yeah I get what you mean, but since they animated it I doubt it'll change much. At most it'll be like how much is changed in the anime of Overlord. Fluff/Dialogue/Context/Exposition. <br><br>It's not worth it when I got so much other shit to catch up on that doesn't even have anime adaptations.</br></br></br>  <br>That's one tiny ass bed, good thing Ainz doesn't need to sleep.</br>  <br> She ends up getting pregnant by proxy <br>Second wife for life, huh?</br></br>  <br>Didn't Overlord introduced a bunch of characters?</br>  <br>Anime only ones? No. Unless you count the no named faggots in the very first episode in the very first scene that comes back to get one shot by Touch Me. They sure as hell won't matter given how generic looking they are.</br>  <br>I thought the webnovel lacked some of the Nazarick guardians. <br><br>Maybe I'm thinking of a different WN &gt; LN adaptation.</br></br></br>  World Class items are all fun and all.<br><br> But do they have silly hats? </br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;/RO/ <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/treeofsavior/</br></br>  <br>albedo was added in the LN i think</br>  <br>They wouldn't do that with LH though, since the anime aired before the LN thereby it's more logical that a script was given to them by the author.</br>  What does Ainz look like with skin and flesh?<br><br>He is the guy who lives in his own tomb, right?<br><br>So what did he look like before he became a lich according to game lore?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ygdrassil character creation <br> start off by designing the living version of said character <br> you may then choose to turn it into a skeleton, zombiefy it, or turn it into a wraith <br> second part of character creation begins <br><br>I ca only imagine how much fucking time I would waste if you were given absolute free reign in a really robust character creation system.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not even the hard part. The hard part is how gear works. Anything not artifact/guild/world level can be customized due to how data crystals work. <br><br>So as far as gear goes, it's nearly Second Life tier, and above even ArcheAge tier where you use MS paint and import in MeMe pictures and all that shit.<br><br>And let's not get into the customizing NPC stuff, which ACTUALLY goes into Second Life tier allowing you to customize their image however you want.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember how much of a fucking timesink Ultima was back in the day. Fuck. I even go full autist mode with D&amp;D character sheets. I don't think I can handle Ygdrassil.</br></br>  <br>How can she be pregnant? <br>Skeletons don't have a penis</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it'd be more like if Ultima ran on Skyrim's engine and had an even bigger modding community. Imagine that. Is it any wonder barely anyone has divine gear when they are too busy trying to learn 3D modelling and shit so that their character is a special snowflake and all?<br><br>Cause aside from those exceptional items I listed, gear is only as cool as you make it.</br></br></br>    <br>Well that magic staff is suppose to contain powers of the gods, right?<br><br>And gods in any fiction or mythology are in charge of creation so if Ainz fused the staff with his non existent penis and activated fertilization powers, he could then get women pregnant.</br></br></br>  <br>Reading this conjured an image of ainz inserting his staff into his crotch as a makeshift penis.<br><br>I'm so fucked up</br></br></br>  <br> The Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown is actually Ainz's penis <br><br>No wonder he valued the guild so much.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a big staff.</br>  <br>That could actually work though.</br>  <br>What the fuck is that webm?</br>  <br>I don't know but its clear the right skel is female to let that baby go right on through</br>  So if I'm getting this right, Albedo used to the guild exclusive whore since in Japan, bitch means slut, and Ainz edited her to be his personal bitch, instead, am I right?<br><br>So if Ainz never changed Albedo's setting, and her original creator and Ainz were in the same room, she would slut herself to both her creator and Ainz, right?<br><br>But in the end, she would prefer her true creator over Ainz if asked if under the scenario where her original settings where never changed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>the wizard's staff has a knob on the end.</br>  <br> No, if her settings were never changed she  would kill every single Supreme Being. </br>  <br>for you.</br>  <br>Even Ainz's buddy who created her NPC character, too?</br>  <br> everyone will have cock the size of a skyscraper. </br>  <br><br>S'prolly because they abandoned her and the other NPCs.</br></br>  <br> EVERY-SINGLE-SUPREME-BEING </br>   Volume 5,6 Sebas <br><br>Man, its kind of like he is the black sheep of the Nazarick family of a sort because of his extreme good alignment. Except he is still highly respected and still loyal to the 41 beings.<br><br>Yeah there are neutral good or neutral NPCs but he is the only one with extreme good alignment in Nazarick, just as Touch Me created him to be<br><br>which makes him more interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> No, it's because of her hugeass backstory.<br> Her creator made her like what, just that he wasn't expecting her to come to life and actually carry out what was written in her chracter info.</br></br>  <br>fuck off skeleton</br>  <br><br><br>Okay then pretend that Ainz's giuild never abandoned the game and were all transported to the new world at the same time and none of the NPC characters got their original settings changed.<br><br>How different would Albedo act toward Ainz in such a situation?<br><br>I know the deep love wouldn't be there but how would Albedo treat the other Supreme Beings?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But it might be our lord and saviour</br></br>  <br>  She would act all respectful and loyal like everyone else but secretly she would be plotting their murders. </br>  <br> emotes <br><br>Ainz confirmed for shitposter</br></br></br>  <br>Give the guy a break. He's a fucking skeleton.</br>  <br>Damn, that sounds really fun.<br><br>I'm guessing Albedo's creator must be a masochist.</br></br></br>  I'm still mad this wasn't made by Bones.<br> So much skellyposting potential ruined.</br>  <br>I think it was Shalltear who was added in.</br>  <br> Like I said, it was just some silly backstory that didn't do shit in the game.</br>  <br><br>How strong was Ainz's guildmate, the green slime guy?</br></br>  <br> A VR MMORPG with insane customization and intricate details <br> No facial expressions <br> In 2138 <br><br>I cant even</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on, throw the guy a bone. Pfff</br>  <br>No, he was a pervert.</br>  <br>I mean he is a skeleton.</br>  <br>It wasn't Albedo? Wasn't Demiurge the original head of the guardians?</br>  <br> 2138 <br> Playing something that isn't Accel World </br></br>  The manga's a monthly right? <br><br>Raws aren't out yet?</br></br>  <br>It was noted by ainz when albedo was able to move her face.<br><br>But to me it makes sense.<br><br> team mate smites something <br> emotes <br> but because the emotes are limited to their actual faces you can't see from halfway across the field they slain something  <br><br>Could have both I guess but the emotes also show its still a game their playing from an anime prespective</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ainz can take one guildmate with him to the New World. Who is it and why is it Tabula?<br><br> inb4 Touch Me </br></br>  <br>I don't remember. It's late.</br>  <br>Chapter 7.5 was posted yesterday or so.<br>But it's only a filler chapter to publicize the anime.</br></br>  <br>It's a filler chapter, but is it meant to be this month's chapter? <br><br>Because that's shit if that's true.

Does the helmet protects her horns too? What's the point of that?</br></br>  <br>I'm confused.<br><br>Are those her horns? Or are they the helmet's horns? Do her horns go inside the helmet's horns? How does she take it off?</br></br></br>  <br>She needs them so she can get  horny  and so Ainz can  bone  her.</br>  <br>Either she puts it on magically or the front connects to the back of the helmet rather than slips on, look at the neck of it, that's a bit tight to slip on.<br><br>But its fiction, doesn't have to make sense</br></br></br>  <br>Would you want your beautiful horns to get chipped or broken in combat?</br>  <br> But its fiction, doesn't have to make sense <br>I hate it when people say that. That's not how it works.<br><br>Fiction absolutely still has to make sense, even if it's within its own universe. At the very least, it has to be internally consistent. If you violate your own rules, or make up new universe rules without explaining and justifying them, then you're breaking your readers' suspension of disbelief.<br><br>And all things considered, as far as LNs go, Overlord has been pretty good so far at cultivating our suspension of disbelief.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the LNs the armour is different, so I imagine the horns issue is probably just the anime staff being lazy.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's just one of her armor sets that Tabula set beforehand.<br><br>You know, similar to how Narberal could instantly switch between her adventuring outfit to battle maid mode?</br></br></br>  <br>Whatcha mean by the new world? <br>Something to do with the Novel or like if he could pick one of his former Guildmates to be in this world now.<br><br>Anime-only so far, I'll read it once the animes done with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But its a very minor detail, to explain EVERY intricate detail would draw out several volumes of filler.<br><br>Plus I'm an anime fag and I'm used to small issues like this being left out, I said fiction when I almost said ye old "cartoon".<br><br>I imagine in the manga and anime stuff like this may differ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't have an actual problem with the detail of the armor, it doesn't even affect my beef with the poster.<br><br>I just really hate the argument:<br> But its fiction, doesn't have to make sense <br><br>Nothing to do with this armor specifically.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the LN? Nigger this all the LN said about Albedo's armor. <br> A person dressed in a full set of black armor appeared. <br>The armor made the figure look like a devil. Covered with spikes and not showing the tiniest amount of skin. Wearing metal gloves with long claws, in one hand a black kite shield, the other holding an axe gently emitting a green glow. Wearing a blood red cloak fluttering in the wind, complementing the red blouse worn underneath.<br>Her helmet wasn't even mentioned. There's so little to go on that of course they got a bit creative, and they had to visually represent that it was Albedo somehow.</br></br></br></br>  Why is Albedo wearing three belts?  <br>Because the more belts you have the better you are at fighting.</br>  <br>To keep Ainz' chastity safe</br>  <br>Well shit. Maybe she uses that dimension travelling magic to walk perfectly into her armour?</br>  <br>Or she's following MMO logic and can put her armor on perfectly.</br>  <br>I wish her armor was more androgynous and had less boob-plate.<br><br>The impression I got from reading the LN was that you couldn't tell that she was female when she was wearing her armor.<br><br>It would also fit a bit with her creator's gap moe fascination (female voice coming from a manly armored figure).</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does Ainz keep Victim on his floor?  <br>Can someone edit the part at the end where papa bones opens his mouth into a webm where he opens and closes his mouth quickly?</br>  <br>If you mean on the same floor as Ainz, then, no, Victim stays on the 8th floor. The mall and guild hall are on the 9th floor, and the throne room is below that.<br><br>If you mean why Ainz keeps Victim stationed on the 8th floor at all times, then it's because Victim literally does nothing else but die on that particular floor to fulfill his security function.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, it was the second one I was after.<br>So he's useless outside of his floor?</br></br>  Can someone tell me where it was hinted that the  Evil Deities were NPCs of the Six Gods?   <br>Victim and the eight floor are something of a combo, though the details aren't exactly spelled out.<br><br>Basically, Victim dies, and giant AoE occurs that hits with all debuffs in the book (which is probably it's also dangerous to move him outside).<br><br>Afterwards, it's different depending on who you ask. I have heard that it's the traps on the floor that finish the job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you mean why Ainz keeps Victim stationed on the 8th floor at all times, then it's because Victim literally does nothing else but die on that particular floor to fulfill his security function. <br>SO, Victim is like a trap card floor boss?</br></br>  <br>massive debuffs, traps, and a terror effect has been hinted at-when the 1500 attacked, it was the 8th floor which beat them</br>  <br>No, he's just much more efficient in the 8th floor<br>He's at least somewhat effective outside it though since Papa Bones moved him to 1st floor temporarily while everyone was away during Vol. 4</br></br>  <br>When the group of players and NPC's that raided Nazarick in the past reached the 8th floor, as far as I know, they either died by Victim going full ALLAHU AKBAR on them or then Rubedo had something to do with it.</br>  <br>No<br>Bully.</br></br>  <br>The other thing I heard (which could have BEEN true, but changed) was that WN Ainz had used the red orb world-class item in his ribcage to finish off the 1500 man raid after Victim had its way with them.</br>  <br>No,<br>Bully.</br></br>  <br>Well he did mention that he could repel invaders at any time with a single use of his WC item, only that constant use would cost experience and that he'd eventually be too weak to actually do anything.</br>  <br> they either died by Victim going full ALLAHU AKBAR <br>My sides died there</br></br>  <br>its an art anatomy video about the pelvis<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-GA<wbr>8oC9PFQo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m27s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>bone marrow extracts?</br>  <br><br>WANNA BULLY THE RETARD.</br></br>  Will Papa Bones fuck over the Empire and that pretty boy Emperor?  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/l<wbr>qdtqb8pjsglors/Overlord_Illustratio<wbr>ns_Vol_1-9.rar</wbr></wbr></br>  Good morning, /OverLord/s.<br>How is everyone?</br>  <br>he only uses spells that were in the game though.

Though the Empire planning on allying with other countries against Nazarick was Demi's prediction (which ended up being true), I don't know if Ainz will take supposition as proof that the empire didn't plan to honor it's alliance with Nazarick.<br><br>Though from v9 spoilers, looks like he spared them even though the Emperor was afraid he would turn on them.</br></br></br>  <br>Cheers</br>  <br>Like Demiurge was at full power or anything when he fought. No one in the New World is a match for any of the floor guardians when they get serious baring WC BS.</br>  So what is this, Overlord Skeleton man adventures in super vr MMO and where can I watch it or read it?  <br>Same anon here.<br><br>But yeah, Victim is basically like a bomb that you have to hit with something for it to explode. What I've gathered from lurking /a/ and the wiki, when/if someone manages to kill Victim, he will cast an armada or debuffs and such, which in the end will either kill them directly or the other NPC's on the 8th floor will just steamroll the invaders because of the debuffs. He might also buff the 8th floor NPC's all the same while the invaders get debuffs. I'm not really sure how it works but that's the image I got regarding his role and powers in Nazarick. He's not the jihadist, he is the bomb the jihadist has.</br></br></br>  Just got the part where the thugs try to aumbush the Shalltear carriage. Holy hell the way Solution kills off this thug might be the most gruesome death I can imagen, it was just... mean...  <br>Clementine looks so soft.</br>  <br>Is she wearing sailor suit under that robe?</br>  <br>Hope you like acid baths.</br>  <br>Reminds me of a frog.</br>  <br>Wasn't there a vote for her if she lives or dies? Or was that the other girl adventurer.</br>  <br>"Well, if I want to kill immediately I can emit a stronger acid, but it’s such a rare chance for a man wanting to enter me, so I want him to at least enjoy it for a day or two.”<br><br>These casual lines are what's nailing it for me. Perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>I think she's very pretty. I like her horns because they look like a tiara.</br>  <br><br>But I think most of Nazarick isn't even undead.</br></br>  <br>That is some inception level shit going on, we are inside of a skeleton inside of us.</br>  <br>Most of the NPCs aren't undead but their standing army is undead. Though Ainz isn't really trying to give lectures on freewill to his lich and skeleton buddies so I don't know what hes going on about.</br>  <br>This has to be the single nicest post about her than isn't sexual in the slightest in regards to albedo.</br>  <br>Touch Me won the Ainz Bowl before the series events even started</br>  <br>But Retardberal is for bullying.</br>  <br>Something tells me those horns are hardest part of her body, and we are talking about tank with ABS OF STEEL here. If something that could chip them exist id be relatively suprised.</br>  <br>what does heteromorphic mean?</br>  <br><br><br><br>She's fine looking most of the time, but I can't deal with her autistic face.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically it means it doesn't normally look like a human.<br><br>Of course, that doesn't apply to nazarick characters since they've all been custom designed to look like cute lolis regardless of their original form.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like those autistic faces she makes, something about crazy people get me.</br>  <br>Albedo ship is sinking and Narbel ship is ready to set sail.

I hear Boku no Pico is a good gay 101.</br>    When I was around 11 or so I believe they thought something like that.<br>Then one day my dad caught me watching "something", and he asked to jump back to the last channel. So I did and it was Aika, instead of sperging and grounding me for watching "porn" he just reacted like "so you like this series? - eh... yeah, a friend recommended it to me - ok, do you want to watch it? - y-yeah - ok" and we watched it, together.<br>It was really weird because you know, Aika, it's not porn but it's weird to explain. But at least he knew I had an inclination for women.<br>Then we got a computer at home and they found I was watching porn so there was that too.<br>Then I brought a gf home and it basically cleared all doubts, now I even watched locodol last time I paid them a visit. <br><br>So, OP what I wanted to say is, it's a common doubt/fear for parents.

Umaru was progressing at a nice pace, but this just passed the line.<br><br>It's like turning into humans your monster girls.</br></br></br>  <br>If Rurumo can get a full season I'm sure Umaru can.</br>  <br>I thought that only happened in Lucky Star.</br>  <br> Tabasco <br> &gt;ʙʀᴀɴᴅᴏ <br>Is it intentional?</br></br></br>  I don't get it; doesn't Umaru air at 4am or something? Did they really have to move its slot because a swimming event happened at 4am and there were people who actually do wanted to watch it?  <br>The plot isn't the one-note "Umaru is shit to oniichan" gag, it's that she has a double life and is terrified. She still loves anime and games and shit and refuses to tell anyone about it. She's still kind a douche, but has developed into a sister who doesn't just abuse her brother the whole way. But that was never the point, it was all about her double life.<br><br>The fact that she's made friends actually advances her character development and the point of the series to a further degree, because now she is outright lying to Kirie and Ebina by taking on multiple personalities. It's going to become a big deal (if a manga like this can ever have a proper resolution)<br><br>Read the first page of the manga again where they explain what "himono" is. It's about the double life. Not being some vidya-obsessed asshole.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this nigga gets it</br>  <br>How good do you think that dog is at Monopoly?<br>Does he understand what Capitalism is?</br></br>  <br> Ebina <br>meant Sylphin but Ebina doesn't know shit about the real Umaru either</br></br>  Imagine what that hood must smell like. Just imagine.  This anime is amusing and has cool premise. I don't get why it gets this much attention.  <br>He's better at poker.</br>  <br>Salty coins?</br>  <br>faggot memester secondaries are shitposting hamster umaru everywhere</br>  <br>Because it's amusing and has a cool premise.</br>  <br>Because the character provides good reaction images.</br>  <br>wut<br><br>i thought anime was all about drawing 25 year old women and calling them 12<br><br>not drawing 3 year old girls and calling them 16</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded or something</br>  <br> 16 years old </br>  <br> 16 years oId </br>  adorable country bumpkin  <br><br> NNBR <br> Ebina-chan <br><br>This season exceeds the recommended dose of cute country bumpkins</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Komari is 14 tho</br>  <br>Same thing.</br>  <br>You know, that's a really interesting thought. Tomoko and Umaru would likely have some really interesting interactions with each other.</br>  <br> has dignity <br> posts on 4chan <br>Please leave and  tell me what it's like to have dignity? </br></br></br>  <br> Umaru: hi tomoko-chan <br> Tomoko: h-h-h-h-h-h-h-hi <br> Tomoko's inner dialogue: fuck off popular shitter you think you can look down on me because you're beautiful at least let me grope those breasts <br><br>there i just wrote the entirety of their interactions</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Would Umaru  fail to befriend Tomoko? </br></br>  <br> there i just wrote the entirety of their interactions <br>If Tomoko can be friends with Yuu, she can be friend with Umaru.</br></br>  <br>the sad thing is, life is really like this. you can't show the outside world your quirky self or they'll treat you as a lesser. they only want to see a flawless person who is always nice and proper or they'll throw you aside and you can lose jobs, status, etc.<br><br>i wish i didn't know your feels, urmaru. i wish i didn't</br></br></br>  <br> i'll take two bumpkins </br>  <br>She became friends with Yuu back when Yuu was a nerdy girl with glasses. Yuu only became pretty and popular after they separated in school.<br><br><br>Umaru only makes friends with those who approach her first. She is scared of being rejected and won't become friends with people of her own volition.<br><br>As for Tomoko it's pretty obvious she doesn't want friends and unless the teacher from her school is there she sure as hell won't initiate a conversation.<br><br>Tomoko's really just kind of a combination between Kirie and Umaru, but the difference is she's a pretty nasty and petty person instead of being nice deep down like those two are. So unknown if they could really become friends or Tomoko would just be bitter since all she'd see would be Umaru's perfect school form.<br><br>I guess Umaru could create a fake persona to befriend her like she did with Kirie and Sylphin though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah i think umaru and tomoko actually would have a decent amount of common ground but neither of them would initiate the friendship<br><br>it is interesting to think about what they could talk about if they were friends, though. umaru seems to play stuff like FPS and monster hunter and watch a wide variety of things, tomoko seems all about eroges and VN-style stuff. i wonder if tomoko would call umaru a pleb</br></br></br>  <br>That was basically me with Mitsudomoe<br><br> S2 announced!

Surly I'm not alone, right?</br>  <br>Wasn't there an anime that got cancelled after 2-3 episodes a couple years ago? I don't remember what it is or what it's about. I only remember a screenshot that got posted a lot, with a few girls sitting down somewhat surplex-like, and their skirts were completely flipped and their panties were showing.</br>  <br>Isn't there also supposed to be a sexy fuckable version of this deformed creature? I could swear I've seen it around here at some point.</br>  <br><br>Is it the non-finalized design from the one shot?

But she and the show is entirely inoffensive. So I don't really get what the deal is. <br>It's not as if people freak about about cute girls from other series.</br></br>  <br>That seems like an awfully simple thing to make, and they want 50 bucks for it?<br>I bet the material is shit, like all officially licensed cosplay items.</br></br>  <br>What is the one-shot?<br>People keep mentioning it but I've never seen it.</br></br>  <br>They do though. Usually people who like genres with nothing in common leave each other alone, unless they're super new, since that discussion is so monotonous and unintelligent, but Umaru getting posted as reaction images everywhere just draws far more ire.</br>  <br>Chapter 0</br>  <br/>  <br>Gave me PTSD</br>  <br> implying i can project myself onto this thing </br>  <br>I'm already blanking out when trying to remember the show, Ebina is onichans love interest and not Sylphi right?</br>  <br>Is that an Amiboo?</br>   GEEMU   <br>Yes.</br>  Umaru won't be chiby Himouto anymore accroding to the last RAW<br><br>http://raw.senmanga.com/Himouto!_Um<wbr>aru-chan/117/1 <br><br>SHE QUITs</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Good.</br>    <br><br> implying she has the willpower </br></br>  <br> implying manga aren't allowed to have story arcs before returning to normalcy </br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS THING</br>  /a/ confirmed  Next episode Murderfish incoming, some people is going to hate it and others gonna love it (specially TF).<br><br>The playlist with specials (actually 20, this guys throw one after another):<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And the character songs of every girl<br><br> Miia <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeZ<wbr>A87zIICk<br><br> Papi <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3R<wbr>xycLwmnQ<br><br> Cerea (I'm spiderfag but I love this one) <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJO<wbr>Q2siJ2j4<br><br><br>As every thread report and ignore the shitposters, crossboarders and secondaries going full retardation.

What would you do to show her that either her physiological differences from a human woman either don't matter to you, or are minor obstacles that can easily be overcome with a little creativity?<br><br>I want to hear your ideas.<br><br> One thing I'd do for Miia is take her dancing. I'd put in the effort (probably learning it without her knowing so I could surprise her) to research and learn dancing techniques for human and Lamia partners, and then give her basic lessons. Miia not only strikes me as someone who'd find dancing romantic, but knowing she could do something that required feet just as well as an human woman could would probably make her feel very special. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Darling <br> Hubby <br> Master <br> Husband <br> Honey <br>One of those has to be it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kurusu Kimihito.</br>  <br><br>Kimohito Kurusu, but even Smith acknowledges it's just easier to call him "Darling" since she's heard it so much.</br></br>  <br>Give that bitch a blanket.<br><br>MGs love blankets.</br></br></br>  <br>Darling is one of the better harem protags mind you, he's cool in my book.

No announcements have been made yet. <br>And then Polt!!!</br></br>  <br> See  <br>I saw that. But the point is it is distressing to her enough that she stopped the sex. Just because you are fine with being hurt doesn't mean you should nor consider her feelings.

Tell me anons, is the price okay? I haven't bought music online before(especially with international shipping), so a little apprehensive about this. On the other hand, I think I paid about $30 local for a twin CD set of Human Seed Destiny soundtrack. But that was a few years back.<br><br>If we break the price down by number of songs though, 32 songs, works out to about $3.50 each.

So never.</br>  <br>There's something really cute about them, too bad they didn't have more interactions.</br>   19 posters   <br>For some reasons I really like them a lot as a pair, I have a feeling they could have built up quite the popularity under different circumstances.</br>  <br>It's all the contrast in both appearance and personality. They're basically polar opposites.</br>  <br>A Sounagi mook would be so much fun. They could be secret agents working on infiltrating Kisumi's evil organization, or bodyguards on a mission to protect Gou from a weird ass stalker thief, or just a compassionate neighborhood cop trying to comfort a broken and lonely astronaut who lost his best friend that never came back from a space mission years ago. The possibilities are endless.</br>  <br> Nagisa pairings <br> being popular <br>Anon, I...</br></br></br>  <br>I said this as someone who never cared for Nagiei or any other Nagisa pairings for that matter, I'm sure Nagisafags who are dubious about Rei would have latched onto it.</br>  Preview for Flower Afternoon's illustration. Seems like they are going to be fairies.<br><br>Fairies.</br></br>  <br>I can't imagine how Sousuke's gonna pull off that look, Rin's gonna look amazing though.</br>  <br>The Frees are finally becoming what we all knew they were since the first episode.</br>  <br>Rest of merch looks okay. Or as expected from Taito kuji, at least.<br>Here're the chibi.</br></br>  <br>Design glass bottle. 8 centimeters tall.</br>  <br> Fairies <br>That's extremely gay.</br></br>  <br>Flake seal.</br>  Who would you  date ? A succubus titty monster or vampire loli?  <br>Both</br>  <br>Loli.</br>  <br><br>A loli vamp of course.</br></br>  <br>Albedo all the way</br>  <br>im not a pedophile</br>  Vampire the only real answer.  THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUE ANSWER  Are you implying there's an answer other than Albedo?  <br>"Good thing she's like actually a thousand years old!"<br>-upcoming reply from anon<br><br>my pick: titty monster; I don't like smug lolis</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good thing she's like actually a thousand years old!</br>  <br>Demiurge.</br>  Gotta protect dat smile, man  <br>You're a pedophile if you like either one. Considering the game is 12 years old and with time taken to level, assemble the guild, and farm stuff to build Nazarick neither can be over 10 years old.</br>  <br>I always imagined the age of consent was because it was assumed that by the age of 14/16/18 the person would be mature enough to understand what it is they're doing.</br>  <br>Actually it's because that's how long they think it would have taken to sell off their daughter.</br>  <br>im gonna go with titty monster since Ains backspaced the 'shes actually a bitch' part</br>  <br><br>oh ho ho ho ho<br><br>for that i'll post my best smug loli</br></br></br></br>  <br> pedophile <br>When it's a drawn picture<br><br>i want normalfags to leave</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vampire loli. Always vampire loli.</br>  <br> vampire <br> loli <br> vampire loli <br>How is this a contest?</br></br></br></br>  wasn't it implied albedo has another form?  <br> implying its not in response to ridiculous arguments about the age of 2d characters and what is and isn't loli <br><br>Plz go</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> thinking pedophilia has anything to do with age </br></br>  Neither. I don't like leeches and Albedo's mouth weirds me out.  <br>In order to date either one of them you need to first be an undead skeleton. Which means you can't get a boner even though you are all bones.</br>  <br>Magic son, he don't have to explain shit around somehow achieving an erect penis</br>  <br>Succubus titty monster.<br>Titty monsters have always been my favorite, in this life, and in each of my previous lives.</br></br>  <br>A chair please</br>  think of chairs and stuff when trying to not bust a nut, shalltear you fucked it for me  <br>Where is the loli? All I see is a succubus and a chair.</br>  Ive seen this smockin' milf around /a/ lately, who is she and what anime  What's the chair meme? I am fucking slow, please spoonfeed me. Or is it actually explained in a translated novel ?  <br>Albedo is the only choice.</br>  <br>Left has better  hips </br>  Is it true albedo is not exist in the WN?  <br>Yes, Albedo and her sisters do not exist in the WN. <br><br>It's a hard choice, they're both actually remarkably pure, though Albedo is more of a pure waifu after Ainz modification of her. Shalltear has a ridiculous number of fetishes and things though.</br></br></br>  <br>So does Demiurge take her role in the WN or someone else?</br>  <br>Albedo, Overlord</br>  I choose Aura    <br>I choose  Papa Bones  so  he could hug me and spook me at night. </br>    <br>autistic maido</br>  <br>Is there even a choice?</br>  I Shalltear that pussy up  <br>This is some grade A nightmare fuel</br>  <br>I'm afraid I already have a vampire loli but I suppose it couldn't hurt to have a spare.</br>  <br>This, fucking this.<br><br>The purest smile, based upon the deaths of humans.</br></br></br>  <br>A vampire loli obviously. in this particular case I might make an exception though.</br>  Vamploli I mean just hearing her talk makes my dick hard  <br>Aura is the daughteru, you can't fuck your own daughteru.</br>  Semen demon vs blood demon.<br><br>The answer is obvious.</br></br>  <br>Is it just me or does the thumbnail look more cuter than the full sized image for some reason?</br>  <br>I'd rather lose bodily fluids other than my blood, thank you.</br>  <br>i'll take the third option</br>  <br>Is there a dub for this or do I just kill myself?<br><br>My favorite way to watch is by multi tasking. <br><br> Anyinfo.jpg </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well when you post her then...</br></br>  <br>Why not the other dark skinned pointy ear?</br>    <br>Both, that is an unfair question.</br>  <br> succubus titty monster <br>yes please</br></br>  <br><br>Mah nigga.</br></br>  <br> implying <br><br> niggers </br></br></br>  <br>By this logic, fapping to bara isn't gay.<br><br>I want pedos to leave.</br></br></br>  <br> succubus <br>Actually, she is an imp.</br></br>   faggots on this board actually passing on a lolipire   <br> defiling your daughteru <br>Subhumans get out REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br><br>She's both. She has 30 racial levels, only 10 of which are imp. Some of those are succubus and she has at least one more race since the max racial level is 15, but that isn't known. Probably Fallen Angel.</br></br>  <br>Just you.</br>  <br>I still think her last race is  Semen Deamon. </br>  <br> wanting to fuck a cold corpse who lacks empathy <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br> Its a trap </br>  <br> &gt;wanting to fuck a shitty chair. </br>  <br>Reverse i mean.</br>  <br>Loli has better personality while succubus is cuter in monster form. It's hard to choose</br>  <br>Why does this series have so many retarded faces?</br>  <br>vampire loli only because she good at shucking</br>  <br>Or maybe  Fluid Druid </br>  <br>The latter</br>  <br> implying vampires don't  <br> scrape <br> and lick </br></br></br>  <br> Implying mare isn't the master of all things fluid and druid. </br>  Would Albeido like Ainz if he hadn´t altered her description?  <br><br> though Albedo is more of a pure waifu after Ainz modification of her.  <br>And because of that she can't ride her lvl 100 mount summon</br></br></br>  <br>She'd jump his bones.</br>  <br><br>What's her mount? I'm guessing it's something from the LN? Will we get to see it in the anime? And why couldn't she ride it before?</br></br>  Albedo is too desperate unlike delicious Shalltear.  <br>Albedo would like everyone if Ainz hadn't changed her description.</br>  <br>Her mount is bicorn (dual corn unicorn) but bicorns won't let virgin ride them (they will collapse to the ground if ridden forcibly). That's one one reasons why she jumps ainz later on. This stuff from vol 8 so it's unlikely to feature in the anime (it could be added anyway since it doesn't affect the timeline)</br>  <br><br>So she's a virgin until volume 8? And succeeds in jumping him and doing it? Indicating that he can indeed have sex and does have the necessary parts? Or it fails and she still can't?</br></br>   Tsukihime has better story, characters and setting <br> Fate is more popular <br><br>Explain this to me. Why did Nasu sell out?</br></br></br>  <br> Two of the heroines are flat chested <br> Has an H scene where he cannot stop fixating on a girl's ass </br></br>  <br><br>good chart but what's to add?</br></br>  <br>Because he wanted money.</br>  <br>That sounds like Starcraft 2</br>  <br>tamamo a best</br>  sadpanda/exhentai thread<br><br>here's some to start off<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/822910/80ffd3<wbr>bdae/<br>http://exhentai.org/s/43b1b15bae/70<wbr>3409-6<br>http://exhentai.org/g/766816/c59078<wbr>9e1a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/753401/1aeff5<wbr>affd/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> they also do things like payment tiers and delays so that you can't just pay, download everything on the same day and then unsubscribe <br><br>It's mostly related to Patreon's stupid payment management, all payments are only processed on a fixed day once a month. So artists have to do something to protect their content (usually password protected downloads) or anyone could just pledge, download everything for a whole month and then cancel before the payment date.</br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/838016/c88993<wbr>fc1d/</wbr>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>I take it that you come here just to hover over the links to get titles and buy them right?</br>  <br>Is this Gentaro?</br>  Someone made a cool personal drawthread but it was deleted for some reason, so I decided to make my own! Request anyone! Kobato delivery from last thread.  <br><br>Guys I don't draw at all, I could use MS paint, but the horrid monsters would probably ruin all of anime for you.</br></br>  <br>I'd appreciate anything you put effort into, but it's fine either way.</br>  There is a general drawthread, there is no need to clutter the board with this.    <br>Amputee moe.</br>  Is there a character in all of anime that has more insane willpower than Emiya Shirou?  <br><br>Kenji Endo.</br></br>  <br>I do.</br>  Shirou has a long way to go to truly stand at the top with the gods and goddesses of GUTS and WILLPOWER.  <br>Pretty much any other shounen battle MC. But I guess that's already been said.<br><br>It's not exactly a rare character trait in manga, even outside of shounen stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Yup. You have to be one twisted individual to insert as shirou that's for sure. I don't think any sane chuunibyou would deny that.</br>  What are the best reaction pics from this season you've made yourself or have stolen off others?
