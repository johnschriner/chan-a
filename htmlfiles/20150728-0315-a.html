(It was also covered by Imai and Chiaking in the old im@s radio, but nobody remembers that anymore.) <br><br>Point is, It's not an im@s song. Why would they put it in the anime?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why would they put more Kaede in the anime? <br>A question requiring no answer.</br></br>    Why is the 2011 anime so much better than CG? Excluding any Kaede screentime, of course.  anyone has the theory image of usamin's old age and her song explanation of her depression?  <br>I agree. The first one was so much more enjoyable to watch. CG is only worth watching because of pic-related.</br>  <br><br>Because it lacks more Kaede and Ranko. It really should just have those two on screen at all times.</br></br>  I want to rock her world, all night.  <br><br>She'll get her time soon, with plenty of Natsuki and jelly Miku.</br></br>    <br>Aiko's so sweet, too bad she's so underrated.</br>  <br>I would like to get to know her cute friend better.</br>  <br><br><br> Riina's panty status: moist </br></br></br>  <br><br>Riina wasn't the only one with wet panties during that scene.</br></br>  <br>Not in my heart.</br>  <br>The highs were higher, but the lows have definitely been way lower than anything in CG so far. The whole evil Kuroi shenanigans was also a lot more stupid compared to Mishiro, but there's still chances for her to do some cartoonishly evil stuff as well.<br><br>Also, TakeP is just way better than AkaP.</br></br></br>  That Kaede episode is what I've been waiting for since CG started. It was alright. I think they could've used Koi Kaze better, that song had the potential to be Yakusoku or Nemuri Hime tier from im@s2011.  <br>You sir have a great taste.</br>  <br>Because there is too much focus on Rin and NG. Its ok if its Uzuki. But you are right, only thing enjoyable are Kaede's scene.</br>  <br>Simple yet sympathetic development with small office starting up using lively girls, everyone getting some impactful scenes not just 5 favorites, danketsu, no sterile plastic agency, lolis that actually did something.</br>  <br>Well Kaede is a support cast so it isnt surprising but it still have its own impact in the story. Its my favorite episode so far. As they delivered Kaede with much more develop than the freakin whole CG cast.</br>  <br> As they delivered Kaede with much more develop than the freakin whole CG cast. <br>Tell me about it...</br></br>  After the "interrogation".  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br><br> <br><br>Aiko is in my top 5 as well. If Scamco had any sense, they'd put her and Uzuki in a healing unit.<br><br>She's the Regen to Uzuki's Cure 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Anya was born in the 25th of December she'd be a Christmas miracle.  <br>I want to get smashed with Anya and Minami while Ranko is drinking tomato juice.</br>  <br>And if Kaede was born on the 25th of December she'd be a Christmas cake.<br> &gt;tfw all my Kaede pictures just got up and disappeared </br></br>  <br><br><br> Had the potential to be Yakusoku or Nemurihime <br><br>Okay, the Kaede overreaction nonsense in these threads really needs to get toned down a bit.<br><br>Kaede is not the main character. The main characters are NG (and TakeP), supported by the rest of the Cinderella Project and a few other characters. The main focus of the show we see is on the growth of those involved in the Project. How they start as a ragtag bunch of strangers held together only by way of being chosen for the same initiative, and how they develop into a strong, cohesive group. A Cinderella story.<br><br>Kaede has already had her Cinderella story, so to speak. She started at the bottom, and worked her way up until she reached the top. So in a show that wants to tell the tale of a Cinderella girl from start to finish, why should they devote such a cathartic moment, as Yakusoku was, to someone who has already had their development offscreen?<br><br>I'll admit, I like Kaede. One of my favorite CGs, even. She's a fun, cool character and I love Hayami's voice, but this nonstop Kaedeposting in every CG thread is becoming tiresome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Minami probably doesn't drink but can you drink the Vodka fairy under the table?</br>  <br> So in a show that wants to tell the tale of a Cinderella girl from start to finish, why should they devote such a cathartic moment, as Yakusoku was, to someone who has already had their development offscreen? <br>Maybe because that's what A-1 likes, and they're obviously playing favorites?<br>I mean Mirio, Rika or Kanako will never get anything as big as Kaede had this episode. They won't ever have any emotional scenes, or glorified on stage or any shit. They won't have a "cinderella story" happening to them.</br></br></br>  <br>Hell no, I bet Anya could the hags a run for their money with her drinking.</br>  <br>I get that she's not the main character and I didn't mean Yakusoku-tier story-wise. I just meant that Koi Kaze as a song has a lot of potential to be a great insert in my opinion and they could've implemented it better, rather than cutting to dialogue after the first few lines.</br>  <br> Uzuki is the only one frowning <br><br>RIP gambarimasu.</br></br></br>  <br>kaedefags are just celebrating A-1 finally deliver Kaede, it will be back to usual thread next week or change focus to Nana if next week is Nana episode</br>  <br> usual thread <br>Kaede threads were a thing from the start.</br></br>  This woman is your friend. She fights for profits.  <br>Thats sad bro. Good thing I got one on my Phone then Laptop then Desktop.</br>  <br><br>Because the current show's focus is far too widespread among different idols.<br><br>They should just make Rin be the main character. <br><br>That would have made for a much better show. <br><br>Better than wasting time on Giantess Autist, Hipster Rock Autist, Goth Chuuni Autist, Illegal Immigrant Ruskie, lolis and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  Are ML girls allowed?  <br>There are some lewd Rins in that pic.</br>  <br> lolis <br>They didn't waste 5 minutes with them altogether, not even with Dekoration episode.</br></br>  <br> goth chuuni autist <br> illegal immigrant ruskie <br>sasuga rinfag <br> athough I have to agree that the giantess and hipster are fucking terrible </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Honda Mio must be removed.</br>  I can't get enough of Tsuki no Hotori de.<br>Azusa has an angel's voice.</br>  <br><br> Hating on Kirari <br><br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's hard to like her when SHE TALKS like THIS all the MOTHER fucking TIME and it's so ear GRATING.<br><br>Plus that fucking ":3" face all the time makes me want to punch her face in..</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because of our difference in tolerance but I love Kirari's speech, it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy whenever she talks.</br>  Which idols would you swap?  <br>Kirari, Anzu, Sachiko, Syoko, Koume, Anya, Minami, Ranko, Miria, Rika, Mika, Akane, Kaede and KWSM</br>  <br>No matter what, the lolis would still stay irrelevant, so whatever.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy happy whenever she talks. </br>  <br>To each his own nigga, she's not even my favorite but she can still put a smile on my face.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy happy whenever she talks. </br>  http://strawpoll.me/5034239<br><br>The poll is still up. Vote if you have not already.<br><br>When did you start following Im@s?</br></br></br></br>   HS subs still fucks up Anastasia's Russian <br>Is it something wrong on their end or mine?</br>  Dumping Rin from pixiv  <br>Psych.</br>  <br>That looks like Yukari</br>    <br>Its all Rin's fault.</br>  <br>He prob means Yukarin</br>  <br><br> That hair <br> That outfit <br>That's Yukari</br></br></br></br>  <br>READ <br><br>XD</br></br></br>  <br>For all I know that's another guy who doesn't want him to dump a comic about "Rin", anonymity is stupid that way. My mistake.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy whenever she talks. <br><br>I know how you feel. It's the same with Akane too. It's nearly impossible for me not to smile whenever I see and/or hear her.</br></br></br>  <br>This with pretty much all the idols with some kind of unique speech, it feels refreshing to hear when everyone speaks plainly.</br>    Would Chihaya and Kaede be a good unit? Or would they kill their fans with their no stop puns?  <br>Azusa and Kaede would be better, Chihaya and Kaede stand on 2 different ends of the spectrum it feels weird putting them together.</br>  24 starring Idols when?<br><br>End boss is Chihaya. <br><br> Chihaya wins </br></br></br></br>  <br>You underestimate Anya's capabilities.</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  <br><br>Cinderella Girls Xenoglossia when?</br></br>  <br>Kaede feels like a fusion of Azusa and Takane, two people that Chihaya seem to have a good affinity with (as long as breasts are not concerned).</br>  <br>Well at least with Kaede she doesn't have to worry too much, she has pretty modest breasts looking at it.<br> And I feel the same way but with Anya being a combination of Takane and Makoto </br></br>  <br>Well I think there good too. But Kaede doesnt get drunk on stage and mostly act quiet and mature when not intoxicated. So I think the normal Kaede and Chihaya would be good both are good singers too.</br>  <br> TakanexMakoto=Anya? <br><br>I dont see it.<br><br><br><br>Clearly see this; Takane's mysterious persona and Azusa's ara ara attitude is clearly Kaede's trait. Still if Azusa and Kaede drinks I doubt she can handle the top cake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could see TakeP being a killer.</br>  <br>Light hair, astrology nut, rather refined elegance and naivete from Takane with the short-mid length hair and some boyish charms from Makoto, probably thinking too deeply into it, it's not really right to find 765Pro parallels in CG.</br>  New Love Laika when?  <br>The only thing parallel with CG and 765 are Haruka X Uzuki with the "muh gambarimasu".</br>   You will never get molested by Kaede. <br><br>Fuck my suffering.</br></br>  <br>That's silly, the new Love Laika is a trio</br>  When's the PV?<br><br>Also, is Nana the only one who works in the cafe?<br><br> Why are these two paired together in some pics? Is it because of cock rings, pegging, and mouth gags? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be unfair to the other groups. No one else would be able to compete.</br>  <br> Anzu, Miria and Rika <br>One can drea.</br></br>  I've neither played nor watched any part of the IP. Should I start with the first series or jump straight into CG? What about that mecha spinoff? Do the shows have high production value when it cones to musical performances?  Best unit comming thru.<br><br><br>Hahaha keep dreamin.</br></br></br>  <br>Either. Preferably the 2011 anime first. The mecha is not related in anyway but name.<br><br>Don't expect LL! It's pretty okay.</br></br></br>  <br>I watched all; idol with robots was so fucking XXX. But I suggest the 2011 one first before going CG.</br>  <br>Ｐさん・・・少し良いですか？<br>Could I talk to you for a moment, P-san?<br>ん？何だ？ゆかり<br>What is it, Yukari?<br><br>あのこれ・・・よろしければお昼に・・・<br>Umm...

The mecha spinoff is silly, but it's not really horrible. Keep in mind it's really not Im@s.</br></br>  <br>And we make some small ajustments and we've for CG's vocal powerhouse and a bankrupt Cygames all in 1 turn.</br>  <br>Mecha spinoff is related to the series only in name. Personalities drastically differ and voice actors too. The only thing in common is the base designs and names of the characters. Otherwise, it's your standard sunrise mecha show.<br><br>Aside from a shared setting, there isn't really any connection between the two. (Although CG chronologically takes place after the 2011 series). The approach and story framing of 2011 and CG drastically differ from each other so each is a completely different experience and it doesn't matter which you start on. But for Chronology's sake, go start on 2011 first.<br><br>In my opinion, both series are well animated where it counts (i.e. the performances) but fuck should I know what your standards are for these things, so it's best you watch it for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we've for <br>we've got</br></br>  <br>I love Rin and Uzuki</br>  <br>the fake CMs were easily the best part of the idolmaster anime, i'd love to see them do one with kaede as protag</br>  <br>I agree here. You should only get into the anime if you already like it.<br><br>Get the english translated PSP games which run on ppsspp perfectly (I think). Reccomended to get morning(?) sun first as it has all three girls translated, Moon next as Chihaya is adorable,a nd Wandering Star last as doing either Yukiho or Iori's route will spoil you thanks to Takane.<br><br>Check out doujins, the memes/lore, some of the manga.<br><br>If you still want more, some routes are translated, check out Yukipo.<br><br>tldr<br>PSP games&gt;Music&gt;Translated Stuff&gt;Doujins/Lore&gt;Anime&gt;Puchimas<br><br>CG and ML are pretty much just check the translated stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should I start with the first series or jump straight into CG? <br><br>Either is fine. Do note that the respective anime adaptations are only the barebones experience of their source material. They are plenty enjoyable as they are, but plenty of in-jokes or references will fly over your head if you have zero knowledge about the franchise. Furthermore, both series are guilty of shafting some of the characters to the side. So if you like a particular character, you might want to dabble in further im@s media to see them have further depth. Both adaptations only really managed to flesh out select characters.<br><br> What about that mecha spinoff? <br>Greatest Love Story between a Girl and her Giant Mecha ever told.<br><br>If you watch Sunrise Mecha shows not named Gundam, you know what to expect. The only thing im@s in this show is the name and designs of the characters.<br><br> Do the shows have high production value when it cones to musical performances? <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XLr<wbr>IpgdFwVk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is she alone?  <br>When is she going to protect her man and remove Rin?</br>  <br>Watch Puchimas first</br>   ONE <br> TWO <br> KISS<br>KISS</br> </br></br>  <br><br>I doubt it will ever happen but I hope we will get a bunch of ovas giving focus and time to the voiced idols not appearing in the anime.</br></br>  <br>At this point even a cameo would be enough.</br>  Get ready guys for some shit posting.

Maybe except Anya who actually shows up a lot.</br>  When will it be time for Laika?  <br> Producer, I'm already old. </br>  <br>Hopefully soon.</br>  <br>Happy Birthday, Minami-san!</br>  <br>Bullshit.</br>  <br>I need these three in my life.</br>  <br>Make that four.</br>  <br>coolidolmasterrace.jpg</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hnM<wbr>FvPhV8-o</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Did you even watch the anime? Everyone but Love Laika had an episode just for their respective units.<br><br>Asterisk has an episode just for them. Actually, if we include this one. Possibly two episodes.<br><br>Minami, herself, has started establishing herself as the leader of the group and taking charge which is really great. Anya may possibly get one but I'd honestly have her combine with Ranko and have an ep just for the idols in the dorms.<br><br>In the deko ep. Miria was her usual joyful self. We got to see more of Rika's character. I've actually liked the way they're going with Kirari by making her this older sister, it adds a level of maturity to her that I don't think I've seen enough to appreciate her before.<br><br>Candy Island is definitely the biggest problem as Minami and Chieri don't stick out (fat jokes aside) which is why some anons want Chieri to go dere already as giving them an episode again would be pretty meh.<br><br>Anzu and Ranko are solid enough to stand out by themselves.<br><br>What seems to be happening now is that A1 is letting the idols play off the other secondary idols.<br><br>Yes there will be a ton of NG but that's because they are the main characters.<br><br>I think it's still a bit too early to say. Take a chill pill, negative Nancy. You're not the only one who wants them to be shown more but it's useless to look into the done when we could be excited about the good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kiss me, Kanade!</br></br>  How old is Nana?  <br><br>17.</br></br>  <br>17</br>  <br> In the deko ep. Miria was her usual joyful self. We got to see more of Rika's character. <br>We didn't see any of that happening.<br>Candy Island is pretty much the same, except Anzu.<br>Any anyways we don't have enough episodes for them to shine like this, and indeed A-1 doesn't seem to be interested in them, from the very beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure in one episode she said something like she is forever 17 but how old is she actually?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Only thing we know for sure is 21+</br></br></br>  <br>We actually know for sure she's 24+, given that she had to wear bloomers in school</br>  <br>Meanwhile Mio is forever unpopular no matter how many screentime and character development she gets.</br>  <br> unpopular <br>Miria and Rika would love to be as unpopular as her.</br></br>  <br>I'm kissing her</br>  <br>Rika's not really unpopular you loli-conspiracist</br>  <br>well if you're a freaking rip-off as an idol; yeah you'll gonna be unpopular.</br>  <br>She's nothing like Miki</br>  <br>Just wait till PP.<br><br>Hoenstly, I actually really like Mio. She really feels like the one who gets everyone excited and moving. <br><br>She's been fun.<br><br> When she said she was happy to to not quit won me over. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-1 is interested in popular characters, not characters who don't even rank in the elections.<br><br>In the last two elections : <br>Rika ranked #41 and #50<br>Kanako ranked #30 and #37<br>Miria didnt rank at all<br><br>Why are you so surprised ? You should feel lucky these characters even made it into the anime, and as "main characters" you can see them in almost every episode. <br>Cherish what you have, or spend more money to have them rank higher.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miria is joy. She's upbeat. She's happy. she's the incarnation of the joy of being a child.<br><br>What more do you want her to do?<br><br>I'm not too sure on Candy Island but I do think Dekoration will get some eps since we may get a Jougasaki ep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miria and Rika don't get as many screentime as Mio</br>  WALLOWING IN DEPRESSION WITH NANA  <br>She is extremely unpopular.<br><br>Well yeah, this is obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather they didn't make it and then it wouldn't surprise me that they get nothing.<br>Also Anzu is still not completely unpopular, then why is it she doesn't get to do anything either? And Chieri?</br></br>  Kaede brings the comfiest episodes, Doubt we'll get any more of her now.   Season 1 threads <br>Full of epic meme<br> Season 2 threads <br>Full of whining<br><br>Whoever win, I lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  <br>Don't worry its confirmed that she's the support cast for NG, means she gets a role on NG suffering.</br>  <br> A-1 is interested in popular characters, not characters who don't even rank in the elections. <br>All the voice giveaways and cameos prove you wrong. <br>It's also hilarious how conveniently you ignored the fact that Chieri is one of the most popular idols and gets literally nothing out of the show.<br><br><br>I can understand complaining about Chieri, Kanako or Rika not getting anything from the anime, but I completely disagree when they put Miria there. She's supposed to be embodiment of innocence, a characterization that didn't leave Scamco much room for expanding her character and thus resulting in her being the least popular of the CP members. And yet here we see A-1 making use of it. We see her to be pretty much the only one not freaking out because of a ghost, we see her carefree and joyful at almost all times, we found out she understands chuunispeak too. I know this isn't much compared to some other CP members, but it's something and definitely proves that A-1 can create something out of nothing. <br><br>I really don't think we should worry too much like the meme spouting "HURR A-1 HATES LOLIS" faggot. There's still time and plenty of episodes to go and whining won't change anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>producer<br>more like<br>proloser</br></br></br>  <br><br>LL (possibly with Ranko) has a lot of potential for telling a story about splitting the group, Scamco can't fuck up and not tell it.</br></br>  <br> A-1 HATES LOLIS <br>That's actually true.</br></br>  <br>I want to suffer with her.</br>  <br> the only one not freaking out because of a ghost <br><br> "Boss, we forgot to animate that girl, what do we now?" <br> "Leave it how it is, nobody cares" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Senkawa story arc when? Even Kotori got a song in the original idolmaster.</br>    <br>You don't know pain.<br><br>The thing about Rika though is that she's an established character of this game. While, yes people won't necessarily vote for her, she won't be forgotten. <br><br>She's one of the first idols and is pretty easy to like. Yes, she probably isn't too many people's favorite, but she is still liked.<br><br>The problem is just that she doesn't have a niche to go with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I honestly think we should chill and leave it to A-1, the second cour is great so far <br>A boring introduction episode in which nothing really happens and a cheap rehash of episode 18 of 2011 isn't great. The best part of the show is still episodes 1-4, it all went to shit after that.</br></br>   "Shimamura Uzuki, It seems that your performances as of late have been very subpar." <br> "Y-Yes, but.... I'll keep doing my best from now on!" <br> "You'll do your best from now on? So are you saying that up until now, you haven't been taking things seriously?" <br> "N-No! I'm taking things very seriously. From the very beginning I was already giving my all and doing my best!" <br> "So you doing your best and giving your all gives these subpar results then?" <br> "....." <br> "Speak up Shimamura Uzuki" <br> "G-ganbarimasu..." <br> "You'll keep doing your best? Then I'd like to ask you, what results have your best given you by far?" <br> "I know, but.....ga....ganbarimasu, so...." <br> ".....This is your limit. Shimamura Uzuki." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, she makes a great antagonist to TakeP<br><br>Though mainly thanks to being doujin bait</br></br></br>  <br>If Mio got a girlfriend like Riina got shafted with the Catgirl, would that make her more popular?<br><br>Quick, somebody put Mio in a room with Ranko and a lot of vampire dildos.</br></br></br>  <br> Rika <br> extremely unpopular <br><br>?</br></br></br></br>  <br>With kisses.</br>  <br> Daijobu <br>Time for vitamins.</br></br>  <br> Provitamins <br><br>Fixed that for you.</br></br></br>  <br>She is.</br>  <br>I hope they don't fuck up and maker her simply evil, I want her to be doing what she's doing because she thinks this is the best for the 346. I've hopes, last episode with Kaede kinda showed that, she didn't force Kade to give up on her smaller event with the fans.</br>  <br><br>USAMIN USAMIN<br>SCOPOLAMINE</br></br></br>  <br>Is there a translation for this doujin? I can only find the chinese one.</br>  <br>There's a Korean one I think.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>She will have a slight depression and cry a little from the pressure then TakeP will comfort her  and add her to his cake harem. </br>  <br>She survived 2 WW, she'll be fine.</br>  <br>Just ganbarimasu harder.</br>  <br> her projects fails <br> because of reasons her new unit/idols don't work well <br> TakeP saves the day with his units <br> mishiro will understand the power of egao or something <br>Book it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Post pure, cute idols?  <br>Sasuga top cake; She knows the age of the bottom cake. But I still love them both.</br>    Honestly speaking, I highly doubt that Mishiro is evil. She isn't a mustache twirling saturday morning cartoon villain llike Kuroi.<br><br>She's a tad spartan in her methods, but she is thinking for the good of the company. They'll probably win her over. Power of Egaos and all that.</br></br>  <br>It never occurred to me that this is how Kaede's hair would actually look.</br>  <br>How do you find a beetle in a beach?</br>  <br><br>Remove Rika and you got yourself an amazing picture.</br></br>  which idol would you blaze it with  <br> I highly doubt that Mishiro is evil. <br><br>I AM EVIL. STOP LAUGHING!</br></br></br>  <br>I had the weirdest dream:<br>-It's the IdolFest at the grandest stage of em all<br>-Uzuki gets tricked to get to a different venue (as a subtle jab of being fired)<br>-TakeP finds out, hoes EGAO mode and jumps out a window to try and find her<br>-Uzuki has lost her spirit and accidentally wanders into the red light district while it rains, soiling her costume<br>-Then an AV actor, who was one of TakeP's idols that left him, sees Uzuki and decides to help her<br>-Listens to Uzuki's story and successfully gives her gamabrimasu back<br>-TakeP arrives and further reaffirms Uzuki's importance<br>-With the help of AV-san's tailor friends, Jamal-kun, and some yakuza, they make a mad dash to the venue on a monster drunk with limos as escorts<br>-makes the grandest entrance all Cinderella at the ball</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kanna</br>  So why is it that Hunters need Hunters Licenses to Hunt things?  fuck you op, this is now a pitou thread.      <br>They don't need a license to hunt things. Reread the Hunter exam arc. They explain the benefits that come with the license.</br>    The license is needed for things like access to restricted areas and diplomatic immunity  <br><br>They don't, it's just that with a license they get many benefits.</br></br>  <br>All Hunters Hunt Hunts.</br>      Pitou a shit  <br>Cause then they'd be poacherxpoacher.</br>  <br>you're a shit</br>      <br>Worst royal guard<br>Worst cat<br>Killed best man<br>Pitou a SHIT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Quit trying to beat a dead horse. They're all great except Pouf and that blonde faglord from the final anime arc.<br><br>Doesn't seem like she'd be soft at all.</br></br></br>  Pitou a shit  <br> worst royal guard <br>objectively false<br> worst cat <br>the one and only best cat in hxh<br> killed best man <br>she didn't kill hisoka</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As cancerous as Killuafags.<br><br>Nobody would even give a shit about Pitou if it weren't conventionally attractive because it's a one dimensional trash character.</br></br></br>  <br>Considering what it takes to even become a hunter, diplomatic immunity seems kinda redundant<br>You can take on a small army, and you're gonna take a full month of your life to get a stamp that says "don't arrest me"?</br></br>  Jesus christ this thread needs cleansing.  <br>Cheadle &gt; Pitou</br>  <br> hating pitou and killua <br>why even read/watch hxh?</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but that's likely the very reason he hates them both.</br>  <br>What are you on about? The average hunter and nen users don't hold a candle compared to everyone we've seen in the series. You see the shumps that show to vote in the election arc that Hisoka rated under 20? That's your average nen user. Are you seriously implying the rich and powerful don't have at least one body guard that's on Hisoka's level? You're also forgetting the most powerful human alive headed the organization for a long time, so the average chump would definitely be interested in the prospect of learning and getting aid from some one like that.</br>  I need to see that pitou doujin after every pitou thread, you know the one    <br>Yeah but unless you're really strong, you shouldn't be taking the exam to begin with, due to fuckers like Hisoka fucking around and killing every undermench in the first stage</br>  <br>not for its worst characters that's for sure</br>  <br>leorio isn't very strong but still made it past the exam.</br>  <br>Due to teaming up with his OP buddies, though</br>  <br>Friendly reminder that Leorio was physically stronger than Kurapika and Gon.</br>    <br>maybe at the beginning he was stronger than gon, but not sure how you think he was stronger than a famous assassin.</br>  Why are people spamming that shitty cat<br>She wasn't even that much of a character to begin with</br>  <br>I never said he was stronger than an assassin.</br>  <br>aww fuck I read killua instead of kurapika, my bad.</br>  <br>Kurapika's not a famous assassin, though<br>Kurapika's not a famous anything<br>Or, he probably is at this point, what with having joined up with the mob</br></br></br>  <br>the only other girl better than her in the show was pic related and she doesn't have much fan art.</br>  <br> she </br>  <br>Kite, Senritsu, Paku, Cheadle, and Palm are all better than that one-note antagonist.</br>  I don't like she-pitou, but I guess most of the show's male fanbase is somehow straight?  <br>didn't know kite was a girl.</br>  <br> people <br>Person<br><br><br>Seriously guy just fuck off to /c/ or some shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is now.</br>  <br> I didn't read it </br>  <br><br>that bitch ant wishes she was kite.</br></br>  <br>best girl, in fact.</br>  <br> was a boy <br> is a girl </br></br>  <br>Pitou is female (probably).<br>Most of Japan acknowledges this.</br></br>  <br>Most of Japan reads Hunter x Hunter?</br>  <br>Yes. Even their pets.</br>  <br>Thats a good question<br><br><br>If pitou like her because of any personality trait its fine.<br>Its the opposite of that conman in monogatari series, where people had him for a good reason since he lies and steals from children.<br>The difference is that he is not some animal but knows its wrong to steal from people, let alone children, yet still does it. he ruined the entire fucking show.<br><br><br>Pitou is at most anoying, but if its a girl she is cute true, her personality quirks are cute, but then her personality is less that of the other royal guards due to her being unable to have any opinion other then "defend the king"<br><br><br>I respect people who like pitou though more then I respect banana butt boy who defends his homo boyfriend who tricks children because he was bored.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YOU FOOL! YOU WILL SUMMON BUTT BOY!</br>  <br>I've never heard of this meme, who's this guy?</br>  <br>A yaoi fanguy who defends a conman and liar who dresses like a tranny with extra makeup. The L ron hubbard scientology thing is there due he believes the conman and liar when he narrates a story, which would be equal to believing L ron hubbard. <br><br>And thats after you know what L ron hubbard, who was also a conman, has done towards hundreds of people personaly. Only fools and homosexuals (hence the sailor outfit) would believe his word.</br></br></br>  <br>He also likes to say that anyone who disagree with him is "karen chan" another girl who was tricked by him when she tried confronting him about stealing from those children. Thank fucking god he is dead.</br>  <br>Neither was Kite, but it doesn't stop people from crying about him.</br>  <br>By him I mean the conman, the anon on /a/ just is a fanboy. Think of it like those girls who defend the twillight saga main characters.</br>  <br>He never developed in any significant way because he never interacted with humans in a normal way.</br>  Anyone else pissed that we will never know any of Kite's clown roulette weapons? All we know is the gun, the scythe, and the reviving ass paddle  <br>They don't need it, it just helps hunters by giving them advantages such as read the fucking hunter exam arc faggot.</br>  <br>Interesting thought, I wonder how the other royal guard interacted. <br><br><br>I still dont understand why they could resurrect palm but not kite?<br>Since they have small nuclear warheads, they must have airplanes aswell, so they could just drop one of those poison nuclear bombs on top of the building anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we'll get some sort of backstory manga for him, too</br>  <br>Palm didn't die immediately so Pitou could bring her back<br><br>Kite was decapitated.</br></br></br>  <br>I think togashi did it to be unpredictable in this case, like the royal guards deaths.<br><br><br>We did get to see 1 royal guard fight that was good, then we got to see some pitou fighting, albeit short.<br><br><br>But we just saw running around with the moth guy, not really fighting. I expected something more from him.<br><br><br>The king with his nen powers should be able to heal the poison in his body if he could heal his other limbs in my opinion, but the story would not be as good in some peoples opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Regenerating a limb is one thing, beating poison is quite another</br>  <br>I'm still pissed about kite dying<br> genuinely nicest person in the entire series gets fucked by a cat's curiosity </br></br>  Killuafags assemble! This is now a Killua thread!  <br>Pretty sure that would have killed all the Best Koreans standing next to the palace.</br>  <br>Palm was put into of of those cocoons to be turned into an ant.</br>  <br>I am.<br>One of the most interesting powers in the series to me.</br></br>  Top 5 males:<br>Top 5 females:</br>  <br>Meruem, Leorio, Hisoka, Phinks, Kurapika<br>Komugi, Cheadle, Pitou, Paku, Biscuit</br></br>  Started watching the first season on netflix, im on the part where they try to rescue killua<br>What am i in for?</br>  <br>Gon, Pika, Leorio, Ging, Hisoka<br>Bisky, Paku, Kite, Canary, Cheadle</br></br>  <br>Gon, Kite, Kurapika, Leorio, Netero<br>Senritsu, Palm, Cheadle, Biscuit, Komugi</br></br>  <br>Gon, Kurapika, Kite, Leorio, Hisoka<br>Senritsu, Pakunoda, Biscuit, Cheadle, Machi</br></br>  <br> Pitou is at most anoying, but if its a girl she is cute true, her personality quirks are cute, but then her personality is less that of the other royal guards due to her being unable to have any opinion other then "defend the king" <br>what a gross understatement. If anyone actually thinks that Pitou somehow has less personality than YOUPI then I'd suggest that you immediate seek medical attention because you probably have brain damage.<br><br>Why on earth would you think Pitou is incapable of any opinion other than "defend the king"? Just because she didn't try to control his like like her faggot brother, does that mean Pitou is devoid of free thought? That'd be objectively wrong as we've been exposed to Pitou's personal thoughts on the matter multiple times. She actually LOVES Meruem and wants him to be happy, of course she's not going to arbitrarily question her king. There was absolutely no reason to. Does that make for a more exciting character? Of course not, Pitou is definitely relatively static in comparison to someone like Pouf, but Pitou isn't lacking character nearly as much as some people around here prefer to think.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If anyone actually thinks that Pitou somehow has less personality than YOUPI <br>stopped reading there</br></br>  <br><br>trying to argue that a turd is less shitty than dung<br><br>just give up they both suck</br></br></br></br>  <br> If anyone actually thinks that Pitou somehow has less personality than YOUPI <br>Is this a joke? Youpi got the most development of the guards and developed an actual sense of self separate to his role as royal guard, the other two just care about muh Meruem.</br></br>  <br>Gon &gt; your Waifu</br>  <br>Gon girl<br><br>someone make an edit for me I'm razy</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he has more personality, you dumb fuck. Youpi literally developed from a 0 to a 1.</br>  <br>And that 1 alone gives him far more personality than Pitou, stop being a blind waifufag.</br>  <br>You're a fucking idiot, anon. Pitou has and had more personality traits than Youpi ever did. If I'm to be labelled a "waifufag" because I'm actually capable of intelligent thought then I'll gladly accept that burden, because apparently someone around here needs to.</br>  Is that cat thing a boy or a girl?  <br><br>Girl.</br></br>  <br>It's a thing.</br>  <br>Yeah, i think that scene where Meruem asks all of them what is name is tells us a lot about all of them. Pouf believes the only names that suits him is "the king", because that's what Meruem is to him. For Youpi, he admits it's beyond his understanding. But Pitou says what matters most is how he feels about it.<br>They all have a different point of view on Meruem even if they share the same unconditional love, they're all interesting characters even if Pitou is more static than the other two. Static doesn't mean one-dimensional.<br>See pic related, Pitou is clearly capable of critical thought when doing what Meruem asked.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, sure ant.</br>  <br>Canonically neither.</br>  <br>We've been discussing it for a decade and no one has figured it out yet.</br>  <br>Nice headcanon</br>  <br>Show me where Pitou was stated to be a boy or girl, anon</br>  Reminder that Pouf killed Pitou  <br>Hunters aren't criminals. Not unless they choose to be.</br>  <br>ambiguity in the narrative isn't deconfirmation, anon.<br>Pitou is observably female.</br></br>  <br>This, and so is Alluka and Kalluto</br>  new chapter when?  <br/>  <br>alluka and kalluto are both prepubescent children and lack any sexual characteristics, I don't know what you're on about</br>  <br>Are we really going to do this every fucking time?<br>Everyone has their opinions set in stone by now so it's beyond a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>nobody asked what pitou's sex was</br>  Why do threads always turn out like this each time Pitou is mentionned?  <br>Because otherwise everyone would go around killing everything and all animals would die</br>  <br>They're the same.</br>  <br> disliking Pouf <br> disliking Pariston </br></br>  <br>you're right, anon. pitou is totally and accurately a young woman</br>  <br>More like team mom</br>  <br>No matter how I think about that, it's wrong.

I liked the cat antics though.</br>  <br> she </br>  The best RG was Pufu , he had the deepest personality .  <br> implying she wouldn't just kill herself for failing him </br>  <br>Phinks, the greatest founding member.</br>  <br>Best RG was Pitou and you know it deep inside you, stop lying to yourself you little cunt.</br>  <br>Paku is dead anon</br>  <br>Why isn't there a RG edit of that picture yet?</br>  <br>Shizuku is a specialist!</br>  <br><br>I remember these memes.</br></br>  <br>Only best at being pounded.</br>  <br>better times</br>    <br>Chrollo obviously<br>Feitan, his pain packer is cool as shit<br>Nobunaga, best bro<br>Shalnark the second brains of the troupe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS!!!!!</br>  <br>All of them were disgusting furries and I'm glad the new antagonist is Patrick Bateman</br>  Mods should ban all pito/killuafags , it's the only way .  <br> They have approximately the same amount of traits <br>How on earth can you call someone else delusional after spouting total crap like that? Pitou had always expressed more unique traits than Youpi, no matter how you spin it. I don't care if you think Pitou is a bad character or not, and I'm certainly not sitting here saying that Pitou is the most colorful character in the manga, but everything else you're saying is so wrong that I'm having a hard time determining whether you're legitimately mentally inept or if you're that concerned with playing contrarian just because of some "waifufags" boogeyman.</br></br>  <br>It goes both ways and also sideways.</br>  <br>It's all a big scam to control nen users.<br><br>They hand out licenses with big perks and threaten to take them away if hunters break the rules by killing each other or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> Hating on furries </br>  <br>Did Pariston in the Election arc count as an antagonist? I enjoyed him, but I'm hoping Togashi does something interesting with Bateman because GI and CA's were meh to me.  Pouf was a magnificent cunt though </br>  <br>This is autism</br>  <br> Pouf <br> a cunt <br>He just tried to protect his king .</br></br></br>  <br>No, he really didn't</br>  <br>His breakdowns were some of the best parts of the entire series.<br><br>He tried to protect his king, not Meruem as a person. He was aware of that fact.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he did , pito and yupi was just two fools who could just say "yes my king" , pufu had a real personality , and he knew that sometimes you need to lie for the king's sake .</br>  <br>But he did, that's why he was the best guard.</br>  <br> pito and yupi was just two fools who could just say "yes my king" </br>  <br>This. Kite chapters were literally the worst and most boring HxH chapters. The only good thing about him was the impact he had on Gon.</br>  <br>0/10</br>    <br>Nobody will forget Uvo anon .</br>  <br>what the fuck</br>  <br><br><br>He didn't. He was doing everything he can to subvert Meruem's life and try to mold him into his own idea of what a king should be.</br></br></br>  <br> subvert Meruem's life and try to mold him into his own idea of what a king should be <br>So yeah, he tried to protect his king.</br></br>  <br>None of that even remotely resembled protection. Sabotage is not an act of love. If Pufu really thought he was "protecting" his king then he must've made up a new definition for the word.</br>  <br>A royal guard's duty is to protect the King, not nurture the King's emotional growth.</br>  <br> Sabotage is not an act of love. <br>Except it was in this case, even Meruem acknowledged it.</br></br>  <br>Protect and serve. His "remove komug" crusade was directly compromising of his purpose.</br>  <br>Based ubo</br>  <br>He also was aware of that fact, that's why he was ready to take his life after killing her.<br>He wanted Meruem to be just that, the King, not a person. This is reflected when he asks for his name and Pouf answers him that he should only call himself that, and when he's afraid that he might be feeling remorse.</br></br>  <br>Literally furryshit.</br>  <br>sabotaging your loved one's poor life decision is definitely an act of love</br>  <br> poor life decision <br>Reminder that Meruem would never have won against Netero if he didn't meet Komugi</br></br>  <br>It's kind of like if your daughter or sister fell in love with a black guy so you ruin their relationship.</br>  <br>Netero could literally deal no damage to the king, he would have won anyway.</br>  <br>But that's wrong, Meruem was starting to feel pain. It would have taken a while but Netero would eventually kill him.</br>  <br>He felt no pain at all<br>Netero's ultimate move scratched him slightly.<br>Meruem was just too powerful.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> He felt no pain at all <br>He started to feel pain the moment before he took Netero's leg. He was getting slightly damaged from each blow.</br></br>  <br>Not in a bad way, it's just to keep them apart because he's, you know, black.</br>  <br>I don't remember he mentioning that at all.<br>Besides, zero hand took all of Netero's nen and it still didn't do shit.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Would you have redirected Pouf to /pol/ as well?</br>  <br>You should reread it then.</br>  <br>Except Meruem didn't make poor life decisions.</br>  <br>Pouf disagreed</br>  <br>Pouf's a poof</br>  <br>They don't. It just makes things easier, tbh if your like the Spiders strong you can do anything anyway. its like having a Drivers liscence, you can still drive a car without one. but comes with complications</br>  <br>Pouf wouldn't discriminate on what humans to eat based on skin colour.</br>  <br>You're missing the point. It's that he tried t protect the person he loves in his own twisted way.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>you dont, it just makes jobs and tasks easier to do.</br>  <br>Well at least you admit being racist is twisted.</br>  <br>Are you daft? It boils down to the fact that ruining the life of someone you supposedly love due to your own preconceptions is the mark of an inherently awful person.</br>  <br> ruining their life <br>That depends on whether you're right or not, which you inherently must think you are since they're your beliefs in the first place</br></br>  <br> projecting human values onto a literal bug </br>  <br>but the ants themselves even acknowledge Pouf as morally wrong. In fact there's no reason to believe that these values would be any different from how we perceive them.</br>    <br> but the ants themselves even acknowledge Pouf as morally wrong <br>This literally never happened. No one but Pitou and Yupi knew or cared about his goals, and Yupi even agreed with him.</br></br>  <br>though to be fair, pouf himself knew that he was being a total cockhead</br>  <br>Time to post more Bisky.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's another point proving that Pouf isn't inherently a bad person. He only saw it as a necessary evil and was ready to pay the price for it.</br>  <br> calls pitou one-note <br> cites senritsu as a better alternative <br>what a joke</br></br></br>  Do you think Kite died because he lost an arm or because he was too distracted by the Pitoubutt?  <br>a deadly ass for sure</br>  <br>I don't think Kite gives a damn about ants or asses.</br>  <br>Are you saying he's asexual?</br>  <br>I wouldn't be too surprised if he was.</br>  <br>How would Kite react if he walked in on this?</br>  <br>he'd steal mushroom hat's mushroom hat</br>  <br> had his head between Pitou's thighs <br>That's pretty sexual</br></br>  <br>are they gay?</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Faggots <br>Gon -&gt; Killua<br>Killua -&gt; Illumi<br>Ging -&gt; Pariston<br>Pariston -&gt; Ging &amp; Netero<br>Phinks -&gt; Danchou<br>Uvogin -&gt; Shalnark<br>Shalnark -&gt; Uvogin</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Feitan -&gt; Phinks<br>Nobunaga -&gt; Danchou</br></br>  <br>I'd be willing to die 10 times over just to look at Pitou's ass up close, nevermind skinship</br>  <br>Don't bully Kite's hat</br>   Like cats <br> Like white hair <br> Like the idea behind Terpsichora <br>Yet for some reason I feel nothing special about Pitou, I don't get it<br>I think it might be because of all the Pitoufags ruining her</br></br></br></br>  The end of the Chimera Ant arc was so fucking disappointing.<br><br>The only redeeming things were Netero's fight/sacrifice and Gon's complete 180* attitude change during the castle intrusion along with Pitou's death.</br></br>  <br> Terpsichora <br>Google gives me a manga that looks like it was written in the 1600s and Pitou's hunterpedia page<br>What the fuck is it?<br>Is it the doll joints?</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you let other people ruin a character for you then you might be autistic</br>  <br>She uses a thing to take control of her body, ie she becomes the puppet. Makes her move faster etc.<br><br><br>Don't even try to pretend that people haven't ruined Killua with all the homo bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually believed those fags that said Killua was gay until I actually got into the series myself.</br>  <br>Oh, that thing<br>I don't remember any of the skill names<br><br> Also Killua is totally homo, that doesn't ruin him </br></br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br>if pitoufags ever became a single iota as bothersome as those killuafags then maybe I couldn't judge, but pitoufags seem too few and far between to be comparable for now. Honestly it's all the gender shitposting baggage that annoys me most but I don't think you can blame that on just pitoufags.</br>  <br>This is why you don't dump your Charisma stat</br>  <br>It's partly that, but it's more the avatar-faging that gets to me I think</br>  <br>Why is there so little HxH /ss/? It's weird considering the mountains of regular shota porn the series get.</br>  <br>When the shota is the focus, /ss/ is less interesting, I guess<br>I dunno, I don't like /ss/ at all</br></br>  <br>are you sure you know what avatarfagging is? I don't think I'm seeing it.</br>  Holy shit i didn't know there was a dub for the old version<br> It's really bad <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-Q<wbr>SLal-Pyw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  How can one man be so based?  <br>Best manipulator  after Shalnark </br>  <br>You must have forgotten that Illumi exists, allow me to remind about the best manipulator.</br>  <br><br>Literally what's the difference between Illumis and Shalnarks power?<br><br>Shalnark even has auto pilot</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why Manipulator is the shittiest Nen alignment, there's hardly any variety in their powers.  Transmuter &gt; Conjurer &gt; Emitter &gt; Enhancer &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Manipulator <br> Specialist is a wild card </br></br>  <br>I think the difference is that Shalnark can only control one person at a time but give him more complex orders, and Illumi can also morph faces.</br>  <br><br>Seriously though, Is one needle all it takes to win a match?<br><br>A manipulator and Melereon would be deadly as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>You've got it all wrong anon.<br>Enhancer &gt; Conjurer &gt; Manipulator = Emitter &gt; Specialist &gt; Trashmuter</br></br>  <br> Morel <br> Shoot <br> Kalluto <br> Pouf <br> no variety <br><br>I'm not sure it works on nen users, we've only seen them use it on mafia members and civilians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not sure it works on nen users <br>It probably does, How else would Illumi control Alluka? Also didn't he use it on a butler during that car scene with Killua and Alluka</br></br>  <br>Alluka isn't a nen user, and he wants to control Killua to also control Alluka.<br> a butler during that car scene <br>I really don't remember that, do you mean the car crash?</br></br></br>  Does qt 3dpd cosplay Pitou count?  <br> Alluka isn't a nen user <br>Well Nanika is.<br> I really don't remember that, do you mean the car crash? <br>No, When Killua and Alluka was in the car and the driver had a needle in him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Garbage plot device so that the author can force his edgy shit like people killing people in the exam</br>    <br> Nanika is <br>We really don't know, DC powers might have nothing to do with Nen.<br> When Killua and Alluka was in the car and the driver had a needle in him <br>Oh yeah, you're right, i just reread that scene. Maybe he just killed/defeated him beforehand? He also did the same with one of the hunters that were sent after him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We really don't know, DC powers might have nothing to do with Nen. <br>Well clearly the Ants were capable of learning Nen<br> Oh yeah, you're right, i just reread that scene. Maybe he just killed/defeated him beforehand? He also did the same with one of the hunters that were sent after him. <br>Maybe he could control Nen users, but it would take more than one needle? Like the stronger the enemy is, the more needles Illumi has to use?</br></br></br></br>  <br> killing people is edgy <br><br>Ehh maybe, kind of.<br><br>Honestly the card thing hasn't been used as a plot device other than for Gon giving the card back to Ging, and I'm fine with that. <br>I was worried when the cards were introduced and it was stated that you can only have one card and never replace it (which I think is complete bs and retarded), because I thought the story would go in a direction where someone would lose their card and have to get it back, but I'm glad the mangaka had the common sense not to do something so stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> qt <br> 3DPD <br>Choose one.</br></br></br>  <br> the Ants were capable of learning Nen <br>Wasn't that because of the introduction of humans into their gene pool?</br></br>  <br>Well Youpi knew nen and he was made entirely by Magical Beasts  which is theorized to come from DC </br>  <br>Yes it was. <br><br>What would you classify Nanika's power coming from (besides nen). I can't really think of anything other than generic "magic", but come on nen is more or less magic.</br></br></br>  Killua is cute!   that bonus stage after 1999's hunter exams third phase <br> gon and illumi fights after exam <br> way more hanzo humor <br> longer dodgeball fight with netero <br> that qt grill trying to kill killua <br><br>Holy shit why did 2011 cut out so much shit?? I loved it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh right, you have a point. Well considering the nature of nen and the fact that some magical beasts have been shown to be as intelligent as humans, maybe they can learn it too i guess.<br><br>We'll know when we get new chapters.  Never. </br></br></br>  <br>Those were all filler. The battleship/treasure hunt was fucking great though. <br>Also i don't know why they cut out the sushi part, that was canon.</br></br>  <br>Oh shit really? Fuck. Yeah, that battleship/treasure hunt did have that Togashi feel to it.</br>  I never do these posts, but best girl is   Cluck    The gays who are homo for little boys and the autists that gallantly defend Pitou's gender are a stain on this series.

Though the Election arc was okay. Illumi returning is always nice and the election bits were interesting. Too bad Alluka's introduction was shitty.</br>    <br>Well then show us when Gon gave a fuck about Killua then</br>  Will Gon use that fishing rod again now that he has met Ging and lost his nen?  <br>Cats &gt; dogs</br>  Reminder that killua is a shit brother.  <br>Except in this case where the dog is better than the cat.</br>  <br> shit brother <br> shit friend <br>Is Killua the physical embodiment of shit?</br></br></br>  <br>wait it#s completly gone now?<br>I thought it got restored back when he got healed.</br></br>  <br>You need to read the manga anon.</br>  who has the image of Togashi's art compared to others. that's always fun.  <br> willing to sell out his family <br> forgot about alluka all this time <br> shat on his "most precious" friend's face <br> left his new friends for his demon sibling </br></br></br></br>  Isn't he supposed to be a major character or something?  <br> treated saving gon as a burden, ie "cleaning up his mess" <br> did it mainly to hold it over gon <br> needs a little girl to correct his behavior and call him out on his shit <br> doesn't act like a civilized human being unless he gets his shit pushed in by a mermaid </br></br></br></br>  <br> Kurapika and Leorio finally MCs again <br> with fucking Ging on top of that <br>The more i think about it the more the hiatus hurts</br></br></br>  <br>Leorio was never a MC.</br>    <br>Literally all the time, Killua however has never once responded to it, and always tells him to stop or shut up. In other words go read the manga.</br>    <br>Gon wasn't even in that scene.</br>  <br>No indication that he's staring at Gon<br><br>Gon isn't there</br></br></br>  <br>Are the animators Killuafags? Did they not realize him acting like a rude unfriendly cunt sometimes was intentional?</br>  <br>They are, hell I wonder if they erased Kite and Kon because they thought that Killua should be the most important person to Gon.<br><br>Which causes them to completely miss the point.</br></br></br>  <br> a little girl </br>  <br>I still think Pitou is more likeable. Cheadle has some bad moments, like when she was acting like a cunt to Ging and wasn't grateful he gave her some advice.</br>  <br>But anon , gin is literally a cunt .</br>  <br> Pitou is more likeable <br> Cheadle has some bad moments <br>Because a literal ant who<br> killed and mutilated the MC's mentor <br> is the cause of the MC's mental breakdown <br> planned on isolating and killing the MC all along <br>is way more likeable than a character who was ungrateful to a smelly cunt?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> literal newborn animal killing someone out of curiosity <br> grown adult throwing a bitch fit over being a fucking idiot and having to be spoonfed by a smelly hobo <br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit taste, kill yourself.</br>  <br>Not that anon but<br>Pitou was a part of an invasive species.<br>Chimera Ants aren't human, there is no justification for their actions.<br><br>They did not kill because they had to but rather because they wanted to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Chimera Ants aren't human <br>The Chimera Ant Arc chimera ants are</br></br>  <br> They did not kill because they had to but rather because they wanted to. <br>Did you miss the entire point of the arc?</br></br>  <br>They aren't.<br><br><br>Mereum =/ The rest of the Chimera Ants. He was not the rule but rather the exception. Pitou killed to test it's own strength and only acted on instinct to protect the king. Pitou itself never cared about anything else.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They aren't <br>They are, that's the whole point of the arc.</br></br>  <br>You forgot Colt and Koala.<br>Also, Pitou eventually wanted to kill Gon because she judged he could have been a threat to Meruem, not just because she wanted to. These are pretty much innate instincts.</br></br>  <br>Pitou was such a waste of a character.</br>  <br>I was naively hoping Pitou would end up becoming a side character.</br>  <br> never lived long enough to come to care about komugi as a person and bond with her <br> only cared about meruem and the influence komugi had on him </br></br>  <br>I think that's part of why it was so tragic, all of the ants had so much more room for change. They all olny were 2 months old at most.</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be more tragic to kill them off after they explored their humanity to its fullest extent?</br>  <br>She was a waste alright.</br>  <br>They aren't only some of them were but the vast majority of them including Pitou weren't<br><br><br>Which falls under<br> and only acted on instinct to protect the king. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2 months old and already conquered an entire country, and well on their way to conquering the world. <br><br>Their king also killed what used to be the STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD. In his youth  <br><br>Blame them for evolving too fast. It's survival of the fittest, not survival of the strongest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think if for exemple Meruem properly developed as a person and wasn't only starting to explore his humanity, his death wouldn't have been as sad. It really did feel like a waste.<br>I guess it's arguable though.</br></br>  <br> she </br>  Why do you people care about Kite so much?<br>His appearances were so short I couldn't feel anything for him.</br>  <br>I dunno, to me it would have been more sad if they all became their own people with goals and desires separate from their programming.</br>  <br>Same for me , i don't care about this character .</br>  <br>He's the embodiment of what a hunter should be, it's not hard to see why people would like him.<br>Also he's the first character introduced so there's that.</br></br>  <br>Some people here aren't autists.</br>  <br>But Hunters are shit , Phantom troupe and Zoldycks are more entertaining and interesting.</br>  <br> cool, kind, serious, capable, intelligent, a level of maturity we've never seen in a character before, sexy </br>  <br>There are interesting and boring characters in each of the groups you mentionned.</br>    <br>He's the first character you meet in the manga that gives you an introduction to the world of HunterxHunter.</br>  <br>It's funny because Pito in spanish means penis.</br>  El lel   <br>that's not her name though.</br>  <br> her <br>who?</br></br>  Is illumi a good bro ?  <br>you know who :^)</br>  <br>Not really, he's a huge dick.<br><br>Even the good stuff he does for Killua is for selfish reasons, and he fucks him over in other ways.</br></br></br>  <br>He's way too selfless for the HxHverse.</br>  <br> know Pitou  <br> "girl" <br><br>you don't know Pitou enough</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off, this trash discussion finally had died</br></br>  <br>just because gon was raised by women doesn't mean he's a grill</br>  <br>you clearly don't know Pitou at all</br>  <br>you clearly don't know Pitou at all</br>   tfw you will never have a loli vampire as your eternal master   Thank god.  That would be beyond terrifying  <br>That scene gave me the biggest erection.</br>  I sometimes wonder why I bother living when fictional characters can have better lives than me.  Everyday I wake up before dawn and a single tear streams down my face as I realize I don't have to rush into my butler outfit, cook breakfast and greet my ojou-sama as she awakens.  The femdom must be exhilarating.  <br> you will never entrance your ojou-sama with tales of your service in Burma hunting for jewel thieves </br>  <br> you will never be the vampire loli </br>   tfw no Aoi femdom loli   <br> tfw you will never have a loli vampire forcing you to cum on yourself, licking it all up and force feed it back to you. </br>  I kept watching this shit series only for based vampire loli dancing in the OP  <br> tfw you will never have a loli vampire as your pet <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br>If I was a loli vampire, I'd be okay with being some anon's pet. At least for a little while.</br>     you will never be the eternal master of a loli vampire    Aoi Yuuki will never call you her dog   Genuinely curious female /a/non here: How does femdom have to be presented so it works as fanservice for you guys? I can only picture fangirls being the ones who enjoy watching male characters in a vulnerable state.  <br>I imagine is the same hypocrites that criticize landwhales that like shit like diabolik wife beaters and 50 shades of faggotry</br>  Just started Index a few days ago and I'm at episode 17. Does the series get any better because so far the entire thing has felt like a huge filler arc. Is Railgun worth watching if Index isn't doing it for me? <br><br>Also Index is such a fucking headache</br></br>  <br>NT9 was just a bad dream.</br>  <br>Ah you are THAT anon then?</br>  <br>Why not mane?</br>  If you want to get into Index you need to read the LNs. The anime and manga just don't do them justice. Too much shit cut or rushed, for example Angel Fall was butchered in the anime and skipped in the manga.<br><br>For Railgun, the anime is stuffed with SoL filler that is mostly about eating cake or crying over stupid shit like "my roommate is moving out". The manga is far better but if you like that kind of SoL shit then you might as well go for it. There are also two side story novels for Railgun.</br></br>  <br>all the time</br>  He took the world's crime rates down by 70%, so how the fuck was he evil?<br><br>His good deeds heavily outweighed his evil ones, that's like saying you're evil because you stole a bag of chips but then went on to create "The Next Big Thing" and become a billionaire.</br></br>  <br>Because people weigh things based on emotions rather than statistics.</br>  <br>It's pretty easy to lower crime rates if you remove enough people from the planet, you fucking sperg.</br>  <br>  that's like saying you're evil because you stole a bag of chips but then went on to create "The Next Big Thing" and become a billionaire. <br>Going by Light reasoning,you should get killed for stealing a bags of chips so yes you are.</br></br>  <br>no, it's more like saying you're evil because you stole a bag of chips and then used it to kill reduce crime by killing people.</br>  <br>No you fucking dumbass, it takes more than just murdering thousands to lower crime rates. I he killed literally just innocent people, you think there would be a crime decrease?</br>  This thread again  <br>There would be less people to commit crimes against.</br>  <br>Evil people can do good things just like nice people can do bad things.</br>  <br>The problem with Death Note is that it portrays Light's actions as bad while operating under the logic that the Death Penalty works (kill enough criminals=less crimes)<br><br>Personally I'm for the Death Penalty but they could have gone for some nuance. Like what if that poor criminal Light convicted was wrongfully convicted. Or what if he was a poor black kid that din do nuffin.</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted to play god, not do good. If he just wanted to do good he wouldn't have manipulated others and killed innocents who got too close to the truth</br>  <br>What about characters like the one in your image who are neither and act purely out of self-preservation?</br>  <br>When you're young and your brain is yet to fully develop, you tend to think of things in absolutes. It's ok, you'll learn people are both good and evil when you grow up.</br>  <br>Yeah ok kid, You're saying there's a distinction between good and evil people. As if they're two separate breeds of dog.<br><br>Firstly anyone is capable of great good or great evil. Good and Evil entirely are subjective to the person who sees it, meaning their definition changes from person to person. <br><br>Only when there's a big enough force can that group label the definition of what Good and Evil is because they have the power to decide for others at that point *I.E* The Fucking Government.<br><br>Light having the death note made him above them because he had power even they didn't. He could slaughter anyone he wanted, thus was a god and thus was the Law.<br><br>Just because you don't agree with him, you still live by the rules of Good and Evil and how the bigger power controls their definitions. Light had that power, and could do as he pleased. He just got too cocky, but he wasn't wrong for doing what he did. But that's me, you think he's evil because you agree with the government and not with him and that's your own thoughts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP your logic problem is here:<br><br>You talk about lights murders as evil, rightly so.<br><br>But then you say:<br><br> that's like saying you're evil because you stole a bag of chips but then went on to create "The Next Big Thing"  <br><br>And you still use the word evil, for the bag of chips thing, which instead of showing an absurdity in the original situation, just creates a sense of absurdity for your situation alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The public eye views Kira as some kind of god.<br>Some fear him, it´s different from the death penalty.<br><br><br>Good or evil depends on perspective.<br>Also basicly <br><br><br>Faggot he said that people aren´t either good or evil.<br><br>"Good" and "Evil" depends on your own perspective not anyone elses. You might think Light was "good" because he had good intentions. But you can also say he was "evil" because of the way he tried to achieve his goal  (that would be the intelligent answer) .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Light is not evil, he was absolutely right in everything he did. That is true.<br><br>It's just that some people are too cowardly, too bespoken to their fucktarded sense of "morality" to admit that.</br></br></br>  <br>What this anon said. <br><br>What is justice is decided by whomever has the most power, authority and influence.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, that again is subjective and your own thoughts on how Light was "good" and how he was "evil". I'm sure Hitler thought what he did was "good" and millions thought it was "good" at the time as well as millions thought it was "evil".<br><br>Actions are neither good or evil, they just happen. We made those words and those constructs.</br></br></br>  I personally believe that Light was enjoying too much to dispense death. If he was a young detective who investigates on cold cases and punishes only those escaped punishment, I would find his methods again questionable, but I could understand that he minimally has a honor code and the try to do the good thing.<br>of course, this also mean not killing innocent and escape from those who chase him without killing them. Absolutely, if he is captured, he must accept responsibility.<br><br>Kira liked to keep the lives of others in his hands. The rest was just a pretext.</br></br></br>  <br>The ends do not justify the means. If they do, they you can enable all manor of evil in the name of pursuing good. With how the manga hinted at Light planning to create a perfect humanity, it was inevitable that humanity was going to be reduced to a few hundred thousand drooling sycophants who worshiped Kira as a god.</br>  <br>But crime would be dead. How is that wrong?<br><br>Nobody cares about Apple talking about what their next phone is, they want the results, they want the Iphone. So what you're saying is pointless, based on how you're saying it, we should care about the trip, rather than the destination.</br></br></br>  <br>The way "you get" something matters a lot.</br>  <br>I don't understand how the ends do not justify the means. If you're in a situation that will always have one thing being sacrificed for another then surely sacrificing the thing that is worth less is the most favourable outcome even if your own moral compass doesn't agree with it. <br><br>If you are in a scenario that forces you to choose whether you save 1 person or 2 people surely the better option is to sacrifice the 1 to save the 2. <br><br>It's a similar situation to what Light has here; with him having to choose to allow criminals to exist by sacrificing innocent people or to sacrifice criminals to save the innocent people. <br><br>He also killed a few innocent people for the sake of protection, but that's just self preservation and pretty much everyone has the evolutionary impulse to protect themselves from harm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  He was evil because he wanted to be a God.  <br> implying there is a god <br>Playing god is no different than being spiderman<br><br><br>No it doesn't. Results are absolute, only a fool would care how they were gotten because that only serves as a morality tester so you could feel better or worse about yourself based on your idea of what good and evil actions are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are Gods in the Death Note universe. He was evil because he wanted to get rid of crime to be worshipped through fear of getting killed. That's what's evil about it.</br>  <br>So edgy</br>  <br>What the fuck man I just said that it´s subjective what´s your problem.<br><br> Actions are neither good or evil, they just happen. <br>So what? Your actions are still used to judge you.<br><br><br>Exactly. A lot of people seem to be to retarded to understand this simple fact.<br><br><br><br>Hitler just wanted to create the perfect country for german people. Killing people opposed to him was his sacrifice.<br><br>Germany is exporting a lot of weapons nowadays. That´s not a bad thing, since it helps the economy.<br><br>I´m hungry but don´t have money to buy something? I`ll just steal it.<br><br>You see how retarded that logic is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that make every government ever evil because they prevent crimes through a system built upon fear?</br>  <br>He killed people = he is a murderer, an outlaw aswell</br>  <br> I´m hungry but don´t have money to buy something? I`ll just steal it <br><br>So steal it, you'd deny yourself food because of your fucked up morality of not wanting to be Evil? Are you fucking kidding me?<br><br>You are the retarded one if you believe that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't outright kill everyone who commits crimes. Light could be considered evil since he did it for personal gain rather than the greater good. That's my entire point.</br>  <br>Because his actions weren't spurred on by a sense of justice, charity, or good. It was all pride, and the desire to be a god.<br><br>It's like Breaking Bad; it becomes apparent that Walt isn't committing crime on behalf of his family, but does it to fulfill his sense of pride.<br><br>The difference is that Walt has the humility at the end to admit it was all for himself, and Light dies in a state of self-delusion aside from the moment of clarity where he sees his "pure" high schooler self and begins crying.<br><br>And that's ignoring the ethical argument entirely.<br>If you don't believe in objective morality, there can't be an effective argument against him.<br>Within objective morality, virtue ethics would state that he is evil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Killing everyone that commited crimes is not the solution sadly. It's just ignoring the problem.</br>  <br>But in everything that Light has been put in he has always started killing criminals on the basis that the criminal justice system is corrupt and broken and needs to be fixed. It was later on he was made into this "God" like figure because of society and the media; these people are what caused him to ultimately believe that his actions are justice and supported by the masses; the moment he started killing innocent people is when he went against his own principals and became something he would consider himself to be evil. I don't think he was completely evil or completely good, he just wanted change and became consumed by the taste of power.</br>  <br>Since the first episode he wanted to be a God. He told Ryuk about that when they first met. It's not like he became corrupted after killing, he was already deluded before being worshipped by the media.</br>  <br>You know why people are corrupted by power? Because the more power they have, the less they feel to have to answer for their actions.<br><br>And this destroy any good intention, because the power without rules leads to a gradual lack of common sense. no matter if the rules are personal, self-imposed or imposed by others, they serve as a reference.</br></br></br>  <br>Modern society isn´t build upon fear it´s build upon morality. People understand that you shouldn´t do bad things because if everybody did the world would go to shit.<br>If people are moral they don´t have to fear anything.<br>If they aren´t they should gtfo.<br><br><br>You are one autistic faggot are you?<br>The point is that just because I´m hungry stealing stops being bad.<br>Just because you don´t like niggas it´s not ok to kill them.<br><br>The ends don´t justify the means asshole.<br><br>Everything people do serves themself. So by your logic we can´t judge people and everything should be allowed.<br><br>Let´s go rape some woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  He could've at least taken out truly evil people or important people, just killing someone suspected of murder won't change the world.  <br>It creates a better world, taking out anyone who causes a problem to peace isn't wrong. It just makes you willing to do whatever it takes to get what you desired. <br><br>Light wanted a perfect world and to do that people must fucking die. Governments keep it's people safe by the same laws so wtf are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br> wtf <br>Fuck off.</br></br>    <br>I'd love to live in a world where my neighbor can file false charges and I get the death sentence immediately for it.</br>  <br>The ends do justify the means, <br><br>"It's timmy's surprise party, so nobody tell him we're planning it", by your logic the mother who said that line is evil right?<br><br>The ends are justified by the means, doing whatever it takes to get what you want is a human natural instinct, get your head out of your ass to fucking see that. You're morality is way too fucking strong you fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It creates a better world <br>It creates a dystopia.</br></br>  So I assume the people who agree with Light would love to live in an Orwellian dystopia. Being constantly controlled with fear doesn't matter as long as crime and war disappear amirite?  <br><br> If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear <br>I bet they want this.</br></br></br>  <br>If modern society is built upon morality then why do we have laws? If it's built upon the premise that one person wont do wrong to another then surely there is no need for a system that punishes being immoral because people should already have high morals. <br><br>Society is built upon a system of fear. I don't want to commit a crime because I fear being punished. I don't want to harm another person for the fear of being harmed myself. I don't want to hurt another person's feeling for the fear of the consequences. <br><br>Morality is completely based around the fear of doing something they consider wrong. Morality is subjective and is not a default human thought; it is learned through experiences.</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy shit this thread. Everyone wants to be a cool nihilist who thinks that violence will solve all the worlds problems because "the ends justify the means". I'm calling complete bull shit on this entire thing. Sure killing bad guys can kind of make the world a better place. In retrospect however he's actually the greatest evil. He's pretty much causing a genocide based on arbitrary things he considers bad. He just killed people who were murders. Were they murders with a cause just like him? WHO FUCKING KNOWS? Because the people he killed in the series didn't matter and didn't shine light on them what so ever. The entire anime was more about him going on a fucking power trip. It barely has anything to do with him being morally just. Saying he had any results because crime went down was because they were afraid of fucking dying. He only killed known criminals. So basically any syndicate that knew what they were doing and could cover up their tracks while hiding would have free reign. It wouldn't stop anyone, just make everyone more sneaky. Hell I think anything under ground would become more prolific because everyone would be afraid of doing anything and would create and even better job market for them. So it would almost seem counter intuitive.  <br><br>This thread is pretty much a copypasta and GURANTEED REPLIES rolled into one</br></br>  <br>People aren't pure evil or pure saints. Killing people that commited crimes is just ignoring the problems that led to them commiting crimes.<br>Say I stole some money from somebody. That would make Light kill me right ? But perhaps I stole that money because my child needed medicine urgently. Humans aren't good or evil, they're just humans. So If Light wants to get rid of "evil" good luck with that.</br></br>  <br>At least you're like the only person in this thread that has actually mentioned that what Light is doing is contradictory and that's the real moral debate here, not whether the ends justify the means and not whether it's moral or not.</br>  Light is a total retard so even if you're an edgy fatass who buys into his delusions it should be extremely obvious to anyone that his methods would never really curb crime.<br>It would only serve to make criminals that much better at hiding their identities.</br>  Edgy faggots everywhere  <br>True Kira is seen as a God but what he does- killing criminal is comparable to a death penalty.<br><br>Being seen as a God is merely the by product.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>People don´t commit crimes because they are evil.<br>There are a lot of reasons for commiting crimes.<br><br><br>see  and <br>People aren´t evil or good by nature. <br><br><br>Not telling Timmy about the party doesn´t have negative consequences though.<br>It doesn´t even apply to the "The ends do justify the means".<br><br>You know, sometimes it does. But only in some cases.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128666194#p128668489">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confucius says yes.</br>  <br>I was providing my own answer to the question, as the person I was replying to seemed to have a different answer. <br><br>I just don't understand how people can think that morality is something that humans have by default; I strongly believe that it is something that is learned through life experiences.</br></br></br>  Will Shaft ever animate nipples again?  Does it matter? Animators can't draw nipples for shit.  Shinobu and Hachikuji had an IPS baby?  WOHAH what's that from  <br>Dance in the vampire bund</br>  That chromatic aberration is fucking terrible.<br>I hope that scene is a POV from a shitty camera or something.</br>  <br> chromatic aberration <br>the what</br></br>  <br>Idiot</br>  <br>Look at the blue and red on the line work.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrom<wbr>atic_aberration</wbr></br></br>  <br>are we suer thi s wasn't stereoscopeic 2D</br>  <br>Well, that show aired only 5 years ago. JC Staff hasn't done nudity since the early 2000's but they're doing it for the Prison School BD's. So it's possible.</br>  <br> but they're doing it for the Prison School BD's <br>They most likely aren't. Imagine your stereotypical onsen scene with private parts obscured by steam in the TV version, and in the BDs there's just slightly less steam and still no nudity. The censorship in Prison School will just be slightly less severe.</br></br>  <br><br>Shaft actually drew nipples on Shinobu in the bath scene during certain angles.</br></br>  <br> They most likely aren't <br>It was confirmed that they are.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>I am cum.</br>  <br>I shall wait.

Google image search rarely helps me<br>I'm not trusting it to help anybody</br></br></br>  <br>No they didn't, faggot.</br>  <br><br>You're wrong though.</br></br>  <br><br>They drew skin nipples, not actual nipples. It was weird. Not sure if that counts for full nudity.</br></br>  <br><br>Well the scene wasn't designed to be sexual so I understand why they didn't draw actual nipples and a vag on her.</br></br>  <br>Well they can't draw vags in non-h shows. I guess they didn't want to draw actual nipples because of personal preference or the authors request or something.</br>  I guess I'm the only person alive who likes chromatic aberration.  <br>I'm glad you can take it without getting a massive headache</br>  <br>Those look shitty anyway</br>  <br><br>Not the same guy but I'm actually only turned off by motion blur in things.<br><br>In fact, I legit cannot tell the difference between 30 FPS and 60 FPS.<br><br>I don't even notice screen tearing with V-sync off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daiz.  <br>If I show you 30 fps and 60 fps side by side you would be able to tell the difference.</br>  <br> gets called retarded <br> angrily denies it and does so by providing proof of how retarded he is. <br><br>Go on, tell us about how you're not a retard, it's just your retard helmet making you look retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really can't.</br>  <br><br>I actually can't tell a difference between 24, 30, and 60.<br><br>15 looks a little jerky but even it is still fairly okay.<br><br>My eye-sight is 20/20.

I'm not shitting you.<br><br>The only difference I see is that the lower FPS looks worse graphically, not even from a jittering standpoint. I mean her hair looks shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>okay bro</br>  <br>Right. It's not just you deluding yourself and getting mad at your delusion being undermined at all.</br>  <br> Also shota sex incest ruined the whole thing. <br>Sounds fantastic. What are you some faggot?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Are you guys blind?</br></br></br>  <br><br>As I said. I have perfect vision yet I don't notice quality as much.

Sure, 30 doesn't look very bad, but it's clearly not the same.<br>And no, don't start. You are a lazy fuck if you don't see the difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Because something actually good will air instead.<br><br><br>I've actually yet to meet anyone in person who sees it as black and blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's subtle but 60 is definitely smoother. But it's really fucking subtle anyway and I would never realize it unless someone told me.<br><br>It's more obvious in games though, that I can admit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, come on, can't you see how choppy the light play on her belly becomes when on 30 fps?</br></br>  <br> hurr durr it doesn't look the same <br><br>It did before you started using 60fps. You gained nothing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The dress was spooky. I originally saw the white/gold or whatever it was, seriously.

That's the only place I can see the difference.</br></br></br>    <br> It did before you started using 60fps <br>No. It didn't. 30 still looks like it always looked to me. I never gained anything, because 60 was different from the first second. And you would see it too if you just weren't lazy to look at them and how fluid which one is.</br></br>  <br>What a travesty they never animated up to the REALLY crazy parts of the manga, fucking stopped RIGHT before the good stuff. <br><br>They kept it at ecchi vampire highschool when it could have been Vampire metal gear, with clones and all-encompassing conspiracies and nanomachines and the Bund becoming some kind of vampire Outer Heaven.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't met you in person.

Skip the filler though (except for Jack trying to search a job)</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm261<wbr>17250<br><br>They actually managed to make a better OP.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>If you want to send a letter you need an address to send it to.<br>My bet is Yugo just waited a few hours in whatever building he went to fill out an application, till they were approved</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thank you. I'll give it a try then.</br></br></br>  <br>BUY RAIDRAPTORS</br>  <br>This really makes me wish Arc-V had Shun as the MC and Sora as the main villain.</br>  There is nothing wrong with touching Reira.   mfw Crow is the one who gets into the finals against Yuya   <br>What<br><br>Crow doesn't even steal screentime in the Dark Signer arc. I don't even think Crow does that much in Episode 65 bar getting mad at Jack and Ghost.<br><br>Fuck off with this Crow hate meme, it's getting annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow beats Yuya and it's Crow vs. Jack and it completely ignores everything about Arc-V and turns into a 5Ds duel </br>  <br>I like how he went to Yuya's room first</br>  <br> Crow wins by spamming Blizzard <br>Best boy, cant remember the last duel that so closely resembles real ones</br></br>  <br>Sawatari vs. Security, so not that long ago.</br>  So why doesn't Yuya go searching for Yuzu now that apparently the doors are unlocked instead of hugging on Reira  <br>I wouldnt be surprised if that's not part of the reason he left his room, but calling Reiji a piece of shit comes first</br>  <br>A YGO MC can only be straight for so long.</br>  <br><br>He misses his shota Sora. Reira is just a temporarily replacement.</br></br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm263<wbr>13298<br><br>They also managed to make adorable Serena videos.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>He was about to leave, then Reira comes running to him. Reiji comes in after his little bro. Either takes his little bro back with him or leave Reira to cool himself with Yuya's presence. Meanwhile he closes the door behind him as he leaves.  :^) </br>  Why is thi scene so based  <br>Because it's the power rangers</br>  now that I think about it Johan's crystal beasts got two pendulum monsters, does that mean we'll see him in Arc-V?  <br>Yuya look like he wants to punch the viewers in the face</br>  <br>Possible, but I doubt it. CyDras got Infinity but unless Kaiser is running a Xyz/Fusion Resistance within Academia then what cards come out don't mean much.</br>  Why were people in the last thread saying Gon handed Crow the win? He attacked, same as he was planning on doing before he heard the story, and he didnt have any follow up plays  <br>Blizzard is the only non trash card he used.</br>  <br>Listening to the story gave Crow enough time to get to an Action Card, or something to that extent.</br>  <br>Trying to shit on Crow while justifying Gongenzaka. Crow could have easily put his monster in Defense Mode to keep off the attack and Crow could have re-done his Blizzard combo. Crow was going to win the whole time, Action Card or not.<br><br>But you know, hate clouds the eyes of judgement.</br></br></br>  <br> Stopping to monologue and listen to backstory <br>But everybody does that in duels</br></br>  <br>It is. Not our fault you have dirty thoughts when watching a anime based on a children's card game.</br>  Will Moonlights ever get printed?  <br>Right after fossils.</br>  <br>The only shot for them is the manga (assuming she uses the same deck) or the friendship cup. <br><br>If it's just more OTK/FTK Cat Butterfly stuff then we'll never see them sadly.</br></br></br>    <br>but now that action duel's are the new thing you get punished for it, Gon didn't let Crow win he took a risk that ended in Crow's favor</br>   Want to get into the new yugioh <br> Watch the latest episode <br> Crow motherfucking Hogan <br> oh shit nigga <br> Plays all his old Blackwings that I used to love playing <br> suddenly Assault Blackfeather <br> mfw <br><br>When did he get these?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Crow Hogan so much, I owned all the Blackwings and merchandise <br> I pray to Crow every night, thanking him for the food I have been given <br> "Crow is love," I say, "Crow is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a filthy commons <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Crow <br> I called him a traitor, a sellout to the Tops <br> He beats me 2-0 because of Red Demon's Dragon <br> I am crying now, because I'm hungry <br> I post about it on /a/, and they tell me CROW SUCKS <br> I feel a warmth moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Crow <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "Buy Blackwings" <br> He grabs me with his unwashed hands and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my duel disk for Crow <br> He summons a gajillion Blackwings <br> I have no skill, but I do it for Crow <br> I can feel my hand emptying as my field starts to fill up <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Crow <br> He yells a mighty yell as he tunes his synchro monsters to summon another Synchro monster <br> My Dad walks in <br> Crow looks him deep in the eyes and says, "For the children!" <br> Crow jumps out the window after stealing all of our cards and all of our food <br> Crow is love, Crow is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to impregnate Selena!  And not take responsibility.  </br>  <br> but now that action duel's are the new thing you get punished for it <br>And everybody still does it, it isnt treated as a significant thing. Nobody said Meiru handed Yuya the win when she talked so much about MUH FUTURE and he ended up grabbing an Action Card just in time</br></br>  <br>exactly</br>  <br>This is suposed to be an alternate version of Crow, Arc-V has a multiverse plot (with Fusion, Synchro and Xyz having their own dimension, the main characters come from the "Standard" dimension that can use all the summon methods plus the New Pendulums.<br>Crow either got his cards from his mentor like in 5Ds, got them in a dumpster or stole them from some rich people</br></br>  My sides. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bvP<wbr>NNSiGQbo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br> spoiler <br><br>What is wrong with you?</br></br></br>  <br> He's a Fusion </br>  <br>Have you ever taken care of a baby? It's hard work.</br>  <br>It's more that Gon decided to help Crow out with his problems and he did this after contemplating what would happen if he won. Besides the fact he could have put his monsters in defence position doesn't matter when he didn't. Just like Hokuto could have used Pleaides in the Battle Phase even though he didn't.</br>  <br> not wanting to marry Selena and have many children with her <br><br>Ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably in a Fusion based version of Highspeed Riders like the Phantom Knights are getting printed in the XYZ booster version of that. Ancient Gear support would probably be in that too and maybe Yuri's archetype as well.</br>  <br>what will Yuri's dragon do?</br>  <br>I don't think it matters either way, if Crow had not told his sob story, he was still going to grab an Action Card that would help him either way. You can literally see a bunch of Action Cards just planted into the ramps.</br>  <br>Disgusting.<br><br>You take care of those crude and strong children you create.<br><br>This Anon knows whats up, even if he pairs Shun/Serena together like a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  Since LDS is called LID in the dub, what will the Lancers be called since the Lance Defense Soldiers title doesn't work  <br> It's more that Gon decided to help Crow out with his problems <br>He did that with Yuya as well. Stuff like that happens plenty of times, people just apply double standards for this because they have an unreasonable hate boner for Crow and they think Gon should stay in the tournament, ignoring the fact he's already gotten a fuckton of duel time</br></br>  <br>My guess is that it will be a dark dragon level 7 2500 ATK/2000 DEF Fusion that has something to do with level 5 or higher monsters.</br>  <br>Yuya: Offensive Double Attack<br>Yuto: Offensive Double Attack + Attack Raise<br>Yugo: Preventative Negation and Destruction + Attack Raise<br>I'd assume Yuri's will have a stronger effect than Yugo's but be similar.<br><br>Especially considering Yuzu's Fusion monster (which was likely on the field at some point) was no longer on the field.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lost In Dimensions</br>  <br><br>But they devoted 3 entire seconds of the 2nd OP to her summon.</br></br>  <br>They'll be Lancers In Distress once I get ahold of them~~</br>  <br><br>Yeah I know it's scripted. I'm just explaining the viewpoint. He could win by spamming burn action cards if Hikki decided that. <br>People are annoyed Gon didn't just attack Crow before the sob story.</br></br></br>    <br> implying Yuri stands a chance against the strongest Lancer </br>  <br>You best sit down little boy, if Shun couldn't beat me, then you sure as hell can't. Hell I wasn't even at full strength dueling you.</br>  <br>You never even dueled Shun, Reiji. Stop taking Reira's drugs.</br>  <br>Who? The hippo? Well, at least he can bring a Dragon like mine with hi- Wait, no he can't, that's his real effect. Silly me.</br>  <br> forgetting that Reiji said Shun could do whatever he wanted if he managed to beat Reiji before walking away <br> Shun is then Reiji's bitch who listens to every word he says <br><br>It's implied they dueled at some point and Shun lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying someone who lost to a fusion is a good measurement of skill </br>  <br>Lightning Inter-dimensional Defenders.<br><br><br>Not enough Time/Stargazer fanart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it isn't. Reiji said he would duel Shun after the tournament.</br>  <br>You talking shit?</br>    <br>Man if Ryo return he's going to fuck shit up badly<br><br>I want him to get a duel like Jack where he just utterly detroys someone<br><br>Maybe..

Trump Witch &amp; Girl are still best. </br>   yfw Crow didnt use lv4 at all this duel <br>will he ever use Black Whirlwind?</br>  <br>NTR!!!<br><br> Incidentally, there is a new Frightfur, but I guess I'm being a slowpoke here now <br><br> http://i.imgur.com/eM2DTK9.png </br></br></br></br></br>  You guys are never going to give Crow a chance. You're going to hate him no matter what. I wanted Gon to win though I didn't expect him too and I'm not getting mad over it.

Not a good sign in getting me to like him. His sob story didn't move me either. Gon's hand was very obviously designed to help Crow and it's rare that it feels like that. Crow might as well have had two turns in a row.<br><br>Believe me I would have probably died of laughter.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to see timegazer's meaty dick inside yuya's tight boipussy.</br>  <br> Well his victory in this first duel was undeserved <br>Says you<br><br> His sob story didn't move me either <br>I liked, the dynamic of him needing the kids to give his life some actual purpose as much as they needed him was nice<br><br> Gon's hand was very obviously designed to help Crow <br>It really wasnt particularly bad compared to lots of MC duels (e.g. Harold summoning his Nordic God against Yusei then drawing nothing but normal monsters support)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I actually kinda want to see that happen.

Hell Asuka (considering she became a teacher there) has a better chance of appearing.</br>  <br> Yubel <br>Yubel has a complicated as fuck backstory, and wasnt actually in the series for all that long comparatively. I'd put Manjoume above both for likeliness</br></br>  <br><br> Reiji walks in to see this <br><br>What will he do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>Its head is too small, it looks too stupid to take seriously. That's nothing compared to the Centaur that Gon summoned.</br>  <br>Absolutely EROTIC</br>  <br><br>Did you get that pissed when Gon used that very same move to block Security only to get his monsters stolen and then for Shun to come and save the day?</br></br>  <br>I'd like to think Kaiser, Edo or Chronos have a decent chance of showing up.</br>  <br><br>I think Level 4 darkness winged beasts are Shun's thing now<br><br>Wonder if we'll ever see Sirocco, Bora, Gale combo again</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Sora is canonically more lewd.<br><br> Shota duel when? </br></br></br>  <br> Johan <br><br>Why?<br><br>He doesn't have any Fusions</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really considering at least they did something in being used to summon Rise Falcon. <br>The Magnets did literally nothing but deplete Gon's hand of two cards so they could justify the loss easier.</br></br>  <br>Shut up<br><br>Gon's deck is based on samurais yet samurai centaurs doesn't sound stupid?<br><br>Shut up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he has PENDARUMU.</br>  <br>But he doesn't have any Fusions</br>  <br>It's actually a Samurai Centaur Fox</br>  Why is Crow so shit he ruined the series again  <br> samurai centaurs doesn't sound stupid? <br>It does sound stupid but it looks great. That Blackfeather is just bad. Raikiri was more threatening than that thing. Same for the old stuff like Armor Master.<br><br>Just like in 5Ds it was already becoming meh. Crow just happened to be there both times.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And if some different Arc-V OC donut steel character replaced Crow it wouldn't be anything different and you guys wouldn't be throwing your panties in rage<br><br>Fuck off faggots, or you know what, stay here so I can drink my coffee while laughing at all this ass devastation</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Magnets did literally nothing but deplete Gon's hand of two cards so they could justify the loss easier. <br>Gon wanted to stall while he gathered his Pendulum Scale. It isnt remotely an unreasonable play by anime standards</br></br>  <br><br>Its name is Superheavy Demon Beast Kyu-B. So it's technically not a Superheavy "Samurai", but rather treated as one. Same for the two Pendulum Gon used</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah though he could have stalled with his hand trap monster anyway. Could've used the magnets as Synchro fodder.<br><br>But regardless Crow needed to show of the ability of Raikiri. We haven't seen it in the anime yet so breaking through a stall barrier was the best way to do so</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah though he could have stalled with his hand trap monster anyway <br>That would have required him to take a direct attack first, and doesnt establish as much field presence as the lock monsters<br><br>  Could've used the magnets as Synchro fodder <br>That was probably his plan for next turn</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Join in.</br>  <br>Crow butthurt is pretty much the only thing that keeps these threads going recently. Even the Ruriposting has decreased massively. This is one of the lowest hype points since the Eita duel but at least we had a plot episode after the Michio and Eita duels.<br><br>More or less this. What I'm saying that if Crow had two turns nothing would have changed since the Magnets were obviously there to die to Raikiri.</br></br></br>  Think Yuya will learn how to Accel Synchro and Rank-Up Magic?<br><br> I hope they introduce an advanced Fusion method. Or would that just be single monster "fusions" like Masked Heroes? </br></br>  <br>The Synchro Arc sucks. It might as well be a Filler Arc with a Filler Villain because we already had a main villain in Akaba Luthor.<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Synchro Arc is the new Crashtown.  I hate this 5Ds flavour. ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Contact Fusion?</br>  <br>I'm surprised OERD wasn't a Rank-Up<br><br>But I guess all Odd-Eyes monsters can't be any level under 7 or else shit</br></br></br>  <br>I love art of characters with their monsters.</br>  <br><br>You're getting butthurt over nothing. Stalling until Gon has the right cards and can start his play is what he's always done. Remember his first duel against Yaiba? Gon didn't do anything his first turn except play some weak ass monster to stall. His new attack lock strategy is pretty advanced compared to his old Kabuto play</br></br>  <br><br>Super poly</br></br>  <br>You're just jealous he's stealing Yuya from you, Sora.</br>  <br>Sora vs. Reira when?</br>    http://eleore.tumblr.com/post/12515<wbr>9846538/magi-275-spoilers </wbr> <br><br>Alibaba is a sage.</br></br>  <br>Why is the mother dragon so  pretty ?</br>  <br>Alibaba is actually a cactus person.</br>   He tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what looked like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there he heard about the dragon from a certain someone (I’m betting Ugo). <br>What</br>  <br>Ugoh?</br>  <br>So Baba evolved into Caca after what looked like a hundred years of training in the old world?<br>Would he go back to the new world looking like that though, the chinks already proceeded to cremate his body.</br></br>  <br><br>Dear God, I'm so hyped for his return<br> I've come to end this war <br><br>Also,<br> 118 year old virgin <br>his wizard powers must be off the charts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I know that a lot of people are triggered by Sabo('s backstory), but you can't tell me that this right here isn't way worse writing.<br><br> hurr durr let me use Gear 4 which I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br> You're going all out?
