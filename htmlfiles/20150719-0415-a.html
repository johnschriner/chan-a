Anything would be fine, but if someone would like to try something in particular, I feel that these two poses would suit her:<br><br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/206<wbr>6767<br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/649<wbr>008<br><br>Lewd (of varying degrees) is fine too.

Some people need to sleep you know.</br>  <br>Currently attempting to cook up something involving her reading a flesh-bound book and eldritch horrors.

Do you draw the whole body for it? Like here the sleeves aren't aligned with the arms properly, especially on the right. It's a lot easier to get it right if you draw the whole body with volumes before adding clothes.</br>  <br>Thank you, kind anon. Hope you slept/sleep well too.

This helps you position objects in space and properly add perspective to them. So your rough sketch should be a bunch of cylinders, cones and spheres and not just the outlines of them. <br><br>Once you're good enough you do it all in your head and don't need it but for people starting out it helps a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>You deserve it, dude, of course you need it. Carry on being awesome</br>  <br>Oh, I never heard it called using volumes, but I can see where that's coming from. Thanks for enlightening me, anon!</br>  Requesting super sexy Suiseiseki please and Desu!

This pic had shown up in the manga as a sort of cross-promotion, capitalizing on Hingiku's popularity by dressing her as Ichigo.

Judging from the interest in Buggy's fruit it seemed like they didn't really care too much.<br><br>You also have to remember that as a pirate you spend most of your time on the sea, and losing the ability to swim is enough for the majority of the pirates to avoid eating one (Especially if the fruit is unknown), the only reason we don't see shitloads of fodderish DF users drown is because it would be pretty boring and somewhat morbid. <br><br><br><br>If PH is any indicator, they can permanantly change the climate of an island.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Devil <br>Demon <br>Literally god'a natural enemy</br></br></br>  <br>Transform/alter the environment into their element; as seen on Punk Hazard and with Crocodile.</br>  <br> Daring </br>  <br>There is no evidence Shanks intended to sell the Gomu Gomu.<br>Zero.<br>There is evidence against it.<br>For example on the first page of storyline canon (actual page one is a color spread of Luffy and Shanks and many characters in a open area full of treasure, celebrating), a narrator tells us Shanks arrived 1 year ago.

I really don't see it happening.<br><br>Whitebeard and his crew all saw Luffy fight, and Luffy has interacted with a lot of legends like Rayleigh and Chiango who would have mentioned something about similar powers.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Zou will be an arc similar to the Davy Back Fight arc because Oda know when to give his readers a break after long, exhausting arcs.  <br>Roger has only been shown going into battles with a sword and pistol, and presumably haki on top of that.</br>  <br> shit song <br> terrible outfits <br> shit drawing <br> shit animation <br> cheesy dialogue <br><br>Only good things were the Dressrosa parts, and that was only about 30 seconds of the whole thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what new fate things Zoro learned from Mihawk.  <br><br>I'm hoping there's a huge amount of buildup for Big Mom, including flashbacks to fights with WB/Roger/Kaido etc... Then she opens the bomb from FI completely destroying her flagship and critically injuring most/all of her crew.</br></br>  <br>He cut apart the ship when he arrived back on Saboady, saying it was fate that he got on it accidentally.</br>  <br>Yeah but that seems like something Zoro would do normally.</br>  <br> fan colored manga <br>Eww no thanks</br></br>  <br>Is this bait?<br>There is nothing to suggest that the ancient kingdom name has a D in it anywhere.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Your loss friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br> pics <br><br>And people still thinks Mihawk &gt; Doffy</br></br></br></br>  <br> dude no one talks about and have never seen him fight is better then people we seen fight and one is the greatest swordman in the world fuck off mate </br>  <br>replied to wrong post. anyway the point is still the same the ancient kingdom could be raftel/lvneel/whatever and it wouldn't require a D.</br>  <br>He is.</br>  in the final fight I bet zoro flashback to Koshiro and not Mihawk. If Koshiro was #1 before Kuina died especially. Who says Koshiro was ever defeated by anyone?    <br>What chapter did that flashback start in?</br>  <br>Chapter 5<br>You'll have to read 90-100 to find the second because I forgot, but when Zoro meets Tashigi and gets two new named swords he has a second.

Maybe Koshiro really is better.</br></br></br>  <br> No, All Blue will happen <br>No you don't know anything about it,neither do any of us.Stop forcing your own headcanon into making it a fact because no ones cares about your shitty theories.</br></br>  <br><br>It´s been discussed to death, and most seem to agree it would happen.<br><br>Because of that, it´s without a doubt gonna happen!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't respond to it.</br>  <br>Any general ones you want posted? I've only got like 100 saved.</br>    Who's the qtest character and why is it Roofy?  <br>I want ones like this.</br>   koala will never hotdog yo dik   <br>How the fuck is anyone suppose to fight Sanjuan Wolf?</br>    <br>Do you mean official Oda ones?

Literally just overpower them by being strong.</br>  Do you think Marines will uprise to the WG at the end? Are you expecting a coup d'etat?  <br>Someone shop the Xusasu Basasu and everyone's typeset into this color page. It'd be glorious.</br>  im not sure what the heck was going on in chapter 793<br><br>The navy is angry because Luffy upset the balance of shichibukai or something?</br></br>  <br>Basically, what's not easy to get though? It's all pretty clear.</br>  I'm hoping they managed to get away<br>What I'm expecting is that only like one or two of them got away and everyone else was captured.<br><br>If anything, I'm sure Sanji's being forced to cook for big mom</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can see that happen under akainu's tutelage.<br>He doesn't give a fuck about the WG and wants the marines to be his own tool of justice.</br></br></br>  here is as good a place to post this as anywhere  Why does Oda always pierce your heart by his shit and you start to almost cry?<br> That person they spoke of wasn't some random pirate and he wasn't the cursed offspring of the great pirate era that everyone spoke of, Ace was my brother </br>  So I am reading one piece again and I'm at Skypiea. Here is this scene where Robin talks how the lightning fruit is one of the invincible powers. Is she talking about Logia in general or are there fruits which are considered invincible?<br><br>Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line?</br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I think the line was about the most powerful ones <br>the goro goro is one <br>pika pika is another<br>gura gura <br>and probably the magma one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line? <br>Oda confirmed that he would have had a 500 million bounty if he were on the blue sea. So New World tier of course.<br><br>Also, I think it's one of the invincible in that the user is very hard to kill perhaps. He did restart his own heart with the fruit after all.<br><br><br>Could also be this; I'd argue Enel's fruit is the best in the series so it could be reference to the overall power of the fruit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason Enel lost was because for no real reason he made himself really big and unable to dodge.<br><br>Maybe Oda bumped him out of the plot early on because he's planned out all the biggest powers early on and the lightning one was so strong he needed it out of the way.</br></br></br>  <br> new world tier <br>Yeah, no. Bounty != strength. Enel would get trashed by any top-tier New World Pirate/Marine.</br></br>   big mom showing up already to get jobbed.   <br>yeah, i like to imagine Roger as a beast, no fruit, no weapons, only the good old barehands and his fukking super haki<br><br>Also i want an entire Arc for Roger adventures/flashback (at least the early and the late years)</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like for Roger's flashback to show him as a  horrible criminal who burns down cities and steals fucking everything. <br><br> But I'm aware he'll have to be another good guy who never does wrong. </br></br></br>  <br>Has she been conirmed for battling anyone as of late? I'd love it, if she pulled a Gecko Moria and got a lot weaker for not dong anything for a long time. She's able to keep her position due to her past notoriety, but it's not based on anything anymore.<br>Then her whole crew should job against the SHs on the Sunny.</br></br>  <br>People tend to forget how insanely strong Doffy is.<br>He wasted Law and Luffy while mantaining that stupid birdcage that not even a whole island could stop, including Zoro and Fujitora. Also Gear Fourth Luffy could not finish him even when Law already injured him big time. Doflamingo is fucking strong.</br></br>  <br> brook drinking soda which would dissolve his bones <br> luffy feeding a fish soda which would fucking kill it <br>Robin's hot legs are the only thing that save this pic.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Roger will be a  a complete retarded who act before thinking  with enough knowledge and focus to reach raftel.<br><br>Also  final boss is Davy Jones, Admiral of the ancient kingdom, become the keeper of Raftel and One Piece, who is something world gov needs to achieve the complete control of the world </br></br></br>  <br> Told people to blame God <br><br>I thought Zoro is an atheist?</br></br></br>  <br>man, croco is so weak now. luffy can stop his attacks like nothing.</br>  <br> people forget <br>Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't.<br><br>Oda dropped the fucking ball with this arc its presentation is so boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DFs &gt; Haki<br>Enel would destroy people with lightning. No-one is immune to it but Luffy in the world.</br></br>  <br>Everyone is forgetting that Enel has the most advanced form of Kenbunshoku Haki seen so far.</br>  <br>Implementing his DF power into it really is unique. I can't wait how he applies niggermode into it.</br>  <br>dont read it through mangapanda if you are. if you arent, dont see what's so hard to understand</br>  <br> Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>No it's not, it's just that when you read weekly you forget events much quicker due to a certain amount of things taking 2 years, while with every other arc you got to experience the whole thing in a continuous hit.</br></br>  <br>Because any NW pirate/marine can do something about Enel's god-tier CoO and speed of light.</br>  <br> he becomes black with lightning powers </br>  <br> Because any NW pirate/marine <br><br>Why do people say this sort of thing about 'all' nw denizens when the majority of them, including crews, seem no more stronger than most of what we've seen before? There's just a few captains and things who are strong. Their crews are still the same jobbers.</br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora also likely does a similar thing with his gravity to advance his CoO.<br><br>Exactly (correction though; speed of lightning =/= speed of light, but it's still a fucking massive velocity which would be comparable in the OPverse)</br></br></br>  <br> I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>or maybe it's cause you're dumb. one refresh should be enough to remind you or keep up with things, only because it's so long.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>I would forget about some things from Impel Down, Marineford, Fishman Island and Punk Hazard as well. <br>It's kind of sad we'll always have newfags whining about whatever current arc is, no matter how good it may be.</br></br></br>  <br>You realise that Zoro, Usopp, Sanji and Robin survived his lightning, right ? Just CoA up and block that shit.</br>  You guys think Law will the be next Straw hat? Here is my thought:<br><br>Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats. It's always been like this and now we have seen Law's. <br>You guys think there is any correlation with that?</br></br></br>  <br>People survive every DF, however Enel's is one that's highly effective at incapacitating people.<br><br>Haki wont block out lightning by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the crew got stronger too ? I feel like it's relative. The crew fought fodder before but that same fodder would be dust in the NW. The fodder in the NW would be semi-successful in the Grand Line.</br>  <br>What role could he fill though?<br><br>I've been saying this for ages: the strawhats need a cook</br></br></br>  <br>Law has his own crew, but they can die, or he can give command to someone else. It's possible.<br> Kaido or Big Mom massacre Law's crew <br> Law seeks revenge again </br></br></br>  <br>We've seen bunch of non-crew members having flashbacks. By that logic Hody Jones should be a member already.</br>  <br>Surgeon.<br>Chopper is a great doctor, but can he perform surgery?</br></br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br>Senor Pink/Baby5 for next nakama!</br></br>  <br> Implying that Zoro is not a God. </br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I preferred the translation "Blame it on a quirk of fate."</br>  <br> Haki wont block out lightning anyway <br>You base this on absolutely nothing. If Haki can block fucking Light and Magma, it sure as shit can block Lightning. <br><br>Also, the NW people are obviously going to be a lot tankier than the Grand Line people. We have no idea if someone with Doffy's endurance would be incapacitated at all. Shit, he didn't fall unconscious after getting his insides scrambled.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would not even be mad.</br>  <br>Proof?</br>  <br>Zoro doesn't really have a role except being the badass sword fighter does he? Law could just be another fighter because they need one. And his surgery skills are needed. Chopper can't do every thing by himself. Not the kind of surgeries Law can handle.</br>  <br>Post yfw Zoro is revealed to be an ancient deity based around anger and carnage.<br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br>When has haki blocked light? Not in the sense of Rayleigh using it on his sword; but if Kizaru shot a beam of light at you, your haki on your body wouldn't defend that. Especially when haki like Vergo's can't even block out Law's ability</br>  <br>Zoro's just the Swordsman, yea.</br>  <br>That would be such a pain. He's been emo for long enough now, I want to see him enjoy life for once.</br>    <br><br>it's not really official but he fits the role as the first mate.</br></br>  <br>There's more required to become a crewmate than just a sad backstory.<br>You need:<br> Goal which requires travelling the seas <br> Sad backstory <br> A general role they can take (which is either wanted by Luffy or necessary I'd say) <br>Jinbei for instance has it all, which is why he's confirmed to join.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not talking about how every one who had a backstory joined the straw hats. But every straw hat that did, had a backstory before joining.<br><br>Just a thought that popped into my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way the user can be blocked, I suppose. I'm not saying it will negate the attack. I'm saying you can put up a defense, since Enel's lightning seems more similar to Magma than Light for whatever reason. And we really haven't seen anyone use CoA for defense against Kizaru, so I suppose I'm being baseless too. That's my bad.</br>  <br>Like an Archaelogist!</br>  <br> Kaido or Big Mom kill Law <br> Law's crew joins Luffy <br>A whole bunch of new nakamas is better than one.</br></br></br>  <br>Robin does have a dream though. It's to discover the true history of the world.</br>  <br> implying they don't need an archaeologist for reading the poneglyphs </br>  <br>Robin is indeed necessary for finding One Piece. Luffy is lucky that his fate lead her to joining.</br>  <br>but they could also have that backstory introduced later in the series. like robin. so characters that didnt have a backstory in dressrosa shouldnt be automatically ruled out, or Oda might not even keep up with that pattern. I think having a dream that makes sense to travel the seas with the strawhats and a new role they can fit into on the ship seem like a better criteria for now. <br><br>Which is why I dont think anyone's joining this arc.</br></br></br>  <br>chapter 816 second page</br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br><br>Robin.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, that's Law performing immortality operation on Chopper. You fucked up, /a/non.</br>  <br> Robin <br><br>What is the Tragedy of Ohara</br></br></br>  <br>ooh shit sorry youre right</br>  <br><br><br>I know, I know. I was just joking because Luffy doesn't seem to give 2 shits about it right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why did Oda make him suck so much ass?<br>All he did was essentially was use birdcage and then tank every attack thrown at him until he lost.<br>We didn't even get to see him actually fighting save for a few exchanges.</br></br></br>  <br>He was against his own protege and a prick that trained for 2 years solid. The majority of which was under Rayleigh himself. There was no way Doffy could have predicted that kinda growth.</br>  <br>Luffy and Law were absolutely thrashed with just a couple of blows. Also he has to lose, so Oda wrote it that way. We already saw him kicking ass in Marine Ford (Joz and Oars Jr), then fucking smoker up, tanking Aokiji attacks and wasting Luffy and Law. He has been the major villain who kicked the most ass in all fairness.</br>  I wonder how long it'll be before Luffy loses a fight again.  <br><br>Regardless of what happens, Doflamingo will be the best just because of that fabulous pink feathers coat.</br></br>  Which Yonko will Luffy oneshot?  <br>But he did fight back. He put Law on the verge of death, then put Luffy 3m deep inside a wall.<br>Without the whole colliseum team, Doffy would have finished this in 5min, it was a 200v10</br></br>  <br>He technically lost in PH. Most of the crew did.</br>  I'm beginning to suspect Brook might be a bit of a pevert...  <br>Shanks cause he'd be too busy crying over how far Luffy has come.</br>  <br><br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br> backstory of a character before they join  <br> before they join <br><br>Robin joined the crew before her story was even remotely explored. <br><br>It's entirely possible for someone to join then have their backstory explained later.<br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was just traveling with them until after Ennis Lobby. Her "I wanna live!" moment was when she officially became a Straw Hat, I reckon.</br>  <br>(Like how Nami was with them for a while and only became a Straw Hat after Luffy took care of Arlong.)</br>  <br>Technically we didn't get Nami's either. Or Usopp, I think. I think we got Usopp's just when they set sail, right ?</br>  <br> sail on a ship <br> obey captain's orders <br>That's all you need to be a crewmate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking serious?<br><br>How was Robin not a part of the SH during Skypeia? Your statement is complete bullshit and you're pulling crap out of your ass to try justify it.<br><br>You know you're wrong and you're grasping at straws.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I'm thinking too. She basically invited herself onto the crew. She became a full member after Enies Lobby is what I always thought.</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>One Piece Party 2. It's on Mangastream at least. Probably other places, too.<br><br>Is everyone who's traveled with the Straw Hats and fought along side them a member of the crew? Jimbei? Vivi? Those two bounty hunters from early on?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is complete bullshit and you know it, the argument isn't "They're not a REAL crew member until they have their backstory is explored"<br><br>The argument is that "Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats"<br><br>If you don't think Robin was a part of the SH's during Skypeia you're being willfully ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>if you have to spoonfeed, spoonfeed the non-cancerous version retard<br>http://bato.to/read/_/307282/one-pi<wbr>ece-party_ch2--v2-_by_powermanga/2<br>Chapter 3 is also up there as it seems.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Vivi was asked to join the crew and rejected the offer due to having to take care of Alabasta.<br><br>Jimbei said he would join after clearing a few things up.<br><br>The two bounty hunters were barely even around, maybe a dozen panels at most. Robin was around for Skypia which was 100+ chapters. You're making terrible comparisons to try dig yourself out of a hole.<br><br>I swear do you even read this shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>when he kills/cripples mihawk<br><br><br><br>My guess is we are going to meet more BB pirates since their aim is devil fruits and such. Shiliew could maybe be after mihawks sword or title as we speak.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do people actually like this guy?<br><br>His hat looks super gay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Turns out a lot of people don't judge a character by how "gay" his hat looks. What a fucking wonderful World!</br>  <br>Danke. Here's your reward.</br>  <br> &gt;I swear do you even read this shit? <br>Becoming a Straw Hat isn't about allying yourself with them, even over a long term.<br><br>It's about not holding back and giving yourself over to them as a cause. Robin didn't fully believe in them until Ennis Lobby when they declared war on the government. She was still holding back because she was afraid they'd dump her or try to turn her in like everyone else in her past.</br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>They'd better get some decent screentime and be involved in an actual fight.<br>...please.</br></br>  <br>How is this a reward?<br><br>Are you stupid?</br></br></br>  <br><br> she was afraid they'd dump her or try to turn her in like everyone else in her past <br><br>Holy fucking shit you're retarded, you just proved you don't read this shit.<br><br>The reason Robin went with CP9 willingly during W7 was because she truly cared for the SH pirates, she knew that refusing would invoke a buster call and lead them to their deaths.<br><br>Kuzan mentioned that she could have easily escaped if she was by herself, the fact she cared for the SH's was reason enough for her to sacrifice herself. If that isn't enough dedication for you, you can go fuck yourself.<br><br>I'm going to stop responding to you because you're completely wrong and pulling bullshit out of your ass like <br><br> It's about not holding back and giving yourself over to them as a cause <br><br>Your headcanon != canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're so gay.</br>  <br>Stop posting like a fucking asshole</br>   &gt;not liking gay hats   <br>Chapter 398. It's not even subtext. It's text text.</br>  Does anyone else want some more gun using pirates?  <br><br> I couldn't leave them <br> Not a member of the crew <br><br>k</br></br></br></br></br>    The fuck is up with this party chapters stuff?  <br>Is Aokiji a D?</br>  <br>goddamn that's one of the very few things that would make me insanely mad. No way in hell Roger had the gomu gomu, that's way too much of a clichè  and it's also really fucking retarded </br>  <br> we'll never have a SH gun user <br>Oh well, we still have Izo and Yasop. They're cool.</br></br>  <br>What a shitty spinoff. Most crack doujins are more entertaining.</br>  Oh Bellamy.    <br>Yeah Zoro ain't nothing to fuck with.</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>Kuzan D.  Frost </br>  <br>Is this from one of the movies? I've never watched the anime or any of the movies.</br>  <br>yeah it's from the latest movie<br>the anime has nowhere near the production value for animation like that</br></br>  <br> a well executed fight against a decently strong woman where Zoro doesn't pussy out with cheap excuses and actually take her seriously <br>Movie Z not canon confirmed.</br></br>  <br> Zoro doesn't pussy out <br>The only woman Zoro has met in his entire life worth taking seriously was Kuina.<br>No other woman has proven capable of coming near to challenging him.</br></br></br>  <br>Dunno, but I like this cover.</br>  <br>D stands for Dereshi.<br>Robin knew it from her eavesdropping on the scholars.<br>Monkey Dereshi Dragon</br></br></br>  Who /best boy/ here?  <br> Law <br> fun <br>Pick one!</br></br></br>  <br> actually take her seriously <br>Nope. He knew she wasn't into it before the fight even began. The only thing he ever took seriously was yelling at Luffy.<br><br><br>Rather surprising to see Robin has a bra.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are the Yonkos the only guys capable of rekting the admirals? <br><br>Ace was clearly no where near Akainu league. Jinbe who was Ace level was clearly not as well. <br><br>Aoikiji didn't find much trouble beating Jozu, he completely froze him. <br><br>Fuji implied he could've take Doffy but preferred to let Luffy handle him. <br><br>Marco and Bekhman might be Admiral level but then again Kizaru didn't seem very serious. <br><br>The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Short answer, Yes.<br>Long answer, Yes, the Yonkos are people like Dragon are the only people that strong. The WG needs the entirety of the Marines and the Shichibukai to balance out the Yonko's, and apparently this balance isn't to be fucked with. So, it's safe to assume that the Yonko's are fucking hideously strong.</br></br>  <br><br>Yep, Pirates would just run amok if there's nothing in the Marines stronger than them.</br></br>  <br>maybe not the only ones but yes, Admirals are clearly overpowered as shit.<br><br>and about the people who claim Kizaru was really scared of Beckman, do they always forget that something like five second after Beckman told him to stop Kizaru jumped into the air and spammed a storm of lightrays towards the submarine completely ignoring Benn? It's not like I dislike the guy but come on, it's pretty obvious Kizaru was being sarcastic</br></br></br>  <br> The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks. <br> Shanks <br>Not necessarily confirmed. He would have been a threat at that point even if he was just normal admiral level. A bunch of well rested admiral level guys showing up all of a sudden would have been too much for the navy to handle, that's why they agreed to stop the battle.<br>We still only have confirmation on the extent of abilities of WB and BB of the yonkos, the rest are still unknown.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le epic not hurt women attack </br>  <br>I like this theory about how the D is actually half of the moon and the people who have D in their names are remnants of the moon people who built the robots up there which connects it to the regular world</br>  <br>This leads me to believe that Sanji won't fight an Admiral. I'm not saying he's weak. By the end, I think Luffy will fight the main ''villain'', Zoro will fight an Admiral and Sanji will fight someone that's on Doffy's level. Which is still impressive. I really don't see Luffy/Zoro/Sanji fighting 3 Admirals separately at all.</br>  <br> Ponyglyphs' actually moon language <br>I kinda want this.</br></br>  <br>I really gotta watch this movie</br>  I just watched Strong World and did anybody else find it a little out of character that when hearing about the East Blue bombings, Luffy was just like "Welp, let's go back" and saying they can just restart their adventure.<br><br>I just feel like that doesn't really sound like something he would do. I mean he didn't even go to help Ace when he heard he was locked up</br></br>  <br>DREAM</br>  <br>Ace was a pirate. Both Luffy and Ace knew what that meant. Luffy was prepared to die every second of the journey. East Blue was a ''symbol of Peace''. East Blue has nothing to do with their fight, so to say. East Blue has tons of Luffy's friends and memories. It's where he grew up and where Daddan is. He went and fought the entire World to try and save his brother. You think he's going to just sit and watch as his entire childhood gets destroyed ?</br>  <br>Dude, wat ? He DID go to help Ace when he heard he was locked up. Luffy and the crew never knew where Ace was in Thriller Bark. All they knew is that Ace was dying/sick/not healthy. Nothing else. For all they know, Ace probably just lost a fight. They knew the paper would grow back when the person gets healthy so they were all happy. When Luffy realised Ace was going to be executed, in Amazon Lily, he immediately wanted to go to Impel Down instead of leaving it to Whitebeard.<br><br>It is sounds Exactly like something Luffy would do.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No because it would make no fucking sense.<br><br>Why wouldn't people who KNEW and SAW Roger fight react to Luffy using his fruit?<br><br>It would be a complete bullshit retcon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the only reaction image you own?</br>  <br>he's claiming the exact same thing you fucking dingdong</br>  <br><br>Well he was supposed to kill people just for insulting/laughing at his crew.<br><br>I don't think he's a completely good guy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear I'll flip out if X Drake isn't named D and D stands for Dinosaur.<br><br>I'll put my face through a window I swear.</br></br></br>  <br>That was early in the series wasn't it? Expect that to be brushed aside and ignored. Roger will just end up being luffy 2.0.<br><br>Or is that .5?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah misread.</br></br>   thanks to toei we will never get one piece remade into a high quality anime   <br> Expect that to be brushed aside and ignored. <br>why?</br></br>  <br> Anonymous <br> 4chan <br> reaction image <br>Do you realise how these things work ?<br><br><br>His name is like Diez Drake or some shit. A man can't have that many D's. It's unnatural.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Shanks is so strong how did that Sea King manage to bite off his arm?  <br>This was when kid Ace went rage mode and started assaulting people. So, not really that early.</br>    <br>What exactly is keeping the Yonko's from overpowering the marine?<br>I mean we saw that the entirety of the marine together with the shichibukai didn't have the power to take down 1 yonko and his crew.<br>They may hate each other but aren't the marines the common enemy of every pirate alive?</br></br></br>  <br>He is...<br><br>DOUBLE D.</br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean never? They might sell the rights to it in a couple of decades, when they can't milk it anymore.</br>  <br> Toei <br> Selling any of their properties <br> Implying any company can make as much money as they do with their sucessful properties <br><br>Look at what happened when Saint Seiya went to another studio</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HE BET IT ON THE NEXT GENERATION</br>  <br>Not really. The Marines don't actively fuck with the Yonko but the Yonko's themselves keep each other at a stalemate.</br>  <br> X D. Drake <br>I'm not sure I'm ready for the shitposting that would bring with it</br></br>  <br>DOUBLE D's are fine! Triple D's are too much! I know he's a dinosaur but let's not make him a monster.</br>  <br>I dont think I am either</br>  <br>X D. Rake, you dingus.

He's the only admiral of the original 3 that hasn't done anything</br>  <br>Let's be honest here. Does Sanji have it in him to defeat either Pekoms or Tamago?<br><br>Sanji couldn't even scratch Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br><br> that doesn't even make sense <br><br>'That' pic + lasers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no dragonballs <br>i am disapoin</br></br>  <br> Luffy vs Akainu <br><br>why can't I possibly imagine Luffy defeating Akainu in a 1 vs 1? I mean, I know there are several people who expect it to happen, but I seriously can't see that happening with some major asspull / another timeskip (and this one is debatable too) / a 5 vs 1 gangbang<br><br> mind you, I don't even like Sakazuki that much </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji hasn't revealed Okama Kenpo yet.<br><br>I think Oda might try to pretend that Sanji+Okama Kenpo is almost as strong as Zorp</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy and Sabo vs Saka</br>  <br>Not really anybody could scratch Vergo except maybe Luffy.</br>  <br>Sorry but I honestly can't see it happening. I was hyped about this kinda scenarios when I first started following the series but as I grew, I realised it probably isn't going to happen. <br><br>Take a look at most, if not all, all Sanji's opponents. They all have some kind of ''kenpo''. Some kind of weird martial arts technique. Sanji doesn't just get paired up with some guy who kicks. Not at all. And Kizaru is arguably one of the stronger Admirals. if anything, he'll be the one to fight Zoro. <br><br>Luffy fights the Fleet Admiral<br>Zoro fights Kizaru, who Rayleigh tango'd with.<br>Sanji May fight Rokyugu, if he is some type of Martial Artist, or he'll fight someone strong, like, Kuma's level of strong.<br><br>I really can't see this Monster Trio vs 3 Admiral scenario. And I quite honestly am not that disappointed about it. I think it's for the best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>without*</br>  <br>sanji has the shittiest timeskip growth, its so fucking stupid, he's so fucking underpowered i feel like any SH member can defeat him now(even usopp, since he has haki now and shoot the fucking shit out of him in the sky)</br>  <br>Zoro hasn't used Asura either.</br>  <br>These coloured scans are excellent, is the guy/group doing these still active?</br>  <br>Luffy will be Pirate King, he will be the strongest person alive<br><br>dealwithit</br></br></br>  <br><br> next/whatever chapter <br> Big Mom's ship rekt <br> Nami, Brook etc. Enel faces <br> Don't mention this again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks. <br> WB <br><br>What a bunch of imbeciles you Whitebeard Pirates are!<br><br>Well I suppose it's no surprise your captain being who he is.<br><br>After all Whitebeard is nothing but a loser from a dead era!<br><br>Gold Roger conquered the entire Grand Line. He gave his life to open the door on a new era the Great Age of Pirates. A Navy man like me probably shouldn't say this but that man truly deserved the title of "Pirate King".!<br><br>What is Whitebeard when compared to that? I mean did he even have the guts to fight against Roger? All he's ever done is hide in some safe corner of the world and keep himself out of trouble right? These days some fools may claim Whitebeard's name alone upholds peace on various islands. But as far as I'm concerned he just intimidates the small-fry and believes himself a hero for it.<br><br>Ridiculous! Roger maintained his honor as long as he lived and even dead his fellow pirates hailed him as a king. In other words Whitebeard is an eternal loser who will never surpass Roger! That is all he is.<br><br>Everything I've said is the truth. Now that I think of it he sure is one pitiful man. Making all his underlings call him their "Old Man" or "Father" or whatever and sailing the seas playing house.<br><br>He reigned the seas for decades yet he never became a king or gained anything. He got himself stabbed because one of those foolish "sons" of his believed every word I said and now he'll die to protect that same fool. Truly an empty existence.<br><br>If man does not live righteously he does not deserve to live at all! You rogue pirates don't deserve a "place to belong"!<br><br>Whitebeard will die a loser! A fitting end for a little fish in a big pond!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ya'll niggas forgetting there's a green guy we don't know who Sanji could fight  <br>and its funny because I used to root for Sanji pre-timeskip because he was pretty bad-ass</br>  <br><br>u wot m8.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Enel would roast Nami and Sanji on sight out of principle.</br>  <br>Look, I know this 'Sanji is so weak lel' thing is mainly a joke but I honestly can't tell if you're joking or not. I love Usopp to death. He's one of my favorite characters but it's fucking retarded if you think Usopp mastered CoO and knows perfectly well how to use it and actually hit Sanji.</br>  <br> implying <br><br>luffy's new gear form is overpowered, doffy couldn't even cut him because he is made of haki infused rubber</br></br></br>  <br>sure thing, that does not mean that I cannot dislike the fact (if that ever were to happen) of him soloing Sakazuki and alikes.</br>  <br><br>Perona didn't get roasted though.</br></br>  <br>Usopp isn't even aware that he used CoO</br>  <br> Strings, thin pieces of strings, used as a slashing attack <br>compared to<br> Fucking magma. <br>Really, anon ?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Like fucking hell once he gets used to it and can spam it like G2/G3, jesus. <br><br>Also, just wait for more forms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> luffy's new gear form is overpowered <br><br>it would be if it weren't for the problem of it having a time limit and a fucking gigantic drawback.<br><br> doffy couldn't even cut him because he is made of haki infused rubber <br><br>I'd argue Doffi couldn't do shit against him in that form because it was used after Doflamingo was severely weakened from his own internal organs being slashed up, and even then he would've won in a pure 1vs1 because Luffy needed the support of all of the gladiators after gear 4th ended while Doflamingo was still standing<br><br> now I'll pass out as a Doffifag but really, I'm not, I'm just stating what I think </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Perona was a side character and clearly helping Zoro<br><br>Enel is a crazy man who doesn't give two shits about nuking a peaceful place.<br><br><br>Exactly. After all this, when he wakes up, he's going to be just as confused as Coby was. Or he may not even notice it. He would go about his day thinking it was adrenaline or some shit. He won't realise what he did unless he talks to the Monster Trio.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>Its time to rewatch Film Z.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy <br> Almost passes out after 20 minutes <br> Still didn't knock Doffy unconscious <br><br> Akainu <br> Fought fucking Aokiji for 10 fucking days <br> Won <br><br>You do the fucking math.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even kidding, sanji hasn't even used anything decently strong other than bbq kicks and flying, I'm not sure whether he has anything up his sleeves(none used against vergo/mingo) but it probably is underwhelming as compared to luffy and zoro. Usopp has shown growth after the timeskip, developed haki and he probably has some one of a kind seed projectile just waiting for a strong opponent.</br>  <br><br> I'm not sure whether he has anything up his sleeves(none used against vergo/mingo) but it probably is underwhelming as compared to luffy and zoro. <br><br>You know Okama Kenpo will be strong as fuck, it has nothing to do with Sanji - it's Oda.</br></br></br></br>  Man, I don't know about you guys but Brook's dub voice does the YOHOHOHOHO damn perfectly  <br>if your haki is strong enough it doesn't matter if its lava or anything really.</br>  <br>Usopp unlocked Haki. He hasn't developed shit. He may not even know it was Haki. Why does everyone forget what happened to Coby when he unlocked CoO ? It took him 2 years to get good at it. Same for Sanji, and he's supposed to be the specialist. <br><br>You think Usopp would have fucking beaten Wadatsumi (with Jinbe's help), beaten Vergo and beaten Doffy if he just had CoO ? Fuck no. He'd die in seconds. <br><br>Look, if Sanji is 100, his growth is shown to be about 130 or so. +30. Usopp is only at about 50. His growth is about 40-50. These numbers are obviously arbitrary and not to scale or whatever, but you get the idea. <br><br>I'll say it again, I love Usopp. I love him way too much. But this is just silly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not sure whether he has anything up his sleeves <br> he probably has some one of a kind seed projectile <br> I'm not even kidding <br>did you miss your lobotomy appointment?</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw sanji busts out ivankov's techniques in his next big fight <br> mfw sanji's new ultimate move is version of Death Wink that channels the power of his eyebrows to fire in a spiral pattern </br></br>  <br>Yea. Except Haki isn't the end of the World. Luffy passes out after 20 fucking minutes. Even if Akainu was 1 punch away from K.O, he'd just have to flood the place with magma for Luffy to horribly die. And Akainu obviously won't get rekt that much in 20 bloody minutes. The dude fought another Admiral for 10 days straight. Luffy gets rekt if he doesn't eat Meat after fights.</br>  <br><br> Death Wink <br><br>I actually understood whether it was a technique or from Iva's fruit (obviously Hell Wink was due to his fruit)</br></br></br></br>  <br>and you're assuming Luffy's gear 4th haki is stronger than Akainu's how exactly? Basing on what? Instinct? Headcanons? And no, I've never assumed the contrary if that's what you're about to answer, I simply think Akainu is overall way stronger. I'm also sure that Luffy would doom himself by using Gear 4th against Akainu, there's no way in hell he would be able to defeat him in such a short time</br>   Luffy vs Yonko <br> Luffy vs Sakazuki <br> Luffy vs Smoker <br> Luffy vs not allied supernovas <br> Luffy vs Coby <br><br>Any other rivalries?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lobotomy <br> yfw it would be like Zoro testing out Shusui, and the blast gets absorbed or whatever and turns into a bigger, more destructive one <br> yfw Brook dies a 2nd time because he can't stop laughing <br> yfw Sanji did more damage to the crew than Big Mom </br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy vs   Zoro </br>  <br> Luffy vs   Gorosei <br><br> seriously the Gandhi one always holds a sword, it can't be just to show off right? </br></br></br>  <br><br>They looked too 'figured' to be nothing if you get me.<br><br>They just can't be for show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing to do with his fruit, Bon said it himself, he blinks with such force he creates a shockwave, so its not even a technique or something like that, just pure raw power.</br>  <br>It'd be Zoro vs Gandhi. He might have the Shodai Kitetsu. He might actually speak against violence or whatever but actually fights like an absolute pro.</br>  <br>Raw sexual prowess. What a guy.</br>  <br><br>Oh ok, that would be cool then.<br><br> Sanji appears with dress and eyeliner <br> shit's going down </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw it's the 4 yonkos against 4 of the gorosei and Dragon against the strongest one <br><br>it's NEVER going to happen for several reasons, but god would that be a perfect setup for a shitton of badass chapters</br></br></br>  Making some Film Z webms, anyone have any requests for scenes? I'll be doing a bit of Sanji's fight after this one.<br>Trying to find the optimal size to look decent and still be large enough to see.</br>  <br>Yea, it'll never happen sadly. I don't think I'd even want to see that actually. I more want to see Akainu + the Admirals fight them. Aokiji included. Garp would be in the background, throwing shit at Kuzan and his opponent, laughing and making fun of them.</br>  <br>Fuckin' Luffy going ham on Zephyr. That shit was amazing looking. Don't make it too long, just make it like 15 seconds or whatever, getting the juiciest bit and make it decent quality and I'll be in your debt for 5 minutes.</br>  <br><br><br>Could be everyone vs. everyone, Oda said the final fights will dwarf MF and I don't see it doing so unless it's a massive mosh between all the world's powers.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't think I'd even want to see that actually <br><br>provided the Gorosei are some monstrously strong fighters, I think I'd love that to happen. Then again, we yet have to see what the yonkos can truly do so</br></br></br>  <br>yes, that would be a dream for me. Everyone vs everyone fights best fights, there's always the coolest shit going down there, absurd cooperations and synergies and improbable matchups and such.</br>    <br>Oh, of course. It's a guarantee that pretty much everyone would be there and the arc would take like 3 years to finish but goddamn the hype levels would be through the roof. <br><br><br>Yea, I know, it's just that I don't really like the idea of Teach and Big Mom fighting with Shanks and Kaido. Teach, because I want him to be a plain villain and it would be odd to see him help the others. Big Mom, because she's my least favorite Yonko.<br><br>It'd be cool and all, I just prefer some other ''never gonna happen'' scenario to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji would seriously be the coolest character in the strawhat crew if he wouln't job that much, seriously pre-timeskip Sanji was at the very least a 8/10. Always fucking off to appear when he's actually needed. Like that time at the mr.3 arc or as mister prince or as the hunter and so on</br>  <br>if it's going to be a bigass pirates vs wg war I highly doubt Blackbeard of all people wouldn't be there. And assuming Shanks doesn't die before then, he'll be there as well. They may not be friends, but in such a situation they would be 'forced' to cooperate, and that to me would lead to some interesting scenarios.</br>  <br>this scene?</br>  <br>Haki makes him either broken or pointless.</br>  <br> Sanji was the only one to remember to open the gate after Luffy beat Lucci </br>  <br>Ohhhh, I love it when Luffy does that. Gets my blood pumping like nothing else. Thank you very much, Anon. Could you please also do that scene from the Trailers when Luffy is still clothed and goes ham on fodder, I think ?</br>  <br> I didn't think it would be this effective <br>Bastard planned it from the start. Also, forshadowing Bon-chan's sacrifice + Okama kenpo ?</br></br>  <br>this?</br>  <br>Not quite but I won't complain. It might not be against fodder and he may not have been clothed actually. I'm severely retarded. I meant when Luffy goes Gear 2 and screams Z's name in the trailers.</br>  I started reading One Piece Party because it was brought up earlier in the thread, and I love this page  <br>forgot image</br>  Oda's editor talks about Dressrosa:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cir<wbr>LmTzDldk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>I loved Luffy's reaction to meeting Sabo. It was so adorable to see this mad cunt, who looked like the devil when he fought Doffy, cry and lose his cool like that. To say it was heartwarming would be an understatement.</br></br>  What is this expression trying to convey?  I'm getting too anime for this shit  ohmf  Jitome never fails to render me erect.  <br>It's le cucumber women face</br>  <br>intoxication<br><br>She's drunk off of the amazing smell.</br></br></br>  That face means "this is a shitty anime made for sexual gratification of male audiences."<br><br>It also reeks of your typical "liberal" idiocy of "either you have to be an ultra-conservative prude who keeps children laughably sexually oblivious because you think sexuality is dirty, or you have your culture revel in all kinds of perversions and pornography which also do jack shit to challenge the status quo of seeing sexuality as something dirty."<br><br>The anime's title claims that it plays in a world where dirty jokes don't exist. Clearly they do exist, because people register them, except for ignorant children (just like in our current real-life culture, except the age of ignorance is raised).<br><br>A world where dirty jokes actually don't exist would be a world where people don't associate sexuality with perversion in first place. The whole concept of a dirty joke is based on the premise that sexuality is dirty, and hence a joke referencing sexuality is a dirty joke. This is the very same backwards, conservative mindset against sexuality, with the sole difference that now it's not banned but paradoxically celebrated despite still being exercised in perverted (dirty) ways.<br><br>Ask yourself why real-life women and especially young women and girls tend to be less inclined to partake in sexual discussions and dirty jokes. It's because in our current conception of dirty sexuality, the dirtiness serves as a way of demeaning the female side in sexuality. Either a formerly "pure" woman is dirtied, or an already dirty slut's dirtiness is enjoyed. In either case the female side's dignity is sold off for the male side's pleasure.<br><br>Which is why it's also bullshit that the girls in this show would naturally/instinctively find the pictures they're shown to be attractive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128254438 <br> we have no evidence human pheromones even exist — and these studies can all be traced back to a single fragrance company called Erox that managed to convince dozens of scientists their two "pheromones" were worth researching in the first place </br>  <br><br>I also masturbate.</br></br>  <br>As a hater of SJW and non fem supporter.

Porn industry is still booming too, and young people are believing their implicit, perhaps unintentional propaganda (including me until I picked up some radfem books). Who knows when tides will change; this whole mentality is actually what skill keeps young girls and women from being more sexually open.<br><br><br>Me too. What's your point?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>only if your ass is tight</br>  <br> this whole mentality is actually what skill keeps young girls and women from being more sexually open <br>Amen.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128254438 <br>give it a try</br>  <br>Real chicks can be as sexually open or closed as they want for all I give a shit.

Just because you don´t support a specific faction, doesn´t mean you can´t find interesting ideals and thoughts. <br><br>Don´t be so narrow minded.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was sorry to inform the other anon that an idea he liked very much was one of the *essential* ideas of a "faction" he hated. You would expect that to cause someone some amount of cognitive dissonance.<br><br>Of course it's mostly because /a/ is utterly ignorant on radfem topics.<br><br><br>By the way, best use ' for apostrophes, not `. Otherwise you'll stand out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The porn industry isn't as much of a boy's club as you'd like to make it out to be. Girl aren't passively being exploited by dirty sex traffickers, but are rather, in many cases, running the show/having due agency. <br><br>Voyeurism/pornography is the purest form of sexual liberation. As is having a sandbox to play out your perverted fantasies.<br><br>What is essentially the antithesis of sexual liberation is saying stuff like "this is a shitty anime made for sexual gratification of male audiences." Condemnation of genetically imprinted sexual impulses is a power play not dissimilar to the concept of original sin. Note, not culturally imprinted, genetically imprinted. Whether you'd like to believe it, or not a lot of these sexual 'perversions' you role your eyes at are rooted in, and are mostly informed by, biology and not by subliminal and persistent 'micro-aggressions'. <br><br> what skill keeps young girls and women from being more sexually open. <br>Nothing. Girls don't hold back their sexual 'perversions'. They aren't just passive victims of male 'perversions', but are perfectly capable of inflicting their own perversions.<br><br>Also, please don't be a feminist around here. You're literally asking for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm getting drunk on your musk.  the fuck am I reading  <br> for the male side's pleasure. <br>How? Wouldnt it be a lot more pleasurable for men if sluts didn't evoke feelings of disgust? Men didn't decide for things to be this way. If fact, nobody did.

They get lots of money and shallow respect for selling off their actual dignity.<br><br>In the "classy" sections of the porn industry at least. The more third-world you become, the more the true colors of the whole thing are revealed. Women in pornography and such in the west are protected by the general human-rights attachment of first world countries, but not woman-centered concerns.<br><br> Voyeurism/pornography is the purest form of sexual liberation. <br>I couldn't care less about the liberation of a conception of sexuality that is rotten in its roots. Sexual liberation was supposed to mean "free love," not a liberation of exaggerated versions of male perversions, women being invited if they leave their dignity at the door.<br><br> genetically imprinted sexual impulses <br>Making dirty jokes is not a genetically imprinted sexual impulse. And wanting to force one's sexuality onto someone else is comparable to the impulse of wanting to hit people in the face every once in a while: any civilized person knows how to control, and for the largest part diminish such feelings. There is no impossibility of living out sexual impulses in thoroughly respectful and loving ways; men tend to be afraid of it because they think it will make them "soft" and "gay" if they do anything other than hard hot fucking. It's a deep insecurity stemming from a masculinity-glorifying culture.<br><br> Girls don't hold back their sexual 'perversions'. <br>Oh but they do. When did you last hear a kind, respected young girl or woman (say 14 to 20) talk openly about her sexuality with others? She can't, because she will be labeled a slut. Not only by those old-minded conservatives; even the "liberal" who so celebrates sexual promiscuity will get thoughts like "hell yeah, I bet she wants my dick." No she doesn't want your filthy dick, just like you don't want to suck on the clit of that fat girl next to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Men have held economic, social, political, familial, and all kinds of power for the past couple thousand years. Modern society as we know it was built by literal patriarchs, plain and simple.<br><br>But indeed this structure isn't beneficial to every single male. Many males would want to be able to not give a fuck about ideals of masculinity and be as gay and cheerful as they want, sympathizing with girls and women, and this culture is keeping them from doing so.<br><br>E.g. many traps and such on /a/ seem like victims.  I'm one of them. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>FUCK OFF FEMINISTS!!<br>GET THE FUCK OFF MY BOARD!!!!!!!<br>REEeEEeEeeEeEEeeeeeeEEE!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When did you last hear a kind, respected young girl or woman (say 14 to 20) talk openly about her sexuality with others <br>from here on out I'm going to assume that you are a pathetic white knight who has never been in proper contact with an actual female or a ridiculously sheltered woman who had no friends growing up because let me tell you, girls do talk about all sorts of sexual shit around that age</br></br>  <br><br>I like how you started off trying to play the part and tailor your message to your audience, but now you've lapsed into tried-and-tested, ridiculous feminists rhetoric about the patriarchal boogeyman and the noble, spotless plight of the poor victim women it systemically preys upon.

They have a deeply rooted mindset that in a sexual setting, women are commodity, so if a girl puts herself in a sexual setting by talking about her sexuality, it must mean she's making herself public property for fucking. No bit of respect for female sexuality is in place.<br><br><br>That depends entirely on what social circles you've been in. Don't go on assuming that your experience in life in the country you live in is global truth for everyone in the world.<br><br>I've grown up in (the most modern parts of) Turkey, where the situation is still rather bad. As far as I know, most average-modernity countries of Europe aren't much better off, East Europe in part even being much worse. I've also spent some years in Germany, and while I haven't had very big social circles, I haven't heard once of girls and young women being able to openly talk of their sexuality.<br><br>Something tells me the USA isn't exactly better.

Crippled feet are a mark of quality!<br>Not like economically poor women are being exploited through prostitution in every single fucking country that hasn't reached first-world levels modernity yet. Not like brothels in 18th century London weren't full of 10 to 12 year-old girls of poor families.<br>Not like the porn industry has started as through horrible exploitation of women.

I really don't know what to think. My common sense tells me most scientists wouldn't just up and kidnap and torture a person to study supernatural powers.

That's the best part about him but unfortunately it seems like that facet of his personality is already getting sidelined.</br>  <br> not liking alpha prick <br><br>At least it is better than generic beta faggot, like most anime MC's have.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Why will not the normalfag shit.<br>over 40,000 people<br>They heard the radio to the interview with the protagonist of the MC.<br>Pika is my pica, will attend Yuki Ritto, the animated drawing of Disney, Woodpecker and Bugs</br></br></br></br></br>   <br>YuukiRitofag <br>Generic mc auto insertion fag</br></br>  <br>I don't care about generic mc auto insertion fags either.<br><br>But if the other extreme is this wannabe Lelouch, I don't want that either.

He can only possess the body of another person for a short period of time.</br>  <br>Did you have to, did you really have to, ficker?</br>  <br>Eh? What the fuck? Science is the only thing that makes the world truly advance. It's the military and the corporations (true government, the government is just their forced lapdog anyway) that make scientists work for war.</br>  <br> not demonizing Japan <br> in muh american board <br><br>Sure mate.</br></br></br></br>    <br>What do you fucking want then, heh? God.</br>  <br><br>Scientists are paid by the government and other large organizations.<br><br>Large organizations, when they don't have human well-being as a very explicit and serious pursuit, tend to be corrupt simply out of the fact that all the management hierarchies of the organization collectively end up not caring about ethics even if no single person in the management chain would do something majorly unethical on their own terms. The explicit major goal of the organization is making money or something like that, so other things naturally fade out in importance no matter how non-evil every single employee is.<br><br>So really, it's you who's being retarded for taking her wording that literally and not understanding how it can end up being true even if individual scientists nowadays usually tend to be intellectual humans with a perhaps stronger code of ethics than the average Joe. (Hence why academicians and such tend to be SJWs by 4chan standards.)<br><br>Not to mention how things were a thousand fucking times worse in the past, with scientists hired by war-lusting governments doing all kinds of sick shit. Remember Mendelev, the Nazi doctor who did all those horrendous experiments like sewing together the heads of twins and shit?<br><br>Maybe in real-life modern-day Japan the situation wouldn't exactly be as bad as in this anime, but overall the detachment from reality is quite slim. Add to that the fact that she's a naive teenager who perhaps simply underestimates, to some degree, how much "the scientists" care about her brother's therapy (which might not be simple), and you get a thoroughly realistic scene.<br><br><br> alpha prick <br> gets thoroughly BTFO <br>I'm in joy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to insert into Nao.  <br>I agree that Rap deserves the death penalty.</br>  <br>To be honest the only thing stopping me from conducting human experiments in behavioral science is half a dozen international treaties. Scientists are not evil, we're just pragmatic. I know a lot of physicists in ETH that believe LHC is currently being worked too conservatively because it would scare the public/board otherwise. <br><br>Human Cost(present)&gt;Human Cost(future) = Don't do it<br>Human Cost(present)&lt;Human Cost(future) = Do it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Behavioral "science" is not real science.

I'm one too and I'm a hardcore SJW. But then I guess that makes me evil on /a/.<br>Many of them might have emotional detachment from humans though, thinking of themselves as super-rational, when they actually fail to control for their own cognitive biases and don't factor in the inevitable fact of human emotionality when they make decisions that affect others. E.g. see: LessWrong community being partly full of edgy retards.<br><br><br>Whoops, thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes all the powers are flawed<br>just enough extra entertainment for God, but not enough so that a bunch of kids start getting uppity or cause too much damage</br></br>  <br>She's clearly commando there</br>  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  <br>She's the Key version of  Akira. Nao and Yuu will just keep shouting each other's name after the first half of the season. .</br>    <br>That's kinda the point. It's a really old trope that spans countless different media, from anime to American children's live-action TV.</br>  <br>Imouto has purple eyes. Dude.</br>  <br>I really hope MC can protect that smile.

They're so bound up in laws and codes that they can barely do anything without express written permission.

I actually think it is paced just fine (I would probably say the first 2 episodes are pretty fast-paced if anything). And you are looking at someone who much preferred the first half of Steins Gate to the second, so I love slower paced stuff, I may probably prefer that to fast paced anime. Reason I don't like this show is because the writing of this show is just shit.<br><br>None of the characters are interesting. They are actually incredibly generic and maybe it could've worked as a self parody, but it is very clear that the writers intend for us to believe these characters as people and be attached to them the whole way.<br><br>The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever heard in an anime. That entire scene where the little girl talks to her brother (in ep 2, the flashback scene) is some of the most forced and unnatural shit I have ever heard. Honestly that was the point I dropped this show, but throughout both episodes, the dialogue was godawful. Exposition overload.<br><br>Also, I wasn't expecting Glasslip or Charlotte to be anything like Nagi-Asu. Very different settings and stories obviously. But I will say that the things I didn't like about Nagi-Asu were alot more prevalent in both these shows.<br><br>I have heard the show picks up and I really dont care about that because like I said, my issue is with the characters and dialogue (which is always going to be an issue no matter how interesting the story gets) and the fact there is nothing unique in the style of this anime I haven't already seen tons of times in other movies/animes/etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  what  <br>Anon, do you need to lurk a little more?</br>    EP3: 00d, 10h, 32m, 08s    <br>Their WW2 survivors told stories of whitey doctors making them undress to see the kind of injuries radiation had.</br>  <br>I don't see how the characters are (for the most part) generic. I'll take the easy route and say to look at Yuu. A teenage boy who suddenly gets special powers, and the first thing he actually does is start messing around with girls and dicking around by making people he hates fight. Rather than being an anime cliche, it's actually very realistic. He styles himself to be some sort of genius for coming up with the idea of cheating on tests, and yet he's not smart enough to get below perfect scores. He cares about his sister enough to change himself to protect her, but neither of them show any romantic feelings for the other. It's only been two episodes, but I think once he finds his pace he'll go back to being snarky but not harm others like he was before.<br><br>Do you mean Nao talking to her brother about music (which I think was literally the only scene that fits your description)? I'm not sure what issue you had with that, maybe what's pictured about him giving exposition that they're poor? It felt fine to me. Just two siblings who admire each other and tease each other.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much, it's funny when people expect otherwise.</br>  <br>Why should the winners irradiate their own soldiers when perfectly good specimen/victims are living in agony from radiation poisoning anyway?<br><br>Aloe vera won't help that kind of glowing burn.</br></br></br>  <br>You typical fanboy.<br>Naofag will put your fanwank, and watch your dog with Baroto and forced drama there MAL or Reddit.<br>o not contaminate the /a/, with cheap and forced melodrama.</br></br></br>  <br>how many scientists in real life when given an opportunity to operate outside of ethical constraints haven't gone evil? <br>there are ethics boards for a reason.<br><br>granted i also wont argue that not giving one fuck about a humans life doesn't get shit done or understood fast, but god damn.</br></br></br></br>  Test tube cloning and all that should be a reality.

Easily my favourite girl.</br>  Then she's also a main character<br>but her big sister never shows up anymore?<br>Her pyrokinesis was attractive tho</br></br>  Who'd win in a fist fight?  <br>Nao can be invisible to Yusa. Pretty hard to hit someone who you can't see.</br>  <br>My dick is the real winner.</br>  <br> but her big sister never shows up anymore? <br>Why do you think that?</br></br>  Typical Key MC.

It's just modern society has this anti logic, science, and technology.<br><br>You can see this in a lot of mediums like films and video games; not just anime. For example, Avatar it was clear that the viewer was suppose to empathize with the beast while hating on the humans because it's a parrellel to modern history like America claiming the lands of the Native Americans.<br><br>In a lot of JRPG, the "villains" are these logical people that use facts and statistics as to why they need to do their deeds while the heroes entire argument amounts to muh feelings.<br><br>Even looking at real life if you noticed that emotions is a cancerous thing. Over 5,000 years of human history and the only thing that has changed is technology but they still cling to dumb shit like emotions and social constructs like morality as to stop the progress of humanity just so they can continue to live pretty much as cave men.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can watch the ep on animax if you want, but the simulcast isn't until after 39 minutes.</br>  raw is out<br> [Ohys-Raws] Charlotte - 03 (BS11 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4 </br>  <br>Edgy.</br>  <br>I was asking for moonspeakers who watched the stream.<br><br>Mainly, I want to know what the whole deal with the secret base was, and what they were trying to accomplish near the end.</br></br></br>  <br>It just introduced the new character.

So...</br></br>  <br>technology exist to serve humans and make humans lives eaiser and happier. Technological innovation without ethics simply for the sake of technological innovation does not serve that purpose. Technology is a means to an end not and end in of itself.</br>  <br>Nothing even happened this episode.<br><br>Also, was it my imagination, or was something different about the OP this week?</br></br></br>  <br> morality is a social construct <br>There is a definitive definition for morality. Murder and stealing is considered bad by everyone for example.</br></br>  <br>And what do you think the purpose of easier and happier lives is?</br>  <br>did it sound rock-ish?</br>  <br><br>Guy is so burn everything.<br>Misa does not burn with his power.<br>The bitch would die burned</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stem cell research can help a lot of people but moralfags think it's immoral so we can't have it.</br>  <br> unintelligent moralfags think it's immoral <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br> guy <br> his <br>wat</br></br></br>  <br>I meant the visuals.

The two guys were Misa's friends before she died, and they're taking care of her. The whole end part was threatening the big shot with all of their powers (making him think it was all Yusa's doing) so he wouldn't do anything bad to Yusa.</br>  So what are the odds that the "one guy that Nao can trust" turns out to be evil and has organized the school so that all the superpowers can be gathered in one spot for easy access?  <br>Unlike his dog que is reckless, he is a good person.<br>His beloved bitch got punched in the face, because it is unwise to act without thinking.<br>Typical heroine key transvestite</br></br></br>  <br>It's x-men the anime.</br>  <br>You see this shit, sciencefags?

All /a/nons care about is their favorite girl "winning" when the prize is shit.</br>  <br>There's someone who's willingly self insert as Taichi?</br>  <br>I agree.

But stay away from my beloved daughter, looking is alright but no touching allowed. </br>  <br>I loved Baccano but I felt like I needed to watch it twice to really enjoy it</br>  Not even bait. I seriously don't get this show. The art style is bland and all the characters are just tired stereotypes. Also the animation is like a PowerPoint.  <br>You see anon, the problem is just that you have bad taste.</br>  <br>This, dereban was like eating so much caramel chocolate that it becomes disgusting.<br><br> I also ended up liking Iori more, because I like broken girls </br></br></br>  Somebody explain to me what makes Toradora so good because I don't see it.  <br>Iori a  cute .</br>  <br> Responding to obvious bait <br>ISHYGDDT</br></br>  <br>Only normalfags like SAO because it's "cool" and "epic" enough to blind them to its numerous crippling flaws.

At the very least its not uncommon to find some people calling it bad. So I dont think its bait.</br>  <br>Your taste is just plain horrible</br>  <br>Kill me baby. It's not even that popular, but I cannot comprehend how anyone could like it at all.</br>  Fate/anything<br>Raildex anything<br>Jojo</br></br>  <br>The first watchthrough is breathtaking.<br><br>Then you go back at it and realize that only the first arc, besides a few other moments, is worth something and it actually feels rushed.</br></br></br>  I wouldn't call it shit but it's barely above average. Not only does /a/ like it, it's right up there on mal and is apparently loved on reddit (according to /a/).  <br><br>Answer: you are just kinda dumb and dont understand it like some people cant understand math or writing or history. You are just bad at it.</br></br>  any yurishit<br><br>and ZZ gundam</br></br>  <br>The series itself was actually pretty decent - nothing breathtaking, but decent. After they started milking it for what it was worth it started going downhill fast.</br>  <br>Good premise but the characters were too boring.</br>  <br>fair enough</br>  <br>I'd say the first season of JoJo was a decent, fun series, but when SDC started it went downhill pretty quickly.

And a shitton of QUALITY.</br>  <br>The bit where she starts shouting about Luigi.</br>  <br>you should do an episode about log horizion<br>its like sao if sao was good</br></br>  Whenever I see a thread like these I realize that these "good anime" are just good by anime standards.  <br>Angel Beats. Okay, it's wasn't terrible, but at best it was mediocre and I don't get why so many people why like it. And I liked Clannad and Kanon. Must be the people who like to cry when watching anime.</br>  Bullshit Yahari Ore.

Japanese male protagonists are all either unlikable douchebags, annoying faggots or spineless worms.</br></br>  <br>You have a point.<br><br>I just can't seem to settle at least personally with girls mingling among themselves about things I could give less of a shit about.<br><br>Males in the story is a bridge between where it actually becomes somewhat relate-able from a perspective my simple mind can understand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a pretty good point.

I like it, but understand why people don't.</br>  <br>yeah. it went pretty shit when the whole Stand thing became focus</br>  <br>Say what you will about Eva, but recognize that anime would not have hit the mainstream had it not been made. You don't have to like it, but it still deserves respect.</br>  <br>Hibikek is nowhere close to Hyouka.<br><br>Clannad and Air are garbage tier.<br><br>Haruhi and Nichijou are close, but not better.<br><br>K-On is fun and all, but nothing special.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  GTO,<br>Not even trolling I see no appeal in it whatsoever.<br> obnoxious comedy <br> dull characters <br> annoying Gary Stu protagonist whose "flaws" lead only to more samey shitty comedy <br> soapy overly melodramatic ending </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And you like Hyouka?<br><br>That's some shit taste right there.</br></br></br>  Wixoss, I wouldn't call it shit but some people certainly over hyped it.  <br>I watched the first season. The main character is a pretty big fedora tipper, but in a somewhat good way, many people on this website wish they could be like him.<br><br>The show is about a club that helps people in school with various problems, main character was encouraged to join by the teacher because socializing would be good for him or something. Two other members in the club are the two main heroines, neither of them are very likable. The main heroine is an arrogant cunt, bitter because haters have been hating her perfect self her whole life, not much to say about the other chick, seemed like a complete door mat to most people in the class. There is also an otaku with a very minor role and a trap. The final arc was about some school festival, some hater girl starts hating the main heroine more than usual and the whole school turns into an orgy of passive aggressiveness.<br><br>I'd consider picking it up again if it gets a conclusion, you can never count on LNs ever being finished nowadays. People seem to make a pretty big fuss about it here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have watched the first episode three times over the years, seemed like one of those shows you have to get into, but I can't. I don't like Shaft, which is a big reason why I can't get past the first episode.</br>  <br>faggot I hope Onizuka rapes your ass</br>  <br>I watched this show because I hate myself and was holding out hope that the trap would win even though I knew in my heart that he wouldn't.</br>  <br>Wow, that's a bold statement. Don't worry though, /a/ is a safe place. We wouldn't lash out at each other over a mere difference of opinions.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I agree with these. These anime are shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>EVERYTHING YOU LIKE<br>*masturbates furiously*</br></br>  <br>Hyouka.<br>Boring shit that everybody pretends is good.</br></br>  <br>Gunbuster<br><br>It's just boring</br></br></br>  <br>well yeah true, it's good for people for having a shit taste once in a while as long it would help the industry</br>  Madoka and Haruhi. I disregarded the fanbase and gave both a good go, but just couldn't do it. <br><br>Absolute garbage, both of them.</br></br>  Ashita no Joe<br>FLCL<br>Mononoke (TV)<br>Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt<br>Digimon Adventure Movie<br>One Piece: Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island<br>Only Yesterday<br>Gauche the Cellist<br>Chie the Brat<br>My Neighbors the Yamadas<br>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann<br>You Are Umasou<br>Dead Leaves<br>Tatami Galaxy<br>Mind Game<br>Trava Fist Planet<br>Animal Treasure Island<br>Mind Game<br>Diebuster<br>Space Adventure Cobra<br>Wanwa the Doggy<br>Noiseman Sound Insect</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lain kinda sucks imo</br>  Anything popular just because it is popular, like Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Future Diary, etc.    <br>That was a nice video.  I'll take a look at your channel to see your overall content. </br>  Oh boy, I'm going in on this one. Prepare yourself for possible TL;DR<br><br> Strike Witches <br>I tried watching this anime three times because I feel I need to give anime more chances. I don't hate fanservice outright but the way it's done here is obnoxious. The episodes were formulaic and there general 'WTF' moments; Why would you send the Military to fight the Neuroi though it's proven that the Strike Witches were the only ones who can defeat them?<br><br> Hyouka <br>The first 'mystery' was stupid and I hate the characters.<br><br> Kill La Kill <br>Everyone comes at me for this one. The plot was questionable, the fights were sloppily coordinated, and the humor was obnoxious and repetitive. I'll never forgive the internet for hyping this mediocrity through the roof Fall 2013.  I liked TTGL a lot so this was just plain insulting <br><br> Shokugeki no Souma <br>Another anime I tried to give more than one chance. I watched the first ep, seen the ridiculous foodgasms and stopped the player there. A few people told me it does tone it down later on. It does, but it was still redundant as hell after I attempted to read the manga up to at least 40 chapters, my interest waned. The MC is a generic protagonist and the side characters didn't stand out either.<br><br> Needless <br>Watered down TTGL laced with pee. I hated the three girls (loli, mute, and that blue haired broad) congratulations for being the few characters that made me outright drop an anime.<br><br> Shimoneta <br>Yeah, a seasonal one had to go here too. I'm surprised at how well it's received so far though. It was vastly ignored pre season on the count of the manga and LN never being picked up by a TL group. Not to mention PV threads on /a/ didn't last very long.<br><br>Anyway, this anime is the embodiment of sex jokes made by a grade school kid thinking it's cool. Before you say 'your humor must be refined and mature' refer to TTGL above; I like silly anime as well. The thing about sex jokes is they have to be done right just like with fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruhi was original when it came out. Then people tried to copy its success and now it's just one out of many.</br>  <br>Madoka.</br>  <br> milking it <br>The only things to come out is the ova, movie (just focuses on information), and new VN + Info (which doesnt progress past the main story) .The studio literally doesnt want to make a direct sequel because they're afraid they'll ruin the series. Steins gate 0 is a sequel, but it's just info about what happens to the okabe that calls himself. That's it. It's just giving us more info.</br></br>  <br>You must have missed the real fan-service in Strike Witches.</br>  <br> i like shit <br><br>That's nice but could you stop posting it?</br></br></br>  <br>I was too young to notice this the first time I watched it. Time for a rewatch.</br>  <br>It's shit. We just really like twintails.</br>  <br><br>That was one of the positive things about it IMO; the references to real life stuff ie the witches being based off real pilots (a bud of mine who loves this says one of the original pilots seen SW and thought it was insulting) and the thing you just pointed out now.<br><br>Plus it has decent porn. If I had to pick a favorite witch it would be Francesca because  sleeping lolis are my fetish </br></br></br></br>  Aria<br>LOGH<br>Monster<br>GITS: SAC<br>Seirei no Moribito<br>Berserk<br>Twelve Kingdoms<br>Gintama<br>Great Teacher Onizuka<br>FMA: Brotherhood<br>Steins;Gate<br>Fate/Zero</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can you people saying Steins gate please explain why you don't like it? Why have none of you said Chaos Head or Robotics notes as well? Surely it's not because Steins is popular?    <br>I'd give it a 3/5. Would have liked it much more if they'd just stayed within the original game.</br>  <br>Dialogue is literally meme shit, characters are caricatures, plot uses pseudo-science, practically harem, MAL aesthetic</br>  <br> MAL aesthetic <br>What does the art style have to do with MAL?</br></br>  <br>It's an anime then. Got anything else?</br>  <br>I hated the side characters and how much focus they got.</br>  <br>Wow, that's some awful taste you got then.</br>  <br>Fuck you. How about you tell us your favourite shows then?</br>  <br>Came here to post this.<br>It's boring, repetitive and dumb. <br>I don't get why people praise it as intellectual and stuff like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto: Shippuden<br>Bleach<br>One Piece<br>SAO<br><br>None of this stupid shit you guys pretend to like</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "AM I FUNNY YET?" </br>  <br><br>Glasses was best.</br></br>  <br> Gankutsuou, Kaiji, Ergo Proxy, Planetes are among my favourites.  </br>  <br><br>It's funny because it's outlandish as hell.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br>Anime fightans.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br>Phantom Breaker.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br>Valkyria Chronicles.</br>  <br>I haven't seen this show, people say all the time that the animation was bad, but the screenshots I see look fine.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br><br> league of legends  Zelda and Pokemon are my favorite franchises though.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br> tfw realized all my obscure games I like on old Windows OSes will never get on emulators, get remakes, or anything like that simply due to obscurity, so when software advances past those games I will never be able to play them ever again, it's already happened with many of my games <br><br>gaming has lost much of it's magic for me</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br>At the moment, Hearthstone</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br>Battle Raper.

VOTOMS doesn't, yet Gundam remains the most popular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls swoon over Chirico and instead of Chirico's mech being plot armor  he himself has more plot armor than like 10 Jesus Yamatos combined, he has literal plot armor, the Abnormal Survivor stuff is as DEM as it gets. .</br>  I don't get how people love Gundam.<br><br>Every series is like a 7.5/10 or less apart from Turn A.</br></br>  Zero and UBW.<br>I'll throw in the FSN visual novel as well. It was shit too.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br>Arma, Ace Combat, Freespace 2, Mechwarrior 4. Mainly going back through the classics at the moment since nothing modern is grabbing me.<br><br>I have exactly the same feeling, but I'm more of a Patlabor fan. I appreciate 0079 for trying to be more than a thing selling toys to kids and 08th MS Team has its appeal, but so much of it is the same fucking thing.<br>Patlabor on the other hand has a female pilot who loves her job, mechs that actually feel vaguely plausible and a setting that stops to think about what giant robots would mean for society.</br></br></br></br>  <br>TTGL? not so good</br>  <br>True enough, but I did enjoy the scenes where parts of the mechs would blow up. Also, Chirico gets his shit slapped pretty badly a couple of times, which is more than your usual Gundam copy's MC. At least they had the decency to outright claim that Chirico is Das Übermench on top of his backstory of joining the army in his teenage years and entering special forces by the time he's 19.</br>  <br>Because they decided to have a cast twice the size do half as much stuff.</br>  <br>Kokoro Connect was "Forced Drama: The Anime"<br><br>I know that term get thrown around a lot, but jesus christ, that show redefines it.<br><br>There was also the Ijime Connect thing with a voice actor. I already forget, but there's a pastebin that you could probably find on google about it. I've actually seen people use that to say "nuh-uh, you're using that drama as an excuse to hate this show"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The bullying was bullshit but the show was great.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128253599 <br> video games <br>Music is a much better hobby imo, whether you're actually making it or just listening to it</br></br>  <br>but it is true, the bad guy waves his magic wand because he is bored and breaks the weakest link in the group which is always one of the three girls and they cause drama when that happens.</br>  <br>I never understood how people have listening to music as a main hobby. I like listening to music a lot, but I wouldn't call it a hobby it's just something I like to do. There must be some visual element for me to call something a hobby most of the time.</br>  <br>  breaks the weakest link in the group which is always Iori and she causes drama when that happens <br>Having no love interest really fucked her character over. She just redoes the same arc every time the show focuses on her.</br></br>  <br>Iori had the most focus and always produced drama, but Inaba and the other girl were in the drama spotlight in one arc each if I recall correctly.</br>  <br>Whenever I see a show and I hear one of the two bullies or see them credited for a show, I am always reminded of that incident. It's not like I am some super anti-bully, but those two have gotten a permanent label in my mind that gives me a less positive opinion on them.</br>  <br> FLCL <br>1v1 ME RIGHT NOW MOTHERFUCKER I'LL BREAK YOUR SHIT OFF NIGGER I BET YOU HATE FUN THAT'S IT ISN'T IT YOU HATE FUN NIGGER LET ME GET MY FUCKING HANDS ON YOU ONE GOOD TIME I'LL FUCK YOU UP YOU HEAR ME LITTLE ASS NIGGER I'LL FUCK YOU UP</br></br>  <br>Wasn't there a movie coming out? Jesus christ, who watches that shit and actually enjoys it?</br>  <br>Mitsudomoe a thousand times. I felt so uncomfortable watching it. I refuse to believe this shit actually aired on tv.</br>  <br> plot uses pseudo-science <br> practically harem <br>I can understand not liking harems and pseudo-science even if they're done well but<br><br> literally meme shit <br> characters are caricatures <br>Did you even watch it<br><br>Also what the fuck does MAL aesthetic mean</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So why are these threads always so full of bait?<br>I mean really, I feel like its a bunch of dank memers saying "X masterpiece is actually shit upboat me"</br>  <br>nice voice there, anon</br>  Utena. It's not shit, but for something that's supposed to be one of the greatest anime of all time, it's pretty dull. <br><br><br><br>My niggas. I like most of the UC Gundam stuff, but I've never understood why it's as popular as it is considering how many mech shows are so much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2nd season was absolute cancer</br>  <br>Wasn't the pilot who saw it Chuck Yeager? Most of the pilots died ages ago.<br> Like the one Sanya is based off of. She died in the war. </br></br>  <br><br>I don't remember since he gave me the tidbit years back.</br></br>  <br><br>It is said if you don't like K-On, it's because you don't have any friends, and so can't relate to the themes of friendship in it.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>All these.<br><br><br>Special mention to basically any last KyoAnus show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are either gay, or so incredibly sexist that you will never, ever, get a real girlfriend.</br>  <br>I speak in korinefag language, plebeian. Only the truly enlightened can understand me.</br>  <br>Tumblr pls go</br>  I don't think its shit, but I can't see how anybody can say NGE is their favorite anime without coming off as pretentious and only claim its a masterpiece because of how hard it tries to be deep.  <br>Seriously. If it was made today and not fueled by nostalgia and its "legacy", everyone would think it was retarded and hate it.</br>  <br>because it is THE GREATEST LOVE STORY EVER TOLD</br>  <br>That's just every modern tsun ever.</br>  Death parade was really bad after episode 1, not sure why people fawned over it.<br><br>Also, any show about highschool/college music. IT'S ALWAYS ALL THE SAME SHIT</br></br>  Easily the most overrated anime on /a/<br><br> shitty K-ON clone design <br> shitty Aria's character ripoff <br> muh Amazing grace <br> muh pee joke </br></br></br></br></br>      <br> implying I don't  <br> implying I would want to fuck an old man <br>Cute boys should only be with other cute guys or dominant girls</br></br></br>  <br>This artist is /r9k/ personified.</br>    <br>this</br>  Does anyone care about Nappa, or is he just a meme character?
