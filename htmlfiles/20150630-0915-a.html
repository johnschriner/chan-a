I'd probably do it without her consent, as she would be even more turned on by it. I'd grab her after school in the classroom alone, and I'll fuck her hard from behind next to the window.<br><br> Alice <br>I would fuck Alice's mouth to the point where she would feel like she's choking on my dick. After I cream her, I'll grab her legs and put it up her butt. She will eventually forget she has a pussy, and beg me to do her in the ass every time. <br><br> Ayaya <br>Aya would be the only girl that doesn't really enjoy it. I would probably have to beat her into submission, which might get her a bit hot since's she's a sub for Yoko. While's she gasping for I'd start fucking her doggy style and pushing her face to the floor.<br><br> Yoko <br>Lots of foreplay; a lot of kissing and caressing. I would lick her whole body and service her breasts for a while. I'd finish her off in missionary, with lots of hugging and neck kissing.<br><br> Karen <br>She wouldn't really understand what's going on, she will just know that I'm making her feel good. I'd start by having her on all fours and fingering her ass and pussy at the same time. After I'm done, I would fuck her reverse cowgirl.<br><br> Honoka <br>Another troublesome girl. To save time, I'd just grab her hands and tie them above her head. After that I would turn her around and fuck her like Shinobu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why are the mosaics so small when they actually in high schools?  <br>Smack</br>  <br> ctrl+f adopt <br> 0 results <br><br>What a disappointment.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Trying to adopt a girl from a stable family <br>Yeah good luck with that even in 2DLand</br></br>  <br><br><br>How does this gaijin fit in so well?</br></br></br>  <br>be</br>  <br>pat</br>  Isn't HS a bit slow on the subs today?

I've seen so many people praise KyoAni as the pinnacle of anime. Though content wise these have been adapting series with mediocre writing. Animation wise they look appealing but it isn't considered good animation because it mostly backgrounds, shot with massive amounts of light everywhere. And it's known that KyoAni have below average production values. Now they do have a few gems such as Haruhi, Disappearance Movie, Full Metal Panic especially Fumoffu, and Hyouka which can be subjective because the story is really boring depending on the person. However they do adapt a lot of mediocre series that have terrible writing in it.<br><br>Now I'm not saying KyoAni is a bad Studio because they are far from it, but why do some people think they are the best Studio? If you look at their content it says otherwise.</br></br>  Because plebs like digital filters and over-animated turd.  <br>Just imagine how would look Yahari's last episode of KyoAni had animated it.</br>  <br>Shit?<br>Yahari season 2 is already better animated than anything KyoAni ever made.</br></br>  Because Clannad and Haruhi  <br>Kyani is a good studio, not my favourite but still. <br>Like comedy show.</br></br>  <br>No it is not. Kyoani doesn't have one thing, creativity.</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  <br>Yahari have sakuga animators.<br>KyoAni doesn't.</br></br>  <br> why do some people think they are the best Studio <br>It's not. Ufotable is.</br></br>  <br> over-animated </br>  <br>Why are the eyes so suck before 2008 ?</br>  <br>Look at this and tell me it isn't over-animated.</br>  <br> Why Do Some People Like Things I Don't Like: The Thread </br>  <br> Ufotable <br>Ufotable is easily the most over-rated studio, yes.</br></br>  They are the Nintendo of /a/.  <br>go back to your cancer thread yaharifag</br>  Oh boy another studio war thread. <br>Can't wait for all the "lol kyoanus moeshit" shitpost.</br>  Why are half the posts in this thread, including the OP, written like it was an ESL at the keyboard?  <br>how were they allowed to get away with that 2005 face</br>  <br><br> animation in an animated medium is bad </br></br>  Nichijou is conveniently missing from your image and argument, so that's why you don't know.  <br>Because Key.</br>  <br>Keyshit designs.</br>  <br>This should be the norm, instead shitty studios skip frames and put shitty in between animation and people think it's actually acceptable.</br>  <br>You're over-retarded</br>  <br>Its Key shit, what do you expect? They fixed the faces by now, but overall still same shit.<br><br>Charlotte by PA Works this season is another revival of that cancer. Thanks God KyoAni stopped whoring themself to them.<br><br>Also, if you think thats ugly - see Higurashi.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's distracting from the most important element of any storytelling medium, the story.</br>  <br>It isn't over-animated.</br>  <br>The only bad thing I see is some poor movement of the characters relative to the background early on when she starts running.</br>  <br> over-animated <br>god damn you're retarded</br></br>  <br>It's not the work of the animators to fix shitty scripts</br>  <br>What about Full Metal Panic though? It's in 2003 and still has good animated eyes.</br>  They're not even the best modern studio.  <br>Why are you even watching anime in the first place? Read the LNs or manga if you don't like pictures moving, faggot.</br>  <br>Holy shit, you're too much of a pleb for LN adaptations about high schoolers playing instruments. I didn't think this was possible.</br>  <br>I wonder where they took the photo shoots for this scene.</br>  <br>That's like saying literature would be better as powerpoint slides of the plot and themes in bulletpoints because prose is distracting.</br>  <br>meh, $hinbo's gimmicky animation style gets old quite fast</br>  <br> before 2008 <br>K-On! eyes aren't better. Only good eyes KyoAni ever produced are Hyouka and now Euphonium.</br></br>  <br> anime <br> storytelling medium <br><br>Top b8</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't dislike animation.<br>I hate when it's done poorly and unbalanced.</br></br>  <br> I'm not trying shitpost or anything <br>Yes you are.</br></br>  <br>Because they didn't have a style that made money back then. Keyshit gave them money so they keep doing that even in other anime (see haruhi 2006) after that k-on was the one who made money so they kept doing that kind of designs after that (see harui 2009 or hyouka) <br>Amagi and Hibike are dfiferent though.</br></br>  <br>They did.<br>KyoAni traces photo.</br></br>  <br>Then you must love KyoAni, they rarely do it poorly and always retain the same quality all around their series.</br>  <br>Literally everything is better than am I kawaii uguu. Fucking Aku no Hana's faces were still better than that.</br>  <br>Its Uji, the small town Kyoto Animation itself is located. If you paid attention Hibike school is "KitaUJI", its located in same time.<br><br>Thats one of main reasons KyoAni picked about this novel in the first place - since its written by local about the area they work and live.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how that one would look with one of those 60fps interpolators.</br>  <br>Some people say that KyoAni anime have bad writing. I disagree, they're only simple, and being simple doesn't make something bad. <br>Yesterday I was watching Sora no Woto and started to think about what would be if it had a more simple writing, without those events, like Kanata's fever in episode 3 to deliver exposition. Regularly anime writing have plenty of well know events and situations, but KyoAni have the capacity to make these things more subtle, hence the accusations about nothing happening towards some shows.</br></br>  <br>I thought Tamako did pretty well in that department.</br>  <br> Euphonium <br>Too bad they fucked up on the cheeks with that pinkish dot shit. Looks like they have cancer.</br></br>  <br> shit isn't just flapping mouths, slow pans behind the heads and detail shots of the face <br> has more than once scene and 3 shots per minute <br> over-animated <br><br>Over-animated sounds like an oxymoron anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  HARUHI S3<br>FULL METAL PANIC S3<br><br>NEVER<br>EVER!<br><br>NEVER <br>EVER!<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>Thanks for your attention.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> done poorly <br>That was quite well done, though.<br><br><br>I think I would have some sort of seizure trying to watch it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the animation professors I had back in college was ex-Disney, he was a 2D animator who worked on a lot of their films for years and years. He started there in the early '80s when Bluth still worked at Disney, and he hated Bluth. He distinctly remembers Don Bluth having a group of friends/followers in a sort of clique in the animation department, who were very haughty and unpleasant to everybody else. The group also liked to 'outdo' each other with their animation, trying to trump each other with intricacy and stuff. The whole group left with Bluth when he did.<br><br>My prof still wanted to give him a chance and went to see Secret Of NIMH in theaters when it came out, but he walked out after about ten minutes. His reason: "The damn crow wouldn't stop moving". He always stressed how there was a time and place for certain animation and how animators needed to know when to NOT animate, and Bluth's over-animation of everything drove him crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>There is some videos when you see where Kyoani took their photos. <br>There is one for Hibike.</br></br>  <br>You're like that guy who calls people tryhards if they put any amount of effort into something.</br>  <br>Complaining about "moeshit" in Kyoani anime is old, the new hotness is shitposting about "forced drama" and "forced animation".</br>  <br>Good old MS Paint VNs.</br>  <br>Your teacher tastes in animation don't mean shit in the grand scheme of things.</br>  <br>Buy a book faggot. Story shouldn't be the only reason to watch something animated. Unless you are idiot.</br>  KyoAni's animation is like Micheal Bay's movie.<br>KyoAni is trying too hard to make everything look pretty and fluid.<br>But when you made everything special, nothing is special.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2TH<wbr>Vvshvq0Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  The only thing I would call "forced animation" or "over-animation" were some of Nichijou's gags.  <br>Ufotable is like Michael bay, all filters and action.<br>Kyoani is like Nolan, all filters and PRETENTIOUS storytelling.</br></br>  <br> But when you made everything special, nothing is special. <br>The struggle is real... <br>So the right thing to do is only do well one and another scene and let everything else look sakuga?</br></br></br>  <br>Nichijou has a lot visual gags... so why would you want to make them worse?</br>  <br>Sounds like he felt slighted somehow and had to make up something to complain about.</br>  <br> let everything else look sakuga <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>I agree with Ufotable-Bay. I don't agree with KyoAni-Nolan - Nolan's pretentiousness (which is pretty minor compared to a lot of other filmmakers, to be honest) is in his plots' sense of self-importance, not really his style, and KyoAni's plots don't really pretend to be important.</br>  <br>Gee, it's almost like the point of most of the gags in Nichijou was to make simple, mundane things be so over-the-top that it was ridiculous</br>  <br> KyoAni <br> Pretentious storytelling <br><br>What? Was K-On, Amagi or Nichijou too complex for your little brain that you need to call them pretentious?</br></br></br></br>  <br> pretentious <br>Outside of perhaps Hyouka, I don't see how anything done recently by KyoAni could be labelled pretentious.</br></br>  <br>KyoAni`s difference from other studios is - they love what they do. Animation, characters, stories they do.<br><br>Others just forced to slave work on whatever given to them not giving a fucks and if possible pushing it all on north korean slaves.<br><br>So no, from begining, KyoAni is the antipod to the "hollywood" like Tokyo anime industry.<br><br>They are rural, indie "we do what we want!" studio. Also success made them grow to one of biggest studios in industry.<br><br>Madhouse can make 1 anime they like in X years, doing shit rest of time (not to forget 7 years of hand drawn animation!!). KyoAni can do it every season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember everyone. <br><br><br>Inability to handle even minor amounts of sensory stimulation is a common trait of autism. It's why so many autists have to keep the walls of their rooms completely blank.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani <br> Pretentious storytelling <br>You w0t</br></br></br>  They are consistent in terms of quality.<br>And they have cute girls.<br>Not my personal favorite but if it has the Kyoani name I'll most likely watch it.</br></br>  <br>But Hyouka was pretty straighforward</br>  <br>I personally think it's the expressions that moves my heart. It's subtle, yet it can makes me feel how exactly the character feels currently. <br><br>Even in K-ON, for example, when they first go to the stage, you can feel how the audiences below are very silent and although the HTT girls are smiling, it's apparent that all of them looks pretty nervous.<br><br>They don't need to make the girls saying/monologuing "I-I-I'm nervous, doushio?" on the stage. You can FEEL it from the atmosphere and their subtle expressions (although they are keeping their smiles).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one I'd call pretentious is Hibike, but even that is more melodramatic than anything.</br>  <br> we do what we want <br> Nothing but LN adaptations and slice of life the two biggest trends in the market right now <br><br>Yeah, sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The people who like a majority of Kyoto Animation shows probably had little to no friends growing up. Now there's this animation studio with high production values releasing highschool sol content that these lonely people can self insert into. They are compensating for their own bad memories and history by watching others live what they perceive as an ideal fantasy.</br>  <br>I totally agree. Here's another example.</br>  <br>yeah I know, but similarly to how Hachiman's struggles are labelled as pretentious by some, I wouldn't be surprised if they would apply the same logic to Oreki's.</br>  Why is Nichijou left out.<br><br><br><br> over-animated <br> It's distracting from the most important element of any storytelling medium, the story. <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it pretentious?</br>  <br> they love what they do <br>More like they loved getting paid.</br></br>  <br>Nice projection buddy</br>  <br>The waifu animators at KyoAni hated making FMP.<br><br>They make no FMP or similar shows no more and do animate their cute daugtherus instead. Living a life and not giving a fucks (should have felt good telling Key and Kadokawa to fuck off).</br></br></br>  <br>Pretentious animation </br>  <br>Just having more drama than usual, and I found most of the drama unbelievable or way too exaggerated.</br>  <br>Animator Expo is for animators to jerk off to their animation skill so it's okay here.</br>  <br>They were doing that before the trends kicked in.</br>  <br>How can animation be pretentious?</br>  <br>So how close was I to perfectly describing your life?</br>  <br>KyoAni did great disservice to anime, but proving VN adaptations can be popular.<br><br>Thankfully they moved on from that shit, but neverless that did great harm and effects of it continue until now.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch Ping Pong, Tatami Galaxy, Mononoke, House of Dead Leaves etc.</br>  <br>I don't see what is pretentious about Hibike.<br><br>I agree with the melodrama to some extent, and to be honest I'm mildly disappointed about the last few episodes too. The first ~8 episodes did a very good job of showing a rather somber highschool life. Of course, that isn't to suggest there wasn't any drama, but most of it was handled pretty well without any unnecessary reactions by any of the cast.<br><br>A good example would be in episode 8 with Hazuki. Instead of this blowing up into a large issue, they were still able to get the impact of her exchange with Shu1 across to the viewer. I thought that perhaps Midori's reaction in ep 9 was a bit farfetched, but even that was cooled down by something around the lines of Kumiko and Midori realizing that Hazuki would rather bottle up her emotions and allow them to dissipate than drag others into the conflict.<br><br>The drama I didn't like was between Kaori and Ribbons. The way Kaori is handled is rather good, but Ribbons escalates the conflict into something much more dramatic than it needed to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's almost as if it was an exposition for animation.</br></br>  <br> Nichijou <br> Over-animated <br>That's still lightyears behind golden era. If anything, the quality in Nichijou should be status quo today since technology makes it possible to cut a fuckload of corners in production but since the industry is a rat race with dozens of studios constantly working on shit that's why we get flounder mouthflaps in 95% of anime released annually.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe with the SoL fad, but Haruhi aired alongside stuff like ZnT and Shana</br>  <br>Just because it's different doesn't mean it's pretentious. Animation can't pretend to be anything other than animation.</br>  <br>The drama is more unbelievable than Chuunibyou?<br><br> Actually Hibike was one of my favorite KyoAni. Well, the atmosphere is pretty exhausting but I can relate since I've felt how it feels being a freshman in a competitive strict school, with everyone's interactions feel pretty distant.  </br></br></br>  <br> House of Dead Leaves </br>  <br>Animation can "pretend" to be "artistic", when it goes for specific visual style over the others that can do it just as well for no purpose.<br><br>The definition of abstract, absurd, distorted and psychodelic is pretentious.</br></br></br>  <br> House of Dead Leaves <br>That would be the weirdest animation style mash-up of all time.</br></br>  <br>If anything proving LN adaptions to be an avenue caused a billion times more damage than VN adaptions. VNs are at least a completely product or end on a note which has a "safe" stopping point for a season, while LNs are a fucking mess because they go on forever and nobody has a damned clue where to end the season at so you get horrifically bad pacing and cliffhanger endings up the ass.</br>  <br>The drama in the first season was handled pretty well even if it kinda came out of nowhere.<br><br>The least we talk about S2 the better...</br></br></br>  <br>B-but KyoAni made Haruhi, Lucky Star, Clannad, K-On, and Chuunibyou.T-they are best studio for giving us best girls and animus. Y u so med about god-tier animus in history? Just look at them.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was kind of stretching the word pretentious but it is mostly melodrama.<br>The only drama I had a problem with is Kumiko's recent problems with playing a music piece and Reina's entire character, who comes off as a complete Mary Sue at times.<br><br><br>I thought the whole depression thing and trying to run away from problems was pretty believable, though the last couple episodes in the first season felt a lot of different than the rest of the episodes before it and I didn't like it.<br>I don't remember anything from Ren though, honestly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> when it goes for specific visual style over the others that can do it just as well for no purpose <br><br>The purpose is to differentiate itself from other animated works. If you try to read into it deeper than this, then it's you who's being pretentious, not the animation.</br></br></br>  I'm <br><br><br>Ah, I agree about Ribbon, though. How she just cry loudly after the selection feels exaggerrated.</br></br></br>  <br> Animation can "pretend" to be "artistic", when it goes for specific visual style over the others that can do it just as well for no purpose. <br>But anon, if multiple visual styles would do just as well, you will always be picking a specific one over the others.</br></br>  <br> Bitch and moan when anime adaption takes liberties with the manga's artstyle <br> Call an adaption pretentious because it actually does faithfully adapts the source material's artstyle <br>What the fuck do you want</br></br></br>  <br>They make "cute girls" that appeal to those who like Kyoani.</br>  <br>LN adaptations were done successfully way before KyoAni. They were done forever, also now market share of them is greatly increased.<br><br>VNs are not a complete product - its in 99% shitty mess of mastrubatory (and i dont mean erotic), and 1% just things that could have been decent books if were done by proper writers instead of hacks that have no idea about story composition and litterature principes.<br><br>LNs on other hand, were actually big improvement for anime at first - since majority anime being manga adaptations, and manga due format being quite limited in terms of storytelling and depth. LNs were just better suited for longer, more intricate stories and settings.<br><br>So the problem is not LNs themselves, but the fact that Kadokawa and Bunco instead of adapting LNs with good stories, churn out generic "boy gets into magic academy and runs into girl" shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The purpose is to differentiate itself from other animated works. <br>Thats the definition of pretentious.<br> characterized by assumption of dignity or importance, especially when exaggerated or undeserved: </br></br></br>  <br> Good <br> LNs <br><br>No such thing</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nolan makes actual good movies though.</br></br>  <br>Sure is massive LN bias in here</br>  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br></br>  <br>LNs are ruining the industry.</br>  <br>meant </br>  <br>I wonder how does it feel for the author.<br>Deko, Touka, and Sleepy-chan are anime originals.<br>Satone is the real character that she wrote.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how something like that is necessarily pretentious. There are a lot of experimental shorts with good layers of depth. Obviously that doesn't suggest all of it would have a worthwhile message, but I don't see how it is at all a bad thing for there to be an outlet for young talent to express themselves.<br><br>Something pretentious in anime would be like Ergo Proxy. There is a lot of focus on atmosphere, symbols, etc, but very little actual depth, or any coherent message.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, the father problem also wasn't in the novel.</br>  <br>I don't think differentiating itself equals that. You're the one who's making that connection.</br>  <br>Baccano<br>Bungaku Shōjo<br>Dirty Pair<br>Full Metal Panic!<br>Haruhi Suzumiya<br>Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere<br>Humanity Has Declined<br>Kino's Journey<br>The Legend of the Legendary Heroes<br>Spice and Wolf<br>Slayers<br>Toradora!<br>Welcome to the N.H.K.<br><br>Just to name a few.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sleepy-chan was added in later LNs. So the writer did like the changes.<br><br>VNs and LNs both can be bad or good. It's just that doing an LN is easier. The thing is that the Nips can't write for shit whatever the medium might be. They don't have any literary value in their whole history. I sometimes wish Italians were in charge of anime.</br></br></br>  <br>This doesn't even look good. When she's turning the corner the background animation doesn't even match up. The framing itself doesn't even look good, which isn't animation, but it looks like they just tried to shove as much stupid shit in the frame as possible.</br>  <br>How do you know if Japs have good literature or not if you've never read a Japanese book? Western literature is more notable because Western culture is the dominant culture of the modern world. LN and VN's are aimed otaku and suffer from bad translations most of the time, so you can't generalize it like that.</br>  <br>NHK is a novel, isn't it?</br>  <br><br>these are the people who post on /a/</br></br>  <br>I took Lit 101 and 201, Foreign Lit and Lit history back in college to get through IT. We got some of the presumably best Nip books and they were shit. Like worse than African and Muslim literature shit.</br>  <br>I`d love proper novel adaptations, LNs mostly cant compare to real books at all - but those are really rare.<br><br>Each medium - original, manga, LN`s, brings well needed and good stuff to anime industry.<br><br>VNs and video game adaptations are commercial cancer though. Then again - it does not mean others are except from it: shitload of generic LNs, weak manga and shallow originals proves it.<br><br>Hardest for anime by far is proper novel adaptations (though thats hard for normal movies as well). That much has to do with episodic nature of anime and hardship of executing or omiting narration and descriptions of which is there a lot. Good studio still can do that, making their shows quite nuanced and turning all the depth of the book into visual details and storytelling (rather than just retelling its words).<br><br>LNs are lot easier, since they are lot easier written and dialogue heavy, plus created for more episodic and shorter format.<br><br>Manga is very limited by publishing format - weekly, monthly, bimonthly and limited dialogue/exposition/description: litterally dictating the format of its stories. No matter the talent, storytelling quality drops when you have to pace it through regular chapters and cliffhangers.<br><br>Original shows one one side are breth of fresh air and experiment - on other mostly lack in storytelling and depth of world: since once again, format dictates content and production focus shifts.<br><br>Some studios tried to break out of that cycle by making OAVs or long 45 minute episodes of multiple-movies instead of regular TV shows: but thats exceptions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> VNs and LNs both can be bad or good. <br>Name a good VN and its adaptation. You cant. If you think you can, means your brain had rotten and you`ve become zombie that never read an actual book and thinks badly written otaku shit is acceptable.</br></br>  <br>Is that the Animator Expo with Bahi JD and Hiroyuki Okiura?</br>  <br>http://global.britannica.com/art/Ja<wbr>panese-literature<br><br> Both in quantity and quality, Japanese literature ranks as one of the major literatures of the world, comparable in age, richness, and volume to English literature, though its course of development has been quite dissimilar. The surviving works comprise a literary tradition extending from the 7th century ad to the present; during all this time there was never a “dark age” devoid of literary production. <br><br>Sounds like bullshit to me, faggot.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>You presumably got some Mishima or Kawabata, and if you dislike either of them, you're taste is shit.</br>  <br>Fate Stay Night.</br>  Because this  <br>Yeah, it's the last one he listed.<br><br><br><br><br>I have to agree with this. The problem isn't the medium itself but the way it is used to appeal to the Otaku market makes the majority of adaptations schlockfests. <br><br>If anything, novels are the format that can most successfully be adapted into anime, as the setting and details are all listed for you in the text. <br><br>LoGH is a good example of how well the two mediums can work with eachother (I know LoGH isn't a LN but it's the same sort of idea).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>White Album 2</br></br>  <br>If you want someone to take a bate, least be less obvious.<br><br>Overrated overdramatic (like all VNs) generic soap opera, only rated high by its cancer fans since they dont watch actual television to realize its no difference in anything from what Japanese housewives watch.</br></br></br>  I don't get why people get offended by the term "over-animated". Sure it's a term designed to bait, but there is an actual essence behind the term. Fluid animation is not the be-all end-all of animation, and increasing the number of keyframes in an animation doesn't always make it look better. Although one of the huge uses of limited animation is cost-savings, it can still be used for artistic intentions, and some choppy but stylistic animation can look better than "fluid" animation. I myself am not a fan of the over fluid animation you typically see in amateur shorts since they move the character and camera around so much just to prove that they can fluidly animate that it becomes distracting and hard to follow the motions.  Somebody call the sakuga experts.  <br> especially Fumoffu <br>Opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>All we need are more actual novel adaptations like Tatami Galaxy and LoGH. LN's have always been the realm of otaku pandering shit.</br>  <br> 作画 <br>It just means the frame is animated, fucking tryhards. Throwing in a romanised term like that is pretty pointless. Why stop at 作画 when you could be pretending to know shit and start throwing around terms like 映画撮影、画題、画像処理、etc. etc. etc?</br></br>  <br>Hibike is an actual award winning novel and it's shit. Nips can't into prose.</br>  <br> http://global.britannica.com/art/J<wbr>apanese-literature</wbr> <br>You know that shit doesn't discredit any literature of any civilization right? Even Moors literature is highly regarded according to Britannica. And that was the shittiest Arab works.</br></br>  <br>Why not call it 'forced animation'?</br>  <br>Forced animation is a meme.<br>Over animating is a real thing.</br></br>  <br>So is Twilight. <br><br>Also, the adaptation probably doesn't do the source material justice since KyoAni added unnecessary yuri-pandering shit that wasn't in the actual novel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Raging unadulterated fanboyism that goes back to the days of Haruhi and extremely limited experience with shit beyond the late night anime scene are my best bets. IMO they do the same kind of played out moe school romance anime that pretty much any other studio does except maybe slightly flashier.</br></br>  <br> You know that shit doesn't discredit any literature of any civilization right? <br><br>Exactly, retard. Each civilization has their own merits when it comes to literature. You cannot judge something you aren't familiar with. Japanese literature isn't popular due to it's main characteristics:<br><br> Japanese literature can be difficult to read and understand, because in many ways the written Japanese reflects certain peculiarities of the spoken language. Statements are often ambiguous, omitting as unnecessary the particles of speech which would normally identify words as the subject or object of a sentence, or using colloquial verb forms from a specific region or social class. Special language used to depict gender, age, social status, or regional origins is often the only clue as to who is speaking or being spoken about in a sentence. In many cases the significance of a simple sentence can only be understood by someone who is familiar with the cultural or historical background of the work. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The background image slides around a lot and the blur goes into overdrive around 0:08 I noticed when she turns the corner. They're probably having a hard time lining the photos up exactly or are using the same photo only trying to do some trickery to make it look like it covers more area than it actually does. It's a bit hard to tell exactly because it's really blurry. The actual character animation part isn't half bad though but again a lot of the frame is just so damn blurry it kind of ruins it.</br></br>  <br><br>I noticed nobody ever really complains when people are sucking their dicks in threads and putting down other studios, but try to ask the questions nobody ever wants to ask about Kyoani that threatens to not paint them in an overwhelmingly positive light and it's full on indignation time. The old classic Kyoani fanboy double standard.</br></br>  <br>i call it artificial animation</br>  <br> 2003 was the only good one until Sento <br><br>What went wrong in between</br></br></br>  <br>Because they actually spend the time and effort to do good animation. Unlike most studios (SHAFT) that send their shit out to Worst Korea or China to animate. KyoAni makes sure they have few if any animation mistakes. <br><br>also 9/10 times their anime has very good plot and memorable characters. That's why most of their anime sells extremely well.</br></br></br>  <br>The novels also had Yuri-bait. KyoAni added more het-bait too. And the author on Twitter was pleased so take that as you may.<br><br>But anon you can and should judge everything. I can say for a fact that Italian and Even subsaharian Africans had better 'novels' or prose in general than the Nips and Gooks. The Chinese on the other hand have some notable exceptions.</br></br></br>  <br>So they have the worst fanbase and are universally hated by anyone with taste?</br>  <br><br>Japanese writing nowadays is so bad it's almost it's own in joke. I think it's more they can't into believable character drama than anything. It's always so overwrought and trying to make the biggest deals out of the smallest of every day problems.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure you got banned from animesuki for a reason, Kaioshin.</br>  <br> I can say for a fact that Italian and Even subsaharian Africans had better 'novels' or prose in general than the Nips and Gooks <br><br>So I should take your completely subjective opinion on something as a fact instead of an actual source saying Japanese literature is on par with English literature in age, richness and volume? Yeah, no. You're trying way too hard to look like you know what you're actually talking about.</br></br></br>  <br> So is Twilight. <br>This logic. Yeah but what kinds of awards did it win is the more important question.</br></br>  <br>You can continue to be the biggest weeb and suck the nip dick. I mean I'm not a literary major but I know that Britannica doesn't say anything bad about any culture. They even had Punic culture as a beacon of the midetreannan. Most people consider French and Italian prose as the best that humanity ever provided before the 'siècle du lumiere' for a reason anon.</br>  <br><br>Just curious, how much of Japanese language do you know?</br></br>  <br>It won no awards. It's plebian trash</br>  One of them is not like the others.<br><br><br> protip: its the one stolen from gonzo </br></br></br>  <br> You can continue to be the biggest weeb and suck the nip dick. <br><br>I believe that's called being rational. You can't discredit the literature of an entire culture just because it's not as widely known as Western literature due to Japan's isolationism. <br><br> I mean I'm not a literary major but I know that Britannica doesn't say anything bad about any culture <br><br>Why would they? They're impartial to it. It says Japanese literature is ONE OF THE major literatures in the world in the description.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop reminding people of destroyed dreams, anon.</br>  <br> so suck <br><br>fuck off brazilian piece of shit</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Haroohee</br>  <br>And you say this by having read how many Japanese novels, in Japanese? And I'm not talking about LN trash written for 15 year olds.</br>  <br> now they do have gems such as FMP <br>Do people honestly believe FMP was a good show?</br></br>  I am actually thinking about giving KyoAni another chance. What I mainly dislike are their post 2011 shows, I dropped most of them. While I like the vibe and style of Hyouka I found Chitanda too annoying and Kyoukai no Kanata just ended up bad. I might like Amagi because it seems pretty funny from what I've seen.<br><br>Currently my opinion of them is that they have gotten too stale and that they sometimes overdo things so that they look "kitschy".</br></br>  <br> They even had Punic culture as a beacon of the midetreannan <br><br>Are you implying it wasn't? Kill yourself, retard. You're starting to sound like a dumb stormfag now.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>It's the animator expo with Okiura and like ten other big names, none of which were Bahi JD.</br>  <br>They had nice mosaics that I was fortunate enough to see but in the grand scheme of things Libanese and Italians were the major influences on the midetreannan in that age.<br><br>They are impartial to everything and say everything is good. When everything is good nothing is.<br><br>I don't speak a single word of Italian, Arabic or Nip. but I can appreciate Arabic and Italian works. Meanwhile the Nip works are literal shit. The best thing I've read was a 11 century fiction that many people say was a plagiarism of a forgotten Chinese novel.</br></br></br></br></br>  KnK  and Free! (but dropped that shit)  was an absolute snoozefest.<br><br>People overrate FMP because "muh old animu".</br></br>  <br>The problem is that you'd need to know actual Japanese and be familiar with their culture/history in general in order to judge it properly due to the main characteristics of their literature. It cannot be translated as easily. This was already covered here: <br><br> They are impartial to everything and say everything is good. When everything is good nothing is. <br><br>Wrong. They don't compare African literature with English literature for example. They only did that with Japanese literature.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you'd prefer still shots with flapping mouth than well-animated cuts? Okay.</br>  <br>Why does every other work get judged by people who mostly can't read the language but the Nips should get a special treatment. I mean I can't read Chinese language for shit but I can appreciate their works. And the nips are based on the chinese language aren't they?</br>  <br> <br>It was actually pretty good. <br/></br> <br><br>People don't over rate it, its rated fine. Compared to most anime from that time to today, the list of good/enjoyable/great anime is short. FMP falls inside that list almost always.</br></br></br>    <br>The Chinese are not as isolationist as the Japanese. They had plenty of contact with other people dating back to thousands of years ago. That only happened with Japan around the 1800's.</br>  <br>for a haruhi season 3, first we need a complete season 2</br>  <br>And that's why at least in my opinion the Chinese are better in literary value to the world.</br>  <br> &gt;Do people actually think Hibiki is a good show. <br><br>Fuck of Jebus with your shittaste and your Yuribaiting shitshow. Hibiki wishes it were as good as FMP.</br></br></br>  <br> Tatami Galaxy <br> baby first pretentious shit  <br> in english  <br> watched the dub </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your "muh misunderstandings" shitshow.</br>  <br>I'm a Yaharifag and even I know how wrong this is.</br>  <br>Because you keep making these threads and thus encourage the beaten horse to make threads as well. Don't know why you people are so simple but you might want to think about action and reaction. Also, KyoAni has always been big on/a/.</br>  <br>Says the one that watches a show that baits with Yuri shit.</br>  <br> someone saved and posted the webm I made </br>  <br>If by "better" you mean "more popular appeal", then yeah. I think it's stupid to compare them since they're so different though. I don't know Japanese either, but if credible sources claim their works are comparable to English literature then it's undeniable that it has a lot of value. Saying "Nips can't write for shit" is simply incorrect based on this.</br>  <br>Says the one who falls for the yuri bait every time.</br>  <br>Its not even well animated. It is jarring more than anything.</br>  <br> And the nips are based on the chinese language aren't they? <br><br>Chinese and Japanese are completely different. Japan just uses a sizeable chunk of Chinese characters in order to make things easier. Katakana and Hiragana have nothing to do with Chinese.</br></br></br>  <br>In terms of melodrama, nothing compares to Yahari this season.</br>  <br>I don't fall for it, I find it disgusting that they would bait in order to make more sales. Too bad that shit didn't work out for them because Hibiki barely broke 5K and is selling less than Amagi.<br><br>Have fun watching your one dimensional characters in a band being over dramatic. Also it's good it gonna finally end tomorrow so people won't keep on making cancerous threads of that shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Would you rather a typical Kyoani thread anywhere else where its just like a religious cult praising the studio in circles endlessly? At least Kyoani threads on /a are never boring full throttle circlejerks and there's a chance you might see a criticism or misgivings levelled at some point.</br></br>  <br>There is no baiting.</br>  <br><br>They'll just start making Kyoani general threads most likely that'll manage to outnumber and outlast the ones for shows actually airing aside from maybe Charlotte and Prisma Ilya</br></br>  <br>I don't go anywhere else so I don't care. And KyoAni threads are always full of people that start shitting on the studio.</br>  Posting in "IRC trolls KyoAni" thread #897987.  <br/>  KyoAni &gt; SHAFT &gt; everyone else<br><br>Don't kid yourself, you know it's true. These are the two studios you'd absolutely cream yourself over if they adapted your favorite manga and you know it.</br></br>  <br>The yuribait is in the source material too.</br>  Honestly, Kyoani just don't know how to portray humans realistically.

Also the lack of variety in their art is a shame.</br></br>  <br> arguing what is best studio <br>only autists do this, kyoani is pretty high though</br></br>  Kyoani sucks.

Having too much detail or shit moving around in the frame can end up distracting the viewer from what they should be focusing on.</br>  <br>That's called having too much detail.</br>  <br>If you have things moving that shouldn't be, it's completely fair to call it over animation.</br>  <br>Over-animation sounds retarded any way you put it.</br>   over-animation <br> forced-animation <br><br>I really hope this is some meme that hopefully dies out after the summer.</br></br></br>  <br>That was kind of an important scene.

I'm speaking in a highly general way. I think the term "over-animation" is completely fine in theory, just used poorly.</br>  <br>It will die in a few years at best. Remember how long it took deconstruction to die?</br>  <br>Who is they?</br>  <br><br>No, I don't mean in an "over the top" sense, I mean in an "they behave and move like they are mentally retarded" sense. I think it might be an effort to make their characters feel more alive but it fails in my opinion and just feels like overdone character quirks.<br><br>The movements aren't subtle and their characters aren't what i'd expect from shows grounded in reality. Nichijou is the only exception.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you line up the events, they fell off as soon as they started a literature division. It's just a guise for them to funnel their own stories into the anime studio which means less adaptions. Problem is the studio isn't shit as writing.

They always ask me.<br>I'm kind of a pushover, so if someone asks me nicely to do something for them, I'd more than likely help them, but I'd be grinding my teeth through a fake smile the whole time.<br><br>I thought I was kinda like shirou, but him and I are different in two ways. <br><br>1: in the sense that he helps people the best that he can with what he has available to him while I just kinda say "meh, I can't help you until I have X". He also enjoys helping people, while I don't at all, unless it's something that interests me.<br><br>2: he actually cares about people<br><br>I don't like seeing people in pain, but if the person standing beside me was shot, I'd worry more about killing the person that shot at us than worry about the person on the ground, whether they're dead or alive. I figure, they're already shot and there's nothing I can do to reverse the shot.<br><br>So who am I? Is there even a character like me?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  KyoAni is the only studio with character. None of the others have their own style because they have few if any permanent employees.  Hibike is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DRAMA. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br> <br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The geeky characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the tubas, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole band faggotry and everything about the whole Hibike world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on yuri, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br> <br>Hibike is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Hibike threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only going to get worse anon.</br>  <br> what is Shaft </br>  Kyoto animation is one of the best studios because it's one of the only ones that you can actually call a proper studio with a straight face.<br><br>Most other studios do so much outsourcing that it's almost like Theseus' Paradox could be applied to them.<br><br>Kyoto animation is one of the rare studios where the production staff doesn't change between the show. They only use their in house staff and that's mostly it.<br>Their production and scheduling is superb. They reserve so much time for their productions that they can for example get away with designating only around 6 key animators for each episode they're working on (which has been the standard for ABP and Hibike). There is literally no other studio like this. Most other studios go through a production hell by having too tight of a schedule.<br><br>I do not see a point in judging a studio based on how good the writing and story in their shows is. After all their focus is on animation production and in that regard Kyoto animation is one of the greatest Japanese studio out there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's right, this kind of scene is jarring and looks awkward. Part of the problem is that KyoAni is shit at doing these sequences and it becomes almost as jarring as CG.</br>  <br>I'm sure a Disney animator didn't know what he's talking about<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J1c<wbr>HAzKta9w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Your face is jarring and awkward.</br>  <br>yeah but at least I have good taste</br>  <br>Not him, but yes, over animating is a thing, but that scene is most definitely not an example of over animation.<br><br>This is over animation http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/11<wbr>959/animated-character_acting-hair-<wbr>kou_yoshinari-mahou<br><br>everyone is constantly moving, everything is constantly waving around the characters are overly gestural, it distracts from the actual scene and just looks unnatural.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> KyoAni frequently makes rookie mistakes because they never cycle through staff  <br> kyoanifag tries to write it off as a meme </br></br>  <br>This. Natural animation is something Kyoani finds difficult most of the time.</br>  <br>KyoAni's animators don't spend time watching real people.</br>  It's like I really am on MAL  <br>What studio does character animation better?</br>  <br> bitches about "over-animation" <br> calls it rookie mistakes <br><br>???????????????????????????????????<wbr>?????</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>disney</br>  <br><br>Kyoani has a way of bringing the inner idiot out of everybody.

While only days pass for Touta, years do for Eva. And while Eva spends years alone, those few moments she shares with Touta every now and then end up being something she treasures greatly.</br>  <br>That's too precious</br>  <br><br><br><br>M-My feelings for Negi x Eva is starting to waver.</br></br></br></br>  <br>good reasoning anon.</br>  <br><br><br>I am beginning to understand, Evafags.</br></br></br>  <br>Touta is Negi.<br><br>Negi is Touta.<br><br>it is normal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds about right. This is good stuff, Ken.</br>  <br><br>this is great and all but their meeting in the past is getting redundant you know because she can't say she forgot about him because she met him way too often, so th current Eva has to be pretending that she didn't know him before.<br><br>Also this and this  and this <br> seem from the time in Negima judging by the cloths the puppet is wearing and the design of everything else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Negi x Eva <br>Not even Eva wanted that, that ship is just 'I'm totally not thinking of fucking your father' material.</br></br>  <br> seem from the time in Negima judging by the cloths the puppet is wearing and the design of everything else. <br>The spoilers mentioned that 18 years went past for Eva since Touta patted her head. It's more likely that Eva simply maintained the same taste in clothes for centuries.<br><br> so th current Eva has to be pretending that she didn't know him before. <br>It's possible that Dana will erase Eva's memories once Touta completes his training or something else will happen to make her forget. It's too early to judge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she met him way too often <br>4-5 times in 20 years isn't often.</br></br>  <br> hfw she talked with him about Nagi at some point </br>  <br> “女”は刀太と違い、長い年月の中から飛び飛びで喚ばれているため <br> The ‘woman’ and Touta don’t match, because she is summoned scatteredly from a timespan of many years. <br> “女”にとって前回刀太と会ったのは2年ぶり、今回は8年ぶり <br> For the ‘woman’ the previous meeting with Touta was after 2 years, this time it is after 8 years. <br><br><br>Oh, right, it never occurred to me that he might not be always going to the same time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She even fell for a clone wtf <br><br>We don't really know what's up with that yet, but she has a doll fetish anyway.<br><br>Touta is pretty human</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> human <br><br>I've got news for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>he is anything but human.</br></br>  <br>Human is all about the attitude</br>  <br><br><br><br>This will end in heartbreak won't it, I just know it will. Poor Eva, she is just going to get herself hurt if she keeps chasing after Touta.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touta is her only path left<br><br>Nagi and Negi have other people, Touta actually loves her back, she likes him, the only downside is that since this is a meeting outside of time she'll have spent all those years in between alone waiting for him.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but the Chachamaru like servant must be around the time of negima, unless Chachamaru's concept itself took inspiration for this servant</br>  <br>Nihei please.</br>  <br>True, but I just don't want Eva to suffer more...<br><br><br>She probably is a more evolved form of Chachazero, and later was used as a basis for Chachamaru.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This manga is entirely about her path of happiness it turns out.</br>  <br>Chachaone?</br>  <br>Probably something like that. <br><br><br>So her happiness will come by making a group of friends that won't die? I guess that works. <br><br>Okay guys, so the question is, does Eva remember about Touta or not, I feel that would change things a lot depending on the answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be meaningless if she didn't remember<br><br>The fact that she chased after Nagi is already proof that she remembered, since Touta was the one who told her she'd fall for a red head.<br><br>Her first crush, she ended up raising in the end. Time paradoxes can be a bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dun know, I mean she could just remember subconsciously, so she still not remember Touta perfectly and still somewhat remember some of the things he told her.</br>  So? Does it mean Touta X Kuroumaru and Touta X Kirie are sunk now? How will react Karin? Is it present Eva at the end?  <br>she won´t tell him she met young and he became her only friend. that would be weird, she just let everything flow naturally.</br>  <br>I'll have to agree to this, you have a man dedicated to his gorgeous wife, and another swarmed by girls.. at this stage Eva and with all her immortality should have a genuine reciprocated love.</br>  <br>ToutaxKuro -&gt; mates<br><br>ToutaxKirie. that never existed.</br></br></br>  <br>Chachamaru was built by the science girl in 3-a no? (not Chao, the other one)</br>  <br>No, she was mainly built by Chao</br>  <br> ToutaxKirie. that never existed. <br>Pretty sure this ship had supporters. Even if it was not really highlighted compared to the two others.</br></br>  <br>Will Eva finally lose her virginity?</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't anon referring to Kirie's rather blatant crush on Touta?</br></br></br>  <br>She needs to move her head closer.</br>  <br> Touta X Kuroumaru <br><br>Kuromaru didn't accept that himself, so this is going to make it easier for him to chose to be a guy and Toutas literal BFF<br><br> Touta X Kirie <br><br>there were hints but nothing serious so far.

Taking a shower offscreen is evil and immoral these days?</br>  <br>Last week they screwed up too and used the 406p raw instead of the 720p. It's nice that they also put up a seperate sub file though</br>  <br>This is rather tame for fanservice.</br>  <br><br>I always get the raw to go with the soft sub from rusuban.

And now he's having hallucinations about her.  <br>I've never expected such straight-up straightfaggotry from a Yu-Gi-Oh MC.

They trade blows and keep turning the table on each other. No one-sided round. 8/10  <br>Yuzu, stop cheating on the polls.</br>  Card game on rollercoaster in volcanic simulation theme park proto-type!  <br>i literally love yuya but it's a tossup between yusei and yami for me<br> and i'm the only person who voted yami <br>i still believe in your last pathetic cards pharaohman</br> </br></br>  <br>Like Yuma and Alit, do the antagonist ended up falling in love with Rebecca?<br><br>If the blonde is Rebecca, that is.</br></br></br>  <br> Surprised by that Yuya has the most votes </br>  <br>wait WHAT<br>kek bravo bot anon</br></br>  <br>Holyshit it is real volcano. Faker is a pussy. Kaiba makes goat area.</br>  <br>Reminder people in this thread want Yuzu/Yugo to stay longer with each other, although I am very curious to see how Yuya interaction with Rin could be</br>  <br>If Yuya met Rin after the end of Synchro Arc and the arc ends with Yuya absorbing Yugo, there will be an uncomfortable sort of atmosphere between Yuya and Rin.<br><br>Or maybe the moment Yuya sees Rin the 'Inner Yugo' is activated and Yuya enters Playboy Mode like he did against Mieru.</br></br></br>  So, in yugioh world, strong people are those who can either : Pull of combo no-one thought about, posses strong cards, have strong drawing skill. In Zexal Kaito establish this against Jinlong and saying something like strong duelist guide their cards.

I wonder if hopping dimensions has had anything to do with it or it's simply the thirst for Yuzu overwhelming all other feelings.</br>  <br>personally I'm hoping for edge mode reveal and then Yuzu curing it by hugs and  hand holding. </br>  <br>She's one of the few, now try prominent characters that show up consistently. <br><br>She saw it when he dueled Ryouzanpaku.<br><br>Hmmm</br></br></br></br></br>  Academia invasion when?  <br>Arc-V is the anti-Zexal<br> No lewds <br> Likeable protagonist <br> Important female lead <br> Several relevant females <br> Parents that actually matter <br> Rival with little screentime <br> Uses several summon methods instead of BUY XYZ <br> Uses tons of references to previous series instead of pretending it doesn't exist <br> Side-characters actually do stuff and are interesting <br> Social commentary </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She saw it when he dueled Ryouzanpaku. <br><br>That was just a hint of it.

Leo did mention something about not wanting to deploy more forces to Synchro until were 100% done with XYZ, maybe they sent some smaller forces that were repelled? The invasion might even have been a justification for the pseudo fascist classist thing they've got going on.</br>  <br>The posters were made by Yuzu and Yugo (probably Yuzu since Yugo is quasi-illiterate)</br>  <br>Yuzu and Yugo were the ones who made the posters, and they know what Obelisk look like from encountering them during the Battle Royale. The average Synchro citizen has no idea about different dimensions and thinks the idea of dimensional invaders is silly.</br>  <br><br><br>Ah, I se, thanks. So Yugo and Yuzu are like the crazy guy in the corner with the "Jesus is coming" sign, and Jean Mitchell is just an asshole that doesn't even need propaganda to justify his police state.</br></br></br>  <br>I've always wondered how Domino City got as terrible as it was. I'm sure Kaiba doesn't care, but where is everyone else at that lets that shit happen.</br>  <br>Man, Asuka is top fucking tier when she's in clothes that arent ugly like the Obelisk Blue girls uniform</br>  Do you take responsibility?  <br>We don't know how many, if any, characters from DM and GX might have died in the unspecified timeskip between series and/or on Zero Reverse. In any case given that Jack was Kingu and that he didn't have to duel Yugi for the title as far as we know is pretty telling of the fact that the DM characters weren't really influential anymore (Not that a Yugi, being merely a champion game player, even if that game is as popular as both kinds of football puth together in our world, could have stopped the onset of the dystopia, as you said, Kaiba wouldn't have cared and he's the only one who realistically could have done something about it)</br>  <br>Of course it's real! He created a themepark of death just to try and kill Yugi.<br><br> Though I think it just maybe solid vision with mass though </br></br></br>  <br>BATHTIME!</br>  <br><br>ultra kek</br></br>  <br>Yes. Then I go and take responsibility for the other Ruris too.</br>  <br> No lewds <br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>You really want those Dragon dicks up your ass don't you?</br>  <br>Well KaibaCorp is the one that made Duel Runners and Ushio was in DM as a high school bully. So I'd imagine everyone in DM is still alive.</br>    <br> No lewds <br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>Yugi may have well retired in those 20+ years and have assented to legendary duelist status. As for Kaiba, Yliaster coukd have forced him or Mokuba out of KC or killed them to take full control of the company and wrap it to what it became.</br>  <br> didn't change the bracelet <br>1/10</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding? You can learn everything you need to know in life by playing card games! At least, that's what Crow taught me.</br>  <br>Holy fuck I shit you not I was so focused on the yuzus It took me fucking 5 minutes to notice what was behind her.</br>    <br>Ushio is an exception and a temporal anomaly. Some suspect him to be immortal as a result of his penalty game.</br>  <br>Also, Zexal was hated in the west and loved in Japan, while Arc-V is loved in the west and- what do the Japanese think of Arc-V?<br>Is it more popular than Zexal?</br></br>  <br>japanese have bad taste</br>  <br>Well his name was on a list in GX too with the whole Nightshroud/Domino City stuff.</br>  <br>Japan seems to like Arc-V quite a lot. I think they just like YGO man.</br>  <br> Shun <br>Every revolutionary time</br></br>  <br> that determined for cock Yuzu </br>   sexualizing the yuzu   <br>Taking the sleeves off of the obelisk blue uniform was a stupid idea.</br>  <br>I approved of the attempt at bare upper arm service, but it didnt work out</br>  <br>I prefer that before we get DMG sexualization again. Unless they use another monster of course, but stop with the fagging of DM things.</br>  <br>Dark Magician Girl legs in good animation in the waifufag times. Oh yes.</br>  <br> &gt;sexualizing the yuzu <br>kek</br></br>  <br>anon yuya is going to be jealous</br>  <br>And I would appreciate it if it wasn't the fact that she literally has some kind of apparition in every Yu-Gi-Oh! Seasons, DM being her first appearance, GX and that Duel Spirit Monster Day, 5Ds with that figure Carly got and the movie, and ZEXAL with the stones, and probably she will have some type of appearance in Arc-V. Not counting the many figures she has plus the new one.<br>I don't say that is bad, she is likeable, but it's obvious the really nostalgia bait for DM, and DMG is with Atem one of the most noteable things in there, so instead of that I will really prefer have things from other seasons, hell I'll take even ZEXAL even if it was a big punch of balloliness.</br></br>  <br>Woah nigga das lewd.</br>  <br>All it took was sealing Yoshida away into the Zexal Manga.<br>He needs a new containment unit</br></br>   Serena will never be loved by her Yuu.    miera disappointed that yuya was "her fated person" <br>sis get better opinions</br>  <br>Man, she's going to be so fucking happy when she sees Yuya duel JAKKU</br>  <br>Good she has her boy harem of Reiji, Shun, and Sawatari now.</br>  <br>She's gonna be so disappointed when he gets his asshole ripped apart so hard by the Kingu that he turns gay and wants to start sucking his dick for how amazing he is.</br>  I'm going to post this everyday until you like it.

I'm sorry you've got nothing to hold onto but fanfiction and fanart.</br>  Kinda funny how many yurifags laid down the Reinahating because of last ep.<br><br> critically BTFO </br></br>  <br>If you want to blame someone blame KyoAni  for picking this up. </br>  <br>Exactly 20 years later</br>  <br> Reina's relationship with Kumiko makes her seem sweeter and more human <br> Reina's "relationship" with Taki-sensei makes her seem like an obsessive idiot <br>Fuck this, I'm not a yurifag but Kumiko/Reina is a lot more positive for Reina's character.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not a yurifag <br>See, now you are trying too hard.  Not that I'm disagreeing with the premise. </br></br>  <br>That's precisely my point, however.<br>Let the anime do it's thing. This isn't to say that the novels are inherently bad or that Takeda is a bad writer or anything, but KyoAni's just doing a better job.</br></br>  <br>I honestly want them to pick a manga. They do great shows with manga as source.</br>  <br> Implying the character won't keep their canon love interests. <br>Anon please.</br></br>  <br> When Taki sensei tells her about his dead wife and his dream, she's incredible hurt. But she decides to work even harder to reach the nationals, because Taki's hapiness is her hapiness. It makers her a noble character with a strong will. I love her. </br>  <br>I'm more interested in Mizore and Nozomi. I hope KyoAni if they do a second season development well that and Asuka.</br>  <br> for Taki. <br>Not for Kitauji like the rest of the students.</br></br>  <br>I'm not. <br>I'm saying that should we get to the second novel where Reina's personality is reduced a bit closer to a gimmick, she'd likely be better written.</br></br>  <br>Her forehead is too huge.</br>  Reina's love reminds me weirdly of Sakura's.  <br>Mizore x Asuka for s2 otp<br>Apparently the return of Mizore's flute gf irritates the otherwise hollow Asuka.</br></br>  <br>Duh, he's the reason why she's in that school in the first place.</br>  <br>KyoAni is gonna focus on Mizore and Nozomi. They are the main plot after all.</br>  <br>That's selfish, and pathetic. At least the others are doing it for the school.</br>  <br>But KumikoxMizore is OTP.</br>  <br>Asuka/Mizore/Nozomi/Kumiko promos when?</br>  <br>look at this commie</br>  <br>She wants to go to nationals. She's wanted nationals before she went to Kitauji.</br>  <br>No, they're doing it for themselves. Kumiko is playing because she loves Eupho not because she wants Kitauji to win; she wants to win herself.</br>  <br>So working hard for the person you love is bad? geeh, hopefully you'll never love anyone and have a family of your own.</br>  soon...™  <br>I think KyoAni's the one that knows what KyoAni will do, including whether or not they'll make a second season at all. <br><br>We can make guesses sure, but if I'd read the first novel before watching this season, there's no way I would have predicted what KyoAni did with the story, except in a very broad sense.</br></br></br>  <br>She wanted to become special for Taki's sake before she even met Kumiko</br>  <br> before she even met Kumiko <br> Not in the anime. </br></br>  <br> He's known her since she was 10-11 </br>  <br>She met Taki in middle school. She went to the same middle school and was in band with Kumiko. She's known them for the same amount of time, pay attention.</br>    <br> Psst.  Not in the anime.  </br>  <br>As expected from specialist girl.</br>  <br> she wants to win herself. <br>And that's fine. Doing something because you want to do it, because that's your intrinsic motivation, is fine.<br><br>Doing something because you want to draw the attention of someone you blindly worship and don't even truly know, however, is not fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Friendship is a thing you know, and they are really good for each other.

Tomorrow is the EP1 premiere with Aoi/Iguchi/Hikasa, so just be aware that spoilers will start surfacing by then.  Another thread?<br>Fine by me.</br>  Reposting theory on /m/.<br> Director said Hibiki will face a new problem related to her "echoing root". <br> "Hibiki" literally means "echo" <br> Going around helping people is just her "echoing" Kanade's action, not what she truly want to do herself. <br> Hibiki's berserker mode is her suppressed rage being released. <br> "Exterminate the darkness inside your heart and become a new you" <br> Darkness: "echoing"/copying Kanade's action to justify her existence <br> Hibiki exterminates her "echoing root" <br> Let her emotions freely "soar to the heaven" <br> Goes berserk and proceed to destroy the world. <br>It'd kind of explain the logo too. Kaneko said G was the story of Hibiki after she became a hero, GX will be "the end of the G", a.k.a "the end of Hibiki's heroism".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm Fine.</br>  <br>I didnt see another one. Its Fine though</br>  <br> echoing kanade <br>not really though, the whole kanade was the 'dont give up living' or whatever not go be selfless. the whole giving her body for the public was more of a survival guilt thing than a kanade thing.</br></br>  <br>She goes around telling people not to give up their live while ready to give up her own at the moment of notice. It's exactly what Kanade did.</br>  <br>She specifically denies that.</br>  Was it all PR?  <br> CRS-7 <br> 7 <br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 there's a space shuttle going to fall down in GX </br>  <br>in after you mean</br>  EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE  <br>Subs never, fuck Commeme</br>  <br>Zoid9000 or w/e his name is is subbing it. So subs 3 days after release.</br>  <br>3 days would be pretty good by Symphogear standards.</br>  <br>For sure. We wont have many of these since we wont be waiting for a week for commie.</br>  So wait, are that H&amp;D group the same as the Zoid group?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Oh, okay.<br>Well, good luck to them.</br></br>  <br>UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS</br>   mfw I've been putting this off on my backlog for years and finally started watching for season 3 <br><br>This show is a fucking trip. I just finished season 1 and the first episode of season 2.<br><br>Does anyone have any webms? Sakugabooru only has a handful.<br><br>sage for requestshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God, I thought she was some kind of female Shirou during the whole series. That post and the previous ones really could be about him.<br><br>Shirou doesn't have Hibiki's bikkis and doesn't EAT; WATCH MOVIES AND SLEEP though so he is inferior.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Most I have are from s2 and have sound</br>  <br>Well I mean if you're worried about spoiling shit, I don't think it really matters. I'm definitely not watching this for the gripping, deep, and intricate plot.</br>  <br>I'll dump a few.<br><br>Also get the fuck out.<br>S2 is a wild fucking ride and you don't want to be spoiled.</br></br></br></br>  I want to wait until the episode airs to listen to it.<br>But I want to listen to it now.<br>How do I make the episode air right now?</br></br>  <br>You realize it might not play in the first episode right?</br>  <br>You mean they put more effort into more things than the animation for S2?</br>  <br>You don't understand. Some crazy shit happens.</br>  <br>You don't know how to enjoy a show, do you?</br>  <br>You'll enjoy it more going in blind. Trust us on this.</br>  <br>It will just after Phara introduction</br>  I want to fuck Kirika.  <br> inb4 instead of Exterminate, they played Radiant Force first </br>  <br>Some shows you watch for the engaging story. Some shows you watch because they're really fucking hype, even if the story is predictable. If something like Disappearance is a fine steak dinner, than so far I'm finding Symphogear to be a big fucking chocolate cake.<br><br>I'm sorry if I'm enjoying it for the wrong reasons, gatekeeper.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirabe pls. Your gay duet with her wasn't obvious enough?</br>    <br>Just watch it then come back to thread. You don't need to spend your time on 4chan while you can watch anime.</br>  <br>It'd be fitting, the very first line of Radiant Force "The beginning song" after all.</br>  <br> not shitposting while you watch anime <br><br>Why do you think people buy two monitors when they don't do any photo/video editing or programming?</br></br></br>    Has Maria ever had sex?  <br>I want to fuck Shirabe.</br>  these threads are as bad as klk ones  <br>playing the track on loop since last thread.<br>Wonder if I will hate it when the anime starts in 5 days.</br></br>  <br>Bipolar disorder.</br>  <br>Well okay then.</br>  <br>I don't think so. I doubt any of the geahs even know what sex is, aside from one obvious exception.</br>  How could I have forgotten all these nano desu  <br>I don't think you can hate it if you understand the lyrics.<br>I don't know why but the whole things made me hope for a HibiMiku end.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to get my dreams crushed by hoping for something like that.</br>  <br>Maria is an Idol in the Geahverse, so no.<br>She must remain pure or her fans riot.</br></br>  <br>Are you still pure when you become a terrorist? I know Nana fans would probably stand by her but is Maria that popular?</br>  <br>She's getting another concert so I don't think the symphoverse civilians care about it that much.</br>  <br>Judging by the crowd at the concert in the PV, yeah.</br>  <br>About her being a terrorist I mean. I'd be pleasantly surprised if they show the lasting repercussion of her terrorist life on her new life.</br>  <br>They said in an interview that the first two episodes would address why she's still able to be an idol.</br>  <br> Nana wills it </br>  <br>I can't wait to hear their excuse.</br>  <br>Me too. But if you replace all the "you/your" in the lyrics with "I/my" except for sentences that specifically use the word 君, it kinds of sound like Hibiki's singing about her feelings in the past and present.</br>  <br>That broadcast in the final episode probably helped.</br>  <br>Japanese idols need to be pure but Maria is a American idol which means she's definitely a slut.</br>  <br>I want to date background character-chan.</br>  Only 3 episodes into the first season and this show is already so good.<br>Does it have good doujins too?</br>  <br>She needs a sword inside her sheath.</br>  <br>She's probably dead.</br>  <br>Yes, about 40.</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>I guess I should get started on that too.</br>  <br>I'm thinking it'll be about her making a deal to work and make up for their crime on the condition that FIS are constantly monitored by Genjurou's team so they don't try anything funny. So Tsubasa sticks with Maria and Kirika/Shirabe have to go with Hibiki and Chris in their school. That's gotta be the best deal ever.<br><br> be a terrorist <br> get out of jail <br> "forced" to spend time with Hibiki, Chris and Tsubasa </br></br></br></br></br>  SOON  <br>Good  non-h  ones.</br>  watching season 2 before 3 comes out<br>god damn why are Chris's bazooka's so big if you know what I mean</br>    <br>Only about 4 of the H ones have good/decent art. Rest are shit art+shit fetishes.</br>  <br>They got massaged a lot when she was growing up.</br>  <br>I can totally see it, man... future Hibiki coming back to the present to stop Hibiki from ever wanting to become a hero.</br>  <br>But Hibiki refused to become a hero.</br>  <br>If Illya had summoned Hibiki as Baasaakaa rather than Heracles, how fucked would Gil be?</br>  <br> Hibiki about to make a decision that will most likely fuck everything up <br> suddenly a portal opens and Future Hibiki flings herself out of it and superman punches Present Hibiki while shouting "YOU'RE NOT LIVING YOUR LIFE CORRECTLY!" <br><br>I want this. It's not going to happen but I want it.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Maria and Tsubasa are old hags who don't deserve love.  <br> He doesn't want to love a sword <br><br>How can someone be so completely fucking faggatrocious?</br></br></br>  <br>Please no bullying the elderly.</br>  I finished watching both seasons a few days ago since it was in my backlog for the longest time and I regret not watching it earlier. Currently listening to all the songs nonstop.<br><br>I'm glad I'll be able to enjoy S3 with you guys since it'll be a wild ride.</br></br>  <br>The Nana has funny lines and not just "Mommu!" though.</br>  <br>Maria has funny lines in the ova</br>  <br> just "Mommu!" <br>But  she also says "Serena"! .</br></br>  <br>Guess I'm not coming to /a/ for awhile. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>See you this Saturday.</br>  <br>Sounds pretty shitty to be honest. Maybe it's just because of source. Calmly waiting for download.</br>  <br>Yeah but can Hibiki cook and do the high jump?<br>He's also made of swords, bonus points towards Tsubasa affection.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry, but this song doesn't get my hyped.<br>It's nowhere near Synchrogazer or Vitalization.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I've listened too much to her, but this time it sounds like she just sings something that always sounds the same without taking a breath. You know, apart from its melodic aspect, it sounds like she's talking very fast to herself. I find it kinda boring.</br>  <br>I got this. Which is the scene that got me to watch Symphogear.</br>  <br>Its okay, but still Synchrogazer is the best Shinfogia OP.<br>This is starting to become like Dog Days OP, it gets shittier every season.<br>I hope Re Birth day is good.</br></br></br>  <br> Dog Days <br><br>Please, no!<br>That would also mean that the show gets worse with every season, and I don't want S3 to be worse than S2.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't like the glorious sword <br>Look at this faggot.<br>Maria is the only character that doesn't deserve any love unless she does shit.</br></br></br>  <br> they open Elfnein's box <br> it reveals a secret song <br>  LA LA LA LA LA LA </br></br></br>  <br>I also pray that it doesn't become Dog Days 2.0.<br>I believe in Nana, but never in King Records.</br></br>  <br>NO<br>O<br><br>NO<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell, if I will get "forced" to stick with Tsubasa and her friends just for being useless I'll even volunteer to kill people to be jailed and be "forced" to be with them.</br>  <br>I honestly prefer the second season OP if not solely for the way it builds up while the recap is playing.</br>  <br>Maybe Tsubasa blew holes on her already because her assets are as big as Kanade's.</br>  <br>Well, its both nice.<br>Exterminate is kind of, well, like Dog Days"`s No Limit, you know what I mean.<br>I just hope the Auf. form of Exterminate is good.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they're really trying to kill her now, if she flies and sings that in the fucking air I doubt she'll leave without any problems.</br>  <br>God, I hope it did.</br>  <br>They'll send her up so much that she'll just take off one day and show up 100 years later with her alien idol fans.</br>  <br> Nana gets launched into deep space then comes back with the custodians <br>Why does this seem so plausible?</br></br>  S1 Tsubasa was pretty fluffy.  <br> Nana flying around in her next live singing Exterminate <br> gets to the final "EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE" <br> concert hall erupts into flames <br><br>I don't know why I got this in my head but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shhh! That's the plot for the movie, Symphogear: Do you Remember the Awakening of the Trailblazer?</br>  Maybe because of something that happened recently.  <br>Meant for .</br>  <br>Who would want to remember that shitstain of a movie?<br><br> Actually, giant space flowers sounds surprisingly fitting in the context of Symphogear. </br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, hate on it for being the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull of Gundam all you like, but in the case of Symphogear, it wouldn't be out of place at all.</br>  <br> Tachibana (立花) Hibiki <br> 立花 == Standing Flower <br>   Hibiki will get transformed into a plant-based space elevator <br> yfw this was foreshadowed all along </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy, I remember that manga.</br></br>  Reminder that the pre-screening will happen tomorrow.    <br>Last action hero plz go</br>  <br>I doubt we'll get any spoilers.</br>    <br>Oh you will</br>  <br>I'm more interested in what the seiyuu will talk about.</br>  I'll never understand this.<br>Was the track team in Vietnam or something?</br>  <br>Miku is secretly an olympics gold winner.</br>    I want to cum inside Chris multiple times  <br>Her suddenly changed from track to music always seem strange to me, especially when she has the talent for the first.</br>  <br>She quit for Hibiki's sake. Survivors of the Zwei Wing concert were subject to extreme bullying; it was so bad for Hibiki's family that her father ran away forever.<br>Hibiki had literally only one person (aside from her mother) who cared about her in the 2-year period after the concert: Miku.</br></br>  <br>Her grandma supported her too, but yeah.<br>It's kinda fucked up since stuff like this happened in real life too.</br></br>  <br>Cute sword</br>  <br> Radiant Force is the beginning song <br> Exterminate is the ending song <br>Welp<br><br> Her father ran away forever <br>To be honest his life was kind of ruined as well.<br>If I remember right, he got harassed at work and fired from his job before descending into alcoholism and then just disappeared</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is this mainly a japanese thing or does "survivor's guilt" happen in the west too?</br></br>  Watching s1 for the third time made me actually understand why Miku got so fucking mad, she's not to blame at all if you think about it.<br>For the whole serie Hibiki treated her pretty awfully.</br>  <br>I've seen it in western movies here and there<br>"I should have been the one to die that day!"<br>It's generally done with lovers or family members, though I can't think of an incident in burgerland that's had the kind of shit where survivors were harassed and treated like murderers.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Tsubasa have 3 pairs of the same yellow-orange pantsu</br>  <br>Shit man, this isn't survivor's guilt. This is borderline psychopathic behavior. <br><br>Survivors of terrible events in the west are called heroes. Not harassed until they kill themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder.</br>  <br>One of those package deal sales. Like buy 2, get one free.</br>  <br>Well, to be fair, 2/3rds of the deaths at Zwei Wing were from being trampled or crushed by other people, not being Dusted by Noise.</br>  <br><br>that can happen in real life too, like fires in nightclubs</br></br>  <br>Or Freedomland shopping holidays.</br>    <br><br>I want to have a thre-foursome with all the gungnirs. A fake is fine too.</br></br>    <br>nah, he would be fine, he would just pull out tsubasa</br>  <br> Only eating carbs <br>/fit/ would be disappointed.</br></br>  I love her charm point.  <br>I see those genocides are still free and well.<br><br>Shouldn't someone put them into jail or something</br></br></br>  <br>With the  pancakes you should be worried more about the syrup </br>  <br>Still more healthy than S2's Rocky impressions.</br>  <br>Not unless your actions killed someone directly and even then random strangers don't fuck up your house. Felling guilty about random people dying which you had no control over is one of the most retarded things anime does.</br>    <br>That's not syrup.</br>  Is this the kind of show where you're not chastised for not watching the first 2 seasons?<br> inb4 Secondaries get out </br>  <br>No. Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>not starting from the beginning isn't being a secondary, it's being an idiot</br></br>  <br>You have plenty of time, dork.</br>  <br>Why would you start with the 3rd season?</br>  <br>Go and watch the first 2 seasons. You still have some time before the first episode.</br>  <br>What's wrong with eggs? It's really unlikely to get salmonella from eggs in a modern country nowadays.</br>  <br>It's less chastising and more why the hell would you watch a sequel without knowing how we got to that point. It's not because there's GX in S3's title that it's standalone series like Yugioh.</br>  <br>This isn't a SoL anon, and the anime doesn't really try to explain what's going on during the first ep to people who didn't watch the past seasons.<br>You have time before the first ep airs so go for it.</br></br>  <br>There are only a handful of series where watching the prequel isn't necessary.  This isn't one of them. </br>  <br> It was a joke because Commie </br>  <br>The things with Hibiki's a bit more complicated, though. People needs someone/something to blame when shitty things happens to them or people they care about to "stay sane". Those who care about that dead soccer guy needed to direct their anger at something and Hibiki was conveniently there. Once she's become a bullied victim then no one really gives a shit about why it started or if she deserved it anymore. More and more opportunistic bulliers will jump in just because.</br>  <br>How do you even eat big waffles with chopsticks?<br>You stab them until you manage to reduce it into pieces?</br></br>  <br>No one uses the term secondary here did you crawl over from some shitty LN thread? Watching the 3rd season of a concurrent series is just completely retarded.</br>  <br>You pick up the waffle with the chopstick and bite off.<br>This isn't rocket science.</br></br>  <br>It's not complicated though it's just fucking stupid. I fully understand what happened to her but the Japanese take on survivors guilt is plain nonsensical.</br>  <br>Except Bikki didn't feel bad for surviving, if anything she implies she's glad for being alive and thankful to Kanade.<br>She felt bad because she received countless death treats for surviving by the families of the other victims, specially since in both seasons the enemy character has to remind her so (Chris and Shirabe saying she doesn't know shit about pain), hell, even Tsubasa treats her like garbage once she discovers she's the survivor of that incident.</br></br>    Just asking in advance, where would we go to livestream GX when it starts airing? Same place we went for Jojo?  <br>I'm not talking about Hibiki in season 1 but the people in her flashback in season 2. I don't have a problem with Hibiki my issue is with other people acting in such an insane way and that retarded loli calling her a hypocrite which makes no sense either.</br>  <br>Where did all the civilians evacuate to?</br>    <br> evacuate </br>  <br>She's indeed a hypocrite, though, not in the way Shirabe meant. She genuinely wants to help others but the thing is she tell them to not give up their live while she's ready to give up her own. I believe Tsubasa calls it "positive suicide impulse".</br>  <br>Shirabe calls her a hypocrite because she has no idea of Bikki's past so she thinks she's a cunt for telling everyone to hug each other when she didn't go through the shit Shirabe went during her childhood.</br>  Anyone has screencap of Chris where she was kidnapped as a child.  <br>But she will come back and if it kills her!</br>  <br>Pretty sure everyone was already evacuated due to the big carrier noise showing up around the tower the day before.</br>  <br>This one?<br><br> You dirty girl.  </br></br></br>  <br>But that translation is fucking wrong. Objectively. Stop posting stupid theories and making people think they're valid.<br><br/></br></br>    <br><br>Thanks you.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, it's things like this that made G's plot excruciating. Almost every single fan theory was better and more thought-out than what ended up happening.</br>    <br>Eh, aside Bikki getting a mechanical arm and Ver not being that crazy almost every theory was very similar to what we got.</br>  I want to marry Chris.  <br>And even then, Miku wasn't really angry at Hibiki but rather afraid because Hibiki felt the need to keep secrets from her.<br><br>And we already know that Hibiki felt like shit having to treat Miku like that.</br></br></br>  <br>I was just saying people here tend to treat that one episode like "Goddammit Miku" when she's actually understandable.</br>  <br>I still don't get why Shirabe was such a cunt</br>  アイアイとゆっくりの経済講座番外編４「シンフォギアの経済ネタ」 (00:06:27) #sm26537812 http://nico.ms/sm26537812<br>A Japanese made a speculation from economic perspective that he said maybe in Symphogear universe, Japanese government reduced the budget of health insurance so people were angry about that the survivors can get compensation from government while most people have to pay a lot of money to doctors.<br><br>And it's true that some survivors from Fukushima nuclear disaster got bullied or were teased by some people on the internet just because they got compensation from Japanese government.</br></br></br>  <br>Both of those were pretty fucking close, too.<br><br>Did anyone even die directly as a result of Fukushima?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to adopt Chris.</br>  <br> Enemies aren't noise anymore <br> Genjuro can go all out </br></br>  <br>Teenager with shitty life, aka the "geez mom you don't know shit about me stop trying to say you want to help me you fucking cunt" mentality.<br>Except she did went through some shit in the past.</br></br>  <br>She was just having a hard time, okay?<br><br><br>There were... those guys who stayed behind to try to fix the shit who are going to be dead in a decade?<br><br>Yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally kill yourself</br>  <br>I don't think you can call it directly but at least 789 people died due to the disaster.</br>  <br>If it makes you feel any better, I'm downloading the BDs for both seasons.</br>  Maybe track team is a codeword for the army.  <br>this is how hell would probably look like.</br>  <br>it does.</br>  I can't be the only who wants a fucking turntable to control my computer. <br><br>FUCKING MICROSOFT DROP METRO AND DO THIS INSTEAD.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe was kidnapped when she was a child. She even doesn't have any memories before the kidnapping.</br>  At what time does GX hair? <br>I have an exam on Friday.</br>  <br>that actually looks pretty cool but how could it work?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hul<wbr>zQrLfvmM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> dat song <br>jesus christ it feels like i'm watching a 90's super robot show.<br>its official, i'm hype as fuck for this season.</br></br></br>   People forgetting that more people died from getting trampled on by other people than from the noise <br><br>That's the main reason the survivors got shat on.</br></br>  <br>https://www.timeanddate.com/countdo<wbr>wn/generic?iso=20150704T0310&amp;p0=671<wbr>&amp;msg=Believe+in+justice+and+hold+a+<wbr>determination+to+fist.&amp;csz=1</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>it's gonna air tomorrow right?</br>  <br>That's pretty sad. I wonder if they'll find their parents this season.</br>  <br> Where are we having the livestream? </br>  <br>S2 really missed out on this kind of hardcore action with so many shit to kill<br><br>They really need bring this aspect back.</br></br></br>  <br>Good thing then, plenty of time for me.</br>  <br>Unlikely unless Carol summons doll hordes.</br>  <br>supposedly, do we have a date and time on that or is it dick around till saturday time?</br>  <br>to be fail carol seems to be a nanoha tier caster at least so i'm guessing there will probably be mass doll spam, as well as all of them using magic bullshit.</br>  <br>We will know it tomorrow.<br> mfw there are 500 people got tickets of premiere </br></br>  <br>That scene seemed really weird to me.<br> Fine endlessly spawning Noise <br> turn away from Fine and go kill mooks instead <br>Never mind the fact that everyone in the city would probably already be dead or evacuated by that point anyway, so all the Noise can really do is stand around and look awkward.</br></br></br></br>   drew symphogeah so bad, an average /a/ would laugh at my drawings <br><br>why cant I have talent fuck this world.

Maria worst girl. All Symphos are cute.<br> Please stick to your shitty seasonal mecha shows and respective board. </br></br>  <br>Considering how careful she was with the two idiots and the fact that she actually took Hibiki's words to heart, yes, quite easily.</br>  More Symphogear figures when?  <br>After Bunny Chris all sold out..</br>  <br>Aren't those things selling like crazy?</br>   rewatch the whole thing out of boredom <br>I never noticed that Bikki sings the same song as Kanade. I'm so fucking slow</br>  <br>Remember S1 aired almost 4 years ago.</br>  <br>As far as I know Bunny Chris doesn't sell very well but mediocre because fanbase want gear version more.</br>  Yep, this will save the city.  <br>Time has no effect This Hype Train</br>  <br>After that fight Lydian and its surrounding area became a desert.</br>  <br>Fine died for Kirika's sins.</br>  <br>I want nendos of F.I.S.  mostly Dr. Ver but that isn't happening. </br>  <br>There are few things that I wouldn't do for a Kirika nendo.</br>  <br>Doesn't have as much impact as Vitalization but it still brings the hype.</br>  Why is Fine so moe?<br><br> I don't care if they so have to hamfist it in. I still want Fine back. </br></br>  is this weird if my dick react to singing nana mizuki ?  <br>Rule of cool</br>  <br>It would be weirder if it didn't.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/hwmsnnngiv.web<wbr>m<br><br>Reminder that Symphogear will never again have an asspull of this magnitude again.</br></br></wbr>  <br>That wasn't even that bad considering what singing does out there<br><br>The whole Fine, moon and sudden religious undertones deal being shoved down your throat in like 5 minutes was worse</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno. Hibiki regrowing her arm, having her fatal cancer cured by a death laser, catching Gungnir with her bare hand and stealing Maria's relic by singing. Ver using a giant magic hand to physically pull the moon toward earth. Miku throwing the cane like a mile into the sky. Some real ridiculous shit happened in G.</br>  <br>What are you talking about, the hype at that moment made the asspull amazing, I was sure that at least Chris was dead at that point.</br>  <br>Why is Aoi so good?</br>  <br>That scene was hilariously over the top and perfect. The music buildup, the screaming, the silly yet crazy armour designs</br>  <br>All that stuff in the first sentence was not that crazy considering the information we already had and many anons called them. Not one knew about Xdrives in S1 and we thought two characters had died.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? Not only was that part the best one in the series so far, but given the whole 'insane number of locks' thing, you can pretty easily chalk the asspull down to a different use of the S2CA or a similar technique.<br><br>If anything, Tsubasa and Chris not being dead at that point would be bad writing.</br></br></br>  <br>I believe they can do it again. I have faith in Satelight.</br>  <br><br>If you spend a minute past "How I shoot angst" Bikki and "Anger is the only stage of grief" Tsubasa, Miku is getting a pretty raw deal and dealing very well with it.<br><br>Bikki has been screwing up for months; Miku's got the patience of a saint if it took her that long to crack.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah come on, did you really guys thought they were dead instead of going for the most used cliché ever? Don't get me wrong, that part is one of my most favourite moments but the stuff that anon listed are more ridiculous asspull-wise.</br>  <br>If anything, them being dead and revived would be an even bigger cliché</br>  <br>It was an anime original and plenty of people including a gear user died that season so yes.</br>  <br>I still find it weird that the existence of god is proven in the symphogear universe, yet noone cares</br>  <br>No cute girl but the protagonist can die at that point in this kind of anime.</br>  <br>The city had noise proof bunkers installed everywhere.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention Tsubasa is voiced by Nana, she can't die unless you want a revolution.</br>  <br>That kind of reasoning is weak beyond belief</br>  <br>Gotta save it somehow.</br>  <br> Noise proof <br>I thought that's impossible.</br></br>  <br><br>The noise aren't particularly bright when they aren't being directly commanded.<br><br>The bunkers are probably standard, enough strength to block collateral damage, deep enough to prevent incidental discovery, It's not like the noise make a habit of digging for prey.</br></br></br></br>  How much do I need to pay the studio to make Zombie Kanade a reality?  <br><br>Why pay, they're banking that shit.<br><br>It'll come out when they run low on suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't resist.</br>  <br>What did Tsubasa do?</br>  <br>Held her determination to fist too strongly.</br>   tfw Nana is getting old now <br>How long until she starts funding anti-aging genetics research and makes herself 20 again?</br>  <br>God is voiced by TMR and is the head custodian.</br>  <br>I'm very okay with this</br>  <br><br>Kanade must be rolling in her grave seeing her girlfriend mingling with low lives like Chris and singing duets with that talentless hack Maria</br></br>  <br> I liked Maria's voice and Fushichou no Flamme a lot more than Kanade's and Gyakkou no Flugel </br>  <br>Shit taste</br>  <br><br>Kanade would wreck Maria at singing, fighting and fucking.</br></br>  You guys convinced me to go and finish s1. Even though I knew everyone was alive in s2 I thought everyone had died like 5 times in the last 3 episodes. Now time to move on to s2 for more hype<br><br>  Also, Chris a best  </br></br>  <br> singing <br>Down to personal preference by virtue of the voices<br><br> fighting <br>Kanade's objectively the weakest geah to date when she's not ODing on LiNKER<br><br> fucking <br>Tell that to Ver</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria is much better at living.</br>  <br>Wrong, Maria survives but Kanade lived.<br><br>Big difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Kanade's compatiblity is higher than FIS when FIS girls don't use Ver's LiNKER.</br>  Speakong of compatiblity, Japanese fan's speculation is Carol can deprive gear user's compatiblity as Hibiki can deprive it from nowhere.  <br><br> ODing. <br><br>I've got some bad news for you, she was jonesing hard for LiNKER during the concert.<br><br>Something about worrying about LiNKER disrupting the phonic gain, but she was cold turkey that night.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rewatching S1.<br>It feels really weird to see Nehustan Chris again.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the events before the concert, when she was genuinely only good because the normal LiNKER had extremely strong effects on her and she could handle puking a little bit of blood now and then due to how legitimately strong both her determination and her body were.<br><br>As for the concert, I thought Kanade not taking her LiNKER was Fine's plan.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought Kanade not taking her LiNKER was Fine's plan <br>Sort of. LiNKER user will create garbage in their song. This is one of reasons FIS couldn't activate Nephilim while they fought Hibiki and co..</br></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>First love song is still the best song</br>   tfw staff confirmed GX's action scenes are more heavy than previous seasons.    strong, determined  <br> but caring and supportive when Tsubasa needs comfort <br><br>Kanade was best husbando<br><br>Why did she have to die?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Am I the only one who is okay with Kanade dying because her death had so much meaning?</br>  <br>Too good for this sinful world.<br><br>Also this </br></br></br>  <br>You are not alone.</br>  <br> inb4 even more QUALITY now. <br>I hope they started the production early enough to not suddenly run out of time.</br></br>  <br>The ep. 6/7 Nehustan/Ichaival battle is probably my favorite part of the whole series.</br>  <br>I'm okay with Kanade dying because  I don't like her. </br>  <br> Satelight <br> has enough time and staff <br>Never. Especially when Aquarion s3 comes out in the same season again.</br></br></br>  <br>i completely forgot about that, holy shit<br>as long as Tsubasa's animated I'm fine though</br></br>  <br>The ichaival scene is what sold me on the series and it's concept.<br><br><br>No, then again i like her enough that her return would make me happy aswell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn she looked much better in S1</br>  <br>Fine please go.</br>  <br><br>Those were better times, when the dere was hidden deeply under many layers of hatred and  HA HA SAA-AA IT'S SHOWTIME </br></br>  <br> updated ending for EVOL <br> the OVA <br> 27 episodes of Logos </br></br></br>  <br> Macross Delta in fall or next winter </br>  Here's what I irrationally want to see this season:<br><br>- Six-part counterpoint battle.<br>- Two-sided six-part counterpoint battle (all 6 main gears vs. Carol + Elfnein + the puppets). (Astronomically unlikely but I will cry forever if this happens.<br><br>- Since the final mega-attack of S1 and S2 is named after the opening, it makes sense that the final attack of GX will be titled Exterminate. Incredibly stupid left-field prediction: somehow Hibiki will tap into the energy hand thing from the Frontier and hold the hand of everyone in the world to power the final attack. Exterminate loneliness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>27? That's a number I've never seen before</br></br>  <br> hold the hand of everyone in the world <br> turning Hibiki into a super turboslut in the final episode <br><br>Why would you want that anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would like to see Berbiki becomes the final boss.</br>  <br>I don't want my Hibiki to hold hands with dirty pakis.</br>  <br><br>/pol/-chan pls go</br></br>  <br>Not even. They're just gross.<br>Indians too. Their hands are literally covered in shit.<br>Hibiki doesn't deserve that.</br></br></br>  I want to see Hibiki showing she doesn't need her geah to kick ass.  <br>She softened a bit too much for my tastes<br><br> Also her bonkers got too huge </br></br></br>  <br>Tsun~ Tsun~</br>  <br><br>Symphogear threads are always half anime half nana/aoi wank.</br></br>  Does anyone have the 4koma of the episodes?  <br><br>Needs more Ayahi/Yoshino wank</br></br>  <br>Why is Aoi so perfect?</br>  I wish I could have been there for S1.

They got comically huge in G<br>Like something out of Senran Kagura</br></br>  I thought I was watching a Nana live.<br>So why are there so many tap dancing men on stage while they play folk music.</br>  <br>Because  NANA WILLS IT , obviously.</br>  <br><br>Because even Nana needs breaks, or time to change costumes. Though I prefer that intermission with Jupiter. <br><br>Still my favorite Nana concert.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks fucking great.</br>      <br><br>True, I know Aoi a kawaii princess-hime and everything but she's probably the  least talented singer of the group </br></br>  <br>I agree.<br><br>But you can hear her screaming her fucking heart out every goddamn time she's voicing Hibiki, and that's why I love her.</br></br></br>  <br>She sounded like she was going to suffocate in the live after Rainbow Flower. I was hoping she would stop shouting so much, for her own good.</br>  Cunts.  <br>They probably had already sung the song together before since them going up there wasn't planned.
