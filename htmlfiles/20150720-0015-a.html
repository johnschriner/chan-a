[ New ep in less than an hour and no thread yet?<br>Let's fix that.</br>  Hoping for more small creatures and less annoying sisters.  Hoping for more Yamada and less annoying Takanashi family.  <br><br> Not wanting to see Izumi. </br></br>  I just want them to resolve the fucking overarching romance plot points holy shit. They dragged it on for two whole seasons.  I HAVE A NEW EPISODE LIKE 5 DAYS EVERY WEEK NOW<br><br>HOLY SHIT<br><br>FUCKING LET'S DO THIS</br></br></br></br>  Just take some condoms.  Kyouko-san what kind of panties do you wear?  SHITAGI?!!  <br>Nopan. She ate them.</br>  <br>How is Kyouko so sexual? She's not even trying.</br>    Normal is the best.  <br>Yamada. Soon.</br>      <br/>  <br>Yamada, jama.</br>      SLUT    About damn time.  IT IS HAPPENING    <br> not watching enough anime to have two-three new episodes every day </br>    Deito  <br><br>Is it happening?</br></br>  <br>REEEE</br>        <br>her sword is funnier with casual clothes than her waitress outfit.</br>  <br><br>I guess they will drag it out for half an episode more, before going for Takanashi-Inami.</br></br>  <br>I think they'll keep it for the season finale (still needs a lot of development).</br>  <br>Well, that development gotta start somewhere and judging by preview it's going to be next episode.</br>  <br> Season finale equals series finale <br>How does this make you feel, anons?</br></br>  I've added this to the list of shows I'm currently watching, only on episode 5 of season 1 right now.<br><br>/a/ has been surprisingly good with it's tastes in anime  for a change.  Everything I've started watching is because I see people on here talking about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Yamada is equally annoying</br></br>  <br>Surprisingly, I didn't find her too annoying this episode for some reason.</br>  <br><br>fucking slut</br></br>  <br>Kinda sad, I don't want my SoL in which I feel bond with characters to end  I will probablz feel sad for few days and move to another frenchise as always ;_; </br>  <br>To be honest, I'd rather have them finish it than drag it for another season, there's barely any content not yet adapted.</br>  <br>This. Finish strong.</br>  <br>It got 3 seasons, which is more than most anime get.<br>It's ok.</br></br>  YAMADAAA  <br>Yamada ?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Km<wbr>-yfase3k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  OP2 &gt; OP1 &gt; OP3<br>ED1 &gt; ED2 &gt; ED3</br>  <br>Adsoluting hetstupid!<br>Since it was another antiyuri twist</br></br>  <br>OP1 = OP2 &gt; OP3</br>  <br>Acceptable opinion. Just this makes OP2 better than OP1 though.</br>  <br><br>OP1 = (OP2 + OP3)^2<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1oN<wbr>8RPklUac</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think the only thin we'll ever agree on is that the S3 OP/ED's are vastly inferior to the others period.</br></br></br>  Poplar or Popura?  <br>Katanashi or Takanashi?</br>  <br>Yamada or Yamada?</br>  <br>Only right answer is both.</br>  <br> watching anime <br> on Tuesdays </br></br>  <br>S3 ED isn't that bad, might grow on me as the season goes.<br><br>The OP is just bland, the lyrics are boring and the animation only has the Popura segment going strong.</br></br></br>  <br>I think there are a few good things about the OP, but I really don't like the ED except for Inami's little dance moves. But the OP has the Popura jumping on Popura antenna (including Yamada as fake Popura) and the endless parfait, both of which are neat.<br>But yeah, otherwise thoroughly underwhelming unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>Popular</br>  Wait, Inami has actually not punched anybody in 2 episodes so far. Not even in OP.<br>Will this be the season where she's cured? I haven't read the manga.</br>  <br>She will punch someone in the next episode.</br>  <br><br>Strangely enough, I never find her annoying.<br>She's always lovable, cute and adorable.</br></br></br>  <br>It's over already  ;_; <br><br><br>I'm only looking at Kyouko in her segment so the parfait is not that important, it does look nice, though. The batting scene looks neat too, but they are lacking something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yamada is quite funny to me.<br><br>Yamada-kun, on the other hand is quite annoying.</br></br></br>  ded show  <br>I don't mind Yamada-kun. I'm glad he doesn't show up all the time though, his antics are only suitable for small doses imo.</br>  Are subs delayed? They should've been out by now.  <br>Looks like it.</br>  <br>Hardly.</br>  <br><br>Same. The "Daisy Punch" bit last ep melted my heart.</br></br>  <br>UNFUNFUNF</br>  <br>Should be here for an hour now.</br>  CREEP is out  <br> [CReep] Working!!! - 03 [1080p].mkv <br><br><br>CR changed the simulcast time to 11:00 for some reason and I guess HS doesn't notice the schedule change so their ripper most likely missed it.</br></br></br></br>   Not petting Yamada properly after all her hard work <br>Not even a Yamadafag, but holy shit Takanashi is a cunt.</br>  <br>Daisy sure is strong.</br>  <br>I don't blame him, Yamada is such a burden to most of the time for Katanashi.</br>  <br> hard work <br>More like normal work that everyone in the shop does everyday.</br></br>    <br>Why does Satou dye his hair.</br>  <br>Part of his delinquent image.</br>   manga ended <br> we never learned shit about Souma <br>I wonder why...</br></br>  <br>Cause that's what defined him as a character.</br>  <br>Aren't you happy he kind of became a better person as the series progressed? Especially after Yamada pointed out how lonely he truly was.</br>  <br> Aren't you happy he kind of became a better person as the series progressed? <br>He did? He always seemed caring of the people working at Wagnaria. That never changed.</br></br>  <br>He only started caring after the first season, even trying to help Satou with Yachiyo whenever he could.<br>All he did was enjoy other's misfortunes during the first season.</br></br>  Do you even work?  <br>That was S2.</br>  Was the manager ever this sexual in the previous seasons?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I wonder if guys hit on Nazuna whenever she's outside.<br>She doesn't look her at in the slightest, and comparing her to girls like Inami and Yamada, she could pass as 17-18.<br><br>It could make for some funny moments, with guys hitting on her, Nazuna being oblivious to their advances, and them eventually learning she's actually 12 - then one of them realises it he doesn't dislike it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please do not sexualize Nazuna. There are three superior Takanashi sisters who are of legal age.</br>  <br> Nazuna being oblivious to their advances <br>Yeah, no.</br></br>  <br>But Nazuna really likes helping in the house.</br>  <br>Yamada vs Yamada</br>  JUST FUCK ALREADY  <br>NO, WE MUST DRAG IT OUT A LITTLE LONGER</br>  <br>Downloading right now, I bet she's still a dense shit and think he means being friends with her or something something Kyouko</br>  <br>Jesus Satou you might be coming on a little strong there pal.</br>  Working?  <br>Did they get together there? If so we will probably get Yamada's mother next.</br>  <br>Working has fucking amazing pace for it's romantic development as far as anime goes. You know not the true meaning of JUST FUCK ALREADY.</br>  <br>So many body types, so little time.</br>  <br>GGGGAAAAAINNNNAAAAXXXXXXXX</br>  <br>Yeah they did. They're probably going to drag it out.</br>  <br>I want to feed manager!</br>  <br> Leaving drunk girl on the middle of the streat instead of walking her home <br>Satou is a terrible person, calling taxi or not.</br></br>  <br>Your wallet couldn't handle it.</br>  <br>He cameback</br>  <br>To call a taxi and leave again.</br>  <br>She was probably raped by the taxist that night.</br>  <br>Kyoani too.<br>UGH.</br></br>  <br>Don't remind me.</br>  <br>I now see why Kyoko has so many followers.</br>  Lewd.  <br><br>Why do I want to have sex with her</br></br>  <br>she's hot</br>   old hag <br> hot <br>These people.</br></br>  <br>Takanashi pls</br>    Local Yamada Ruins Everything  <br>Yamada is an innocent victim in a cruel, headpatless world</br>  I want to teach lewd things to Yamada.  This episode was amazing, I haven't laughed this hard at a show since the Sabagebu finale.  Great episode. Glad I got around to binging the first two seasons so I can wathc this with /a/.<br>One of the best things about this show is the hilarious over-the-top episode previews.</br>  I'M GETTING LUNCH THEN GONNA SETTLE DOWN FOR SOME WORKING  AOTS<br><br>It was worth the wait.</br></br>  <br>Yamada is shocked by your honesty, but Yamada is not completely opposed to it.</br>   Yachiyo centric with Yamada B plot <br>If you don't think this was the best episode of the show yet, fuck your shit.</br>  I'm having a hard time deciding if Satou or Souma is best girl.  Was it always this many Yamadas?  Are they multiplying?   <br>It's actually Yamada. If this season doesn't end with Yamada x Katanashi I'm going to cry.</br>  It's spreading!  <br>it'll be a Yamada harem ending</br>  <br>You fool, it's:<br>Takanashi x Inami<br>Satou x Yachiyo<br>Souma x Yamada<br>Parfait x Kyouko</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, was about to post this too.</br></br>  <br>Daisy also shifted back to be closer o Yamada.</br>  <br><br>but what would we call it?</br></br>  <br><br>We may not be able to contain it.</br></br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br>why contain it?</br>  Kazue started ovulating in this exact moment.  <br>Daisy appears to be acting as a Yamada vector.</br>  <br>Let the Yamada's pile up in the streets.</br>  Does anybody have a compilation image of all the different hairpins Inami has worn throughout the seasons?  <br>Her neck is so long</br>  <br><br>Wasn't there only one in the first episode? I wasn't paying attention in episode 2 but holy shit that escalated quickly.</br></br>  I dont care if she's still in the elementary school, i want to marry Nazuna and become a part of the Takanashi household.  <br>Normally I give guys shit for not fucking the girls that are throwing themselves at them.<br><br>But she's a drunk turbo slut so I understand his apprehension.</br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/gwutzpwuts.web<wbr>m<br><br>shō<br><br>bu?</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I also want to marry into their household</br>  Best episode so far.  <br>shoubu pantsu</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>This is what i've been waiting for since the 1st season. Thank you based A-1 for delivering this scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  Just how big is Nazuna going to be?  Did I miss a webm or gif of Yamada getting headpat?

She should voice more roles in non-hentai anime.</br></br>    <br>I never knew I liked unpleated skirts until I watched this show.</br>  Not a bad episode so far in the season, proving once and for all what I always suspected - The show's better when Inami's treated like a background character.  <br>O T P<br>T<br>P</br></br></br>  Could anybody webm daisy punch from ep2, please?  <br>she's getting the next episode, and it'll be great</br>  <br> Inami ep <br> great <br><br>No, she's garbage.

I hate Inami.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you hate her?</br>  <br>You have shit taste, Inami a cute.</br>  <br>i could see finding her plotlines a bit tedious, especially early on in the show, but she's been written a lot better since somewhere during season 2. chill out and enjoy the working.</br>  <br>You.

I'm so glad to see a series get finished for once.</br>    Working has surprisingly little fanart/hentai for a show that's successful enough to be in its third season.<br>Why's that? Is the show hugely popular with normals but not with otakus or something?</br>  <br>Correct.<br><br><br>An equally good opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Do girls like to be petted?</br></br></br>  <br>She hasn't punched anyone since episode 7 of LAST season.</br>  <br>Stop that.</br>  <br><br>No, they're not dogs. Japs are into it because it makes 2D girls look demure and submissive.</br></br>  <br>She's kind of stacked.</br>  <br>I want to marry 5-year-old Poplar.</br>  <br>Everything likes headpats.</br>  <br>But they are bitches.</br>  <br>If I put my cock in a parfait, will she lick it clean?</br>  <br>She'll bite it right off.</br>  <br>Worth it.</br>  <br> Nazuna <br>I think I'm on some sort of list now.</br></br>  <br> Is the show hugely popular with normals but not with otakus  <br>It's a workplace comedy, what do you think?</br></br>  Satou must fucking hate Kozue now.<br>Well, at least she gave a conversation topic for Yachiyo other than Kyouko.</br>    <br> 170cm  <br>What a goddamn manlet.</br></br>  <br>Isn't he fine for a high schooler?</br>  <br>Isn't it normal for a recurring character to speak once in a while?</br>  <br>Do they have Uber/Lyft in Japan?</br>  <br><br><br>What is 170 in american?</br></br></br>  <br> tfw uber is now legally forbidden here.  <br><br>I fucking hate the taxis.</br></br></br>  <br>Japan, dude.</br>  <br>5'6/5'7 i think</br>  <br>Isn't he year 2 or 3?

Maybe you are starting to like older women.</br>  <br>Nope, mine.</br>  It's easier to get away from jail impregnating Nazuna than Poplar  <br>Is she even birth safe?</br>  <br>Isn't he 16? I think it's kinda normal, he can still grow a little</br>  <br> supporting assholes who don't give you drinks, aren't polite, are most of the time mudslims, often refuses to take you for a short travel at night, refuses you if you have a pet, are expensive, try to fuck you up by taking a longer route even when you know the city yourself and then go and whine when a better alternative is presented because muh unfair competition. </br>  <br>I've always liked older women, I jus don't remember her being this sexy, maybe I'm wrong, I was waiting for this season to end to marathon everything</br>  <br>Go watch the other OP's - her ass is way more defined with the shading in OP3 than the others where the're only a line or two.<br>That plus the licking.</br></br>  Oh god, she's too Innocent. I want to introduce her to the world of lewd.  <br> I've always liked older women </br>  <br> and they like what they see </br>  OH GOD<br>MY<br>FUCKING <br>HEART<br>HNGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the imagery of someone sitting at their computers with dozens of pictures of Kyouko's butt comparing them as the seasons progress.</br>  <br>Poor girl ruined her new panties.</br>  Third season is already over. That was fast.  <br> 5-year-old Poplar <br><br>MUH  HEART </br></br></br>  <br>Heh</br>    <br> 480x270 <br> 2.77 MB <br> .gif </br></br></br>  <br>Gross, take your hands off the fucking ground you filthy girl.</br>  <br>Honestly, that would kinda hurt your knees.</br>  <br>She's used to being on her knees.</br>  <br>No she isn't.<br>Get your mind out of the gutter.</br></br>  <br><br>This is fucking disgusting, I'm dropping this series</br></br>  I have no idea what this was about. Who is this guy? Who even was the girl with the voodoo doll? What do they have to do with Yachiyo?  <br>watch the other seasons</br>  <br>I meant she's used to being on her knees cleaning up the constant mess Yamada makes. You're the one with your mind in the gutter.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the second season?</br>  <br><br>I did. I don't recall those two characters whatsoever.</br></br>  <br>Only if you're fat. I use to do that when I worked retail and never hurt my knees.</br>  <br>they're former thugs that used to run with the manager and want to protect the chief from potential bad guys</br>  <br>They were part of Kyouko's gang of delinquents.</br>  <br>They weren't that relevant so it's not hard to believe you forgot. They're part of Kyouko's group of underlings.</br>  .<br> I use to do that when I worked retail <br>Yeah I wouldn't call that "retail"</br></br>  Bumping for relevance until I see the episode.  <br>Gotta make money to buy plastic butts somehow.</br>    <br>It's great, isn't it?</br>  tfw Souma has no friends  <br> tfw his Wagnaria friends are his only friensd </br>  <br>God she is so cute.</br>  <br>I want to be Souma's friend.</br>  Why is it so  ___adorable  to watch this ~4'7" gift from above get bullied?  <br><br>Are you fucking serious? <br><br>I joke about shit taste a lot but this is actually just disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least he works at Wagnaria. I'd kill to work there.</br>  <br><br>He's got Yamada all over him. Motherfucker doesn't need anything else.</br></br>  <br><br>Souma must have friends. We just don't know anything about him. <br><br>He's handsome, cocky, supportive, charismatic and connected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Surprisingly, yes.</br>  I'm a faggot and I like to be pet on the head. Makes you feel like a kid, and it makes you feel proud of yourself. Who doesn't like to feel nostalgic and proud?

I want to pet Yamada's head.    <br>I don't want Souma to represent me, I'm a fucking loser.  ;_; </br>  <br>Gotta leave in the disappointment for a grade 2 Takanashi Petting.</br>  <br>I read it in yamada's voice</br>  <br><br><br>HOLY SHIT</br></br></br>  such an unfair world, why they gave yamada such a NICE BODY  <br>Naisu bori.</br>  <br> advice to wear colored or patterned panties in order to conceal one's disgusting personal hygiene rather than away aspire to untainted white <br><br> is over there</br></br></br>  IS SOUMA GOING TO END UP WITH YAMADA? THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME  <br>That is a fucked up pairing.</br>  <br>I just don't want him to be alone ;_;</br>  <br> Any kind of stain will make it look like you've shit yourself. <br>You need to shit yourself for it to look like you've shit yourself. Stop being disgusting.</br></br>  <br>How often does your underwear get stained?<br>This should not being happening often at all.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he called one of the twins, they'd figure it out.</br>  <br>W-well...</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/546681/7dfd4a<wbr>e3af/</wbr></br>  Who loves Inamin?  <br>We live in a fast paced dog eat dog world. Who has time to wipe his ass when there's so much that needs to be done?</br>  <br>She is objectively the best character.   besides Yamada   She's had the most development so far, and she hasn't punched anyone since last season AND she's now able to serve male customers.</br>  <br>Inami is cute!</br>  <br>The finally figured out who the best character in the cast is. Prepare yourselves for the Yamada Revolution!</br>  <br>I do. Inami is a work in progress that just requires patience and understanding. Behind her treatable mental illness she's perfectly normal and deserves to be loved.</br>  <br> it's okay to wear shit stained underpants if the stain isn't noticeable <br>Is that how 3D women think?</br></br>  <br>I honestly hated her in S1.<br>S2 made me actually enjoy her.<br>S3 I have heart attacks with how cute she is.</br></br></br>  What is it about this show that makes it so fun? This is one of the only anime I have seen where my mood actually improves after watching.  <br>It's finely tuned propaganda with the purpose of convincing neets like us to get a job</br>    <br>Good characters?</br>  <br> flat <br> shy <br> broken <br>Just how I like it. She's great.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still not enough to make her open eyes. What would it take?</br>    <br><br>I love Inami, I love the sisters, but why the fuck is Yamada relegated to background girl? She's clearly moe queen. Best girl should not be stuck with side tasks every other episode.</br></br>  <br>Go back to work, Yamada.</br>  <br>Too much of a good thing can be hazardous for your health.</br>  <br>Yamada is trash. Incompetent and unable to follow simple instructions.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up<br><br>I'm going to spoil Yamada rotten</br></br></br>  <br><br>I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS<br>IT WAS PERFECT</br></br></br>  Watching this show and self-insert as Satou really make me stress.  <br><br>She literally spends an episode being a good worker, and sipshit Mc. Youngwomen calls her out. So she sobs outside and then calls him hentai cause he is literally a pervert. Yamada based as fuck, try harder bitch and also you're a faggot too so don't suck too many dicks before you reply.</br></br>  <br><br>Why self insert with anybody? They're all apart from you, it's a true comedy which is rare in the K-On! wasteland. Just have fun, because fun things are...   good  .</br></br>  <br>takanashi is short...</br>  <br>He is a 16 years old asian boy.</br>  <br>Yamada has broken more plates than Inami has punched men.</br>  <br>Best girl. She tries so hard and she's twice as cute as  Poplar. </br>  Can someone make a gif or webm of Souma hugging Daisy?  <br>Should I include Yamada in the crop?</br>  who was this guy again?<br><br>Also his voice sounds familiar.</br></br>  <br>Sure, I like Souma and Yamada together.</br>  <br><br>The other twin delinquent associate of Kyouko's, voiced by Nakamura Yuuichi</br></br>  <br><br>it's Kirino's brother</br></br>  <br> Episode 3 <br> Things actually happen <br>Nothing could have prepared me for this.</br></br></br>  <br> capture and encode without audio <br> crop and encode <br> "this file appears to be corrupt" <br> works fine locally <br> re-encode with a different program <br> "audio is not allowed" <br> re-encode, disable audio even though it wasn't present in the first place <br> "audio is not allowed" <br> same file works in all steps without audio <br>moot please</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nakamura voicing Clannad-man, Onii-sama, MC from Koisento Chocolate something and that harem with Ghost, Tulip, Dirt.</br>  Oh goddamn, finally an anime confession that isn't stupid bullshit.  <br>THANK YOU BASED SHAFT</br>  <br>The production values are good, the cast is balanced, no high school setting, great character dynamics, no one (usually steals) screentime and now the authors biggest offense (status quo maintenance) has just been removed.<br><br>I'm very, very happy.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon!<br>Have a Yamada in return.</br></br>  <br><br>It's linked to his cell phone which is linked to his credit card and gives the taxi company the location at the time of call, there are apps for this in some countries. <br><br>Pretty great for a drunk night out imo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is a mobile app. for that in where I live.  fucking Turkey of all places . I'm pretty sure Japan has something of similar use too.</br>  <br>Nakamura. And now I always laughing whenever he use his young voice because He's an old man now.</br>  It's like someone said Paul Reubens' secret word  <br>That Tokyo Encounter episode with Hiro Shimono<br><br>"Ossan dayo ne"</br></br></br>  Do the Japanese really pour beer like this? Look at that fucking thing, it's like half head.  <br>Of course. Anime is 100% representative of reality 100% of the time</br>  <br><br>She's is also nicest girl. Trying to help others with their problems and worries for them (Takanashi included with his sisters/trying to make him happy).</br></br>  This show is so great. Every characters so lovable.  <br>Yeah, that's the reason I always see him as an oldman now.</br>  Need 1 more chapter for Satou vs Kyoko + Mitsuki<br><br>1 more for Satou want Yachiyo to unequip sword<br><br>1 more for Satou Yachiyo quit Wagnaria and end her dependency with Kyoko</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl of the series. I still can't understand why people doesn't like her. The reason he always punching a man is because her phobia not because she like it. And she always do her best.</br>  <br>The violence was constant to the point of her being one-note in season 1, and the hate that generated carried over into season 2 and even into the interim before season 3, despite her easing up. /a/'s had a lot of poster turnover since the first season aired though, so that, combined with the fact that we're three episodes into s3 and she's yet to hit somebody, should effectively snuff out any remaining Inami hate.</br>  <br>This scene woke in my a really strong desire to hug Daisy and I don't know where to put that emotion now.</br>  Ded thread. <br><br>Why is nobody watching this?</br></br>  <br>I can confirm this. Inami is growing on me exponentially every episode so far this season.</br>  <br>For me it was just the length of time between seasons. Any annoyance I had from the first two have died away due to the years. I even like Yamada now, and I didn't back then. Probably the only repeating gag I still don't like is the boss's wife.</br>  How do I acquire my own Yamada?  <br>Because the first two seasons were only 14 months apart and season three took 4 years. With how fast shit gets more seasons now and how rapidly trends in popular shows have shifted over the last five years, no one cares about another season of a show from four years ago. 2000-2010 you could safely go 3-4 years between seasons without fans losing interest, but that's long past.</br>  <br>Maybe he did that intentionally because those were for his sister.</br>  <br> expecting a family restaurant to give you good amount of beer for your buck </br>  <br>It's about goddamn time. This was fucking fantastic to see</br>  <br>Imagine if Souma were to see that.</br>  <br>Someone needs to do the counting. I still think Inami would win.</br>  <br><br>Hell, look at Durarara 2. Not even Japan cares anymore.</br></br>  <br>Judging by this thread, I know how he'd react</br>  <br>But Yachiyo is a lesbian.</br>  <br>Isn't Working!!! popular in Japan right now though? I think it was #2 on the stalker chart thingamabob.</br>  Anyone have a gif or webm of Satou asking Yachiyo out then Souma cheering?    She spoke!<br>But this is not the first nor the final episode. I do not understand.</br>  <br>Series got cancelled.</br>  <br>thanks anon</br>  <br>I didn't know Souma can do ballet.</br>  <br>I've always liked her, even when /a/ shat on her during season 1. She's the cutest.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>He's a natural</br>  Yamada is a Queen  <br>Second season Durarara introduce more people that I barely interested thus I don't remember most of their name.</br>  OH MY GOD SHE TALKED.  <br>Who's that?</br>  <br>It's awesome to see Matsumoto slowly being infected by the rest of the crew into participating in their shenanigans.</br>  <br><br><br><br>So nice, I watched it twice. <br>And then a couple more times after.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br>This kills the pepe.</br>  Inumi is shit  <br>Inami a cute.</br>  <br> Fujita Saki's wonderful voice wasted on that shit <br>Makes me sad every time</br></br>  <br>how wet her panties?</br>  <br>So wet she had to get a new pair.</br>  NICE BODY  <br><br><br>So what kind of shitty excuse will pussy slayer Satou use to clear up the confused dyke's confusion? A ghost? A bug on her back? I'm glad Satou's finally making his move but I have the feeling he's going to pussy out.</br></br></br>  Would you buy a new pair if I asked you out for a drink, anon?  <br>What does the stain on her new white panties look like?</br>  <br>That's only for Satou and her to know.  And maybe Kyouko. </br>  Which is your favorite big-breasted character?  all of them  <br>Mai waifu.</br>  Meat  <br> there will never be a sequel to this <br><br>Fuck cliffhangers.</br></br></br>  <br>his dick grew 10 inches and they fucked again.

Big tits are not meant for looking. They are meant to be physically abused.</br>    100% Suzune  <br>Chickens have breasts though.</br>  <br> not keeping the aspect ratio of each image <br>stop being a hyper nigger. it's like you don't even love them.<br>also<br> Riza Hawkeye <br> big breasted <br>nigga what. she has flared hips, not big boobs</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good choice.<br><br><br>Better choice.</br></br></br></br>          <br>Google and saucenao give me jack shit.</br>            <br>I'm afraid that you are mistaken.

Why does Kiyoshi get all the fine bitches?  Tell that to Hiramoto  <br>Does it already count as a generic harem series?</br>  she already does that fine just by her self   check Gelbooru <br> nothing but Meiko porn <br><br>This is how it should be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>no it doesnt, Hana is the only girl that likes Kiyoshi after 180 fucking chapters</br></br>  <br>but mari is also confirmed entranced by kiyoshi's ass</br>  <br>Who is Chiyo?</br>  <br>someone who friendzoned kiyoshi early on</br>  <br>But she was jealous when that whole Kiyoshi/Mari thing went down.</br>  <br>that was only supposed to look like jealously to fool the readers. it was later explained that she was honestly worried for mari as she was rumoured to have become a slut</br>  <br>More like worried about her sisters honor and school reputation.</br>  <br> seeing that her man is happy wearing chiyo's headband she changes her mind and forces him to keep her panties on <br>Hana is the only girl who has displayed jealously in the series so far...oh there's Risa too</br></br>  <br> citation needed </br>  <br><br>Because he had great taste</br></br>  <br>That was never touched on again. It was a gateway into getting her to kiss his ass. The entire point of that scene was to humiliate mari after all the bullshit she did at the start.</br>  <br>She was only worried about mari this has been discussed a lot.</br>  <br>are you serious? did you completely miss the poison sucking chapters?<br><br><br>it was confirmed back then with the flashback and mari's behaviour (she got horny while sucking kiyoshi's ass)</br></br></br></br>  <br> That was never touched on again. <br>it's akira we are talking about here. you can bet that he hasn't forgotten about that</br></br>  <br>if its akira were talking about then you can expect something that completely shatters your expectations, she could find an even better guys ass. I recall gakuto having quite an ass.</br>  <br>fair enough, but so far my point still stands.<br>In addition, she's going to spend more time with kiyoshi than the other boys in the next few chapters because of the cavalry battles</br></br>  <br>And glasses bro girl, she cried and shit when she thought he was taken away by joe</br>  <br>But that still doesn't mean she likes him, so until proven differently her or chiyo doesn't have romantic feeling for him. Hell I, not even sure if Mari even likes him as a person</br>  So i started reading this after putting it off for ages and..<br>Jesus christ, I get the feeling I'm reading the wrong translation.</br>  <br>Because of a nice ass? What his father told her was that any guy with a nice ASS! can't be a bad person, not that she should fall for any guy with a a nice ass.</br>  <br>That guy must be joking.</br>  <br> Tyranny </br>  <br>I never said that she fell for kiyoshi, I was talking about his ass.</br>  <br><br>So you're saying that you think Kiyoshi has a nice ass?</br></br>  <br><br>Easily yes.</br></br>  So why did Mari start hating her dad?  <br>Mine is better.</br>  <br>I guess I am..</br>  <br>The only thing we know is because hes a pervert.</br>  <br>Try to guess.</br>  <br> implying she doesn't have a repressed father complex </br>  <br>perhaps his indiscretions caused a divorce?</br>  <br>Whoah, wait a minute. Is it already Monday? Japanese raws were already released?</br>  <br>yup</br>  <br><br>She didn't understand the ass mans life.</br></br>  <br>everyone has a brain fart once in a while.<br>this happens when you don't hire proofreaders.</br></br>  <br> Utopia hasnt even done 183 yet <br><br>Yes i know it was translated but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Their site has been down for days as well.</br>  <br>Do people not understand what a harem is? If there are two girls then it's just a triangle. Mari has not shown any interest in Kiyoshi. Chiyo is debatable, but not really.<br><br>I also disagree with the anon who said that Hana's only interested in him sexually. Obviously she's interested in him romantically, why else would she have snatched the headband from Chiyo or let him keep her underwear on? I mean, really.</br></br></br>  <br> or let him keep her underwear on? <br>she didn't "let" him, she forced him to keep her underwear on after witnessing his happy face while wearing chiyo's headband</br></br>  <br>He didn't resist &amp; agreed to it so he wasn't forced to do shit.<br><br>Also, doesn't change the fact that she has romantic feelings for him.</br></br></br>  <br>She probably got into some embarrassing situations for the ethical asspects her dad taught her.</br>  <br>  doesn't change the fact that she has romantic feelings for him. <br>I wasn't really trying to confute that<br> He didn't resist &amp; agreed to it so he wasn't forced to do shit. <br>he didn't object because his head was still spinning after all the concentrated shit happened in the previous chapters but hana clearly told him to keep her underwear on no matter what</br></br></br></br>  <br>So did Kate have a tight butt Mari get herself into?</br>  <br> Do people not understand what a harem is? <br>They do. Controversial posts just help to get a discussion going.</br></br>  Probably my favorite page  <br>No wonder most male MC are beta seeing that page it's the best mix of being in love and being serious for the girl.</br>  <br>His head was not spinning, that was the<br>Point of the scene w/Gakuto.</br></br>  <br>but that's what he keeps repeating himself in ch 184</br>  So Hana has to win right?<br><br> She has pictures of them making out. They've pissed all over each other. Unless Hana is ready to get into some freaky shit and accept that the guys has been macking with another broad, Hana should be the default winner </br></br>  <br> My brain isnt working <br><br>Just means hes still thinking about things.</br></br></br>  <br> unless hana <br>Chiyo</br></br>  <br>He went from being scared of Chiyo to finding his resolve and declaring that he still likes her. That's a complete 180 of earlier.</br>  <br>Hana has to come out &amp; be honest, I think. Once she can do that then maybe, but I'm kinda hoping that Kiyoshi &amp; Chiyo do it first &amp; it doesn't work out. Who knows with this manga though?</br>  <br>He wasnt scared of chiyo herself, he was scared of the idea of corrupting her which is why he says stay away from me. What declaration?</br>  <br>yes but what does that have to do with my post? my only point is that hana genuinely likes kiyoshi. As you mentioned, Kiyoshi is still going after chiyo</br>  <br><br>He's chasing an ideal girl that doesn't exist. But that's ok, in the end, his Id will prevail.</br></br>  <br>Hana has so has Chiyo.</br>  <br>I don't know, it depends whether akira wants to drag things out or not. he might give in to anime fags (if sales go well) and turn the series into a more conventional harem series by adding chiyo and maybe mari to kiyoshi's harem for real</br>  <br>No they havent. Hana at least gives him huge clues but neither chiyo nor hana have directly come out and told him.</br>  <br>It's not their fault he suffers from MCitis <br><br>literally can't be any more forward<br> Grope me as much as you want <br> My sisters a slut if she's trying to get you <br><br>vs<br> Show me your dick <br> Make out sessions <br> Pissing on each other <br> General jealousy <br><br>Coming out and saying it would just be pointless at this stage</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was scared of corrupting her, b/c he thought he was corrupted.</br>  <br> Grope me as much as you want <br>You're misinterpreting this scene completely. If she actually wanted him to grope her she wouldnt have started crying. This is the penultimate result of her sisters flashback thinking of "You can't understand it until you try it" and chiyo constantly repeating "Its settled my sister really is a slut".</br></br>  <br><br>I doubt it, but it's possible. It would certainly be disappointing, as has had very little actual interaction with anyone besides Hana.</br></br>  Just started reading this yesterday, and shit's gotten really fucking bad since the introduction of the real student council. The whole plot is now moving on retarded yaoi and SM antics for the boys, and SLUT MISUNDERSTANDINGS for the sisters and MC. The fabled ass-man turned out to be a pussy-ass bitch too<br><br>Its almost unbelievable how this manga turned into complete shit in just this arc</br></br>  I love the mango, but why can't I get myself to watch the anime?  <br>Stop reading it then.</br>  <br>  JC Staff <br><br>It's okay</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point. If she liked Kiyoshi she would not have done that. I wonder if the scenes with Chiyo seeming that she suspects them are really going to be a red herring or she ends misinterpreting them. Though it can't be a coincidence that she keeps interrupting them. She, almost seems like the antagonist to their progress.</br>  Someone can translate the title of chapter 183 for me please?  <br>She is an urine slut.<br><br><br>He lied about that.<br><br><br> not even sure if Mari even likes him as a person <br><br>Why would you think that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Theres a huge buildup of misunderstandings and jumping to her own conclusions with her. Shes going to be completely disappointed when nobody gives a shit about her birthday in the way she thinks everyone is preparing for it. It sounds like a buildup to where we see a darkside to her that kiyoshi will mostly likely not enjoy at all and start to wonder.</br>  What's going to be really awesome about this anime is that while a good portion of them will start to do that shit where they start off strong &amp; end pretty weak this one will have a solid ending.  So will fugly get NTR'd?   There is no such thing as a bad sumo-love <br> There is no such thing as a bad crow-lover <br> There is no such thing as a bad Ass lover  <br><br>Sumo is the mother<br>Crows are the sister<br>Ass is the father<br><br>So what's Chiyo's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking it </br>  <br>Because even if she does show him more respect for how much he has help her she still doesn't seem to trust or like him. It feels like she's waiting for him to fuck up so she can start hating him again</br>  <br>change ring</br>  <br> not liking yaoi and SM antics </br>  <br><br>no wait, I think it's "changeling" from the movie</br></br>  <br>don't make /v/ tier threads</br>  <br> her whole character is built upon assumptions and jumping to conclusions, think about even since her first introduction <br> seen MC easer and assumed he liked sumo also <br>  jump to the conclusion that since he (faked) like sumo and help a crow he couldn't had peeked on the girls and wasn't a bad person  <br>  seen he had her outfit and assumed he was a pervert, turned him in and act him in trouble  <br>  assumed her sister was a slut <br> assumed the boys actually cared enough about her to find out about her Bday and make her a gift <br>  assumed the mc wanted his blankets on the floor folded and that they weren't for a reason  <br> assumed the panties belonged to glasses bro  <br>Etc basically she's a plain person who usually makes situation worse with her assumption</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Changeling is a 2008 American drama film, written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence.<br> female disempowerment, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence. <br><br>sounds about right</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no such thing as a bad  liar. </br>  <br>its fine when it doesn't stall a heated arc for 40 chapters<br>I can't stand watching those faggots episodically build that rocket with retarded Andre running around anymore</br></br>  <br>I agree with the slut-arc, could have been shorter. <br><br>The boys building the PBR instead of an actual simple bottle rocket was fucking hilarious and completely in-character, one of these pooped his pants in front of the whole class, the other one got naked and placed a bottle on his penis in front of his girlfriend and the third one was planning to run bound in ropes into the girls' changing room. They're fucking retarded.<br><br>It starts gaining momentum again, don't worry.<br>Also why the fuck do you think the assman is a bitch?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed Andre at the start, now I feel as though he ruins any panel he's in.</br>  <br>Cause his character lives from Meiko.The confident one.</br>  <br><br>Meiko got annoying as well, with all the fucking sweating.</br></br>  <br> Also why the fuck do you think the assman is a bitch? <br>His daughter's best friend (also his student) gets abused into mindbreak and he won't take his own daughter's word on that. She needs help, not get locked alone in a room<br>And then there's rumors all over the school about his daughters being sluts, and they also get bullied for that.</br></br></br>  <br>mari treated him like a bitch through the whole first arc and he took it without putting her in her place. guy's down with midlife crisis, he needs to get back on track sure.</br>  <br>*soon, not sure</br>   such a talented artist spends his time drawing perverted high school stories <br>And not a day goes by that I don't thank the gods that there are people like this in the world.</br>  <br><br>wait for bd</br></br>  <br>Thx ;D , ahhh and this frase on vice abdomen?</br>  <br>I mean, she caught him red-handed with literally porn. The Chairman's hijinks are one of the things that make this manga so special for me.</br>  <br>Did she enjoy getting peed on?</br>  <br>well, he should have explained to her that there's nothing wrong with porn. catching him is not the problem, the problem is her thinking he's doing something wrong</br>  <br>Mari was right.<br>It is wrong to be caught like that.</br></br>  <br>Mari wasn't right. She wasn't mad that she caught him. She was mad he was reading porn, regardless if he got caught or not, because she considers porn something bad. Which is really dumb.</br>  <br>No she wasnt. What he does in his free time is none of her god damn buisness.</br>  So did Chairman cheat on his wife is that why Mari hates him?  <br>I have the feeling it's either that or a boy did something bad/pervy to mari. In both cases it'd be really poor and cheap, I hope the mangaka can come up with something better than this.</br>  <br>something like: "in the end, the style is going to match the fashion"</br>  <br><br>God is faces on women have gotten so shit.<br><br>I loved his realistic approach in the early chapter, he's gone more and more animu with each chapter, chapter 250 will have them with no fucking noses.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being caught watching porn at work  <br>that's not exactly his free time</br></br>  <br>Not in the school which would not matter if he had not been caught.</br>    <br> weekly issues <br> better art than monthly issued manga <br>how does he do it?</br></br></br>  <br>He loves what he does and it shows.</br>   I can't pee when I have an erection <br><br>that's incorrect...</br></br>  <br>A lot of backgrounds and props are photographs.</br>  <br>I want to believe. I want to believe that Chiyo's character is going to turn around at some point.<br><br>Reading back in the story there's a lot of foreshadowing &amp; mirroring. Maybe that scene with her during the Sumo thing is a sign of things to come when she realizes that everyone lied to her, especially Kiyoshi?</br></br></br>  <br>If you seriously think mari was mad because he was reading porn in school, as opposed to reading porn in general, your reading comprehension is in the negatives.</br>  <br>I think it's way less than you think. If anything he rises a lot of panels aside from the flashbacks.</br>  <br>*reuses</br>  <br>It does matter where you read your porn.</br>  The fact the author is sexualizing Hana more in the latest chapters doesn't bode well, so far the only reason to believe she might have won was the fact that she's the only one that hasn't show her tits.  <br>not to mari. she's mad at porn regardless of where.<br>besides, a principal who's alone in his office room reading porn might be a little in poor taste, but it's not like it's morally reprehensible. still, the point stays, location was not the reason for mari's reaction.</br></br>  <br>Well, he also writes that manga about Robert Johnson, he's pretty versatile.</br>  <br>Wtf are you talking about? Hasn't the author been specializing Kiyoshi too?! Hasn't the big joke with Hana that they have been having sexy time together?</br>  <br>Dumbest post of the day award goes to....</br>  Link to the raws?  <br>Hana will steal all the MC's first but Chiyo will still win</br>  <br>This , being hana is suffering.<br>Funny suffering.</br></br>  <br>*sexualizing</br>  <br> tfw Hana is his first girlfriend too </br>  <br>Thank you ;D</br>  <br> Hana is his first wife </br>  LIVE I TELL YOU<br><br>LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF HANA</br></br>  This thread is lacking Hana expressions.   karate <br>of course it had to be the dane cook of martial arts</br>    <br> Claims GF status <br> Takes his first time <br> Forces to take responsibility <br> First divorce as well <br><br>Chiyo - A man who takes responsibility can't possibly be evil!<br><br>The end</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone fucking forgets that the only reason Kiyoshi is still in school is because of Chiyo that threatened to quit too.  <br>If you aren't that bothered now you might as well wait until the BDs and try watching again.</br>  <br>He stayed because of her breasts.</br>  <br>I forget most of the details about the story.</br>  <br>I really don't remember almost everything.</br>  Reminder that Hana lusts for Kiyoshi's D on a daily basis  <br>Well he also grew the resolve to stay because he had goals like the wet-tshirt contest.</br>  <br>medusa cant come soon enough</br>  <br>I'm half tempted to get that 1/7th scale figure of Hana to make her pose with dat medusa</br>   yfw Prison School becomes the SAO of this season <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oIS<wbr>iuPK3l04</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Why do people always run to SAO as the first comparison?<br><br>SAO is by no means a decent example of literature, 2 years of semen glopping endlessly into mainstream popularity is all it has going for it.</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to know, was the 2 years line really in the ln?</br>  <br>why are they talking so much in the first few seconds with nothing happening? is that how people watch anime?</br>  <br> 1/7th Hana figure with medusa pussy <br><br>I'd buy the shit out of it</br></br></br>  <br>It's been out since december, it just cost like $160+, i might buy one early august off amazon. Even comes with a bottle prop and some other stuff</br>  <br><br>That was hilarious, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, it's true! This is the single greatest fucking thing ever!</br>  <br>they are on jcafe</br>  <br>mmh, it ain't that bad, you just need to get through the beginning of the new arc, it gets better again after a couple chapters. I mean that moment got me bored too, but really, it gets better after a while !</br>  <br> Medusa shit there. <br>Yeah way to ruin it.</br></br>  <br>it certainly is but 160$ is a bit too much for me. <br>Now I wonder why burglars in japan even bother assaulting banks and jewelry shops when they could make millions just by robbing random otakus rooms</br></br>  <br> nearly all of them are niggers. <br><br>also ? what's the point of filming yourself while watching an anime, I mean are there actually people watching those kind of videos ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I did it was pretty funny since you can emphatize with the reactions of other people.<br><br>Of course the first sitting is alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>good to know that you are a filthy fucking secondary lelouch you piece of shit</br></br>   kissing before marriage <br>slut</br>  <br>Yeah, why would I lie to you? There's also figures of the vice president as well. One is like huuuge and one is oddly proportioned. I'm just gonna order the Hana figure though. Maybe put some aside for a potential new figure release due to the anime.</br>  <br>I hope you are wearing your purity ring anon.</br>  <br> Do NOT sexualize the Hana. <br>hanakana was an inspired choice to voice hana. <br><br>she'd giving me a permaboner with her gangsta voice combo'ed with her genki voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AROUND HIS DICK!</br>  Well /a/, what is your...Choice?!  Reminder that if you don't think Mari has something for Kiyoshi you're in denial  <br>More like anyone who thinks Mari has something for Kiyoshi is delusional.</br>  When will get Jo's arc where he conquers many young female hearts? He's the token harem protag of this series.  <br>The time of troubles is not yet upon us.</br>  <br>More like, if you don't think mari and a vlad-style impalement are a match made in heaven you're delusional.</br>  Kiyoshi wants to do things with girls &amp; Hana wants to do things with him. When is Kiyoshi gonna realize this?  <br>when hana starts wanting to do with him the things he wants to do with girls and not whatever her confusion invents as pee-revenge.</br>  This hana shit has dragged on long enough, why doesn't she just tell him to fuck her brains out?  The adaptation is shit so far  <br>hopefully the bd's aren't shit</br>  <br>for the same reason shingo thought putting a bottle on his dick as kiyoshi suggested was a legitimately good idea and a non-psycho like anzu would go for it, or why shingo and joe blew it with anzu and cake recently. mangaka has characters act stupider than usually to avoid making relationships</br>  <br>I think it's great.</br>  <br>But I thought illicit relationships were banned. Also, how bad would it look if a student council member &amp; prisoner were dating?</br>  <br>They arent banned unless the USC is in power. Which is why the boys helping them is a double edged sword.</br>  <br>I don't suggest they'd date in public. But announcing their interest for one another and trying to date in secret, or even off school -since not in prison anymore- would have worked for anzu/shingo. Similarly, for kiyoshi/hana, being honest with each other and then trying to hide they're dating-shenanigans ought to be the way to go, not this stupid back and forth.</br>  <br> double edged sword <br>dumb. <br>the word you're looking for is dumb. they could have asked kate to make a wet-t-shirt contest in exchange for helping her crush mari, she'd oblige happily</br></br></br>  <br>shit or not its still aoty material</br>  <br><br> The boys are dumb <br><br>Shocker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they showed they can be pretty smart at the end of the first arc though, they shouldn't turn back to being idiots whenever the plot demands it, it feels cheap.</br>  <br>Unless Kate's side has a Chiyo no one is going to be asking her for shit.</br>  <br>Sorry that was meant for:</br>  <br>the boys =/= kiyoshi. the rest didn't give a shit about the usc and mari until kiyoshi pointed out kate didn't plan for wet-t-shirt contest. at that point, it'd make more sense to ask kate for one, than help mari.</br>  <br>They are only smart when they working towards a goal with Gakuto being the providing the true brains behind everything. I have yet to see Gakuto really move on his own. He really only moves into action, because of Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi only moves forward, because of Chiyo who fucks him over as well as aid him at the same time.</br>  <br>They can't. They can't let it be known that easily to the world that they are a bunch of perverts. They all want girlfriends, after all. They don't want to be hated. Can you imagine the chaos and destruction that would come crashing down on their asses if the girls found out WHY they are having a wet t-shirt contest? Oh, the humanity!<br>Not to mention the fact that kate obviously does not aprove of the contest (hence its disapearance from the calendar). What if she simply did not comply AND put them in jail for making such a resquest? Think of the risks and consequences!<br>Also: the courage necessary to make such request! The path they took is the only real option.</br></br></br>  <br>Working with Kate would mean being against Chiyo. Not gonna happen.</br>  <br>Good response. It takes into account that these characters are human. The other anon can't seem to grasp that small detail.</br>  <br>Not to burst your bubble, but the world (=the school) knows why they went to prison in the first arc. Everyone thinks of them as creepy perverts already, that boat has sailed.<br><br><br>I was referring to the rest of the 5, not kiyoshi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didnt disappear anything from the calender. They have a completely different event which is clamming. Knowing this manga the wet-tshirt contest is either a lie or completely different from what the boys expect and the clamming is actually what you think is because kate is a huge fucking dyke and would be the one to do that.</br>  <br>So? They are trying to start anew &amp; meet some girls this time. Don't want to tarnish their rep even more than it already is.</br>  FUCK HANA SHE'S A SHIT<br><br>A SHIT<br><br><br>KATE A BEST</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're grasping at straws mate, the boys being viewed as non-perverts is impossible. besides, a girl who would consider being a pervert a bad thing would be a poor fit for them anyway.</br>  <br> you probably enjoy the same shows as these freaks <br> you probably have the same waifu as them <br> you probably have jerked off to their favorite hentai manga </br></br></br>  <br>It's good for the comedic scenes anyway.<br> but muh pantyshots <br>kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>When did this happen?</br>  <br>I want her to be raped by a black man</br>  <br>When they go to Kiyoshi's room to do ouroboros and Hana starts off by making a show of being as casual as possible</br>  <br> stalker <br> best <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I don't remember that at all.</br>  <br>JUST<br>CUCK</br></br>  why are chapters 168-175 missing from batato  <br>Its when you get to see a more honest part of her and she keeps forgetting her whole revenge stuff because you know by now what she really wants.</br>  <br><br> hur dur what's tyranny </br></br>    <br>Just because they are doesn't mean they aren't trying. For example the I &lt;3 WT tee shirts. Why not just spell it out rather than put WT? Because they hiding it! There's a good reason they aren't running down the ball proclaiming it down the halls of the school. C'mon man.</br>  <br>The irony is that you are using a Naruto pic.</br>  <br>Why? I assume getting raped by anyone is just as bad, regardless. I have never heard anyone go: If I get raped I really hope it's by an Asian dude.'</br>  <br>Probably because that's what would be the most degrading.</br>  <br>Has anyone made a 120sec webm summary of episode 2 yet?</br>  <br>Fuck, I didn't mean to quote!</br>  <br>It's just as bad, regardless.</br>  <br>I didn't know it was Naruto, how do you know it's from Naruto? do you watch Naruto? Fuck off.</br>  <br>That whole segment before the Ouroboros was sorta endearing, seeing the characters act like a new couple without noticing it</br>  <br> trying this hard to fit in after making a mistake <br>Don't piss yourself dude.</br></br>  Rapists usually aren't sexualized.  <br> It was a gateway into getting her to kiss his ass <br>No, it was characterization to show that her dislike of boys stems from her conflict with her father, and that she can deny it all she wants but she shares her father's preference for nice asses.</br></br>  I never got into this because I couldn't get past the MC being a super perverted cunt and all his friends or whatever you wanna call them are masochistic as fuck<br>Is this shit worth re-picking up the manga?</br>  <br>Try again once your balls have dropped.</br>  <br>I just want to see S girls fucked by the big nigger cock, what's the matter?<br>Same thing goes for Meiko.</br></br>  <br>This 'shit' is worth picking up for the reactions alone.</br>  <br>I don't see why you say that. It just wasn't interesting past the typical anime 'muh sexi skool gurl!'</br>  <br>Then go back to your Gary Stu action shit that's meant for 12 year old boys.</br>  <br>Are you that anon that's obsessed with the girls getting raped?</br>  <br><br> ¥11,800 <br> Somehow equating to $160+ <br>Come on guys all it takes is a simple search. Even with EMS it would never cost 160+ don't be retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only S girls. And by black cocks.</br>  <br><br>Nice blog.</br></br>  <br>Then go write some fan fiction or hire an artist for a commission to get your rocks off. You are not contributing to the discussion.</br>  <br>Jokes are so much better due to delivery and timing.</br>  <br> hire an artist for a commission to get your rocks off. <br>That would be a great idea, I guess I'll get in touch with Andou Hiroyuki to draw a doujinshi about that.<br>Thanks anon, you truly inspire me to do great things.</br></br></br>  <br> almost 100$ without shipping <br>it's still too much</br></br>  <br> I want to believe that Chiyo's character is going to turn around at some point <br>I feel like she'll become the president of the 3rd Student Council, which will also include some of the boys, and then go full tyrant mode when she finds out about all the lies. Mari, Kate, Kiyoshi, Hana, and maybe some of the others  Andre and Risa?  will end up in prison,  as will the Assman,  and we'll get a flashback to whatever turned Mari into a psycho misandrist as the cast tries to recover Chiyo from the dark side.<br><br>I'd be happy to oblige,</br></br></br></br>  Where else can I go read th manga without worrying about any chapters getting deleted like at batoto?  <br>I used mangafox mostly, the majority of the chapters there are Utopia</br>  <br>This is perhaps the least harem series of all time<br><br>It took like 80 chapters for the girls to treat Kiyoshi as anything less than scum</br></br></br>  He started in on Sumo with nothing but lies. DAMN DIRTY LIES.<br><br>He saw Hana peeing and it mindbroke her.<br><br>Mari is the only fine bitch that knows what a scoundrel he is but can't deny that she wants to go and take a bite of his manly ass.<br><br>Kiyoshi is sort of the prettyboy of the prison schools, though, so it makes sense bitches love Kiyoshi. It takes a refined lady to like Andre WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> not your generic Harem trash  <br><br> It took like 80 chapters for the girls to treat Kiyoshi as anything less than scum <br>it sure does takes a while to redeem yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>its funny no one mentions his face</br></br>  <br><br>Given she's gay, being raped by a dude in general would be pretty nasty.</br></br>  <br>SAO was originally a fucking phone novel written by a teenager. I am completely serious. Chapter 16.5 is the smut chapter that was removed from the official LN print after some publisher picked the author up because SAO was popular.<br> Two years of semen made a gushing sound as it flowed endlessly into Asuna <br>Is totally a fucking quote from 16.5, it might be something other than "gushing" but I'm certain I remembered the rest of it.</br></br></br>  <br>are you offended by smut and porn?</br>  <br> forgetting THE GLOP <br><br>/a/non... I'm dissapointed.</br></br></br>  <br>No I love smut. I just enjoy the fact that SAO was literally written by a highschooler. It shuts people down hard when they defend it. Prose is kind of important in smut but 16.5 is just too funny. It's exactly why that line is made of.</br>  <br>I FUCKING KNEW IT. I remembered that it was a g sound but glop just didn't come to mind because come the fuck on.</br>  Two liters of ragu sauce made a moist squishing noise as it splattered irregularly into the lasagna platter.  <br> ragu <br> not using the based Prego brand as a base for further enhancements <br><br>I just don't know about some people</br></br></br></br>   Hana is my waifu   <br>It's the amount and just what kind of porn.<br>Fucking speedreaders not knowing the chairman also had "peeping girls changing and bath room" on his computer.</br></br>  <br>You are fucking retarded kill yourself</br>  i feel like chiyo would go together well with gakuto. their chemistry just clicks  Reminder: Only Chiyo had made Kiyoshi Happy on the entire manga  <br> Mari is the only fine bitch that knows what a scoundrel he is  <br>actually hana is the only one who knows everything about kiyoshi</br></br>  <br>Chiyo is Kiyoshi Good End, the perfect good girlfriend candidate, but Hana is his True End, as perverted as him and also as innocent in all of this, Mari is his Bad End who will fuck him over for her own convenience like she already did with Kate.</br>  <br> I never got into this because I couldn't get past the MC being a super perverted cunt and all his friends or whatever you wanna call them are masochistic as fuck <br> Is this shit worth re-picking up the manga? <br>stop right there. <br><br>unless you're a landwhale or castrated by one, or under the age of 12 you should be finding this show hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  The Mari a slut arc lasted waaay too long  <br><br>I remember when first reading through this and thought Chiyo was purposely setting up the boys to get their time in prison expanded with the photo she made with Kiyoshi seeing Mari and the Chairman received it simultaneously.</br></br>  <br><br>faggot</br></br>    The prez is too hot, I'm sorry Hana  <br>Carpet munchers just aren't attractive at all.</br>  <br><br>shit taste tbh</br></br>  <br>He stole the jacket from/ sumo girl</br>    <br>Mari thinks he's a scoundrel, b/c he's a man. Hana knows he's a scoundrel, but also knows his good points too. Chiyo just sees his good points.</br>  Oh Gawd save me  <br> Chiyo just sees his good points <br><br>More like what she wants to see as good points he doesnt really have.</br></br></br>  Best page  WHY AM I WATCHING THIS?????<br><br>The animation looks like shit. But I just can't stop watching every episode every week.<br><br>I want to drop Denpa Kyoushi, but I just can't. <br><br>This animation is the worst thing ever. I expect Working!! levels of quality and yet I got a piece of crap that looks like it was drawn on Microsoft Paint.<br><br>And yet I just can't stop watching it!<br><br>Help me, /a/!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Manga shit the bed long time ago. I don't know why you watch the anime.<br><br>You probably liked Negima! too.</br></br>  <br>Just accept the fact that you have  found a character you can relate to, like I did. </br>   Hell Gates, son of the owner of Macrosoft <br> King Halo 3, made by Activision Frigate <br><br>It's like they're trying to get sued by as many people as possible</br></br></br>  <br>at least read the manga save your time</br>  <br><br>I hated all the Negima adaptations.<br><br>I actually hated Negima myself. But for some reason, I just can't drop this anime.</br></br></br></br>  She should be the only reason to watch this  It's a blatant ripoff of a successful formula. That formula is just addictive to watch.  <br> implying the trap isn't best character </br>  <br><br>Trap is the only reason to watch this show</br></br>  <br> Working!! levels of quality <br>people consider the production values of Working!! to be good quality?</br></br>  <br> Why watch the anime <br>Why so you think people watch anime in the first place? Because it's fucking animated.</br></br>  <br> my little anon can't be this new </br>  <br>If Age can get get away with this I don't see why not.</br>  <br><br> Not liking Working!! animation </br></br>  <br>I'm going to assume you were trying not to win the retard of the week contest and explain to you that I was talking about this shitty anime, not anime in general. <br><br>How you somehow came to that conclusion I have no idea, but seek Jesus.</br></br></br>  <br> This animation is the worst thing ever. <br>It's funny how some people can trick themselves into imagining things like this.</br></br>  <br>I said the same when i reached chapter 120 of the manga.</br>  <br>There are that many chapters?<br><br>Jesus christ. If this somehow gets a second season I will kill myself.</br></br></br>  <br>134 chapters, the manga is bad, but we are about to start the horrible tier now that we have a actual forced drama arc.</br>   not watching this to get lectured <br><br>I thought /a/ was full of advanced chinese cartoon watchers. I guess you guys can not meet my expectations.</br></br>  <br>DO YOU KNO WUT YD IS!?!?!?</br>  <br> hating on AOTS for 2 seasons running </br>  <br> And yet I just can't stop watching it! <br> Help me, /a/! <br>Consider suicide.</br></br></br>  <br>YUKATA DE DEITO?</br>  What the fuck were they thinking with that voice they went with for the sister  <br>Not much at all.<br>Considering how much they got their dicks sucked, to let her land the role.</br></br>  <br>Do you know how anime is made? Have you ever contributed to creating one? You have no right to criticize them when you are as bad as them.</br>  <br>YAKINIKU DAISUKI?</br>  <br>CHIGAU!!</br>  <br>Anon, it's more than just the awful animation. The highly formulaic, wish fulfillment progression and nonsensical events are also black marks on the show. I'm still watching it, but mostly to hear the sister's voice.<br><br>Christ, like the MMO arc from last season? One of the worst things conceived ever.<br><br><br><br>Bullshit. Traps are usually fine, but that backstory and development was the worst.<br><br><br>I think it's called hyperbole. Secondly, it is really bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her first role and IIRC the director picked her specifically. I quite like her voice, it's something different for once.</br>  <br> Bullshit. Traps are usually fine, but that backstory and development was the worst. <br>With a show like this I'll take what I can get.</br></br>  <br>Well said. I'm glad you're now an expert on how anime are made. The "I watched Shirobako" course you did really shows.<br>After all you've contributed to creating one right, like supporting the LWA kickstarter?<br>A true anime supporter like yourself who defends those who criticize the studio, deserves nothing less than a medal. Please preach your intellectualism about the anime industry to us some more, we all need it. Because after all, you saw Shirobako and have every right to defend those who are criticized. All hail anon-kun, defender of the overworked and underpayed anime staff!</br></br></br>  <br>All the writing in this show is shit, the trap is best character just by virtue of being a cute<br><br>Although honestly the way they resolved his/her arc was pretty fucking horrible. The dude just outed a tranny against its will in front of a fuckton of people. Trannies get literally murdered in real life because people find out about them, so I see no way that can ever be a good idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the director should leave picking VAs to someone else then because they're pretty terrible at it.</br>  <br>Don't pull that shit.<br>There's no excuse for this shit.</br></br>  <br>Not much at all really.<br>Why think when you get your dick sucked every other day.<br>There's a reason her voice sounds so shit after all, but that what needs to be done to land your first role.</br></br></br>  <br>It might not have been the director, I read about it near when the series started so my memory could definitely be wrong</br>  This may just be the biggest Denpa Kyoushi thread we've ever had.<br>I'm proud of you all.</br>  3 episodes in so far. Does he do the cringey snap "lesson start" thing every episode? I hope not..  <br>It stops in the second cour, but the dank OP and ED are replaced to so it doesn't feel any better</br>  So this show is just GTO except with an otaku instead of a gangster, right.  <br>There were a few decent sized ones after the first few episodes. Honestly I'm surprised 22ish of us are still watching this.</br>  <br>Shut up dumb bitch.</br>  <br>My uncle works for KyoAni and he told me its shit too</br>  <br>Kind of</br>  Dropped after 4th episode.  Pretty sure the only reason any Nips still watch this show is because it airs right before Conan.  I can't stop watching it either, anon.I just can't.The show is an enigma.<br> I hope it keeps its formula forever. </br>  I dropped it at ep 1, how the fuck any anyone still watching this?  <br>This show is my punishment for having a no drop rule</br>  <br>Pretty much this.</br>  <br> ????? <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  i watch this on purpose  My prince.  <br>Same with rhinos.</br>    Dat ass.  <br>Where do you think you are?</br>  <br>Elam is not pleased with it.</br>  that FACE  Is Miria dumb or just doesn't afraid of anything?  <br>She's too ignorant to be afraid.<br><br>It's her most endearing quality.</br></br></br>  <br>Pure hearted</br>  <br> when they see your dick </br>    Triad Primus.  So will Producer be put with the new groups or will he manage the left overs?  <br>They're restructuring and there's like 30 producers and 180 idols.<br><br>He'll probably get to be in charge of 2 or 3 smaller groups of 2-4 members.</br></br></br>  <br>Producer is wasted on talent management.<br><br>He should be in the army, or an intelligence service, or a Yakuza.</br></br></br>  The best.  <br>Her Elvis/Ziggy Stardust combo is kind of strange.<br><br>At least she's not a poser.</br></br></br>  what a dyke    <br>She is not my favorite, but still - good taste, anon.</br>  <br>She's just hardcore.</br>    It was a pretty good episode.<br>I hope the ending means we are getting some more sensible units too.<br>And new outfits.

ML anime confirmed.  <br>Fuck everything</br>  <br>Hey. Mirai is a QT3.14 So that's something to look forward to.<br><br>I look forward to the hypersonic shitposting though.<br><br> ML is better than CG hurr <br> No u CG is better than ML <br> Fuck A-1 <br> Fuck all of you. Scamco is replacing 765 <br> Side-M anime when </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Anime better have Emily in it or it's automatically shit</br>  <br>Look on yaraon.</br>  <br>Will she like her first name by then?</br>  <br>Not going to lie, I will do all of these.<br><br>ML anime is going to be better than CG's anime anyway. Scamco isn't going to let their favourite child go to shit like CG.</br></br></br>  <br> ML anime is going to be better than CG's anime anyway <br><br>Pfthahahaha. They sure did the MLs justice in the movie amirite? <br><br>I look forward to the 765 purists being buttmad about the ML anime when Haruka and the original gang appear for all but 30 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  Unrelated to CG but I just want to say.<br><br>I love Makoto.</br></br>  So TakeP appeared on the second day of the 10th live.  <br> Side-M anime when <br><br>So WHEN is it?</br></br></br>  <br>I love saturated tumblr gifs</br>  <br><br>She is so perfect.</br></br>  <br>http://yaraon.blog109.fc2.com/<br><br>I'm looking but I'm not seeing.</br></br></br>  <br> I look forward to the 765 purists being buttmad about the ML anime when Haruka and the original gang appear for all but 30 seconds. <br>That's going to be funny.<br><br>But I have a feeling A-1 will get third time lucky.

The anime adapts a setting of the CG-verse that can do justice to details in the mobage and keeps things fresh. The anime differentiated CG to the point that it's no longer a clone of 765 except with different idols through a more corporate setting.<br><br>You're just bitter than your favorite CG isn't in it / isn't getting enough spotlight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're just bitter than your favorite CG isn't in it / isn't getting enough spotlight. <br>Fuck, you got me.</br></br>  Now that Million Live anime is confirmed can we agree that CG was shit?

Human sexuality has certain "Markers" that set off an erogenous response. The markers for femininity and the markers for masculinity.<br>If you are attracted to the feminine markers, you are either a straight male of a lesbian woman. If you are attracted to the male markers, you are either a gay male or a straight woman. I'll just cover the feminine markers because thats what pertains.<br>Wide hips, at least as wide as the shoulders. Slender and supple musculature. Youthful feminine facial structure. In most cases, breasts, but this is possibly the most widely varying marker between perfectly normal and functioning adults. Usually, people want at least budding breasts. Notice how the standard 2d loli and the standard 2d trap fill most if not all of these markers, hence why some people complain that some trap artists just draw "Girls with a penis". I doubt most lolicons could get off to actually realistically drawn pudgy awful children just like I doubt most 2D trap lovers would get off on a realistically drawn trap.</br></br></br></br>  I bet this is the same who claimed the Prism Ilya specials are encouraging rape.  <br>Ain't rape till it happens, get your thought crime garbage out of here.</br>  <br><br>Why did you just waste a couple minutes of your life writing about something entirely unrelated to the whole topic?<br><br>People talk about fucking lolis in /l/ threads all the time, and this leads to these threads housing actual child rapists.<br><br>That's the topic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Alright /a/, let's discuss this.<br><br>Is Rory Mercury a Yamada or a Yomi?</br></br>  <br>Yamada has a nice body.<br>The nicest.</br></br>  Kuroneko  <br> Kuroneko <br><br>She's a Yamada</br></br></br>  Gosurori  うわわ<br>Happy birthday Retard Master</br>      Pagan black magick.

Oh well.</br></br>    Theory time.<br>Isn't it suspicious that we haven't seen any sort of power or ability in Shinohayu? There hasn't even been any allusions to special powers at all. <br>The only person we know who MAY have any sort of power is Sukoyan (38).<br>Also take into account that Shinohayu subtitle is Dawn of (an) Age. When you think about we still don't have any idea what this new age even is.<br>So I think that during Shinohayu will we some sort of event or trigger that creates mahjong abilities. Perhaps to do with Sukoyan or maybe even goldfish.<br>Now if you combine that with the theory that Shino and Kanna are running the interhigh this year and set the rules that would (as Fujita pro said I think) "lure out the weirdos" in order to study them or something I think it's an entirely possible theory.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> Sukoyan (38) </br></br>  <br>Bear in mind that Ritz once said that Hayarin is among the smartest people in the series. Her idol personality is just a convenient mask to fool the public. She's actually a mad scientist and furthers her megalomaniacal plan to dominate the entirety of Japan's mahjong parlours with radioactive super mahjong girls. Super abilities have now reached a critical density, so she enlisted her old friends Kanna Ishitobi and Shino Richardson to help her with the tournament.</br>  <br><br> Her idol personality is just a convenient mask to fool the public </br></br>  <br> everyone who has a power has one thing in common <br> they all at one point listened to a song by Hayarin <br> that was the trigger </br></br></br>  <br>Kanna's cool and cynical personality is jsut a convenient mask to fool the public.

Three final bosses remain: Zenno, Akado, and Mihirogi. <br>Who will we see next?</br>  <br>Mihirogi beat Hayari the previous year, so Shino will probably beat Mihirogi in the finals.</br>  <br>no, the first numbers in  are the current points, the second numbers the gains or losses compared to the start of the round (i.e., the points from the vice captain round form ).<br>So we have<br><br>Rinkai: 170300 - 1000 = 169300<br>Himematsu: 111300 - 7000 = 104300<br>Kyosumi: 88100 - 12000 = 76100<br>Usuzan: 30300 + 20000 = 50300<br><br><br>the second numbers</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose that Kokoro and Shino will advance together, and I hope to see Zenno too since we already know the other two aces.<br><br> Akado and Mihirogi in the other semifinal <br>poor Akado.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The way it's looking now, Shino &gt; Mihirogi &gt; Hayari<br>So, probably<br>Shino &gt; Sukoyan &gt; Mihirogi &gt; Hayari &gt; Risa &gt; Akado<br>That's why Akado is a coach. And Shino is either the President of World Mahjong or dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Zenno starts having Shino flashbacks in the Saki team semi and advises Kyouko to follow the tanoshii.</br>  <br>Subs never. Calling it now.</br>  <br>Underwater would never abandon one of their flag franchises.</br>  <br>I meant that Akado prepares herself by studying the other players, but Wakannee is very difficult to read.<br><br><br>I also want to see Teru's reaction and comments from Saki's teammates and friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No bully.</br>  <br>I don't like the look of this. It screams "Himematsu trades places with Kiyosumi". Kyouko! Slay those demons!</br>  soon  <br>Can't bully the dead.</br>      <br>Shinohayu is the cover of Big Gangan next week.<br>Tanoshii is returning to dominance.</br></br>  Are back from the toki?  <br>Don't forget that Hayari is also announcing this match on TV.<br>At some point soon, you'd expect Shino crossover flashbacks.</br></br>  <br>Let's see if we make it to 200 posts.</br>  <br>You can't bring back the dead, so no</br>  <br>Even so, I will never stop trying.</br>  real mahjong  Aislinn is about to find out why life is hard sometimes.  I wonder who from these maids would be the most inept.  <br><br>Toki because you can't employ a corpse.</br></br>  <br><br>But what if I use her between my thighs?</br></br>  How is Fubuki related to the Miyanaga family?  <br><br>They both enjoy killing hapless blonde girls.</br></br>  <br>Is that fucking Washizu?</br>  <br>It's supposed to be, but it it really reminds me of something else</br>  Reminder, that in Kindai Mahjong a new manga about a mahjong-playing cute girl has started this month. Name is カナ−丹花の闘牌−, is written by Itou Makoto, a veteran of mahjong series, and drawn by Ashika Nozomu, who has a history of short shoujo series and some gay doujins.  <br>Ritz's last editor ended in arkham asylum</br>  <br>But I want the rare life sized Sakisan model</br>  did shitrue get destroyed by Grandmaster yet?  <br>I want that Suicca card.</br>  <br>How gay are the girls?</br>  <br> Pink Table <br> Short haired Washizu <br><br>I liked the post-Ten intro they did, although Ohgi would be what, close to 80 by then?  And he seemed to be missing an arm but they didn't explicitly show it or mention it, but fuck, that could be a huge spoiler. </br></br></br></br>  <br> If Ohgi were missing an arm, that would mean that Washizu won (Unless he lost it in an unrelated bet elsewhere). Which would mean that Akagi died. Which would mean no Ten. So nah. </br>  <br>He also had his hand in his pant's pocket in the very first shot of the Washizu match, so I'm guessing it's just a nasty red herring.</br>  <br>Dunno, didn't see the raws yet, only a few spoiler pics. Anything from Kinma that's not Akagi isn't really popular.</br>  <br>I know that he's supposed to have his assets ready to go at that point but that place looks like a rich person living room instead of a eccentric psychopath kill room.</br>  <br><br>That will not be tolerated.<br><br>They're going down.</br></br></br></br>  <br> trying to rip off saki  <br>Disgusting. <br>If you're going to do that you have to be sneaky about it like Girls und Panzer.</br></br></br>  <br>But will it be translations never like ping pong tanoshii?  ;_; </br>  <br>It may be related to an old series made by the author, Usagi - Yasei no Touhai, so it's not really a rip off.</br>  <br>And most likely raws never, like the other collaboration mahjong series these two are doing together</br>  <br><br>Unless...time travel was involved.</br></br>  <br>So much tanoshii that we'll never experience. Isn't it sad?</br>  <br><br>tanoshii things are tanoshii.</br></br>  Saved from going Toki.  <br><br>Ooops, wrong image.</br></br>  <br>Is Mihirogi going to be the final boss of the Elementary school arc?</br>  <br><br>That's crazy anon, but possibly, I don't know, maybe, it could be, or perchance she's in Middle School.</br></br>  <br>This is better. I cannot tolerate Ritz being a fucking hack. I hope this gets the love it deserves.</br>  <br>We made it.<br>Yay.</br></br>  <br>I've read a bit of Usagi and it's not that good.</br>  I don't think anyone could do girls mahjong better than Ritz. Saki isn't popular because of just the mahjong its more because Ritz is a genius of character design. <br>A darker version of saki could be popular though.</br>  <br>A little competition for Ritz can be a good thing.</br>  <br> A darker version of saki could be popular though. </br>  <br>But with little girls.</br>  <br>The genius of the Saki series was to remove mahjong from the criminal and gambling elements that it is normally associated with in Japan.<br>Doing a dark mahjong series is easy. Doing a tanoshii mahjong series is hard.</br></br>  <br>Add on one more attribute. Once you learn the mahjong, you actually understand the character's feelings when they play as you yourself play. So much tanoshii~~</br>  <br>And the series is being released so slowly, that even gaijins living thousands of miles away have plenty of time to learn the mahjong.<br>Brilliant.</br></br>  <br>But I thought Riichi mahjong is the most popular board game in japan.</br>  <br>There's plenty of time for Saki to get darker.</br>  <br><br>We need more Saki/Strike Witches crossovers. One doesn't have any panties, other shows them pretty much all the time.</br></br>  <br><br>You know you can delete posts, right?</br></br>  <br>Saki is a lot like Yoshika.</br>  <br>Shiromi = Sanya</br>  Flying Monkey  <br><br>They're so much alike, it's like Saki's grandmother in sakiverse is their version of Yoshika.</br></br>  I wonder which witch is like Subara~  <br>Saki only has one horn; Yoshika has two.<br>The Neuroi probably knocked a horn out of the gene pool.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah, they just split them evenly among the sisters.</br></br>  Lynne must be Nodoka.  <br>Satoha = Mio</br>  <br><br>The pink hair must be a glitch in the matrix. Nodoka should have been light brownish blonde.</br></br>  <br><br>Mio has the Wahaha laugh, though.</br></br>  <br>Trude = Kurumi<br>Erica = Hiroe</br></br>  Lucchini = Hajime or Hatsumi  <br>Maybe Mio = Hisa and Perrine = Mihoko</br>  The code is getting cracked.  <br>But Minna is the red-haired buchou.</br>  When Saki gets to the World Mahjong tournament, it will probably be a lot like Strike Witches.<br>Or instead of waiting 15 years, you could just rewatch Strike Witches now.</br>  Ryuuka &amp; Toki?<br>or Himeko &amp; Mairu?</br>  <br>Himeko &amp; Mairu because you don't know who should be the man.</br>  <br><br>Why not a blend of both, then? Toki and Eila both have future vision powers. It all makes sense.</br></br>    <br>yes. <br><br>http://www.bs-sptv.com/zawazawa/<br> zawazawa </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You can see her getting wet just by the look on her face.</br></br>  <br>He looks like a dirty hobo.</br>  Is Saki more popular or successful than Strike Witches?  <br>And Akagi looks like a lanky prettyboy instead of some dude that can solo beat up groups of hardened factory workers.</br>  I'm off to hunt for the elusive bird. See you next thread, tanoshiis.  <br>Good hunting.</br>  Fuck achiga monkey and kuro breaks the PSP achiga game.  <br>Is this what real life tanoshii looks like?</br>  <br>No, real life tanoshii isn't nearly as hardcore.</br>  Are we already dead? Time for nudes (sorry for the quality).  Don't bother helping me up.  <br>I mean it. Just gonna lie here for some weeks, I'm perfectly fine.</br>  <br>Understandable, lying on the floor when it's so hot outside is pretty nice.</br>  <br>That is not how a miko is supposed to dress!</br>  <br>Is this better?</br>  <br>Are we experiencing a cotton shortage? I think it's a bit lewd, to be honest.</br>  <br>Traditional miko outfits are considered to expensive with the increased volume of the gods. Changes have to be made to raise their cost-effectiveness.</br>  Hethens, all of you!  <br>Now that's a religion I can get behind.</br>  <br> talking shit when there's an actual heathen in her team </br>  <br>As long as there's love, it doesn't matter if she's a heathen.</br>  <br>That is true. In the troubled times we're living in, only love can save us.</br>    <br>Damn, you tricked me.</br>  <br>Pagans are easy to convert, so it should be fine.<br><br>At least they don't have to deal with heretics.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And then you learn the true story. Saki is a Yakuza killer, and is planning to slaughter everyone at the finals.</br></br>  Post anything JJBA!  <br><br><br> this much bait <br>Go to bed Pesci.</br></br></br></br>  why must their always be hackers on a leaderboard i was all excited to get number 1 spot until three fucken niggers decided to hack and stole it from me  <br><br>You can download them pre-patched here - http://moriyashrine.weebly.com/.</br></br>  <br>My nigga</br>  I don't know jap.<br>How do I navigate the online menu in the demo?

She's cool and cute. I used my food stamps to buy goga gola and potatoe chip and stayed up all night watching anime!<br><br>I feel inspired!</br></br></br>  <br>Youth in Asia.<br><br>Get it?</br></br></br>  Shhhh daijoubu is sleeping.  <br>Crazy awesome.
