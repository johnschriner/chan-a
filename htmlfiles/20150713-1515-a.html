Dokuro-chan a qt bully</br>  <br>Thanks man.</br>  Has Shark Week been cancelled?  <br>I hope whoever you're there seeing is doing well!</br>  <br>Fuck where is he?</br>  <br>It's because you faggots were bad this weekend.<br>It's like christmas. You cancelled christmas.</br></br>  <br> doom delivered me on Christmas week </br>  <br>Its been on all week. Where the fuck have you been.</br>  If Shark postponed Shark week because of the assholes fucking the threads I would officially suck his dick.  <br>OR here, not Ojii, but I requested it for him, good job man!</br>  EMOTIONLESS MAGURO SEX  Why do people act like Ruri was emotionless?  What would she say if you confessed to her?  <br>Because they don't read Nisekoi and only shitpost.</br>  <br>Nothing. Then she will probably beat you.</br>  <br>  still reading Nisekoi <br>Anon, what the fuck? Why haven't you drop it already?</br></br>  <br> Nothing. Then she will probably beat you off behind a stairwell. <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br> Not enjoying your anger </br>  <br>Accurate enough.</br>  <br>I speedread 30 seconds every week and pray to Komi for a RurixShu chapter.</br>  <br>It sounds like you doesn't like reaction images.</br>  <br>Fair enough<br><br><br>Gintama has better ones</br></br></br></br>  <br> MAGURO <br>This is my fetish.</br></br>  <br>I do it for my girl.</br>  <br>It's not like I'm reading anything by Seo.</br>  <br>marika a shit<br>tsugumi a best</br></br>  Ruri? Emotionless?<br><br>Far from that.</br></br>  <br>Did the short story ever finish being translated? I remember helping out halfway before it was finally abandoned</br>  <br> reverse search <br> 0 results </br></br>  <br>MY DICK</br>  <br>I guess you'll just have to read every Nisekoi doujin on sadpanda until you find it.</br>  Ruri deserves so much better from a shitty Ron com Anime. She got stuck with the worst guy in the show.  <br> Shuu <br> worst <br>He's certainly better than that shitter of an MC then.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember the comments saying that was getting worked on by a group.<br><br>That was a while ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shuu is a total shit disturber. You know he's a total joke along and the show is bad even with a dense MC.</br></br>  <br>I did, no matches.</br>  <br>Even non-english? I dunno if this one is translated.</br>            <br>ATLA is not anime</br>  <br>fuck , it is more anime than kaiji</br>          Uryu doesn't REALLY belong there, he's nothing like the other characters. Least of all a Vegeta clone.  <br>He's a protagonist who went to the dark side just like sasuke</br>  <br><br>he's adgy with muh dark side nature</br></br>  <br> dark hair <br>check<br> edginess <br>check<br> whole family killed <br>check<br> protagonist is best friend and has a charming personalty <br>check</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so Uryu's not rusing the moustache guy he's unironically gone to the nazi's side?<br><br>if so, fucking hell Kubo...where's your self-respect?</br></br></br>  <br> vegeta <br> charming personality <br><br>He's like a child whose been put in eternal time out</br></br></br></br>  Who is the best jojo and why is it joseph?  I like Josuke better, he has very nice hair.<br><br>Definitely best Jojo in both universes.</br></br>  <br>He looks like a gay twat.</br>  <br>What the fuck did you just say?</br>  <br>He looks like a skinny fag boy. Jonathan, Joseph and Jotaro were all big guys.</br>  <br>Josuke is a big guy for his age. I definitely wouldn't rope him in with the twigs that are Giorno and Johnny.</br>  <br>for you</br>  <br>True, but he's still skinny compared to the three I mentioned.</br>  <br>But Joseph is literally the gayest Jojo ever.</br>  Joseph had the most interesting and memorable character, if only because of the harsh duality-contrast between him and Deo.  <br> deo <br>Confirmed for last season only animu babby</br></br>  <br> Who is the best jojo and why I didn't read the manga </br>  <br>I want to watch the anime but have no idea where to start. I've looked online and it seems complicated. Where should I start?<br><br> inb4 start with the manga </br></br></br>  <br>I still like Joseph the most though I'm only in part 7</br>  <br>Jojo 2012 for parts 1 and 2<br>Stardust crusaders for part 3<br>Read the rest</br></br></br>  <br>Johnathan is boring as fuck. Jotaro is pretty cool but is too autistic to be best. Josuke is shit and gets carried by his friends. Giorno plays second fiddle to Buccellati. Joylene fucks up so bad the universe breaks and Johnny spends most of his time getting shot or crying that he can't do it.</br>  <br>Because he squared up to the pillar men in one on one fights without stands. <br><br>Had a sense of humour.<br><br>Didn't become a miserable twat even in old age.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You answered your own question.</br></br>  <br> Joylene fucks up so bad the universe breaks <br>It's Jotaro the one that fucked up big time. Jolyne is actually pretty competent,she's the weakest JoJo stand and had to deal with insanely overpowered stands all the time.</br></br>  <br>Jotaro fucked up the universe. You can actually see the exact panel he ruins it all too. Don't pin this on Jolyne. By that definition Jonathan ruined everything when he didn't properly destroy Dio</br>  <br> ctrl-f  <br> Speedwagon <br> No results. </br></br></br>  <br>Speedwagon isn't a Jojo.<br>He's still the best character in part 1, though.</br></br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Speedweed <br> Not a JoJo </br></br>  <br>He was such a downer in part 2 with most of his lines consisting of how futile any fight was and how Joseph was going to lose.</br>  <br>OOOH POOO</br>  <br>Funny that you would say that, because I have only seen up to Battle Tendency</br>  <br>Giorno is 15 years old....</br>  <br>Josuke is already 6f1 when he's 16<br>Jotaro is a 17 years old 6ft3<br>best Giorno can get is around 5f11</br></br></br>  <br>As someone who still hasn't watched the anime, I have to say its a tossup between Jonathon and Joseph. Jonathon was a supreme gentlemen, big guy and fought amazingly right until the end. Joseph was arrogant as hell, but pretty endearing. He was clever as hell and was still really likeable when he was old as hell.<br> inb4 mangafag <br> inb4 primary </br></br></br>  <br>A someone who only started reading this month, i urge you to read the manga. heres a link<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/jojos<wbr>-bizarre-adventure-part-1-phantom-b<wbr>lood-r5454</wbr></wbr></br></br>  Why was the last fight in Part 5 so shit? The rest of the part was pretty good up until that shit.  Josuke&gt;Joseph&gt;Jolyne&gt;Johnny&gt;Gappy (so far)&gt; Jonathan&gt;Jotaro&gt;Giorno    <br>Josuke is 15 at the beginning of DiU, too.  Cutest JoJo. </br>  Jonathan is most noble Jojo and best husbando material.<br><br>Joseph is  my personal favorite  Jojo and arguably most clever.<br><br>Jotaro gets points for being into marine science.<br><br>Josuke a cute and has one of my favorite abilities.<br><br>Giorno is different enough from the other Jojos that it's pretty refreshing, being more hands-off and almost Joseph-tier in cleverness.<br><br>Jolyne has a good heart and shows a lot of inventiveness with her relatively "weak" seeming Stand.<br><br>Johnny is probably the Jojo with the most determination, and his surprising ruthlessness is intriguing.<br><br> I haven't read Part 8 yet so no opinion on Gappy. <br><br>There, something nice about each Jojo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> josuke over joseph <br>shit list</br></br>  The only correct answer is Johnny.  <br>The difference is that Joseph makes it work.</br>  <br>Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, Joseph best.</br>    how tall is johnny? he seems like a manlet  <br>Remember when Joseph was the best Jojo, then the anime came around and all of a sudden if anyone says they like Joseph they'e animeonly. I feel bad for Josuke fans as that'll happen to them once Part 4 is animated.</br>  <br><br>He was a jockey, so of course he was a manlet.</br></br>    <br><br>All before the pokem-I mean stands happened.</br></br>  <br>Could you at least try not to act like an anime only fag</br>  Rereading Part III. Couldn't help but think about all those DioOmniStandfags.      <br>Is Eisidisi groping his ass?</br>  For me it's Joseph: intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humour.   Jonathan: Best gentleman. <br> Joseph: Rusemaster and best dad. <br> Jotaro: Badass in a funny way, such as the one-liners he pulls off. However, is overshadowed by Joseph and Polnareff. <br> Josuke: Great hair. Cool stand. Also dicks around the most, the little things like conversations with Okuyasu and Koichi leading up to various misdeeds do secure him as my personal favourite. <br> Giorno: Overshadowed by Bucheratti and Mista. However is also cunning and collected. <br> Jolyne: Good character. For having a big cast has enough personality to not feel overshadowed. Stand is also interesting. <br> Johnny: Great character development throughout. Good banter with Gyro and even Diego before he walks the dinosaur. <br> Jo2uke/Josefumi: Cheating nigger (cant make a true judgement until part is completed in 6 years) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So if living beings were affected by nonorganic things during accelerated time, how the fuck did Emporio and all the living beings on Earth survive the Big Crunch, another Big Bang and the emptiness of space?<br>Also:<br> Causing the end of the universe just to see what happens after it <br>Pucci and Dio were batshit insane</br></br></br>  <br>The true answer</br>  <br>It's a reference to a gay porno so I wouldn't be surprised</br>  <br>I guess after a certain point things just started going 2fast for physics and reality to give a fuck about what lives and what doesn't.</br>  <br>This is probably opening Pandora's box and taking things more seriously than they merit, BUT...<br><br>Since the Pillar Men don't need sex, do they still know about it and/or perform it for pleasure? If not, how would this situation come about- would they have studied humans (or even animal) behavior enough to use sex/rape as a form of humiliation and dominance against us (or Joseph as the specific case may be, whatever)? <br><br>Would they use it as a way to make absorbing people more pleasurable? WOULD it even make it more pleasurable?<br><br>DO PILLAR MEN HAVE GENITALIA, THEY MUST, RIGHT? So many questions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, the pillar men were born, so they must have genetalia. I think its only Ultimate Kars who loses them.</br></br>  who's the best scanlation group to download jojo from? I had downloaded the raws for part 1-6 and felt happy about it but afetr looking throught it, I realize what if I want come back and actually read it?  <br>I like Joseph most then Giorno <br>Yeah I know. Shit taste right?</br></br>  <br>Jotaro is my favorite and all I get accused of is having shit taste</br>  <br>Jotaro.</br>  <br>Nah, you do you.<br><br><br><br><br>Now you two, I'm genuinely curious as to why? I'm not trying to bait you, but I notice he's not really popular around these parts. I personally don't mind Jotaro but to me he doesn't really stand out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not helping it when your favorite JoJo has the personality of a fridge</br>  If you want the most objective "good" jojo, it's josuke by far.<br><br>If you want the best jojo its joseph. <br><br>Jonathan is a fucking retard and boring/underdeveloped<br><br>Jotaro destroys the entire universe because MUH DAUGHTER (which he still failed to save) and is autistic/gary stu<br><br>Part 5 translations are shit and bruno is better<br><br>Jolyne is actually pretty good, 2nd best jojo<br><br>Johnny is terrible, probably the worst fucking jojo. Part 7 is the by far the most overrated piece of shit. Nearly every villain is absolute dogshit other than valentine, and its more fight of the week than part 3 despite being the most narrative part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the delinquent type characters, plus he's more laid back but still gives a fuck, doesn't ever act like an idiot and he's actually intelligent despite his power being purely physical strengths.</br>  <br>He just likes beating up things while saying cheesy one liners. I love that shit. It's easier to appreciate him if you don't see him as the main character of Part 3, but just the main JoJo. His personality changes a lot in the parts he's in as well, and it's nice to see. And seeing him beat the pulp out of DIO (I've read all of the parts for the record) was so satisfying, so that's made me a bit biased. I can see why you wouldn't like him, especially coming from Part 2 which has Joseph in it.</br>  <br>His hair a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br>Your taste is awful. Kill yourself.</br>  Jonathan is the best JoJo.  <br>Perfect list<br><br>Although I can't remember any one liners Jotaro said. But the D'arby fight was fucking hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>This and the receipt in the Steely Dan fight are the best</br>  Where can I get colored and translated PDFs of parts 1-4?<br>Are they in the pastebin?</br>  <br>Dio, go home</br>  <br>maybe check before you post?</br>  <br>There were Pillarwomen before Kars and ACDC killed everyone so it's safe to assume they reproduce sexually.</br>  <br><br> Can you remind me how Jotaro fucked up<br>It's been a while since I last read Part 6</br> </br></br>  <br>not that guy, but how do I get into pastebins?<br>and who is the best group to download jojo from?</br></br>  <br> tfw when jotaro was probably bleeding out but this is the best his brain could do with the lack of oxygen. </br>  <br>It was either he beat the shit out of Pucci or Jolyne died, and he chose the latter IIRC.</br>  <br><br><br>I got you bruv<br><br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, it was either he beat the shit out of Pucci and Jolyne died or he saved her and had no chance of killing Pucci, and chose the latter.</br>  <br>thank you</br>  <br>I'd be fine with  my waifu being killed in exchange of Pucci being stopped<br>But this way everyone's dead  and the Ireneverse is full of counterparts since everyone died don't make me start this again </br></br>    <br>Honestly, I have no idea how the Ireneverse works. Or if there's anyone alive in the original universe. Or anything that happened in the last quarter of Part 6.</br>  <br>Me too, but I'm pretty sure it'll never reach that point because they won't make enough money to animate Diamond.<br><br>Pic related was one of my favorite arcs in the series.</br></br></br>  I still think Jonathan is the 'strongest' JoJo even though he's not my favourite. I'm not talking raw power here, but spirit, endurance and the will to overcome all adversity, no matter what it is.  <br>Apparently, everything up to Part 4 happened in the Ireneverse with alt universe characters<br>Basically everyone except Emporio died with Pucci or something like that</br></br>  <br>I'd tie him and Jolyne for 'strongest' JoJo<br>And they both started out as crybabies</br></br>  <br>Plus he would have had the strongest stand. GER doesn't count because it doesn't belong to Giorno</br>  <br>what</br>  <br>Everyone should have survived into Ireneverse. If Emporio is still alive and has his memories, then everyone else would be.</br>  <br>I'd cite my sources but I have no idea<br>Some anon posted a video or an article where Araki confirmed that<br>I don't expect you to believe me without proof but whatever, I'm mobile and too lazy to search</br></br></br>  <br>So the people who died were reincarnated, but the people who survived stayed the same?</br>  <br>Basically.</br>  <br>And to think he gave us such great "wallowing in my teenage angst" lines as <br> If I died no one would mourn me, I'm all alone boo hoo <br><br>He really came far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who else survived, then? Just Emporio or anyone in the world who didn't die during Part 6?</br>  How does heavy weather work?  <br>I thought emporio only survived because his room exists outside of space and time</br>  <br>Anyone who wasn't dead by the time the first reset happened.</br>  <br>Depends on how wet araki is for him</br>  <br><br>Part 1 had a whole lot of flaws, but it had a surprisingly strong gasp of basic story structure. Part of that was actually seeing Jonathan go from whiny but oddly muscular spoiled child to British Kenshiro, which isn't much of an arc but is still more than a lot of the main characters ever got.</br></br>  <br> strongest stand <br> not just a recolored hermit purple <br>Step it up, Johnathan</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>why don't you wrrryd the manga then huh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I checked and found parts 1 and 2 were unfinished, was hoping there was another</br>  <br>The World is Jonathan's stand</br>  <br> implying anything is ever explained clearly in the manga </br>  <br> implying you aren't just impure enough to realize the brilliance of our God Araki's teachings </br>  <br>thats perfect I bet valentine would be "side A-side B"</br>  <br>only part 6 is fully colored+ translated.</br>  <br>I did, that's how I know how MiH works.</br>  <br>Don't take my word for it because in reality<br> it just werks <br>but from what I got, it's supposed to fuck with the ozone layer to filter and modify sunlight (hence the rainbows), which in turn starts fucking with everyone's nervous system because "subliminal messages". People exposed to the light start having snails-related hallucinations, feel like they are turning into snails (and act accordingly), and eventually believe they are actually snails.</br></br></br>  <br>I know we all have boner for time manipulation power but about gravity, worm hole, dark hole, or electrity.<br><br>and ive realized that jolyne's stand is just hermit purple in final form.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Hermit Purple have a physical form? Stone Free is just Hermit Purple without the spirit photos and can do cool shit with Jolyne's body.</br>  <br>thats why I said its final form hermit purple, kinda like echoes or act where he lost an ability but gained a stronger one or something like that?</br>  <br><br>The World is DIO's stand.</br></br>  <br>How the FUCK does heavy weather work?<br><br>I wouldn't even question it if his stand power was to turn people into snails. But that extra level of explanation makes it totally nonsensical.<br><br>Even if we assume that people can be brainwashed into thinking they're snails because of a special wavelength of light hitting their eyes, what about the people that start turning into snails when they touch other snailpeople?<br><br>Did Araki consult Junji Ito when he was writing up heavy weather or some shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe you should read the manga bub</br>  <br>it's because Araki's logic is extremely retarded most of the time</br>  <br>i agree though. not many people enjoy him and i don't get it. even if he's not your favorite, you still have to admit his courage and gentleman nature. he was kind hearted and forgiving. <br><br>he even forgave fucking dio whilst dying.</br></br></br>  <br><br> what about the people that start turning into snails when they touch other snailpeople? <br>They don't, the thing "transforming" people is still the light, and all the touching snails and snail-people is just part of the hallucinations. After Pucci goes blind he can touch the snails without any problem, meaning they don't really do anything or they actually don't exist at all.<br><br><br>I actually finished rereading Part 6 today. Pretty convenient.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so he's permanently lacking in oxygen?</br>  <br>I keep trying to get my friends into jojo, but they keep saying they were kinda bored or they didnt like vampires and I'm like"but it set the foundation for the entire universe and how can you not like vampires" it makes me kinda feel like I have to stop associating myself with them.</br>  <br>you should, honestly. fuck them for not enjoying the beginning of the series. <br><br>jonathan a best</br></br></br>  <br>dont listen to this anon  but to be fair, vampires stop being a thing for most of the series and really you should urge them to give it a chance until they get to part 2. If they don't like part 2 (which isnt the best part imo but has all the elements of bizarre, funny, and scary that we love about jojo meshed into one quick and entertaining enough arc), then they might as well not like the rest of jojo.</br>  <br>chill, man. i'm not trying to actually break up friendships. i just think everyone needs to enjoy part 1. i'm on part 5 and i still have to say jonathan is best.</br>  anybody have that template for like your favorite jojo, favorite villain, etc? I was in the thread for it yesterday but i completely forgot to save it like an idiot.   tfw Jojo's is your favourite manga but you still don't want part 4 animated   <br> not wanting part 4 animated </br>  <br>Come on dude<br><br>You've seen how animeonlys act and I don't want them giving my favourite part a bad name</br></br></br>  <br>or make a meme out of it, and ive seen a couple, terrifying thing.</br>  <br> What the fuck did you say about my hair??!?!? XDDDD </br>  <br> been this stuck-up <br><br>please chill anon, Jojo isn't and never will be yours. make a change.org petition if you'd like though, I'm sure it'll work. I hate the way some people act too but I'd love to have an animated Jojo regardless of the people it would drag into the fanbase.</br></br></br>  <br><br> animeonlys touching best villain </br></br>  <br>Part 4 is already the memeiest (?) one, I don't think things would change too much.</br>  <br>because duwang was so not memed the fuck up right guys?</br>  <br> lel maybe u should wrrrryd the manga </br>  <br> tfw i could be dead before my favorite scene gets animated </br>  <br>I really think that a future with no part 4 animated is worse than a future with animeonlys "messing it up". After all , if we don't get part 4 animated, we'll never get the rest.</br>  <br>Im a ed, edd,n eddy fan so this doesnt hurt me but like why?<br><br><br><br>it was meme, but it felt like an inside joke meme.</br></br></br></br></br>   We'll never see awakened cocky kira and BAITZADUSTO animated   <br>I'd rather the OVA team animate part 4. David should be banned from ever touching jojo again.</br>  <br> but it felt like an inside joke meme. <br>your elitism and double standards are disgusting</br></br>    <br> being an OVAfag <br>David did a great job &amp; I'm sure they'll do the rest of the parts justice when they animate them in the future.</br></br>  soon.  <br>If you read duwang because it was the only thing available at the time you are a better jojo fan than someone that refuses to read it.<br><br>I wish someone would put duwang on better quality raws though</br></br></br>  <br>So you want Part 4 to adapt the first chapter and then skip to the last 3?</br>  <br> we'll never get to see Jolyne crying about being caught masturbating animated </br>    <br>I love stands that wear helmets because of their goofy cartoon eyes.</br>  I want Part 4 animated so it can be over and people will shut the fuck up about it. Then the circlejerking over Kira and Josuke and blah blah blahbitty blah can be slightly reduced, maybe.  <br> your not a TRUE JoJo fan unless you rrad this shitty translation! </br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br>this thread is devolving into "I'm more elistist because I do this old things and don't want anyone else to!" trash</br>  <br> The OVA team <br>The OVA was 20 years ago, and it was a shit JoJo adaptation, the only problem with David was that it looked like garbage, but it was a much better adaptation of part 3.</br></br>  <br>Yeah the David animation kind of sucked, but it's still images were great (asides from the QUALITY which creeped up from time to time).</br>  <br> We'll never see Jolyne and Jotaro covered in jizz animated </br>  requesting the jojo template again  <br>If your opinion's not worth typing out each time you want to share it then it's not worth sharing.<br><br>Anyway I finished Part 7 a bit ago and started Part 8, definitely some wild rides</br></br></br>  <br>Is he based on billy d williams?</br>  <br>Maybe he reads raw mangas</br>  <br>holy shit bruv calm down<br><br><br>have fun</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks bruh</br>  <br>Even the raw says "DIO" because Araki is a westaboo like that</br>  <br> favorite villian </br>  <br>mine was Fatty</br>  <br> why is it ok for japanese to use engrish a lot but english speaking people cant use japanese quips without being a weaboo </br>  <br>English is a world wide super language everybody wants to know. Japanese is just some obscure island speak.</br>  <br>No. Faggots that read duwang now when there are better translations are just memers who want to be in on the inside joke. Those people aren't true fans</br>  <br>Westaboos haven't made a bad name for themselves unlike weeaboos.</br>  Make way for best supporting.  <br> Westaboos haven't made a bad name for themselves <br> chavs <br> hicks <br> slavs </br></br></br></br>  <br>good point.<br><br><br>also good point</br></br></br></br>  <br>You seem a bit confused. Weeaboo doesn't mean Japanese person, and likewise a westaboo isn't a western person.</br>  <br>You're right, they're more like the hikikomoris or otakus of their culture</br>    <br>there are people wh actually think that Hol Horse was supposed to join them after Justice</br>  Guys I'm going to a con in August and Johnny Yong Bosh is gonna be there. I'm gonna have him sign the my Jonathan figure's box, should I request him to say something from Jojo?  <br> going to cons <br> caring about dubs <br>Fuck off back to reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>how big is your dick</br>  <br>Big enough to tear ur mum's ketsumanko apart.</br>  Joseph Joestar is objectively the best JoJo  <br>I like the OVA's vision for JoJo more too, but whats wrong with David? They did a pretty good job with Part 1 and 2.<br><br>Its hard to do a good job with Part 3 when the problems lie in the source material.</br></br></br>  David Productions did a great job with JJBA and much better than the OVA<br><br>IMO, the best thing about the OVA was the final fight and it's comparable to DIO's WORLD in the new anime</br></br>  can somebody post the araki collage of him at various ages looking like he's 20 years old every decade  <br>I am willing to bet they will make a huge deal about his fingernails. holy shit wait just a second<br> Kira goes gay for Johnny just because of his fingernails </br></br>    <br>Kira only did the fingernail thing because of his killing urges, not because he likes fingernails.</br>  Because he has a fucking personality, actually had to train for shit and isn't afraid to take the piss out of even himself if need be.<br><br>Wouldn't catch Jotaro in drag even if it meant saving the day.</br></br>  <br>is this some kind of inside joke?<br>because if so i don't really see why it's being posted here</br></br>  I think people really don't give Johnathan enough credit.<br><br>I found his story to be one of the more engaging honestly. He was a class act who had an actual rivalry with Dio and a real personal stake in his quest<br><br>Hell Dio was far more engaging a villain her than he ever was with ZA WARULDO because he had a real relationship and rivalry with Johnathan and even a sense of respect. Watching them come to blows was great stuff with some real weight behind it<br><br>In Stardust he's just some asshole with a mook army. Jotaro has so little connection to Dio that he could have just as easily been a new character altogether.<br><br>They should have made Jotaro face off against Dio's son/grandson. Something that could actually rekindle the score the grandfathers had, make it seem like an actual legacy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta pretend one of the best jojos is shit so people know you read the manga amirite!<br><br>I'm up to date with Jojolion and Joseph is still my favorite Jojo.</br></br></br>  <br>I hear a lot of people praise the OVA's adaptations of DIO's World and D'arby the Gambler, but I always considered the Justice segment a highlight too.<br><br>I think those episodes are basically the only time the OVA improved on a fight by changing details. The darker tone of the series works really well during it too.</br></br></br>  <br>Holly looks incredibly ugly in the OVA.</br>  <br> Joseph is literally the gayest <br> bangs more chicks and sires more children than any other JoJo <br><br>OK dude.</br></br></br></br>  Since we are here, what was the track playing when Jotaro smashes Dio's head and then pours gasoline on him?<br><br>I can't seem to find it in the OST, unless it's not yet released</br></br>  <br>I really hate that the Anime kept the dbz-esque "energy auras" and Jotaro randomly flying around without explanation.</br>  Old Joseph is cute.<br><br>I wish there were more father-son bonding moments.</br></br>  <br>Seeing Joseph use Hermit Purple to catch the baby was nice to see.</br>    <br>Crab does a lot of research when he does a new girl. He thought it through enough to where I won't question him.</br>    <br> not accepting every facet of your waifu, good and bad <br><br>The fuck happened to you /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>They became elitist.</br>  <br>He's head and shoulders above almost everyone else<br><br>I can't believe how lazy artists get when it comes to monstergirls</br></br></br>  A best sister.<br>A best everything.</br>  <br>But how can she be best sister when Izumi is best sister</br>  <br>She's an alcohol and it's destroying her family.</br>  I think you accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister.  <br>We're posting best sisters, not worst sisters.</br>  Best nee-san.  <br>They all have problems.</br>  <br>Kazue may be divorced but she's holding the family together pretty much on her own.</br>  <br> you will never lick Kazue's butthole after a long day of court <br><br>why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>W-what is going on here?</br>  <br>I want to take care of her.</br>  <br>W-WHAT IS HAPPENING?</br>  <br><br>He's putting heat pads on her because she has some muscle condition where she gets pain.</br></br>  <br>Oh, so that's what it was.</br>  <br>Brotherly love</br>  <br>I want to  hug her tenderly. </br>  <br> Selfish <br> Slut <br> Drunk <br> Loud <br>No she's shit. Then again all the onee-sans are..<br><br> is perfection though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cow tits <br> drunk <br> wastes money <br> isn't Izumi or Nazuna <br>Nah.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remind me, /a/. Why do they never see their mom and why does Katanashi not want to see her?  I just started watching it, but im wondering, is there actual romance at some point?  <br>She's a combination of all his sisters' worst traits and he blames her for their personal failings. She's a 7 foot tall mean, bossy alcoholic whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition.</br>  <br>It's a comedy, not romance. Things do develop with Todoroki and Sanji, eventually.</br>  <br>Assuming this season is the last one and ends like the manga does, yes there is some actual romance. Very little, but it's there.</br>  <br>Wow, that's fucked up.</br>  <br> whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition. </br>  <br>I want her to marry me and take care of me and rape me.</br>  <br><br>You guys are fucking faggots.<br><br>Nothing wrong with liking alcohol. It just means that she's a laid back girl that likes to have fun. Not necessarily a bad trait. And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br><br> implying cowtits is a bad trait <br>Fuck outta here faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to buy izumi cute dresses  <br>I haven't seen that in a while.</br>  <br> And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br>Ayyy</br></br>  <br>Drinking alcohol is fine, but when it's a defining trait of hers and she is seen continuously drunk, that is another. Try defending Alcoholism.</br>  <br>She's not killing or hurting anybody, just having fun. Get off her case, party pooper.</br>  <br>Alcoholism is great. The bigger issue is that she is obnoxious and incompetent while drinking and is constantly very drunk rather than simply compulsively drinking.<br>The only reason alcoholism is bad simply because it's a vice and any kind of crutch is bad whether it's cleaning or exercise. If you're reliant on it, it shouldn't be around. It's slightly worse than those because as a vice it invites other issues if done wrong but it's nowhere near as bad as stuff like gambling or stealing which are inherently damaging no matter how you look at it. <br>Alcoholism ranges from harmless to a money sink, to a health issue, to livelihood destroying/family breaking for sure but it still has range.</br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  When she eventually snaps...  <br><br><br><br> being a useless drunk is cool! <br><br>I like this. Being a Foreman at work I already know who the drunkards are and assign them the most work. Their pissing, bitching and moaning while they sweat like whores in church is most gratifying. Vowing to not drink again only to get shitfaced that night and come in drunk/hangover and then I assign them more manual labor. <br><br>It sustains me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  drunk waifu is best waifu  <br>Look at this square ass faggot. I bet you have no friends and no one likes you.</br>  <br>Are you my dad, because he's been doing this to his crew for like 30 years.</br>  i want to be pet by takanashi-kun  <br> divorced <br>No man likes a bossy cunt. MC has good life lessons from his sisters though. He knows what type of women to completely avoid.</br></br>  <br>what if it is your dad</br>  <br>This should bother me why? Unless you'd like to work for me? Come on over.<br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Not saying it should bother you, just pointing it out. You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life while people have fun. To each their own.</br>  <br>Not going to work drunk and/or severely hungover isn't living a "no fun allowed" life, it's just being a base-level functioning member of society.</br>  <br>If this is baitoza, then it's the bait of the baits, one-shots both Gilgabait and Baitrou.<br><br>No seriously salsa plz? Is this real life or a sea of Fanta?</br></br></br>  <br> You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life <br><br>I am happy thank you. But you, you stay buttblasted over my work ethic lazy deadbeat bum.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, but it's not like Kozue goes to work hungover so why did the faggot bring work into the whole conversation in the first place?<br><br><br>I don't give a fuck about your work ethic, It's not like I'm working for you.</br></br></br></br>  Do people actually find alcoholics appealing?  <br>You should since you sound like a spoiled little brat. A good day's manual labor while get that terrible shit outta you.</br>  <br>Only when I'm fucking them senseless in the bathroom.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br> I accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br> only when I'm masturbating furiously into my hand at the thought of having sex with an alcoholic whore </br>  <br>It'll be glorious. too bad we'll never see it.</br>  <br>I do.

Also, he prefers DFC.</br>  I remember when Working!! threads were full of conspiracy theories about how it's propaganda to pull us out of our NEET life, now the threads are full of normalfags. Did the userbase on 4chan change or did the propaganda actually work?  <br>SICK FUCK</br>  <br>Well, it sure as hell didn't work on me, so the former.</br>  <br>Will this get adapted?</br>  <br>Of course, this season is the last.</br>  <br>4chan has always had high user turnover, but board culture on /a/ these days does seem a lot more normalfaggy than it did 5 years ago. Probably unavoidable when the current mods are normalfags themselves who drove away a lot of posters.</br>  <br> GULP GULP GULP <br> PAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH </br></br>  <br>Isn't it too behind? I know they don't adapt it linearly but i'm not so sure?</br>  <br><br>Well, he might want to abduct ... I mean adopt Poplar as his daughter<br><br><br><br>Would 1 cour actually be enough to wrap everything up?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>On the contrary, /a/ has always been the best at retaining userbase, that userbase just grew up, you can't stay NEET forever.</br>  <br><br> almost 30 <br> still NEET <br> preparing to multiclass into wizard <br><br>unlimited power will soon be mine</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everyone grew up <br> you didin't <br> moot left before you did <br><br>well i probably will end up dead before leaving anytime soon or later</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whice episode was this from again?</br>  <br><br>This gave me an erection<br> Every fucking time </br></br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't Masochist-kun supposed to be introduced after Yamada's mother?

Knowing how she is she could be all over him.  <br>She did, but they didn't adapt it.</br>  <br><br>Bueno.</br></br>  <br>It would have been interesting is Satou gave up on Chief and settled for Kozue.</br>  <br>Poplar has a boyfriend.</br>  <br>Or Inami.</br>  I wonder how things would be if Kyouko had fallen for Satou when he cooked for her.  <br> Satou and Inami <br><br>It's such a crack pairing it could work.</br></br></br>  <br>Well she needs someone to take care of her and he's a responsible guy. Why not.</br>  <br><br>Yachiyo might try to kill Satou just like what she does to Otoo-san</br></br>  <br>She did meet him and tried hitting on him, but he didn't like her.</br>  So when does Inami meet the M ex-husband and how quickly do they marry?  <br><br> And then Inami ends up curing Minegishi's masochism since he can't take her punches </br></br>  <br>He doesn't deserve her</br>  All this talk about characters getting resolution had me wondering.<br><br>Does normal get with anyone? Does she finally get the husbando she deserves?</br></br>  All the sisters are goddess tier except for the lawyer.  I think I came to the realization that I hate just about everyone in the Takanashi family  <br>She is just stressed from work and her ex.<br><br>Karino please.</br></br></br>  <br>The mangaka hints at a pairing with Kirio.</br>  <br>Literally who</br>  <br><br>your waifus are shit <br><br><br><br>the boy Yamada</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She does meet him, and their meeting is the catalyst for him getting back together with Kazue when he realizes that he only likes to be abused by his wife. </br>  <br>Izumi din do nuffin. She a good girl.</br>  <br>Normal-chan and the guy that makes the rest of the cast look relatively normal by comparison? Da fuck?</br>  <br>more like worst sister ever fucking bitch can't even stand half the time</br>  <br> I need alcohol and a lot of noise to have fun <br>Nah, it's you who is boring</br></br>  <br>I'll cut you m8</br>  <br> Izumi din do nuffin. <br><br>yeah that's kind of the problem. She's damn near 30 years old and has to be coddled by a teenager</br></br></br>  <br>They run into each other later on, and Kirio takes a liking to her because she's cute. She's still standoffish with him at the end of the series though, but give it time.</br>  <br>they are all mostly useless shits</br>  <br> I need alcohol and a lot of noise to have fun <br> People that drink MUST drink to start having fun </br></br>  <br> He knows what type of women to completely avoid. <br>Yet he hooked up with a girl who was given a severe dose of male truma by her dad just because he didn't want her banging dudes one day.</br></br>  <br>her and yamada are literally the worst characters in the history of everything working if I could push a button that would murder both of them in an instant I would</br>   people who actually prefer Yamada-san to Yamada-kun   <br><br>izumi is a perfect <br><br>A PERFECT<br><br>I want to brew her a cup of tea and lie down and listen to the sound of her writing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He likes her specifically because she is unlike his sisters underneath her violent exterior.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127998820 <br>oh shit son then that looks like you have a lot of fucking off back to /v/ to get to</br>  <br><br>he likes her because she's just like his family, completely abusive and belong behind bars</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127998820 <br>holy shit what</br>  <br>But he said that he likes her kindness and cuteness and the fact that she cares about his feelings, unlike his sisters who take advantage of him.</br>  I feel like the lawyer bitch sister is most likely stealing all the money from Izumi's book proceeds and also makes Kozue sleep with potential clients to help her practice that family truly needs to die  <br><br> Implying Izumi actually makes money off anything when she keeps missing deadlines </br></br>  <br>why would a publisher stick with her even if she can never make a deadline? she must sell well<br><br>do we ever find out what genre books she writes?</br></br></br>  <br> Izumi <br> best anything </br></br>  <br><br>Yes  if you watched S1 and S2 , she apparently writes romance-type novels</br></br>  <br><br>yes, romance</br></br>  <br><br>thanks, it's been awhile since I've watched the 1st two seasons</br></br>    <br>By spoiling her.</br>  remove yamada you are the worst working remove yamada from the premises ahahaha  Does anyone else takanashi is poisoning Izumi so she is weak so he can take care of her? <br><br>remember in the 1st episode he literally says he wants to take care of something that's really weak</br></br>  <br>Except Izumi isn't really weak. She's a lazy bum who uses her "weakness" as justification to order people around.</br>  <br>ah so she is poisoning herself makes sense too</br>  <br><br>Where do you people get those ideas from?</br></br>  <br>I'll take good care of her. She's much better than a bossy bitch and a drunkard slut.</br>  <br>Being a worthless shut in isn't much better.</br>  <br>Kazue will never be bossy with you</br>  <br><br> worthless <br><br>but everything in life is equally worthless</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanna take care of both Kazue and Izumi</br>  <br>it's not hard to put the pieces together</br>  <br>NOW he knows how it works!</br>  <br><br>Kyouko is fucking sex. I don't get why some people dislike her.</br></br>  <br>The new intro is just lewd with Kyouko sexiness.</br>  <br>Because aside from being kind of hot, she's a lazy gluttonous shit.</br>  <br>Just like me.</br>  <br> lazy <br>Sure.<br> gluttonous <br>Yeah.<br> bitch <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   being attracted to a old hag   <br>He said shit, not bitch.</br>  <br>I can't into reading. Anyway, you get my point.</br>  <br> Implying cakes aren't the best </br>  <br>Because she works in a resturaunt and she<br> Eats more product than the cooks  <br> She's lazy as shit <br> She's not very helpful at all. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It don't matter--none of that matters. I'll tease her with sweets and cook delicious meals for her; trading them for disgusting sexual favors.</br>  <br>Not now boner</br>  <br>She's the manager, therefore she has less work and can afford to be more lazy than the actual employees. Are people that mad about her eating that much? You guys are fucking stupid. Especially if you consider her backstory which explains why she's like that.</br>  It matters to me, then again I cook, so her being a lazy bastard who does nothing but eats really strikes me in my hate-space  <br> She's the manager <br> therefore she has less work <br> and can afford to be more lazy than the actual employees. <br>Kill yourself. No, I'm not going to argue this, just kill yourself please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kazue needs to find another beta to marry and boss around.<br>I'll take care of Izumi and Nazuna.</br></br>    <br>And even worse, it doesn't matter how the food tastes. She's just an insatiable black hole. She will also trust anyone that feeds her.</br>  <br> Nosebleed <br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  <br>So what the reason then? Only backstory I've seen for her was her hoodlum days when she was with Yachiyo.</br>  <br>This doujin made no sense at all, who would let their pet be used by others like that?</br>  <br>I thought they were leasing them out for money.</br>  I wonder why Takanashi kept doing Jojo poses, i can't take this seriously.   The Takanashi Siblings <br><br> Eldest sister (Kazue) - Divorced with her husband when she realized that the one she truly loved was his younger brother. Became a lawyer to serve as a stepping stone to become a politician in hopes that one day she will legalize incest when elected into parliament <br><br> 2nd eldest (Izumi) - Novelist specializing in incestuous romance between brother and sister until the editor wanted her to write other type of romance and the piles of crumbled paper is proof that she's struggling to write anything other than sibling incest. Indulge in a pampered and dependent lifestyle with her younger brother tending to her needs <br><br> 3rd eldest (Kozue) - Constantly gets drunk after being dumped by guys she dated every time she moaned her brother's name when having sex <br><br> Youngest (Nazuna) - Cunning and manipulative for her age, she manipulates her older sisters in order to protect her precious older brother from being 'bullied' by them <br><br> Only son (Souta) - Knows nothing about his sisters secretly lusting for his cock. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>Even his dad wanted to fuck him</br>  <br><br>You forgot Souta being a better girl than most girls</br></br>  <br/>  <br>do people in Japan still use flip phones?</br>  <br><br>they're transitioning; in any case, it was left by her dad</br></br>  <br>I can buy that. Other than Kazue they all seem to have a bond with Souta that's more than mere sibling affection, but I bet Kazue is just being tsun.</br>  would you download a poplar?  <br>Confirmed best girl<br><br><br>Surprisingly a lot of them still do, i still see em everywhere when i was there last year on vacation, tho mostly old folks use them</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>She only dates pure guys, and then they run away when she tries to rape them.</br>  <br>She must be wanting it so bad then, Souta-kun should help his sister.</br>  <br>She's a raving slut who's a virgin. Isn't it sad?</br>  <br>I don't remember Daisy at all. I'm rewatching season 2 for the sole purpose of finding her introduction.</br>  <br>It truly is, but funny too.</br>  <br>Kozue is probably the only Takanashi Minegishi doesn't like. With her endless bubbly optimism, she'd probably never snap at him.</br>  <br>She very clearly isn't a virgin, she's talked about sex before.</br>  <br>We're just joking, Anon.</br>  <br>What the fuck? The higher position you get, the less you have to work. You're a mongoloid if you don't understand that.<br><br><br>Yeah. that explains exactly why she's so lazy.</br></br></br></br>  Nazuna a shit  I haven't watched this season yet, is kantanashi still a beta cuck whiney ass fuccboi about his sisters being taller than him?  <br> The higher position you get, the less you have to work. <br>This is rarely true, you just do less grunt work. Management usually has a ton of paperwork and other shit to do and have to work ungodly hours as well as dealing with lots of responsibilities.<br><br>You'll find this is the case with most jobs. The whole "I'm the manager so I just sit around doing nothing all day" is just shit you see in TV.<br><br>Only the top CEOs can pull that shit and they're still busy as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you actually had a fucking job in your life? Or are you a retarded NEET? The higher up you are, you have to do even MORE work</br>  <br><br>NEET is love. NEET is life.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, less grunt work. Hence why we don't see her work her ass off in the show. Now, unless you haters tell me you want screentime of her doing paperwork for her to not be a ''lazy shit'', you guys are just fucking haters for no reason.<br><br><br>I just came back from my job and turns out it's a job where I get to do the shit job while supervisor does the clean job and gets to leave earlier than me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She very clearly doesn't even do paperwork you retard, the fucking owner even mentions how he has to catch up on paperwork whenever he comes back from searching for his wife. She literally does nothing but eat food and laze about, she's an active detriment to the restaurant.</br>  <br>You shut your mouth, YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH!</br>  <br>Actually, though your position on CEO's is bullshit, Kyouko doesn't work, because as shown, she's got the work out of connections.<br><br>We've been shown the paperwork is done by Otoo.<br><br>Kyouko does very little.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she was she'd be fired by now. Stop hating.</br>  <br>And I work in a restaurant, where both front of house and back of house managers have a huge load and a lot of responsibility. In no way do they have less work, and they're expected to perform the grunt duties if for any reason the grunt doesn't show up, in addition to a multitude of other responsibilities that still need to get done, even as they do it.<br>You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. <br>As for paperwork, she doesn't even do that, the big boss does that. She doesn't do anything except kick people out then hire thugs to beat them, which is a pretty bad thing to do. <br><br>Go eat a dick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If she was she'd be fired by now. <br>This is a comedy, you know? You've seen her even call grunts to beat up customers who don't pay.<br><br> Stop hating. <br>Are you underage? You're being told and proven you're wrong. Stop bitching about that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If she was she'd be fired by now. <br> Applying real life logic to anime. <br>Yes and Yachiyo would also have been fired for carrying a weapon around at all times. And Yamada would have been fired for being a useless shit.

They chose Ufo because they already worked on the franchise (game OPs, I think) and they also made anime for another of their franchises (Tales, which is also getting another anime by Ufo next year)<br>So they deicided to advertise the game with a TV show made by an studio that already worked for them before. Not so weird, right?</br></br>  <br><br>you realize this entire adaptation's purpose is to be a giant glorified advertisement to the remake of the first game, right?</br></br>  <br>With same regard, for the people who doesn't know, Capcom have countless merchandises for Monster Hunter like purses, handbags, handphone covers, capsule toys, kitchenware, figures, socks, jackets, comics, i.e. anything under the sun for advertising the franchise as well.</br>  DIOOOOOOOOOOO  <br/>  <br>why make an anime of the least popular MH clone though?

Simply because it's a videogame adaptation.<br>Nevermind the fact that /v/ is way too normalfag to have EVER heard of God Eater or doing anything else than calling it "weebshit" if someone ever brought it up.</br></br>  <br>Again, because Bamco wanted to advertise it<br>Go cry to Capcom to get them to hire some studio to make a MH anime, MHfag<br>It's not hard to understand that Bamco would want to advertise their game with a TV show?<br> least popular <br>Maybe that's precisely why they want to advertise it with a TV show? Because it's not popular? <br>Stuff that's already popular doesn't need advertising<br>Why are you so dumb?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do fans of the game like the artstyle?<br>Because I don't play it and thought it looked awful but maybe is just not for me.</br>  Posting glorious OSTs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l28<wbr>JllnZ5PE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rT0<wbr>WpdrCJYE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=crE<wbr>cGrcW2Xk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aop<wbr>qrLFgAFk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's better than the game.

The character animation is extremely choppy though, to the point some scenes look like it's just a couple FPS (like the gum scene). <br><br>The backgrounds are gorgeous, and don't look like they belong in the show. They can do some cool stuff with the characters being full CGI, but it ends up looking terrible more often than not.<br><br>The story is really bland though. I don't give a shit about any of the characters and I'm having a tough time following what is going on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not complaining here. UFOTable doesn't look like they can do 2D well for the Aragamis.</br>   another chinese cartoon about sending emotionally-unstable teenagers to do the job trained adults should do <br> also, terribad CGI </br>  <br> characters being full CGI <br>They're 2D</br></br>  <br> Characters are full CGI <br>Stop this retarded meme. The only CGI is the aragami.</br></br>  <br> Trained adults <br>Good job finding them considering how dangerous being a GE is. Most of them don't live enough to see adulthood<br> Terribad CGI <br>The aragami looked great, faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>instantly raided by IRC, there were no survivors</br>  <br><br>he'll die later I bet. Gotta build him up a little bit before he jobs</br></br>  <br>Second is PSO2. That makes GE in 3rd place.</br>  <br><br>So they managed to make 2D look as awful as CGI, and don't get any of the budget saving that CGI gets?<br><br>Wow, way to go GE!</br></br></br></br>  <br>why couldn't we just get this?</br>  <br><br>nigger, in the event of an apocalyptic event where titans/BETA/eotans/whatever the fuck else invade, which age demographic do you think gets killed first.</br></br>  <br> Good job finding them considering how dangerous being a GE is. Most of them don't live enough to see adulthood <br>Why not just use adults for the God Eater procedure to begin with rather than angsty teenagers?</br></br>  <br> there are more people in this picture than there are people who actually bought GE </br>  <br>How could you not tell they were 2D? It's clearly 2D with heavy digital effects</br>  <br>  <br>There's a reason, Soma was the youngest God Eater at twelve.<br><br> He's part aragami, when he came out the womb he devoured his mother, she's with him always. <br><br>The CGI/shading is shit though. I had hopes the animation would be like the previous game OPs, OVA and pachiko game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>most studios can't into complex monster movement. The only one's left that know how are the industry veterans, and there isn't enough of them or time these days.</br></br>  <br>You wanted shading, you got it.</br>  <br>Because they decided to go with the style of the opening of the latest game (GE2RB)<br>Sorry that you dislike different artstyles<br><br>It looks great, fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems alright. Downloaded the game to try it out on my phone.<br><br>I doubt I'll ever play it though</br></br></br>  <br>Nice repeating numerals dude, shame that the artstyle isn't as good as your triple dubs.</br>  <br>But it is like the latest game OP</br>  <br>haha ur rite lol</br>   this show looks like shit, it has too much details! <br>You fucks are crazy. Or rather, you're ignorant as hell.</br>  <br>I don't get why /v/ is the boogeyman. Every thread about this game on /v/ gets shitposted because it's not MH.</br>  I like Ufotable, but I'm honest enough to admit that the characters look bad.<br>On the other hand, the Aragamis look great, but the animation is shit and the CG just doesn't blend well with the 2D drawings.<br>The battles are underwhelming.</br></br>  <br> phone <br>wat</br></br>  Fuck you God Eater. UBW's final episodes would've been animated better if you didn't take away their budget.  <br> He think UBW wasn't top priority to the point GE got delayed 2 weeks <br>Just fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Who is this pretty young tan'g?</br>  <br> newly /v/ermin calling senpai newfag  <br><br>This is embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> Keep shitposting to a minimum. <br>CG shit. ufotable is finished!</br></br>  <br><br> not realizing the whole point of GE's 2 week delay was the production bottleneck on UBW episode 15 during the winter break <br><br>how about no</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the women wearing such revealing clothes in the battlefield? Don't they think that they are 90% responsible of all the men death for distracting them while moving around with those clothes?</br></br>  <br><br>This project got massively fucked over by UBW.<br><br>I'd be glad if I was ufo/bamco that this somehow didn't end up becoming BlazBlue or Gunslinger Stratos levels of terrible</br></br></br></br>  <br> Had to cancel the advanced screening of episode 1 <br> Had to delay the actual airing a week <br>How does this situation lead you to believe that they were focusing on GE instead of UBW?</br></br></br>  Has there actually been any official comments on the approach they've taken with the animation? The coloring looks like nothing I have ever seen in any other anime, from a technical standpoint. What exactly are the production methods used?  Holy shit I just watched the episode. <br><br>What was that?<br><br>The animation looks horrible and the amount of CG almost made me throw up. The direction looked poorly made.<br><br>Why is that allowed?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lots of CGI and filters</br>  <br><br>To answer your Frodo.<br>The reason is Adult far more resistant to Oracle cell, so it's more likely wil devouring human.<br>The Adult/Retired GE like Tsubaki have their bracelet sealed to keep cell at dormant state.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What exactly are the production methods used? <br><br>rushed cgi is what they used.</br></br></br>  <br> not even new IP <br>Go away shitposter.</br></br>  <br><br>what are you talking about? 2d looking like 3d?

Those things aren't picky eaters</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm talking about the coloring, which is definitely not CGI. and I'm not necessarily talking about there being multiple layers of shading.<br><br>What I mean is that it's clear how they achieve the style, it's multi layered cell shading with heavy use of gradient colors, but something about it, like the outlines, makes me think that they might have some technically new approach to it, like a different non-standard software/plugin/approach to the coloring.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> monsters eating only humans <br><br>anon why do you think they're called 'mad gods'? They eat fucking everything, and got their namesake by devouring religious statues and melding with them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it's just how the key frames are drawn.

I understand what the problem is. The execution was fine and Eric even got to live, unlike in the game. I finished the first game and even I thought the first episode was okay.</br></br>  <br> They really wanted Yuu as the protagonist. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br><br>I like how they removed the likes/dislikes and the comments. There were originally an assload of dislikes for this video.</br></br>  <br> eric is gonna die  i guarantee that,</br>  <br>Japan really like their bland non-offensive protagonists.</br>  <br>Probably to see animated Alisa getting horny for Yuu</br>  <br>But Alisa gets horny for the Protagonist, in the Manga's case the Protagonist was Yuu.</br>  Pretty bad, but manages to look better than most of the attempts at CGI anime I've seen. Which still isn't that good, but it's still preferable to Knights of Sidonia.  <br>Also he's in the LN, the manga and LNs are tied to the game and 'Yuu' is canon. Just like 'Hiro'.<br><br>These names they choose for the protags though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's still superior to his role in the game, where he got less than 5 lines before dying in the very beginning.</br></br>  <br> The protagonist revealing his SUPER SPECIAL POWER. <br><br>His power is not special or unique. There are other New-Types, he's just the first assigned to the branch he's a part of. Also all it means is that his God Arc can transform between a sword and gun, while Old-Types can only use one or the other.</br></br></br>   They don't know about the real best girl <br>Fools.</br>  I want to see Kanon shoot someone in mid-jump!<br>Seriously, fuck her.</br>  <br>You clearly haven't played the PC port then.</br>  <br>lmao stick to nasushit ufo</br>  Das it mane  <br>The monster CGI is horrible. They are really abusing the slow mo and why does Ufo likes to use shitty CGI on everything. Rain, sky, smoke? CGI for fucking everything.</br>  No results from searching, so is anyone noticing the shaking? Every time there's any scene with little to no actual movement you can see that the camera is constantly moving back and forth just 1-2 pixels. Is this a CR fuckup or what?  Why is /a/ so afraid of CG in their anime?  Are you a true man that believes big tits deserve the number one priority of any girl in anime character design?  You wouldn't know what to do with them even if you got the chance, loser.  <br>Tits are life,<br>Ass is hometown<br><br>Both are great and should be given the care they're due</br></br></br></br>  <br>Squeeze them, slap them around, suck them. What else?</br>  No. The size of breasts need to compliment the body type.<br><br>A loli with massive tumours is unappealing. Likewise, a Christmas cake, or librarian type character with mosquito bites is just as confusing.</br></br>   Came into this thread <br> Expecting it to break out into cowtits vs dfc brigade <br> See  and  and  <br><br>I'm proud of you, /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br> Likewise, a Christmas cake, or librarian type character with mosquito bites is just arousing </br>  <br><br>Hey, a girl's hometown is important too.</br></br>  bodies are bind to the character, they are completely irrelevant if the girl is shit.  I like large breasts on intimidating girls    As long as the face is cute and the body relatively slender I can appreciate all body types. <br><br>Big boobs, Small boobs, Petite butts, Big butts, DFC, DFA. <br><br>All can be delicious on the right girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. If the face is good then I'm down. There's appeal in almost all body types. <br><br>I'm a little picky about legs and hips but when it comes to tits and ass size I don't care much.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Large oppai will always be first place in my heart but I agree.</br>  <br>fuck tits, fuck ass, all that matters is face, hair and midriff.<br><br>midriff&gt;all.</br></br></br>  No, I'm a fictional man.  I believe in contrast.<br><br>Big isn't big if everything is big.<br><br>Flat isn't flat when everything is flat.<br><br>Only with contrast can one appreciate the full spectrum of sizes. Like a real gentleman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Of course<br><br> all can be delicious on the right girl. <br><br>That's indisputable. <br>Big tits do add a lot to the girl's appeal though.

I also like small breasts, short hair, long hair, tall girls, short girls, pale skin, tanlines, dark skin, and eyebrows.</br></br>  <br>But what kind of midriffs? <br>Soft tummies are the best. Not fat, just soft and shapely.</br></br>  <br>As if you can do all those towards 2D girls</br>  <br> breasts <br> neck <br> collarbones <br><br>Together they are easily the sexiest part of a woman.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does this make you feel anything?</br>  <br>Specifically I like the kind that forget/don't acknowledge they have large breasts.<br>I don't mind the type that remember they have them then start blushing and getting all girly but really prefer the kind are afraid to use them.</br></br>  <br>You can't do anything to a 2D girl.
