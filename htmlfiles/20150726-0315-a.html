[ Onii-chan!<br><br>Daisuki~</br></br>  ORE NO TURN  <br>MAGIKKU CADOO</br>  <br>Thank you, Ruri-chan~</br>  <br>WATASHI NO TAAN</br>  Neo-  <br>What happened to alladin again ?</br>  <br>Time for Fudo no Dyeuru on Motorbikes.</br>  <br>-s SHOKAN!</br>  <br>He got carded.</br>  <br>Carded</br>  As a longtime browser of /dng/, and a somewhat new browser of the ARC-V thread here on /a/, what's with the animosity between the two threads? Whenever someone says something that the posters largely disagree with, /dng/ has been directing people to the /a/ thread. But when the do the same thing here, they redirect them to /dng/. <br><br>I'm just wondering if there was some sort of conflict between the two threads, or if SOMETHING happened, here. I've honestly been out of the loop for a while.</br></br>   not posting the best girl for a new thread. <br>its like you fags dotn even care anymore.</br>  WHEN?    <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Pixiv makes it hard for me to take Yuri seriously some times. They seem to like the idea that he's obsessed with mochi.</br>  <br>/a/rc-v talks about the anime and some times about the card game which can go on with out people fling shit on each other and say X card is better that X card, from what ive seen people in arc-v thread are some what nicer than that shit-hole /dng/, while as people who ENJOY playing pet decks &amp; having fun /dng/ is where fun goes to die.</br>  <br>If you wanna talk about Nationals or Regionals go to /dng/.<br><br>If you wanna talk about the mysteries of the Ruris, post here.<br><br>Above all else don't be a meta-posting faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll get her spot light soon. Right now it's bikers, samurai and ninja time.</br>  <br>We like to have fun here.<br>You like to be insufferable tryhard tripfags there.</br></br>  <br>Soon after Gon v. Crow.<br>Now if you were referring to when we'll see Reira's smile in-show I couldn't say. That expression is Kaiba Ultra Parallel Rare</br></br>  <br>But the best girl was posted in the OP</br>  <br>In all my time on /a/ I never knew what true love was like until Serena. <br><br>I understand Yuya and Shun's pain of no Ruri.</br></br></br>  <br>Because when /dng/ is bad, as of the recent banlist, it dissolves into mostly shitposting and elitism, and usually a combination of both, like how anything that isn't apparently Nekroz, Qlis, Shaddolls, BA, or Tellars is a rogue petdeck that can't win shit and shouldn't even be played. <br><br>Not everyone at /dng/ is like that, but a lot of them are, whether it's shitposting or not.<br><br>Meanwhile we just argue between who has Serena, Fusion vs. Xyz, and Ruris.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like I'll fit right in, then.<br><br>Trips seem to be dwindling nowadays. Coincidentally, so is post quality, but, eh, fair point.<br><br><br>Sorry, that'll be the last of that from me. I appreciate the help.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Selena is love, selena is life<br> tfw you'll never find a girl like her ever, only in your dreams. </br></br>  <br>I want to commit a crime.</br>  <br>Post Yuri</br>  <br> tfw had dreams about her already <br> tfw not even that is consistent  <br><br>Suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br> As a longtime browser of /dng/ <br>Stopped reading right there.

The author who made that great YuyaXYuzu one that was translated also is releasing this.</br>  <br> Serena will never hug me like that <br>Also<br> trips  <br> trio <br><br>Good job.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see Serena enslave Yuri.</br>    http://exhentai.org/g/813747/4f79ac<wbr>1776/</wbr>  <br>It's alright Sawatari, we know Serena only has eyes for you, and that you're a good boy and good snack butler.</br>  <br> not exhentai link <br>You were already wrong, but you're also a faggot.</br></br>  <br>Has she even said his name, once. I think the only people she's called by name are Reiji and Yuzu.</br>  <br> implying anyone will ever love Sawatari <br> except for me </br></br>  <br>False.</br>  <br>She told him to calm down once and he calmed down, who else is capable of that? Outside of Reiji and Shun, Sawatari has had the most interaction with her. <br><br>Everyone loves Sawatari, everyone. Underworld Troupe when?</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji and Serena are meant for each other.</br>  <br>You stop right there Akaba Reiji.</br>  So much Yuri love, /a/ cannot resist the perfection of fusion dimension  <br>i dont like him, he's annoying</br>  <br>Watch the manzais with him, they're actually really adorable.</br>  So, accurate?  <br>They have cute boys and a crude Ruri, what's not to like?</br>  <br>Depends on what decks people on /a/ use, from what I seen a few of them would be fine.</br>  <br> fusion <br> perfect <br> not Standard </br></br></br>  ruri  <br>i use these two<br> spellbook with synchro spellcasters  <br> Ritual Beast <br>:^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>   Judai will never appear again and interact with the people of Academia, Serena, or Yuya because people don't want the previous MCs to return <br> not even as Supreme King <br><br>Life is suffering</br></br></br>  <br>The only working deck I have right now is Prophecy, and we all know how that turned out.<br>So, probably.</br></br>  What band/singer would you like for the next OP?  <br>FLOW</br>  <br>Ruri?</br>  <br>nice Ancient Gears ;)</br>  <br>I'd love for Supreme King Judai to appear, but he'd completely and utterly overshadow Leo as nothing more than a minion.</br>   4K realizes the dub OP is shit <br> 4K lets the community vote on a band to perform the new OP <br>Who would you vote for?<br>I'd think Zebrahead would do a great job.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a minor character. We all are.<br>They would pull some combo on you and you will be sealed into a cardboard prison</br></br>  <br>Petit Milady.</br>  <br>Tommy Heavenly6, BACK-ON, or Sambomaster.</br>  <br> When Yuri falls, Leo's last resort is Supreme King Judai <br> Judai and Yuya have a duel in their Supreme King modes for maximum edge <br><br>That would be extremely entertaining</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish they would do that again. Hyperdrive and Ride to Survive were too good for their own good.</br>  <br>I'd at least be an antagonist for one of the Lancers to take down.</br>  smoll &amp; not so smoll  <br>The God of War shall not lose.</br>  <br>Yugi is such a fucking manlet.</br>  <br>I wonder what deck Yuri plays, I hope it's bugs</br>  <br>I would pee myself if that happened. Too bad they're busy perfoming for mainstream anime.</br>  <br>What if I play Vampires with Plaguespreader for Synchros and Dragon's Mirror for Dragonecro? I'd be cool and using all the summoning methods!</br>  <br>I want Yuri to card me.</br>  <br>How can Jack be so tall if he only eat instant ramen as a child.</br>  <br>That or grim m  fairy tales.</br>  <br>Why is Yuri so perfect?</br>  <br> Jack's old duel disk <br>One job.</br></br>  <br>Kaiba and Jack are all the way on the right away from the manlets.</br>  <br>Pure Aryan genetics.</br>  <br>I dont think he was able to have it often, they were poor so it was an occasional treat</br>  Are there actually Tuner monsters in the world of Zexal?<br>Scrap Hunter appears in Zexal and it mentions Tuner monster.</br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  <br>Specially if the monsters are the ends of the tales, which all know almost all of them end miserable or dead.</br>  <br> Evilswarm </br>  <br>Yes, but everyone circlejerks XYZ SHOKAN as kind of the best thing around.<br>Kaito once upon a time did a total of one fusion and one ritual summon and never did it again for instance.</br></br>  <br>Probably. Zexal probably just focused on shilling Xyzs<br> I still want Magnedragon to get a fucking print </br></br>  <br>Because his voice is sex.</br>  <br>Kaito was truly the savior of Zexal duels</br>  <br>Indeed, without him and IV the duels would have been so shit.</br>   characters in the anime create their own cards on the spot <br><br>Fuck it, I'm gonna make some fake cards and get them made. I only play with friends anyways.</br></br>  <br>but anon you hear yuuya every episode</br>  <br>Vectors antics and faces also helped.<br>Meanwhile.<br> Yuma didn't go for the actual duelist with a cat kink <br>Faaaaag</br></br></br></br>  <br>She might be the worst duelist in the history of YGO, I don't even think Rex/Weevil were that bad.</br>  <br> wanting a buttplug wearing slut </br>  <br>Ya know I always got the sneaking suspicion she was a buttplug kind of girl too.</br>  <br>But she actually dueled.<br>Actually hell, I tried out cat deck on Tag Force Special, it's really not a bad deck since you can easily end up with a casual 4000 attack monster.<br><br><br> not wanting a devoted cat slut <br> not wanting one that breaks into your own house to suck your dick. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying you wouldn't be part of Fusion's Anti-Academia Movement using Heros  <br><br>Obelisk Force uses Antique Gears, it makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, that reminds me-- do you have that GIF of Vector laughing at Durbe and Rio, as the LP meter showed up, displaying he still had 4000 life points? I can't for the life of me find it.<br><br><br>Actually, Rex and Weevil basically faced each other in the finals of a tournament that was, essentially, a Nationals. (Rex won, but in-canon they were supposedly good.)<br><br><br>If you need help with PSCT, let us know. I know that, at the very least, I could help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cathy would have been best girl if the ass was actually that fat</br>  <br>Yuya doesn't say things like "This game of tag is over"  in the way that gets my panties wet. </br>  <br>She'll grow into it.<br>Just like Anna.</br></br>  <br>Would Academia even realize it if I don't shuffle my cards and just arrange them in an order that lets me 1 turn kill them?</br>  <br>no fusions are pretty dumb, you could probably make up a monster effect and say the duel disk is busted and they'll believe you</br>  <br>Just keep synchro summoning, eventually they'll get bored and just wander away.</br>  <br>it took a while but I salvaged it.</br>  <br>Sweet, thanks!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>Genuinely made me angry.<br>Cuckfags need to die.<br><br><br>Ah crap, I'm letting my /b/ out again.</br></br></br></br></br>  I just heard that the shonen jump volume with frightfur tiger in it is out, anyone know when they'll start hitting the secondary market?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>As I write this, my duel monsters cards are on the desk, Gekidan Niagara is on the stereo, and my Yuzu is in another dimension on a date with a guy named Yugo. If it goes like the others, she'll come home in the middle of the night, and tell me about how she and Yugo tag duled against an oppressive seemingly amoral force of no more than three security grad. I won't explode with anger or seethe with resentment. I'll tell her it's a great story and i'm glad she had fun. It's great because she's excited, and I',m glad because I'm a lancer.</br>  <br>guards*</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br> mfw I looked up the full article </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>sincerely made me sick. why did you post that.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br> Paulo <br> o <br>That one letter made it much worse.</br></br></br>  Clear Mind vs Shining Draw. Who wins?  <br>Clear Mind summons Quasar which blows everything out of the water so you tell me</br>  I wish there was a ritual user in the cast. I get to hear Fusion,synchro, xyz and pendulum shokans nearly every episode but only once did I see a ritual summon and it was a shitty loli gag character nobody likes.  <br>ritual summons are useless though</br>  http://challonge.com/tomo11<br><br>time for another animu tourney, this time it's ZEXAL!<br><br> so will Gongenzaka or Crow win?  </br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>And somehow this is less offensive than the gays getting married? Whatever, open marriage sounds like a half assed way of saying they want to date and fuck other people but no so much they are willingly to risk funds and reputation destruction on divorce proceedings.</br>  <br>You need Over Top Clear Mind to summon Quasar, regular Clear Mind just makes Shooting Star. Pretty sure Yuma could Shining Draw a ZW that ups a Hopes attack by half the attack of a monster it battles, and makes it unable to activate effects when its attacked or whatever</br>  <br>But then if he summons Shooting Star, Yuma wont have time to Shining Draw because he will have been hit by 5(3?) Shooting Stars</br>  <br> vampires post banlist <br> It hurts... </br></br>  <br>Yuma summons a Number in defense mode, and Shooting Star cant kill it (since its not a Number). Or when he'd direct attacks for game, Yuma summons Numeron Dragon from his extra</br>  <br> Yuma summons a Number in defense mode, and Shooting Star cant kill it (since its not a Number). <br>Ah yes, the true bullshit that is ZEXAL</br></br>  Whats you're  SHOKAN  theme?  <br> the true bullshit that is ZEXAL <br>except yusei has junk archer and drill warrior.<br><br>besides, yugi managed to beat astral.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  unreleased ridingu duel  <br>theme..isn't that Yugo's theme?</br></br>  <br>I think he meant the Numbers can't be killed by Numbers thing<br><br>That was bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>who summoned nothing but hope.</br>  <br>I'm aware, but yusei has outs to that.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br> just reading that pic tells me alot about the man, dude's a fucking bitch and that woman is a filthy whore. <br><br>i just want an Episode of the best girl and how she goes on in here every day life and the discoveries she comes across like ice cream,cake not undressing in front of other people and finding strong people to become lancers.</br></br></br>  Remember that Shun vs Sora caused Arc-V to get canceled because Siscon man carpet bombed the city. I can't wait to see how they change his attack from Revolution Air Raid.  <br>source?</br>  <br>They will probably re edit that whole scene</br>  <br>It wasn't cancelled, it's because they threw all the budget there.</br>  <br>source fagtron.</br>  <br><br>He doesnt have one.

What you’re referring to as Ruri is in fact, XYZ/Ruri, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, XYZ plus Ruri.

I swore that I will stick to my Steadfast Dueling style no matter what! <br><br> Yuya: That’s going to be pretty difficult, considering that you’re having a Riding Duel with Crow. <br><br> GONGENZAKA: I WON’T EVEN MOVE A STEP, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY! <br><br> Yuya: Then how are you going to perform a Riding Duel? You will have to move… <br><br> GONGENZAKA: WHAT!? NOOOOOOOOO! I’m sorry, FATHERRRRRRRRR! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Gon, if only you can just park the bike from the start.</br>  <br>I just imagine Gon standing still and just wait for Crow to come back to play, it will be a really long duel. Or run like Jose did in 5D</br>  <br>Why would you post fucking Linkara?</br>  <br>All that's left is for Gon to pick up an Action Card to protect Yuya and his father will disown him</br>  <br> Run like Jose <br>If anyone could pull that off, it'd be Gon.</br></br>  <br>John 15:13 anon.....John 15:13</br>  i really cannot imagine Gon using a bike, he is the least character that could ever use one, unless someone rides it for him and he just stands steadily  <br>I remembered that picture and thought it was relevant to this thread</br>  <br>who the fuck is linkara?</br>  <br>some guy who reviews comic books on some shitty website /</br>  <br>disgusting, dude uses a E-Hero deck.</br>  <br> Tsukikage drives Gon's bike, while he stands on the back. <br> Tsukikage drives Reira's bike, while he sits in a sidecar. <br> Tsukikage draws Yuya's bike while he goes YUUUZUUUU </br></br></br>  <br>I find Shinji's design offensively average.

That's like calling Nekroz an Xyz deck solely because they have them when they need them.<br><br>As for AZ, I do run it, that's a rather old list of the cards, but not much has changed other than AZ being in there.</br></br></br>  <br> using a HERO deck with barley any heroes </br>  <br>Sorry but to me that's not HERO deck unless your ED is full of them and you run Miracle Fusion</br>  <br>So a hero deck? <br><br>I don't think you understand how hero decks work, they don't run a lot of monsters.</br></br></br>  <br> No ptolemaus -&gt; infinity bullshit <br>nah not as cancerous</br></br>  Infinity just joined Minerva as an exclusive prize.  <br>Needs more Azathoth</br>  <br>Degenerate cards that need to be banned. Hell I barely use the Xyz the majority of the time anyways.</br>  WHY IS THE NEW BLS SO SHIIT  <br>Because nostalgia a shit</br>  <br>You mean we were suppose to make it good and competitive? Oh...well we'll just create some random new archetype in a few months that'll dominate for a year and call it a day.</br>  <br>It's not shit if you shove it in chaos dragons.</br>  YAMEROOOOO  What is this expression trying to convey?    <br>The pleasure of making ketchup</br>  Who's better skill wise,Judai or Yusei?  <br>i's that feeling when some little faggot who thinks he's hot shit falls and knows something about entertainment falls right into your trap and gets rekt</br>  <br>yusei</br>  <br>Yusei.</br>  <br>I like it.<br>Whenever I see one of those scrubs on DN who hosts a "NO EXTRA DECK" or "NO XYZ/SYNCHRO/PENDULUM" duel I go in with my BLS deck and beat the crap out of him to show them what happens when they try to get an easy win with their bad decks.<br>I used to do it with Monarchs, but they kept ragequitting</br></br></br>  <br>Do you use mini knights + manju/senju?</br>  think the new movie will have xyz and synchro?<br>it's called dark side of dimensions so you could say it takes place in another dimension</br>  <br>Yuma &gt; Yuya &gt; Yusei &gt; Yami &gt; Judai<br><br>Then again we don't know the extent of Zexal's generation ability, or how the power of batshit-mode Yuya works.</br></br></br>  I SET MY SCALES FROM 1 TO 8  <br>I use the Knights and Manju, but not Senju</br>  <br>I can't wait for them to meet. The suffering will be immense.</br>  <br>I SET MY SCALES FROM 1 TO 12</br>  <br>I do something similar, if I see somebody hosting a NO PENDULUM duel, I'll ask them why they don't want Pendulums they'll usually say "they broke the game" or "they're too OP".<br>I then tell them, it's not Pendulum you should fear, but Xyz. I then beat them with Rank 4 spam and mock them for thinking Pendulums are anywhere near as dangerous and degenerate as Xyz</br></br>  Who the fuck designs these posters?  <br>Do you use ptolemaus -&gt; nova -&gt; infinity?</br>  <br>If Gon gets SHS pendulums they better be Scale 1 and Scale 12</br>  <br>But Pendulums and XYZ are so degenerate we're in danger of splitting the earth's crust.<br>And OddEyes.dek is far more deadly than any R4 engine.</br></br>  <br>Pendulum's are fun to use though</br>  <br>Of course, they need to be taught a lesson</br>  <br>Someone at Otomedia, I think.<br>When do we get another one of these, anyway?</br></br>  <br>Exactly, that's my point. I wanted to show those idiots that complaining about Pendulums being "broken" is stupid when Clownblade and Infinity exist, since Pendulums at least are fun and have more variety in their strategies</br>  <br>I find it absurd how many random Level 12's are showing up in Arc V. That number used to be sacred. <br><br>R12 deck when? Railway is nice and all but to wield monsters that are three times the Rank of most XYZ monsters in use, that's how you know you're really the master race.</br></br></br>  <br>Igknights kick Clownblades ass<br> I'm still mad Dragoknight isn't Fire Attribute, that would've made Igknights a whole new league of brutal. </br></br>  <br>The only Rank 12 in existence is the upcoming Number 93 Utopia Kaiser, and he isn't a real Rank 12 since his materials are 2 Numbers of the same rank, not level 12 monsters</br>  <br>I just got that the STAR motif, which appear on buttons here and on her regular jacket, is a pairing to her MOONlight deck.</br>  <br>My favorite is the one with Yuya and Sawatari, but I haven't found a good scan of it.</br>  <br>Holy shit you're not kidding.<br>Surely there are more Hopu's than there are spots in the Extra Deck by now?<br>This is making Heroes look conservative.</br></br></br>  <br>Scale 12 doesn't let you summon level 12 monsters.<br>Also, there really aren't many level 12s in arc-V.</br></br>  <br>They might as well print this son of a bitch by now.</br>  Scale 0 and Scale 13 when  <br> Yuya that high <br> Judai that low <br><br>Judai is one of the few people who should have beat Yugi and has the best drawing and searching skill of any of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Chojiro has a couple L12 Cardians, but they were all made level 2 so it didn't matter.</br>  <br> 1000000 <br><br>Jesus christ Zexal...</br></br></br>  <br>You can't attack other monsters.<br>If you don't declare an attack, you lose the duel. <br>The only way to beat it is to have one of your monsters surpass 100000 Att.<br> And Castel ;^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how it still loses to Castel even though it's crazy overpowered.</br>  <br>If EGAOYuya is losing a duel, he drops the cards and rips his opponents neck. So he's pretty damn powerful.</br>  <br><br> Cannot be Targeted or Destroyed by card effects ;^) <br> Your opponent cannot activate cards during the battle phase ;^) <br> Cannot be banished ;^) <br> If your opponent does not declare an attack, they become your sex slave for life ;^) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me fix this for you.<br><br>Atem &gt; Yusei &gt; Judai &gt; Yugi &gt; Yuya &gt; Yuma</br></br></br>  <br> The opponent cannot use cards or effects <br> This card gains 1000000 ATK for every card in the graveyard, deck, hand, on the field, and those banished <br> Your opponent must attack this card if it is his turn <br> This card can be summoned Turn 1 from your Deck with no special requirements, even on your opponent's turn <br><br>It's balanced and there isn't power creep though guys, I swear!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A nice idea, too bad it's wrong<br>Given the circumstances Atem physically cannot overcome any later deck</br></br>  <br> Requires 5 Level 13 monsters  <br> The previous form, Numerronius, is never printed <br>Nah, it's fine.</br></br></br>  <br>Then that isn't based on skill, it's based on decks. Even then, Atem's deck does a good job of stalling with Marshmallow or whatever given the right circumstances and considering if they all dueled, said script would dictate Atem to win regardless.<br><br>Hell Judai had to lose on purpose just to have Atem win. Based on pure and raw skill Atem is still the best duelist, regardless of their decks, hell Yugi might technically be if we're going with end of DM Yugi. <br><br>There is no way in hell that if they all dueled that Atem would lose to any of them, hell in all likelihood it'd probably be Atem/Yugi &gt; Judai &gt; Yusei &gt; Yuma &gt; Yuya, because the oldest get special privileges.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Arc V's final boss isn't as ridiculous as Don Thousand</br>  <br>Wasn't it Yugi who owned Marshmallon not Atem?</br>  <br>It's basically true. Yuya, despite being such a nice and cheery protagonists, is the one YGO MC most amenable to solving problems with violence.</br>  <br>All the MC's have invincible plot armor.<br>If they fought it would be like having five identical infinite forces/immovable objects smashing together and expecting a fixed result. <br>Or five John Cena's having a simultaneous arm wrestle and expecting one to come out on top.</br></br></br>  <br>Why we still give attention to posts like that.<br><br>obvious /dng/ fag is obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes Yugi is the one who used Marshmallon, either way Yugi is getting the new BLS/Gaia support for the new movie in all likelihood and Atem is likely going to either be using a supped up deck as well or using whatever Johan/Yusei villain uses.</br>  What's the new movie going to be about, anyway?  <br>That would be the case if Judai hadn't lost to Yugi. <br><br>Yugi has the most plot armor, he'll win regardless.</br></br></br>  <br>Spring or Summer of next year.</br>  <br>Are you fucking kidding me? That duel was inconclusive. We never find out if Yugi won or not.<br>Please calm your nostalgia.</br></br>  <br>Yusei<br><br><br>I'd have it:<br>Yusei = Yami &gt; Judai &gt; Yugi &gt; Yuya &gt; Yuma</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's cute! CUTE!</br>  <br>What, not when, I was asking if there is any info on the plot.</br>  <br>Did you forget that Judai attacked Slifer instead of just ending his turn allowing Slifer to go back to the graveyard? <br><br>Judai lost on purpose, it wasn't about winning, it was about getting his love of the game back, which he did. <br><br>Besides it has nothing to do with nostalgia if you seriously don't think the writers would have Yugi win even against Yusei or some shit, and I don't even like Yugi as much as Judai, Yusei, and Yuya, but it's still a fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to expect LITERALLY GOD to be kinda ridiculous.</br>  <br>Sorry, it's 6am and I'm tired. As far as I know, villain resurrects and uses Atem, Kaiba is the main hero and not Yugi, Yugi and Kaiba are probably dueling at the start, flashbacks to Atem here and there, Kaiba/Yugi vs. Villain/Atem in space with D-Gazers.<br><br>That's pretty much it.</br></br></br>  <br>is there a source for that?</br>  <br>I don't have it, but some of it is from the trailer, and I remember reading someone had some info from when they showed it or right before they showed it. Sorry I don't have it.</br>  Well /a/? CHOOSE.  <br>Choose for what?<br>Dueling? <br>Punching? <br>Glueing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya looks like a failed entertainer.<br>Yuri looks like he's trying to hard to appear straight.<br>Yugo looks fine.<br>Yuto looks like he just crawled out of a gay fashion show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya he pulls the cosplay off best, but that's not saying much</br>  <br>Which cosplay works best for each character's associated series rep.<br><br>Yuto-Yuma &gt; Yuya-Yami &gt; Yuri-Yuki &gt; Yugo-Yuse</br></br></br>  <br>Try some mixing up</br>  <br>Alright.</br>  <br>Why is Anna there?</br>  <br>I want to  fuck  Slifer slacker Yuri.</br>  <br>None of those are Yuzu, so they're worthless.</br>  <br><br>Yuya.

Yusei would lose to Yugi, it'd be bullshit, but he'd lose. I mean they don't consider Yugi a legendary duelist for nothing in 5Ds.</br>  <br>Depends on the deck really. I think it'd be better to have Rank 4s made into Rank 5s though.</br>  <br>It would be better they just made some of the generic R4's into R3's or R2's. Just to mix it up a bit.<br>There is no R3 engine for instance.</br></br>  <br> no R3 engine <br>BA sure has one.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, its kinda backwards on how easy rank4 is to make and how literally all of them have very good effects while other ranks are a bit harder to make and their effects tends to be mediocre</br>  I finished Zexal I. It good really good towards the end, but I think Faker got pardoned too easy? He was literally saying that he didn't care about his sons episodes ago and then suddenly he's all "Oh, it was my plan to save Haruto."<br><br>Zexal II looks good.</br></br>    <br>Great taste.

Talk about Yugioh, not how fucking awesome your OC character is</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  Any good structure decks coming out besides those shitty Odd Eyes efforts?  <br> Kaiba <br> mary-sue <br>Are you trying to start a fight?</br></br></br>  <br>Quads confirm Yuzu would kill Yugo the moment he'd make an advance</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  <br>Master of Pendulum is really good though. Syncron Extreme is coming to TCG soon and it's decent</br>  <br>Eh. Updated version of the old emperor deck with a bunch of new emperor support. Could be cool.</br>  <br><br>Yusei is a Mary-sue, not Kaiba.</br></br>  <br>Do we know what's in it? Master of Pendulum I mean, Synchrons can go fuck themselves.</br>  <br> Yusei <br> Mary-sue <br>You do realize when 5ds airing no one knows the possibility of Yusei winning a duel. It's just that intense.</br></br></br>  <br>Hold on, there was an Elemental Hero structure deck a while ago, and now a Synchron one?<br> Does that mean next will be  oh god no  a Hopu deck?</br></br>  <br>The present experience of a series doesn't determine it's value, retrospect does. And Yusei did nothing wrong, ever. That's the problem.<br><br>We'll probably look back on Arc V and notice all of its glaring flaws once the hype dies down, but whether it still holds up despite that will determine its long-term value.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Why do you think they arrive late at the cup?  Because they had a warming night. </br></br></br>  <br>Probably a syllable deck with shit like gagagas in it.</br>  <br>Then what about that time Yusei brooding over something before Jack punched him?</br>  <br>Not really. It became really clear after the Team Unicorn duel that Yusei was never going to lose</br>  <br>Nah, it's because Yuzu walked in on him rubbing one out and locked herself in the other room out of shock and disgust. By the time he'd apologized and coaxed her out, they were late.<br>Yugo is beta as fuck.</br></br>  <br>I hope you get absorbed.</br>  <br>That's just Jack being fucking great. I'm actually really glad that he's the one they brought back.</br>  <br>Aki is still best girl.</br>  <br>Still doesn't change the fact that Yusei need emotional support.</br>  <br>Even before the WRGP began I knew Yusei would never lose a duel.</br>  <br>It sucks because Jack  as well as that blue haired secretary girl, she was nice  got a raw deal as far as character development goes. Yes he was proud of his power, and went to harsh lengths to prove it, but you have to appreciate his drive. I actually wanted him to defeat Yusei at the end, just to prove he had the capacity to achieve the greatness he'd always strived for. It's the Vegeta/Goku thing all over.</br>  <br>I have a feeling they noticed their mistake. They've been mixing up Yuma and Yuya's win/loss ratios a lot.</br>  <br><br>That's because he believe in his cards.</br></br>  <br>Someone needs to make Yugo naked in this.</br>  Holy shit I just was watching ZEXAL and when I come to this part I saw something, then went to wiki and realized it was Tiras and Garlandolg. Does anime-exclusive cards can create lores? Because I for sure never expected a card with a Ritual monster from 5Ds era battling a Xyz monster from ZEXAL era.  <br>Everyone in Yugioh believes in their cards, that's why they seek to make themselves stronger rather than just get better ones.<br>Yusei was too perfect for his own good; he was one of the few flaws in 5ds, but the fact he was the prime focus meant it was a major one.</br></br>  <br>It's funny when you consider it's effect and the image on that card, pretty fitting  for trash monsters </br>  <br>Holy crap, you've gotten that far into Zexal since your last post? <br> You are just tearing through this series.</br></br>  <br>It's okay Yuya, Yuzu's the only one for you.  I mean, it's only that one night. </br>  <br>Yusei also make himself stronger. It's like Atem dueling except he's more believable.</br>  <br>No, I am not that anon, I am watching ZEXAL because it may help me to understand some things on Arc-V. But after watching this part, I was wondering if anime can create lore for monsters too.</br>  <br>Wat<br>Eww<br>No</br></br></br>  No Ruris next week. Himika makes a voiced appearance though, presumably as a flashback.<br><br>Also when the Tsukikage vs Shinji is announced, it's seems like it says it's going according to Reiji's expectations or something similar to that. Possibly Tsukikage driving the D-Wheel while Reira duels?</br></br>  <br>Atem was an actual dueling king. Yusei was from a cave with a box of scraps. He had no reason to be great at all. And he found his cards in other people's garbage. How is that believable?</br>  <br>Not exactly what you asked for, but I know everyone here will appreciate it, especially Yuya.</br>  <br> hanase <br>I want to fuck Yuzu's voice every time I hear her.</br></br>  <br>As far as I know, anime-exclusive cards are that, anime-exclusive cards.<br>Unless Konami want to print them and create lores, which btw, until now only the print part happened.</br></br>  <br>遊戯王ＡＲＣ－Ｖ「シティの光と影」<br>2015年8月2日(日) 17時30分～18時00分<br>放送日<br>互いの心が通じ合い、観客を熱狂させたクロウVS権現坂のデュエル。その時<wbr>、遊矢の部屋を徳松が訪れ、フレンドシップカップで敗北したデュエリストの<wbr>行方を語り始める…。<br><br>あらすじ<br>互いの心が通じ合い、観客を熱狂させたクロウVS権現坂のデュエル。その時<wbr>、遊矢の部屋をあの徳松が訪れ、フレンドシップカップで敗北したデュエリス<wbr>トの行方を語り始める…。一方、デュエルパレスでは、次の対戦カードのアナ<wbr>ウンスが始まる。名前を呼ばれたデュエリストはシンジと月影…！そこには零<wbr>児のある思惑が…。<br><br>声の出演<br>榊遊矢：小野賢章、徳松：咲野俊介、沢渡シンゴ：矢野奨吾、月影：坂巻学、<wbr>シンジ：石川界人、ナレーション：山路和弘<br><br>声の出演続き<br>赤馬零児：細谷佳正、零羅：石川由依、赤馬日美香：藤本喜久子、ゲール：拝<wbr>真之介、アスール：田中杏沙、グレイ：野川雅史、メリッサ・クレール：平田<wbr>裕香、サム：高瀬朝季、古川慎、野上翔<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128542440#p128569915">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, before Atem was dueling king, there should be time when he's from cave with a box of scaps.<br><br>And now after Yusei was froma cave with abox of scraps, he's becaming a king.<br><br>Pretty believeable, based on what you said.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sawatari's probably just gonna make comments on Gon and Crow's duel if he's watching it.</br>  <br>All according to keikaku anon</br>  Are we ready for some rape?  <br>Can't find episode 3<br><br>i have no idea why but best girl's design is very memorable for me.

A good example of this is of course Prohibition in the good ole US of A, where outlawing alcohol not only had the effect of INCREASING alcohol consumption, but also creating a massive criminal underground, and an entire counterculture that brought about a lot of social change.<br><br>Japan's method's in Shimoneta are more draconian, and therefor somewhat more effective, but they're having roughly the same effect, creating a criminal underground and counterculture that thrive on the illegal pornography. Of course the ban on lewdness in any form has another effect. Due the apparent lack of comprehensive sex ed, the Japan in Shimoneta is essentially raising an entire generation of adults that will have no clue what they're doing when it comes to procreation. This will have a few probable effects: Couples will have no idea how sex control works, so rampant pregnancies and confusion will follow. Couples will have no idea sex is even a thing, and will go their entire lives with out doing the act, and/or they will go about doing it wrong and never have kids. Lastly, you'll have couples going to underground or criminal sources for information on sex, both breaking down the very public moral that Japan is trying to enforce, and increasing crime where none existed before.<br><br>I don't know why I put so much though into the setting and repercussions of a what is essentially a gag show, but it sure it fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We wish we knew. The LN hasn't been translated while the manga only has 2 chapters translated. The only part of the LN that was translated was the love honey cookies scene. Hopefully some kind anon will work on it.  ;_; </br>  <br>Well it is a gag show, but it kinda takes itself seriously when explaining the repercussions it would have. Until Kajou throws in a random dirty joke out of nowhere that is.</br>  <br>I have no real basis for this but I don't think the pregnancy is going to be an issue.<br>Menstruation would cause way too many questions can't be answered without setting off the chokers so I think they probably give the females hormones/ birth control to prevent it. Granted I'm not a girl but it's really not hard to believe that suddenly bleeding from your crotch for days when you have no idea wtf is going on will cause freakouts.<br>There's just no plausible way i can think of for it to be explained to teenage girls without getting carted off to jail.<br>In essence we now have a generation that's essentially going to be sterile.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There are similar problems to countries today which don't have comprehensive sex education. Basically people getting married or into relationships and having no idea what to do next.<br><br>Unwanted pregnancies, STDs spreading rampantly, general ignorance and superstition, or even insane cases like that one woman who used the wrong hole for 40 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting for Hiryuu subs.</br>  <br><br> "Tonight's special: A thick, steamy wiener. Enjoy, sir." </br></br>  <br> I think they probably give the females hormones/ birth control to prevent it <br>I highly doubt it given Japans population issues, also this wouldn't be the first time women would be in an environment where menstruation couldn't be adequately explained. When there's a lack of actual knowledge on something, people tend to just make shit up. I wouldn't be overly surprised to find that parents or educators, lacking the ability to properly explain the process, use overly vague terms, or stupid shit like "it's the lewdness/bad thoughts/devil, draining out" or "it's just something that happens to everyone, don't worry about it".</br></br>  <br> I don't know why I put so much though into the setting and repercussions of a what is essentially a gag show, but it sure it fun. <br>That's the thing, many shows that seem to be just gag shows with a ridiculous premise are actually engaging in some social commentary. This has plenty of it, Humanity Has Declined had plenty of it, Excel Saga had a shitload of it...</br></br>  <br><br><br>Your dicks, sir.</br></br></br>  <br><br> so rampant pregnancies and confusion will follow. <br> rampant pregnancies <br><br>This is Japan, after all. Perhaps this is the actual goal, to increase the number of pregnancies for the sake of Japan's future.</br></br></br></br></br>  So who's getting rape?  <br>The problem with that is that, when people don't know how pregnancies work, it can lead to a lot of problems. Bad care of the fetus, improper timing that makes life loads more difficult, plus on top of that with out knowing about birth control, after you've figured out the whole baby making bit, your either going to be pumping out so many kids it's going to affect your economic standing, leading to an overall increase in poverty, or you'll have people just abstaining from sex, putting a strain on marriages and potentially leading to an increase in divorces or spousal abuse/infidelity, thus creating a breakdown in public morals. <br><br>The system is almost designed to rip itself apart given enough time, and cause some serious damage to Japanese society.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is the black one the biggest? There is some mistake here waiter.</br>  <br>Everyone.</br>  <br>MC is getting raped</br>   yfw Clawhammer gets episode 4 out before Hiryuu gets episode 3 out     I detect a very high lewdness from the girl with the permablush that sits next to MC.  <br><br> hiryuu </br></br>  <br>You're not the only one.</br>  <br><br> Anna's ass <br> Kajo's ass <br><br>Which one first?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't need to teach anyone how to procreate. Animals get by just fine without a class and so can humans. Literal retards understand how to put penis in vagina and cumming is natural so a baby eventually happens.</br>  <br> implying Kajo won't do your ass first </br>  <br>Animals have better instincts than humans. Literal retards are at least exposed to the concepts involved, rather than being entirely shielded from them. Someone who's never even heard about what's involved could feasibly not work out for themselves that this goes in that until this happens. Sure, many will get there via trial and error, but not 100% of people.</br>  <br>Considering Kajo's libertine mindset she probably makes an effort to never wipe her ass leaving an old and crusty layer of shit surrounding her anus. <br><br>Just like that judge in the nights of sodom.</br></br></br>  <br>Anna has the bigger ass.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128551375 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128551581 <br><br>Get this normal shit out of here</br></br></br>  <br>Wut</br>    <br>yeah same</br>    <br>What manga</br>    <br>Well that couple pissed away their chance of having kids.</br>  <br>The design looks like MATRA Milan but idk which of his work.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VGg<wbr>_HTls8ME</wbr>  [ ]</br>  New episode when?

So yeah, it might have something to do with it.<br><br>I'm actually surprised that they aren't just storing sperms and eggs, and then sterilize citizens after procuring their potential offspring. They went through all that trouble but still not doing it. Afterwards the sperms and eggs will be analyzed if there are some decent possible DNAs in it.

Jupiter though, is a bit gassy. She needs to lay off the doughnuts.</br>  <br>Any chance to see Ami with a funny face is always a plus in my book.</br>  <br>You added an extra S anon<br><br>Also All girls are acceptable as best <br>but mars and mercury are def at the top</br></br></br></br>  <br> mars and mercury are def at the top <br>Mars does nothing for me.</br></br>  Minako is the most fun, and therefore best girl.  <br>Makoto is the best cook, is the tallest and therefore most suitable for comfortable kissing, and can back you up in a fight.<br><br>Makoto is best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Thats okay all are acceptable faves <br>(jupiter is popular but does nothing for me )</br></br>  <br><br>They all go through a period of popularity every few years. Setsuna is currently getting a bit of attention in the west thanks to Crystal miraculously not fucking her over and other obvious reasons.</br></br>  I'm having so much fun watching the series. I'm loving S but I know Chibi-usa will be back any minute now to ruin it all...    Just look at that superb facial structure.  <br>It's an abstract sort of anatomy.</br>  <br><br> Still using that in-between frame from a Shida animation that's entirely on ones <br><br>At least use a key frame that wasn't fixed on the Blu Rays. Crystal is shit, and you autists are just one of the many reasons it's that way.</br></br></br></br>      <br><br>S is way better, but SuperS is criminally underrated and absolutely nails how slice of life ought to be done.</br></br>    <br>I still haven't seen this yet because there are so many episodes. It looks infinitely better than Crystal, but I don't know if I'm up for the whole series. Should I just watch it all or is there a list of episodes I should watch/skip?</br>  <br>watch it all you fucking reddit faggot.<br>what, you have a "life" so you can't watch all the episodes of a children's magical girl anime? fuck off then you normie shit</br></br>  <br> Should I just watch it all or is there a list of episodes I should watch/skip? <br><br>I would seriously recommend that you watch the vast majority of the episodes, but skip the select few episodes that are genuinely awful and/or fuck up the flow of the series. Don't trust any of the existing episode lists, they all skip great shit that you should watch (any list that tells you to skip ep 6 is instantly garbage).<br><br>Watching the original in Japanese, skip eps 7, 20, 67 and 127. There are a bunch more episodes that I'd recommend to avoid which are skip-able safely, but these ones are real doosies that come in at times you'll least want them and are near universally hated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> mfw the toku really didn't suck and was a decent adaptation on its own </br></br>  <br>No. Watch it all. Skip absolutely nothing. You'll love every bit of it, especially if it happens to be a focus episode for your favorite girl.</br>  <br>I was an Amifag as a kid but but had a crushing realization after rewatching (Viz dub) that I can never satisfy her intellectually, and can safely say I've been converted to the Church of Makoto.<br><br>She is love.</br></br></br>  Does sailor moon get any better action &amp; story wise? I'm watching the japanese dub and i'm on episode 36 Usagi's fighting a barber. Lastly, was anyone else disappointed by both the japanese and english voice actors?  <br><br>Also are there any episodes I can skip?</br></br>  <br> action <br>Outside of a handful of episodes, no, SM in no a series you watch for action.<br><br> story wise <br>The series has some of the best plot lines in all anime. If by this you mean does it keep being a monster of the week show, it all ways falls back on that whenever it needs filler.<br><br> Usagi's fighting a barber <br>You're about to go through some of the worst episodes like that, especially so when this season end. Trust me when I say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that you will be rewarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already went over that here. <br>There are other episodes you can skip, but these are the only ones that I can say you should wholeheartedly and with good reason.</br></br>  can we get some love for best girl please  I like Utena more  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>They're both masterpieces so let's not start a fight.</br>        Who is your favorite non-senshi character? <br><br>I love Naru. She is so sweet and I feel bad for her always getting attacked by the monster of the day.</br></br>  <br><br>It's funny with Sailor Moon. I originally thought the old anime sucked and was thinking Crystal was going to be the perfect reboot. Then I watched Crystal that sucked so i gave the original a watch and its now one of my favourite series ever.....</br></br>  <br>The one where Luna is in heat is really funny.</br>  <br>Do villains count? I always liked Ali and Ann, plus their youmas and their way of summoning them was really cool.<br><br>The fact that this whole arc was made exclusively for the anime further demonstrates what kind of artistic talent the original series had, that in crystal is completely absent:p</br></br></br>  <br>Professor Tomoe. At least the anime version. So hammy and over the top.<br><br><br>It may be filler, but the Makaiju/Doom Tree arc has one of my all time favorite episodes. The one where Makoto tries to woo Ali, thinking him to be the Moonlight Knight. Goofy faces all over the places, plus even the bad guys get a heartwarming ending of sorts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Doom Tree arc was great! I was shocked when I found out it was exclusive anime filter. But like you said, shows how much creativity the original series had.<br><br><br>The heartwarming ending didn't even feel cheesy to me. Ail and Ann explain how their human crushes could never love them as Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask get blasted. It was nice that they finally realized what it means to love someone.<br><br>I personally preferred Ail because he just wanted to have fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Sure!</br>    <br>Her name is literally SAILOR Iron Mouse. She's a senshi.</br>      <br>Im on the 4th episode of R, are there any <br>Mina-chan episodes this season?</br></br>  <br>You're two episodes away from one, plus she gets a hilarious one about halfway through the Black Moon Clan arc.</br>          Rei's VA in the new Viz dub does a nice job singing a rendition of Eien no Melody closer to the Japanese lyrics, as opposed to the old DiC version which had completely different ones.<br><br>http://webm.host/accd8/vid.webm</br></br>  <br>Yuichiro<br>mostly because I really like Mars.<br><br>Was he even in the manga or Crystal at all, or was that something they made up for the original series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The latter. <br><br> dat sad moment when you can't unhear the surfer voice they gave him in the old dub </br></br></br>  From the new Skrillex vid  <br>Thats what I figured, oh well.<br><br>The little bit of the manga I read shows her grandpa completely different too.</br></br></br>  <br>I too like Rei a lot, however, this dude gets on my nerves... I guess it's because he's mostly a good for nothing and they just make Rei "fall for him" by magic. <br><br>He still looked really badass in that episode where he wants to beat the shit out of Haruka.</br></br></br>  <br> mostly a good for nothing <br>He works hard, and is only at the shrine to better himself in the first place.<br>His heart is constantly in the right place, he's a noble idiot.<br>Rei notices that, and appreciates it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> grandpa completely different too  <br>How so? Is he not a crazy panty-chaser? <br><br><br>Ah I just watched that episode. It made me sort of mad that he just jumped to conclusions but I guess that's just the kind of guy he is. It makes me lol though at how pretty much all the girls have fallen for Haruka at one point. The episode where Makoto becomes infatuated with her actually ended up being really sweet because I saw it as Makoto looking up to Haruka as a role model. <br><br> pic related was 2kawaii4me </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Stars doesnt seem that bad so far, though the Seiya x Usagi stuff is pretty shitty    <br>Stars is best season.</br>  <br> is the tallest <br><br>Isn't Makoto still under 6 feet tall? I mean she's tall for a Japanese lady but she's still short by american standards.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm watching the japanese dub <br> japanese dub </br></br>  <br><br>First season best season</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Cu<wbr>A1ov1-Pk</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eh6<wbr>EStbsO3Y</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Holy shit you have shit taste. Kill yourself immediately</br>  <br>He's not incorrect, you faggot. It was dubbed in Japanese.</br>  <br>Japan is silly</br>  <br>Jupiter is like 5'6" (tall for a Japanese middle school girl) Uranus is the tallest</br>  <br>The Sailor Moon musicals have some of the best improve. Tuxedo Mask gives one of the villains shit and demands to know why he's so familiar, and he played like, five other characters in the show, and did their voices. And one of Beryl's minions and Usagi talk about how Beryl hasn't changed her clothes in thirty years.</br>  <br>The fangirls ignore Yuichiro and prefer to ship Rei with Zoicite, that white haired faggot from the starlights or other senshi because he isn't a 10/10 alpha male but a "relatable" character from the male audience</br>  <br>I totally forgot how weird the artsyle they used was.</br>  <br>A dub would imply voices recorded over other original voices. Which is not the case.</br>  <br>The only characters more alpha than Yuichiro are Haruka, and Rei herself.</br>  <br> Jupiter is like 5'6" <br><br>God so even tho she's supposed to be tall as shit, I still dwarf the shit out of her at 6'0".</br></br></br>  <br>Females disagree</br>  <br>I wish that they didnt</br>  <br> A dub would imply voices recorded over other original voices <br>No. It only implies voices recorded as a separate track and mixed in with any other sound after the fact. There is no requirement for an original voice track.</br></br>  <br>No one uses "dub" in that context. Whenever anyone says dub they mean recorded lines of another language meant to replace lines of a language unknown to people of another country.<br> Or they mean repeating digits </br></br>  Rei has only one husbando  <br>Isnt it more like Rei is Ikuhara's waifu?</br>  <br><br> Ikuhara sleeps hugging his Rei's dakimura <br> Anno sleeps hugging his Ikuhara's dakimura <br> Moyocco sleeps hugging her Kawoshin's dakimura <br>Advance pottery</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just watch the whole show. The first season is arguably the best and should hook you right away. And even if you can't get behind crazy monster arcs, the real focus of the show is on the slice of life/daily life of the girls. Which this show is one of the few to do it well.<br><br>Also, endless reaction images every episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you can't get into the Japanese voices for Sailor Moon, I honestly don't think you'll get into the series. It has some of the best seiyuu for its time. About the only big name seiyuu from the 90s that wasn't a main character in the series was Megumi Hayashibara. And even she got a role in one of the movies.</br></br>  <br><br>Stars is the second best season in my opinion. With one of the best endings in anime as a whole. Two endings if you count the opening arc that adds to Sailor Moon SS.</br></br>  Is there a torrent out there for all 200 episodes with english subs?  <br>There pretty obviously is.<br>Multiple really</br></br>  <br>Check Pirate Bay. I was able to get all 200 in glorious nipponese but there were many more engrish torrents available.</br>  <br> many more engrish torrents available <br><br>Yeah that's exactly what I DON'T want.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit. My bad I read it as "dubs", not "subs." Anyway, the torrent I got from there has all 200 with English subs. It took a while to download since there aren't many seeders but it's worth it. I really recommend getting a different torrent for season one from the intro of Makato episode to about 10 episodes later though. The video quality of those episodes were garbage and the translations were too literal ("me destroy you" instead of "I will destroy you").</br>  <br><br><br><br>Is this some crossboarding memeing going on or is this 2000 and noone knows how to get shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I literally just woke up yesterday from a coma I've been in for 15 years.<br>Give me a break.</br></br>  <br>The solution for  is to watch the show in the Latin dub.  Yes, Mexican dub hater guy, if you are here, kindly stick to yourself. <br><br>That beign said, the series otherwise has a mix of some the the best, and most awkward voice acting in any anime series you will find.</br></br></br>  <br> mexican dub <br><br>Why do you guys always think your shit doesn't stink?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering the mexican dub is based on the Japanese voices, I don't see how that will fix his problem.<br><br>The Mexican dub of Sailor Moon is indeed one of the few good examples of dubbing I have ever witnessed. But the original voices are still the best.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Its true.<br>I fell into the coma in 2000 upon watching Serial Project Lain for the first time and it was so awful and boring my brain shut down for 15 years.</br></br>  <br>Ahh, he appears again.<br><br><br> Considering the Mexican dub is based on the Japanese voices I don't see how that will fix his problem <br><br>That's only partly true though. One of the reasons the Mexican dub is good is that it takes influence from several dubs (including the DiC English dub and the prior Spanish dub, along with the Japanese) tries to pick and chose the best way to play each character and deliberately tones down the more annoying ones.<br><br>That's precisely why I feel it should be recommended to people who find the acting in other dubs/adaptations to be off-putting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not whatever boogieman you're talking about.<br>I don't just hate mexican dubs. I hate ALL dubs.</br></br>  <br> That's precisely why I feel it should be recommended to people who find the acting in other dubs/adaptations to be off-putting. <br><br>What if they don't speak spanish?<br>You're actually recommending that people watch a spanish dub with english subtitles?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Unless they speak Spanish as their native tongue, watching a Spanish dub is just as abrasive as watching the original Japanese voices. It would be better for him to just get over the differences of Japanese voices. Since a lot of anime will never be dubbed into other languages, getting use to Japanese voices is really necessary to enjoy anime to its fullest.</br></br>  <br> watching a Spanish dub is just as abrasive as watching the original Japanese voices. <br>In this case, not really, as the Mexican softens some of the harsher voices (the original Spanish dub is more accurate to the Japanese, and retains the abrasive qualities).<br><br> You're actually recommending that people watch a spanish dub with english subtitles? <br>If they really can't stand the Jap voices, I see no reason not to give it a shot in this specific case. Its going to be a foreign language to them either way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fascinating</br>  <br>Is there a reason they changed it for the last season, like a huge swap in production personnel or something?<br>They changed the OP for the first time too, which is crazy when you think how iconic the orignal one is</br></br>  <br><br>They pretty much had a whole new team working on the last season. As well as the beginnings of digital aids and a lot higher budget.<br><br>The style also changed when Mr Fabulous took over in the last half of Sailor Moon R (and really changed with the movies). It just wasn't as drastic of a change as Sailor Moon Stars.</br></br></br></br>  <br>0:00 - 2:22 was the best part.</br>  <br> I see no reason not to give it a shot in this specific case <br><br>Except are there actually groups out there that produce english subs for mexican dubbed anime?<br>I mean who would do that?</br></br></br></br>        <br> me not that kind of orc <br> D'want ax? <br> me busy, leave me alone <br>works fine for me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Updated my journal.</br>  Best Sailor Moon villain?  <br>Jupiter is mai waifu</br>  <br>Mistress 9, or the Doom Tree aliens.<br><br>Mimette is the most memorable though</br></br></br>  <br>Black Lady got my dick really hard</br>  <br>Doom tree.<br><br>Jadeite was hilarious too.</br></br></br>      Glorious  <br> Dat grain </br>  <br>Does Ranma Saotome count?</br>  Explain to me in excruciating detail why Minako-chan is so fucking rad and cute and sexy.  <br> happens to be a focus episode for your favorite girl. <br>So how many episodes shipping Mercury with Jupiter then?</br></br>  <br><br>I would suck god knows how many dicks for someone can put subs and the Viz dub to those raws. The BDs/DVDs are saturated, DNRed (but not completely), have cases of ghosting in the first season eps (in the recently released first half of the R set, that part's gone at least), and are generally awful looking.</br></br>  <br> The BDs/DVDs are saturated <br>Which region?</br></br>  <br>R1</br>  <br>Seiya x Usagi is pure cancer. It seems Toei execs thought Usagi needed a love interest after Mamoru's departure because this is a girls show and girls only care about romance, amirite. Apparently Usagi having an extreme case of PSTD after Mamoru's death like in the manga wasn't enough drama for Toei, she needed a shemale after her cunt.<br><br><br>The ratings sunk on Stars so the nips weren't pleased with the changes. What a year, Toei saw 2 of their biggest franchises ever (Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon) crash and burn pratically at the same time (GT and Stars)<br><br><br>It wasn't a new team, it was the Team B. Later Honey Flash was made by the SM's Team C</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> apparently Usagi having an extreme case of PSTD after Mamoru's death like in the manga wasn't enough drama for Toei, she needed a shemale after her cunt. <br> I figured the fireball hitting the plane was just misdirection, and he was going to show up in the end to save her or something. Are you seriously saying he dies for good in both the anime and manga? I thought the first season dealt with that enough </br></br>  <br> Sorry for the spoilers </br>  <br> Its my own fault, really </br>  10 hours until the anticipated baseball game. Who is going to get lucky?  Key wouldn't be key without shitty baseball filler  <br>I want to run the bases with Nao.</br>  <br>I dunno, she could probably steal bases pretty easily by just going invisible to the pitcher.</br>  is it time?  <br>Teleport-kun is presumably the god of base-stealing.</br>  I'm ready for more nao chan  <br>good luck staying on base. he'd be great at taking home though.</br>  <br>Can't you sub in runners a certain number of times a game or something?

Fuck you, Fukuda.</br></br>  <br>wtf is this Barbie and ken shit</br>  Isn't this a copy paste of the sex scene between Kira and Fllay?  <br>That's terrible.

I still fucking love it even now. I still think about Cross Ange RIGHT NOW. It is a glorious anime that everyone on /a/ needs to watch.</br></br>  <br> 12 HOURS. <br>Poor Embryo</br></br>  <br>I wonder how detailed Salia's books were.</br>  <br>ruggarell pls go and take your shit taste somewhere else</br>  <br>But anon, I've watched more anime than you why would I care what you think about the best anime of 2014 aka Cross Ange?</br>  <br>She reads some manga called Twinkle Candy wich feature a magical girl who's ultimate costume is a naked apron. She also read love stories, and other stuff with magical girls.</br>  <br> lowlife ninja <br> 12 hours of sexual pleasure followed by THREE DAYS THREE NIGHTS of sex <br> supreme being and gentleman <br> only got the tip in <br>He got fucked real hard</br></br></br></br></br>  Pomf. What are we going to do on the bed, Tusk?  <br>Of course he did, after all Tusk is Fukuda self-insert with ninja powers which no other mortal can have, if a character is a favourite of the producer behind the show it really ruins the series for me and sadly Tusk was the most boring thing about Cross Ange.<br><br>I really thought Fukuda had some decency to kill him off in that suicide attack just for a while, but of course it didn't even last one episode.<br><br>Fuck you Fukuda for all the Ange x Sala baiting montage, fuck you Fukuda for making 2nd part of the series some idiotic male self-insert dream, fuck you Fukuda for not giving Hilda a happy ending with someone she deserves than being just Ange fucktoy when she is bored of Tusk and wants to have a little diversity, and finally the biggest fuck for the shit quality which looks even worse in BD release..<br><br>Just fuck you Fukuda cause this show with such VA cast could be a masterpiece than a poor sex joke it really was, which BDs pretty much confirm how poor it was..</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah, /u/ tears. So delicious.</br></br>    Zoro took 100 times more damage than this at thriller bark and didn't lose his memories. Just sayin'.   Sabo has now left <br>Another sideplot wrapped up.<br><br>So, will there be time for partying or are we gonna wrap up this Mam bullshit now before heading on to Zou arc?</br></br></br>  Zoro is admiral level to be fair.  <br>Zoro also wasn't 12 at Thriller Bark.</br>  <br>If you actually think it depends on how much damage you take if you get amnesia or not than you are truly the biggest retard ever</br>  <br>Luffy isn't retarded enough to party while half his fucking crew is potentially fighting a Yonko. What the fuck have you been reading ?</br>  <br>the what does it take you autist?<br><br><br> hurr durr only children can get amnesia  <br>Retard</br></br></br></br></br>  Just don't reply to OP. Think of a proper discussion or just keep making new threads until the mods gets pissed.  What the fucking shit?<br><br>Like<br><br>What</br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 TL Note</br>  <br>On my phone, can't read the filename.</br>  <br>translators note - i did not translate this</br>  <br> the what does it take you autist? <br>Not that anon, but Zoro did not suffer any severe damage to his head, normally a heavy concussion can lead to memory loss. Oh and he did not almost drown on top of it all which also can lead to amnesia because your brain does not get enough oxygen and countless cells are dying. But you are baiting anyway so I don't know why I am even replying to you.</br></br>  <br> so I don't know why I am even replying to you. <br>So don't. Stop the cycle. Don't reply to this either. Start a discussion instead.</br></br>    <br> I don't understand anything; The post. </br>  <br>OP BTFO<br>P<br>B<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn, people are obsessed with Sabo. Must be a lot more popular than I thought he was.  <br>Fuckin' kekked hard. Thanks Anon.</br>  <br>Is this by the same guy who made that Madmax fanart in Odas style?</br>  <br>It been a whole night since Big Mom confronted them. Likely they already dealt with her. Nami probably showed her the card she got from Lola and now they are cool.</br>  <br>Well, what does it mean?</br>  <br>He's pretty cool, at least according to the target demographic. He's got fire, which is edgy but not 'Cold Steele the Hedgehog' edgy. He has an interesting character design, he's Luffys brother, and a badass with the revolutionary army. It's only natural for him to be popular.</br>  <br> Not that anon, but Zoro did not suffer any severe damage to his head <br>Baseless assumption. Literally nothing suggests that the damage Kuma gave him was limited to his body minus his head. Also Usopp took more damage to the head than Sabo did.</br></br>  <br>Looks like Fairy Tail.</br>  <br> trolls getting more and more desperate <br>No wonder why most of /a/ defend One Piece.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't seem like the type to forgive transgressions so easily.</br>  <br>But did Usopp also drown?</br>  What's with all these Sabo hate thread lately??  friendly reminder that he's the current 7th shichibukai member right now  <br> still trying <br>Don't be such a sore loser and stop embarrassing yourself any further.</br></br>  <br>Maybe. Maybe not. Luffy would have no idea unless Sanji calls back, which hasn't happened yet. As far as Luffy is concerned, half his crew is fighting the fight of their lives.</br>  <br>They are made by a single autist who is trying to start some epic new meme but gets BTFO'd constantly. Funny at first but now it got quite boring tbh</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>It's literally one person. He's probably the guy who posts the "women can't use haki" bait.</br>  I think the real question on everybody's mind is, how would Law or Kidd have gone against Lucci pre-timeskip? Their fruits are better, but could they have kept up with Lucci's speed and power and not simply gotten speed blitzed?  <br>Some troll who hates One Piece and trying to make it bad despite it still being coherent. I bet he is a Narutard butthurt that Tobi being Obito having survived his apparent death during a flashback without foreshadowing and it doesn't make sense he joined Madara as a villain.</br>  <br> Baseless assumption <br>Not really. Zoro only felt the pain  of Sabos and Isshos victory  and did not receive any direct hits to his head, body or anything else.</br></br>  <br><br>just wow<br><br><br><br>this is literally my first thread about this. Why are you so autistic about people not liking your favorite character?<br><br> He's probably the guy who posts the "women can't use haki" bait. <br>Of course, also I'm Rebeccafag, every single tripfag, all the Fujos and the Trapfag. There is literally only me and you in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, 12 year old Sabo was just the weakest little shit. What a pleb. At least he didn't die from a mere gun shot wound like Corazon and Bellemere amirite? Kek weaklings.<br><br> Is that seriously your gripe with this shit? Can we move on now? </br></br></br>  <br>sure son, sure</br>  <br>His body after receving luffy's pain when sanji found him proved that his whole body got damaged.<br><br><br>fuck off you narutofaggot<br><br><br><br>retards</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looks gay as fuck</br>  <br> His body after receving luffy's pain when sanji found him proved that his whole body got damaged. <br>Oh, so you assume feeling a lot of pain is equal to a heavy hit to the head and also can cause amnesia? You are a retard and you post like a 12 year old. Stop.</br></br>  I made Vergo a strawhat  <br> Oh, so you assume feeling a lot of pain is equal to a heavy hit to the head <br>YES, you fucking idiot. Just compare how Zoro looked when he told Kuma to give him teh damage and how he looked when Sanji found him.</br></br>  <br>Sabo was a child</br>  <br>No, you stop you fucking child. Stop replying to obvious bait, for fuck's sake. Just. Stop. It is Not that hard. Just don't fucking reply. How fucking hard is that ?</br>  <br> YES, you fucking idiot <br>Then you really are a retard whithout a shred of medical knowledge. As I said, just stop.</br></br>  <br>Law is likely to be the first openly gay man in One Piece. No hetro man dress or have tats like that.</br>  <br>Fucking. Is this the birth of Sabofag? <br><br> An obsession with a particular character <br> Same bulk reply style <br> Rebeccafag at least puts effort into his shitposts. Doesn't matter, still the same.  <br>Literal Rebeccafag 2.0 ! This is almost like poetry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  STOP REPLYING TO HIM YOU AUTISTIC CUNTS. DEVELOP YOUR FUCKING 12 YEAR OLD BRAINS AND STOP GIVING HIM ATTENTION.  Lets take a short break from shitposting and baiting and discuss why Sadi-chan makes my dick so hard  <br>kill yourself<br><br><br> There is only a single guy not liking sabo <br>Look at all the threads before this one you faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Look at all the threads I made before this one you faggot  <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>That's beautiful. C-can I request a Croc version of this?</br>  <br> implying Domino isn't best Impel girl </br>  <br>Zorofag are delusional</br>  <br>Cause she's hot as fuck. Something about not seeing her full face makes her hotter. Same with Fem-Killer. Also, her VA in the anime id pretty good too.</br>  <br> being this insecure <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Thanks. D-do you have a Croc pic you'd like me to use?</br>  <br>Don't drag our good name to the ground because of one guy.</br>  <br> kill yourself xd <br>you sound like a parrot</br></br>  <br>Do i see pepperonis in that picture?</br>  <br>and you seem to be a faggot, so what's the point? Discuss op or fuck off.</br>  <br>CHECKED</br>  <br>H-how about this one?</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br> Something about not seeing her full face makes her hotter <br>hmmm, but seeing her eyes is not that bad either</br></br>  <br> There is only a single guy not liking sabo <br>I'm actually suggesting the complete opposite, Sabofag. I'm suggesting that you have a raging homolust for this character <br><br>There are also a lot of faggots that hate Rebecca too. But none are as obsessed with each respective character as you and Rebeccafag are. You can't move on even if he's given a plausible, coherent backstory that leaves no plotholes, a touching reunion with his brother, in an arc that best fits his amnesia theme. You're upset because he wasn't treated with the utmost perfect care and wasn't given the most mindblowing backstory in all of one piece. If you feel this offended about a kid getting amnesia after getting hit by a fucking canon, admit it, you are literally obsessed with his character.</br></br></br></br>  <br> openly gay <br>I wish. He's definitely gay though. Everyone in the OP threads seems to agree, even the non-fujos. That's saying something.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. <br><br>Give me 30 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>typical fujoshit delusion</br></br>  <br> expressing your opinion about a character means you're obsessed with him <br>0/10<br>I like the actual strawhats minus Brook and Chopper, does that mean, I'm obsessed with Brook and Chopper?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he is.<br><br>He partied on PH even though they know Doffy was coming.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. Jesus christ dude. Luffy had his entire crew there. And Smoker, who Luffy thinks is strong. And Law. And the G5. And they had Caesar. Their crew wasn't fucking halved and they weren't fighting a goddamn Yonko.</br>  <br>Okay, everyone besides you. Happy now?</br>  Law is obviously bisexual you fucking faggots.  <br>Can't think of any females that piqued Law's interests.</br>  Currently rereading Drum and man is Chopper's design great there. He looks like a moomin and that is cute as fuck.<br><br>Not cute in the "marketable to jap girl kawaiiii~ :3 xD" kind of way, but just plain old fashioned cute.</br></br>  Threadly reminder  I like Sabo because  when I was 14 I made up an OC crew whose captain used a pipe as a weapon and I fucking loved those godawful little abominations. Since he also fights with a pipe, he reminds me of them in a good way, even if that means he's fanfiction-tier.   <br>2/10</br>  <br> What is Bon Clay? </br>  <br>He was obviously trying to flirt with tashigi, but didn't know how to do it, so he copied Doffy hoping to get that glasses pussy.</br>  <br>That is perhaps the most autistic thing I've read this week.<br>Congrats.</br></br>   Rushed OP because I didn't like it <br> The reason I don't like it might be because I rushed it <br> Have to go back and reread it all just because I might actually like it <br> mfw: Have to reread a series I don't even like. <br><br>Fuck I wished I could just be into OP like the rest of you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because I don't see you making a shitty thread about Zoro's lesser-tier backstory and his reasoning to risk everything to become the strongest swordsman in the first place.<br><br>Obviously, for some reason, Sabo's objectively more tragic backstory offends you more than this. You make a whole thread about the mistreatment of his character and reply offensively to anyone that tells you "hey man, it's actually not that bad". Cause they don't know shit right? They don't understand how fucking tragic it is that Sabo of all people got stuck with the cliche amnesia shtick !<br><br>C'mon, you're obsessed. It's fine, you're not alone. I'm sure he's got a lot of raging boners pointing his way judging by the character popularity polls, and the past three Sabo threads all dedicated to him and the mistreatment of his character. But you chose to make another one for god knows why. Most likely because you just can't get enough of talking about Sabo all day and night.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls just can't get into shounen.</br>  <br>Don't force yourself to read something if you don't like it.<br>It'll only make you hate it.</br></br>  <br>Kek, you're delusional. I only headcanon about three characters in the whole OP universe as gay, and Law's one of them. He's gay as fuck.</br>  <br>Why not just, not be into it? It's not for everyone. If you tried it once, and you didn't like it that's fine. You shouldn't force yourself to like stuff just because you want to follow the mass.</br>  <br>Trannies don't count.</br>   caring about sexuality in a manga that does not have any romance <br>Why do people do this?</br>  <br>The first thing I loved about One Piece where the jokes. How it started with Luffy calling Colby a bastard, and saying he hated him. Luffy knocking Zoro off the boat got me everytime.</br>  <br>Bon Clay is 10x manlier then you could ever hope to be</br>  <br><br>Or I should've said I don't see you making threads about Chopper turning into a moeblob and Brook getting the least development out of the strawhats. But whatever, still holds that you're obsessed with Sabo more than them.</br></br>  <br>Out of curiosity who are the other two?</br>  <br> Chopper turning into a moeblob and Brook getting the least development out of the strawhats <br>We had enough of this after the timeskip. Sabo is an actual *new* case of cancer.</br></br>  I thought that was a good chance BB would kill him before he ever got to do anything cool, same for his crew.<br>If Kidd and friends are after him there should be better odds the red hair pirates will cut loose at some point.</br>  <br>Sanji and Zeff.</br>   One person got anaconda from his bread miseries <br>No shit nigger otherwise every Two Thing peoles would has anaconda</br>  <br>reminder of what?</br>  <br>no anon, YOU are the cancer</br>  <br>I sure as hell hope so, because I'm a girl.<br><br>Croc and Marco.</br></br></br>  <br>Btw is it doctor thing to change from a brimmed hat to that cap thing like a level up or was just to make them marketable kawaii?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Just another day in a One Piece thread....<br><br><br>The way I see it Shanks will take the Kidd alliance as his underlings after he beats them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this defensive <br>Just accept that your favorite character is shit</br></br>    <br>Is Croc gay because he used to be a chick or is he just straight up gay?</br>  <br><br>He still has the brimmed hat.</br></br>  <br>i hate sabo because he made koala cry<br><br>fucking son of a bitch, he's probably going to get himself killed later and maker her cry more<br><br>fucking cunt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it is you who is insecure since you have a minority opinion</br>  <br>Half his face looks like Mihawk here.</br>  <br>Croc ain't gay he put all his teams in manxwoman pairings</br>  <br>He does? Don't remember him wearing one after the TS.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you trying to follow something that you clearly don't like ? Just read something else.</br>  <br> minority opinion <br>yeah no<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128443<wbr>784/#128443784<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128515<wbr>053/#128515053<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128521<wbr>458/#128521458<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128537<wbr>285/#128537285<br><br>And this came out of the first page, I didn't bother to search on. Look through the threads retard.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> implying luffy would party without his nakama </br></br>  <br>Chopper is still wearing his red hat, its just wrapped in that blue thing</br>  <br>Finally, someone understands. Why the fuck do people think Luffy cares about Partying more than half his crew ?</br>  <br>Kushina also died falling down stairs<br><br>Are you going to say everyone's damage output is the same, especially when they were kids?</br></br></br>  <br>they are  brothers </br>  <br> threads on /a/ are representative  <br>are you literally 12?</br></br>  <br><br>It's under the cap - the manga shows it better than the anime really.</br></br>  <br>Oh shiiieeet it does seem like that. The fuck is the point of that blue thing? To change style cause he can't take his hat off?</br>  <br> he thinks Kushina is dead </br>  <br> Look through the threads retard. <br>I suggest that is something you should do because there are lots of differing opinions in these threads.</br></br>  <br>Well then he is manlier than the manliest character you can think of.<br>Bon Clay was alpha as fuck. He is the Freddy Mercury of OP.</br></br>  <br>Its confirmed hat glassesfag isn't her</br>  <br>They literally are for /a/'s taste. That's it. I'm not discussing with you if Sabo is a popular character, because the poll proved he is. That's not what we are speaking about you retard. <br><br><br>Yeah, but mostly either shitted on Sabo or called him good while shitting on amnesia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the people complaining about Chopper MOST vocally were Chopperfags being upset about what Oda did to one of their favorite characters, which makes sense<br><br>Honestly, you're just supporting my observation even more. You're suggesting that you're not a Sabofag, I'm suggesting that you are, which again, is fine anon. Don't fight it. <br><br>And I don't remember it being this bad with Chopper back then. Three threads in a row about the same shit? You guys just can't get enough, geez.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By whom? Maybe she had amnesia?</br>  <br>Where does that Croc used to be a chick theory come from?</br>  <br> what is wano </br>  <br> They literally are for /a/'s taste. <br> /a/'s taste <br> /a/ is one person <br>yes, you are 12. now lets move on</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're still here.<br><br>Here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he was born a straight chick. <br><br>He was trying to make himself look less suspicious, of course.<br><br>I'm glad Law decided to get himself a new hat, the first one was ugly as sin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ivankov knows a secret about him, ivankov can change the gender of people</br>  <br>Simply magnificent.</br>  <br> Honestly, you're just supporting my observation even more. You're suggesting that you're not a Sabofag, I'm suggesting that you are, which again, is fine anon. Don't fight it. <br> someone shits on a character <br> n-no I know you secretly love him!! <br>Are you retarded? Do you suggest that Chopper and Sabo have the same value?<br><br><br>Nope you are retarded. I of course meant the opinion of the most anons on /a/ and you know that. Don't try to change the subject now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what if the lil nigga had amnesia. There isnt some magic amnesia meter like "You must take this much damage to have amnesia"<br><br>Besides Sabo's head got rekt. Zoro doesnt even have scars from TB.</br></br>  When will Sabofag and Rebeccafag get together and have sex. They can make an army of shitposters to finally get rid of OP threads on /a/ once and for all.  <br><br>Ivankov knows his 'secret' - a 'secret' Croc was desperate not to let anyone know that he changed his mind and helped Luffy.<br><br>Ivankov also happens to be able to change the gender of people with his DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, that's true art right there. I might just make it my phone wallpaper. Thanks anon.<br><br>His secret past.</br></br></br>  <br>Some Oda interview awhile back<br><br>Also I guess I meant Tashigi earlier<br><br>I think it was the same one where he touched on the subject of Luffy's mother briefly. Not in the sense that he told us who she was, but I think he said she'd be ugly at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I of course meant the opinion of the most anons on /a/ <br>and you surely can show me a statistic now that proves this, you can't? Oh, then I suggest you get rid of your tunnel vision you underaged piece of shit.</br></br>  <br><br>I see. Thanks</br></br>  My problem with the amnesia bit is any other author would be getting lit up for using it. It's a terrible trope to introduce a character that should have otherwise shown up.<br><br><br>Soap opera tier writing. Oda is above that. Or at least the way everyone praises him he should be.</br></br></br>  Remember to not reply to the cancerous tripfag  <br>and you surely can show me a statistic now that disproves this, you can't? Oh, then I suggest you get rid of your tunnel vision you underaged piece of shit.</br>  <br>sorry, you aren't 12, you are 10 at most.</br>  I mean its not like child skulls arent significantly<br> weaker to account for the still growing body. Oh wait that's exactly the case.</br>  <br>I would agree if niggas was gettin amnesia left and right, but this nigga went through some amnesiaficating shit.</br>  <br><br>Do you perhaps, work for mangastream?</br></br>  <br> if I call him a child, there surely believe that I'm old enough to browse 4chinks <br>Listen always trying to have the last word while writing senseless shit proves besically taht you are projecting, so speak about One Piece again or fuck off.</br></br>  <br><br>Stop it you're far too kind.</br></br>  <br><br>You're both trying to get the fucking last word, you retards.</br></br>  <br>I agree. <br>It also made him more shy looking, which fits his character.</br></br>  <br>Listen always trying to have the last word while writing senseless shit proves besically taht you are projecting, so speak about One Piece again or fuck off.</br>  <br>•*Wooshing sfx*</br>  <br>god was he a fat fuck back then</br>  <br>I liked Chopper more when he was a pudgy humanoid reindeer and not fucking Pikachu with antlers.</br>  <br> someone shits on a character <br> n-no I know you secretly love him!! <br>You're not shitting on his character though. You're upset that he was given the amnesia cliche. That Oda made his 12 year old self weak enough to not be able to endure a canon to the head. Blasphemy. You're upset at what Oda because Sabo wasn't given nearly as good of a explanation as your god-tier headcannon. <br><br>That's not shitting on a character. That's shitting on the author for how they handled said character. Why would you care as much as you do if you weren't such a Sabofag? Why would you be so offended with the amnesia cliche given to him, even if it makes sense? Because you don't think it's worthy enough for Sabo? You just can't move on for whatever reason. That's more dedication than I have with Zoro and his shitty backstory and I'm the biggest Zorofag you'll ever meet, man. You're obsessed with blond fire dick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Oda would be lit up for making Sabo into a douche who didnt want to save his brother.<br><br>The criticism shouldn't be of the amensia trope, it should introducing such an important character late in the story that the only way to reasonably explain why he wasnt in the MC's life is by using a clichéd trope.<br><br>But, everyone focused on just the amensia takes away all the attention away from the real issue.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oda is above that. Or at least the way everyone praises him he should be. <br>There's your fucking problem. You're reading a shounen manga. Stop that shit.</br></br>  <br> implying the tripfag is the real problem here <br>I hope you're all conscious you morons are discussing OP in the 4the Sabo bait thread in a row.</br></br>  <br> Why would you care as much as you do if you weren't such a Sabofag? <br>Because it's shit-tier writing, introducing a thrid brother and saying <br> hurr durr he just forgot everyone, that's why he didn't show up xD <br> Please be gentle when luffy's second father shows up :) <br>You are literally retarded, because you are suggesting that everyone who shit's on a character is said characterfag. That's retarded. No one would say that Brook is a shit-toer strawhat without addressing him being underused, Does that make ever brook hater a brook fag? No you autist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The new look is symbolic of his training on the island of giant birds.<br><br>Because Pikachu got strong after beating spearows.</br></br></br>  <br>remember that time Zoro helped him wash his back?</br>  <br>Shonen isn't above literary criticisms. There has been genuinely good writing in this very manga. I don't know if he was forced by his editors or not to make sabo and this was the best he could do. But it doesn't stop the problems inherent with creating such a character. It obviously was a good idea monetarily since Sabo seems to be popular and will push out sales.</br>  <br>The problem of Sabo haters is that Oda gave a reasonable explanation for him not showing up at MF or contacting Ace or Luffy in 10 years, now they focus on the amnesia part to vent their hatred. People like this a never satisfied no matter what Oda does and shift to something else to nitpick about immediately.</br>  <br>wait what<br>x - 7 = 19 + x<br>x = 26 + x<br>0 = 26</br></br></br></br>  <br>see <br><br>x - 7 = 19 - x<br>x = 26 - x<br>2x = 26<br>x = 13</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations dude, you can resolve basic bait equations.</br>  <br> But, everyone focused on just the amensia takes away all the attention away from the real issue. <br>This. Fuck all of that discussion missing the point in the last three threads.</br></br>  <br>Not anyone in this argument but I don't like him as a character, both him and Ace don't feel like actual characters to me and are just 'there'. Though the amnesia part isn't so bad as it's the only explanation that makes sense.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br><br><br>oh. now it makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>It's cool OP, I think we get it now.</br>  <br><br>literally fuck sabo</br></br>  <br>Kuina fell down the stairs and got amnesia. Deciding not to return to her father, she moved to Wano country.</br>  <br> both him and Ace don't feel like actual characters to me and are just 'there'. <br>Why though? Both Ace and Sabo got backstories that fleshed out their characters and ideals.</br></br>  <br>I'm the Op and you're quoting some other guy<br><br><br>top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>We had a ton of wrong questions in our Maths book when I was learning. Shit even confused the teacher a couple of times.</br>  <br>Well, maybe there are not as much people bothered by this as you think.</br>  <br>It didn't really matter whether tha was op or not I was just joking but fuck you as well. I hope you trip on pigeon shit and break your skull.</br>  <br>Not to me, both of them have very minimal dialogue and I still don't feel I understand them as much. All I know about Ace is that he questions why he exists constantly and all I know about Sabo is that he was Aces noble friend who wanted to free himself, and now wants to free the world from the world government. They don't have as much personality other than being Luffy's brothers.</br>  <br>This is basically me because I watched the one piece anime up until fishman island and hated it because I got spoiled about marineford and the timeskip and couldn't wait for it to get there but that led me to not enjoying everything else in OP.<br><br>Now I'm reading the manga and it's pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>No, people just called me a "hater" when I said Sabo was not well implemented and went on and on explaining why the amnesia is a totally possible thing to happen, missing the point that the amnesia was not the central reason for my dislike of Sabo.</br>  <br><br>Yeah manga is much better.<br><br>However for the anime there is also One Pace which fixes the pacing of the anime to match the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>stay mad shitposter speak about OP or fuck off<br><br><br>I still feel like Ace's dead actually made him a noteworthy character which was of course crushed by Sabo when he took the Mera Mera. Really unlike WB's fruit which BB got no one should have goten Ace's. It would have been way better if the Mera Mera never showed up in teh story again after Marineford.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't taken a maths class in eight years and I'm confused as fuck. How does this shit work again? I can't remember.  I think I might be suffering from amnesia. </br>  <br> what does + and - mean <br>I think you're problem is way  more deep rooted. </br></br>  <br>Given your avatar and the fact that it's already been explained multiple time in this thread, I'd say you've got a lot more to worry about than possible amnesia.</br>  <br>It's fucking algebra, you 10 year old</br>  <br> shitposter <br>Okay. I will shit up your thread and turn it into a gay dumping zone even you tranny uncle wouldn't dare step into.</br></br>  Reminder that the people extremly mad at the Sabo stuff are ones that spent months and months theorizing in their little gay theory notebook on why Sabo was gone.<br><br>If they had any real sense of writing they would know Oda just made up the character willy nilly without thinking about how it affects the past. They would know that he new wrote himself into a corner and took the lazy and easy way out that just so happened to also make the most sense.<br><br>I mean theres really no reason for Sabo to stay out of his brothers lives, otherwise their brotherhood is meaningless. They put their brothers over their lives as pirates and revolutionaries. <br><br>But no, these people cant over the fact their gay theories that he was on a secret mission or something never came true. These people fancy themselves better writers than Oda. Even though they have never written anything buy shit theories on an anonymous imageboard.<br><br>Just look at how obsessed they are at calling Oda a hack for not using their shitty fanfic. If this manga was written by them no one would read it, and this is why they are so assblasted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> avatar <br>This isn't narutoforums.</br></br>  <br>I feel the complete opposite way. Ace got little screentime but the flashback and his speech just before he died layed everything bare about his character. Same with Sabo, his backstory made it perfectly clear why he wants to be free and that he felt like suffocating in his hometown. Finding a place in the world for themselves is what Ace was and Sabo is about. I think Oda managed to make this come across in a a very good way even though we did not see both of these characters as much as the protagonists.</br>  <br>Thanks for that pasta, it confirms my belief that OP is a faggot.</br>  <br> No one would say that Brook is a shit-toer strawhat without addressing him being underused, Does that make ever brook hater a brook fag? No you autist. <br>Do you see threads upon threads popping up addressing Brook and his underdeveloped character? No. Most Brook haters just shit on Brook with a post or too. 'He's the shittest strawhat, least character development. All he is, is a panty perv that tells skull jokes." end of story. They probably don't care enough about the character to continue talking about him for four fucking threads. And they at least shit on the actual character. You're making whole threads about Sabo and taking offense to any reply defending the anmesia plot as the most plausible explanation. <br><br>So tell me, what is your post complaining about besides 'poor' treatment his character got with the whole canon-to-the-head-amnesia thing? You're making no complaints about his actually character, except for the fact that he got a shitty backstory in your eyes. His explanation doesnt change the character he is today. If you didn't like him in the first place, why do you care so much about his backstory to make another fucking thread after we've already had three beforehand? Why do you want to talk about it so much? Was it really THAT unjustified for Sabo in your eyes? If so, why would it be? Like I said, it's plausible and coherent. You'd only be this upset if you were expecting some kind of God-tier backstory for him, or if your favorite character got shit on. Really, three whole fucking threads of Sabo and still not enough for you? Whether you really dislike him or not, you're still obsessed like a homolust faggot. Getting off on hate-sex is a thing too you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I still feel like Ace's dead actually made him a noteworthy character which was of course crushed by Sabo when he took the Mera Mera. <br>Why exactly? Aces death still had impact to the story and to the development of the main character. Sabo getting the Mera Mera did not change a thing about that.</br></br>  <br><br><br>pls no bully</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, I guess my problem is I'm comparing them to the other Strawhats who have had much more screen time to be fleshed out properly to the point where I've learned to love the ones I originally hated. Usopp being a perfect example.</br>  <br>As I said discuss OP or fuck off, you aren't proving anything with your shitposts<br><br><br>It one of the arguments why everyone was like <br> hurr durr sabo is ace 2.0 <br>Which made me start to feel bad about Ace being mistreated.<br><br><br> tl;dr I wasn't here when one piece came back after the 3-months break and the timeskip started, so I have no clue why people shit on sabo now instead of chopper <br>Good for you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am glad no one will reply seriously to this.<br><br>For real though, all that efford you put into spouting shit at people intentionally and misrepresenting their arguments, why don't you put that into something useful, to have a neat little discussion about the subject matter?</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay dude, what it is you don't understand ?<br>The basic principle is that you can switch the numbers and the x around the = as long as you switch their sign.</br></br>  <br> I don't know if he was forced by his editors or not to make sabo and this was the best he could do. <br>This is what I'm talking about. Why do you do that? Why can't it just have been Oda's decision? Why do you put him on such a high pedestal in the first place? The anmesia cliche is everywhere, not only in shounen manga. It's in novels, tv shows, movies, etc. What makes Oda such a special flake that he should be forbidden from using it? A lot of people acknowledge that anmesia explanation was the best one possible. Seriously, what's so bad about Sabo having amnesia except for the fact that it's been used in other stories and mediums?</br></br>  <br> x - 7 = 19 + x <br>You want to remove the 7 on the left side, but everything you do on one side you also have to do on the other, therefore:<br> x - 7 + 7 = 19 + x +7 <br> x = 26 + x <br> x - x = 26 + x - x <br> 0 = 26 <br> you normally want to isolate x and give it a value, but x can't be itself plus 26 either, so the answer wont make sense either way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dragon pissed <br><br>Damn that's cool</br></br></br>  <br> you aren't proving anything with your shitposts <br>You're getting triggered and your thread becomes shit for half the people here, but most importantly It helps reaching the bump limit faster.</br></br>  <br>Its true, I mean notice how they never offer a better solution than amnesia. They dont give a damn anymore how much it makes sense based on Oda's characterization of their brotherhood. Nope, all that matters is that it wasn't their idea so it's hack.</br>  <br>It is not well connected to the rest of the plot, and essentially makes the character appear from out of nowhere.<br><br>Does it explain the situation? Yes, probably.<br>Is it narratively satisfying? No, not at all.<br><br>And no, Oda is not forbidden from using it, just like he is not immune from being criticized for using it. Stop the double standard.<br><br>We've had days of discussion about this already, give it a rest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. When I read the chapter and read the part with the amnesia I just thought "Ah ok." and went along. I really am baffled sometimes how some people are bothered by the most trivial shit and have to overanalyze everything. This is a fucking kids comic for gods sake. Ah well, maybe it is because there are weeks between new chapters and everything has to be taken apart about every chapter until the next one comes out. People who have the chance to read every chapter right after the next one without breaks do not even think about most of the stuff that is discussed here every week and just enjoy the ride.</br>  <br>Sabo killing Akainu when?</br>  <br><br>Oh right, I got it. Thanks. <br><br>I love this artist but you need to fuck off, you're just as bad as the sabofag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But it doesn't stop the problems inherent with creating such a character <br>There are no problems with the way he was introduced. You just don't like him.</br></br>  <br> What if Oda's editor also worked on D. Gray Man. </br>  <br> tl;dr I wasn't here when one piece came back after the 3-months break and the timeskip started, so I have no clue why people shit on sabo now instead of chopper <br>I was here, faggot. But, if that's all you've got to say about it, that's cool. Unfortunately for you Sabo will be gone for probably hundreds of chapters before you can suck him off again. I hope another blonde cutie can be introduced to fill the void for you.</br></br>  <br> you're just as bad as the sabofag <br>Abyssus abyssum invocat.</br></br>  <br>Okay good night anon!<br><br><br> I really am baffled sometimes how some people are bothered by the most trivial shit <br>The whole deal about this being discussed online blows it out of proportion. People are not actually that bothered, but conflicting opinions push each other up. When I read the chapter I thought "Well, that was a stupid explanation." and went along. When I posted here that I thought that explanation was stupid, someone else disagreed with me and eplained his view. I explained my view. Several different people did the same.<br><br>And then shitposters picked up on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I was here, faggot. <br>nope if you were you wouldn't suggest like a retard while talking about Brook and Chopper that everyone hating something specific about a character actually love that character which is pretty much retarded just like you.</br></br>  <br> I love this artist but you need to fuck off, you're just as bad as the sabofag. <br><br>Don't be mean to doflanon.</br></br></br>  To counter the shitposting let's rank the Supernovas, Luffy and Zolo excluded.<br> Law&gt;Kid&gt;Bonney=Killer&gt;Hawkins&gt;X Drake&gt;&gt;&gt;Apoo&gt;Blackbeard&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;Urouge&gt;Capone</wbr> </br>  <br><br>Salve abyssus meum antiquum amicum.</br></br>  <br> and then shitposters picked up on it <br>More like OP kept pushing that pointless discussion.</br></br>  Soon, right?<br>He found a poneglyph so he has to come back...right?</br>  This thread took me back to simpler times.<br><br> 300 chapters to introduce a brother <br><br>what naivety</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if its satisfying if theres not much if anything else he could. He showed Luffy not giving a fuck about letting each other live their own lives. If his brothers is about to be killed nothing else matters, not even his own life. Even Ace knew this which is why he told the BB pirates not to tell his brother. <br><br>If you want to have an issue have an issue with another brother being introduced so late, but the amensia is not a problem.</br></br></br>  <br>I love you too Lawlu anon.</br>  <br>I actually agree with your list</br>  <br>BB is a supernova ?<br>Apoo and Drake should be higher, otheriwise that ranking is pretty good.</br></br>  Reminder that it doesn't go away unless you ignore it AND report it.  <br>Yeah, the only reason why he didn't join immediately was because he was too overpowered for the crew and would made a lot of things trivial but now is a good time for him to join the SH.</br>  <br> implying reporting gayposters gets them banned <br>So it doesn't go away.</br></br>  <br> Ace being Rogers son is an asspull <br>Narutards really are the most retarded beings on this earth</br></br>  <br>The thing is Jinbei should be as strong as any member of the worst generation by now making him, Zoro and luffy three guys who could take on pirate captain-tier people in the new world.</br>  <br>Wow thats pretty pathetic that you've spent so long reading a manga you hate just to shit on it. What a sad life.<br><br>I hate fairy tale but it literally didnt take me more than a few arcs to drop it and move on with my life. Maybe because I actually have more fulfilling things in my life than to hate read a manga for years and years.</br></br></br>   It's time.   Time for what?  <br>hardcore gay sex</br>  Not yet.  What a great week it has been  Hype.  <br>Too bad the anime sucks compared to the manga</br>  <br>it couldn't possibly live up to the standards of the manga</br>  <br>It's literally a 1:1 adaption. The only downside is that its pace is too fast</br>  <br>They're not leaving anything out and now we get to hear the jokes which makes them even funnier, why are you all complaining about. The shower scene was ten times funnier than it was in the manga</br>  <br>The art is ugly (what's with the colors?), the animation is low quality, the voice actors they picked spend all their time yelling, and yeah the pacing is way too fast</br>  <br> what's with the colors? <br>Why you want every single anime to look the same? I think it's refreshing and it goes well with the realistic style. About the rest of your statements, you must be trolling.</br></br>  Stop arguing and let's talk about what really matters: would you?  <br>Not for Gakuto it hasn't.</br>  <br>It objectively looks like shit, go ask /ic/. The shading especially is so bad I feel sick</br>  <br>No</br>  nth for Poor Killua, he was born to suffer   gintoki and hijikata <br> laughing like this with each other <br>Why do I feel like crying?  Are they really leaving? ;_; </br></br>    Didn't we just have a thread? Oh well  <br>My dick feels very good about it</br>  <br>You don't need to love someone to give him a good dicking though.</br>  The last thread was merely some days ago, what the hell? Can't we just decide to have a specific day of the week for this?<br>I'll just leave this here and go away</br>  <br><br> le funny misunderstanding homo joke </br></br>  <br>Is it bad that I really, really want Suna to have a gay crush on Takeo. God, the suffering</br>  How often do you self-insert?  I only do it for SoL  <br>What is self insert means? Go elaborate, OP?</br>  <br>Only while watching porn</br>  <br>It depends what people consider self-inserting.<br>I can't ever imagine watching a show tricking myself into thinking this character is me. However when I listen to a show's OP or OST I like to imagine my own scenario's and characters and stuff.</br></br>  <br>What, how, when, why, where and for whom is/we self insert OP?</br>  Almost never.  <br>Are you me?</br>  Only in terrible battle harem manga.  I don't self-insert but I find myself jealous of some MCs and long for some female characters; so that's a thing I guess. Then again, maybe it's just because real life sucks.  I only self insert as the trap in doujins  <br>This</br>  When a character's getting NTR'd  <br>I'm similar to this, but I just find myself getting jealous of situations that I've never experienced, and can probably never experience.</br>  Usually only with NEET girls.  <br>I used to do it for almost everything I read or watched, except instead of replacing one of existing characters, I was creating original characters for self-insert, which were usually mysterious, knowledgable, distant and very strong in a given setting.<br><br>Yeah, I was a gigantic faggot. I got much better, but I'm still not completely healed.</br></br></br>  Never. I just get angry at MC for doing stupid things involving best girl because I want to self-insert but can't when they don't act like I want them to.  I'm superior in terms of looks and abilities compared to most anime MC, so i have a hard time self-inserting  I self insert as a side character that attends the same school or lives in the same world the mc does.  <br>Anyone is going to look better than Blandy McBeta and have better abilities beyond being 'nice', most of the time the MC isn't even supposed to be good looking but if you're a self-insert fuccboi you don't need to.</br>  <br><br>Not even once. I'm not that delusional\autistic\pathetic   although im not shure about the last [spoiler/]<br><br>Howewer i try to symphasize with most of the cast be that MC\villan(s) or minor charachters to feel the flow\ideas\points the show is trying to make.</br></br> </br></br>  <br>This</br>  I can only self-insert as girls getting fugged  Is self-insert (when used as negative way to describe a character) a buzzword?  I don't self insert as the MC, so much as imagine my own interactions if best girl was real.  <br>I have no selfworth so never.</br>  <br>No because it's an accurate way to describe a character if they're either A. overpowered as shit with no flaws or B. Beta MC who has 10/10s drooling over him for literally no reason.</br>  In h doujins all the time, that's the only time I can fap to traps. When I self insert as the trap and get dominated by girls.  <br>Its used a lot just to spite characters people don't like.<br>The only actual self-inserts I know of are nukige protags and Kirito.</br></br>  testy westy  <br>wait... aren't you supposed to escape from realyty by self-inserting because you have no selfworth for the real you?</br>  <br><br> tfw you self insert as the cuck in NTR and get off on feelings of shame. </br></br>  This is no longer fanservice.

Every time I something that resembles the piano piece they use as BGM for the kisses, I get an unfathomably hard boner.  hope this shit works  I bet this show is just excuse to make high-budget porn.    <br>BDs when?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, this is pretty much just porn.</br></br>  <br>Cut it out. This is extremely tame for a regular TV ecchi even. Just some kissing and bath house nudity.<br>If you want "porn", watch any DxD, Shinmai Maou, Prison School episodes, even regular TV episodes. <br>This is only talked about because tehy are loli, but among regular age girls this is nothing.</br></br></br>  What would be the consequences of sex with Kuro?  <br>  Fate no longer allows implied sex or worm <br>  Illya don't give a fuck <br> Or rather, they give a lot of fucks </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Nothing like that happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 0:33-0:39 <br><br>FORGIVE ME LORD FOR I HAVE SINNED</br></br></br>  <br> Illya don't give a fuck <br>Showing kisses is allowed.<br><br>Pedophilia was never a sin. Homosexuality is, since it's sodomy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbian is homosexuality you fucking infidels</br>  <br>Yeah, I know, but if he meant he sinned just because he got aroused for two underage girls, I'm clearing it for him that even if it's illegal and unlawful, it still isn't a sin.</br>  Trying to make good quality webums with 4096kb restriction is a pain in the butt  <br>She never said that. She said there are other ways, not that it would be more effective. I hate people who make stuff up. Fucking end yourself</br>  <br>Fucking secondaries man, go and read the VN, the mages mana transfer is done through sex.<br>yes you put penis in vagoo and it makes mana<br>this is canon by nasu</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128564896 <br>By lurking more.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128564896 <br> madokami <br><br>delete this<br>lurk moar</br></br></br></br>  When will Shirou snap?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128564896 <br>Madokami is the manga version of ExHentai, apply yourself.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128564896 <br>duckduckgo.com</br>  <br>Nipple is there, thank God.</br>  <br>Only when he wants to make everyone happy.</br>  <br>Where are the nipples?</br>  <br>this<br>thanks fucking god</br></br>  <br>Tsukihime, fate stay night,... all said sex is the most best way for transfer mana.</br>  <br>Which is the best kind.

She is a highly sexual loli who want's Shirawe's penis.</br></br></br></br>    <br> that subtle nipple outline <br>Oh fuck me. Someone in SL is jacking off to the non-steamed version of that scene right now.

All porn is fanservice.</br></br>  <br>Because 3D is not.</br>  <br><br>This is mesmerizing.</br></br>  So I take it this anime is filled with Philosophy, and complex story and characters?     what if we took a serious VN <br> then, what if we took some random, unimportant side character... <br> and then, what if we made her, and all her irrelevant friends lesbians <br> prisma illya <br><br>a complete insult to the Fate franchise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>seriously you can't look away from it</br>  <br>You're getting slow, anon. Step it up.</br>   ping pong reference in Prisma Illya <br><br>Well that was unexpected.</br></br>  I know Illya's great and all, but how come no one's posting the gifs of Rin's or Liz's glorious butts?  <br>Silver Link confirmed for bros.</br>  <br>I wanted to make some wai..<br> gif <br>is this bait<br>but I just decided not to since it's illya thread</br></br></br></br>  <br> liking rin or liz <br><br>RETARD ALERT</br></br></br>  <br>Because Prisma Illya didn't do Rin butts as well as UBW did.</br>  Subs when?  <br> Serious VN </br>  <br>3-4 months</br>    <br>thanks doc</br>  <br><br>Surprised me as well. Out of all the anime to do it, it was Prisma Illya that did it first.<br><br>Fuck man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was the BD</br>  <br> moeshit infringing on my glorious AOTCAAT <br>Calling the cops.</br></br>  <br>Blu-ray too but nice filename.</br>    <br>It's an OVA.<br>The steam will never be removed.</br></br>   Silver Link in charge of pandering to pedophiles     <br>But they did, there's at least two glorious shot in this last OVA, too bad the old link got took down or I would've shown you</br>  How can they let little girls kiss so lewd air?  <br>She is 18</br>  <br> /a/ on the floor </br>  <br>Really?

A shame http://a.uguu.se/lrjxtx.mp4 got took down.<br><br>There was also some glorious Liz butt somewhere within the episode.</br></br></br>  <br>NEVER EVER<br> mfw in 10 years all the porn will be banned and we will be reduced to human trash controlled by goverment and censorship in a perfect world where animation isn't lewd and in stellar quality <br>ahhh it hurts<br>just give a good studio a huge budget and get some good lolicon mangaka and BAM the entire population of the planet is drowned in the ocean of semen and cowper juice</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking swear, by the time the Herz OVA comes out, it'll be fullblown tribbing and dry humping.</br>  God bless this Anime.  <br>This is herz OVA and it's out for 2 days now<br>I think you mean 4th season OVA which is more than a year away if not 2</br></br>  <br>Ilya is a Goddess</br>  <br>This is the 2wei OVA.

With Kuro and Miyu joining as well.   Normalfags' reaction to episode 1 was fucking hilarious.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V0C<wbr>drUweSpA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Truly fine art.</br>  <br> liking yuri loli ecchi themed anime <br>i thought anons on /a/ were bunch of gentlemen with patrician taste  ;_; </br></br>  <br>We're little girls with patrician taste.</br>  <br>Get that patrician dick and shove it up your ass, fag.</br>     children's show <br> non-stop yuri action <br><br>why is this allowed?<br><br>what shitty father would let their daughter watch prisma illya?</br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they get some actual artists to do the end cards this time and not just the staff fucking around like usual.  <br> children's show <br>no it isn't it's rated CERO 17+</br></br>  Dropped. I don't want to watch anime that make me fap to children. Dawn it, IlIya.  <br> what father would let their daughter watch prisma illya? <br>Not me. I wouldn't let her. I'd force her.</br></br>  <br>oh wait not cero, too much v, sorry just 17+</br>    <br>Yes, I'm sure kids are staying up late past their bedtimes to watch Prisma illya.</br>  I think they actually drew the nipples a bit.  <br> &gt;children's show <br>Yeah, children buy BDs don't they.</br></br>  <br> not just the staff fucking around like usual <br> They need to fuck around even more. </br></br>  I think you can even see a bit of pink areola here.  ova subs where  <br><br>CI/a/ pls go and stay go</br></br>  Shirou is a strong man for resisting the dark illyan.  <br><br><br>I just wondering,<br>How did US Gov. react to this kind of entertainment?</br></br></br></br>  <br>wat nippel and leg rubing has to do with mana transfer. And why anime does not giver the illyas the breast size they have in the mang.</br>  <br> watching anime reaction <br>just stop</br></br>  <br>This OVA will probably never be licensed is how.</br>  <br>The more aroused you are the more saliva your produce do the more efficient the transfer is.</br>  <br>God why are they so perfect?</br>    <br>Make me big guy.</br>  <br><br>Burned shirous reaction to how revealing miyus oufit is is priceless. She is your sister man, She could be naked and you still should not be affected by it.<br><br>Also, is the shirous stronger that he regular shirou. How can she project swords so fast without activating that reality marbel thing.<br><br>Anime makes amistake to mke it look like prisma illya is just for the lolis when is actually a a decent battle mnga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this stupid fucking song is annoying as fuck</br>  Why are people getting upset about Fate shit when it's an eroge anyway?  <br>the only people upset are secondaries who dont know anything about the erogame history of type moon. These fags only know the "mature" Zero anime and wanted more and either found kaleido zwei or ubw</br>  <br>If I left, would you die? <br>and where the DWP guy</br></br>  <br>Brurays when?</br>    <br>I seriously suggest you kill yourself.</br>  <br>Terrible form, she need to work on her swimming.</br>  <br> She is your sister man, She could be naked and you still should not be affected by it. </br>  <br>Try posting this on /u/ and see what kind of reaction you get.</br>  <br>It's not like the Fate franchise was any good to begin with tbh</br>  <br>Imagine how the voice actors must have felt.</br>  <br>Federally, 2D loli isn't illegal, however, some states will file things like these under 'Obscenity' laws.<br><br>Typically it's pretty hard to get busted for 2D loli anyway, at most they have to be able to prove beyond 'reasonable' doubt (and this varies depending on the courts and judges) that you were distributing or planning to distribute content for the obscenity charges to even stick, so unless they catch you importing a crate of physical loli doujins (which a guy got caught for once) you'll probably not ever be caught.<br><br>Basically, if all your 2D loli is downloaded and on your computer, you're not going to be caught even if your state rules this as obscene content, and unless they figure they can tack on some other charges (say they find drugs, illegal guns, or actual CP), cops just aren't going to go through the trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine the steam sex they had with the producer afterwards</br>  <br><br>Because there are retards who think it's some super amazing deep literature.</br></br>  <br>He's not burned, he's just slowly turning archer colored. The actual wounds he was wearing the bandages for healed ages ago.</br>  <br> am I fitting in now guise? </br>  <br> tbh </br>  <br><br>Additionally both the VA's are married and one already had a kid.</br></br>  <br>He's had a lot more training and had to start training a lot earlier in this world, so he can project better than a guy who started training two weeks ago or less.<br><br>Archer doesn't need to activate his RM in order to cast blades either.<br><br>If you don't get why this one is better, than you're really not getting that obvious difference. F/SN is a story of a guy who started learning how his shit worked a week ago, while Miyuverse is a guy who's been doing this for years.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, Ive been wanting to move to Washington.<br><br> Loli <br> No niggers, only clean black people <br> Legal weed <br> Not a fucking red state </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fucking your dad's wife while he's away <br> Cumming inside her <br>jesus christ what is happening? since when did incest sneak into this</br></br>  <br>I can't even fap to this manga, the story is so bad i can't enjoy the bewbs</br>  Do you think artists get turned on by their own work?  <br>The art is really bland and generic for a hentai, so no.</br>  <br>dropped this a year ago ....<br>....... what?</br></br>  <br> Fucking your dad's wife while he's away <br><br>What the hell are you talking about? That's his wife retard.<br><br>She's Kazuya's mother. Then she gets fucked up and the baby gets "transplanted" into Cassandra. <br>Kazuya treats Cassandra as his mother when he's a baby(he cries when his other mother hold him and stuff) <br>Mom goes crazy(the one in your pic) and tries to kill Kazuya, then his sister kills his mom and his father rapes cassandra.<br><br>It's crazy shit if you read it you'll understand more</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Impregnate a Loli <br> Loli commit sudoku  <br><br>Why and What do?</br></br></br>  <br>find another loli</br>  <br>The edgiest thing I can think of</br>   leaping loli; hidden baby?! <br>rejoice at watching the evidence disappear</br>  thank ang lee for the edgy ending  Is Kana Hanazawa the greatest voice actress of this decade?<br><br>I seriously can't think of a seiyuu better and more consistent than her in the recent years.</br></br>    <br>So is someone is female, likes Anime but happens to be decent looking (no seiyuu is 10/10 looking, they are just above average by Japanese beauty standards) she is intermediately faking it for some reason, even if she shows to be knowledgeable and passionate about the subject beyond a casual watcher level.<br>Every historically important female seiyuu secretly loathes Anime and everything related to it, despite choosing a career centered around it.<br>Also, all people that like Anime never leave their basements.(Despite there being thousand of people on Japanese offices that are closet Otaku/Fujoshit)<br>Gotcha, this was a really enlightening conversation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems like you finally got it.<br><br> Despite there being thousand of people on Japanese offices that are closet Otaku/Fujoshit <br><br>Did you just pull that out of your ass? A responsible adult won't waste time on kid's cartoons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What  said. Technically it's two voices rather than one but you can still hear the useless shy girl voice even when she voices angry/evil girls.<br><br>Pretty damn easy to be consistent when you do the exact same voice every season.</br></br></br>  <br> Did you just pull that out of your ass? A responsible adult won't waste time on kid's cartoons. <br>Not even that guy but I call bullshit. Even in the west there's plenty of people who hold down successful jobs, have a family, remain socially active to some degree and become a full fledged weeb the moment they get behind closed doors. Hell there's two in my extended family alone for example. <br><br>It's the exact same thing in Japan, successful people have a public face and their private life and it's not like holding down a job makes you unable to watch a tv show.</br></br></br></br>  Since I fell asleep last time and it crashed, I'm just going to re-dump Patlabor, a dead scanlation.<br><br> In the near future, large mechs called Labors are made to assist in various reconstruction projects in major countries around the world that are being threatened by global warming. In Japan, the government has enacted Project Babylon in order to conduct land reclamation. Labors are also being pressed into police and military service, aside from civilian use. <br><br> However, terrorists are now attempting to use Labors to make themselves heard, as well as common criminals, thugs and guerrillas. The National Police Agency established the Special Vehicles Division, an all-Labor task force to combat the potential use of Labors for criminal/terrorist activities. <br><br> This title received the 36th Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen manga in 1991. </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This is a Viz rip so from the 90s at least.</br>        This kid is all kinds of fucked up.  <br>Cute things are cute, Anon.<br><br>I'd be his teacher, if you know what I mean.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd fuck his ass up</br>  <br>I just want to pretend it's a she</br>  <br>Why?<br><br>There's nothing wrong with being homo for an imaginary little boy.</br></br></br>  <br>I think I have not crossed that line yet</br></blockquote>]
