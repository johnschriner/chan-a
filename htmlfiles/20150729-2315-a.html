I don't see the problem with having a show thread and a character thread.</br>  <br>It'll still turn up if you search it in the catalog though, since it's in the filename</br>  <br> Berserker is the strongest! </br>  Drunk Rachnee a cute. a CUTE!  10 and 12 are probably going to air together, so maybe we're getting 7 and 11?  Anyone have a 1080p version of the first short posted to nicovideo?  <br>Wait, how in the blazes did she manage to get drunk on coffee?</br>  <br>Caffeine is like alcohol for many species of spiders.</br>  <br>does that mean cocaine is vitamins for her?</br>  Just realized that Rachnee's web hole is an option.  <br>Nah, it would make her into a total fucking playa.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/sHzdsFiBbFc?t=1m10<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Ever seen the photo of webs made by spiders on various drugs? I kinda want to see Darling come home and smell that coffee has been put on, only to find a bunch of fucked up webs all over the place</br>  <br>Spinerette isn't a hole, brah</br>  they're all supposed to be in their 20s right?<br>is there a chapter later where they all get drunk?</br>  <br>want to elaborate so I don't end up damaging the spiderfu.</br>  <br><br><br>I have a Doujin that says different</br></br></br>  <br>It's like a bunch of tiny tyubes</br>  <br>it works with tiny dicks</br>  <br>It would be like sticking your dick in another dick</br>  <br>Reminder that pink slime is best slime</br>  <br> so Rachnee is skipped too? </br>  <br>nothin wrong with that</br>  <br>11 and 13 I say.<br>Although it doesn't really matter which order they use for 11. 7 and 13 as long as they all come before 14.</br></br>  Director obviously has to come before spider.  <br>Pink one sounds like that rare pokemon you have to spend 4 hours in the same shitty patch of grass waiting it to appear.</br>  <br> in heat all year round </br>  <br>My favorite one is the weed web, because it looks like the spider started out pretty good but then just couldn't give a fuck.</br>    you will never have your cute comics about monster girls get it's own manga and eventually get it's own anime <br><br>man, okayado must be living the fucking dream<br><br>is this what all mangaka aspire to?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not only cute, but she likes sex too and smell like flowers. Litteraly best slime.</br>  <br><br><br> In heat all year round <br> Smells like flowers <br> Upbeat and optimistic <br> Milfy ara~ara~ air <br><br>Suu who? Give us a pink slime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im more curious about hearing that Slimes apparently have some kind of cycle.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking summer, kill yourself.<br/></br></br>  <br>Come on now anon, she may be best slime but Suu is still pretty great.</br>  <br>Pink is best, but I can't help but feel a bit of sympathy for Green. She looks glum in spite of her poisonous attitude.</br>  <br><br> tumblr <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Silly anon, lets toss Suu in a flower field during spring and lets come to pick her up 24 hours later.</br>  How'd you like Dullahans? I find the whole body acting independently from the head to be kinda cute.  <br>But can pink slime be a loli like Suu?</br>  <br>Who actually gives a fuck where it came from? It's an image that's been circulated everywhere, it doesn't make a difference what site it comes from.</br>  <br>She's a slime anon, she can change shape just like Suu.</br>  <br>I find it cute, but I can't get past the whole two-faced approach. I'd probably end up believing the head's belittling remarks while tuning out the body's flirtatious and caring touch.<br><br><br>Apparently, it matters to some. Strange, isn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to stick my dick in that belly.</br>  <br> Strange, isn't it? <br>What I find even more funny is that it's these people who joke about "Triggers" and "Trigger Warnings" and junk on tumblr.  And then they're triggered by a filename with "Tumblr" in it. </br></br>  <br>Let's no derail the thread shaw we? Have a cute cyclops.</br>   no lolis <br> suddenly shotacon shit antics <br>FUCK THIS GAY EARTH</br></br>  <br>Is she from the manga? I've read it, but I don't recall her. She doesn't look like the sniper from MON.</br>  Wish someone with experience could make a proper stitch of this scene.  <br> Cute Cyclops <br><br>Agreed</br></br></br>  <br>Different manga.<br><br>The title character from Dr. Hitomi's Infirmary. Very cute, but a little surreal at times.</br></br></br>  <br> Not knowing Dr Hitomi <br><br>C´mon bruh, you need to broad your monster girls horizons</br></br></br>  <br>She's from another monster world manga. It's dr. hitomi's infirmary, but in this world everyone is unique in some way, like going invisible, rengenerating, being, giant, etc.<br><br>it's pretty fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Burr dad is best dad.</br>  What's good haremshit to watch while waiting for more Monster Musume? <br><br>I liked OniAI but it's  never getting a second season <br><br>pref with well developed girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Haremshit <br> well developed girls <br><br>That's kinda of a hard combo anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm well aware.

I like developed waifus.</br>  Are Japanese men really such manlets that swimming beyond their height is foreign to them?<br><br> Seriously though, what's the difference between 3M and 15M treading at a pool unless you're reaching for bottom? </br></br>  <br> expecting people to appreciate all sizes <br> in a big breast pandering harem <br>Anon, please.<br>DFC and small are not welcome.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Inou Battle. <br>Thanks I'll check it out.</br></br>  <br><br>Papi is the only one that bully Lala</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about?

Like which ones?</br></br>  <br> Can't handle eye contact </br>  <br>Not with that attitude.</br>  <br>Just this season?<br>Monmusu, Okuu-sama, Shimoneta, Bikini Girls, Prison School are all filled with developed girls, no lolis (well Shimoneta has one token loli, but really sidelined).<br>Only Illya has lolis, but it's not even ecchi.</br></br></br>  <br>Psychological effect, maybe?</br>  <br>Daily reminder to filter these for better quality of the thread:<br>Polt <br>Lala<br>Smith<br>Summer <br>Secondary<br>Cloca<br>mlp</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me of when I was little and would steal all the diving bricks and dump them in the deep end so I could have them all to myself, because the other kids were too scared to dive that far down.</br>  <br>I think he was just surprised at how deep it was, he was tiptoeing his way to her and suddenly drops. I mean he had no trouble swimming down with Mero.</br>  <br>Hmmm.<br>Apart from Dr Hitomi, any other manga with qt cyclops girls?<br>I have a crave for bullying girls with one eye.</br></br></br>  <br><br> who is Papi, Doppel, baseform Suu, Manako, Lilith, Papi's Mom, lolisheep,  <br><br>And that's not even counting medium bust girls.</br></br></br></br>  Thread needs more best girl    Moray eel mermaid   <br> who is Papi, Doppel, baseform Suu, Manako, Lilith, Papi's Mom, lolisheep, <br>Among those only Papi really has a decent role, and she is only there to fill a token quote, and not even DFC.<br>Suu is a walking small girl shaming blob. having a "shitty unappealing not for lewd" small form, and "glorious, big tittied, superior, suddenly okay for lewd" large form.<br>There's not even really medium bust in the series, everyone is pretty large.</br></br></br></br>  Suu still needs a arc to deal with her past.<br><br>It probably is going to be the best part of the series when it finally happens.</br></br>  <br>I want her mom to be a cute granny who knits and shit that had a very wild youth.</br>  Is Centorea's voice supposed to be that deep or is the youtube video I'm watching changed its tone-pitch?  <br><br>Then post best girl.</br></br>  <br><br> Suu still needs a arc to deal with her past. <br><br>All 48 to 74 hours of it from before she met Darling &amp; company?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I was always under the impression that they were tiny, stubby fingers with little openings for webbing to ooze/squirt from. So more like sticking it in a vagina made from squeezing multiple squirting dicks together.</br></br></br></br></br>   zoomed in wet puffy loli nipples in TV <br>Thank you, Lerche. It's good to know that there is still hope.<br><br> edition <br>Oh god please no.</br></br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>How did she get there?<br>How did she discover Kurisu?<br>Where is her family/does she have a family being a slime.</br></br></br>  I missed the usual flood of threads today for the new episode.<br><br>Was everyone happy with how it got adapted?</br></br>   Daaijooobuuuu <br><br><br>HNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGG</br></br></br>  <br><br> How did she get there? <br> How did she discover Kurisu? <br>New slime created by asexual division.<br>Needs moisture.<br>Smells Miia's broth.<br>The End.<br><br> Where is her family/does she have a family being a slime. <br>It's unlikely that she has anything comparable to a "family".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>loved the extra family photos<br><br> tfw no little foal with your waifu </br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how the 5th pic is happening.</br>  <br>drone</br>  <br>Interceptors?</br>  <br>She's a 2m tall 1/2 ton Caucasoid with a large chest and a penchant for bold declarations. Shrill does not suit her. Miia could stand to lower her voice an octave or two as well.</br>  <br><br><br>I love these little slices of life!<br><br>... and since they did not choose the color choices I made for the objects in Suu body today, I hereby punish you all with this gif:</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really wish they would stop abusing that goofy "blank-eyed" stare darling has in every single fucking scene<br><br>what's wrong with his normal face?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Caucasoid <br> Centorea </br></br>    <br>The blank stare is just is care free look he only get those eyes when things get a serious or when Miia has her daydreams</br>  <br>I'm not hating it, I love it. I love MILF-like voices.</br>      <br>A better whore than Sakura? I don't think I can handle this.</br>  <br>Shioru, what did you just call Sakura?</br>  <br><br> you will never have that life with Miia </br></br>  <br>So they basically went to disney world</br>  I want to cuddle with Miia.  <br>Just where does this line originate from anyway? It seems like it's always said at least once in all manga.</br>  I found it somewhat annoying that the MC was drawn with blank "dumb" eyes 90% of the time this episode.    <br><br><br>It's been a long while since I've read the first several chapters of the manga… have those moments already happened by this point in the anime?</br></br></br>  <br>He has those eyes almost all the time in the manga.</br>  <br>right? like thats the worst part of the manga too. Dudes a handsome motherfucker, let him look like one</br>  <br>Bend forwards like if they had to pick up dropped objects.</br>  <br><br>MC doesn't actually exist. He is a blank slate to project yourself and your personality upon and with no eyes (one of the most expression based parts of the body) it further helps to put the male water in his position.</br></br>  <br>Just like the manga.</br>  <br>It's a cliche sexy housewife saying?</br>  <br> this episode <br>It's a trademark of the manga bruh. And you only notice the prevalence of his shellshocked expression by episode 4?</br></br>  <br> shaming small girls <br> best <br>No, fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Watcher**</br></br>  <br> Those thighs </br>  <br><br>Yes, if there's one thing I like to imagine having happen to me, it's routinely being brutalized with things like razor-sharp harpy-talons or horse-kicks to the chest.</br></br>  <br>Why is Mero so lewd?</br>  <br> Taller and wider than most Japanese manlets. <br> America-jin boobies larger than most porn stars. <br> Limited knowledge of Japanese customs. <br> And natural golden locks. </br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks bishounen as fuck here, damn.</br>    <br>Yeah, noticed that too. It's in the manga too but definitely seems more jarring in the anime.</br>  OH NO!<br><br>The MON squad knock on your door and need to use your apartment to listen in on a situation happening next door!

She wouldn't take the game too seriously, but I could see her being really good at it without any explanation.  She probably runs the JASA already. </br>  <br>Why are they making her chop onions with a mouse hat on?</br>  <br><br>Would using Fairies as Astronaughts offer any real savings on resources? Can you build a tiny space shuttle for them to blast off in?</br></br>  <br>How are they all sitting in the grass on their backs? Wouldn't that break the horse parts?</br>  <br>You want her to harden your death?</br>  <br>They can still move their upper body torso.</br>  <br><br>That grade-schooler has uncomfortably large breasts.</br></br>  <br>It would really help the fuel to weight ratio! I don't know how well they could handle g-forces, but it would leave more room for fuel and experiments.  The main benefit is cuteness. </br>  <br> Can you build a tiny space shuttle for them to blast off in? <br><br>You could probably attach them to a high-flying aircraft and launch them that way.<br><br>Problem is they'd likely burn up on re-entry.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she wanted to help cut the onions but didn't realize they would make her cry. Miia and Darling are having a hearty chuckle at the situation.</br>  <br>But vertically from the horse body so they make a straight line?</br>  <br> uncomfortable <br>Only for her back. And prudes.</br></br>  <br>Like bending forwards at the waist to pick something off the ground.</br>  <br>I don't see why not.</br>  <br>That doesn't explain the hat</br>  It would be cute if someone was given three catgirls to look after.  <br><br>I've never seen a centaur in fiction do that. Seems uncomfortable based on their shape.</br></br>  <br>Why does the hat need to be explained?</br>  <br> And prudes. <br><br>I think anyone would be careful around a 10 year old with D cups, anon.<br><br>Would be funny if she made the schoolteachers get self-conscious about their own size, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she likes to wear silly hats?</br>  <br>It seems out of place.</br>  <br> It would be cute if someone was given three catgirls to look after. <br><br> Ms. Smith is forced to look after three cat-girls <br> Bike Cop gets an overeager, overqualified Wolf-Girl fresh out of the police academy. <br><br><br><br>Are you suggesting Mini Miia is a touhou?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me. Why does she wear the hat?</br>  <br>It was a gift.</br>  <br><br>Because she has brain problems OK?!

Ms. Smith taking care of catgirls is hilarious. </br>  <br><br>What's that thing around Darling's neck? Just a nifty necklace, or something that has significance in Lamia culture?<br><br><br><br><br>The baby isn't brain damaged she's just airheaded okay?<br><br>Just cuz she isn't the smartest doesn't mean she's the dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Try pouring Suu down your Daughteru's ear because Suu fixes everything </br></br>  <br><br><br> on Miia's and Mero's date to the aquarium  <br> Miia also wore a silly fish-hat at the gift shop  <br>It's all fucking coming together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The second one is a tv series in the making. <br><br> One's a goofy veteran who knows the beat and the street <br> The other's a tough ace who plays by the rules <br> Together they fight crime   and go on walkies. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even as slime, the black is edgy.</br>  <br>DEEPEST</br>    <br><br>Black isn't edgy, it's tragic.</br></br>  <br>Would you take a wolfu  out for a walk? What if her idea of a walk was like Polt's idea of light exercise? </br>  <br> you'll never buy stupid hats for your monster family. </br>    <br><br> You'll never buy stupid hats for your monster family   because they weave them for free </br></br>  <br><br>I'd go for those walkies because the pay-off is worth it, dammit, I'll go for those walkies and at the end give her a headrub for being a good girl.<br><br> Who's a good girl? You are! Yes, you are! <br><br>Also I don't know how Kobolds are supposed to work, but many varieties of dog or wolf are pretty damn lazy. They love their walks sure, but after working on-foot I imagine a policewoman wolf-girl would want nothing more than to  lay on the couch and watch TV or read in a tank top and boy shorts, even if you were sitting there first. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dark/satirical comments <br> violent and hostile <br> black and red <br> not edgy </br></br></br></br>  <br>The class president in Centaur Worries had triplet catgirl sisters to take care of.</br>  Just got around to watching the episode. Suu is too god damned cute. Can't wait for full sentences.  <br>Mechanically, not particularly different from a horse nodding their head to eat grass.<br><br>Someone wrote a paragraph about a kindergarten teacher sobbing in a closet when she saw the minotaur, oni and centaur girls.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Innocent, childlike, slime minding its own business <br> Gets toxic waste poured into it <br> Now has no control over its actions <br><br>I just want to hug it better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>An anon on /tg/ made a setting where Centaurs and Humans co-evolved that sort of explains how they're so flexible.<br><br> And also how their genitalia grew or shrunk to accommodate their new potential lovers or spouses. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Horse heads don't ever go perpendicular to their body though. Not living ones anyway</br>  <br>So Minia will be cucking a Nezumi?</br>  <br>Your wolfu would be lucky to have you!  I would too. I generally don't like long walks, but with her it would be worth it. <br><br>Would she make a cute argument about why she needs the couch, or lay herself across you and grab the remote?  What she really wants is to be close to you. </br></br></br>  <br>If you've ever done a full 90° Japanese-style bow(chinbeards excused), it's like that. Except I guess since they're lying back, it's a bit more like the leg-raising exercise, or they twist their lower body to the side. Either way, lewd as fuck for anyone looking at the right time.</br>  <br><br> You come home from a long trip to the store <br> She sounds bored and disinterested <br> Even though her tail is thumping on the couch </br></br></br></br>  <br> But vertically from the horse body so they make a straight line? <br>It is pretty obvious they would have extra vertebrates thus allowing the human part to twist very far. And especially consider the possibility that centaurs likely have next to no organs in their human stomach, that can be a justification.</br></br>  I hereby renounce, on this day, my fagship to Rachnee. After reading the manga again, I hereby state my allegiance and love now is towards Miia.<br><br>She is the only proper girl for darling. Forgive me, but I need not your words for I have found the best.</br></br>  Can't wait for Suu vs Kii.  <br><br> Suu vs. Kii <br> Suu <br> Kii <br> Suu Kii <br> SuuKii <br> Suki </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tio is no slut. <br> She's a pure girl. <br>Yeah, that's pretty much canon. When Doppel did the gag with Manako's name Tio was confused. She didn't understand dirty jokes.<br><br>One element about Tio is that she is basically a little girl, loving sweets, animals, and frill dresses, in a very tall and strong body.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tio is an Oni, right?<br><br>Just give the girl some alcohol and watch her turn into a pushy asshole.<br><br>Also  you will never make the 7 meter girl into a 7 meter woman. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tio is huge but she's not 7 meters, she's 7.5 *feet.*</br></br>  <br>Would you bone the wolfu if she begged?  By that I mean taking her to an expensive restaurant where one of the courses is a bone with cooked marrow. </br>  <br>They're Papi and the Suu<br>Yes Papi and the Suu<br>One is a birdbrain<br>The other's made of goo<br>They are two monster girls<br>Their genes made twists and twirls<br>They're happy, they're Papi and the Suu, Suu, Suu, Suu<br>Suu, Suu, Suu, Suu, Suu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is she such a cute Kobold? <br>She is almost too perfect. The only reason it worked in the story is because she is basically a plot device. Polt is the nice girl friendly with everyone and helps you whenever you asked. She is rich, works hard despite her wealth, and does community service on the side.<br><br>If anything such a person would be hard to approach romantically. She is out of most people's league.</br></br></br></br>  <br> people pay hundreds of dollars to eat a bone <br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br> Manga where every girl is best girl and not even one brown monster in the harem. <br>Polt is pretty brown actually. We just didn't know until now because she wasn't coloured until recently.<br>The Devil was darker, and Doppel is darkest.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is the Elmyra of Monster Musume?</br>  <br>This made my day, anon. 10/10</br>  <br> She is out of most people's league. <br><br>Curiously, this mindset is usually the reason those types of girls are willing to have a broader range of potential partners than you expect, since most stay away because they assume they're not "good enough."<br><br><br><br>She'd think it was a cruel joke, anon! Just because she's a wolf-girl doesn't mean she prefers a bone over the nice, juicy steak.<br><br>Woofs like substance, anon  but she'd still be delighted if you took her out to an expensive restaurant, and would undoubtedly insist on paying half the tab, or pay you back later with a favor. <br><br>She's not a deadbeat, she's man's best friend!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be an extremely long esophagus, though.</br>  Spider when  <br> not KiiSuu </br>  <br>BUY THE BD<br><br> They're totally making short lewds Grisaia style </br></br></br>  <br> That would be an extremely long esophagus, though. <br>If it works on a Giraffe, no reason it can't work with other mammals.</br></br>  <br><br>Why is Kii green here but pink on her character sheet?</br></br>  <br> That god damn special with Yumiko, it made the anime an 10/10 for me. </br>  <br>...Thre's a Monmusme magazine now?</br>  <br>Ah crap, totally forgot about giraffes. And sauropods, too. Gomen, gomen.</br>  <br>The BDs for this show are going to be so good.</br>  <br><br> I'm not X, I'm man's best friend! <br><br>If a dog/wolf girl ever said that in this series or any series they would be Best Girl forever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Big is 大. Pronounced "Dai".<br><br>Big Suu+Kii=Daisuki<br> I feel like I explained this pun before a couple months back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty nuts. I simply crush any bones that have stewed long enough between my teeth, get that marrow and my calcium together.</br>  <br>Light reflection. We need someone to snap an unpacked one to know for sure, but the overall green from her leaf hair probably reflects light against the plastic wrap, which then reflects it again onto her skin.</br>  <br><br> I'm not X, I'm man's best friend! <br>Way to remind me of pic related</br></br></br>  <br>It's one part of a three course meal, and the bone is for decoration.  I know what you mean though. A restaurant near my city is serving starfish. I think it's similar to how art went from human shapes and recognizable scenes to Jackson Pollock. What defines modern food isn't always taste or familiarity .<br><br><br>Damn it! I would apologize for making such a huge cultural mishap. How am I supposed to  win her heart  if I can't take her out on a date?  At least I know an expensive steakhouse we can go to instead. I wouldn't let her pay either. She would need to invite me out somewhere and pay the bill to get even! </br></br></br></br>  Darling-san,<br><br>MON Desu<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wSR<wbr>ylVSfxyw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't handle all these memes.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.

How much does the anime cover in manga and LN?  <br>The LN serves as prequel to the manga. I think it's four years before the events of the manga. The anime doesn't cover any of it. (I'd imagine we'll get an OVA based on the LN or something eventually.) And right now, the anime has covered the first four volumes of the manga exactly.</br>  <br>Thank you, it seems translation of the LN has been abandoned, i guess i will have to try MT it?</br>  <br>Can't answer that question.

Will Yu wake up and go berserk or will Mika get him away safely? I don't want a repeat of last time as it's so rare for shit to even happen here.</br>  <br>smug thread?</br>  <br>Absolutely.</br>  <br>Yuichiro went berserk because he saw all of his bros getting their blood sucked, and he thought he'd lose his family again. I doubt he'll release his seraph again, ad on top of that Mika seems like he's starting to trust the Shinoa squad.</br>  <br>Option 1: Mika leaves a unconscious Yuu in a safe place and goes back to help the squad, arrives in time to be confronted by Krul directly wrecking everybody with her army<br><br>Option 2: Yuu wakes up and goes batshita asking where Shinoa and the others are, but can barely move. Mika promises to go back to help them because he owes them one anyway.<br><br>Option 3: No focus on Mika or Yuu. Full focus on the squad's battle against Krul army with Kureto finally arriving at the last minute and Krul recognizing Shinoa as being related to Mahiru</br></br></br></br></br>  Do you guys think Mika's every gonna become a proper vampire and drink human blood?  <br>I doubt it. Author has delayed it for so long I can't see it happening anymore. With the Shinoa-Mika trust thing now I also can't see him going full vampire.</br>  <br>I see Mika turning back to save them, the guilt was getting to him. Maybe he'll finally awaken his Seraph?</br>  I have an entire folder of her and I haven't even watched the show.<br><br>Maybe I should do that</br></br>  I'm watching this for Mika. Did this make me a fujoshit?  <br><br>There's a 50/50 chance he either becomes one or somehow goes back to being human<br><br>In the novels Guren's blood gets contaminated with a demon curse put on him by Mahiru, but it seems he was able to go back to being human (still not explained how) but his blood type changed from a type-A to a type-O. So considering Mika is part vampire because of the vampire blood Krul implanted in him there may be a chance to remove/replace it and make him go back to being human even if he becomes a full vampire</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have an entire folder of her and I've read the manga.</br>  <br>She alone could not redeem the show.</br>  <br>Unless you are shipping him with another guy, no. Is just husbando faggotry</br>  <br>She is also my wallpaper.</br>  <br>Is it just me that thinks he could have gotten away with kissing her? Like she would let him.</br>  <br>Naw. She's obviously in denial.</br>  <br>I just want Yuu to wake up and have a fucking normal conversation with Mika. I have a feeling they won't be the focus of the upcoming chapter but I just need them to talk it out and move on.</br>  <br>Dude, you say it like it was some kind of missunderstanding.</br>  <br>It was some kind of misunderstanding.</br>  I haven't been around for a wile, mika kill anyone on Yu's side last chapter?  <br>Nope.<br>As a matter of fact, Shinoa went out of her way to make sure Mika didn't get attacked by anyone on the human side.</br></br>  <br>Oh, anyone got a link to it?</br>  <br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Owari-no<wbr>-Serafu/Chapter-034?id=232374</wbr></br>  <br> still holding out hope of any romantic development <br><br>You must be new here</br></br></br>  <br>"I want to believe"</br>  <br>"hope"</br>  <br>Thanks</br>    <br>You're welcome.</br>  If Mika isn't the Seraph of the Beginning I'm going to be really mad.    This thread does't have enough Shinoa.  <br>I agree.</br>    I hope this will get scanned along with the 3 other Seraph doujins he made in the past    <br>What's the title of this doujin?</br>  <br>Kazoku BLOW</br>    <br>You lied to me.</br>  <br>But I didn't...?</br>  <br>Oh... sorry... google just isn't a good source I guess...

So, in the shower scene, did Shinoa and that blonde girl fug?  <br>(the blonde girl is Mitsuba, by the way)<br>Naw, I think it was just some friendly, no-homo breast fondling. Of course, Shinoa was the only one doing the fondling though.</br></br>  <br>October cant come sooner.</br>  <br>Most amazing blow job Yuu will ever have.</br>  <br>Machine translate</br>  <br> Shinoa was the only one doing the fondling though. <br>Because there's nothing to fondle on her?</br></br>  <br>That, and Mitsuba was obviously not into it.</br>  At least there isn't a love triangle in this, right? Besides the OTP who else is there?  <br>Aren't Shinoa and Krul, like, the only relevant girls in the series?</br>  <br>There's also Mahiru, Shinoa's sister who is now Guren's demon.</br>  <br>I know about her but doesn't she only appears in flashbacks?</br>  <br>She's shown briefly in the anime, but in the manga, she's mentioned multiple times, and shown a few times. She's also one of the main characters in the LN. (Which by the way, the LN is a prequel to the manga/anime taking place five years before the manga/anime.)</br>  New chapter when? i'm curious what faggot Mika will do  <br><br>I only read the manga, and half of it was in French which I'm only passable with, but didn't the Shinoa rival seem to have some slight (irrelevant) triangle going when Shinoa visited Yuu in the hospital?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I wouldn't call it irrelevant. There's a few scenes afterwords where Shinoa shows romantic interest in Yuichiro. They're rare, but you can tell that the mangakas are going for some gradual, believable, realistic build up for Shinoa's feelings towards Yuichiro.</br>  <br>She doesn't so much into Yuu or try to pursue him, the writer seems to ship her more with Kimizuki in later chapters</br>  <br>"She" refers to Mitsuba</br>  <br>Oh, not Yuu and Shinoa being irrelevant, I meant the other girl's thing for him was irrelevant.</br>  <br>Basically, yeah.</br>  More Shinoa.      short is best  <br>What did she see?</br>      <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=873<wbr>f2pGvzLI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  angry shinoa is cute too  <br>Why does this make me laugh so much?</br>  Fuck your Shinoas.    <br>Blasphemy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128747594 <br>Shinoa any day.</br>  Am I the only one here who absolutely loves the manga's artwork?  <br>anime art &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manga art</br>          Wow, this thread is still active?

Stayed for smug, loli vampire Krul and Gren.  <br>Gren?</br>  <br>Guren whoops</br>  Shinoa was born on Christmas.<br>Shinoa is the second coming.</br>  <br>Why the fuck did the mangakas give her a blood type?</br>  Sexy vampire  We still Shinoa posting?  I honestly feel like the reason Mitsuba is such a bitch is because her pussy is so tight that it physically hurts.  <br>Like... so tight that it starts to spiral in?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  Is this show worth it just for Shinoa? Even with bullshit magic arrows annihilating helicopters?  <br>I recomend the manga.<br> looks better <br> longer <br> actually gets kinda good eventually </br></br></br></br>    <br>He's gonna have to either go full vampire or find a cure. At this point vampire blood is no longer sufficient.<br><br>So his options are:<br> 1 - drink human blood and go full vampire <br> 2 - continue starving himself and become a demon, after which he becomes someone's new Cursed Gear <br> 3 - find a cure that will turn him human again <br> 4 - go full Seraph and end the world </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shitsurei, kamimashita!

He takes things surprisingly slow with her. I don't think he'd ever do her in the butt unless she suggested it.<br><br>Looking at the CGs in S, he sticks a finger in Mon's butt, but never sticks his dick in it. I can't tell if he sticks it in Wanko's butt or not from this, and I don't feel like checking right now. I don't think Tatsuko or Iyo get it in the butt either.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't actually do anal that much, I think. The thing with Mayucchi is that even if he doesn't stick it in her butt every single time, he's still overwhelmingly focused on it. He's almost constantly got at least one hand grasped firmly on those cheeks.<br><br>It's less that he likes to stick his dick in her butt (he does, but not constantly). He just likes to shove his face in it.</br></br></br>  <br>Some people are still butthurt about her crushing Wankos hopes and dreams in her ignorance. Also her JUSTICE can get annoying.  I like her though . But not nearly as much as some of the other girls..  </br>  <br>Both actually, loves to stick it in, loves to worship it and train it. The guy is true assman.</br>  <br>There's no real "default world".<br><br>Here are the following worlds.<br><br> Momoyo, Wanko, Miyako, Chris, Mayucchi, Tsubame, Fushikawa, Iyo and Margit all have their own closed unique off worlds. These worlds don't branch off into any other routes, although Tsubame's route has two paths depending on which of them takes the lead in the relationship. <br> "Hermit Crab" world, which has the possibility of branching off into the Yumiko route. <br> The "World in which Yamato works for the Kukis". Monshiro's route, as well as the maid routes in A1 and A3, all branch off from this world. <br> The "Agave" world, which has the potential of either branching off into the Tatsuko route, or Yamato remains single and continues living his days leisurely with the Kazama Family. <br> The "World in which Marple does some stupid shit" world, which I think can branch off into the Clone and China routes in the A series. This route branches off at the earliest point in the story, but it also has quite a few branches, it seems. <br> The "World in which Yamato finds Takae near a river and takes her in" world, which branches off into the Takae route in A-5. <br><br>The Kosugi route, I believe, is the only route which exists entirely separately from any world. It's a strange route which can only exist due to meta interference from the player. It's a route that's impossible in any of the established routes, but exists in its own separate continuity. In other words, Kosugi route is a literal miracle brought forth by divine (player) intervention.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know what's better than a S who's secretly an M?<br>The same thing, vice versa.</br>  <br>You know what is even better?<br><br>When characters don't make a 180 in their personality and just stick to what they were introduced as.<br><br>Fuck role reversal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yamato's usually an S but he can be an M if it suits his partner. Sometimes, he forgoes both and just goes at it normally, like with Yuki. Yuki's one of the few girls he displays pretty much none of his dominating tendencies with.</br>  <br>I would literally give anything if Yukie went full S.</br>  <br>Probably because she's emotionally abused from childhood, so Yamato only shows her love. <br><br>Miyako completely forgot about any abuse she had when she's with Yamato.</br></br></br>  <br>This, but M Momoyo and Margit are god tier.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>It's fine. We already knew Margit was a massive M ever since the first Majikoi.<br><br>Momoyo can be just as much an S as Yamato, but much like Yamato, she can reverse into an M if she feels like it. Yamato himself has more than a few M tendencies as well.<br><br>People's tastes aren't always straightforward. Even people like Momoyo might be fine with being dominated in bed.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is my heart fetish.<br>Reforming a cocky and rude girl into a nice person.</br>    <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Why didn't Yamato's semen unlock her full potential?</br>  <br>Wrong game my friend. He is not a ginger.</br>  <br>It unlocks Miyako's full potential.</br>  <br><br>Miyako is a special case.</br></br>  <br>With the power of spanking dat Kokoass nonetheless.</br>  <br> When characters don't make a 180 in their personality and just stick to what they were introduced as. <br>But it's not any kind of reversal of personality. Aggressive and outgoing people don't necessarily want to be aggressive and dominant in bed. Behavior outside of bedroom is not a very strong indicator of a person's sexual preferences. Momoyo, for instance, is submissive when it comes to sex, but she is still a fierce and dedicated martial artist as well.</br></br>  <br> Momoyo, Wanko, Miyako, Chris, Mayucchi, Tsubame, Fushikawa, Iyo and Margit all have their own closed unique off worlds. These worlds don't branch off into any other routes, although Tsubame's route has two paths depending on which of them takes the lead in the relationship. <br><br>But all can be reached from a single point and date. Unlike Koyuki?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Only works on Miyako because she loves him that much.</br></br>  <br>That's true, but there are also certain heroines who can only be reached by branching off from Koyuki's route as well.</br>  <br>Yeah then fuck characters who's sexual preference is anti proportional to their personality.<br><br>If a girl is a sub I want her to be an insecure, obedient pushover, and if she is a dom I want her to be an aggressive competitive girl like Momoyo. I hate it when girls bring me into the mood of one thing and then only enjoy the exact opposite.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he only fucks her after she gives up. <br><br>Also, the whole "no talent" thing is such bullshit. Lee was literally a normal guy, who trained a fuckload to become assistant manager. And Wanko can't do the exact same thing because .... reasons. It's literally retarded that Momoyo tells her to give up and it's even more retarded that Yamato didn't encourage her not to give up. Yamato wants to become Prime Minister and change an entire country that is currently shit, something that is so much more impossible than becoming an assistant manager. Yet he says nothing to dissuade her from giving up.<br><br>And Wanko settling to become a nutritionist instead of reaching her dreams is asinine. How do you fall from a martial artist character who's life revolves around training to becoming a nerd. <br><br>"Y-y-yeah, i'll become a nutritionist, despite the fact that I want to become a fighter. My dreams were crushed...m-mediocrity isn't so bad...I'm a nutritionist!! not a world class fighter" well done for settling for second best and not living your life to the fullest. <br><br>Fuck Wanko's route made me mad. It literally just shitting on her and trying to call that development. So glad the manga or any other route didn't follow that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay. That is a personal preference, not a real flaw in the characters. Personally I get absolutely nothing out of a sub who's an insecure, obedient pushover in bed or outside of it. That shit's just boring to me.</br>  <br>Lee probably had more talent than Wanko.<br><br>Apparently, there's a limit. You need a limited amount of talent to get that far. While Lee had less talent than Shakadou, he still had enough. Wanko can't even sense ki.</br></br></br>   A girl who's aggressive outside of sex HAS to be aggressive and controlling when she's having sex. Fuck her for doing a 180 on her personality. <br><br>Wow /a/, good to know you've never had a girlfriend. Even the most hard-ass people get mushy around the person they love. It's not a turn-around, it's called having emotions. <br><br>Never change.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, the whole "no talent" thing is such bullshit. Lee was literally a normal guy, who trained a fuckload to become assistant manager. And Wanko can't do the exact same thing because .... reasons. It's literally retarded that Momoyo tells her to give up and it's even more retarded that Yamato didn't encourage her not to give up. <br>Lack of inherent talent is not the only problem Wanko has. He also started her training later in life than most of the other serious martial artists in Majikoi. This is not something that can be completely fixed by training hard, no matter how long she trains. Some things just are easier to learn in earlier childhood, and someone who starts training at 11 or 12 can't necessarily catch up to someone who started training at the age of 5 or 6.<br><br> And Wanko settling to become a nutritionist instead of reaching her dreams is asinine. How do you fall from a martial artist character who's life revolves around training to becoming a nerd. <br>The fundamental core of Wanko's dream was her desire to support Momoyo and the Kawakami Temple. Becoming a world class fighter was supposed to be the means for achieving this end, not her ultimate goal. It's not so strange that she found a different way of achieving her dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> boohoo why do people not want their chinese cartoons be like real people? <br><br>If you enjoy real women so much then why are you here? Get the fuck out of /a/ and go on a date with your 3DPD slut or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off normalfag</br>  <br>I don't want this boring M shit</br>  <br>It wouldn't bother me nearly as much if the difference wasn't so absolutely extreme.<br><br>I don't mind when a somewhat aggressive or competitive girl like Chris becomes submissive but when they are introduced like Momoyo, constantly teasing, beating people up, being mentioned as the strongest fighter in the whole school flirting and touching girls left and right, it bothers me when they become a submissive blob in bed. The difference is just too high, it feels stupid to me.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>V I R G I N S<br>I <br>R<br>G<br>I<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's about wanting characters be like real people. It's about some people apparently wanting characters to be one-note caricatures instead of actual characters. That's basically saying that you actually prefer shitty, lazy writing over decent writing.</br>  <br>Where do you think you are</br>  Okay, so which character's do anal in this game, this is a deciding factor in it's quality.  <br>I don't see how it is stupid at all. Again, behavior outside the bedroom and behavior inside of it can be very different. There is nothing weird or unusual about this.</br>  <br>What are you going on about? <br><br>I'm talking about how it's not ridiculous for aggressive girls to be M in bed. Literal retards think that Momoyo can only be an S, when she can display both an M and an S.</br></br></br>  <br>I happen to enjoy the feeling of not being able to touch my waifu very much.</br>  The hottest thing was the common route where Momoyo and Miyako got fucked hard and Momoyo wanted him to train her ass.<br><br>Fuck that Majikoi has SO many fucking wasted potential god tier three/moresomes. Just think about all the possibilities. Momoyo/wanko. Chris/Miyako. Momoyo/Mayucchi. Momoyo/Benkai I could go on forever they all fit soooo fucking well.</br></br>  Real Duelists respect their cards AND their opponents.  <br><br>RURI A SHIT</br></br>  <br>Reminder that this is still according to Reiji's plan <br> send the strongest guy out to do labor first </br></br>  <br><br>GONGENZAKA A SHIT.<br><br> Though to be honest, he wouldn't be so bad if he had some character development or if this wasn't the Synchro Arc. </br></br></br></br>  Alright I just finished watching the duel due to getting finally being able to use the Internet. It wasn't too bad. I wish Gon Synchro Summoned something on his first turn instead of the Magnet play. Crow wasn't too bad I guess. Gon played Pendulums and Synchro but it was underwhelming. Not too bad a duel. Doesn't restore my hype though.  I finally realized that Yusei's deck eats through your hand like a motherfucker. No wonder he had to rely on angle baton and graveyard effects alot. Yuma's gagagas need another xyz monster. cowboy and samurai are good at what they do but they need a number  <br>Well Yusei's deck is also largely shit and useless.</br>  <br>I hadn't even thought of that, yes, keikaku right.</br>  <br><br>Dont bump this thread, we still have to go through the old one, let this one die.  Sage </br></br>  <br>Reiji a shit too. Go die in a fire, keikaku guy.</br>  <br> Bumping the early thread at page 8 <br>We were ignoring it for a reason dumbass</br></br>  <br><br>We had this exact same problem on /vp/.

All that stuff you mentioned can happen outside of more filler duels. The staff mentioned that the tournament is getting interrupted by Academia and Dennis reveals himself. Just a matter of when. Which is good because honestly it feels pointless. Academia invasion is a better way of making allies and shows proper Lancer capabilities in battle.</br></br>  <br> Make a post about how you aren't going to respond to something <br>But that doesnt make sense. Unless it isnt actually about finishing things, and you just want the last word?</br></br>  <br><br>But it didn't</br></br>  <br><br>Where is Crow there?</br></br>  <br><br>guys, please don't post a yugioh from an outdated season. nobody cares about the king of gets anymore, and surely nobody cares about 5 gets anymore.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd actually be disappointed if the tournament gets interrupted. Just once I'd like to see a tournament fully play out. Especially because if it gets interrupted early we won't get to see another Jack duel</br></br>  <br> that has so much fail.... <br>here is how to fill it.</br></br>  <br><br>I agree he has a good theme. Everything else though is anti hype. MESHI duel was stupid, summon chants are ok I guess. The Gon duel wasn't hype.</br></br>  <br><br>1. Nobody brought up a 5 GET.<br>2.

Learn to egao!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> wow receiving that blast from Against the Wind was pretty cool. I bet this card was created for the sole purpose of riding duels <br> remember Crow never used against the wind in 5D's <br> remember you couldn't use regular spells in riding duels in 5D's <br><br>Damn that was really a wasted opportunity. Against the Wind is a pretty hype card.

Brave Claw Revolution can only happen so many times before people get tired of it.</br>  <br> but if you dont like the rules we've all agreed on then you can fuck off <br>Um, I'm pretty sure we didn't agree on those rules.</br></br>  <br>I hate how Standard will eventually incorporate Action cards into all dimensions.</br>  <br>He could at least use Blaze Falcon or Revolution falcon.

That way it's way more realistic how you can have incredibly specific action cards and you can't just go for them in the last second but need to properly prepare them which gives the opponent a chance to react to them and change their strategy to accomodate action cards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pic related</br>  What if the real reason why Reiji doesn't wear socks because it hinders his chunni powers?  <br>Sorry that I triggered you, faggot.</br>  <br>That's cool, I hope we get actual kaiju references, it'd be a neat archetype petdeck.</br>  <br><br>Also<br> little brother NTRing you with your rival <br><br>is also part of his keikaku</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Socks aren't a part of keikaku.

No update for 2 weeks ;_;  <br>Yeah I feel action cards themselves are fine but alot of recent duels arn't as interesting to write using them. Incorporate more traps as well into duels tired of these strategies of just laying your monsters out and then grabbing an action card to make up for bad strategy.</br>  <br>read</br>  <br><br>If you summon it from your hand to their side of the field, then you'd have to have a second one in your hand to summon another one to your side, unless other Kaiju are summoned to your opponent's side as well.<br><br>Sounds like a shit card beyond the token effect, and tokens generally don't last anyways. Well so much for that archetype already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Check the thread.</br>  <br>His computer died or something. I'm willing to wait.</br>  <br>So it's based on getting rid of your opponent's boss by single-tribute Lava Goleming it so that your opponent has a Kaiju and then you can have a Kaiju.<br><br>Basically, you replace your opponent's monster with a Kaiju to have a KAIJU VS KAIJU BATTLE.<br><br>This is so retarded it sounds fun as fuck. And the "You can only control 1 Kaiju monster" seems like an indication they learnt from the Rulers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;you need to discard action cards to build up your action counters <br>That doesnt leave any time to stand around and ZETSUBO</br></br>  <br>You can grab 1 Spell and 1 Trap Action Card per duel. Action Cards are also tailored made for the field spell and not the two individuals decks, which increases the possibility of "I'm playing in a sea field, but I use fire monsters, this 'Increase all water monsters atk by 200' action card does me no good.</br>  <br><br><br>OK glad Mono isn't kill</br></br></br>  <br><br> Incorporate more traps as well into duels tired of these strategies of just laying your monsters out and then grabbing an action card to make up for bad strategy. <br><br>I'm actually okay with that. Yuya has shown against Enjoy that in regular duels he'd put Hippo in defense position to stall, but in Action duels he plays him in attack position to ride him so he can grab an action card to protect him which is more entertaining than to just it there and stall on facedown monsters. <br><br>It just gets annoying when they are able to spam Action Cards with no restriction whatsoever.<br><br>Then again the whole "riding your monster thing" is also non existant in Action Riding duels so that point is moot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently all the kaiju can be summoned on your opponent's field so.</br>  <br> Summon a low-ATK monster or token <br> Special summon that to your opponents side <br> Creature Swap <br><br><br><br>see<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, then that makes it a lot more convenient and better. Interesting archetype though I must say, I may have to try it out at some point.</br>  <br>Yeah it's just most of the best moment's of Yugioh are "TRAP HATSUDO" I think yuya does the "bet it all on action cards" best but when someone like crow does it it doesn't make sense.</br>  <br><br>It's not tokens it's counters. We don't know how easy it is to build them up. Might have some Yosen training ground type of card that just let's you easily built up your counters on summoning monsters</br></br>   you will never have a SoL episode where <br> Sora and Serena bully Sawatari to buy them snacks because he's rich <br> Dennis takes Gon to a circus <br> Yuzu takes Yuya to an orchestra <br> Shun, Ruri, and Yuto go bird watching <br> Reiji and Ninjabro teach Reira how to ride a bike with Yugo and Rin </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dennis seemed pretty concerned about Gon, wish we had more interactions between them they make a great pair. Their hero/villain duel was enjoyable.</br>  <br>You're right I misread it, my bad. It does sound like Yosenju mixed a bit with Dragon Rulers but dialed back heavily.<br><br>Sounds cool.</br></br></br>  <br>I always figured Sawatari would be the one to face Dennis in Academia, but I think it's gonna be Gon at this rate. <br><br>I imagine Shun will lose to him off-screen and Gon will step in before he's carded.</br></br></br>  <br> Token <br><br>Anon...<br><br>Oh and the first 2 sentences are probably general to all the arquetype<br><br><br>Creature swap plays are always fun.

The Manzais are pretty much all we get most of the most of the time.</br>  <br>And so far it's just been Serena being cute and Sawatari being a good boy and wanting to be friends with Yuya.<br><br>I feel bad for Sawatari, he's trying so hard to be Yuya and his friend and Yuya doesn't care, and he just keeps jobbing terribly.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Shun <br> &gt;Losing offscreen <br><br>Not like he didn't do that already</br></br></br></br>    <br>From /dng/, it seems like the field spell (Kaiju Watchout Tower or Tokyo something or whatever):<br><br> When cards are sent from the field to the grave, place one Kaiju Counter here for each card sent, up to a max of 5. <br> Once per turn, if this card has 3 or more Kaiju counters: You can add a Kaiju card from your deck to your hand. <br><br>Interesting thing to note is that, although the search effect is OPT (dunno if hard or soft) and requires 3-5 counters, IT DOESN'T SPEND THEM.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I can destroy Tokyo Tower in my children's card games <br><br>Yes, yeeeees</br></br></br>  <br>Despite his overtures to the contrary, both Sawatari and Dennis are vastly more dedicated to the Entertainment Dueling style than Yuya.</br>  <br> You can only control 1 “Kaiju” monster. </br>  <br><br>Sawatari only got into entertainment dueling because he secretly wants to be like Yuya in the first place</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, and I forgot:<br><br> If this card would be destroyed, you can remove one Kaiju counter from it instead. <br><br>So yeah, ironically it's the Kaiju (counters) that are protecting the tower.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will you marry a Ruri or a cardfu? Either way you have to procreate so you form a family or you get nothing.  <br>Konami doesn't understand Kaiju at all. What's next a pagoda is protected by Kaiju too?

That's about all.</br>  <br>If I pick Madolche Tiaramisu can I just rape the others?</br>  <br>Sawatari was more entertaining than Yuya was during that duel, he sold it well.</br>  <br>Only if she is into harem.</br>  <br>He tries so hard but his effort is always in vain</br>  <br>Gonna ask this, why people really love Serena too much? Is because of her personality, or her innocent POV at her age?</br>  <br>Nope, it's a Normal Trap card and nowhere does it say it needs nor has to stay on the field.<br><br>Nad it's not really that good honestly, as three battle phases is a bit much. And since it can only be activated in MP, this means even if you activate it in the opponent's turn he can decide to skip their BP.<br><br>Outside of Exodia Stall Trap, the only meta deck I can think of would be Nekroz, since they can stall time by ending BPs and can make use of clearing their own field.<br><br><br>At least it's send to grave instead of destroy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never understood people love for shortstacks fatties like her.<br><br>on that note I'd make love to Eria the water charmer</br></br></br>  <br>She's Yuzu, but even more crude and strong.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Goodbye Towers Turbo. Make place for GOZIRAA</br>  <br>That actually makes the card more interesting, if you can manage to last three turns, you can take a very big advantage, even so if they decide to skip the BP, that's giving you the advantage too. <br><br>It's actually a pretty decent card, it's certainly not Meta, lets be real here, but it's definitely a decent and interesting card by far.</br></br></br>  <br>no, real duelists just win all the by using the most broken combination of cards they can find.</br>  <br>Looks, personality, deck, naivety, everything.

Sawatari sees that there is a time and place for entertainment, and Dennis either uses it as his facade or tries to make a show of things due to his personality. Yuya wants dueling to only be for entertainment both for his audience and himself. <br><br>Jack was right, if Yuya isn't feeling it, if he's worked up or under pressure, he's not doing the entertainment thing for anyone but himself. If he wanted to entertain the crowd he would have attempted to survive the turn instead of throwing himself all out to win.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And if people fap with Monster Musume, why people can't fap with Queen Dragon Djinn?

But as far as I can remember there wasn't any time in Yugioh ever there's scene like pic related.<br><br>Is this what makes Yugioh and other chinese cartoon different?</br></br>  I wonder if anyone has ever topdecked a card they needed right exactly when they needed it and won.  <br> useless cards <br><br>Nothing in this world is useless.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to Sam and Neo New Sawatari</br>  <br><br>Serena and Yuzu have the same VA, so it's reasonable to assume the English dub will follow suit, especially since the English dubs have smaller casts.</br></br>  <br>What the hell did he do?<br><br>This looks like a play Judai would make<br><br> Is this actually a fucking manga based on Uno </br></br></br></br></br>  So, what will Reiji do when his bro doesn't want to fight?  <br> Why would a Pendulum card make a monster a tuner level 1 <br>Makes it easier to Trish</br></br>  <br>He will.</br>  <br>Replace him with Tsukikage, duh<br><br>Shun was right when he said taking Reira along was a bad idea<br><br>But in reality<br><br> It's all according to keikaku </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone pulled a Trish out on me and I was scared out of my fucking mind<br><br>No one told me that shit was unbanned</br></br></br>  Tuning Magician is definitely turning into a pendulum card to save Yuya's ass at the last moment<br>It'll probably have some level adjustment effect so he can tune Clear Wing with Odd Eyes</br>  <br> No one told me that shit was unbanned <br>It is quite frightening. I think I just did that some guy, I summoned it on his turn with Formula after he summoned an Aromage off of lonefire, and he seemed quite shocked and appalled</br></br>  <br>ENJOY</br>  God I just got this card from some black hair guy. Its pretty weak I bet he's a traitor who looks down on us common. The card is called effect veiler and it has weak attack and defense.  tell me /a/ will he ever set it?  <br>Sam pls, stop pretending we all know you cannot even read</br>  <br>Does he have yellow highlights?</br>  <br><br>Now we just need Brionac back.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and he has a criminal marking</br>  <br> Uno <br><br>Wasnt magic?</br></br></br>  <br> Brio <br> With Prince Atleantean Fucboi coming <br>Please no</br></br></br>  Why is Shingo perfect?  <br> Handsome <br> Literally undefeated <br> Lets a baka like Yuya come along on his adventures </br></br></br>  <br>Poor man's Manjoume</br>  <br>I love them both a lot, but Shingo's grown on me even more than Manjoume. I think it's because the show shits on him so much.</br>  <br><br>Well if the 3rd OP is anything to go by, Yuya and Yugo will be dueling at some point.<br><br>OP 2 was misleading and implied Yuto was going to be physically present to double team Reiji with Yuya, so OP 3 could be misleading by omitting Yuri joining the Yugo/Yuya duel and nomming Yugo.</br></br></br></br>  Yugi is a traitor because he gives out trash cards too.  <br>I'm glad they stopped flashbacking to this scene</br>  <br><br> With your power..give everyone...smiles <br><br>Yet he gave him an edgy as fuck dragon with names like Lightning disobey and Treason discharge for it's abilities. I wonder what happened to Yuto's deck. If it's anything like Speedroids I feel like it could be a fun one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuya's pendulum not glowing <br> DRXD glowing <br>What the fuck how did I not notice this earlier?

It was one of Reiji's finest pranks but Shun wasn't having it</br>  <br>It was only 1 (one) pendulum card, as one of Reiji's "jokes". He has changed his mind about them since then though.</br>  <br> Some <br>It was a single pendulum card, so it was useless.</br></br>          I just want to watch Reiji duel again<br><br>what the fuck man</br></br>    <br>I don't know anymore...</br>          <br> tfw you wanna draw funny yugioh comics but never have any ideas </br>    <br>What.</br>  <br>Artists are weird man.</br>  <br>NO SELENA!

I'm thinking:<br>Sawatari → Waits, he likes to put on a good show and needs an enthusiastic duel partner<br>Dennis → Waits, Same reason as Sawatari<br>Tsukikage → Attacks, Would use whatever means is the most efficient to accomplish the mission → Attacks, Same reason as Tsukikage<br>Reiji → Attacks, Same reason as Tsukikage<br>Reira → Wildcard, Would depend on his comfort level + instructions given by Reiji<br>Yuya → Wildcard, Would depend on his EGAO level</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  KAIJU!!!! Even though they better have some nice support. They all are different type and attributes. Will be fun nonetheless  <br>I'd laugh if it turns out the Synchro had another effect that makes him win because honestly it's underpowered now. Just like Sora and his Mad Chimera again.</br>  <br>Reiji's scarf makes my dick diamonds.</br>  <br>That's just Prepared Explosives, been in the OCG for a while.<br><br>Actually, if you activate in the enemy turn ASAP and no BP is skipped, it would be the enemie's on his next turn.

Yusei soon  <br>don't get your hopes up anon<br><br>only edgelords play Iswarm</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's a meme deck.</br>  <br>how so?<br>also Selena is the best girl.</br></br>  <br>Evilswarm Trish is my favorite incarnation of it so far.</br>  <br>It's just considered one of those petdecks that people hate or try to push too hard. U.A., Evilswarm, Lightsworn, HERO, etc. <br><br>It's just decks that people don't really like or generally have a bad community associated with them.</br></br></br>  <br>i can understand the bad community associated with them because only people ive seen playing a Iswarm deck are the 'neck-beard no fun for you shit talker"</br>  <br>HERO decks as well?<br>I never heard of them having a bad community.<br>on that note, I'm currently building a pure masked hero deck. any recommendations for it?</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly they do.<br><br>Yep HERO decks too, they get a lot of shit too because of the amount of cards they've gotten over the years and continue to. <br><br>A masked hero deck though, I mean you can build it in quite a few ways honestly, mostly people have 3 Shadow Mist, 2/3 Bubbleman, Summoner Monks, Goblindbergh (both at 2), Alius/Blazeman/Wildheart (whichever you feel like running or need, Blazeman typically). <br><br>Then you got shit like Reinforcement of the Army, A Hero Lives, Mystical Space Typhoon, Mask Change, Mask Charge (only at 1), Upstart Goblin, Forbidden Lance, Raigeki, Book of Moon, Fiendish Chain/Breakthrough Skill, Call of the Haunted, Oasis of Dragon Souls (1/2, preferred 1), and then a lot of the limited traps, Bottomless, Solemn, Ring of Destruction, etc. <br><br>Extra deck is usually shit like 3 Dark Law, 1 Anki, 1 Acid, Koga or Absolute Zero (depending on Alius or Blazeman or whatever), then Xyz shit like Abyss Dweller, Castel, Exciton, Excalibur, 101, Ragna Zero, Blade Armor Ninja, Photo Papillo (it can be swapped out for whatever), etc. <br><br>I mean it really depends on what you wanna run, because depending if you run more Summoner Monk and no Goblindbergh, you want more E-Emergency than you do Reinforcement, but more Reinforcement if you put Goblindbergh in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's nice to know that there are quite a few options to build this deck.<br>the image is what I've made and am currently using. if the deck looks like shit, it's because I've based it on cards that I currently own.</br></br>  <br>except those three XYZ's<br>those I've added a few minutes ago</br></br>  <br>Yusei is the only one without a partner  thats not Yusei-Go </br>  <br>I'd definitely remove Clayman and Airman and add in Bubbleman and some Goblindberghs and more Reinforcement. They really help out a lot, especially Goblin in getting to straight summon Shadow Mist from the deck, which gets his effect to get you Mask Change to get Dark Law out. Otherwise just tinker with it, I know there are a few builds here and there with stuff. I've seen some with Destiny Heroes that work well, others with random ass shit that sort of work, etc. <br><br>I'm sure you can find plenty around by goggling like Masked Heros july 15 decks or something.</br></br></br>   mfw Gongenzaka having to job for fucking Crow because muh kids <br> mfw when the lancers are looking like absolute shit right now and reiji is probably embrassed as fuck in front of those oldfag cunts <br> mfw Yuya will never be able to beat Jack's pompous face in because muh nostalgia or possibly a Yuri invasion <br> mfw I have no face. <br>arc-v pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it's Junk Warrior or Sonic Chick (which would've worked like Winged Kuriboh but that was passed on to Ruka.)</br>  <br>Nigga, Gon jobbed in a tag duel to make Yuzu look better by OTKing 2 people in one turn. That's like his thing.</br>  <br>Yes but Gongenzaka is a Lancer and with Yuya we have two losses on Reiji's shoulders. These fags are supposed to stop the second coming of Fusion Hitler and Synchro is probably face palming so hard. Please god let Sawatari win.</br>  <br>Its all part of the plan</br>  <br> Please god let Sawatari win. <br>That's even lower than Gon, especially if he's against Yuzu like one rumor says.</br></br>  <br>Id be happy with Sawatari winning but by Z-one Selena/Serena better fucking win her duel.</br>  <br>Can you even call that a job when he came up with a way for Yuzu to win and she's fucked without him. He doesn't care about giving others the spotlight so long as it ends the way he wants it to end.</br>  <br>Let them facepalm. It'd be nice to see their reaction when OERD tears up the stadium literally.</br>  <br>Blame BUY BLACKWINGS. It was Crow's first duel, no matter what he wasn't going to lose.</br>  what yu-gi-oh card would be this mans favorite?  <br>Selena is only winning if she gets fodder, Sawatari, or Tokumatsu. Basically everyone else wins if only by virtue of having their cards actually printed.</br>  Lets all get stands. use this website to create a stand http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~dft29/<wbr>Stand_Generator/Stand-Generation-Ov<wbr>erdrive.html<br>could be fun, if there is a decent artist they could draw some of the funner ones</br></wbr></wbr>  Stand Name: DOA (<br><br>Stand Ability: [Disease Generation](http://powerlisting.wik<wbr>ia.com/wiki/Disease_Generation)<br><br>Power - E<br><br>Speed - B<br><br>Range - C<br><br>Durability - C<br><br>Precision - E<br><br>Potential - B<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128731999#p128750006">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>God fucking dammit.</br>  Stand Name: Kill the Director<br><br>Stand Ability: [Needle Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Needle_Manipulation)<br><br>Power - C<br><br>Speed - C<br><br>Range - C<br><br>Durability - C<br><br>Precision - D<br><br>Potential - B<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128731999#p128750111">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I dont think its too bad.<br><br>I mean, assumably you can shoot a lot at a time, and your stand probably has its own needles.

Try actually thinking about things before shitting on them, and fuck off back to whatever shithole spawned you. <br>How about you get some fucking reading comprehension and critical thinking skills so that when actions and developments don't make sense, a simple "Well oh they said this so it's ok even if they don't follow it." isn't enough to suspend your disbelief, you idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  o***po  <br>It was practically rape</br>  <br>He didn't come, so it was rape.</br>  <br>She's cute, and has nice looking legs and thighs, I may have to pick this series up.</br>  <br>She has but one flaw: she speaks</br>  <br> Lesbian character <br> Not already ruined </br></br>  <br><br>Firstly, you're fucking stupid if you think that things aren't developing.<br><br>Secondly, I said that he is TRYING to avoid lewd things. He can't stop himself from liking girls, but he can (and would) get freaked out if one of them suddenly decided to mount him. Which is exactly what happened. His avoidance, again, is as much of a "paper thin excuse" as a priest's would be, which is to say, you just think he's a faggot because he's not you.<br><br> How about you get some fucking reading comprehension and critical thinking skills <br><br>Jesus fucking christ, listen to yourself. You're the one who's baselessly assuming that things make no sense before actually examining them. For the sake of your massive reading comprehension skills, I'll say it a third time: it's not a case of "Well oh they said this so it's ok even if they don't follow it", its a case of "well they gave a rationale for his behavior but he is developing and won't stick to it forever".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are too upset, you do know you're talking about anime right?</br>  <br>Oh wow</br>  <br>Now this is aspergers</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm not nearly as mad as the other guy was, assuming that none of you are him. Also, using epic 3D reaction images and tripcodes doesn't really help your case.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujin of her and Kuroko when?</br>    <br> Getting upset about 3DPD reaction images on /a/ </br>  <br> Notfitting <br>She is one of the best VA's</br></br>  <br>Those posts were plenty far apart for it to be the same person. Just let this shitty thread die.</br>  <br>Its fun fucking with him</br>  <br><br><br>No amount of image macros you spam can change the fact that you have no rebuttal. I hope you realize that the only one who is made to look stupid and angry by this is yourself.<br><br><br><br>Will do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol fag eat a dick</br>  <br><br>It was attempted rape at worse<br><br>sexual assault at best</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm about to hide this festering asscrack of a thread, but aren't you a little embarrassed to post a slew of "lel u mad" reaction images when someone disagrees with you? I'm not even going to say it's childish, I've met literal 6 year olds with more self-awareness.<br><br>Maybe next time if you're done with the discussion, leave. Hide the thread, or go to a different board. If you have more to say, but you're too angry to say it in any manner other than "YOU'RE SO MAD SO BUTTHURT SO WRONG FUCK YOU" then leave your keyboard for a few minutes while you chill the fuck out.<br><br>I don't even know how you could get so worked up about this without being genuinely autistic, so I hope you're at least getting a government check for your trouble.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>stay mad bro.<br><br>stay real fucking mad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please don't give him more ammo after I already dealt with him, he thinks you're me.</br></br>  Why do people like this type of humor?  <br>Still more intelligent comedy than "cuck" and Baneposting.</br>  <br>What show are you watching that has Baneposting in it?</br>  <br>If my dream girl did that to me, not only would I have came buckets, I also wouldn't have acted so cold toward her<br><br>That faggot deserves to be the aging bitter virgin, not me.</br></br></br>  <br>get fucked fagbat<br><br><br>because you are him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shimoneta?</br>  <br>I like her va and the 'little girl with a granny voice' character.<br><br>Fight me.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this a lewd hand gesture? I do this all the time without thinking about it, and have been for nearly 10 years.</br>  her voice makes my dick hard  <br>Are you Japanese?<br>Do you live in Japan?</br></br>  <br>No. Yes.</br>  <br>Would you do it if your best friend was watching?  I would. </br>  <br>To be fair, he thought it was going to be a stalker he had no relationship with, then he could see before she covered his eyes with her pantsu, then she realized who it was and got confused as to why she was doing something completely out of character.<br><br>He was more shocked then anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>Token loli, no fanservice, side lined, not relevant.<br>Don't pick the series if you aren't into big tits.</br></br>  <br>*Couldn't see</br>    <br>That wasn't the funny part you cad. Watch the rape scene. That'll arouse and amuse.</br>  <br>The character was fucking drawn for her you fartsniffer.</br>  <br>Woah, what an absolute spastic.<br><br>Seek help, aspy.</br></br></br>  <br>He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life and thought she was pure and perfect for her crusade against it, which is why he had a crush on her to begin with, and she just broke into his house randomly and tried to mount while acting crazy and not knowing what sex is or what she's feeling. It's like if you were a devout Catholic and wanted to date that shy honors student who didn't have a thing for you at all, and then she randomly tried to give you a handjob under your desk in the middle of class or something while salivating.</br>  <br>This. I've loved her in everything she's been in up until now, but she just doesn't work in this role.</br>  <br> He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life <br>no, his dad taught him otherwise. He's been pushing himself to believe that.</br></br>  <br>The government's been telling him it's evil, and he's believed them. Treat him like a Catholic from an atheistic family, if you prefer.</br>  Better question. What's the point of this thing?<br>She's not funny, her voice is shit, she's not attractive and looks more like a meth whore than supposedly a quiet person.</br>  <br> She's not funny, her voice is shit, she's not attractive <br>Are we talking about the same girl?</br></br>  <br>Character's design is shitty.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/dpmlhiyjki.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>Seen this on /f/ a lot, but I will still love whoever did this forever.</br>  <br>I want to give her a private lesson on reproduction</br>  <br>Would she still act all quiet and monotone in the bedroom or would she let it all out?</br>  <br>She'd be quiet first, trying to just understand it scientifically, then she'd lose to the pleasure from the dick and become a moaning whore addicted to cock.</br>  <br><br>Why are you still hanging around these threads if you hate the show, then? Fuck off from them.</br></br>  <br>I think it's more like her voice is featured too much in the ep and kind of plays out the novelty of it. Arai is fun as a side character since a hilariously weird voice gives such characters some well, character, that prevented them from being forgettable. Also she was most memorable going fucking nuts as Kuroko while she doesn't really hit the same extremes in this show since it's not the same character.</br>  <br>There's no easy way to say this... you have shit taste. With time and treatment, it may improve, but the more likely scenario is that you'll have shit taste for the rest of your life. I am so sorry.</br>  <br>Its obvious they did it on purpose<br>Maybe to prevent her from becoming a sexualized meme<br><br> implying you will still jack off to your obaa-san loli </br></br></br></br>  <br> prevent <br> that implication <br>If that's the case, then they did a horrible job.<br>By the way, please stop calling everything a meme or using a name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They really want people to stop sexualizing loli, and they are being successful at it.</br>  <br>Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays.<br>And I don't think that it makes sense to like Saotome for her loli traits, because after all the only thing she has is her size. I'll even go a bit further and say she isn't a loli at all. Tiny as fuck and amazing, but not a loli.</br></br>  <br>Or rather, scratch that, she's on her way to become a legal loli. How old is she anyway? Is there even a term for someone who isn't quite an adult but still looks like a loli? Legal loli or lolihag doesn't quite work in here.</br>  <br> Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays. <br>That's true, and your pic is related, since it shows nothing, as expected from anything "loli service". It is nothing.</br></br>  <br>This. Anna didn't know what a dick even was let alone have enough time to figure out how to stick it inside her. Though that doesn't change the fact that she is now a stalker, despite freaking the fuck out about being stalked herself just the previous episode</br>  <br>She's supposed to be a disgusting looking little runt midget so her voice is perfect.</br>  <br><br>I like you guys.<br>I know /a/ has lots of alpha males who wouldn't flustered AT ALL when a beautiful and "pure" girl suddenly aggressively wants their dicks.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably be horrified and pass out from the mental trauma it caused.</br>    I actually like it tbh  <br>In all honesty I wish this meme would die</br>  <br>Well, you and I are a pussy by /a/ 'standard', then.</br>  <br>never change, /a/</br>  <br>Lol fag</br>  <br><br>Nigga you got to remember, if they even try to do that shit, the bracelets they're wearing are going to trigger and they're both going to be locked in prison for the rest of their lives or some shit.</br></br>  nani sore  <br> lol <br>Fuck you mods for promoting this shit secretly and tumblr</br></br>  Which Symphogear the sexiest, /a/?  <br>Shirabe.</br>  <br>It's Garie!</br>    <br>Threadly reminder that Bikkie is a shit.</br>    Maria is quite clearly the sexiest, she has an adult body that's filed out in all the right places.<br><br>Any other answer is wrong unless you're a pedophile in which case it's okay to prefer Shirabe.</br></br>  Either Shirabe or Carol.  <br><br>All girls are best girls</br></br>  <br>You need to ask?</br>    <br><br>How does Tsubasa keep attracting and taming tentacle monsters?</br></br>    I will post this every thread until it's back.

Kanade died protecting people and saved who knows how many lives in the process, which is hardly what I'd call "dying like a bitch." It's not like she got beaten by noise, she just needed to kill a lot fast, which is something a spear is not suited for. <br><br> The real answer is she died because the plot demanded it </br></br></br>  I miss Fine<br><br>best villain</br></br>   P-please, anon, be gentle       <br>No.</br>  <br>I miss an MC who is not an intolerable, whiny bitch.</br>  <br>Best group.</br>    <br><br> old hag and three bratty kids <br><br>You are weird</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pet theory is Fine intentionally gimped Kanade because she required the gain of a swan song to activate Neushtan; Notice they barely get the needle to budge with the audience alone.</br></br>  <br>I know right, I can barely stand Tsubasa.</br>  <br>Shirabe is great.</br>  <br>Tsubasa did nothing wrong<br><br>She was completely right in being a bitch to Hibiki at the start</br></br></br>        <br><br>She looks so pure and innocent and defenseless there<br><br> I wonder what her orgasm face looks like </br></br></br></br>  <br>You should ask Miku, just send her an email.</br>    <br>She'd do that weird ass yell and make that face from season one.

Then Aoi just had to top that with SHIMFOGIAAAAAAH</br>  <br><br> a hot water bottle <br><br>The hell would she need a hot water bottle for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno. Women shit. I'm assuming for cramps or something.</br>  <br> We will never have this Bikki back </br>  <br>hot water is a bit much but warm drinks help with cramping issues and such.</br>  <br><br>you know what, fuck this. she's going to fight generic noise</br></br>  <br>Your perspective and proportions are fucked up.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Heat helps relieve the pain of the cramps<br><br>A heating pad works well too<br><br><br><br>Make it grape noise you nerd</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>threadly reminder the waterfall is a metaphor for miku's vagina.</br>  <br>seems fine to me</br>  <br> experienced <br>Now now anon, we all know you have to be a virgin to use a Symphogear  unless your name is Chris . Maria might know more because she's not an airhead like the rest of the Geahs, but she's still pure.<br><br> Or at least the hymen in her heart is </br></br></br></br>  <br>what's grape noise</br>  <br>You mean a metaphor for my vagina during that scene.</br>  <br>It was actually the clue that Garie was around. Yeah at first you're like "lol Miku so wet right now" but once you realize it was Garie making the water the scene is a lot more grim.</br>  <br><br>You can't be serious</br></br>  <br> Make it grape noise you nerd <br><br>This!</br></br></br>  <br> what's grape noise </br>  <br> I don't know about sexy <br>Get a load of this fag. They're the sexiest.</br></br>  <br>oh that, i actually forgot about that one</br>  Seeing how GX episodes follow the "despair -&gt; HOPE -&gt; action -&gt; SoL -&gt; happening -&gt; HAPPENING -&gt; THIS FUCKING ANIME" pattern<br><br>maybe next episode is "Hibiki took extreme damage while in sync state, she might not waking up again!" -&gt; no imma waking up, start working on my upgrade now so I can start fisting them hard -&gt; Shirabe transformation and DMJii sortie as Micha attacks them, before relic released due to low sync rate -&gt; back to school -&gt; Leiur giant "imouto" attacks the SONG base -&gt;  Genjurou have a punchout with the giant </br></br>  <br>Kinda want me to see the gaijin reaction with "water" bursting in the background<br><br>That reminds me I didn't get to save the reactions so far, anyone mind posting it?</br></br></br>   C-cute? You really think I'm cute?   <br>That spoiler. Now THAT'S something I want to see.<br><br>But honestly, I'd rather see Miku captured and Bikki in utter despari without her or her gear, and then DMJii + Maria have to step in while training montage for Ignito modo ensues.</br></br></br>   Heeeee! See, Tsubasa-san! I can be sexy too!     <br>It's a penis joke. That's all that matters.</br>  <br><br>What are they looking at?</br></br>  <br>MIKU<br>I<br>K<br>U</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, so would I.</br>  <br>Miku and the anime brigade just walked in.<br> Wait a second, this isn't what you think it is, I just tripped <br> Hibiki how could you <br> This is just like my anime </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop posting that in every thread</br></br>  <br>Oh my god! Literally what the fuck is that?! I think I'm gonna puke.</br>  <br><br> Forgetting the best noise </br></br>  <br> training montage for IGNITO DATO modo <br> this time Maria Shirabe and Kirika join them <br><br>Genjurou will handle them like usual<br><br>but will Elfnein crammed them inside a classroom and be the brain of the training session, including teaching them the possible danger of overusing the Ignite mode, principal behind Ignite upgrade, and possibly fundamentals of alchemy? I want to see everyone confused as fuck their eyes turned swirly/blank when shown long-ass maths</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I've been itching to get into this series, but the only subs I can find are Commie, at least for Season 1 and G. Anyone know of anything better out there that I'm not finding?  <br>Elfnein says: The key to victory is  Wisdom and Tactics <br><br>I might just lose my shit.</br></br></br>    <br>Dmonhiro also did S1 but Commie is the only choice for G. Make sure to get the BD version.</br>  <br>I have the Reinforce BDrips. I dunno. Look harder.</br>   Want to kill myself <br> Can't because I want to watch the next episode <br>Fucking Symphogear cliffhangers</br></br>  <br>Anime doing their part</br>  <br>You're mostly fucked for sub choices. There is a group that plans to redo the first two seasons with correct terminology but that won't be until after GX finishes.</br>    <br> Hibiki sleeps in Elfnein class on what's the principal behind Carol's alchemy and how do they work <br> Tsubasa get blank eyes in Elfnein class about how to predict Phara's sword swing arc and how to counter it <br> Chris get swirly eyes in Elfnein lesson about how Leiur shoots coins and where is the possible blind spot <br> Kirika and Shirabe pretend to understand Elfnein lesson about Micha combat prowess and abilities illustrated by long-ass maths and detailed anatomy <br> Maria's brain fried in Elfnein class about the fluid mechanic and how condensation works in order to anticipate Garie's attack and identify the water doubles through air humidity <br><br>Get on it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes I need another one of these.</br>  <br>and  all the girls wearing glasses because anime-chan tell them to </br>    <br><br><br>I guess I'll just suck it up for now and rewatch the series when better subs come out. Thanks anons</br></br></br>  <br> FB <br>Just stop posting. Come back when you've finished both series.</br></br>  Body-swap episode with the girls having to swap around Gears to get them to work when  <br> Tsubasa swinging Ichaival crossbow/minigun as if it's her sword, breaking it repeatedly <br> Chris slips and fall in Shul-Shagana, because she never rollerskate'd <br> Shirabe attempt to poledance with Igalima scythe, ended up enjoying rubbing against it <br> Kirika crashing into walls in Gungnir because she's not used to rocket-assisted, catapult-powered greaves <br> Hibiki keep tangling herself with Airgetlam blade <br> Maria keep polishing the swords <br><br>I'd watch it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  H&amp;D FUCKING WHEN?  <br> Hibiki getting fed up with how out-of-shape Chris is <br> Tsubasa complaining about 'this isn't how swords are supposed to work' with Maria's body <br> Maria angry about being unable to summon a spear as Hibiki <br> Chris flailing wildly with Kirika's scythe <br> Shirabe failing miserably to wield any of Ichaival's guns, the recoil knocking her flat on her ass <br> Kirika reverse-gripping swords in a vain attempt to emulate scythe-motions <br><br>Having them keep the gears their body were tied to would almost be more fun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it's water pooling on roof from the rain.</br>  <br> Tsubasa experiencing for the first time what it's like to not have a flat body <br><br>That would be highly enjoyable</br></br></br>    I just started the first season. Is berserk Hibiki supposed to be this erotic? As soon as her face goes dark and she starts grunting I just kind of lose track of everything.  <br>the music comes from their gears idiot</br>  Carol can fly right  <br>Pretty sure the whole bullying thing overrides anything else.</br>  <br>Her hat's probably just filled with helium, that's why it's so big.</br>  <br><br>Miku's holding the camera you dorks.</br></br>  <br><br>Enjoy your new fetish.</br></br>  <br>All 2hus can fly.</br>  <br><br>You tried.</br></br>  <br>Villains aren't supposed to be this cute.</br>    <br>Is this a reference to something or are they just being delinquents?</br>    <br><br>Dominant sexy evil and incompetent crazy maniac had already been done.</br></br>  <br>I would become mates with Anime-chan, but I want to marry Mantis-chan.</br>   Girls basically whoring themselves in a promo picture <br>Why is this allowed?<br>Have we become so brain-dead that anime producers have to bait their audience with cleavage and sexually suggestive pictures in order for them to watch it?</br></br>  <br>Yes. It's happening with every show now.</br>  <br>That one was the worst. I came for the trains but left due to all the unnecessary boobs that they were trying to shove down my throat</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br><br><br>The quality of promo pictures has really become worse while the fanservice has been increased a lot, pic related.<br>It's best to not consider them "official" art anymore but more like fanart done for magazines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she still has a shapely body even if she is acting like a raging animal.</br>  <br>Those cabooses really heated my boiler tubes, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br><br>The appeal is that of watching a storm.<br><br>You know at any moment, she'll turn to you and make your entrails extrails... but in those carnivorous fangs, that fell energy, the pose of a predator, You secretly long to feel her pour that wild emotion into you. It would almost be worth exsanguination.<br><br>But enough about that. Bikki is sunshine and happy thoughts right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's one of those don't watch the show, fap to the fanservice shows for me.</br>  <br>Megami and NyanType's editors always make such requests to anime studio. It's not like anime staff prefer to draw lewd promo pic, but it depends on magazine's editor's decision. If you want some cool promo pics, Newtype magazine is a better choice.</br>  <br>I wouldn't need any encouragement to climb her mountains.</br>  <br>Megami and NyanType magazines' are for moe otakus. <br>Newtype is a general anime magazine.</br></br>  <br><br>I posted it to show a case of bad official art though, boobs don't work like that, anatomy doesn't work like that.<br>But maybe it needs a more blatant example.</br></br></br>  <br>It isn't. That's after the scene where they tell that Elf9 doesn't have a vagina, so it's more a vagina joke than a penis one</br>  <br><br>Commie butchered it. To forde the "down there" they changed their math topic from luck and probability to fractions. However it makes no sense to say "it doesn't matter if there's nothing down there" because for fractions it fucking does matter. The actual thing Miku was saying according to CR was that it doesn't matter if luck is there or not regarding probabilities, but there's no way to put a "down" in there.</br></br>  <br><br>I hate to defend Commie, but I've yet to have seen an translation I liked on that line.<br><br>I remember a similar one way back with E7:AO where no one had a clue how to get the wording and intent across at the same time. Sometimes translation just doesn't work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By this point using Commie subs is traditional with Symphogear, it wouldn't feel right otherwise.<br><br>And it's not as if the other sub groups are really any better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If there was a clear "winner", I'd be using someone else. The problem is that Commie is consistent. They'll fuck with the script, but we all can tell when they're doing it.</br></br>  <br>So Miku and the others were talking about math and Hibiki took what she said the wrong way since she had Elf9 on her mind? Or something like that?</br>  <br>Well, the joke is still understandable without emphasis on "down", yet mathematically Commie's translation makes no sense.<br><br><br>For you maybe, I switched to HS as soon as I could. I know that CR also make blatant translation errors sometimes, so sub-wise it doesn't really matter, but it's in 1080p and it's fast.<br><br><br>Yeah, MIku said that regarding probabilities it doesn't matter if luck is there or not and Hibiki just thought she was talking about genitalia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't understand why they felt the need to translate Ame-no-Habakiri into Heavenrend, that's not even what Ame-no-Habakiri translates to.</br>  <br><br>Tsubasa doesn't understand either.</br></br>  <br><br>They're doubling down on stupid.<br><br>I don't really care; It's not a big enough deal for me. At this point, it's funny to watch how much effort they waste to "correct" it.</br></br></br></br>  Did this get updated yet?  <br> Tsubasa <br><br>I think you mean Wing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You asked for it<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XqB<wbr>WvmhS-AY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I still like the idea of<br>Left panel : Garie kissing Micha<br>Right panel : just the samuraigaijin (no Nana) with one holding SU TO RU GA NO FU<br>more than current one for EP3</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the shit right there.</br>  <br>Oh god my sides.</br>  <br>How else are retarded Commie devs like Xythar going to act like authorities on translations without knowing a lick of Japanese?<br><br>They have to change things so they're mentioned here and screencapped/posted on Twitter otherwise their game of 'I know Japanese' pretend wouldn't have the slightest hint of validity</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Well fuck me, this works way too well.<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/jwucwibtpb.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wing makes everything better.</br>  <br> those three bleeding Marias <br> that Miku in the back <br> that Garie in the front <br><br>10/10, perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OG Gungnir.<br><br>If we're talking still alive, then Maria.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never rest your head in all that fluff </br>  <br> you will never be either person in this image <br><br>Shit, that one cuts deep.</br></br></br>    <br>I enjoyed that way more than I should of.</br>  <br>God damn</br>  <br><br>How about some higher resolution?</br></br>  <br>I want all of that on and around my face at all times from now on.</br>    <br> Carol's VA was born in 95 <br>I feel old</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> Sawashiro, Hikasa and Ayahi are the same age <br>Wait what?</br></br>  <br>It's nice that Hikasa gets to play someone her own age.<br><br> I'm exactly one month older than Aoi <br>Feels comfy.  I'm such a failure. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Aoi Yuuki is 2 years older than Maria.</br>  <br> Nana Mizuki is one year older than me <br>Incroyable</br></br>    Maria fans are so sensitive.  <br> trying to start girl fanbase wars </br>  Why doesn't Hibiki have attack cards? Even Ogawa has them now  <br>I'm not, but you can't bully Maria without someone piping in with a no-fun retort.<br>It's just something I've noticed since GX.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't have an armed gear.</br>  <br> Hikasa's birthday is a day before mine. <br>Feels good, man.</br></br>  <br>That's mostly because Maria has actually been pretty damn competent in GX so far.</br>  <br>Miku's the one who needs Elfnein's alchemy training.</br>  <br>I was one of the people who liked her and still kept calling her useless in G but it's just not fun and forced now when she's actually useful.</br>  <br>Ogawa doesn't even have a Symphogear and he got one<br><br>It's not fair</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you people pretend that they even know anything about Symphogear?</br>  <br><br>Because it gets annoying if your favorite characters get shat on all the time.</br></br>  <br><br>She has been good in GX, but bullying is always okay.</br></br>  <br>Bullying is only fun when it's based on the show.<br>You could bully her weird tentacle cat hair.</br></br>  <br>She's also the only one in the main cast who seems smart enough to understand Elfnein's lecture.</br>  <br>If you look at Zoids twitter he was in Tokyo winning bids on a bunch of Symphogear stuff, so the episodes delayed this week.</br>  <br>Must be nice.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter what you "like" when discussing the accuracy of a line. There is no "down there" in Miku's statement, the entire joke comes from Hibiki having dirty thoughts due to the conversation in the previous scene.</br>  JoJo thread. "Who is part 8's villain?" edition  <br>posting for best joestar</br>  <br>Johnny is best Joestar m8</br>  <br><br> Gappy is the best </br></br>  <br><br><br>That's not how you write Josuke and Joseph</br></br></br>  I just finished Stardust Crusaders S2, is JoJo gonna continue? Does it sell well in Japan to warrant a continuation since I've seen people wanting Part IV.  <br>Probably, wait until december, now get out before you get spoiled.  Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time </br>  Is Kars ever coming back ?  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Well gee I don't know that manga has been running for 25+ years, sometimes tells me that I might be.</br>  <br>read the manga<br>The first three parts really aren't that amazing and imo none of the parts can really stand up to 7 or 8 which would take many years to get animated</br></br>  The cleric of homosexuality has arrived  I wonder if Johny would've used the stone mask for his own benefit if it existed in his universe. I mean, he was a selfish person, and most of his actions were for his own benefit.  Just finished part 6. What the fuck.  Just finished Italian Jojo, this nigga gonna die forever? savage shit right there god damn    Post pictures of Joubin  Post some of your favorite panels, I really like this one.  <br>No, just because Gau {roest has been stopped for now, doesn't mean it's bus time</br>  Dick is alright, but have you tried putting a refreshing 7-up in your mouth?  <br>I got a lot of them, I only have them saved as the pages though</br>  <br>the fuck? how'd I manage to spell Gay Priest that badly</br>    Spoilered for part 8 twist    <br>Yep.<br><br>Yep.</br></br></br>  never ever  <br>This my favorite.</br>  <br>dubs speak the truth<br>hopefully Gappy will stay awesome</br></br>  <br>I'm confused, people said that the binder full of women was the stand user that Kira made eat their own fingers, but now I remember that it's this panel that made me think it was Kira's binder.<br><br>Which is it?</br></br></br>  <br>The stand user tells Josuke it was him</br>  <br><br>I made it larger for shits and giggles.</br></br>  <br>Big Johnny is still the best</br>  <br><br>No I just legit want more pictures of Joubin</br></br>  <br>He stopped rationalizing. I think that even if he managed to land into a planet/star, he wouldn't notice it</br>  <br>Thank you anon</br>  <br> stand </br>  Are the corpse parts of the SBRverse the equivalent of the stone mask for the original universe?  <br>him as in the stand user, not josuke?</br>  <br>Really really really want to know? <br><br>well... <br><br> Morioh Town has a Stand </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L6S<wbr>2Tj-3nmw</wbr>  [ ]<br> CHEW </br></br></br>    <br> Part 4 never <br>Part 4 will happen, part 7 won't</br></br>    <br> John Joestar 16:33 </br>  <br>With how fucking weird the series is now, I wouldn't be surprised.<br> NEW STAND, MAGIC MAN: BRINGS BACK OLD ENEMIES FROM THE JOJO SERIES <br>would work, similar to Bohemian Rhapsody</br></br></br>  <br>What chapter is this from?</br>  I kind of don't want part 4 to happen because animeonly fags  <br>when he's in the apartment with the naked chick.</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty cool idea, but would make for a shitty final villain i feel</br>  With the direction part 8 is going, you think we'll see Gappy's four testicles? Or will that be a no-no for the publication  yfw you have no bros to journey toward Cairo on land with.<br><br> It causes me grief beyond words </br></br>  <br>When he put that dude through a glass table?</br>  <br>The World confirmed to be Johnathan's stand</br>  <br>They're more of the Stand Arrow equivalent because the parts bestow Stands on the people who get them.<br><br>The only other way to get a Stand is to be born with it or basically achieve the Golden Rectangle Spin.</br></br></br>  I still have no idea what Pucci's Heaven is. So it's a world where... people can see the future, but he can't?  <br>It's a world with no surprises.<br><br>A world where everyone is subconsciously aware of everything ahead of them. Also a world where only he has full control over what "Destiny" is.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone in the world will know what happens to them, and must face it. However, the holder of『Made in Heaven』has the power to change fate.</br>  <br>Fate is an actual thing in Jojo, Pucci's heaven would just make people aware of their fates but they're unable to change it. Basically everyone is Zeppeli in PB.</br>  <br>Only without the great hat.</br>  H OT P A N T S  <br>Are you dense?<br><br> it's still Kira, Kira hid in Josuke to mask his identity, but he'll come back later </br></br></br>  <br>Kira's dead dude</br>    So since the dub is giving the English characters their proper accents, does that mean when Stardust Crusaders is dubbed, Jotaro will have a proper Japanese accent?    <br>Too lazy to crop a panel.</br>  <br>Nah mane<br>Canonically he's speaking japanese<br>The only reason the other jojos have accents is because they're canonically speaking british english<br>It's pretty obvious</br></br></br></br>    <br>So what you're saying is that, to get the truest experience, I need to watch the dub for the first two parts, then the original Japanese for Stardust Crusaders? Makes sense.</br>  What page or scene brought you into JoJo?<br><br>I thought from a page with Ringo that he was a big bad when someone posted SBR in a OPT</br></br>  <br>clearly</br>  found these on infinite  <br>No. Everyone is in permanent Thoth mode unless Pucci gets involved.</br>  <br>the first thing I remember was the OVA Jotaro vs Dio fight when I wanted to know where ZA WARUDO came from some time ago<br>but I didn't come into the series until a month ago after I stopped myself from reading the wiki</br></br>    <br>Post any cosplays of characters from Parts 1 to 4.</br>  <br>I was brought into JoJo by my friend saying "It's a good series, fits your tastes" thats it</br>  <br> I thought from a page with Ringo that he was a big bad when someone posted SBR in a OPT <br><br>He isn't just a minor villain, he serves a purpose.</br></br></br>  <br>At the beginning of part 7? In a heartbeat. I think Araki tried to create some parallels between him and part 1's Dio.</br>  <br>I honestly don't remember how I found it, but when I did and started   watching   it I realized that it was the   anime   that my roommate had watched before that I never payed attention to/thought was stupid. I think he found it from a Twobest friends playthrough. Chances are I saw it on a reddit post, but I don't really know.</br>  <br>The thread I got these from doesn't have much</br>    <br>the Joseph in that scares me</br>    <br>This stunt was the peak of part 4 for me.</br>      <br> AWAKEN MY MASTERS </br>  <br/>  <br> inb4 Guido Mista </br>      <br>This again.</br>  I want to cum inside Hot pants.    <br>Sure, but he's not the Big Bad of SBR, that's Valentine</br>       leave Wham to me     this fucking thread   <br>What happened to chiza ?</br>  <br>Nigger you lost to a pigeon</br>  <br>Why can't lardpeople understand who they can and can't cosplay well</br>    <br>Gettin real tired of this Jolyne</br>  <br> homestuck  <br>get the fuck out</br></br>   best thing in part 5   <br>I want to cum inside Pucci!</br>  <br>What flat looking fanart.</br>  <br>Stop that! Pucci is Pure!</br>  So the Rock guys in jojolion are the new pillar men  <br>Pretty much. Just not as cool and fabulous though.</br>    <br>Why anon ?</br>  <br>Terrible. Even the Jolyne sucks. They should just stick to part 5 characters.</br>  <br> tfw araki is a serious writer now and won't do anything like the Pillar Men again </br>  <br> Who is part 8's villain? </br>  <br>I feel like he did evolve as a character greatly, while still a bit selfish with his goals, his actions were selfless unless his dark determination kicked in.<br><br>The only time his selfishness kicked in and was really bad was when his wife, one of two people he loved the most was dying, and he didn't care who else got the disease as long as it wasn't her.<br>Then it bounced to his son, causing him to sacrifice himself to save him.</br></br></br></br>  so in the viz release of stardust crusaders, does joseph still say HOLY SHIT?  <br>I really like this one</br>    <br>The meteor exists in sbr also</br>  <br> tfw it could be Funny Valentine again </br>      <br><br>Pillar men= /fit/<br>Rock men= /fa/</br></br></br>    <br> confirmed gay sex <br> pure <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Not this time... <br>I'm on break</br></br>  <br>You're weak. Defiling Gay Priest only shows you have no shame.</br>  Is it wrong that I could only imagine Josuke and Okuyasu's voices in Part 4 as  the English dubs of Yusuke and Kuwabara from YuYu Hakusho ?  <br>Some day I'll destroy you</br>  <br>It's super fitting though</br>  <br>I did the same with okuyasu, but gave josuke the voice of Walter from SMT4</br>  <br>You chose the wrong meme to try to defeat Gay Priest with. <br> He'll only submit to DIO. </br></br>  <br>I like how Black Sabbath seems to pay tribute to The World here.</br>  <br>I can only imagine it as this guy https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x6W<wbr>EXvwGREo</wbr>  [ ]<br>I always pictured Okuyasu with a pretty goofy ebonic accent, but I see most fan shit give him a rough voice.</br></br>    <br>don't you mean, HermitPurple_arrives.png ?</br>    Let's talk about That Man,  Jobin     <br>Let's talk about Lucy, why did she become a cunt?</br>  <br>What's the stand power?<br><br>I already know it screams REEEEEEEEEEE during its rush attack</br></br></br>  <br>how are norisuke, jobin, and lucy hanging out together?</br>  <br>It has the power of making you shit uncontrollably. it's the perfect power to stop shameful protagonists</br>  <br>Stando power!</br>  <br>How  rare  is it?</br>      <br>Nah man it shoots spaghetti from people's pockets<br><br><br>Cool art and I love the name</br></br></br></br>  <br>nah that's this stand's power</br>  Do any stands use a spear or lance as a weapon?<br>I'm trying to draw something like it</br>    <br> You thought it was Jojo?

But what about the cast that died during it? Do the ultimate versions of themselves contain their souls or are they different but very similar people with their own souls?<br><br>F.F's little arch would hint to me that it isn't them and they're actually dead but I'm hoping it's not the case because it weighs greatly on how much I like the part.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ultimate <br><br>I mean alternate. Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The people who were killed by Pucci in MiH are dead. Completely dead. Those people that looked like them are not them but that universe's replacements. They're not reincarnations, they are new people.</br>  <br>This Iggy.</br>       yfw pucci lost   <br>Is that Araki as gay priest?</br>  <br>Atleast he died for the love of his life.</br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck is this, how could anyone think it was a good idea to dress up as Iggy?</br></br></br>  <br> They're not reincarnations, they are new people <br>Irene and the bunch sort of are reincarnations, that's why they're not all weird-looking like the Jolyne and Jotaro from the second universe.</br></br>  Doc have you done work on this pic yet? Like transparent background  <br> Irene and the bunch sort of are reincarnations, <br>No reincarnations would they have the same souls. MiH stops that from crossing over. Irene just happens to not look as shit as Joleen.</br></br>  <br>I'll make it transparent if you want, but is there a bigger version available?</br>  <br><br>Jotaro's only love. It's why it didn't work out with Jolyne's mom.</br></br>  <br>I like the Johnny</br>  tfw reading the manga strains my eyes so have to wait for part 4  <br>Just cropped it from the JoJonium cover, don't think so</br>  <br> reading the manga strains my eyes <br> strains my eyes </br></br>  <br><br><br>I can't find a larger res of the cover (830 × 625 being the biggest), this will have to do for now.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah i have to squint to see the words and black and whtie is offensive to my eyes start toget headaches</br>  <br>Why? do you have dyslexia or something? I'm not trying to be a dick with this, as I know 2 people with dyslexia that cant read black and white well, I think JoJo's coloured Adventure have done most of Part 4, if that helps</br>  <br>Goddamnit, you fucking beat me.</br>  <br> yeah i have to squint to see the words and black and whtie is offensive to my eyes start toget headaches <br>You might be spending too much time on the computer.</br></br>  <br>My friend say "watch this anime its about a strong dude who's really nice and his foster brother becomes an immortal vampire in episode 2"<br><br>I knew about it just like everyone else prior but it wasn't until the 2012 anime that I got into it.

Just pretend it's like any other series when you're done with it the characters are more or less dead because they haven't done anything else. Write fanfiction about them being in heaven or something if you're that sad.

Either way they all died to finally end the Joestar curse and their alternative selves, regardless of being them or not have far better lives.

He doesn't have any weird quirks to his sociopathy aside from Doppio but every action he does just reeks of some sort of complexity addiction that he just comes off as a hard to like villain for the wrong reasons. He seems moronic outside of combat but he's not supposed to be.</br>  I finished SBR yesterday. I thought it was good and all but wasn't really so blown away and immediately gushing over it. Why is it so popular?<br>Though I guess 4 took me a while to like, even after I finished it.<br>Right now I would probably rank:<br>2&gt;6&gt;4=7=3&gt;1&gt;5</br></br></br>  <br>One of his dumbest decisions was the whole mission surrounding his daughter. NO ONE would have been after her or cared if he just never did that. He wouldn't have been paranoid about people finding out his identity through her if he never did that, because no one had the slightest idea she was his daughter.<br><br>Even IF people knew his identity, so? His stand was OP enough for it to not matter. If anyone attacked him he'd just show up out of nowhere and chest them.</br></br></br>  <br>Another dumb decision is the the death of Sorbet and Gelato. Why would you piss off your gang's top assassins to the point where they'll go after you when the goal is to not have anyone find out about your identity? If Diavolo just killed the gay shits quietly and never gave Bruno the mission about his daughter, Risotto and his gang would just shut up. And even if he wanted to kill his daughter personally, he didn't have to kill Bruno. If Diavolo just left him alone, he wouldn't be going through an infinite death loop.<br><br>Also, why would he want to become supreme emperor of the world if his goddamn point is to hide in the shadows as a big brother type person?</br></br></br>  <br>He only tried killing Bruno after Bruno tried to save Trish<br><br>And because he was a fucking idiot</br></br></br>  <br>Here you go Anon.</br>  <br>Nah he just crashed in the Arizona Desert after HEAVEN.</br>  <br> Thanks for bringing me my daughter. Now toodaloo so I can kill her even though that'll piss you off. <br>Diavolo is the worst written main villain Araki has ever made. Nothing makes sense about him.</br></br>  <br>Crashed you say?</br>  <br>I tried drawing the top left panel of </br>  <br>that's bretty gud anon</br>  I am watching the anime and I made it to part 3, why is it so shit<br><br>It's just not funny or entertaining, just a mediocre shonen that introduces its characters like its trying to sell toys. At least it's better animated I guess</br></br>  <br>You drew it sideways idiot.<br><br> Good job actually. </br></br></br>  <br> better animated  <br>It's not</br></br>  <br> Part 3 <br> Shit <br>Anon, you're tastes are the only shit thing here</br></br></br>  <br>He could've just waited until Bruno left. This guy should learn from Kira about staying hidden.</br>  <br>Part 3 is shit. It's one of the worst parts and Jotaro is also the worst JoJo.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, and I'm not sure why it uploaded sideways, it's vertical in the folder</br></br>  Where do I read JJL? I'm on Batoto where I read every other part, but already in the first pages they're calling it "Moriou"<br> or am i retarded and that's right for some reason </br>  <br><br>Part 2 had an excessive amount of slide show bullshit where they would just redraw the panels from the manga and hardly actually animate them. In part 3, the fights have a lot more motion. I only got 5 episodes in though so maybe the quality drops off? <br><br><br><br>It went from being deadpan humor to just, literally a regular ass fight show with just weirder than normal powers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is Jojo we're talking about. You need to make a stand that generates thousands of beetles or turns things into cacti or alters the planck length or something. Not "it shoots lightning". Come on.</br>  <br>SEX PISTOLS!</br>  <br><br>Yeah really. Although Magician's Red exists, so I dunno<br><br>But, there's a much better bee themed stand, 「NOT THE BEES」</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally a regular ass fight show with just weirder than normal powers <br>Those weirder than normal powers have been powering the series for more than 20 years.<br> Though the Stands in Part 3 are kind of stale. </br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me, we got 4444 post in the past thread as well.<br><br>Is BtD going on right now?</br></br></br>  <br> Not "it shoots lightning". Come on. <br>The Stardust Crusaders Stands was literally<br> Punches well <br> Use rapier <br> Shoot projectile <br> Use fire <br>And so on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> will zeppeli has italian accent <br> caesar doesn't <br><br>???</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's called bad luck.</br>  <br>I think weather report already has lightning manipulation. Good try, though.<br><br>Neat drawing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't mind that the stands are weird, although the concept that suddenly a whole bunch of people have imaginary friends which allow them to kill pretty much anyone else instantly with no evidence kind of limits the options of the plot. <br><br>What I mind is that it's about a few assholes who all look the fucking same going on a roadtrip to kill a character who's arc already wrapped up, fighting monsters of the week along the way, without even a hint of sarcasm</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aida Mitsuoh </br>  is dio still alive<br><br>will we ever get to see him again<br><br>  i miss him ;_;  </br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not really imaginary friends when only a very few of them are sentient and can talk to their users. Hell, do you consider Cream Starter, Thoth, or Beach Boy to be an imaginary friend?</br>  <br>Part 3's not that bad, its not the best part, but its hardly shit<br>  I like Jotaro more then Jolyne, Giorno and Josuke  </br></br>  <br>No, this new universe's Dio died a long time ago.</br>  <br>That's right. Moriou = Morioh = もりおう or whatever the Kanji are.</br>  <br>The poet?</br>  <br>whoa how did I forget this happened</br>  Does /jojo/ still have drawfags? Where did Giorno go?    <br>Went back to school.</br>  <br>Alright. I've just always seen it as Morioh so I wasn't sure, thanks<br>Also "Joshuu" vs the wiki's "Joshu"</br></br>  <br>Stardust stands were new so they were still pretty basic. And even then there were some gimmicky shit.</br>   beginning of episode 16 of Part III <br> "Shortly after capturing Enyaba, Jojo's group acquired a carriage." <br>Nigga what? Where and how did they manage to get this carriage? Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br> Just got past the chapter in part 8 where Yos   I can never remember her full name  and Josuke get hypnotised<br><br>This is the first chapter in JoJo i ever just skipped, god it was fucking painful.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly it was this<br><br>along with the promise of CUHRAZZY fights and cheesy one liners/dialogue in general</br></br></br>  <br><br>right, I'll think of something more along the lines of part 4-8 stands when it comes to abilities. i just assumed RHCP was new enough to copy</br></br>  <br> Yasuho and Josuke get hypnotised <br><br>Did this actually happen? I feel like this is either bullshit or I may have forgotten as well.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the "Plot Contrivance" Foundation?</br>  <br>is it really that bad to you?<br>or is other stuff going on in your life and the chapter just wasn't helping?<br>not trying to be condescending, just actually asking.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsurugi's stand, or the kid dressed as a girl</br>  <br>I thought that only did Illusion with people's face s and interact with paper-like objects, when did she "hypnotise" one of them?</br>  <br>I have asspergers<br>Not that you could tell, after 6 years i learned how to avoid showing signs of spergdom and hold a decent conversation, but i just don't enjoy comedy scenes that play off of social embarrassment, it just feels cringeworthy to me</br></br>  <br>I think anon's talking about Paper Moon King's powers.</br>  <br> she <br>its a boy dressed as a girl to ward off demons or some shit. Also i guess if you want to be technical than yea its an illusion rather than hypnosis</br></br>  <br> hypnotised </br>  <br>i see<br>i guess i can understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea</br></br>  <br>my apologies.</br>  In order to discover "heaven", Dio learned first the concept of Fate, Future and Gravity.<br><br>What did he learn?</br></br>  <br>Will Eyes of Heaven get an english release?<br> Will it get a PC release? </br></br>  <br>I can only pray</br>  <br>All johnny does is whine and get shot.

Universes?</br>  <br>If JoJo ever ends i want a final showdown where the newest protagonists school gets sieged, with the antagonist and him duking it out inside. Every JoJo from the previous parts than get drawn there at thier peak, where they engage the main antagonists from thier respective parts  three fucking Dios  in front of a crowd including news crews with thier stands and Hamon on full display. With the ending fight having them all pool thier powers to defeat the final antagonist.</br>  Is there a good stream or TV show dedicated to just beetle fights? I watched some on youtube, but want more.  <br>I really hope the beetle thing wasn't just a once off.

Favourite part with Dio.</br>  I can't believe it. This was supposed to be a cheap car commercial. <br><br>They put so much effort and actual science into this show it makes Interstellar look like Naruto. <br><br>Even if Pleiades really is the last show Gainax ever made at least they went with a bang.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pleaides made me really want to get an Impreza. Not kidding.</br>  <br>It's not supposed to be a car commercial. It's supposed to get girls into STEM.<br><br>Subaru just wants more female engineers around the break room. And what I imagine is a nice fat writeofff.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was an amazing show, but they failed by not giving enough carrot for dumb audience.</br></br>  So, this is actually good? Or am I being trolled? (I guess I'll have to give it a try to find out).  <br>Yes.</br>  I don't understand how people can skip out on a show just because it's a commercial.<br><br>That's all that most anime are. The most successful shows, like Gundam, are commercials. Usually it's to promote another story-telling medium, but with Gundam, it's literally a toy commercial. What's the difference between a toy commercial and a car commercial? You aren't going to buy any of the advertised products anyway.<br>What's the problem?<br>I don't understand. Somebody explain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In that case the difference is that Gundam merchandises toys with a narrative background of the same context (a show about fighting robots made to sell fighting robot toys).<br>On Pleiades case (at first sight I remark) is a show that tries to promote a car company using moe and magic. Such a gap can make anyone think that the creators of the show won't put much effort in the short film/series.</br></br>  the second properly-oriented deorbit burn I've seen in a work of fiction, I saw in a magical girl anime<br><br>truly it is a great time to be alive</br></br>  <br> I don't understand how people can skip out on a show just because it's a commercial. <br>I skipped out on it because of the cute girls and the generic moe art style.</br></br>    <br>It's a good rule of thumb for weeding out shit.</br>  <br><br>Back to the Naruto threads with you.</br></br>  <br> Projecting <br>I actually have taste.</br></br>  I barely made it through the first 2 episodes and just couldn't bother to watch 3  sauce?  <br><br>It's not you retard.</br></br>  <br>It's never failed me once.</br>  <br><br>Start is boring. It gets great with time.</br></br>  <br>How would you even know?</br>  <br>Same, then I continue to watch it and it's actually great.</br>  <br>I know what I like.</br>  <br>I skipped it because I did not know it existed until it started getting AOTS near the end here on /a/.<br><br>Now I really want to check this out but I picked up so much shit this season.</br></br></br>  <br>What we're discussing is whether that metric failed you, though. If you don't watch something because you don't think you'll like it, how can you verify that your thoughts about that were correct? You have no way of knowing if it's failed you by making you skip a good show (and I assume you aren't claiming you've never watched a bad show that didn't have a moe artstyle, so that seems beside the point).</br>  <br>Considering the character types in these shows make me physically sick, I think I'm good.</br>  <br>Spot the gay.</br>  <br>http://www.reuters.com/article/2015<wbr>/07/28/us-japan-subaru-specialrepor<wbr>t-idUSKCN0Q21GS20150728</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> physically sick <br> Being this autistic </br></br>  <br>What are you even doing on /a/?</br>  <br>He's shitposting, obviously.</br>  <br>Anime isn't all samefaced, cute girls anon.</br>  <br>Oh right.

No OVA bullshit?</br>  <br> ESL <br>English as a Second Language?</br></br>  <br>Despite its name, Nisioisn keeps writing more LNs so its not the end.</br>  2 Devilman movies<br> mfw </br>  Spoiler time thread<br><br>ネタバレ】 ワンピース７９５話 『一の目』 確定<br>2015年07月29日18:12 【ワンピース】　最新ネタバレ・画バレ一覧 写真あり<br><br>The name of chapter is "One eye"<br><br>Fujitora did a dice gambling with Maynard. If the dice indicates "1", Fujitora wins.<br>Depending on the result of gambling, Fujitora decided not to arrest Luffy and Law tonight. Maynard is embarassed with it and still tries to persuade Fujitora. It seems marine managed to find the place where Luffy is hiding.<br><br>Fujitora says that Maynard is not manly since he continues complaining after the gamble ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Saka</br>  Not sure why people are surprised by fujitora's actions. It's obvious that his perception of justice is different from the traditional marines. Hell, he probably didn't want to be a marine in the first place. He's aware that the strawhats have literally saved 2 countries, while the marines basically enabled those tragedies to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if he just cleaned up after the strawhats as they steamroll the rest of the new world, like taking in kaido after the battle.  <br>here is your reply</br>  <br>Anyone who blindly follows the system is the true betas. Fujitora is alpha as fuck.</br>  <br>Fujitora would spare Jaguar.<br><br>Aokiji would not.<br><br>And Aokiji did not know that Luffy was Dragon's Son yet.<br><br>Akainu after finding out Luffy was Dragon's son prioritized Luffy 2nd to Ace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
