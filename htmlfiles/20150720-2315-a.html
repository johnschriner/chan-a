[ I feel for all the tomboys in the world who were born with huge tits and have to carry unnecessary additional weight when doing sports and feel embarassed when someone compliments them on their huge funbags  <br>That is not a bad reason.<br><br>You can start on TV if you like, it's a longer commitment but a great entry point. In case you aren't already aware, the watching order is<br> OVA1 ('Early Days') - Movie 1 - Movie 2 -Movie 3 (set before 2) <br> TV - OVA2 ('The New Files') <br>You can take either continuity first but most advise starting on OVA1.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just pretend anon.</br>  <br>Pretend what?<br>That she has her breasts back and she's happy? <br>Yeah it works for a while, but sometimes reality just slaps me in the face again.</br></br></br>  <br>I was afraid of that. The OVAs only have like 4 seeders and are in .ogg<br>It's not the best</br></br>  <br>Your quads demand respect. As a reward, I shall post a bonus.</br>  This is a cruel, murderous, 500 year old blood lusting vampire.  <br>So you can give her the love she needs to become the wonderful person she is.</br>  <br>At least she isnt sub-human like the british</br>  <br>Tribute!?! <br><br>You steal men's souls and make them your slaves!</br></br></br>  <br>She's really been trying to stop that. She can't help it though. She just walks near a person and all of a sudden they're sacrificing their life to help her cross a puddle.</br>  <br>They consent. Thats all that matters.</br>  So I heard that Valkyria Chronicles is terrible shit beyond measure.<br><br>Does it really not worth a second of glare?</br></br>  <br>All of Faldios squad dies</br>  <br>It's funny how when you compare that image with the equivalent of Valkyria Chronicles 2. In the first game you have mostly young adults and the characters look like they would fit into an anime setting that mimics ww1/2. Then you have the equivalent image for 2 and every character fits an overdone high school anime character stereotype. I never played 2, but that's the impression I got.<br><br>I beat it years ago on ps3, but got interested in playing it again after I read some thread on /v/ where people cried about the big tank mission.</br></br></br>   play this turd for a while <br> rng accuracy that can't be compensated for beyond getting in your target's face <br> if the game decides you miss, you miss fuck you if it's a critical shot <br> best way to handle most missions is to bum rush the points with scouts <br> get to the mission with the giant tank <br> handle 3/4 of the mission easily <br> suddenly anime laser bitch appears, runs the entire length of the map and insta wrecks half my squad <br> can't kill the tank in time now  <br> the only solution is to stand on the other side of the tank when you destroy the radiators  <br> I lost because this was my first run through and I started from the wrong side <br><br>Yeah fuck that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you suck at video games</br>  <br>2 setting is utter shit.<br>I wish they made the 3rd on PS3/4.</br></br>  Favorite character?  Uni is best.<br><br>This is the absolute truth.</br></br>  Bran  <br>These new designs are so gaudy.</br>  Uni-chan 's patootie   <br>Noire's upgrade isn't so bad.</br>  High Speed movie trailer will be shown tonight at the All Night Swimming Event.  Is this anime really gay? I kind of want to watch an anime with an all/mostly male cast that isn't really gay. I want to see dudes do dudely shit.<br><br> no homo </br></br>  <br>Watch the dub then and fuck yourself.</br>  <br>This masterpiece.</br>  <br> I want to see dudes do dudely shit. <br><br>Watch actual sports anime like Haikyuu!! or Kuroko no Basuke instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Good idea, thanks<br><br><br>No homo, bro</br></br></br></br>  Okay /a/, time for the newfaggotry.<br><br>So I watched DBS, and I've never actually watched DB nor DBZ subbed, only dubbed in my native language because I was too young to even care about that shit.<br><br>Okay, most of the saiyan are dubbed by an old woman, I'm not okay with that (honestly Goku's voice sounds like shit) but I can still bear with that.<br><br>But this fucking dude. His voice is so annoying and his tone so monotonous.<br><br>I think I'll wait for official dubs to start watching this. I really like (like most of the guys my age) DB but this is just too much for me.<br><br>Also, fuck your opinion, I don't even give a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the fact that saiyans are badass is what makes dragon ball iconic and memorable.</br>  <br>I bet you read capeshit too, don't yah?</br>  <br>Not really, although I have some minimal knowledge about it.<br><br>Your argument is just stupid as fuck, deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br> saiyans are badass <br>Did you mean Goku is a badass?</br></br>  <br>But Vegeta is way more badass than Goku.</br>  Rin is stupid, ugly and probably smells bad.  I wish people would stop Rinposting so much.<br><br>It really makes me  fall deeper in love .</br></br>  <br>I see that Sader has brought couple friends with her.</br>  <br>do you have more?<br>I mean more character in ENG.</br></br>  <br>https://wakameparadise.wordpress.co<wbr>m/capsule-servant/<br><br>Pretty much the whole story of Capsule Servant is translated here.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>https://wakameparadise.wordpress.co<wbr>m/capsule-servant/</wbr></br>  What's the spookiest anime you've ever watched?  Psycho-Pass  Why not Yuipost?  <br>Source?</br>  <br>She's not my favorite but there's no denying she's a very cute and sweet girl. Her sly attitude is also very appealing to a lot of people.</br>  I just got back after being gone for a week, it seems like a missed some type of shit fest?  <br> Sport Fishing Magazine </br>  <br>The cover girl.</br>  DIE好き!  <br>Then why can't she let go off an inanimate object?<br><br>Take the shovel and she will start crumbling away.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not really smart.<br><br>Zombie fiction kinda suck at trying to threaten fisherman.<br><br>So you should hijack a sailboat or escape with some fisherman and just live on the ocean until all the zombies decompose or something which is pretty doable as long as you know how to swim.</br></br></br></br></br>  So I just reread the manga and I noticed that Kurumi is already dying back in chapter25.  <br> When someone starts ripping apart the teddy <br> Rii sees her sister being ripped apart, her screams echoing in her head. </br></br>  <br>The shovel is a means of survival and a formidable multi-fonction tool. The bear isn't. Kurumi is perfectly aware of that, that's why she doesn't let go of it. And I personally wouldn't either.</br>  How the fuck did he have time to write all that  http://rokka-anime.jp/%3Fp%3D356    Is something of worth gonna happen any time soon?  Why the fuck is rabbit a rabbit? I know that she's useless and only good for her sex appeal, but now that white Aoi Yuuki showed up she isn't even the best at sex appeal anymore.  <br>I think it actually might be based on the manga design. Sadly I am unable to confirm this because there are no raws anywhere.</br>   ITT: Draw an Animu Character as vaguely as possible and let others guess who is he <br><br>I'l start.</br></br>  <br><br>Akane from psycho passu</br></br>        <br><br>Kohina</br></br>   you will never ride with your Robot waifu to a party   <br><br>1. cutest face: loli Mai<br><br>2. best tits: Bulma<br><br>3. best ass: Bulma<br><br>4. best wife material: Gine</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goku is a good man, but not a family man <br>Too bad Goku could never lose to Guile, or he would get some good advice.</br></br>  <br><br>No. Guile is an Amerishit rodent.</br></br>  <br>Does Krillian and Android 18's daughter have "cyborg powers" or something? <br><br>Also, why don't I have any pics of pregnant 18?</br></br></br>  <br>Goku has no concept of money, never has.</br>  ITT The most badass moments of manga  <br> Implying he didnt do that kid a favor <br><br>He sent the kid to the otherworld so that he wouldnt be a fucking danger to innocent people.</br></br></br>  <br>We need more Go Nagai pages in this thread.</br>  <br>he's good at screwing</br>  <br>Nami crying at Luffy (Arlong Park) is a much better page than this one.</br>    Are there anime out there with actual subtlety it relations to characters? Nothing disassociates me more from a character than when they in some form monologue their moral viewpoint, etc. It leaves no room for subtext and virtually EVERY. SINGLE. ANIME. I've seen ever does this. Is it something with jap culture either being stupid and unable to convey underlying theme's that aren't either spoonfed or blatantly obvious?  White Album 2<br>Pretty good character drama if you know japanese so you can indulge yourself in Coda.</br>  <br>Yep, they're out there. Often not where you expect to find them.</br>  <br> you aren't going to find it in shows with cute girls <br> Try lain </br></br>  This thread is all kinds of different retarded, so I'm just going to leave this here.  Characters shouldn't be subtle in animation. Just look at stuff like Monster or LotGH, it ends up being more like a tv show with its staleness rather than a an animated series.</blockquote>]
