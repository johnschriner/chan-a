[ Scans out bitches  Dump images with discussion please, 1/5 of last thread is literally Irohasu~   Unless you want me dumping Yukino in the name of Spyro     I want to kill this fucking cunt.    My pessimism = gone. Thanks brothers. Weekly Iroha thread when (album-kun, please).         Yahallo!  I'd be ok with a Yukinon dump.  Good Irohasu, everyone!   This anon knows it    Irohafag cancer    How about we split the difference at a "both best girls" dump?   Iroha is my goddess  Who's winning   Now that's genuine Cap'n.    Yui    Irohasu~     pls no more Irohacucks  I don't care if Yui wins the 8 I just don't want her to be sad  and I don't like these chances     I want to see more original design Yukino.     cucks  Then stop instigating responses  Irohasu~       I'll take you up on that offer.    Irohasu~   Happy to be here captain. I was laying low for the most part, but decided to pop back up once the fun started to happen.   Feel free to, a fanart/discussion thread would be a welcome change of pace to what we usually have.           I feel as if those spoilers were true, it'd be a much bigger deal and we'd be discussing it. For the most part, what we've been talking has been mostly the 3way date between the club members   In this volume? Probably Yui. hachiman finally made the homemade cookie connection (and she was the only girl I think to give him something on Vday)  As to who's winning overall, beats me. Probably Yukino and Yui tied at this point         If she is giving him a handy then why is she using two hands?     What? But what about Iroha's spoon scene?     I can't seriously find a stronger term, so I'm going to resort to a simple one  Go fucking Irohass yourself      Irohasu~   Foursomes are pretty nice too you know      Fast. We have little time before they come. Let's discuss a few posts about the series and then we can hide. Because they are coming.    YUI WANTS IT ALL   Yui sandwich end is still best end        IROHA, captain.    Irohasu~   Avatarfag already shitting up the thread. This why the fanbase will always be considered cancer.    Service Club should be changed to The Swinger's Club.  This should legit be a LN series.       Irohasu~   It's your own bloody fault, try not making provoking shitposts like this  and maybe we won't passive aggressively spam fanart.   Try putting your hand over a fire to learn something already.          We aren't 100% sure how that scene is meant to be interpreted because of the dammed Japanese wordplay.    Taichou, I can see them coming. They are about 100 men. What are we going to do, Taichou?   It's happening isn't it?   it could still happen.   You can't stop Irohasu NTR 8man  Irohasu~~~    In case otherfags can't understand it   That's the thing, anon, we know her chances of winning are slim, but we don't give a shit, we still love our queen.  I'll put it like this   1.-She loses the 8bowl, but we don't care that much cause we saw it coming.   2.-She wins the 8bowl and you all faggots get gloriously BTFO by our queen.   We have nothing to lose and everything to win   IROHA OR DEATH   And Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                                Iroha almost wins, but is beaten back by reinforcements coming from a wizard(Shizuka-sensei) and is ultimately defeated?    If a few pictures of an anime girl are physically stopping you from writing out your discussion on the series I don't think your mentally stable enough enough to post or formulate a post in response to an argument.    I thought it was pretty straight forward since the ellipses were at the beginning of the term in question. If it were at the end I could see how it could be interpreted in many ways, but for the most part it sound like his standard way of giving backhanded compliments.  "...But I don't hate it." is pretty easy to understand compared to "I don't hate it, but.."   Irohasu~          You could boil eggs with how hot her crotch is I bet.     It's not insignificant, but the hype that Irohafags exploded into about it was way out of proportion.    You better be off asking god, Anon-kun. I don't know what you will do, but I have family. I will run. If fighting is brave, then running is smart. They are coming Anons! Prepare yourself!   That's it faggots, you guys got on my nerves. POSTING LEWDS    Not really, the whole "but-" argument doesn't make sense because of the lack of commas, and the one about telling the words she was waiting for = lying is just bullshit    inb4 Spyro translates the whole scene as "I don't hate it, but...... it's way too sweet"        Why boil them when you can fertilize them?     A few? Are you fucking kidding?  Half the posts in this thread are Iroha shitposts.  I think I'm really going to have to straight up filter every post with Iroha's name.         I could Yukinospam the shit out of this thread, but you know, I don't want to annoy Yuifags either because we're trying to have a discussion here but you just keep shitting Irohas like your shithole was the new opening to Earth's core.   Seriously anon      Irohasu~    8man need Iroha's saliva bottle      3P works much better though. More than that and it starts getting awkward to keep everyone in play.    Yui's chances have gone up in this volume with giving Hachiman cookies on Vday, him saying to her be genuine with your feelings, and the possibility of another date between just the two of them in the future (the 3way date was supposed to be promise date but Hachiman has a code of honor)  Does Yukino get anything to boosts her chances of winning? Beats me. Hachiman tells her that ultimately she needs to solve her own problems and she is about to give Yui/Hachi a request. But she had a bunch of flags in previous volumes. And the story is mostly going to focus on her from here on out I think   Theres also the Iroha spoon scene but lets not dive into that        That's the thing, anon, we know her chances of winning are slim, but we don't give a shit, we still love our queen. I'll put it like this  1.-She loses the 8bowl, but we don't care that much cause we saw it coming. 2.-She wins the 8bowl and you all faggots get gloriously BTFO by our queen. We have nothing to lose and everything to win.  IROHA OR DEATH           So from that image, everyone is standing but Iroha is kill? What?     I actually agree with that, I think a lot of Irohafags had pent up frustrations since people kept saying Iroha was going to get BTFO in volume 11 for no reason.   At the very least it only lasted for a bout a thread or two. Much better than the Yui berserk threads after that one episode.   Iroh-asu~  Not as easy as you'd like it to be, eh fucker?           Ambush! I repeat, ambush! Some of our comrades changed sides and shot down some of our men! The enemy is increasing! Taichou we have to run!     See   Except, probably when they all end up in college, and miraculously it's the same one.      The report function exists.    posting fanart   shitpost  Irohasu?       We have nothing to lose and everything to win.   IROHA OR DEATH  So Irohafag lives are truly worthless then.      You do realize that you're implying Iroha is sleeping around on 8man, right? Learn to use NTR correctly for god's sake.    Here your "Irohafags shitposting"    <br/>        No, really. If you don't have the mental capacity to just ignore pictures of an anime girl I don't even know how you function on this board. If someone wants to discuss they'll look for your post which discusses something and respond. No one is making a conscious effort to discuss not because of pictures but because they don't want to or you know they haven't read the newnovel.      Welp, I guess for Spyro it is.   Enemy fire! I repeat! Enemy fire! We have injured comrades taichou! Where are you?    Well we can't really discuss anything until some translationfags come out. So for the most part there's nothing to discuss that hasn't been already.  At the very least fanart posting isn't doing any harm, it's a pretty tame thing to do in response to shitposts. Much better than the circlejerks that pop up whenever someone falls for the denialfag's bait.   Irohasu~ to you too         Yukino essentially told Yui she likes 8man. I don't know if that hurts or helps but it does turn this into a love triangle.    be an edgelord with a heart of gold   be moderately attractive   score two really hot chicks  Damn, 8man is a lucky man.          Yuifags spam too, nobody is innocent.      Lewis Hamilton   Less shitposting, more cute girls.   Don't forget the awesome imouto.   BFFs stand together!         Yukino essentially told Yui she likes 8man? Where?   So Yui pulls ahead? I fully support this   Once again, feel free to do so. Not much to do until we can get the moonreaders in here to explain shit for us.   I don't have as much Yukino fanart as I would like anyways.       /a/   posting pics of an anime girl = shitpost  Incredible.     Y+Y yuri 8man + Iroha   Hachiman suicide is the only solution that will give everyone an equal amount of happiness      I wouldn't say she's pulled ahead, but things between Yukino and Yui have definitely equalized at the least.      Listen good now my men. I want you to run and never look back. Promise me you won't look back. I'll stay here, and take them with me to the south, you run to the north and then take the helicopter. I know I wasn't always nice to you guys, but i remember times where we had actual discussions about this series. And I can die for these memories. Now go! Go and don't look back! Because if you do I can't hold myself back from coming with you!       k      When she told Yui she was conscious of 8man. That's basically the same as "I like him"    Ahh she did. Well at least they're being upfront about it.   I think even though its a full blown triangle now its better than the tension we had earlier in the novel. I feel when Hachiman told both girls to be genuine that it leveled the playing field        Let me dream. I dont like Yukino at all    T-TAICHOUUU! I WILL STAY WITH YOU!      I actually read moon, just don't translate them for the absence of shitposting      The anti-irohafags are ass mad right now since we Irohabros are not falling for their obvious baits to a shitpost fest   I-Irohasu~~!!       Taichou, you have family. I will stay, you go.    Yukino said she was "conscious" of 8man.  Which, unless you're a denialfag, clearly has romantic connotations.  Remember everybody, Yui is love and Yui is life.  But a Yukinon is fine too.          Why do I come to these threads anymore   Yui ship isn't as dead as we thought it was, actually seems in really good shape in fact. So congrats you guys, I always supported you despite all the jokes I made at your expense at times.  To be fair those were only in response to shitposts though.   That's understandable I suppose, you're free to do whatever the hell you want anon.   Irohasu~ my brother!            Link?    spoilers     I-I will stay too ;-;     I got you on that.   I expect an all-out Waifu War by Vol.12      Translatorfag-san onegai~     Nothing much with Vol11. I've enough Irohasu~ in chap 4. Chap7-8-9 only about club, Yui moment while touching Fish, Yui playing fair, let 8man and Yukino alone. Yukino dependency problem while she saw the fish in water tank.  Still Irohasu~         https://mega.nz/#!X5lhkRwb!mOsZVYyo<wbr>EW3XNs0NvOpeZsCjkP8PgUivYmTXL4Ar9u8<wbr></wbr></wbr>       You realize the reason for that is because she doesn't sell on her own.      https://mega.nz/#!X5lhkRwb!mOsZVYyo<wbr>EW3XNs0NvOpeZsCjkP8PgUivYmTXL4Ar9u8<wbr></wbr></wbr>   Here you go, image quality is a bit off, but it is pretty decent.   We haven't been having one since the season started? News to me.           5 months of Cold war    What? This is just a warm-up. Real shit comes after we find out what's Yukinon request    I'm sure she sells fine on her own. The problem is that she doesn't have a solid relationship with either of the other girls, so pairing her off with one of them makes much less sense than it does to put her with 8man.     1. Spoilers. 2. Occasional new artwork 3. Sometimes get comics translated 4. Read Iroha spam          Heh, bakayaroudomo. Ah-ah, what am I gonna do with you bastards? After all this, I will buy you all that ramen from Ichirou you love, so lets keep fighting!      Okay, who else say the love triangle between 8man/Yui/Yukino coming?   Welp, forgot pic    That's not exactly how marketing works anon, if that were the case she would be paired with the main heroines rather than the MC. The females have more selling power than males do.    So November if we're lucky and Watari doesn't fuck off with his deadlines and crap out 11.5 to fill the dead air.    No I mean when they were doing the key chain thing, Iroha's didn't sell that well.   8man's merch actually sells better than Yui's.       Good end never    Tobe shouldn't you be practicing with the rest of the soccer team?    Why can't they all be happy? Life isn't fair.    Sadly, 11.5 seems so real to me    Now that's alpha.    Seriously? That's weird, on average in Japan the trends are usually pretty static in favor of female merchandise. Odd.   I might have to look into that later.   Marketing major here, so this is actually really surprising for me since I've done case studies on this shit.         So they sell more when they ship Irohax8man and YxY? Nice taste nips      I saw the it coming, I am not dense.     No I mean when they were doing the key chain thing, Iroha's didn't sell that well.  [citation needed]      Delayed to December   Half the pages of a normal volume   Half of these pages are WW rants about not meeting the deadline       aren't your arms tired yet from all the reaching you did to get "8man openly flirting with Iroha" out of the spoon thing?       Well he also has to write those side stories for the blu-ray special editions too.   I think the issue is how heated it would be rather than it's existence at all. We all saw it coming, the problem is that we don't know exactly how hostile it might be.  Yui side of things is pretty easy to predict, she seems like one of those "let's fight fair and square!" type of girls.  But Yukino has shown she gets pretty jealous extremely easily. So jury's out on that one.            It was months ago, I'm not going into the archives for that. There were several pictures showing that Yukino and 8man had sold out while Iroha hasn't sold much.     Kawanantoka-san?    aren't your fingers tired from pressing against the trigger of that gun since your waifu is pretty much non-existent at this point?   Seriously you Sakifags used to be chill, where did that stick up your asses come from?        Everything that happened in Vol 10/11 was the precursor to the real romance war that will happen in 12.  Hachiman basically evened the playing field, removed most of the tension in the club, and basically gave a green light to Yui/Yukino to go all out for his affections    Is anyone actually dating anyone in Oregairu? I mean is there even one couple in the school?  I feel like I'm missing someone obvious, but nothing comes to mind.     It's a goddamned tragedy that Ponkan8 gave Yukino the Zettai Ryouiki.  Though I guess that might have been a strategic move on his part. Nobody would care about any girl but Yui if her character design was that perfect.      Shit, totally forgot about Blu-ray editions. Welp, December probably.    Tobe and Ebina have the comfortable relationship of him being her bitch while she ignores him, he deserves better.    Even so, if she sells more while being paired with 8man, that just means nips like them as a couple      I'll say it's a blessing, ZR doesn't mix well with buxom      She sells more with 8man because people want 8man.    all these tiny scraps of information all over the place   Nah, I'll wait until Spyro comes along to save the day.       Tobe x Iroha?    Not a Sakifag, she was just the first "tired of your shit" face I hit on in my Yahari folder.      Isn't he dying?    You want to base your statement on a few pictures taken on a single spot? That's not convincing.       We'll have to agree to disagree. The slight indent in the otherwise perfect curve of plump thighs covered by stockings is what keeps me going when I feel like the world is crashing down around me.     Why exactly would he be dying?   Did you see him post that he was ill or are you being a retard?               They should compete with their bodies.        Somebody with taste took my dump from last thread        all this Yukino art    Fucking hell     And then they can share the prize when they tie.   Damn right I did. Yui's my forever girl but how could I not love a girl great enough to be her BFF too?      I haven't been keeping up. Has Yumiko won the 8man yet?    I wonder if this is artsy-fartsy enough for me to get away with blowing it up to poster size and hanging it on my wall.    Want me to continue?  Don't care either way       168 / 88 / 38  This is a new low.    Definitely. I don't remember seeing some of these, so either I'm going senile or the epubs in that one mediafire folder left out some of the early volumes' illustrations.      As long as you like it, it'll do       reminder that Chapter 1 fanfiction translation is out on kyakka     At least I gave an early warning       So wait, was Yui's proposal that there would be no romance in the club, or was it her essentially declaring "war" or whatever? Because I've seen people saying both and I'm not sure if it's a dodgy translation or if I'm just getting memed by shitposters    38 unique posters :^)  Its basically a /c/ thread at this point. So lets start fighting. Because we all know Yui is going to beat Yukinon. Yukino pretty much said that Yui was reading too far into her feelings by saying "Don't decide how I feel for me."     approx. 4 posts per user. that's been the standard for ages, plus we've got at least three of us in here image dumping to various degrees.  Speaking of that though I should really go check the Yui tag on pixiv again.       cropped  I can play that game too you know.       Very well then, it's going to be the two of us then.      Yes         Yukino a shit.         A worthy foe eh?      Sounds more like it was a psy-ops move to shake up 8man and Yukino into being more genuine.      That was Yui lying so that she could spark another genuine moment from Hikki and Yukion. Hachiman shot down idea anyways  In the end from what I gathered is that next volume both girls will be going after Hachiman in earnest (after he basically gave them a green light to do so). But theres no tension in the group anymore so its more or less a fair fight and whoever wins, wins      She wanted no romance in the club, ie no HikkixYukinon because it would make her want to an hero  She does say she wants everything which can be interpreted many ways.  Hikki at the end tells her to follow her genuine feelings and it seems like she consents. He basically told her to go after her love.          k        I hope so.       Why Yahari threads have been degenerating into art dumping threads?   Quality suddenly went shit, don't know why   You may have pixiv, but I have 5 volumes in my arsenal        So, do they still casually insult each other with nicknames?   Cats are a best    I love how her personality transformed entirely after the genuine scene. She practically disappeared from the series, only to suddenly transform into a completely different character with next to no development.      We're not shitposting no?        These aren't from pixiv though      We lack fresh spoilers, so there's nothing to discuss right now  Better dumping than shitposting at least.      That happens. In any case I feel a sudden urge to write sonnets and I'm not sure why.    The Ice Queen/Demon Woman is gone.        I know, but your legion have one huge ass cult following in there     If Yukinon and/or Yui don't win we riot.   I wish we'd get coloured art more often.    Protip: The Ice Queen exterior has always been an act.     S2 Yukino doesn't even feel like the main heroine.       Sometimes I actually wonder if that's true.      Because as soon as they let their defenses down they start making spaghetti.    Poor Yui, she was just trying to get 8man some condensed milk for his coffee, and now she's covered in it!    I'm an Irohafag, but I always really liked this pic.        8man become japan's frank sinatra spin off when      Those are some next level yandere eyes. Oh god, what did she do this time?      This one is also pretty nice, wish there was a higher quality scan of it though.       Man I never noticed the bow in Yukino's hair before. Fucking adorable.          Tomorrow is it.   At last, a decent Irohafag. Never thought I would see this day.        That's a philosophical question, be more specific      Great job I did including my pic there. I feel dumber than Tobe.        Don't worry, I just did that twice      Don't hate on Tobe, he's a good guy.      Hey, just because I have a favorite, doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the other girls. Though the fact that 3/4th of my folder is full of Iroha pictures is a bit of a problem for me.     Does Haruno want something genuine?     Is this official art? What the hell is going on?       not having a folder just for the goddess  Come on, brother.         Think of it like when Yukino tosses insults at 8man. I love the guy too but come on.        [Iroha intensifies]    She'll take his genuine thing, then she'll make him take her sister's genuine thing.     Yukino pretty much said that Yui was reading too far into her feelings by saying "Don't decide how I feel for me."  This.       He's still dumb though, a good guy and a nice friend to have, but still stupid.    Havent been to the threads in a while. Is vol. 11 out? Has it been translated?        At least you don't go Iroha or death for now. May you live well Irohafag      Wait, could that be interpreted as her bowing out of the 8bowl or?      Read the LN.   I want her.     Don't let the shitposters and falseflags get to you. Iroha or death means more than just spaming it in all caps.       I'm a Yukinofag, but I love this art. Fucking cute.    Probably not that was part of them denying her request to stay friends.    You too anon, whomever your girl may be.   I think it's more like she dislikes the idea of Yui trying to read into her more than anything else.       Nice meme      Official, 8man, chuuni, and double Y strip card against nerds. Long story short, Yukino almost strip, 8man sacrifice his dignity, chuuni won      YOOO 8man's desk is in the wrong place!     151  Image limit incoming.       i think everyone who has top-tier taste does too anon    Iroha or Death means you won't jump ship like some YYfags did. Though it's understandable in case of Yukino, since she became party pooper-chan at second season. At least for anime-only fags.      Man, I can't believe I missed all this birthday art for her.    Oh right, forgot that was from the big exchange at the aquarium.          Yes, cute. That's certainly a word to describe them.      The one true path.                 I could say something about trusting a traitor to not turn traitor again, but I won't.  At any rate, is ship-jumping really such a sin as long as it's  genuine ?        Everyday until I'm bored. http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm264<wbr>84384 https://d.maxfile.ro/tplqqbrcmf.mp4<wbr></wbr> </wbr>   Don't forget about the image limit anons  So the Yukino copy cat scene is true after all, it's actually kind of creepy.  I wonder why 8man didn't react to this though.      Was this part of the story of a volume or just a pic description? Why did they skip it in the anime.      Did we kill the thread?      Anon that second link isn't very genuine.         Implying I give a shit  We could actually discuss this way       Explain?      Don't care either, but shouldn't we leave some image space for others who might want to post scans and such?        Editor probably messed it up   Unfortunately         Works fine for me, maxfile is just the replacement site for pomf.    Always liked this pic. Has pretty much no bearing on the plot, only lasts like 3 sentences, but gets your attention.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]    <br/>    Looks like Yui did, though.   Write a love letter to Yui RIGHT NOW.      At any rate, is ship-jumping really such a sin as long as it's genuine?  Yes.     Yeah let's just stop.    Not the editor, she says the exact same thing as 8man    Chrome/Google has problems with Maxfile for some reason. Press the "Details" link to continue.      You make a good point, but I feel like we've hit a lull with that. Maybe because it's all gonna get revealed tomorrow with the episode?      Very well, then.

Volume 6 from the filename, so probably when the class that switched their exhibit to a rollercoaster shoved Yukino and 8man onto the ride.    aquarium date   yui and 8man tenderly look each other in the eyes   they head home together   in bedroom   undress   yui turns to see her bare lover   it's a fish   8man still in tank           What did Yui say?  Is it that big a deal? Hachi and Yuki early in the series often said the same thing (though simultaneously)      Look what you've made me done  I'll need some caffeine after this    I worked as an editor for a children book once, since most of the sentence are x is not for y I'll just use copy paste.  I should be fired for mentioning this    Yeah that Yui poster gotta stop   Volume 6              He accidentally left stealth mode up again.    They're totally in sync.    Anime skipped it. But when Hachi and Yuki were making rounds during culture festival, one of the classes had a coaster/ride of some sort and the two of them somehow ended up on it together.

ShindoL already did it, Yumiko got in a car accident         The bit about Yukino repeating Hachiman's words verbatim reminds me of what she said about her former deal with Haruno years ago while Hachiman and Yukino are at the amusement park.    I composed myself like a doll behind her.      Have you finished reading? How do you feel about this volume? Any prediction for volume 12?  BTW, have you got the BD special volume yet?       who is Hayama's Y?    Why did she dye her hair  in Yui's blood ?      Yukinoshita Haruno  It's pretty obvious by this point.       Because  she knows which girl 8man loves the most.    Which girl does John Cena ship?   That's ponkan being retarded.      Braidslut secretly want the Irohasu?      Ponkon's Iroha is about as consistently drawn as 8man's boner is capable of maintaining erection.     Have you finished reading?  Nope.  How do you feel about this volume?  I want Watarin to stop bullying the Yukinon.  Any prediction for volume 12?  It might not be the last volume.  BTW, have you got the BD special volume yet?  Next week.

Just imagine how things could have gone if his manner of speech was different.      implying Yukino knows how to give a good handjob   implying that doesn't make it more adorable   but also less satisfying       Imagine if character development never happened   slut       1 Yukino 2 Saki 3 Yui ... 13 Iroha         127133849   The Yuki loves they Haya.      Pretty sure she'd look at you with moist eyes after a while go "D-dou?" and that would make me cum more than the actual stroking.    It would be a good tease for when it is time to stick it in her hairy pussy (you know damn well she doesn't shave)    Would Haruno fuck 8man if he offered?    Iroha and 8man flirting with each other   8man made the cookie man x Yui connection    Yukino admits being conscious of 8man   Volume 12 is going to be a bloodbath, won't it?      Why did Yui waste her chance for a date date in this retarded meeting? She could have done this any other time, and likely get the same result.  Anyhow, how many more volumes are there to go? 2? I don't think this will have a romantic ending.  I mean, Yui isn't taking her chances they way she should. Yukino refuses to deal with her problems. Iroha beats around the bush by being roundabout. The biggest deal is that 8man is yet to show any actual romantic interest in any of the girls.  I think this will have a friendship end, whilst acknowledging the girls have feelings for 8man and something may happen in the future, but that's not part of the story.  This volume seems disappointing. It could have moved the plot a lot more, but WW is still set on making the story give baby steps in it development.              Probably not. When Haruno fucks it's Haruno who definitely initiates it at her time and on her terms.  Though for whatever reason I imagine her turning completely submissive in bed.       She would probably laugh like mad and destroy whatever little pride he has.    Feel the love Anon.   Previews when?   I bet Yukino would probably spit on your dick if she sucked you off, but she would definitely swallow your cum so as to not make a mess probably. Yui on the other hand would probably want you to cum inside her because she's a dirty little bitch    A shame that she's blind and would look in the wrong direction    Remind me, what was the cookie man? I recall it was something from the early volumes, wasn't it?     7 hours    Except for over-reaching on 8man's reaction to Iroha, you've got about the size of it so yes.    Its obviously Yukinoshita Yukino.    He said Y not YY.    Cookie man was the guy Yui wanted to make home-made cookies for, in the very first volume. We knew it was 8man all along, but 8man only made the connection now.     I want to marry Iroha.    First request of the series (ignoring Sensei's change Hachiman to Yukinon) was Yui wanting to make cookies for someone. The audience knew it was for Hikki (basically confirmed in a later episode/novel) but he himself didnt make the connection until Vol 11   All Watari has done is use Yukino as fuel for the drama in the series. Bullying her (and crummy development) since Vol 6. Make her end good Watarin       Get in line faggot.    Tsundere     Ah... I absolutely forgot about that. What was 8man's reaction to that?  Anyhow, is it true he talked about genuine once more and that he cried again?        Second/third chapter Yui came with a request to learn how to bake cookies. She wanted to give some to the guy she liked, but she's a shit cook so she needed help. When all was done, she subtly let 8man have the cookies. Delivery finished    Yes, 8man 'cried' again this volume.   Has it been confirmed that volume 12 is going to be the last one?   Nope, but that's how far Watari's contract go.   Genuine died Hachiman cried    You    No, and it probably won't. My bet is that volume 12 will be spent resolving Yukino's problem and volume 13 will finally deal with everyone's feelings and end.     And then it's announced that the contract is terminated after vol 12 and we're stuck with an unfinished Yukino-ish end nobody wanted    Well what if the request she gives the two of them involve searching for their feelings? Because her problems are also tied to her feelings on what she wants to do with her life   So wait, Yukino loves 8man even though Yui loves him already. Isn't this a big problem? Won't it be hard to deal with this without people getting hurt? Genuine looks like it might die, this sort of arrangement is the opposite of genuine. At least there won't be a WA2.   Maybe not, but I don't think it's impossible for him to wrap up everything in a satisfactory way in one more book.  Think about how much volume 9 managed to accomplish. If Watari can go from Lone Ranger 8man to Genuine to Destinyland to Service Club Reborn in one book and make it work that well, he can finish this in volume 12.       A lot of ways it could play out.  But genuine is happening, one way or the other.       Someone is going to get their feelings hurt but I think by the end of Vol 11 they dont care (because the girls want 8man's dick so badly that they're going for it even if they lose)   why don't they just have a harem end   Yui wants the 8inch that badly? I don't buy the Yukino loves 8man theory though.     I don't buy the Yukino loves 8man theory though.  what     Inconclusive    Iroha Akbar    If Yukino doesn't love him then there is no actual conflict in all this and Yui would just be making an ass out of herself.    Has there been a series that actually pulled off a satisfying harem end?    Have you been living under a rock anon? Though I guess it would be understandable if you avoided the threads this past week.      I think it's worth noting in volume 11 that Yui said she is not nice girl to 8man is symbolism that 8man wouldn't think her as "nice girl" anymore.   Either way its the same result. He always had to get over Yui and her nice girl problem  Either he gets over nice girls as a whole or as Yui makes it so he doesnt lump her in that category           Ceasefire dammit    So when Yukino says at the end of vol 11 "I didn't agree to anything. Don't decide other people's beliefs." What did she mean?   Watari is just letting things 'rest' for a bit until he ties everything up with the final Haruno arc    I don't think Yukino loves 8man until she says something to that effect.   Conflict with her dependency and Yui's romance.   I am just not buying the love triangle idea. Let's see what /a/ thinks.  http://strawpoll.me/4731955              strawpoll    C'mon, spare the image limit        inb4 yuifag proxy     She tells Yui she is conscious of 8man; even if you arent knowledgeable in girl speak, it basically means she likes him     4th option  kek'd. nice job leaving a little present for the proxyfag.      implying poll maker is not the proxyfag himself    If I only watched the anime without reading the books I wouldn't understand 70% of this series, I can't live without 8man's full inner monologue. Am I autistic?   Yes and no are tied.   Does Yukino mean that in that she acknowledges him, pays attention to him, respects him, or thinks about him? It is a vague word. All it means is he is in her head.   She didn't want Yui to push something Yui wants onto her. She didn't agree to friends no matter what.         Yui misunderstanding Yukino's relationship towards 8man again, hasn't she learned anything from the mall scene? Fucking hell.   that's not even girlspeak so much as japanese romcom speak   no, the anime is literally just a long-ass commercial for the LNs       It means she thinks of him, she does pay attention and respect him too though.    She's probably keeping it vague on purpose for Yui.     Has there been a series that actually pulled off a satisfying harem end?  Color Wars     Anime is deliberately vague so that you'll buy the LNs  LNs will be open ended so that you'll buy the VN      Well TBH, they have been acting a lot more close lately. Seeing her blush in front of him in the Infirmary and during the chocolate event.    What is Yukino supposed to say?   "I love him and I want him inside of me"   "I hope you don't mind that"        Anime is deliberately vague so that you'll buy the LNs   LNs will be open ended so that you'll buy the VN      Their relationship obviously changed since then. When 8man and Yukino explained the situation back then they would put up defenses and completely deny it. Now they spaghetti all over each other and Yukino confesses being "conscious" of 8man.    If this happens I'll go to Japan and kick Watawata's /hayatoinhighschool/ ass    mfw friendship end comfirmed   What was the Japanese text for Yukino saying she's "conscious of 8man"?  So is Yui a part of sensei competition or no? It seems like she tried to force her way into it but Hachiman rejects her proposal.   I was under the assumption it was purely between hachiman and Yukino even after the events of Vol 7      I dunno. Supposedly it takes place during the interlude, but the translation for the whole interlude has yet to be posted.     Something more concrete would be nice, it would cut down on trolling as everyone would know how she felt.   Does she think Yui loves 8man? I thought she was in the dark.    That makes more sense. That seems friendly.           Well technically she can be a part of it if she wants to.  I mean sensei set the vague rules and even vaguer reward and sensei is going to decide who wins totally arbitrarily most likely.       Does the competition even matter? 8man has helped pretty much everyone almost on his own. Yui at best plays a supportive role in whatever she does, and Yukino cannot even help herself.      Probably? Didn't Sensei evaluate her as well?    ¿In what interlude does she says that? I read that there were subtle hints in all the volumes but I'm a dense faggota dn probably missed a lot of them.     She says it in the new book.     Hachiman is going to win the thing; Sensei favors him/shows bias towards him all the time   I think it'll play a role towards the end of the novel with the winner forcing the loser to do something.    Kinda? In Vol 7, Sensei said Hachiman had the results, Yukino had long term planning, and that the request wouldn't be solved without the help of Yui         IROHA OR DEATH  We all agree friendship end is the best end right  Anything else would make shippingfags unbearable        Hachiman is going to win the thing; Sensei favors him/shows bias towards him all the time   Yeah that's what you'd think. But I can't help but feel like sensei is going to just give the victory to whoever she thinks would be best to have it. It'll depend on the final situation most likely. Whichever one sensei feels needs to ask something of the other is the one who is going to win it.      Yuckyno a shit. A SHIT.   Oddly suiting for a fanbase known for it's borderline fanatism.    that'sthejoke.webm    Except no we don't all agree completely. They should all be friends yes, but Yui is definitely in love with 8man. If it wasn't obvious at the "Tsuki nano" scene then I don't know what to tell you.    IROHA AKBAAAAAR     Either that or she's going to say something like "In true shoujo manga fashion, we'll throw everything in the past away and have it come down to the one final battle".     The club should stay friends to avoid meltdown.  Iroha should rape 8man to unleash his sexual frustration.      I'd prefer a romantically conclusive ending where everybody remains long time friends. Having solely a "we're all friends guys!" while leaving the whole romance elephant in the room isn't satisfying at all.   Iroha is perfect for the friendship end, just saying.        Tsuki     She already raped his mouth, so full rape might become a thing.    AH, THE MOON!   ;_; sorry m8. Suki dayo.          IROHA OR DEATH       8man just avoided the melt down, both girls know their feelings and will try to be genuine with them. There will be romance between the three.   It would be really awful, especially the shitposting, if Yui/Yukino are in love with 8man and he is completely undecided by the end.       Yeah, I'm sure when 8man picks one of them while Yukinoshit deals with her family drama that everything will be just dandy.  There's no way one will feel dejected and awkward when he's fucking the other girl in the club. Excellent analysis, anon.      Somebody is going to get hurt regardless, but they somehow remaining friends without hard feelings after all this shit flinging would be for the best. That, however, is not possible if one of the club girls get the 8inch. It doesn't even need to be forced, all watari has to do is go deeper into 8man x Iroha flirtation and things will go smooth     Yui isn't the possessive or easily depressed type so she would take a loss well.  Yukino doesn't have a jealous streak nor is she the obsessive type so she will take the loss well.  It will be a light love triangle with little hard feelings.   It will be fine, with this renewed belief in genuine they will be less hurt by not getting the 8. The club won't break down because one of them is 8man's GF.             Yui isn't the possessive or easily depressed type so she would take a loss well.   No, that isn't how it works anon      I find it Yui and Yukino are doing all this stalemate thing, when neither of them has an idea of 8man has romantic feelings for any of them. For all they know, he doesn't see any of them that way, as much as he cares for them.  Seriously, Yui should just stop beating around the bush and making a proper confession. If he cares about Yukino, that should even give her a push, became regardless of the answer she gets, Yukino can move on.  Yukino has too many personal issues (which Yui might just have come to realise with her mimicking 8man when she called Haruno) to be dragged into this retarded love triangle.         Yui just went full "If I win, I'm taking everything". That's not going to work anon.     She wants 8man and Yukino, that isn't wrong.And if she loses it will be okay.   Then how does it work?      8man doesn't love any of them  So no one wins      You honestly think that Yui after getting her heart broken would just be fine and get over it  She pratically fell apart from his fake confession to ebina       Is that cum all over the center cutout's face?   I hope we at least get an iroha rejection   Yukino is her good friend and if she is genuine then there is nothing to be sad about, he just didn't love her and possibly loves someone else. She can handle 8man being in love with someone else than her.  I think she will be happy for them and relieved she can move on.      Nobody is even going to be talking about this series by the time we get to the ending, so that's a non-issue.  I don't particularly mind a friendship end, as the series isn't inherently about romance. However I'd still be pretty disappointed that it would make Iroha's entire existence into a red herring.        She can handle 8man being in love with someone else than her.   She couldn't even handle his fake confession to someone else  Nice delusion though          this is what yukinofags believe    The service club will be fine. Yui is like it's guardian.  No matter what happens, Yui can reach into her magic hat and pull something that out that gets everyone talking again. Then Hachiman talks about genuine and cries and all the girls panties melt.  This can happen forever if need be.       It would be funny if 8man does it in the same style Iroha rejects him     Yui: "I'm taking everything"   Sets up a 3p date  Yui wants the sandwich end.      It was pre-genuine It was shocking so she had little time to sort out her feelings She handled it eventually, she was fine in volume 8.      Who cares? Yui is Setsuna 2.0    Arguably it being fake is what makes it worse.  Honestly I don't get how people can even think that 8man's half-confession to Iroha is fake/a lie considering the massive shitstorm that the last fake confession kicked up. 8man should have learned his lesson about that kind of thing by now.       8man's half-confession to Iroha  when       onestly I don't get how people can even think that 8man's half-confession   Wait what          8man's half-confession to Iroha is fake/a lie  what level of delusion have you irohafags come to?        Yukino doesn't have a jealous streak nor is she the obsessive type so she will take the loss well.  Have you even read the novels? Yukino has a major jealous streak, volume 10 was filled to the brim with her getting green eyed over the tiniest things. And while obsessive is a bit extreme, she does have issues along those lines if we take Haruno's words at face value.    I wish "Iroha Indirect Kiss Methodology and Studies" could be spun into its own separate thread.    嫌いじゃねえ is pretty commonly used as a confession-lite.     What did Setsuna do? Why does everyone seem to hate her?      This is actually under debate here and on 2ch. He is either stepping over the line romantically or rejecting her, but Watari's wordplay make it impossible to know for sure.      Hey, I'm an Irohafag but I honestly have no clue what you're talking about. What "half confession"?   Because you are seriously reaching quite a bit if you take anything 8man has said as a confession towards Iroha.    He's said something along those lines plenty of times before in the series. "I don't hate it", is his way of being roundabout, it isn't a confession in any way.

If you're being an autismal purist, at least take it all the way.    ‘Latin-derived languages can't share words’  Just because Italian and French share a large part of their respective vocabularies doesn't mean the term "Anime" is suddenly of Italian origin. By that logic you might as well say it's of English origin, or German origin.  tl;dr: Holy shit you're too autismal to be normal but too normal to be autistic.                 all of these Summer imports from r/anime who are extremely butthurt that they got called out on their newfaggotry so their only comeback is "a-autistic its f-french anyway   You're all very pathetic and not doing yourselves any favors.

I'm at work right now, I stopped reading yesterday after using fucking Rule Breaker on Sakura. Fucking Rule Breaker man, how did fucking Shirou figure that out.          I HATE IT.    Best girl in every route.     stopping right in the middle of final climax   literally 1/2 (goat) scenes away from ending  For what purpose.     Worst girl with the worst servant literal the shitest combination there is     Worst girl with best girl  Ftfy.     I have no idea how you have managed to go this long without being spoiled, but you should probably finish the VN before coming back to this thread.    Only good heroine tbh.    Best fighter in Fate/Unlimited Codes    It was 2am bro. I had work.   Okay, will avoid /a/ until I finish it.        waifu   you must like getting cucked by cartoon characters, kill yourself m8.       cucked   Implying a girl that waited for her loved one until the day she died of old age would ever cuck you  Senpai pls      It's a meme. In the end she only has one worm left in her and it's not where you think it is.   Of course, I wouldn't be surprised if the people who only started using this term recently don't even know that.       annoying in F/uc   annoying in CFF       fate best route   Are we supposed to take you seriously?     I've grown to like her. Not my favorite TM girl, but I don't think she deserves the hate she gets.  Ufotable managed to make her look the best out of the three heroines.   This I do agree with.     She always looked the best though.     Dat everything 10/10     I wonder if Sakura would look better if she kept her old black hair/blue eyes combo.   We could have had all this moe but shit happened  YAY Penis shaped worms everywhere!   Who is that?    LOL     not recognizing wakame     Here's your wormslut 2x.    Here's your Carenslut 2x.     It's not really a spoiler is to tell him that Shirou figured out to use it because of his weapon based ability to read NPs.  Mainly because he tells you in every route it's a dagger that cancels contracts, and wouldn't you know it, Ilya tells him the night before Sakura is possessed through a contract.         literally has sex for the purpose of procreation       Too bad her father will always be best girl.       did you forget your uniform's pants?      Would Kirei give a shit that anyone's lusting over his daughter?    Caren is an angel that has no regard to her personal health. The reason men lust is because of their inner evil who she seeks to cure.    Why would he?  If someone is lusting over your daughteru it just means your genes produced a high level human.      Wise words anon.    that looks so fucken retarded with no pants     Kirei giving a shit about anything that doesn't involve people suffering    Smug Sakura is best Sakura.   FHA Sakura is the miracle of the universe. It's what made me like her.    I want to hear Sakura's OH HO HO HO.    Carnival Phantasm Sakura is better.    The Matou household was the best part of that.    Which boards would Shinji browse /a/?    Best stalker.    People don't actually read the VN  Besides, ubw is the only route that people properly spoil      /sp/, /v/ and /pol/.    She was by far the best part of the date episode.      Literally fucked All the World's Evils      He'd be making bait threads on /v/ to get lots of (you)s, I bet    People base their opinions in what primaries write here, they won't read the original source.    Didn't she take over the Matou household in CP?    I have this huge urge to protect Caren.    She fucked Sakura's baby, the pedo.     Zouken accepting his fate and going with it    It's pretty clear most people who post in Fate threads haven't read the VN which is why I find it hilarious whenever they try to discuss something they have only partial knowledge about.       She did in HA so probably    Caren purifies those who lust<br/>    He'd make trash talk threads about Rin every day.     he's the luviaposter     So all those posts about Rin's face is Shinji samefagging?    Indeed     Sakurafags     No, Tohsaka Rhino is a common sentiment.    Avenger and Caren were great in HA     6666     I don't blame her, I'd fuck Avenger too.    Avenger &gt; Shirou     no Avenger/Bazett intimate bonding     Pay attention to when he first meets Caster in HF. Something similar happens in Fate's route.  The only time Rule Breaker works is when  Caster keeps it hidden in UBW's route. In the others, where she shows it, he can somehow know what it does, so there is precedence.    Seriously, just finish the VN        she is best girl.   Who would top?    Even Beast's Lair is full of Zero secondaries. In the UBW thread, they always ask basic stuff related to Fate, letting everybody know that they haven't read stay night for shit, but only watched Zero and read the wiki. Now they're discussing if that black haired guy in Rider's RM was Waver or not, when it was confirmed years ago that he wasn't. I like all related to Fate, but the Zero anime was a mistake.    Answering people's basic questions is better than discussing Shirou's ideals for the millionth time.     cliche eroge    asking this question    I really wonder.       Better than regular Sakura.      I mean, it's ok to me if anime only fans discuss topics they have full knowledge of, but what I do find annoying is when some smartass who hasn't read any of the source material is 100% convinced he's right despite the fact that the VNs and side material prove him completely wrong.   I get that not everyone has read everything TM related (not even possible if you don't know moon), but at least don't be stubborn when someone that has tells you you're wrong.         BL   Never registered, but I lurked semi consistently for years. Last time I checked it was overrun with new members, at least the UBW anime thread. Somehow made me lose interest. So it's the same now?      I like her.   She's been getting some good art since the HF movie/s got announced.   Yeah, it is. Also, the more japanese you know, the longer your dick is apparently. There's also this insufferable Zero secondary, Christemo.  At the end of the day, there's only /a/ to have serious discussions about TM stuff. The shitposting is too much sometimes, but you guys know your shit very well.       we will never get femdominant H scenes in Tsukihime or anything Fate related   Life's cruel.       femdominant   The closest we got to that was the F/HA threesome but that didn't end on that note, that's for sure.     It never does. Most femdom doujins end with the guy taking over.     the more japanese you know, the longer your dick is apparently   Probably because the deeper you go into TM discussions the more you need shit that wasn't "officially" translated so moonreaders are treasured like an endangered species.     you guys know your shit very well.  Hmm, somewhat debatable. Funny enough, sometimes it feels like I can recognize certain BL members in /a/ threads by their posting styles. It's trippy as fuck.         Best than Saber, worst than Rin. Her route was the best route though even if the 50% of it is absolutely shit.   I used to go to Beast's Lair for all the translations. For a long time it was a very homogenized community where most people had a similar level of knowledge about Type Moon shit so I can understand why they'd be annoyed by the change.    HF is a mix of shit and gold. The best parts are my favorite out of the entire VN but that goddawful pacing kind of shits on it.      Her route was the best route  And she tried so hard to ruin it     Mai waifu    Christemo  I hate that fucking guy but he's no a secondary      Why is this dude particularly annoying?      implying retarded non-humans count     Really? I was bored one day and I started watching recommended videos on youtube, then reading some comments I saw this guy posting and he had a visibly boner for Zero's Rider.   He's a complete ass.       Tell that to Sakura :^)    Hard to describe. You'd have to lurk BL for a while.  The 2 weeks he was banned were perfect        Sakura's face  I want this voiced, now.     Kohaku's dream H-scene has her dominating Shiki and fingering his ass.     this is supposed to be significantly big   Takeuchi really can't into breasts.      He has a Gil,Karna and Ozymandias boner.    but he can into very long, disproportionate arms.    I'd post that pic of her comparing herself to Krillin, but I don't have it at the moment.    That's from 2005 by the way. This is from 2015.  Now compare this Sakura to the VN Sakura. 2015 Sakura's boobs are huge and I love that.       Dark Sakura  Sexy as fuck.     He's a slenderfag. Compare Rin's body most of the time to the way she looks in ufo's anime. She's a stick but I'd say she was intended to be that way since her measurements fit that. Ufo's the one who exaggerated her curves.    He started making everyone's tits bigger with time. Take Saber for example. The change isn't as noticeable but it's there.   Has Takeuchi accepted the ways of the breast men with age?      Fate remake with this bbygurl when    I love Takeuchi's design, and what ufo does isn't Takeuchi's. Fate/Grand Order is more Takeuchi like, that Archer in the CM actually looks like Archer.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bZa<wbr>buND1LjU</wbr>  [ ]      This  Compare this Rin to Ufotable Rin.      That Sakura, mmm.    Takeuchi got better with proportions with time but even now he draws them pretty slender.     She's a stick but I'd say she was intended to be that way since her measurements fit that  Not realy. Both describtion and sprites/CGs of Rin say otherwise. They just can't into numbers       I was talking more about hips and thighs.    Woah, what's that gooey white stuff?    well at that you're right. Takeuchi legs and arms as sticks which doesn't fit with the description considering that Rin is extremly trained      Eh, it's like the one time she shows off ever, give her a break.  Considering she behaves so humbly 90% of the time, she should strut her stuff.  The funny thing is that she still seems to be growing, as it's implied she got even larger six months after the war. If she was flatter than Saber a year before the war, and is growing even further afterwards, she should be quite the chesty champ in her 20's the rate she is going.         Sakura's ass and hips are supposed to be bigger than Rin's but that's not the idea you'd get from just looking at them. Nasu tells Takeuchi one thing and he draws another. In the end it really doesn't matter considering now they're just going it whatever looks the most attractive    I prefer the 2.0 model.    Not that guy but the way Rin's drawn even in the anime doesn't show her to be "trained". It looks more like she's naturally well endowed rather than toned (in the ass and legs area). Basically, they're not really caring much about the details. Can't really expect them to, though.     She would be an altogether different prototype, since Zouken has used his family for experiments for decades. Anyone who took on his work (foolish as they are), would be something different. Parasites based on familiars are a whole different branch of research.      You will never bury your face in Liz's chest    I like the fun size version better.    What's funny is that they made Rin flatter in the anime, but her ass, thighs and hips all got a boost.      Sakura's ass is supposed to be second only to Ciel iirc. With child bearing hips.  Also, she was able to wrestle down Taiga, so the constant archery training should give her more upper arm strength and tone.       The only thing that makes me suffer is Rin's fucked up eyes.     Ufo can't into consistency, look at the shot where Kirei puts his hand between her breasts, they look big.     Didn't Nasu say Rin was the "ass" heroine and Sakura the "tits" one?   Nothing makes sense anymore.      I think that was fanservice, not necessarily inconsistency. They draw over CG models, so it should be consistent for the most part unless they really, really fuck up.     Then what's Saber the heroine of? Moe?    May as well   Worst girl and a wormslut   It's the same consistency you see in eroge. Every girl gets bigger tits and ass in their H scene. Like this anon said , it's fanservice.   Where can i download F/HA? It tried erogedownload.com, but after i assembled all parts into 1 (like i did with fate stay night) i cant play it  Is there any easier way to download it (englisch ttranslated of course)     Download iso, install, apply patch.     He probably thought it was unfair not to give a title to Rin, but he says Sakura has a dynamite body constantly.   Don't know why he didn't just call her Queen of Twintails, or Queen of Zettai Ryouiki. That way he could call Sakura the Queen of Curves and it's all good.       Food   Sakura and Rider have the best porn.    What's funny is that they made Rin flatter in the anime  Not realy. It's just perspective and ufotable not being the most consistent      It's far more likely that he forgot the numbers he pulled out of his ass ages ago.     What's funny is that they made Rin flatter in the anime  I think it's the other way around      I'd post the bathroom scene now but I can't find it. Consistency is probably to blame.     I love her.    The bathroom scene is a matter of perspective.   Regardless of which girl you like the best, who would you say is most compatible with Shirou?   I have an idea of the one most compatible with Assassin.    Rin. Sakura he has to change the entirety of who he is to work with. He has nice compatability with Saber actually, but it never seems like anything more than him just admiring how perfect she is. With Rin he has actual back-and-forth chemistry.    Compatible? Saber. They are both way too obsessed with their ideals. Best for him? Probably Sakura.     cute girl just thinks assassin is some kind of overgrown chuuni but she likes it like that    Saegusa a best, isn't she?    Get the iso from nyaa and the patch from Beast's Lair        Rin, he needs a lady to be a butler to.    your body will never be made of swords  Why live?    Shitty peado bait character. Rin is best girl, followed by Seibah.       peado bait character   literally what       responding to bait  Literally retard      you will never be as /fit/ as Shirou   you will never have an edgy chant to release your powers   you will never date genderbent King Arthur   you will never have a cute white-haired girl following you around   &gt;you will never have a bro like Lancer   Reading Fate just hurts, doesn't it?            Kirei will never beat the shit out of you         Anyone who took on his work (foolish as they are)  How so? Their only major hiccup was an unforeseeable turn of events that resulted from their being too successful.      gil will never call you a mongrel      your future self will never come back to the past and try to kill you for being a dense motherfucker      Shinji will never act tsun over you      your cooking will never be as good as Shirou's      you will never be a natural ginger      Avenger talks about raping her the entire game   doesn't      Avanger loves Caren.    Bazett is fucking ugly and too old.    Avenger knows who the best girl is    How can you live with such shit taste?    Kill yourself    Kohaku a best    Saber definitely. Those two are literally made for each other.    This.     Sakura is the only one with her own key to his house and open access, plus they just work together in the kitchen like wizards. Did you not see how they naturally just shoot the shit on cooking in Hollow? They act like they are a married couple running an inn of wayward residents.      Yes, and in both Zouken's case and theirs, it's because the material was special, not their handiwork.     I do not think of her. Nice route tho    What? I get why you'd say that about Sakura, but in Tsubaki's case I can't recall any mention of her being exceptional in any way other than because of what her parents had done to her.     Because with such heinous experiments, the subject would die immediately if they couldn't handle it. Especially if they are copying someone as reckless as Zouken, who was also copying the Einzberns.     Not that anon but please she is already kicking him out of the kitchen in heaven's feel true end.    Don't care, not Rider.    Yes!    I'm gonna marry that girl    Good taste Saberfriend.    oh senpai, did I turn you on?    slutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslu<wbr>tslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutsl<wbr>utslutslutslutslutslutslutslutsluts<wbr>lutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslut<wbr>slutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslu<wbr>tslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutsl<wbr>utslutslutslutslutslut</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    But Shirou only ever gets to truly understand how bro Lancer is in UBW.   Shirou will never summon Cu and train in the art of the runic muscle wizard   Cu will never get to poke fun at Rin's tsun when she agrees to cooperate and mess with their relationship by tricking Shirou to go out with him to pick up chicks  Goddammit, F/SN needed an option to choose your Servant.       Why in ubw route, she isn't a master    Fake assassin all the way. If I have to load the temple gate onto a truck I'll do it. That nigger has style.      She actually is.   She could've switched places with her sister   she's sweet, even though he was two timing her she never said a word and patiently waited for her turn.    That smile and unnerving patience is what makes her dangerous     Heaven's Feel could have been an Ilya route   Instead we get Wormslut      Please, don't take your lolicon blueballs out on Sakura, she's a good girl.  If anyone should've stepped aside for the Ilya route, it's Saber. He already spends half that route hanging out with Ilya      And the most beautiful part is that the Illya route could've been about love, but not as a couple... but as siblings.  Damn, fuck HF.      No competition.     Implying Sakura's role in HF is more or less a plot device     Illya is literally nothing more than a plot device and I don't see anybody hating her for that. Maybe we should start doing that too from here on.    good    A plot device to develop other characters? But she's arguably one of the most developed ones, compare the amount of shifting to her point of view in HF to the treatment Rin and especially Saber get in their routes. She has an insane amount of intermissions narrating what's going on inside her mind.    HOLY FUCK MY DICK IS MADE OF BLADES    Sakura's story is over, Ilya's story of pure love between siblings will be retold for generations     Illya is literally nothing more than a plot device  How dare you say something like that to Student No.1   Develop  She made Shirou abandon his ideology for her, she made Saber her slave, I say that the development was only to make others gravitate around her.       How big is "big poster"?     I know I definitely enjoyed the dialog between Shirou and Rin the most.     How is Shirou supposed to raise a kid in a situation where he decides to be a superhero and save everyone. You'd think it would be kind of cool to say your dad is a superhero, but in reality it'd be something ore along the lines of.  my dad is never home   my dad might die at anytime   am I not more important to him than those other people he's trying to save   I can't call him sometimes when he's away   everyone else's dad shows up to the track meet, but mine   missing all of his kid's important milestones   getting a call about his death sometime in the future   Having a kid would be a bad idea.             fate best route     Sakura.    Japanese dads are kind of different from what I understand. You're supposed to respect that they're away at work trying to do stuff.  I mean Kerry wasn't there for Shirou as much as people would like to think. He made multiple trips abroad to take care of business and try and rescue Ilya, but Shirou still was in awe over the guy.      Shirou will eventually outgrow the ideal, probably take a homely career or be a stay at home dad with Tohsaka being the man in the relationship and making the money.    So basically the same deal Shirou got with Kerry until the Grail AIDS got him What could go wrong?     THAT ISN'T FUN AT ALL, TOHSAKA!     &gt;everyone else's dad shows up to the track meet, but mine  That one makes me feel bad      outgrow the ideal  good joke      just stop crying and go fuck Sakura, Shirou     Why thank you. Saved.   Oh you have no idea.        Sakura     Yes, Sakura, Archer told him too, probably regrets not fucking her when he had the chance.    Kiritsugu isn't exactly the name I'd associate with a good father figure, and Shirou was still in awe because the guy saved home form death and he had seigi no mikata on the brain    What could go wrong?  Shirou is planning to create another broken JusticeBot child        That's basically what she said in the scene, more or less     Kiritsugu isn't exactly the name I'd associate with a good father figure   He literally raised someone who managed to beat the shit out of a demi-god. He did something right.         Shirou will eventually outgrow the ideal      Shirou will eventually outgrow the ideal, probably take a homely career or be a stay at home dad     I think this makes it clear that Shirou is only fit to father Sakura's children      He will eventually reach the ideals he had in HF and you know it.      If you think that, you kind of missed the point. I mean this shit should be fresh in your head, they laid it out for you right at the beginning of the last episode of UBW.     eventually outgrow the ideal  This isn't HF     Why would he do that?    What, that there isn't anything wrong with it? I got that point, but one day he will outgrow it as it is a childish ideal. He just grew up faster in HF.     He literally reflected on how Archer spent his entire life following it, and if Archer could, he could as well.    Best look, best route, worst girl. Tragic.      entire life  So, to his upper twenties/low thirties?     That would make his answer completely useless, I he decided pursuing his impossible ideal was the right decision why would he abandon it when he encounters a consequence he expected? HF Shirou is the family man, UBW Shirou is the heroman     UBW Shirou is the heroman  But anon, everyone grows up eventually. Shirou is a just a little on the slow side.      We don't know how long he lived precisely, but out of all the Shirous, Archer was at the most disadvantaged with help and experience. It would take 20 years for Fate Shirou to master UBW, and he edged out plain Archer Shirou a little bit. Archer completely fucked up his arm the first time he projected.  UBW Shirou is miles ahead of Archer in terms of where he was in experience and support at this point in his life.       Yes     Rin's the only one with an H scene that lives it ambiguous on whether or not she's pregnant, though.     everyone grows up eventually.   posting this, surrounded my man children on a vietnamese cartoon image board      His ideal is not about growing up, it's just an ideal. He knows it is impossible but so what?     surrounded my man children   a lot of people prefer the solitary hero route over the happy family route  Its true.     What talents would Shirou's children have? Other than the obvious Magic with Rin, Cooking with Sakura, or Kendo with Saber.   I have no clue why people would prefer the ending where he becomes a hero rather than a Real Doll. It's just crazy.   Best Slut. But Rin is best girl.    If he still has Avalon in him, maybe his sperm would be enchanted and they'd inherit his sword autism.     But Rin is best girl  Reminder that Waver said Rin is worst Japanese.      Muh fan fiction  I don't even know where he has the time to become a superhero during the 5 years of clocktower shit. But nothing indicated that he was going to leave Rin in UBW to become a hero.      everyone grows up eventually.     He seems to take jobs here and there. HA references a time where he and Luvia teamed up to take out a Dead Apostle on a cruise ship.   We'll never see that story fully written       Fuck you, m8. She deserved to grow up.     The 1/4th Finnish part is carrying her.    Which is fine, that's far from solitary hero or never coming back. He is not going full Archer in UBW that was kinda the whole point of the route.     HA references a time where he and Luvia teamed up to take out a Dead Apostle on a cruise ship.  There's a better man for that job.    Is type moon ever going to release another visual novel? Jesus christ.   Last one they did didn't turn out so hot.    If it's with Rin or Sakura he or she will have an inexplicable propensity of high jumping.  Sakura: Boy - soft spoken and really attached to his mom. Girl - Spent too much time around her aunt Rin and becomes a Rin Part 2; Electric boogaloo  Rin: Boy - Self important and really into magic. Girl - Always wants to visit Sakura like Rin's granddaughter and becomes the ultimate housewife.        Tsukihime remake. Completely new visual novel? Probably not.     Sexiest heroine by far, by virtue of having big tits and  no pupils     This is their last 5 years. 1 mobile game, 2 psp games, and 1 actual visual novel no one even cares to translate. Fucking rip.   We've heard nothing about that in some time.        becomes a Rin Part 2; Electric boogaloo  give her an electra complex and they'd have a 10/10 kid     Fate/Zero The Adventure   What?     Meant to quote     Weird mobile game.    For comparison, key's last 5 years. 2 spin-off VNs being translated at an abysmal rate, an actually good visual novel, 2 mobile games, and 2 works in development. Not much better, but at least Rewrite was good and Angel Beats might be good after all the episodes have been released. Episode 1 releases in 2 days.   Mobile games are the future for Vn devs, and they all suck. The VN industry in general is shit except for the nukige/otome.       It looks like it's just the novel with screen caps of the anime inserted in as CGs. Fucking lame.   I swear this is the only good FSN doujin ever   You haven't read enough F/SN doujins,  but that was pretty fucking great.     My problem with FSN doujins is that Rin and Saber  do nothing for me     That's because they're shit. Go read some Rider and Caren doujins instead.   I have never fapped to anything Type Moon. Ever.   Sad, strange little man.     Go read some Rider and Caren doujins instead.   Nah, those two are fucking shit too. Sakura is the most attractive of the bunch.     RIN A BEST!   Just off the top of my head http://exhentai.org/g/447616/3e62e9<wbr>9244/ http://exhentai.org/g/471870/a590f1<wbr>166d/ http://exhentai.org/g/86717/18dd053<wbr>8fe/ http://exhentai.org/g/120202/d98ff8<wbr>ac8e/ http://exhentai.org/g/215930/894ba6<wbr>c51c/ http://exhentai.org/g/553141/2d9e10<wbr>2323/ http://exhentai.org/g/540266/34a2df<wbr>982b/ http://exhentai.org/g/816141/dfddd1<wbr>1eff/</wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>      I like this one and the Dark Sakura/normal Sakura too.        http://exhentai.org/g/86717/18dd05<wbr>38fe/</wbr>   http://exhentai.org/g/215930/894ba<wbr>6c51c/</wbr>  Personal favorites      Nigga please, Sakura is the best of the main 3, but she's far from the most attractive.    meant for<br/>    Rider has the blandest character design in all FSN    Hey man, me too. It's usually becasue i'm way too into the story.    I seriously don't understand the appeal of Rider. She's hardly even a character in the original novel.      not fapping to   Neco Arc   pleb        Not liking tall, megane, sweater-puppy onee-sans  Get a load of this faggot.  What is HA?       eh, but if you look at Type-moon's visual novels historically they follow a pretty slow release schedule. It was 4 years between Tsukihime and f/sn. I'd start getting worried if we didn't get anything before the end of 2016. Besides, isn't the Tsukihime remake STILL in the works? They have been working on the TV anime in some capacity I assume, then there's the movie... All in all they must be pretty busy having to spread Nasu and Takeuchi over so many projects.    HA does make her okay, but she's a little above Hassan-tier in FSN.    To be fair, Kagetsu Tohya came out between Tsuki and FSN.   Best grills.    Not liking tall, megane, sweater-puppy onee-sans  I like all that, but Rider has a very boring design.  What is HA?  what is the original vn         That's true, but based on the fact that f/ha came out a year after f/sn as well, it's probable that making a followup is much easier for them than a new ip. Mahotsukai no Yoru didn't do as well, so maybe they had to shelve a planned followup? I don't really know how far in advance they work so one can only speculate.    1 vn/5 years is pretty bad though Nitro+ for another comparison     From what I understand, there were a couple of things that held Mahoyo back. Namely, it was completely linear, had no voice acting, and was only 1/3rd of the story.    You have a severe deficiency of good taste.  Rider has one of the best character designs out of them all. It's also not her fault that she gets almost no focus in FSN. Her characterization time is in HA, just like most of the other servants besides saber and archer.    I recognize that face   HA Sakura walks like a thug.     Rider has one of the best character designs out of them all.   big tits in a gimp-esque suit      5pb, but only things they developed/assisted in developing    Given the company started out as a doujin circle it's probably much less well organised than something like Key or Nitro+. Nasu and Takeuchi can only work on so much. Who knows how much staff they actually have.  http://www.girlswork-animation.com/<wbr>  This is going to come out at some point too (probably).  </wbr>      I'm talking about her body, not servant attire. Her casual outfit is top-tier if you want to bring up clothing, though.    Type Moon doesn't just make VNs, they have multiple projects going on at the same time. Grand Order, Tsukihime are the things that Nasu is directly writing right now, but let's not forget the fact that he's overseeing the anime, the future HF movie, multiple manga like the Heaven's Feel one and Prisma, as well as multimedia projects like Strange Fake, and Case Files as far as LNs go.  There's honestly probably more I'm forgetting, too.      fapping to something so pure     where do i find more    Actually Hassan has more personality than Rider in HF   How would anons feel for a dark Sakura with Lancelot install?   Didn't Prisma pretty much do that?     Erect     Already happened       Fate is the best route.  Maybe not objectively, but in my heart it is.     Fate is better than HF.     sakurafags trying to start waifuwars  Just stop      Did nothing wrong and yet is completely shit on by other anons for things outside her control.      Not liking tall   liking tall women       tripfags in charge of plot     It would be inferior to Master Artoria with Gawain install.     secondary detected.  Fuck off tripshit.       Did we read the same novel? Everything was predestined for her to fail.      eats people and rapes Tohsaka "nothing wrong"     Her entire character made the route much less enjoyable. She did everything wrong starting with going to Zouken for what could be the dumbest plan imaginable, and then becoming the antagonist out of pure retardation.     rapes Tohsaka  Shirou did this and nobody bats an eye      Implying Rin didn't secretly enjoy the jackhammering    Will Salad awaken the rinnegan due to the mixing of her Uchiha and Uzumaki blood?  fuck off.   Do we really need a new thread? Just wait until the chapter comes out or else we'll look like a general.       Sakura is the mum, but that doesn't need to be biological. No one denies that for all intent and purposes Sakura raised Salad as her own and influenced her the most. But that is not proof for blood relation.   Honestly, man? If the very last page is Sarada punching the ground and cracking it, chances are this may be the first time Sarada has ever displayed super strength.  In other words, unless observation was enough or it's going to be revealed that Sakura helps train Sarada, Kishi might be doing that to say she actually has Sakura's genes.          Not this shit again. Senju/Uchiha blood alone isn't enough for Rinnegan you retarded nigger    but it is     Kishi might be doing that to say she actually has Sakura's genes.   Does it mean that Sakura is a secret Senju?      No, you need actual Asura and Indra blood, to recreate Hagoromo's power. That's why Madara could get it but Obito not.      Hanabi and Konohamaru marriying.   No, never, ever. Out with your shit taste.    Sarada losing her Uchiha name   That's not how clan systems work.  Hinata "lost" hers because she's not the Hyuga heir, though. But if Naruto wasn't the Hokage or wasn't famous. He would had adopted the Hyuga name, as Neji stated in the SD spin-off.               yeah, are we supposed to believe that pink shit is tsunade's secret biological daughter?     More like Sarada got that super chakra control that Sakura have.     Bort can pull off some fucking Rasengan Chidori Zeus lightning bolt shit by the time he's 12    Salad gets 1 tomoe and punches things really hard  And they're supposed to be rivals how?       No.  You need to have them have Indra and Ashura's chakra with Hagoromo, which means you nees to have them be the literal reincarnations of them.  And the current incarnations, Naruto and Sasuke are alive.       "EVIL is dead. She's not here anymore! But through my spoilers, and in my heart, she lives on in me! Trolling the Sakura cucks to pierce the heavens! Even if their salty tears become my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I'm Rai I'm not my sister Evil! I am myself! Rai the Leaker! Certain Kill!...Giga...CUCK... BREAKER!!!!"    Anyone who ACTUALLY thinks sakura won't turn out the biological mom is a moron   I dunno. Anybody who thinks Kishi will be perfectly predictable in his writing either is the biggest moron I think.  I hope for landwhale tears, but I can deal with any outcome. Remember that for SS a winning scenario is just that pink and sauce have an incredibly distant relationship for dubious reasons of mission obligations.        Come the fuck on    All the talk about cucking by /a/ is just for getting on /ss/ fangirl's nerves, the reality is probably much simpler. Especially since none of us could truly imagine Sasuke getting an erection for anything or anyone.   Most likely. Let's just say for the sake of argument this isn't all a ruse, that Sarada is biologically Karin's either by way of experiment or birth, does anyone seriously believe that Kishi would NOT end this all in a way where Sasuke is forgiven for whatever wrongs he may have done and Sakura looks like the most perfect mother Sarada could have had?  He's already trying to play off Sasuke's complete absence as not that big a deal considering the nature of his "top sikrit mission" even though it makes no sense that he couldn't have at least tried to contact Sarada or Sakura once in awhile when he sent reports to Naruto. And he's already gone through a painstaking effort to make Sakura looks a gentle yet fierce mother hen.  Even if Sasuke did actually do it with Karin in the end, Kishi will find some way to make it look like Sasuke din do nuffin'         Reminder that not all Sakurafags are crazy and that she's great in The Last and Gaiden even if you didn't like her in the main series.   Is Rai trolling?    That wasn't what he was referring to. He was talking about the onion's backstab.    No, the "not Sakura side" means that the Shins Jr betray Shin Sr, but not to go to Sakura's side    If Sarada's super punch were evidence of her lineage then Sarada wouldn't have had doubts in the first place.     Face it, Kishi has delayed any talk of Salad's genes and instead tried to show that her legal parents care about her, and that she resemble them in ways that matters. This is expected as we already know they are going to be still together in the movie. But Kishi is not settling the genetic thing this week, he just showed the family element.      Not bad chapter.    No way this is ending in 1 more chapter.    Sarada's fighting style...same as her mama!    Shin father betrayed by Shin jr....    I never said Sakura's side...    Of course their own side.   No Rinnegan this week.    Sasuke cares about his wife.   Sarada smiles looking the two of them.                   You could have prevented this   Please refrain from ever posting like that again. Thank you.    Not crazy, maybe, but all of them have shit taste for liking such a terrible cunt.    No.    You're wrong. All adopted children are treated like shit by their parents. No parent will love their adopted child as much as their blood child. Don't disagree with me you're wrong. Adopted children are better off aborted.     She was bretty gud in The Last, but pretty shit in Gaiden except in the flashbacks I guess.  At any point in the story has the justification for her feelings for sauce ever been given? There's never been anything I've seen to indicate anything but a dumb preteen crush held onto with retard level tenacity.         does anyone seriously believe that Kishi would NOT end this all in a way where Sasuke is forgiven for whatever wrongs he may have done and Sakura looks like the most perfect mother Sarada could have had?  Basically yeah, either way SS stays canon. It's just that SS fangirls have this romantic fantasy that doesn't match the actual manga, so even though SS is canon they still complain that they didn't get the exact thing they wanted.     fuck on, boku wa onahole    At the very least I'm willing to accept that a minority of sakurafags are sane. Other than that, sakurafags are fucked in the head. If you say something nice about another female char, expect the usual "BUT SAKURA IS BETTERER!!1!". They literally think the series revolves around her vagina.  Actually, scratch the "another female char" part, its Hinata. Sakurafags have a extreme inferiority complex regarding Hinata, they hate her guts.     Does Naruto died   From which filler you got this?     Where does it say that?      And your complete post is just plain fucking wrong, Bloodfag.    Sakura's fighting style is the least objectionable part of her character.  Unfortunately, Taijutsu users fucking suck in Naruto.     With some notable exception.    Sarada's fighting style is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura's    Boruto's fighting style is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke's   Kishi really loves that edgelord.       coming right up    Well he is autistic.    No.  He got downgraded to Damsel in Distress.        Well you are a nigger     didn't kill   will never walk again (would've died had jesus not taken the wheel)   implying all taijutsu users aren't absolutely shit tier.       Hes eating chips with Chouchou    Taijutsu with Sharingan might be decent.    And Sasuke is the one to rescue him.  Guess without editors Kishi would have killed Naruto and made Sasuke the MC.      He literally saved the world just by being good enough to fight Uchiha Madara for 10 minutes.  And I'm not talking about edo tensei Uchiha Madara.        Basically yeah, either way SS stays canon.   Exactly. But I think some people were blinded by their hatred of SS and/or its fandom that they didn't stop to think that no matter what Sasuke did, SS would remain canon and we'd be expected to believe Sasuke cares about Sakura even with very little evidence. It's just the awkwardness of Kishi's writing this whole episode and this pairing is hilarious in that he expects us to believe Sasuke really does love Sakura even though he's never there for her and may have had a kid with someone else, and this is after he tried to kill her multiple times.  Would anybody be surprised if Sasuke admitted to actually having sex with Karin and dumping her kid on Sakura for some ten or more years while he ran around waiting for the plot to fall into his lap and then just said "Sorry"? That's just as believable to me as Kishi writing that Sarada having Karin DNA is all a misunderstanding.          Anticipated such a family would eventually appear  How does that make any sense? They knew an incarnation of Indra or Asura would eat part of the other one? Even then, "family" makes absolutely no sense in that context.    I wish naruto had an eye technique   So why did Madara hide underground until he was an old man on his death bed to do all the shit that he did?    Its just dumbasses not seeing the big picture. Sarada has perfect chaka control, she'll be able steal/copy more shit and make her own   If Sarada got a mangekyo sharingan, what should it look like and what special ability should it grant?      literally a general  MODS        Stupid Boruto! I'm going to become the Hokage!   Then I'm going to fuck the Hokage.   w-wait what       Dude, Guy is easily in the top 5 full power Madara&gt;Kaguya&gt;Jesus&gt;Sauce&gt;8-gates Guy&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obito&gt;Hashirama&gt;doesn't matter anymore     Sakura had perfect chakra control and she was the biggest jobber in the series.     Ah, forgot about that.  But since all he needed was Hashirama's DNA, that is, his genes, shouldn't that mean that if you have the DNA of both transmigrants, you could get a Rinnegan?      They called her fucking salad    she'll be able steal/copy more shit and make her own  Not with 1 tomoe she won't.      Exactly. But I think some people were blinded by their hatred of SS and/or its fandom that they didn't stop to think that no matter what Sasuke did, SS would remain canon and we'd be expected to believe Sasuke cares about Sakura even with very little evidence  I don't think any of us is blinded. It is the SS fangirls who are acting like lunatics because their fantasy of a perfect nuclear family was dashed. And most of us enjoy laughing at them as they tried to deny reality. The fact that they could be so crazy despite Kishi keeping their pairing intact is just hilarious to watch.     Niggastream.   Look at the second panel. He only got the Rinnegan and thus the ability to not get his shit pushed in by Hashirama if he tried anything when he was old.      niggerstream translation, was just the first I could come up with  He unlocked the Rinnegan when he was very old. And he never recovered from his last fight with Hashirama, dude fucked him up good       It's probably the same principle by which Boruto gets the whiskers.  It's chakra gene magic.        Kishi trying to be like Toriyama naming his characters after foods     Nope, nothing. A classic example of bad writing - the love at first sight trope.    more Goddamn mooninites   Where the fuck is Piccolo when you need him to nuke the moon?      Hah, if anything, its usually the opposite. My barren aunt didn't travel all the way to China for a baby she was only going to half love. If anything, my cousins were spoiled by them since they had to go through so much trouble to get them.      she was the biggest jobber in the series.   She tied against Ino and won against Sasori.  Kiba, Lee and Hinata are way worse jobbers.        You only need strong emotions, not just hatred to unlock the tomoes     Main character is literally named after a fish cake ramen topping   only just now noticing Kishimoto aping Toriyama  Come on, anon.       Guy is easily top 5!   (provided he kills himself)  Nah, taijutsu users are so bottom of the barrel that they have to suicide to be of any use. also  madara above kaguya  Nope.         Nobody likes adopted children in Japan.  If you're parents can't take care of you, you'll spend your whole life in an orphanage.        But since all he needed was Hashirama's DNA  He didn't need his genes, he needed his tissue/his cells     Not proportionate to their panel time they're not.   No, a Narutard thread will not be the most active thread on this board.    Why do people keep freaking out about this quote?        &gt;madara above kaguya   Nope.  He was tho. While she had more raw power she didn't know how to fight for shit. He basically asshandled the entire alliance and the god duo for a good 150 chapters while she only lasted about 30       why don't people pay attention to the anime I like waaaah  Naruto threads have been the most popular threads for months now. Get over it.     sex partners    Sakura barely has enough fights to consider her a jobber, and she was on the winning side of her biggest one.    Your daddy left you so you grew up to be a beta male mommied boy.    It's funny     35 posters   active  Anon pls       won against Sasori   "she" won in the same regard that a condom has sex      Sasuke smiles at Sarada  Oh god next week is gonna be a shit strom isnt it. Its too fucking comfy.     Jesus and Sauce are completely equal.   What the fuck would Gai do against full power Obito ?        Nah, taijutsu users are so bottom of the barrel that they have to suicide to be of any use.  Keep baiting fgt. Just get over the fact that Guy pushed your husbandos shit in for good     This makes more sense. Salad's skills seem more applicable in the bedroom than the battlefield.   Why I can't drop this shit? This is like a horrible guilty pleasure for me.  Someone help me kill myself. I should have dropped this turd after the Rescue Sasuke Arc.      It's not that she didn't know, how to fight it's more over that naruto and sasuke were given the macguffin needed to seal her. so without that macguffin kaguya insta wins.       replying to obvious b8       Because you like it you fucking faggot.     Tied against Ino  wow it's fucking nothing  won against Sasori  No, that was Chiyo.         It's like eating a big mac, anon. You know it's bad for you. You know it's not quality by any stretch of the imagination. But damn it you love feeling that ball of grease roll around your tongue.    Try to occupy your head with other things, I guess. Sooner of later you'll forget about it. Also, thank God you can use the old numbers captcha now, fuck picking salad    Seems that way. Maybe Kishi felt he needed 2 weeks of SS pandering before delivering the final blow.    This is what delusional Narutards actually believe.     macguffin  tvtropes pls go Also, they already got Hagoromo's powers against Madara who still managed to fuck their shit sideways      I like Hinata anon.    It was 2 against 1. By that logic, Hinata was on the winning side of her fight with Pain.     Guy pushed your husbandos shit in for good   he broke a few of madara's ribs then proceeded to roll over and die.  MIGHTY MIGHT GUY AMIRITE.      Oops wrong pic. Lol my bad anons.     Try to occupy your head with other things, I guess. Sooner of later you'll forget about it.   Nope doesn't work. I was able to drop shit like Bleach, Supernatural, and Korra but not this. Nothing works.        full power Madara was way above Obito. Guy kicked him around like a punching ball. Obito was only immune to ninjutsu, taijutsu worked just fine    But both Sasuke and Naruto were alive when Pain was alive.    Im thinking this apart of the graduation test,its all a genjustu. But i might just be crazy     Oh god next week is gonna be a shit strom isnt it.    what makes you say that?  honestly, I'm a little upset that Sarada is probably not going to hold a grudge against Sasuke.  He keeps getting away with everything.            muh Sakura didn't do anything in the Sasori fight meme     Hinata...   Don't worry, they'll get deleted after Gaiden is over, just like how the ongoing threads were deleted after the main series was over.     There is no final blow. Its over  Then you're in the minority of sakurafags       Can someone post worksafe pictures of Hinata with big boobs?  I say worksafe because the clothing covering the nipples makes it hotter     It's either Naruto, JoJo or Yahari. Pick your poison anon     What the hell is going on in this picture? Twincestuous threesome?     Okay.   Soon.       After the Gaiden there's the movie in August. But after that it's pretty much over as far as we know.   Unless that "secret" announcement 33 days from now says otherwise.       honestly, I'm a little upset that Sarada is probably not going to hold a grudge against Sasuke.  She would likely understand that Sasuke IS a shitty father, but not intentionally so. And that he would want to be a better dad if only he knows how. So she can't get too mad at him for being incompetent.     How big do you want them?    /a/ has me paranoid. I think they just wont have that as close a relationship that Sarada wanted,she wont hate him though    Paz...    The Hinata/Sakura friendship is cute.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127136721   still thinking it's just a rogue janitor  I can't help but laugh at your idiocy.     huge    And then she sees him getting all buddy buddy with Burrito and gets her 2nd tomoe.    Guy didn't die though Face it, Madara is dead and didn't get what he wanted, Guy is still alive, and though he can't use his legs, he doesn't care because he can use his hands, so he's as happy as a clam.      biggest jobber in the series.  You have to be strong to job.  Sakura isn't a jobber she's a loser.        &gt;he broke a few of madara's ribs then proceeded to roll over and die.  more than anyone else managed to do. He was going against what was basically a god and wasn't even considered kage-level before that      We got Sasuke saying in Part 1 that he would rather die trying to protect her than see her die and numerous other small hints.  So somehow he cares and then he doesn't fucking come home. The way Kishi writes it makes 0 sense.   kill her  To be fair most of the time he attacked her it was after she tried to do the same.   I would be pretty surprised if Sasuke just randomly "cheated" on her. Why? Whats the point for him? Since when does Sasuke care about Karin? If Karin is the mother then there must some kind of other explanation but its definitely possible.               Sakura   a jobber  That word doesn't mean what you think it means.      You asked for it.    cowtits. huge, disgusting cowtits    agoromo's powers against Madara who still managed to fuck their shit sideways Madara was getting fucked up by naruto and sauce before kaguya took his body. he legit ran away in fear to steal obitos rhinnigan because of how bad naruto and sasuke was fucking him up.      Sasori himself considers Sakura to have been part of the fight.       No one gets fucking banned for making these threads. No one but you and the janitor cares about the shitty standards of this dead board, retard-kun.  This board die the moment we let tumblr approved shows like Free and reddit meme shows like KLK and SnK on here. Naruto is just back on here again to shit on the corpse.           relevant to my interests     Yes, and?    It is. Pity the fandoms cannot stop comparing them and pitting them against each other.   Stop        more than anyone else managed to do  Except you know, naruto, sasuke, and black zetsu. And they did it WITHOUT HAVING TO DIE AS A SIDE EFFECT.    This chapter is just SSSfamily fun,im so glad    You sick mother fuckers...     Oh lord    Madara was backstabbed in the moment of his triumph after he regained both his original eyes      Come on, Sakura took out Hiruko, the third kazekage (that one by herself), several of Sasori's 100 puppets, hit him with the jutsu that got him to abandon his original puppet body and was the one that came up with the cure for Sasori's incurable poisons.  Hinata's fight against Pain didn't even last a panel.       If he made himself tangible. There is no reason for that.    Guy also had support during his fight with Madara who didn't bother to use any kind of Genjutsu etc.        Mitsuki is Stretch Armstong   Salad has a 1 tomoe sharingan and can punch things   Bolt is a prodigy who has shadow clones and has mastered a combination rasengan/chidori attack and has Ninja Jesuses 1+2 as his father and teacher   Thanks Kishi        Guy didn't die though  He was going to. He'll never walk again. so lets see get gud for less than time than an episode of spongebob and then never fight again, and if jesus isn't present you die. SHIT TIER   Madara is dead and didn't get what he wanted  Good.   Guy is still alive, and though he can't use his legs, he doesn't care because he can use his hands, so he's as happy as a clam.   He'll never be able to fight again. You can't be a good fighter if you die/permanently incapacitated in the process of getting gud.             If he made himself tangible. There is no reason for that.  Infused with the Juubi he just couldn't switch dimensions anymore    I'm disgusted by all of you I'm posting pure maiden Hinata  This chapter really seems like a snooze. At least the trailer was eventful.   Still, it'll be nice to see Salad in action, and not suffering. Even if all she does is kick a puppy and wet her panties when her deadbeat dad smiles at her.   I dunno. Maybe it'd be more impressive if we didn't know Bolt was cooking up electric nukes during recess.       Sasori also believes his puppets to be a part of him.    Come on, Sakura took out Hiruko, the third kazekage (that one by herself), several of Sasori's 100 puppets, hit him with the jutsu that got him to abandon his original puppet body  All masterminded and controlled by Chiyo.  and was the one that came up with the cure for Sasori's incurable poisons.  His poisons weren't incurable, just very lethal. Additionally, he changed them frequently specifically to avoid the problem of an antidote being developed.   Hinata's fight against Pain didn't even last a panel.  Still necessary for Naruto's victory.             Yeah and she totally didn't create that antidote as well that saved them.      He'll never be able to fight again. You can't be a good fighter if you die/permanently incapacitated in the process of getting gud.  He's still by far the strongest not-god in the series. What does it matter if yu die afterwards, there are probably 4 characters that would survive a fight against him     Now that was pretty impressive. She was always a better medic than she was a fighter.     Still necessary for Naruto's victory.  Do you seriously consider getting one-shot, stabbed, and Nagato neener-neenering Naruto into chimping out a proof of Hinata's superior fighting skills?     No, but I don't consider being thrown into retard punching position by Chiyo proof of Sakura's superior fighting skills either.    That moment of triumph achieved by running away and diverting naruto and sasukes attention. he would've gotten beaten anyway had black zetsu not killed him itself.    Which is why it was really dumb that Kaguya was a thing     So somehow he cares and then he doesn't fucking come home. The way Kishi writes it makes 0 sense.   It makes zero sense because Kishi wanted to write Sasuke being an absent father because of work, but didn't seem to be able to think of a better way to do it where Sasuke's complete lack of contact didn't appear self-imposed.   Since when does Sasuke care about Karin?   There were a few points before he went full darkness mode where he seemed to at least care about her as a comrade, hence why Karin was shocked when he stabbed her and called her useless. She even pointed out that he "changed," at that point. Not saying that there's much hints to the effect that he would finally return her feelings, but at least by the end, if Sasuke cared enough about Sakura to marry her, I don't see why he couldn't care enough about Karin. The idea of Sasuke showing any romantic or sexual interest in any woman is already a stretch of the imagination.   If Karin is the mother then there must some kind of other explanation but its definitely possible.   I mostly agree, I just wouldn't put Kishi having Sasuke actually sire an illegitimate child and then trying to play it off like all is forgiven because Sasuke did one good thing past him, is all.              Post more lewd Sakura and Hinata anon, it pleases my cock     That moment of triumph achieved by running away and diverting naruto and sasukes attention  So he should just let himself get beat up because he wasn't at his best before retrieving his second eye? Also, pic related is Madara getting beaten by Naruto and sauce  I mean, of course he would have been defeated, what would be the point otherwise. I'm just saying that he was a more dangerous opponent than Kaguya         He's still by far the strongest not-god in the series.   *provided he dies in ten minutes/never walks again if jesus is present  That's not how being good works anon. Even if God Guy could take every ninja jesus he still dies at a cost making the best he can get a draw. that's like saying suicide bombers are the best soldiers.      I dont have more lewd anon, but I have some cute    The third raikage died after facing off 10000 enemies. Minato died after protecting the village from the Kyuubi. They're still considered excellent fighters. Sure, he would die afterwards, that's why it's a last chance move. But if he died either way, he could still take out almost any opponent    So Kishi is going to NYCC? He ruined my life, I should go.    That pleases my heart too.    Winning isn't defeating the opponent, anon. Winning is when you protect something important to you. Guy won that fight by protecting the world.    They're considered excellent fighters because it took those things to kill them. Guy has to kill himself to git gud. not even comparable    I'm glad. Unfortunately this is the last one I have     All masterminded and controlled by Chiyo.   No. After the 3rd Kazekage is summoned and Chiyo loses her arm, Sakura starts fighting on her own.   &gt;and was the one that came up with the cure for Sasori's incurable poisons.   Chiyo says she is an expert on the topic and she can't do anything. Only Tsunade could possible come up with something.   Still necessary for Naruto's victory.   lol no              Is that by HAL?     she's great in The Last  She becomes a minor supporting cast member as a former teammate of Naruto. That is all her character ever merited and half the reason Kishi pushing muh Team 7 never worked, making people hate that cunt even more as he tried way after was of making us like her.   Gaiden  I take it you are into pathetic, mentally deranged wrecks? It's great laughing at a bad character get her comeuppance and moreso her awful fans getting butthurt, but Sakura herself has done fuck all but ruin her family home, faint, almost kill the one lead her supposed husband got in 12 years while desperately trying to stay relevant and then got kidnapped.  It's actually surprising she did not decide to start sacrificing her own organs so the bad guy survives without using up the children like people were speculating, but fuck it, even that would have shown some determination and sacrifice for others on her part. In the last chapter she just waits until the bad guy heals up, then announces she will wreck him, despite him being the only lead they have. Whether going for info or killing the bastard, she's done a shit job in a grand total of three panels.          Naruto was down and done before Hinata showed up. Without her, Naruto would have lost. Naruto himself considers this to be true.    I dont remember anon, sorry     Chiyo says she is an expert on the topic and she can't do anything. Only Tsunade could possible come up with something.   To save Kankurou. Sakura had enough skill to save Kankurou. But given enough time, anyone with poison knowledge could come up with an antidote. Congratulations, Sakura saved Kankurou.      Salad punches the ground and punts a Juubimon     Sasuke cared about Karin as a teammate but nothing else was ever shown.   For Sakura we at least got hints that show something more.   It makes no sense to turn this around suddenly.         ss fags are going to be insufferable this week   It's funny cause Sarada will be the next Hokage. She may be the first Female Useful Hokage.  Besides that Boruto seems to be a pretentious douchebah. His behavior is equal to that of the President's son being pissed cause his dad can't play Xbox One with him on the weekends cause he's too busy trying to stop ISIS.  Based Guy is the only dude worth fighting Madara. Everyone else is pure shit. I hated how Kishi shitted on all the potential the other clans and villages could have had for the UCHIHA 1337 EYE HAXS       Accompanying image.    yes    Then don't go to tumblr.   anything better   6/10 bait, but are you slightly frustrated that your Hibikek thread didn't get enough replies?     For Sakura we at least got hints that show something more.    Yeah, but not by such a huge margin as the SS fans may want to believe. All I'm saying is the now "greatest ninja" Sasuke who's been saved from his darkness caring just enough Karin to have sex with her one time but caring just a bit more about Sakura to actually make her his wife wouldn't feel too out of character for him, excusing of course the fact that Sasuke never showed anything close to a sex drive or a romantic interest in women at all and the most he gave Sakura from what we've actually seen was an Itachi headpoke.  And Kishi has made characters forgive Sasuke for a lot worse with a lot less believability.        Then how did sasuke get it? He doesn't have both halves.      But given enough time, anyone with poison knowledge could come up with an antidote.   Says who?  Chiyo said even as an expert she has no fucking clue what to do.  What good is an antidote if you need months to make one? Its useless. Your knowledge is useless. Only Sakura and Tsunade are able to properly cure the poison before the patient dies. They are extremely gifted and unique in that way.   Sakura also saved herself and Chiyo for some time which in turn saved Gaara (who is also somewhat important).             It might be due to the low res, but do Himawari's eyes look more lavender than blue? Did they just change them after The Last?   Can anyone TL what does it says?     Source? I checked his pixiv and I can't find it.     Kabuto used his snake penis to inject Senju dna inside him.    they will come here too, they have been waiting to shove sss family on /a/'s faces for weeks     What good is an antidote if you need months to make one? Its useless. Your knowledge is useless.  It helps for future poisonings. That's the whole reason Sasori rotates his poisons. Because they're not incurable.   Only Sakura and Tsunade are able to properly cure the poison before the patient dies. They are extremely gifted and unique in that way.  She saved everyone's favorite character, Kankurou.    Sakura also saved herself and Chiyo for some time which in turn saved Gaara (who is also somewhat important).   But again, she was only able to do this because it was 2-on-1.            Not sure. Bort looks similar on that page.    Uzumaki Himawari. Loves sunflowers. Hates her older brother for destroying her birthday cake when she was six years old.        It says her name, then presumably voice actor. Below, it says "Naruto and Hinata's daughter," then shit's too low res to make out. Then something about her dad.    It's honestly at too low of a resolution to tell, but her new outfit looks pretty cute.    Check his twitter.    Oh yea, I forgot about that part      Madara would've never been legitimately beaten by those two.     Watch when Himawari be the final boss of Naruto. All you fucks will be flipping your shit. You think she liked sunflowers? No she burns down sunflower fields, She has fire and Lighting Chakra nature. She has the Tensigan and studied the Hyuga Techniques in Chakra control.   This. There was no way anyone. Even KISHIMOTO himself could see how Madara would lose to Naruto and Sasuke. Madara was serious about turning Naruto into a badass Manga again and he wasn't going to let anyone get in his way.  Kishi's asspull is what stopped Madara. Madara was not wrong in anything he did. He was just too weak against the fucking writer of the story.       studied the Hyuga Techniques  Oh, no worries then, she'll be an useless jobber.     Ah. Thank you. I love his art style. Hopefully we get more for the movie.     muh jobber  are you the same dude that every thread says the same thing?    Have never read Naruto and only know this girl's name. So who is the most complex character?   The signs that it was a last minute decision were so obvious  The jutsu that Sasuke got from Hashirama was forgotten and ignored as was Tenten finding the Sage's tools.   Obito talked about how two Rinnegan would make Madara unstoppable so he just got replaced by a villain who only had Byakugan        I doubt one or two landwhales gloating about Sauce not being completely disgusted by being around Sakura can be as annoying as the NHfags constantly dumping fanart even during the middle of a chapter discussion.    Akamaru      Akamaru      Yes. Look out for "irrelevant side character" and "no development" also. Same asshole sakurafag every time.     Himawari takes over the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force from Ibiki   gets prisoners to confess using her S-rank Kawaii no Jutsu        Its enough to make Sasuke apparently marry Sakura and promise to come back + (a child?).  Sasuke also seemed confused as to what Sarada meant when she said Sakura wasn't her mom. Like he legitimately did not know what she could mean.  I just can't see him going back to Karin. Although MAYBE just maybe she was part of his redemption tour? I mean he almost killed her. Still can't see a random kid like that. Maybe Karin took a sample of his DNA or w/e.      Where does it say that Sasori rotates the poisons because they are curable? Where does it say that he does that frequently? It simply says he has a lot of them. It makes sense to use a different poison in different scenarios. Chiyo says she can't do anything.  She saved the people I listed that in turn save for example Naruo who saves the world.   The whole point is that she did it with Chiyo together. BOTH were important. Not that she did it alone.                        He is dying, anon, and there is nothing that can be done for him.    He is truly the greatest Hokage     All of Himawari's opponents suffer cardiac arrest and HNNG themselves to death.     This answer may be correct.    Karin was never more than a replacement like the rest of Taka.     Where does it say that Sasori rotates the poisons because they are curable? Where does it say that he does that frequently?  Because that's the only reason you'd need to stop using an incurable poison.   It simply says he has a lot of them. It makes sense to use a different poison in different scenarios.   Uh, no. If you have a poison that paralyzes and kills someone and is incurable, there is no reason to ever stop using it.   Chiyo says she can't do anything.  To save Kankurou   She saved the people I listed that in turn save for example Naruo who saves the world.  Hinata saved Naruto repeatedly, so she's saved the world repeatedly.   The whole point is that she did it with Chiyo together. BOTH were important. Not that she did it alone.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127135000#p127138619">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   Please post happy families   Watch the show you fucking faggot       Please post happy families   literally every pic posted has daughters   i always knew that happy families had girls and not boys       Not really a smile...     I want summer to end    Chapter 35 next month, release probably on 13th or 19th.  Chapter 34 end was Mero being recalled, Darling saving the princess?   Also no more news about the adaptation, just MON designs and VA left.           Let's hope Fish doesn't return.    Sorry anon, next arc is just for her.      I can agree with this.     Why does fish get this much hate? Is it because of the tragedy stuff? Because she already showed some development on that.       Why does fish get this much hate?  It is because she is the least dangerous girl in the house biologically, yet had almost as many Darling kills as the others.     Probably because she could be so much more.   Instead of a joke character that loves tragedy and NTR.      She has actually attempted to Murder Darling. Even Rachnee 'I nearly scared a girl for life, told her to suck it up, and lied about why I was justly kicked out' hasn't attempted that  Yet       Move ogre one tier higher and we got ourselves a deal     Accidentally hurt a girl   Justly kicked out      For that reason Rachnee is the best girl, she never kills Darling and always take care of him, even darling pointed that.    You never going to have your balls dry by a bunch of cocksuckers lamias.    Put Centorea down to F and we're good    So are all lamias pink, red, yellow or green? I want a purple Lamia.     hatting horse pussy  <br/>     liking horse pussy <br/>    THIS.    What about secret agent Lizard and Devil?   I want mia suck my dick until my balls hurts for cumming too much.   She's definitely the most fragile MM.    Imagine that tongue wrapped on your dick day and night, jesus christ why live?     no Secret Agents   no Minotaur   no Yuki-Onna   no Sheep girl         That look on Lala  She's jealous that someone gets to live out one of her chuuni fantasies, isn't she?      You're forgetting that she was ready to turn Darling over to someone who wanted to murder him, and ACTIVELY prevented the other girls from protecting him.  That's tantamount to murder.         not loving Mero   What kind of a faggot do you have to be?       Why is Fish so fucking cute? You people dont deserve her.      Miia   Was ready to outright die for Darling as a last-ditch effort to save him.    Rachnera   Was ready to let someone murder Darling due to poorly-explained reasoning and her general attitude of not giving a fuck.    These two Monmusu still on the same tier.   Aside from that, pretty good chart.              Crab&gt;Bird=Slime&gt;Death=Cyclops&gt;Demon<wbr>&gt;Sheep&gt;Snake=Fish=Zombie&gt;Doppelgang<wbr>er=Wolf&gt;Mama Snake=Mama Bird&gt;Spider&gt;Ogre=Dragon=Cow&gt;Horse=M<wbr>ama Horse&gt;Shit=Fox&gt;Smith=Snow Woman</wbr></wbr></wbr>   I like you.     Worst chart ever created on this board.     Fuck outta here.   I'm in love with Rachnera!  But I have arachnophobia!       Ms. Smith seems to be in the game    Lala's expression in that panel is kind of funny.  Also did MON drop the ball there ?       why are you angry?    Someone milk her! She's stained her fucking shirt.     I realized that Lala is a background character like Polt, but living in the house because she's never included in any art of the official page. I kinda feel sad because of it.    Enjoy your NTR Dolphin cave.    I'd be fine with Mero. Are you saying that you wouldn't drown to have sex with her?     I want to string her up with fish wire and slowly watch her roast in the sun, as her gills dry up.    See     Fuck off fagot   Fishfuckers ITT need to calm the hell down.   This sounds like the plot to some shitty romcom with an absurdly long title.     Come to think of it when doesn't MON drop the ball.    Look at this sweet little dork, god damn.   stop trying to find validation in other people's opinions of you're waifu. You're ruining the thread.    But why is it ok for everyone to do it for polt/rachnee/miia/smith every thread but not for Mero?    It's not. But you are better than that, aren't you?     yes but you're snapping at people who so much as dare to have a different waifu, People who aren't attacking mero.     It's fun though.      Whoa guys chill I didnt post that. I was just asking.     You've hallucinated an enemy.   Virtual reality monster girls when   When you decide to get off you ass and make them.    you're denying your acts of aggression.    I'll get on it after I finish my computer science classes    cool, the world will thank you    Reminder that Ms. Smith's Voice Actress is the one who sings this song.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QA<wbr>LSx1w3EgE</wbr>  [ ]     I want to get fit with wan wan   I've always wanted a workout buddy to help me get fit   thread needs more best girl    thread needs more best girl   That isn't Suu      What would sex with Lala be like?    He said best not worst.   Fish is a murderous cunt, but goddamn those tities. They have perfect size, and hang just the right amount. I'd motorboat Mero through the whole ocean, If you catch my drift.     "I'm in love with a woman who is half spider and I have a crippling fear of arachnids!" The MC takes part in a MonMusu-like extraspecies exchange program, and nearly shits his pants when he finds out the extraspecies person is a woman like Rachnera with the body of a spider. They find out they have some common interests, and generally get along, but he can never look directly at her without freaking out, she feels ashamed and starts covering her spider half, but over time he starts to get over his fears, and in the end they fall in love.     bags of sand    Lala felt pretty pointless when she was introduced, but she's really been growing on me.    She only gives... head    I thought we agreed that Fish was WorstGirl.    No one agreed to that, as you can clearly see many here like fish.  Myself included.       She'll be alot better when Crabman finally shows her topless or in those adorable panties.      Suu   worst  I'm afraid that your shit taste is terminal.       Monthly release   Fuck. I've been so hung up on other manga I've forgotten that this one releases monthly.    D tier   Dracogirl has second best butt, you take that back.           Threadly Reminder that Dullahan(like Lala) can't remove their armour.    It's perfect.     Liking only usefull for rape and when plot calls it-girl   calling it good taste   My fellow poster of African descent please.    holy fuck normal captchas are back          Is she actually called Princess Love Song? Holy fuck my sides     Uhhh... what do you call that? She sure as hell isn't wearing armor in that picture.  She is wearing goth clothes.  This whole unable to remove armor thing is a little  wrongheaded .         Just statin' mythology ma friend.    Mythology that, quite obviously, doesn't apply to Lala. She was in a sun dress on the other side of the river where Darling went to during his near death experiences afterall. And she wasn't wearing armor there.  Really, I don't know how you got this idea that it applies to her into your head, but its clearly mistaken.      Is that what her name means?   Id assume that in that case she was in her limbo location between life and death and thats why. Another better argument for that would be the onsen episode where she's only wearing a cloak and i believe shorts?        Is she bunking with them or does she stay somewhere else ?   And how is she walking around in broad daylight with a scythe for that matter ?       True indeed, she has no armor, clearly.    Trying to remember her profile now. Could've sworn it said that she has armor, but doesn't like wearing it for one reason or another.   Why is there so little art of Darling giving any of the girls the D? Horse Pussy especially.   You're remembering the original one from the original comics. She isn't Lala.  Get the idea of her armor out of your head.  Head. Head puns. HEEEEEEEAD! CRANIUM! NOGGIN! DOME! AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!         Is she bunking with them or does she stay somewhere else ?   And how is she walking around in broad daylight with a scythe for that matter ?  Scythe is blunt. And she got away with Japanese laws because it is a farming implement  .  Trying to remember her profile now. Could've sworn it said that she has armor, but doesn't like wearing it for one reason or another.  She owns a good collection but they are too uncomfortable to wear.           She might just be called a Dullahan by the author but not be one. Dullahan mythology also says that anyone who sees a Dullahan is doomed to perish soon.      There's no such thing as a correct version of a myth.  Cerea is also a cute dork.      Cool your head, anon, they're just puns. No need to lose your mind over them.     Dullahan mythology also says that anyone who sees a Dullahan is doomed to perish soon.  Her bio said that Dullahans had been sighted near sites of lethal accidents and talking to old men in nursing homes.      Now to be fair I thought she was hanging around there because of all the near death experiences "darling" seems to be subjected to.     Never caught the covered wagon before...    Lala in the beginning   "GOD SHE IS SO AWFUL. WHAT THE FUCK CRABMAN"    Lala now   Best Girl and True Winner   What happened?          Now to be fair I thought she was hanging around there because of all the near death experiences "darling" seems to be subjected to.  What do you mean, "near" death? He did die.     They're questioning which region's "Headless Person" myth she fits into. Since it says Dullahan, it is the Irish version.   Maybe all Dullahan are chuuni and just make themselves seem intimidating by lying about their mythology.        Its been like this since ch 30 came out anon where she was officially revealed as the winner.    Crabman's wonderful writing   So, after all this time what's going to happen with the Live Translations, the upcoming chapters, JwWw and Hitomi? is TF going full drama queen again and pretty anon delay chapters for more than 2 months?  I'm not trying to start a fight, but there is a lot of people who wants to know this.      You will never be 80 years old in a nursing home and be visited by a gorgeous, sweet irish Dullahan girl who sits and happily talks to you, asks if there is anything she can do for you before you die...      How about a little head?       Ch. 30  She pulled an Ozymandias     Maybe crabman's dullahan are different from the real world myth.  Maybe that's a thing that happened.     Maybe you prefer deepthroating though?    Anon get out with your logic.    Whatever happens, happens. If what you say happens, then at least there are others to fall back on and get shit done. There's no need to get bent out of shape on this one, though I guarantee that some people will.     Maybe crabman's dullahan are different from the real world myth.  Dullahans clearly are deliberately tryingf to hide their existence by pretending to be their legendary selves. It would be like a real fairy walk around wearing a badly made Tinkerbell costume and plastic glued on wings.     Like  pretty dogspeed scans  ?    Wouldn't that be the perfect disguise?     you will never enjoy post-workout cuddling with polt   why live      Damn, she's got a fine bod. I mean look at that figure   Still waiting for the chapter of Lala being seperated from her body and seeing how her body really wants to be lovey dovey and wear cute outfit for Darling.   No, too much attention drawn.    That's not really relevant since no details are constant across descriptions of the Irish Dark Man, not even headlessness. You pick the depiction you like same as anybody does, there is no correct one.     Wouldn't that be the perfect disguise?  Indeed. And a major point is that no one who came back from the land of the dead, could remember what they saw there. Because as spirits their brains were not there with them so they couldn't physically remember. There is just no point trying to explain stuff to mortals so they don't.     I don't know anymore...    The author made hentai before about the Dullahan and used that version of the mythology in his work. I go with what the author uses. I know this doesn't even mean that it is the correct version, however it does make it more likely for the author to use this version as the correct version.      Same here, all my friends are too busy for me...I need a Polt.     Hot, sweaty, panting, you collapse in exhaustion onto the large beanbag chair that was once a medicine ball, "N...no more... no more..." Upending your bottle of water down your throat, you drink deeply.   Panting herself, Polt collapses right beside you making you jerk and splutter, only to cuddle up right into your ripped and strong chest. Your months under her care have done you good.   "WAN! You did so great today, Anon! I'm so proud of you!"   Reaching up you scritch her ears, making her wiggle and snuggle into you more tightly. Her panting rising right along with yours   "J-just didn't think... I could make it! But I did it! Full triathlon in the morning, weights, then 40 km j-jog..."   Beaming up at you, Polt nods, "I'm so proud of you!" She snuggles in tight, then notices something. Coyly she looks up under her lashes at you as she tugs the waistband of your gym shorts.   "Ready for your victory lap?"           Wolves who work out can last longer in bed than lamia.    Like a dream come true    Did you really spend 5 mins of your worthless life to post all this shit taste?    see      I find it odd there is no explanation as to how she owns a stadium or how she is making Lilith or Draco do community service.        That image.    Have no idea why that looks familiar.            Remember, no bullying Respect each other's shit taste      Have no idea why that looks familiar.  Maybe you've seen it before?     Man, when that happens I'll be  losing my head     when was this?    Ms. Smith did say that all dullahans are a bit chuuni     Have no idea why that looks familiar.  Maybe you haven't played Sengoku Rance in a while? That's Uesugi Kenshin.      I have not.     She has almost the same measurements of Miia    Her official debut following the MON date chapter. She loses her head, and convinces Darling to help her look for it.    But she doesn't have what makes Miia best girl, which is her  personality     She does work for the community(most likely a leader of one now) and she explains in a page that her race is always rich thanks to their obsession with rare minerals.     Here.     Holy shit that's adorable.   Polt is fur cancer. Kill the fur.     So she bought Lilith and Draco for the whole purpose of running a marathon with her ?        No, I think it's part of some goverment deal like the sports club for extra-species.  They were just sent to Polt as punishment.      Will those scenes be added in the anime?    Still wanting to see pictures of the characters (and their moms if they have them) humanized like that and interacting with their whatever animal.     Those two got some lengthy community service then.   I think Draco was fishing for Catfish for a moment before the marathon shenanigans.   I didn't even think you could find Catfish in Japan but apparently I was wrong.        I want to like Polt, but she's too  genki  for my tastes.   You can apparently find elves and dragonnewts as well so catfish aren't much of a leap.     I didn't even think you could find Catfish in Japan but apparently I was wrong.  Invasive species, they did say that's why they are catching them.     That Gundam's reference.       Invasive species   I know where I'm going for a discount Catfish dinner then.       All the way to Japan?    I think the implication is that they continued sneaking out.     Sure why not ?   Nothing says authentic or exotic like traveling a few thousands miles for something you can probably find 5 miles down the road at a stream.      So how long until Lala wants to marry Darling?   When Lala's mom shows up    That's why I only buy my water by taking a trip Maine.     So how long until Lala wants to marry Darling?  Marriage only lasts a lifetime. That is too short. She owns his soul AFTER.     She is already lusting for him and clearly already wants his soul.  So we'll see.  We need to see her topless soon. So topless. And we need to see her and Darling Chuuni together.        Another girl gets Darling in lifetime. In death, Suu digests his body and Lala has his soul.     Her childish demeanor is endearing, but she has nothing on Rachne's mature allure.    My heart       Since the Onsen mineral water made Suu smarter would she get a notable boost in intelligence if she started drinking regular mineral water ?   I like to think Suu is always smart ever sine the Dryad arc, and that the mineral water merely changed her personality.    MADE FOR ANAL    What else can crabman do to suu of shenanigans?  We've had poison and mineral, maybe some food colouring fuckery?  Semen for slutty suu?      How long until chuuni adventures with Lala and darling?    Still waiting for those doujins       143  Holy shit      Lala falls head over heels for him when he out Chuunis her.      I want Lady Lala to be a soft-spoken very pleasant MILF.  Nothing inherently slutty about her, just a woman concerned about her child going through "that awkward phase" and making Darling promise  on the River Styx  to look after her.      Best Girl.   you mean the sanzu river      thank you based TF    Stop sucking dicks retard, since long time FwPA is full of shit, TF doesn't give a fuck about the people who supported her since the beggining, fckyeah is a retard who only shitpost in these threads and Hound just smell his own farts without doing his job.   Also they get cucked by 7seas on twitter for posting summaries instead of full translations, and got REKT by anon who does a better job than they on 3 hours.      You do know that people have lives besides working on manga translations right?     Close enough, point is Lala's mother doesn't strike me as the kind that would try to challenge Darling or try to fuck him, since Lala's pretty damn chuuni and that behavior only really comes from boring, stable families.     Ignore him. The entitlement train is always ever running around here.   Has our friendly neighbourhood shirt guy decided on where he'll put his designs up for sale?     I'm pretty sure she still retains the traits she absorbs after they've "worn off". They just get a bit watered down.      Doing a job for free doesn't mean doing a terrible job, look at other translators like Aereus for example. Also when people gently asked them what happens fckyeah just start spouting shit against the people, same as Hound. That kind of attitude just show how they doesn't have any excuse for they laziness.    When have they spouted shit?    At the same time when the guy doing the job on other page release ch 33 -34 more than 3 weeks before they with a better quality.    EL PSY CONGROO      You're saying things but have no proof. Besides the person who did the poor release had a grudge against them anyways for some reason it seems.     bust size is 62% of her height   hoo boy       No proof   Mote than 6 thread of monmusume the previous month   No releases of JwWw/MM/hitomi for more than 3 months   Still sucking dicks to FwPA   You're the most pathetic anon I've seen today.         isnt tio's bust similar?    If Tio's bust was 62% of her height she wouldn't be able to fit through doors.    bigger actually. and she's 3cm shorter, so her bust is 70% of her height.  she's not lactating though     *conspiracy to commit.    All I see is bitch bitch bitch from you.      Oh, ignore him. It's just that one guy who's pissed about not being in their group or something like that. He's the only one who brings this shit up in every thread because of his little grudge.   Let's get back to talking about best girl.        Who?    How the fuck did I miss this face? It's not from the MON date chapter, is it?       The fuck do you mean "What's going to happen to JwWw"? They just released a chapter yesterday...     There was a period of almost 4 months where they didn't release a single chapter anon.      Dude, I thought that she was bigger than Tio, but I guess Cathyl is bigger     JwWw literally got released yesterday. They've been doing a chapter a week. You are trying way too hard to be retarded anon.      I thought she was an Oni for a second.      Being this newfag   Not even in these threads since 2 years ago   Trying to fit   GTFO you piece of shit, go and suck FwPA cock you faggot.        I feel like the omakes could make a great eyecatch, or like a segue to/from a commercial. Like the bit with Polt explaining how she affords the gym could happen during the gym episode before the commercial break, then coming back from it, they do the Smith interview about who she'd like to home-stay with.      she is an oni, for some retarded reason everyone translates it as ogre     4 months   Do tell anon, where in the last half of a year has there been a '4 month' gap?  Me thinks the newfag is you my friend.        Not while FwPA has been working on it, there hasn't.     I thought she was an Oni for a second.  She IS, it is just an attempt to translate to a Western equivalent.      Guys are you this retarded for falling to that bait?       FwPA wasn't even working on it two years ago. Are you sure you aren't angry at Underdog instead?  Seriously anon, if you are going to bitch about things, at least know what you are bitching about.          Chuuni chapter when?       Oh you mean like the "speed scan" group that did MM, but translated Mero's name wrong and just plain forgot bubbles? Yeah... such quality there.    Stop fighting you massive retards.  What's the point on dwelling on this TL drama?  It doesn't add anything to the thread.  Let's just move on.         Is there any particular reason for this ?   Lorewise I was under the impression an Ogre was just person of a towering, extraordinary build while an Oni was a super-natural being capable of threatening gods in some cases ?        She is. It's just that there isn't really a convenient English equivalent term for "XXL humanoid with giant horn(s) on their foreheads".    its like how in some scans when darling die he goes to the river styx and others the sanzu river. its the sanzu river not the river styx     Lorewise I was under the impression an Ogre was just person of a towering, extraordinary build while an Oni was a super-natural being capable of threatening gods in some cases ?  There is no real Western equivalent to an Oni. Onis are closest to the evil dragons of Western lore that heroes go on quests to kill. They tend to be last bosses in a fairytale. But obviously they are humanoid and not dragons, so the closest thing is ogres.  Another close thing is Demons, but since Oni don't serve some evil god the similarity is not that close.       Please anon, let's go with the accurate translation: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tc8<wbr>iu0XFUQc</wbr>  [ ]       They couldn't just say Oni then ?   I'm sure they are familiar to some in the west given they show up in other popular media like Mortal Kombat or Touhou.   And if shes an "Ogre" then what did the translations call Yukio or Lulz for that matter ?          Because Yukio shows up 20, and Kinu 23 chapters after MON's debut.   So when do you think monster musume will end?  So would you be afraid of her ?   Why would I? She looks pretty chill.    But she's so cold to people.    She's too n ice  to be scary.     VA left   Wait, what?      You'll just have to break the ice.     Kii is a grade-A cutie and would be cool for the household, but not as a harem member.      I want to say "no" but we're talking about a tall, attractive woman with a very severe face and icy demeanor.  I'd probably be terrified of her.        Fear but also an erection      Also no more news about the adaptation, just MON designs and VA left.   as in we are still waiting for this information.English can be improved by practicing everyday, apparently by browsing 4chan     when does the anime come out?   Sometime in July   So, when is the next episode going to come out?  So far I really liked the premise and the show. What do you guys think about it?  I do not know how to start propper threads on /a/        I should've stated that this was a Punch Line thread so that it could've been easily searched, oh well, I hope people notice the pic.    Comes out tomorrow the ending  is a bad end loop begins again    How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        <br/>    Coz dio never experienced thus like jotaro Jotaro was more experienced moving when others stopped time It was the first time for lord dio no sama      oh, thanks    It is explained in the fight itself. There is a reason why Jotaro used his time stop right after Dio's ninth second ended. Think about it.     DIO stops time   ROADAROLLADA   Jotaro manages to oraora himself out   ZA WARUDO hits its limit   STAHPLATNUM doesn't    DIO's left side heals slower than his right   DIO's left leg was recently knocked clean off   both knees just broken   JOTARO PUNCH to left knee   How do people not understand this shit. as far as asspulls go, this one at least makes sense.                DIO's left side heals slower than his right   DIO's left leg was recently knocked clean off   both knees just broken   JOTARO PUNCH to left knee   How do people not understand this shit. as far as asspulls go, this one at least makes sense.   I thought dio absorbing josephs blood finally made him complete since we know longer see the scar, without it, you just explained everything but with it , its just odd.        That final fight was bullshit the idea that two people have the same stand implies that they have an identical soul It would have been better if after absorbing Josephs blood Dio realized DahWurldoh had negative side effects that weren't apparent before. Jotaro picks up on this and renders DahWulrdoh useless, playing into the trope that when you understand the enemy stand you win This is why Jotaro is undefeated, you can understand his stand but still cant defend against it because it's brute force Then after everyone gets the fight they wanted to see, Star Platnum vs full OP vampire Dio Seriously, Dio never once used his laser eyes, tentacles or ice powers he had in Act I Would have been way better to see a classic Man vs Monster slug fest           More like, how did Dio heal Vanilla Ice when he chopped his own head off?      We don't see Jotaro escape but we do see blood beneath the machine use to crush him     more like, how vanilla ice needed to die again before he became a vampire and when he gt his own head chopped off and dio gave him his blood.    The undead shouldn't have stands in the first place A stand is a manifestation of soul or whatever and vampires/zombies are very lacking in that department      I dont know about dio but ice already had his stand . has it ever been said in any medium that vampires lose their soul?    He had Star Platinum bring him some tomatoes. Remember D'arby?    Why didn't DIO notice him escape since he wasn't frozen in time when Jotaro escaped?    Too busy muda muda and gloating, using up his two seconds in Jotaro's time stop   what I want to know is what the hell can you do in 2 secs? apparently jotaro can do alot.   I'm pretty sure in Phantom Blood they kinda talk about that when they introduce zombies    Pretty sure Jotaro was crushed before 9 seconds so he should have still been frozen   The 2 seconds later were for nothing       classic Man vs Monster slug fest  We already had that in part 1, how about some variety? You autists and your double standards are silly. "Monster of the week is shit, but I want every part to be exactly like part1/part2.     Dio brought people who had been dead for decades back to life.   Will part 2 get a print jojonium release in English? Everything I read only talks about it being released in digital    This is true    This is also true. I just assumed it was the work of his stand.         according to an extra little book araki wrote, vampirism is an early attempt at producing a stand. Vampires attain unique stand like abilities known as modes. Each vampire has their own unique ability much like a stand. The pillar men have the most obvious, but Dio had his unique ice ability, wired beck had his spike ability, etc.  The side effect of gaining these psuedo stands was becoming undead.   So i think its safe to say that vampires and zombies are capable of possessing a stand, since their abilities are rooted in stands to begin with.          Vanilla Ice is probably the best example.     Dont the ripple final objective was a full fledge stand?  I mean like being Spin counterpart, and Johnny getting Act 4 and Gyro Ballbreaker? Pls don't kill me because i thought of something     Reminder that the only people Dio killed were  Danny Joestar   a couple of chavs   George Joestar I   Dire   Jonathan Joestar   Noriaki Kakyoin   So just about as much as Kira. Kars and his Diavolo killed dozens more and Pucci literally killed the entire Part 6 cast save Emporio. Dio is one of the cleaner characters.          Why was this Loli so good?  Himeragi a shit. Threadly reminder.   Is the One Piece anime that bad? I got all caught up with the Manga and I'm thinking about watching the anime just for fun, but I see it talked about on here fairly negatively.  Is it shitty? What's wrong with it? The production value and animation look unreal from what I've seen     Previous thread  Summaries still happening  Reminder that Yoshino is a slut      I am a wizard   Happy 30 years of virgiñity /a/non.   I wonder if it's not too late for summary anon.   Reminder that Shiori a lewd. Lewd!    Stop this sexualization of DALs    I should be OK for 3-4 hours more (maybe 3). Let's see if I could finish it.    Okay, thanks for all the work!    I see, then it sould be fine.     ñ  Cita una viva     Good to hear that, I really appreciate this summary.    If you want to write "Date a Live" in spanish, it would be: "Cita en Vivo"    Ratatoskr is filled with assholes  Let's just kill both DEM and Ratatoskr members together.    with Dainslaif    Wrong this anon is correct     If it's Shiori it's fine. She's used goods whose already done it with 8 other girls after all.    Kill the shidou!   Not possible, it was designed to kill Shidou and only Shidou.    Vivo seria lo correcto si fuera Date Alive. En este caso sin embargo, Date A Live, se traduciría "literalmente" como "Cita Una Viva"    I wonder... I'm from Spain after all, so I guess I should have more experience... that is what you get when translating it on google translate but you shouldn't trust that translator too much.    Seriously, whoever didn't see this coming must be stupid. They were too shady to be good guys.

Es una traducción literal, es correcta, literalmente pero no "traducido"     using google translate to translate spanish  That's even worse than using it to translate English.      el quiere una traducción libre  Porque no vas y le chupa la picha a los de commie?  En todo caso, fui yo el que "tradujo" la vara en el primer post.       It's a satellite who fires a laser beam. Even if it's designed to kill Shidou, it's not like the laser beam only reacts to Shidou's body alone. I'd say we try firing Dainslaif, kill those retards and hope they die. If not, we'll let Kurumi eat them    What if it has only a shoot? and Kotori said it was designed to kill only Shidou so maybe it only reacts to him.   How come she's so best?    It's even worse than that.  Trying to use Google Translate to translate MADE UP English to Spanish.      All big organizations are evil   If they could do that I don't think the Fraxinas would need Kotori's power to use its strongest weapon.    - That's why Woodman decided to give the access to &lt;Dainslaif&gt; only to Kotori, even if that means he is pushing her to shoot her own brother. Woodman tell everyone to calm down in a calm voice. Even though the situation might be the worst, it doesn't mean they're out of choices already.  - Douglas and Almsted make a dubious face. Clayton make an angry face and raise up his voice at Woodman asking him what would he do to improve the situation. Woodman then tell him he don't know either, but as long as Itsuka Commander don't give up, he also don't plan to.  - Woodman look at the three with sharp eyes. The three then make a dissatisfied face. It's no doubt that they thought he is being unreasonable. But for Woodman, he think there is still a chance for Shidou to recover.  - The problem is that Woodman don't think the three in front of him are worthy enough to know the reason behind the 'chance'. What Woodman could do right now is to buy Kotori some time.  - Woodman then say to them he understand he is making an unreasonable request, so in exchange he offer to give them 1% of Asgard Electronics' stock he own every single minute spent.         hecho arriba     my Kin!    - None of the three answered right away. Asgard Electronics is the only other company than DEM who can make Realizer. It is also the back behind &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s technology and also Woodman's lifeline.  - To them, the deal sounds too good to be true. Woodman laugh inside his head, that the longer they hesitate, the more time he could made for Kotori. However, the alarm indicating the Spirit Power raising interrupted their thought.  - Clayton choked and yell that there is no way to open the Path and there is no way to stop the berserk of Shidou. He then take out a small terminal from his pocket. - Woodman saw that and choked. It is the same terminal that Woodman and Kotori have, the key to &lt;Dainslaif&gt;. Clayton asked where he got that. Clayton answered him with an old proverb "be prepared and have no regrets" saying there is always a way out somewhere. Woodman called him to stop, but Clayton didn't listened. He then pushed the button without a second thought.   ◇         Nah, following JRPGs logic Ratatoskr would be the good guys if DEM was an empire and they the rebels.     1%  Seriously?     Vale, vale, tranquilo. Solo doy mi punto de vista. Comparto tu opinión con lo de: "Date a Live" y Date Alive". Pero no te enojes    this asshole    That's nearly 2 hours he could buy for her.    and here we go.     Woah. Kaguya bros are active tonight. I like. Kaguya is my favorite twin and is in my top 5.     No anon, no.  Ahora vas a tener que tomar responsabilidad por enojarme.     1% each minute.   Tactical death lazer inbound   Waiting for Phantom    Phantom soon?    I love you Anons   I want Yoshino to sit on my lap while I feed her cupcakes and we watch TV.   If by 2hrs you mean just a few of minutes then yeah you are right.    Damn.    Reine when?     mfw Kotori trusted in this organization     trust no one     Will Shidou ever find out Ratatoskr tried to kill him?     Not even yourself!    Dat trust in Kotori. Woodman has my vote for next selections of executives.     These guys are not better than DEM.     maybe, then he will like fuck you guys I do this on my own now     Not even my mama?     Reine for President    Stop touching my waifu    I'm still waiting for the scene where he finds out about Mana's condition.   Thank goodness. About time shidou died   death is the only way out     implying you can kill him     ...not even your mama!    Mana's reaction will be even worse, first DEM lied to her and now Ratatoskr is trying to kill Shidou.    Mana is best imouto     How much is left?     MANA ISN'T AN IMOUTO. KOTORI IS   Pic related   Go to bed Kotori.    The whole book? About 10%.    Mana is his real little sister    Kotori pls.   Mana needs more screen time!      This went quite as expected. Guess that the plot is really going to go forward rather sooner than later.       This works better for Kurumi and her clones, especially rooftop.  ;_;      He then take out a small terminal from his pocket.   - Woodman saw that and choked   Didn't see that coming at all. Well, let's see what could possibly go wrong with this.       Yeah but it's almost over if what this guy said is true     Star fest Kurumi was best Kurumi    - Kotori wiped the tear with the back of her hands while sniffing her nose and say in a little desperate voice that they should laugh at her. She acted all high-and-mighty and this is how she looked now. - Origami then shook her head and say to her that she is glad Kotori is Shidou's sister and encourage her since there should be still some way.  - All other Spirits also do the same with everyone telling her they will help. However, the next moment, an alarm rang from the terminal she dropped on the ground earlier interrupting everyone's voice.   '— &lt;Dainslaif&gt; activation code detected. Commercing attack to the target.'  - Kotori choked at the voice and pick up the terminal. Origami looked into the terminal with a shock on her face. She asked Kotori what happened and was it activate because of the impact from her dropping it earlier.  - Kotori tell her the terminal isn't made so you could easily mis-manipulate it. Kotori don't know why &lt;Dainslaif&gt; was activated out of sudden and tried to cancel. However, it's already too late.  - The next moment after a light flashed in the sky like a shooting star, Kotori and others' views are covered with light. "Shidou!!" Kotori shouted all she could and extend her hand toward Shidou.  - However Shidou's fate can't be changed by just those action. Shidou disappeared with the light. The attack hollowed out the ground. The impact blown Kotori and others who were standing nearby — or so she thought that would happen.  - But it didn't. "Eh…?" Kotori who stiffen her body blinked her eyes few times before she raise her face up. Other spirits also do the same. A wall made of Spirit Power is created above them, or more accurately, above Shidou, protecting him from &lt;Dainslaif&gt;'s attack. - Kotori widen her eyes. She thought for a second that Shidou used his Spirit Power to block that attack, however, that is different.  [—Phew, that was dangerous.]                 That's almost nothing, I don't want it to end.   I want to marry Kotori.    Didn't see that coming at all. Well, let's see what could possibly go wrong with this.   implying this wasn't going to happen from the start     Yuugou shoukan!   Oh god here we go   Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts       Phantom time!    incoming Phantom=Reine    I never trusted ratatoskr since the beginning considering the bad support they gave to Shidou.    slut and a retard    WHERE'S REINE?    It's happening!    I know, just making a joke. Even in Volume 2-ish, it was stated that some of the higher ups were shady characters.    Other then you know not just doing this for laughs but to prevent a worse disaster from happening. It's not like they know there is going to be some last minute plot device that keeps Shidou from going boom.    but Mio has long hair and Rinne is Phantom     It's time...    Miku is worst girl  Mio's profile page   How can she be best imouto? What kind of an imouto doesn't know what her onii-chan is involved in? Only Kotori does and is there for him.    but they are doing this for personal gain, ready to dispose of Shidou and the spirits if necessary.   Kaguya a cutie   Phantom is true end   REINE= Phantom   STATS=Happening    Not that guy but she trusts in Shidou willing to leave her previous organization to fight for him, she also agrees with his way of thinking.    Disgusting.  Post better quality pictures.    Reminder RU is canon   Just let him be autistic.  Yuzuru is best twin       Or maybe not.      Shes cute no matter what     Rio   Mio   Seriously Tachibana?       How can Phantom stop a Shidou going berserk? This will be good to read.        Or maybe not.  going with not      Phantom doesn't  Tohka talks to him and then hugs him and then kisses him at midnight and the magic is dispelled  REMEMBER HOW HER FORESHADOWED IT?        How strong can Phantom be if she able to stop such attack.    retard gets best moment    That sounds lame    Never said they were perfect but they aren't doing strike that will wipe out the city and Shidou is a real threat to people right now. At this point Shidou going boom does more damage then the event 30 years ago.   DEM does worse stuff for revenge on getting a papercut      Godly    Seriously? That sounds boring as fuck and here I was expecting something interesting to happen.    Author likes retard    That's because they planned to kill Shidou since the beginning, just read the summary again and you can see their true intentions.    I'm pretty sure phantom just went to prevent his death.    Phantom is the first spirit    Phantom saved Shidou but he's still out of control. Someone must stop him.    Hopefully not    That's it? I know Tohka is the main girl and all but giving him the best scene when she wasn't even relevant in the entire volume is too much.     &gt;Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice.   DaL really feels like it is begin don on the fly sometimes.      You mean these sluts? They are just Tachibana's failed attempts to give Origami friends.    Hopefully they stay gone forever. and the AST too.    It looks different in Japanese     AST  Who?     Author sure likes the retard    I have they only planned to kill him if he became too dangerous and I believe exploding killing himself and 10's of millions of people counts as being too dangerous    The AST is dead, now we need to get rid of DEM and the wizards.     Yoshino is a slut   Truly.      Kotori is closer, knows intimate things Mana doesn't, and is there for him in greater capacity. Also, her love is constantly maximum, and romantic at that.    Not really, they didn't even bother to find a way to keep Shidou alive and chose to kill him if something goes wrong. Elliott is the only one who acutally cares about the spirits.    Kotori: Her love is maximum    Kotori a brocon hoe     greater capacity  If by greater capacity you mean making his dates worse by giving bad advice then yeah you are right.     Mana must has been really close to Shidou if he was depressed even after the Itsuka family adopted him.    I wonder if Phantom knows about Mio and that she is very close.     not the full version     What about those girls from DAS?    Date A Strike is irrelevant in the new timeline.    Mikie a cute, Fujimura a slut.    Who?    Ok, so what do you call the whole dating to fix the problem not trying to find a way to keep him alive? Their opinion is it failed which Kotori also believed until being talked down since by tnhe looks of it Shidou is starting to go critical. Please enlightened me what other options they have to stop him from exploding and doing more damage then the event 30 years ago?    Tohka is one of his favorites after all    shame the other favorite   Kurumi  didn't get a date in this volume       I want to hug this Clock.   me too    Are you even following this conversation? What I'm saying is that chose this solution just because it coincided with their objective but they knew a disaster was bound to happen but they didn't care and decided to kill him. The point is that they didn't give a shit about Shidou's life when they went for this alternative rather than just think something else, it's not like spirits were killing people and they have been happening for 30 years.    Because she is unsealed but Origami got her date, she also another favorite.   Miku is worst girl     Damn this dude sucks!  best girl is Miku       Is Phantom evil or just a very kind spirit?   What? Kotori knows what she is doing when she is serious. The girls and Woodman knows she is excellent at what she does. Gag galgame scene are her playing around or taking chance to make things interesting. She doesn't willingly try to put him in danger she believes he would die from that would prove too much for regeneration.    Seems normal for any siblings that care/like each other.       I will forgive this as long as her arc is fucking amazing  also did Star fest even happen now that time changed?      Anti-hero  Think Godzilla.      Not evil    Yes, Origami is totally unrelated to Rooftop Kurumi    That sounds good and all but it doesn't actually work when Shidou is dating spirits.    - There is another Spirit appeared above Shidou. Actually, Kotori don't really know if that is really a Spirit. The being appeared over there has a silhouette of a human but is covered by a noise.   "You are —!"  - Kotori said with her fingers shaking. Other Spirits also have the similar reaction to Kotori, especially Miku and Origami who have met 'that' first-handed. Miku is badly shaken up. Origami stares at the noise with a cautious looks on her face. - She is the Spirit that created Spirits. The one who gave Kotori, Miku and Kotori the Sephira — &lt;Phantom&gt;. Kotori called the name, &lt;Phantom&gt; then open her mouth,  […It seems humans also do things recklessly too.] "I don't want to hear that from you!"  - &lt;Phantom&gt; jokingly said that and turned herself around. The barrier that covered above Shidou like an umbrella then disappeared. Kotori frown at &lt;Phantom&gt;'s words. - Kotori thought that she is an indirect cause that caused Shidou to become like this. Because she turned Kotori into a Spirit five years ago and make Shidou seal her, that caused him to take the risk of getting berserk.  - Thinking to that, a question then popped up in Kotori's mind. Why is &lt;Phantom&gt; appearing right now — and why did she saved Shidou from &lt;Dainslaif&gt;?  "&lt;Phantom&gt;, what are you?"  - Kotori asked, but &lt;Phantom&gt; did not answer. &lt;Phantom&gt; then looked at Shidou.  […I see, his condition is pretty dangerous. I could understand your painful determination. — But I still need him to be alive.] "W-what are you saying…"                       - Kotori raise up her voice with confusion. &lt;Phantom&gt; then came down in front of Shidou as if she don't care about the Spirit Power that whirled around him.  […Good boy.]  - &lt;Phantom&gt; said with a gentle voice and touch Shidou's forehead. The next moment, Shidou screamed and wrenched his body. He hollowed the scenery around him and continue moving in straight line to somewhere.  "S-Shido!?" "Darling!" "What did you do to Shidou!" "Agreement. The situation is becoming worse."  - &lt;Phantom&gt; breath out a sigh a little.  [—What kind of greeting is that. Even though I just gave you a chance.] "What…!?" "! Kotori! Look!"  - Kotori frown, but Tohka raised up her voice. Kotori then noticed that the Spirit Power that surrounded Shidou has become weaker.   "This is…" […From now on is your domain. I wish you a good luck. — See you later, *all my cute kids.*] "…!? What—"  - Kotori raise up her voice at &lt;Phantom&gt;'s words however &lt;Phantom&gt; did not replied. She turned over and disappeared in the air. Kotori called her a stop and tried running to her, but Yoshino tell her it is more important to save Shidou right now.  - Kotori stopped and nodded to Yoshino. Kotori then explained that Shidou's Spirit Power has now weakened a little even though she don't know what &lt;Phantom&gt; did.                            Reine best girl     […I see, his condition is pretty dangerous. I could understand your painful determination. — But I still need him to be alive.]  She "needs" him?     Is this the first time the other girls meet Phantom?    - Tohka widen her eyes at Kotori's words. Kotori nodded and tell her that though now they're one step back from the worst, it doesn't change the fact that this is desperate situation. Even though they have make their way through that Spirit Power to kiss Shidou, it's difficult for them right now to do it. - Heard that, Kaguya laughed "Kaka!" and tell her it's easy. Yuzuru agreed with her. Then then took their each other's hands and make a pose. Kotori tell them it's not easy, but both of them looked at each other and loosen their lips then trying to concentrate.  - Kaguya and Yuzuru then manifested their Limited Astral Dress. Kotori choked. Kaguya and Yuzuru are using the very last bit of Spirit Power that were left in their body for their Limited Astral Dress. - Kotori called them asking what they are planning to do but she her words mis-sentence. Even though it's dangerous to use Limited Astral Dress right now, or in worst case they might even die, there's no other way to get to him.  - Kotori then tell them with a dangerous face that judging from Natsumi's case from earlier, the longest they could be in that form is about 5 minutes. - Heard that, Yamai cheerfully laugh to Kotori saying that is enough for them. They then nodded to each other and run to the direction where Shidou is heading.  ◇           Also  "Still"  Phantom is just using shidou for her own purposes        FUSION. SCUM.    Jesus christ. Will we ever get clarity on phantom.     — See you later, *all my cute kids.*]  best mom      Phantom confirmed for mother      Tsunako    Stop Sexualization  Don't think thats possible       I don't know what to think about this?     love the twins  Kaguya's chuui       NEED HIM FOR WHAT?  DOES HE MATTER AFTER THAT? WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL THIS DAMN IT      I know it's obvious they would save him but to do it with that amount of power is ridiculous.     Dat 'ka ka' laugh  Chuuni moe.     why do they have QUALITY like this?     Even more question, what could be Phantom's power?     it's so great     Phantom for keikaku doori  for some reason I'm feeling Kotori and the spirits might quit Ratatoskr after this, anyone else feeling that?        […From now on is your domain. I wish you a good luck. — See you later, *all my cute kids.*]   Phantom confirmed for first spirit?      same    Are you fucking retarded or just slowpoke?     Nah, how will be Kotori able to support Shidou without her position as commander?     I feel like Woodman will give some encouragement to Kotori and everyone else will just play it off like nothing happened, but will keep suspicions.    ehh they might just get rid of the guy who fired the thing    not like it really helped    We had two possible candidates for the first spirit. Shidou and Phantom but seeing how she called the spirit "her kids" makes me think she is the first spirit.    I'm new to this Show, does the main character do any fighting, or is he just spergs with the girls and get beat up? If he is just a push-over I dont think I will enjoy it very much...   I dont expect him to be as good as the MC from DxD but maybe I will be surprised?       Reminder that Yoshino is a slut   slut   for one guy   How?        True but The Fraxinas is still good for teleportation.    Yeah, nah. 8n the end, Shidou is usually the one that clears the date by being himself. But he wouldn't have gotten as far without technical help from Kotori and her crews. Kotori's iconic quote is the signal for a successful and inevitable date, bumps and shit hitting the fans is expected for this series.    MC is a chuuni edgelord, drop while you can    No, now go away.    he does do a lot of fighting actually, he's pretty strong, you should watch and see    I want to impregante Yoshino cumming buckets of semen inside her tight pussy, then lick her little clit and use some cream to put my dick on her ass and fill her inners with more semen.   Obviously every day.      If what you want is another wish fulfillment harem then read something else.    Faggot go back to your hole    Yeah he does. He gets strong     So you want it to be a generic haremshit?    <br/>  How can Kotori be this cute?   DAL is not really a battle harem and I don't think you will be able to self insert into the MC.     Nice one guys! Hopefully he falls for it!     a slut is a slut    It doesn't have a fanfic tier writing if that what you asking.     He never does really. Being stronger than some cannon fodder wizards is nothing significant.   A non-sealed spirit would kill him with 0 problems.       Haha yes it does     Flatori   Cute   Kill yourself.       That scene had me laughing so fucking hard and I usually hate that kind of antic.   Now you're trying to spread lies, but it makes me wonder what if Kurumi, Kaguya and Shido met in their chuuni phase.       At first, he starts off very weak and doesn't do any fighting. But right when he needed to fight the most, he does it. From that point on he started fightning.    The series goes full dragon ball Z   Kaguya is love   Anon, don't lie to yourself.     not wanting a pushover   coming to DAL  I don't know what to say to you. Go ahead and watch it I guess.      Yeah it's pretty good, he starts out a nobody, but at the current volume he's ridiculously strong    I want NBR Imoutos to leave.    Not really, It doesn't have an overpowered MC who gets all the bitches by doing nothing or a dark and edgy handosme boy who attracts all the bitches.    Cute and HOT.    Baiting by flaming dfc  Here's your reply.            Now you're trying to spread lies, but it makes me wonder what if Kurumi, Kaguya and Shido met in their chuuni phase.   that would be great       He becomes the next Hokage!    xyz plebs   &gt;tfw Tohka in charge in using retard's deck        hollowed  Is this supposed to be "flattened", or is he screaming? It'd be "hollering", in that case.   I wish you a good luck  all good luck   did not replied  reply   but Yoshino tell her   told  Mostly tense confusion.                He aims to become the pirate king of the ninjas.    Looks like Yuzuru's got a great Kaguya impression.    retard    Mana pls go.    He's basically Aizen meets Light     Why does she need him?     Shidou isn't a particularly great guy, yet theses girls instantly fall in love with him in usually a few hours.    In*    It's TWGOK meets Fate Stay/Night.    for her plan obviously which is much greater than Kurumi's.  I reckon Kurumi is also being used by her in a way      This. But Shido haven't jackhammered anyone yet.    Becaus he gains the girls love/trust through effort and no some bullshit like defeating the villain of the week.    Play the game     cause she dose look up to her after all  Kaguya a cutie       Come to think of it, Kurumi and Kaguya are a different kind of chuuni than Shido. Shido's all about the GREAT POWER and DOWN MY SWORD HAND! Kurumi and Kaguya roleplay dark maidens of the night, so they'd get along better than the boor.  Until Kurumi stopped playing around and started actually eating people at least.   Hallelujah. One mana transfer dragon is enough, and the less said about dolphins the better.          Liking DxD   Jesus christ these -18 kiddos are fucking retarded, they shit on every single harem series with better setup than their shitty LN. How can be them so assblasted and retarded at the same time?     Miku is worst girl   DxD is great, fuck off   Hope Shidou gets some character development. I only want him to be a bit more decisive. Please Tachibana!   Because it has hot girls, the writting goes full retard but they claim since it doesn' take itself seriously it's okay, also waifu wars. You can't even discuss the series at this point.     Until Kurumi stopped playing around and started actually eating people at least.   im pretty sure she only kills assholes  past Kurumi was more chuui        Flattened. Thanks for fixing!    XYZ REVOLUTION!    Wish fulfillment, I like it but it goes full retard sometimes.     DxDretard detected   Go back to your containtment board /v/irgin.      Game =/= canon  But I really liked the pregnant Origami end.      it will never happen    Not really, she has a death count of 10000+ people.    We all know Shun is here for the Ruris  or rather Yuzuru for she is a Ruri or rather a Rin who has a pendulum for a weapon. Funny how Yuzuru hits all of the Ruris except Serena(Yuzu in her name and has a Pendulum, Rin's voice, is blonde like Ruri, can wield a bow) .   Phantom is confirmed for Spirit No. 000, who is said to be the origin of the tree.       My pleasure. Mind if I do the rest?     Wish fulfillment   You have LN's like Shinmai Maou, Hagure Yusha, WB, and others to complete that. Is not necesary to stay with a novel full of boob teasing and retardation anon.      Rinne Utopia is canon though.    but was it just 10000+ assholes    So DxD threads and the fanbase are shit, also the LN/show is bad at this point.    and Mahouka and SAO.    Yes, anon. I know.   Everyone forgot her and she never appeared beyond the games so she's not relevant.       I don't mind, but I think you better fix when it's going to be put in Pastebin. I don't keep track of posts here when writing summaries so I might missed it.     im pretty sure she only kills assholes  Them she killed for pleasure. There's a reason that Mana wants her dead, and it's that she used to be FAR less discriminating in who she ate.     No it wasn't.  Kurumi kills anyone she wants. Kurumi doesn't care about humans, only meeting her goals and she'll do what she wishes to get there. Anything.      And Campione.     10000+ assholes  Are you retarded? Remember in volume 3 how she was willing to destroy the whole school with a spacequake?     It's CHUUNI, WITH A FUCKING N  IF I READ CHUUI ONE MORE FUCKING TIME      Read the fucking novels faggot.    I don't think shes as bad as you say she is, sure shes crazy but there are still good parts to her, it never said she killed Innocent people    What?    Chewni.   I did.       I will then. We stopped pasting about three threads back, and I've got two of them bookmarked.    I guess Shidou's school is filled with assholes then.    that was a bluff of desperation    Did you miss the line where it's stated Shidou found Phantom's fake form somewhat familiar? There is also some important info in RU like the whole thing with the spirit becoming a time bomb and Rinne being part of bigger spirits.    She's gotten a LOT better since Kotori scared her straight. Original Kurumi would cheerfully depopulate a city or two for the City of Devouring Time. And she WAS going to kill Shido because he was right there, even if she's only been joking about it since then.   Kurumi actually fired the quake. It failed because Kotori countered it.        Kurumi   desperation  Desperation for what? Nobody was attacking her and she actually used a spacequake that Kotori managed to stop in time.      It never said she only killed bad people either. Even if there's good there is also bad, hence why she remains out there unsealed.    Except she casted a spacequake upon the school but Kotori stopped it.     Rin's voice  Shit, I just realised.     rooftop Kurumi was afraid it said that in the novel    Are you retarded? That wasn't rooftop Kurumi, remember the clones can't do that shit.    we won't know for sure till we explore her past in her sealing arc    no before real Kurumi showed up     forgetting why it's rooftop in the first place  anon please     What are you even saying? We are talking about the fact Kurumi used a spacequake to destroy the school and clones are unable to do that.    Her first snaks in volume 3 were just a group of guys hitting on her. While they were not paragons of the community they were hardly scum of the earth. And what about that building she was stealing the life force of everyone inside. And she wasn't bluffing Kotori has to act to block the quake.    she was afraid of losing to Tohka so she started the quake    What?     she was afraid of losing to Tohka so she started the quake  What the fuck? It's this bait or someting? Kurumi defear both Tohka and Origami and almost killed Mana.     he's right    rooftop was there to prevent real Kurumi from falling for shido    You don't need to samefag     See you later, *all my cute kids.*  BEST MOM E S T  M O M              Despite the struggles of Tohka and Origami, they were unable to escape their bonds.    Kurumi snickered as she walked in front of Shidou, stopping her footsteps.    At this point, Kurumi's eyebrow twitched as though she had just remembered something.    "Fufu——That's right."    Saying that, she put the gun in her right hand to her left hand; following that she raised it up high.    Soon after, just like before, another spacequake alarm started to sound out.    "Wha......, Kurumi, what are you planning to——"    "Ufufu, fufu. The same thing as before of course. Everyone hasn't woken up yet——Ufufu, they'll definitely die for sure."    "St, stop it......! If you are going to do such a thing, I will bite off my tongue——"    The instant he said that, the Kurumis that were holding Shidou down, inserted their slender fingers into Shidou's mouth from both sides, pressing down on his lower jaw and tongue.                        Looks up Rinne Utopia again   "Been awhile since I read the summaries"   Sees DAL Wiki   Rinne Utopia Article   Date A Live: Rinne Utopia (凜祢ユートピア Dēto A Raibu Rinne Yūtopia?) is a game produced by Compile Heart and Sting Entertainment.     Sting Entertainment   No wonder it was depressing. Fuck it all makes sense now.            Do you want to know something else anon? If you put Yuzuru's name together with Rin's, you get YuzuruRin where there is a hidden Ruri bonus .   Miku is worst girl    inserted their slender fingers into Shidou's mouth from both sides, pressing down on his lower jaw and tongue  You know, that's an actual sexual fetish in Japan.  Also wow, old Kurumi was a bitch. No headpats for her (but it's good to see Shido still doesn't trust the psycho).   Sting's lost its touch, Gungnir wasn't depressing at all.           we'll never be given her true identity     - An exchange of &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt; and &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; are sparking in the sky. Ellen blocked Mana's attack and kicked her belly. Mana manipulated her Territory and escaped behind. However, Mana's reaction was a little bit slower. She couldn't fully cancel Ellen's attack. Mana coughed at the pain on her stomach.  "Even though you declared me with big words, that was quite a timid attack. You think you could kill me with something like that?" "Hmp… kill, kill you said. You don't know other way to win, do you? Even though your Magic Power is the strongest, seems like your intelligent is still not enough." "What a cheap provoke. Do you think I would get taken in it?"  - Ellen said with a cool face. When Wizards are using Realizer, a slight disturbance can caused the sensitivity of Territory to drop. Ellen couldn't be provoked so easily.   "Ha… I didn't expected you to do so. Just an impression. I thought you were somewhat dull ever since I was at DEM." "Don't joke around. There's no way I'd have any faults." "No, I saw you tripped several times where there's nothing around. Also I saw you take two breaks when you carry the documents from second floor up to the fourth floor." "What!? How did you —" "Well since we're at it I'm going to say it. Wizards in the second group are not calling you 'Shikkou-buchou*' but rather 'Moyashikko-buchou*'" "……"  [*Note: Shikkou-buchou is a Department Manager, Moyashikko is used to call a weak kid who can easily get tired, etc., so Mana is adding 'Moya' in front of Shikkou to make fun of her.]                   That's why he is not trying to save her until the right time is here.    Retard    - Blood vein popped up on Ellen's forehead. Ellen quickly close to Mana and swing down her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt;. Mana evaded the attack and laugh at her.  "Whoa~? Didn't you said you can't be provoked?" "Shut up! What is that unpleasant nickname…!"  - Ellen shout in irritated voice. No doubt her subordinate will all get a harsh 'special training' when she is back to the office in England.  - The truth is Mana just thought up that nickname on her own just now. If Ellen use her head a little, she would have realized since the second group is full of Wizards from England, there is no way they would understand a Japanese wordplay. Looks like that is not something Ellen want someone to talk about.  "— Yes. …What? The 'Material A' is?"  - That moment, Ellen shook her brows and answer to the communicator. Ellen knitted her brows and clicked her tongue. She lowered her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt;,  "How lucky are you. — But remember, you won't have the next chance."  - Said that, Ellen then manipulated her Territory and flown away to somewhere. Mana decided not to follow her. After all, Mana's objective is to buy some time. There's also no guarantee anywhere that she will win if she followed her.  - More importantly, Mana right now has another reason. The name Shidou said on the ground earlier still keep swirling in her mind.   "…Who is Mio-san —"  - Mana mumbled under the darkness of the night.  ◇   About 7-8% left but I'm super sleepy. So let's finish it tonight. Sorry guys ;_;                            Retard.    Mana Best smug girl    Fuck this bitch.    No problem, goodnight, thanks again    Sure, no problem.    More threads for DAL!  Thanks anon      I can wait, We are lucky to have someone willing enough to do these summaries.    Respects to you and thanks.    Thanks and good job so far.    yay more retard bullying    Ellen is an old hag.    Thanks, sleep well!    Good night.    night don't let the retards bite   Why is everyone going skeleton for summaries when they have been around since yesterday now? http://www.emptyblue.it/post/2015/0<wbr>6/23/Date-A-Live-Light-Novel-Volume<wbr>-12-Review-Summary.aspx</wbr></wbr>    Motherfucker!    Ellen is a bitch for hurting best imouto.   Thanks and goodnight to you.        of &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt; and &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; are sparking in the sky  between in place of "of", also it should be "sparked against the sky"   though you declared me with big words  This one's hard, I think she means "Even though you made such a bold proclamation"   provoke  provocation    I saw you take two breaks when you carry the documents  "while carrying documents"    you won't have the next chance  won't have another chance, or won't be so lucky again   Mana's objective is to buy some time  was   no guarantee anywhere that   subtract anywhere  ご苦労様でした                          Probably because this summary is more detailed and we can discuss it with everyone.    That's really bare bones, not even the cliff notes version. This is much better for talk and speculah.    That's a summary by an origamifaggot anon who liked the twins date the best  It's fucking shit      That summary is too short    More info!    Are you blind anon? That looks more like spoilers than a summary.     I liked the twins best, completely nailed the appeal of having twin girlfriends in the first place.     It lacks detail. How can you discuss something if you have little to no information?    Kaguya was cute     Origami is still my favorite character  He thought the revenge blinded Origami was good. What the fuck?     Mana is pretty good at pissing people off.    Cause she's shit    Retard.    Best imouto    Kotori pls.        Ah right my bad, after reading through the thread I can now see the vast difference. I was just confused seeing so many posts on the front page for this series calling for summaries.        I want Kotori to go to bed already.    Mana is smart, trying to catch Ellen off-guard.    We always have detailed summaries for this novel and they used to be even more detailed.    No harm done   So I have all of what TL Anon has done today for Chapter 5 here: http://pastebin.com/ZYg63XLw will add the rest to it when he posts it later on tomorrow.  Does anyone group together what he did for the previous 4 chapters or do I have to go archive diving?     No problem but try reading the thread next time.    http://pastebin.com/dcRjk8Qz here.  I might go through and edit them for Englishness, but I have work.      Nope, nothing. We were waiting for the entire summary to be done first but the transaltor already said he is going to translate volume 12 so you can do a pastebin if you want.    I have everything but I'm not going to share that here.     Slow ass lazy shitcucks     Really? I thought it was the worst.     transaltor already said he is going to translate volume 12  Is this the same guy who translates the series on Baka-Tsuki?     Are you retarded? We are doing this to prevent a drama with the translator because he lost motivation when he sees there is a detailed summary.    Grow up. Seriously.    That's missing Chapter 4 isn't it?    Is there someone else?    I think so. Might have part of the start?    He is the only LN translator for this series.    There was a TL Anon doing this for SaeKano earlier today, so I dunno maybe there have been some charitable anons.     An update of that http://pastebin.com/Y4Ki6EMe     I mean for the DAL light novel, he's the one who translated volume 8-11 and chapter 10 of volume 7.    Just curious did we pass the part where Shidou shoots down the ship Material A was on and free's her? Sorry for the autism but I haven't notice this part yet.    We still have some pages left and the afterwords for next thread. Nice.    I think that spoiler was fake, actually a lot of spoilers turned out to be fake. I'm not sure though.    So, Shidou has been screaming all this time. Hopefully he will do something before losing his powers.    Going by the other set of spoilers, I think No. 2 used some kind of mental manipulation to get close to the city, then escaped on her own.     Ellen is MOE.     No    Haven't been following this since the volume where Origama goes back in time, but I thought people liked Origami?    No. No2 is captured and we don't know her current situation.    [Spoiler]Is it still confirmed Material A escaped from DEM and might be going to Shidou?[/spoiler]    Yes but that guy thought old Origami was best girl.    Kurumi helped her escape though    What's the difference now then?     [Spoiler]Is it still confirmed Material A escaped from DEM and might be going to Shidou?[/spoiler]  Anon  use Ctrl + S      Shidou goes on several dates with one girl but other girsl show up randomly.   Tohka's date is really cute until the twins go full lewd in it.   Yoshino's one is heart attack inducing btw.   The slut Miku wants Shidou, but she takes Shiori on a date though. He almost gets raped.    The date with Ellen and Natsumi gets interrupted when a strange being shows in front of them - it's a girl he may or may not recognize. Shidou's been feeling weird for a while now and this encounter increases this.    Ratatorks keeping an eye on him notice this. One dude goes freak shitty villain and starts the system to kill Shidou. Phantom shits all over it, in the process breaking stuff there. It's revealed later that the system is a spirit that was captured by Ratatorks - be aware of the time line change from last volume, DEM and Ratatorks never separated.    That's all I have right now    Spoiler anon here, they are trying several things in order to make him fall in love. One method they came up with was making him a female. Not of his own volition, Natsumi and Miku transform him into her and the stuff happens.   People actually fell for this shit?                Kurumi attacked the transport plane. When catches up, the containment unit is empty. No.2 is on her way.    What?     Thanks and have a good night Summary Anon.     I know saw that, stupid auto correct and typing from cell phone.     &gt;The date with Ellen  If only     Old Origami was a shitty character whereas the new one is actually good, because she got what she deserved.     The slut Miku wants Shidou, but she takes Shiori on a date though. He almost gets raped.  Anyone who fell for that is more retarded than Tohka.     You're a phone, Ars.    such autism    I don't think anyone deserves having to kill their own parents.    The first half sounds something that could happen but the rest not so much.    She deserved to suffer for all the terrible decisions she made.    Some people do    I almost believed it until I read the part where Ellen and Natsumi are dating, that's dumb as fuck.    Almost got me but the whole thing about Miku and Natsumi turning Shidou into Shiori was retarded.    She is an old hag     anons are cruel.      DEM and Ratatorks never separated  This didn't make any sense.    I am baffled how anons can get cucked into endless harems like this, I went through 17 volumes of C3 and 12 volumes of Baka to Test all for some BS non-ending, never again.  I don't know how these people manage to lure so many people into this.     She wouldn't have ever learned her lesson if that didn't happen to her, it may be unfortunate but there was really no other way. Also she came out of that situation 100 timeso better.    It's not being cruel. Origami deserved it for being such an idiot, if you are going to attack innocent poeple just to fulfill your personal agenda without thinking in the collateral damage then you deserve to be punished.   slut for Woodmans wood     Maybe one of the spirits will buy the open position on the council after Woodman gets rid of the trigger-happy guy.  Realistically only  Miku  could do it since she's the only one that's filthy rich.        Why don't you try reading a harem where there is no main girl or the MC is actually fine with a harem ending?    So MC still accepts her even tho she tried to kill his sister over and over?    But Anon, Origami never tried to kill Mana.     So MC still accepts her even tho she tried to kill his sister over and over?  She was on good terms with Mana though. Fake imoutos don't matter.     Miku is worst girl    But she was Very Good, anon.     Implying those exist. Also how are you suppose to know? I havent seen any that isn't just bait luring.    Yes, she apologizes for making his life so complicated and trying to kill his family and loved ones. But he tells her that she will have to carry the burden for her own past actions.    She only tried to Kotori her in volume but the MC unsderstood Origami can't be saved so he went to the past to change her fate but he also noticed all this was Origami's fault and deserved to carry the burden for killing her own parents.   <br/>   I want to mind break and marry Kotori.    Revenge blinded Origami still had cute moments with Shido.    Kotori is also his sister.    That doesn't justify all the terrible shit she did.    It takes changing timelines to do so   Reine True End   Man, being Neo Origami must suck.  She was living a mostly ordinary life up until now but suddenly she finds out she has an alternate batshit insane self living inside her and instead of getting rid of her alternate self she tries to save her and her only reward is said alternate self now corrupting her mind and ruining her life whenever she gets near her love interest.      Kotori pls.   Well seems like DAL threads will be gone after tomorrow again for some time.  Thankfully new content will come out a lot sooner than last time.  We're looking at the movie, Encore 4 and then Volume 13 each 2 months or so after the other.  I'm glad these threads exist, I like them.         He already forgave her for trying to kill Kotori before the timeline change.    I'm still waiting for her route.     Mana pls stop.    Does anyone think Shido is open to the harem ending?   The entire story is her route.    I want Shidou to give the D eito  to best mom.   will miss posting Cutie Kaguya   2 months for the movie and another 3 months for volume 13.    I honestly don't think Reine is phantom. From the little we've seen of phantom she's nothing like her    On the other hand, she's too shy to ever approach him on her own and her crush expects and accepts her weird and obsessive behavior.  Plus you know, 120% love. That has to feel really good in the moment.      That should be obvious at this point and Mana research further confirms it.   Guys, what if  Reine and Phantom  are actually the same as  NeOrigami and Originami  and  Phantom  is  Reine's spirit self from a previous timeline  who wakes up once in a while to cause trouble.   He is. Read Mana's short story.    As it should be, as you can tell from series that have general's every day it just turn it to shit. Creating threads for the sake of creating threads should be a bannable offence.     Of course but Tohka is a greedy retard who still suffers when shidou is with another girl.   Main Harem girls  Tohko   Yoshino   Pending sealing to be added to main Harem  Kurumi   Main Sisterzone (Didn't die!)  Kotori   Dead Sisterzone (Is she dead? New volume says not)  Mana   Tohko rival and almost if not pretty much already main Harem now  Origami   Second Harem Layer  Twins   Third Harem Layer  Miku   True Route never  Reine   Moe tier  Phantom   Ellen   (confirmed)   Wants to fuck Yoshino  Natsumi   Thinks she's part of the main harem but she's not even part of the fourth layer  Previous Timeline Origami    As it is right now, literally who?  Mio   Needs more screentime/relevance  Frax sex hair Kaoru   Frax Kurumi look alike   Ai   Gross tier  Gross-chan   Not Origami  Mai   Deserves love too plus she's not old in the past  Tama-chan   Shidou might remember her  or not   Rinne   Rio   Not!Android-chan  Arusu                                                             Maybe she's half, sort of like Yamai.    Which short story is this? There are multiple on B-T, none of them named Mana.    We could have threads from time to time, but you faggots refuse to post.    I agree but DAL threads used to be mostly about discussion then S2 killed them.    fucking retards man    This list is absolutely correct and Anon is a scholar and a gentleman. I stand to applaud.    Are you sure? It's implied heavily that Reine knows a lot more than she lets on. It doesn't help that she reacts whenever Shidou mentions his past or her own motherly traits.    I think he means Mana research. It's not in BT but you can check the pastebin for a summary.    An anon made a summery of the short story. You should be able to find it in the Date a Stuff pastebin.    Phantom really cares about Shidou, maybe too much and Reine's reaction to his past and Mana's condition are interesting.    http://pastebin.com/dq8gnMyd   hey look, there's a teddy bear right next to sadShido.   Also, Reine is nowhere to be seen during this entire battle.         Reminder that during the death beam laser thing Reine was no were to be found  suspicious      Says a namefag who likes an autistic chuuni     There's also the part where she's uncharacteristically furious at what DEM have done to Mana's body.    Because we don't even what is the crew doing.     There could be some connection but I don't think she's phantom. Unless she's got some severe case of split personalities. Plus what phantom says doesn't really sound like she cares all that much about Shidou, but needs him for something else. I dunno, it just doesn't sound right to me     Final arc anon.    still better then a badly written MG retard     Unless she's got some severe case of split personalities  To be fair split personalities are handed out like candy in DaL.      Unless she's got some severe case of split personalities  It's funny because that's recurrent thing in this series.  Yoshino and Yoshinon   ribbonless Kotori and black Kotori   Kaguya and Yuzuru(literally half and half of the same spirit)   old Origami and new Origami           Plus what phantom says doesn't really sound like she cares all that much about Shidou, but needs him for something else   —It's been a while.    In my head, a voice that I've heard somewhere before echoed.    —Finally, finally we meet again, ×××.    A voice filled with nostalgia, with warmth.    —I'm glad, but, just a little longer. Wait just a little longer.    Who are you, I asked, but there was no answer.    —I won't leave you again. I definitely won't make a mistake again. &gt;That's why...    There, the mysterious voice was cut off.               800+ lines  Is it even a summary at that point?      also Kurumi and her past self's    Reread what she says to Shidou in the first volume. Phantom cares a lot for Shidou.    Keep telling yourself that   I don't think Phantom is Mio either, I think Mio is the "material A"       Split personalities is not an unusual theme in this series.    Alright thanks. Do we know where this takes place chronologically?    Yes, older summaries are even more detailed but this volume is longer than vol 11.      This shit is Shkannontrice all over again.      It takes place after Origami's sealing in the new timeline.    That's not really split personalities, she just changed and a better example would be rooftop Kurumi and original Kurumi.     Well all I'm saying is this phantom run in was hardly intimate. It made phantom seem more sinister than any of the previous appearances. Why is phantom turning girls into spirits? What could it possibly have to do with anything? There's just too much that doesn't seem right   I agree. I would be surprised if Mio wasn't this new spirit. Since it sounds that Mana and Mio were taken by DEM. this really adds up       This short side story is longer than V11?     Hang on, what if that's not Phantom? If Reine's Spirit 1, that leaves Phantom as 6.   Between volume 9 and 10. Natsumi's joined the group but Origami hasn't kidnapped Shido yet.        Not really. The splits are given to us straightforward when plot needs it to be.  For now there is no proof Reine IS Phantom and everything's speculah. If a real clue was given in one volume, rest assure that the volume will end with the reveal, or that the next volume will answer it.      You should change Rio to daughteru tier.    Oh wait, my bad. I thought you were talking about the novels.    Really? I thought it was the same. Phantom was focused completely on saving Shidou. She even talked to him in a gentle voice while giving the girls another chance in saving him.     Wait, people think Phantom and Mio are the same person?     But what would DEM want with them? In particular.. Mana? Did they want to create a spirit and did they succeed with #2?     &gt;Not!Android-chan   &gt;Arusu   Hahahahahahaha  Not funny.          I agree. I would be surprised if Mio wasn't this new spirit. Since it sounds that Mana and Mio were taken by DEM. this really adds up  It also slots in with what Phantom told Kurumi. Spirit no. 2 is the only one that knows about the first spirit.  So Material A = Spirit no. 2 = Mio = Shidou and Mana's childhood friend  Phantom = the first spirit = Shidou and Mana's mother (?) or some other close relation  Since Shidou and Mana are amnesiac Mio is the only one left who knows anything about Phantom/the first spirit.            Whether the reason is good or bad Phantom is doing all this for Shidou but I don't think she has bad intentions.    that's what i was going for    Isaac mentions he wanted to control a Spirit. Plus they researched her to create the wiring suits used with the Realizer.  Mana was probably taken hostage, then mindwiped and put to work. Isaac seems a big fan of irony, so having Mana fight her mother's organization would appeal to him.     What is her Apeal?  sawashiro   hips  and firm ass and toned tummy       Apeal   I thought this was a typo for a second. Well done, OP.    she only has one arm?   Literally everything.   I think she is the best. She is my Kanbafu.  She has good taste in girls.  Tfw you will never check girls out with Monkey     tfw no lesbian best friend to hang out with and hit on girls together   Her furry arm.     short hair monkey best   She is basically a guy in a female body Whats not to like    I like all monkey hair lengths I cant be the only one that thinks she is cute all the time     <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435102926569.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143510292656<wbr>9.webm</wbr></a>    she has no dick    of course shes cute all the time  but short hair is best although pony tail is pretty damn close      I don't get it, are they the same voice actress?   How come her part was the most boring in Bake?   Athletic Lesbian (possibly bisexual) Short hair Quirky Toned muscles        whose snails? or monkeys? Snails arc was used to characterized Hitagi a bit more and just introduce snail Monkey's arc introduced monkey and characterized her a bit, she was a bit more fleshed out in snake's arc because their relationship changed     Sawashiro the god  2 and 6 the best.     Monkey's, I thought everyone arc was pretty superior compared to her.    It was definitely different than other arcs which primarily focused on another girl, but monkey's mainly focused on her.  It does have some small nuances that others didnt have     Theres people that actually believe Monkey &gt; Cat    That she isn't Crab.     ponytail monkey      cat  boring conversations boring personality boring interests  no thanks bro         Her voluptuous Buttocks.     Le cat is boring maymay     Cat is only good for FAT TATS otherwise shes worst girl    If you're in the closet, you won't feel outted saying you like "her".   4 and 6     calling something you dont agree with a meme  nice deflection     She kinda is.    What Thread is this from?    https://archive.moe/v/thread/299966<wbr>293</wbr>    best taste    not reading the file name     Not yelling "MR GORBACHEV TEAR DOWN THIS BL!" when BDs leaked     2 and 5 do weird things to my dick.    sawashiro   fujoshi   lesbian   tomboy   top butt  She's a 9.9/10 only because the only 10/10 is my waifu.        dont worry anon thats completely normal    3 is objectively my favorite even though people say it's shit. I just love that episode cause it covers her and Karen's relationship. And the short twintails make her look playful.     only because the only 10/10 is my waifu  I like that, you're a cool guy     1 &gt; 2 = 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 4 &gt; 5   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1271294631  1 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 = 4 = 6 &gt; 2     whats her Apeal?   her Apeal?   Apeal?   Ape        You created this thread to use that pun. No other reason.   yep    You're fucking killing me here.  Even tho Snail is RRRG's best friend.        Anon. I'll get mad.      3 and 4 are best     Get your trap shit out of here.     3 or gtfo     She is always cute but twintails are a worst.   Is that guy who said he would draw monkey around?    short twintail   not literally the worst      Monkey had the second best arc in bake, behind only cat arc. It had everything, banter, action, cute girls and soul searching inner struggles.    Why would a lesbian like BL?    Miyuki Sawashiro    Fit   Dat Ass   Dat Midriff   Spats   Tomboy   Bro          I want to be Kanbaru's submissive little bitch    implying Kankan would be a dom  She would be a switch and expect as much from you.     similar tropes; top and bottom sort of relatable     She`s Bi. She admitted that if the guy was Araragi or like him, she would`n`t mind going straight      It's actually stereotypical lesbian behavior. You can Google lesbians watch gay male porn and see a ton of articles discussing this phenomenon. It mainly seems like something that happens because girl on girl eroticism tends to have male readers / viewers in mind, so it doesn't seem authentic to them or something.      Kankan   Stop      It's too late, Cranberry has too many nicknames.     Nah, all Gaens are dom. Pic related is what a real switch looks like.     She's a girl. That's literally it.    She makes you believe lesbians are just slutty women and you can make them straight again with the power of the all mighty D?    Snake can't dom worth shit, she's all talk.    Snake was so determined to lose her virginity that day    And then her mom interrupted, oh well.   Hey monkeyfags, any feedback on this drawing of monkey I did?  particularly the face     I kinda like the butt.    That is the focus anon, monkey's posterior    There is none   Will the best comedy of 2014 get a season 2?  It was fun but it wasn't the best. I hope it gets s2 though    What would you say was the best comedy in 2014 then? Barakamon?     Why not both?    Aldnoah Zero.   Kaoru is best and you can't do nothing about it  Well she does have the sex hair.      Frank Zappa on the front page!     definitely best      tfw she wiggles her ass on your lap to distract you and wins a round, then claims a kiss as her prize   This is so damn comfy, I wish I had a Kaoru to play vidya with.        tfw I have a  3d kaoru and I can't afford living with her yet, not at least until I get some stability onm y job or she finds a stable one  damn, she is also a cafe waitress         Amagami provided us with the comfiest moments ever. Pic related.    What's happening here? I don't get it.   I will do nothing about it.   They know he's reading porno and they're watching him do it.    Who'd read porno in public though?   Im pretty sure we all agreed that Nanasaki is best   Why is Tsukasa so best?    Some one post that gif, you know the one    The fuck you said about Kaoru?   The black haired girls were the best   Damn straight.    They were all black haired expect for one    Guess what that means      I can't wait to play the VN after I learn moon    Why does she look like a middle aged crazy lady?     The VN is pretty easy Kanji wise. There`s not much complicated Kanji, most are common use kanji.   About N3 level you can play with minimal dictionary help.       The VN is getting translated.     You can play right now if you know Japanese though. I know i did. Also, this translation is almost 4 years old now, on this time frame, most people would probably be at least N2 in Japanese.     Any more info on that?   Still waiting for sensei arc.  Also while Karou is the overall best Morishimias playfullness is the most fun one in the long run, while AIAi had the best final christmas scene.    Underrated        Amagami - 1st day patch Released for PS2/PSP, "1410/2308 original edition scenario scripts translated (61.1%)"   About most of the common route is translated. Also   4 years   By this time frame, if you were studying, you would be VERY proficient in Japanese (not fluent)             https://nishishitranslations.wordpr<wbr>ess.com/</wbr>    Same VA as biribiri obviously best.     About most of the common route is translated  But there's no common route      people actually play visual novels   morons actually translate visual novels for free  What a surprise.      Kill yourself    Are there people who spend time learning Japanese just to play VNs? I tried it, man, I really did, but I couldn't learn much even when I kept my motivation trying to learn for several months at a time.    Since it's an amagami thread, anyone doing the challenge this year? I just failed mine prematurely and will probably keep the bench warm this year.    scrub    I've been holed up in my house for two years now. Has anyone beaten my record?   why do i live    Precure Thread     Huh. Maybe I got Osaka and Kansai confused.   F5 indeed.           Stop making me want to watch Doki    Osaka is the largest city in the Kansai region. </blockquote>]
