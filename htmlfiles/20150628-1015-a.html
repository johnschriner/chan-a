I really don't trust their new stepfather, and maybe that's what drudging all this pain up<br>I don't like the way he looks at them, i don't like the way he has them call him daddy.</br></br>    Can brothers NTR their brothers?  <br>It won't be a problem if you impregnate your sisters before he does.</br>  <br>I'll let you know as soon as my exhentai account is activated</br>  <br>there's one on sad panda i'm sure but only if you dont intend in yaoi sense</br>  <br>THIS IS REAL LIFE, ANON. THEY'RE 7 AND 13, I'M NOT GOING TO IMPREGNATE MY LITTLE SISTERS</br>  <br>Sounds to me like he is trying to get them to accept him as a father.</br>  <br>Mangagamer has localised a VN that does exactly this.<br>Secret Sorrow of the Siblings<br><br>That feel when I actually bought this to support more incest localisations.<br>I only buy incest stuff from them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you look at it through my eyes, it doesn't fucking look like that. I seem him being overly fond of them, holding them in his lap, washing the youngest in the bath, and it made me sick. I'm glad I moved out, but I can't help but feel regret. What if i did leave them with a rapist?</br>  <br>My heart. Niishishi a best imouto</br>  <br> I'M NOT GOING TO IMPREGNATE MY LITTLE SISTERS <br>Well if you're not man enough, I can do it for you.</br></br>  <br><br>You're a failure as a human being because you couldn't protect your own sisters.<br><br>The 13 year old would soon become 14-15 and right at the good age for sex even.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can always keep an eye on them and get authorities involved if younhave enough evidence. I'm not really sure what else you can do. In my case, I was sexually abused by my cousin for about two months, before I got back home and told my parents because I felt what happened was off.</br>  <br>I kinda wish this manga was like this. It's... Really bad.</br>  <br>cognitive dissonance: the post.</br>  <br> told my parents <br>What a faggot. You should have let your cousin have more sex with you.</br></br>  <br>IRL? All the time, not sure about in my chinese cartoons.</br>  <br>I would be more of a faggot because my cousin is a guy.</br>  <br>Sauce</br>  <br> filename </br>    <br>Read the goddamn file name.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>The supreme court declared that type of relationship just.</br>  <br>Because they're planning to remove ALL free manga and doujin. Incest was just the beginning because Jacob deemed it "controversial"</br>    <br>But not pedophillic rape, not 13 years ago, and not in South America.</br>  <br>Miya is way too cute</br>  <br>Only people without sisters want to have sex with their little sister.</br>  <br>So the 2 hours I spent playing Hentaiverse was for naught?</br>  <br>She is. There was never enough of her</br>  <br>That's Ai, man.</br>  <br>Only people without mothers want to have sex with their mother.</br>  <br>Only people without people want to have sex with people</br>    <br>You seem to forget that mothers are mandatory for the existence of a human while sisters aren't.</br>  <br>sisters are mandatory for my heart.</br>  <br>And yet, why are you avoiding his point?</br>  <br>Because my imouto is a bitch.</br>  <br>my mother is a bitch</br>  <br>No it's because you are a bitch.</br>  <br>No, just some anon with a very disagreeable imouto who finds itnhard to believe that anyone would want to fuck their imouto.</br>  <br>Because you're a bitch.</br>  <br>Having a bitch as a little sister somehow makes me a bitch? Explain this to me, anon.</br>  <br>You've demonstrated in this thread that you're a massive bitch.<br><br>The problem isn't your sister, the problem is you.</br></br></br>    <br>Looks like a potato but I'm a sucker for the hospital bound damaged goods. Going in</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br> can't believe people want to fuck their imouto due to own imouto <br> calls imouto a bitch <br> am somehow now a bitch </br></br></br>  <br> you wouldnt be a dragon fucking a car </br>  <br>Not even used goods, damaged goods. My sides.</br>  <br>Okay, so you're a bitch who can't admit he's a bitch.</br>  <br>And you're an anon who can't justify why I am a bitch. Spoonfeed it to me because I am not fucking getting it.</br>  <br> You can't report for advertising anymore. </br>  <br>You were WHAT?!</br>  <br>My imouto is sweet, fun to be with, and sexy. I'm insanely attracted to her. What does your sister have to do with that?</br>  <br> yesterday i dreamed of NTRing my best friends <br>Kill me.</br></br>  <br>Fair point. It is just hard to believe when your own imouto is so disagreeable as to go out of her way to make sure you get fucked over.</br>  <br>you're already on road to hell , call help anon</br>  <br>Not that other Anon, but I know the real reason: You're just that much of a bitch.</br>  <br>That happens all the time, the trick is to get really, really fucking mad at 3D so you kill your friend's/brother's lover before you get in on in dreams. I'm not even being edgy here, it actually works</br>  <br>Fine. I'm a bitch. Now tell me what I am doing wrong and how to stop being a bit</br>  <br>*bitch. <br>Excuse me.</br></br>  <br>go to your sister and hug her. that's the first step</br>  <br>Because he is super self important.</br>  <br>Have tried making amends with my sister before. Hasn't worked.</br>    <br>Goddamnit I clicked it.</br>  <br>try harder. find a common ground, try a compromise. even if it's just sibling love you have to try something. you're gonna regret hating your imouto.</br>  <br>Hug her. If she doesn't push you away, give her a kiss (cheek or forehead), turn 360 degrees and leave.</br>  <br>Dammit my sides.</br>  <br>git gud</br>  <br> i'm god tier <br>Yep, still funny.</br></br>  Before we go any further, I think I have to mention that my sister is 16. I don't use the word bitch lightly, I would never call a 10 year old a bitch.<br><br><br>Hard to find compromise when she believes she is entitled to mybpersonal belongings and uses them as she likes whenever she likes as long she likes. I think that was the beginning point, where the rift between us started.</br></br></br>  <br>Try to lure her with something. Something you have and she wants but cant have it without your consent. Make a contract / rule of something similar with her. The first step is always the hardest.</br>   wanting to have sex with your sisters   <br>epic gif xD</br>  <br> imouto is a cheeky cunt that won't leave your room <br> most probably doesn't considers you a man and dresses casually while flopping on your bed <br> you still haven't tapped that <br>I don't care if your only option was rape you are still a pussy<br><br>If you ever come to Texas I'll fuck your shit up, crossboarding wanker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why you're a bad brother. When my sister was 15, she was emo, she hated our family, and she hung out with terrible people. You know why? Because puberty is a fucking bitch.<br><br>But as she got older, she mellowed out again. She stopped hating us, she wore regular clothes again, she got better friends. Now we get along great, and we share comic books and play video games together.<br><br>But out relationship is only good now because I didn't fucking start hating her for getting hormonal at the same time that literally every female gets hormonal</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh OH OH OH<br>THIS IS INTERESTING<br>I'd very much like that, you fuck. Give me your address</br></br></br>  <br>No one feels proud, you stupid faggot. Notice how the only people talking about how the entryway is difficult or convoluted are the people who don't use it. You're like the kid who got held back in third grade complaining that the others are full of themselves for passing.</br>  <br>I don't thing you understand. She takes it despite what I say. If I lock it up so she doesn't access, she'll either get my parents to make me unlock it, or wait until she's in a situation where the use is necessary and I can't bring myself to deny her use.</br>  <br> mfw 400 posts later </br>  <br><br> /v/ /vg/ /vr/ /int/ /tg/ <br>Looks like we're dealing with a true /v/tard here.</br></br></br>  <br> epic <br> xD <br>Even if its ironic, shitposting is still against the rules.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you should not use it because it wants you to log in. Forced non-IRC registration for non-forums is something that must be wiped out.</br>  <br>And how old are you?<br>Give it a few years, she'll grow out of it, and hopefully so will you.</br></br>  <br>Posting shitty 3pd gifs is also against the rules you know? Now fuck off to whatever containment board you came from</br>  <br>Then get back on track now, you say? Goddamn, that's easier said than done. It's hard to not want to avoid all contact with her. I'd rather just have her mellow out on her own, with interfering as little as possible as I've been trying to do.</br>  <br>It's one of those code geass idiots from /v/.</br>  <br>18, she is 16. I was hoping to not have to deal with her once I start college in the fall.</br>  <br> 3pd </br>  <br> Posting shitty 3pd gifs is also against the rules <br><br>No, it's not.</br></br></br>  <br>She lacks a fatherly figure. Only The Dick can fill that role.</br>  <br>That's a great way to ensure that she'll always dislike you. She'll later realize how terrible she was being, but she'll also remember how you treated her, and feel no need to change her behaviour towards you because you reciprocated. <br><br>If you love them while they act out, they'll remember you as someone that will actually always support them.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's right, pussy, run away like the little bitch you are.</br>  <br>shhhh</br>  <br>Objectively speaking, removing any bias against her, she is 7/10 in looks. But I guess you may be right. My father spends all his time in the basement on his computer, trying to determine which get rich quick scheme will work.</br>   Does anyone here have touchy-feely neesans? And when I say neesans, I mean like two or more.<br><br>I'd trade them both for an imouto.</br></br>   <br>I didn't want to believe it at first but it turns out to be true. The trash comes from /v/, the gateway board that invites other trash from gamefaqs and reddit.</br>  <br>I can see it now:<br> your father blows all his money on a jew scheme <br> they're going to lose the house <br> out of the corner of his eye, he sees your sister <br> he grabs her and tells her the situation and he explains the only way to make it back is for her to sell her body <br> she then goes around town and gets ridden by everyone <br> all the while she keeps up appearances, especially to her oni-chan, that nothing is wrong </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was a nice read<br> That title drop </br></br>  <br><br>don't be so melodramatic<br>you are still young, she is even younger<br>give it a few years and things will stabilize<br>you might even grow to miss your bitchy little sister<br>what do I know, I don't even bother with capitalization<br>enjoy yourself anon, make friends before it's too late</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is anyone else dealing with this when it comes to their imoutos?:<br> go into sister's room to spend some time with her <br> she snaps at me and tells me to get out <br> I pass by her room and look at her a few seconds at a time, and she tells me to go <br><br>I just want to love her, but she's making it so hard.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. <br>Now fuck off</br></br>  <br>I have friends, anon. They are what I look forward to in life, and hanging out with them is where I feel I am the most happy.</br>  These threads make me sad sometimes.<br>They always remind me I'll never be able to spend my life with a sister who loves me, never be able to run away and make a life with her.</br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>I don't know why you people still try and say this shit when you know that no one will ever enforce your interpretation of the rules.

Let's hope it won't get dropped again after a few chapters.</br>  <br>Same here. Gotta go reread and catch myself back up, forgot everything about this one.</br>  <br>appearently the manga only has 3 chapters left.</br>  <br>well damn. Thought it could go longer. At the very least they should be able to translate it all without dropping it then.</br>  Have you had your breakfast, /a/?  <br>I sure did.</br>  Why do I always end up falling for side characters and literally-whos?  How do I make Erina go boing?<br>Alternatively, how do I win Alice?</br>  <br>Seriously, how can Hisako goes from zero to perfection?

They are in fucking everything. Eggs, hashbrowns/toast, sausage, good luck getting anything else. All fast food restaurant breakfasts are a remix of a godamn egg mcmuffin. I wanted to die before eating another egg in my life.<br><br>But then this episode happened. And I want to try each and every one. except soumas </br></br></br></br>  <br>I really know that feel.</br>  White meat or dark meat?  <br>Both</br>  <br>Both needs to be brutally fucked.</br>  <br> except soumas <br> You're the reason he almost failed. </br></br>  <br>Both are cutie pies, but Nikumi hits all the right marks for me.</br>  <br/>  <br>I want them to kiss</br>  <br>I bet most of what you had weren't real eggs but runny egg mixes from cartons.</br>  <br>thiiiiiiiiis</br>  <br>Had Eggs Benedict before and it was the best thing I ate in a buffet line for sure.</br>  <br>We need to go lewder</br>  what's wrong with his omelets?<br><br>why don't people eat them?</br></br>  <br>What happens to souffles?</br>    <br>oh my god</br>  <br> watching FFFuckup subs <br>Anon I'm disappointed</br></br>  <br> Hisako shine at curry dish round. <br><br>Those who failed to notice that are just plebs.</br></br></br>  <br> how do I win Alice? <br><br>You have to be a poorfag like Ryou or Akira.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, the &gt; is unintentional.</br>  So I always wait for saturdays to watch shokugeki because I'm a pleb<br><br>Did anyone make webm's of Marui's antics?</br></br>  <br>His souffles look like shit.</br>  <br>No shit.</br>  <br>No shit.</br>  <br>No shit</br>  How far will the anime run up to?  <br>Probably up to the introduction of curry or the Asura vs Souma breakfast showdown with 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to side chapters and ln content</br>  <br>Wow, when he said that he wanted to serve souffles, I thought he already considered the fact that souffles will deflate in like...10 seconds after serving and I was wondering what kind of trick he had planned in keeping them inflated.<br><br>But it turns out, he didn't think of any of that shit and that's why he's failing.<br><br>That's probably the most amateur-ish mistake ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was going until chapter 46, but with the pacing now I really don't know.</br>  <br>This is surprisingly common in this series. Souma fails here because he doesn't know how a buffet works, some chapters later  Alice will fail because she doesn't understand the point of a bento .<br><br>I thought the school was supposed to teach you those obvious things.</br></br></br>  <br>Alice is a Ruskie. Soma is a transfer student.</br>  Is Hayama the luckiest guy? <br><br> Constantly has christmas cakes falling over themselves to get to him <br> Devotes himself to a qt cake that looks young as hell <br> Makes damn good curry </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the obvious things are something they teach in middle school.<br><br> Alice has no excuse tho </br></br></br>  <br>Does he really fail tho? Or is there some sort of asspull magic that let's him convert this rotten souffle shit into something tasty?</br>  <br>But she still went through the middle school, didn't she? That's 3 years in a japanese cooking school, how the fuck does she not learn what a bento is supposed to be?</br>  <br>Alice is Scandi.</br>  <br>Nope, those souffles are dead.</br>  <br>Don't forget:<br><br> best girl makes her way to work with him. </br></br></br>  <br>He just makes something else and gets all girls mad wet with his sweet skills</br>  <br> He drop the souffle and starts doing something else </br>  <br>No Solar Gauntlet shenanigans then? <br><br><br><br>Aha! Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina is the luckiest<br><br><br> born with god's tongue <br> filthy rich <br> talented at cooking <br> doesn't have to do much work to rise into one of the most influential cooks <br> free access to Souma's cock because she is the main heroine </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice has a great excuse<br><br>  She grew up in Europe and people don't serve bentos in europe so she just approached it as a japanese dish in a box  </br></br></br>   reading Fairy Tail with food   <br>Megumi has much of chance as her getting Souma's cock, fyi. And she's the other heroine, too, lest we forget.</br>  <br>She knows what a bento is. She doesn't know the nori bento Souma makes because it's cheap food for plebs and she's a rich girl who was spoonfed sugar up her ass all her life. <br>She fails because of what she prepared as her bento.</br></br>  <br>Megoomy is anything but Souma's potential lover.</br>  <br>It's a fucking lunchbox / picnic basket. Surely yuros would have a similar concept.</br>  <br>Don't forget who she has as an aide</br>  <br> using horrible subs when there are other options <br><br>Nice shit eating.</br></br></br>  <br> reading One Piece with food <br><br><br>Fixed!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Me in charge of not fucking up cropping  <br><br>Good job, me</br></br></br>  English chapter when?  <br>No one in modern western areas uses a lunchbox or thinks of bento as a picnic box.</br>  <br>RMT probably tomorrow.</br>  <br>The idea might be hard for you to conceptualize but there is a huge difference between a box full of food and drinks designed to be laid out on a cloth and individual boxes with meals inside each of them where the box acts as plate/bowls</br>  Man I'm hyped for next episode. Such a great moment coming.<br><br>Also necessary threadly reminder about best girl.</br></br>  <br> christfag <br> best girl <br><br><br>Awesome body figure, but nah. She's just a German version of Hinako in terms of personality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger, it would be 2 PM when you wrote this.</br></br>  <br> shit eating <br>It takes a faggot who watches FFFuckup CR edited subs shitsubs to know what shit eating is.</br></br>  <br> implying its 2pm everywhere <br> implying people always wake up when the sun rises <br> implying people don't consume late breakfast </br></br></br>  <br>pancakes<br>waffles<br>french toast<br>fruit bowls<br>cereal<br><br>Come on, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the chink better</br>  <br>Even an edit is better than the full Crunchy package.</br>  <br>But she's French.<br><br>Pancake, waffles and french toast are all made using eggs though, no?</br></br></br>  Literally just had some homemade egg's benedict.  <br>Besides french toast, people don't look at food and think of their ingredients.<br>Or are you saying you think as well of the eggs used on the cakes you eat?</br></br>  <br> implications </br>  <br> Even an edit is better <br>FFFuckup doesn't even know how to properly edit or translate.</br></br>  <br>I was considering putting "other than ihop", but thought souma fans might be less autistic than the rest of /a/.</br>  <br>It's swanky hotel food, anon.<br><br>I've had fruit bowls and pancakes and cereal and whatnot in swanky hotel breakfasts.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but the anon was talking about how there's little breakfast without using eggs, so I was thinking of the of the ingredients for that. <br><br>On that note, German breakfast is usually an assortment of bread/buns with cured meats, cheese, jams and such, although you would normally also have some boiled eggs on the side.</br></br></br>  Do we ever learn more about her? She seems to be best girl.  <br>She's into bestiality.</br>  <br>You see her 'cook' (the finished dish rather) during Autumn election, but aside from that not very much. Smoke and even Marui got a bit more background during Autumn election and Stagiare recently.</br>  <br> cheese and meat for breakfast every day <br><br>How can I live in this pleb north american nation</br></br></br>  <br>Souma actually has some severe gaps in his knowledge. Also he gets a lot more help from the people around him than people realize.</br>  <br>I find it hard to have a normal german breakfast as a single man in a small apartment.<br>I can at max have like salami and putenburst, frishkäse, something like gouda, and the bread is the standard steinofenbrot. Even with so little it feels like the kitchen gets overrun for making so little.<br><br>So I just make american breakfast, eggs, bacon, some side, and done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, we only do this on Sundays and only if the whole family is there. During the week I just have bread with cheese and cucumber/tomato or ham because I don't have the time in the morning before leaving for university. Let alone, the food will just spoil if you're single.</br>  <br>Also I forgot to add, while I was 'interning' (Bundesfreiwilligendienst) in a big clinic, we had the same "hotel-style" German breakfast every morning + taking leftovers for dinner. Food heaven for 6 months, though the work was shite.</br>  <br>Let's be real for a minute.<br>Do someone have the recipe of this?</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p1m<wbr>GDiEbni4</wbr>  [ ]</br>    Is the food in this anime really that easy to cook? It's starting to make me feel guilty about regularly having shit like pop tarts, chef boyardee, and frozen buffalo chicken strips. I'd be a lot less guilty if they're making it look a lot easier than it really is, though.  <br>If you could cook you could have it too. It's your fault, not the country's.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, only problem is that I started lifting  thanks /fit/  and the normal german breakfast doesn't meet macros anyway, so I kinda dropped it completely besides the rare off days.<br>But damn, that's a sweet perk in a shitty job. In my praktikum we just had shitty pot coffee and hard, dry, sweet bread.</br></br></br>  <br>Some of it, yeah.<br><br>It's not hard to chop some onions and wrap them around a steak, for example.<br><br>Megumi's riceballs? Hella easy.<br><br>Dishes with special sauces might be harder but Souma's shit is mostly designed to be cheap, easy-to-make diner food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooking nice food can be fast and easy. <br>You can start with simple but tasty dishes made in single pots and medium heat.<br>Or if you have slow cooking pots those are nice too, kinda the same.<br><br>I usually just cook quickly with a pot, throw things in it, season them, let them cook and that's it.<br>From chicken and bell peppers, to soups, chilli, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   wanting to re-read some specific part. <br> end up reading all the way. <br><br>Why is so addicting?</br></br></br>  <br>To add to this, cooking is also really fun, especially if done for more people than just yourself. It CAN also be cheaper and healthier, since you know what goes in it compared to pre-cooked stuff.</br>  <br> no experience in cooking before <br> get encouraged by one of these threads to make some of souma's food <br> try out the transforming furikake gohan <br> shit took me over 5 hours and several retries to get it right <br> underwhelming as fuck, would rather have a nice comfy cup of instant ramen <br><br>don't listen to these assclowns, they only say it's "easy" and "fast" and "cheap" because they underestimate how much harder it is to start off from no skill or experience to speak of. as for "tasty", you'd be better off learning something that's regional to you instead of SnS's twists on japanese things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This always happens to me, I don't even know how many times I've read this manga.</br>  <br>It's just easy on the eyes. Panel arrangement, based Tosh art and the pacing isn't even that bad, election just sucked while it was coming out.</br>  <br> raw cheese <br> prepared meat <br> buns <br><br> cook </br></br></br></br></br>  I have a good feeling about Valentine's Day.  <br> literally two guys kissing <br>How is this allowed again?</br></br>  <br>Keep in mind that in line with the other pics, these two are foodgasming.</br>  <br>Are you living under a rock? America just made gay marriage legal everywhere, it's now cool to be a faggot. That day will go down in history like when the slaves got freed or when women could vote.</br>  <br>Valentins's arc can't come soon enough.</br>  <br> transforming furikake gohan <br> easy <br>Come on, that shit was really obviously difficult. You had to make your own gelatin from scratch, how the fuck did you expect to be able to learn/make that in one sitting without experience?</br></br></br>  <br>doing this tomorrow. but whats the seasoning he puts in the water?</br>  <br>I want to see the girls making chocolate.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with fooling around and sharing the sensation of a delicious dish with your bro. What a couple of jokers.</br>  D-do you think we can get elites cameos and not shadows when they animate this?  <br> Meat making bacon chocolate </br>  No but I made a pretty good beef in black pepper sauce with EFR for tea  <br>You mean for the poached eggs? Pretty sure it's salt, because else the eggs would be pretty plain and then vinegar so the poaching works.</br>  <br>I'm almost sure they will do it in the anime just like they did in the opening ceremony with Alice, Ryou, Akira, Nao and Houjou.</br>  We all have taken for granted that Souma will be an elite 10 by the beginning of their next year, but I think we're all forgetting one important thing - Erina will have a massive problem with this.<br>Do you think she will finally take an active role in preventing his ascent? Or coach someone to beat him to the seat? How will she react?</br>  <br>The only problem I see with that scene is committing to voice actors.</br>  <br> In a bowl <br> With rice </br></br>  <br> I wanted Ryou's VA for Yugi ;_; </br>  <br>She's going to need to coach a lot of "someone"s to make Souma miss, because 5 spots will open up and there are only a small handful of worthy opponents close to Souma's level: Hayama, Alice, Ryou, and MAYBE hishoko or takumi, but having all of them do better than Souma will be almost impossible. Her only chance at keeping Souma out is to make him fail, not to make enough other cooks surpass him.</br>  <br>I think the only problem would be if he took a higher seat. By next year she'll be higher anyway. If he somehow got a higher seat, she'd probably just challenge him to take it, since Souma won't say no to a challenge.<br><br>Other than that, I have some doubts that she'd do anything. While she won't admit it, after the election she's recognized his ability. And I'm not just saying that because Tsukuda said her opinion has changed. I mean, she flat out told Megumi that she should have more confidence because she was good enough to make it into the top 8 and that deserves recognition. Souma made it to the finals.</br></br></br>  <br> Erina will have a massive problem with this <br>I don't think so, not anymore<br>She knows he's good even if she doesn't like to admit it, and he has the Hisako Seal of Approval</br></br></br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>Isshiki will be first seat, so he can pretty much tell Erina to fuck off if she tries some asspull to keep him out.<br><br>And I don't see Erina as the coaching-type. Just look at her latest interactions with Megumi: she only recognizes people she thinks are good. Help someone unworthy to make the E10 only to keep Souma away doesn't fit.</br></br></br>  <br>Isshiki first seat would be so based. Polar storm coming up big again and nips like their senpai-kouhai dynamics.</br>  <br> Erina's face when she realizes she's acknowledged someone that would have otherwise been scum in her eyes if not for Souma coaching her <br>I'm really looking forward to this, almost as much as Isshiki getting serious, Hishoko becoming relevant, Takumi being something other than comic relief, or Erina discovering about Jouichirou.</br></br>  <br>She hasn't warmed up to him that much. That encouragement for Megumi was quickly followed up by telling her to not mention Souma. Plus she regretted giving him so much detail about Chinese cuisine.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps she doesn't see him as a pleb anymore, but part of her character is to be Soumas rival. Contesting his appointment is a prime opportunity to start the rivalry in earnest.<br>Unless Tsukuda wants to skip the rivalry part.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> end of the 2nd year <br> Isshiki graduating as 1st seat <br> looks at Souma <br> "alright you faggot you better bring that first seat back home" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Good question. They introduce shitload of characters who become important on Autumn Election. Guess they skipp the homecoming chapters and just go right there.</br>  <br> Erina will have a massive problem with this <br>Are you a Megumifag in disguise?<br>Haven't you seen how she's slowly 'accepting' Souma, after what he had achieved in the Elections?<br>Hell, I don't even need to support my argument with Tsukuda's words, since its already there for all to see.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so, I think both of them being in the E10 and fighting for the higher seats makes for a much more interesting rivalry than Erina just being a bitch and trying to keep him out for no reason.<br><br>Remember, Erina will be at least 5th by next year, and Souma should be 8th at best.</br></br></br>  <br> Isshiki, Shinomiya and his dad <br> The pressure </br></br>  <br> She hasn't warmed up to him that much <br>I didn't say she warmed up to him. I said that while she won't admit it, she's recognized his skill. By recognizing someone who performed worse as being good, she's done that by default.<br><br>Let's be clear here, Erina won't say someone's cooking is good to make them feel better. If she says it, she means it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was Shinomiya PSD?<br>I don't remember it mentioned, but since he was a poorfag, I suppose so?</br></br>  <br>From flashbacks he seems to have an apartment, so I don't think so.</br>  <br>Not really. The closest thing we have are packed lunch but it's basically just a full course lunch packed in mobile vesels.</br>  <br> skipping the karaage arc which, aside from being excellent in its own right, is the basis for triggering eizan's fixation on souma that leads to mimasaka targeting takumi and souma on eizan's behalf <br>shit nigga you retarded?</br></br>  <br> They get Yugi's VA for Yugi </br>  <br> part of her character is to be Soumas rival <br>He'll be clueless at first about how the Elites system works (getting massive funds and facilities and privileges) and Isshiki will instruct Erina to show him the ropes<br><br> Okay Nakiri-kun, you're in charge of walking Souma-kun through what it means to be an Elite <br> W-W-WHY askdflblkasdj <br> Cool, thanks Nakiri <br> BETSUNI <br><br>By the way the captcha is showing me bugs now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That actually would make sense as european idea of packed lunch is exactly the reason why Alice failed.<br>It's just the same dish you'd serve on a plate only placed in mobile container.</br></br></br>  <br> By the way the captcha is showing me bugs now <br>did you miss the news post? I'm back to typing in mailbox numbers again, no more fucking picture association.</br></br>  <br>They will do till 46/47 porbably, for that time Houjou, Nao and Akira had all made an appearence.<br>That would mean why they didn't foreshadow Giganigga</br></br>  <br>They aren't skipping it anyway. We've known it will be in the anime for weeks thanks to them tweeting about the karaage.</br>  <br>Her problem is that she would have served the exact same dish if asked to do a sushi dish.<br>Her grandfather commented on this, she didn't serve a bento, just food in a bento box.</br></br>  <br>He won prize money from a lot of contests. He probably had enough money to rent an apartment.</br>  <br>Was he winning money since middle school?<br>Actually, is the PSD even open for middle school students?</br></br>  <br>Megumi.</br>  <br>Tootsuki isn't that heartless to poorfags. They should have a bursary scheme or something to help them tide over their school fees &amp; miscellaneous stuff.</br>  I fucking hate poached eggs they taste like rubber  <br>Yes, Jun was in middle school when she was accepted.</br>  <br>Yeah, as long as you can pass Fumio's test, you're in.</br>  <br>Eat another type of egg then.</br>  <br>Jun was 74th generation student while Joichiro was 69th. So, yes for middle schoolers.</br>  What do you think the promise is between Yugi &amp; Eishi?  <br>I'm pretty sure every PSD besides Souma were in the dorm during middle school. They have their own shit so well figured out there is no way they just moved in.</br>  <br>ching chong ping pong</br>  <br> &gt;no experience in cooking before <br> &gt;get encouraged by one of these threads to make some of souma's food <br> &gt;try out the transforming furikake gohan <br>That's one of the hardest things in the anime, like hell you'd be able to do it with zero experience. You want easy? Chaliapin Steak Don (~10 dollars<br>), Gotcha Roast Pork (~9 dollars), or his Kaki no Tane fish (as little as six dollars)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's setup to be one of Soumas main rivals, and despite her initial promise of dealing with him, she has yet to act on it personally. Even if she has changed enough to forgo her promise, there's still a rivalry to develop. There's going to be a confrontation eventually, and a seat contest is a good battleground.</br>  <br>Yugi asks Eishi if he's still keeping/honoring his promise.</br>  <br><br>Eating raw eggs = salmonela<br><br>Also. Why do people call blondy a love interest? She just is annoyed with him. <br><br>Tadakoro is the only chance. Not even precooking classmate has one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we've moved past that stage whereby she wants him expelled. Subconsciously, she's perhaps 'waiting' for him to catch up to her, so that they could initiate their inevitable Shokugeki. Its still too early, but Souma's making such huge strides, it may happen before their 3rd year.</br>  <br> animeonlyfag </br>  Can't wait to see Souma getting saved by the cute loli.  <br> not wanting Rindou-nee to pop by to say hi &amp; give him tips to take down the manlet </br>  <br>I think he's talking about other cute loli.</br>  The semi-finals that couldn't be  ;_;   <br>Yes, in the anime.</br>  Kanon is the best little girl in SnS  <br>I'd rather see Alice in there, instead of that Italian jobber.</br>  <br>Will she appear in the festival?</br>  Wait, so you're telling me Dojima was carrying around an egg in his suit just he could show it to the students? And even if the egg was already in that podium, why is he showing them an egg? <br><br>These are culinary academy students. They probably already know what an egg looks like. Godamnit, Dojima.</br></br>  <br>Momo &gt; every fucking loli in SnS</br>  <br> inb4 Alice is female Takumi. </br>  I had a summer vegetable terrine for breakfast since the gelatin was setting overnight.  <br> Questioning Dojima  <br><br>Anon stop</br></br></br>  <br>Silly anon, it was an egg that fell from a nest and miraculously didn't break, he put it in his pocket and only used it as a prop for convenience's sake. He's going to take that egg home and warm it in his bed until it hatches and the next time we see him he will have a blue bird on his shoulder<br><br><br> not enjoying the dudefest </br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically, she is, since she jobbed pretty hard to Souma. In retrospect, I'd rather Souma face someone else, not her.</br>  <br>Probably the same one as Souma and Yugi. If he outsells Eishi he'll get a shokugeki.<br>It'll part of why Yugi will be so pissed off at Souma afterwards because Souma'll be stealing the customers he could be using to win over Eishi.</br></br>  Man, I can keep reading the Shinomiya Stagiaire arc and I just don't get tired of it.<br><br>Such a short arc, but it was fucking great.</br></br>  <br>I don't think its fair to term her that. She's arguably the top 4 cooks in her year, aside from Erina. I think the author handled her poorly. Her getting a 95 score, &amp; with her reputation, only to bow out so early due to her not fully comprehending the Bento theme, seems a bit weird &amp; illogical.</br>  <br>I really admire his ambitiousness if that's the case, but he may be biting off more than he can chew.</br>  <br>Alicefag please, it was perfectly reasonable for her glorified sushi boat to lose to Souma who made a groundbreaking bento dish.</br>  <br><br>It's not weird she didn't fully realize the theme. She's a rich girl who has shown little understanding of the plebeian world.</br></br>  <br>A dish that makes the colder Nakiri cry.</br>  <br><br>Thanks guys. Doing this as soon as possible.</br></br>  Were these two  playing videogames  all night long?  <br>because of best semen demon<br><br>S hinomiya </br></br></br>  <br>Every girl is female Takumi.</br>  <br>Yeah, Alice pretty much jobbed harder than Takumi. Jobbing to Giganigga is pretty likely if you don't prepare to face him. Alice fucked up. Takumi did not.</br>  <br><br>I don't think Erina would've made that mistake, had she been in Alice's shoes.</br></br>  <br>Alice is not relevant, sorry.</br>  <br>fuck meant for </br>  <br><br>This. Also  molecular gastronomy is a silly gimmick </br></br>  <br>Alice did not job. Alice lost. Takumi jobbed because the reason he lost was to show how strong and hard to beat Giganigga was. Alice had her own reasons for losing.<br>Jobbing =/= Losing</br></br>  <br>How many points would Erina get in preliminaries if she participated?</br>  <br>That's why he is best girl.</br>  <br>100, she's perfect in every way or some shit, I just know she'll do anything you want her to for some shoujo manga</br>  <br><br>All of them. All the points.</br></br>  <br>99, with the annoying cunt of a sister, because she's almost perfect.</br>  <br>I have to wonder. If Souma won the autumn election, would we still take Akira or Ryou seriously? Evidentaly no one takes Meat, Mimasaka or Alice seriously because they lost. Akira and Ryou couldve been just as displaced.</br>  <br>   playing videogames <br>Honestly, they seem like the kind of guys to be uninterested in  videogames. </br></br>  <br>Yeah, they played Cooking Mama</br>    <br>Curry twin would've Akirafagged her Erina score.<br>99 in the good block, 100 in the bad block.</br></br>  <br>Why not? The fandom is still taking the 'losers' seriously, so I don't think it'll make much of a difference. Besides, the margin between all 3 were incredibly slim, separated by Hayama's speciality.<br><br>In retrospect, I'd rather Souma losing, since he wouldn't have had the 'incentive' to break out of his Pop's shadow, &amp; we would probably never see what we saw at Shino's.</br></br></br>  <br> I remember Souma complaining that you can't bring game consoles into Hell Camp </br>  <br> I don't think Erina would've made that mistake, had she been in Alice's shoes. <br><br>obviously not, since she was just lecturing Souma about the proud tradition of bento before the match.</br></br></br>  <br> Takumi not being a morning person. <br><br>Muh heart.</br></br></br>  <br> It seemed more like a general observation but fair enough, I had forgotten about that. </br>  <br>Trip dubs confirm many games of Cooking Mama were played.</br>   Isami will beat Souma in Shokugeki to get Mezzaluna back to Takumi and at the same time becoming a man Takumi can support   <br>Isami probably has to dress and feed him every morning.</br>   Reading the manga <br> Thin as fuck Isami out of nowhere <br><br>If only I could lose weight that fast, maybe I'd go outside or something</br></br></br>  <br>It's summer fatigue. He gets fat again after the Election.</br>  <br>I want to button his bottom button, if you know what I mean.</br>  Now that I think about it, I actually made chocolate souffles for my birthday a couple of years ago.  The present was having sous chefs do all the prep work and cleanup.  While they did deflate very quickly, the richness and texture of the resulting flourless cake a few days later was lovely. Why didn't Souma take advantage of that?<br><br> I also made vanilla crème anglaise and a butterscotch sauce to drizzle over the souffles. Delicious. </br></br>  <br>Souma winning would be on par with gary-stu MCs. <br>I think it's best for him to have lost, it gave him a more worldly perspective, knowing he has competition from people his age, coming from similar or harsh situations, now he has rivals and peers in takumi, akira and ryou.<br>It's great, will definitely make for great Top 10 dynamics and banter.<br><br><br>The first kg are lost fairly fast, the problem is breaking into the &lt;20% body fat and staying there consistently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe the other point implied in <br>is that they are both non-threats to Souma, despite their hopes.</br></br>  <br>Because in a buffet people just look at tons of food and choose the one that looks better.</br>  <br>Takumi is a non-threat to Souma.<br>Alice is a non-threat to Erina.</br></br>  <br>  Not taking a little bit of everything <br>Do you even all-you-can-eat?</br></br>  <br>That's a super neat present. I got something similar but not as involved when I was a teenager.</br>  <br> imagining Takumi stressing out over a shokugeki, drawing   MAN  on his hand and eating it<br> then Souma comes up and claps his hands together <br>I was not ready for this yaoi moment</br></br></br>  <br>It's like poetry.</br>  <br><br>No, because I'm not an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>That's why you only take a little bit. Or, if you have a multi-day stay, you try a few different things each day if there are enough to divide the sampling up like that.</br>  <br>I agree that Souma losing was best. A shounen MC winning his first tournament is rare, plus he needs some credible rivals for the first seat when Soumas in 3rd year and the senpais have left.</br>  <br>They should become threats for each other.</br>  <br>The problem many people had with that was Curry's 'specialty' which gave him the edge to win.</br>  <br>  Erina has super tongue <br>  Nikumi has super lips <br>  Hayami has super nose <br>What's the problem?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's completely fine, it's standard for antagonists to have an upper hand at first, the completely normal human MC then trains/learns or whatever and overcomes his problems, winning over his rivals in the end.<br><br>Plus, it makes it more believable, these people have had more training than souma, remember that his father taught him nothing, but these guys have experience + training + "special abilities". If Souma had won, I'd have thought that the manga was going to end soon and they were rushing it.</br></br></br>  <br>Erina and Nikumi are hot bitches with big tits, while Hayama is shitskin bishonen, See the difference?</br>  is Dojima a Grappler Baki character?  <br><br>I thought I was reading Attack on Titan for a second there.</br></br>  Re:Monster chapter 15 live typeset.<br>May be a little slow.

However, she can only bring two friends.Who does she bring? and where does she go?  <br>Ayano and Yui.<br><br> Anywhere, I don't care. </br></br></br>  <br>Quads must tell the truth</br>  <br> Who does she bring? and where does she go? <br><br>Easy.<br>Chinatsu and Yui, Akari will join them regardless, because Akarin.<br><br>She would probably go somewhere really close, but take several trains and buses to get there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From the catalog I thought this was a pregnancy checker</br>  <br>Obviously she brings Ayano and Yui.<br><br>She likes attention so would want to keep her dominant harem members close at hand.<br><br>She takes them somewhere that Ayano likes to make puns about, so that Yui can be cutely cracking up the whole time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You think Himawari finally got knocked up by Sakurako? Her breasts have been looking unusually big...</br>  <br>She brings Kyouko and Kyouko, and goes to Comiket.</br>   mom's spaghetti   If the yurus were in a band, who would play what instrument?  <br>Akari would play  triangle. </br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br>what else would she play?</br>    <br>Kyouko: Guitar<br>Yui: Bass<br>Chinatsu: Costume design (she's aiming for cute, winds up with death metal)<br>Akari: Triangle<br>Ayano: Manager<br>Chitose: Piano<br>Brat: Drums<br>Boob-chan: Shy lead singer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could see it</br>  Found this in my old screenshots today, Himawari sure has a big bush.  <br><br> what the fuck </br></br>  <br>Indeed she is.</br>  <br>Because she can drink cocoa like an elegant adult</br>    <br><br> Drink Cocoa <br><br>Lewd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My kisekae yurus were better, and edgier.</br>  <br><br>I bet they weren't.</br></br>  <br>Chizuru a cute.

I know they scanlated a few of them</br>  Don't die while I'm sleeping, little thread.  <br>if this thread is still here in the morning I'll be surprised</br>  I want to cum inside tomato pajamas.    <br>I will keep it up just for you anon. Sleep tight</br>  <br><br>I'm surprised there aren't more doujins about Chitose. She has a lot to work with. Chizuru is better, though.</br></br>    Why is Kyouko so artistically gifted?  <br>Autistically*</br>  <br><br>She probably has ADHD, but I doubt she's autistic.</br></br>  <br>How can a person even be autistically gifted?</br>  <br>Very easily amused.</br>  <br>Oh cmon even I would want that shirt</br>  <br>I guess we're all autistically gifted.</br>  <br><br> that fucking shirt <br><br>Damn Namori for making me love Kyouko more and more every time I see her. ;_;</br></br></br></br>  Hey Yurus, just letting you know if you haven't seen it yet I've started a yuru yuri kik group (#yuruyruilove), anyone is welcome. and dont ask about an IRC, i dont wanna pay money for a server so yeah  <br>#yuruyurilove, spelled it worng</br>    <br>what the fuck is this shit</br>  <br>but i don't have a phone. why are you excluding me?</br>  <br>Over 20lbs of pussy and ass</br>  <br>I am so confused and aroused rn</br>  <br>You wouldn't this snail.</br>  <br>I would.</br>  <br>I want to drink her  t e a </br>  <br><br>I would China her Chu.</br></br>  <br>How lewd.</br>  <br>no no no no no no</br>  <br>i already said why, im not gonna pay for a server</br>    <br>We're always here anon. We're here to remind you that you are deluded with your shitty thread that you bump with image spam. There is no need for you guys to keep a constant general up for your show.</br>  <br>last thread lasted 5 days, I think we will be safe, ayano-chan</br>    <br>not fair! i want to talk to people too!</br>    does anyone have more pics of Akari from the manga?  <br>she's even obfuscated by her own weapons. poor akarin. ;_;</br>  <br>You're better just setting up a room in something like raidcall or something</br>      BAM!  Thinking about oppai  <br>Thingken*</br>  Wait, why do you guys think IRC channels cost money???  <br>I would totally play a shump game of akarin and her buns as weapons. Kinda got the vibe from that image.</br>  <br>millennials</br>  What is Akari dreaming about? <br> just finished reading yuru zero. Other than Archer being way off character it was pretty good  </br>  <br>She's dreaming of being popular with the girls.<br><br> Little does she know she's already very popular with the little girls on /a/. </br></br></br>   needing to poop and no bathrooms nearby   Who are you going to main /a/?  <br>Anyone not maining panda is a faggot. <br>  why Dante?  </br></br>  <br> just woke up <br> thread is still alive </br></br>  <br>I'll stick with my main girl Himawari. She's an underdog.<br><br><br>It's been "updated" unnecessarily.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're welcome. Now it's my turn to sleep. <br>I'm counting on you!</br></br>    <br>Thanks! I'll do my best!</br>  <br>Reading through it for the first time at the moment and making crops as I go. Got about 120 images so far with about 30 being Akari. Will post them all as an imgur album or something when I'm done.</br>  <br>It's an SMT: Nocturne joke.<br>And now I'm imagining the yurus as SMT demons.<br>Chinamata.</br></br></br>  <br>Just skimmed through my smt4 bestiary and no yuru demon look alikes <br><br> tfw no demonic yurus with which to drown the world in chaos </br></br></br>    Bumping for the starving children in Africa. China Sue cares THAT much.     Check Bakkin. <br> No new chapter. <br>Delete your thread OP.</br></br>  <br>Here we go again.</br>  Is everyone in the other thread?  saved by chinasue  <br>I want Chinatsu to lick ice cream off my cheek too ;_;</br>  <br>You can let it die, just make another one when there's more anons around. Can't even have discussion if there's no peeps.<br><br>I want to marry Sakurako.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a comforting presence, it's nice to go to sleep, wake up and find the thread still here.<br><br>Thankyou based phallic-object-eating Chinatsu for saving the thread.</br></br></br>  <br>i might've killed myself by now if not for the comfiness of this thread.</br>  Chinatsu is love and Akari loves her.  We can't move to a chat because not enough of us have smart phones, or at least interest in downloading that smart phone app. (I just don't have much data.) And the Anon that made it doesn't understand what IRC is.<br><br>Anyway, I agree that it's very comforting to wake up to this thread being alive, and it gets really hard to find replies to shit you said yesterday if you keep having to search for archived threads.<br><br>It's lovely to wake up, have some tea, and read meaningless babble about cute lesbians.<br><br>And of all the cancer on /a/, this is clearly the best, cutest. It's almost as wonderful as Akari's wonderful sister.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want to marry Sakurako?<br><br>Okay, that's a bad question, obviously any sane person would want to. But do you really think you can be a cuter wife than Himawari? The competition is too strong, Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to be Akane's imouto!</br>  <br>Ah, to be truly loved.<br><br>It's nice how these sisters are so close.</br></br></br>  I want to be Yui's sister      Any /a/nons gonna get the Yuru Yuri video game when it comes out?  <br>Nope.<br><br> Since I don't own any console. </br></br></br>  <br>we don't know how much yuru stuff is in it. i might buy it though.</br>  <br>It seems like it might be quite a bit since YrYr has been the most advertised.<br>I want to see Karen though.</br></br>  <br>shit, i didn't know there'd be kiniro mosaic characters in it. and after a quick googling i saw there'll be tesagures too. i guess i'm buying this game.</br>  <br>I really hope they actually do something with the crossovers. I want to see Shino get all kinpatsu over Kyouko and Sakurako.</br>  <br> image for ants <br>I'll pass on it if it only has a handful of songs, which seems likely, but I hope they make another, only more yuru-oriented.<br><br><br>http://miracle.sega.jp/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KIN!</br>  <br>PATS</br>   page 10   Have you handgargled today yet anon?  <br>That'll never catch on.</br>  <br>So you say but I've just finished doing it</br>  No! Bad Chinatsu! Akarin doesn't want it! Get! Shoo!  <br><br>Yes, Akari is extremely opposed to this</br></br>  <br>When will the trauma end</br>  <br>how can we save akarin before stockholm syndrome kicks in?</br>  <br><br>It may already be too late. ;_;</br></br>  <br>I'm afraid she's too far gone now.</br>  <br>I want to go with her.</br>  <br>Definitely too late.</br>  Okay non-IRC people.<br><br>I'll register an IRC channel, I like Freenode.net personally.<br><br>##yryr and ##yuruyuri are already taken. Any suggestions what name we should use?<br><br>I'm not convinced this won't die without the asynchronous nature of 4chan but it's worth a try I guess.<br><br>How is the phone-only chat going, phone guy?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> name <br>nanamori or gorakubu, perhaps?</br></br>  <br>Why would you post a Bane mask with a white background?<br>We all already have better shoop images of that.</br></br>  <br> irc <br>sounds pretty good<br>you'll be able to use it on nearly all devices</br></br></br>  <br>##rumraisin</br>  <br>##rumraisin on irc.freenode.net is ours<br><br>I'll go ahead and sit in it most of the night.<br><br>If it doesn't work out, well all the more reason for us to continue having this very on topic thread all the time.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It will either get as slow as this thread or will become full of erp. The reason this threads work is exactly because it's slow and I can post something and come back to find and answer 3 or 4 hours later.<br>That can't happen in an irc room</br></br>  <br> become full of erp <br>Is that something that actually happens often?</br></br>  <br>It happens from time to time in these threads. Something about lazy lesbians attracts that crowd</br>  <br>Yeah, the slow nature of the thread is nice.<br><br>Just thought with this guy with his app and the couple others complaining about it, maybe we could try.<br><br>And if it's slow enough, the reply might still be there hours later! (Although I hope not.)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the irc is that slow it won't be any different from these threads and the only real difference would be that people would have names</br>  <br>Stupid sexy Yurus</br>  <br> China_on_the_prowl_for_a_mate.gif </br>  <br>Happens all the time with cute girls.

N-not that I've ever done it in these threads but it's fun to read every now and then</br>  <br>Hmm. That stutter makes me think otherwise, anon.</br>  <br>But I haven't! I'm too pure for that!</br>  <br>We all have our dark side.</br>  <br>Is that your confession to being a nigger?</br>  <br>Yes. I am literally completely black on one side, like a special edition Friesian.</br>  <br>That sounds somewhat delicious</br>  <br>pls no cannibalism</br>  <br>M-maybe just a nibble?</br>  <br>We've become that which we once mocked.<br><br> Maybe just a nibble. </br></br></br>  <br>Did we now? If you hadn't compared yourself to food this wouldn't have happened. <br><br>  I'll just nibble you in the ear a bit then.   It's still your fault    </br></br></br>  <br><br>And then anon was delicious keiki.</br></br>  <br>I keep my thoughts about 99% Yurus pure. I talked about this in a thread a week or so back. But if I were a lazy lesbian I'd need a girl like Chinatsu, because even as one I'd probably still have no initiative.</br>  <br>Waaai~ delicious anon cake!</br>  <br>Are you going to make me take responsibility?</br>  <br> Waaai~ </br>  <br>How the fuck did you get pregnant from an ear nibbling? <br><br> I'll help you raise it  </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Get married you homos<br>It's legal now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joke's on you faggot it's always been legal in my country</br>  <br>Didn't you know Yurus can get pregnant from hand-holding? So ear nibbling is pretty much guaranteed magic science babies.<br><br> I knew you were an anon I could rely on. </br></br></br>  <br>science rules.</br>  <br>Well fuck then I may have more magic yuri babies around. <br><br>  so do we get married now or just keep split custody?  </br></br></br>  <br>What are you, some kind of ear nibbling fanatic?<br><br> I'm not sure I know you at all anymore. But I don't want our child to grow up in a broken home either. It doesn't seem Yuru at all. </br></br></br>  <br>I think I was in that thread actually. Maybe you just need a serious head injury either?</br>  <br>This is the other common form of lesbian impregnation.</br>    <br>Now I'm just going to wince whenever one partner abruptly snaps off their half midway through.</br>  <br><br>why is this purple dyke so fucking beta</br></br>  <br>When I was in pre school me and friends of mine experimented on ear nibbling so now I'm afraid one of them got pregnant <br><br>  but those years are past me and I think I'm ready to settle down with a nice yuru who will love me  <br><br> sorry I'm at work and needed to do something  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think a better question is when did Kyouko become so alpha?</br>        <br>It's fine as long as it was just practice.<br><br> I trust you'll be a good girl then anon. Together we can make this family work. <br><br> We've had our fun and that's all the matters. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LEWD </br>  <br>It was. <br><br> I'll be in your care as well anon-chan. I'll say this upfront though. I'm terrible at cooking.  </br></br></br>  <br> terrible at cooking <br>I'm suddenly open to polygamy. <br> We haven't overcome all these obstacles to starve, right? </br></br></br>  <br>Rude! <br> I'm willing to learn if you can t-teach m-me.  </br></br>  <br><br>Can't please your man if you couldn't cook.

It's past 4 here but you were too entertaining to abandon sooner anon.  I hope work goes quickly!</br></br></br>  <br>here anon</br>  <br>Well then I'll prepare an apron in case we do this again. <br><br>  it was fun and kept me entertained in an otherwise boring night so thank you!   <br><br>Sleep tight anon-chan</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>they really improved her looks in the ova<br>i don't know but TYO artstyle looks really similar to the manga</br></br>   Sakurako VA has bigger boobs than Himawari VA <br>How do we fix this?</br>  <br>You look at this face and just now she's fantasizing about hand holding and baby making</br>  <br>so just holding hands?</br>  <br>yui also got improved ALOT<br>and by alot i mean alot</br></br>  <br>And apparently ear nibbling</br>  <br>How are they so qt?</br>  <br>Yui now looks like Yui, instead of a bug eyed mantis.</br>  <br>also i wish ayano used this outfit for the entirety of the OVA</br>  <br> not having a bug fetish </br>    <br>where the fuck does this happen<br>SOURCE NOW</br></br>  <br>She finally confessed.</br>  <br>when does this happen<br> &gt;inb4 chitose fantasies </br></br>  goodnight nerdos  <br>cya bud</br>  awooooooooo  I miss Sakura Trick  <br>W-why are you howling?</br>    <br>A doujin</br>  <br>no awoo-ing below this line<br>____________</br></br>    <br>i am going to bed now but pls link it</br>  Okay so this is stupid, but it never hurts to have more things to talk about.<br><br>Which Pokemon Ruby pokemon would each of the Yurus be?<br><br>I'll start:<br>Torchic: Sakurako<br><br> Yes, this is really just me playing Pokemon and wanting to name them after Yurus, but I don't really give a crap if they actually work together. I just want to be thematic. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THIS JUST IN: Local Akari goes "Awoooo!"  <br>Who is this semen demon</br>  <br> wants to enslave the Yurus and make them battle each other </br>  <br>No, only to defeat lesser beings.</br>  I want to obliterate the boypussy of a cute, feminine anon with my humongous yuri cock.  <br><br> only to defeat lesser beings. <br><br>So, basically,  all of humanity ?</br></br></br></br>  Which of you fucks spammed the SW thread?<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127234332 </br></br>  <br>Don't see any spam.</br>  <br>Daily reminder that the manga pushes Kyouko x Yui and the anime pushes Kyouko x Ayano, so both are equally correct.</br>  <br><br>Manga &gt; Anime &gt; OVA<br>The designs are great but they don't do much with them.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, they've both got it half right.</br>  The other i read a fanfic about futa Sakurako raping Kaede<br><br>Why would anyone write something like that?</br></br>  <br>Kaede is a miracle of the universe.<br><br>That is unacceptable.

I guess it's normal for yuri series but it still seems a little weird to me. But I understand where they're coming from.</br>  <br><br> I understand where they're coming from. <br><br>Too easy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We already discussed how Akari got preggers, Anon.</br>  <br>I, too, would a yuru. They're just so cute it hurts.</br>  <br><br>Who do you think you're inseminating here?</br></br>  <br>All of them!</br>  <br>Did Akari go to Mexico?</br>  We can't have too much Akari x Chinatsu in here.  Who is the gayest yuru in the world?  <br>I-I don't know who you're calling gay, Anon.</br>  <br>Voting Ayano, Chinatsu and Chitose</br>    <br>Ayano could be a fashion designer she always looks great</br>  <br>And she has such perfect shoulders. The OVA was wonderful.<br><br>But fashion designing is too low an ambition. If she and Chinatsu team up, that is world domination level competence. They could hire Yui on as their enforcer.</br></br></br>  <br>You would REALLY want China doing anything art related on a team? <br>After Ayano Kyouko is probably the most fashionable one</br></br>  <br>Nadeshiko has a girlfriend, so probably her.</br>  A modern day philosopher  <br><br>She has much to teach us. I look forward to more of her wisdom in Season 3.</br></br>  <br>Namori could probably be a fashion designer at this point. If the inside dress were longer her school uniform would probably be fantastic in real life too.</br>  <br>The outfits in Yuru Yuri are always fantastic.</br>  <br>Kyouko is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>Yup, totally agree.<br><br>It is great how Namori has such realistic outfits, to some degree, for the yurus. It is like she was a little girl once.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah well "she" wasn't.  they're a jellyfish </br>  <br>I know she is a jellyfish.<br><br>Hopefully a immortal jellyfish.<br><br>Otherwise there will be generations of humanity with no Yuru Yuri. Like, how terrible do you think that would be. I couldn't even imagine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Clearly objectively correct</br>  <br><br> blue ribbon  <br>this is outrageous</br></br></br>  I'm tempted to read the manga.  <br>You should, it's even better than the anime.</br>  <br>I agree the manga is pretty fantastic, also read Oomuro-ke, after reading it all go and read the "Yuru Yuri Beginnings Rx" and then YuruZero doujin, and the other Yuru Yuri doujins, particularly everything Goyac has done, particularly Secret Flowers.<br><br>Most can be found on Bakkinbakkingamu</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like I'd burn through the manga too fast. I've been reading manga that are getting adapted next season and I seem to be finishing them a bit too quickly for my tastes.</br>  <br>Isn't that just an issue of self control? Just pace yourself through it and you should be fine</br>    Who do you think Akari would most likely be in a relationship with?    <br>W-Well, it's n-not like I wanted to b-be with her...</br>  <br> Bakkinbakkingamu </br>  <br>Not really <br>Both the manga and anime pushes both pairings equaly but yui and kyouko has the most interaction<br> too bad best pairing only happens once in a while <br> I want too see more yui and ayano interaction </br></br></br></br>  http://yuruyuri.com/nachup/<br> Akari and Kyouko on same leg <br>Hope this isn't a sign S3 is going to be full of crack pairings.</br></br>  <br>I think the Akari x Chinatsu flag has already been triggered.</br>  <br>Finally someone who gets it.<br><br><br> But Kyouko x Akari is cute. </br></br></br></br>  <br>that's cute anon</br>  Ocassional reminder that you'll never be sandwiched by two blonde dykes  <br>I want to die.</br>  <br>i want to always be there for you</br>  <br>Oh hello suicide-chan, how's your cult going?</br>  <br>Sandwicchi is already with me,  but you can sandwich with us if you want to. <br><br>Pretty bad since nobody posted the gif in the last two threads.</br></br></br>  <br>A-at least that increased your will to live  r-right? </br>  <br>Don't worry,  I can't kill myself or I'll become dead-chan. <br><br> At least I'll wait until the end of the third season. </br></br></br>  <br>But then you'll miss the OVAs and s4 announcement</br>  <br>please don't do it, suicide-chan. i don't think i want to die yet but i promised i'd do it with you.</br>  <br><br>Since I'm reading the manga, I don't think I can kill myself anyway.<br><br>Namori will keep me alive.<br><br> And I don't want to die until the fifth season of Hidamari Sketch. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not allowed to die until the rest of us do, because heaven will be lonely otherwise.<br><br> inb4 we all end up in different circles of hell anyway </br></br></br>  <br> your waifu will never loving murder you <br>I'd kill myself, but when I realize that its not her doing it I lose all of the energy to do so.</br></br>  <br>if there's an afterlife i'm definitely going to hell. i hope it has yuru yuri.</br>  <br>Maybe I'll die tomorrow and another anon will play Suicide-chan, I count of you guys if that happens!</br>  <br>i-i'll lovingly murder you, anon</br>  <br>on you*</br>  <br>but i'd always know that it's not you!</br>  <br>I'll always be in your heart, that makes me happy.<br><br> A-are you Sandwicchi? </br></br></br>  <br>of course it's me.</br>  <br>Aoi = Shellos</br>  <br>I-I'm happy to see you're still here.</br>  <br><br><br>And that folks, is the story of how suicide-chan found another reason to live in Sandwicchi<br><br>Good for you two  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i would never leave. i love yuru yuri too much.</br>  <br>Greatest love story ever told.</br>  <br>Hope we can stay together until the third season.</br>    <br>more gore yurus</br>  rank  <br><br>Best, best, best, and best.</br></br>  <br>i dont understand why you said best 4 times there are only 3 girls there</br>  Just thought I'd mention this again because we actually have two people in here chatting right now, but I made an IRC channel.<br><br>##rumraisin on irc.freenode.net</br></br>  <br>that joke doesn't apply to loli Akari, she had presence back then<br> Then Kyouko stole it from her </br></br>    <br>i can confirm that people are talking in there.</br>  <br>But it'll feel weird to have a name attached to my anonymous ERPing</br>    <br>Shino doesn't have to be disappointed though!<br><br>She can be in a kinpatsu sandwich!</br></br></br>  <br>I still hope she gets to meet Kyouko and Sakurako in that crossover dancing game.</br>  <br>What if i take the kinpatsu away from her?</br>  <br>i will fuCKING HUnT YOu DOWN</br>  <br>Shino pls don't forget to breathe</br>  <br>Shino + Alice + Karen + Kyouko + Sakurako 5-way!<br><br><br>Remove beam, replace with Shinobu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J87<wbr>RGyZbHSk</wbr>  [ ]</br>    <br> No Yui and Ayano <br>Why stop at 5?</br></br>  Flat-chan joins the fun  <br>i want her to bite me</br>   Precure Thread    Towa Civ form <br>Yes I know Tumblr sucks and all that but I was stumbled upon it while looking for some dub reggae precure thing someone did on soundcloud a while ago.<br>I need it for reasons.</br></br>  <br>I like it. She looks like a princess.</br>  <br>She's beautiful. I like it more than Twilight's design. And that smug look on her face.<br>I'm in love.</br></br>  <br>I like it, she looks quite in that picture</br>  <br><br>You know, that doesn't look so bad. There's hope after all.</br></br>  Will we ever see a non-japanese team?  <br>There should be a possibility for that. Didn't Miho have a German friend?</br>  <br>No idea, where was this mentioned?</br>  <br>Girls und Panzer: Little Army</br>  <br>That's can only happen if/when they want to do a world senshado championship.</br>  They eat Italian food, close enough.  I would like to see a college team. Supposedly that's a thing.  Latest Rabu Rabu 4-koma Web Edition translated:<br><br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/205<wbr>1146?tags=girls_und_panzer<br><br>New chapter of Rabu Rabu on Comic Alive is also another Anzio chapter.

She's Asparagus, commander of BC Freedom school from Girls und Panzer: Ribbon Warrior manga.</br>  <br><br><br>Damn these girls are packing.</br></br></br>  <br>That ammo rack is glorious.</br>  <br><br>Nice to see Miho taking after her sister.</br></br>  More Anchovy.  Miho needs to go back, her best girl sister is there.  <br>Her psychotic miho hating mom is also there</br>  <br>Oh, shes not going to be cool even after the forced clapping?</br>          <br> Favorite team the only one not sold out <br><br>I want.</br></br></br>  need more fluffy  <br>Fluff=old and busted<br><br>Shizuka=new hotness</br></br></br>  <br>They're the same as highschool teams, just a bit older girls.

That's just kinda her default expression</br>  <br>Her default expresion is even LESS surprised than that.</br>  Will we see Maho smile in the movie?  <br>thems is fighting words anon</br>  small side note: looks like this months chapter of more raburabu will be about Anzio again and also has colour pages. There should also actually be an Upotte chapter again    <br>Sounds like a good month</br>  <br><br>They're all a fine bunch of girls.

I'm not sure if it's fujo material or just a gag doujin. There's no R18 symbol.  <br>S A U C E<br>A<br>U<br>C<br>E</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> me name </br>  <br>well he is jojo the sailor man</br>   Barbie Girl is a Semiautonomous Stand that transforms those touched by it into Dolls and makes everyone forget they existed. This effect deactivates once the user is defeated. <br><br> The User is a 30 year old male, who has been kidnapping girls from the local school to add to his "collection"  <br><br> Naturally he gets his shit punched in. </br></br></br></br>   #<br>Nishino Nanase, from Nogizaka46.</br>  <br>I think it's pretty safe to say that is yaoi.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you spoiling</br>  <br>This stand already exists, fucknut. I don't know how you missed it.<br><br> read the manga </br></br></br>   Still no 44 translation   <br>No one on the Jojo threads likes custom Stands, so I spoilered it so people wouldn't have to look at it, purely because the idea is terrible.</br>  <br><br>maybe Kira was a pirate, he did hang around boats all the time</br></br>   finally finish watching part 3 with bro and roommates <br> still no part 4 announcement <br> still no chapter 44 <br>Why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like Atum without the lie detection thing.</br>  Postn some art.  <br>I'M SORRY! tbh I don't know how I missed it either, this is what happens when I lift a thing from a thing and put it into another thing when in that thing is already a thing in the thing I'm putting the thing from the other thing into.<br><br>Did that make any sense to anybody?</br></br></br>    mandell020170.podomatic.com/entry/2<wbr>014-03-29T05_41_03-07_00</wbr>  Gay priest is thinking if he should come here.  <br>Is this worth reading?</br>      <br>Johnny sucks.<br>Tusk is a shit stand whose powers consist of "finger gun" and "I win".<br>Fuck 'em.</br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck is there a word for getting embarrassed for things other people did</br>  <br>Anon is thinking you should fuck off.</br>  <br>yes. Even without reading that butchered thing you call a sentence.</br>    <br><br>Or you could just link to the imgur album you got it from instead reposting shit we've already seen and shitting up the thread</br></br>    <br>Can I tempt priest to come here with shirtless DIO?</br>  Hato chapter when  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  <br>go back to painting peanuts gimmicks are the only thing you're good at</br>  <br> -Doing/wearing anything steampunk related <br>I've thought about requesting something like that, but it doesn't fit the theme of her show. Good luck with that one.</br></br>  /r/ing Elizabeth doing something cute  <br>I hope he starts posting right when the first thread is made and we have 3 days of chaos.</br>  <br>ur a meme coin</br>  The ending was literally perfect. Overall, UBW was better than Fate/Zero and this is coming from a secondary.<br><br>Everything about it was amazing. If only Shirou and Rin got to continue their journey together, I'd die a happy man. Honestly though, I really doubt Heaven's Feel can top this. <br><br>Fate Thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's just sick, well i don't like her anyway.</br></br>  <br>It's the highest magecraft can get.<br>"Projecting" your inner world on the enviroment and emulating the ability of True Demons and TAs.<br>You normaly need tons of research to get to that point.<br> See Nero Chaos </br></br></br></br>  <br> like Lair of The Beast King <br>That is a legit Reality Marble though. And not at all like Kiritsugu's bounded field of innate time control. <br><br>The Emiyas never mastered time manipulation. They died and whatever magic they had were seized. Kiritsugu doesn't even have more than a scrap of the crest to begin with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero 9/10<br>UBW 6/10</br></br>  <br>I honestly though I was the only one who thought that since /a/ likes to constantly shove to my face how perfect of a couple they are</br>  Marry, fuck, befriend  don't know who any of these are...<br>fuck/fuck/fuck nonetheless</br>  Fino is too perfect for me. I'd go for Manager and her delicious inverted nipples.  <br>just her? or harem end?</br>  Marry Fino, fuck Manager, befriend Nova  <br>what? uncensored version? how? when? where?</br>  Is spinning around the right answer? Was Pauli's theory right?  <br>Holy shit. <br><br>Girl deserved it.</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno is also a vegetarian and wasn't allowed to go to art school.<br><br>You tell me anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, just a winter of difference.</br></br>  So Yui understood that Haruno called them out on the fact the were ignoring the love triangle? Yui knew that the chocolate making event was a sham to get 8man to try their chocolates without letting on that they loved him?<br><br>I don't know how else to interpret what Yui said here?</br></br>  <br>Even as a Yuifag, it was really disappointing to see Yukino's character get completely shit on throughout the season. Maybe it's because they're just high schoolers, but Yukino wasn't half as autistic and prone to criticism last season. And Yui didn't play as dirty either.</br>  ITT: Good shows that everybody seems to have forgotten  <br> Not Ogiue </br>  <br>  shock value <br>Fuck off carlos</br></br>  <br>Manipulate the market to kill CR<br>Reinstate sakoku</br></br>  <br> I think that didn't matter that much, but I hate how, when the two became a couple, Eureka turn into "the little princess to save" for like 10 episodes or so. <br>I dislike the Earth arc so much, but the payoff with Dominic and Anemone, as well as the final episode? That made it worth it.<br> What was that? The one where Renton read an adult magazine? That was neat <br>Yeah.<br> No wonder Renton got so aggressive! He just wants to be a father! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I convinced my normie friend to stop using CR and download fansubs for JoJo <br> &gt;still haven't convinced him to watch the good stuff yet <br>It's a start</br></br></br></blockquote>]
