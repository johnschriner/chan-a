[  no Umaru thread <br>Get in here</br>  Umaru is for  Thank you Touch-san.  momonga doesn't sound spooky at all  So why did he choose the name "Touch Me"?  <br>Because he's a horny old man</br>  <br>Because his build makes it so that nobody can actually touch him.<br><br>It's a dare.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably some silly shit, like most people creating an MMO name unless they're on an RP server.</br>  <br> It's a dare. <br>I'd like to agree, but the average japanese naming convention never makes that kind of sense.</br></br>  So where did Ainz go wrong? If Touch Me was still there, he'd be absolutely disgusted with what Ainz has done and let happen.  <br>How did they manage to make a spoopy skeleton with a perpetual glare look so vulnerable and cute?<br>I don't understand this.</br></br>  Paladins are fags  <br>Just imagine him speaking like Skeletor and you'll be alright.</br>  <br>I don't like this theory. It assumes he was a badass right from character generation.<br>It's more than likely a spur of the moment thing.</br></br>  <br>"Chinchin" would be better. Having the NPCs talking about 'Chinchin-sama'</br>  <br> MYAAH </br>  <br>That makes the no-self-confidence internal monologues even cuter.<br><br><br>It could work in a way. Chin chin is JP SFX for birds chirping, so they maybe were to innocent to assume a Supreme Creator meant to name himself Penis.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is a difference between Momonga and Ainz, he is not human anymore</br>  So, what race was Touch Me?  <br> If Touch Me was still there, he'd be absolutely disgusted with what Ainz has done <br>If Touch Me was still there, Ainz would probably be deferring to him to make all leadership decisions beyond the management of Nazarick, hence Ainz wouldn't quite be so evil.<br>He'd still be a near-emotionless undead lich, but he'd at least have his friend/idol/mentor around to calm down and joke with.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but it's still a cool little idea.<br><br>Then again, this being a P2W MMO, maybe you could change your account for a fee and he just thought it up after coming across his invincible build.</br></br></br>  <br>Dragonkin</br>  <br>memelord.<br><br>+5 levels in all your job classes when wearing a mask<br>+2 in your secondary racial classes when using fishing gear</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since the moment he come to this fantasy world he is no longer a human and will naturally think and act like a lich</br>  I just finished reading volume 4.<br><br>Do the lizardmen get more interactions with Nazarick later on, or are they not relevant at all currently?</br></br>  <br>If he had Tabula, I bet the two of them would have done much more heinous deeds.</br>  <br>They fry em up whenever they're hungry</br>  Why is Skeletor so moe?    <br> alignment <br> Greater Good </br></br>    the Pleiades have a very well balanced party<br>2 rogues( CZ Delta Ranged sniper, and Solution Epsilon anti melee assassin)<br>2 warriors(Wolf Queen Battle Cleric[is also a healer], Yuri Alpha Striker)<br>2 casters(Narbel Battle mage, Entoma Asian Talisman mage/ insect summoner)</br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/EK28DsRneGI  [ ]</br>    <br>And Lastborn, the Berserker</br>    <br> mfw a Lich's closest friend is a birdman. </br>  <br>All their names were absurd. I think that's sort of a trend for japanese MMORPG players.<br><br><br>This is also a clever guess. He one shotted those five cockslurpers like a meager mob.</br></br></br></br>   watching this shitty .hack ripoff <br> this terrible art style <br> terrible music <br> plot incoherent as fuck </br></br></br>  <br>So what are those giant horns on his shoulders? They really bother me.</br>  <br>is Lastborn a berserker? I though the berserker was Lupusregina the Werewolf Battle Cleric.<br><br>what's wrong with a Wizard having a Lord of Change as a friend?<br><br> Overlord being anything at all like .Hack </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me ultimately abdicated. He left. Technically your very own statement answered the question. If he's not here, he didn't care anymore like the others, it's Momonga/Ainz who cares only and that's also the main focus of this story.</br>  <br>The size of one's pauldrons are directly proportional to their strength.</br>    <br>how can a emotionless skull be so expressive?, i almost burst out laughing with that scene</br>  <br>He probably got it wrong. We haven't heard anything really about Lastborn other than that she's a human and a Lvl. 100 NPC head-maid.</br>  <br>I think it's that we know that Ainz is a soft, lonely woobie beneath those hard skellybones. He just wants love.<br>We know not to see that skullface contorted in an evil glare, but a sad and lonely young skeleton wizard ambushed on his way to skeleton school where he wanted to become a skeleton doctor and help poor skeletons when they got osteoporosis, who is saved by a crazy and heroic dragon man.</br></br>  <br> Overlord SoL with Yaoi Romance <br>10/10 would Fujowatch</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed this scene far more than I probably should have.</br>  <br>The floating kanji make it.

You know Yui used to wet herself until the 3th grade. She would be so embarrassed in the morning and tell us to call in sick for her. It was so cute.  <br> Hikki-kun! Did you two really go see that movie? Yui used to be so scared of horror movies. Otosan once brought home a Hollywood horror movie dvd, and Yui got so scared that she ran to her bed in the middle of the night. So cute! </br></br>  Oh shit, i  genuinely  think i actually dislike Yui due to her hair color  <br>It's that light brown dyed color in the LN if it makes you feel better.

What do you think she wanted to talk about?  <br>Fuck I know exactly the one you're talking about. The guy was actually their son/brother, and he came in his mom's mouth while his sister was tongue-raping his face.

I know that love is not based on merit but If Yukino wins, her win would have been achieved without having moved a finger:<br><br>1) Yui was pretty much sinking her own ship throughout vol. 11 because she didn’t want to be “unfair” to yukino. Furthermore, she was being considerate of Yukino and gave her chances to advance her relationship with 8man but she wasted them because of muh drama. To make matters worse, Yui will most likely get her heart crushed in vol. 12 in order to get 8man to understand that someone as wonderful as Yui can love him.<br><br>2) Iroha is teaching him how to be comfortable around girls and she is also teaching him how to be more open and conscious of a relationship (how 8man discovered that girls are sweet and spicy).<br><br>3) Sensei seems to want 8man to give yukino the genuine. Komachi, the cunt, (and haruno?) also seem to ship them and are actively trying to help them.<br><br>4) Haruno has been doing what she can to help Yukino get over her dependency issues. It is true that she can go about it in a nicer way, but who is to say that she hasn’t done so before and that only led to yukino taking advantage of that kindness and turning it into reliance.<br><br>5) Even though everyone is helping her, either indirectly or directly, she still has the audacity to ask 8man to help her some day.<br><br>6) When someone finally calls her out on her dependency issues, her only reply is:<br><br> Hurrr durrr, you are right, therefore I’m going to depend on you guys and make a request. <br><br>I know that by the end of the series she is going to get some character development which is going to prove that she is not dependent, but if she wins, her victory would have been attained by having everything handed to her. Everyone is doing their best to get Yukino and 8man together or to win the 8bowl for themselves; meanwhile, Yukino is too busy counting how many scratches the shoes of the people she talks to have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how it works, anon.</br>  I want to kill these fucking threads.  <br> Yui understands him the most. <br><br>No. Komachi, Sensei, and Yukino understand him better; you could even argue that Iroha, Haruno, and the cunt understand him better than Yui.</br></br></br>  It shivers down my spine, I feel it drawing closer. Can you sense it, too?  <br>Yukino understands him the same way he understands her, they're always wrong about what they think they know.</br>  <br><br>Soon her warmth will embrace us all.</br></br>  <br>I can give you Komachi and Sensei, but Yukino's relationship with 8man is practically defined by the fact that the two of them misunderstand one another. The last three might understand his way of thinking, but they don't understand jack about his feelings.</br>  <br>Komachi I agree, but Yukino? nah.<br>Iroha definetely understands him.<br> “I mean, if I invited you normally senpai, there’s no way you’d come, right?” <br> “…That’s true.” <br> You’re quite something. She understood me enough that she could probably receive a third grade Hikigaya certificate. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's probably going to tease her about it from now on.</br>  How long do you guys think this madness will continue on for?  <br>Until Volume 12 and beyond.</br>  <br>Everytime I see that image at first glance I see Sestuna from Gundam 00.</br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  <br>"I want something Gundam"</br>  <br>Yuigamamas</br>  いろはす～  <br><br>Has Yui ever tasted MAX COFFEE?<br>We already know Yukino has and comments about how incredibly sweet it is, which she then later comments about how 8man loves sweet things since he's always drinking it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are these for petting?</br></br>  <br>I mean yeah she probably has at some point in her life, just like how most people have tasted grape juice. It doesn't mean it's at all a common occurrence for them.<br><br>It just so happens 8man and Yukino both happen to like the same drink more than the average person. 8man is a bit of a fanatic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  いろはす〜  What if she's dishonest to herself until the end?<br>What if Hikki finds out about her feelings when it's already too late?</br>   Yui  <br>Typical LN heroine who likes the MC just 'cause and is only crushing on him for comedic effect and the occasional sad look. She isn't actually in love with him.</br>  <br>Then we get WA2 ending.</br>  <br>Why do you think she made her daughter wore a yukata just for "that" occasion?</br>  <br>It isn't a question of if, it is a question of to what extent. Does Gahamama know how much her daughter loves him or does she figure it is a cute crush? <br><br>How do you think she figured it? Yui going on and on about him or was it the change in tone and mood when she spoke about him?</br></br></br>  This fucking thread with no proper title is going to either die off or take two days to get to bump limit.  <br>Pardon him, he's a Yuifag</br>  <br>Doesn't this make you think OP's like a faggot or something?</br>  If 8man wanted to avoid having a romcom with Yukino then why did he make her fall for him?  ITT people that need to move on  <br>There is no love triangle. Only one girl genuinely loves him whom he's willing to reciprocate and also willing to struggle against his trauma because he loves her too.<br><br>Another one is just having a misunderstanding because she's been copying her BFF's attitude, got fucked around by her sister, and low inter/intrapersonal skill.</br></br></br>  <br>This must be the third of fourth Yuifag thread that has the OP fuck up.<br>I'm blaming penguins.</br></br>  <br>He's using her to get revenge on all the girls who turned him down in the past.</br>  <br>ITT hypocrites</br>  <br><br>ITT people that should just fuck already.</br></br>  <br>What if this actually happened. 8man wrecks both their hearts and rides off into the sunset?</br>  <br> her feelings <br><br>What? Like she is still having a lingering affection towards Hayato? And she misattributed it to 8man?</br></br></br>  So nanodesu is taking down their yahari translations. It also looks like YP is aware of the fan translations going on right now.<br>You guys might be fucked.</br>  <br><br>Please don't bully the Yui. She's a very sweet girl and Yukino's best friend. She's done nothing to warrant such abuse.<br><br>Remember back when we all celebrated Yui's birthday?

The Spice and Wolf anons did it for years.</br>  <br>At least there was no fighting.</br>  <br> "I want something bona fide" <br> "hikki" becomes "hikigaya" <br> "senpai" becomes "hikigaya" </br></br></br>  <br>Surely even Yuifags found this funny.</br>  <br>You mean the drama CD where all of her "normal friends" completely ditched her?</br>  <br>Don't worry, no one's fighting in this thread.<br>OP's a faggot and everything's alright.<br><br>Nevermind.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on. Even I was laughing at the Iroha bag scene. A bit of comedy at another character's expense, even your favorite, is fine in moderation.</br>    <br> "Did I just hit someone   again?" </br>  <br>Almost murdered a schoolmate and a dog.</br>  <br> never had to lift a finger </br>  I love Haruno  <br>You'll be happy to know there's a 70 fucking page doujin for her on pixiv.</br>  The fuck is that shit this cunt is using as a "tie"?  <br><br>She loves you too.</br></br>  <br><br>bolo tie<br><br>maybe he's a westaboo?</br></br></br></br>  I don't understand the Haruno hate, if anything she's actually quite analogous to 8man lol.<br><br>I'd be quite happy if her question "does genuine really exist" is solved by 8man.</br></br>  S2 was a mistake.  <br>Bolo Tie, rich faggots wears them all the time.</br>  <br>She is the best. Fuck ultimate form Yukino (which is just how she was towards the end of volume 6), Ultimate form Haruno will be the most genuine and the most breathtaking.</br>  <br> Ultimate form Haruno <br>She'll be a Christmas cake by then<br>Wait, that's even better.</br></br></br>  <br>  Implying Yukino will ever blossom into a true woman. <br>8man needs to go for the true Yukinoshita.</br></br>  <br>I hope genuine wrecks her panties too one of these days.</br>  <br><br><br>Agreed, Haruno is the real prize.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. In the end, it all plays into Haruno's hand.</br>  Are Harunofags the new senseifags?  <br>We aren't cakefags. Haruno's a young woman.</br>  <br><br>8man should have kissed her during that scene. I wonder how pissed she would get.</br></br>  <br>She openly flirts with him every time they meet up. I don't think she'd be in any position to be surprised at his reciprocation.</br>  いろはす～  <br>Isn't she's the face of her family?<br>If anything a scandal would rise</br></br>  <br>No joke, No trolling, I honestly think she wants to bang him herself.</br>  <br> Isn't she's the face of her family? <br>Who knows? 90% of her character and the Yukinoshita family in general is a mystery.<br> If anything a scandal would rise <br>She's a college student from an upper middle class family, not the prime minister's daughter. Nobody would care.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously. And that is what will happen. Just embrace it.</br>  <br>She's an attractive female character in a harem series. Of course she wants to fuck him.</br>  <br>A bit more than that. Papa Yukinoshita is a diet member.</br>    <br> this kills the Yuifags </br>  <br><br><br>Aren't we hurting the Yukinofags more? Haruno is literally a better version of her in a every way.</br></br></br>  <br> Haruno is literally a better version of her in a every way <br>Explain why 8man's a Yukinofag</br></br>  <br>I want to bully Yui and make her cry, <br> and then hug her, give her a kiss and tell her how much I love her </br></br>  <br>8man is a mix of Yukinofag, Irohafag, Saikafag and Komachifag.<br>Such a faggot.</br></br>  <br>What makes you think that? We know next to nothing about Haruno other than her personality which 8man thinks is a facade.</br>  <br>They are just a bunch of fags who don't know how to read in between the lines or Yukinofags who truly believe that being Yukino is suffering, even though this anon has proved how everything is handed to her.<br><br>Haruno is the true batman of this series. 8man “solves” problems by making people hate him (social suicide), however, he either doesn’t care about those people or he dislikes them. Haruno, on the other hand, plays the villain in order to fix her autistic sister, a family member whom she is extremely fond of. She plays the villain for her sister's sake albeit the fact that she wants to be close to her.<br><br>Haruno playing the villain is only a small example and a small glimpse of her sacrifices.<br><br>We don't even get to see what truly happens behind the scenes with their family problems. Yukino turns into the biggest autistic character whenever her mom shows up. However, not only does Haruno interact with their mother in a daily basis, but she also does everything without complaining and performs each of her mother's request seamlessly. She puts up with their mom in order to give her sister freedom and the potential to live a happy live. <br><br>Haruno sacrifices her own happiness to help her sister; meanwhile, Yukino is too busy thinking of her drama and why the world is so cruel to her. Haruno executes every single one of these deeds without resentment or hatred of her sister; as a matter of fact, she feels quite the opposite, she wants nothing but the best for her.<br><br>Being Haruno is suffering and the thing that makes her so great is that you never hear her complain or whine about her own issues. That's why I truly wish that 8man is able to show her that genuine bonds exists. Because I feel that all the bullshit that she had to go through for her sister's sake has made her the cynic that she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br>Yukinofags hate her because she's the character that is constantly calling out Yukino on her bullshit.</br>  <br>Yukino will hate her, because she can take it. Because she's not her hero. She's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A dark knightess.</br>  <br>10/10<br>New copypastenon material<br><br> I totally agree with what you said here </br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruno is a cute little girl to me though.</br>  <br>I want MTSP to do a vanilla doujin on her.</br>  <br>Yo, sup!</br>  <br>Try to be less obvious with your bait next time. <br><br>I will agree with <br> Such a faggot. <br>though. It's the only logical explanation for why he hasn't impregnated this and taken responsibility yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he excluded the girl that gets shit on all the time <br> it's bait! </br></br>  <br>He prefers Yukino because Haruno is too scary for him, he finds it disturbing when Yukino smiles like Haruno however.</br>  いろはす～  What if Yukinon is just mad because they don't let her have a cat?  <br> 8man can have that any time he wants <br> he doesn't do anything <br>Is he a queer?<br><br>I wonder, how would Yui feel if she knew 8man actually did like her.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 8man actually did like her <br>I would love to post a Costanza but I'm on mobile.</br></br>  <br>Why does Yui call Hikki kimoi when she likes him?</br>  <br>8man would miss most of his 3rd year of higschool too from being laid up waiting for a pelvis donor.</br>  <br> I wonder, how would Yui feel if she knew 8man actually did like her. <br>And here we go, delusion time.</br></br>  <br>8man likes her  as a friend. </br>  <br>I wonder how fast she would be on top of him if he were to confess to her. What do you think is her dream confession?</br>  <br>Something generic as fuck in a shoujo manga or j-drama that gets your average nip nigh school girl wet as fuck.</br>  <br>When 8man for the first time called her "Yui"?</br>  <br>Someday</br>  Loved Iroha's reaction when Yuki and Hachi were arguing about how they'd solve the StuCo fiaso  <br>Well he did called her "YuiYui" during her birthday's party if it counted.</br>  <br>Are Drama CDs even considered canon by WW?</br>  <br>He straight up called her yui on her birthday party. Yui was just left speechless and 8man decided to avoid eye contact.</br>  <br>Birthday Song for You is a bonus track just like the Christmas party, I'm sure they're canon.</br>  <br>It'll be too embarrassing for him. He'll probably bring back "Gahama" when talking to others and go with whatever the male equivalent is to women addressing their significant other as "anata"</br>  <br>Then he had "slip of tongue" and called her "Yui".</br>  <br>He called her 'bitch'.</br>  <br> Yui was just left speechless <br>Was it that kimoi?</br></br>  <br>You guys should at least learn your hiragana, it takes a few hours.<br> Gahamama: Hikki-kun!! Yukinon-chan <br> Gahama: Wait.. </br></br></br>  <br>There is no way she called 8man kimoi when she asked him to called her "Yui" in first place as her birthday's gift.</br>  <br>I almost despaired when I couldn't find it.</br>  <br>Really? I would think him calling her "Yui" would dry her up.</br>  <br>You should know by now that "kimoi" is the Yuifag equivalent of "platonic"</br>  The only sexual attraction they feel for each other is about friendship and nothing more.  <br>That's why he should call her "bitch" or "slut" again, those were the times where she showed the most emotion. When he called her "Yui" she didn't say anything (implying that she didn't like it).</br>  <br>Is she ded?</br>  What if Volume 12 is only the climax of this arc?  <br> speechless = dislike. <br>Yukino pls</br></br>  <br>Yui - Dog<br>Yukino - Cat<br>Irohasu -  Doroboneko ?</br></br></br>  <br>Bolo tie = gift from Yukino<br>Pan-san = gift from Hayato</br></br>  <br>Yukino's family is the final arc unless there's some arc for "genuine" too.</br>  <br> When he called her "Yui" she didn't say anything <br>She probably needed a change of pants.</br></br>  <br>There has to be an arc for genuine.

It’s not that I didn’t want to take someone’s hand because I was uneasy.

It varies by dialect for some words. Old RP in the UK used "an historic" because that accent dropped the aitch, while america uses "a historic" because the h is pronounced. The "a" is often different from the "a" in "a cat", though. My dialect makes me want to pronounce the a in "a historic" as "eh", wheras "a cat" is always "uh kae' ".</br></br></br></br>   tfw just finished hiragana and katakana parts <br> can already read and understand basic words and sentences <br><br>This is making me happy.

I did 60 new cards in anki today and read some chapters on grammar. When it comes to grammar, after reading about a concept I immediately want to jump into reading to find examples of it but my vocabulary isn't even on a level where I can read Yotsuba without looking up simple words. My kanji level is past N5 but my vocabulary is not, sad to say. I tried doing a vocab exercise on memrise but it primarily used romaji so I couldn't get into it.  <br> Put your hands to a place where your hands can be seen <br><br>Doesn't sound odd in Japanese</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you have to know then is it really the most important thing ever?</br>  <br>Japs like to repeat themselves</br>  <br>を見える doesn't sound odd?</br>  <br>RTK everyone look at it and laugh</br>  <br>Oh right, so the first 手 is part of a clause for 場所. disregard the question then, i'm not japanese yet.</br>  <br>You will never be Japanese.</br>  <br> Hands where they can be seen <br>Not really</br></br>  <br>I actually didn't do RTK, I just use the wanikani deck. It only took a couple weeks to get to over 500 kanji so it's not a big deal, but I haven't been splitting things up by all three decks (kanji, vocabulary, radicals) included. It's my own fault.</br>  <br>Hmm... well shit, if only there was some kind of way to see a video with audio that explained the concept.</br>  <br> を見える <br>Yeah that sounds odd because that's not how it works. The particle attaches to the object, not the verb.</br></br>  <br>You don't think it should be 手が見える?</br>  <br>honestly I didn't feel like I did enough until I started doing 100 words a day then I stopped doing that and started reading now I feel like I don't read enough because I'm not reading all day long</br>  <br>in some cases it´s correct, where's this from?</br>  <br>動くな！銃を捨てろ。手を見える場所に手を置くんだ</br>  <br> in some cases it´s correct <br>What cases?<br> where's this from? <br>Not that guy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 手を見える場所に手を置くんだ <br><br>stop.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok then I guess I just need to have more patience. I know my own limits and increasing my cards will just cause me stress and I'll burn out quickly. I'd rather read and take down every unknown word than do 100 cards every single day.</br>  <br>   </br>  <br>No shit nigger, I mean't the actual game/manga/LN</br>  <br>yeah it's definitely better I only do 10 cards but by reading I learn maybe 40 before I get tired</br>  <br><br>Where the fuck did you find that sentence?</br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with RTK, it accomplishes exactly what it promises to do, which is teach you how to write all the jouyou kani with proper stroke order. In fact I think a lot of people could benefit from doing at least the first 150-200 kanji in RTK in order to learn to think in terms of radicals.</br>  <br><br>some blog i stumbled upon<br>http://blog.sixapart.jp/2013-09/thi<wbr>ngs-to-say-before-you-die.html<br><br>theres english translations there too, just ctrl-f the quote</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> げったぅと おぶ まい さいと びふぉぁ あい ちぇんじ まい まいんど <br><br>thanks anon.

I listen to her on repeat everyday.<br><br>I would post it but then you'd know who I was, and I want to stay anonymous here. although, you'll probably find her already now after knowing this.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea. Maybe I could tell you if I read the whole chapter.<br><br>In any case, please use proper punctuation. I had to read both of those sentences twice before I was sure that I had understood them properly.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you actually had a conversation with her or does she just thank you when you compliment her?</br>  <br> In any case, please use proper punctuation. I had to read both of those sentences twice before I was sure that I had understood them properly. <br><br>Is English even your native language? Anyway, there's no need to be so rude, if you don't know the answer just don't reply.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't have the first, people keep saying it's dead so I didn't buy it.<br>Does it have players?</br></br>  <br> you've already posted one of her videos her before <br> i've been chatting with her ever since then <br> we've already fallen in love <br> i've already bought a plane ticket and will soon be living in her apartment <br> tfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In any case, please use proper punctuation. I had to read both of those sentences twice before I was sure that I had understood them properly. <br>You're right, "proper" is the right word. Because all adding punctuation to those sentences would do is make them sound proper. They're already grammatical without the "missing" punctuation. At worst, you'd have to stop at the two conjunctions for a moment. That's it.</br></br>  <br>I grew up with English and German in a country with four languages. And I don't think that I was being rude, I was just asking you to use proper punctuation as a courtesy to those who read your posts when they try to help you.</br>  <br>She only thanks me when I compliment her　(｀；ω；´)<br><br>I know I'm delusional, but I really like her. I know she's probably just being polite.

Actually, I still haven't seen any girls as cute as them. Also, I took their virginity. Also, there was 8 of them. So, lol. More than you for sure. I may be a neet loser now, but I wasn't when I was a kid. More than you can say.</br>  <br>I got this reply on /int/ already, but thank-you.</br>  <br>Yea, I'm not even kidding anymore. You're fucking retarded.</br>  <br>No, those commas are not "missing," they are completely optional. Only an ESL kid would have trouble parsing either of those sentences.</br>  <br><br>It still has two or three servers that are full on a regular basis, but only two or three.

Honestly, most of the reason I posted this stupid retarded shit is to spread her around. She has way too low views for how good she is. I don't know why she doesn't post on niconico... Maybe she wants western attention? Well, I'll give it to her then.</br></br>  <br><br>Someone talked about have to put in info before.

Are the questions mostly like the example questions they have put up?</br>  How often do you learn kanji from reading the same word over and over again. I'm a beginner, and i've learned a couple. I imagine you learn more when you're at a higher level  <br> "Intermediate learners can manage daily communication" <br><br>kek, I bet most people in this thread that rate high on this scale can barely keep a verbal conversation going</br></br></br>  <br>you look up kanji you have trouble with in a dictionary you see it in a bunch of different words and realize it means that and has this and that radical</br>  <br>She's amazing though and you can't deny that. can you figure out who I am though?<br><br>Enjoy my gift to you.</br></br></br>  <br>god damnit because of all the stupid questions we've been getting I thought you were asking how instead of how often</br>  <br>Lol no, 3 years in, got my N5 last year, went to japan 3 weeks ago and everything went just fine, except for kanji, fuck kanji</br>  <br>Finnish<br><br><br>Just took a look at the sample questions and yeah, that's pretty much the same. I didn't get any pictures in my listening section tho<br><br><br>I've chatted with natives without too much trouble</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 years to get N5? I did N2 in 10 months</br>  <br> having a power level exactly equal to 9000 <br>He merely said he "learned from anime".

I'm in the UK with a shit connection and still get a relatively good ping. Not sure how it would be if you're American though. No idea where the tank server is.<br><br>I've used to hate maps like Zhitomir which is just a bunch of apartments but I've learned to love them. Winterwald seems similar to one of the maps that still comes up every so often but I can't remember the name.<br><br>I rarely use the vehicles but I think it's similar, though a lot less detailed as one would expect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> N2 in 10 months <br>Pics or it didn't happen</br></br>  <br>Has she shown her face? <br><br>Fuck it dude, just message her. What's the worst that can happen? She ignored you or declines your advances.</br></br></br>  <br>I am a native English speaker and would like to comment that the second sentence with the extra commas reads better. It is a sign that the writer understands the fragments being parsed and provides the reader with a punctual reflection of how the statement would be expressed. Blocks of text introduce unwanted noise which can produce ambiguity. <br><br>It is, in a very real sense, taking an idea and formatting it with clearly defined boundaries that naturally occur in oration, provided the person doesn't suffer from speaking fluency problems and/or autism.</br></br></br>  <br> I've chatted with natives without too much trouble <br>Via voice or text or both? It's ez as fuck to write in Japanese because you have time to prepare(use google all the time).<br><br>Especially when you're at that level when you know when something sounds off or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I fell in love with her purely through her voice.<br><br>Also, fuck japanse TV..

The only "real" studying I would say I have done is doing core2k. Rest is from anime or chatting with natives because I wanted to do those things, not because I wanted to study. I suppose it's the immersion strategy gone too far<br><br><br>It's all in text because I'm one of those shy faggots who don't have a mic</br></br></br></br></br>  wow, the reason i fucked up reading was because i didn't know that particles always modify the word before, now im reading with much less mistakes. don't be a retard like me  <br><br>Technically, they're optional, but not if you care about style.<br><br>Between these two sentences, though, the first sentence is the better one, because the second one contains a grammatical error. <br><br>The comma should come before the "and", not after it. Yes, yes, we know you pause there when you speak, but that's just not how you write. Better to not have any commas at all than to misuse them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't stress anon; few people are this oblivious.</br>  <br> the reason i fucked up reading was because i didn't know that particles always modify the word before <br>I hope you're trolling</br></br>  <br>That isn't a grammatical error. <br>People who lack creativity ought refrain from commenting on something as fundamentally creative as language.</br></br>  <br>i got bored of grammar books half way, and looked up shit i didn't know, when reading i translated the text and struggled.</br>  <br> creativity <br>That's certainly an interesting defense.</br></br>   Card was a leech. It has been suspended. <br>FUUUUUCK</br>  <br>Show me your ways</br>  <br>Look at the format you fucking sperg: this is a discussion forum not a place to submit static works such as an essay. It is more correct and natural to write in a spoken style in a live dialogue. <br><br>Be aware of the context before comenting on style apppriateness. Language is first and foremost a creative means of communication. Clarity and accuracy of expression trumps ideals of arbitrary structure if the purpose is to communicate with people.</br></br></br>  <br> i got bored of grammar books half way <br>Never drop grammar books, I decided to ignore grammar books as well at first and just go into reading and it was painful. Went back and finish Genki 1&amp;2 and had a much much better time.</br></br>  <br> half way <br> didn't even learn how particles worked <br>don't lie anon</br></br></br>  <br>i knew what they did, i just didnt know how they work, the book never told me, or maybe it did but it completely slipped my brain<br><br>im looking up stuff i don't get, and its working quite well.</br></br></br>  <br> im looking up stuff i don't get, and its working quite well. <br>Looking up stuff in a dictionary from time to time is hassle enough, I wouldn't want to add grammar to that as well. But that's just me.</br></br>  <br>Not the guy you are replying to, but I sure hope that you don't consider yourself a representative of the English language.<br><br>Even in spoken style will people make pauses in their speech at given moments. Indicating this through punctuation is only appropriate. And furthermore, the communication here is in written form. The only time when it is natural to use spoken style in written word is when you are writing a script for a comic book or a theater performance or something else of the like.<br>Written discourse, regardless of the dynamic of the discourse, will follow the rules of written language.<br><br>You don't seem to understand that punctuation is a means which serves clarity of expression. Just like it is more difficult to follow a character in a cartoon which speaks without any pauses as opposed to one which speaks in a natural manner.<br><br>Speaking of which, do you also pronounce the words "apppriatness" and "coment" in the manner in which you write them?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is that anon who's been simultaneously studying German still here? I was wondering how you've spaced out your study time to do that.  <br>If that's the case, then why are you even commenting on a poster's lack of comma usage in the first place? Shouldn't his post also be protected by your "creativity" shield?<br><br>Also, relax. In between the random swearing and the autism diagnosis meme, you're misspelling words left and right even as you try to write your best. There is no need to be upset.</br></br></br>  If I show the back of a card and then go do something else, will the time I'm afk count to the studied time?

And vice versa for もらう<br><br>Also the author said "S1 かわりに S2, S2 takes place to make up for S1" So shouldn't the translation be the other way around (I taught him English, so he taught me Japanese)?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's almost as if you were implying that you deliberately left out what would be the third word in your sentence.</br>  Is there anything out there similar to the /int/ japanese threads?<br>I keep going back there because it's the only place I can find where a bunch of people actively talk in both english and japanese that I can easily jump in on if I want<br><br>But I just can't take it easy there because of the unbelievable quantity of namefags and most of the time it's just a circlejerk.

I don't give a shit about /int/<br>but I like how the japanese threads are on that board (aside from the complaints I already mentioned)</br></br>  I haven't done my reps yet.  So does the JCAT even mean anything? I just took it and felt like a complete retard the entire time and yet according to the score they gave me I am supposed to be N2 level... Or is JLPT just that basic?  <br><br>I only did the sample questions and now I'm scared to do the whole thing. I'll probably try when it's not 3AM.</br></br>  <br>Actually, only the time looking at the front of the card counts in "time studied". At least in the Windows version. So that statistic is actually a bit misleading if you use Anki as a study tool and not just as a review tool. i.e. looking at the back reading example sentences / mnemonics, etc.<br><br>For this reason, I use an android app (clockwork tomato) on my cell to manage my study time.</br></br></br>  <br>I never do them unless I'm on a long ass commute. Just can't do it on my free time.</br>  <br> Is JLPT just that basic? <br>It seems its difficulty is overrated in general. Keep in mind a lot of plebs are out there trying to prepare for it in stupid ways. Also keep in mind that you only need like 60% overall to pass.<br><br>J-CAT uses some kind of predictive algorithm to judge your level. Common sense -- even if you get a high score it doesn't guarantee you can go in cold and ace the JLPT perfect. You'll probably be able to pass though. At the very least, your level is high enough to easily handle a study guide targeted towards your test level.</br></br></br></br>  any of you guys have have recommended audio to listen to on a frequent basis?

I did have a fun conversation with a lalafell guy though, he was nice. The quests are a way bigger problem than talking to people. They use normal japanese, that I learned in manga. The game uses fucking weird ass RPG japanese that I've never encountered before.

I'm just trying my best everyday.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I assume that means it'll take place shortly after August 2nd whenever they finish reviewing the applications.</br>  Fucking weeaboos<br><br>Go back to /jp/</br></br>  <br>nani the fuck did you just say to watashi?!</br>  <br><br>Is it free?</br></br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br>nai wo iitterunda kisama<br><br>yaru ki ka?</br></br></br>  <br>I mean yeah, I guess, but I kind of need to know the exact timeframe for this program if I'm going to consider applying...</br>  <br> I don't know if I know 200 kanji <br> generate kanji grid  <br> 911 kanji ayyy call the police </br></br></br>  <br><br>Hmm. I might try applying then.<br><br><br><br>don't make us yattsukeru you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>That's implied<br>What did you think I meant</br></br>  I knew I was bad at listening, but I didn't think I'd do poorly at reading. I often thought the questions were a bit ambiguous, though.  手から剣を抜けて部下ごとマリカを貫こうと繰り出す。<br>楯の部下の腹部から襲ってきた剣を死神は身を捻って避ける<br><br>I'm so confused what is going on in this sentence, So the ごと means like "through" right? So then the 繰り出す is relating to him, right? or did I push his human shield forward and "sent him forth"?<br><br>But that that doesn't make a lot of sense how then then attacks from his stomach, which is apparently missing since the shield just took a hit for him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't read VNs but I would say no because to become a good reader you need to read everything. Even Final Fantasy games are written completely different using different grammar styles more than others.<br>FF5 is much simpler than 6 or 7</br></br>  <br>What kind of company/organization hired you?</br>  <br>the grading is more strict on reading</br>  <br>but what if you didn't understand everything how, how can you learn?</br>  <br>?<br>That's part of the process. Im reading ff7 and 5 just the script googling things when I don't know them. 6 im playing for relaxation and still reading and half ass googling.<br><br>I don't think I understand thec question.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well if you have the translated script thats different but if you're reading something you can't look up then you miss the opportunity to learn that word/grammar/phrase and if you miss it or get it wrong or guess youve fucked up and youll probably never get a chance to correct it</br>  <br> something you can't look up <br>Use kanjitomo or just draw the kanji in google to look it up</br></br>  <br>It's a part of the process.<br><br>What are you using to study with?</br></br></br>  <br>im trying to read nukige and im scared ill miss something, I haven't read a line in days</br>  <br>Just do it bitch.<br>You will make hundreds upon hundreds of mistakes but it gets easier. Do a small amount a day than work up. It gets much easier</br></br>  <br><br>It really is one of those things where you don't want to make mistakes but there's no way to progress without doing so and you can't wait until you are perfect.<br><br>It's good if you don't go for the thing you've wanted to read for years straight away and pick something like, well, a non-plot heavy nukige where it won't fuck you over too badly if you miss a line or two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but it's already fucking with me, it's hard for me to even sleep at night when i think about how I could have taken that sentence wrong and if I misunderstood the prose and foreshadowing or if im taking it too literally or if im not taking it literally enough or if i missed a meaning</br>  <br>Anyone? I really need some help with this ごと</br>  why no one likes her  <br>because is a best grill</br>  She sucked Gendo's penus  <br>cool</br>  cos shes all for me :)  <br>Because she's shit.</br>  <br>I like her</br>  Is Rei still the most popular character in Japan or did the rebuilds ruin her?     The anime industry is cursed forever thanks to Rei and Asuka <br><br>Thanks a lot.</br></br>  <br>I-i-i-its not like i wanted to curse it forever or anything!<br><br>BAKA ANON!</br></br></br>  <br>she has no style</br>  <br>she has no grace.</br>  <br>a doll? haha no</br>  <br>I was thinking about that, actually. <br><br>Eva is not only a pretentious shit story, but also fucked up everything to the day. If we used to have good stories with great characters, thanks to this garbage now we have the obnoxious faggot MC, the retarded tsundere and the doll girl which doesn't actually matters. <br><br>Thanks Eva for fucking up everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because everyone likes her.</br>  <br> being this insecure </br>  We've been over this. She is lifeless and emotionless. Rei was outright DESIGNED to be creepy and unappealing, and yet retarded otaku decided to sexualize her anyway.<br> Asuka was designed to be unappealing too, btw. you're all a bunch of retards. </br>  <br>I don't think so</br>  <br>This. There's only one Evangelion character who was designed to be appealing.</br>  <br>ffs, can't you reifag autismos keep your powerleves confined to one thread<br/></br>    <br>What?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>It's not Anno's fault that nothing will ever be as good as Eva in the industry ever again.</br>  <br>Asuka sucked Kaji's dick so it's okay</br>  <br>Kaji is hotter than Gendo.</br>  <br> le reverse bait <br>No effort here.</br></br>  <br> good as Eva <br>Did you miss the part where I explain why it's horrible and fucked things up in the industry?</br></br>  <br>It's true though.</br>  <br> why no one likes her <br>People clearly have no taste.</br></br>  <br>Even shittier bait.</br>  <br>He's expecting the anon to name the "one Evangelion character who was designed to be appealing"<br>And then for all the shit to break out.</br></br>  <br>Wait, who is he talking about? I'm genuinely confused.   Is it the K word?  </br>  <br> bait </br>  <br>Bait.</br>  <br>It's Kaji, yes. Stupid sexy Kaji</br>  <br> you will never be as based as Kaji </br>  <br> You will never pull this prank on Shinji </br>  <br> you will never make Shinji blush and giggle </br>  <br> Bait </br>  <br><br><br>gay fanbase as always</br></br></br>  <br>gay fanbase for a gay show</br>  <br><br>Even the food is gay.<br><br> There are no KxS Twinkies </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the girls must be awful indeed for everyone to be gay</br></br>  <br>Sounds to me like you're just a faggot.</br>  <br> you will never go gay camping with Shinji and his bros. </br>  <br>h-how did they spend time?</br>  <br> Anno: Sadists, without question, go to Rei, because of their sadistic desires. I believe that masochists go to Asuka. And, there is a tendency for women of the same generation and people who are children mentally to go to Misato. </br>  <br>Sword fights in the tent.</br>  <br><br>I like her OP, she is very reipable.</br></br>  <br>Manly things like hunting, fishing, and taking manly cold baths in the lake together.</br>  <br><br>I think its the opposite way</br></br>  <br><br>And taking manly dicks in their manly ass?</br></br>  why no one likes her?    <br>living the dream</br>  <br>A Rei is fine, but Asuka a best girl</br>  <br>Asuka a shit</br>  <br>Who's that behind her?</br>  <br>your taste a shit</br>  <br>No anon, you like a shit tsundere. It's obvious whose taste is shit.</br>    <br>Kaji's huge cock which she had previously sucked.</br>  <br> Touji_and_Kensuke_get_cucked.jpeg </br>  <br>Not even him but your taste is utterly shit if you like Rei. Please kill yourself as soon as possible.</br>  <br> hating tsuntsun </br>  <br>Rei blushing. <br>0/10.<br>It's almost like there is a scene where Rei falls atop of Shinji naked and gives no fucks.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd suck Kaji's cock no homo</br>  <br> You will never be this mad </br>  <br>Fells good doesn't it?</br>  <br> fells good </br>  New trailer http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>yu0mj_boruto-movie-new-trailer_tv</wbr>    HAPPENING  kill yourself  <br> Gentle Fist w/o Byakugan <br>THIS NIGGA<br><br>THIS FUCKING NIGGA RIGHT HERE</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do Sarada have bad hearing too?

Why can't they just be RIVALS?<br>I'm not watching this</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128412999 <br>Thanks for drawing attention to this thread.</br>  Honest question newfag here. Are people just mocking in this thread or they actually hate this show?    <br>Gentle fist is just expelling chakra from your hands and rest of the body. You need the Byakugan to target the opponent's chakra system properly.</br>  <br>And they said he didn't inherit anything from his mother. Still, does this means he's mastered both types of taijutsu?<br><br>And Gentle Fist without the need of the Byakugan... no wonder this kid can kill a god.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413105 <br>Just like his dad.</br>  <br>I'm actually excited for the movie</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413088 <br>Thanks CIA</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413088 <br>*throws ur dubs out of a plane*</br>  <br>The Hyuga were implied to have two Kekkai Genkai. <br>The obvious one with the Byakugan and the ability to expel chakra from all 361 Tenktesu which is the basis for Rotation.</br></br>  <br>After seeing this trailer I can't wait. This is exactly everything I've wanted to see from this kid.</br>  <br>the stance and the air palm, though? it seems hinata did train him after all, even if he can't use the gentle fist</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128412999 <br>Haha</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413222 <br>Ha</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413199 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413200 </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128412999 <br>check en</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128412999 <br>Whoa nigga you crazy skilled</br>  <br>Maybe. Or he might just suck at it, which is why he only blew some air on not-Shikamaru's face.</br>  Shit, magic in this thread  They Mitsuki's father is and they censored it.<br><br>Also little fucker has Gentle Fist? <br><br>So he'll have once he's fully grown<br> Gentle Fist <br> Rasengan <br> Chidori <br> Probably Sage Mode </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413222 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413200 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413199 <br><br>what the fuck is going on</br></br></br></br>  <br>People hate the show and don't want narurtards on /a/ because they are cancerous as fuck.</br>  <br>Don't forget the Hiraishin and Sage Mode.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413199 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413200 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413222 <br>Checked</br></br></br>  Those headbands sure are  SHINY AND CHROME   <br>it seems shikadai stopped his shadow</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413200   <br>Oh god, he's got the Uchiha lust.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413105 <br>who wouldn't?</br></br>  <br>Makes sense. Which means we know his abilities as well.</br>  <br>You don't really need the Byakugan if you memorize every single chakra point.</br>  <br><br><br>I ship it.<br><br>It's gonna be intresting how this plays out.<br><br>Also, Boruto uses gentle fist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I don't know about you, but I like this show even though I don't enter too much on Naruto thread, however Boruto having the Gentle Fist makes me smile. <br>Also I am not really a big fan of Sasuke and Sakura, but I cannot just think about how good-looking is Sarada and how she will look when she become an adult.</br></br>  <br>so the movie will be their chunnin exams?</br>  <br>True. All you'd really need is an anatomy textbook and a good memory. <br><br>Or he might not care about precision and just try and fuck up your internals with chakra.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413400   <br>Yes. Big dumb aliens are only in the third act. <br><br>Also from the looks of things Bort gets snagged at the last minute by Shika's Shadow Possession.</br></br></br>  So this is a dub thread, right?<br><br>I really like cowboy bepops dub.</br></br>  I like this thread.  <br>So close, yet so far</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413555 <br> File size isn't 555 </br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413600 <br>WHAT</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413555    all these repeating digits ITT   This thread is proof that Naruto's rabid haters are immensely worse than actual Narutards.<br><br>It doesn't stop Naruto from being discussed here, so why bother? You're only clogging up the board and threads with garbage, making it harder to remove actual Narutardery. It just makes you look impotent.</br></br>  <br>OH BOY</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413659 <br>Damn son</br>  cute dubs  <br> Fulfilling their genetic destiny <br>And a MItsuki will be added to the mix so the kid has stretching powers.</br></br>  <br> news 9 <br> post ended in 9 <br><br>wow</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because the manga has ended, no one watches the show, mods have already stated that back to back day to day threads aren't even allowed/wanted unless it's specifically made for NEW stuff.</br>  <br> being this mad <br><br>You can always fuck off back to /r/anime if you want to talk about nurutu.</br></br></br>  Looks like the dub magic is gone.  <br>No, it's like this.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413888 <br>CHRIST</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413888 <br>Sweet.</br>  Considering everything, I'm surprised the Moon Village didn't do shit after the Chunin exam.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413888 <br>Noice</br>   Mod deletes posts instead of deleting whole thread. <br><br>Whoa buddy.</br></br>  Just had a sandwich, and what do you know, the autism is gone.<br><br> Doujins when? </br></br>   All the dubs were deleted   <br> naruto  <br><br>Reddit please leave.</br></br></br>  <br>Again. It does not discourage Naruto threads. And OP at least mentions a "new" trailer. Guess who is diverting janitors from genuinely awful threads? Yep.<br><br><br>I've always been indifferent to Naruto (looks like shitty shounen), and detest both Narutards and the idiots in this thread messing up the entire board for no actual gain. All of you can kindly stop visiting /a/ forever. Thank you in advance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br> buhu why cant I have my reddit thread? :((( <br><br>We all know that you narutards aren't even from /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the next Sunahara one?<br>Sarada was in his last one.</br></br>  Will people learn that there are naruto fags in /a/ that also want to talk nicely unlike reddit faggots?<br>Because for sure I wanna talk about Boruto being just a punk but at least has the fighting style of best girl. Or where the FUCK is Hinawari</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128413555   <br>Shhh, it's just the narutard mod. He might get triggered</br>  <br> Maybe the next Sunahara one? <br>Nah. His art style makes me want to vomit and it'll be filled with Pink Shit.</br></br>  <br> First doujin is either Mitsuki x Boruto or Mitsuki x Sarada <br>   More likely Naruto and Sasuke fucking their own kids </br></br>  <br><br>have they said who the hell the parents are of the kid in the middle?</br></br>  YOU ARE MY FUCKING FRIEND  <br> Or where the FUCK is Hinawari <br>Looks like you'll have to wait for the movie because I'm pretty sure this was the last trailer.<br><br><br>We've endured this much, haven't we?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My father is -censored- <br> Sarada and Boruto are surprised.  <br>Orochimaru confirmed.</br></br></br>  <br>Narutards are the ones shitting up the board, though. I remember how they started spamming threads just because one of their threads got deleted.<br><br>You don't know what you are talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>Getting her cake splattered all over the place by the big brother she adores.</br>  The fighting scenes looked cool<br><br>Will it bring back the chunin exams feels naruto used to have?</br></br>  <br><br>Well, at least it isn't gay this time.</br></br>  <br>He says it in the trailer but they fucking censored it.<br><br>Also, translation when?</br></br></br>  <br>He is a punk ass kid, yet he inherites both his mother's gentle fist and shyness?? Ok...</br>  What's with all this sudden heterofaggotry in shounen?  <br>Those people don't exist. But even they wouldn't want this cancer on /a/ Just fuck off back to reddit.</br>  <br> Will it bring back the chunin exams feels naruto used to have? <br>Kinda looks that way, doesn't it? I've seen more taijutsu in these few trailers than in the last 100 or so chapters of Nurudu.</br></br>  <br> posting a pre moot picture <br> thinking it still aplies <br><br>Kek, get with times grampa</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just fuck off back to reddit. <br>How about you fuck off to tumblr and reddit at the same time autistic faggot?</br></br>  <br> Reddit thread <br><br>Please just leave.</br></br></br>  <br>Homo and hetero are part of an ancient cycle.<br><br>Like the Star Gods above, one rules for a time and the other eventually takes its place at the destined time for the next cycle.<br><br><br>I'm betting Orochimaru is the mother. He's done enough experiments to himself so its possible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kek <br><br>Thanks for proving my point, newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>Nurudu's been hetero as fuck ever since The Last.</br>   reddit: 8 matches <br> gaia: 0 matches <br>How times have changed.</br></br>  <br> He's done enough experiments to himself so its possible <br> Orochimaru is a hermaphrodite <br>Would anyone be surprised? Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Gaia is dead.</br>  <br> Kek <br> defending nurutu <br><br>It all checks out. Its obvious that you aren't from /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, at least he's not retarded when it comes to romance like his father. And at least he's not gay.</br>  <br>Most of them are from tumblr/deviantart anyway.</br>  The new Naruto movie is actually called Boruto?<br><br>Holy shit, I thought that was a joke at first, as in how fucking boring this shitty series is, therefore it's Boruto.</br></br>  <br>It's the romanji for Bolt, so they probably think it sounds pretty cool.</br>  <br>It sounds like Minato and Naruto plus 'Bolt' is a reference to Neji meaning 'Screw'.<br>Also possible relation to Minato's Flying Thunder God and Jiraiya's name meaning 'Young Lightning'</br></br>   Sarada: Shannaro! <br><br> Sarada: Boruto, let’s show off how awesome we are! (Literally more like “show off our awesome points” but that sounds weird to me) <br><br> Mitsuki: Please don’t forget about me, too. <br><br> Boruto: By the way, who are your parents? <br><br> Mitsuki: It’s [blanked] <br><br> Boruto: Eh?! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If dubs then we get alternate time line manga/anime spin off.  <br>anime</br>  <br>It got even worse.All the pairings are canon now. Its like some 12 year old kids fanfiction<br><br>Nurutu fags actually defend/like this.</br></br></br>  <br> How about a threesome? </br>  <br>Sounded more like Sarada to me than Boruto.</br>  <br> deviantart </br>  <br>Neji/TenTen isn't canon anon.</br>  <br>Once their dubs got deleted they moved onto more "sophistocated" methods of shitposting.</br>  <br>I want to believe Kishi's word that this is his best work and will transcend Naruto</br>  <br>Are they really making such an issue about Orochimaru Jr's parentage?<br>Come to think of it if he really is Orochimaru's kid it would mean that not only was Orochimaru the only sannin to come out of the main series alive and not a depressed alcoholic wreck, it would also mean he's the only one who actually managed to have children.</br></br>  <br>Neji, you did it!</br>  <br>ill commission you to suck my cock</br>  <br>These threads were always full of deviantart/tumblr shit. Don't blame others for your shitty fanbase. This is the exact fucking reason for why no one wants you people on /a/.</br>  <br> believing Kishi <br>Don't. However, he's assembled a pretty good team for this project, so there might be a chance it's decent. <br><br><br>Truly he got away with everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can someone please post that list with all of Bolt's skills?  <br>He truly won the series.</br>   he throwin them fists   <br>I'll just whip one up on the fly:<br> Shadow Clones  <br> Rasengan <br> Chidori <br> unknown special move (likely combines both) <br> Gentle Fist (w/o Byakugan) <br>He's basically some horrifying combination of Nurudu, Sauce, and Neji.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these redditors/newfags   <br>it could also be that frog martial art</br>  <br> Mitsuki: Please don’t forget about me, too. <br><br>Poor guy, he already knows he's the third wheel.</br></br></br>  <br> clones <br> rasengan <br> lightning element, seem to be something he can throw <br> possibly lightning rasengan <br> judging by the trailer either something similar to frog kata (impact without touching) or gentrle fist as some anons seem to think <br>He's also a prodigy so he might pick up a bunch. We probably won't see it but the lightning stuff could imply Flying Thunder God as his endgame tech.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best part is Hiashi's probably in those stands watching his nephew whip out the Hyuuga tech.<br><br>Still, the fact he knows how to into Gentle Fist basically means the sky's the limit for this kid. If he's got that precise of chakra control then he could probably mold in his lightning nature, and later on nature energy. <br><br>Truly OP as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he already knows he's the third wheel <br>At least he knows his place and acts accordingly. Sakura could never take the fucking hint.</br></br>  <br>So is he wearing Neji's shorts in this picture?</br>  <br>since when did these two interact enough to cause this pairing?</br>   bolt x salad <br> gentle fist <br>Man, I'm starting to actually look forward to this movie. I wish it was getting an English release the way The Last did.</br></br>  <br>Yes. But in all seriousness that's what his necklace is probably supposed to represent.<br><br>Still, it's nice to know that Bort trained with both his mom and dad. Hinata suddenly doesn't feel nearly as useless.</br></br></br>  <br>doujutsu bowl confirmed? fucker own us that since the chunin exams.</br>  <br>It's coming to US theaters on October, so maybe there will an anon brave enough to camrip it like that one Ausie did for The Last.</br>  <br>His name is the Neji part.</br>  <br> I wish it was getting an English release the way The Last did <br>Pretty sure it is. The company that released the English subbed trailer is based out of Australia if I remember correctly.<br><br>The shitposting capital of the world might be able to help us out once again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just wait until he makes babies with Sarada.<br>Their children are going to be gods.</br></br>  <br>Not really. He's not getting Byakugan.</br>  <br>Why do people think it is Gentle Fist he's doing?<br>I mean don't get me wrong, I like that combat style and would prefer it if he did it, but he doesn't do Byakugan.<br>The movement itself most resembles an Air Palm from the Gentle Fist moveset, but the whole point of that move is to have a distance attack.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was just coming to Comicon or something. The Last actually had a limited theater release. I was able to see it about two hours from my house at this hipster theater.</br>  <br> Their children are going to be gods <br>It's been said time and time again that if they have a kid, it'll be Kaguya.<br><br>Well it looks like we'll be seeing Kaguya again, and likely sooner than we think.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, byakugan gets in the way of the eye fucking.<br/></br>  <br> going to the theaters for this shit <br><br>Kill yourself. What is wrong with you?</br></br></br>  <br>they're australian yet they made that abysmal sub filled with lost text and broken english?</br>  <br>The only moves we saw that work like that were<br><br> gentle fist <br> frog-fu <br><br>I doubt he's using frog-fu.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did Kishi confirmed or are you just shilling?</br>  <br>Yeah they're Australian, is that a surprise?</br>  <br><br>No wonder Kishi put so much emphasis on their eyes in the Gaiden and all the promotional material. Jesus.</br></br>  <br> Why do people think it is Gentle Fist <br>Because he's using an open palm?</br></br>  <br> shilling <br><br>Fuck off you dumb nigger.</br></br></br>  <br>Right, because your $9 and 90 minutes are that precious.</br>  <br>Byakugan means white eye.<br><br>And don't you clearly see him fighting without any veins around his eyes?</br></br></br>  <br> The movement itself most resembles an Air Palm from the Gentle Fist moveset, but the whole point of that move is to have a distance attack. <br>That's because it didn't connect. Shikadai got Bort's shadow before it hit his face. <br><br>Wouldn't be surprised if it still results in his defeat because he fucked up his chakra flow or something and escaped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We've seen clips from the climax, and besides, you have to have the white eyes to get the Byakugan in the first place. Bolt or Himawari transforming their eyes like that would change the way the current rules work.</br>  <br>Are open palms exclusive to the Hyuuga/Gentle Fist?</br>  <br>Being on 4chan is already killing me.</br>  <br>You are certainly not from /a/ if you actually go to the theaters just to watch this pile of shit.Fuck off.</br>  <br>I ship it.<br><br> In fanfiction. </br></br></br>  <br> all these mods <br><br> Naruto thread <br> getting righteously blasted from all sides <br> suddenly wild mod appears, deletes all posts shitting on Naruto cause no shitposting <br> warned <br> "The quality of posts is extremely important to this community. Contributors are encouraged to provide high-quality images and informative comments." <br> Meanwhile untouchable every-day-till-you-like-it shit threads <br><br>Go on and ban me for telling the truth, I was about to change IPs anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Frog Kata used Closed fists. Anything that wasn't the gentle fist used closed fists.</br>  <br>Bascially, yeah. And considering his mom is Hyuuga...</br>  <br>Aren't you a hero?<br><br><br>It's Gentle Fist and it's the same style Hinata used, hence the open palms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I could write an essay on the history of Naruto chemo. It's a deep an nuanced subject, but suffice it say, the exact reason isn't because of excessive fan art in the threads.<br><br>For the short version: It all really got started in 2007 during which the American dub aired Part I almost in its entirety. Dubfags started pouring onto the Internet and picked up the manga just in time for Jiriya's death and the Pain Invasion. This caused a wave of newfaggotry, the likes of which have never been seen.<br><br>Then the series went full retard. Mass resurrections, emo terrorists, hyperventilation, the worse to come. Suddenly, the series no longer had any defenders on /a/ and it was officially made a crime to ever say anything positive about the series.</br></br></br></br></br>  Did mods seriously delete posts that are against Naruto?<br><br>That's some /v/ tier moderation right there.</br></br>  <br><br>we still don't know if he can activate it or if by his condition of being a halfbreed he carries a variant that does quite the same but with his blue arya eyes.</br></br>  <br>He has a better chance of getting invited to threesomes instead of existing as a babymaker like Sakura does.</br>  <br>There is a 99% likelihood that he doesn't have it, and just picked up Gentle Fist because his mom's a fucking Hyuuga.</br>  <br>Thats neo-/a/ for you. Full of Nurutu/dragonball retards spamming their shit all over the board while pissing on board culture.</br>  <br><br>The reason everyone is questioning it is because Kishimoto admitted that they don't have Byakugan because he just plain forgot. I'm surprised he actually remembered to incorporate anything from the Hyuga at all.</br></br>   inb4 Shikadai is the only one that gets promoted because he gives up in the middle of his fight   <br>Mods deleting dubspammers<br>Heres your reply</br></br>  <br>A family who lays together stays together.</br>  <br>Even someone like me has enough dignity not to be seen in public going to a naruto movie; people will most likely either think I'm a faggot or a pedophile. Like the extent of my drug use I keep my narutardism in the fucking closest.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I wouldn't jump the gun just yet. I mean sure, it would be neat for him to use his actual heritage and I do like the idea of him having learned stuff from his mother, but Kishi wrote this for one thing, and subsequently Sausage is set up the kid's master for another. <br>Throw in the fact that teasers have previously been baiting with stuff that would be much more interesting than what the film wound up with, and you might just be setting yourselves up for a disappointment.<br>That said I would like it if it was Gentle Fist, or something as close to it as someone with normal eyes can get.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> transforming their eyes like that would change the way the current rules work. <br>this is kishi we are talking about.</br></br>  <br> The reason everyone is questioning it is because Kishimoto admitted that they don't have Byakugan because he just plain forgot <br>He was joking. He just doesn't like the way it looks and thinks it's hard to draw, so he decided not to give it to them.<br><br>But I guess he still liked the Gentle Fist fighting style enough to give it to him. And if he gets Sage Mode then he'll be even better at it than a Hyuuga. Also his slaps will hit with the force of a mack truck turn people into frog statues, so there's that.</br></br></br></br>   actually talking about this shit <br><br>What the hell is wrong with you faggots? Nothing in this series makes sense anyway and that kishimoto faggot doesn't give a shit about it. Not to mention that this Boruto shit is absolutely fucking retarded.<br><br>You faggots are the cancer killing /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I went. It was mostly what you'd expect: 20-30-year-old guys in jeans and dark t-shirts. There was this one woman though, who looked like she was 45, but she was dressed in gothic lolita. It was disgusting.</br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me in the least. Although aliens might interrupt before then.<br><br><br>It's going to premiere at Comic Con, which basically guarantees a camrip by some fat retard in a headband.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wish /a/ would migrate to a site like /v/ did </br>  <br>/a/ board culture is mostly shit anyways. It is impressive that it has delayed the wave of general internet memes so well, and I do think the quality of posts are usually pretty good across the board, but then you have things like Vagabond threads (for new chapters!) getting about 20 replies before they get archived while shit like fairy Tail gets hundreds of responses and images.</br>  <br>Sasuke found a way to Izanagi into Sakura without losing his eyes. That's how Sarada was made.<br><br>That or tapping the forehead of someone you like is the Uchiha form of reproduction. Changes nothing about Itachi in the end.</br></br></br>  <br>Like father, like son. I wouldn't be surprised by this and if I'm being honest, I want it to happen. I'm liking Shikadai so far and his personality is pretty much like that of his father's at the same age so I'm liking him a lot.</br>  <br>Anon, just look at it. It's a Gentle Fist. There's nothing else in the series that looks like that. <br><br><br>Then why are you here?</br></br></br></br>  <br> pf, how lame, when they became adults they started having sex and shit </br>  <br>How many times has the phrase "the cancer killing /a/" been typed, and for how any different series/fan bases?</br>  <br>So is Sauce going to be down with Bort knocking up his daughter or not? On the one hand it means being bros in-law with his husbando and could say that by proxy he fugged the nardo, on the other it means the death of the Uchiha clan in a flash of yellow and blue and Pink Shit's constant whining over feeling old and being related to nardo.</br>  So Mitsuki is probably Orochimaru's child, given their reactions, though that idea really bothers me.<br><br>We'll see I guess.</br></br>  <br> All the pairings are canon now <br><br>Nigga thats kinda what happens when they get older.</br></br></br>  <br> /a/ board culture is mostly shit anyways <br><br>Well, then just fuck off to reddit if you miss spoonfeeding.</br></br></br>  What happen? why there's a lot of post got deleted?  this is a seriouse question   <br>Seriously. It bothers me when people try to act mature and say things like,<br><br> THE SERIES SHOULD HAVE ENDED WITH NO ONE TOGETHER RATHER THAN PANDERING TO SHIPPERS <br><br>Having characters marry and raise children isn't pandering; it's life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's going to premiere at Comic Con <br><br>Comic con ended 9 days ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Pink Shit's constant whining over feeling old and being related to nardo <br> implying he'll ever be around to hear that shit </br></br>  <br>Whatever. It's going to premiere at a con-like event in NYC on October 10th.</br>  <br> implying he'd notice <br>The first time Sasuke will realize that Bolt has a thing for his daughter is when he pulls his sword on his granddaughter.</br></br>   Studio pierrot   <br>If he cared about reviving his clan anymore then he'd stick his dick somewhere more than once or he would have adopted the Shins.<br><br> Pink Shit's constant whining over feeling old and being related to nardo. <br><br>She likes Nardo, though not sexually. As for feeling old she can just do Tsunade's thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How can you be this fucking stupid? The problem is that all of them got together and that their kids are literally just designed by taking half of each parent.. Thats not how it works.<br><br>This is just as dumb as any fanfction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Finding the next cancer killing /a/ IS the cancer killing /a/</br>  <br> quoting the first part of the post only <br><br>/a/ can be a little autistic about it sometimes, but for the most part the anti-spoonfeeding rhetoric works very well in curbing source requests.</br></br></br>   Bort wants to fuck Salad all of a sudden because he saw how she punched that filthy Cloud nigger in the face <br>He is the grandson of Minato and the nephew of Neji, after all.</br>  <br>Seriously, it bothers me that people as dumb as you are allowed on /a/.</br>  <br><br>What did she say to him that made him spill so much ramen?</br></br>  <br>It's not exclusive to Naruto, though. In fact most kids manga/anime do this.</br>  <br> that idea really bothers me. <br>Why? I think it would be great.<br>He not only got away with everything and manages to look young and hot as fuck when he's actually pushing 70, but he also had a kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Except Narutards have always been cancer from the start.</br>  <br> or he would have adopted the Shins. <br>They are not his clansmen, just clones of a guy whose tissue doesn't reject anything, combined with the Coolest Guy's stash of sharingans.</br></br>  <br> All of them got together. <br> None of team guy did. Kakashi still a wizard. Gaara didn't seem to either. Neither did Shino. <br> Kiba doesn't have a kid yet. <br> All. </br></br></br></br>  <br>His existence and reminders of it, while funny, are also reminders as to why this series is pure shit.</br>  <br>Anti-spoonfeeding is great and I wish more boards employed it. Everything else is shit.</br>  <br>Mods need to make this place a hugbox for Naruto faggots, so they deleted any posts against this thread.</br>  <br>  dat tsundere look <br>Also extended trailer when?</br></br>  <br>Nobody wants to see characters get together with a bunch of faceless civilians.</br>  <br>It happen after a war, it´s a duty to have kids to repopulate the land and pass down the family technics. Or do you rather have them filll the village with inmigrants?</br>  <br>Its still retarded.</br>  <br> ramen <br> not burgers <br>It was probably a compliment or something. She's so much more upbeat and up-front with her feelings than the average Uchiha.</br></br></br>  <br> lightning stuff could imply Flying Thunder God as his endgame tech <br><br>would be hilarious to see, but it's simply to broken for both combat and for narrative purposes.<br><br>even naruto doesn't seem to have it, as it would have precluded the gaiden sequence of events from taking more than five minutes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay. Want a medal for your grand discovery?</br>  <br> all of them got together <br>1010 and Shino did not. Kiba is implied to have fucked some catgirl who might as well have been filler. Lee's kid's mother is unknown. Chouji married some black chick that barely made it above faceless mook.</br></br>  <br>Lee got laid and kiba is flirting with cat lady</br>  <br> yfw he's Orochimaru and   Tsunade's  kid</br>  <br>Not wanting retards who spam ''kek ''lel'' and all that shit on here is also great. You should kill yourself.</br>  <br> Also extended trailer when? <br>Soon. There's a picture of Dadruto lightning Hima's cake's candles we haven't seen in a trailer yet.</br></br>  <br> Showing end result of people reproducing is retarded. <br>Okay mister barnacle.</br></br>  <br><br><br> actually defending this fanfiction ending <br><br>I guess this is the reason for why no one wants naruto on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's like poetry. Every stanza rhymes with the last.</br>  <br> Sarada has a better record against lightning niggers than her dad <br><br>Maybe she has a shot of actually becoming hokage</br></br></br>  <br> but it's simply to broken for both combat and for narrative purposes. <br>If he's trying to surpass nardo broken is what he'll have to be. <br><br><br>But the resident memes are just as cancerous, board culture or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying metal isn't adopted. <br><br>I guess Shaman King flowers was fanfiction too. So was DBZ for that matter. Not to mention the FMA ending where we see kids of Ed and Wendy.</br></br></br>  <br> they have their honeymoon at the Cloud village <br> when they leave it's a ghost town </br></br>  <br>why do you sit like that</br>  <br> pointing out that your criticism is factually incorrect is defending the thing you attempted to criticise </br>  <br>Sorry that fictional characters getting laid trigger you since you can´t in real life.</br>  <br>Actually he killed one sand nigger who was also fodder.</br>  <br>You didn't point out anything, though.</br>  <br>Just fuck off back to reddit already you underage faggot.</br>  <br><br>Metal has been explicitely mentioned to be Rock Lee's son.<br><br>The mother is the mystery.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing Sarada inherited from Sakura was her superhuman strength via chakra control.<br><br>And she awakened the Sharingan through happiness at seeing her father.<br><br>Shit she's pretty much her own person with a little Sasuke thrown in.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everyone gets together <br> except these characters, plus these barely count </br></br>  THE PLAN FAILED, THEY SAID<br><br>NO BYAKUGAN, NO KEIKAKU, THEY SAID<br><br>LITTLE NIGGA CAN GENTLE FIST WITHOUT THE WHITE EYES<br><br>EAT YOUR FUCKING WORDS</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was off screen and that guy was out-numbered 4-1.</br>  <br>But isn't Tsunade like 70?<br>She's too old to have a kid.</br></br>  <br> Metal has been explicitely mentioned to be Rock Lee's son <br>Let's just hope he doesn't have a crush on Salad. Gai's a cripple and Lee's a failure. We don't need the next generation to be a cuckold.</br></br>  <br>Wow, did I touch a nerve?</br>  <br> Gentle Fist <br> sudden romantic interest in Salad for maximum keikaku <br>Did Hiashi write this trailer himself?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Metal Lee will chase the Sunflower.</br></br>  <br> Implying Bolt won't be the one cucked. <br>The Uchiha name must go on anon and that won't happen with Bolt.</br></br>  <br>Then he'll have to deal with Bort and Hiashi.</br>   kids are carbon copies of their parents <br><br>why does anime do this</br></br>  <br>Reminder<br> Metal is the son of Rock <br> Rock is the son of Blues <br> Rock Lee's dad is Blues Lee <br> Blues Lee = Burusu Lee = Bruce Lee </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she just got half of her parents each <br> Shit she's pretty much her own person  <br><br><br> cherry picking <br><br>Also, nice how you ignore the rest of my post.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Sauce isn't two seconds from drawing whiskers on his face and saying 'ttebayo <br>The Uchiha are dead, anon.</br></br>  <br>How could that happen since Salad is a girl? Now fucking Sakura is called Sakura Uchiha.</br>  <br>I wasn't dubspamming, I just posted the usual gateway anime thing and my post got deleted</br>  <br>All the Shins will pass on the power of Uchiha through their genes.<br><br>The legacy continues. Now is the time for the chosen family to unite completely by having incarnations o Ashura and Indra fuck!</br></br></br>  <br>Because Naruto is fucking trash, but the kids need to have their fun so the mods make it look like its good.</br>  <br> Sakura Uchiha <br>Madara is spinning in his fucking grave. At least Hinata Uzumaki sounds more fitting since her family never wanted her.</br></br>  <br>Potential Kaguya&gt;&gt;&gt;Uchiha</br>  <br>Thanks for proving that /a/ is right in hating nurutu.</br>   gentle first <br><br>Holy shit, I'm so happy about this. He's not just a Nardo clone after all.</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone need the byakugan to do the air palms?</br>  <br>So getting good chakra control makes her half Sakura?<br><br>Yeah I can see your point. Not much else to Sakura beyond her obsession with Sasuke and her temper.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, you need to prove your worth to get the Sunflower.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that still spamming though?</br>  <br>The Shins are clones who got cloned sharigan transplant eyes. Their special ability is being a universal reciever for organ transplants.</br>  <br> Not much else to Sakura beyond her obsession with Sasuke and her temper <br>And she has her speech pattern.<br><br>Basically Sakura if she wasn't complete shit and a cute girl. So nothing like Sakura at all.</br></br></br></br>  Why are people so happy about Gentle Fist? Because it was underused? Byakugan or Hyuga techs are shit compared to Uchiha ones.  <br>Women can carry on the family name, especially if they're the heir to a great house.</br>  <br>They can use Izanagi to rewrite their genes to those of an Uchiha.</br>  <br> having to deal with an overprotective nii-chan and the godfather of keikaku pushes Metal to unlock the secret 9th Hidden Gate </br>  <br>Uchiha techs don't even make sense.</br>  <br><br>Neither Bolt nor Salad are incarnations of Ashura and Indra.<br><br>But they ARE descendants of the two branches they spawned.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino's kid has her last name and Naruto got her mother's.<br><br>The Uchiha clan would continue if she ends up with anyone from a literally who clan. And considering she's an Uchiha that's pretty much anyone except the Senju and the Uzumaki.<br><br>Still, I really doubt she'd take Bort's last name like Sakura and Hinata did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its not spamming you fucking moron, its him saying that this entry-tier garbage is something people don't want.<br><br>This is modern /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Someone has to carry on the Hyuuga legacy.</br>  <br>Actually Gentle Fist is really damn useful if put in the hands of someone who isn't a complete jobber. <br><br>Shit, does this mean Bort can kaiten too? Lightning kaiten?</br></br></br>  <br>Izanagi just gives you a free life.</br>  Wasn't the Last BD ripped last night?   that fucking hairstyle  <br>Why</br>  <br> I really doubt she'd take Bort's last name like Sakura and Hinata did <br>She doesn't really seem like someone who cares about the clan much. She doesn't even know its history.</br></br>  <br>Just wait until the Bolt sequel reveals that they are.</br>  <br> lightning release kaiten or gentle fist with chidori </br>  <br>Because Bolt using gentle first means he actually inherited something from his mother, not making him up to be Naruto 2.0<br><br>Though now that I think about it Minato also told Naruto that his fighting style greatly resembles Kushina's. That pretty cool.</br></br></br>  <br> ninth gate. <br>Anon pls. We have enough retarded things in this series.</br></br>  <br>he's a poloitician</br>  <br>Yes but someone has yet to torrent it.</br>  <br>Uchiha "techs" are SonictheHedgehog-Deviantart-OC tier retarded, anyone whos not a 10 year old can see that.<br>At least the Hyuuga techs are more grounded and subtle</br></br>  <br>Salad has no clan pride at all. She probably would.</br>  <br>It allows you to alter reality around the user. Everyone just uses it for extra lives.</br>  <br>Well, Sasuke can still create a male heir...</br>  <br> She doesn't even know its history. <br>Its for the best</br></br>  <br>Its because most people in this thread are retarded.</br>  <br>Naruto never cared that much about his clan and he still kept his last name and Bort has got its logo everywhere in his room.</br>  <br> Though now that I think about it Minato also told Naruto that his fighting style greatly resembles Kushina's <br>Shame we never really saw what that was. I suppose he generally meant 'throws chakra around like there's no tomorrow' and 'relies on surprising, occasionally silly attacks'</br></br>  <br><br><br>it's up on BakaBT since 5 hours ago.<br><br>gogogog</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 64 Palms with Chidori <br>Jesus. This kid has crazy potential.</br></br>  How in hell is Bort going to surpass his Nurudu? Naruto and Sasuke have literally reached the pinnacle of shinobi. There's no way he can surpass them unless Nurudu dies and Ashura goes into Bort.<br><br>Also <br> "This is the pinnacle of all my creations " - Kishimoto  <br> still going to be shit <br> mfw this is all Kishi has to offer </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think deeper.<br><br>Eight Trigrams: 64 Lightning Palms</br></br></br>  <br>The Uchiha deserve to live on more than the Uzumaki. All original Uzumaki techniques are lost. Everything they do now is just bastardization by a guy who has an Eternal Power Battery and developed a fighting style around it.</br>  <br><br>True, but they work. Byakugan has been underused and only a few techniques are known, Neji has been hyped in the first part, and was outmatched by the the MCs after the timeskip and died.</br></br>  <br>Naruto was male and Hinata was not Heir to the clan anymore.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off back to reddit already you dumb faggot</br></br>  <br> Because Bolt using gentle first means he actually inherited something from his mother, not making him up to be Naruto 2.0 <br>And it also means we might get to see something in the future like shota Bort training with MILFnata on the porch. <br><br>And seeing a sweaty MILFnata in yoga pants and a tube top does wonders for my erection.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how he looks so much like Hitler.</br>  <br> Uchiha deserving to live on at all. <br>Uchiha apologist please go.</br></br>  <br> Ino's kid has her last name <br>the Ino-Shika-Cho combo is legendary and has been a part of the village for generations. The name carries some weight to it</br></br>  <br> MILFnata <br><br>Please go back to wherever you came from you underage fag.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like they will lose their eyes anon.</br>  <br> The Uchiha deserve to live <br>stopped reading there</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>He wants to stay single.  Since he will never get over Naruto.  And that girl he was arranged marriaged too ran off with her boyfriend/bodyguard.  </br>  <br> At least the Hyuuga techs are more grounded and subtle <br>Not to mention that like the Rasengan they seem like they'd be ripe for experimentation with different elements. <br><br><br> Salad gets to use the same last name as Dadruto <br>So long Uchiha, hello Uzumaki.<br><br><br> and Bort has got its logo everywhere in his room. <br>To be fair so does every Chuunin vest in the village. It's somewhat of a household name.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ino's kid has her last name. <br>That doesn't count as Sai didn't belong to a family. He only had a given name.</br></br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>Sarada is officially ruined.<br><br>And Himawari won't get much screentime.<br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's Sai's last name?</br>  <br>Uchihas couldn't even keep a rock from being defiled by their black great uncle.</br>  <br> How in hell is Bort going to surpass his Nurudu? <br>Flying Thunder God, combined with not being dense as fuck.<br>Hell, if he's such a prodigy and is supposed to end up as someone similar to Sausage (from whom he learns the pseudo-chidory/lighning element) or Jiraiya he could pick up some of that supposedly broken sealing tech that his clan was killed for.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking milfs <br><br>are you a faggot?</br></br></br>  <br>If she's anything like her CC2 incarnation then it means she's a dumb brawler with monstrous chakra. Which suits nardo pretty damn well.</br>  <br>He has no last name. Which is why he took Ino's.</br>  <br>And now he'll job horribly against Momo while Naruto gets saved by his own husbando.</br>  <br> Lightning Air Palm <br> he doesn't even have to physically connect with his Chidori anymore  <br> ionizes the air and basically throws thunder clouds at niggas </br></br></br>  <br> Sarada is officially ruined. <br> implying she wasnt ruined when confirmed Sakura 2.0, retarded "shannaro" included </br></br>  <br> Liking Himawari <br>kek, why? She is basically imouto character, too young, her design is shit.</br></br>  <br><br> &gt;Salad gets to use the same last name as Dadruto <br> So long Uchiha, hello Uzumaki. <br><br>This. IF Boruto and Sarada get together, you can be damn sure her father's last name is gone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That actually sounds like what he does in one of the earlier trailers.</br>  <br>Penis<br><br><br>He'll likely never have the same destructive capabilities as his father, nor will he be as durable or have as much chakra. But he'll probably beat him out in speed and skill.</br></br></br></br>  <br> look i have this epic nickname for hinate lol xD  <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit how new are you?</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br> liking nurutu <br><br>Well, how new are you?</br></br></br>  <br><br> sakurafags beign this mad </br></br>  <br>I'm guessing Naruto has to step out in the middle of Himawari's birthday, leading to the <br>apocakelypse.</br></br>  <br>Because it was interesting and different from Rasengan spam.</br>  <br>I dunno, Kishi loves the Uchiha way too much to kill them off.<br><br>They started the series with everyone except two being dead and ended up as by far the most relevant clan of the series.</br></br></br>  <br> he does this to the wedding cake too </br>  <br>Huh, what a shame. I guess the Hyuuga will take the Uchiha's place as the oldest and most prestigious clan now. Interesting how that worked out.</br>  <br>You know, I'm with Bolt on this one. I'd have hated my dad too, if he were never home growing up.</br>  <br>I'm not a ''sakurafag'', though.</br>  Will Hiashi force Hanabi to marry someone or is she going to die alone like Neji?  <br>Because it means that Bort's fighting style can be different and interesting and that the fact Hinata is his mother actually meant something in the end.<br><br> all those salty NScucks still trying to say that he's Sakura's son <br>They're probably having a bad time right about now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Those two elements were aesthetical as her presonality wasn't really Sakura 2.0.<br><br>But they had to push shipping pandering. Add that she's female and she's automatically ruined.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I doubt Bolt will take her name.</br>  <br>Naruto was home, its just that in the last three years or so he's taken on a huge responsibility which means he can't be home as much as he used to.<br><br>They had a lot of good years growing up, but lately he's distant, and even thought Naruto worries about his son he can't be there for all of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Bort will be cured of his edge by the end of the movie. But Himawari will remember.<br> Fast forward 10 years <br> Bort and Salad's wedding <br> Everything is perfect <br> Naruto set aside his whole day to be there <br> Even Sasuke showed up <br> Suddenly <br> SPLAT <br> "Hima... why?" <br> "Because... you let my cake die." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw this was his plan the entire time <br> he never once acknowledged the Uchiha's prowess because he knew that one day it would belong to him <br>And Boruto is the instrument of his genetic conquest. Guess that's why he was wearing the Hyuuga jumpsuit as a lil babby.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't that be the Uzumaki? All the Hyuuga have left is Hanabi.</br>  <br> And that girl he was arranged marriaged too ran off with her boyfriend/bodyguard. <br>What, really? I could've sworn someone said he adopted kids. Is he a single dad or was I rused?</br></br>  <br>She'll end up with konohamaru.</br>  <br>You were rused. There isn't anything like that in the novel.</br>  this has to be someone of the rgeates archivements of keikakus  <br>Uzumaki's not as old or prestigious as the Hyuuga. They're just refugees from Uzushiogakure.</br>  <br><br>Hanabi is the head clan. Hiashi didn't mind Hinata marrying Naruto since she wasn' the heir anymore.<br><br>She's probably already married with another clan member.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That, and his edge won't even last half the movie. Nardo and him probably smooth things out before the 3rd round of the exams. <br><br>Still, makes me wonder where he got the jacket and headband of pottery if he didn't wear it to his fight with Shikadai. Did he run home and get it before heading out with Sauce and the Kage<br> inb4 Himawari or Hinata brings it to him </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hyuuga already were the oldest clan basically<br><br>Moon bitch had the original Byakugan<br><br>Older brother of the two original brothers had the Super Byakugan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Gaara did adopt.<br><br>But yes the girl he was forced into an arranged marriage with ran off with the man she loved.</br></br></br>  <br>Konohamaru is a jonin squad leader. Those are more likely to become wizards than Hogwarts students.</br>  <br><br>Well, Bolt is not changing his last name, and going by the rest of the females, the chances of Sarada changing her last name are very high.</br></br>  <br>this mini ninja prodigy</br>  <br> MS awakens <br> Uchiha wedding starts </br></br>  <br> If you look closely you can see Hiashi about to cum in his seat </br>  <br> It didn't connect <br>Is Bolt holding back?</br></br>  <br> her presonality wasn't really Sakura 2.0. <br>The fact that she forgive sasuke after all his bullshit makes her sakura 2.0, another doormat for the sauce.<br> But they had to push shipping pandering <br>Bort blushing for 2 seconds is not shipping pandering, we dont know why he's doing it</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shannaro <br>Into the trash it goes</br></br>  Can't wait for some Bort and Hinata interaction. From the stuff we got so far it barely looked like they were mother and son. Same for Nardo and Himawari.  <br><br>I need to see this drawn.</br></br>  <br>The Uzumaki were around during Hashirama's era while the Hyuuga didn't even get invited to Konoha's founding.</br>  <br/>  <br>Shikadai's probably stopped Boruto from giving him brain damage by shadow binding him.</br>  <br><br>Then is useless to ship them.<br><br>Thinking about it, aside of Naruhina to an extent, I don't know why people bother with the shippingfaggotry in this series.<br><br>Almost all the pairings are bad or dysfunctional.<br><br>Is this seriously everything that's left with this series in this fanbase?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's probably already married with another clan member <br> she became the lesbians with Natsu the Hyuuga maid  <br><br><br> Those are more likely to become wizards than Hogwarts students <br>Asuma was a squad leader and a Sarutobi, and he got laid.<br><br>All this means is that Konohamaru would be almost guaranteed to die, conveniently never reaching his dream of becoming Hokage, and leaving Salad to fulfill nardos position.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikadai probably got his shadow. He's using shadow jutsu stand after all.</br>  <br>how is the keikaku really successful if little Mr. Eugenic Jr. there just got BTFO'd by a half sand nigger who's only there so his mom won't slap his shit?<br><br>  shadow binding &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taijutsu </br></br></br>  <br>They were the primary clan of an entire village. If they still existed, they'd be on the same level as the Hyuuga, easily.<br><br>Don't forget the First's wife was a ginger.</br></br></br>  <br> Sage Mode Gentle Fist Himawari vs. Susano'o Sarada <br> Village is destroyed again </br></br>  <br>only this left and there is no asspull sarada could make to do something against bolt, shit he probably in reality could surpass nardo<br><br> hiashi was masturbating all the fight </br></br></br>  <br><br>It wasn't funny the other times you posted this and it's not funny now.<br><br>Go back to fanfiction.net.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That annoyed me too, but beyond that, Salad is nothing like Sakura.</br>  <br> gets to be daughter in-law to based Dadruto <br> gets his last name <br> gets to fuck his clone <br>The deal is far too sweet for her to pass up. Sakura will probably be immeasurably butthurt though. She cares more for that name than anyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet they weren't invited cause they thought the Uchihas needed to be exterminated.<br><br>Tobirama is the exception because he's Hashiramas brother.</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/h8pyki2n_S0?t=5  [ ]<br><br>Hanabi is the best Hyuga<br><br>cow tits can fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not going to happen.<br><br>All of the Sanin Team Leaders have become Hokage.<br>Hiruzen and Kakashi.<br>Kishi loves pottery.<br>Naruto will probably eventually give up the title to him but Konohamaru is probably going to die as Hokage and Naruto will then have to take the role again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If they still existed <br>Funny thing about that.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Shikadai got his shadow, but enough of it connected to disrupt his chakra flow long enough for Bort to escape. Watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you need like a thousand byakugans to get that?</br>  So what's subbing naruto anymore? Hatsuyuki and wcp are dead, is horriblesubs the only option?  <br><br>Konohamaru will be a Wizard. And the next Hokage will be an Uchiha.<br><br>Mirai will be the one to carry on the Sarutobi name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except the movie isn't out yet. You don't know the conclusion to their battle.</br>  <br> aside of Naruhina <br>You are a shipperfag just like them so fuck off. I didn't care about any pairing but Shikamaru X Temari.</br></br>  <br> watching the anime </br>  <br>Toneri's Tenseigan was made just by taking Hanabi's eyes. The other Tenseigan, the weapon, is made by thousands of Byakugans.</br>    <br>Damn she sounds cute.</br>  <br> implying Sarada still wants dadruto <br><br>He's not the one she looks at while sucking on a phallic object.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dattebayo or [DB] still subs. <br><br>Although you have to be in their super secret club to get it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes you have to watch crunchy rips.</br>  <br> We did it, Neji <br> We did it after all. </br></br>  <br>Honestly their entire family seems close with the exception of nardo and bordo, but that'll change.</br>  <br>Looks like she is looking at popcorn. Salad x Popcorn confirmed.</br>  WHERE'S THE FUCKING TORRENT FOR THE LAST  <br><br>Sasuke does care for the name as well.<br><br>He let Sakura to plaster their symbol everywhere after all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no there are two ways, one thousands of byakugans or have the blood of hamura and the eyes of a woman of the main cranch of hyuga similar to rinnegan<br><br>but hinata is the transmigrant of hamura and naruto is from the one of the son of hagoromo, this kid was spawned with a super byakugan and some kind of prodigy body is only narutal to archive tenseigan</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>bakabt you mongrol</br></br></br>  <br>Konohamaru will become Hokage after Salad then. It's the only way for the YinYang and Sannin Leader pottery to work.</br>  <br>But he doesn't have any sort of byakugan.</br>  <br>I like how sauske isn't even looking at her</br>  <br> likes shikatema <br> calls other shipperfags <br>Anon, are you alright?</br></br></br>  <br>She wants to be Hokage because Naruto is Hokage and he made her happy.<br><br>She clearly needs a threesome doujin with Sasuke and Naruto.</br></br></br>  What was the point in Azusa, /a/?<br><br>It's like she was just added in to keep the cuteness factor alive. We already had the shy, easily embarrassed character who took stuff seriously, with Mio. Why copy and paste the same personality with minor differences?<br>I didn't hate her or anything, but idk what people saw in her.</br></br></br>  She took over the Fun Police role from Mio so Mio could be a fun character instead of just a huge nag.  Sheldon's dad works at KyoAni  I always thought Azusa was Mio's little sister  They needed someone with twintails.  <br>Azusa took things more seriously than Mio ever did. Also her tsundere relationship with Yui was adorable. Plus since she was a year younger it gave us a different perspective on things and gave us more Ui. Not to mention if she wasn't around the lat episode and movie would have been way worse instead of heartwrenchingly amazing.<br><br>Azusa is probably my least favorite keion but to suggest she was useless is fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  She was there to be the greatest, a gift from the heavens  I felt like Azusa's character was all about making the girls grow as a band, if she wasn't there everything would be about eating cake and the music part would be an extra addition.   gave us more Ui <br> more Ui <br><br>implying that Ui has a personality and is in any way interesting</br></br></br>  <br>She is an angel sent from the heavens to salvage an okay SoL into a masterpiece<br><br>Also I am going to marry her</br></br></br>  <br>She's no Ritsu, though</br>  <br>Yes that's one reason why she is the best girl</br>  <br> extra addition <br>but yeah, I agree.</br></br>  <br>Keion is a masterpiece because it is a masterpiece and not because of Azunyan and without Azunyan there would be no keion</br>  Azusa is the obligatory loli  <br>Season 1 wasn't that great though<br>Azusa is what brings the story and characters together in such a perfect way</br></br>  <br>Is Ritsu a loli too then</br>  <br>Season one is fantastic and is what helps set K-On! apart from other SOL moeshit.<br><br>It's moderately fast paced and condenses two years of school, development and introductions into 13 episodes. So then you get the beautiful slow burn of the god tier second season feeling like you already know these characters and are attached to them since you've already been with them for years. Other SOL shows are too slow from the start so you have a harder time giving a shit.<br><br>Well that's how it was for me at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I should have been more clear, season 1 isn't that great relative to the rest of K-ON. Compared to other SoL it is still outstanding<br><br>KyoAni improved over the course of the series, ending with the film which is a masterpiece in its own right</br></br></br>  <br>You hit the nail on the head<br><br>I don't really like otaku SoL often but Keion is just incredibly dope all around</br></br></br>  <br> What was the point in Azusa <br>Cat jokes and token loli.</br></br>  <br>Mugi fills the meme girl criteria already</br>  <br>Yes but not the flat chested, twintails loli niche.</br>  <br> flat chested, twintails <br> niche </br></br>  <br>Niche isn't the right word but it seems to be a requirement for KyoAni shows.</br>  <br>It should be a requirement for all shows<br>If you don't like twintails and DFC you can get out of my face lad</br></br>  <br>Never said I didn't like twintails and DFC.</br>  <br>You implied that she wasn't essential to the show</br>  <br>I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much without her. I consider essential for my enjoyment.</br>  <br>I think she contributes a bit more to the show than "Cat jokes and token loli"</br>  <br>Mio folded, Azusa did not. She was way stricter than Mio.</br>  <br>The band wouldn't have survived without her</br>  They needed an additional, new member for the club as the semesters rolled by. If you have all characters as freshmen from the start of the show and plan to keep it all the way to graduation, you kind of need new characters for a bit of realism and making new things interesting.<br><br>Yes, Azusa was a terrible choice.</br></br>  <br> Yes, Azusa was a terrible choice. <br>How so</br></br>  So... should I post photos from my excursion to the K-On school in Toyosato? Place was way out in the countryside of Kansai.  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Dump 'em</br>  <br>Because the similarity between her and Mio makes her a totally unnecessary character and you could have added much more interesting character.<br><br>Azusa basically takes Mio's job, i.e, being the tsukkomi, the person trying to get the club's act together, the girl getting bullied, the small doses of tsun both characters have. Frankly, everything good you can say about Azusa, such as said in <br>can be had by any other character while also having other unique traits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it worth seeing?</br>  <br><br>Hallways have the exact same feel and look as K-On. The doors even have those dotted lines to show where the door will open to that the show details. I went on a weekday and at an early time so I had the place to myself for a good hour or two before some Chinese tourists showed up as they invariably do.</br></br>  <br>p o o r m a n ' s m i o</br>  <br>It was worth as a day trip out of Kyoto. You have to remember it takes around four hours round trip just to get there. One of my better sightseeing days and I hate to say it but I was much more excited to see the school than most of the historical sites in Kyoto.</br>  Why couldn't he protect her smile?<br> This got really depressing REALLY fast. </br>  <br>So am I the only person who isn't watching this because the MC is a trap?<br><br>Am I the only straight person watching this.<br><br> Traps are fucking horrible and so are the people who like them. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Nyw<wbr>48mA-chQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>Thread theme</br></br>  Can we agree the biggest kicker about the last episode was the promise he made her?<br><br>Nothing kills me more then not being able to keep a promise.</br></br>  <br>Alternatively<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Y9d<wbr>72n2fX6g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Just another dick in the wall</br>  <br>People who use the spoiler function as an epic surprise box are horrible.

It's written as pathetic and vile and to whatever extent he as a character is hating himself for it, the author is clearly hating him even more, and the audience too for demanding it. It's harder for this kind of deconstruction to come across in animation at all, even though Shaft really does convey a lot more than you might expect would be possible from the books. With this stuff, and in general all the meta commentary on the industry/audience/author relationship that's mainly out from in Hachikuji and Ougi's stories, it seems like Shaft just doesn't get it, or doesn't think the audience would get it, or something. The next season is Ougi focused, so maybe they'll finally come around on this stuff. And they could even do it in ways that make clearer what the books were trying to say in these Hatchikuji interactions the whole time, depending on what all they include from the book.</br>  <br> It's written as pathetic and vile and to whatever extent he as a character is hating himself for it, the author is clearly hating him even more, and the audience too for demanding it <br>Top tier bullshitting right there, moralfag.</br></br>  <br>What do you think Nisio was trying to say about the Araragi and Hachikuji interactions?</br>  <br>Pro tip   we can't  </br>  <br>It was alright.</br>  https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_In<wbr>dex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_4</wbr></wbr>  <br><br>I feel Touma is boring for the last 20 volumes. With few good moments here and there.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, yes, PTSD Touma is boring as fuck but you can see more of his flaws in his current self.</br>  <br>Touma always keikaku science man. but in his previous battle he never keep running away like this.</br>   Touma with Kakine <br>The entire city slowly gets destroyed and replaced with dark matter as they fight High Priest.<br> Touma with Accelerator <br>Increasingly ridiculous amounts of fire power until they eventually just chuck High Priest into space, like they did here.<br> Touma with Gunha <br>Just try every way of punching him. Invent entirely new ways of punching.</br></br></br></br></br>  What if the entire series is really Touma's keikaku?  Is Karera dead?  <br>He looks like a fucking chimpanzee or something.<br><br>To be honest though, that's probably my favorite image of Iggy. He actually looks something like a dog and not some sort of miniature puppet demon thing like he usually does.</br></br></br>  <br>The villain side looks a lot better than the protag side. Really only Dio looks kinda shitty, which can somewhat be attributed to how far away he is.</br>  <br>Straize didn't seem to lose himself at all.<br><br>Besides, it is Araki. Even if he explicitly said at some point that the mask turns people evil, he could ignore it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, look at Narancia's right foot and Abbachio's legs.</br></br>  <br>Pucci looks autistic.</br>  What servants outside of Emiya, Cu, Heracles and Arturia have a chance to defeat Dr Gil?  Smexy.  <br>He had the Gate primed with a number of weapons with hazardous abilities. He wasn't firing it carelessly, but he was obviously still using GoB.</br>  <br> part of Gil <br>No, it's his treasure. Your wallet is not part of you. His treasure is not powered by him.</br></br>  Does anyone have that picture thats a guide for how to go through the fate series? I saw it once and meant to save it, but I didn't. At least where do I go once I finish all three routes in Fate/Stay Night?  <br>The key is not a weapon, Lancelot would not be able to use it</br></blockquote>]
