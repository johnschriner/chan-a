Here's the page everyone been waiting for.  <br>Good<br>Post inucurry shaft angle devil homu</br></br>  <br>Haven't ripped apart the second book yet. Let me see if I can get an acceptable scan for that page.</br>  <br>Pre-Rebellion Homu, Demon Homu a shit.</br>  <br>Why is devil homu always so smug?</br>  <br><br>There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.<br><br> I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Homu thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" lesbian magical girl, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a mahou shoujo movie. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Homufag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "HOMURA DID NOTHING WRONG." You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she won the universe. Smugdoka btfo</br>    <br>Best I can do for today.</br>  What's your favorite homu weapon?<br><br>Mine is sniping homu</br></br>  <br>here you go.<br><br>I personally like desert eagle or other hand gun homu.</br></br></br>    best girl  best legs  Here're rough scans of Homura's pages in Rebellion PN. Don't bother saving them. I'll have better scans up over the weekend.        <br>Beautiful</br>                      Would you violently dismember Kyoko if meant you could hug Homu?    <br>Im glad we got to see moemura again in rebellion. One of the things i really like was seeing the transition, starting from the clumsy moemura, and ending with the fucking devil. Rebellion may be either loved or hated, but i personally feel it was great. The Madoka series was great, fuck what /a/ says. However, I really see it as more of homura's story, or rather i like seeing it more from her perspective. In the end it is all about a girl trapped in the fucked up labyrinth called reality. The fact that she does the opposite from what the audience and the other magicas may have wanted makes me like her character more. She saw a chance to not only break free but now be the one making the rules.   homura did nothing wrong  </br>  <br>Yes. If Homu wants me to do it.</br>    <br>This homu.</br>  All this art and not even one homu smile. No wonder it is a miracle of the universe. It is so fucking rare to begin with  <br>Not homu.</br>  <br>Fuck spoke too soon</br>    <br>tomato flavored homu</br>    Kyou~ko~chan!  mami tomoe      <br><br>Non-homus not allowed</br></br>  This is the last Homura design page.  <br>We Kyouko now.</br>  <br>holy fucking smug, step it upp smugdoka</br>  <br>I'd watch a full season of smug homu playing petty pranks.</br>  <br>Eternal Queen of /a/</br>  <br>fact</br>  <br>I am all homu'd out now. Thanks</br>  who HOMU here?  <br>Nah, she smiles plenty.<br>Someone post that image that shows shots of Homu smiling.</br></br>  <br>ready to homuhomu here all night<br><br>but compared to the other magicas it is much less seen. Which makes it a lot more special when she does smile.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128240362 <br><br>MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised how quickly you found that.</br>  <br>Meant for: </br>  <br>What's EMT</br>  <br>Is /a/ glitching again?

Some people who'd watched Zero remarked on how Ufotable for some reason had done away with noses in UBW, and started making rhino jokes about the character models. So I'm pretty sure he's not defending the show.</br>  <br>You couldn't have worse taste if you tried, holy shit.</br>     imblyign   <br>Totoro was shit<br><br>SHIT</br></br></br>  <br>FLCL is one of my favourite shows, and I definitely like it more than the GitS and CB movies, so I'm trying to be objective.<br>Even if FLCL had great animation, it wasn't on par.

GITS is great too of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, maybe not godawful.<br>But godawful compared to how good some people think it is, and to the budget.</br></br>  <br> nostalgiafagging this hard <br>Just compare it to other anime movies in the last 10 years you idiot and you'll find something better at least aesthetically. <br><br><br> SnK <br> NGNL <br> God Eater <br> F/Z <br>Are you even trying?<br><br>Bakemonogatari uses so many shortcuts and cheap shit, not to mention while it was airing it looked really mediocre and bad at points. I love the show but you can't be this silly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Certainly one of my favourites.</br>  <br> replying to bait </br>  <br>sorry you cna't handle MANIME instead of boring pretentious shit</br>  <br> he doesn't watch BDs <br>Pleb.</br></br>  <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.<br><br>Or you're illiterate. <br><br><br>I've watched the BDs anon and they're nice looking, but don't compare to something of movie quality like GiTS</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you meant MANCHILDIME</br>  <br> kyoanus fag false flagging </br>  <br> he thinks there are more pixels because it's a movie <br>You seem lost, little buddy.</br></br>  <br>Higher bitrates</br>  <br>The movie was shit but Steamboy is the most visually appealing anime movie.</br>    <br> shilling <br>Daiz, please go and stay go.</br></br>  <br>No, the animation and artwork really is quite good for the most part. Suble things like the snow falling on the mountain road and the fluttering of Caster`s robes were well done too. You might not like the kewl flashing and the designs, I prefer Zero in this regard as well, but that's a stylistic choice and not indicative of animation quality. <br><br>Anyway, some more aesthetic anime<br><br> Tekkon Kinkreet <br> Paprika <br> Patlabor <br><br>I also really liked the clean look of the new HxH, though some people prefer the grittiness of the original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more pixels <br>When the fuck did say that?<br>Movies in general look better than TV anime, especially something like GiTS because of better scheduling and budget</br></br></br>  <br>However you spin it, the GitS budget was big. Bigger than any anime series anon.<br>And sure GitS might be the most consistently great animation in a movie but goddamn the Asuka fight scene in EoE was the best thing I've ever saw.</br></br>  I doubt anyone ITT is knowledgeable enough to accurately judge what the "objectively" best looking anime is in terms of technical merits in solid drawing, motion, etc. Beyond that, "the best" is very opinion-based.<br><br>FLCL is the best-looking thing I've seen because it perfectly summarizes everything I like about anime visuals but that's not even close to being "objective".<br><br>Wakfu doesn't look bad or anything but it absolutely does not belong in a list with GITS, Redline, Animatrix and Dead Leaves in it. Some of the motion-tweening looks lazy as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude most Shaft anime look cheap as fuck.</br>  <br>If we're being honest about personal preferences I still think highly of the Dissapperance movie.</br>  <br>Are you saying this because it actually has your personal favorite anime aesthetics ever?</br>  <br> Wakfu doesn't look bad <br>Top kek.<br> shitty blur <br> ugly character models and animation <br> terrible animation especially in fight scenes <br>Only frenchaboos think that shit looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly didn't like it but everything was so clean and cut clear. The animation "felt" great. For me Steamboy is the benchmark of Japanimation.</br>  <br>There's no point in trying to be "objective" unless you're a honest-to-god no-irony "animation expert". But even then, I could ask how important perfect or near-perfect technique is to begin with given that only a minuscule minority will acknowledge it. You can be the most technically amazing artist in the world and yet draw things that do not resonate emotionally with people on any level beyond a cold "this person draws and animates well" reaction. <br><br>There are likely people on /ic/ who have more in-depth knowledge of anatomy than a lot of world-famous manga artists whose styles gave joy to millions of people.</br></br></br>  <br>Assuming that we're disregarding Miyazaki and co. for fairness' sake, I think Nichijou comes pretty close, albeit from a much different direction. Honneaise, Samurai X, Memories and Texhnolyze are also close contenders IMO.</br>  <br> Movies in general look better than TV anime <br>Subjective. Both have the same amount of pixels.<br><br> better scheduling and budget <br>By this logic, the biggest selling shows have the biggest budget. Which in turn, you would be calling shows like Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball objectively better. Some shit taste you have there, little buddy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Nichijou takes the cake for TV series hands down.</br>  <br>Yeah, most people don't really seem to appreciate how incredible it actually looked.</br>  <br> movies are alotted larger budgets and generally have less time constraints than weekly shows, meaning there's more room for creative freedom <br> somehow this means that popular shows have the biggest budget <br> somehow this means he likes Naruto <br><br>Not him, but you're a fucking idiot. And for the record, Gaara vs. Rock Lee is 10x better animated than anything in Bakemonogatari.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "but doing over the top animation is way more forgiving when it comes to quality" <br>Good over-the-top animation requires just as much skill as good realistic animation. Here's some realtalk from 80s Miyazaki, back when he was a grumpy and critical but passionate guy and not a self-righteous old man trying to fake "sagely knowledge" by being an asshole:<br><br> "Very few animators have a firm grasp of how weight, momentum and acceleration affect the properties of objects, and are able to instinctively visualize in their heads how a movement might play out in space. Even fewer are able to not only do this, but go beyond logic, integrating physics with instinct to create animation that can't be explained but that simply works in the eyes of the viewers. The ability to create animation that works comes from first achieving mastery of how the laws of physics such as weight and momentum work, and then going beyond those rules - saying to yourself, "Drawing it this way would feel better", and drawing it based on that feeling. It's a mistake to think that his style can be mimicked simply by surface imitation of his crazy poses and rough drawings. <br><br> Gatchaman, for example - sorry to name names - certainly impressed with its various innovations, but in terms of the movement turned out to be a classic example of how, no matter how many quick movements or cuts you might string together, the movement simply doesn't feel good or even convincing if it completely ignores the laws of physics." <br><br>Read the full thing here http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index<wbr>.php/miyazaki_on_kanada</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being completely wrong on everything, the post. <br><br> quality depends on the amount of pixels <br>Plainly retarded. Go watch a 10hour long 4k video of an anus an tell me it looks better than anything.<br><br> nurutu and onepiss have major budget <br>We're talking about the ratio budget:lenght, of course the overall budget is meaningless, it's the amount of budget per second.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because most people in this kind of threads only appreciate "realistic" anime with any kind of semblance to actual human anatomy.<br>Nichijou went with the manga art and it really deserves a mention.</br></br>  <br> biggest selling shows <br> Naruto, One Piece and Dragon Ball  <br><br>Confirmed for not knowing what the fuck you're talking about. Those shows don't sell shit as a TV series. Only their manga does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bakemonogatari has its "money shot' scenes too, but Norio Matsumoto's Naruto season 1 stuff really was amazing even if the show looks like trash most of the time.<br><br>I prefer his Naruto vs Sasuke fight but Gaara vs. Rock Lee was still great http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/80<wbr>26/animated-effects-fighting-naruto<wbr>-naruto_-2002-nori<br><br>Ironically this was the point when I stopped watching the show and decided to only pay attention to the occasional well-animated fight.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>So if the people behind any seasonal anime with shit budget made an 8k native anime it would look better than GitS? Talk about going full retard.<br><br>And anon movies have huge budget and no time constraints that's why they look better than anime made week in week out. Steamboy took 10 years to produce. Eva 3.0 was cut in 2 parts and the second part is taking more than 4 years already. These kinds of budgets and schedules make better looking stuff generally.</br></br></br>  <br> Eva 3.0 was cut in 2 parts and the second part is taking more than 4 years already <br>Too bad the Rebuild films look like shit.</br></br>  <br>I mean, this is definitely a good scene despite the shitty CG.</br>  <br>You know Bakemono had budget and production issues to the brim right? And when people praise it it's not for animation quality. It's the visual direction of Shinbou that people praise.</br>  <br>The anime parts look great anon. The movement and the weights feel realistic. Only CG looks bad and that's because Japan can't into decent looking CG.</br>  <br><br>It was the first really good animated Japanese movie that I watched, so I think it holds a special place in my heart. The art direction, animation, story, character design and music may not be the absolute best in the field, but they all blend together to create what I consider a 10/10 movie.</br></br>  <br>The art direction still feels plastic and artificial compared to FLCL which came out in the early 2000s in the era where most people had no fucking idea how to color digitally</br>  <br>First time actually hearing the dub. For something that is supposedly a highly praised dub, I can't really tell why it gets that high praise.<br>I take its just another case of dub fag nostaliga then.</br></br>  <br>Reading is must be extremely hard since your post has nothing to do with what was being discussed. Kindly, kill youself.<br><br><br> ratio budget:lenght <br>That was literally my point in my previous post and you just confirmed it. Thank you.<br><br><br>Again, no fucking idea what is going on and you reply because you were triggered by those shows. Try reading again, then kill yourself.<br><br><br> make better looking stuff generally <br>Subjective. The same amount of time and energy is put into the 800+ episode shows as well as your movies. The same amount of pixels exist. They are no different as the other anon above kindly backed me up on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you didn't understand the guy you replied to implied budget/length ratio you have some serious autism.</br>  <br>I don't get what are you on about anon? The EVAs always looked artificial. If you're talking about the characters then I'm doubting your vision because they really look great.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zIA<wbr>6ix0HpYU</wbr>  [ ] First 4 minutes, you can skip the rest.<br><br>I could never get myself to sit down and watch the whole movie as it seems to be pretty boring, and I have no idea how Katsuhiro Otomo managed to design such bland Captain Planet-ass characters when he can clearly do far, far better.<br><br>-BUT- <br><br>This scene on its own is absolutely fucking fantastic and Kanada's fire dragon is one of the best examples of creative anime visuals. It shows that the "best" scenes don't necessarily have to be the ones with the most "correct" animation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do you turds think budget is everything? Scheduling and a good staff are way more important. Gundam seed destiny had a huge budget, but it looks like garbage. Kyoani has small budgets, but good scheduling.

I feel jealous of secondaries. They get to discover how great Karen and Nao are for the first time.  <br>Does Nao get bullied a lot?</br>  <br>She gets love just as much so it cancels out.</br>  <br>That's really cute.</br>  <br>Sure, she is in highschool and still watches kiddy cartoons<br>Her hair looks like shit<br>Not very good personality too<br>I bet people beat shit from her to reveal stress and rape her in free time</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they enjoy watching her cry. They take a perverse joy in watching her suffer.</br>  <br><br>That's, uh, not as cute. At all.</br></br>  <br> and then there's this faggot <br>There always has to be that one guy who just pushes it a little too far.</br></br>  <br>She would look so much better if she didn't wear straight bangs, had less bushy eyebrows and didn't scowl like a bitch all the time.</br>  <br> wanting Nao to be a generic anime waifu <br><br>You do not know that her brows are love. I bet you want her to shave down there too.</br></br></br>  <br>For all we know she's conscious of it and already does.<br><br>And she's already a generic anime waifu, I would just prefer if she was an attractive generic anime waifu</br></br></br>  <br>She's already attractive.</br>  <br> this is considered generic <br>we must have differing interpretations of generic then. I personally love her eyebrows and fluffy features added into her already trigger sensitive personality. She is like a little fluffy bundle of joy that needs a good dose of vitamin love.</br></br>  <br>This would be amazing.

Gotta sleep sometime, anon</br>  <br> wacky adventures of NG, featuring all sorts of CG cameos in every episode <br> Implying that's a good thing <br>They started off good, then fucked it up by episode 2</br></br></br>  <br> not to mention /@/ is full of CG which doesn't happen ever. <br>It's like a 40/35/25 split with ML/765/CG</br></br>  <br>Now THIS is a mystery that needs to be solved!</br>   Want to be rock idol <br> doesn't know rock idols <br> doesn't even know rock <br>A shit</br></br></br>   Literally only 1 line of dialogue the entire episode <br>15 Weeks.<br>15 Fucking weeks.</br></br>  <br>Why did they fuck up though? First half of Episode 2 was good. Usamin being Usamin, Sae/Miho cameos, delicious KWSM and plenty of unvoiced cameos like New Wave and Natsuki. Then they decided to introduce entire Project in few minutes which is what in my opinion ruined it. <br><br>Now don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the Project girls, in fact I like them much more than NG and I'm loving the anime original units such as LL and Asterisk, but I'm just saying that it might've been better idea not to put focus on 14 girls, because unlike 765, 346 has almost two hundred idols.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate tiny hats</br>  <br>No you don't.<br><br><br>I'm sure we will get a whole episode about the hooker and Minami. I'm sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They fucked up by keeping the others as "cameos" and using NG in their stead because "Muh vehicle characters", they could have easily given the others more prominent roles early on by simply replacing NG with those Non-CP idols, guiding them instead of causing trouble.<br><br>The 3 episode introduction arc was even more of a fuck up for the same reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin's got more than enough moments already, I'm talking about an episode with Anya and Minami.</br>  I'm scared of Mayu.  <br>I hate you<br><br><br>Right now we have the half-assed mixture of both. Whether it's wacky adventures of NG or anime that decides to focus on entire Project and REALLY means it, either way the outcome would've been better than what A-1 has actually done.<br><br><br>Mayu is a good girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When I said "started off good", I meant they had the right idea to make the anime "focus"  HAH  on 14 girls, the fucked up bit was like  said, make NG vehicle characters, now I'm not saying it because it's NG, I'm saying it because they're vehicle characters, and with a cast line as big as CG, that is the worst possible thing to do as it leaves unfair attention distribution and hints of favoritism.</br>  <br>Ultimate cool team</br>  <br>Literally worse than Hitler.</br>  <br> hints of favoritism. <br> In CG <br>Surely you jest.</br></br></br>  Meanwhile, at the 10th live..  <br>Is that the venue?</br>  <br> you will never be there </br>  I have a new favorite.  New units will be exciting and all but I can't help but think about dookie's smile being shattered.<br><br>She will put on a strong front and encourage everybody about being excited for a new direction but deep inside...</br></br>  <br>Jesus, is that bigger?</br>  <br>I've waited so long to hear her voice. So fucking long. I really think that if A-1 is gonna give out free voices to idols, they should focus on somewhat popular ones like Karin instead of literally whos like Aki.</br>  <br>Yeah you would, you fucking slut.</br>  <br> Im@s confirmed for PS4 at 10th <br>My dick.</br></br>  <br>No way is that real, I know Japan loves Idol but that shit is out of control Jesus.<br><br><br>How many is in that, 150k?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seibu Dome.<br><br>Capacity: 34,000-37,000 people. And obviously, tickets sold out.</br></br></br>  <br>They even rented out the lawn.</br>  <br> 34-37k <br>Huh, that's not really THAT big. Didn't they have bigger live before or am I mistaking it for other nip franchise?</br></br>  <br>I imagine they're pushing the limit.<br><br>With the extra seats rolled out, they probably broke 40,000+ attendees here.</br></br></br>  <br>Stadium events always look a lot bigger than they actually are.</br>  <br><br>40,000 or so is already plenty big.<br><br>For reference, the average SuperBowl reels in 60,000+ capacity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Taiko Vita game and Idolmaster-Tekken collab. Harada, you fuck.</br>  <br> Idolmaster-Tekken collab <br>Wait, really?</br></br>  <br>Yes really. Apparently it looks laughably weird.</br>  <br>Is it DOA-collad level where the Tekken girls gets iM@S costumes?</br>  <br>It sounds pretty fucking weird. How the fuck is that even supposed to work? The games are entirely different.<br>No, wait, the important question is if we'll be able to make Kazuya sing songs.</br></br>  <br>It's Tekken 7 DLC so probably costumes.</br>  <br><br>Is that guy the final boss?</br></br>  <br> they should focus on somewhat popular ones  <br><br><br> like Karin </br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Tekken now returns the favor, huh.</br>  <br> Tekken OFA DLC </br>  <br>We can all learn from Harada.</br>  <br>Don't you remember that one poll when anime started airing?

This is definitely the work of LN readers though. I doubt animeonlyfags are interested enough at this point.</br></br>  <br>I-I don't get it.</br>  <br>i just marathoned the first 2 episodes, any other similar cartoons to this one?</br>  Would you want a blowjob from a mouth like this?  <br>I'd take a blowjob from a vacuum cleaner bud</br>  <br>Anime only shitter here, It's okay but like the Anon said above it's not really clear what the story is so far or how it's going to progress. <br><br><br>Maybe if these people attack the Bone King and the NPC engage in battle it'll be good and interesting.</br></br></br></br>  I want to see this entire thing animated.  <br> MMO shenanigans flashback <br>Not sure if like..</br></br>  Ainz-samaaaa  <br>What, you don't want to see how Momonga met Touch Me?<br>Heresy.</br></br>  <br><br>I generaly dislike huge power gaps but this LN is so damn fun.</br></br>  <br>Going by the pacing, MAYBE at the end of episode 4 it will show where the series is going. That depends on if they actually add the scene.</br>  <br>What makes it better was that she caught it from the back of the sword.</br>  <br>I wonder how Brain would feel if he saw the Takemikazuchi Mark 8? Would he experience temporary insanity like the mage guild boss?</br>  <br>Ever since Akuma no Riddle these sort of evil expressions turn me on.</br>  <br><br>The best part of this is trying to imagine his face. I doesn't even have to be Takemikazuchi, Cocytus would suffice.</br></br>  <br>I love the coloring in akuma no riddle, the art director are doing a great job.</br>  <br>Well I mean just the weapon. He was already jizzing over obtaining a normal Katana.</br>  Animefag here, i kind of dislike how the series is thus far. To be precise, i dislike the relationship between Mr. Skeltal and the NPCs. The fact that theyre all getting wet just from him speaking to them, not to mention always assuming that everything he does is according to some masterful keikaku of his and not just him wanting to take a fucking walk. <br><br>If they actually added some diversity, as in there are NPCs who dislike Bones but still respect him, NPCs who are neutral, those who dont see him as an authoritive figure. Albedo could have been protective of Bones and actually make an effort to keep the other NPCs in check while treating Bones as if he were a child (Momonga-sama, please dont be bothered bla bla, i shall take care of everything blabla).<br><br>Im just giving examples, im sure you get the gist.<br><br>TL;DR: this looks like shitty wish-fufillment thus far, can LNfags tell me if it gets any better regarding character interaction?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your opinion is duly noted. Perhaps a show like K-On is more to your liking?</br>  <br>Is it really wish-fulfillment when Bones' only wish is to be left alone?<br>If he didn't have the whole Nazarick transferred with him, he would have become an undead explorer.<br><br>The miscommunication between the NPCs thinking their guild master is some genius, while he's actually "just a salaryman", is  fun .<br><br> Sorry for buzzword abuse </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> evil overlord has minions <br> said minions dont like him and dont listen to orders <br> said minions arent loyal at all and wouldnt jump off a cliff if told to <br><br>No anon, you're just fucking retarded. What you're asking for doesn't make any sense, unless someone put that shit in as flavour text. The penguin does have said text, but he is still loyal as fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437200144578.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437200144578<wbr>.webm</wbr></a>  <br>Its silly how badly she btfo of Brain, when she told him to "use Martial skills already" after using his super trumpcard "god slash" i felt kinda bad for him. Then again seeing him them run away like a bitch was hilarious.</br>  <br>The fact that the women all immediately wanted to jump his literal and figurative bones did kinda reek of wish fulfillment bullshit. <br><br>Them being loyal wasn't the issue for me.</br></br></br>  <br> Then again seeing him them run away like a bitch was hilarious. <br>I ain't even mad. At that point it's every man for himself.</br></br>  <br> TL;DR: this looks like shitty wish-fufillment thus far, can LNfags tell me if it gets any better regarding character interaction? <br><br>Welcome to the world of anime.<br><br>But they do end up doing things against his wishes later on though. They each have their own wants and needs alongside their loyalty to Papa Bones.<br><br>Cocyutus for example  wanted Momonga to spare the Lizardmen instead of exterminating them because he felt a "kinship" with them as warriors. <br><br>Sebas  gets a human girlfriend despite Nazarick being EXTREMELY anti-human, and the ones that Papa Bones save are just barely tolerated by the others. <br><br>Narberal  keeps getting pissed at humans and keeps having to be chastised by papa for being a bad bunny. Pic related <br><br>Shalttear  also tries to kill him at one point as well. Then she became his chair. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They where MADE by him and his friends. And Albedo is specifically supposed to be in love with him. Shaltear is just a horndog. Plus, they're all afraid he might leave them one day like the other guild members did. It's not like all of this is out of the blue. But I suppose the anime didn't explain it well enough.</br>  <br>He's a creator of them, of course they do. He's basically their god, without all the religious bullshit. In addition, its obvious why Albedo does, and Shalltear, well, thats because she has some real funky fetishes</br>  <br>Albedo wanted to because of her adjusted description that Ainz made as a joke and he felt disgusted at himself when he realized what that joke makes her do.<br><br>Shalltear is just weird like that.<br><br>Aura doesn't seem to mind either which way though. But then she's only a 74 year old brat so who can say?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The thing is that Momonga didn't expect this shit, he was thrown into it. It's not his fault and one of his greatest worries is that the NPCs will betray him.</br></br>  Whens Ch. 2?  <br>2 hours probably. Maybe less.</br>  <br>KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br><br><br>Hey I understand why it happened and it was explained well. I just wish they didn't do it.<br><br>It just kinda irks me on a conceptual level.<br>Like being the uberpowerful evil Overlord isn't enough, he has to have women fighting over him from the get-go too. <br>It just feels like it's too much, too soon.<br><br><br>But if it actually leads to something good, I'll eat my words.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SAGASHITEEEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br><br>anyone have a gif of this?</br></br>  <br>WITH MY SOUL</br>  <br>It isnt unsual for children to love their creators</br>  <br>no. but I have a webm grandpa. <br><br><br> WITH MY SOUL I guess </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well there is a reason why LN fags calls Ainz Papa Bones.</br>  <br>I'd prefer a gif but t-thanks, papa bones</br>  <br> uberpowerful <br>He's actually pretty weak</br></br>  <br><br><br>So none of you think some actual conflict between characters other than who gets to be Lord Skeltal's bottom bitch would be interesting?<br><br><br>Actually Anon, you're the retard. I clearly stated that i was giving examples, i just didnt want to go out of my way to list obedient types other than Semendemon since, right now, all of the gaurdians seem fully obedient. If it was up to me, i'd make Shaltear the bitchy one who constantly goes against Skeltal's word (so the hostility with Albedo can be justified) and have Demi be the one that acts nice but doesnt actually care about his orders. Cocytus can be netrual as in he doesnt dislike nor like Bones, but hes obedient. Same for Sebas. All the others can go ahead and be wet for the skelly dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WITH MY HEART</br>  <br><br><br>August 26 when?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br> So none of you think some actual conflict between characters other than who gets to be Lord Skeltal's bottom bitch would be interesting? <br>You mean the shit that happens later?</br></br>  <br>Albedo isn't loyal, she is only in love. Sebas pushes Skeletor into doing good things.<br>I like Demiurge's role of overexplaining everything that Momonga does to make it seem like some kind of master plan. The part in volume four when he does this is one of the best parts of the novels in my opinion.</br></br>  <br> So none of you think some actual conflict between characters other than who gets to be Lord Skeltal's bottom bitch would be interesting? <br><br>i honestly doesnt even recogblnize anyone being the wife or some shit.<br><br>I mean the fact that Ainz is a skeleton makes everything null. Nigga doesnt even get a boner anymore which is ironic for a being made of bones</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is very specialized, that doesnt make him anywhere close to weak. Stuff like "The goal of all life is death" is beyond broken. So far only time weve seen him get serious was against Chair that is set up to be his Hard counter, and he came out on top. Calling him "pretty weak" is just plain stupid.</br>  So far im only watching still because the premise. The pacing is absolute shit. Two episodes in and we're barely past an introduction of the area and characters. <br><br>Last episode was literally him going outside. That's it. Then an additional 15 minutes of his minions sucking his dick. <br><br>We get, they adore him, move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shalltear isn't his hard counter, he just didn't know that Peroronchino had given her a counter to his super death spell.</br>  <br>what happens in August 26th?</br>  <br> Then she became his chair. <br>Truly OTP.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, I didn't read the LNs.</br>  <br>well then strap in buddy. You're in for a ride.</br>  <br>http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/ZM<wbr>CZ-10179</wbr></br>  <br>Lets see, undead that uses holy magic, has lance that heals when it deals damage so minions are NG, overall very good stats, resistances, ressurection item. She is literally the worst possible opponent for Ainz who specializes in death magic and summons. Even Ainz was shocked how it seemed like Peroroncino made her as if she was designed to take him down.</br>  I'm not the only one who likes the ED, right?  <br>OP and ED are both great.</br>  <br>DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION!</br>  <br>I would prefer Shalltear but it's still pretty good</br>  <br>I'd really rather he not. It's pretty obvious he has some desires that just won't be satisfied. Stop promising people stuff yo don't know that they'll get.</br>  <br>Eh, he can do what he want's. Doesn't affect me.</br>  <br> By the way, why are you dressed like that? <br> Bukubuku-sama wanted me to be a trap <br>I fucking knew it.</br></br></br>  New translation vol5 when?   “Simple, just pick one person and cut off his arms. That way, the others will compare themselves with him and know that they are more fortunate. How wonderful. And to make the one whose arms were chopped off feel blessed, we just need to chop off another person’s legs. Ahh, I made so many people happy!” <br>Fucking clowns.</br>  Still waiting on non-Funi subs for episode 2.  <br>Everyone must be happy.</br>  <br>What you're looking for, just plain and simply wouldn't make any sense. If we are going to use bad writing seriously, what you just said would be a good case of it.</br>  Do people even know how much of a beating the concept would get if even one of Papa Bone's children wasn't loyal? The one time it happened, it almost brought him to his knees and there are actually people who want it hard-coded that some aren't loyal.<br><br>What, all the women want his dick? I'm pretty sure I counted only two and both want him for different reasons. Of course, there's  Ivileye  later but that's just hopeless.<br><br>Call it wish fulfillment or whatever but I'd rather not read about Papa Bones now trying to get his subordinate's loyalty.

I keep hearing about these college girls and want to read it</br>  Why would a master of Bajiquan who could go toe to toe with knife wielding square-accelerated Kerry fail to prevent Shirou from stabbing him in the chest? <br><br>Does getting old do that to a person?</br></br>  yes  <br>Because   Nasu is a hack </br>  <br>Nasu wrote him first though.</br>  <br>That's why it's plain bad</br>  <br>The theory is that he was not in his prime and lacked a proper heart to do shit and the like.<br>There are always some kind of explanation to stupid shit in Fate no matter how fucked they may sound.<br>Just wait until some Fatefags deliver a "better' explanation than me.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucked up*</br>  Plot armor<br><br>Shitrou always wins</br></br>  What the writer says goes and no amount of powerlevel discussion can change that.  <br>I'm pretty sure the dagger wasn't exactly in plain sight until it was already in Kirei's chest.<br><br>Besides, Kirei was fucking with him. People like to focus on how Gil wasn't fighting Shirou seriously because HURR DURR FAKERS AND MONGRELS, but Kirei did the same shit in Fate route. He was fucking with Shirou because he thought watching him suffer and succumb to Grail curses was fun. He did not expect Shirou to burst out of it and stab him in the chest at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because of Plot Armor. There's no way a slow noob like Shirou could touch Kotomine even if he's not at his prime. Just look at HF, he was as fast as Hasan while carrying Illya</br></br>  <br>Run speed and reflexes are not the same thing.</br>  <br><br>Who fucking cares, plot armor is still plot armor</br></br>  <br>Cool, but Kirei reflexes allowed him to deflect bullet speed dirks from Hassans, so yeah</br>  <br>He's just not good with edges.</br>  <br>Vs Hassan, he was actively engaged in fight or flight mode already. Adrenaline was already in his system. His senses were alert.<br><br>Vs Shirou, he just threw the dumb kid in the mud. Shirou should have been in far too much agony to do anything. Kirei's body is at rest. No adrenaline in his blood. He's not expecting a ginger kid to burst out of the mud with a knife.<br><br>When you expect something to happen, your reflexes are faster. When you aren't, your brain takes longer to process information before it acts, so your reflexes are slower.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because Shirou is faster than a Servant, right?</br></br>  <br>You're just willfully being dense at this point.<br><br>Hassan did not surprise Kirei. Shirou did.</br></br></br>  <br>See? There will be always some kind explanation no matter how shitty it is. More like an exploitation of the facts but still, whatever.</br>  <br><br><br>This is why I hate Fate threads. Faggots like you all who bought into the "Nasu is a hack" and "Fate is shit" shitposting memes so hard that you never stop to fucking think about a goddamn thing. Something doesn't agree with my mindset that the VN is shit and the author is a hack? Oh, it's dumb, I'll just dismiss it. Why is it dumb? Because it doesn't agree with my mindset that this VN is shit and its author is a hack.</br></br></br>  Shirou with his ideals behind him gains super powers.<br><br>I'm not even kidding. Nasu explicitly stated that Archer in UBW didn't straight up couldn't see through Shirou's attack because it was a strike with his ideals on the line. He chose not to stab him back afterwards sure, but Shirou's actual attack couldn't be guarded against because ideals.</br></br>  <br>Kirei is Executor not some random faggot. He was trained to expect the unexpected</br>  <br>He's also a sadistic cunt who threw a kid into a concentrated curse. He's one part high on suffering, one part convinced that the kid's as good as dead. He wasn't expecting Avalon bullshit.</br>  <br><br>He was too shocked over a Japanese high schooler overcoming All the Evils of the World with out of nowhere plothax.</br></br>  Kotomine was too surprised to do anything. The sight of that particular dagger added to the play.  <br>That's literally just bullshit you're making up. Not only do we have no idea what Executor training involves, you can't train someone to give them precognition. If someone thinks they're not fighting and the only danger to them is stuck in a situation that no one has ever gotten out of before except the King of fucking Heroes (and even he didn't break out of it, he was just unaffected by it for the duration), then they're not going to expect a stab in the chest.</br>  <br>What, so everything is plothax now? I guess Saber having Excalibur and therefore not dying to Rider is plothax as well. or hell, Gil having Ea and being able to overcome the strongest holy sword Excalibur is plothax too.<br><br>How the fuck is Avalon of all things plothax?</br></br></br>  <br>Fate, as much as I like it, if full of plot holes, most of them come from others story than stay night though. Like this one, Zero was written by someone else. As much as people love it, it is not much more than a fanfiction. And with Nasu, everything and nothing is canon, so yeah.</br>  <br>He could only go toe to toe with Kiritsugu because he was spamming command spells as super reinforcement. He was just standing there in Fate wihtout any enhancements active and also ten years out of practice with a fake heart. Kirei as he was in the final battle in Zero legitimately fight against Ciel. F/SN Kirei would get wrecked by her.</br>  The grail mud that fucked up Kerry and eventually killed him got Kotomine too. Kotomine is tougher and managed to avoid getting too sick and dying from it, but he's still pretty messed up. The Kotomine we see in FSN is nowhere near being on the level that he was in F/Z.  <br>Shirou didn't just jump out of mud and stab Kotomine at the same time. He still needed to cover few meters first. Kirei could be surprised but he still should be able to dodge or block the attack</br>  <br>That's not what he literally said you mong. Archer had to accept being stabbed because he accepted his defeat in the ideals war. Hence why when Shirou says he won, he doesn't mean that he won the actual fight. Archer could have just stabbed him afterwards and been done with it.</br>  <br>The guy is also standing smack dab in the middle of the Grail sludge and controlling it at the same time. I think he's a little preoccupied to worry about some skinny kid stabbing him with a dagger he shouldn't even have.</br>  Am I the only who slammed my head every time Nasu threw in his crappy similes and metaphors?<br><br>"If Excal is a whirlwind, Ea is a raging storm"<br>"Rider is a shooting star, but Saber is an unmovable planet"<br>"Tohsaka is like the devil"<br><br>You could make a fucking drinking game with this shit.<br><br>"You and I are the same!" has been yelled by villains at protagonists for fucking ever<br><br><br>It's extremely cynical because a very basic rule of writing is not to waste your audience's time. When you borrow a stranger's time for the sake of your story, you had better make it worthwhile. When a vast number of readers are mentioning that they felt a work wasted their time but had some good moments, something there is wrong. I'm not saying the work overall is shit, but the fact that a lot of people came out of F/SN largely unsatisfied and bored by the majority of the story isn't something that should be ignored. Reception should not be written off just because "lol opinions". Immersion stops being meaningful when excessiveness begins. F/SN is excessive in its attempts at immersion. The SOL elements are often awkward, pointless, repetitive, nonsensical, and badly placed. I'd like to go on but the field's too long and I'm not even sure that you'll look at this objectively.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>because people die when they are killed, anon</br></br>  <br>He is immune to mud and not controlling it, he said it reacts to living beings and attack automaticly</br>  <br> When a vast number of readers are mentioning that they felt a work wasted their time but had some good moments, something there is wrong. <br><br>That's not true at all. What's wrong with catering to a niche instead of going for broad, bland appeal?</br></br></br>  <br>Just because Kirei knows martial arts, it doesn't mean he can fight</br>  <br>The same reason Gilgamesh forgot how to fight, how to wear his armor, and that he can shoot something other than swords in UBW.</br>  <br>Shirou had the initiative with a surprise attack and lucky critical hit, and Kirry suffered a lack of initiative in his confusion.</br>  <br>I'd like to help you accept the phenomenon that is Nasu's readerbase by giving you two possible reasons why it is acceptable.<br><br>A) Every other portrayal of the material is awful-mediocre. I don't know how Ufotable got Fate/Zero so right, but they certainly didn't do the same thing for UBW. If I didn't read the VN, half the character motivations and intricacies would be totally incomprehensible.<br><br>B) Reading VN's is like crawling through the pipes of a septic tank. Partially due to the fact that the writing sucks, and partially due to the fact that the translations suck. Fate suffers from both often enough, but even if they are just as lengthy in Japanese, the metaphors and such are not nearly as bad as in English.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does this image exist ?</br>  <br>If you were a zombie bearing the curses of All the evils in the world within you for 10 years, you physically degrade quite abit.<br><br>If you were a zombie that did not even need a heart to survive any more, you'd also not be very concerned about any weakass dagger some human kid stabs you in the chest with.<br>Too bad it WASN'T a simple dagger, but filled with as much destructive magic as 10 jewels or some shit.<br><br>Regardless, Shirou got very lucky on his initiative roll on Kirei from jumping out of the "will consume everything without fail" mud.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying it's a meme and not undeniable hack that NASU IS A HACK <br>Cry some more fag and go back to reddit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah even with AGI C Gilgamesh he couldn't match Shirou in UBW.</br>  <br>Aside from Shirou having head start because his swords are already there to be used, AGI=/=Speed, more hand to eye coordination</br>  <br>Don't bullshit me on that, Shirou had stated many times he couldn't match a Servant in stats yet Gil was getting rekt on fucking melee.<br> more hand to eye coordination <br>Then Shirou had faster more hand to eye coordination than Gil who is a fucking Servant? Don't you think that is too much of a plot armor?</br></br></br>  <br> Then Shirou had faster more hand to eye coordination than Gil who is a fucking Servant? <br>Not really. By the time Gil pull out a weapon from GoB, Shirou already swing his so Gil could only defend. Other Servant in his place could easily counter Shirou attack and go on offensive but Gil's weak in melee.</br></br>  <br>Gil is a weak faggot, every servant except Caster types (like shitty Medea who got rekt by a magical powered teenage girl) could rekt him phisically without his hax.</br>  <br>To torment you.</br>  <br>Shirou stated he couldn't match a Servant.<br>He did not specify anything in particular like stats.<br>However, in his next few lines, he notes that Gilgamesh is just like him, an owner of weapons instead of a master of weapons.<br><br>It means exactly what it says; Gilgamesh is crossly incompetent at all of his weapons, and was never a warrior (in the nasuverse).<br>Stats simply don't mean shit when Goldie is an incompetent fucktard, plot armour was never involved.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>PIS/CIS is another form of Plot Armor.</br>  You should have noticed by now that the outcome of the fights in Fate are decided by what the plot demands.  <br> Plot induced stupidity <br> implying Gilgamesh wasn't a fucking moron even in his own legend <br><br>As much as he lauds himself as the greatest, most perfect badass across the land, and ever hero poops their pants over his access to so many noble phatasms, you'd have to be a fool to believe all that bragging after viewing all the material.<br><br> fucks up horribly in every single route, constantly makes poor decisions <br> fucks up horribly in fate/zero <br> fucks up horribly, repeatedly, in his own legend <br><br>Oh, but its totally out of character for him to be a fucking retard that fucks up at the most inopportune moments in F/SN!<br>Face it. He is an incompetent buffoon disguised behind 1st class equipment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So is Shirou faster than Saber?</br>  <br>Then you admit Nasu made a shit villain for FSN?</br>  <br>This is what you get when you let your fellow hacks write your prequels for you.</br>  <br>It wouldn't really be Fate if any of the characters knew how to fight in a manner that's not retarded.</br>  <br>I like to assume, at least in the anime continuity, that the armor got destroyed.<br><br>He was birthed by the grail and he lost his armor due to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Explain Fate route.<br> captcha: yogurt is not ice cream </br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but Shirou, at max power with UBW up and everything, I could see that as being correct.</br>  <br>Goldie thematically fit the stories just fine, and was very much a character as much as he was [designated antagonist that has to lose].<br><br>What kind of villain would you want?</br></br></br>  <br>Like I said, at least in the anime continuity, it kind of works. Fate doesn't happen there. It's straight from Zero to UBW.</br>  <br>Archer's agility is the same as Saber's.<br>Granted he's got ten years on Shirou, but it's worth noting.</br></br>  <br>Shirou in UBW gets powered up from going against Archer, so he might have inherited a good chunk of his agility.</br>    <br>Someone's smart enough to bail out when he knew he's going to lose, or getting more protection/defense/hostage etc. Look I know I'm asking for a generic villain but at least make him follow logic for a second, even Dio took caution after he saw dozen of knives stabbing through Jotaro.</br>      <br>Even if this is just bait, it's sad that there are actual people who believe this.</br>  <br>It's sad that you think it's sad.</br>    <br>But Shirou doesn't know orthodox magic. <br>Does this mean Archer went to London at some point of his life?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>He likely reads up on stuff at some point in his life. UBW Shirou should ultimately end up knowing a lot more than him.</br>  And here is Unlimted Blade Works and how it works.   expecting a fully developed plot with fleshed out characters in an eroge VN <br> expecting what little plot there is to make sense after reading the first two portions <br> expecting a shit, self-insert eroge shounen VN to not cater to those that self-insert into it </br></br>  <br>I didn't ask.</br>  <br>So you wanted a villain conceived over 8 years ago to break the mold and be completely unbeatable and win in a story that isn't about him in the first place?<br><br>So you wanted Gilgamesh to behave out of character, and then win?<br>You wanted F/SN to suddenly shift 15 hours in to be about Gilgamesh and his epic modern extermination of the human race after winning the grail war?<br><br>Sorry, I don't. It would make a nice spinoff, but if you want that as the main story, fuck you.<br><br>Also, maybe you should pay attention to Caster more if you want villains that behave like how you specified.<br>And you should know better than to want every villain within the SAME STORY to behave like Caster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ah, one of the many known ass pulls of the fate trilogy. Yes, how exactly does one such as kirei go toe to toe with a servant on the defense (assassin class) get his ass wrecked by a barely magus who just discovered magic not even two weeks ago beat some one like that?</br>  <br>I don't ask for Gilgamesh epic genocide, I ask for logical villain who at least knew to use his armor when he's shit at melee, then by some powerup Shirou broke his armor and finished him off.</br>  What does /a/ think of Fate/Apocrypha and Fate/strange Fake?  <br> defensive equipment is also possible <br>Plot hole detected. Archer can only create swords.</br></br>  <br>Archer can project shields and armor too.</br>  <br>Better than the original VN.</br>  <br>Only Rho Aias, but that's because he was in contact with the original during his life.</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>  <br>The former is probably the most forgettable thing in the Fate franchise. Strange Fake might end up being okay.</br>  <br>Too bad hes the same kind of dumbass that would, after journeying the length and breadth of the land for it, proceed to NOT eat the fruit of immortality immediately, and take a nap under a fucking tree and lose it to a snake.<br><br>Its the exact in-character thought process that would lead to<br> Armour is so heavy, what a burden <br> slavshit clothing is so comfortable <br> what could go wrong? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know how Ufotable got Fate/Zero so right, but they certainly didn't do the same thing for UBW. <br><br>Miura</br></br></br>  <br>How could an exhausted boy beat a heroic spirit?<br><br>  Simple hand-to-hand combat between two Servants is enough to wreck a city street in a manner able to be compared to having been carpet-bombed, damaging the ground with only their footfalls, cutting metal with only the backlash caused by their weapons clashing, and tearing away iron from simply brushing against it with weapons. <br><br>  Both their movement speed and dexterity is enough to make them invisible to the human eye, looking like a breeze of wind when running past and only leaving the aftershocks of their attacks to be felt by onlookers. <br><br>  ... and Medea severing an arm with a ritualistic dagger unable to normally even be considered lethal to a regular human. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Awesome"<br>Fate/Apocrypha gave me Saber of the Black.<br>Fate/strange Fake gave me the Strongest Lancer.</br></br></br>  <br>  they certainly didn't do the same thing for UBW. If I didn't read the VN, half the character motivations and intricacies would be totally incomprehensible. <br><br>Name something that's confusing.</br></br></br>  <br> もっとも、士郎が投影できるのは武器関係のみ。それも剣に限定された武装<wbr>で、近代兵器は投影さえ出来なし。</wbr> <br>盾や鎧はかろうじて引き出せるが、効果は瞬間的なものであり、その代償は大<wbr>きい。</wbr></br></br>  <br>Miura is Based and handled UBW great.</br>  <br> Saber of the Black <br>A glorified speed bump.<br> the Strongest Lancer <br>Literally the second most boring character in Strange Fake after Gil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gonna need popcorn for this one.</br>  <br>Every episode he personally directed were almost unanimously loved. 20? 25? Those were him.</br>  <br>Here is your reply.</br>  <br>You almost got me.</br>  <br>You fresh from MAL or something?</br>    <br>Shirou's characterization.</br>  <br>Dont worry Fatefags will find a way to explain it.</br>  <br>I think the translations were quietly canceled.</br>  <br>What about it? Episode 20 handled his answer in some ways better than the VN.</br>  <br> Every episode he personally directed were almost unanimously loved. <br>At one point, I thought that Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works might be good, and its first half still is! The first half of this show has the decency to be fun, but now I'm convinced that there's no way to make FSN work via a straight, polished adaptation. It's thematically and structurally broken. There's potentially something there, but you'd need to go down deep and rearrange its guts first. As it stands, FSN:UBW is a fascinating case study for what makes or breaks a work dramatically. It's a shame that I'd rather dissect it at this point than actually enjoy watching it.<br><br>Grade: D</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh wasn't taking the encounter seriously, you see.</br>  Why didn't Gilgamesh just throw his airship at Shiroe?  <br>I loved how that reviewer went insane once she realized Shirou's character wasn't going the way she wanted.</br>  <br>Was she the one that decided that it was about overcoming muh toxic masculinity and that Rin was ruined forever after getting captured by Kotomine?</br>  <br>Vimana was destroyed in F/Z.</br>  <br>Same one. You know you're in for a ride when you look up a review and "feminism" is mentioned half a dozen times.</br>  <br> I don't know how Ufotable got Fate/Zero so right <br>But they didn't. They fucked up the beginning, the ending, the perspective of the story, the flashbacks, the last fights, the tone of the story, among many other things.<br>Have you even read the LN?</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it all just magic anyway? It's not like there's a physically existing storage that he pulls things from. If he were summoned more than once then his inventory should be refreshed.</br>  <br> throw his airship <br>About that..</br></br>  <br>Because Shirou can project airship-sized swords too.</br>  <br>Gil wasn't summoned more than once.</br>  <br>Gil regains all his broken things if he is summoned again, but in SN he was the same Gil from Zero in an incarnated body. All his lost stuff was gone for good.</br>  <br>FSN UBW isn't an example of bad writing, it's an example of a bad director and composer not knowing what the fuck they're doing. The storyboarder and episode director for UBW ep 20, Takashi Suhara, also unsurprisingly did some of the stronger episodes for Fate/Zero such as Lancer's 'exit' and the first episode of Kiri's flashback. The storyboarder for episode 21 of UBW was Takahiro Miura himself. The difference is apparent.</br>  <br>Nice pasta you got there</br>  <br>because Shirou is the John Cena of Fate</br>  <br> FSN UBW isn't an example of bad writing <br>It's certainly not an example of good writing.</br></br>  <br>Hey, NeoGAF. I haven't heard a peep from those fucks since the fall season,.</br>  <br>No, that would be me.</br>  <br>That guy next to him looks like Shinji</br>  <br>The DEEN version of the fight was far superior to the ufotable version as odd as that sounds. They botched the single most hype fight of this route with a shit ton of redundant dialogue and pacing that is slower than Endless Eight. The fuck is this bullshit. They could've easily made this in to an amazing two part sequence going over Archer and Shirou's contradictory belief while fighting but it's fight then talk and fight then talk again and again and again. Who the fuck thought this was a great idea. <br><br>The music was also shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He did have a great hand to hand fight in HF, and Shirou only won because Kirei technically died a bit earlier from Hassan's heart swap.</br></br>  <br>It's a toss up between Issei or Shinji really.</br>  <br> 20 <br> Miura <br><br>You can stop shilling now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>After rewatching episode 20 of FSN UBW, I don't think the show needed a heavy revision or whatever. I think it again boils down to direction and storyboarding. The idea of making the Archer vs Shirou fight as long as it is, would have worked if the storyboarding was better and the show tried to present the material in an interesting fashion rather than just the dialogue. The most interesting thing visually the show has done in both cours is the repetition sequence in episode 20 and it works to present the material not only in a visually arresting manner but also condenses the theme of the work to a quick sequence. It's economical storytelling and it works emotionally.<br><br>The soundtrack is also so fucking lackluster that many scenes are just dead on arrival because the OST is flatter than soda left out for a week. Fukasawa totally shat the bed and this show makes me think of him less as a composer.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny to see how night and day impressions on here are for FSN when compared to other places I see reactions for. It's hard to not get a little upset considering how much I love Fate and the whole universe. I do understand some problems with last couple episodes but I still find the clash of ideals to be fascinating. The promise of the story is immense but it's executed poorly at times. I felt the show ended strongly and satisfyingly.</br>  <br><br><br>What's with these people obsessing over the soundtrack? I thought it was fine. The music that played over Archer's rant in UBW as he was stabbing Shirou was really memorable.</br></br></br>  <br>They needed more VN music.</br>  <br>By the end the anime used more VN music than any other TM adaptation. They also played Emiya three or so times in the Archer fight.<br><br>Also, not having VN music isn't inherently bad. I didn't see anything wrong with the music as it was.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu isn't smart enough to think that far ahead. Plot armor.</br>  I don't understand why people make all these excuses for inconsistencies in the world written by the author. Why couldn't the author just write a scenario where the results of climactic battles are not questionable?<br><br>Kirei I can understand because he wasn't shown to be the unstoppable hand to hand monster he was in Zero yet, but even then it is pretty retarded for a mainly self-trained teenager to get the upper hand on him in a fight. hat I can hand wave.<br><br>The Gilgamesh thing is retarded no matter how you look at it. He's the first hero of the fucking world and in the same story he bests the most famous hero in the world. No amount of bullshit power level hacks or "he was just fooling around" excuses makes up for him losing to some Japanese high schooler fueled by a sex-transferred magic crest and hand to hand skills learned by contact.<br><br>In both cases it wouldn't have been hard to write the villains into a scenario where Shirou can win without there being so much uproar. The fact that people can so easily question how he won is a sign of bad writing for the world and the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> enkidu boring <br>you earned this reply</br></br>  <br>IT'S <br>PLOT<br>ARMOR</br></br></br>  <br>Plot armor does not exist in fate stay night. Shirou dies 30+ times.</br>  <br>The Gil fight makes sense though. You factor in just FSN, and Shirou beating Gil isn't some absurd notion.<br><br>Sure, Gil beat Heracles, but do you know who also killed him once? Rin in the Fate route. Shirou takes on Berserker in HF too.<br><br>Plus you gotta realize that Shirou became pretty damn strong by the end of UBW due to his fight with Archer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fate/Apocrypha <br>The next Fate thing to get an anime. It's so shounen it'll capture all of the F/Z audience plus more.<br>I personally don't mind since I get to see Karna animated.<br><br> Fate/strange Fake <br>Honestly, too early to tell.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And he would die hundred times more if not for plot armor.</br>  How much times has Gil lost or gotten fucked? I can only think of 4 times.<br> Saber <br> Shadow <br> Gawain (you're forced to lose on the first playthrough) <br> Shirou </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda but the show added unneccessay filler, like way way too much and kept on repeating the same damn lines that were only mentioned once in the VN. It also managed to completely kill any excitement fight had. There's a reason why in the VN, Shirou says "I am the bone of my sword", the track Emiya kicks, through has his realisations (none of which is mentioned before that moment) and the fight ends shortly afterwards, it's one continuous climax. In the VN Shirou and Archer barely speak during the fight, outside of Archer's occasional taunting, and the Kiritsugu flashback, it's mostly Shirou's, thoughts, as in the they weren't actually arguing in the later part is was just fighting and that fighting served a distinct purpose.<br><br>It works well because It's later contrasted by Archer's own thoughts and realisations. <br><br>Also seems kinda like laziness the Ufotable couldn't be bothered showing the fighting style contrast, there was a reason why in the VN, after Shirou, said I am the bone of my sword, he completely disguards Archer's fighting style,, which cause Archer to remark shocked that despite, how pitful, he was completely lacking in style or effectiveness his blows seemed much heavier, and then a bunch of introspection from that point. Of course that require them to have had a consistent notable choregraphy in this fight, which it really didn't have.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quit multiple-universefagging.<br>That excuse doesn't work if Shirou wins because of plot armor in the universes he doesn't die</br></br>  <br>Would they really make an Apocrypha anime?</br>  <br>Pic related is not plot armor. You don't even know what it means.</br>  <br>JETS</br>  <br> It's just a coincidence. If the first surprise attack was blocked by coincidence, these attacks were also blocked by chance. <br> I can't even see her movements. For me to stay alive in spite of that is nothing but pure luck. <br>Sure</br></br></br>  <br>Fatefags doing their best to look as insane as possible</br>  <br>Who knows, last volume of F/Z was released 2007, animated in 2011. Now Fate is even more popular franchise but UFOtable is busy with other projects.</br>  <br>You have to understand that some things that work in a VN don't work in an anime.<br><br>DEEN actually played the fight fairly straight in some ways, because Shirou and Archer talked about as much there as in the VN, but was anyone satisfied with that? Of course not. The best part of the Archer fight isn't the fight, it's Shirou's realization and determination to follow his ideal that hits home with people, and the anime handled that very well.<br><br>I mean the absolute rage in Archer's voice as he belittles Shirou's ideal in UBW was fantastic. Shirou's getting cut up, Saber's looking on in a mix of despair and awe, and that music kicking in in the background. I love that scene.<br><br>And then right as things are at their lowest, you have that transition into Shirou's inner thoughts, which I felt was frankly superior to how the VN handled it. You had amazing imagery and parallels there that brought home everything about Shirou's character and his goal. The music also was great. Some people are annoyed that they didn't blast Emiya, but they had it several times in the fight, and the song worked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prisma Illya.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/J<wbr>ETS/</wbr></br>  Pick a fruit<br><br>Hard mode:  no fruit salad </br></br>  <br>L E M O N<br>E <br>M<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br>  Lemon  <br>Ringo.</br>  <br>fruit COCKtail</br>  Cherry  Lemon  <br>Cherry's breasts are the biggest, thereby making her the best girl automatically.</br>  grape? anyone?  <br>Lemon.<br> <br>I really like her voice actor and most games her voice actor is in you can't get with that girl. </br> </br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>I want to sniff grapes' armpits and asshole.</br></br>  Where is my strawberry?  <br>I agree grape<br>You cant spell grape without rape am i right</br></br>  <br><br><br> literally retarded </br></br></br>  <br>Lemon = Apple &gt; Grape &gt; Cherry</br>  Lemon.

So the manga is definitely ending here then?  <br>Whoops meant the anime</br>  <br>  four goo </br>  <br>Its thier only accomplishment, and the by far best one to be honest</br>  <br>For season 1 yea, but id assume there will be s2 since its actually popular in Japan</br>  <br>Do you think Chris Nolan regrets doing this scene or does he think it was perfect?</br>  <br>There isn't enough material for another season</br>  Waifu head  <br>Best head in the series</br>  <br>Has there ever been an anime or manga gag that showed a middle school that was completely full of students with middle schooler syndrome?</br>  <br>Not yet, the manga will keep on going and eventually there will be enough material to make a second season</br>  <br>better than the majority or other boards put together</br>  Will there ever be decent Lala fanart?  <br>No idea, all I got is this which I assume is made by the original creator.</br>  <br>Tomodachi wa muri desu.</br>  We need a Slavic monster girl.<br>In before Brezhnev-chan</br>  <br> In before Brezhnev-chan <br>But we already have Chaika.</br></br>  <br><br>Are you telling me that Chiaka is in fact a monmusu? <br><br>that actually sounds legit.</br></br></br></br>  This will not die!<br><br>This was posted by snekfag in the Miia thread.</br></br>  <br>Get 8 1m pillows. That way it can wrap around you better.</br>    The lack of best butt in this thread is disgusting  <br>Chris Nolan thinks everything he does is genius.<br>Which is why he has yet to apologize for the Zod neck snap or even try to explain why Supes didn't just fly straight up so Zod couldn't microwave a family.</br></br>  <br>Most intense peach fuzz ever.</br>    <br>I want an internship with her.</br>  <br>Look at all that fur.</br>  <br><br>Second softest behind Suu. Would smelt unsafely and die from the resulting arsenic oxide cloud.</br></br>    <br>Niggar Polt ain't soft she's a /fit/girl</br>  WHERE ARE THE FUCKING SUBS?!  <br>I don't know but it must be Mika's fault.</br>  <br>MIKA DID NOTHING WRONG</br>  <br>I can't watch this shit you donkeys! It's RAW!</br>  <br><br>in a couple months</br></br>  <br>The movie was just a circlejerk for Kogami and Makishima. Akane was useless as fuck.<br>Shit anime even for Butcher standards.</br></br>  <br>Is this not considered a high priority job for the sub groups now that the hard copies are on sale?</br>  In five minutes  <br> high priority job for the sub groups <br>What subgroups?<br>Also why would anyone consider it high priority to spend his own time to work on something for nagging faggots at 4chan?<br>Someone will sub it eventually, be patient.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here</br>  <br> What subgroups? <br>Well correct me if I'm wrong, but would there not be any fansub groups interested in subbing the movie?</br></br>  <br>If I'm going to guess either Commie would because they have a fuck ton of people. Or Underwated because they dropped Gangsta and they don't have anything for 3 months.</br>  <br> Or Underwater because they dropped Gangsta <br>That was fast.</br></br>  <br> Or Underwated because they dropped Gangsta <br><br>That's not how this works, anon. They'll at least pretend to be still working on it for another month.<br><br> So as you might have figured out, Gangsta 03 is delayed because the editor has gone missing. It should come out after he resurrects. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2 week at most. Even a movie like EfP got generally fast subs.</br>  I just want to see Akane's tits, I do 't even care if the movie is good I've already at through season 2  <br> Akane's tits <br>I wasn't told these would be in the movie. I have mixed emotions regarding this revelation.</br></br>  But there is a lot of Engrish. You can watch it.  The thing is Engrish is harder to understand than Japanese.   <br>Loanwords aren't Engrish</br>  <br><br> No nipples. </br></br>  <br>Well, that's me out.</br>  <br>HanaKana, Araragi and Gilgamesh engrish is endearing. I had a lot of laughs hearing it.</br>  <br>Glad to see you used the opportunity this time.</br>  <br>But their nipple game has been so strong up until now</br>  Idiot alien BTFO when?   Rui and Rizumu have the same exact birthday <br>This is a bit suspicious.</br>  <br><br>Rizumu is older than Rui.</br></br>  <br>I meant the day, April 25th.</br>  <br>He's his Shadow. His foil. <br><br>It's a symbolic coincidence.</br></br></br>  <br>Muh symbolism. Rui didn't really react to it, though.</br>   Worst adaptation of this summer   How did you feel when you finished Gurren Lagann for the first time?  <br> getting with the kiss of death <br>Yoko stands for you only kiss once</br></br>  <br><br>Kittan kissed her before knowingly committing suicide.</br></br>  Satisfied, it was the perfect ending. Simon never was a leader simply a hero, and his job was done. So he did whatever he wanted and i think he was happy in his own way. Sad to see the girl go though...  <br>That was the spiral king when he was younger right?</br>  <br>Are you manly enough to kiss a beautiful girl, knowing you would die anon?</br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>You could just glue some of this onto whatever you want hairy.</br>  <br>it's cthugha from nyaruko</br>  <br>I always get my SAL packages within 2 weeks.</br>  <br>It's Yuuki Yuuna, twintails mode.</br>  <br> xD </br>  Just finished Evangelion today and uh........ I am emotionally distraught and I have no clue why. I mean I understand what happened but jesus christ.  Also it was good how they made me hate all of the characters at the beginning of the end just so I didn't kill myself after I watched that ending.   <br> Sure its a fine anime movie, one of the best anime movies around no doubt but it is not Evangelion AT ALL <br>They do it because the first part is true, but the second isn't.</br></br>  <br>The characters aren't broken and confusing in the first part of NGE either. Nothing complex about Shinji, Rei, Misato or Asuka or the rest in the first 13 or so episodes. There's the beginnings of the characters which 1.0 and 2.0 takes care of, and that means we have two whole movies to make great characters out of the Rebuild batch.<br><br> 3.0 happens  <br>woops!<br><br>Nothing wrong with 2.0, but 3.0 there is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> to make great characters out of the Rebuild batch <br>You don't when all of their problems are solved from the get-go. Asuka solves her superiority complex and starts doing nice things for people, Rei gets control of her emotions and forms a healthy purpose in life, Shinji's self-esteem goes up and he starts forming relationships with those around him. There's nothing to continue because the characters are already solved and at their highest points. We can only go down from here, which is where 2.0 fucked up in regards to characters.</br></br>  <br> b-but gaise 2.0 is the bad one! <br> n-not muh precious 3.0 that went back to the original Evangelion (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA) <br><br>How much longer are you going to do this anon? It's getting pathetic, every thread you get laughed out and crushed, what motivates you to keep shitposting like this?<br><br>is it some sort of troll supposed to make everyone who shits on 2.0 and defends 3.0 look retarded?<br><br>they don't need your help</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You don't when all of their problems are solved from the get-go.  <br>lol no<br><br>You know what fuck this, you quite clearly aren't mentally equipped to understand the original if you can't even get the first. Think Asuka solves any of her problems in 2.0, or that Bardiel wouldn't make them much worse?<br>Think Rei's whole problem being trapped and a clone gets solved in 2.0 because she cooks for Shinji, or that Shinji's issues are solved because the world smiles on him once?<br><br>It's like you didn't watch the original at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.youtube.com/results?sea<wbr>rch_query=%E3%83%89%E3%83%9F%E3%83%<wbr>8D%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC</wbr></wbr></blockquote>]
