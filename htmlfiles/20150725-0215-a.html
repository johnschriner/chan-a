Did I miss something?</br>  <br>I heard she fucked a groupie or whoever and they bragged about it on some Jap forum.</br>  Ayaneru is my seiyuufu.  I want more Hocchan and Noto Mamiko in my life.  I love everything about Imai! I think she is cute! CUTE!<br><br>C<br>U<br>T<br>E<br>!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Grating voice.</br>  <br>wish I could be a sound director and fuck Taneda Risa</br>  <br> believing tabloid gossip </br>  <br> implying she isn't getting fucked by someone </br>  <br>Why not? Americans do it all the time.</br>  Remember to take care of your teeth anon~  <br>Who would you want her to roleplay as while fucking her? I would personally choose Mirai.</br>  <br> Would you Asa-nee? </br>  <br>Certainly but the sound director rumor was just rumor. That's just how that faggot operates: pick certain newbie seiyuus for 1-2 year then move on to another newbie seiyuu when their pay inevitably has to be increased.</br>  My seiyuufu is vastly superior compared to Amamiya Sora,  <br> I would totally Asa-nee, and you anon? </br>  <br>You can't know that it's only a rumor. The seiyuu industry is not a sacrosanct workplace, people are coerced into sleeping with people in power there too I'm sure, or choose to do so to advance in their field. This is the entertainment industry after all.</br>  <br> Mirai <br>why<br><br><br>she'd be down for quite a bit of stuff</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't know that it's only a rumor <br>You also can't know that's it's not only a rumor.</br></br>  <br>No I can't, which is why I'm neither categorically denying nor claiming it. You do that, though.</br>  <br> neither categorically denying nor claiming it <br><br> implying she isn't getting fucked by someone <br><br>inb4 <br> that's not me <br><br>If that wasn't you please stop replying to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is there's just not enough evidence to support these claims. Aside from a few; Hirano Aya, Yukana, Toyosaki Aki; not many people do it or the industry is really that tight-lipped so everybody's secrets are safe.</br>  <br>If she's a pillow seiyuu she would've averaged more roles per season, anon. Why would she do something like that just to get 2 roles per season? <br><br>Don't try to say she's shit at voice acting because she's certainly great at it.</br></br></br>  Do you guys even know this qt? <br> I want her to get more roles ;_; </br>  <br>Looks old though.</br>  <br>meme seiyuu</br>  <br>I want to  seed  her</br>  Do you guys even know this qt?<br><br><br>That's not HanaKana or Amamiya Sora.</br></br></br>  <br>I politely decline your request.<br><br><br><br>I'm not claiming that Aketagawa is going balls deep up her ass between takes. (Funny by the way how everybody suddenly seems to be in the know after that one blog post.) There is zero evidence. There's also zero evidence to claim the opposite.<br>Someone is always sleeping with someone else somewhere out of career considerations. That's not even immoral, if they're adult people they can choose to do so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what position and how hard does it like it?</br>  <br> posting meaningless screenshot that can easily be edited </br>  <br> reductio ad meme arrow </br>  <br> There is zero evidence <br>So you can shut up now.</br></br>  Alright, /a/.

Like for what reason would there be such a delay?</br></br>  <br>This is why most people just use DN/YGP/etc..</br>  <br>D/D/D isn't exactly the most exciting archetype for most people so they really don't care. Shame too, the Star Pack would've been the perfect time to release them.</br>  <br>Will Yuya ever get a Duelist Pack? This is unprecedented, by this point in time Judai and Yusei had 2 duelist packs, Yuma had 1 and Kaito had another.<br>We got a Duelist Pack, but it was of Battle City</br></br>  <br>Not everyone here plays TCG.</br>  <br>Considering how far behind they are on the anime cards, probably not.</br>  <br>Duelist Pack Kamishiro was more important to put into CROS than Raging Masters, evidently.<br><br>I'm personally of the opinion that they could've slipped it into SECE or WSUP, or even Dragons of Legend 2 (I mean, they already had Aquaactress and Sybils in there).<br><br>I'm hoping that they decide to use some of the CORE TCG slots for the D/D/D cards we're missing, but I won't hold my breath for that because Horakty knows that Kosmoz self-wanking is more important than actually getting playable cards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They've never used TCG Exclusive slots for OCG imports, and they're not going to start now.</br>   5D's had 3 Yusei Duelist pack and a Crow Duelist pack <br> No KINGU pack <br>Well to be honest Jack Atlas pack would have been fucking terrible</br></br>  <br>Why is she so fuckable?</br>  <br>KoA does things based on how the cards will sell, as opposed to anything actually logical. Just look at the way the banlists are.</br>  <br>Because all the Ruris are.</br>  <br>Dammit, Konami. I can't justify spending money on cardboard if you keep holding out on me.</br>  <br>We'll keep doing it.</br>  BELIEVE BELIEVE<br>EVERYBODY GODWIN</br>  <br>Xyz Minerva a qt.</br>  <br> KoA does things based on how the cards will sell, as opposed to anything actually logical. <br>Except sometimes the things they do are counter-productive to selling more</br></br>  <br> OCG Exclusive that everyone in OCGland likely has a copy or two of <br> TCG hands it out as an event-exclusive that maybe a few thousand people (if that) will get. <br>Fucking hell, TCG.</br></br></br>  <br>Like if they printed Force Strix in TCG, people would play Raid Raptors, maybe not at a competitive level, but as a pet deck.</br>  <br>DEULING<br><br>WHILE<br><br> ┗(彡⑧^_)┓三 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention that Force Strix can also search many Blackwings, so that helps that brain-blendingly-popular petdeck get even more of an updraft.</br>  <br>Or how they still haven't reprinted Blood Mephist or Number 106.<br>And they still haven't errata'd CED and DMOC</br></br>  <br>Thank Number 100, I was afraid Shun and Dennis' cards would clog up the main booster</br>  <br>Once separated by dimensions and now so close together under the same roof, but unable to see each other I can't imagine how they feel.<br><br>If this was Shun &amp; Ruri instead, Imouto Man would have already Rise Falcon'd the door and began demolishing each of the rooms one by one until he found her.</br></br></br>  <br>In case you haven't noticed, they already have. This is likely going to have one or two new archetypes.</br>  <br>As a side note for the uninformed, Number 106 is currently an ~$850 card.<br><br>You can buy an old car for the price you'd pay for one piece of cardboard.  Although MtG players will likely be familiar with the Black Lotus, which is leagues above that in "ridiculously priced cardboard" <br><br>Konami could literally put that in a pile of shit and it would probably still fly off shelves. Hell, KoA could've put a 106 in the Noble Knight Box Set and moves hundreds (if not thousands) more units than they did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Noble Knight Box Set <br>That was one of the dumbest ideas KoA ever had. How much did it sell? Because the guy at my LCS said he only managed to sell 3, the rest have just been sitting there on a shelf for months</br></br>  <br>Would've sold a lot better if it weren't just a bunch of one-ofs and was actually the best you can build of a Noble Knight deck (extra deck aside) right out of the box.</br>  <br>Cyber Stein used to be even worse, it could get up to $5k.</br>  <br>That's because there were only 8 copies of it.</br>  <br>I live in a college town where many people have more money than they care for, and my local card shop ended up selling more singles of the staples than actual box sets. Merlin and the other exclusive to that set are still selling decently, but barely anybody ever expressed interest in buying the whole thing. KoA didn't seem to realize that most people actually interested in Noble Knights already HAD most of the cards to make the deck, meaning that they were basically spending $50 for some sleeves, a mat, and the two exclusives. While Platinum Rare is pretty amazing to look at, it's not worth spending $50 to get an entire deck you already have most of converted to a uniform rarity, even if it looks great.<br><br>Also, only putting 1 copy of each exclusive in the box set was utterly retarded, not to mention the deck itself's not even that great, even by NK standards.</br></br></br>  <br>This, it should have just been a TCG exclusive structure deck</br>  <br>To be fair, Shueisha/Shonen Jump Alpha have dibs on all promo cards and even if they don't release them Konami can't print them until they say so</br>  <br>That's the point though, Konami likes to make asinine limits to random ass cards and then try to give those away. Just look at Minerva where only a handful of people are going to actually get the card in the TCG.</br>  Is the Manzai out yet?  Is MonoSubs kill?  <br>Nah, just EVO'd out. Subs should be up today sometime.</br>  Will we ever see him again, /a/?  <br>He went to Synchro and became a member of Security</br>    Can't wait for more Assailt Blackwings<br>Just take all my money Konami</br>  <br>Trips confirmed<br>Just what is it about this picture?<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/119999<wbr>448/#120000000</wbr></br></br></br>    What is tuning magician effect?<br><br>Why did jack has such girly card in his fiend deck?</br></br>  <br>Probably something like.<br><br> This card is unaffected by cards and effects. When this card is summoned to the field, treat it as a tuner and non-tuner monster of any levels, and special summon one Synchro and Xyz monster from your extra deck. When this effect activates; your opponent discards their graveyard, hand, and all cards on the field and takes 2000 Life Points of damage. This card once in the graveyard or banished grants 3000 Attack to all monsters on your side of the field. <br><br>I don't know, maybe it's not power creeped enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sam is a typical scrub assuming a monster is shit because it has low base stats, it's probably a Tuner. Level 1 Tuners are amazing.</br>  <br>We need an updated version of this that's just Sora, Sawatari, Shun, Judai, and Serena arguing like in these threads.</br>  <br>Don't forget Yugo and Yuya fighting over Yuzu.</br>  <br> If this was Shun &amp; Ruri instead, Imouto Man would have already Rise Falcon'd the door and began demolishing each of the rooms one by one until he found her. <br><br>I hope he does that when they reach Academia.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember saying Academia was mostly going to be Shun running through the halls disrupting class shouting Ruri constantly.</br>  <br> bursts into Rin's room while she is changing <br> he blindly assumes she is Ruri <br> he rushes towards her to hug her <br> he gets slapped by her and sent flying </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shun ends up finding all the Ruris before Ruri and gets into shenanigans <br><br>I want these two scenarios so bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> he'll be carded before Academia </br></br></br>  <br>I just want Rin to fuse in front of him to complete the cycle.</br>  <br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o1G<wbr>8xdHC48E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>So, I heard you like Avengers</br></br>  <br>Looks like the cool kids are having fun as usual.</br>  Daily reminder  <br>AUTO PIRRROTO: STANBY !!!</br>  <br><br>whats with Isao and gets?</br></br>  <br>FORCE STRIX PLEASE !!!!!!!!!</br>  <br>What's 顔芸?</br>  <br>Please let this be their oppurtunity to finally finish the Numbers.

We haven't seen Shun's parents at all.</br>  <br> he has yuma's spikes too <br>It's not that bad of a theory.</br></br>  So the edgelord lost against Reiji offscreen?, because we see him doing watever reiji wants after this.  <br>No Reiji said he was Leo's enemy and that was enough for Shun, chances are though he knows he'd lose against Reiji or he wouldn't be so subservient.</br>  <br>probably, it'd be weird if Yuuya doesn't duel him again and make him egao after he grows as a person</br>  <br><br>Im surprised you understood my point even if i forgot the picture.</br></br>  fuck enteme dueling wheres edgy yuya  <br>There is no way a duelist shitter like Kotori gave birth to him. <br><br>Rio on the other hand would make more sense.</br></br></br>  <br>They probably just wrote it in that Kotori eventually got gud offscreen as an apology and/or reference to her VA.</br>  <br>Duelist?</br>  <br>Shitter is probably the worst word associated with YGO ever and NTR is associated with it at times.</br>  why is yuya so cute  <br>What's the matter? Did the older boys at your locals call you that when you went there with your ojama deck?</br>  <br>No, it's just a dumb word for people who don't want to articulate why the person is bad for using X deck and just assumes anyone not using Nekroz or Shaddolls is a bad player, or in the extreme case, anyone but themselves. Also did you just shittalk Ojamas, they may be a bad and cheap deck, but Ojamas are great. Manjoume would be so disappointed in you.</br>  <br>Are you mad because someone called your waifu a shiiter?</br>  Who /xyz/ here?, i just uploaded some epic duel against a fusion scrub.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/K-qLR-uGLWQ  [ ]</br></br>  <br>You're trying to hard there /dng/, at least make a sound argument as to why people are bad. Also I agree, Kotori is a bad duelist, but I don't need to use meme words to get that point across.</br>  <br> Who /xyz/ here? <br><br>Anybody that actually wants to win, because it's become a win condition as opposed to a bonus.</br></br></br>  <br> Kotori <br> duelist </br></br>  <br><br><br>Shadolls and nekroz dont use it quite much.</br></br></br>  <br>I've never been to /dng/ a day in my life so let's get that out of the way first<br><br>You just seem very upset</br></br></br>  <br>Kotori isn't a duelist.

Dropped. </br></br>  <br>Younger isn't necessarily better when Kirika's that young, Maria is really only tall by Japanese standards and both are quite likable now.<br><br>Kirika being cuter and fluffier is only because she's daughter material.</br></br></br>  <br> Elfnein <br> Elnein <br> El Nein <br> El Fine </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gungnir made her look better and also her song was pretty hype</br>  <br> Younger isn't necessarily better when Kirika's in her prime <br>You're making no sense, man.</br></br>  <br> in her prime <br> 16 </br></br>  <br>Yes, well done.</br>  Five hours  <br><br>eeehhh</br></br>  Is Château de Tiffauges just going to be another this thing?  <br>No.</br>  <br>You have to wonder why nobody was questioning Ryoko's sense of interior design.</br>  <br>No, Carol's device will simply dissolve the world like a Noise dissolves a person.</br>  <br>I miss you, faget</br>  <br>That sounds really dramatic and exciting.</br>     yfw autoscorers are activated by some sort of life force harvested by kissing <br> yfw you realised that before Carol activated her first doll, she probably was the one going around kissing bunch of people herself <br> yfw you're now imagining doujins of this </br></br>  <br> violating her privacy <br>She made Elfnein do it.</br></br>  They introduced the idea of "installing" information in a homunculus, so they must be going to do something with it. What?<br><br> Carol's dad never really existed, she was created by the real villain and given false memories of being a little girl with daddy issues so she'd carry out his or her plan </br></br>   TAKANARE   <br>Less 'sexually' attractive. Maria is top tier breeding material, that body is literally asking to get impregnated.</br>  <br>I seriously don't understand how anyone can like Maria even a little bit. Her body is disgusting.</br>  <br>Carol is a cute human girl.</br>  <br>That would kinda make sense. I mean, she's little girl with memories of witch hunting which sounds like idea that died ages ago (unless Symphoverse is weird thing).</br>  <br>Sympho-Europe is supposed to be completely fucked or something.</br>  <br>To each their own.<br> I agree though. </br></br>  <br>Pedophile please go.</br>  <br>G-BEAT</br>  <br> Dark Continent <br>Definitely fucked</br></br>  <br>It could just be all the darkie immigrants.</br>   they need LiNKER <br> they need to repair gears <br> Ver and Ryoko shown working together <br><br>YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The concept art that got posted on twitter they other day called Carol's pipe organ throne by that name.</br>  <br> hiatus continent </br>  <br>Ryoko's coming back!</br>  <br>Ryoko and Kanade can both come back together.</br>  <br><br>Blame Greece.</br></br>  <br>I hope they explain the whole "Dark Continent" business. The EU is apparently still around, so the situation is probably more convoluted than just a return to the dark ages. Besides, London looked fine and the UK is as European as it gets.</br>  <br>UK irl has been trying to get out of the EU for awhile now because even their limey asses can see it is unsustainable.</br>  <br>Post Bikki.</br>      will we ever get a second maria attack card?  <br> UK is as European as it gets. <br>American detected</br></br>  <br>Where are the pedals, keys, and knobs?</br>  <br>For an old hag, yeah.</br>  <br> &gt;inb4 Elfnein becomes Fine and fixes everyone's relics with the Deinsleif blade <br><br>Except Carol wants them to use Dainsleif. Hence the whole setup of hunting down Elfnein without actually trying to kill her. Same with destroying the Gears instead of killing them while having the chance.<br><br>Elfnein is a pawn who is unaware that she's used and a Trojan Horse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of Golden Throne.</br>  <br>No, there is no russian dude in there.</br>  <br> Carol will never wink at you </br>  <br>Why is Hibiki standing there?</br>  <br>If only Greece had the balls to exit the EU, then other countries could follow suit and dismantle this joke.<br><br>Now Greece is going to get bullied harder by Germany and the IMF that Carol by whoever is the true bad guy.</br></br></br>  <br>scale.</br>    <br>Because in few hours Blue will capture her and Carol will mind control her. <br>Or just for scale.</br></br>  <br>But her silly hair is the only thing I like about her.<br>Well, that and KORT EL FES GUNGNIRU, but that's gone by now.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki's dad never really existed, she was created by the real villain and given false memories of being a little girl with daddy issues so she'd carry out his or her plan <br>Fixed.</br></br>  How's S3 so far? I recently watched S2 and it was shit, but S1 was a lot of fun  You know, "overkill size hell" is a pretty ridiculous name for a song. What the hell were they thinking when they came up with it?  <br> overkill size hell <br>Wouldn't Overkill Scythe Hell make more sense?</br></br>  <br>Much better.</br>    <br>It is Scythe. The title was just mistranslated.</br>  <br>There is an actual villain instead of two groups of retards running around for 13 episodes, so it could end up better.</br>  <br>They are having   FUN  </br>  PREVIEW PICS WHEN?  <br>3 hours after the episode airs.</br>  <br> implying <br>I know you Englishmen don't like it, but you really are one of the countries that define Europe. Unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>I bet her henshin has her doing all sorts of yoyo tricks now</br>    <br>I wonder if we'll finally get a Hibiki attack card this season.</br>  <br>The throne is too big for Carol, maybe she wants one of the gears to sit on it to sing the song that end the world.</br>  <br>In around an hour. Fucking BS-11.</br>  SIX YEARS LATER AND I'M STILL MAD AS HELL  So am I.  Still mad thread?<br><br>Pic related and Mahoromatic S2 end never ceases to annoy me.</br></br>  What about still sad?  <br><br>That's what you get for failing to save the best girl.</br></br>  <br>FUCK YOU, NOW I WISH THIS MEMORY WAS PLASTIC</br>    <br><br>Cal best girl. Shame they didn't go with her ending.</br></br>    <br>I'm only mad at how fucking terrible the second half was.</br>  <br> still posting the shitty version </br>  <br>That version is shitty too.

I'll have to one of these days because Eva is one of my favourites, but apparently it's fanfic tier, so it's sitting on my backlog. I'll wait until they're all done to binge watch them probably.<br> Implying they'l ever stop doing them because it prints money </br></br>  <br>To be honest there were less than ten thousand votes. So it isn't really the general opinion.</br>  <br> I didn't watch them <br>Wise choice</br></br>  <br>The criteria is 'impactful endings', not 'sad'.</br>   Women <br> Naruto #5 <br> Evangelion not even in top 10 <br><br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br>  Let's do our own vote, /a/. <br><br>Only had 30 options max though<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/5014739</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M5j<wbr>6ZvLBzPw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> (Pick one) <br>fuck</br></br>  <br>People just voted for their favorite series, pretty much.</br>  <br>Not really, some of them spent their votes as a joke.<br>See: school days</br></br>   list by anime fans who didn't watch any anime and randomly pick recent shit like Ghoul   <br> People are actually voting for Code Geass </br>  <br>I'm cut between LoGH and NGE but if it's strictly the ending then I guess NGE wins.</br>  <br> trying to fit in by hating code geass <br> frogposter <br>Not surprised.</br></br></br>   Code Geass <br> Good <br>kek, it's a 6/10 at most.</br></br>  <br><br>We heard you the first time friend.</br></br>  <br>I don't hate Code Geass, I was on /a/ when it was airing and enjoyed the shit out of it. It's just nowhere near on the artistic or intellectual level of earlier works which it is entirely inferior and derivative to. That people find its rather melodramatic and contrived ending to be the most impactful is most regretful since it indicates to me that the current, younger and new generation userbase of this board has never watched anything pre-2007.<br><br>Also<br> Randomly slagging of Pepe </br></br></br></br>  <br>Name a better ending than code geass. Go.</br>    <br>Look at how shit that list is<br><br>I didn't know Japs were so dumb I'm quitting being a weeb</br></br></br>  School Days was, is and always will be the Evangelion of the harem genre  <br>Clannad's ending is not every impactful. The thing that impacts is what happens before, the ending is just deus ex machina.</br>  <br>Evangelion<br>Cowboy Bebop<br>Gunbuster<br>Madoka<br>LOTGH<br>Gurren Lagann - Lagann-hen<br>Mobile Suit Gundam<br>Eureka Seven</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice meme argument, you sure schooled me</br>  <br>Swing and a miss.</br>  <br>and Evangelion was, the School days of the Mecha genre.</br>  <br>We can agree to disagree then</br>  <br>10/10 filename<br><br><br> frogposter complains about muh arguements </br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually wrote text explaining my argument though alongside the meme image</br>  <br> sex &amp; death psychology </br>  <br>and it was shit</br>  Is it okay if I watch anime in public?    I don't think anyone would care if an asian manlet would watch chinese cartoons on a bus, train, in a library or while walking.    <br>Women yak about Kendra<br>[who, in my opinion, NEEDS continual beatings],<br>so why not?<br>They used to sell Aqua Teen Hunger Force T-shirts @ Hot Topic, so why not?<br>America has Early Cuyler, u mean to tell me there's no place in our culture for Ika Musume?<br>YOU SHOULD WATCH ANIME IN PUBLIC.<br>FUCK EM IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  In public like in a bus, or at the airport? Sure, unless it features girls of questionable ages being harrased by fat, sweaty and balding dude. <br>In public as in a restaurant with friends? No. Not because it's an anime but because it's rude to stare at your phone when hanging out with people. <br>I don't umderstand whar problem do people have with the first option though. Nobody gives a flying fuck about what another random bloke is checking out on his phone and besides it's still better than reading those god awful 50 shades of shit books</br></br>  Ok /a/ I just finished watching Oreimo. Now I can understand the OP from the last thread still being mad as shit.  Kyosuke rejecting all the girls and breaking social norm just to be "lovers for a limited time" and "enjoy themselves to the fullest" (which by the way never get to see) until both graduate? Then we get one kiss and they break up?  What the actual fuck? The ending was really unsatisfactory and I'm buttmad. The only thing that relieved some butthurt is this trivia from the wiki  Based off of the interviews with the author, it seems that Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship with each other truly has not ended. <br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-------------------------<br><br>Some minor questions the LN- and Mangafags maybe able to solve:<br><br>S02E08:  Kyosuke is wounded for some reason and being treated by Kirino. How did that happen? <br><br>S02E12:  Ayase goes back home from Kyousuke's apartment and someone takes photos of her? What was that about? <br><br> Why was Kanako part of his harem? They rarely interacted together and I never saw any hints? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Well you already are aware of the author's intent, so I guess just be mad at censorship?  <br> "enjoy themselves to the fullest <br>Watch the BD specials.<br> Then we get one kiss and they break up? <br>Fushimi had to end it that way because of retarded jap censorship. They actually stay together which is already really clear if you've read the LNs and it's confirmed by a short story and several interviews.<br> Ayase goes back home from Kyousuke's apartment and someone takes photos of her? What was that about? <br>A stalker, the anime teased it but then didn't adapt the scene from the novels. She's an obsessed girl, Kyousuke eventually solves that problem when he was living with Ayase. A big reason she realised that she loves him.<br> Why was Kanako part of his harem?  <br>Yeah, that was kinda stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well said and agreed.</br>  <br>The author wanted an incest ending but freaked up and didn't go for it. <br><br>All the girls were popular with the fans, so he copypasted several arcs from the visual novels here and there to satisfy everyone, just cutting off the ending when Kyosuke ended with other girls. The result, obviously, is a mess.<br><br>The thing is especially noticeable with Kanako because, being it laziness or lack of time, he just cut off all the romance development and went directly for the last scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyousuke and Kanako had more scenes together in the LN, but they mostly revolved around the fact that Kanako's a smoker, which isn't shown in the anime.</br>  Happy birthday Akari!  Just let him rot, guys. Let him spew his nonsense and he'll go away.  <br>I didn't see any answers that'd explain why you are posting strange opinions in a wrong place.<br> Only to every single time having a retardet moe fun comming into the thread, calling everything shit and claiming his superior tase <br>I'm not even going into grammar because that is sort of a low blow, but it seems you make huge generalizations. Only reason why anyone would defend moe is as counter reaction for your "moe is cancer kill yourself I only watch deep anime for deep people such as myself" posting. Not to mention I don't believe a person that has been here a year is entitled to make any kind of generalizations.<br><br>Some people like comedy with cute girls Now get out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anyone would defend moe is as counter <br><br>Actually that is not true, you can see it everyday. Also 2nd thing, I never posted in this thread what you quoted or said shit about the genre, what I was pointing out here is how one sided moe fans are while they cannot even deal with same aproach themeselves. Imply less before you make more accusations</br></br></br>  <br> I was pointing out here is how one sided moe fans are while they cannot even deal with same aproach themeselves <br>So you shitposted ironically? Sasuga anon, you really went all out.</br></br>  Let's just honor Akari until we hit the image limit.
