Why would they change that anyway? It's the big reveal of vol. 1.</br></br>  <br>Already dead</br>  <br>Will they kill the dog today ?<br>I hope they change some part of OP again.</br></br>  <br><br>I think he meant "is she a zombie or dead?"</br></br>  <br>Well the grave on the roof has her hair ribbon on it, so I think they already killed her in the anime (unless it's an empty grave)</br>  <br>It has that ribbon from the first time it appears in the manga, too<br>It's WAY too shallow to be anything but a symbolic grave anyway</br></br>  <br>Oh, I didn't notice it in the manga. She is probably in the basement then</br>  <br>So are you exited or annoyed?<br><br><br>Found it weird how Kurumi screamed when she killed the zombie last episode. In the manga she doesn't which makes her seem more experienced, someone the others can rely one.<br><br>Also I love those colored pages, have the others?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also I love those colored pages, have the others? <br>first page of each chapter's a colored pic.

Last week it didn't for me but one in the links beneath worked, yet everybody was in the connectcast chat. What gives?</br>  <br>I had the same problem, dunno why.</br>  <br>get in linux</br>  <br>another channel i dont even know, and nothing even works on this shit cc</br>  So when will shovel-chan get bit  by Zombie Megu-nee  and had to be put down?  <br>connectcast.tv/linux2ink</br>  <br>Maybe it isn't</br>  <br>thanks</br>  What channel is it on BETV?  <br>It says it is offline<br>What the hell?</br></br>    <br>+1</br>  <br>Really, faggot? I never even heard of this channel and found in in 5 seconds using what was said in this thread and google. Why spoonfeed retards that can't even do that?</br>  <br>It's not</br>  <br>Thanks fag now its gonna go offline</br>  <br>It doesn't work like that, faggot</br>  All this Megu-nee is bad for my heart.  So this is just gonna be a fucking flashback episode, huh? Guess we'll have to wait for next week for the bathroom scene.    <br>I don't understand <br>I keep refreshing it but it just says the channel is currently offline.</br></br>   Anime original content <br><br>For what purpose<br>How far is this adaption going to reach</br></br></br>    <br>Should have really expected that when it's titled "Back Then" or whatever.</br>  <br>Thank you based spoonfeeder</br>   megu-nee episode <br>What a waste of ep3. They should have delivered the exciting parts as soon as possible.<br>That's why it will fail.</br></br>    <br> Complaining about the anime expanding on canon </br>  <br>Some channels are fucked up like that, no idea why. Maybe it limit viewers.</br>  Oh snap it's this moment  All that blur.  Did the bathroom scene not happen?    <br>They better still do graduation. I'm fine with anime original content, but not at the expense of the best manga scenes. <br><br>They'll still have room if they cut out the mall, but I'm starting to think that between the Kurumi being bit arc, whatever they're gonna do with the dog, and a potential mall flashback they won't have room for helicopter of graduation.</br></br></br>    <br>This episode is just a flashback to z-day told from Megu-nee's perspective. Expect bathroom next week.</br>  rip stream  <br>It's not entirely anime original though, is it? I mean they didn't show anything in the manga, but I remember a few lines about when this happened.</br>  <br><br>Thus it came to pass.</br></br>  <br>That was just the first half though. Bathroom might be in the second half, would make sense to make the first part Megu-nee centered.</br>    <br>This ep is chapter 4 + a flashback to the outbreak it seems. It kinda fits though. They're expanding a lot on Megu-nee's character for next episode, at this pace though they won't make it to graduation for sure.</br>  Rip GG.<br>The anime will fail hard. Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3.</br>  Fuck this shit.  <br>Who would kill the stream. CC allows anime, only thing that could happen is this thread could be deleted for advertising/</br>  that bedroom eyes  <br> Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3. <br>You want them to adapt the basement arc now? That wouldn't fit at all with the pacing and would be sorely out of place without developing all the characters first.</br></br>  Screen getting distorted big time.  Are we going to do this every single episode?<br><br> WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH </br></br>  gay  <br>It's your delusions breaking.<br>The stream never existed.</br></br>  <br>Is this your first day on /a/ faggot?</br>  Wasn't a terrible episode, but was kinda lackluster. I appreciate the expanded setting though.  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  <br>so yuriii!</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH   Kei in the preview <br>wat</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  Next week is fucking Kei.<br>They're not gonna show the bathroom scene till episode 6 at this fucking rate.<br><br>GG GG</br></br></br>    <br>The viewers wanted to see it delivered in this ep.<br>It doesn't sell as is so they needed to do something about it.<br>Now many people will just drop it and bam it will fail the sales.</br></br></br>  They really want this series to flop, don't they?  The first half was extremely boring and unnecessary. Why even cut out plot parts if you're replace them with this shit.<br>At least we got a bloody shovel this time, I guess.</br>  <br>MIKI A BEST</br>  It was alright. I think I've become too accustomed to episode 3 of any given manga being the episode where they drop the hammer.<br><br>It's pretty clear they did this episode to make it  seem like Megu-nee is actually alive.  If they did the twist this episode, it wouldn't have as much impact for anime-only watchers as it would now.<br><br>KEI NEXT EPISODE (wait, what)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>Still best girl</br>  <br> no neet comments about the zombie apocalypse flying through the screen </br>  <br> any given manga <br><br>Anime, obviously. Are we actually getting the mall episode next week? Flashbacks on top of flashbacks would be a bit too much I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's see anon<br>Be sure to be here when the sales data is released</br></br>  SHUT THE FUCK UP FAGGOTS, Gakkou is still AOTS stop hating on new things that develop the setting more  Bathroom + Kei flashback next episode.<br><br>Mark my words.</br></br>  <br>That's Youtube.</br>    <br>There may not be mall anymore.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> getting this buttflustered that manga fans are comparing the adaptation to the source material <br>Go back to reddit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you fuck off back to MAL or whatever</br>  <br>Seems like too much for a single episode. I have no idea how they're planning on going with the show at this pace. I don't dislike it though, in fact I thought animating the rooftop scene was very nice.</br>  <br>Thank you anon!</br>  The last scene had Megunee writing in the basement. Must find it earlier in this adaptation.<br><br>They're shuffling things around enough that mangafags won't be bored with a straight adaptation at least.</br></br>  <br>"It's different, therefore bad." is not a criticism that should ever be entertained.</br>  <br>Anime original end, the heli gonna rescue them.</br>  <br>It should just have followed the manga<br>It's always like this when they mess with something just werks and fuck up it hard.<br>You knoe no one gives a fuck about megu-nee or her relationships with her students<br>People were in it for the suffering and it didn't deliver it at ep 3.<br>Also they fucked up Kurumi's character quite a bit by making her butchering the senpai just like that.<br>What a disappointment.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So It's confirmed that before the outbreak happened, Yuki was bullied and depressed. Adds a lot more weight to some things in the manga such as Yuki commenting how bullies are bad.<br><br>I'm calling it right here, Yuki will be the one to save the school life club by using past rage/stress from bullying after seeing the uni girls/bikers 'bully' the club, drawing first human blood.</br></br>  So are thy gonna just skip Miki's character arc? I know she isn't the most relevant one of the main four but still, she's a cute character.  <br>Well, if the scene with Megu writing in the basement was based on this moment here, then bathroom is pretty much right after that.</br>  <br> this entire post </br>  At least we know now how sempai got into the roof with them.<br><br>If it was a 1:1 adaptation we'd never know.<br><br>Think about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe there is a small change that this will be one of those split cours. They usually don't announce this from the very beginning. I don't know how much manga material there is, though.</br>  <br>No one is bored watching the shit even if it's 1:1 adaptation source material.<br>It's like you don't know anything about the animefags</br></br>  <br>If my opinion as a mangafag was relevant for the author, I'd have prefered to be a straight adaptation considering wha he has done so far. I don't know he thinks what he has done so far was a good idea, but hopefully the sale will give him a hint.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the fucking preview?</br>  <br>Maybe because this isn't a straight adaptation we'll find out how Megu-nee got infected.</br>  <br>You mean the sales of the manga that have more than doubled after an almost entirely anime original first episode?<br><br>Yeah, maybe that was a big hint for him.</br></br></br>  All the changes aren't all that bad. I just hope they don't fuck up pic related.  <br>No, the anime sales.</br>  <br>I don't come from anywhere else though anon.<br><br>People haven't been saying it's bad because it's different though. You sound like one of those retards that think any criticism is shitting on something</br></br></br>  <br>You know that the anime sales are barely relevant so long as the manga gets a big boost (which it has), right?</br>  <br>Yes it is. Changes are always bad and should never be accepted.</br>  If this anime aired 10-12 years ago then people would like the changes, because of the novelty it delivers I think but now it is no more the case.<br>The changes are triggering the people.<br>And tbh they are a bit not good...</br></br>  <br>I'm aware, but I can see how this is going to be irrelevant to the nips as soon as the anime ends, and therefore the manga sales will come back to usual.</br>  <br> And tbh they are a bit not good... <br>Is English your first language?</br></br>  <br> tbh <br>Nice meme.</br></br>   I don't really like the small changes they put into the anime but it is still watchable. The manga is still better but I'd continue to watch the anime nonetheless because I got nothing else better to do; just an opinion of mine. <br><br>Any changes to the opening? I missed it.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting mangafag.</br>  <br>It could also be that the anime will sell good. You usually don't see high pre-order numbers during the first weeks unless it is some really big hype like Fate stuff or something. Barely anybody even knew GG before so it will take a time until people start consider buying this and they'll probably wait anyway to see how well the adaption works. Maybe it will rise when the important/suffer scenes will happen in the upcoming episodes.</br>  muh subs when?  <br>Well it wasn't Taroumaru since they still have him.</br>  <br>There'll be about 40 chapters out when the anime ends, but the best stopping point is in chapter 30, so we'd need a snail's pace and lots of original content to adapt less than 2 chapters per episode for it to last that long. Which is exactly what is happening right now, so you might be on to something.<br><br> split cour <br> second half airs in winter <br> ends at graduation <br> by that time there's almost enough material out for another cour <br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I see barely anyone even complains about the changes themselves. Most anons only fear the shortness of the anime (one cours) and that they won't be able to adapt the important stuff that happens later.</br>  <br>I'm not saying it won't sell well, it's just that it won't be a big deal if/when it doesn't because it's already a success at what it was made for.<br><br>It's not as if it's an anime original that's relying on anime sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Reason for spoiler tag.</br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/666<wbr>92<br><br> Japan is laughing at us again </br></br></wbr>  Are they?<br>I can't particularly tell what they're saying at all.</br>  <br>They're laughing at us because Gangsta is the most highly rated anime in the west this season, even though it's dogshit.</br>  <br>A lot of the comments seem to be about Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. What are they saying about that?</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>They are saying it figures a show like that would be popular in the west, but all I see are compliments for Gangsta. Then they're mostly curious as to why Gakkou Gurashi and Monster Musume aren't rated higher.<br><br><br>They're calling that one shit though.</br></br></br></br>  The only thing worth laughing about here is Japan's declining birth-rate.    <br>Why is Yuno so mean in that image?</br>  <br>Not their inherent shit taste?</br>  <br>Yeah, this is what I thought was going on. All I saw was them saying that Gangsta has a western atmosphere, so it's expected.</br>  <br> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime <br> They're calling that one shit though. <br>For what reason?</br></br></br>  <br>I may be an old man but I like Akagami.<br><br>Akagami? Never heard of it. It even airing?<br><br>Curious I checked their homepage but when I saw "series composition: Akao Deko" I immediately closed the page.</br></br></br></br></br>  They're also wondering how we're dealing with the puns in shimoneta  Gangsta is the best show this season. them nips be trippin   I thought Westerners liked zombies, why isn't Gurashi higher? <br> I guess they just like gangstas more </br>    <br>II don't know what anyone translating it to, as I never checked it out but, someone should tell them "poorly".</br>  ＞ｂａｋａ　ｇａｉｊｉｎ　ｎｏｔ　ｒａｉｋｕ　ＲＡＢＵ　ＲＡＩＢＵ   they can stomach the garbage that is Seraph because of Shinoa huh <br><br>LOL</br></br>  <br>Yaraonfags hate shoujo, shoujo is always under their radar, they like muh dark, ecchi, twist, waifuwars etc</br>  <br>A lot of people hate shoujo.

Gangsta probably wouldn't be first but it's up there.</br>  <br> Gangsta. 8.28 <br>How can taste be so shit?</br></br>  <br>How ironic.</br>  <br> Overlord 7.82 <br> SHIT TASTE <br>Are you one of those guys who thinks that Overlord is a SAO ripoff?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Is pretty unpopular for a fujoshit marketed shounen since those tend to sell like hot pancakes it also gets barely any fan art in both pixiv or Twitter<br><br>Judging by how Kekkai became popular among fujos instead they prefer more subtle approaches when it comes to their pandering</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck.</br>  <br>Your mother.</br>  <br> being surprised that they eat up harems </br>  <br> Gangsta <br>Boring show with no substance, only muh action scenes<br> Charlotte <br>It has Maeda's name on it, so it was bound to get high scores despite being dogshit so far.<br> Shimoneta <br>Absolute trash "comedy" that's 90% unfunny sex jokes.<br> Classroom Crisis <br>An actually good show showing idealism vs. realism and good corporate drama. Gets low scores because MAL hates good anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they know the the MonMusu manga is pretty popular over here, which is why they might be surprised.</br>  <br>Gaijins aren't allowed to post.</br>  <br>I don't even know if you are saying it's good or bad.<br>It isn't, just like SAO.</br></br>  <br>i gave monstershow benefit of the doubt, downloaded it and noped the fuck out 2 minutes in after seeing a dude get constricted by a giant snake while sleeping. im a full grown man but that shit gave me nightmares.</br>  <br>SAO isn't bad though.</br>  <br>They probably prefer the manga since the anime actually made the story straighter.</br>  <br> Gangsta <br> 8 <br><br>What the FUCK? Yes they can laugh</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's basically furfag/horsefucker shit, but in anime format.</br>   yaraon <br> eating up the same "little girls with a dark tweeest" anime <br> laughing at others shit taste </br></br>  <br>I was going to call out your ignorance and shit taste (outside of Charlotte), but that Classroom Crisis gave me a chuckle. 6/10</br>  <br> because MAL hates good anime. <br><br>Nobody gives a shit about Classroom Crisis over here, does it mean we do have shit taste as well? Sore wa shokku.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's horrible.</br>  <br>It is though. From the very beggining. Through and through.</br>  <br>Gurashi is good.<br><br> YYY was incredibly overrated though. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Everyone dropped the show on the first episode but it's gotten really good. I'm sure the other 5 anons who are watching it will agree with me.</br></br>  <br>Do you really have to ask?</br>  <br>Just like Overlord.</br>  <br> &gt;eating up the same "little girls with a dark tweeest" anime <br> implying there's anything wrong with that <br><br>Outside of their insane addiction to Love Live, Yaraon is a carbon copy of /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br> does it mean we do have shit taste as well? <br>I don't know how new you have to be to not be aware that /a/ has shit taste as well.<br><br>Anyway, Classroom Crisis is good.</br></br></br></br>  Implying if /a/ scored their anime, the ratings and ranking would be any different.   Japan literally wonders why moe and monster girls aren't out selling death note 2.0 <br><br>Well. Give us any of the following; yuru yuri, yuyushiki, kokkuri-san and moe ratings will rise. <br><br>Give us a monster girl quest anime adaption and you can get Horo 2.0 on the rise as well. Someone should really make me a CEO of anime or something I just solved all the western problems nippon faces.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would spam votes to Symphogear or Gakkou Gurashi to avoid that.</br>  <br>I'm saying that Overlord is nothing like SAO, it's actually good and deserve to be ranked high.<br><br><br>Nice shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They have simple taste, which is why they like kid's shows like symphogear <br><br>Is this dumb shit serious?</br></br></br>  <br>Mass spam would happen and all the voting would be skewed.</br>  <br> They have simple taste, which is why they like kid's shows like symphogear <br> Do they buy discs? No? Then who cares <br>This is funny because out of 39anime I'm watching this season I'm buying only Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not though, it does its job very well for the genres it covers.</br></br>  <br>Anon 2 here, I agree.</br>  <br><br> manga is pretty popular over here <br>I seriously thought that it was maybe 5 vocal fans that kept those shitty threads alive<br><br><br> Same<br/> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why the proxyfags are here to save the day.<br><br>Besides.<br> thinking Gangsta would be at the very top if it was an /a/ poll <br>Hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Give us a monster girl quest anime adaption <br>Please don't.</br></br>  <br>Which is what I said. Did you even follow the chain?</br>  <br><br>Strawpoll has a captcha version now, not to mention using google's poll.</br></br>  <br> I seriously thought that it was maybe 5 vocal fans that kept those shitty threads alive <br><br>This is how you spot a newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>It is pretty popular as a whole judging by how it represented in media, of course the anime is not as popular as Kekkai anime, but Seraph manga still sold better than Kekkai, you can't judge popularity based on disk sell or fanarts alone there is those people who doesn't have money to buy the expensive BDs or have time or like to draw.</br>  <br> It isn't 100% set inside a school/academy <br> it's probably a kids shows then <br><br>Sasuga nips</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's actually good and deserve to be ranked high. <br><br> typing this while talking about others having shit taste </br></br></br>   people go to MAL for anything other than reverse searching what the english title would be   Yeah Japan is the one who thinks Psycho Pass is a good anime.<br><br>Doesn't give Kokkuri-San an S2.<br><br>Abandons Saori Hayami.<br><br><br>Fuck JAPAN.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't call it really good yet but it's shaping up well. Each episode was better than the previous so far.</br>  <br>Mate you're on 4chan do you think that could possibly stop anything?</br>  <br> Classroom Crisis <br> Good <br>Thanks for the laugh anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Akagami no Shirayukihime and Charlotte would undoubtedly near the top.</br>  <br>What, you mean the harem genre? Because that would be shit like Tenchi. MMO? .hack, Log Horizon, and even Overlord is better. Romance? It's shit tier in that department.<br><br>So again, what does SAO do very well in?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry anon it has been years since the release. I am sure it is safe to mention it on a korean picture website.</br>  <br> buying anime </br>  <br>Lelouch, you are in no position to insult them.</br>  <br>Then you probably weren't in the threads because a lot of people agree the anime was in fact gayer, not to mention how the manga markets Shinoa as the third most important character in the series(she has the second most screentime after MC), while the anime markets Guren and Ferid above her in importance just so they can market them to fujos in posters</br>  <br>I use it to check voice actors</br>  <br>It does all that shit very well except the romance garbage, never said it was the best though.</br>  <br>Yeah, we're all hackers on steroids here amirite?

I have a bunch of anime that's out of print. If I so chose I could sell them for a nice profit.</br>  <br>Little girls with a dark twist is a fun type of show though.</br>  <br>It is literally the worst MMO based show, and the harem is shit because Asuna wins but it still pretends the girls have a chance.<br><br>I guess it looked pretty good, that's really the only thing it has going for it.</br></br></br>  <br> does MMO very well <br> special snowflake gary stu solo gamer <br><br>Correction.

Overrated as fuck but I wouldn't call it bad  <br>Well, MAL likes it so it's safe to assume it's bad, perhaps we should start false flagging and making threads like we do with Steins;Gate, AnoHana or Clannad.</br>  <br>What, did you lose your periods or something?</br>    <br> no non non biyori <br> gakkou gurashi that low <br><br>I am glad western market is irrelevant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I read plot synopsis of shows there and keep my backlog up to date.

MAL != "us".</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Hibikek is the AOTS and I am not even a yurifag.</br>  <br> sequels <br>Guess what, unless the new season is utter shit, only those who liked the first and/or second one will watch the new one, meaning high scores are a given</br></br>  <br><br> It's meant to be trite shit! <br><br>Fans are terrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, they're doing something very wrong if it's not meant to be shit.</br>  <br>No shit, but how the hell are Japanese able to find that out?</br>  <br> MAL != "us" <br><br>Good joke.</br></br></br>   Last season was so bad that Kyoani, Gainax car ad and Bones' corpse are all AOTS   <br> Gainax car ad <br><br>The five guys who watched it screaming AOTS don't count.</br></br></br>   one guy thinks foreigners should've had monster musume as a favorite <br> another one thinks it should be gurashi <br> another thinks its overlord <br><br>They are not actually far-off.<br>Also, do they have the 'mainstream' mentality there?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bones' corpse are all AOTS <br>I really hope you are talking about Show By Rock! m8.</br></br>  <br>It's not meant to be shit <br><br>It's over the top and funny, GX also has some great fight choreography and a budget. People like Symphogear because the first season started out as some grimdark MS with suffering death and people vomiting gallons of blood. Then midway through the season the studio changed and it turned into a sentai show that didn't take itself seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>This year, I think I might be able to stop watching these Chinese cartoons</br>  <br>Anime to them is like dr.who to us. Even if you don't watch it. It is so engrained in the culture that you recognize the name.</br>  <br>I forgot that even existed, so no. Kekkai Sensen lacked everything that makes a show like that good.<br>The ONLY good thing, oozing with style, was the ED.</br></br>  <br>GX is definitely the best symphogear so far.<br>Watching it reminded me of watching A's years ago.</br></br>  <br>Pleiades was legit good though, it even had the old scientifically-accurate shtick that Gainax liked</br>  <br> is like dr.who to us <br>Dr. who?</br></br>  <br><br><br>S2 &gt; s1 &gt; s3<br><br>Fight me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After the terrible last couple of seasons, I almost did. This season though, is hitting all the right places.</br>  <br><br>A's is far better, though.</br></br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  <br>Dog Days syndrome?</br>  They are not laughing at us, they understand and a lot say that they are fed up with low level, vaguely ecchi comedy too.  <br>im not surprised that Gangsta is doing well in the west. Just like how Cowboy Bebop bombed in Japan but was anime of all time in the west, same with Black Lagoon.</br>  <br>Tell me one thing you didn't like about it</br>  <br>There is slight difference between Gangsta and Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon. Last two werent complete shit.</br>   MAL    tfw forced to hate Gangsta since normies like it   <br>No they're all shit<br>Or they all aren't shit<br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't make it trough the first episode. It was unoriginal and really childish. I have nothing against shows targeted at children but it was for the wrong kind of children.</br>  <br>The characters were completely bland especially Subaru and Minato, Aoi was annoying, the first four or five episodes were really slow and a chore to watch, it didn't get interesting until episode 10.</br>  <br>Cowboy bebop is over hyped shit and black lagoon sold well because a girl is drinking beer. <br><br>Gangsta will sell well for the same reasons. That OP of dancing hookers and drugs.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you think they are shit, doesn't mean it didn't make a fuck ton of money in the west.<br><br>Gangsta reminds me a lot of Black Lagoon, so again it surprises me none that it does well in the West. Cowboy Bebop shares a lot of things that both shows do as well in terms of character types, people they surrounded with, etc. Though I will agree Cowboy bebop does a lot of this but is done a lot better.</br></br></br>  <br> Just like how Cowboy Bebop bombed in Japan <br><br>It didn't though.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Compared to how it did in the west? It did.<br><br>Thats why CN was able to pick it up dirt cheap.</br></br></br>  <br>S2 was kind of a joke with the cartoony evil Sugita voiced villain.<br>GX started with a bang with the alchemist faction dolls fighting the sympho girls. My only complain is Miku turning into a stay home wife instead of becoming one of the symphogear user.</br></br>  <br> sell <br>They are popular but they don't sell<br>Expect negative numbers for Gangsta</br></br></br>  <br>They are not laughing, but only praising Gangsta. A lot.</br>  <br><br> genuine Gangsta fags </br></br>  <br><br>Top pleb.</br></br>  <br>Oh good, I though I was reading it wrong.</br>  <br>Is Gangsta really that good though?<br><br>The only thing that was really interesting there is the fact that one of the MCs is deaf and the scientist dude. Other than that, it's been really fucking tepid.</br></br></br>  <br> it didn't get interesting until episode 10. </br>  <br>That anon can't into moon see they aren't saying it's bad<br>Also<br> Cowboy Bebop <br> bombed </br></br></br></br>  <br>I can guarantee it isn't childish at all, and while I wouldn't call it dark it become quite melancholic by the end <br><br><br>Fair enough, I wouldn't call them bland though since they all had nicely fleshed out personalities and issues <br><br>The show was low-key and slowly moving with no giant outbursts of emotion or drama</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're actually retarded.</br>  <br>I don't understand what I'm supposed to see interesting here<br>I understand you like the series but it was really bad</br></br>  <br>im the 2nd anon you quoted there. I'm not trying to defend it at all. I enjoy it, I think its "alright" and something fun to watch when I want to turn my brain off.<br><br>All I was saying is that its no surprise its popular in the west because it shares a lot of the stuff that is popular in other titles like it, all of which are also popular in the west.</br></br></br>  <br>I should have said too the ending was fine but I didn't really enjoy the series overall.</br>  <br>It's not the best thing I've ever seen, obviously, but as it stands there's no reason for me to HATE it at all. It's worth watching.</br>  <br>Like /a/ already said, it's overrated. That's pretty much it.</br>  <br>its just kinda "meh" - if you liked Black Lagoon you will like Gangsta</br>   KING ARTHUR IS A GIRL! <br><br>What kind of plot is that?</br></br>  <br>Artist calls the shot<br>And when the artist says he wants more girls to draw, he gets more girls to draw</br></br>   implying that had literally anything to do with the plot in either of the routes that matter <br>Fuck off shitposter</br>  <br> the routes that matter <br><br>You mean Fate and HF?</br></br></br>   OP make garbage thread <br><br>What kind of board want that?</br></br>  <br>A plot by a hack, I tell you what.</br>  what a worthless thread  <br> KING ARTHUR IS A GIRL! <br> EMPEROR NERO IS A GIRL! <br> SIR MORDRED IS A GIRL! <br> FRANCIS DRAKE IS A GIRL ON TECHNICALITY! <br> ENKIDU COULD TOTALLY BE A GIRL! <br><br><br>This is not how dumb you sound. This is exactly five times as dumb as you sound. If, say, your dumb circuits had a capacity of something like 5, mine would have to be at least 25. This is the difference between an amateur and a trained professional dumb ass. And that's not even considering the possibility of tapping into the ambient dumb to fuel my idiocy. I could be dumb for hours after you've exhausted the extent of your dumb powers. Given sufficient dumbness I could even probably generate idiocy of sufficient strength to generate a field of pure, infinite moronic retardation, against which you surely would have no defense.<br><br> There's plenty of stupid stuff in Fate, going for Takeuchi's boner for blonde, muscular, svelt Briton chicks with large invisible swords is going for low hanging fruit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What kind of plot is that? <br>The kind that is written to make it more appealing to otaku circa 2004 after the success of Tsukihime. If Fate were written today, Nasu probably would have kept Saber as a male and kept Ayaka as the protagonist like they were in the draft he wrote in collage in order to capitalize on fujobucks.</br></br>  <br>And then Fate/ would be about as popular as Mahoutsukai is today :^)</br>  <br><br>Sure smells like mongrel in here.</br></br>  <br>How do the prototypes compare to the finished products in terms of stats?</br>  <br>When Arthur is Manaka's servant he is basically god, except for his luck stat which turns to shit. Based on his luck and Saber Alter's luck when she's partners with Sakura I think having an evil master slaughters your luck stat. His Excaliblasts is more powerful than Arturia's, but can only be used if the enemy is stronger then him, like Gil or Ozzy. <br>Proto-Gil may look cooler, but F/SN Gil has better stats and Ea is significantly better then Enki.<br>Proto-Lancer has better stats than F/SN Lancer, but that might just be from having Proto-Rin as his master.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually this is better than the current one.</br>  <br>Gil looks like such a dork. By the way, why do animu elevens wear towels in the water?</br>  <br>Don't forget Jack the Ripper who's a loli.</br>  <br>It's almost like a set-up for porn.<br>Oh, wait.</br></br>  <br>Come back to me when there's a single adaptation of the original VN that doesn't either fully tell UBW's story, or cram in elements of UBW regardless.<br><br>It'll be in about 2017, I think.</br></br></br>   proto Arthur got cucked because Lancelot wanted to give hot dickings to Gwen <br><br> Arturia got cucked because Lancelot wanted to be spanked her <br><br>Arturia&gt;Arthur</br></br></br></br>  How do you guys know the real King Arthur wasn't a girl wearing a fake beard, huh smart guys?  <br>its better than king arthur being a blue hedgehog</br>  <br> King Arthur <br> real </br></br>  Cu V EMIYA = Cu wins due to Protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gay Bulge HOWEVER EMIYA can potentially Caladbolg Cu from a long way away.<br>Cu V Gilgamesh = Gilgamesh wins due to Enkidu and probably sword spamming Cu to not let him Gae Bolg.<br>Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them.<br>Gilgamesh V Herakles = Enkidu holds down Herakles pretty damn well, and plus Herakles was protecting Ilya at the time.<br>Medusa V Herakles = I can't see Herakles losing.<br>Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles. On the other, Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe.<br>Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance.<br>Medusa V Iskander = Cybele.

My answer to that is Misaka Mikoto’s troubles here in New Testament 13. <br><br> How far can the title of Academy City’s #3 take her? <br><br> Has she perhaps fallen behind? <br><br> When words like magician and even Magic God are being used like normal, wouldn’t she feel the fear of possibly being left behind and not being able to walk alongside the person she longs for (and had thought she was courageously seeing on his way)? <br><br> And now that the hurdle had been set up, how will she overcome it? There are a number of options there. She could make sure Kamijou can do his best by giving him an everyday life to return to. She could decide everyone has fields they excel in and therefore support him only in the areas where her skills lie. <br><br> But given Mikoto’s nature, I want her to keep at it from head on. I want her to keep running after Kamijou’s back no matter how hopeless or reckless it seems. <br><br> It was those feelings that guided the direction of the story here. How did you like it?  <br>Mikoto will do what she pleases and makes her happy no matter if it's reckless or hopeless. That's a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamachi should really write suffering volumes.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Kamachi didn't confirmed that. Besides, everyone and their mama knows that Touma won't end up with anyone. We will have a status quo ending. So why should people get mad at something they already knows? <br><br>Kamachi's isn't trying to make Mikoto be together with Touma romantic as an end game. You're missing a major reason behind why she wants to chase after him, it isn't simply because of romantic feelings. It's more complicated than that and Kamachi is taking steps to build up for a obvious bro-friend relationship for Touma and Mikoto. Even if she won't end up with him, she'll still be happy come for her acceptance and be the type of girl that sends him on his way with a pat on the back while she stands by his side on the battlefield.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;But given Mikoto’s nature, I want her to keep at it from head on. I want her to keep running after Kamijou’s back no matter how hopeless or reckless it seems. <br>He basically says Mikoto won't give up on catching up with Touma. It's so weird that these haters keep twisting that. What drives these people to such delusions?</br></br>  <br>The only delusion I see is people thinking that somehow means she will succeed.</br>  <br>The only thing haters have left is to twist what Kamachi said despite the fact everything he said is positive for her.<br><br><br> succeed <br>Irrelevant. Kamachi didn't confirm anything regarding that. Go see </br></br></br></br></br>  Always remember that Index is not a romantic light novel but a story of a highschool boy's downfall to darkness (along with other edgy shit Kamachi can offer).   another thread is getting shitted up by Mikotofags and Mikotohaters <br>Why can't we all get hyped about the Dragons/Invisible Thing teasing</br>  <br>It's really not very edgy.</br>  <br>Mikoto was involved and Kamachi confirmed status quo</br>  <br>Who cares. Your "status quo" is irrelevant to the plot.</br>  <br>But it is.</br>  <br>You should be aware by now that half of the people in this threads are just here to shitpost and half of the remainder are only still following for their ships.</br>  <br>Some are here for their their favorite characters</br>  <br>It isn't though.</br>  Let it die please. As quickly as possible. And I hope they animate or at least manga the best parts before it goes  <br><br>It is irrelevant. We're finally heading into Laura vs Aleister territory.<br><br>A lot of speculation regarding Aleister was revealed to be true. For example, how he is someone who had rejected the path to becoming a Magic God. Also, we finally have some sort of clue to the motivations behind his betrayal of magic.<br><br>There's also the part concerning the way the world and destiny works. Now that the gears supporting the world are gone, Aleister should be planning to insert his own gears to further his plan. How did Laura know about Kakeru? If he's her piece, why doesn't he belong to the Anglican Church? Why did she want to take AC in the first place? And then, if Aleister was near the level of a Magic God in the past, how did he get defeated?<br><br>No amount of romance or non-romance will matter in the end-game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Do you remember the life that was taken by destiny as if to smash the childish gears of a desire to make the world a better place and to save every last member of the human race? Do you remember my daughter’s name?” <br> I have a boner. Based Aleister.</br>  <br>Magic Gods being taken out of the picture is still part of Aleister's Keikaku, meaning Kamisato's interference didn't really matter. Even if Laura laughed at the prosepect of Aleister's ignorance regarding WR's existence, it's still all going according to plan, unless there's something more about WR's power's than what was shown to us. <br><br>Nepthys told Kamijou that WR is a power that "exiles" MG's, meaning they could be far from dead, but are in another place, this so called "paradise" as Kamisato had said, giving them the feeling of salvation. That or they really died from the guy's two fingers entering their bodies.</br></br></br>  From the way Kamisato's power sounds, I have the feeling that if he uses on Othinus she will just pop-up right next to Touma, since that is her "salvation".  <br>It exiles gods to their ideal phase of the world, since there are no parallel dimensions.</br>  <br> And wouldn't the current phase be Othinus's ideal phase of the world?<br> After all, her goal was to reach her phase to find someone who could understand her, but she found it in this phase.</br></br>   All those Magic God's whose names were only mentioned and the ones who were only barely mentioned <br> Fuck you Kamachi.</br>  <br>So they're in another layer of the world, to which they could feel at peace? Wouldn't that be heaven or sort of like that?</br>   The Magic God tried to speak a single word. <br><br> If the speed of sound had been just a little faster, he would have said that word: sorry. <br><br>We barely knew ye, High Priest, uho hoi ;_;</br></br></br></br>  Fucking Kamisato casually destroying 20 magic gods at once.   Raise your hand if you thought the fight against the Magic Gods would continue a lot longer than this! <br> KAMAAAACHIIIIIIII</br>  <br>From the framerate comparison, it looks more like he sent them to detached planes floating in higher-dimensional space. Like if 3D space was curving around like a piece of crumpled paper, there would be detached pieces of paper unconnected to and suspended "above" the 3D plane we live in. Instead of being alternate worlds, they are just parts of the world unreachable by normal means and hidden in the folds of spacetime. Or quite literally, "between the lines".</br>  <br>The way WR "erases" their existence is suspect, especially since Kakeru was able to seemingly produce that one Magic God's left arm from thin air. Maybe he's literally sucking them into his hand, and can spit them out anytime? Is Laura actually collecting Magic Gods to do her bidding?</br>  <br> WR can absorb and release Magic Gods <br> its revealed IB does the same thing <br> Touma starts releasing all the bullshit magic and esper powers he has been absorbing since before this series even began <br> And that's how Kamijou Touma became king of the world.</br></br></br></br>   “I am the kind of normal high school boy you can find anywhere.”  <br>Fucking Kamachi.exe, that ending was satisfying.</br>  <br>I don't want Touma to become king of the world, I want him to stay as a normal high school boy</br>  <br>I don't get it, why can't he be king of the world and be a normal high school boy?</br>  <br>Because king of the worlds aren't normal, so he'd just be a high school boy at most</br>   Nuit <br> Misaka is Aleister's surrogate daughter. </br>  Demon king Touma is only a matter of time now.  “World Rejecter has shown up.”<br><br>The answer to his confusion was far too incomplete.<br><br>However, the words still stabbed into his heart.<br><br>“If Kamisato Kakeru is ‘exiling’ all of the Magic Gods, then wouldn’t Othinus be in trouble too?”<br><br><br>Touma ain't happy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kamijou had been unsteady on his feet after the previous battle, but she felt him moving slightly while still resting on her shoulder. He silently reached up as if to grab the giant falling comet with his right hand. <br> She could not tell what meaning there was in that. <br> The boy himself probably could not explain what was hidden there. <br> “You…?” <br> She asked a pure question. <br> She was answered by an ominous cracking sound. It came from the body of the boy who was right next to her yet seemed impossibly far away. <br> —It honestly doesn’t matter to me who the hero is. <br> After everything that had happened, it was only now that Mikoto truly felt fear. <br> —As long as everything’s been resolved, I couldn’t ask for anything more. <br> She felt fear rising from the pit of her stomach. <br> —So… So Misaka, this didn’t need a hero. <br> All the while, she heard the intermittent sound of cracks running through something. <br> —It ended without losing anyone and that’s all that matters. <br> Specifically, it came from the boy’s right arm.  <br><br><br> (What…was that?) <br> At the very end, she had heard a sound from the boy who was leaning on her shoulder. <br> (What in the world was that?) <br> There should not have been anything they could have done. <br> There was no way she could have used her power as the #3 to intercept that one hundred meter comet approaching at max speed. That boy seemed to have something sleeping inside him that could endure even her power, but it should not have been able to do anything there. <br> It should not have been able to. <br> But in that final moment, the boy had held his palm up toward the comet as if to oppose it. <br> She had heard a sound like cracking plastic coming from his arm. <br> What if? <br> What if Academy City had done nothing and time had simply been allowed to pass? What would have happened then? <br> How would that boy’s right hand have changed and what would it have caused? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Nepthys not mini sized at the end <br>Shit what are you doing Kamachi</br>   The Magic God seemed on the verge of coughing up blood and she just barely managed to rise to a crawling position. <br> She was trying to look Kamijou in the eye. <br> “Work with me. It won’t be a bad deal for you.” </br></br>  <br><br>Simple, a fuck buddy.</br></br>  <br> 666 <br>demon lord touma soon</br></br>  After this volume, I'm just hoping Misaka finally gets some explainations. Girl deserves them more than anyone.<br><br>Maybe it would also raise her confidence. She isn't weak at all, but I guess she still sees Touma as invincible high school boy. Of course she won't catch up to him like that.<br>Really hoping she realizes Touma isn't that special to stand up against magic gods either.</br></br></br>  ok. i like it. I want nt 14 now  So, what are your predictions for the next volume?<br><br>Will Othinus die?<br>If yes, will there be a major change in Touma?<br>If no, is she going to return to normal and go away/stay with Touma/enroll to his class/marry him?<br><br>Who will be a sidekick?<br><br>Will we see spooky Dragons doing spooky things?<br><br>Will Crowley get his shit together?<br><br>Will Nepthys stay with Touma?<br><br>Will Kamisato get punched and added to the harem?<br><br>Who will be the heroine of the week?<br><br>Will Kamachi remember about Himegami and vampires?<br><br>Will Raildex threads continue to be waifuwar shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gunha's actually a science god <br> No one realized it <br>I'm in. Honestly, I can totally see that happening. Secretly he's the closest to Aleisters dreams all along, but not even Aleister knows that.</br></br></br>  <br> Touma isn't special to stand up against magic gods <br>Stop listening to Touma's normal high school boy bullshit<br>He's the most delusional person in the series</br></br></br>  <br> Who will be the heroine of the week? <br>Probably Misaka and Misaki I guess. Christmas is coming closer, so it should be either this or next volume.<br><br><br>He needed millions of attempts to get even close to Othinus and didn't even dare to get close to hp.

The only part built in a few days is the tower shielding the wire:<br> &gt;The most difficult aspect of constructing a space elevator was hanging a single wire down from space to connect the spaceport and earthport. From what she had heard, that alone had taken several years. <br> &gt;The construction of that single wire could only be done by relying on the old method of launching rocket after rocket. But once that was complete, the speed of the work would rise dramatically. <br> &gt;A tower reaching up into space. <br> &gt;Normally, even several decades would not have been enough to create something like that. <br> &gt;However, Academy City had given each individual block of the tower the ability to function as an unmanned mobile robot. Hundreds of million or even billions of such blocks would move along the elevator wire from both space and earth to quickly create the exterior of the tower. <br> &gt;No need for scaffolding. <br> &gt;No need for cranes. <br> &gt;No need for safety checks. <br> &gt;That method allowed a durable building to be constructed with overwhelming speed even in an Antarctic environment where room temperature water would freeze almost instantly. <br> &gt;And while the tower was given durability, the method also provided joints in the connections between each block so that it could “bend” a bit if needed. <br> &gt;Such a gigantic building would normally take over 100 years to complete, but this construction technique allowed it to be finished in only a few days. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You can only pick one  Saber.<br><br> TOHSAKA RIN PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY </br></br>  <br>Saber</br>  the one who isn't a slut  <br>Blue sky</br>  ITT: we fix anime  <br>lurk moar and you'll find out why you shouldn't.</br>  <br>MC is a vampire who lost his memory and he gives a shit about this world.<br>Heroine is an assassin with skills like Spectre in DOTA 2.<br>Somehow MC helps heroine get revenge.

Oh gee, one is devoted to you, and the other is a fucking psycho path who drugs you and is behind every bad thing in the entire fucking game.<br><br>Real tough choice there OP</br></br>  <br>The used to be a quite one</br>  <br>Villains make the best girls, anon.</br>  <br>she was raped in place of her sister</br>  <br>Then why is Sakura so shit?</br>  Every meido thread.<br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xwoM<wbr>SmNB6QU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>   there will never exist a girl cuter than Hisui <br>I don't really mind since she is all I need.</br>  <br>Because Sakura had a boring personality and was uninteresting whenever she wasn't being evil. If they had made her more smug like she occasionally is in Fate/HA , I'm sure more /a/nons would like her.</br>  Kohaku is a terrible meido. What kind of meido tries to poison and kill people?<br><br>Hisui runs circles around her as a top tier meido.</br></br>  <br>sakura isn't a heroine by any means<br><br>if she wasn't locked away by zouken she would have been much better than rin if she teamed up with shirou to win the hgw</br></br></br>  <br>Hisui a best<br>Kohaku is shit tier like Ciel</br></br>  I can't believe some people still love kohaku despite her plan and her true personality revealed.  <br> ciel <br>don't remind me<br><br>what the fuck were they doing, i'd even take sakura over her</br></br></br></br>  First off, Hisui.<br><br>Now, what's with the Ciel hate anyway?</br></br>  <br>The neck is the most delicious part of her.</br>  <br>Long haired Sacchin better be a thing in the remake. Sort of reminds me of Rin but better somehow.</br>  <br>Maybe they just hate megane-girl and curry-obsession.<br>Or it just me.</br></br>    <br>are you serious? have an unedited image from the vn<br><br><br>she's got twintails in the remake, hopefully everyone will forget about rin now</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with liking big, meaty necks.</br>    Kohaku since she likes video games. Plus that china dress.  <br>she's pretty boring when she isn't being evil. She's better in pretty much ever other TM thing she's in, because she isn't anywhere near as boring.</br>  OP here, gotta go with Kohaku.<br><br>I mean she's evil and shit but she's a total bro in Kagetsu Tohya.</br></br>  <br> I mean she's evil and shit  <br><br>I don't see why anons are so fucking annoying with this. <br>Who cares if she's Evil, it's like you people go for Evil=Bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dolls  can't be evil.</br>  <br>Well, she tries to take revenge on the whole family even after the father was dead.<br><br>Pretty shitty move tbh, especially if you're literally built for sex.</br></br></br>  <br>because new arc looks like saber<br><br> still prefer over the old  </br></br></br>  <br>That meido in Code Geese.</br>  <br>Where did the Japs learn to do the monkey? I see animu people do it all the time, maybe even before Johnny Bravo did it.</br>  <br>isn't that gif a 4chan banner</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yup.</br>  <br><br> boring <br><br>Honestly sounds like you just have a fetish. Which is cool, but Sakura is fine in many ways even when not dark, you just didn't try to see it. Her subtle teasing of Shirou is pretty great since she doesn't tease all the time.<br><br>That'd be like saying Rin isn't fun unless she punches Shirou. Your opinion, but no where near an objective truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm going to have to agree with the guy you're replying to. I agree the small things like her teasing were fun. But like you said:<br>  . . . she doesn't tease all the time [when she's not dark.] <br>i.e. 99% of the time she has plain dialogue and is just boring. <br><br>If being reserved and polite is your thing, sure that's fine. But you can't really argue that "reserved and polite" isn't also another word for boring, especially when half of the time she's talking about food. <br><br> Honestly sounds like you just have a fetish.  <br> finding an evil girl who controls the darkness of the holy grail interesting == fetish </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would you a familiar?  <br>Is there any reason not to?</br>  <br>Depends on how familiar we are with each other.</br>  <br>more neco arc</br>  <br>No real personality other than being a sycophant who antagonizes everyone else while. She'd be a good side character, but she had no place being a heroine, because even Arihiko had better chemistry with her than Shiki.</br>  <br>*while masquerading as a vaguely mature and helpful student. Basically, she's hated for the same reasons as Rin in HF.</br>  <br>ugly design, irritating, breath stinks of cury</br>  <br>She looks great in Melty Blood though.</br>  <br>Now, what you will do with two Kohasuis?</br>  <br>Live the dream.  Forever.  And play video games, of course.</br>  <br>What kind of personality do you think that both Kohasuis will have?</br>  <br>Hisui is best maid.</br>    <br>When will Hiroyuki go back to drawing Tsukihime doujins?</br>  <br>loving</br>  <br>Shirou looked like a ginger dyke. Shirou literally copied Shiki's hair.</br>  <br>What a semen demon</br>  <br> You have sex with Hisui, and then after that, before she leaves she say: "Please, don't say about this to my sister." </br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o1c<wbr>lBtsD5Ac</wbr>  [ ]  http://a.pomf.cat/whrorm.webm  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JRF<wbr>5TIhshlo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8xs<wbr>tl2ki39M</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LV3<wbr>1EHwtayo</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VPB<wbr>6MHlyBa4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>What better way to cap off an adaptation of one of the greatest manga of all time than one of the greatest rock songs of all time</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7bs<wbr>ymqUGcYc</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I was about to post this one...

Both of the others are great as well.</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/pVHVujCSZ8I  [ ]  <br>You're gonna have to link 12 of these once the season is over</br>  Why is it always imoutos who want to fuck their brothers first and not vice versa?  <br>Haruka wanted to fuck Sora just as much as Sora wanted to fuck Haruka from the start. Also Araragi.</br>   always <br>You mean out of... one?</br>  <br>Kyousuke wanted to fuck Kirino from like page 1 of the story. You have that award-winning ass to thank for that.</br>  <br>because then it's not cute</br>  <br>Because onii-chans are pure and slutty imoutos like Sora and Kirino taint them and take them to the dark side.</br>  <br>Momoiro Meloik.<br>The only bad part is that only 10 chapters got translated and nobody is willing to do whatever scanlators do with it. Been almost 2 years.</br></br>  <br>Because they aren't the loaded gun.</br>  <br>It's not though, read more Manga before you make uneducated guesses.</br>  <br>What a classy gun.</br>  <br> Haruka <br> pure <br>He wasn't a virgin since a kid and was attracted to every cute girl around him, including his sister.<br><br>Sora's never ending love for a single person is far purer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because these shows are written by men.</br>  <br>*for men</br>  <br>Because it would feel really creepy. The guy would look like the perfect loser, pedophile, rapist scum.<br><br><br>This shit managed to pull it by going completely over the top with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because it would feel really creepy. The guy would look like the perfect loser, pedophile, rapist scum. <br>Just let other lesser girls fall for him. Like Kuroneko, Nao, Ayase, and such did. That way the onii-chan looks like a great guy all around that just happens to love his imouto and not some random sluts he met on the street.</br></br>  <br>Because you have watched less than 20 shows and need to lurk more, faggot.</br>  <br>No, i meant always</br>  This is just bad taste.<br><br>This horse girl, Just imagine that bellow her waist, she is just like a horse. <br><br>Who would want an waifu that has a disgusting pussy like a horse? Yuck.<br><br>I can see this is a typical Harem anime. But how would anyone self-insert into MC? Zoophilia is just disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Those breasts are just ridiculous.

Breasts need to have a nice ratio otherwise they're just bags. Ever been on exhentai and seen those mountains of shitty doujins of women with tits the size of her torso? It's an instant turn-off.</br>  It's half comedy half ecchi, it's a good adaptation to a fantastic manga. It's not everyones cup of tea. /thread   disgusting pussy like a horse   <br>all the parts you need are easily reachable</br>  Because we were waiting for it since it started as a manga, since all girls are monstergirls you can have some bizarre situations, just look at the full-moon scene, where you can get something like that with normal girls?  I'll just leave this here  Would you prefer if she had 2 vaginas?  <br> fixes everything below the tail <br> tail still looks like shit <br><br>Why even bother</br></br></br></br>  That's why Papi is best girl, anon. And centaurs wouldn't exist if it wasn't for humans wanting to fuck full horses.  <br>Didn't Action Hank teach you anything OP?

She'd have to hover over one or use a squat toilet though.</br>  <br>Oh god please stop</br>  <br>Think about it this way, she can't even wipe her ass.<br><br>She just shits where ever she is standing or walking.</br></br></br>  <br>Neither can most of the other monsters.</br>  I put up with the disgusting Horse just so I can enjoy delicious Snake and Slime.  <br>Gay detected</br>  <br>Miia can, rach doesn't have an ass, Suu doesn't have an ass, Mero can if she has an ass.<br>And Papi's ass is literally so perfect that not only does shit not come out of it, if any did, it wouldn't stick to her ass for fear of tarnishing it</br></br>  <br>It doesn't work that way, at least if /tg/ is to be believed. I don't have a cap of that particular post at the moment, though.</br>  <br>Stop projecting your own views towards other.</br>  <br>Stop having shit taste.</br>  ITT: OP had shit taste  <br> an waifu <br>Please, be an hero</br></br>  <br>Why would you want that in the first place? They nearly killed him, and none of it would've even felt good.</br>   wanting to have sex with a monstetgirl <br>I think most of you are missing the point in dating a monstergirl.</br>  <br>But even if you didn't, they are always trying to rape you.</br>  <br> OP doesnt understand why a harem anime, monster girl harem at that, is popular <br>Are you really this new to Anime?</br></br>  <br> implying what they are trying to do is rape </br>  <br>They are trying to fug him, Anon!</br>  <br> not wanting to be cuddle fucked by a lamia so hard you break a rib <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with you</br></br></br>  <br>Her skin would be scaly and it would feel gross. By contrast, imagine being sandwiched in a regular girl, like Iori's, butt till you suffocate. It would be much nicer.</br>  <br>Have you never held a snake? <br>They feel really good and soft<br>If I could have that AND Miia's perfect body wrapped around me, I could die happily and with empty balls</br></br></br>  <br>It is "woman as the Other" taken to the extreme. not really that outrageous.</br>  I honestly love the way horse pussy and butt look.  <br>Snakes are scary.</br>  <br>Better be shit posting. How old are you? 10? Humans are fucking disgusting! ALL of them! Me, You, your mother, your father, your grandparents. Everyone has a fucking disgusting fetish that would leave him hated and exiled from society as soon as they would be found out. Fucking a horse as a harmless one.</br>  <br>It looks like a huge version of a nigger pussy you could fit your whole arm in, and probably smells even worse. Their shit passes awfully close by when it falls out on the ground. I can't image how this could lead to arousal for any human.</br>  <br>Fucking a horse is way more disgusting than anything you could do with a human. Also, as this anon rightfully points out , she just shits anywhere and can't clean herself.</br>  <br>That Anon is probably a nigger, hence he likes the resemblance.</br>  <br> tfw terrified of snakes but Miia is best girl </br>  <br> Just imagine that bellow her waist, she is just like a horse. <br> Who would want an waifu that has a disgusting pussy like a horse? Yuck. <br>You're asking for it, aren't you?<br><br>You're right though, Miia is better</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know what you mean. Despite hating snakes, I think Miia is still cute. But I couldn't have sex with her, and I can't even begin to fathom how something like this  would be nice.</br>   And Papi's ass is literally so perfect that not only does shit not come out of it, if any did, it wouldn't stick to her ass for fear of tarnishing it <br><br>I like the way you think</br></br>  <br><br>Check it<br><br><br>I know that feel. I'm not afraid of snakes and Miia is best girl, but a Rachnee is fine too and I hate spiders.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true. Papi does have the best body by far, but her legs are gross. Her wings/arms are fine, though.</br>  <br>Snakes are fucking cute, especially pythonidae.</br>  <br> she can't even wipe her ass. <br><br>She uses an augbesian.</br></br></br>  Yo fa/tg/uy here. its really the /d/eviant overlap that gets us.<br>Its why where sometimes called /d/evian/tg/entlemen. It just hits our fancy in just the right spot. <br>To be honest, im not entirely sure why monster musume gets our board all riled up, but it does and it makes sense for a board whos activities include roleplaying as various other creatures in fantasy and scifi settings. I mean, jesus have you ever been to one of our weekend smut threads? It gets pretty lewd in there, way more than monster musume for sure.<br>Pic Related, we take what is /a/ and make it more /tg/ for our liking and fapping.</br></br></br>  ITT: Animeonlyfags  <br>It's face is terrifying.</br>  <br>It depends on if shes willing to start slow with some of the snake type stuff.</br>  I don't remember her name, but I think this is best girl  <br> No board is safe from filthy secondaries <br>This is hell.</br></br>  <br>I want have back the old MonMusu threads.</br>  <br> not having a pet bushmaster to cuddle with </br>  <br>but is the same face of a dog puppy<br> Still Rachnee is best girl and should win the darlingbowl </br></br>  <br> harem shit <br> poor's man MGQ <br> Bad desings <br>don't know OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you have to worry about best girl getting dirty </br>    <br>Snakes in the wild are scary. Pet snakes are fine.<br>But I don't care how much you try to tell me your pet spider is harmless, I'm not going within a hundred feet of that thing.</br></br>  <br>I enjoy how in the manga she just becomes an asshole when she is poisoned</br>  <br>This is hell.</br>  <br>Is that..? No, it couldn't be...</br>  <br> poor mans MGQ <br> implying MGQ isn't the poor man's MGE <br> thinking the MGQ and MM are anything alike besides the fact there are monstergirls in them <br> being this retarded and new <br><br>Enjoy your vore faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would go check that but it's probably agro x wander.</br>  <br>I prefer my girls with a little more meat on their bones.</br>  <br> this vanilla pleb <br>no wonder why this and shimoneta are the normalbait of the season.</br></br>  <br>Son of a bitch.<br><br>You win, internet. You finally beat me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>heh.</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone ever want a snake as a pet? I've never understood this.</br>  <br>How does Miia shit? Where is a snake's anus?</br>  <br>She has a regular human butt.</br>  <br> not wanting to fuck that slutty mare </br>  <br>Just google, "how does a snake shit"</br>  <br>thats why you gotta get snake cause she got that human puss puss</br>  <br>I have seen this image posted twice on this board, and that is 3 times too many.</br>  <br/>  <br> Who would want an waifu that has a disgusting pussy like a horse? Yuck.  <br>This made me lol for some reason.</br></br>  <br>So she has to face the toilet to pee, then turn her whole body to poop? That doesn't seem very efficient. What if she had to go really badly and a bit slipped out while she was still peeing?</br>  <br><br><br>I thought that at first and normally I don't like it when anime characters have unrealistically large breasts.<br><br>Then I thought that since she is a centaur she is probably the only character I can think of where it actually makes sense for her to have giant cowtits.</br></br></br></br></br>  a horse could easily stomp on whores  <br>Wow, I've never thought of that.</br>  <br>How the fuck do they breast feed?</br>  <br>The harpy is probably the best choice so far.<br>The slime girl has promise as well.</br></br>  <br> How does Miia shit? <br>Only Miia knows.</br></br>  <br>A would actually make more sense. Back side is just for excrement, front side is just for lovin'.</br>  <br>You're fear is not unfounded. Supposedly, human's have a instinctual tension around snakes. Apparently, humans have been bitten by snakes so much we supposedly developed a predisposition to being wary of snakes. Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone.</br>  <br>Don't forget the mouth grabbers of doom inside of there</br>  Honestly, I think why I like Centorea the best out of all the girls is because of her personality.<br><br> I'm not a tit man, not a furry, but for some reason I'm drawn to her. Her cute mannerisms, the way she talks, she's perfect.</br></br>  <br>snakes have cloaca so B</br>  <br>You don't need to e a furry to be a horse fucker</br>  <br>Snakes don't have tits.</br>  <br> cloaca <br>Oh god why are snakes so fucking disgusting.</br></br>  <br>At the very least a redneck farmer.</br>  <br/>  <br>Let's just say she is very good at flipping over when the time comes</br>  <br>When the baby centaurs are young I would imagine the mother could simply lie down.</br>  <br>That's eels</br>  <br/>    <br>Centorea is a good girl with a beautiful face and a good personality, but I can't get over the horse pussy.</br>  <br>I saw somewhere in the old animal planet that all non poison type ekans have two sets of teeth in the top of their mouths that pull back on prey</br>  <br>Shouldn't it be coming from the end of the tail then or closer to it instead of near her head?</br>    <br>isn't it like that fat guy who brings spoons wrapped in paper towels around cause he can't reach his own asshole?</br>   mfw this thread     <br>You are absolutely right OP, Centorea is the worst.</br>  <br> personality </br>  <br>I would imagine with centaurs either the horse part would be much smaller and weaker than a newborn horse or the human part would come out looking more like lolis.</br>  <br>Fucking Rachnee!!!</br>  <br>Being borne a loli...<br>That would be painful for the mother and child<br><br>But then being borne weak would make it more of a hazard if you are going to carry a child that will get pretty big before he can walk</br></br></br></br>  Why is it always Cerea and Miia in every thread? I think the poop habits of the other girls are equally important!<br><br>Birds traditionally have a cloaca, but Papi clearly has a butt and a vajayjay. Does she have runny bird poop, or does she defecate like a human?<br><br>If Suu dissolves everything she eats, and then leaves a trail of slime on the ground where ever she goes, could that slime trail be considered her poop?<br><br>Mero has the same issue Miia does, but fish don't have cloaca. Does she excrete through her gills, as many fish do?<br><br>What about Racnee? She has a butt at the bottom of the human part of her body. Does she have to flip over onto her back just to use the restroom?<br><br>If Lala's head eats something while disconnected from her body, does her body poop it out?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mero has the same issue Miia does, but fish don't have cloaca. Does she excrete through her gills, as many fish do? <br>Jesus Christ. So not only does Mero have cold, clammy skin that's covered in a layer of smelly fish slime but she is also frequently covered in her own shit.</br></br>  <br>This is a thought provoking post, Anon.</br>  <br>the dullahan one always concerned me</br>  <br>There needs to be a One Piece cross over so Luffy can ask the hard question.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PYz<wbr>n2JoEWeY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Nah sanji will cuck it up</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure anything Lala ate as just her head would fall through her neck hole.</br>  <br>I'd imagine that if her head eats while not on her body, it would just come out the bottom of her neck and not be digested. The only way for her to ingest food is too spoon it into the top of her esophagus.</br>  <br>She doesn't HAVE to wipe her ass.<br>The horse anus is a wonder of engineering and is auto cleaning.<br>Someone post the screencap.<br><br>There was a thread about that yesterday, look in the archive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> plop </br>  <br> I don't know man, maybe I'm just waifu fagging hard for Centorea, but when you really love someone, you accept all that person has.<br><br> I'm no fan of horse pussy, but I think I'd be able to look past that for my centaur waifu.</br></br></br>   Zoophilia is just disgusting. <br><br>Hey.

She has never once hurt Kimihito, while all the others have almost killed him in the most horrible ways (breaking his neck, trampling him, drowning him, dropping him from heights).

So Kekkai fans, how does it feel knowing that you'll never see the finale to this show because a really shitty studio adapted it?  The anime would've been top tier if they just stuck to the manga. Half of Libra barely made a cameo to make room for ghost waifu/edgelord bishie. They felt really forced in and the fact that they never interacted with the rest of the show's characters bar Leo is unbelievably stupid.  <br>Holy shit.</br>  The show kinda sucked, but I hope they do more with it. The world was interesting and the soundtrack and style were cool, I think there's potential.  <br>They probably did it because they thought it was going to flop</br>  <br> outsold any KyoAni show <br><br>Is this bait?</br></br></br></blockquote>]
