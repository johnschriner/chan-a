[ Who gets this reference?  not me  <br>You missed one of the greatest anime/manga in history</br>  <br>Im gonna post this on reddit.<br><br>thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking reddit</br>  I got the thing with the Strawberry, I got it 100%.   google image search  <br> everything is in Arabic  <br><br>OP, are you a terrorist?</br></br></br>  <br>Is that so?<br>I'm going to assume Ichigo 100%. Never saw it, nor do I know what it's about at all, but it's the only strawberry related thing I can think of in anime.<br><br><br>This kinda just confirms my suspicions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Death Note actually</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128351454 <br>توت فرنگی?</br>  For anybody that really doesn't get it, it's a Desu Note reference.  <br>Allahu akbhar</br>  <br><br>Oooooh<br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br>I read Bleach.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>Explain. I watched the anime, didn't read the shitty weeaboo comic.</br>  <br>But what is step 2 anyway? Step 3 and 4 are always the same but I have no idea about the second.</br>  <br>I don't get it, but then again nine years is a long time so I'm not going to blame dementia this time</br>  <br>It is in the anime.</br>  <br> I watched the anime <br>Clearly you weren't paying much attention.</br></br>  <br>You people must have an amazing memory. There's no way I'd remember a specific scene like that, years after I read the manga.</br>  <br>No, you just have a shit memory is all.</br>  Shitty reference from an even worse excuse for an anime.  <br><br> see strawberry <br> think about newgrounds </br></br></br>  <br>Was that scene that memorable and important to you that you recall it after however long you watched the show? Unless you just watched it within the last couple months.<br><br> Also yes my memory is absolute shit tier. </br></br></br>  <br>A strawberry for ants</br>  <br>It was memorable to me. Is there a problem with that?</br>  <br>After your 10th rewatch everything is memorable.</br>  <br>And I thought it was just me</br>  <br> Unless you just watched it within the last couple months <br>Which is obviously the case.</br></br>  I don't even remember some of the major parts of the plot from death note, theres no way i'd remember that.    shitty reference from shitty anime <br>  greatest anime/manga <br>sure is summer</br></br>  <br>I thought it was a SZS reference</br>  Are hentai animations dead?<br> There will never be another one as perfect as this one </br>  <br><br>People say this all the time however.<br><br>Quality hentai titles are usually once or so per year at best and if that title was so good it would have focused on the black elf girls ALL the time instead of just in two episodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It should've been 100% dark elf girl  vanilla. </br>  what's that called?  <br> vanilla <br>no one would have liked this shit if it were vanilla and you know it.</br></br>  <br>Kuroinu, OP's pic is from the first episode when the brown girl gets dicked by large orcs.<br><br>And I think it was the second episode when the loli halfling got destroyed by orcs, cyclops and minotaurs, shit was brutal. I can't stand lolis being toyed around like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Bukkake? Ahegao?</br>  <br>isn't this the one where the warrior girl gets boned by someone she had a crush on</br>  why is it always rape and torture. why can't there be more vanilla where its just a couple loving each other tenderly  <br> no one would have liked this shit if it were vanilla and you know it. <br>I bet you hate Tentacle and Witches because it's extremely vanilla, faggot. I hope the creator of whatever thing your waifu's from dies.</br></br>  where can i watch? any good torrents?  <br>Yeah I think it was the redhead.<br>Though the best scene of the whole series was OP's pic, the rest is not that great.</br></br>  <br>I've seen this format of image before, where it has an image plus text like "when something or another happens" all on a white background. Is it from another website like twitter?</br>  <br>I know how you feel. Vanilla is criminally underrated.</br>  <br> not only a weak-gut but a lowly spoonfeeder <br>get off the board normie</br></br>  Sauce?  <br> normie <br>Go back to /r9k/</br></br>  Blonde elf &gt; dwarf &gt; pig-fucker loli &gt; Miko &gt; notSaber &gt; red-hair &gt; shit &gt; Black-haired elf &gt; everyone else  I could never get into it since the bad guy looks like Guts.  I hope so because when we can find an uncensored version of one, it's to realize (nearly) FUCKING EVERY TIME that the staff can't draw a vagina for shit.  <br>Lolis are for protecting. Go away, cyclop.</br>  <br><br>Well since it's gonna be censored anyways, they probably never bothered to learn how to.</br></br>  I can't get off to rape, man, no matter how much I try and how well the animation pertains to the positions I love in any adult feature<br><br>I want to white knight the Blonde knight girl too much</br></br>  There isn't even a decent hentai in 2015 ...  <br>You're right, 2012 was a year with lots of great hentai such as Kuroinu or Otomedori.<br>But this year is just absolute garbage.</br></br>  <br>I can only stand rape if it has mindbreak in it or/and ahegao.</br>  Reminder, episode 2 fucking never.  <br>Move Kaguya up and you got a deal</br>  <br>Because if you don't make it exotic then the animation limitations become even more obvious</br>  <br>Only one I've ever enjoyed was 'please rape me' every other Hentai I've ever seen was just shit tbh oh and one yaoi one where he was French and got sent to prison or something but I don't remember the name. Its good though</br>  <br> orcs </br>  <br>Bishop and Guilty have new games.<br><br>The guilty game CG is out, but the game isn't on nyaa.<br><br>The bishop eroge is sometime this month.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watched it. Whole thing was incredibly homo-erotic, there had to be like 20 dicks for each pussy. Was laughing my ass of though.</br>  <br> Was laughing my ass of though. <br><br>Pretty much this tbh<br><br>Most wrong love story ever made ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanted to white knight the chocoelves.<br><br>Girls are supposed to be protected, cherished and loved by one man.<br>Not treated like garbage and onaholes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish we had another Words Worth.</br>  <br> Not treated like garbage and onaholes. <br><br>You must've never read any of Oysters work. This whole thing was really tame. Fucking normies.</br></br></br>  <br>i know, your mom hasnt made one since 2011</br>  <br>I can't stomach any non-vanilla. Doesn't make me a normie.</br>  <br><br>It does in my eyes normie.</br></br>  <br><br>http://myanimelist.net/anime/24641/<wbr>Baku_Ane:_Otouto_Shibocchau_zo!_The<wbr>_Animation<br><br> Finished Airing <br><br>its fucking over</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>It's because nobody buys hentai anime.</br>  <br>I don't care what I am to a degenerate.<br>You belong on a spike, filth.</br></br>  <br>Generic shit.</br>  <br><br/></br>  reminder that hentai is bad for you brain and damages your brain cells and instigates to commit rape    <br><br>We both fap to cartoons, we're both degenerates, i'm just higher, more evolved, you're below me pleb. While you're crying at small time work like this I reveal and evolved in Oyster killing off women in his work with men who don't even enjoy fucking them and only want to cause them pain and suffering.</br></br>  <br>i demand that the "medium" stay alive until we get a decent handfull of futa on male ones</br>  <br>I'm fine until they start crying. Instant boner killer.</br>  <br><br> finished airing  <br><br>I feel robbed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there literally any trap or futa ones?</br>  What the fuck is with all the shit about elves are for pure love? That's disgusting as fuck. Dear god man, if you're going to cross species pollinate a girl at least make it hardcore rape and prove your superiority over the xeno scum.  <br> i'm just higher, more evolved, you're below me pleb <br><br>Sure, in the degenerate scum scale.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Would Space Pirate Sara count, although it didn't have any on males, just Futa on Futa, Futa on Loli, alot of gang bangs in the first ep.<br><br>It has a bit of everything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see them crying  of happiness when they are saved by dazzling, charming knights who afterwards take care of them and woo their hearts, marry and stuff. </br>  <br>There is that maid hentai that was released couple of months ago. Can't remember the name though, maria or something</br>  <br>BUT WHY?<br><br>We didn't even get the other two sisters.<br><br>Nothing has gotten me so hard since Kyonyuu Fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's still the scale you're on normie, you're just a frail tiny degenerate compared to me, it's porn, no one will ever know, you just gotta reach it, like I have. <br><br>Outside of the porn, we're not so different you and I.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Victorian maid maria.</br>  The 90s had some nice hentai at the time.  <br>It was awful and vanilla as fuck though</br>  <br>That was top-notch for mostly vanilla hetero lovin'. The other Toranoana one with the mother and daughter before it was great as well</br>  <br>Don't compare me to you scum.<br>Do life a favor and slice off your manhood.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128330151 <br>Use google search image.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128330151 <br>the source was posted in the thread faggot</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128330321 <br>Boku no google.</br>  <br>Himekishi Janne was great.<br>The second game, I mean.</br></br>  <br>Probably money issues. I wonder if crowdfunding would get us some good hentai because budget always seems to be what kills something good either with shit animation or premature ending.</br>  <br>if there is than fucking tell me</br>  <br><br>Oh wow this are the worst news for my dick in a long time.</br></br>  <br>I'd donate, but only if I get to use an alias like Dick Cummings.</br>  <br>Instagram</br>  <br>The quality for this was pretty shit compared to that one with that succubus</br>  <br>Delta was such a hot semen demon.</br>    <br>When did Swing Out Sisters come out?</br>  <br> Not disabling the nsfw filter. <br>Anon pls.</br></br>  <br>What's happening is anime losing it's luster? I am also noticing more QUALITY anime lately.</br>  <br> Are hentai animations dead? <br>no, they've always sucked, and you're just seeing the old shit as better because you hadn't drained your dick on hentai as much back then as you have now. My first hentai was a bleach futanari with big tits. Came like a pro, and I don't even like big tits. I doubt I'd even get stiff rereading it now though</br></br>  <br>It seems Pink Pineapple is really going for one adaptation for work for the most part</br>  <br> perfect <br>No Prim no life</br></br>  <br>She had perfect perky breasts and they weren't even fuckhuge like the elves in OP's pic.</br>  <br>The 1:20h one came out last year, the vol.1 was in 2011.<br><br>Someone please put a crowfunding, I need to see the blond haired sister.</br></br></br>  <br>Shame she had like one scene which was interrupted.<br>Made my dick mad as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Why do people keep praising Kuroinu? It looked like shit.</br>    <br>At least we had one with Rita, that young dark skinned girl with white hair.<br><br>It's interesting that there weren't buckets of cum flying all over the place for a hentai like this.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure we would all do something like that and they wouldn't care since we are paying them.</br>  <br>Cause you're terrible at finding hentai? There's a lot of vanilla out there</br>  <br>It's getting more episodes, you know. They announced it with some of the Blu-Ray releases.<br><br>http://www.a1c.jp/~majin/product/ku<wbr>ro_bluray.html<br><br>" そしてなんと!『黒獣』最新作第5弾、6弾がアニメ化決定!<br>予習、復習に最適な Blu-ray HD 版を是非お求めください "<br><br>Something like, " We've decided to animate a 5th and 6th episode of Kuroinu, so be sure to buy the Blu-ray in the meantime. "</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I want a flashback to prim being mind broken.</br>  <br>She got it pretty hard.<br><br>Them moans too, back then it wasn't "YOUR DICKS ARE RAPING MY WOMB!! I'M COMING~~~~~~~~" "YEAH TAKE IT YOU SLUTTY ONAHOLE" "IT'S FINE IF I FUCK YOUR TITS RIGHT?! IT'S FINE RIGHT?!"</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Good news I guess this thread was full of bad ones.</br>  <br>Whatever, only the first episode and half of the last one were good. I don't want them to spend an entire episode focusing on their NTR bullshit dialogue or a slime monster covering the elf's entire body, or the one loli getting poked by something as big as her. Why do they think they need to cover every fetish imaginable? It just pleases nobody</br>  <br>anasheya is the artist i believe</br>  <br> futa on male <br>We need a decent amount of futa on female/futa first</br></br>  <br> .gif </br>  <br>Yeah, its just "It hurts!" and "Stop!". Plus, she knows he's trying to impregnate her so none of that nonsense. No ahegaos either. She just relaxed her moans when she was about to cum.</br>  <br>Benadick Cumhersnatch</br>  <br>I downloaded Tentacle and Witches and regretted it. Didn't like it due to how vanilla it was.<br>Not the samefag of course.</br></br>  <br>What was that called?</br>  <br><br>Kuroinu took a nosedive right into noteventrying/10 after 2</br></br>  <br>I liked every single one. Fuck the haters.</br>  <br>1&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2</br>  <br>What would they be about. A prequel and another epilogue? I haven't played it so not familiar with the story.<br><br><br>It pleases me, more then anything I love variety. I can enjoy vanilla, pegging, scat, or yuri ouroboros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon understands. Incredible taste.</br>   black men and green black men <br>Kuroinu was litereally shit.</br>  I was so happy that we get that scene with the blonde dark elf and the goo.<br><br>But then it came out of a hole it couldn't have without massive internal trauma</br></br>  <br>It's not like I can't fap to it, but variety is the single worst thing plaguing hentai. If I came for elves I didn't come for torture, tentacles, and shoe shining. I came for elves taking a dicking.<br>If I want to watch a pegging hentai, it should be a hentai about pegging, not one short scene in the entire thing where the spend half of it talking about the concept because, you know, it's my fetish so they got to really pound it home, and the rest being something I don't care about at all. That's why I hate fetish shit. I don't know how anyone can stand it.</br></br>  <br>Dude have you seen the rest of their antomy? Their eyes are like 20% the size of their skull. Their bust, waist, hip proportions make Barbie look alike a healthy young women. Any amount of spunk can exit an anime girl and it doesn't faze me, in fact I love it more.</br>  <br>I guess it is just a diffrence on how you process stuff. I don't go looking for things, I just dive in. "Oh hey this game is a JRPG" or "oh man this a murder mystery movie?", "Aw shit turns out this doujin is futa on futa!". I never look at the tags and just pick based on the cover image/movieposter/boxart, I like the surprise.</br>  <br><br>the asagi one is still the best imo</br></br>  <br>3&gt;4&gt;1&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2  get gud</br>  <br>Awaken my cock!</br>  <br>This one was really well done, I enjoy it pretty much even when i'm not a big fan of way too big boobs.</br>  Why do people praise Kuroinu as the best thing since sliced bread? It was good, but not groundbreaking in any way.  i forgot this one site that subbed the newest hentai, but it went on hiatus because paypal closed their account or something. would anyone be so kind as to remind me what it was  <br>Hentai pro with PHD on the field here, it was the best I seen till date, of course there tons of good ones, but only this one(and Oni Chichi) make me watch it over and over again, I would like to buy the BD/DVD, would be well spended money.</br>   Watching hentai <br>I can just never find any decent ones. It's always the same position for a minute at a time with repetitive animation and poor body physics.<br><br> But I'd love to watch a good one, if anyone can think of one off the top of their heads. I liked the 2 episode one, forget what it was called but MC was a purple-haired knight, first episode was his waifu, second episode was his imouto. </br></br></br>  <br>Kuroinu is not the best thing since anything. The only good ep was the first.<br>I like mindbreak and all that shit but they just set the bar too high for the rest of the episodes which were complete let downs.</br></br>  Any good ova without disgusting men or orcs?  <br>What hentai are you talking about? Just the name "Delta" isn't terribly informing. And that name was never mentioned in OP's series.</br>  <br>This is what the dwarfs want you to think, do not believe their lies!</br>  <br>Koikishi Purely Kiss</br>  I think I watched one where some sort of reporter was filming a girl getting boned in a balcony with people outside.<br><br>it was kind of hot, and I don't even know what it was called.</br></br>  <br>Foxy Nudes is a classic /a/non</br>  Pet Life was pretty hot. In my opinion way better than Kuroinu.<br>Also Otomedori, except the preggo sex scene. Pregnant sex kills my boner.</br>  <br>Read the post that one was replying to.</br>  <br>It's not Hentai, but I'm hoping it gets really fucking lewd because I'm really enjoying this right here for some reason.<br><br>I don't want it to be a harem. He's married dammit!</br></br></br>  So /a/ what is the absolute best hentai you've ever seen?<br><br>What's your favorite kind?</br></br>  <br> pic <br>That hentai would have been so good if they went over the top with the sex cult thing and showed godlike powers. Instead, they just went the lazy cult scam route and have the older sister fail to save the girl again.</br></br>  <br><br>Does Pet Life girl and Kanojo Shinjiteru girl share the same VA ? I hate vanilla and specially pure and innocent girls, but the girl's voice on those had something really special on it that made my dick diamonds despite being the type of hentai i hate.</br></br>  <br>thanks a lot, man.<br><br>also there was this couple who ended up in the hospital and the nurse and some big guy NTR'd both of them in the same hospital room with their beds next to each other<br><br>of course NTR is bad but when the nurse put a capsule into the girl's snatch it was really one of the best animated things i've ever seen</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably the only hentai I've seen where one of the guys is kind of pudgy but has some noticeable muscle, the police chief. Everyone but the camera guy was deplorable but entertaining GTA style.</br>  <br>Oni Chichi hands down.</br>  <br>Either Koikishi Purely Kiss or Kanojo x Kanojo x Kanojo.<br><br>The former looked beautiful and had some interesting sex scenes, like the one where the guy feeds the girl a pizza while boning her.<br><br>The latter had Mafuyu.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hentai animations are garbage<br><br> Censored <br>more pixelated than an indie game<br><br> Uncensored  <br>genitalia look like shit anyway because they didn't bother to draw them<br><br>if the "light saber dicks into an empty void" meme in hentai manga keeps getting worse I'll just have to castrate myself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   there are people that unironically watch hentai rather than read <br>this honestly disgusts me</br>  <br>One of the few recurring hentai where the incestuous father-daughter relationship is two-sided. Plus, I thought the father was actually her boyfriend before because of how he looked..</br>  <br>Pet Life ia not vanilla, she gets blackmailed into sex in the changing room twice, the swimsuit scene is just exquisite.<br><br>But perhaps they share the same VA they kinda sound similar now that you mention it.</br></br></br>  <br> implying xeno scum aren't better than your degenerate empire.  <br><br>Stay cucked.</br></br></br>  <br> no futa on male <br> no /ss/ <br>why. my two favorite things and theres almost nothing</br></br></br>  This came out not that long ago  <br>Futa on male doujins are plenty common. What are you talking about?</br>  <br>animations dog</br>  <br><br> futa on male <br> not male on futa <br>do you really get turned on by a guy getting fucked in the ass by a woman?</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I don't but some people do. Actually kind of killing me how most futa doujins these days are futa on male. I miss the old fashioned futa on female stuff.</br>  <br>okay.</br>  <br> futa on male <br> male on futa <br> not the gloriously perfect futa on female <br><br>You niggas gay?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>futa on female is literally gay.<br>It's just an extension of lesbo shit.</br></br>  I miss Pixy.  <br> used goods. <br>Never again</br></br>  <br>I miss good hentai OVAs in general. Seems to be very slim pickings for a while now.</br>  <br>Sorry but I just couldn't get it up with this, it was way too vanilla, and no, I don't mean NTR or mindbreak are better, a good monogamous relationship its not necessarily boring, and this OVA was way too plain and boring.</br>  <br> not liking yuri where one girl has a penis <br><br>Faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> Murukami Teruaki will never work on another H-anime that doesn't look like fat greasy hamster girls <br>Kangoku Senkan and Taimanin Asagi were so fucking good god fucking damn it</br></br>  <br>yuri is literally gay you faggot.<br>you're either inserting as a girl making you gay or you're just watching making you a cuckold.</br></br>  <br> It's not Hentai <br>Ohoho<br>http://exhentai.org/g/20217/94a4e5f<wbr>c16/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>My nigga. <br>My hoty of the year so far and I doubt anything tops that.<br>So fucking good and delicious. I just get so relaxed and immersed watching and hearing her voice in that.</br></br></br>  <br>I know everyone and they're mother has seen those, but god damn i just love rewatching/fapping to them.</br>  <br>Taimanin Asagi<br>Hellknight Ingrid<br>Kangoku Senkan<br>Story of Little Monica</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to find good hentais animated in 1s that don't use shakycam and blurry vision.</br>  <br>For real, I have ejaculated to Taimanin Asagi/Kangoku Senkan more than any other material in my entire life.<br>I have memorized the approximate time in episode 2 of Kangoku Senkan where Lieri Bishop gives that POV blowjob, because I have used it so man times.<br>I have started making high quality loops of these videos just for myself to use.<br>They're just that good.<br>If I was rich, I would pay thousands of my own money to the publisher in order to secure uncensored copies and distribute it online.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not enjoying watching women exploring each other's bodies <br><br>Faggot. It's not even about self inserting.</br></br></br>  <br>so you really are a cuck.</br>  <br> Asuka will never be animated <br> Yukikaze will never get a decent OAV <br> No demon Asagi <br>Fucking shit sucks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a love hate relationship with that stuff. I love the content, but hate the animation and art.</br>  <br>it's interesting, as the other anon said it's very vanilla but it's pretty polished too.<br>The maid trope is used to great effect, the key frames are beautifully drawn and the VA is quality stuff.<br>It reminded me of those audio clips of girls talking in your ear that got popular, it's so slow and subtle it's sexy in itself.</br></br></br>  <br> not translated  <br><br>I need to learn moon someday.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly thought this hentai would have the main girl settle down like in the beginning.</br>  <br>you hate the art?<br>I'll admit there's a lot of sketchy shots and the camera effect they use leads to a lot of artifacting, but the pov and orc fucking stuff is diamond dick stuff.</br></br>  <br> If I was rich, I would pay thousands of my own money to the publisher in order to secure uncensored copies and distribute it online. <br><br>I hope you do. And i also have all the gifs, webms and loops from all my favorite parts. Those blowjob parts are 10/10, some of the best.</br></br></br>  <br> calls me a cuck <br> watches women get fucked by men <br><br>You are literally the definition of cuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah man, I made a really nice webm loop of Lieri but I like her VA too.<br>But her moans don't perfectly loop so it's a mute webm.<br>Maybe I can look into editing the audio to loop but I'm not skilled in audio editing.</br></br></br>  <br>Just about anything by Collaboration Works</br>  <br>If I was rich I'd pay thousands of my own money just to take take normal anime girls to the hentai world.<br>Imagine Nibutani.<br>Or Akeno.<br>Or Kirono.<br>Or the Love Live's<br>Or the Idol Masters<br>etc<br>All taking dickings.<br>Now that's something worth paying for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What is that studio that compares the key frames of their animations with the manga their adapting from after the credits? Their work is just low-tier.  <br>Exactly on everything and yeah spot on about the audio clips resemblance. <br>Ejaculation parts are also actually long and just don't skip fade to black after ten seconds but last minute and then there's even follow up service by the maid right after so all in all it's goddamn well paced and animated.</br></br>  Meh, I prefer whatever Pink Pineapple does.  <br>looking at the artist tag on boorus also links to that delicious chubby milf lactation H-anime from not that long ago too.<br>I hope this company keeps up the good work.<br>I know the milf anime isn't getting another episode...</br></br></br>  <br>Kirino*<br>Fuck Kirono man, typing on phones is a pain.</br></br>  <br>What this nigga said.</br>  Why is Queen Bee animations so shit /a?. It's like .gif with voice.  <br>Why does it look so shit compared to the manga</br>  <br>nah they're more akin to those animations you see online, where someone takes a still image and animates it so the characters kind of move like they're fucking.</br>  <br> Are hentai animations dead? <br>Not really. There are gems once or twice a year. It also depends on your fetish.</br></br>  I want to kill shitposter-kun  <br><br>what volume is this? Or is this some kind of an alternate setting?</br></br>  <br>I had my interst rekindled to them by hmv's, the moans and beats do miracles to my dick</br>  Kuroinu really was the best. At least in terms of fetishes.<br>Yabai Fukushuu Yami Site is a close second. Less episodes and therefore less content, but unlike Kuroinu, all the content was always good. This scene wasn't even in the VN, the anime added quite a few good scenes.</br>  So what's the sequel hentai you're waiting for, that might or might not cum at all?<br> Dorei Usagi 02 <br> Victorian Maid Maria 02 <br> Manketsu Happening! 03 <br> Mou Hasamazu ni wa Irarenai 02 </br></br></br></br>  <br>How is beating the bitch a good scene?</br>  Are there any recent releases without subs yet? Thankfully SubdesuRoll seems to be just as easy for rippers to swipe from as Crunchy.  <br> Star Jewel 02 <br> Senshi Knight Milcream Ep. 2 (RIP Mimiacute) </br></br>  <br>You see this nigga here?<br>He's my nigga!<br><br><br>Never really liked Yabai! It might be the girls' design or something, but I just couldn't like it. I don't even mind the MC beating up the girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takarasagashi no Natsuyasumi 2 and the Liru game.</br>  <br>This show actually interesting in term of mystery.<br><br> Came to fap; stay for the "who's the killer?" story </br></br></br>  What did you guys think of Gakuen de Jikan yo Tomare? I loved the first one, leaving aside all the blood, but the second one was kinda bland. I just couldn't like the new girls.<br><br>I did like the ending, though, with the MC  literally raping every student in the school and getting away with it.  Episode 03 never, sadly.</br></br>  <br> eyes rolled up <br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>That time stop hentai so I can see if the headmaster is as much as an asshole as he supposedly is or if that unintentionally unsympathetic protagonist will get his comeuppance. And maybe if something interesting will be done with that time stop ability.<br><br> That subtitle of him raping teachers got a chuckle out of me because that would mean he also raped guy's asses and came on their faces for revenge. </br></br></br>  <br> Genkaku Cool na Sensei ga Aheboteochi 02 <br> Fault!!

But in terms of the porn itself, it was pretty good as  sleep rape with tiny bits of moaning is my kind of fetish </br>   watch a pov hentai <br> the girl is really cute and considerate, happy to be with the viewer <br><br>So this is what it feels like to have a girlfriend...</br></br></br>  <br> cute and considerate <br> girlfriend <br>Anon, I have news for you.</br></br></br>  <br>There was one where you were the butler for some tsundere princess or something.<br>I didn't care much for it, but her character design was really good, and there were a few good scenes.<br>I never remember the name though.</br></br></br>  <br>The way she pauses so you can fill in your own words just makes me uncomfortable. It's like watching Dora but she's ten years older and you're fucking her.</br>  <br><br><br> searching the thumbnail <br>You're fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry buddy, i sold out and went 3D...made a mistake. The company is nice though, fortunately we both decided after 2D is better</br>  <br> It's like watching Dora but she's ten years older and you're fucking her. <br>Anon, I think you have a billionaire idea right there.</br></br>   Dekakute Ecchi na Ore no Ane <br> Currently Airing <br> It's been 2 years <br><br>fucking when!?<br>http://myanimelist.net/anime/21001/<wbr>Dekakute_Ecchi_na_Ore_no_Ane/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, this was the name.<br>Betsu ni Anta no Tame ni Ookiku Nattan Janain Dakara ne!!</br></br>  <br/>  <br><br> not talking to your monitor when fapping to simulate interacting with the girls <br><br>Look at this pleb.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not shoving several dildos on your ass and post on /a/ as Biribiri, telling everyone that you're about to cum so you can cum with everyone else at the same time <br>Full pleb.</br></br>  What's his name again?  <br>KAIHO</br>  <br>fucking love pov hentai</br>  <br>TADA BANRI</br>  <br>Moonlight Lady will always be a personal favorite</br>  <br><br>Fapping to the Imako anime was the angriest fap I've had in my life.</br></br>  <br>Resort Boin<br><br> It's been 6 years <br> Still no hentai can top this gem. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently and thankfully, they didn't animate the part where the token twink seduces the love interest.</br>  <br><br>Despite the great titles that have been released over the years I still regard Immoral Sisters as my favorite, even though it's just nostalgia boners.</br></br>  <br>GO FUCK YOURSELF FAGGOT<br> hentaimama </br></br>  <br><br><br>learn moon and read the vn you faggots</br></br></br>  <br>I completely agree, everything that guy does is gold.</br>  <br> Kangoku Senkan and Taimanin Asagi were so fucking good god fucking damn it <br>if you like epileptic seizure-inducing action, by all means</br></br>  <br>They would have been good if it weren't for that damn blur and shaking camera. It's fine once in a while, but constantly having that just ruins the quality of it.</br>  <br>My nostalgia boner award goes to Pollinic Girls. <br>Absolute best? Twiska from Brandish is my one and only hentaifu. Best Semen Demon.</br></br>  <br>Did you know Ep 3 got decensored?</br>  <br> no episode two though </br>  <br> perfect <br>It's below mediocre, an insult to the source material. I can't understand /a/'s tendency to worship trash of the season like this and Ran-Sem. Is it because they contain your precious ahegaos?</br></br>  <br> perfect <br>Not enough anal.</br></br>  <br>Uchuu Kaizoku Sara and Okusama wa Moto Yariman.</br>  <br> homo-erotic, there had to be like 20 dicks for each pussy <br>Let me educate you. The amount of dicks per frame (Dick Density, or DD for short) is an indicator of who the work is marketed to. The larger DD is the more likely that intended audience are men.<br>DD over 20? It's for men.<br>1DD? Most likely it's for men.<br>Are all characters girls? Doesn't mater, check for dicks. If it's for men there must be a dick, stiched to a boder of frame. If there is none girls will have dicks. If the don't they'll use dildos.<br>Now look at porn for women. It's 0DD almost every time. Women don't care for dicks, they want feelings. Even if all characters are men, they often neglect to draw dicks.<br><br>Tl;dr men love dicks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I watched my first hentai in years the other day. It was the one with the line "you are cordially invited to fuck my ass". It was ok. Not something I'd want to watch regularly though.  <br>Soushisouai Note was okay, as was Junkland, and Koiito Kinenbi. The Aku no Onna adaption was also decent. Featured the girls well enough though sacrificed the story in favour of so even if the story is pretty simplistic anyways. Jutaijima also was so-so, and Tentacle and Witches was also nice. Atleast the Lily moments were.</br>  <br>So, they are animating the end where Guts burns all girls? What  said.</br>  <br>Mizugi kanojo? That kunoichi has me returning to it</br>  <br> Aku no Onna <br> decent <br>It was the same as , an insult to the VN, which was really good in its category. No Lunarverse either, she was the best part.</br></br></br>  <br><br> gud  taste</br></br>  <br>It was decent in that it made me go and find the original story the girls came from, and as far as OVAs that exist to pretty much advertise their original works go that's a decent job accomplished.<br><br>Same could be said for Gakuen Saimin Reido and Gakuen 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Implying the anime was great because of the source material. The VN is generic and mediocre. The anime was great because of animation and direction none of which have anything to do with the VN. It could have been adaptation of any other of hundreds of VNs like that.</br>  <br>If I'd seen the anime first, I'd never have touched the original. It was disgusting.</br>  <br>The Serena and Oboro episode had nice scenes.</br>  <br>Nothing compared to the original, and it completely failed to show even a trace of their personalities and what makes them interesting.</br>  <br> I bet you hate Tentacle and Witches <br> Witches <br><br>Not even a little.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I was mad at Yabai! because he didn´t cum in the girls</br></br>  <br>That studio seems to be going for just doing one OVA for each work for publicity of the original and be done with it, which is a shame and Pinkpineapple also seems to be doing the same</br>  <br>i keep thinking that they're pregnant from the thumbnail</br>    <br> generic elf raped by generic foes and 30% of the screen composed of pixelated shit <br> perfect <br>k</br></br></br>   literally gorillions of NTR anime <br> all of them can only be described as NTR because the wife is a huge slut <br> none of them features the wife getting raped while the man is forced to watch <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Here is your reply</br></br>  <br><br>Yahweh</br></br>  I wish Ran Sem was as popular as Kuroinu. Then maybe we would get more episodes and a BD release.  <br>Me too, buit not generally, It seems like they have different artists for their stuff. Like Fela Pure and Baku Ane both came from Pink Pineapple, yet they have a different artstyle.</br>  <br> Watching ep3. <br> Getting a little pissed at how all the guys are brown <br> Figure it's just to help you tell the girls from the guys and that it'll be reversed for the chocoelves <br> Brown elf rape scene comes up <br> The dudes just get even browner  <br> The men basically become Nigerians by the final scene <br><br>I'm getting real tired of Japan's bullshit on this front.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Rin Sen (Or was it Ram Sem? Fuck if I know) the girl gets cucked in the end. She sees her hubby fucking another chick, gets told he loves her and is having a baby with her. The final scene is her walking up to her husband while he fucks his mistress and being utterly mindbroken by the emotions she cops. It spooked me out a little when I first saw it.</br>  <br>Hold on, didn't a new Rance series come out?</br>   recently got into gokkun and slowly into more excessive amounts of cum <br>Are there any hentai that focus on this<br><br>Like insanely massive amounts of cum<br><br>Literal cum baths and such</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miboujin Nikki The Animation<br>Sei Yariman Gakuen Enkou Nikki<br>Soushisouai Note<br>Baku Ane<br>Kanoko x Kanojo x Kanojo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Insecure skinny white boy spotted.</br>  <br>Ran Sem is known for this. Id post some examples but I don't want to get banned again.</br>  <br><br>CollaborationWorks always puts out quality material<br><br>Don't think Lilith has had anything good animated in a well.

We seem to be stuck with a short list of certain episodes of Fault!, Nee Chanto Shiyou yo!, Wet Summer Days and Jiburiru. After that we go stumbling off into modesty-crazed /e/ territory like Kissxsis and YnS. Is Japan that fucked up that they barely make any or am I just looking in the wrong places?  Whatever happened to all the good stuff? I miss the good stuff. My hentaifu needs more OVAs.  <br>We are fucked anon, I doubt we will ever get something like Mafuyu again, and if it happens will be a small scene after 20m of cowtits.</br>  <br> Jiburiru <br>And the complete version is already out, so is pretty much a lost cause</br></br>   yukikaze ep 2 never   <br>Japan is just stuck in a rut. Sex is somewhat repressed and it leads to twisted shit being fantasied about. Remember that tentacle rape started because of a time when artists weren't allowed to draw a naked man and woman together.</br>  Has any good H come out lately?  <br>Itadaki seieki<br>Kyonnyu fantasy<br><br>I'm a sucker when it comes to succubi</br></br></br></br>  <br>That cheerleader scene. Unf.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Name?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kyonnyu fantasy <br>her boobs are drawn terrible</br></br>  <br> See Otome posted for ages <br> majority of the screenshots posted show ahegao <br> people talk as if its some sick shit <br> finally watch it <br> it's bog standard NTR, though decent since young girl x dirty old men is good <br> barely any ahegao <br> the sex itself was normal too <br>The ending was good though. But it made me realize that I like my porn way more ridiculously degrading and absurd than other people apparently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>where can I subscribe?</br>  <br>I'm on mobile, so would anyone mind on providing a name? Sorry and thanks.</br>  <br>It's written right there. ヴィクトリアメイド マリアの奉仕</br>  <br>I can't read moon. Sorry.</br>  Best scene coming through  <br> barely any ahegao <br>Oh no, insufficient retarded faces. Eroanime is over.</br></br>   It's about swimsuits so it should be good <br> Animation is absolute jank <br> NTR segment right out of fucking nowhere <br><br>Fuck life.</br></br></br></br>    i wish that one show with the blue skinned girl got a second episode and her skin stayed blue      <br>ERRYBODY IN MIZUGI</br>  <br> cute and considerate <br><br>anon... ill tell you the truth, 97% of the time they are just another person that you live with<br><br>but that 3% of the time is great, and you will live for that 3%, but in the end its only 3% anyways.<br><br>dont feel too bad, but if you get a chance take it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    What I miss in hentai are expressions like in the old "I CAME" meme. Ahegao's all the rage now.  <br>Otaku are too brainwashed for that, they've seen so much ahegao they've forgotten what real orgasm faces look like. Or they never learned.</br>  /a/ I need some help, I remember watching this one hentai a while back but never remembered what it was, I know it was adapted from some hentai manga but never remembered the name. <br><br>I do remember "siblings" going on a date then banging in the shower though.</br></br>  Why are /ss/ titles so rare?<br><br>Most seem to be old as fuck and not that arousing, or if they're new they're terribly animated like the one about that kid who gets hot MILF neighbours, the concept and idea is hot, the designs are hot but the animation is fucking disgusting</br></br>  <br>I can't believe no one said Sora no Iro Mizu no Iro</br>  <br>Resort Boin is overrated, after fapping a dozen times to it, I got sick of it</br>  Watch Surf Dreaming.  <br>Shit how long do threads last in /a/? I just come here once in a while from /v/ and this is the same thread as yesterday what the hell</br>  <br>What was that one called where the girls have to get fucked and impregnated by demons and give birth to demon babies to save their friend?<br><br>My favorite scene was the giant wasp scene, god that was hot, the wasp fills her womb with eggs, egg-by-egg, then it cums insids and fertilizes the eggs inside of her, and then later she gives birth to larvas, fucking hot shit</br></br></br>  Has anyone else tried 3D CG hentai? I've been surprised a couple of times at how acceptable the quality is.  <br> Bretty gud 1st episode <br> liked the artstyle and eggs  <br> See ep2 <br> QUALITY murakami knockoff <br><br>Well the lost sides make up for the butthurt and the lost boner.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw exactly zero (0) decent futa on trap hentai   <br>That one was also shit</br>  <br>The loli scene was interesting, but aside from that, yes.</br>  <br>If its animated at 30 fps, I won't watch it.</br>  <br>Damn, what's it called? That sounds fucking awesome. Can't remember any insect rape hentai outside eroge and the odd doujin.</br>  <br><br> insects <br>Disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Monstrous insects defiling girls are great, don't be a pleb</br>  It has 24 episodes. Start watching faggots.  <br>no thanks</br>  Watched it ages ago, don't remeber shit except for the indirect kissing slut.

They're nothing but offtopic shit by people from /tg/.   Female elves crave human cock so badly <br><br>Why are male elves such cucks to inferior species?</br></br>    Do you people honestly not see that Mari is the best girl? Sure she's a little obnoxious at first, but later on she becomes much more likable.  How are these threads not deleted? They are awful shitposting threads meant to get a rise out of people and not actually discuss anything of worth.  <br> She tried to isolate them from making any female friends and goaded them into getting expelled.  <br><br>Read the fucking manga faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you read the manga, faggot? That's exactly what happens.</br>  I really don't understand what some people see in Hana, unless you have a disgusting fetish for piss. She's a cunt as well. Like did you see all the beatings she gave Gakuto.  <br>People give "cute" girls a pass for being girls, disgusting , I know.</br>  We always tend to argue over which girl is best girl from anime, but how about which is WORST girl?<br><br>You have 10 seconds to name a girl from anime that's worse than Pinkshit from Naruto.<br><br>Protip: YOU FUCKING CAN'T</br></br></br></br>  Your Waifu.  <br>I haven't watched Naruto because I'm not a masochist, but she seems pretty cute.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Oh you have NO idea. Sakura is easily the most insufferable cunt that I've ever seen in anime.</br>  Bam, thread over and we can all go home.<br><br>And leave Sakura alone, she already knows she's terrible since she's taking care of her husband's kid by some other bitch.</br></br>  Literally every tsundere main girl in a generic harem. <br><br>Bonus points if they're flat and voiced kugimiya rie.</br></br>  <br> you're waifu <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br> You have 10 seconds to name a girl from anime that's worse than Pinkshit from Naruto. <br><br>Why would you start the thread with possibly the worst character in the history of anime/manga that even the author hates?</br></br></br>    <br>  </br>  I would argue Flay Allster from Gundam SEED. She was a completely manipulative slut who used Jesus Yamato's feelings for her to get revenge. Arguably her actions did actually help move the plot along. Still, a total whore.  This little cuntmuffin.  <br>Kishimoto actually likes her, he just can't write women so they don't come out as dumb cunts. All good females in Naruto are good because he didn't pay attention to them.</br>  <br>Flay is so fucking terrible i had actually purged her from my memory until just now.</br>  <br/>  <br>Would you not cum on her forehead?</br>  <br>No. I would shoot it with a gun.</br>  <br>Kishi reached a point where even he himself had realized that he had fucked up with Sakura's character and publicly admitted that she's "a horrible person", at which point he began upgrading Hinata to become more of the lead heroine in the series.</br>  <br> saying no to this <br><br>You're probably as much of a faggot as Sasuke.</br></br></br>   anyone shittier than pinkshit <br><br>nobodies more terrible than sakura. she fails more on parenting than sasuke</br></br>  <br>I'd rather say yes to this titfucking Hinata.<br><br>Also, calling Sasuke a faggot is an insult to people who really are gay.<br><br>Sasuke is just asexual and not to mention a complete autist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh yeah we mention worse girl all the time, you're Just new</br>  <br>What I mean is that we don't shame worst girls as often as we should.</br>  Too easy    <br>Karin is not the mother</br>  <br>Sure you would but I didn't give you a choice.<br><br>If you wouldn't fuck Sakura, you're probably a faggot. She's sexy as fuck.</br></br></br>  Haven't kept up with Naruto ever since the main-manga ended. Is The Last finally out in good quality?  <br>Two days 'til Jap BD. Expect a high quality rip + subs shortly after.</br>  <br> the Nurutu movie will get subs before the Psycho-Pass movie </br>  <br>Karin is hotter and even Sauce agree.</br>  <br> &gt;the Nurutu movie will get subs before the Psycho-Pass movie <br>Obviously since the Nurutu movie already have official subs.</br></br>   naruto   <br>I've started watching it.<br>So far she seems like a bothersome cunt but I actually dislike Hinata more.<br>She's just "Oh look so shy uguu".<br>At least at this point.<br>Sasuke hasn't went full edgelord as everyone says yet.<br>Also didn't expect to like Rock Lee.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching Naruto </br>  <br>I played the Ultimate Storm game and the animations and shit looked really interesting.<br>Its not as bad as I thought so far.<br>I hear it really goes to fucking shit though; especially when it hits shippuden.</br></br></br>  <br>this manhating cunt right here</br>   tries to kill literally everybody   <br>Junko tried to kill literally everybody. Aoi just let herself become a pawn. Her DR2 counterpart really is worst girl though.</br>  this cum guzzling little slut  <br>Reverse image search isnt giving me anything. who is she?</br>  <br> hating best girl <br><br>You should try to kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a man. And I love big tits.</br>  <br>Satoko from Higurashi.</br>  <br> No having 10Gb of p0rn of WORST girl in your External HDD </br>  <br> YOU FUCKING CAN'T <br>Ha.</br></br>  The only good thing about Sakura is the fanart depicting her as the badass that the series failed to deliver.  <br> Beginning of part 2 <br> Sakura getting better and more useful <br> starting to like Naruto <br> Sasuke returns <br> Loses all character development and becomes more insufferable than ever before <br><br>It's easy to see where it all went wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asahina who got manipulated by a diabolical scheme <br> Not Celes who killed Hifumi and Taka also trying to kill everybody but for a million bucks fully aware she got played just so she can live her chuuni delusion even at the cost of sacrificing everyone else.Including accusing Taka of having raped her and trying to pin the murders on Hagakure. <br><br>Celes a fucking shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So everything bad can be directly traced to Sasuke?</br>  <br>Those are the absolute worst kind of girls.Accusing guys they raped her when it ain't true.</br>  <br>Shots fired. Someone call the paramedics.</br>  <br><br>Misato is better than both</br></br>  <br>Kishi probably read a poll and realize how popular was Sasusaku. Japan's national motto is "if ain't broken, don't fix it". Some may say that Kishi gave so much importance to Sasuke for the same reason but I think Kishi is genuinely in love of the sauce while he can't find a reason why Sakura loves Sasuke</br>  <br><br>See</br></br>  <br>she was always shit even with out sasuke she was a shit tsunderer trash</br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with Sakura except that they forgot to develop her character early on so she ended up being behind everyone else, which was unfixable without having a bunch of arcs dedicated to only developing her character, which of course they couldn't do since she wasn't popular as a MC type character like Naruto and Sasuke were. Just make her learn to be some kind of badass in some way early on, and suddenly the problem fixes itself for the entire rest of the show without even changing anything else</br>  ruined the fucking show  Pic related.<br>Literally the most autistic, pathetic and beta heroine I've seen in ages.</br>  <br>Sasuke is at least 90% of what is wrong with Sakura. Both her bitchiness towards Naruto and her general uselessness can be attributed to her obsession with him</br>  <br> liking a slut who admits she sleeps around cause she doesn't like to be cold in bed,so she seeks out warmth from other people bodies, and likes to fill the hole of emptiness with sex </br>  <br><br>How about:<br><br>Haru in Nisekoi<br>Manami in Oreimo<br><br>You litterally can't top this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata body is ruined by her terribad fashion sense.</br>  <br>Considering how many women can relate to Sakura and root for sasusaku, I think Kishi did something right</br>  <br>Early/mid-shippuuden (with the Hidan and Kakuzu fight, Sasuke and Itachi fight, Pain vs Jiraiya and Naruto vs Pain) is the peak of the Naruto series though. At that point it's legitimately fucking amazing.<br><br>Other than that it's mostly garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>She's delicious brown though. You can't hate delicous brown.</br>  <br>The real problem is that she does not possess an actual character, any ideas behind who she is besides Kishi's idea of an average girl who eventually had Tsunade's moveset grafted onto her.<br><br>I wouldn't even mind her being a cunt all that much if people called her out on her. Part 2 ino would have been a great opportunity, someone who now gets on well with her team, is a good coordinator and unlike Pinkshit seems to have developed, if offscreen, from the shallow fangirl that both she and Sakura were in Part 1. Maybe make Sakura realise that despite having been granted powers solely on the grounds that she was the third wheel of muh Team 7, she is nowhere near as effective team member as her rival is. Bam, development.<br>Instead, even when Naruto calls her bullshit confession, he only tells her that she is lying to herself as well as him, rather than outright telling her to stop presuming the world revolves around her.<br><br>Hell, maybe do something with the whole illusion angle she was stated to be good at instead of the medical stuff that makes her butthurt over not grabbing the limelight every single fight she's in, and throw in some more clever, basic stuff with tools as opposed to the divine gift her (ex) team members were using all the fucking time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They just want to fuck Sasuke themselves</br>  <br>Being cute but having no flair for fashion and hiding her assets behind comfortable clothing was a core element of her character, and it is a nice detail about her.</br>  <br> She'll be badass in my private headcanon. </br>  <br>They actually hate Sakura too, just like they hate themselves.</br>  <br>Got dang</br>  <br> muh cute and shy moeblob <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a charm point I say. Naruto isn't known for his good fashion sense either.</br>  <br>10/10 should have been the lean, well-built action girl.<br>Sakura's thing actually works by magic manipulation, not through muscles. The pic's nice, but all it has in common with Pinkshit is the colour of her hair.</br></br>  <br>At least she snapped Naruto out of quitting. Sakura on the other hand couldn't go through with doing anything to Sasuke. Even Naruto who was also a big doormat concerning Sasuke was at least willing to trade blows with the guy.</br>  <br>Horrible NTRing bitch</br>  <br> one thinks wearing horrible neon orange tracksuits is a sensible idea for a ninja <br> the other does not give a single fuck about fashion or prettying herself up as she's got a case of single target sexuality and does not want to attract anyone else <br> the two have a /fa/ as fuck son <br>That's actually pretty fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She only fucked Kaji</br>  <br> Hur dur there's nothing wrong with Sakura except she never developed and stayed the same as she was in chapter 1, that is an unlikable cunt. <br><br>Sakura up until Shippuden was popular with Japnese fans, but she kept disappointing them and so they gave up on her.</br></br></br>  <br>Most women actually hate Sakura, its only the loud ones you hear a lot but even tumblr the females who like her and Sasuke are actually in the minority.</br>  <br>Not saying that Sakura is any better, but Hinata is a boring doormat character also. Hinatafags are also the worse there is.</br>  <br>She was a cunt sure, but she had an interesting character arc. When she died, the tone of the original show died with her and paved way for the less dark and more kid friendly turd known as Gundam Seed Destiny. I am not saying Seed was a masterpiece, but it sure as hell was better than Destiny.</br>  <br>Isn't that literally what I just said? They didn't develop her enough, so she became unpopular. Maybe she was more popular at the start with Japanese fans than she was with American fans (because Americans are obsessed with feminism and Japanese people aren't as much), but the actual lack of development was still the problem regardless</br>  <br>Sakurafags only care about the fanon version of her.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but what the fuck did she even do in part 1 to get popular in the first place?<br> dramatic haircut that achieved nothing <br> mutual knockout in her one proper fight (and would have lost completely if not for magical multiple personality disorder), in all others just standing in the back with a kunai <br> jumps inbetween Nardo and Sausage launching their most powerful attacks at each other, by all rights the point where she should have died </br></br></br></br>  <br>This. People act as if hinata is the best female in the series because of "muh naruto". She's better than sakura but that doesn't say much and hinata is basically a doormat as you said.</br>  <br>She drives? weren't they supposed to be high school freshmen/juniors? I don't know myself, but I doubt Japanese driver's license is for people under 18.</br>  <br>Gundam SEED Destiny never happened.</br>  fact:Yostuba is the worst girl in the series<br>fact:Fuuka is the best girl</br>  <br>I agree with <br><br>I think it's totally fine that she was obsessed with Sasuke at first. Damn, I'm even okay with her staying that way until meeting again with Sasuke in part two. It's pretty psycho that way but it would have worked if she were allowed to move on. Instead she's emotional garbage.<br><br>Her skillset has been worse than Naruto's since the beginning of part 2. As it's a battle shounen, this is the biggest insult.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get advertised a lot. Have slutty pink hair.</br>  <br> but Hinata is a boring doormat character <br><br> is perfectly aware of her main character flaw and her foremost goal is to correct it and become a better person <br> fights Neji who does everything she can but better and then some, he takes his sweet time as he picks her motivations, beliefs and sense of self apart, psychoanalyzing her to hell and back, yet she stubbornly refuses to yield, standing up time and time again <br> is willing to stand up to a living god who just nuked her hometown to protect the man she loves, declaring her feelings and overcoming her greatest fault <br> when said man is in his lowest point she slaps some sense into him, and rallies him as well as the whole army <br><br>Those are just the most obvious points. It is okay to not like Hinata, but form a criticism of her that is actually true as she's not a doormat. Gentle, kind, reserved, even demure, perhaps, but that is a far cry from being a doormat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up fag</br>  <br>don't forget she ripped a mans eyes off</br>  It was only a matter of time.  <br>I was thinking more about her characterization within the main series.<br>You are right, though, she gets some good stuff in the Last. Plucking her sister's eyes right out of her captor's skull while he screams for mercy was pretty neat.</br></br>  <br>All of these are typical waifubait traits for self-insert fags. <br><br>I bet you think Onodera and Kobeni are well written characters too.</br></br></br>  <br>The question at hand isn't about whether the character is written well. This is fucking Naruto we are talking about, nothing really lives up to any proper standards of quality.<br>The question was whether the character in question is a doormat, like you said she was. I have demonstrated that she is not.</br></br>  <br>Just read the manga if you're gonna pick up Naruto. Studio Pierrot fucking sucks.</br>  <br>No one except Kakashi is well written in Naruto.</br>  <br>Just admit you don't like Hinata because of her personality and just leave it like that.</br>  <br>Keep with the games, even Kishi said they are the best way to enjoy the story.</br>  <br><br>shut up.</br></br>  <br>Jiraiya has his moments, when Kishi isn't trying to rip off/reference Master Roshi with him.</br>  <br>Jaraiya?</br>  <br>It's weird because she both made the show better and worse. Yui needed a foil like Mio was to Ritsu and Yui and Mugi had zero chemistry with each other. Seriously, the group is dull as fuck without Azusa, she may be a nagging no fun allowed bitch, but she makes the show less dull even though she is annoying a lot of the time. She makes it better because my dick.</br>  <br>Muh naruto.</br>  <br><br>and shw was a doormat how?</br></br>  <br>To bad she's actually completely fucking useless in combat.</br>  <br><br>Yeah he has his moments too.</br></br>    <br>Except she isn't. Naruto and Sakura are bigger doormats than her.</br>  <br>I agree it was fine in the beginning. If it was any other story I would say you're supposed to not like Sakura then, but Kishimoto seems to think MUH SASUKE is romantic.<br><br>The worst part is that she WAS getting some development but she regressed back to her former self because Kishi couldn't come up with a plausible reason why she would love Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you're a faggot to let someone's personal choice in fashion cock block you.<br><br>Literally no fucks given to yourself I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura was hated from the very beginning. Especially by female readers, which is ironic since Kishi wrote Sakura with a female audience in mind. Kishi publicly admitted that making Sakura was a mistake.</br>  <br>That was one of the most endearing moments in the manga. Hinata wanted no more of Naruto's doom and gloom. That was not what she saw in him, and that is not what she fell in love with.</br>  <br>At least with Naruto it is justified in that he had the bad luck of having made his first friendship with Sausage after 12 years of being a hated/feared pariah with low self esteem, no social skills who was incredibly lonely, and they even started to develop an actual friendship/rivalry thing. <br>It's still fucked up and turns incredibly gay without Kishi even meaning to make it so, but from with a character who has massive abandonment issues I could see him imprinting on the idea of being best friends with an edgy murderous crazy bastard and carrying on with that idea to an irrational degree.<br><br>Sakura just wanted to fuck him because all the girls wanted to too, possibly also because he's a handsome bad guy later on.<br>The one good thing is that once she did get around to breeding with him no one else wanted to, having found better people they cared about on a personal level and everyone but her found happiness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this. Hinata was truly best girl and she deserved to win the Narubowl.</br>  <br> Kishi publicly admitted that making Sakura was a mistake <br>I fucking despise her character, but you gotta drop some sauce for that to be believed.</br></br>    <br>Sakura would've been a better character if she just given up on sauke like ino did in part two. She doesn't necessary need to be with naruto but find someone else besides sasuke and show some character development. In the end she just became a stupid bitch who fucked a guy who tried to kill her at least twice or more.</br>  <br>She was a doormat character up until she confessed her love to Naruto. Fighting Neji didn't remove that doormat characteristic of her considering she was mostly trying to defend ''muh Nuruto's beliefs''. It took I don't know how many chapters for her to stop being a doormat so at this point, even though you're not for the last 10 chapters, you're still known as the doormat character.<br><br><br>Do you even know what a doormat is, you fucking retard?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> this thread <br> 0 pictures of Kirino <br> cntl-f kirino <br> 0 results <br> yet this image is posted <br><br>You've changed, /a/. I expected Kirino spam in this thread. I am proud of you. Manami a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino or Lee could have both been candidates, bot both deserve to have someone better thank Pinkshit.</br>  <br>Temari?Tsunade?Kushinu?<br>How was hinata best girl?<br>Could care less about the narutobowl because she was the only one in it.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you OP. This is literally waifuwars: the thread</br>  <br>Any girl from Sword Art Online.</br>  <br><br>The fuck even are you talking about? Hinata was fighting for herself, to prove that she changed against Neji.<br><br>Neji told her to forfeit several times but she didn't not because to defend Naruto's beliefs, to defend herself. Naruto simply inspired her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To keep a figure that thick, and healthy you need an appetite to support it.</br>  <br>Sasusaku recently won an internet poll as the best couple. Also, nurutu isn't precisely the kind of TV show that attract a sophisticated audience</br>  <br> Fighting Neji didn't remove that doormat characteristic of her considering she was mostly trying to defend ''muh Nuruto's beliefs''. <br>She stood up for herself and the things she believed in. She was completely outclassed and already beaten, but called Neji out on his bullshit to a degree that it turned a feasible opportunity to belittle her and show off into getting told hard enough to make him lose his cool and attempt to fucking murder her right there.<br>Having been inspired by the MC to aspire to her goals does not change that she is not a doormat.<br><br>Her previous appearances before that were as a productive team member, someone skilled at academics or spying with her Byakugan and as a person willing to take a risk for someone whom she cared for. That was the lowest, most passive state and the earliest bit of her character arc we have seen her in, when she had trouble looking people in the eye.<br><br>As I said, it is okay to not like quiet and reserved, nice characters. But you don't need to pull unfounded bullshit out of your ass to support that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>* she didn't forfeit. and not to defend Naruto's beliefs, to defend herself.<br><br>Naruto's nindou simply inspired her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it was a rigged poll. ssfags on tumblr spammed the poll.</br></br>  <br>Even though lee showed much affection to sakura and went through shit in the chunin exam for her she still didn't love him. Don't know what she sees in sasuke. Sakura has been ignored by sauke throughout most of the series yet she still loves him. Her relationship with sasuke is the biggest reason why people hate her guts. There is no real reason for her to love sasuke so much.</br>  <br> Caring about internet polls <br><br>You are this retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> internet poll <br>And which internet poll was that?</br></br>  Takiko from Tokyo Ravens  <br>Most of these faggots don't read the manga anyway. Only known because of memers. I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br> Even though lee showed much affection to sakura and went through shit in the chunin exam for her she still didn't love him. <br>Eh, she's a cunt but it's ardly fair to expect her to just will herself to feel shit she does not. She clearly developed a degree of respect/affection for the guy, just not romantically.<br>Now if she actually questioned herself on what does it say about her, liking a guy who tolerates her at best and shunning others who stood up for her, even burning bridges of friendship for him, maybe she would not be as completely shit a character as she ended up as.</br></br></br>  <br>God, the first part of Naruto was so good.</br>  <br>Rock Lee is "ugly" compared to the prodigy Edgelord. Most woman in manga are portrayed to be pretty shallow. Mainly because they are written by dudes to appeal to little boys.</br>  <br> The one good thing is that once she did get around to breeding with him no one else wanted to <br>Karin wanted. Probably Ino too, considering she married Sai aka Sasuke's poor man</br></br>  <br>Yeah that's when the series naruto was at its best.</br>  <br>Female readers support their shallowness though. Read shoujo and watch K-drama</br>  <br>I just had a thread about her on /r/anime.<br>Naruto is the best anime.</br></br>  <br> Most woman in manga are portrayed to be pretty shallow. Mainly because they are written by dudes to appeal to little boys. <br>That's actually a great life lesson to teach little boys. Act like an edgelord and treat girls like shit and you'll have them on your cock. Act like a good guy and they'll friendzone you the rest of your life.<br><br>Kishimoto is actually a genius.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It works on every female-aimed media</br>  <br>Rock lee was a pretty good character back in the day</br>  <br>If you truly played the games then you should know how terrible Sakura is.</br>  <br><br> Naruto <br> best anime <br><br>And I bet that Sakura is your waifu, too<br><br>Fuck off back to Reddit, faggot. And take your troll bait with you, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rock Lee and Gai were cringy as fuck, bitches don't like that, and certainly the prom queen of bitches Sakura didn't like that.<br><br>Shit Sakura reminds me of those girls who were always on the bad guy's dick and then end up with three children and a guy who beats her shit for not being young</br></br></br>  <br>sakura is shit in any way possible</br>  Narutards really are desperate.<br><br>Everything to have a thread I guess.</br></br>  <br>This. Sakura was a realistic bitch. The problem is how Kishi refused to write Naruto accordingly. No one admires a loser emasculated Nice Guy who lets himself be abused by a cunt. Women aren't attracted to such loser men and men don't want to be the guy who gets beat up by twats (which explains why only masochist losers like harem protagonists).</br>  All the bossy little meganekko bitches who turned out the way that they did because they have to wear glasses. I have yet to see an actually badass meganekko who isn't a total pretentious bitch or a clueless airhead. If someone can suggest me one I'll give you a cookie :D  Don't make challenges you can't win.  <br>Lee was just as bad. Especially since his dream still had him fucking Sakura.</br>  <br>To be fair now it's realistic. Women DON'T like Nice Guys. They don't get moist or turned on by such decent men. Only men respect Nice Guys and see them as stable individuals. But pussy? Pussy ain't getting tingles for Nice Guys so there you go.<br><br>If anything the best type of protagonists treat females poorly or are asexual. Shame that when it comes to asexual male characters in anime the cliche is retards like Luffy.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128351882 <br>I don't remember Sakura abusing Naruto that much though. You sure you are not confusing SP fillershit with her? She only hit him like three times early on and then once after the timeskip out of 700 chapters.</br>  <br>Women don't care about Nice guys or bad guys. They just care about resources. You need resources to get a girl.</br>  This dipshit. Right here.  <br>The best male character in Naruto was Shikamaru because he seriously reflects the current cultural values of young men in Japan. Meaning he finds pussy too much trouble/work to be worthwhile. Didn't his ideal dream involve the same simple life he was already leading under Madara's genjutsu?</br>  <br>You never heard of Alpha Fucks &amp; Beta Bucks? Thugs, cads, assholes, etc type of men generally have an easy time getting laid. Resources on the other hand are for the beta guys who are women's Plan B when they decide to settle down (meaning they get old to the point these alpha guys don't want them anymore and start going for the new crop of young women).<br><br>Having resources is just a sign of a man who women will parasite off of. And no, these women may use the resources to be provided for, but they do not love these men themselves. Just their provisions.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>But what gets on my nerves is when they start saying shit like "where are all the nice guys?", bitch, they are right there where you left them, in the friendzone.</br></br>  <br>Keeping her dangerous weapons concealed like a real ninja.</br>  <br>The typical shoujo fantasy is an irredemeable asshole who happen to be rich and the best at sports and grades without even trying</br>  <br>Not only do they leave them in the friendzone, but a saying that's catching on nowadays is:<br><br>"You left them in your early 20s."<br><br>Because let's face it, long term commitment is for the young and ignorant male. The longer a man grows into being single the less likely he'll have an interest in the rotten deal that is cohabitation/marriage. Ideally men want to experience the opposite sex when young because the thought of doing it when he's in his 30s with a woman who is ALSO in her 30s is a huge turn off as the woman is no longer at her prime.<br><br>There's a reason the saying "Men age like wine, but women age like milk" exists. It's damn true. No man wants a woman that is old, especially when you consider that a woman in today's world who is past her 20s has likely slept around and has been pumped and dumped by many other cocks making her sexual value zilch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Most rich men are assholes. If not all. You have to step over people to remain or stay rich after all.</br>  <br>She's not a doormat. That's just how fillers portray her because they go lowest common denominator.</br>  <br>True but not precisely the kind of asshole women dig</br>  <br>I'm going by the manga not the fillertarded anime.</br>  <br>Pussy tingles for dominant males who are strong, some kind of instinct for creating stronger offspring perhaps?<br><br>Most of them just tend to be assholes to girls. If they're not then they tend to fall into to many cliches like this dude</br></br></br>  <br>this pink shit. good god was she awful.</br>  If women dig assholes, why anons can't get laid? 4chan is full of assholes  <br>Does Salad count?</br>  <br>And for what it's worth, it's a bit shocking to see how many rich men even now still get raped in divorce. A fool and his money are soon parted.<br><br>It's especially shocking when said rich men divorce repeatedly like that actor John Cleese (got reamed in divorce 4 times) and now is truly broke. Then there are other sad stories like Robin Williams who everyone knows could not retire because of alimony payments, poor abused old dog ultimately killed himself because of parasite ex-wives.</br></br></br>  <br>because we are too sad. We have no lives. We have to fap to lolis instead. Lolis are the exception. Lolis dig Onii-chans, not assholes.</br>  <br>I don't know about John Cleese but Robin Williams was a junkie. His multiple marriages were just a sympton of his fucked up mind</br>  <br>those fucking whores</br>  <br> im a fucking retarded midget who loves to be abused </br>  <br> Haru in Nisekoi <br><br>Ayane Sakura in charge of voicing annoying tsungires.png</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Robin Williams was always too fucking high to think about things straight<br><br>He shoulda married cocaine</br></br></br>  <br>Ssfags voted for them and other people voted for them out of spite. Both characters are so terrible that they deserve nothing else but each other so that that level of shit could be contained.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure other people vote for Naruhina or their OTP rather than waste a vote on 2 characters they hate. Is it really that hard to believe? Women love crap like Hana Yori Dango and Itazura na kiss. The latter is still an abusive relationship even after marriage</br>  <br>Not really. Kishi did say a little girl came up and told him she hated Sakura. She was definitely not alone in that opinion.</br>  <br>I think anon means that people who for one reason or another were not happy with NH voted for SS as a protest.<br>I still think giving opinion polls and voting about non-concrete issues is fucking retarded.</br></br>  <br>Eh. Bad boys are definitely more attractive to most women but you have to draw the line when they try to murder you or if they are apathetic or condescending to your entire existence. <br>It's okay to appreciate them from afar but don't try to get into a relationship with someone who fully intended to kill you. That should go without saying.</br></br>  <br>You haven't even given us the source on the poll. Furthermore It's an internet poll.</br>  <br>That little girl is still into prince charmings. Once the hormones kick, it's all about dreamy wife beaters and the prince charming degrade into a "nice guy"</br>  <br>It won because ssfags advertised the shit out of it and it's very popular on tumblr. <br>Did any of the other ships try to rally votes like that?</br></br>    <br>I don't really see why people do this shit at all. Their voting achieves exactly fuck all.</br>  <br>I rarely see any girl (or boy) who actually like Sakura unless they already ship SS. <br>That phase of liking abusive relationships is mostly contained to teenage fangirls. After that they will want a rich or handsome guy who treats them right and is good with kids. <br>Ugly nice guys who are poor are shit out of luck. It's for the best so they don't pass on their loser genes.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like a medal for them. Naruhinas would be obnoxious about it if their OTP won. Any shipperfag would. That's one of the reasons why shipping faggotry is cancer</br>  <br> After that they will want a rich or handsome guy who treats them right and is good with kids. <br> what's 50 Shades of Grey? <br> what's every Fabio-on-the-cover novel? </br></br></br>  <br>That's just how that fandom is. Since their ship is so hated they feel they have got something to prove. Winning a poll is like validation for them.<br>They could probably rally enough votes to say Sakura is the most beloved female character of all time, despite everyone knowing that is bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br>everyone in 11eyes</br></br>  <br>No I'm talking about people who hate Sasuke and Sakura and so would rather they be together rather than with a decent character.</br>  <br><br>I can't even imagine what it must be like to actually gleam a portion of your identity from wanting to Sri Lankan graffiti characters fuck, never mind who the actual characters are.<br>Just enjoy cute fanart on pixxiv and keep it at that, is that so fucking hard? Sakurafags tend to be women, who tend to be the most fanart-production prone, so I imagine there must be a fuckton.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, yes. Everyone told me to watch Toradora because I enjoyed Clannad. I couldn't make it past episode 5 because I just couldn't handle her. She was too much of a bitch and Toradora wasn't even that good to me. The main character kept on stuttering every time someone talked to him and that was just annoying (at least in my opinion).</br></br>  <br>50 shades of Grey appeals to the teenage girl in women. But women don't want that shit in real life.</br>  Singlehandedly killed the whole show.  <br>Whatever man. The point is women dig that kind of shit on fiction. Hell, if I was a shoujo editor, I wouldn't let a mangaka to make a nice guy end. This is a business</br>  <br>No females who like Sakura then to immature and delusiional bitches, who hide their bitchiness under the moniker of them being "feminists". <br><br>Besides LadyGT there really aren't that many fanartists who draw Sakura, because again most women hate her.</br></br></br>  I win.  <br> Assmad Sakurafag calling my post bait <br><br>Typical. <br><br>Also, Hinata&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sakura</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In fiction being the key word here, and even then we are talking about a certain type of woman, aka a much older woman who hasn't gotten any in a while. <br><br>Actually the prince character is very popular in Shougo titles.</br></br></br>   singlehandedly killed the series   <br>Maybe on the 70s, when shoujo was writen by men. The current best selling title is Ao Haru Ride and the male lead is a by-the-number emo douchebag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128357750 <br>I don't know. I live on a third world shithole and it's common for men to cheat and hit their wives</br>  <br/>   awful tsundere <br> obnoxious drama queen <br> fanbase that rivals Narutards in shittiness <br><br>At least she loses hard.</br></br></br></br>   Tomo a shit.   <br>I agree.</br>    <br>/thread</br>  <br>I never seen such a wrong opinion about anything before.</br>  But she got cucked by Sasuke and is actually forced to raise his child with that redhead whore.  <br> But women don't want that shit in real life <br>Bwahahahaha.</br></br>  <br>This is true in my case.  When the fuck is Loyalty updating? I think the author is entering the air force in Aug. </br>  To lewd or not to lewd is the question.  I want to love Shovel    <br>I would say lewd but you guys dont understand how to lewd properly. Being lewd doesnt mean being stupid whores. It doesn't mean asking for cum. Being lewd is simpler than that. Lewdness is an art form that must be subtle yet daring. It is hard to perfect. But all the lewd I ever see is just girls with condoms or acting like sluts. Especially when it is cakes they must retain their purity while displaying the lewd</br>    <br> they watch you unzip your pants </br>  <br>This is how i like my lewds.

Fuck winter.  <br>believe it or not, some people just don't like the heat, and don't care about the ebin summer maymay.</br>    <br>Are Koreans immune to these or does it kill them too?</br>  <br>It will.<br>Seeing how hot this summer is, winter will be extra cold again.</br></br>   tfw 49° <br><br>you niggas know nothing</br></br>  <br>Humid heat is the worst. You're not human.</br>  Winter is much better than summer. In the winter when it gets really cold you can just add layers upon layers or just wrap up in a blanket. There's no end to the amount you can use.<br>In the summer though there's only so much you can shed before you start to break laws. Even in the comfort of your own home it's not like you can shed forever.<br><br>There are a bunch of other things that make it better though. Of course, Autumn/Spring are much better.</br></br></br>  <br>Do koreans die to fans or something?</br>  <br>Koreans have a superstition that having a fan on and pointed at you all night while you sleep can kill you.</br>  <br>That doesn't even make the least bit of sense, but okay.</br>  <br>This makes sense logically but it's not true. It's pretty difficult to stay warm when the temperature's subzero, and it's not like your face and hands are going to be sufficiently covered. Being really sweaty &gt; constantly shivering</br>  <br>Of course it doesn't. But all cultures have some kind of superstition that doesn't make the least bit of sense, yet is widely believed anyway.</br>  BUT WHY SPEND 300$ ON IT YEAH IT LOOKS COOL BUT IT DOESNT EVEN DO ANYTHING YOU CANT HAVE FOR 30$  <br>Nah, get decent gloves and your hands will be fine. Face is a little tricky but a thick hat can cover your ears and you'll be good unless there's heavy windchill blowing at you. If you still got face problems you can wear a skii mask for maximum comfy and warmth.</br>  <br>Pretty sure America doesn't. We just have isolated pockets of conspiratards who believe in inane shit similar to that, nothing widespread.</br>  <br>Yeah I don't get it.<br><br>Like in Winter when it's 27°c in my room I'm dying too hot open the windows. <br><br>In summer I set my AC to 27°c aka 80F and I'm cold. Probably the way AC works since it blows colder air and it hits me directly. But the thermostats in my room show 27°c. <br><br>Whats even more funny i'm feeling 27°c as cold while it's 40°c outside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do people have more free time in summer ?<br>The whole summer thing is stupid as fuck, you can go online everyday</br></br>  <br>That and you can use hand-warmers if you really don't want to wear gloves.</br>  <br><br><br><br>What i really hate about winter is having to leave a warm and cozy place and head out into the cold and when you start sweating under all those clothes even if its cold outside</br></br></br></br>  <br> heavy windchill  <br>which there is<br>always</br></br></br>  <br>It's a lot easier for high schoolers and college students to post 24/7</br>  <br>I know exactly what you mean.

I get like a weeks worth out of it a year, but it's worth it if I ever need to walk anywhere really far or stand out in the cold for long time.<br><br><br>Shouldn't you be researching at your research base in Antarctica instead of shitposting?</br></br></br></br></br>     mfw it hits around/over 30°c   <br><br>But it's the ice cream of the future.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck do these things work?</br>  <br>KERO KERO KERO KERO</br>  <br>Take a picture outside your window</br>  <br> yfw allergies are actually a result of an over-active immune system <br> yfw an over-active immune system is probably an adaptive trait to inhibit parasites and infections <br> yfw we're actually genetically superior, we just live in too clean of a world now. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 34C where I am right now.

This isn't a competition.  <br>Her voice is the main reason I enjoyed shelling her so much, it was so annoying I just had to shell her. If it weren't for shiplocking I would've sent my hotels and other strongest ships for overkill.</br>  <br><br>I know they don't care about the Abyssals at all, but that voice casting was so blatantly miscast.</br></br>  I would buy this magazine  <br>Who want a new oni in the next event?</br>  <br><br>They missed such a great opportunity with Oni's voice. At least fanart had some interesting input for her personality.</br></br>  <br> 異国の地。。。異国の海。。。 <br>Wouldn't be an event without an enemy that spams one annoying line.

I think she fits that role already.</br>  <br>Fuck, forgot pic related.</br>  <br>That's not Murakumo</br>  <br>You did it!</br>  <br> neet hime </br>  <br>Too developed for 17 and new one gotta be 14ish-looking with small breasts.</br>  <br>There's only sluts in this family.</br>  <br><br>I think you mean adorable.</br></br>  <br>Why? No one looks at them after they finish monthlies which only takes a few sorties.</br>  <br>They're pure, they just have a passion for yogurt<br><br>So awkward that she ends up being cute in a weird way?</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's some middle ground for them.</br></br>  <br> Ritou <br> hime </br></br>  <br>What monthlies take you to 5-2?</br>  <br>Yeah my bad, meant weekly.</br>  <br>It's just her thighs, her breasts aren't too big.</br>    <br>How come?</br>  <br>Remember when BB Hime was a cockblocker and not just some worm that can't do more than single digit damage even with a yasen cut-in?</br>  Summer in the countryside.  <br> Am I being baited? <br>Just curious, none of my textbooks work that way. They usually print the answers at the end of the book or just omit it altogether.</br></br>  <br>I was expecting a "No"</br>    Natsumi and nii-chan have some sexual tension going on. Also why must Ren-chon suffer?  <br> classy </br>  Cu Chulainn is best Lancer  Scathach is going to prove why she is the greatest.  So apparently the fateverse is pretty large, even within the fuckhuge nasuverse. I've only gone as far as finishing UBW and don't think I'm up to the task of reading/playing/etc every single piece of related media.<br><br>There are obviously a lot of questions to ask, some more relevant than others, but is there any real reason that the servants all seem to be relatively nonfictional? It seemed to make a point of clarifying that fictional beings can be servants too if they're well enough known, but the ones I've heard of have all been at least somewhat historical, if embellished.<br><br>Obviously getting Caster-class Harry Potter or Saber-class Link or someshit like that would be full retard, and not just because modern pop culture characters aren't really that well known in the grand scheme of human consciousness, but I feel like I'm being rused when the story intentionally opens a door and shows you that it's open, but then refuses to walk through it. Obviously, pic related is a notable exception, but I feel like there should be more from the ones I know of so far.<br><br>Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, Robin Hood, Odysseus, Superman, Hamlet, Sherlock Holmes, and so on. Although I doubt how those last two would fare in a grail war on mostly just wits. I just feel like if they weren't going to explore that avenue more thoroughly, why make a point of specifically explaining that aspect? You could just as easily incorporate a small handful by making the rule "historical people only" and having the fictional servants be exceptions, god knows there's enough breaking of its own rules anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilles is also a wraith like Kojiro, the real Gilles in the Nasuverse actually was the victim of false accusations for his lands.</br>  <br>Based Towel Archer.</br>  <br>The impact of how many people know a hero is extremely small, this post is practically irrelevant.<br><br>You don't have to be able to recite Beowulf, you just need to have a general concept of his weapons or powers. Even knowing the name is decent enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a link or a source to this? I love Zero and the rest of the Nasuverse but never heard anything like this.</br>  <br/>   BASEBALL EPISODE <br>MAEDA DOES IT AGAIN!</br>  <br>oh hey we're in refrain already</br>  Was this show supposed to be fun from the beginning or is Maeda really slipping on the sad scenes? The scene with the idol being confused to was more "are you fucking kidding?" than sad in any way.  <br>WELP</br>  <br><br> Asking Rin for advice <br>not even once</br></br></br>  I'm trying to figure out how they're going to somehow fit Yuu/Nao romance in this? The way it's looking, it's going to feel a bit awkward like with Otonashi and Tenshi  Choose your woman.  <br>Any of them but the roach</br>  <br>These two!</br>  <br>Saya of course.</br>  Saya and Shizuka.
