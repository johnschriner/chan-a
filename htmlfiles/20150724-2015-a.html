I do have quite a few &gt;tumblr catgirl pics though.<br><br>I can't actually into moonrunes. I just labeled 2hu in 2 languages because half my image pack downloads are from Japan.<br>And the non-unicode language is moonspeak because that's what it takes to play most VNs.<br><br>I don't even know why I do this shit.

Huge file size yet blurry and compression artifacts.</br>  <br>try watching the show</br>  <br>That too.</br>  <br>thats not a facebook filename retard.<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?id=38751</wbr></br></br>  <br>im sorry<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QEz<wbr>hxP-pdos</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Miracle Jump scans<br> https://www.sendspace.com/file/eyha<wbr>3a</wbr> </br>  <br>That filename proves you can't into pixiv.</br>  <br>2edgy</br>  looks handy  Is Kirie-chan autistic?  <br>Yes. But it's okay because she's a cute girl.</br>  <br>Consider suicide.</br>  <br>its the background image for pixiv accounts.</br>  Ebina is the only good reason to watch this series.  <br>Fuck off, secondary scum.</br>  What is wrong with Kirie? is it just repressed lesbianism or a deep and server autism  Would you use it as an onahole?  <br>I agree the rest of the girls are complete shit especially Kirie I wish she would just get fucked and die already also not looking forward to blue hair eternal #2's episode</br>  <br>Same shitter.</br>  So is next week gonna be Sylphy's episode?<br>Will everyone fall in love with her next?</br>  <br>Yes.<br>Then, hopefully, they'll cycle back around to the Umaru redemption chapters.</br></br>  <br>she seems like a shit character but I will give her a chance but it will be hard to top Ebina.</br>  <br>Ebina is a spineless shit. Literally the Mikuru of this show.</br>  I can't help but skip the parts with Ebina, she's too damn boring and bland.    <br> B-BUT MUH BEWBS </br>  <br> all that shit <br><br>for what purpose<br><br>also<br><br> RWBY </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Kirie ever going to thank Alex? He's been really nice to her. Or is she going to be Tsun-thorn girl forever?  <br>all the better to get cola from you anon</br>  <br>That's a fucking nice sale</br>  <br>The word you were trying to think of was "young'un"</br>  <br>so what's this with men?</br>  <br>i will remember snacks next time i go to japan<br>what's a youkai?</br></br>  <br>Fun things are fun.<br>Also RWBY is pretty mediocre but the combat scenes are good enough and the soundtrack is 11/10.</br></br>  <br>Sylph starts off as a shit but she becomes the overwhelmingly best not long after she starts hanging out with UMR.</br>  <br>do you think your dick could survive?</br>  Kirie's episode was the best so far, who agree?  <br>It has the fewest annoying Umaru moments of the three</br>  Does Onii-chan wipe her butt when she's home? These are important questions.  <br> Lotus Juice gets another rap in an OP </br>    <br>now give her red m&amp;m's face</br>  Am I the only one that enjoys Umaru's tantrums?  <br>I do, but that's because I'm not the target of them.</br>  <br>get out</br>  <br>I wish he'd shut her up with a good dick in her mouth</br>  <br>I love them so much, I keep rewatching them. Her chibi form and her voice are perfect.</br>  The fact she is literally good at everything while spending every waking moment surfing the net and playing gamers outside of school confuses me.<br>This clishey is actually kinda annoying.</br>  <br>Never underestimate the magic ticket to life known as Talent.</br>  <br>pmt</br>  <br>At the same time you can also agree that Umaru herself became a lot better by the time she started hanging out with Sylph too.</br>  <br>Talent is a made up concept.<br>At best you can have slightly better genetics than someone else and be physically better by a small %.<br>But everything else comes from hard work and dedication.<br>And no mater how talented you are you cant be best at literally everything if you spend 99% of your free time just playing games and doing nothing.</br></br></br></br>  Ebina is the cutest, That banging body.<br>Sexy as fuck dialect.<br><br>Give it to me.</br></br></br>  <br>And as always Lelouch has the worst taste.</br>  Same reason you would have a guinea pig/hamster  <br>talent &lt; effort &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; talent+effort</br>  1) Ebina<br>2) Umaru<br>3) Blue haired sparkle bitch<br>90000000000000000000001) Le autism meme girl</br></br></br>  Do you think Umaru posts on imageboards?<br> &gt;Be at home <br> &gt;Onii-chan gets home <br> &gt;Ask him for Last Fantasy 15 <br> &gt;He says no <br> Why is he so evil?! Do other little sisters have onii-chans like this? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only your last line is true. Talent is very real, especially with things like academics. If you are born with a better intellect and memory, you will naturally do better in school than those who are less talented, even if you don't spend much time studying at all.</br></br>  <br>She seems like she for sure posts with a trip</br>  <br> &gt;This one girl keeps making weird faces at me <br> &gt;I think she is gay for me and wants to fuck me <br> &gt;What do? </br></br></br>  <br> talent isn't real <br><br>lmao buttmad ""nurture"" beta cuck detected<br>Why don't you get back to spend every waking minute of your life practicing shit that everyone else can do perfectly naturally</br></br></br></br>  I just read all chapters available and holy shit, I can't believe this thing has an actual plot going on.<br> Ebina's   brother leaving his home when Ebina was 7. <br> Umaru's development and realization that she's lying to her only true friends and her onii-chan is way too goddamn nice to everyone <br> Everything about Alex <br> Hikari <br> Why does Umaru live with Taihei? <br> Why the mother flashbacks? Is she kill? <br>So many questions for a 8-pages comedy manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correct.<br><br>It makes a mockery of her clothing, if she wears any on that day.</br></br></br>    <br>I do, a lot. Her voice is just too perfect.<br> GEEMU GEEMU GEEMU GEEMU <br><br>And the noises she makes when she's shocked (when she sees Erina at the super) or mad (the one she makes before throwing a tantrum at the restaurant). Also, it's always nice to hear "Umaruu-n!" in the background.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gross.</br>  <br>You're gross.</br>    <br>Anon...</br>    <br> tfw you'll never get a cute shy waifu from Akita with big tits and a cute accent. <br>Feels REAL BAD man..</br></br>  <br>Talent is exceedingly real. I can pick up video games I know nothing about and ruin everyone I know 9 out of 10 times. It doesn't matter what genre it is, but if they practice for a few weeks and I don't it'll get more even. That can be applied to virtually anyone at anything. Some people can just slam the shit out of a baseball without even knowing what the fuck is going on. I knew a guy in the military who never played basketball in his life but could do lay ups consistently.</br>  <br>This is why she's worst girl.<br>Disgusting pigslut.</br></br>    <br>Less Umaru being a fucking bitch is always better, so yeah.</br>  <br> those funbags <br>I want to slash them off with a samurai sword and then make fun of her accent.</br></br>  <br> Ebina's accent <br>Too perfect.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch, why you have such a  magnificent  taste?</br>    <br> itt - lies we tell ourselves </br>  I want to  sexualize  ebina  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128492138 <br>wrong image</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128492138 <br>Would you still like her if she had small tits?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128492138 <br> inverted nipples <br><br>This never gets less weird.</br></br></br>  How often do you think Ebina  masturbates in the shower or with the cat pillow?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128492138 <br>l-lewd</br>  <br>Yeah, though she wouldn't be as soft.</br>  Gap moe.

Ebina and his boss have huge crushes on him (and he thinks the boss is creepy) but that's it. It's more about family love and friendship.<br><br>The author seems to really like hinitng at the two of them getting together but Umaru and Taihei are both vacuums of asexuality so who knows.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128492650 <br>Not even close.</br>  <br> dumb, personality-less moeblob #10432543 is the only reason to watch this series <br><br>i bet you like Onodera too, fucking pleb</br></br></br>  I find it really funny that huge tits can actually make up for the lack of everything.

Ryuuko is perfect  This one.  <br>I prefer Ryuuko but I'd gladly take them both.</br>  <br>Ryuko seems like a fuckbuddy while her sister would be one of those girlfriends that acts like your mother.<br><br>You get in trouble with Ryuko. You get in trouble FROM Satsuki.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd kill for Satsuki-sama.</br>  <br><br>This.

They go with whatever sounds cool. Look at their fantasy stories.</br>    <br>I remember reading something about "kiru" also meaning something related to cutting fibers and/or textiles.<br><br>Could be wrong though.</br></br></br>  Ryuuko is one of my favourite MCs. She does everything right.  Ryuko is the ultra best girl.  Ryuuko's pussy is hot like fiya. Satsuki's pussy is cold like a dead fish.  Why did they have to turn Satsuki into a 30 year old office lady?    <br>Anyone who doesn't pick glorious Satsuki-sama is objectively wrong.</br>  <br><br>the only correct answers in the entire thread</br></br>  <br> liking the most annoying character in any anime I've ever seen <br><br>Literally shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Satsuki-sama is literally perfect<br><br> Implying Ryuuko could ever dunk on her </br></br></br>  Ryuko obviously.<br> There will never be someone as cool and perfect as Ryuko </br>  <br> women <br> dunking <br>In your dreams tripfag.</br></br></br>   best girl   <br>This is the best answer.<br><br><br>There's nothing wrong with liking Satsuki, she's pretty cool. But if you dream of waking up in the morning with her heels on your chest, you might want to think about your role in relationships.<br><br><br>kiru means "cut" and "cloth" in Japanese, as well as "kill" in english. So it's a triple entendre meaning "kill the cloth" "cut the cloth" etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I bet she's fun to play vidya with.  Is Ryuuko X Senketsu a valid pairing?  <br>If by "play vidya" you mean "pass around a room of big dicked niggers", then yes.</br>  <br>No. Ryuko is not a shirtsexual.<br><br>It's not INVALID any more than any other pairings, but KlK was written without pairings so it's not debatably canon either.<br><br><br>If by "pass around" you mean "play vidya with", sure. Although I don't know why anyone's penis size would be relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The most valid.</br>  <br>If by "play vidya" you mean "horribly disfigure and dump her in an alleyway", then yes.</br>  <br> Ryuko is not a shirtsexual. <br><br>That's debatable.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't mean that, because she could literally throw a room full of hostile basketball Americans into orbit.<br><br>The whole room, all at once.</br></br></br>  <br> basketball Americans </br>  Just keeping thread alive with best girl.  <br>You're correct about KLK having no romance, but that Ryuko loves wearing Senketsu more than anything, that he's the person she loves most, that he's her one true love, that they are soulmates. That's not my opinion, that's from the show. Their relationship may not be explicitly romantic, but it is explicitly the strongest relationship. Whatever that it is, it's the entire way that Ryuko needs to not lose.</br>  <br> one true love <br><br>Please, that's not from the show. Soulmates, maybe. Best friends, definitely. But "one true" implies a lot of things that make no sense.<br><br>She also took about 30 seconds to get over his death, which I wasn't okay with, but there you have it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a bit of romance between Mako and Gama.</br>  <br>Yes, but that was added by the animation staff. It wasn't written into the original plot.</br>  <br> dump her in an alleyway <br> Not paying it forward </br></br>  <br> She also took about 30 seconds to get over his death <br> Still coming to terms with it in the OVA <br> Still having panic attacks when she thinks she sees him in the crowd months later <br><br>The show took about 30 seconds to transition from his death to the epilogue (where she has said panic attack), but that's just bad directing. Also the one true love line is from episode 17, I think.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who /hoc/ here</br>  <br> Still coming to terms with it in the OVA <br><br>But is that different from how she'd be if Mako or Satsuki had kicked it?<br><br>Having one true loves die isn't something that leaves you fully functional, if pensive, 2 weeks later.<br><br> months <br>It was one month.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, which team would Mako root for?<br> I'd say the Jets </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128458295 <br>Boku no Yuri</br>  <br>If you recall in the OVA Ryuko realizes that Senketsu's soul is with her, and she's still wearing him insider her.

Imaishi's shows almost never go for a second season.</br>  <br>I love how Ryuko becomes more of a shirt, as Senketsu becomes more human over the course of the show.</br>  <br>as much as i'd love a s2 it ended fine the way it did and i cant imagine them making another, maybe a SoL spinoff or something</br>  <br>I don't think it work out unless it's a SoL or retcons.</br>  <br>You know I've been seeing this show throughout and have yet to see Satsuki acting as siscon as people say she does, I also never saw Gamagori having a think for Mako either.</br>  <br> You know I've been seeing this show throughout and have yet to see Satsuki acting as siscon as people say she does, <br>It's mostly Yurifags saying that.</br></br>  Satsuki Kiryuin but quick question is ragyo a widow  <br><br>Episode 25 had a lot of sequel bait</br></br>  <br>It can work perhaps?</br>  <br>Jormungand also had a bunch of sequel b8 and guess what<br> We ain't getting shit m8 </br></br>   tfw laffs fan   <br>So did Panty and Stocking, didn't it?</br>  I'd be glad to commit mass murder for Nonon, preferably listening to her music while performing the "sacrifices"  <br>In PSG they more-or-less explicitly set it up and then on the OST they announced it. They still haven't said whether or not they were serious or just fucking with us.</br>  <br><br>PSG is still owned by Gainax.

The Blackhawks aren't going back to the cup after all thier roster and core got gutted so Bolts time<br><br>Satsuki strong!</br></br></br>  <br>It is. They're never in a scene by themselves and nothing Gama ever does or says to Mako is relevant to the plot or future scenes.<br><br> Totally unrelated things happening <br> "M-Mankanshoku..." <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or rather there is one scene with Gama and Mako and it's just him telling her to get on the fucking bus.</br>  <br>Neither, kirr ra kirr is worse then nayrhuetoe<br><br>also we had this same exact thread less than week ago</br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad moefag.</br>  <br> That doujin <br> thee Nonon part </br></br>  <br>Is this an actual game or not?</br>  <br>Even then it wasn't much. Nonon doesn't get enough porn.</br>  <br>I know. it's fucking criminal. That scene was 10/10 and would have been elder god tier, were it not for there being a condom.<br>But one good scene in one doujin is shit. There was that one panel of her in the doujin were Ragyo fucks Ryuuko and Satsuki that has her tied up with an implied gangbang. If that had beent he whole doujin, it would have been the fucking best.</br></br>  <br> First intrigued by her wisdom on PJ's both on the boat and allows them to run the course. <br><br> Her speech on yellow lights inspires him to move forward but take caution, possibly the inspiration to get his metal under plates back from his uncle's town. which saved his life. <br><br> specifically pushes for the suction saver test to free mako even risking his life on just the hunch that Guts can smell her. <br><br> only has problems with nudity when its mako in the latter half. <br><br> Refuses to lay a hand on Mako to retake the scissor blade which would have freed him to help fight the nudists. <br><br>  Builds the willpower to break past the absolute domination to save Mako's life while removing Nui from the platform opening up the path to fight rags. <br><br>Also all the VA work was done to very unfinished animation the VA's would have been in cahoots with the Artists to make the stutter dialog scenes, when both the director and writer in the room allowing it. I highly doubt they were against to laying hints.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Poor Gamagoori, having a crush on a  lesbian. </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> liking inhuman abominations <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People of Clothing are people too.<br><br>Please stop the bullying.</br></br></br>    <br>The same could be said about Satsuki. How many people suffered under her reign?</br>  <br>Mako's les? Well no big loss, it's not like she has cowtits. now THAT would of been a real shame to lose.</br>  <br> implying satsuki isn't a life fiber hybrid too </br>  <br>She's a human, her theme song is Imitation Gold remember?</br>    <br>Why aren't you posting more?</br>  The only correct answer  <br>Proceed</br>  <br> Ryuko with the Akira Fudo face <br>Oh man it's perfect</br></br>  <br><br><br>Christian image board.</br></br></br>  <br> Omiko-san and I were able to do things together in bed <br><br>Are they making a fort?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, at the very least he's pitching a tent.</br>  <br><br>Maybe.<br><br>I can't imagine how to kiss sharkteeth, accidentally getting your tounge bitten by her during the makeout session will be extremely painful.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're the 2nd most attractive person around, after Satsuki-sama <br>This may be the greatest compliment of all time.</br></br>    <br><br><br>I am curious. Where can I find the rest?</br></br></br>   not being a gold digger <br> 2011+4 </br>  <br>It's funny how Satsuki could have just bribed him and got him to sell out Nudist Beach.</br>  <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/689316/fa1bdf<wbr>12d1/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Thanks, Anon.</br>  <br>You're unclear on how money works, aren't you</br>  <br>Right now my skull feels like it's on fire, so I don't really care. I really should go to bed.</br>   that one doujin where nonononon shows satsuki how to seduce ryuko by devouring her pussy.   Only one correct answer.  <br>What.<br><br>Link?</br></br></br>  It depends, ryuko is the kind of girl you date but satsuki is the kind of girl you marry.<br><br>Ryuuko is the kind of girl you play vidya with, can probably drink more than you, smoke with and casually have sex with. She is a true bro. She will always have your back. The only downside is, she's hard headed and often dosnt use logic in making decisions and rather uses sheer emotion. She would make a good gf but that kind of decision making process causes problems and would be bad in a marriage.<br><br>Satsuki on the other hand is a different breed. After the series she becomes less fascist and more shy and kind. She's the kind of girl you take walks with and read with and watch romantic movies with. She's one of those girls who will be shy and maybe a little distant at first but once you really get to know her you will develop a very strong bond and trust with her. She thinks things through and uses logic instead of emotion and is a long term thinker. However the downside to this is, some of her decisions may seem al little cold and in human, but still the marriage would work out.</br></br></br></br>  I like the doujin where Ryuko gets turned on watching Barazo and Sukuyo acting romantic so she sneaks out to the roof to have whacky sex with Senketsu  but Satsuki and the devas were not-so-secretly on a nearby rooftop watching the whole thing.   if nonon walked in on satsuki fucking would she join in? Would it depend on the person?  The only Kill La Kill worthy of being a Red Wings fan.  <br><br>Fuck off xenoshit</br></br>    <br>Thanks.</br>        <br>Didn't turn out as well as I would have hoped.</br>  <br>Another one that didn't turn out as well as I would have liked.</br>  <br>You're welcome.<br>It's also a good way to train my Waifu2X.</br></br>  <br>Mako would be a fun lay. Wouldn't start a relationship with her beyond fuckbuddy. Satsuki is waifu tier.</br>  <br><br>Doubt it, looks like some fan art.</br></br>  <br>DEM SHARK TEETH!</br>  lightning gonna win next year and satsuki's gonna win the  ryukob owl   Satsuki is never going to dominate you <br> Ryuko is never going to dominate you <br> Ragyo is never going to dominate you <br> you will never breed with the Kiryuin bloodline </br></br></br>  <br>Shit taste because that means you include Shitsuki and her dyke mom and Nui and Mako.<br><br><br>Ryuko and Nonon only. Maiko, Hakodate and Rei are also in my top 5 but they're a few powerlevels below Ryuko and Nonon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol u suck m8</br>  <br> he says, whilst posting an accurate representation of Shitsuki in real life <br><br>I don't even</br></br></br>  <br>may her light shine through you and lead you away from ur shit taste my friend</br>  <br>Wait, doesn't Nonon have a really deep friendship with Satsuki?<br><br>Wouldn't hating Satsuki make Nonon hate you a bit?</br></br></br>  <br> posts like a /v/irgin <br><br>Every single time. There's simply no such thing as a Satsukifag who isn't a Beta crossie from /v/.<br><br><br>Nope. She'd fall in love with my BBC. She probably already realized that Shitsuki treats her as garbage anyway.

Exhausting and must be used sparingly.<br><br> Story ends with one final stand battle against Pontius Pilate.  <br> He successfully pins the first jojo to a cross with his stand [NINE INCH NAILS] <br> jesus dies. <br> Ticket To Ride kicks in and redirects his death to Judas three days later.  <br> JoJosus returns to kick ass and save souls. <br> Ticket to Ride becomes god mode at this point and is so strong that he loses his physical form and ascends to [HEAVEN] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yukako yamagishi would be cool</br>  <br>Well then, good news anon.</br>  <br> Dont make it god mode <br><br>You know where you fucked up right?</br></br></br>    <br>just as keikaku</br>  how long until the final bds for stardust crusaders are out<br><br>only then can we have our diamond is unbreakable preview</br></br>  <br>Well what i meant was that it shouldnt be god mode right at the start of the story, otherwise the story is pointless and boring.<br>At the end it could go full Gold Experience Requiem.<br><br>Ticket To Ride<br> Can redirect misfortune, such as moving an injury to another person, moving an illness or death to another person, or creating objects by depriving them of somewhere else. (create hundreds of bread and fish for people, but starve out another village on the other side of the world) <br> The ability is extremely exhausting and must be used sparingly. <br><br>This way in a fight, Jesus couldnt just say "lol im invincible."<br>The fights would go more like "I must hold out a little longer and then take that spear right in the gut. It will hurt like hell but i could send the injury to him afterword. I only have one shot!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming we'll have to wait until Jump Festa or something for a Part IV reveal.

I mean, is Giorno actually constantly cracking jokes in dialogue or something and us english-speakers are left out of the loop? Is he constantly cussing everyone out and rude and everyone hates him but keeps him around for some reason? <br><br>I just struggle to picture a situation in which just changing the text changes Giorno's character as much as you guys keep insisting. <br><br>And don't get me wrong, I like Giorno! I just feel like there's some overselling going on, is all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i love this shit</br>  <br>Doc has a whole album, the ones that are being posted here are probably coming from there hence the filenames.</br>  <br>Doc has a gallery of it<br>http://imgur.com/a/b2Ntd</br></br>  <br>I'm the one that posted those two, and yes they are from Doc's album</br>    Let us all praise Josuke's wonderful hair  <br>From what i understand, part of the style of part five is that all the characters had unique text fonts and styles in their speech bubbles which denoted their accents and attitudes.<br>It was the only part written like this and provided extremely subtle characterization.<br><br>From what I am told Giorno's personality is pretty much good guy DIO. He is authoritative and commanding, while also being quiet and slow to speak. Basically he is supposed to sound suave as hell. <br>This was totally lost in translation, and he comes off as flat just like everyone else. <br><br>Frankly he still sounds boring as hell to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TV-nihon, plz</br>  <br>  not didney worl in gif <br>one job, anon</br></br>  I just tealized Dio's Road Roller fail makes no sense.<br><br>No matter how you look at it, Jotaro seemingly teleported out of there, without Dio noticing. Even if Dio couldn't move he would still percieve stopped time, so it's ridiculous that jotaro could squeeze out from under that thing without Dio noticing.</br></br>  <br>because magical punch ghosts that can stop time in the first place makes sense either way, right?</br>  how  <br><br>The more you think about this stuff, the less sense it's going to make.</br></br>  <br>doesn't matter how weird the basic laws are. How time stops work and how percieving it works is clearly defined.<br><br>Then again they shouldn't have been flying like DBZ either so i guess Araki just said fuck it.<br><br><br>this one's actually possible by previously established things about Crazy Diamond, except for one main disregard of the rule.<br><br>The smaller part pulled in the bigger part, its mentioned to be the other way around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Josuke's hair <br> wonderful <br>pick one</br></br></br>  I thought speedwagon died in the 50s, not in part 2's year<br>mistranslation I guess<br><br>I was going along the lines that okuyasu was fucking dead/disintegrated but i guess RHCP was just dragging his body away</br></br></br>  Stand Name: Salty Dog<br><br>Stand Ability: [Skin Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Skin_Manipulation)<br><br>Power - C<br><br>Speed - D<br><br>Range - B<br><br>Durability - A<br><br>Precision - B<br><br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: Power to control skin of oneself or others.

I'm annoyed by the avatarposting and guys shitting on other JoJo villains to make Pucci look good and ignoring his flaws.</br>  <br> doomed to live his long life without seeing the daylight <br> wants to conquer his inability to live in sunlight <br> is viewed as complete evil villain without cause <br>no</br></br></br></br>  <br>Silver Chariot Requiem</br>  <br>he could've just bought a hat and a coat.<br>worst villain.</br></br>  Is that one slightly more hype version of Jotaro's theme that played during Dio's World anywhere?  <br>He did thought, it didn't help<br><br>Best villain</br></br></br>  <br>He's gonna need more than a full body hijab to protect him from the sun. Also, sunlight is immediately deadly instead of just melting you away.</br>  <br>I recognized every meme except for Josuke. What meme is he involved in?</br>  <br><br><br>Well Dio had to spend a couple of years only acting during the night and he didn't complain about it.<br><br>Kars is a baby.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I can't believe I'm arguing about this, but Dio had already experienced the sunlight and had a power boner. Kars already had a lot of power and was gaining even more, in an attempt to quell his sun-seeking boner.</br>  <br> implying he won't be named Jesus Joestar </br>  <br> Shit  hair.</br>  There's no such thing as a bad stand. Prove me wr-<br>oh....you can't? Oh well.</br>  <br>Your stand 『Shit post』is pretty bad</br>  <br>Define bad.</br>  <br>Kira tho</br>  <br>notorious big was pretty bad</br>  <br>Kira is the only tragic villain. He wasn't bothering anybody. He wasn't doing anything THAT bad. He was just killing some random nobodies every couple of weeks or so. He paid his taxes, and was an honest man who wanted a peaceful life.</br>  <br>Murdering is wrong Anon.</br>  <br> He wasn't doing anything THAT bad. <br> He was just killing <br> every couple of weeks or so. <br>Face it, that is pretty bad. Kira is still best villain though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kira never murdered anyone. All he did was give them justice.</br>  <br>All Funny Valentine wanted to do was improve his country.</br>  <br>why didn't he just get a version of johnny &amp; gyro that were loyal to him</br>  <br>Better yet, why didn't he try to obtain the corpse parts by any other method than the one he used. Seriously, organizing a race through all the locations of the corpse parts was stupid.</br>  <br>It was an excuse by Araki since had to do give the race some purpose instead of focusing away from it to something unrelated to it.<br><br><br>If he could find one that can defeat them, sure. But there's also a risk of menger sponge obliteration and loss of a corpse part if Johnny still had his.</br></br></br></br>  <br> guys shitting on other JoJo villains to make Pucci look good and ignoring his flaws. <br>Literally no Pucci-follower does this. The only other Villian they bring up is DIO and that's just to talk about fucking him. People are allowed to appreciate the aspect of their favorite villian they like most.</br></br>  <br> All he did was give them justice. <br>Good man, whores all need to be damned. Kira is a kindred spirit,</br></br>  holy shit did i miss Giorno coming back?  <br>Is Kira a frogposter?</br>  just finished  watching  part 3 is going on worth it?  Part 4 anime never  <br> No </br>  All he wanted was a quiet life  <br> Kira a shit. He killed Best boy Fatty! </br>  <br>Of course.<br>Stands in Part 4 and every part after is way more creative than Part 3 Stands. Part 3 is one of, if not, the shittest part. If you enjoyed it then you are bound to enjoy the following parts.</br></br>  Reminder that Wonderfest is on Sunday and among some already announced figs being revealed there's going to be a few exclusives sold there: <br><br> SAS DIO Swarovski edition  <br> SAS Kakyoin Swarovski edition  <br> SAS Jolyne  <br> SL Jonathan <br> SL Zeppeli Red Ver </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was arguing with this one follower about who the best villain is. Normally, I would say Valentine but I decided to say Dio because he's that fucking cool and this guy had the gall to shit on him and say that he's a pawn for Pucci being the best villain even though without him, Pucci wouldn't have done all those things.</br>  <br>What is this? A Josuke for ants?</br>              <br>Someone took docs edit a step further, too bad it's 1/5th of it's original size now.</br>  Autism inbound<br> I thought a cool idea for a stand would be where the user cracks his knuckles or anything else and that causes small explosions which can be stored for short amounts of time before being released, or instantaneous. I thought of a scenario where a big bad literally crushes said character without learning of the stand properly and then a huge explosion occurs due to the cracking of all of the user's bones </br>  <br> Watch the part 3 anime  <br> Jotaro is completely stoic <br> throws out a one liner here and there and only smiles once or twice <br> boring as fuck <br> gets even worse in the other parts <br><br> Read the Part 3 manga <br> Jotaro is stoic but makes a lot of expressions <br> cracks jokes and smiles a lot <br> run of the mill protag with some charm <br><br>Why did the anime and part 4-6 manga kill Jotaro's character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear to god I will kill Araki if we get anything similar to this.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  <br>That is pretty autistic<br>Sounds like an interesting Killer Queen-esque stand, sorta like how Ringo had a time ability that was used differently.</br></br>  <br>I try my best to utilize the autism</br>  <br>Count the prime numbers.</br>  <br>i don't think the anime changed any dialogue like you're implying<br>but i do wish they hadn't got rid of his and star platinum's smiles</br></br>  Post best covers  So can we expect a PROPER Duwang sub when part 4 comes out?<br><br>Also part 4 ED predictions</br></br>    <br>Is it that time where we share our autistic thoughts?<br><br>I think The World is the most menacing stand in the series. A bunch of other stands either look goofy but act strong, or look strong but say a lot of retarded shit. The World doesn't have any personality, doesn't say anything, and barely changes his expression. The other villains have good stand designs, but I still think The World is the most effective one. Araki got that design down to a T.<br><br>  The fact that they imply if it weren't for Dio's personality that it would go out of control makes it even more dangerous  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stand Name: Thrift Shop<br><br>Stand Ability: [Garbage Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Manipulation)<wbr><br><br>Power - C<br>Speed - B<br>Range - B<br>Durability - C<br>Precision - B<br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: The power to manipulate various kinds of garbage.

No /v/shit..</br>  <br>There are indeed a few game characters who request waifu pics here.<br>While it is considered to be frowned upon to request /v/ waifus on an /a/ waifu drawthread,  most drawfags don't really care. <br><br>I know I don't mind, anyway, as I like Etna and Tharja.<br>In short, you kind of shouldn't, but when they'll be drawing it anyway, it doesn't really matter.<br> Other requesters will get mad at you, though. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, kind of what I expected.<br><br>I guess I'll avoid it.</br></br></br>  <br>people do it but you shouldnt. /v/ has their own drawthreads for your /v/ characters</br>  <br>The problem, and reason I asked, is you have a much higher chance in the WWT, and the quality is normally very high.<br><br>/v/ tends to only work on lewd or silly things.<br><br>As I said though, I'll avoid it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /v/ tends to only work on lewd or silly things. <br>And gay shit. Lots of gay shit.<br>Guys wearing women's lingerie, futa girls, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ lends itself more to a drawfag community in general. I greatly appreciate you having decency though, even if every other faggot and double dipper doesnt.</br>  <br>It's /a/, there are some /v/ waifus, but /a/ ones obviously should have the priority.</br>  <br>also don't get disappointed or discouraged if you don't get any delivery on your first weekend, there's a ton of requesters and not nearly enough drawfags</br>  <br>Generally, most of the ones requested at least have some reason to be here.<br><br>Like Laharl and Etna, for instance.<br>Primarily vidya but they have enough /a/ related material that not many shit on them for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/a/ lends itself more to asskissers worshiping drawfags as they were slaves</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks for not taking it the wrong way and approaching my question calmly, I appreciate it.</br></br></br></br>  When does the thread start?  <br>7 est<br>But it may be earlier. Don't ask why</br></br>  <br>2 hours 51 minutes.</br>  <br>I always thought it was supposed to be 6AM EST<br><br>That being said,  I don't know what to request </br></br></br>  Finished coloring a bunny girl that boa did last thread, also tried to add a bit more brightness to the tamamo pic <br>http://i.imgur.com/YjQcNpX.jpg</br>  <br>I'm not requesting this weekend, lest I end up looking like a greedy faggot in front of everybody.<br><br>But good luck.</br></br></br>  <br>Miiafag?</br>  Can someone draw an jojo stand?<br><br>It's a small white monkey riding on a yellow cloud.<br><br>a motif to sun wukong.</br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder for colorblind people, Lala is exactly how she looks in the manga.<br><br>If you guys want to read ch35 with a summary made by TF use the archive (128480321)<br><br><br>Reminder:<br> Report and ignore the shitposters <br> Keep the thread clean </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to  bully  Lala.

Her attraction to Darling seems to be primarily as a sex-based dalliance to have fun with rather than an actual romantic relationship. That may change in the future, but that's what I've perceived in the manga so far. Also, Rachnera makes me detect some major slut-vibes. She really doesn't seem like the kind of woman who cares who she ties up, so don't confuse that behavior as a show of any real affection.<br><br>And Darling has  good taste  because of this, because  Cera decent girl, Rach good girl, but Miia best girl .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh hey, everyone!<br><br>Look what I have!</br></br>  <br> no legs <br> awful personality <br> slut <br>I guess people are just too picky about what they want for the mother of their children.</br></br></br></br>  Now, this is probably not going to be a common occurence, but because we got nice-ish scans today, we decided to slap something together.

So crabman drew it that way. <br><br>Some are far too weak to have Centaur-fu.</br></br></br>  <br><br>As far as I can tell, Suu seems to have the best chemistry with him, no pun intended.</br></br>      <br><br>This pretty much confirms Mero is either Danish, French or Swedish.</br></br>  <br>Also tons of  blur. </br>  <br>PROMOTIONS!</br>    <br>Why didn't she just get her boyfriend to milk them?</br>  <br>TF I'm going to find you, put you to sleep then bring you with me to Las Vegas and marry you.</br>  <br> Eye contact makes her flustered and dizzy <br><br>She's so precious<br><br> Tio still superior MON, though </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 400kgs <br>It's spread-out over an incredibly high volume.<br><br> cold-blooded meat <br>Beings that are "cold-blooded" are never really that cold.

Dressing like a slut to get peoples' attention is something I'd expect from Miia not from Rachnera.</br>  <br> I'd expect from Miia <br>Shots fired!</br></br>  <br> peoples' attention <br>one person's attention.</br></br>  <br> implying it makes any difference </br>  <br> Cerea sitting across a crate <br>Huh.</br></br>    <br><br>She hasn't done that since like the first 2 chapters.</br></br>  <br><br> Dressing like a slut to get peoples' attention is something I'd expect from Miia <br><br>Wrong.<br>Miia only cares about ONE person's attention.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably start off dressing provocatively for the OPPOSITE reason, to make people uncomfortable. Since they were generally already uncomfortable with her, being a spider.<br><br>If you'll notice, the kind of skimpy clothes she used to wear and the kind of skimpy clothes she wears now are pretty different. Now, her skimpy clothes are usually more comfortable.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> no butt shot of Papi in the cute swim suit <br>unforgivable. At least she makes some cute faces</br></br></br></br></br>   every girl got a chapter about their families <br> Suu won't get any </br>  <br>Right, let me correct it then.<br><br> Dressing like a slut to get the attention of this ONE guy she met like two days ago is something I'd expect from Miia </br></br></br>  <br>More chapters for darlingbowl contestants. Whats there to cry about?</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br><br>She doesn't need one.<br><br>Slimes likely don't posses the same psychological needs for validation from parents that regular life-forms do.</br></br></br></br>  <br> every girl got a chapter about their families <br>Rachnee and Lala haven't, and Mero's getting a whole arc, putting the main three to shame.</br></br>  <br> Rach's thighs <br>Shit, that's new. Crab never could make up his mind how he drew where her chitin and skin connected. That looks wicked though. Certainly like it more than what we have in the show.</br></br>  <br><br> Chapter where it's revealed Smith has registered herself as Suu's adoptive mother. <br> &gt;"I was just filling in the forms late at night and put my name in the wrong box, really." </br></br></br>  <br><br> Dressing like a slut to please the Man she loves and basically wants to spend her life with is something I'd expect from Miia. <br><br>Fixed for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> met <br> two days ago <br>found the animeonly fag.</br></br></br>  <br> Rachnee <br> family </br></br>  <br><br> Rachnee and Lala haven't <br><br>Lala is a supernatural being likely born out of the supernatural ether as an adult entity with no real history or childhood.<br><br>I seriously doubt that Dulahans actually live together in families or procreate biologically.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Smith and Suu doing mother/daughter stuffs <br>Crabman pls, I need this.</br></br>  <br><br>If she was going to bother doing that she wouldn't have just dumped Suu on Darling.</br></br>  <br> I seriously doubt that Dulahans actually live together in families or procreate biologically. <br><br>If they don't need sex then why they got a FUCK hole?</br></br></br>  <br>spiderfag pls</br>  <br>What if she finds a nicer guy, who gives her a more expensive blanket? I mean, for all we know it's really easy to make her love you, so she could have tons of potential people she wants to spend the rest of her life with.</br>  <br>I guess that's better than her eating her mom.</br>  <br>I don't have a problem with the swimsuit, I think it fits her, but I'm honestly not a fan of a lot of her normal clothes. The stuff she wears isn't way beyond what's even remotely acceptable in public. Everyone else dresses pretty normally, if a bit weird in Mero's case, or a bit skimpily in Papi's or Miia's, but Rach constantly wears these things that look like something out of a super hero comic. She looks far sexier when she's just wearing say, a loosely buttoned dress shirt, or something a bit more reasonable.</br>  <br><br>Crabman giveth and the Crabman taketh away.<br><br>We will never get Smith/Suu Shenanigans just as we will never get Bike Cop and Wolf-Girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> What if she finds a nicer guy, who gives her a more expensive blanket? <br><br>You really think that's the ONLY reason she likes Darling?<br>That exchange was a symptom of the real reason, not the reason itself, that Miia loves Darling.</br></br></br></br></br>  Do Laminas even have cloacas? Having a cloaca implies there are male Laminas and there aren't. Laminas need Human males to mate, so this must mean that they have human vaginas.  <br>How much time do you think it passed between the first chapter and the chapter she wears the skimpy bikini to impress Darling?</br>      <br><br>You sure she's doing it for attention?<br><br>Maybe she just likes how she looks in that kind of outfit, and her negative past experiences with humans has led her to not really care if people think it looks indecent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the real reason then?</br>  <br>depends on the writer<br>crabman has vaginas <br>there are others w/ cloaca, like that one doujin I dont feel like looking up<br><br><br>moe trash</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her weird lace-fringed top she wore more in the earlier is the one that bugs me.<br>It's really weird-looking and it screams "HEY! HEY! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!" about the person that wears it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We have only had one Full Moon chapter, which implies everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 35 has occurred in less than 28 days.<br><br><br><br>I want to fuck that fish!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her vagina is at the very bottom of the front of her human part, where she wears her panties. Darling accidentally fingers her there in the shedding chapter if I remember right.</br>  <br> We have only had one Full Moon chapter, which implies everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 35 has occurred in less than 28 days <br>Correct. And from Miia's arrival to the first chapter it was less than a week.</br></br>  <br>Rachnee kinda did.</br>   tfw no delinquent sharkgirl   <br><br>Maybe she needs her chest exposed so she can breath through her spiracles.</br></br>  <br><br>The same reason Harpies have belly-buttons despite being born from eggs.<br><br>Because Monstergirls. That's a good enough explanation.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are schoolgirl outfits so adorable?<br><br>Zuki lookin' good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, it doesn't give that much insight to Arachne culture like the other ones, even this current arc with Mero, do.</br>  <br><br>It's a meme.<br><br>Lamias have human vaginas. We've known this for forever.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Monstergirls. That's a good enough explanation. <br><br>Can this be the default answer from now on?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't whiteknight anyone else, but you're making it weird for her man,<br><br>I don't know why she puts up with us. Maybe she's fat? But that's meaningless, cute or not, our debt remains the same.<br><br>No matter who she is, she's the translator /a/ needs, if not the one it deserves. So we'll creep her out. Because she can take it. Because she's not our waifu. She's a silent cleaner. A watchful editor. A Translator-fag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you know they got a fuck hole?<br><br>For all we know Lala's flat as a barbie doll down there.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The fact that they're destined soulmates. <br><br>Seriously, have you never seen a Disney Movie?<br>Love At First Sight (TM) is a popular concept.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he never say, it. </br>  <br>b/c weird faerie bullshit maps to our world by mimicry and metaphor<br><br>they're going to be humanoid in superficial ways, even functionless superficial ways</br></br></br>  <br><br> We have only had one Full Moon chapter <br><br>We've only had one Full Moon that was SHOWN to the readers.</br></br></br></br>   Stingray tastes horrible.   <br> The fact that they're destined soulmates <br>I'm sure you could back that up with some actual evidence, right?</br></br>  <br><br>I think she's put some Vocaroo posts that are either than of female or a very good impersonator.</br></br>  <br>Steve?</br>    <br><br> I want a Huldra now. <br><br> A strong seductive super-blonde with magic powers, cow tail and hollow back sounds like something the Japanese would love. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's a supernatural being that takes a humanoid form.<br><br>Why does she have anything?<br>Why does she have legs when she could float around on the mythical ether of the universe? Why does she have human-eyes if Dulahans can supernaturally sense their surroundings rather than just relying on limited, mortal eyesight?<br><br>You could ask this about anything.<br>Supernatural beings often take human-form because it's both practical and understandable to the audience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please come back to us Steve.</br>  <br>Actually, I seem to vaguely recall her streaming with a facecam once, a long-ass time ago.

The bottom to it I don't mind, it makes sense with her character and her body having something like that, but the top is just ridiculous. <br><br>I suppose there's at least the justification that she likely makes a lot of her own clothes, and rarely ventures outside of the house, and most of the time she does leave the house she stays hidden and is a secret observer.<br><br>Shit, now that I think of it, she's really done that a lot. She probably follows Darling around outside without his knowing a ton.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> https://twitter.com/foorina/status<wbr>/623674554901135361</wbr> <br><br>No problem.

Female selkies are said to make excellent wives, but because their true home is the sea, they will often be seen gazing longingly at the ocean. If she finds her skin she will immediately return to her true home, and sometimes to her selkie husband, in the sea. Sometimes, a selkie maiden is taken as a wife by a human man and she has several children by him. In these stories, it is one of her children who discovers her sealskin (often unwitting of its significance) and she soon returns to the sea. The selkie woman usually avoids seeing her human husband again but is sometimes shown visiting her children and playing with them in the waves. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> She buys outfits whole <br><br>I would have assumed that there were many retailers for Mermaids and she wouldn't have to buy from human vendors.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Darling is known to alter the clothing of the girls for them, that would be logical</br>  <br><br> Embarrass her dom daughter with baby pictures <br><br>I like how you think anon</br></br></br></br>  <br> How do you cook yours?

A touch of salt and sugar, spritz a little citrus over it. Also, might want to parboil prior to grilling. Makes the cartilage a little easier to chew.</br>  <br>Huh.

Also yugioh figma preorders soon?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>don't name him, it's good enough he's not posting and spamming the same pictures that much these days.</br>  <br><br>Learn context dumbasses, he's talking about the pokemon character, not metaposting like you douchebags.</br></br>      <br>How dumb you can be?, do I need to put "/s" for you to understand.</br>  <br> /s <br>Go back to reddit.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Can't you just ask amiko to write "over 18 year old" on an post-it and put it on the figure box ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give me your soul.</br>  <br>Except amiko wont be selling that illya</br>  <br>What's inside the cup anon?</br>  <br>That doesn't do anything. It doesn't matter how old the artist makes them as long as the judge thinks it "look like a child" it's illegal.</br>  <br> Out of nowhere <br>Is because Bruce Lee's 75th aniversary(1940-2015), you illiterate moron</br></br>  fuck those prices and DX versions.  Received more idols today. How many more can we expect for wonfes?  <br>Who the fuck is Bruce Lee that I need to celebrate his 75th birthday?</br>  <br>Too many.</br>    <br> Maki <br>No thanks. You can keep that card.</br></br>  Anyone just consider stopping buying figures minus their waifu and just buying other merchandise? I feel like one get's to a point where they have too many figures to enjoy them all.    <br>I this going to be a figure? I want it.</br>  <br>MUST BUY<br> So that my Haruna can squeeze her to death </br></br>  <br>Fuck off retard</br>  <br>Celebrities are the easiest things to search for on Google.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure that one was a GK. I will dig up where I found it to make sure. There is still the 1/10 that megahouse will be making.</br>  <br>Think their will be a mage that's not cast off?</br>  <br>Nendo facial hair is odd</br>  <br>I really don't think so that would make no sense at all.</br>  <br>Nice, I wonder how long until we get her.</br>  Will Illya be up for preorder tomorrow?  <br>I thought GReco was shit? All I ever see is people complaining about it.</br>  <br><br>I see the STD/DX version, release date and scale, but not a price.</br></br>  <br>People with shit taste.</br>  <br>More idols than my wallet would like probably</br>  <br>Extra torso also most probably limited+exclusive, do you want to guess the price?</br>  <br>It was shit.</br>   otakumode still hasn't restocked the mushishi art book <br>Fucking cunts.</br>  Today is a good day.  So do you guys think this is all we'll be getting to see monmusu related besides maybe the Miia daki?<br>I hope we see a scale or something</br>  <br>STD is the worst abbreviation they could've used.</br>  <br>I am sure there will at least be announcements at wonfes.</br>  <br>that's why you should buy the DX one.</br>  <br>She looks terrible in that picture. Mostly because of the paint.</br>  <br><br>She's probably going to be as much as the Sorceress, meaning I'll pass. At this point I actually like that they are going full retarded jew on that line up, its saving me lots of money.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128506857 <br>Fucking ew.</br>  <br>Spider scale figure would be magnificent.</br>  <br><br>I can't see Miia, Rachnee, or Cerea getting anything more than 1/8ths, probably with really condensed poses like Miia fairly coiled up or Cerea sitting or something.</br></br>  wasn't expecting this to come out so soon  <br>The lighting is really odd. Hopefully we get better photograph soon.</br>  <br>I've always had fantasies of this being a good Miia scale<br>her tail could be the base</br></br>  <br><br>That works. And the one with Cerea has her in a sitting pose as well.</br></br>  <br>Hunter a best.</br>  <br>We saw the sculpt around four months ago. Seems like a fairly standard time schedule to me. Are you going to order through gsc for the wall scroll?</br>  <br>Couldn’t agree more, at this point I'm not sure I'm getting even Mage.</br>  <br>what a crappy WS</br>  <br>I suppose that's true, but at that time it was still unpainted as well. I probably won't order from GSC's site, would rather jew off $15</br>  <br>Figure name?</br>  <br>it's in the picture.</br>  <br>I wonder who is more disappointed in you. Me, or your parents.</br>  <br>Hunter from Bikini Warriors</br>  <br>Pre-ordered. Maybe I'll watch the show eventually but either way that expression does it for me.</br>  <br>Haven't seen the show nor have I ever buyfagged but god damn that is cute. I want it.</br>  <br>Get her.</br>  <br> it <br>get lost, normie</br></br>  <br>Superior version.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much the same here, the expression and the surprisingly cheap price is making me want it. Will wait till after Wonfest to order her though.</br></br>  <br>My bad. I guess it just happened since I haven't seen the show.</br>    <br>Remember everyone, these kind of people vote, breed, and breathe the same air that we do.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It honestly isn't. At all.</br></br></br></br>  How come no one says "Madokashit"? Is Madoka universally accepted here?  <br>I haven't seen much Madokashit being posted recently.</br>  <br>It's at least better than fate/boats/sins/most other shitty mainstream shows</br>  <br>I can't even remember what the last Madoka fig was.<br><br>Psycho yukata Madoka?</br></br></br>  <br>Maiko Mami came out last month. Sayaka and Kyouko are due out in November.<br><br>There have also been 3 Akuma Homuras in the last 6 months.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how to describe Madoka fans more than pleb, shit taste, meme, etc. Mostly just stupid. Boring. Uninteresting.<br><br>Like bugs being drawn to a light source at night. Endlessly bumping into it like a moron.</br></br></br>   http://myfigurecollection.net/item<wbr>/330951</wbr> <br><br>So it's finally happening.</br></br>  <br>Cool, I just started playing Muramasa the other day.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>330952<br><br>Alter is making more idols too. Eri swimsuit version.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Call me when they rerelease momohime</br>  <br><br>You're two years late.</br></br>  <br>I hope they re-re-release her</br>  banpresto  <br><br>Good luck, there's a better chance to see pigs flying than Alter releasing something a third time.</br></br>  Wing has some teaser images.  <br>Why are Sonico's prize figures so much more interesting than most of her scales?</br>    <br>Kisuke when? He is a faggot and I don't even like him but I need to complete my collection.</br>      <br><br>Mother of god<br><br>I can't believe it's happening, going to preorder on amiami as soon as she's available.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And so begins the WonFes hype</br>  <br>"Do I fit in yet guys, please let me know if I fit in"</br>  <br>Another Ignis scale?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I really want this wall scroll.  <br>would murder for rachnee in her hammock.</br>  <br>post a better angle</br>  <br>Does she even have a tail?</br>  <br>Because they only ever put her in fucking swimsuits for her scales</br>  <br>I hope they make this pose and not the same pose GK has. This is a lot cuter.</br>  <br>Not likely</br>  <br>Depends on HLJ's discount. Not really a fan of GSC's random charging either.</br>  I want the full art for that swimsuit Satan.  <br>Swimsuit is guaranteed seller. Anything else could bomb.</br>  <br><br>God, I'm so fucking sick of swimsuit figures.</br></br>  Skytube.    <br>Stirrups are hot.</br>    <br>I want the full art of everything, especially of fluffy Belphegor.</br>  <br>I watched the show, hated it, but still pre-ordered her. The show might be shit, but I liked her. She's miles better than the other girl.</br>  <br>she looks really cute in that picture. I should reconsider picking up her scale.</br>  <br>What's with all the pokemon merch lately</br>  <br>fuck.</br>  <br>20th anniv</br>  <br>It's not that great a game. The character designs are the best part.</br>  <br>It's a shit overhyped game, the figs are fine though</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I like it.</br></br>  Anyone else going to wonfes on sunday?<br>Any veterans have advice?<br>I'm salty i can't make it to comicon but this seems like the next best thing.</br></br>  <br>Have fun. Keep hydrated.</br>  <br>Unless you're a GK buyer, Wonfest is more of a one and done type of thing. Since everything else good is already sold out by the time you get to the front of the line.<br> <br>Figure out which line you're going to wait in before Saturday night.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck, I'll buy 3 of that.</br>  Ultra pleb here. Since AmiAmi specifies yen only, if I use an American debut card will the currency automatically translate and the transaction go through with no problems?  <br>A newfag to this whole buyfag business.<br>How much is the price difference for shit in Japan and otherwise? I know it must differ depending on many factors, but the question is how often and how much? Just thought that I can buy shit here for lower prices and send it to anons, so I came here with questions.<br><br>I know that I don't make any sense, I'm sleepy, so yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have faith in Crabman it's all we can do for now.</br>  shit.  <br> No visible pubic hair <br><br>Not interested</br></br></br>  <br>didn't you notice her tiny head?</br>  <br>I noticed that there's no pubes. <br>That's all that matters on a fig.</br></br>  <br>Which one is this? she's beautiful</br>  <br>headswap?</br>   that Jessie <br><br>Instabuy.</br></br>  <br>How can a figure have a flabby ass, but no ass at the same time?<br><br>It defies logic.</br></br></br>  <br>Usually yes.<br><br>You should also be aware of what % your card charges on foreign currency exchanges. Some banks might find a foreign transaction to be suspicious and block it. In that case you will have to get in contact with them. If for some reason it doesn't work out you can set up a pay pal account.<br><br>What are you thinking of getting?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this<br>How long do you think it will be before pre-orders run out?</br></br>  <br>Not same guy, but probably fairly fast</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>235633<br><br>That isn't an easy question to answer.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Gonna watch the show just to see if I want her or not</br>  Take it easy!  <br>This is what nightmares are made of.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  The ruv is real.  <br>You and I both, anon.</br>  <br>I give up, what would be easier to get into, Idolmaster or Love Live?<br><br>Need to finally watch an idol animu</br></br></br>  Native teasers.<br><br>I am okay with this becoming a meme.</br></br>  http://native.blog.jp/archives/3721<wbr>4641.html</wbr>  Adult boobs hot blue leaves, the illustrations will be on display booth is. Please come take a look at native booth! (∩́ω '∩)  <br>Idolmaster's anime is thousand miles better, but Love Lives are getting better figures made by better manufacturers. <br><br>Start with original Idolmaster, then suffer through Love Live for figs and then check out Cinderella Girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh god there's 2 of them thank you anon for the link</br>  <br>Fuck. I've been waiting for this one.</br>  So my shipping is being calculated... box is over 40lbs and 24" long 18" wide.... how much am i going to be raped?  <br>The only Idol show I've watched is CG. I did it for Anzu.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might need some lube.</br>  So now that the dust has settled can we all agree that Kyouko won the Sayakab owl?          <br>Bigger despair.</br>   streaming <br><br>am i doing it right /a/?</br></br>  <br>not yet. you have to first  download the stream  and then  upload it to youtube.  That should get you going,</br>  This is how you do it.  It needs more gay sex with hats on.  <br>How often do you stream, /a/?</br>  Is this show big with the incest teasing and pandering?<br><br>All of the porn I've seen is brother x sister. Hard to tell if that's got a basis in the series or if it's just siscons being siscons though.</br></br>  <br>I have seen people banned for posting myanimelist links, nonetheless, if you googled you've already found out that the numbers are a straight copy from oricon.</br>  <br>even the thread states that the numbers come from different sources and oricon numbers if available</br>  <br>They're amazon numbers only. Since when was MAL a valid source on /a/ please explain that.</br>  <br>..It's not from the thread, pay attention. We are talking about week 1 sales of vol 15 and 16 now.</br>  <br>It's translated just not edited.</br>  Well cucked, virgins.  Stop posting this stupid unfunny shoop.  <br>Well, he gets cucked by Shirou, so all is still well in the world.</br>  Would you?  <br>More like the triad of perfect daughteru, perfect wife, and intolerable sister in law that you'd totally fuck if your wife got fat or if you were just really drunk one night</br>  <br>I can't argue with that, it's flawless.</br>  <br> if your wife got fat <br> if </br></br>  <br>Yes, ill be your  sex  friend forever.</br>  This THICKNESS excites my dick. This is wife material right here. Makes good food and has that wife thickness you need to please your dick for years.  We could've prevented this  <br>No, we couldn't have.

She gets NTR'd by herself? Can she get a fucking break?  <br>Reminder that due to the virtue of existing, rather than being some pipe dream fans really, really want to happen Nagato-chan is less of a fanfic than Haruhi S3</br></blockquote>]
