[ A-1 [spoilerKae[/spoiler]delivers<br>TakeP smile status: PROTECTED</br>  So much Kaede today.  Someone remembered their promise.  post em up boys  Does anyone know if that japanese blogger that lurks here (and other sites) sometimes, posted anything about us being hype for S2 yet?  <br> Smile Protected </br>  Kaede-san...  I wanted to hate Mio like the rest, but I grew to like her.<br><br> Plus she built for sex and can be coerced easily. </br></br>  Why Mio so talented?<br>Will you buy her game?</br>  A-1 sure likes getting meta with their story set-ups.<br><br> Mio up in arms about girls getting cancelled/delayed debuts <br><br> CM1 batch news released <br> Most are puzzled as to why Kaede was one of the first chosen for a voice when there were several idols with more popularity than her at the time. <br> Koi Kaze was well received although her following was still comparatively small. <br> Years later <br> Kaede gradually grew into one of the most popular and beloved idols in CG <br> Episode is about not forgetting about where you started from </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mio is a good girl.</br>  <br>that's the face of someone that has sucked a thousand dicks</br>  <br>Go sleep, Verty.</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  Which idol would you produce?  I'm left wanting more.  <br><br>Rika, Mika, Ana, Rin, Uzuki, Chuuni, Shy slut, Uzuuki, shit, bigger shit<br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The NG show is back. Kaede thankfully got to be the extra flavor this episode, but by that she also had much more focus and characerization than the majority of the cast got, especially Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria who continue to be ignored.<br>Fucking A-1 has really done it for good this time, no hope for improving.</br></br>  <br>Anya, Mio, Mika, Rika, Ranko, Uzuki, Rin, Chieri, Anuz</br>  <br>Mandatory<br><br><br> Mio, Anya, Mika, Ranko, Rika </br></br></br></br>  Here we go again.    <br>I like you<br>Never seen another Anya/Mio top two</br></br>    <br><br> What Mishiro does on her off time </br></br>   Shining Brightly Like A Star. <br><br>Sasuga top idol!</br></br>  <br>I made that chart specially for Miho, so it applies for CG only, and is obviously shopped, but even in regular one, both of them still have their place granted in my Top10.<br><br> This one got kinda obsolete, though </br></br></br>  <br>I don;t eve know what's going on here (i got here through thumbnail on main ) - Who is on the picture ?</br>  <br>name of happy ms meme :^)<br>your welcome</br></br>    <br>Великая Княжна Анастасия Николаевна Романова<br>You're welcome</br></br>  Is there a torrent yet for the latest episode? Just got home from work.  <br>check the usual suspects</br>  <br>where the heck was she packing THOSE?<br> and by THOSE I mean her huge cannons </br></br>  miku a best  <br>repostan</br>    <br> but by that she also had much more focus and characerization than Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria who continue to be ignored. <br> continue to be ignored. <br> I'm completely okay with that. All they have to do is stand there and look cute. </br></br></br>  So what's his proposal about? Any ideas?  <br> miss monochrome </br>  <br>My Princess<br>Your welcome</br></br>   wants to focus on marketing overseas <br>Might as well burn the whole building down and kill yourself while you're at it</br>  <br> Wants to increase foreign popularity of 346 idols <br><br>If she only knew...</br></br></br>  <br><br> Wet t-shirt <br> Bubble butt <br>I like this<br><br>I like this a lot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A man of taste.</br>  <br>I want to say it'll be something akin to the Cinderella Girl election adapted into the anime but.<br>That really doesn't seem like something TakeP would think of nor want.</br></br>  Lil' Anzu butt.  Momoka next week   Kanako's snacks were hidden in the old office   <br> Nana's room <br>The chances are even bigger since it doesn't look like and of the CP girls but NG will be playing any significant roles now.</br></br>  I want P-kun's brother to join him and save the aidorus.  <br> &gt;wants to focus on marketing overseas <br><br>Just do what you are already doing. If I wanted something else I'd watch something else.<br><br><br>Next episode- Someone accidentally plays this song during dance practice and P-kun freaks out<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rye<wbr>EqTbFSv4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Patiently waiting for Momoka and Ichihara</br>   A character's trademark power song is finally performed <br> They insert talking throughout 80% of the song <br><br>I think I now get what Chihayafags felt during her Nemurihime performance.</br></br></br>  <br>God those prefab walls are awful!, I remember spamming those when I was a junior in my firm.</br>    Can we all agree that Mashiro at lest had good intentions and sorta did mostly nothing wrong?<br><br>For some reason, she just wanted to do everything fast instead of doing it slowly but surely.<br><br>I bet it's because  she got close with a certain Producer who was training in America at the time and, before they separated, promised to get their productions and idols overseas and worldwide fame. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get that feeling.<br>I'm watching a show, not a music video. You can go and listen to the full song whenever you want.</br></br>    <br>Is there actually a link between these in any way?</br>  <br>Holy fuck. What a faggot.</br>  <br>I don't think they know what pedophilia is.</br>  <br>My nigga. Old hags deserve love too.</br>  <br>The fuck? Is the interviewer Brandon Orselli from NG?</br>  <br> Can we all agree that Mashiro at lest had good intentions and sorta did mostly nothing wrong? <br>Right idea, bad execution, she obviously isn't doing it for the misfortune of the idols, but business is business.</br></br>  <br>It made what Kaede was conveying in those scenes a lot more impactful though, especially given the verse they chose to end the song on.</br>  <br>Don't think so.<br><br>P-kun always looks so stoic and stone-faced, much like our Red-Shouldered friend.</br></br></br>  Kirari a cute.  <br> it's borderline pedophilia <br>What</br></br>  <br><br>She is probably under pressure from someone else.</br></br>  <br>Who is best c@ke and why is it KWSM?</br>  <br> waiting for lolis <br> CG anime <br>You better quit now.</br></br></br>   mfw we're never getting closure on this <br>Ah well. Maybe it's better for P-san to not have his wounds reopened.</br>    Dat cute cough Aznu does.  <br>They could have at least drawn the round end of her butt, but I guess she isn't a girl with a smoking figure like Miku who they can give buttshot of.</br>  <br>This.<br>Also Nemurihime was used in a shitty episode in a shitty way.</br></br>    <br><br>Those girls who left him are probably doing JAV now<br><br>Welcome to planet iM@S</br></br></br></br>  What do her pits smell like? I hear east asians lack sweat glands there.  <br>NG Hijack was always a thing, really not surprised this happened.</br>  <br>True. Also, to be fair, she worked from goddamn New York which is all about getting shit done as fast as possible.<br><br>I'm not sure if there's a reason why she wants to do it so quickly but having worked in a busy city like that would at least ingrain some habits to you.<br><br> inb4 she's just putting up a tough front because she needed to do that to survive the world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a fraction ofa second I thought they were Utena's shadow play girls, what the fuck.</br>  <br>She is a fucking bitch. No sugarcoating it.</br>  <br>It's like episode 2 and possibly the last time they'd be together as a team. There's actually a reason for them being in the spotlight (actually having a job).</br>  produsah is such a bro  ;-;   What did this say?  <br><br>Translation:<br>I never played this game and all I know about it is from 4chan</br></br></br>  <br> it's like episode 2 <br>And 10 episodes later it will be like episode 12, and still it will be all NG while completely fucking ignoring the majority of other girls, once again.<br>Hell, Kaede already got what most CP girls won't ever.</br></br></br>  <br> dissolve Candy Island it's fucking useless </br>  <br>If they left out the Awakened Miki route in the original game, they'd just have to work around some of the Ami/Mami teasing and there wouldn't be any problems.</br>  <br> It was mostly Kaede being a great girl and BTFO'ing Mishiro <br> lel NG hijack <br><br>Is ANY SCENE where NG makes an appearance now NG a hijack? Jesus people.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't get my hopes up.</br></br>  <br>765pro too stronk.</br>  <br>It's been a while</br>  <br> Child of the President <br> Fairly Young <br> Female <br><br>Being any of those three in a high position already gives a ton of pressure to you, especially in Japanese society. <br><br>There's this sort of need to prove their worth and that they are capable of handling it so they want to do something big with immediate results.<br><br>It's pretty common thing to see in the outside world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We got Maple<br>We got Koi Kaze<br>We got her telling MishirOujo to GTFO, my fans EGAOs &gt; your shekels and prestige<br><br>BASED/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop defending a rigid bitch for fuck's sake, this is anime and I don't care about why she is the ways she is.</br>  <br>Well, that's still 10 episodes later, not the now.<br><br>Have a little faith, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh its "I-can-see-the-fucking-future-and-a<wbr>ll-my-predictions-are-totally-right<wbr>" anon.<br><br>Bout time you posted. Tell me, does Hanako get run over by a dog?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Calm your tits, son. You'll only see what you want to see and if you want to see one dimensional villians, that's all you'll ever see.</br>  <br> little faith <br>14 episodes were enough to lose the last spark, thank you very much. It's clear who A-1 doesn't fucking care about.<br><br>Be sceptic while you still can.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sheryl </br>  <br>I want to catch Anzu's cold.</br>  <br>What do you think Anzu's panties smell like?</br>  <br>Lighten up, man. Just enjoy the show, the here, and now.</br>  <br>Programme Changes<br>Review Idol appearances<br>-Candy Island- -&gt; other units (rookie appointment)<br>Baseball Dosue (baseball cute) -&gt; Biweekly replacement<br>-&gt; Next Recording end on time<br><br>seems like talk about the game show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely revolting.<br>Would suck on.</br></br>  <br>Vinegar.</br>  <br>But my favorite idols didn't do anything in 14 episodes. Hard to enjoy anything like that really, especially when NG takes the screen for the xth time again.</br>  Does anyone have an explanation of kaedes puns in this episode? Translation does a great job of destroying them  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>  <br><br>Such a QT</br></br>  <br>someone ban mio's titties<br>I can't even assess her objectively because of those assets</br></br>    <br>Well, they are the main characters. They had a legit reason for being in the ep. And that's like just for you. Some of us won't even have any of our favorite idols pop-up. That's not even counting all the P-chamas out there.<br><br>This ep distributed screen time jsut fine considering it had to appeal to Kaedefags as well as waste the first act on the Mashiro drama.</br></br></br>  <br>She looks incredibly thick in the in the ones on the left and bottom right.</br>  I want Minami to step on my dick while making this face.  <br>We got cake but no interaction with P-kun.<br><br>Still mad about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin seemed especially fascinated with Kaede this episode it looked. I have no doubts that Kaede is going to be involved in Rin drama.</br>  <br>By favorite I mean the favorite among anime cast.<br>For example Miria didn't do half the things or said half the line Kaede just did this episode in 14 episodes.<br>If you don't understand how that can kill a person's hopes, then I don't know what to say.</br></br></br>  Who else is hoping and excited for an Usamin episode next week?  <br><br>If she gets arrested</br></br>  So this means Mio's group is basically confirmed right?  <br>HELL YES</br>  This show needs more delicious Yuko.  <br> More Akane <br>FUCK YES!</br></br>    <br>I'm ready for antics.</br>  <br>I will spoon with her all night long.</br>  Man, seeing segment with the S(mile)ING bgm is a real downer, especially if you've had those kinds of experiences as well where the company you work for had been bought or taken over and there's new management.<br><br>A lot of worry about jobs and stuff.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna need more scolpolamine for next week.</br>  Back to accurate Russian subs I see.   Daisuki can't handle those barrage of puns <br><br>I don't understand them but I'm still laughing.</br></br>  <br>Does it really look like her room though?</br>  <br>Anya is so lovely</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br>Probably. The pink cutesy decoration, and also Nana has a shot when she's coming out from her apartment in the 2nd Season PV.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It bothers me that she has the same exact name as the Precure character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit, yes.</br>  <br> Mio's proposal is a school festival event. <br><br>Also,<br> Kaede giving out fans to her fans </br></br></br></br>  <br>Also one on the train. So it's easy to assume they're one after the other which could imply an ep, or at least a scene, of her daily life.</br>  How will Uzuki beat hallucinations and attempted murder?  <br>Wait a sec. Can someone check if this is Mio's room? it sorta looks like it.</br>  <br>What no. <br><br>Mio's room is covered in orange furnishings. Her windows are also clear glass panels.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder if you could molest your loli hallucination.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Oh well. for some reason that cabinet on the left spoke out to me.<br><br>Well, if anything, the rabbit is the most concrete evidence for it being Usamin's room.</br></br></br>  <br>this is my room can confirm</br>  <br>When drama shifts into higher gears, she'll be reduced just repeating ganbarimasu with a dead look in her eyes until she finally breaks</br>  <br>You have to be at least 18 to post on 4chan Usamin.</br>  <br><br>The floor has similar color<br>Dem blue pillows and pinky decoration too<br>There's also that rabbit bag<br><br> Also look at the magazine's date on the card <br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she's fucking ancient</br>  Just wondering, but none of these signatures are probably cameos or hints at them and are probably the production staff?  <br>Still waiting for that Greenday SR.</br>  <br> If you don't understand how that can kill a person's hopes, then I don't know what to say. <br>I think you're just being a drama queen, anon~<br><br>I'm a Hibikifag, but I enjoyed 2011 regardless of the lack of development for her when that episode finally came around. <br>The key is just being happy for the idols that do get attention and development.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This scene sealed Uzuki's fate for her eventual collapse. There were hints before, but nothing quite solid. However this scene all but confirms those fears.<br><br>Everybody was worried, Mio and Rin were at a loss. Even Uzuki herself didn't know what to do. When put on the spot, Uzuki had the perfect opportunity to say something profound, but what did she do? She regressed to just muttering her catchphrase. And she didn't even say it convincingly this time.<br><br>Here, it's shown that Ganbarimasu isn't Uzuki's weapon, but rather her self-defense mechanism to fall back on when she herself is worried or no longer knows what to do.<br><br>If you take away her ganbarimasu, or point out how hollow it is in front of her, she'll fucking fall apart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there's a good chance it's this. I mean, shit like elections and competitions brings out the best (and sometimes the worst) in people.<br><br>It's not a bad idea honestly. It's also in line with what Mashiro wants (someone to spearhead the production).</br></br></br>  <br>SHOOT ME IF YOU DARE SHIMAMURA</br>  <br>Get rid of everyone<br>employ only 142s</br></br>  <br><br><br>This, pretty much. My and probably a number of people's favorite idol aren't even in this anime at all, but that's no deterrent to watch. Being an idolmaster fan ahould man you enjoy spending time with all if not most of the idols. Not just your favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki Shimamura<br>An Idoru robbed of her ganbarimasu.</br></br>  <br>I feel like she's most likely to break and attempt to kill Mishiro.<br><br> Like Haruka tried to kill producer. </br></br></br>  Look at that face<br>No fucks given<br>Karen and Nao are sulking, meanwhile Nana who hasn't debuted yet is cheering people up<br>Cinderella Project be mad that they lost super luxury room in super luxury agency<br>Usamin never had any luxury to begin with<br>Renting a small dark apartment <br>Working in maid-cafe to make ends meet<br>Spending all her savings on drugs<br>Nana is poor and struggles in the battle against not only Mishiro, but also herself<br>Usamin's giving it all to maintain self-control and fighting off her delusions<br><br>We've had an episode about top-tier idol, it would be a great change of pace if the next one was about Nana's struggle to make the long awaited Meruhen Debut come true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  何これ。。。  <br>I thought that was Nao when i saw it. <br>The ML one, that is.</br></br>  <br>Is that Kyoko or ML Nao</br>  So Pinky Cute or Pink Check School?<br><br>Which is the better destiny for UDK?</br></br>  <br><br>It's a little hard to make out, but it says Kyoko Igarashi in English along the bottom of the poster</br></br>  <br>I'd steal that Kaede cardboard cutout in a heartbeat.</br>  <br> Cinderella Project be mad that they lost super luxury room in super luxury agency <br>Not really, the more rational ones were just going with it and even then, these three miracles were as if not more ganbarimasu than even Uzuki.</br></br>    Cute.  Da fuck, did they fire Plum and Mushie?   The JK hookers are sad they'll have to enjo kosai once more.   <br>That artist is wonderful</br>    <br><br>Anya looks nude.<br><br>I'm kinda getting turned on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you</br>  I liked their expressions here  God damn it, you said you'd fix this shit for this season.<br><br>Paging Jaka: HorribleSubs, aers, gg, Koda, Daiz a faggot.</br></br>    <br>Someone in staff really likes putting Anya in provocative perspectives.<br><br><br> Russian gets Russian subs <br>I don't see the problem here.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never shake hands with a cute idol.    mfw imminent blackmail doujins of TakeP being her and the management's bitch so the project would be accepted.   <br>Anya's legs are the best part of the episode.</br>   blu-lay   <br><br>Delicious ROCKU.</br></br>  <br>I shook hands with cute idols  They were 3DPD though </br>  <br>I like how Lanlan is basically a part of LL now</br>  <br><br>LL needs someone to take their sexual frustration out on when the other isn't available, and when isn't that chunni available?</br></br>  <br>Well Anya's her best friend in canon and Nino doesn't have a voice so it only makes sense she'd be with her unit most of the time.</br>  Rika sure had some kind of growth spurt over the last few months.  <br>I would like a Blu-Lay</br>  <br><br> What coming home to your harem of idols is like </br></br>  <br><br>Kanako sure lost some weight there.</br></br>      <br>Now that I think about it, how'd they swipe all the old furniture and the television, and sneak it down into the basement?<br><br>Is that part of the Nomake?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't always get turned on by Chihaya.<br>But when I do.<br>I fap.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet her smiles bring rainbows</br>  <br>They're probably just moving into their own basement confinement quarters.</br>  <br>Nigga, I got two high fives from a qt aidoru.<br><br>Postan Miria.</br></br></br>  <br>The correct reaction from Producer.</br>   Idol series with an already self insert character <br> Still feels the need to insert themselves <br>Scamco at it's finest.</br></br>  <br>They need a villain and the fans will kill them if they make one of the idols the bad guy.</br>  <br> Literally My Taste &gt; Your Taste in idols</br>  <br>I get what you mean.</br>   mfw Kaede will always be a solo idol. <br><br>The path to being a top idol is so lonesome at she got her fans on her back.</br></br>  <br> "No Scamco, YOU are the villain." </br>  <br> "I'm not one of those 765 pansies. I could break an idol in two... with my bare hands." </br>  <br><br>Happy Nao a cute</br></br>  I like to think Mayu lost her shit and racked up a body count after she heard the news so they had to evacuate people to the lower floors.  <br>i want her fluffy hair</br>  <br>It's official, 346Pro is a macrocosm for Scamco with Mishiro being Scamco given flesh. TakeP is a player who refuses to spend money and continues to work hard to train up his idols.</br>  <br> Kaede giving out fans to her fans <br>Fuck I am slow.</br></br>  <br><br>That better be the case. Swear to god man, if Koume leaves before we get a comfy dorm life episode I'm gonna lose my shit.</br></br>   That sad S(mile)ing arrange <br><br>Stay strong Dooky.</br></br>  <br>Will she break him?</br>  <br>This was heartbreaking to watch.</br>  <br>Every player breaks when they realize their Rare+ cards and those occasional event SR+ cards and bad luck will never get them as far as the others</br>  Will Nana be able to protect his smile just like Kaede did?  <br>Nana can't even protect her own smile.</br>  <br>They meet off-screen.<br><br>Both of them are from the EGAO clan.<br>They will protect the EGAOs even if they get fired.<br><br>I believe TakeP is the one who took the picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nanchara~ Nanchara~  <br>Episode when?<br>I want some full focus nanchara and Russian perfection.</br></br>  <br><br>Producer protects the smiles of the idols.<br>Kaede protects the smile of the Producer.</br></br></br>   tfw no Kaede gf   <br>Me on the left</br>  I love Mio.  <br> I have been in this position </br>  Say want you will about Mashiro, but she was dead right about Kaede being in a class above the other idols. She knows talent when she sees it.  <br>Taking VA out of the count, her canon self is really on the same class as the other high-tier CGs with a very attractive design and quirks that create a sense of gap moe.</br>    <br>She has good intentions. She just needs help.</br>  Mishiro needs to make this happen.  <br>Nah, she really is the top cake. Don't deny it.</br>  Cute.  <br>Are there any confirmed M idols in CG?</br>  <br>She's my favorite cake but my subjective sense of opinion stops me from agreeing that she's on a stage above others.</br>  So TakeP's runaway idol are going to make am appearance right before the final arc, right? They're going to attend the Cinderella's Ball and see the result of his renewed efforts, right?<br> I want it so much. </br>  <br> top cake </br>  <br>Wish they would reference more of other productions like 765.<br>I'm curious how the popularity of 346 Pro idols compared to 765 girls.Especially since MishiroD considered the idol project progress was slow.</br></br>    <br><br><br><br>Preach it!<br><br> Anime inverse Kaede is the top idol; proof she doesnt need a unit. She's a one man idol unit and can freely joined in with other unit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>wasn't the joke that she was writing takagaki on maple(kaede) leafs?</br></br>     autism   <br>Kaede's puns work on multiple levels. She's that good.</br>  <br>There's alot of puns some of them were really good too.</br>  <br>I want that "punishment".</br>  <br>She already showed up though.</br>  Which of the two prostitutes are more expensive, Rin or Anya?  <br>Pls /a/ Mika will never betray TakeP; they just got assigned with a different P but their biggest fan is TakeP.</br>  <br>Plum just can't keep her horror DVDs and other spooky paraphernalia in the office anymore.<br>Other girls used boxes for their stuff, Koume just used that instead.</br></br>  I want to drink warm tea from this every morning.  <br>If it was Mika (or Kaede) I think they would have mentioned it by now with all the times they've seen Producer.</br>  <br>Imported shit is always more expensive than the local specialty.</br>  <br>Anya is the furthest from being a prostitute.</br>  <br>Maybe after the ML anime they'll make a three-way crossover special.</br>  <br> warm tea <br>Considering Kaede, it has to be beer or some other alcoholic beverage.</br></br>   Rock   <br>Anya because she's Russian.</br>  <br> green day </br>  <br>You could actually see soemof those fans (particularly the curly haired one) in the audience and the crowd</br>  <br>Kaede truly is best girl, kind of sad they didn't include a stronger scene with the producer. Feels like they shot down all the theories of them knowing each other from before.</br>  I'm still waiting for Karen to pass out eventually.  <br>This scene did a particularly nice job of showing that dynamic.</br>  <br>It's unfortunate that none of them could be any of the canon CG idols, although there is that one CG that had a past as a failed idol but that's not really the same thing as quitting.</br>  <br>You can help make it go faster if you slip something in her drink.</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>That's a first.</br>  <br>Not really; from the looks of some scene Kaede knows TakeP pretty well. Base on her reaction from the scene on the back stage. Made me remember <br>.</br></br>  <br>I think it's Toko Hattori?</br>  Why is Miku so cute when she isn't being a fake cat?  <br>So there is hope... thanks anon. Still even if Kaede somehow manages to score some points, sadly Rin will be there to protect her claim in the P.</br>  <br>The one with the hat?</br>  <br>Hattori Toko, I think. Her thing was that she failed before as an idol.</br>  <br>If you mean this hat, then yes.</br>  <br>Autism doesn't suit her.</br>    <br>Same reason why rock is more adorable when she embraces the fact that she's actually a cute.</br>  <br>I'm just happy they didn't completely shoot it down.<br><br>Half of the fun in CG, not just the anime, is making weird and crazy headcanons anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>Scamco at their finest.</br>  <br>Wow, bad taste</br>  <br>Too bad P belongs to Mayu.</br>  So what are the chances of Mishiro will be the one creating Triad Primus and putting Rin in the forefront of her super duper speshuul snowflake unit?<br><br>It seems like the thing Scamco would do, specially because it'll let them put Rin, once again, in a special forefront place where they can keep shilling her hard.</br></br>  <br> Chieri at the top. <br>You, I like you.</br></br>  I have the feeling they're going to use at least some of this season's episodes to highlight the support characters or their gimmicks like Mayu and Kaede so far, and possibly Nana next, and then we move on to unit stuff like PP, TP, etc.  <br>Bah, don't be delusional. Didn't you see how Kaede protected his smile, she is the only one for him.</br>  <br>True true.<br><br><br>I agree 1/3 of it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>How cute will Riina be during her arc with Natsuki?</br></br>  <br>There's a good chance of it. It'll also coincide with Rin's arc of having fun and enjoying life and being an idol.<br><br>She'd start forgetting about that and think of the results.</br></br></br>  <br>The entire setup was so Rin could be shilled.<br> All projects are over and Mishiro gets all control on who gets to be with who <br> Karen and Nao just happen to have their debut cancelled <br> Rin quite obviously has been more prominent and active compared to the first cour despite already having an arc about her. <br>The entire anime was made to promote Rin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it.<br><br>They didn't even give us Project Fairy in the original iM@S.</br></br></br>  Would we resent the Rin shilling nearly as much if her voice actor had been different? As in a voice actor that could actually sing well from the start.  <br>Actually, now that the main cast of introduce, they're probably going to do just that.<br><br>They're gonna make the main cast interact with the support (new units, Natsuki with Asterisk, etc.)</br></br></br>  <br>Karen and Nao already debuted, it was their CD that was canceled.</br>  <br>People just dislike her because she takes time away from their favorite idol.</br>  <br>A-1 will never redeem themselves ever again if they do that. I like Rin but she pale in comparison to other cool idols.</br>  <br>Nah. It's the favortism that pisses most people off.<br><br>Her VA does her job pretty well and the voice matches well. I also like how her VA really is trying to gitgud at singing and knows she isn't that good.<br><br>It's just the shilling itself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So cute.<br>Also super cute: Miku getting super jealous because her little fucktoy is getting chummy with Natsuki.</br></br>  <br>I wish I was able to spout nonsense with a straight face.<br><br>There will be focus I'm sure, but saying the anime is for Rin is just stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>She should've been more of visual idols.<br>She only got over with the fans initially just because her design.</br></br>  CG covering 765 songs when?   Takagaki-san <br>No really, how do they fuck up this hard?</br>  <br>Probably. The resentment came gradually. Everybody loved Rin initially, even after the Cinderella Master came out. She just sort of stagnated over time, like eating the exact same breakfast everyday for two years.</br>  <br>Can you blame them though? I'm all for Rin's being popular, I can accept and understand that much.<br><br>But when her character actively hurts all the other possible chances all the other idols could have because Scamco does nothing but RIN RIN RIN RIN RIN it's hard to not get bitter. Too much of something, even if it something a person likes, and sooner or later they will get sick of it.</br></br></br>  So if Kaede is the support cast of Dookie/NG; who's Nana supporting?Candy Island?  <br><br>Twilight Sky better be played at least once during her arc, either the song itself or a rendition of it, or we riot.</br></br>  <br>Nana cant even support herself.</br>  <br><br>People on't like her VA?</br></br>  <br> Candy Island <br> Relevant enough to get supported by someone <br>Good joke</br></br></br>  <br>I'd honestly have said Dekoration, but thee's a good chance it'd be Mika.<br><br>It's pretty hard to say, honestly. It could just be a general ep of people coming and going through the cafe.</br></br></br>  <br>But in the anime she's not an established idol yet. She's just working as waitress in the cafe.</br>  <br>The prostitute on the right sure is washed up.</br>  <br><br>A little harsh on Nana.</br></br>  <br>Life is harsh to Nana, and she deserves it.</br>  I just want to hear TakeP sing, is that so much to ask? AkaP got his own songs in one of the cover releases, so TakeP can get one too, right?  <br>Dude stop it; I like Nana but you spouting the truth makes me sad.<br><br><br>Well If Asterisk gets Natsuki; 4 choices are left either CI, RA, LL, Deko; only reason I think CI would be a good combi with her is because of Anzu. She can learn a thing from Nana</br></br></br></br>  What's this about Nana being a complete wreck of a person? Did I miss a new epic meme or something?  <br>I want to get swept up in her misery.</br>  <br>My favorite CG song. It's just so fun and full of energy.</br>  <br>Sounds dangerous. That hag has nothing to lose.</br>  <br>Dude I dont see the problem?</br>    <br>I wonder how much she moves her hips on the couch</br>  <br>I want to share her sadness and be there for her.</br>  <br>So you want Nana to drag you down to her level of personal sadness?</br>  I hope this is a recurring character and everytime he shows up he is always running in exhausted like this.  <br>And it was really good. One of my favorite ones.<br><br>Guy would need a bit more training though.</br></br></br>  <br>If the favoritism is that strong then it's obvious it's to shill Rin</br>  <br><br>I was surprised at how nice of a song it was when I first heard it. Easily one of my favorites. Too bad we'll probably never see it animated.</br></br>  <br>Dude; you got some weird ass taste. The only one that can save Nana is herself. She should just go back home.</br>  <br><br>Not every woman is a prostitute, Anon...</br></br>  <br> Nana died on the way back to her home planet. </br>  <br>Yes<br><br><br>I will go to her home planet with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well she is 3D, of course not. As a 2D guy I notice way too many flaws with real women, personally I wouldn't be interested if I met any of the iM@S VAs IRL.</br></br>  Kai deh<br>Kaydee<br>Kay deh<br>Ké dé</br></br></br>  <br>Her VA is great, Rin isn't</br>  <br> What's this about Nana being a complete wreck of a person? Did I miss a new epic meme or something? <br>I'm not even sure where to begin to point you towards, considering pretty much any of the official material involving Nana implies that she absolutely cannot direct her own life for peanuts.</br></br>  <br><br>Her VA listens to anime OSTs while cooking if I recall.</br></br>  <br>You can't be more of a prostitute if you were never a prostitute in the first place<br>Anya a purest</br></br>  <br>Fukuhara is a loveable nerd, she listens to anime OSTs and even cooks anime food, she tries hard to be the kind of voice Scamco is setting for Rin and I like her a lot because of it, it's just too bad I can never bring myself to like Rin.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>He says "Takagaki-kun".<br>The subs say "Takagaki-san".<br>I don't understand how you can screw something like that up.</br></br></br>  Best S;G right here.  <br>But it's a guy!</br>  <br>kurisu? Damn right!</br>  <br>There's literally no competition though.</br>  This month has been a month of near-non-stop announcements of things I've wanted for ages.

It's just past 1am here, but Steiner usually seems to be most active from 1am to 3am British time anyway.</br></br></br></br>    <br>And it's only your inner cuteness that counts!

(using the phrasing Taku uses)</br>  <br>Got Chaos;Child, yeah. I won't have the Singularity Single until tomorrow afternoon though, if the Japs still haven't ripped it by then I'll upload it myself. The lyrics got revealed last night so I translated the song already, too.<br><br>As for your question, it's a little hard to think about. I'll probably have to get back to you.<br><br><br><br>MrDrSr is still dealing with some real life shit and that's getting in the way of Beta. I'm happy to announce that I will be bringing the updated Drama CD Alpha out soon with another experienced video make unaffiliated with WhyNot. Also he has the Okabe character icons I needed so that's good news.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okabe being a big guy confirmed.</br>  <br>Always good to you see you, bro.</br>  <br>At least you got suzuha right<br>Suzuha&gt;Kurisu&gt;Mayuri&gt;LRuka&gt;Moeka&gt;Fa<wbr>ris</wbr></br></br>  <br>Boku wo miruna!<br>僕を見るな！<br>I think.</br></br></br>  http://tehurn.com/tuturu<br><br>http://tuturu.ga/</br></br>  <br>What  said.</br>  <br><br>Boku wo miruna.</br></br>  <br>I think I heard Rimibros?</br>  <br>Love Chuchu when, my dear brother?</br>  <br>Still hoping that announcement is for dual. <br><br>A small faint hope.</br></br></br>  <br>Steiner said in the last thread, that it is extremely difficult for them to convince PQube or something along those lines.</br>  <br>Neat to see some drama CD stuff. Got anything else in the pipeline,  apart from Cert Dead that is. </br>  <br>Raid on PQube offices to gives some execs busted kneepcaps if we don't get ChuChu when?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128453217 <br>I'm not really directly involved with the animation stuff, but it involves a lot of precise timing and such, especially if you want to incorporate changing of expressions. It definitely takes a lot of time and effort to work on the video.<br>Same with the translation, though. They very rarely release actual scripts for Drama CDs so everything has to be transcribed by ear and then translated. It often takes 3-to-5x the length of the CD itself, so an hour-long one like Alpha, Beta or Gamma can take maybe 4 hours of patience and listening for possible errors.<br><br>Overall it's a long process for all involved parties, but the result is worth it.<br><br><br>Yeah I'm gonna see about the Octet manga soon. I'm desperately hoping that Pandora hasn't been dropped in favor of Zero, I reload the page every day hoping to see chapter 11. It's still not here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So if I stayed in the world where Ruka was a girl, just how screwed would the world be?  <br>I might consider flying to Britain for that, Hamburg airport is close to where I live after all.<br>I hope we don't have to do this, Kevin-kun</br></br>  <br>Ocet would be pretty cool, one of the few things with MCs interacting right? It'd suck if pandora get's axed, the epigraph related stuff sounded a lot like the best things to come out of S;G, and I really dig the manga's art style.</br>  <br>It's a deal then.<br>We'll do it in Rimi-masks.<br><br> I'm actually going to Germany in a month, got a any recommendations for Berlin? </br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm desperately hoping that Pandora hasn't been dropped in favor of Zero <br>Give up Steiner, Pandora's probably dead.<br> You might as well try to translate the LN if that happens. </br></br></br>  <br>   got a any recommendations for Berlin? <br> Yeah, avoid it like the plague. It's immigration/refugee central. <br><br> Rimi-masks <br><br>You mean Rikishi-Seals, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You mean Rikishi-Seals, right? <br><br>That works too.<br><br>   Yeah, avoid it like the plague. It's immigration/refugee central. <br>   Well, fuck me then. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a route for that!<br> it's pretty bad </br></br>  <br>I actually translated an extract of the LN and sent it to several publishing companies. I only got one reply and it was just "Sorry we wait for Japanese publishers to come to us with books, we don't take suggestions."<br>Hell, I was even considering contacting the Japanese publisher just to find out if I could get a quote about licensing costs and see about getting something crowdfunded or something, but that fell through when I discovered that 5pb./Mages. itself is the Japanese publisher, and there's no way in hell I'd be able to contact them even if I have gotten Chiyomaru to notice me a few times.</br></br>  <br> Come to Northern Germany, experience the beautiful landscape. Cities are the same everywhere you go. <br><br><br>Why won't Senpai notice you?<br>Does he dislike you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, thanks for being so dedicated to the series. It's pretty damn impressive, and makes me wonder where the western side of the series would fair without you. How did the Ciyo noticing experiences go?</br>  <br>He thinks Steiner is a lolicon.<br><br> Jokingly though, but it's just hard to get senpai to notice you. </br></br></br>  <br>Just chatted to him a few times in his livestreams. He called me a lolicon.</br>  <br>   Come to Northern Germany, experience the beautiful landscape. Cities are the same everywhere you go. <br> We're planning on seeing some battlefields around Berlin, otherwise I might take you up on that. <br><br><br>I missed that stream, why exactly did he call you that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are you called a lolicon?<br><br>I need some details for that.</br></br></br></br>  Otakon is just a few days away, we'll have to wait and see...<br><br> And for a certain someone in this thread, I just haven't been on Skype lately. Taking a small break from the Internet right now is all. </br></br>  <br>Why are 5pb./Mages so much harder to approach than any other Japanese company?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128454009 <br><br><br>It was a while ago so my memory's not so fresh but the gist of it was that we were just chilling out and then he started talking about perverted stuff and I typed out "HENTAI" in the chat and then he went... "Ah, ah... Distant... Distant Valhalla... ah, Reading Steiner..." then he proceeded to call me a huge perverted lolicon for no real reason.</br></br></br>  <br>But at least he remembered you, that's something.</br>  <br>He knows Mayuri is you're waifu, Mayuri has the intellectual capacity of a child, therefore you're attracted to children.<br><br>Chiyomaru really just said what we are all thinking.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't suppose you know what/where are the fonts for sciadv related things?</br></br>  <br>But Mayuri isn't a loli.</br>  <br>I'm not quite familiar with whole LN translation shenanigans, but why don't you translate it and post at the site as usual?<br>Copyright issue?</br></br>  <br>Do you propose that you know more about SciADV than Chiyomaru?</br>  <br> talks about perverted stuff <br> someone call out on your act <br> proceed to call said person a lolicon <br>The fuck Chiyo?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I could do that, but right now I simply don't have the spare time to invest in something like that as a side project. The LNs are really long and a lot of effort to do, and really I'd love to do them in an official capacity. Nothing would make me happier than seeing the side material over here and available to the broad audience so they can see it doesn't just end with the anime or whatever secondary thing they stopped at.<br><br>My real dream is all of SciADV available in English, because a thing that really bums me out is people thinking SciADV starts and ends with Steins;Gate, there's such a great universe written with all these cool interconnecting details that so many people are missing out on either out of ignorance or simple lack of interest.<br>It might sound kinda dumb but I think that'd be really cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is short, but faris is even shorter.</br>  <br>Doesn't sound dumb at all. Of course you'd want your fave series to be accesible to more people.</br>  <br>The same thing bums me out as well, I really love the series and wish I could do more for it other than just buy the VN's from Japan.</br>  <br> It might sound kinda dumb but I think that'd be really cool. <br>No dream is ever dumb. Keep doing what you love.<br><br>I will buy all the Sci;Adv releases day 1. And I know a lot of people who will too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish for the same things as you.<br>Hopefully it will be reality some day.</br></br>  <br>Think you'll do a TL for the Miu drama CD similar to what you're about to do for alpha?</br>  <br>Sure but with less production values.</br>  It's already the 23rd, is it end of the month yet?<br>Where is the anime date for C;C?<br>Where is Dual?<br>Where has our blue sky gone to?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ruka was nothing but dead weight. Even Farris had more influence on the story.</br></br>  I'll ask this here. Can someone give me a working link to the Chaos Head VN? All the torrents I find are dead as fuck.  <br> Wait for PQube announcement and get it for Vita </br>  <br>Spoil me Steiner, do we get some of this in LN?</br>  <br>Yes, a bit.</br>  <br>Faris actually becomes pretty relevant since she helps resolve kurisu's daddy issues. But ruka remains irrelevant throughout the entire series.</br>  <br>You are correct. It is impossible to choose between these two.</br>  <br>When might this possibly happen? I guess I can wait if there is nothing else to be done.</br>  <br>Something will be announced at the end of July, probably at Otakon. We all here hope it's Chaos;Head NoaH.</br>  <br>It'll most prolly be announced at the end of the month.<br><br>But if you really can't wait, you can get ther glitchy-as-fuck unfinished fanpatched version for PC here:<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=2<wbr>73050</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I'm hoping for Dual.</br>  I love you guys, you are the only reason I come to /a/ these days.  <br> Personally, I'm hoping for Dual. <br>I think we all are</br></br>  <br>Hope is the last thing that leaves man.</br>  <br>Y-You too.</br>     tongue <br><br>L-lewd.</br></br>  What can we expect from S;G Zero ?  <br>Shitposting.<br>And answers about the Beta attractor field.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully more explanations about how Reading Steiner works</br>  <br>Pill-popping Okabe.

The Plot sounded more interesting then the new game/season.  I love Kurisu!  Got the CD. Ripping soon (unless the Japs already ripped it while I slept).  <br>For a small part of the series, sure she was</br>  <br>Yes!<br>Also will you show us how's the home theme?</br></br>  Looks like some guy is trying to rip stuff from C;C<br>https://twitter.com/TheVGResource/s<wbr>tatus/624226578596265984</wbr></br>  <br>Does he means sprites, animation and stuff?<br>Not idea for what purpose</br></br>  Alright, here it is.<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!FN9yVbzY!7fkuP<wbr>t4ePat_jzcARoCKcnje_OOuaDCGu3BDW1Z2<wbr>vn8<br><br><br>I would but my Vita's pretty busted right now.

I like True Qualia so much better than Singularity.  <br>It's unrelated to SciADV though. It's the OP to an otome game made by a small company. Nice song though.<br><br><br>Not even native speakers know. It's just a fucked up Engrish mistranslation of "delusion".</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"Noids" isn't really an actual English word. The closest thing I can think of would be slang from the word paranoid or paranoia.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128483043 <br><br>An excellent character and a big guy.</br></br>  <br>They fucked up the 2nd part.<br>Still nice though</br></br>    <br><br>Will non-Nips ever find out what it is without C;C translations?</br></br>   Is Steiner still here? I wanted to ask him something   <br>Yeah what's up.</br>  <br>Yeah, with spoilers being posted periodically it's sure to come out eventually.<br>Otherwise, just wait for the translations. Shouldn't be too long.</br></br>  <br>Do you still need redrawers for the Octet manga? I've been working on Chapter 2 today, practically halfway through the chapter. Moeka's part is going to be a pain in the ass.</br>  <br>Yeah! That looks good.<br>E-mail me or add me on skype or steam or whatever if you continue with it, that'd be a great help.</br></br>  <br><br>Console only, right?</br></br>  <br>Only time will tell. <br>Just keep up with the threads.</br></br>  <br>I'll send you an email when I finish the chapter. I'm only touching the pages that actually need serious redrawing by the way.</br>  <br>Fine by me, I can likely work around the ones that aren't a serious problem.</br>  Not sure why the songs in Steiner's rip were registered as being from several different albums, but damn has it lead me to some great music.  <br>They weren't tagged at all for me.</br>    Started the game today after getting the LE a few days ago. Damn I missed S;G so damn much and goddammit this game look gorgeous on the screen.<br>Also, Moeka's VN design is incredible. Her colors are really shiny.</br>  <br>Big tats I see. Her route in the spinoff was really sweet. <br>Just like the ending theme</br></br>  <br>Her Phenogram route was the best. I wish it could've been canon.</br>  <br>I meant the Darling route, but yeah even the phenogram one was pretty tragic.<br>What wordline was at end I don't know.</br></br>  Im potentially going to be ripped to fucking shreds here, but I have an honest question. Having just finished the anime (which is fucking amazing), is it a good idea to play the VN even after watching the show? Everyone says you should do it the other way round, but the VN sounds like it has so much more depth and I was wondering if it was a good idea to get into it even after watching the anime. Thoughts?  <br>I watched the anime beforehand, and read the Novel afterwards.<br><br>You can do it, it's not as bad as people claim.<br>The only thing you should keep in mind however is, that you ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT WATCH Chaos;Head.<br><br>You have to read that one, seriously.<br><br>You can read Steins;Gate without having read Chaos;Head, but it is not recommended.<br><br>I'd say, you should wait until C;H Noah is released, read that one and then read Steins;Gate.<br><br>Doing this you might forget a few things of Steins;Gate and enjoy the Novel to its fullest.<br>Rediscovering things from the anime, noticing the differences and getting into the characters is fun.<br><br><br>DO NOT WATCH CHAOS;HEAD.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeap. The VN has more information and other girl routes as well. Well worth your time.</br>  <br>That depends on if you want to get into the whole series. Most of us would highly recommend the visual novel afterwards. In fact, just do it.<br>It adds a lot more character development and gives you insight to Okabe's thoughts.<br>Stay the FUCK away from Chaos;Head anime, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons, appreciate the advice. Sounds like the VN is definately a good idea, can you emulate it? I dont mind buying it but emulating it would be easier.</br></br></br>  <br>Just get the PC version. No emulation necessary.<br>Any more than that would be spoonfeeding.<br>It's worth the work.</br></br></br>  <br>Steins;Gate is out on PC as well. You can pirate but consider supporting the series for more translations.</br>  <br><br>fuck, im being a tard, had no idea there even was a PC version. So whats so god fucking awful about Chaos;Head then?</br></br>  <br>Nothing, it's great. There is no anime though.</br>  <br>The anime.<br>The original vn has a few bugs on the translated version for pc</br></br>  <br>The anime was a sin. Apparently the VN is great, but I'm waiting for the official translation. Any day now.</br>  <br>For one, it leaves a lot of shit unexplained. It cuts out so many essential points that you have no idea what's happening. You know the end before you know the story. A pretty shitty adaptation.<br>The visual novel is pretty alright, but has a lot of shitty points about it as well, such as translations. Not bad, but wait for NoaH.<br>tl;dr Wait for C;H NoaH, then play S;G. If you're impatient, just get C;H now.</br></br></br>  <br>You and me, anon. It will be day 1 for me.<br>I really hope for a good LE.</br></br>  <br>Man, if the LE is shit/non resistant then I'll be salty as fuck</br>  <br><br><br>What if it's Robotics;Notes instead? Steiner said there's a chance it could end up not being Noah.</br></br></br>  <br>If it's Robotics;Notes I'll cry tears of joy</br>  <br>Well, for what I got Steiner was working on NoaH and in contact with PQube so it's NoaH. Also, I remember one of the PQube guys posting C;H quotes on his Twitter.<br>We will see at Otakon (I hope). That's actually from tomorrow to Sunday.</br></br>  <br>Right but Steiner posted like two days ago suggesting it could be something else depending on the company.<br>It makes sense, they aren't fans they're a company so they'd probably want to go for a safer bet which is a newer game.</br></br>  <br>If you follow the idea of popularity, then the game announced will either be:<br> S;G Darling <br> S;G 0 worldwide release </br></br></br>  <br>I would be satisfied with the second one. Darling isn't really my scene. But at the same time it would shove it in Zakobot's face, so that'd be satisfying.</br>  <br>Mah nigga.<br> Wish future SciADV VNs will have upbeat song like it for ED. </br></br>  <br><br>The majority of SciAdv fans would say you are missing out on part of the experience if you exclude the VN. The added depth is great for people who want to get their fill of S;G. Even having watched the anime first, it was still an incredibly poignant experience for me. Of course, that will depend on how invested you are in the series to begin with.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>It's a good adaptation but fucked up certain parts majorly (looking at you chapter 9) and it falls flat compared to the VN.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br><br>An acceptable adaptation, better than the other ones, which given the competition isn't necessarily saying much. Primary complaints are chapter 9 centered.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>Masterful in some aspects and a great series on its own, but a different and in some ways inferior experience to the VN, nothing it states should be taken as canon for sciADV overall.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br> I like the second half of the anime more than it's VN counterpart, except for chapter 9 obviously. </br>  <br><br><br><br>haven´t read S;G yet, do you mean chapter 9 of anime or VN?</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>It was really well executed. S;G definitely benefitted from a good anime adaptation.</br>  <br>Chapter 9 of the VN, eps 20 and 21 of the anime.</br>  <br> anime <br> chapter <br>Anon please</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497418 <br>I like it even better than the VN</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128497967 <br>Yeah, the anime butchered his backstory and character motivations. In the VN he's much more tragic and thus likeable even after the reveal.</br>  <br>To be fair, the PS Vita release of Chaos;Head came out less than a year ago, so it's hardly irrelevant. Also, I think Steiner is trying his hardest to keep doubt in the air. He wouldn't want to steal PQube's thunder, after all.</br>  <br>M-maybe they will reveal it on Kurisu's birthday?<br>I mean, it IS the end of July now, isn't it?</br></br>  <br> they reveal it on the day Kurisu die instead </br>  <br> fucking Kevin delays the announcement to the end of next month </br>  <br>Anon, that's another month away... I can't bare to wait that long...</br>  <br>What. July 28th is in four days.</br>  <br><br>You should reread the VN.<br><br><br>I'd be fine with this, just announce the goddamn thing already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...Oh shit, I had my timeline mixed up. I thought she died at the end of August... but she dies in July, then the rest of the game takes place in August. I get it now. Nevermind.</br>  I started S;G today. Which route should I play first?  <br>Whichever one you land on,  Vitagen  anon</br>  <br>They're in order, cutting the story short at different points, so it's easy to do them in sequence.</br>  <br>Suzuha -&gt; Faris -&gt; Luka -&gt; Mayuri -&gt; Kurisu -&gt; True</br>  <br>Fun things.</br>  As an anon who watched Steins;Gate, played the VN a year later and just finished it all up with the OVA where should I go from here? Movie? Are there any other VNs I should play? Really enjoyed the Steins;Gate VN, it was my first VN and I have only been thinking about it since I finished it a few days ago.  <br>VNs in general or Sciadv? If it's the former, Muv Luv is the best you're going to get. Go into it blind, don't look anything up, just download and play.</br>  <br>Whose eyes are those eyes?</br>  <br>Sciadv, but thank you for the other recommendation. I'll download that too.</br>  <br>Black and white is better than nothing, but I really would like to have a colored one.</br>  <br>Start Chaos;Head I guess? Or you can wait a few days to see if the announcement really is for a C;H Noah or Dual.</br>  <br>WMP has a setting where it will automatically try to detect the album untagged stuff comes from. That's why I have the Catherine soundtrack labeled as Legendary Weapons by Wu Tang Clan</br>  <br>Oh, that makes sense. Like I'm said, I'm glad it happened. I'd never heard of those artists before, but I'm gonna start listening to them from now on.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vpd<wbr>JkXfekOo</wbr>  [ ]  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nFX<wbr>4Li4Zp-E</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>Tooryanse &gt; Kagome Kagome</br></br>  Did Arc Light of the Point of Infinity ever get scanned?  <br>It didn't.</br>  Why is there no Moeka route?<br><br>I want to lock myself in and isolate myself with my autistic waifu from the rest of society.<br><br>There was even a route for the shitty maid cafe girl, why didn't best girl get one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this, and where can I get it if I should care about it?<br><br>Because the only way to liberate Moeka from Sern is to get to the Steins;Gate, the True End.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why not make another route similar to true ending, except you end up with Moeka?</br>  <br>Because the only way to get to true is of Okabe's obsession with Kurisu.<br><br>This should be obvious, as it was even said in the Anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Then just say that he only wanted to save her, he wasn't actually in love with her. Same way he desperately wanted to save Mayuri even though he didn't love her. It is easy enough to give her a route if you really want to.</br>  <br>But Okabe does love Mayuri, as a sister.<br>He spent years with Mayuri, he fell in love with Kurisu's intellect, her wit and her weaknesses.<br><br>He hated Moeka for killing Mayuri, he can't just do a U-turn.<br>It would be too forced.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nya, soldier and fag route were forced too so this shouldn't really be an issue.</br>  <br>Suzuha was ok, but yeah, Luka was very forced.</br>  <br> What is this, and where can I get it if I should care about it? <br>Manga spin-off where Kyouma is dead, there's only Okabe Rintarou.</br></br>  <br> he fell in love with Kurisu's intellect, her wit and her weaknesses. <br><br>He actually fell in love with her dank meme skills.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure you're thinking of Pandora or Epigraph</br>  <br><br>No he's right. It's the manga based off the Beta Drama CD</br></br>  <br>To be fair, it's hard not to fall in love with them</br>  Still working on this compilation and I'm about 1/3 of the way done.

I also need descriptions for the two bottom rightmost manga as I was unable to find ones myself.</br></br>  <br>Looks really good anon.</br>  <br>I would reword the main description a bit, "2010 visual novel" is a little vague. The story is set in 2010, but the visual novel was originally released in 2009.</br>  <br>Instead of<br><br> *Steins;Gate* <br> /Zero/ <br><br>I think you should have it as *Steins;Gate0* since that's its actual name.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you should reword Octet's description so it points out it plays like a 90's text adventure game, not only looks like one.<br><br>The "Follows a similar storyline with focus on different characters" part of the TV anime description seems weird to me. I don't think the focus is different.<br><br>Replace "adaption of the" with "sequel to the" in Deja vu's description.<br><br>I think you should point out which platforms the English version of the Steins;Gate VN has come out on (PC, PS3, Vita).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Occultic;Nine spooky song:<br>暗い日曜日 - Gloomy Sunday<br>https://<span>youtu.be/55FP1LfkkVQ  [ ]</br></br> </br>  <br>If there isn't any description for an entry, you should leave it empty instead of "description required".<br> And leave out Zero from anime section, wait until we get first visual for the anime.

I've never read Duplet so I honestly have no idea.</br></br>  <br>Thats the manga adaptation of the thing where Okabe gets stuck into Daru's eroge program. I can't even remember if it was in vn or was it drama cd only.</br>  For the love of my frail heart, I beg you Kevin, publish the game that has this scene in it.  I've only gone a short ways into the Gamma CD animation. Until now I never knew those animations even existed, and I don't think my heart can take this route. I don't like where it's going.  <br>Kurisu, Faris and Suzuha get their own manga adaptation of their routes, so it can be assumed Duplet is for Mayuri.<br> Luka and Moeka didn't get any <br>My sides.<br><br><br>Oh, it's the one with Yandere Kurisu? That's from drama CD.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly Reminder that this exists: http://futuregadget-lab.us/  <br>Yes but manga has original ending.<br>No power drills unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>How does it end?</br>  <br>I ideally need descriptions of 18 words or smaller. I'll take your word for what the story is in Duplet but it's unfortunate that the descriptions for the darling route adaptions seem to just be copy pastes of each other seeing as they're simple character routes.<br><br>As a small note for anyone interested, how would you prefer I name Faris in various descriptions? As 'Faris NyanNyan' or her real name 'Rumiho Akiha'?</br></br></br>  <br>Okabe ends up dating Mayuri but she notices that his heart is not in it and he leaves to find Kurisu. <br>Just when he's confessing to Kurisu, Daru butts in and he manages to end the program.</br></br>  <br> As a small note for anyone interested, how would you prefer I name Faris in various descriptions?

Wouldn't Pandora be a good lead in to the Zero VN just with some changed elements?</br></br>  <br><br>Don't look at me. It was whoever added the 'single quotes'.</br></br>  <br>God what the fuck</br>  O;N isn't part of the sciadv world is it? Still hope it get's translated, it sounded interesting.  <br>Maybe it gets anime and manga after vn is released.</br>  <br>No, it's not part of C;H, S;G, R;N and C;C.</br>  <br>Who knows, maybe it'll be included into SciADV world  for no reason at all  sooner or later, alongside with A;C.</br>  <br>Maybe the game will supersed the novels.<br>I think is a neat concept</br></br>  The best.  <br>Wrong file you got there, buddy.</br>  <br>Looks good, but why not include the English titles for all the stuff too? It's weird that you're mixing romaji and English titles in there.<br><br>Stardust Duplet is a straight adaptation of Mayuri's Darling route.<br>Motto Hiyoku Renri is an adaptation of one of the Comptiq Drama CDs where Okabe gets trapped in an eroge simulation made by Daru.</br></br></br></br>  Wonfes this weekend, they will announce Serika figure for sure.  <br>Nope. Aki and Kai a best.</br>  <br>It's because I'm a kimota, that I didn't get a proper anime adaption, right?<br>You only hate me because I'm a creepy semi-hikki.</br></br>  <br>Maybe the gunvarrel figure will finally get sorted.</br>  <br>The 0 in Steins;Gate0 is supposed to hold weight similar to how a 2 in Steins;Gate2 would. You wouldn't separate it as Steins;Gate Two/Ni in that case, right? The Japanese use the "English" title everywhere.</br>  Someone in a previous thread said that Alpha Nakabachi and Beta Nakabachi are two very different people, since Suzuha wasn't there to influence him in alpha. Can someone explain me the difference? Because in both times he sounds like a bad father.  <br>Alpha Nakabachi was mostly a sad, distressed man who wanted to reconcile with his daughter but was too proud/didn't know how to word his feelings. Just like Kurisu he's not good at directly saying how he feels. He had a good friendship with Suzu and Yukitaka and it calmed his heart considerably.<br><br>Beta Nakabachi on the other hand had nothing and nobody to help him through the tough times when he was without his family and being laughed at by the scientific community. He slowly became warped and furious at the world, he called Kurisu to his conference specifically to gloat at her and big-up his experiences, he even got to the point of killing his own daughter in a blind rage. (Though it should be noted that he didn't know about Attractor Fields and thought he could undo her death once he made the Time Machine).</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I think I get it now. So his friendship with Suzu and Faris' dad is the one thing that helps him the most and he probably wouldn't kill his daughter in alpha.

The seiyuu industry is not a sacrosanct workplace, people are coerced into sleeping with people in power there too I'm sure, or choose to do so to advance in their field.

I noticed that a lot of the newer female seiyuus don't have a lot of range.

Get on my level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a time when it's his birthday but no one celebrate it. And in end of the day he said to his friend that today is supposed to be his birthday. And everybody don't know how to react.<br><br>It's so painful to hear that</br></br></br>  <br>Wow. When I remember Sugita or Iguchi talk about best friend this or best friend that, I now understand how much of a big thing having a best friend is, especially for a Japanese adult.</br>  No one talks about girls like Megumi Nakajima... really... why? She is beautiful, she has amazing voice and people shit on her, because she voiced Ranka in Macross Frontier.<br><br>I wish she would come back to voice acting, but at the same time I hope she is fine and I will wait for her return. Such person cannot disappeared from the Earth!</br></br>  <br>I hope you die a horrible, painful death.</br>  <br>She's not new, and she hasn't done anything (I care enough to see) since Kimi ga Iru Machi.</br>  <br>What's wrong with that?

I find having other people around is kind of a pain in the ass. Like when they feel the need to tell you about every mundane hit that happened to them that day and you're supposed to pretend that you care.</br>  <br>That's called socializing and empathy. You might have issues, bro.</br>  <br><br>I know, right? Small talk and empty words. Horrible.</br></br>    <br> You might have issues, bro. <br>Yeah, but so what? It's not like they will go away if I wish really hard.<br><br>If you expect me to bother you out of the blue every few days with some meaningless shit like then we probably won't become "friends".<br> "How was your day?" <br>Most likely the same as 99% of days, where nothing happened. Kind of get tired of repeating this every time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Ishikawa's case, he said to his friend "Hey, actually today is my birthday." at the end of the day. <br>I think that's what painful and embarassing.</br></br>  <br>Why isn't Yumi Hara married yet?</br>   Asami Imai's uterus is dried up now.  <br><br>It's so sad.</br></br>  <br>Do you want to volunteer?</br>    <br> shit at voice acting <br><br>More like you have shit taste in voices.</br></br></br>  <br>ASDF</br>  <br>Of course. Does she have a fuck ton of fans pussy blocking her or something? It's not like she has a ton of roles.</br>  <br><br> Mirai was the only one I knew from the thumbnail <br> rest I couldn't identify even from the full image <br><br>Do I have good taste in anime, or lousy memory?</br></br></br></br></br>  Marina.  No Uchiyama flirting this week, but was still pretty entertaining  why won't you join the club, /a/?  <br> your one sacred place that you thought Matsuoka would never invade has been defiled <br>I can only feel despair now.</br></br>  <br>I'm still mad that staff decided to make Matsuoka's Restaurant episode with Kayanon as DVD special</br>  <br>They sort of made a joke out of it on Madan no Radio.</br>  <br> They made fan art this quickly. <br>Wow, the Japs must really ship these two together.</br></br>  who cares about male seiyuu lol  <br><br>This. Except maybe the one voicing Kirito, him I want to dunk upside down in a barrel of  cum .</br></br>   mfw that faggot Matsuoka is gonna be the MC in the new Super Robot Wars game   <br>Really? That is sorta neat.<br>Who will be voicing the chick?</br></br>  <br>Mai Nakahara</br>  <br> including roles of anime that are ongoing <br><br>It's an arbitrary rule of mine that I wait until the anime is finished so that there are more pictures available for me to choose from and also to fully understand its impact/popularity. When a season's only 3 eps in you can't really tell if the anime (and consequently the character) is going to end up memorable or not. Though in the end it's all personal taste which characters end up in a mosaic.</br></br></br>  <br>There is something severely wrong with her facial structure.</br>  <br> that weak as shit FALBLAZE <br>It's gonna be amazingly terrible.<br>benched</br></br></br>  <br> Umehara on covers after just a couple of months working <br>Based</br></br>  <br>Miyuki Sawashiro and Haruka Tomatsu are Goddesses. They are the only reason I live</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> . She looks really cute too. <br>Anon before discovering makeup.</br></br>  <br>Glad Ari-chan is there. She's cute</br>  <br>I agree that lately they care more about looks and marketability as a personality/idol though I'm not really complaining. Personally I think seiyuu like Asami Seto, Ai Kakuma, Tomoyo Kurosawa, Ari Ozawa are all newer seiyuu with varying degrees of good range.<br><br>Seiyuu like Ayane Sakura, Maaya Uchida didn't impress me at the beginning of their career but the latter has been growing on me (she's good in Chaos Dragon, Charlotte what I've seen) and Ayane's been slightly improving over the years. HanaKana used to be bad in the beginning but she's great now (that doesn't mean I tolerate her overexposure).</br></br></br>  Is there a specific seiyuu you've been recognizing more and .more recently? For me its Hiroshi kamiya  <br>I remember the first Nico broadcast event they did for Seiken Tsukai, in which Kaito was the MC. The guest were Aoi, Taketatsu, Ogura and Uchida.<br>There was a lot of awkwardness in the air during that event. Not because there was any animosity between the cast but more due to a lack of chemistry between them, with Ogura being Ogura and Maaya Uchida having the personality of a brick.(Of course some Maaya fanboys in 2ch deconstructed this into people bullying Uchida and yada yada)<br><br>Still, despite the "bad" atmosphere Kaito really did his best at improving the mood, it left a good impression of him on a lot of of the spectators.<br>Him and Aoi pretty much carried that whole train-wreck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Ogura a bitch or something?</br>  <br>No, but she is overly fake and burikko.<br>Not a bad girl per se, but she is a huge tool of the industry.</br></br>  <br> people bullying Uchida <br>Please explain.<br><br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody bullied Uchida, she was putting zero effort in interacting with Aoi/Taketatsu/Ogura and therefore was left behind in conversations.<br>Then a few hours later you had dumb fanboys saying they bullied her.</br></br>  <br><br>It's been built with the latest medical technology, but something went horribly wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow. I expected her to be a nice girl, but I guess you can't really judge by just looks.</br></br>  <br>Is there a prove she's burikko or fake? I don't think she's that bad.</br>  <br>Shit, mean to quote  </br>  <br><br><br>I want to marry Harami and remove her cake status!</br></br></br>  <br>She did  by makes my dick goes diamond </br>  <br>Really Anon? She puts up a fake cutesy voice everytime she speaks normally. Compare her tone of voice in an interview to pretty any other modern female seiyuu.<br>All Idol seiyuu lie about a few things but Ogura's stage personality comes of as terribly forced and fake.<br><br>Again, Ogura is not a bad per se, she is just a huge tool.<br>Last I checked she was just 19 so maybe she will find a way to be more true to herself in the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Is she Yukarin level burikko or she's more terrible than Yukarin?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, petit milady and Kaito saved that show, but Ogura in that Niconama seems fine to me and Uchida is like always, not good at communicating</br>  <br>I always enjoy Aoi acting like a creeper around Ogura.</br>  <br>I know her cutesy voice is seems fake. but It doens't mean she's a bitch like this anon said . <br>or maybe her real voice isn't really far from her cutesy voice. Naganawa Maria have a bit similiar cutesy voice like Ogura. And to me, Maria's voice doesn't seem fake.</br></br>  <br>And Aoi not holding back againts tkt2. Oppai beeaaam.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_K0<wbr>oNlZDsYs</wbr>  [ ]<br>I love how Aoi makes her stand up first.</br></br>  <br>From what?</br>  I love Saorin  <br>It seemed like Uchida was preoccupied with something in her mind but couldn't do anything about it since she had an event to attend. You know, real life shit.  She could've also been on her period. </br>  <br>Dokkyun dokkyun.</br>  <br>It probably bothers her that she's the only slut there or something.</br>  <br>Idols don't have periods, silly.<br>Now that you mention it, she was a bit better/less awkward on the Seiken Tsukai radio CD.(With Aoi, Taketatsu and Chiaki Omigawa.)</br></br>  <br>Are you saying the jam isn't authentic?</br>  I wish we could get more of these two.  Why do producers hire expensive seiyuu when seiyuu are dime a dozen, and they can cut costs immensely by hiring newbies?<br><br>Newbies would work for basically nothing just for a chance to get exposure. Another benefit is that you don't get Kirito-voiced or Araragi-voiced MCs every single season.</br></br>  <br>Except that's a different persona with a different seiyuu so you can't really represent her as Uchida maaya at that point.</br>  <br>What? The seiyuu is still same.</br>  <br>Rieshon is really good at that. If you told me Nyaa-tan, Hotaru from NNB, and Nao from Wakaba Girl were voiced by different people, I'd believe you.</br>  <br>What the fuck. You're absolutely right.<br><br>I-I mean I was just pretending to be retarded. Jokes on you.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>Despite QUALITY all over the place in anime, industry standard is still a thing</br></br>  <br>You are generalizing, plenty of no Anime with a tight budget do just what you said.(It's also the reason why you see new faces so often instead of veteran seiyuu which are more expensive. A good example is Yuri Kuma Arashi, the main trio were no-names, and the big name seiyuu like Aoi or Koshimizu only voiced secondary girls that had way less screentime.)</br>  <br>Who is this spackle castle?</br>  <br><br>I could have sworn they had different seiyuus for the split personalities, I thought I even saw it in the casting on  MAL </br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget voicing Shiho and Isla, that makes her absolute shit tier by default (more so at the former)</br></br>  <br>Rainy Sky.</br>  <br>Who is this hardening agent?<br><br><br>Who is this nut-butter erupter?<br><br><br>Thanks. I just woke up and they're coming to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most newbies are not that good.<br>Believe it or not in this industry the majority of popular seiyuu deserve they popularity.</br></br>  <br>Even Hanazawa, Anon?</br>  <br>Or Minami Tsuda?</br>  <br>She's a great seiyuu. Only a bit below Hayami/Sawashiro (the bestests young seiyuu).</br>  <br> Sawashiro <br>Pure talent, not so much skill. Just has a voice like sex.</br></br>  <br>Hanazawa has good range, she can show the personality and share emotion through her voice.<br>She is a bit overrated, but almost anyone would be with the amount shows she is in per season.<br><br><br>She isn't popular, she just got lucky last year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean why don't they do that faster than the rate they usually do? Because that's exactly what they do, almost every 3-4 years we're seeing another group of late teens/early 20 year olds debuting while those that have reached cake status get cast less and less</br>  <br>No. Uchida voiced both of them. You could clearly hear Uchida's voice in Onee-san voice. She use her cool deep voice.<br>and why the hell they used different seiyuu when the character is sharing same body.</br></br>  <br> No. Uchida voiced both of them. You could clearly hear Uchida's voice in Onee-san voice. She use her cool deep voice. <br>I've never heard her use that voice, ever. Could you give me some other roles when she has?</br></br>  <br>Great range while still being recognizable.<br>She's like female Ishida.</br></br>  <br> Hanazawa has good range, she can show the personality and share emotion through her voice. </br>  most underrated with great range  <br>yet what a terrible nose</br>  <br> half-breeds </br>  <br> She isn't popular, she just got lucky last year. <br>Got lucky? How?<br>Isn't there a list of the top earning seiyuu with her ranking high up there.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant to reply <br><br>Hanazawa is great, I rated her higher after her performance in Garden of Words.<br>She's brilliant there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The most recent one she used her cool voice is Dora-tan in Etotama.</br>  <br>Any others?</br>  <br>Her Nibutani was great, and she's still my Kyoanifu until now.</br>  <br>Who is this load toad?<br><br><br>Who is this priapism mechanism?<br><br><br>Who is this gestation plantation?<br><br><br>Who is this friction addiction?<br><br><br>Who is this fornication station?<br><br><br> great range <br>Not really, no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many roles has she this year?<br>Like two to four at most.<br>She can't be earning so much.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to filter you because you're trying too hard with those names.</br>  <br>Sawashiro can easily pull do children to adult male greatly, and you can still recognize her voice.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>The emotion she showed in the movie is great, but range? it is not at all</br>  <br>I don't remember any other character when she used cool voice. May be NotHomu from Vividred, but I think it's not deep like dora-tan or that split personality. You can just check  MAL  anon.</br>  <br>Wait, she was not-homu from vividass? whut.</br>  <br>Also filtered because <br> Sawashiro doesn't have skill </br></br>  Cmon guys, if Hanazawa had a "great range" her overexposure a few years ago wouldn't have been an issue. But she couldn't cover all those roles so it ends up sounding like she gets mis-casted and the role could have gone to a better suited seiyuu. You don't see people complaining about Aoi Yuuki or Sawashiro being everywhere.<br>She has her forte, which is soft-spoken character then she can vary it a bit (smug/insane in particular she is pretty good at). Great range is a stretch.</br>  <br>There are many unnoticeable ones with good range</br>  <br><br>Range is overrated anyway.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't only do anime role. I think she did the dub for GoT as well. No idea how legit this list is.</br>  <br>Yes. Honestly, Uchida is pretty good at voice acting or maybe talented, but some anon here just called she's slut just because she's do gravure before become a popular seiyuu like now.</br>  <br>Not like some other leading seyuu. Like I said, she has a voice like sex, and she delivers her lines well, but she doesn't have the range.</br>  <br>She's a very talented semen demon.</br>  <br> she has a voice like sex <br>She sounds like a grandmum to me.</br></br>  Who should be the next guest on Tokyo Encounter?<br><br>Also, where are the fucking subs? This isn't the Red October, fuck.</br></br>  <br>Which was a big mistake.<br>She's a weird(?) type who looks good only with clothes on.</br></br>  <br>She's even doing more gravure after she got popular as seiyuu.<br>Funny how Mao started to dress like a granny after she was gaining more roles as seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>I remember someone mentioned that Aoi's manager was pushing her to become idol type seiyuu. What happened to it?</br>  <br>You are gonna need to be more specific than that.</br>  <br>Problem is her legs is short, makes her bikini photos looks weird from waist below.<br>Unlike Tomatsu, who has a great pair of legs even though her ass and chest are almost non-existent.</br></br>  <br>This season in Chaos Dragon, she voices Urobuchi's character.<br><br><br>Nana Mizuki can single-handedly carry an anime thanks to her large fanbase. Having veteran seiyuu also pays off when it comes to events.<br><br><br>The way seiyuu industry is becoming more looks-oriented I wouldn't be surprised if doing gravure becomes more regular, see Haruka Tomatsu. Releasing a photobook is a good way to gain some money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;This season in Chaos Dragon, she voices Urobuchi's character. <br>I would watch it for her but I CD seems pretty dull.<br>I only watched 1 ep though.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I haven't heard anything about her activity as an idol nowadays. She seems to degrade as fujoshit and otaku as one of Sugita's friends (which is great) instead of releasing singles/albums like Hanazawa did before</br>  <br>Hiyori was voiced by Uchida? What the fuck?</br>  You will never have a threesome with these two. Ever.  <br>No idea where can she be earning so much.<br>All that money doesn't come from her seiyuu job, that's sure.<br>I don't know how good of a singer she is, so maybe there it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you always skip anime ED?</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god, I could have fucking sworn that she wasn't. I think someone must have tampered with my memories because it seems so obvious now but I was completely oblivious.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't that ED done by supercell from what I recall?</br>  <br>Kind of. It's another singer backed by supercell's ryo.</br>  <br>It's a shame she doesn't get more roles, Alice is the only recent one I can recall.</br>  <br>Hotaru's voice is really soothing.</br>  Mine would be Irina why no Irina love she is my waifu.  <br> tfw she will never be relevant in the story <br>Damn you TNK for making god tier designs for girls who aren't important.</br></br>  <br>One thing we can all agree on is that Asia is a piece of shit.</br>  I'm surprised so little doujins have made made.  <br>There's a self-insert made by saberfish</br>  <br>We need way more doujins of xenovia, koneko, gasper and ravel ;_;</br>  Anyone here like manhwa?

It triggers me when 90% of the backgrounds are made in google sketchup  from manwha, its a slippery slop down to filthy chinese comics. Dear god, please save me.  This is now a thread about Red Storm  Cavalier of the Abyss is just about the only manwha I'm following, and I'm just in it for the trainwreck.  I read through The Friendly Winter today thanks to the guy who mentioned it last thread. I liked it quite a lot, so thanks mate. It was a good read.  <br>Mikael was best bro</br>  <br>there were plenty of discussion of manhwa before the "purist" fags popped up. Especially when this was still running </br>  <br>Why the fuck haven't you finished this?</br>  <br> you can't hit women </br>  <br>It's a multi-pandering thing.<br>You can read it for the tits if you want, but overall, it's kinda shit apart from the art. Dropped after 3 chapters.</br></br>  <br>fuck off rulesfag</br>  <br>You're wrong. Simple as that. Stop shitting up the thread</br>  <br>I just dislike they hit them in the face.<br>Anywhere, but the face.</br></br>  <br>Abide in the Wind is pretty good and The Pale Horse is absolutely spectacular.</br>  <br> there will never be a "Veritas" season 2 <br>why even live?</br></br>  <br> Anywhere, but the face. <br>PUNCH THEM IN THE BABY FACTORY</br></br>  Read breaker and breaker new waves a few weeks ago, I liked them.  <br>You tell him. We also should post comics like Batman and make threads about weapons and music.</br>  Noblesse? Anyone?  <br>isn't manwha just the way that koreans pronounce manga.</br>  <br>Got bored when the albino twins came into the scene. Maybe I should pick it up again.</br>  Hellper is my current favorite, Subtle disaster is funny as well.  I've only read a few of them: Id, Kubera, and The Legend of Maian. All of them where average. Id was good until it devolved into powerlevels nonsense and the publisher went bankrupt. Kubera was good (and pretty cool because its full color) until the author started shipping. The people translating it are also tremendous faggots that try to get you to use their retarded realtime browser translation extension, because somehow viewing the webcomic on its original page legitimizes the whole thing. Never mind that the extension doesn't work on tablets. The Legend of Maian is kinda boring and I don't remember much.<br><br>So in my experience manwha kinda sucks. I picked up my first manhua the other day and its been much better.</br></br>  <br>Manhua is written literally the same fucking way as Manga, now shut the fuck up.</br>  <br> literally <br>You should stop using words you don't know the meaning of.</br></br>  I like the few manhwa with dedicated efforts but it's a real turnoff that many of them have webcomic-tier quality.  <br>No fuck off with gookshit<br/></br>  <br>Go eat your dog with your shit webcartoons elsewhere you piece of shit</br>  <br>Chill out with that autism m8.</br>  <br><br>Go shit up the thread about Cory in da House if you're so mad.</br></br>  <br>Just because there's a rule breaking piece of shit elsewhere on the board doesn't mean that this thread isn't a rule breaking piece of shit either, fuck of dog eater</br>  <br>Manga and manhua means comics but that doesn't mean that we can post /co/ shit here.

It's not really a bad ending after all.    <br>he pushed her away</br>  <br>What would be really funny is sempai, the wife, and her end up having a 3some in the final chapter while the MC watches.<br><br>even by hentai standards, this MC is pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Good to see her standing up for herself.<br><br>Shu might do it again...so maybe it's still a bitter ending.</br></br></br>  So it´s ending. Ah man Haruka was really hot.<br><br> When are they all killing each other ? </br></br>  <br>This is begin of volume 3.<br>It's 7~ chapters away from ending.<br><br>We have to see the coworker plot unfold and Haruka having love-making pregnant sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So you saying like 6 chapters until it happens ?</br>  <br><br><br><br> but never stood up for her and never tried to stop the affair. <br>Wrong, he tolld him that he never got angry at them nor stopped them.<br><br>Also him telling sempai and kawaii that Haruka isn't at fault is IS standing up for her. <br><br><br>Haruka is infertile. The doctor said in earlier chapters that Shu's sperm is fine.<br><br><br>Actually it's the author fault for making a third volume when he said the story was ending with the second volume.<br><br>He got greedy and exchanged quality for money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Netoraserare brings pure autism. <br><br>Its a NTR and they take it seriously.<br><br>Go look at the posts on </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't know, but having a child was a big deal for Haruka on volume 1.<br><br>So I'm hoping we see lots of that soon enough. Besides, it's fucking hot</br></br></br>  At least he divorced her.<br>If he was some true beta shit, he'd stayed with her while senpai fucks her.</br>  <br> If he was some true beta shit, he'd stayed with her while senpai fucks her. <br>I kind of agree</br></br>  <br> he doesn't use the catalog <br>cuck spotted</br></br>  <br>So same thing as with to love ru fags, right ?</br>  Even with a whole volume ahead, predictable ending is so predictable.<br><br>He'll never man up, but she will realize that it's not sex with Senpai that make her happy.<br><br>It's sex with senpai with the faggot watching.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A U T I S M<br>U<br>T<br>I<br>S<br>M</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds reasonable.</br>  <br>Wrong author if you look for this.</br>  <br>What author should i look for then ?</br>  <br>I want to angrily thrust my penis into every character's anus. I still like Harkna though hopefully the author keeps what character she had instead of just turning her into a generic cock hungry NTR heroine.</br>  <br>C U C K<br>U<br>C<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll never man up, but she will realize that it's not sex with Senpai that make her happy. <br> It's sex with senpai with the faggot watching. <br>I can kind of imagine that. It'd be like when they first met Senpai at the elevator or whatever, except now there will be a reversal of roles, sort of. Senpai and Haruka aren't having a fulfilling sex life, so she asks Senpai if she can ask her ex husband to watch them fuck. That'd be all, like, thematic and full circle if that happened.</br></br></br>  <br>The author threw away all his originality after magazine asks for more chapters.<br><br>And yes, he is good at storytelling. But not that good.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you have the wrong author. That's probably pretty close to what's going to happen except they split up, she leaves senpai and everyone is moving on.</br>  <br>I doubt she'd ask her ex, it's most likely some fat men, a bigger guy than senpai or a foreigner to do her.</br>  Wait this got animated? <br>The fuck?<br>http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;t<wbr>id=1776130</wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, this series is never getting anal tag or what ?

Shuu won't go through that shit voluntarily again.</br></br>  <br>Like I'm feeling stronger</br>  <br>90% of Netoraserare threads are fanfic.</br>    Did you guys really assemble here, make a Netoraserare thread,..just to complain about the /h/ thread?  <br>what about Exsibisionist, sex outdoor watching by people mybe?</br>  <br><br>Fanfic, didn't you notice yet?</br></br>  <br>This <br/></br>  <br>Senpai and Haruka fucking anymore doesn't even make sense if she's knocked up.<br><br>But she is a slut so we'll have to see if things change. I'm interested.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn´t it basically what every board does ?</br>  <br> he wouldn't make love to a woman carrying his own child <br>tell me you are joking</br></br>  <br>Did they at least get his despair face right?</br>  <br>Why make a thread on /a/ when you got one on  with more info and real discussions ?</br>  <br>Here is better and we have the 2ch thread and nip blogs links, /h/ thread couldn't even find those.</br>  <br>Didn´t you notice second frame ?</br>  <br>I don't know, man. S'not my thing. Fucking pregnant whores isn't me. I'm sorry, anon. Will you forgive me?</br>  <br>Because OP is a faggot that wants to be "first!" by opening threads and posting memes everytime.<br><br>Just report it.</br></br></br>  <br>On /h/ i would just complain about /a/. No difference at all.</br>  <br>I'm not surprised if you're right.</br>  <br>Those are already there hourse before this thread you retard.<br><br>Try searching first next time.</br></br></br>  <br>Because this is not even the first one for this series in particular. <br>Also, the other ones were active threads. While there is like 1 in a month here, there is constant thread (or more) in /h/.<br>Stop complaining newlord.</br></br></br>  So the final moral is that cucks are fucked up people that spread their degradation onto others, infect those around them, end up in a pit of despair alone, and everyone is worse for wear after it to the point that you can't even pity any of them since they're too fucked for even that much?  <br><br>fuck off cuck this belongs to </br></br>  <br>This story is so bad now.</br>  It's long overdue time for /a/ and /h/ to be fused anyways  <br>That's how you live anon?</br>  <br>It's basically don't let your fetishes fuck up your relationships. They're both at fault and are pretty pitiful people. It's probably going to end with them splitting up, senpai going back to doing whatever he does (does he even have a job?), and them moving back with their parents.</br>  <br>Digital version where?

Sub-desu?</br>  Does anyone even know what the fuck is happening in this chapter? Ignoring OP, of course.  <br>Mostly fanfic, bad translations, misunderstanding and autism. <br><br>It would be better to wait.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody  </br>  Newfag here, is this aloud ?  <br>My one true god</br>  <br>/h/ sucks monkey balls. Newfag indeed</br>  Senpai sucks, wife sucks, husband sucks. Nobody deserves anyone else, everyone's terrible, what was the point of this crap?  <br>The point, I guess, is:<br><br>Husband sucks but at least he's selfless about it, blaming himself for everything that happened.<br>Wife sucks and blames Shu for shit she did.<br>Senpai sucks because not only is he openly selfish, he's a home-wrecker. <br><br>Pretty much all there is to it. Doesn't answer your question, but hey, we're all wondering where the fuck the answers are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what was the point of this crap? <br>NETORASERARE<br><br>Some dude netorase'd his wife, then she gets really netorare'd in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  The lesson here is don't let other men fuck your wife or she may leave you. What's surprising or upsetting about this?  <br>It's annoying, particularly because the wife only seems to care about her husband in the end (though only to hurt him) even though she could've said no at any time</br>  <br> Kawaii kisses Shuu and gets naked (tits not as big as Haruka but silk and pretty) <br> Kawaii says he needs to leave the slut(saigo worst kind of woman) for cheating and that she will love(?) him instead. <br>Was this confirmed? I really need to know</br></br></br>  You could tell from the beginning she wanted to please him but she was a filthy slut. You could see since the beginning when she jacks off to the thought of the mailman. Ho's will he be hos.

Usually hate NTR but the guy did ask for it.</br></br>  <br>Darwinism at it's finest anon.<br><br>They don't deserve to reproduce after all. Good riddance to their cuck gens.</br></br></br>  <br>He kind of deserve for pushing her cute wifr into all that perverted acts. Fuck, leaving her at the mercy of this bastard was unforgivable.</br>  <br>You just made remember how fucking disgusting is this so called*husband*<br><br>Good for Haruka she got herself a handsome rich man to carry his children.</br></br></br>  <br> rich <br><br>ha!</br></br></br>  <br>He totally deserves it. It groos yet is my favorite chapter.</br>  <br>The man has a company job that allows him to take 6 hours at day to fuck his woman.<br>That's fucking boss.</br></br>  <br>fucking betas</br>  <br>You don't sound very satisfied, anon.</br>  <br>I don't like the husband, but senpai is a douche and it doesn't seem like he even has a job. She's definite down grading if she moves on to senpai. Best option would've been to tell him no and leave if he kept going on with his cuck fetish shit.</br>  <br>As someone unfamiliar with the terminology (and Japanese in general), does netorase mean protagonist-organized netorare? I'd never heard "netorase" before this series, and google isn't helping much. Anyone have literal translations of either netorase or netorare?</br>  <br>A little bit because after all this revealing /h/ still go on about their fanfic. It's kinda disturbing when I saw some idiot that read NTR but expect vanilla and keep dreaming that their happy vanilla dream will happen.</br>  <br>No. The ending will indefinitely be bittersweet. Vanilla doesn't exist in any Netorare.</br>  The funny thing is that this situation is pretty close to netori stories where the MC steals other people's wives.  <br>False.<br>Koukai Bench had a happy ending.<br>As did Tatoebe Haha Ga.<br>Maybe also Taboo Charming Mother.</br></br></br></br>  What makes Gary so smug?

Can we all agree that the Dolls are by far the best villains that Symphogear has ever had?  <br>Agreed.</br>   mfw this episode <br>This will be just like the time she got her arm bit off, right? She'd just heal it right back, right?</br>  <br>So, what exactly is going on here? How will they apply the Dainsleif to making the gears work again?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Only if they can top the absurdity of Fine's goal and motivation from season 1.</br>  <br>That's not Fine.</br>    <br>Yes, but I still want to see Ver return somewhere around episode 8 when everybody least expects it.</br>  <br><br>Fine was  fine  too, but the dolls are way more interesting.</br></br>  <br>New pendants.</br>  <br>What else would it be?</br>  <br> shark teeth <br> reaction faces <br> ballerina poses <br> sassy ojousama voice <br> music box plinks mixed in with her clickety-clacks <br>Also voiced by best little witch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fine was fine </br>  <br>So is the androgynous midget actually a spy?

It's becoming increasingly obvious in hindsight.</br></br>  Do you think the original Carol transferred into her first homunculus body as an adult or has she always been a child? Or maybe  even the very first Carol is a homunculus.   <br>I am surprised she still has KUROI GUNGNIR? since Igalima and Shul Shagana were updated with white color schemes. Understandable since they don't want her to look TOO much like Kanade, but still kinda surprising.</br>  <br>So since she's a body surfing old hag with a few vampiric traits (the whole memories thing), is Carol basically a genderflipped Zouken Matou?</br>   Project Ignite <br> Those spiky looking gears. <br><br>Who thought it was a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>What a twist!</br>  <br>Updates happen with X-drives, and Maria never X-drived with Gungnir.</br>  <br>Fine was better.

The bodies of Carol and Elfnein are also called this.<br><br>The original Carol was born in Europe several hundred years ago. Some time later, she succeeded the will of her late father, an alchemist. In order to find the answer to a question that would take far longer than her lifespan to solve, she began to transfer her memories to homunculus vessels, surviving to the present day.<br><br>Carol only performs memory transfer to those bodies which she deems to be more than perfect, and those which fail to match her standard are instead used as manual labour or as subjects in human experiments.<br><br>As Elfnein does not possess the mole under Carol's right eye, she was originally to be disposed of as a failed product. However, the construction of the Chateau de Tiffauges required extra labour, and thus she was able to avoid her fate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Glad that Garie isn't completely relegated to a support role.  I haven't really been keeping up; are there any theories about who the eyes in the background of this bit of the OP might belong to?  <br> Failed product because it doesn't have a mole <br>Huh, that means Carol didn't have anything down there too.</br></br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br>I suppose its Carol and Elfnein's.</br>  <br>Does Carol has a cunny?</br>  <br>The more important question is does her cunny have a braid too?</br>  <br>They're adult-style eyes so at least one of them is probably Carol before she started living as a homunculus.</br>  <br>Neither of them have cat eyes though, do they?</br>  <br>she also has green hair, but whatever, that mole is more important</br>  I love Garie, she's pretty  hot_   <br><br>The little semicircles in the bottom of Elfnein's eyes don't appear quite as purple as Carol's  yet .</br></br>  What a dumb bitch.    <br>Fine does.<br>It's Elfnine when Fine awakens inside her.</br></br>  <br>Seriously, when did Gallie had the time to swap the water clone?

Garie can make illusions, she could have hid the fact that Micha landed immediately after getting hit the first time and at the same time projected the fake Micha flying through the air that Hibiki punched.</br>  <br>She materialized the illusion out of the water in the air after Biki's manly rescue.<br><br>The water was everywhere, so it would only take a split-second.</br></br></br>  <br>why are so many people hating on green? while she isn't best girl she's really cool, why do people hate her?</br>  <br>Because they have shit taste.<br><br>Blue &gt; Green = Red &gt;&gt;&gt; Yellow</br></br></br>  <br><br>What is every ones dance?<br><br>Red is ??? <br><br>Blue is Ballerina<br><br>Green is some kinda Tango / Mexico dance<br><br>Yellow JoJo poses</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shes ugly and she hasnt done anything yet</br>  <br> Mexico dance <br>Kek.</br></br>  <br>Clown, Ballerina, Flamenco, Nigger.</br>  <br>She can most likely make things invisible too, not just create illusions out of nowhere.

She also improved some other stuff, therefore Garie is the only one that can transfer memories</br>  <br> maria <br> anything like signum <br>You insult me.</br></br></br>  <br>Capoeira.</br>  Almost looks like she borrowed clothes from Shirabe.  I FUCKING CALLED THAT SHIT LAST WEEK FAGGOTS.<br><br><br>MARIA IS USELESSFAGS BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>Samba.</br>  <br>that would be cute</br>  <br>Not enough pink to be Shirabe.<br><br>Looks like something Chris would wear, but there's no way that's Chris' because it's not drooping off  it .</br></br></br>  <br>Samba isnt Sambo u fukn nerd</br>  Official doll rating, all other ratings are  Valid too <br><br>Blue &gt; Red &gt;&gt; Yellow &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Green</br></br>  <br>The title this week was really clever.<br>It referred to both Maria using Gungnir again and Hibiki making a comeback.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>and Gungnir was used twice this episode. It fits all the pun.</br>  Is it just me or is Hibiki getting bigger?  <br>Best tastes.</br>  <br>As much as I want Yellow to not be last because of dat hair, she's kinda last at this point. Though she's also received by far the least characterization, and we have no explanation for the giant ghost thingy yet, so she still has potential. <br><br><br>I don't think anyone besides die-hard trolls actually thinks Maria is still useless</br></br></br></br>  <br>For you, maybe.</br>  <br>She got taller, sometimes growing girls do that.</br>  <br> giant ghost thingy <br>That's Leiur's 'little sister', basically a giant Autoscorer based on Leiur.  Read the keywords. </br></br>  <br> What are you gonna do, stab me? </br>  <br>I don't know.

Here's mine:<br>Tsubasa gets a booty call from Maria to meet her at the concert arena. She gets there, turns out it was Carol and the concert organizers using a voice modifier. All of the Autoscorers are there too. They've stolen all of her swords and they tell her she has to follow all their instructions and whatever happens to her she has to act like she enjoys it. If she doesn't, they will break all of her swords and get their concerts canceled.<br><br>So the next day, Tsubasa walks into a room wearing diapers and a pacifier, acting like a retarded baby. All of the Autoscorers are there and they give her the hardest, most brutal gangrape in history. As instructed, Tsubasa acts like she completely enjoys it and asks for more.<br>Then in walks that guy Dr. Ver from season 2. Turns out he joined the Autoscorers for revenge. He's been eating a special protein-only diet for weeks just for this. He pulls down his pants and partially defecates the longest, thickest, hardest log ever, and proceeds to use it to give Tsubasa the most furious ass-to-ass action ever recorded. Tsubasa can't hold her tears anymore, but pretends they're from pleasure. It's finally over.<br><br>Then Carol reveals the room they're in is actually see through from the outside, and they're in the concert arena. All of the audience has been watching Tsubasa get gangbanged and enjoy it, and it's been broadcasted worldwide. They finally kick her out of the premises, and break all of her swords anyway.<br><br>Later, Tsubasa runs into Maria, who tells her she didn't know she was such a straight CIS scum. Her lolis walk in and proceed to have passionate sex with her in front of Tsubasa, and after they finish, pee all over Tsubasa, much to Maria's delight<br><br>After the ending credits, Tsubasa is wandering off on a road in the middle of nowhere. A speeding car runs her over and breaks her spine, but it's non lethal. She is left laying there in extreme pain for days, and finally dies of hunger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drink bleach.</br>  <br>We have to believe in justice for them, anon.</br>    Next time on Symphogear As...<br><br> Lesbians Check <br> Get wrecked by loli villan &amp; her non-human guardians Check <br> Get upgraded devic- I mean symphogears Check </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but who has more PHONIC GAIN??</br>  So no ring around the moon in this scene?

What really separates the dolls from the other henchmen of past seasons is that they're totally loyal creations instead of manipulated angsty girls.

I do love her character design, especially compared with mermaids in other works that either focus too much on practicality (i.e. bald and scaly) or are just humans wearing a tail fin (e.g. Ariel from The Little Mermaid doesn't have gills, webbed fingers, only a tail fin, and knees for some reason).</br></br>  <br> Cerea's 10/10 mom that low.  <br>Denied</br></br>  <br> the gills and webbed hand's still mess that up <br>You mean improve.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you guys even read the manga? <br><br>Seriously, after Mero helps Miia with Darling she noticed about her own feelings and left the cuck aspect of her personality aside. She actually loves Darling and deserve some love. <br><br>From the main group everyone get some special moments from Darling except her, glad to see Crabman making that happens in this arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these Doppel haters <br> hating on eldritch horrors </br>  <br>Isn't she starting to notice that it feels like shit to not get loved in return? <br><br>Also where is the "murder fish" part from? Are we talking about the part where she suddenly brings him down the lake in order to mate with him since "death was inevitable"?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if Mero fall in love with someone she can change her body or evolves in some way to "adapt" her current self to the ther person, like develops legs when she's away from the water and then she can back to the mermaid tail whenever she wants.</br>  <br>Anon that's not how it works. Also the entire appeal is that they're monster girls, what's the point of being able to turn full human?</br>  <br>That's what clinched it, but it's the first of two drowning attempts. Then again, to be fair, the second time we learn that her tragedy mode is beyond her conscious control.</br>  Mero is one of the most bautiful mermaids I ever seen, Crab have some good taste.  <br>I'm not saying go full human, but at least get some improvement to move by her own like Miia.</br>  <br>Hey man, to each their own but they are both turn offs for me. I'm into stomach/tits so the gills being right there kinda ruins it for me. The hands aren't really a big deal but they are a little weird and impractical.</br>  <br>Correct one.</br>  <br> Mermaid smell <br> Covered in slime <br> Dropped</br></br></br>  <br> Fishy scent <br><br>why would anyone want that?</br></br></br>  <br>Murderfish is a worn out thread meme.</br>  <br>Putting the ideal wife material that is Yukio and the antithesis to it that is Miia the on the same level invalidates your entire list.</br>  <br>She has like the least personality of any of the girls, and she uses a weird shapeshift body that isn't nearly up to the other girl's standards. She's basically only for the transforming horror fans.</br>  <br>Cerea to S+ and it'll be nearly perfect</br>  <br>Because she`s slippery?</br>  <br><br> Faggots who never smell a fish fresh from the water <br><br>Seriously? at least go out of your rooms fegets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you,  Homura </br>  Why is Rachnee the best girl and probably not gonna mate with Darling?  <br>Objectively the best</br>  You come home and see your monster daughter duck taped to the wall. Then Monster Mommy comes home. How do you explain your dumb as fuck daughter taping herself to the wall?  <br>This is going to end on a full harem, she's going to get the D anyways.</br>  Fact is people there are only 3 girls as of now likely to win the Darlingbowl. Unless Mero pulls something or Kurusu displays legitimate interest, she may very well get a tragedy  <br> monster daughter duck <br>I don't think I remember ever seeing any duck monster girls.</br></br>  <br>Ducktaped</br>  <br>Duct tape?</br>  <br> Fact is people there are only 3 girls as of now likely to win the Darlingbowl <br>More like 6 and then Lala in the afterlife.</br></br>  <br>It's duct tape moron</br>  <br> Goth-loli clothes: She likes them </br>  <br>How? That's only possible if they're retarded.</br>  <br><br>This thread needs more pictures of best girl.</br></br>  <br>It's not duct tape, it's Duck Tape.</br>  <br><br>Duck Tape is a brand of duct tape.</br></br>  <br>Everyone point, laugh, and move on.</br>  <br>I concur.</br>  <br>Finally, someone puts Tio in S where she belongs</br>  If it ends in harem, which i doubt since everyone is always jealous or going on about how they want main man for thenselves, or someone wins it's gonna be a shitstorm anyways.<br><br>What do you hope for in the end? Do you want him to end up with anyone in particular, or are you fine with a harem end?<br><br>I think i kinda prefer Cerea so far, with Rachnera coming second.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Tio deserves S+</br>  <br> What do you hope for in the end? </br>  <br> What do you hope for in the end? <br>Darling's 5 identical siblings come home in the final chapters so each girl can have their own Darling.</br></br>  Papi a best <br><br>There I said it. Now everyone can agree and move on to better discussion.</br></br>  <br> A fucking Spartan from HALO  <br> Can rekt the shit out of you just stroking your dick  <br> Die meanwhile you have sex with her <br><br>Nah, she's pretty much rank Z.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True that</br>  <br>Nigger the only viable end is the Harem.</br>  <br>She has perfect control of her strength.</br>  <br> implying she wouldn't be as gentle as a fucking butterfly with you <br><br> She makes sure there's five first aid kits by the bed </br></br></br>  SMITH BEST GIRL  <br>Cerea win would be ideal but Suu or Miia end would also be fine.</br>  <br>This. Eternally this. Even after they all die, Darling will convince Lala to bring them all together in the Afterlife for eternal love.</br>  <br>Harem end&gt;&gt;&gt;Miia end&gt;&gt;&gt;Smith is a Succubus end&gt;Rachnee end&gt;&gt;Suu end&gt; Anything else I don't really care after that. The only endings that would legitimately upset me would be a no one or ambiguous end.</br>  <br>You do realize we're talking about the guy who comes back from the brink of death daily just to make everyone happy, right?</br>  <br> Smith <br> Human </br></br>  <br>If be fine if either Miia or Rachnera ended up as his bride. I think they can still be a (hilarious) family even if Kimihito doesn't marry them all. And it could still theoretically keep going even after marriage.</br>  <br>Preach on Harembro.</br>   MFW This thread <br><br>Mero needs more lovin' and less sumer hatin'</br></br>  <br> ambiguous end <br><br>This shit pisses me off so much, it's like the author is too much of a pussy to go with a certain ending, so in order to not piss off the rest he just goes with the "safe" end.<br><br>I seriously hope he dosn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No girl shall be left unloved.<br><br> Nice digits. </br></br></br>  <br>Also, as Papi pointed out, everyone tries to murder darling one way or another. A few drownings is par for the course in this manga.</br>  <br>My love for the girls burns like the setting Sun.</br>  <br>As long as Darling doesn't sleep with any of them before he picks one, they'd be fine. I think Miia is probably the only one who wouldn't be able to accept not being chosen, and would probably leave the house. Papi could easily be little sister/daughteru, Suu does her slime stuff and copies Papi, Mero is sad but is fine with being sad, Cerea just acts like a regular knight/bodyguard, Rachnee keeps practicing bondage on the girls and acting like a big sister, Lala continues waiting for his death. This is the main reason I think Miia is the most likely singular girl ending.</br>  <br>Seriously. I don't read manga so that I can make up my own ending because the mangaka was too scared/lazy.</br>   no matter what happens Lala still wins in the end   <br> tfw she plays the long con for 60 years only to have him meet an angel right on his death bed that he spends the afterlife with. </br>  <br>Yeah the harem end is kind of an easy way to write this. I'm willing to give the crabman more credit and have faith that whoever he picks will be plausible</br>  <br>Those pelvic fins are sooooo cute! And handy, given the manga's genre...</br>  <br> Implying he wouldn't just stay friends with her in the afterlife because even after death he still loves the ones he choose <br> Implying she won't have moved on by then if she's not the one choosen <br><br>Pls</br></br></br></br>  Even if we all agreee that the harem ending would be best, in every harem there's a favorite, who would you like to fill that role?<br><br>For me it's definitely Miia, i've had a thing for lamias and other snake ladies since i was a kid...</br></br>  <br> Horse Pussy </br>  <br>The one that could win in a battle royale.</br>  <br>The elusive harem end is just as rare, if not moreso, as a single girl victory, and I'll never understand why. "Lets just leave this completely unresolved and blueball everybody! That's the safest bet!" said no one ever. Meanwhile the only opposition to true harem end seems to come from people who just want to shit on the rest of the 'losers' to feel like they have 'superior' tastes. Never mind that the harem lets everyone win. Some people just want to watch the world burn I suppose.</br>  <br>so Suu? or Lala?</br>  <br>More or less the way I invisioned it. On one hand I like the idea of Rachnee winning, dropping her act/emotional defense mechanism, and Miia going off to do her own thing. On the other I'm fine with Miia remaining his girl even with all the interruptions. Just one big strange family</br>  <br>Honestly, the second drowning was where she started warming up to me. The way she hugged Darling from behind, plus the look of panic on her face when she realized she came close to drowning him a second time...</br>  <br>No girl in this manga has perfect control of their strength  or their erogenous zones </br>  <br>We won't know until it happens.</br>  <br>I dunno. I know it's echii, but i'd still prefer him just choosing a victor, i don't really care about shitting or glooming over my pick winning or not. <br><br>Harem endings just kinda feels like a second safe bet, or a cop out, especially with how everyone makes it seem like it's not really an option. Especially with the whole harem the lamias wanted darling to be in, and him refusing, and some others scenes showing that he's inclined to choose one.<br><br>Not that i'd have anything against it if it did happen, i mean i guess it is possible to truly love more than one person, but it's just not my preference i guess.</br></br></br></br></br>   Mero thread <br> TF who's the biggets Merofag isn't here <br><br>What the fuck just happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep pointing it out and you're gonna lure then in faggot.

Miia seems like the most likely candidate because she came first and is the poster-girl of the franchise.</br>  Benefits of choosing a victor:<br><br>Possible (interesting, not the usual annoying) drama in the future<br><br>The wedding/preparing chapter- shenanigans surely<br><br>The honeymoon- interrupted by other girls spying/trying to make it perfect but fail<br><br>Protest against Kimihito's marriage by anti- species people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know that in most species of spider, the female eats the male after her eggs fertilization, right? <br>Then again, that just makes me all the more excited to see the Arachnid civilization.

You're alright in my books.<br><br>I will say that the notion of the harem being a 'second cop out' never sat well with me, though from a logical standpoint, it is technically the 'safest' bet, since there wouldn't be any 'true loser'. I feel that it's possible to love people in equal measure, but for different reasons. Cerea's strong character and her steller rack. Rachnee's carefree lewdness yet bashful side. Miia's devotion (even if its overpowering and off-putting to me most of the time) and her sexy slither. Papi's delicious ass and enthusiasm. Suu's limitless potential and pure innocence. Mero's regal air and supportive and polite outlook on the rest of the girls(just gotta get her out of that suffering fetish). Lala's adorable chuuni-ness and mysterious side, also her stellar body doesn't hurt either. These are just a few things, of course, but there's numerous things to love about every girl.</br></br></br>  <br> Bird end being not surprising <br>Like hell.

You may like everyone, but i feel like it's not gonna be exactly equaly. Not that i can actually give a real insight if what i said it's true or not, but it's just how it seems to me.<br><br>I personally belive that as long as you're not affecting or hurting anyone else, it's not really a problem what you do, so i'm ok with harem, but like i said it dosn't sit well with me.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they're naked</br>  <br> Doppel reveals true form <br> Audience all go insane </br></br>  <br>as they wrestle do their clothing rip(if not) come completely off</br>  <br>Of course. <br><br> DOPPLE-MANIA IS RUNNING WILD! <br> she showboats like Hogan <br> the crowds are all on the ground and convulsing. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please, you can't go wrong with macho man.

I mean jesus, at least impose some limits or something, just because they're girls and potential marriage candidates dosn't mean it's fine that they can break your ribs 3 times in the same day.<br><br>Otherwise i like his character, especially the moment where the girl who wanted Rachnera to come back to the other family hosters. I was thinking "i guess it's fine, since the girls seems to be pretty willing to forgive, even tough she's being overly accepting of everything", when he mentioned how she was acting as if accepting Rachnera was like an obstacle then i noticed the girl was acting in the wrong.

This means that if you are involved in a tough scenario, you can turn it into a possitive thing.<br><br>I believe that this is true because a person may not have a choice to get out of obstacles, but he or she can make the best out of it. To try to escape from obstacles without embracing the challenge would prove that you are a coward or lack the guts to do so.<br><br>For example, an ordinary, everyday man is busy living his life, then one day he is drafted into the military to go to Iraq and fight in the war that is going on today. Now he could try to quit and go home, but due to the standards of today's U.S. government, this choice is hardly an option. Or he could try and fight for land that he walks on. And when the war is over, he could possibly come back as a hero.<br><br>In Kolulu's case, instead selfishly sacrificing her existance in the human world and friendship with Zatch, Kiyo, and Lori(and "Tina"), she could've helped aid Zatch &amp; Kiyo in the fight against the evil mamodo(especially during the Zofis arc). And for him to be a staight-A student makes it pretty awkward on his person. In my opinion, it is also pointless to make a promise to someone who wasn't willing to try to turn an obstacle into an opportunity.<br><br>Makoto Raiku ignores this quote all together, just to prove something senseless as "fighting is wrong". There have been references in other animes of how the spirit of fighting can be used in a sense of good. Certain animes that relate to this are Dragonball Z, Street Fight II V, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Power Stone. Most of these have tournaments or organized fights such as, the Tenkaichi Budokai or the Demon World Tournament.<br><br>In conclusion, though Kolulu may have punked out, she could've had the above option to train and control her Zeruk. Neverless, I still believe that obstacles can be turned into an opportunities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Electronic spamming is the use of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited messages (spam), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site. While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social spam, television advertising and file sharing spam. It is named after Spam, a luncheon meat, by way of a Monty Python sketch in which Spam is included in every dish.[1] The food is stereotypically disliked/unwanted, so the word came to be transferred by analogy.<br><br>Spamming remains economically viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the barrier to entry is so low, spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have been forced to add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.[2]<br><br>A person who creates electronic spam is called a spammer.[3]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah.
