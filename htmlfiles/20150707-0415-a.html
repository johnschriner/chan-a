What's the chance that they're official? Design's the same as the one that is supposedly only limited to 100 for pre orders. Quality also seems to be there.  <br>You could get better deals selling on MFC rather than here.</br>  <br>Kinokuniya were reported to sell bootleg dakis during AX, and it was in the past thread as well.</br>  <br>I know. Whatever I don't sell by Wednesday or so I'll put up there. But I always like to give anons a chance first.</br>  <br>RIP. <br>Oh well. Still got my Yano</br></br>    Look what people at MFC comment when your birthday comes up.<br> You are the birthday star today... Happy birthday! ...xD ...xD </br>  <br>People who say xD are mentally ill</br>  <br>I got that one.<br>I removed my birthday from my account since.</br></br>  <br>I wish I lived in US to buy something, as I said before, good luck.</br>  <br>How much for meido kuroneko?</br>  What's the best way to order from toranoana?<br><br>Some anons were talking about some proxies, forwarding sites but I didn't really get in the end which one was the best. Someone even said that 2you4 didn't handle r-18 stuff or whatever.</br></br>  Left butt vs right butt<br>Which one would you prefer?</br>  <br>I got my first fig today. I know the picture is shit but does her ahoge look right to you guys?

Don't know about other things though.<br><br>2you4 and BiJ are great for forwarding. Goody-Japan is a good proxy but the downside is you have to wait for someone there to place the order so if stock is very low and you it's outside their operating hours it might sell out. FromJapan seems good too, though I'm still waiting for the stuff I won from auctions to arrive so I can't say for sure yet.</br></br></br>  Box  If I just want to buy digital copies of stuff off tora no ana I still need a jp address and phone number to register, should I just completely make this up and put a randomly picked existing/nonexisting address in?  <br>Packaging</br>  <br> and you it's <br>Meant to say "and you place the order when it's outside their operating hours".</br></br>  <br>FJ won't buy from Tora, sadly.</br>  <br>Bubble Wrap</br>  <br><br><br>Stop</br></br></br>  <br>Reveal</br>  <br><br><br>I'll give GJ a try then, just tried to register on Tora and apparently my moon is not quite there yet, so a proxy service is going to be the best to not screw something for now.</br></br></br>  <br>Perfection</br>  <br>And why did this shit need 5 posts?</br>  <br>If I were to explain your series of posts, it would be a drumroll, followed by https://<span>youtu.be/1ytCEuuW2_A  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I don't say this often, but go back to fucking /v/.

I just put up about 8 more.</br>  <br>How many do you have, bud?</br>  Just reminding you all that this is a thing and people will buy it  <br>Is that a new Zoid?</br>  <br>Evangelion rebuild. In episode 3 they get this thing that's powered by unit 1</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god if you don't say is from Eva 3.0 I would have never guessed, and I watched the movie. That thing doesn't look like anything I remember from it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's that giant ship at the start that Asuka and Misato etc are in. I'm pretty conflicted that it's a thing to begin with</br>  <br>Pochaco erryday</br>  <br>I'm glad I've never watched any Eva shit except the original series when it was first on TV in english.</br>  <br><br>I remember the giant ship, just not that it looked like a digimon/zoid.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't blame you. The rebuild so far has kinda slaughtered everything<br>Asuka is a bitch with no explanation. Misato is just a slut, nothing on her daddy issues and Shinji  causes the third impact and is in a coma for 14 years and comes back and is sorta okay with the fact he killed nearly everyone and is eager as fuck to get back in unit 1 but everyone hates him and Misato threatens to kill him if she catches him piloting an eva <br><br>That may be from how they didn't show the whole thing very often. But I might be remembering it too vaguely</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Rebuild 1&amp;2. But 3.0 just butchered everything about the series.</br></br>  <br>Agreed<br>But I would have like some back story to Mari</br></br>  <br>I got pissed at 3.0.</br>  <br>By the sounds of it a lot of people did</br>  <br><br>Because first 2 are basically what you already know but with more action and a few different things here and there, which is nice. 3.0 is just, quite literally, what the flying fuck am I watching? Nothing makes fucking sense, at all.</br></br>  No new Haruhi figures for the spinoff, yet?<br>Odd.</br>  <br>Don't forget about the fact that nothing that they showed on the preview actually happened.</br>  <br>Don't forget the gigantic budget and the addition of Mari  Sue </br>  <br>We've been over this anon, he didn't cause the impact.</br>  <br>According to the rebuild he did</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I forgot about this too.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it was stopped before the impact took place.<br>Come on anon we figured this out ages ago.</br></br>  You're still getting this, right?  <br>Only if I have enough money to.</br>  <br>Depends who makes it</br>  <br> liking the shitty Illya spin-off <br><br>It ruined best girl.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127664271 <br>Nobody cares indeed.</br>  <br><br>If Amakuni is the one doing it, yeah.

Daki.</br>  Did the Mage for Bikini Warriors get shown yet?  So how do you guys clean the semen off your figs after you're done? I usually just use hot water, but I'm wondering there's a better way.  <br>No.</br>  What's the most recent order you placed? I just put a bid down on a Greek island.  <br>Can never have enough daki covers, but her appearance in artbooks is slim, and I have a handful of covers. I'd take an artbook at this point, honestly.</br>  <br>Well if you consider that Alter's Selvaria was at 18k at some point, and since the face of the Vertex's one is more faithful to Raita's style, I would have expected to see her soul out faster.<br><br>Yeah but she's at 12,5K (with the discount of course)at amiami (brand new), so it's basically the same.<br><br><br>Wasn't that Non-virgin artbook around 4,5K?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nop, that's the price with Japanese txa removed and Amiami's discount. You have tot take in to consideration the Japanese market.</br>  <br>What was the open bid?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127665190 <br>Steal her collection?

If you watched the anime and actually paid attention is not going to be hard to get what you're watching. <br><br>3.0 is nothing like it since it not even introduces you anything, it just launches you into whatever the fuck that world is and expect you to get the shit that's happening, with characters being completely different from what you knew from the previous Rebuild movies. At almost no point they try to explain you anything, once the movie finish you're left feeling like you just skipped a movie or got into an anime mid way. <br><br>If you like that, good for you.

I know it's positive for the most part, but hearing the fuck ups is amusing anyways.  <br>sometimes that happens, it's better to order sealed/unopened for that reason.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, those are good. They are basically a retell from NGE with more action and a less personal problems of each character.</br></br>  <br>No Mandarake hasn't done me wrong yet</br>  <br>I got an unopened samurai months ago and found slight brown discoloration on her torso area. At first I thought it was just japanese semen folded X-times but I realized only recently that it was probably exposed to a shit light bulb with high wattage.<br><br>I also found 'dirt' on alter senhime's breasts which I was able to wash off with water only months later.</br></br></br>  Anyone support the anime by STUDIO 4C?  <br>Once. I got FREEing's 2012 Racing Miku and she was missing the little wedge that attaches her to the base. Manda, in true Japanese fashion, said it wasn't their fault and it must have happened in transit. Six months later I got a full refund from Japan Post.</br>  <br>Whenever I order something opened, I ask them for pics and most of the time they'll get back to me before it getting sold. Nice folks. Haven't done me wrong yet. Only bought 14 figures from them though.</br>  <br>I'm scared to ask but what would the price be on Ganondorf?</br>  <br>Ignore me, just read you said to ask on MFC. I feel dumb.</br>  <br>Do that. He said $450 a while back though.</br>  <br>Hmmm that's a week's pay. I do like my ganondorf though, even though its /v/ related and wouldn't fit in too well with my /a/ stuff. Maybe a separate display for him. Thanks for the info though, I'll see what he says on MFC.</br>  <br><br>That's actually cheaper than I thought, considering that was his retail price 2 years ago.</br></br>  <br> 450$ is a weeks pay <br>Just how do you live?</br></br>  <br> I live with my mom still actually. I am a parasite to her pretty much and haven't went to college more than two months before I left. That was two years ago after high school. I'm 20 now and I have no idea what I am doing anymore; I just work at a terrible job for Amazon opening boxes for 10 hours and get home and sit &amp; look at the wall for 3 then sleep. Sorry for the rant. </br>  <br>If you're an artist, you can try and do commissions. Furfags are the big market but you can make nicely from regular porn too.</br>  <br> I also work for Amazon, putting shit on shelves, but I don't even make $400/month what gives? </br>  <br>That's a very cute picture.<br><br>Food for my roomscape folder.</br></br></br>  <br>*$400/week not month</br>  <br>I'm glad you like it.

I just tend to rant, even with typing/text so it devolved into my blog and people replying to it. I use the spoilers to make it less out in the open. Despite that I'm sure these anons wouldn't even want my E-mail address because they either a) Don't care enough to be a confident or b) Don't want to divulge personal info or have a more intimate conversation, hence the reason anonymity is more attractive like talking to a stranger, but more personal.

I'm assuming customs won't immediately arrest anyone daring to import anything adult but the laws are vague enough and the government stupid enough that anything seems possible.</br></br>  <br>This, also have any ausfags had problems importing doujins?</br>  <br>Have the original instead</br>  <br>thanks, already got it via iqdb. shame that pixiv artists take down their pictures.</br>  <br>The only thing I can do is wait and see.</br>  Quick question. Are sample figures actually a thing? Like the ones they use on display for wonfes and such, I mean. Or is that just some Japanese dude trying to scam people out of cash?  <br>What is a prototype?</br>    <br>Yeah, I'm just wondering if they'd fall into consumer hands at any point. And if so, how one would tell it's one of the display figures from the show or if it's some shitty decal</br>  <br>Doubt it</br>  <br>2.5% conversion charge.</br>   1500 yen purchase on manda <br> 500 yen fee <br> try to buy some other shit to avoid the fee <br> suddenly see 10k yen total <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean people in YJA selling stuff that said 'display figure'? <br>It's probably a store offloading their displays. As in, a store buys a batch, puts one on display, then after all sold out, sell the displayed one.</br></br>  <br> I should spend another 3500 yen to avoid a 500 yen fee <br><br>I'll never understand why people do this.</br></br></br>  <br>Well it just makes me curious because there's three separate figures and they've all got "Sample" (in Japanese) on their leg.

Finn and Swedish characters often get the same hair treatment.<br> Cryska a cutest. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically they portray not white hair, but "dirty blonde/Русые" hair (just like portray British with yellow hair..), which is quite typical for slavs. Of course its not limited to it, and there are black, brown, redheads - whatever you want.<br><br>https://www.google.de/search?q=русы<wbr>е+волосы&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=opera&amp;h<wbr>s=HQQ&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=<wbr>hlmaVYP-IMOcsgGi3o-ICw&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AU<wbr>oAQ&amp;biw=877&amp;bih=433<br><br>Pic related, Moscow uni.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>the best</br></br>  I'd teach her about how women get pregnant.

Instead they take the beating without saying a word because it's wrong to beat a girl.

What the hell went down there?</br>  <br>Wasn't it Romania?</br>  <br>I got what you said, I was just fucking around. <br><br><br>No, the word is of Serbian origin to my knowledge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The word vampire comes from the serbian language. Romanian vampire myths are just more famous worldwide.</br>  <br>Some wench spilled orahovac all over her head, some Serb saw it and started sucking the liquor off her neck, someone saw them.<br>Poof! Instant vampire.</br></br>  <br><br>Google says the word came from Turks then went to Hungarians and then French.<br><br>Which makes sense considering the turks were fighting Vlad the Impaler.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the most brutal tyrants lived there. literally evil</br>  <br>They are really vampires.</br>  <br>Serbs in the the more remote villages are just very dramatic. <br><br>A man I'm not familiar with is walking around in the middle of the street at night? IT MUST BE OUR DEAD NEIGHBOR WHO TURNED INTO A VAMPIRE.</br></br></br>  <br>The modern witchhunts must be fun.</br>  <br><br>Eh it's debatable, but most agree that the word is of Serbian origin. At least in all the literature I've read about it. Google confirms it for me but it depends where you look. <br>I'm not really a Serb so I don't know. I just read a lot about this.</br></br></br>  <br>shes probably pretending to be pure but is actually the dirty s whore in the show.</br>  <br>Their origin is downright hilarious. <br><br>In some village a woman got pregnant after her husband died. She claimed that her dead husband came back to sleep with her a year after they buried him. Everyone believed her for some reason and there you go - a vampire myth. Women all around the village started spreading the rumor and it was considered a valid excuse if you got knocked up in the old times. Only in that village of course</br></br></br>  <br> Vlad the Implier </br>  <br>This is literally how it goes.</br>  <br>Why is real vlad so uncute?</br>  <br>What's hilarious is that in the worst shitholes they still think this way. <br><br>When I was visiting my grandma I overheard people talking about seeing a vampire in the nearby graveyard.</br></br></br>  <br>Should have asked them if its name was Arcade Bumstead.</br>  <br>It's a shitty old way of drawing just like this.<br><br>He was cute enough to be  raped </br></br></br>  <br>Because the balkan slav.</br>  <br>Sadly it was a creepy old man instead of a qt girl.

I mean she really  kinda really almost kinda punched that fucking prince to death right? </br>  <br> Don't tell me they will censor the shit out of this. <br>Have you been following the threads? It's like the studio is afraid of offending anyone or not appealing to the greatest population.

He hasn't boned any of them yet but deepened his relationship with each of them. There are many more girls outside the harem looking in like Giselle and Mabel, both apostles like Rory. </br>  <br> And yes until now Tuka calls Itami dad even though dad's found alive. </br>  <br>ex wife killed his sex drive</br>  This might not be the place for it, but Japan accepted the Giant robot 1 on 1 against America.  <br>Well rori's crazy battlelust expressions are still decent, so have faith?</br>  <br> I-I dont even.. <br>To be fair the women who made it to the top all had to be tough as nails to have gotten that far.</br></br>  <br>Eh, we'll see.<br><br>There hasn't really been any "real" combat scenes yet, so who knows, maybe they'll do a good job.</br></br></br>  <br> her combat scenes <br>Seeing how they're censoring this show, I doubt we'll have any.</br></br>  <br>That as a backward country militarily impotent to the West, they modernized to become a world power by 1905 but had their entire empire gone after the Asia-Pacific War?</br>  <br> Ehhhh that's kinda corny then.

I will never be able to get over this<br> suffered surprise attack from the not Romans <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens and figuring out that they were kidnapped <br> oh no, the citizens were turned into slaves DURAMA <br> Diet being THAT retarded <br> no mention of Japan being USA's buttbudy <br> not a single world leader stopped and thought about learning the power of traveling to other worlds, or magic or any implications of this other than MUH RESOURCES <br>I dropped it at the shitty slave reveal so I don't know if any of this is answered later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> turned her into an idol <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens <br><br>They're missing you dense fuck, if they knew where they are then they aren't missing.</br></br></br>  I don't understand why A-1 got this. The material is outside of their, how do you say it, scope?  <br>A-1 always gets popular franchises that already have an established fanbase. They don't care if they butcher it since fans are buying it anyways.</br>  <br> go missing right around the time they get attacked <br> GEE, I WONDER WHERE DID THEY GO? <br>How fucking retarded are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be pretty obvious where they went? The choices are fantasyland and best corea.</br>  <br>They deserve it too.<br>Good squad.</br></br>  <br>The thing is even though they know they might be on the other side. They don't know where exactly. There is no indication that they are slaves of royality.</br>  <br> fake battles <br>As expected from america</br></br>  <br>There was a bit in the manga IIRC where the emperor warns the Japanese diiplomats something like "there was an empire that prided itself on its military might but it crumbled and was destroyed by outsiders".<br><br>Thus misunderstanding two key points: firstly, that Japan's military isn't all that powerful, and secondly, that Japan's military empire has already collapsed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't cross off people with no confirmed bodies.  The missing Japanese people were taken on previous scouting missions even before the Gate went up. It's in the manga when Noriko was hospitalized. Her family was near the gate distributing flyers of her and her husband, her husband died in the mines, and their house is burned down after a long time of no one in there. </br></br>  <br>And NONE of the JSDF reports on this foreign culture mentioned "they take prisoners as slaves from the people they attack, we should ask them if they took any of ours"?</br>  <br>Maybe ask one of those senators they were buddying up with? Maybe actually bother to investigate, or maybe use their peanut brains to figure out that a culture that obviously practices slavery could have put their citizens in chains and thought nothing of it?<br>Slavery is obviously completely normal to them and they don't have any human rights codes.<br>That forced drama scene really pissed me off.</br></br></br>  <br> we should ask them if they took any of ours <br>They would have probably told them the truth, too.<br>We were shown that they were all surprised that the Nips got so butthurt about slavery.<br> yeah we took your people, so what? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Man i love .50</br>  <br>Those missing people were taken before the Gate went up in Ginza.

And it would not be profitable if they paid miners enough.</br></br>  <br>It's still retarded that they didn't think that some of their own people could have been turned into slaves. Then they acted all surprised and horrified that the savages were savages.<br>It's shitty writing, get fucked</br></br>  <br>And we won't be alive when it happens. I wish I could be an apostle like Rory only so I could witness the creation of the first Gundam</br>  <br> miners getting paid <br> anyone willingly going into the mines <br>You go there to suffer and die</br></br></br>  <br>It's retarded that you think a defeated medieval army would take prisoners and slaves back to their kingdom.<br>Japan didn't know scouts were around a few months before the invasion.

Doesn't help that their initial plan was to invade Kyushu using Okinawa as a staging ground, but the Japanese plan was to throw everything they had in a do or die defense of Kyushu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What is afghanistan <br><br>step it up m8</br></br></br>  <br>+1</br>  <br/>  <br> we want the Idolm@ster audience <br><br>l'm scared to see the monster girls, l bet they were all devolved into cosplay tier now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's such a dumb cunt it hurts.</br></br>  <br><br>This would be great if it wasn't shown that the bunny queen is just manipulating him to fuck up the kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Yep they even installed a pretender on the throne of another kingdom.<br>I felt that the way the jap government is acting is similar to the way they did things on the imperial era.<br>Forcing inequal treaties on everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair comparison, considering that she fought alongside Rory.</br>  <br>We get the same here in Australia over whales.

It's just Lelouch stuck in a SoL.</br>  <br>Watch the first episode. Then go to the archives for the reactions.</br>  <br>She was around when Sugawara and Pina organized that party that Zorzal crashed.</br>  <br>Aaaaah, okay.</br>   THAT    Don't show any real combat <br> instead fill in air-time by dragging out useless shit <br>Seriously.</br></br>  I want to see a crossover where Rory Mercury works with Frank Castle  I honestly don't mind some of the problematic stuff:<br><br>1. They toned down the gore. This anime is probably going to be very well received in Japan. Patriotic, cool, funny, and sexy. It should lead to some nice children viewers. And if it was supremely bloody, then they wouldn't get as brought an audience. As long as they keep some things... I can live with my violence only being implied and existing in the manga.<br><br>2. Rory being changed from a GothLoli to a GothMagical Girl. Its sad that they did this, but understandable. Loli are getting alot of attention these days. And aging Rory up physically a little, changing her from a typical loli to more a Sailor Scout bodytype doesn't make me too mad. She is still an Eternal Loli.<br><br>3. The combat. Its only the first episode, they need to establish the characterization more. Big combat scenes like the mercenary army attacking the city and the Cobras roaring in with the Ride of the Valkyries blaring will satisfy everyone.<br><br>I am content and enjoyed the first episode. I just hope it gets even better as it goes along.<br><br>Kinda sad they made military chesty strong girl have a weird hairstyle though. She better be wearing her helmet more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does this face convey?<br><br><br>The direction is terrible, no helping it.</br></br></br>  <br> His smile, His Optimism, gone <br>He's anguished due to the fact that he never got his mangoos</br></br>  <br> and even if they tried the Americans would stop them. <br>Except that they can't. They will need an excuse to go through the gate and "We are preventing the japanese to retaliate against the guys who attacked them first and killed a lot of their own civilians" isn't good enough.</br></br>  <br> What does this face convey? <br>The heart-crushing despair of never getting a hold of delicious doujinshi of his waifu.<br><br>Also, I don't know how I feel knowing the fact that I'd have to call him "sir" if I ever met the guy.</br></br></br></br>  I bet A-1 didn't want to show any Nips dying. I think that we'll see a bunch of the empire dying,  <br>The coke and burgers would actually work pretty well given that the human body is essentially designed to get addicted to high fat and sugary foods. They can prettymuch swindle the entire OC world without firing a single shot.<br><br><br>You sir are an idiot. Do you seriously think an army mostly made up of minorities(like black people for example) is not going to fuck shit up the second they see a captured citizen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The japanese got attacked, America would come in for a joint operation no questions asked.</br>  <br>The wyverns and orcs were censored, too.</br>  <br>Unless it's a foreign country, it ain't happening.<br><br>The gate wasn't exactly foreign, more like alien.</br></br></br>  <br>America surely gets involved, right? We came in and saved japs when they got tsunami'd hard and when their reactor when to shit.</br>  <br>Those were natural disasters you fucktard. No way the japs are going into an unknown world without America.</br>  <br>Well, modern Japan hasn't.<br>Then again I guess that was the point of Patlabor 2. To what extent can a country benefiting from the warfare of others truly claim to be peaceful?</br></br>  <br>A lack of respect for tone. Dozens if not hundreds of civilians where murdered and at a ceremony dedicated to the event he's literally in tears because he couldn't buy some porn. The author or the director really dropped the ball on this one.</br>  <br> he's literally in tears because he couldn't buy some porn <br>Crying over every single dead body won't bring back all the potential faps he could have otherwise shared with others on the Internet.</br></br>  <br>You should have lack of respect for Itami then. <br><br>His reason for saving all those people was because he wanted to go buy some porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Why in the fuck would America NOT be involved in this?</br>  <br>That is the most realistic reaction though. Do you remember how japanese react when two guys got beheaded by ISIS?</br>  <br>Busy with Middle East. Their attempt to get involved was fucked up by china and russia.</br>  <br><br>Mostly because Japan is saying No and they aren't going to invade another sovereign nation when China and Russia would join in if they did. All for control of the Gate and an entire world of untapped natural resources.<br><br>All Japan would have to do would be to blow up the Gate and the war would be pointless and over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan wouldn't like a foreign army to go through their capital. That's tantamount to them sucking dick.</br>  <br>Japan wouldn't even care if it got embargoed at that point. What with the Gate they have all the resources and land they need to expand and cultivate and thrive.<br><br>With Japan holding the threat of just destroying the Gate and turning the world back to the way it was before, no other nation would risk losing being able to profit from the Gate in exchange for Japan being the sole manager of the Gate.<br><br>It would mean Japan would become the number one source of oil, food, wealth, and everything in the world and rock the balance of it completely.<br><br>Some countries might try to blow up the Gate, especially the middle east, because of the oil though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Japan could just Mass Immigrate, say fuck you to the rest of the doomed and dying planet that is earth, and close the Gate behind them and settle in this new world.</br></br>  <br>Middle East don't care about Japan. All they wanted was their own land just with fucked up laws. <br><br>US put a stop to that so they turned their sights to Europe and Southeast Asia.</br></br></br>  <br>Middle East nations like Saudi Arabia would be pissed as fuck if oil more abundant and cheaper then theirs started to flow out of Japan. It would crash their country's economy completely. All those Oil Sheiks would lose their livelihood and get rather pissed off.</br>  <br>Oil sheiks aren't Islamic extremists. But yes they'll be pissed off.</br>  <br>Things like economic ruin and shit like that easily can turn mild mannered people into pissed off extremists who will go to war or take a route as simple as blowing up the gate to maintain their cash flow.</br>  <br> Oil sheiks aren't Islamic extremists. <br>Depends on your definition of "extremists".</br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Ranger Course, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the Empire, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top recon scout in the entire JSDF. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before beyond the Gate, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me in this Senate? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my Airborne division stationed at Alnus Hill and your position is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Japan Self-Defence Force and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>I can only imagine all the diseases they would unintentionally bring with them would end up wiping most of the people out on the other side of the gate.<br><br>Then given several generations, the few aboriginal groups remaining would be rallied into isolated areas to be managed, like the Native Americans.<br><br>Basically, Japan would most likely have a whole planet (at best) or a whole other continent (at worst) all to themselves.<br><br>Having the only access to magic, they could very well come back to our world in the future and then go Rape of Nanking on everyone's ass. Fuck nukes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan better learn magic then.</br>  <br>Really? It was pretty obvious.</br>  <br>And as if that wasn't ridiculous enough, he's in the Special Forces.<br><br>That makes me wonder actually. Is he just on loan to the regular ground forces branch of the JSDF? Since they don't say he "was" SF, but that he "is" SF-</br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe after learning magic they'll return to being docile, make Article 9 for the Gate, and make gundams instead.</br>  <br>China and Russia could pressure for an intervention in the UN with "Japanees aggression" as their basis.</br>  <br> make gundams instead. <br> not making mass-produced mahou shoujo armies <br>Mahou shoujo are nothing to fuck with, anon, especially when they come in large numbers.</br></br></br>  <br>There would also be plenty of diseases the Gate people have that would get pretty bad. The knowledge of all the STDs i'd get from fucking Gate bitches is probably the only thing that would stop em from taking em all back for orgies.<br>Plus I'm remembering how when the Americas were first discovered syphilis(i think) exploded. This is much worse than it sounds since long term effects basically make you look like a zombie complete with rotting body parts.</br></br>  <br>I'm considering dropping this now, thanks.</br>  <br>And America would just veto them, because America isn't going to side with Russia over Japan.</br>  <br>Or America would veto them and declare they'll do it themselves since keeping Japan in check has been America's responsibility for a while.</br>  <br> yfw japan creates gundams in the next 15 years. </br>  WTF happened to Japanese anime? All I see these days is censoring of the key elements that made anime great. Sex and violence. It's like the SJW's have taken over.  Just watched the first episode. Jesus Christ, that MC is an unlikable asshole.<br><br> dozens of people dying all around you <br> muh convention <br><br> humanity gets access to a new world with sentient beings <br> muh convention again <br><br>I mean, things could get better, but with what seems to be censorship and the harem-esque feeling from how they showed the girls, this certainly is not a good start for a show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>New law on the verge of passing.</br></br>  <br> It's like the SJW's have taken over. <br> Japan <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's important to remember that when the Europeans first started coming to the Americas on a larger scale for trade and what-not, they brought with them all their diseases, along with their technologies and weapons and other goods. Smallpox is one of the more notable diseases which eradicated a large portion of the native populations and made settlement of the Americas by Europeans easier than it otherwise could have been.<br><br>This thinking could also be applied if the Japanese were to start colonizing the other side of the Gate, and while the soldiers there would be afflicted with the natural diseases on their side, the advances in biochemical research would probably reduce the chances of their people dying.<br><br>How well magic works in eradicating diseases like smallpox and other diseases like it, no one knows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bait or retarded?</br>  So the future of anime is cute girls doing cute things FOREVER!  <br>Wrong show bruv.</br>  <br> I was really amazed how many Americans made dark jokes about Tsunamis and Earthquakes on the internet just because that's what humans do on the fucking internet. These are the sorts of individuals that need to be purged. <br><br>Why the hell are you even here? Shouldn't you be sucking your thumb in a crib somewhere?</br></br></br>  <br>I know. I'm saying it works the other way around too.<br>The example I posted was of what was happening in Italy with what amounted to corpses wlaking the streets as a normal sight. A new world disease came back to Europe and spread everywhere. Of course thanks to the basic medical knowledge we have nowadays it wont be so bad but not watching out for magical ebola would be stupid as hell.</br></br>  <br>Then you shouldn't have attacked and killed thousands of Japanese civilians stupid Roman cunt<br>Oh wait, let me guess. You're one of those people who think chink lives are worthless and white men lives are worth gold.</br></br>  <br> literally extorting and pillaging the land for natural resources <br>That's what any modern country would do. Even Sri Lanka and East Timor.</br></br>  <br>Whichever you prefer.</br>  Obsolete and retired Type 74s? God damn it A-1. Hell, even the manga have Type 99s. <br><br>Still looking forward to the empire getting an arse kicking next episode.</br></br>   Even BDs can't save this censorship <br><br>Oh well.</br></br>  <br>You kidding right?</br>  pardon my ignorance but i cant find fucking Episode 1 for some forsaken reason. Anyone mind spoon feeding my stupid ass?  <br>just search "GATE" on nyaatorrents</br>  <br>I wish.</br>  <br>Are you an idiot?<br><br>And? You act like this was some grand ehtical statement of opinion. I was stating a simple fact. The Japanese are not benevolent at all.<br><br>If you want to continue this apparent argument at least certain nations wouldn't pretend it's something other than that or would try to give them a better deal.(Probably not out of the goodness of their hearts but simply because they know there's going to be competition) An oppressed populace like Japan is going for is worse for profit than an educated one. Leaving the Romans as primitive savages yields less profit over time when they could be transformed into a productive workforce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure it's 74? Cos I thought 74 sports a sloped armor and I see none. <br>It does not look like 10 or 99 either.<br>Maybe a mobile artillery?</br></br></br>  <br>are we sure that's the same character?</br>  <br> you will never jump out of a C-130 with a siren in the US of A. <br>Never ever</br></br>  <br> You sure it's 74?

What ive seen so far seems to indicate they are animating her flat  So anon, is this worth a read?<br>Apparently its not done, is it nearing completion?</br>  <br>No, you're a fucking retard and all your posts in this thread have equally been retarded. And you still have no idea what pretentious means.</br>  <br> Naruto was good untill Chunnin exam <br>Compared to what? Vagabond? It has always been shit then.<br><br> Vinland was good untill farm arc <br>Yes. During the farm arc it became great.<br><br> Mountain MC is awesome <br>He's okay. But I must say that the ending is a perfect example of an asspull.  Ironically enough I'd even say that some imagery in the manga were pretentious. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i admit. first time seeing a live meltdown. stop being triggered. your reactions only breeds more bait.</br>  <br>1.<br>Compared to manga in general. It taught children world wide about friendship, about the horrors of child soldiers, the consequences of playing ninja and it had a good variety of characters. So even if you disliked the MC, there´s always the edge guy, or the smart guy or whatever floats your boat. It just drove it´s great concept to the ground by beating it´s morale like a dead horse until the horse have turned into soil. Don´t be a hipster, it was a good manga before Chunnin exam.<br><br>2. <br>Nope, it turned a chance to become great and descended into mediocrity. No, it became even worse the mediocre. Since the potential it had was matched very rarely. Is tragic, but hey, got to pander to your mainstream audience, you don´t get paid for being original. <br><br>3.<br>Well written character development. Is rare, so whenever I see it, I need to commend it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but hey, got to pander to your mainstream audience, you don´t get paid for being original <br>Mainstream audience always wanted it to be vikings doing viking things.</br></br>  Shiki is pretty damn awesome.  I'm still a hipster who thinks the novels were better. Ufotable did a great job, but they made the characters seem too robotic.  SHIKI &gt; Shiki &gt; Shiki &gt; SHIKI  Shiki is Nasu's true waifu  <br><br>The fifth film was a masterpiece, but the other parts were average at best, especially compared to the books.</br></br>  <br>i liked that epilogue but man was it a trip</br>  <br>I liked the third movie<br>also fujino is so moe</br></br>  <br>He is a man of good taste. <br><br><br>That I do agree with. Ufotable is not good with directing normal interactions. They seem plain awkward sometimes, even in UBW. They're especially bad at humor.</br></br></br></br>  I'd give my life to see Nanaya/Ryougi hatesex.  <br>Third movie a best. The only one where Shiki had that wide range of expressions.</br>  She's my favorite Type Moon character. I like her minimal bullshit personality.  <br><br>The first movie is still my favourite. 5th executed its concept well but there were certainly dull bits that stood out, but the first was incredible all the way through, the scenery porn was 10/10.</br></br>  <br>Her character stands out more in the novels. In the movies she seems too empty and sometimes you can't even tell what the fuck the conflict is supposed to be about.</br>  <br> origin is nothingness <br> seems empty <br>Gee, I wonder why</br></br></br>  The problem with the KnK movies/novels is that you can't experience them to the fullest if you aren't familiar with the Nasuverse. Once you get to know your shit it really is amazing.  <br>In my opinion;<br>7&gt;5&gt;8&gt;2&gt;4=1&gt;3&gt;6<br>I don't know if I'd call any of it just "average" I'd like to imagine that even the worst film (Oblivion Recording 6) I'd be comfortable calling it slightly above average.<br><br>I hated the films on my first watch, besides a few of the philosophical lines actually connecting with me, but once I finished 7 I knew I had to rewatch all of them with a more positive outlook instead of wanting to hate it because I don't like Fate/shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I meant empty as in barely a character. In the novels she felt better written. You got an explanation for the things she felt and thought.</br>  <br>As much as she herself claims to be abnormal, she is the most reasonable character in Nasuverse.<br>And character with most fulfilled, normal life too.</br></br>    <br>For me it's <br>7&gt;3=5&gt;4&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6<br><br><br>I feel the same, only about Fujino.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to get that. NOW.<br>Maybe even before that 2000$ prize figure. <br>WHY GOD WHY</br></br></br>  Milf ryougi was pretty nice  <br>Yeah, I agree. Mikiya's and Shiki's relationship may seem the most boring but it's actually the best and most functional out of all the romance Nasu has written.</br>  <br>Is this a new figure?<br>I'm surprised they're still making new Ryougis this long after the movies aired. I didn't think they were that popular still.</br></br>  <br><br>I thought they were okay the first time I saw them, but I recently rewatched the series and most parts really struggled at getting the message across and the pacing was all over the place. I hated the sixth movie the most for completely raping the plot of the novel.</br></br>  What was the post time jump 2nd half of the 8th movie intended to convey? I liked it as a comfy see the future story but I can't help but feel I missed some things.  <br>Nothing about the novels were well-written, anon. They're about the equivalent to highschool-level language and absolutely plagued with telling instead of showing.<br><br>Having Nasu write long paragraphs explaining Ryougi's character, thoughts and feelings in excruciating detail doesn't make her a well-written character. Ufo did a good job of showing you Ryougi's character rather than telling you.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but what would you say is the best thing Nasu wrote?</br>  <br>DDD</br>  <br>Yeah, it's new. <br>It's release date is next March, you can order it from a few of the official Aniplex+ retailers or have it forwarded to you from a proxy service in Japan.<br><br><br>Like I said, I was the complete opposite.<br>I have the PDFs of all the novels, I wish they were available physically in English.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the biggest point. Actually showing how SHIKI's (the one that was gone) dream was still fulfilled. <br>And a couple of more "muh deep" thoughts about fate, future and stuff.<br>Also, Mana.</br></br></br>  <br>The Fifth's movie in general is pretty damn awesome.<br><br>Tomoe Enjou was fucking great. Never liked a plot-established mediocre character so much before.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's hipster</br>  <br>How many people on /a/ have even read DDD?</br>  <br>Tomoe is shirou done right</br>  <br>Best in terms of writing style, literary criticism, etc. or best in terms of content?<br><br>DDD is probably Nasu's writing at its best, even though he shat the bed in the later bits. I like KnK the most, personally, but the actual prose in it is fucking atrocious, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Make a thread and see how hard it will bomb.</br>  <br>A few more scenes of Mana and mom Shiki interacting to see what that relationship was like would have been great. <br><br>Oh well like someone said above this series really seems like it would be a worthy thing to rewatch.</br></br></br>  Where can I read the novels? I watched the movies and I want to know the difference between the two.  <br>No, Shirou is Shirou done right.<br><br>Tomoe Enjou is boring parts of Shirou done excellently.</br></br></br>  <br>You have cokesakto's translation. It's not the best, though.</br>  <br>There are interesting parts about Shirou?</br>  <br>Probably owed to the fact that she's a complete mary sue.</br>  <br> Shirou is Shirou done right. <br>To anyone that has such low standards for what is a well written character, maybe?</br></br>  Could Ryougi beat Shirou?  <br>I appreciated the extent to which his gimmick was played out and how he slowly realized how mentally ill he was.</br>  <br>He's more interesting than your regular self-insert MC protag, but I think people blow the quality of his characterization out of proportion.</br>  What is your origin /a/?  <br>Shirou isn't mentally ill, he's scarred and traumatized and spends most of the VN being in denial about it. Don't confuse mental illness with emotional trauma.</br>  <br>Anime</br>  <br> I was here... <br><br> ;_;  </br></br></br>  <br>The concept of Shirou's character is good, the execution is fucking awful. Then again, many good ideas in Fate are badly executed.</br>  <br><br>What subs should I use?</br></br>  <br>Semen</br>  <br>That was always my problem with Nasu. Some of his ideas are fantastic, but he's so bad at executing them.</br>  <br>What made it all worse was going into the eroge business. Sometimes you can see he wants to write things differently, but can't because he has expectations to meet and an audience to pander to. <br><br>I'm not saying he dislikes the fact that he wrote eroge, but you can tell it limited his artistic freedom.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I just finished the last movie in the series tonight and my opinion differs a lot from yours<br><br>For me it goes:<br>5&gt;4=2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1 &gt;3&gt;7&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;6 <br><br>The start of 7 was pretty good I think but it declined when the twist was revealed. 6 was really terrible and I hate azaka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His world building is very convoluted. I think that's the result of him constantly introducing rules and then right after that exceptions to those same rules.</br>  <br>They butchered the plot of the 6th movie. It's pretty different in the novels.<br>I hate Azaka too. Everyone being after Mikiya's dick was completely unnecessary in KnK. In most cases it served absolutely no fucking purpose because he was completely devoted to Shiki.</br></br>  I watched all of the movies and have no idea what Shiki is like as a character and what drives her or what her goal is. How can this be?  <br>He's proto Tohno. <br><br>Tohno ended up being a strange mix of Mikiya and Ryougi. Almost like their child</br></br></br>  <br>Mikiya and Tohno even looked alike before. Not anymore.</br>  <br>Laziness</br>  What did you think of LWA 2?  I was a little worried because it started a bit slow with all the introductions, but I ended up liking it as much as if not a little more than the first one in the end. Animation quality was superb. <br><br>I actually just showed my nine-year old cousin the first episode this morning and he really enjoyed it despite there only being subtitles. I was pleasantly surprised.</br></br>  I liked it more than the first, It was fucking cute. Like shit this was good.  managed to give me that same magical experience as the original, sat grinning through the whole thing. Bout to open a case and watch it again. Akko's grunts and (genki inhales?) was a really cute scene. Also liked how shiny rod took a back seat, and I was actually suprised when it came back as Shiny Ballista, was expecting the Luna Lana and the power of friendship to save the day.  Truly amazing, so amazing it made me feel like the scummiest douche for pirating it.  It did have a slow start and at first I wasn't expecting it to meet my sky-high expectations going in, but I'd say I liked it more than the first. I had a stupid grin on my face for the entire third act.<br><br>My only worry is how the franchise could translate to a series, if Trigger decides to go that route.</br></br>  So what flower is her hair based on?  Honestly, I've either become a hard cunt over the years, or I went in with the wrong mentality, because I left thinking "either the first one was better or LWA has lost its magic on me".  <br> &gt;rape<br>seed</br> </br>  <br>Don't know, but I really do pity you.</br>  <br>Bellflower.</br>  <br>It's not rape if she's on top anon.</br>  Amazing. Would buy merchandise.  <br>Yes! You rock.<br><br>Botany knowledge obtained.</br></br></br>  It was cute! CUTE!  How would one, hypothetically, go about giving Yoshinari a sloppy blow job and bask in the glory of his semen? Hypothetically how would one do that?  It was great, but some scenes were a bit slide-showy, like they couldn't be bothered to do in betweens.  Could be better animated. Decent overall, but could not watch it to end stopping halfway, something about it just not appealing and generic making me yawn.<br><br>Maybe i unconciously compare it to Pratchett books, find it not fun, and feel disappointed.</br></br>  I'm out of the loop.<br>Was this backed by kickstarter as well? Did I miss out on the chance to get amazing yoshinari art again?</br>  Did anyone feel like the construction worker guy didn't match the other character designs?   school issued rec polo's and shorts   Nah.<br>They tried to make it same as first one, but failed. Repeated joke is no longer joke. .. something like that.</br>  <br>It was cute, and inspiring. Was smiling like an idiot and tearing up through the entire thing.<br><br>I've always had an affinity for witches, wizards, and magic type stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>The first half an hour or so was weak, at least in comparison to the first LWA, but the entire parade sequence was 10/10<br><br>Overall the slow start was disappointing but it was still amazing and even the slow parts were more fun to to watch than the average TV anime because of the colorful cast of characters. I'm glad that I put money towards it</br></br></br>  <br>he and the mayor felt very /co/ ...those beady cold eyes</br>  Amazing.<br><br><br>Yes, but kickstarter wasn't the place they got money from. They already had funding but kickstarter gave them enough to make it almost an hour long.</br></br></br>  <br>Woops, I meant kickstarter wasn't the ONLY place they got money from.</br>  Trigger still got that magic. Hope I get a good genga with the BD.  <br>The mayor felt a little weird to me too, but unlike the construction worker, the mayor fit the style the more I looked at him.</br>  <br><br>What the fuck are you even on about, nigger.</br></br>  I was one of the people that put down $300 in the Kickstarter, and I think it was well worth the money. Generally amazing animation (especially the parade scene), all characters old and new likeable on some level (except for the bratty boys, but I'm sure that was the intention), and overall a very pleasant watch for me.  <br>I mean. Nothing really changed.<br>Akko is still idealistic.<br>Diana is still a bitch.<br>Sensei still helping from the shadows.<br>Power of friendship still wins.<br>Etc..<br><br>I would like to see characters learn from their mistakes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in that same vein all the uniforms were great.<br>cloaks<br>hoods<br>Shiny Chariot garb<br>branded shorts<br>sweatpants<br>polos<br>tshirt/pajamas<br><br>just another thing to appreciate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was really enjoyable. Definitely worth the wait  BD rip when?  <br>Are you sure you just don't want to admit you spent 300$ on something average, that doesn't bring anything new?</br>  <br>Nope, I'm honestly happy with it.</br>  It was pretty cool. I didn't think that the new 3 girls, especially Amanda who I thought was going to be a total bitch when she was first introduced, were going to be so agreeable with Akko and her plan. Hope they make a 3rd part eventually, whether it's Kickstarted or they get the money themselves.  Enchanted Parade - 01<br>Am I retarded that I thought there will be episode 2?</br>  <br> Akko is still idealistic. <br>Nothing really happened in LW1 that would make it absolutely necessary for Akko to stop being idealistic. That DID happen in LW2, so you can go ahead and make that argument if and when LW3 or the series(as long as it takes place after LW2) comes out and if Akko is still as bad as she was in LW2.<br><br> Diana is still a bitch. <br>Diana really isn't a bitch. She's more of a realistic person who isn't too great at showing sympathy. And again, nothing happened in the original that would make it absolutely necessary for her to stop acting so cold.<br><br>Anyway. Characters don't need to pull a full 180 at every point in the series to continue to be interesting. <br><br>They continue to act a certain way because that's their personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First LWA didn't bring "anything new" either, and people were trowing money at Trigger expecting to get exactly the same experience. And they obviously get it.</br>  <br>Delinquent witch thief is something I can get behind either way.<br><br><br>I remember reading somewhere that if the second OVA got a good reception they would consider a full series. It's always possible, anon.<br>Afterall,  believing is magic! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Diana is still a bitch. <br><br>Of all the things you mentioned this is the only one that actually bothers me.<br><br>They played it safe and placed their efforts on other aspects, the plot was certainly different and entertaining for whole new reasons, I especially enjoyed the way they got the citizen to join the story. Also the new characters were really cool.<br><br>Your criticism is very half-assed if I may say so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was kind of underwhelmed.<br><br>I mean, it was super cute at times, but god damn did it feel generic as hell compared to the first. It felt like I was watching a mediocre episode in a good series. It was completely predictable, the city felt lifeless, silent, and populated by maybe 20 people, I don't know why they even bothered introducing the stupid mayor character or why Diana was even in this movie. Nothing seemed to really flow, everything felt forced from the inner-girl drama to the bully kids. Not to mention how utterly lame the final "fight" was, if you could call it that.<br><br>And maybe I can blame it on really shitty subtitles, but fuck, the writing fell flat for me. Especially Diana's last line.<br><br>I fucking loved the first one. I need to rewatchit and see if I'm just blinded by nostalgia for something I watched a year ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>see<br><br>This anon said it properly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And maybe I can blame it on really shitty subtitles <br>They were funi-tier at least, so...</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Eh. I like liking things.<br><br>None of these criticisms really change the way I look at LW2.</br></br></br>  <br>I was kinda worried for the first half but the second half delivered. Really liked how they put focus on Lotte. Hope Diana gets to do more though except the occasional observations and "minor" assistance.</br>  <br> it feel generic as hell compared to the first <br> It was completely predictable <br>And how exactly is this second one not as generic and predictable as the first? The first wasn't exactly outstanding in both of those regards.<br><br>I liked both because they were refreshing in the sense that this type of anime is rare nowadays and it was simply fun. I actually liked the final fight too. I was excepting a Akko gets her staff, powers up and does everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, I like liking things too. I didn't go into a sequel to something I loved just to not like it.<br><br><br>As you said, the first was refreshing since this type of anime is rare nowadays. And now that we have a sequel to expand on that universe, they didn't do much except offer us a completely limp city that's supposed to be particularly cruel to witches, except no one but five punk kids seem to care. The second one upped the genericness with run-of-the-mill friend-drama that's so incredibly common in children's cartoons over something that felt incredibly forced. <br><br>There wasn't even a final fight. The big bad mega-witch golem got up, put its armor on, and then stood there doing nothing until the power of friendship put him to sleep. At the very least, I remember Akko having to like, run and dodge things in the first short like there was actually an action scene going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AOTS<br>Sucy is still the best</br></br>  <br>I think you have some decent points but in my eyes the good outweighs them by far.</br>  You know who's gay in this anime.<br>(Almost everyone except the males in case you're a bit slow.)</br>  <br>At the very least, it gave us some nice webms.</br>  <br>Well i like to think of the final fight as the previous accumulation of events with the whole spirit things and what not too.</br>  <br>Akko x Lotte makes much more sense</br>  <br>Then sucy x who?<br>Remember, Akko is her guinea pig.</br></br>  <br> the city felt lifeless, silent, <br><br>I can't help but agree with this. In addition to some panning over stills, there just didn't seem to me as much love poured into crafting the world outside the school, almost phoned in. I'm comparing this to Majokko Shimai no Yoyo to Nene, which by contrast had a lovingly created city, that really did feel vibrant and vivacious.<br><br>I'm essentially complaining that it "wasn't 10/10 enough" but it did have a lot to live up to. The parade itself brought back the magic, no doubt.</br></br></br></br></br>  Amazing animated, visually stunning, but they should have cared a bit more for the background human characters.<br>I didn't like the design of the German girl nor how the Slav one talked.<br>The story was basically a precure episode, everyone happy everyone ok, nothing say about that but it confirms my idea that Trigger shouldn't be originals, they are much better at adapting stuff.<br>My only real problem is that  and the German girl were presented as serious evil doers (thief, someone who sell technology) and yet they never did something bad or even shown those traits, they were nice girls. I get their young girls, everyone is friendly and happy, but shit, at least make them act like cunts for 5 minutes, show me they are bad, don't just tell me they are.</br></br></br>   here<br>Oh, and the first one was better.</br>  <br>Just because she stole something doesn't make her bad. Akko causes plenty of trouble but she isn't bad. I think the point was that they aren't bad just because they do things like that.</br>  I think they are fine animations but I really don't get the hype at all. I really can't get that excited over small episodes like this. If they made a full season or an actual feature length movie I'd care more.  The first one was better because it was new and fresh, but LWA 2 was still worth watching just for the animation alone. <br><br>Sadly if KlK and LWA are any indicator, Trigger can't seem to write a non-mediocre plot, but at least the characters are good.</br></br>  <br>It was basically a feature-length movie.</br>  <br>Being a thief is a serious crime, it's different from what Akko was doing. But in hindsight it was my fault, I should have realized they weren't serious when they put the Slav girl together with the other two when her crime was simply stealing food and it was shown in a comedy way.<br><br><br>I've been saying this from the first LWA, I honestly don't see what people see in this that made them throw money at a kickstarter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sucy x mushrooms, duh</br>  <br> Kill la Kill reference <br> TTGL reference <br>It made my day. LWA2&gt;LWA</br></br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill reference <br>where?</br></br>  <br>Thoroughly enjoyed it.<br>The animation wasn't as good as the first movie, but everything else about it was everything I could have hoped for honestly. <br><br>Trigger said they may or may not do a full blown series of LWA. That shit would be so dope, so I hope they do. <br>They'd be saving anime for the third time in the last 2 years.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like Sucy's dance, it makes me think of a 1930s Disney short</br>  <br>mako light and gamagoori</br>  <br>you're reaching.</br>  <br>Both are almost in the same scene. The thing holding the shiny rod is Ryuuko's scissor. And tech girl uses her magic like a drill on the parade the same way Simon uses his to activate lagan</br>  <br>I can't help but feel like LWA quality will suffer in show format.</br>  <br>Of course it will, they wouldn't have the time and money, not to say with 13 episodes there would be a plot and Trigger are bad at that.</br>  <br>It was pretty good. Healthy-chan was best girl.</br>  <br>I still want them to prove that they can do a full length show and keep it together for the whole thing.</br>  <br> I would like to see characters learn from their mistakes <br>But they did do that.<br>Akko almost fucked up her friendships by being too over-zealous about something ultimately unnecesasary. however good-spirited.<br>By the end, she learned to treat her friends and their feelings with better care, and that it takes a lot more strength to face the dangers that they face than she could ever face on her own. <br><br>Being Idealistic is not a fault, and if you really think that, then i feel sorry for you.<br><br>And Diana is arguable the best and most developed character in this show. <br>In the first movie she unleashed a massive dragon, but immediately after she realized her mistake she went out of her way to try and fix it, even when she needed help from others.<br>Just because she holds herself and others to a Noble standard doesn't make her a bitch. She's capable, she's a prodigy, she obviously studies and works hard and is very responsible. She's really 1 of the only 3 people in this show I'd want as a waifu. (Sucy and Sensei are the other two)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have more OVA or movies. KLK was fun but awful in my opinion. Had to force myself to watch each episode.</br>  <br> , she learned to treat her friends and their feelings with better care <br>No. She didn't learn anything. Its Sucy and the other one who forgave her. Akko just went on doing everything alone.<br><br> And Diana is arguable the best and most developed character in this show.  <br>Maybe. But the show doesn't show it. Also, like the other anon said, she didn't even have to be in this episode. She was there just to be bitch to Akko.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does Diana still hate Akko though?</br>  <br> No. She didn't learn anything. Its Sucy and the other one who forgave her. Akko just went on doing everything alone. <br><br>Were you even watching? She had to do everything on her own because they were not there, she learned that she was being selfish. And her friends were able to accept her faults as well. They already knew she was sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>She wishes Akko was more consistent in being competent. She doesn't hate her, she just wants her to do better and not fuck around with magic as much as she usually does.</br>  <br>From what I watched she dislikes Akko for being magic secondary(like magic shows) and not being a Noble.</br>  <br>That's just her tsundere personality confusing you. She likes Akko, but she's harsh because she wants her to be a little bit more mature.</br>  <br>The first one was much better. Also wanted to punch Akko for most of the OVA.</br>  <br> wanted to punch Akko <br>This is another reason why I wouldn't watch a tv anime of LWA, I couldn't stand her for 13 episodes.</br></br>  <br><br>Rather flat.</br></br>  <br>Worse than I was expecting, glad it was on nyaa as soon as it was distributed.</br>  It was great!  Stumbled upon the first awhile ago, found out this one came out today from /co/ and so I decided to watch it.<br><br>I mean I don't really like anime movies or ovas or whatever but this one was nice. Lotte drama felt completely forced. Extra minor characters were fun but unneeded. The giant was not threatening at all considering all he did was shoot black magic lasers that did fuck all. The first half didn't flow very well because it was just a bunch of plot set-ups. We don't really see the characters grow out of what was set in the first LWA.<br><br>It was fun though. Like it was basically a cape movie to me in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  I want to cum inside Sucy.  <br> Lotte drama felt completely forced. <br>Don't worry about that stuff, the whole thing is a pisstake anyway.</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Sushi.</br>  <br>Well, obviously that comes first.</br>  <br>But it wasn't funny.</br>  <br><br>I hate Trigger now. I hope each member of the team dies in a painful accident.</br></br>  I enjoyed it so much that I had some flashbacks to my childhood and got minor ptsd realizing how innocent and not fucked up i was back then.  <br> You will never be Sucy's guinea pig </br>  <br>This makes me very sad. But what if I was someone else this would make me definitely be her guinea pig. All I have to do is transcend existence and put myself into another reality! That's it!</br>   01 <br>Wait this is a series now? And please tell me someone is subbing this other than HorribleSubs.</br>  <br> horriblesubs <br> subbing <br>Newfag detected</br></br></br>  <br> Implying she hasn't realized her own selfishness in this ova and as a result will become more bearable. </br>  <br>Just because they steal it from Crunchy doesn't mean they don't sub it. :^)</br>  <br>Feature length should be more around 90 minutes</br>    <br>A "feature" is basically anything over 45m.</br>  <br>If they don't rip from crunchy/funi then why does it have the Funimation into at the start?</br>  <br>It was good, but it felt a little stretched out, and compared to the first episode, the final boss was lame</br>  <br>We both know she won't.</br>  Is there going to be an English dub? I wonder if they will get British voice actors.  <br>The subs are hardcoded from Trigger, newshit.</br>  <br><br> Hating Trigger now for this <br><br><br> Not hating them for KLK or Ninja Slayer </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please no.</br>  <br>Nah, tv series commonly have hour long episodes.</br>  <br>retard</br>  <br>The term is not mutually exclusive.</br>  <br>Why don't they make mushroom sushi?</br>  I actually liked the first half, did quite a good job of establishing where the girls are and the new characters.<br><br>I laughed quite a bit when Mildred Hubble, I mean Akko smashed Maud, I mean Lotte in the face. <br><br>(Seriously though, this IP is incredibly close to plagiarism with The Worst Witch, the characters are essentially lifted 1:1 with the exact same personality traits and everything)</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do. That's why Sushi and mushrooms go together so well.</br>  <br><br>Only a cheap nigger would call a 45 minute thing a feature length film.</br></br>  <br>I think I'll trust academy award commities over a butthurt retard on an anonymous website</br>  <br>Which of course has nothing to do with its definition.</br>  It was fantastic. Regained my trust in Trigger, haven't had this much fun with anime in a long while.  That feel when you watched it and noticed your name in the credits.<br><br>Maximum overweeb - mainly because I was watching with my GF and she pointed it out.<br><br>It was also really great. I hope they do a 3rd one if it keeps the same amount of quality.</br></br></br></br>  <br> incredibly close to plagiarism with The Worst Witch <br>nigga what</br></br>  <br><br>" the Screen Actors Guild states that it is 80 minutes or longer."<br>There you have it in black and white.

I just got my bonus at work and had the income and I figured "Hey I got a bunch of income, I am in a comfortable living situation with no debt... so why not." and decided to throw down over the period of a month $300 (not all at once)<br><br>Totally worth it honestly because I wanted to help trigger get this shit made.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't notice any /a/'s there or anything PSG related. I thought one of you fags did put PSG2WHEN or something like that</br>  <br>There is sup /a/ name there from Collin.</br>  this was so pleasant to watch  when did it come out? i thought it was gonna come out sometime in october. ive been living under a rock  <br>You missed the 3400 post sticky during the weekend? A pity.</br>  Not sure if any of the Trigger room at AX was posted yet. I only took a couple shots.  <br>Damn, that looks pretty cool.</br>    <br>shieet, so it came out on on saturday? that sucks, theres always the future lewd artwork to look forward to at least.</br>  <br>Chariot is their current Sensei, right?</br>  <br>Not sure why that turned out so small</br>  <br>If you wanted to take a quick browse through, here: https://archive.moe/a/thread/127557<wbr>765</wbr></br>  Sequel needs more moms. Pic related.<br><br>Also needs Diana fulfilling her inner fangirl dream and wielding the Shiny Rod together with Akko<br><br>As for LWA2, I hope they polish up the animation a bit for the BD release. The start was pretty slow since it lacked the showstopper opening LWA1 had.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't remember that girl from either LWAs.</br>  I had a blast watching it, so entertaining as fuck.  <br><br>Concept art for Sucy's Mom.</br></br>  <br>aww ye, now i can spend all night browsing to pretend i was a part of this. thnks anon</br>  I wonder what price they are going to put on the packages. There's still possible import taxes to be paid.  <br>Oh god absolutely delicious.</br>  Here is the real question - do you think they will make a 3rd OVA/full movie and will it need to be kickstarted again - or do they know their western audience will buy/invest into it when it comes out due to previous Kickstarter to know its safe to bankroll.  fat chan a worst, what a shitty one and a half note character.  I was grinning like an idiot every second from the start of the parade, it warmed me to the cockles of my heart  Anyone know what happened in their panel at Anime Expo?  Just watched it. That joyful, tingly sensation is still lingering in my tummy. This was everything I'd hope for.  It was like the only decent thing Trigger has done since the first LWA!  It's a prime example that Trigger is one half of a legendary studio <br><br>The animators are all masters of their craft<br><br>The writers are garbage</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was  fun. </br>  <br>Personally I won't call them masters for this, it was a high budget OVA. I'll wait until they make some amazing animation in one of their tv series before doing that.</br>  As much as generic the story was, I really enjoyed it. I also like how they show Akko being more skillful in her magic, some magic/wizard shows with 'talentless'/delinquent protag usually keeps their protag useless in fundamentals until suddenly he become god or something.  <br>But the first one was generic as hell too. The point of LWA is that you get a cute story for children with a pretty, modern animation, yet reminiscent of older  western  masterpieces.<br><br>You are basically complaining that a show for children isn't DEEP. I don't think it was ever supposed to be.</br></br></br>  <br>He's not complaining that this is not DEEP, I don't know how you got this from his post.</br>  It was fun, but I always had the feeling that there was more to this than what was shown. This felt like an intro to a series, and I think that's what was intended. Especially since the antagonist was sorta small scaled compared to a lot of villians.  You can tell the creative process goes something like this <br><br> Hey Yoh what do you want to animate this time? <br> A dancing tomboy  <br> You heard the man, write something up <br> Ok sir this is the first draft we th... <br> Ok good enough <br> But sir this is just the first draft we have a lot more work to do  <br> I SAID GOOD ENOUGH! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much Akko's case, actually. She can barely manage manupulating simple objects, still can't ride a broom and basically the only spell she manages alright is a huge archmage-level ballista at the end. Doesn't make the OVA worse, but no, it's not that different from the ones you don't like.</br>  <br>I only watched the first 3 minutes, it was horrible. I will watch the rest one day, but i have absolutely no motivation to do so</br>  <br> Implying tomboy wasn't what they put the most effort into <br><br>She was made for breeding.</br></br></br>  <br>Really? Yeah she can't ride brooms yet but she can control those dancing brooms, she can make the fireworks, and she can use magic to do menial tasks. I remember she can't do shit in the first.</br>  Really enjoyed it. A lot more than I was expecting to.  <br>Well yeah that's my point</br>  <br>Actually, it was more like <br> We'll make a disney-style musical parade with animated objects for the next OVA <br> The climax is three protags casting a huge spell <br> Ow wow, we got more moneys than we needed, let add a dancing tomboy before the parade <br> OK let's get this over with </br></br></br></br></br>  It was fun  <br>Banana peel.<br><br>They really like Banana hair at Trigger's.</br></br></br>  <br>I really liked the new characters. Especially Amanda and Constanza. After the first LWA I wanted more of Akko and Co, now after LWA2 I want more but this time because of the new characters.</br>  <br>I thought she was just in need for some good dicking.</br>  <br>Hello, me.</br>  <br>Needs more BGM and some sections need to turn up the volume of BGM.</br>  <br>I'm glad for Amanda but aside from that it felt incredibly fillerific and uninspired.</br>  First movie was better.  <br>The first one didn't get one, so I'm not holding my breath for this either.<br><br>Maybe they should've made a stretch goal where they would dub it but with everyone speaking their native tongue and not just Japanese and English. But I'm only dreaming.</br></br></br>  When does the Bluray get delivered?  <br> gg fansubs </br>  <br>It was pretty good, but I expected a lot more technically. despite I liked it, it didn't chane my opinion that Trigger should be erased</br>  First one was better, but then again, the first one was also great. It was a tough act to follow and the sequel met my expectations.<br><br>Whoever handled the subtitling should be slapped. It was almost as bad as Rebellion's camrip subs.</br></br>  <br> Akko is still idealistic. <br><br>If you want to see a magical girl show where idealism is broken down, watch Madoka Magica.</br></br></br>  <br>Been a while since watching anime has made me overwhelmingly happy, instead of just "haha" happy.<br><br>This was too good. Here's hoping for a third.</br></br></br>   sudden UK flag <br><br>so its based in the UK? Nowhere here looks like that. Looks more like Prague to me.</br></br>  Will Trigger's upcoming original TV show be good?  Maan, trigger is quickly becoming my favorite studio.  <br>Considering KLK and Ninja Slayer, it won't. It will be fun to watch and discuss on /a/ for sure, though.</br>  <br> stopping halfway <br> missing the best part </br></br>  <br> implying tropes are specific to one show <br> one that most of /a/ has never even heard of <br> there were no magic school stories before Harry Potter </br></br></br>  <br>i still can't work out who she reminds me of, chirico cuvie? i dont know<br>still best witch<br>she should get a fantasy mecha spinofff</br></br></br>    <br>Depictions of the UK in anime usually always end up being embellished with European looking architecture. The town does looks a bit like Hereford though, if it was cleaned up a bit.</br>  <br>its a witch academy, of course its UK based.</br>  Was pretty adorable, but you could see quality trigger moneysaving in it.<br><br>The first one was a lot more polished imo.</br></br>  <br>It will be fixed/corrected for BD.</br>  <br><br>Why bother releasing it in this state then? I mean they went to kickstarter to not have to bullshit like this right?</br></br>  <br>They promised Anime Expo the premiere. Yoshinari is polishing and fixing some stuff for the BD/theatrical release. Some animation fixes, sound mixing fixes and subtitle fixes.</br>  Best $110 I ever spent.  <br>FFXI tarutaru</br>  Trigger made the girls cute and that was all I was expecting. Trigger is the savior of anime.  <br>But anon. Friendship isn't a mistake.</br>  <br> Crunchyroll <br> not ripping <br><br>I may could buy that they fix some part that they don't think is right, or that they write the subs using CR/Funi script, but saying that they don't rip is too stupid</br></br></br></br>  <br>smoother loop</br>  <br> Inferno Cop </br>  <br>I still have trouble with the design because it looks like the wand gets split in half</br>  <br>What the fuck? They didn't sub Seven Deadly Sins because neither Funimation nor Crunchyroll licensed it, so they couldn't rip. Fucking lying cunts.</br>  Not enough Diana.  Was hoping Diana would get tied up by those magical tentacles   <br> not liking Brit dub master race <br><br>faggot</br></br></br>  This is so stupid yet so smart at the same time.  <br>With a wicked sense like myself.</br>  <br>You won't be saying that when the show becomes mainstream and ''the next best anime since Attack on Titan''.</br>  It's funny but it wont be good, just give it 3  <br>green is best girl</br>  I like the voice acting, and this girl is perfect.  Aren't we going to get better subs than shitty funi rips for this show?  <br>The fact funi "censors" words with * piques my autism.<br><br> I actually think commie and their memesubs would work 100% for this show </br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping so. I want to rewatch it sometime this week and it'd be nice if there were some decent subs out by then.</br>  IT'S LEWDING TIME!  S-O-X S-O-X  <br>We either get funishit or commeme.

Anybody who didn't drop SYD in the first season has something wrong with them.</br>  <br> SYD <br> comedic timing </br></br>  <br> Literally ripping off hentai kamen </br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep<wbr>ing_normality<br>It's already happening, face it.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Where are you getting those from?</br>  There is nothing wrong with this society. It makes women feel more safe and not subject of abuse  <br>It's a Chinese scanlate, don't you see?</br>  <br> no one knows how babbies are formed <br> good </br></br>  <br><br>For example, just 10 years ago in America, the best comedians could still make racial jokes, be they about Jews, blacks, Hispanics or whatnot. Now, racial humor is considered not PC and is no longer welcome on college campuses. Watch any Eddie Murphy movie from the 80s or 90s, or any Richard Pryor comedy routine. These are now considered "offensive," and therefore unfit for public consumption. No joke.<br><br>Just 10 years ago, men who thought they were women and dressed up in women's clothes were shunned by society and joked about even in polite conversation. These days, these people receive their penis-removal surgery with public tax dollars, and are featured on the covers of prominent women's magazines, referred to with female pronouns, and commended by the President for their "bravery."<br><br>Likewise, some 30 years ago, gay people were tied up to flagpoles and beaten until they were straight. They were the brunt of the best jokes and definitely considered dangerous perverts who molested children and carried HIV. These days, if you donate to a Christian charity that believes gayness can be cured through prayer, you will lose your job. The White House is decorated in the degenerate colors of the gay flag.<br><br>The thought police are stronger now than they have been since McCarthyism, except instead of promoting patriotism, they are promoting degeneracy, drug use and miscegenation. The masses haven't seem to have noticed anything has changed, though. Rachel Dolezal and Bruce Jenner are talked about on TV shows as if they might seriously be able to change their genes if they "feel black" or if they "feel womanish." <br><br>It is entirely possible that the regressive element in our society, in Orwellian fashion referred to as "progressive," could totally ruin our country to a similar extent envisioned in Shimoneta. In America, talking about sex wouldn't be taboo, but certainly any criticism of progressive-approved notions on gender, sexuality and race would be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which... Any VNfag care to elaborate how is actually baby formed in this society? In Vitro under full anesthesia?<br><br>But where does sperm come from and are doctors performing it not in violation of the laws?</br></br></br>  <br>I've remembered how bad I was bullied for liking anime. Just 15 years ago.</br>  <br>Stop with this bullshit, women are still treated like trash, look at this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zNO<wbr>TWjIJ58E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Man attacks woman. Out of 24 people, only 4 help.<br><br>Nobody gives a shit about women's rights</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In America, talking about sex wouldn't be taboo, but certainly any criticism of progressive-approved notions on gender, sexuality and race would be <br><br>Yea, in America, that's the point. Nobody in Europe gives a shit about stuff like that, stop pretending that America is the world</br></br></br>  <br>That's common human psychology at work, anon. If it were a man, the same number of people would help because, as bystanders in a situation like that most would assume someone else is going to do something or hope that things work out by themselves when the proper authority arrives. Not every individual feels that they should step in, even when if they believe it to be the right thing to do.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bysta<wbr>nder_effect</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I will ignore the fact that I didn't even mention the treatment of women in my post at all and just say that even if I had, that would be a pretty bad example of how women are supposedly treated badly. With modern civil lawsuits, you can get sued for seemingly just about anything. The public has been cowed into staying out of other people's business, regardless of if it's "the right thing" to do or not.</br>  <br>You weren't bullied for liking anime, but because you were an ugly sperg.<br><br>We had two huge weaboos in class - one was on the basketball team and chill and the other wore naruto tshirts and never shut the fuck up. Only one of them was bullied, nobody gave a fuck about the other one being a weeaboo.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's actually getting better? Are you underage or do you really think that the world in the past was more "free"?</br>  <br>You Europeans have some pretty fucked up notions of white guilt. Google "Rotterham rapes." An entire police force looked the other way as Middle-eastern rape gangs raped some 1400 Aryan lolis because if they took down the rape gang gingpins, they were afraid of being accused of being racists (since there were no whites doing the raping).</br>  <br> Man attacks woman. Out of 24 people, only 4 help. <br>I wonder, how many would help if a woman attacked a man? Or a man attacked a man? Or a woman attacked a woman? My guess 0/24, 2/24 and 4/24.</br></br>  <br>Let's see. HIV is only a recent development of the sexual promiscuity revolution. Due to people not knowing how to copulate in a way that produces babies anymore, the white birthrate is plummeting in every Western nation to the point where it is becoming national policy to bring immigrants in by the boatload just to keep the economy afloat. Our countries are becoming browner and browner, and politics are shifting to favor the low class, easier-to-manipulate outsiders, instead of protecting national interests. Brown people are promoted and hired based on meeting racial quotas instead of by merit, and women are given special treatment under the auspices of gender equality and are often promoted undeservedly with a nod to the gender pay gap myth. Yeah, shit's pretty fucking bad right now.</br>  <br>I remember watching Eddie Murphy movies on over-the-air TV channels as a kid. Those were the days.</br>  <br> the white birthrate is plummeting in every Western nation to the point where it is becoming national policy to bring immigrants in by the boatload just to keep the economy afloat. <br>It has been happening since 1970s. <br> favor the low class, easier-to-manipulate outsiders, instead of protecting national interests <br>Again, nothing particularly new. <br><br> Yeah, shit's pretty fucking bad right now <br>I was talking about censorship, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It has been happening since 1970s. <br>Right around when the sexual promiscuity revolution really took off. Hmm...<br> Again, nothing particularly new.  <br>See: . And yes, it is relatively new.<br> I was talking about censorship, though. <br>Is English even your first language? How was that post supposed to be about censorship?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can we read the raw somewhere?</br>  <br>Where are our panty wearing terrorists?</br>  <br> Right around when the sexual promiscuity revolution really took off. Hmm... <br>No, it's closely related to decolonization and the economic crisis of 1973. <br><br> Is English even your first language? How was that post supposed to be about censorship? <br> So it's actually getting better? Are you underage or do you really think that the world in the past was more "free"? <br>I was talking about censorship. It's not worse today than in 1970s or 1980s.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this, I would love to translate this shit some time, but I'd need RAWs for that.</br>  That's rich. Pathetic neckbeards who watch shitty perverted cartoons all day talk about traditional values.  Who will the MC end up with?  please tell me it's not anna   <br> UK is the entire Europe </br>  <br>I doubt there will be anything like an end this season, if it's a novel adaption.</br>  <br>Still less pathetic than her.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127667256 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127667428 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127670129 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127670049 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127670249 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It will be indecent and become a harem.</br>   hope for interesting social commentary <br> expect SYD 2.0 <br>I guess I can't fault it for betraying my expectations, but it's still disappointing.</br></br>  <br>I never got bullied in school, I played pokemon tcg inside the classroom</br>  <br>Do you have androphobia or something? Can you not watch shows that isn't cute girls doing cute things.<br><br>This protagonist is fucking amazing. He talks backs and makes decisions.</br></br></br>  <br>It has nothing to do with gender, that's just the cancer known as individualism.<br>Women have it fine in the west, if you want to complain try the middle east or africa.</br></br>  <br>It's weird seeing 4chan talk about what's degenerate or not.</br>   This isn't a anime <br> It's a recording of the future <br> Our tech can only simply render it in 2D </br></br>  <br>Why don't you want him to end up with Anna?</br>  is this the same girl who also the megamilk pose?  <br> if you want to complain try the middle east or africa. <br><br>But that would be racist anon. The women there should learn to appreciate their rich and tolerant culture.</br></br></br>   Metal Rim on the front <br> Future Japanese confirmed for no adams apple </br>  <br> still confusing 2D with 3D <br>Nice one newfag. Also I really find it amusing that you see 4chan talk about what's degenerate or not as weird, but you don't see it as weird that most of the degeneracy here is posted by virgins who haven't engaged in normal sexual relation, let alone fetishes and kinky shit.</br></br>  <br>But... That was my point.</br>  <br>  yet so smart at the same time. </br>  I want /pol/ to leave.  <br>Welcome to every single thread until the show finishes airing. It's going to be hell</br>  <br>At least the show isn't promoting race-mixing.</br>  <br>Why are they even here outside of shitposting? I mean you would think that that chinese cartoons promotes everything they are against with "muh multiculturalism", "muh degeneracy", "muh aryan race" ect.</br>  <br>Japanese (aka, East Aryans) are model nationalists. They do not allow the mass importation of rapist Mexicans or Arabs into their country, they do not intermarry with other races, and they stamp out multiculturalism very effectively at every level of their society. If only Western countries could follow their lead.</br>  <br> East Aryans <br><br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA<br><br>JAPS ARE LITERALLY UGLY SHORT SUBHUMAN MONKEYS THAT STOLE OTHERS CULTURES<br><br>THERE IS NOTHING "ARYAN" ABOUT THEM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are Aryan in spirit.</br>  <br>And yet apple products are incredibly popular there</br>  <br><br>Too bad that marrying a chinese man is acceptable to over 90% of the population and isn't seen as weird. Korea to lesser amount (iirc 65%), just because we make jokes about how much the elevens hate koreans doesn't make it true. So go back to /pol/ with your "muh multiculturalism" because what you know about the elevens is wrong.</br></br>  <br>The only site I know off the top of my head for raws is raw.senmanga. The site is kinda buggy and slow though.</br>  <br>Chinese and Japanese are the same race, dumbass. It's not anywhere close to the same level as marrying a black. It would be the same sort of thing as a Frenchman marrying a German.</br>  <br>I started reading the manga and stopped cause it was just too silly. Enjoy your shit.</br>  <br>Manga-zone.org has a working link for the first tank.</br>  <br>Heteroconger hassi<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_OM<wbr>Df7Q9n04</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I have seen similar "experiment" with man attacking woman and vice versa. The woman got helped quite frequently but dude getting his shit kicked got laughed at and woman beating him got cheered up by other women. People generaly thought "he did something bad, so he deserved the beating", while woman getting beaten was "obviously" abuse.<br><br>That said the statistic sample you are working with is too small to make any good assumptions anyway (same thing with that one I mentioned) .<br><br>It isn't even that special that when someone is trying to defend abused woman in fight like that (fight within a couple), he will get attacked by "victim". Because they are gonna start to defend their partner (even the shitty one). So good luck at court because they are gonna sue the shit out of you if you are gonna even touch the abuser.<br><br>But really, that video doesn't prove or show anything at all. Just a shitty viral video for tumblr shits to jump at.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Art: Yuzuki N Dash <br>boners.jpg</br></br>  <br>What part of this is smart?</br>  <br>I thought the point of this censor was to give an illusion of a naked body, not censoring an actual naked body.</br>  <br>Perhaps she isn't actually naked under that.</br>  <br>Well, that's usually what you do to bikini pictures to make the subject look naked, so you're not wrong.</br>  <br> unironically liking LNs <br>You've read other things aside from nutritional facts on cereal boxes right?</br></br>  WHO IS BLUE SNOW AND WHY SHE WEARS A MASK   No one translating the manga <br><br>Someone will pick them up after the anime right</br></br>  <br>This has no chance of going mainstream.</br>  <br>LEWDING THIS SCHOOL WITH NO SURVIVORS</br>  <br><br>IF I TAKE OFF HER PANTIES WOULD SHE DIE ?</br></br>  mfw i find out that Anna's VA is Hisui  <br> Japan in charge of memes </br>  <br>But the publishers of those magazines go unpunished? That would be easier to censor than every perv in the country.</br>   show about nudity and vulgarity in the country where they have folkloristic traditions about nudity and vulgarities still respected today, all meanwhile people in families see eachother naked all the fucking time <br>what the fuck</br>  <br>It's like child pornography.

Wasn't she supposed to be pure?</br>  <br>Only on the outside.</br>  <br>She is.

Think about it, if she knows her man like many claim then she should know the do's and don'ts and if you do a don't. Then she only has herself to blame.</br>    <br>It's ongoing but it's obvious it will be purest girl - Ayame</br>  <br>IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY LEWD</br>  <br>She can't distinguish between lewd and pure. That's how pure she is. To her they might just be playing some naked wrestling.</br>  <br> I wouldn't help her because that woman deserved it <br><br>Trying too hard.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm not because if the woman didn't do anything wrong then there would be no reason for the guy hitting her in the first place.</br>  <br>How many men has she fucked without realizing it?<br><br> inb4 she's still a virgin and will only be a slut for MC  <br>Please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Missionary position under the bedsheets with the lights off for the sole purpose of procreation, and not even holding hands because that would be too lewd.

Because the thought police have arrived</br>  <br>That's the catch.</br>    <br>No, it's just a fad is all because it was cool to make fun of the blacks and jews during that time was all, but now it's just boring.

That analogy doesn't even make sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It has nothing to do with political correctness or thought police. <br>That would explain how coincidentally with the arrival of our first shitskin president, suddenly the thought police have deemed black humor to be unacceptable.

So no, they're not laughing because it's funny they're laughing because they deemed it as truth.<br><br>That's why you see a high wave of no racist jokes of today because of that.

Just a lot of lol so random shit and not actual translations.  <br>No, what makes jokes funny is how they were said.<br><br><br>The same things that are referred to today. That the world is controlled by the Jews, that the US is allowing illegals into the nation because they want to genocide the white race, that the banks are trying to bleed dry the citizens, that the white race was is the omnievil, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't even live on that continent. <br>Then you have no right to say  or  as a response to , which was talking exclusively about how American politics relate to Shimoneta.

Black people have regular sized eyes. You couldn't even joke about blindfolding them with dental floos. <br><br>Q: How do you blindfold an Asian?<br>A: With dental floss!<br>It's corny, but this joke works for the exact reason that the previous joke failed. Because there's a grain of truth to the source of the humor. <br><br>Same deal with blonde jokes. Blonde women are notoriously stupid, so jokes making fun of stupid people are interchangeable with jokes making fun of blonde women and they work because there is a grain of truth to the stereotype.<br><br><br> The same things that are referred to today. That the world is controlled by the Jews, that the US is allowing illegals into the nation because they want to genocide the white race, that the banks are trying to bleed dry the citizens, that the white race was is the omnievil, etc. <br>You're a fucking idiot who has likely never even heard a racial joke in his life.

I'll just sit back and await the mass thread deletion and cleansing of all Shimoneta threads from /a/ once mods figure this out.</br>  <br> these leaps in logic <br>Are you a literal retard?</br></br>  <br>Here</br>  <br> the guy <br>Retard. Did you even watch the episode? Don't answer, since I know you didn't. <br><br>The woman was speaking in that scene.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gangsta <br> Feminist <br><br>Didn't the protagonist take a whore into his personal custody to do work for him and suck his dick?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What logical fallacy? That I called Bill Shittle mean things?<br>And I actually went through that video. It was exactly as I imagined. He stupidly assumes that Democrats are still racist KKK remnants all part of some evil conspiracy to trick the blacks, just because of their political policies multiple decades ago.</br></br>  <br>You children scream the same thing at people you disagree with: "STOP CROSSBOARDING!!" First it was to /v/ boogeyman. Now it's the /pol/ boogeyman.</br>  <br>Not what I meant asshat, I meant any official subs taken from the HS directory.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the guy, changing his clothes and coming up with an excuse to save the gorilla from her.</br>  <br><br> &gt;Gangsta <br>  <br> Feminist shit. <br> &gt;Okusama <br>  <br> Sjw crap. <br>Fucking explain yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You will never have a threesome with them </br>  <br>He is talking about the way mc-kun changed his looks so quickly, you spastic retard.</br>  <br><br><br>She's a slut and sluts are to not be tolerated.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you fucking read the thread?<br>How much of that shit is /a/ related at all?</br></br>  <br> What logical fallacy? <br>Not even him, but really? I mean, REALLY?</br></br>  <br>It's all related to this anime, so I guess it's all /a/-related.</br>  <br>But the Gangsta world is pure shit. No pure girls in that hellhole.</br>  <br> thought crime and extensive censorship <br>Are you really this arrogant that you consider this something unique to /pol/?

No. The conversation started with the fact that the anime itself makes a very astute commentary on society.

What do you gain?</br>  <br>Yup if they don't suddenly cut it that is.</br>  <br>Are you saying that any discussion that arises fro a show doesn't belong on /a/? Are you saying that only waifu threads belong on /a/, you fucking faggot?</br>  <br><br>Is that the main "girl" of this series? Because if so, it's dropped before it even begins.</br></br>  <br>I do get hard when I think about anons fapping.</br>  <br>Because it deals with political issues? Yeah, no. That doesn't cut it. And since when does /pol/ give a shit about the Tokyo bill? You're reaching ridiculously far to make this /pol/ related, by pretending this is about how the liberal machine is oppressing the West</br>  <br>Nope different.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Compare their chests.</br>  <br>i love those kind of eyes.</br>  <br> This is so stupid <br>Yes it is.<br> yet so smart at the same time. <br>No it is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's only because of the Southern Democrats. From Lincoln's time to the Civil Rights Movement, Democrats had to pander to their voting bloc in the South. Once Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, signed the Civil Rights Act into law, that entire bloc defected. They tried to form their own party but eventually ended up with the Republicans.</br>  <br> Screaming about liberals and political correctness gone made and how much you hate degeneracy has nothing to do with the show. <br><br>The show is all about political correctness gone mad though. That is its main theme.<br><br>It is true that it's also massively pro-sexual-anything while /pol/ generally isn't, but that doesn't stop the theme of thought policing from being relevant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're reaching ridiculously far to make this /pol/ related, by pretending this is about how the liberal machine is oppressing the West <br>Woah there body, hold your horses. I just jumped on the shitposting bandwagon, I don't even know hwat I'm shitposting about.<br> though I do believe that the liberal machine oppressing the west can draw paralels to this show.

You're reaching too hard. Does feeling victimized makes you feel better?</br>  <br> I'm a strong independent freedom fighter, hear me roar! <br>No /pol/, you are not entitled to control every discussion about everything that is related to politics. Some of us just want to discuss the show, we don't want to make threads discussing the threat of SJWs. How is this hard to understand?<br><br>But the whole thing can be discussed form an /a/ perspective. There's no need to bring in /pol/.</br></br></br></br>  There wasnt much to talk about the show anyways. This thread would be empty without pol  <br>If not wanting anime touching on politics to be used as an excuse for /pol/tard levels of discussion is autistic, then call me CWC</br>  <br>Is that the main "girl" of this series?

How is this hard to understand? <br><br>Well, the main problem with that is that the "threat of SJWs" is explicitly the premise of the show. What you're asking for is like talking about Schindler's List without mentioning Nazis or Jews.</br></br></br>  <br>Then let the thread fucking die.<br><br>But maybe I should help the Overlord threads out when they slow down, by talking about MMOs like I'm on /v/ and Occulus Rift.

Do you understand who is the main audience of anime?</br></br>  Threads like these are what makes me thank god for recursive post hiding.  <br>/a/ has been calling normalfags out and moralfags for this type of behavior even before /pol/ was a board, what we don't do is talk about how it relates to topical American politics.</br>  Oh it seems fun now, but the Betalord MC fucking ruins it.  <br>Did you even watch the fucking show: see <br><br><br>Do you even know what type of show this is at it's core?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, better shelter your eyes and ears so your liberal brain doesn't get deprogrammed.</br>  Sick and tired of /pol/ insane ramblings.<br>Just the other day /pol/ claimed that the 4th of Jew Lie is a Jewish ploy to rally the Americans into a patriotic stupor.</br>  You think this could be Ayame in disguise?  <br> GATE threads <br>We don't want them either.</br></br>  Reminder that Myuugi is the strongest character within the medium, and that Demonbane isn't a true omnipotent.

Red-haired Cinderella sounds interesting  isn't the manga quite good?  <br>i'm hyped, from the PV the animation looks so beautiful and Bones is doing this</br>  Okay, which one of you are responsible for this garbage?  <br>Wrong thread?</br>  <br>PV 2 looks better<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XzX<wbr>LibJm6GE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> comeback of Yona <br>Fuck off and kill yourself.<br><br>Dont compare the gem that is Akagami to shit like Yona. Its like saying Legend of Galactic Heroes is comeback of Legend of Legendary Heroes (not that the Bones will not fuck up the adaptation)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yona&gt;Akagami.<br>By a mile.</br></br>  <br>Its great. One of best political shoujo period - in line of 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku Monogatari, Fushigi Yuugi. But its Bones.</br>  Fuck, they should fire that seiyu, her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard.<br><br><br>And I loved the song, you know the song name anon?</br></br></br>  <br>If its on the same level as 12 kindowms then i'm reading this right the fuck now<br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> look! i am newfag for whome yona was babies first "historical fantasy" shoujo <br>Yona is infinitely inferior subpar clone of Saiunkoku Monogatari. Not ever worth mentioning unless you are complete newfag that did not watch anything else.</br></br>  A show that actually looks kind of all around good, yeah fat chance getting anyone here to pay any attention.  <br>I would say that Akagami is bereft of the political intrigue in these manga and is hence fundamentally different. There is little lingering conflict and things are a bit more sedate. Still a fun read.</br>  <br> political <br>Dropped</br></br>  <br>It is OP theme of the anime "Yashashii Kibou" by Saori Hayami <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3so<wbr>7XzFbmD0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>There is plenty of political intrigue. Its just the MC does not suddenly become minister of state or something like that having all centuring around her. She is support for Zen, who in turn is pawn of his brother. They get involved in lots of political stuff, just not always on first roles.</br>  Aw man, I was expecting some heavy feels with this, but MC girl basically falls in love with the guy after the first chapter.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Why is that bad?</br>  <br>She is not really anon, they are just friends.</br>  <br>Well, things are clearly not as sinister, complex or heavy in Akagami. It is nevertheless a very comfy manga, but clearly departs from the themes explored by 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku and even Yona.</br>  <br>There is no struggle with romance - they love each other and its a fact. The problem is that she`s a simple medic and he`s a prince - there are all kind of problems approaching her to him without causing trouble.<br><br><br>i`d say its very near to Saiunkoku in premise. As far sinister goes - there are assassination plots, plague, war, pirates kidnapping, court intrigues etc. Though indeed, it did not result in anything truly tragic and drastic yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. They become best friends before any actual romance happens. I kinda like how low-key their relationship is, they just realize they want to be together and it all happens without any misunderstandings or other typical shoujo bullshit. It's refreshing.</br>  <br>They declare their love in a forest and kiss anon. Come on, I've read this, don't pull shit out of your ass.</br>  <br>this is the best kind of romance</br>  <br>Because of Ore Monogatari.</br>  <br>WHAT the fuck does this have to do with Idle Activities?</br>  The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki.<br><br>I get it, she`s cute, nice and has unique hair - but there are two prince ready to marry her, people easily influenced by her right after meeting her etc.<br><br>Though manga does good by showing other side too: some people clearly think little of her, some just consider concubine approached so Zen could play with her, some trow hard checks if she`s worthy and can survive the environment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. The author even takes a situation that is usually milked for MISUNDERSTANDINGS and drama, and has the female MC just go "Oh, I thought there was probably an explanation for it."</br>  <br>Akagami thankfully does not limit itself to two lovebirds staring each others for dozen chapters. There plenty of stuff happening.<br><br>Hell, the manga even took the most risky turn for shoujo at all - separated them for years.</br></br></br>  <br> litterally EVERYONE <br>Why can't Ameriburgers figure out how to use "literally" correctly?</br></br>  I was reading the first Volume ages ago in a local bookstore, honestly it was pretty fucking neat. Looking forward to the Anime, hoping for some comfy medieval adventure time maybe like a road trip.  <br>I wouldn't say everyone falls for her. Just Zen, Raji, and Obi. And Obi wants Zen's dick, too, so whatever.</br>  Is this 12 ep long or 24?  <br>Why do i get this feeling i've seen this on sadpanda<br>God i hate when this happens</br></br>  It's one of the shoujo manga I'm reading (bc I'm very picky with shoujo and I don't read many) so I'm very hyped about this adaption even though I'm not a big fan of the character design.  <br>Nothing really happens in this version, though.

I still dont trust Bones until i see it.</br>  <br>Exactly, you're using the word wrong. Saying literally everyone is in love with her would mean characters such as Kiki is in love with her as well, which is blatantly untrue.</br>  Why do I always turn into such a fag when I read stuff like this?  Its a manga where all characters chatter "when will they finally fuq?" behind MCs back.<br><br>In before Zen`s brother actually set`s a demand that if Zen wants to marry Shiroyuki, he needs to make an offspring.</br></br>  People will pick it up for Shiroyuki and stay for Kiki.

And Raji already falls for her since the beginning</br>  <br>Still untrue in context with the story. It was a big exaggaration, no matter how you try to defend it.</br>  <br>I just realize that Zen's brother is voiced by Akira Ishida</br>  <br>No, because argevollen was genuine boring trash.</br>  <br>You are the one who pull shit out of your ass. There is no declaration of love or kiss in first chapter.</br>  <br>I was not talking about the first chapter, but the ones that follow.</br>  <br><br>What is it with red haired heroines that tugs at the sense of fantasy, romance, and adventure?</br></br>  <br> The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki. <br><br>If she's going to be a character like Snow White, a Disney-tier "princess", it hedges closer to the material that everyone falls for her.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> political </br></br>  <br>Snow White/Cinderella are shit character types. Those are plain and dumb persons that through miracle gets everyoen loving them and attention.<br><br>Shiroyuki is the opposite type - the hard working one, the capable: the one that has to prove all the time she deserves the place she is at.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> not political </br></br>  Please cover the entire manga, please cover the entire manga. I'm resisting the urge to read this so I can get the best possible experience.  <br>Its two cour, but i doubt it`ll cover entire manga (its still ongoing).<br><br>Saiunkoku Monogatari was 75 episodes long, and it still did not cover the whole novels, stopping at most interesting stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga will be inevitably better than anime.

One of the better mecha series last year and I liked it far more than the rest.</br>  <br>I'm okay with raw, since we have the translated manga so can at least understand the scenes.</br>  <br>How many days? Where are you seeing this</br>  <br> summer is only a meme </br>  <br>Funi has barely subbed new shows so far, Chaos Dragon, Dandellion and Logos's subs still aren't out yet.<br><br>Anyone who wants to catch the live streaming of episode 1<br>It is in 3 hours 22 minutes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda wish I'd understand Moon now.</br>  <br> not being able to watch stuff just fine <br>Having seen almost no anime must feel bad.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you Funi. They always do this every season.<br><br><br>I will try and watch it, unless I have stuff to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet they released Game of Laplace on time and they did it by announcing it the very day it aired. In fact, every time they announced a simulcast release they did it on the same they it was released. So I wouldn't count out Akagami from being released today just yet.</br>  <br>I try to avoid stuff that only consists of the usual boring phrases that are repeated endlessly in 90% of the shows. I usually don't even watch stuff that's still airing but this show has picked my interest.</br>  <br>Thanks for your normalfag anime blog. Where do I subscribe?</br>  <br>Do you do anything besides shitposting ?</br>  <br> s-shitposting <br>  ? <br>You should go back to reddit, friend.</br></br></br>  <br>So you don't.</br>  <br>Maybe it depends on distributor, i hope we gets Shirayuki-hime fast too because it is Warner Bro.</br>  <br>huh. since when was shirayukihime any good? i only read it when it first came out. it didn't make that much of an impression.</br>  This is nothing like Yona; this is laidback, slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression.  What's the point comparing Yona and Akagami?<br>Both of those are  fun   in a different way.  At the very least it's not the usual shoujoshit. Still a snore-fest sometimes though. </br>  <br> slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression. <br>I have to disagree with you, they just don't make drama out of that and the manga is actually pretty funny too</br></br>  Which is better, this or Yona?  <br>I like this better</br>  While I get why people are comparing this to Yona, it's more like Horimiya romance and pace-wise than Yona, in my opinion. <br><br>The fantasy and political background is of the same vein as Yona but the way the story is told is more slice-of-lifey, non-dramatic like Horimiya. <br><br>Yona's a tad more dramatic than Akagami. It's both good and bad. People might say it's boring because there's really no drama when it comes to Shirayuki and Zen's relationship. There's no third party trying to interfere (Obi's in love with both Shirayuki and Zen and has no intentions of ever breaking them up), Izana's on the Zen x Shirayuki wagon after quibbling a bit and that's only because he wanted Zen to be absolutely sure Shirayuki's who he wanted, Kiki and Mitsuhide have a lovely side romance going on.<br><br>Honestly, it's just a really comfy slice-of-life of royalty with a splash of political and medical/pharmaceutical issues. <br><br>Plus, I'm a sucker for big brothers who dote on their little brothers. Izana and Zen are good siblings to each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the low-key drama makes dramatic moments stand out that much more - the MC isn't constantly having to deal with attacks on her life, so the one time she gets a warning crossbow shot (with helpful description attached), it's more of a big deal.</br>  <br>Got any proof?</br>  First episode in 1 hour<br><br>neetball will stream it</br></br>  <br>What about Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, could it be compared to that?</br>    <br>I guess it's just an assumption that Funi simulcast will be delayed like some of their series and Funi still hasn't announced the schedule for this.</br>  <br> Mentioning Fushigi Yuugi at all </br>  <br><br>Fuck is the main guy the "I always fight with my sword's scabbard on cuz I'm that good hurr" guy?</br></br>  <br>Definitely. Probably even more than Horimiya, considering the setting. The MCs in Akagami are probably just a little less dramatic than Soredemo. Really, Zen and Shirayuki are probably one of the most drama-free couples I've come across. I don't know about the future but up to the most current chapter, they've never even had a disagreement that's threatened to break them up. I tend to like my romance drama free so it's probably why I rate them high (along with Horimiya's MCs).<br><br>Story-wise, both Soredemo and Akagami deal with royalty. Soredemo's probably more political, what with the main lead the actual king of a country while Zen's just the king's younger brother.<br><br><br>Shirayuki deals with the attempts on her life nmuch better than I would. But then, she's a lot calmer than me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like  that midget. </br>  <br>When Zen fights for real, there's no scabbard. It's not that kind of series where he shows off his sword skills. He's a prince. Everyone expects him to be that good. He HAS to be that good or his brother would confine him to the castle at all costs.</br>  <br>I think it's more "I only draw my sword against equals, not commoners like you". Snobbery based on status, not skills.</br>  <br>they are not tsunderes</br>  <br>Not really. He kills random pirates, presumably. It's not like he fights people all that often, though.</br>  In honor of the first episode, who are your five favorite characters?<br><br>1. Izana<br>2. Zen<br>3. Shirayuki<br>4. Kiki/Mitsuhide<br>5. Obi/ Ryuu (the pharmacy guy)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure about that? It's still offline.</br>  <br>It's tough, since I ended up surprisingly charmed by all of them in the end. But let's see.<br><br>1. Kiki<br>2. Obi<br>3. Zen<br>4. Shirayuki<br>5. Ryuu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 5 <br> Forever slavezoned. ;_; </br></br>  <br> In a perfect world, he could finagle a threesome. </br>  <br>No love for Mitsuhide? But the bromance.</br>  <br>scroll down there are two links there choose one as you like<br><br>It will start in 25 minutes</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice lists, MAL brothers.</br></br>   only Funi <br>Who will save us?</br>  <br>I like Mitsuhide just fine, but he doesn't quite make my top 5.<br><br><br>Fuck off, people make rankings in threads all the time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You. </br>  https://twitter.com/atarime738/stat<wbr>us/617660881711665153<br><br>Akagami main animators: Shigeru Fujita, Tsunenori Saito and Takahiro Komori. <br><br>I guess this show gonna have good animation, at least for 1st ep.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>And every single time they are cancerous brats like you.</br>  <br> cancerous brats <br>I'm just talking about a show in a thread about that show. Calm down.</br></br>  <br>Do it without acting like a landwhale tumblrite on her blog.</br>  <br>Oh the irony.</br>  <br>I'm utterly bemused as to why you're so mad.</br>  <br>Ignore the retards who seem insecure in their ability to talk about the characters of a show in the thread of that show. The paranoia is real.<br><br>Anyway, I still can't believe Ryuu makes it to your top 5 over Mitsuhide.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you make a top 10 shoujo series recommendation list for the good children on /a/ next? Even better, you can make a super cool youtube video for everyone else too!<br><br><br>You can do that without making retarded fangirl lists.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You seriously have issues, anon.</br>  <br>Should have used greater than signs. He wouldn't even have noticed you were making a ranking list that way. Hell, he's probably done it before himself.</br>  Both Yona and Akagami are boring. Pic related IS the shit.  neetball still offline?<br><br>It starts soon in 4 minutes</br></br>  <br>I really like the Yona manga. It's not quite 12 Kingdoms Level, but it definitely shocked me when I expected it to be some fantasy shoujo and next thing I know people are getting decapitated and shit.</br>  <br>I think you're right but it's pretty amazing how retarded a numerical list makes people stupid.</br>  <br>Basara was really good but the dumb Red King's identity stuff was drawn out pointlessly.</br>  <br>Oh hey, thanks for the rec.</br>  <br>Well shit, thanks for reminding me that I still have to remove that one from my backlog.</br>  <br>I like all the fantasy shoujo mentioned in this thread. Now what?</br>  Any good list of readable fantasy shoujo stuff?  <br>U se brute force called google. </br>  It is on douyu  <br>All these years later and I still prefer From Far Away or even Red River/Anatolia Story to Basara.</br>  <br>Oh look, it's that one idiot prince.</br>  <br> link? </br>  Basara: very good<br>Red River: decent, the final arc is fucking awful<br>Meteor Methuselah: decent, fairly shounen-ish<br>Kanata Kara: Inu-Yasha done right, good art</br></br></br>  <br>Just search the archive.

The manga peaked in the big battle against Ramses in which MC leads the army against Egypt.</br>  <br>Mine works just fine</br>  Oh shit cutting hair  <br>Kanata Kara<br>Red River<br><br>Two best shoujo ever</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do very selective rereading for that very reason.</br>  Is it me or was the way in which MC was drawn in Red River lewd as fuck? The manga had some decently hot smut for a shoujo.  <br>Izark a best, Noriko a cute.</br>   no one has announced they are fansubbing it   The animation looks weird.  <br>He has a point, his only mistake is still visiting this shithole after it got infested.</br>  <br>I think it looks nice</br>  So this is the OP, huh? Pretty nice, feels comfy  Gross, 3DPD in my anime  Damn, Bones sure didn't skimp on production values. Looks promising so far.<br><br><br>I've been here since 2007, my brother.</br></br></br>  Damn, I'd forgotten how much of an idiot the idiot prince was at the beginning. At least he got better. That's character development for you.  I totally forgot this aired today. Looks like I'm better off waiting for subs.  <br>There is precisely 0 hentai of this series, except maybe one yaoi pic.</br>  <br>Aside Funi, no fansub group said they are going to sub this.</br>  <br>I'm not surprised. There's literally zero fanservice in the manga. Not even a random character with big tits.</br>  <br> waiting Funi </br>  <br> Aside Funi <br>Fuck. Looks like I'm better off just downloading the raw then.<br><br>I don't really keep up with who does what.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's a manga for girls.</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wwny0</wbr>  <br>This confused me so much at the end of the episode. At first I thought there was suddenly a huge flash forward.</br>  <br>Decent enough. The song sounds like it's more suited for the ending rather than the opening though.</br>  So who is the king? Not that dark guy, right?  <br>Wait why split cour for this of all things, like it even looks really low budget</br>  <br>that is just the manga CM</br>  <br>The king's dead.</br>  If anyone cares, episode 1 is out on Funi site.<br><br>http://www.funimation.com/shows/sno<wbr>w-white-with-the-red-hair/videos/of<wbr>ficial/encounter-changing-the-color<wbr>-of-fate</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I know, doesn't make it less disgusting</br>  <br>Did you watch it? It didn't seem low budget at all.</br>  <br>Maybe they couldn't handle doing it all at once? BONES has a shitton of shows coming up, including the ever delayed Kekkai Sensen ending.</br>  <br>Oh so they did get it out on time</br>  <br> The song sounds like it's more suited for the ending rather than the opening though. <br>There will never be a "wait why is this the OP and that the ED" case as big as Sora no Woto's</br></br>  <br>Except it very clearly is, movement is so freaking slow, choppy, and generally not fluid. it doesnt even look like a bones show especially compared to the stuff they were doing in kekkai. Granted to be fair this is Bone's C-studio making this, same people who made chaika so you cant expect much</br>  <br> hurrdurr can't expect much from Bones studio C <br><br>Except they did Darker Than Black and StarDriver</br></br></br>  <br>Just you wait<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wub<wbr>VtyKQ1is</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Waiting for someone to rip it</br>  <br>The king is alive, they just use the title of 'king' regardless of gender.</br>  <br>How long do these usually take to rip?</br>  <br>yes, it is fast.<br><br>but it seems HS doesn't know it is out yet</br></br></br>  One of these panda thread things.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/830320/ebeba4<wbr>019b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830318/21b816<wbr>0774/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/829271/23b902<wbr>3b9e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830245/603201<wbr>2c28/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> iraq actually, why? </br>  <br> I just so happen to know a friend who is both a doctor and a big Shinobu fan, but I guess there's plenty of those. </br>  Does Comic X-Eros have some kind of subscription system for filthy gaijins, maybe one I could use a proxy with?<br>I figure I'm missing way too many of my favorite artists stuff, I must see it all.</br>  <br>No, but we get all of the raws anyways so I don't see how you could be missing something.</br>  <br>Physical copies could be nice too.</br>  So there's the mouth, the vagina, and the ass.
