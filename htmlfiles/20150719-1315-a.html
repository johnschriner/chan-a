[  http://bato.to/read/_/333062/tomo-<wbr>chan-wa-onna-no-ko_ch102_by_love-li<wbr>ve-scanlations</wbr></wbr> <br><br>The sexiest</br></br>  And fucking cunning.  <br><br> Misuzu will never have the sense of desperation she needs to fuck you <br><br>why even live</br></br></br></br>  Best 93-chapter binge in recent memory. Then the daily wait began.  If the mangaka never draws any porn of this, it will be a crime.  <br>One can only imagine what kind of cute/sexy sound she made at that moment.</br>  <br> 93-chapter <br> each chapter is a page <br> 93 pages <br>Not much of a binge.<br><br><br>He already draws plenty of porn though, this one is him getting his vanilla fix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you insert yourself into that panel </br>  <br><br>As which one though? Tomo or Misuzu</br></br>  <br>Dat sex hair</br>  <br>Tomo. Both sides have their charm though, now that I'm considering.</br>  We haven't seen Misuzu's love interest for awhile. I wonder if he's gonna try something schemey in here too, cause otherwise he's kind of a pointless charachter.  <br>Hence why I could actually bring myself to get through that many chapters in such a short time. No way do I have the dedication to do 100 chapters in a day of a manga with 20+ page chapters.</br>  <br>Oh wow. I thought his art looked familiar.</br>  <br> That tussled hair <br><br>I can't contain this boner, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He also did the one about the tall tomboy and the American girl</br></br>  I wish we'd gotten more of this.  <br>So many tomboys to explore.</br>  <br><br>Oh god I just want to fuck Misuzu till its painful.</br></br>  <br>OOGA BOOGA Where da hatefuck doujins at?</br>  <br><br>I'm always happy to see good doujin artists getting real work. He is getting paid for this right?</br></br>  <br><br>I have no idea. It's not serialized in a magazine or anything, but maybe? I can't imagine he'd do a chapter a day with no recompense</br></br>  <br>That one was too cute to fap to</br>  <br>I believe it's just a 4koma he puts up on a website. Free aside from probably donations.</br>  <br>Fuck, that was this artist? How did I not put two and two together.<br><br>The best is the imouto one with the tender hours long love making..</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad she was the only one of the three friends that didn't go through suffering. Chiyuri's put a stupid grin on my face, Mayu's was sweet but sad, and Ameri's just made me frown.</br>  <br>Possibly ad-revenue as well. Its on a popular enough site to have a weird Fate Mahjong doujin on it.<br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/f<wbr>atemahjong/0019.html<br><br><br>That one was cute too. Except for the part where the imouto was raped horribly off screen.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Why is my arm numb?  <br>You slept on it?</br>  <br>Tomo's character design fires on all of my fetishes.<br> Tomboy <br> Medium length hair <br> dress down <br> fang <br> spats </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Jun the only entertaining boy? The other two seem kinda flat.  <br>Yanagida Fumita really is a great artist.</br>  I didn't think this would be true when I first started reading, but Tomo is actually third best girl.<br><br> Misuzu <br> Blondie <br> Tomo <br><br>Sorry Tomo, but you can't argue with those tits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tits over character <br> Tomo is already stacked <br><br>You silly nigger it's Tomo -&gt; Misuzu -&gt; Blondie.</br></br></br></br>  Is anyone else using ameboide's webcomic reader extension? Seems like it stopped working for bato.to since a few days ago. Won't preload previous or next pages on any mango page  Now Misuzu will try to provoke Tomo to start flirting with Misaki-senpai.  <br>tomo is based and you are wrong</br>  <br>noOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Trips don't lie, Misuzu's reverse psychology NTR keikaku has begun.</br>  <br>Well, I'd certainly be worried if they were busty.</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br> Dat sex hair <br>Nice</br></br>  MISUZU<br>I<br>S<br>U<br>Z<br>U</br></br></br></br></br>  Jesus where are the doujins?  Several seconds in MS paint.  <br><br>Damn Misuzu looks good after being roughed up a bit.</br></br>  <br><br>My god I want fuck the smug out of her<br>IT's so damn sexy and so damn madding</br></br></br>  <br>Is there some unwritten rule that artists don't do doujin's of their original work? The only one I can think of is the Unbalance x Unbalance guy but hes Korean scum.</br>  <br>And by doujin's I mean actual porn.</br>  <br><br>Three hundred years in paint</br></br>  <br>I want to make a mess of her!</br>  <br>Some brave soul needs to draw in blush, sweat, and those breath clouds what indicate heavy breathing.</br>  <br>It gives me trouble regularly in batoto. But I hate batoto normal interface, so I just never go there anymore. <br>Kissmanga for me.</br></br>  What are the chances of this getting serialized somewhere? It seems like something that could be made into an anime.  <br><br>My body couldn't handle it. I wonder if she'd get violent with you, she's shown no signs of actually being violent so far. I'm not sure she would, but I still want her to be mean to me.</br></br>  I need to know, what doujin has the smugest anime girl imaginable?  <br>Not violent, but pushy. Need some fanart of her pulling on a guy's necktie.</br>  <br> that disheveled hair  <br> that strand of hair in her mouth <br>Hold me back niggas. My dick cant take it no more</br></br></br>  I fear the day when we get beach chapters.<br> Tanned Tomo-chan. <br>I don't think my dick and body can take it.</br></br>    <br>im bettig they will follow Jun and see them doing locks and shit</br>  <br> Mizusu in a   white one piece swimsuit </br>    <br><br>I want her to tie me up with a neck tie.</br></br>  <br><br>Anon don't. DON'T<br><br>Someone fucking help me here</br></br></br></br>  <br>My flag stands at full mast.</br>  <br><br>Sweet jesus</br></br>  <br>Add on a 4chan logo and save it for the next time we get new banners.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, this is the third time I've ever had the urge to violently ravage a character,</br>  <br><br>I need to stop browsing these threads at work. Now I can't stand up for the next 20 minutes.</br></br>  <br>If she has abs I swear to Christ.</br>  <br>We should colour it and make the hand grabbing her green.</br>    <br>HNNNNNNNG!</br>   ryona when?   <br>Stop right there you criminal SCUM</br>  <br>Hopefully very soon. There's not enough  ryona  in this world.</br>  <br><br><br><br> sex hair Misuzu </br></br></br></br>  <br>has someone done mayonegg yet?</br>  <br>Evil genius<br><br>I love it</br></br></br>  <br> If she has abs <br>Looks like she does.</br></br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br> dat hair <br> dat everything <br><br>Misuzu is sex</br></br></br></br>  Misuzu is a miracle of the universe  why cant girls like this exist? Fuck!<br><br>Well at least this is gonna get an anime and start a tomboy trend and thats gonna prevent me from killing myself.<br><br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tomboys will never win.</br>  <br>What's horrible is that the only tomboy I can remember winning outside of h is fucking Suzuka.</br>  <br>Incorrect.</br>  <br>Does it really count if the other girl DIED</br>  <br>Yeah, I'd say so.</br>  <br>AND HER DAUGHTER GOT HIT BY A TRUCK AND DIED<br><br>NIGGERSSSSSSSSSSSSS</br></br></br>  <br>Think of it this way - the author didn't want Kaori to win, so she was killed off.<br><br>Alternatively, here's another victorious tomboy.</br></br></br>  <br>I realize now that all I ever want in life is to have a girl bully me.</br>  <br> win the bowl after thirty chapters <br> play in overtime for a hundred more because Seo's a jew <br> finally win for real, have sex once <br> your dad finds out, you nearly have to break up, and also you're pregnant <br> drop out of school to raise kid, abandon career and sport, get ostracized <br> a decade later, Seo makes a new manga and kills the kid you did all that for <br>I'm still convinced that no mangaka has ever done anything worse than this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean<br><br>It's one thing to kill the love interest<br><br>But it's another thing entirely to kill the love interest when she was the daughter of the couple from your own work that's almost a decade old<br><br>That's a special kind of fucked up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>implying your child is more important than your personal career. She took responsibility and did the right thing. There must be something wrong with the world if they think Suzuka did the wrong thing.</br>  <br>I'm not implying that at all. She did the right thing, but it still sucks to be her, and it's still rage-inducing bullshit out of nowhere.</br>  <br>I'm reading this for her</br>  <br>I'd water so hard</br>  <br>that's mizu, faggot</br>  <br>What?<br>I didn't even finish either of those series and I'm still amazed at how anyone could be that cruel.</br></br>  <br>Dick status: MUH AS FUCK</br>  <br>Did you miss the outpouring of rage for Fuuka?</br>  <br>Sometimes during a slow season or there's a high risk of spoilers everywhere i don't bother coming to /a/ very much.</br>  <br>It's not unwritten, it's common sense. If the author draws porn of their original stuff that will become official.</br>  <br>How does common sense make something "written"? Common sense is unwritten by definition.</br>  <br> that hair <br> that smug  <br>Muh dick</br></br></br>  <br>Is that so?</br>  How is Misuzu so sensual? I don't usually go for girls like her but she really does things for me.  boys I need this published so I can buy it, is it a dream or can it happen  <br>Embrace the femdom.</br>  <br>Oh god I didn't notice the hands due to the sheer sex of her face.

She just emanates with a cold, dark, malice. There's no way that shit is just a front. She is pure evil.</br>  <br>I really hope you are right, that's just the best. <br>But I also kinda hope she's secretly into Tomo.</br></br>  5 minute anime when?  <br>I say she's a switch. It makes the most sense.</br>  <br>So perfect.</br>  <br>That'd be great.</br>    Er, what the Hell?<br><br>Why the fuck has another group, "Love Live Scanlations", picked up this series that only has one page per chapter?<br><br>Are some faggots really that impatient that they need to get these "chapters" out a liiiittle faster? This series doesn't even read well as one page per day. What a waste of scanlation resources.</br></br></br></br>  <br>JUST</br>  <br>It doesn't seem to work for this series specifically, because I think the uploaders chose something different when uploading the pages that fucks with it. It works for any other series.</br>  <br>Better have too many than none at all.</br>  <br>Maybe they have better raws?</br>  <br>But anon, there's absolutely nothing that could possibly be a better use of the time! I cannot think of a single important franchise that's never been released in English. Pointless competing for glory is a perfectly good use of time and effort.<br>Pic completely unrelated of course.</br></br>  <br>DO IT</br>  <br>It's a webcomic.</br>  <br>It's a free webcomic, the same and only raws are available to everyone.<br><br>Also this "group" has only picked up this series.<br><br><br>Oh you</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Welcome to the scanlation drama, enjoy your stay.</br>  <br><br>Whoops, my bad.</br></br>  <br>No, I refuse, scanlation drama is retarded and shouldn't even exist. There are so many other series out there that could use scanlation, being some weird egotistical faggot over one very small series is bullshit.<br><br>I also like it that this douche waited until m@sterscans caught up to swoop in like a hero.<br><br>And what's more, now I KNOW this series won't ever be released in English in bulk after a page buildup again, so yay- let's get comfortable with slow threads that retread shit over and over and have nothing to talk about. One page! New thread! Naturally nothing really happened; it's a yonkoma!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just stating a fact. There is nothing that desperately needs a group but lacks one at the moment. Nothing whatsoever. No classics left mostly untranslated after 30 years. No unique and obscure publications completely ignored. This is simply not a thing that happens.</br>  <br>Welcome to the world of pointless scanlation drama, the largest e-penis domain since fansubbing. <br><br>This is why I don't read the forums/PM's on sadpanda. I just put shit out, and if somebody else "had a claim on it!" or "wanted to do it first!" they can cry into a blanket because I don't give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Thing is it's just pointless to translate something someone's already translating since there is a LOT out there that still needs translating.<br><br>There are only a few times it's really acceptable, and all of them concern when the group/person "already doing it" is doing a bad job, be it at cleaning, typesetting, translating, or speed/</br></br></br>  <br>You need to lurk moar on mangaupdates.</br>  <br>I think the 'claiming' thing is fine as long as it's a competent group. Avoiding pileups of 30 people releasing the same thing is good, but making a big epeen argument out of it is not.</br>  <br>no one wants to translate your ancient manga granpa. go back to your coffin</br>  <br>In relation to?<br><br>Patlabor is my go-to example due to the popularity and importance of the IP, the fact that it was dropped by its original English publisher and that it's had an official release in virtually every other language but there are a lot of things that have suffered a similar fate.</br></br></br>    <br>People just make threads every now and then when something interesting happens in this (i.e. Mizusas sex hair). It works fine</br>  I don't get what's Jun's deal.<br>At first I thought he really doesn't see Tomo as a girl, but I don't understand his reactions in the umbrella and panties scenes.<br>Why is such a shock or why is he trying to ignore so much the fact her friend is a girl?<br><br>My theory is that he actually acknowledges that she's a girl due to the scenes in pic related.<br>It's obvious that he knew Tanabe's intentions and hurt his hand.<br>Also got mad at Misuzu for implying she could get a boyfriend and defended Tomo from the pervert.<br><br>I think he's actually in love with her but he doesn't realize it's mutual, so instead of taking the risk of being rejected he prefers to keep being close to Tomo as her "bro".<br>Evil Queen Misuzu realizes this and is making harder for him to keep his facade, hoping he ends cornered by his feelings and is forced to be honest with Tomo.<br><br>Either that or I don't get why it's such a big problem for him to see Tomo as a girl.<br>Thoughts?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this theory, but I also love the idea of Jun being absolutely clueless, it's cute in it's own way.</br>  <br>Is it really that hard to understand? He's been friends with her forever and always treated her like his best bro, because they always acted manly and did manly things together. Now he's starting to recognize her femininity, but he doesn't want to feel that way about his bro. He wants their normal relationship to continue on as it has because it's worked out so far. It's been more or less outright confirmed that he's putting up an act.<br><br>On the other hand, he is aware that Tomo is a girl, and he's defensive about other guys being around her. He's walking a line where as much as he doesn't want their relationship to change, he also doesn't want somebody else swooping in on her romantically.</br></br></br>  <br>You can explain away most of them, but pushing Misuzu into the rain pretty much confirms that it's more complex than just thickness.</br>  <br>Bakawaii</br>  <br> Thoughts? <br><br>You made too long of a post for something simple that only takes a sentence or two. This isn't Shakespeare anon, you don't need so many words to say "he sees her as a girl but wants to keep being just friends", anyone with two brain cells put together can see that he's not just being dense.</br></br></br>  <br> You made too long of a post for something simple that only takes a sentence or two. This isn't Shakespeare anon, you don't need so many words <br>Unrelated but I know, I've always had that problem.<br>Try to explain something and end up making walls that nobody wants to read.<br>I'm horrible when it comes to summarize things.<br>Sorry.<br><br>Anyway my point isn't that he wants to keep being friends, but the reason for that:<br>He actually likes her but keeps the "bro" thing because he's afraid of being rejected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man what's this tl'dr post? He obviously thirsts to see her awkwardly light up like a christmas tree every time he plays the neutron star and throws himself onto her or sniffs her or whatever. Dat tomboy blush is amazing, that's why you're here.</br>  I want to push Misuzu into the rain and make her sit in cold, wet clothes all day while I flick her forehead until it's red.  <br>And then hold her hand?</br>  <br>shake her dry</br>  <br> Thoughts? <br>you have autism</br></br>  <br>explain</br>  <br>I want to push Misuzu into the rain in a way that it looks like an accident and then invite her to dry off at my place since it's nearby and to make up for my clumsiness. Then while she's there I'll  do nothing out of the ordinary because I'm happy to just spend time together. </br>  <br>You rant too much for small shit, you're focusing on an unimportant place and things like that I guess? Not even the same anon but when someone says things like this  you probably need to evaluate yourself a bit.</br>  Who do you think misuzu should be voiced by, if it were to get an anime?  <br> not handing her a bowl of eggs <br>anon you had one job and you blew it</br></br>  <br>Saori Gotou or Nakahara Mai</br>  <br> Hanazawa Kana  for Misuzu.<br> Kamiya Hiroshi  voices Jon.</br></br>  <br>kana ueda</br>  <br>I could see it.</br>  <br>Inoue Marina.</br>  <br>KANA FINDS A WAY</br>  <br>I don't get this, I kinda liked reading some guy's write-up.</br>  <br> You rant too much for small shit <br>You think I'm mad over a 4koma?<br>What the fuck.<br>I just wanted to start a conversation.<br><br>And I already answered that person saying that I know I'm not good summarizing.<br><br>Someone replies with "autism" and his only reason is that the other guy wrote a "tl;dr" post not even that long?<br>I don't know if he's trying to stick by spouting buzzwords, but he's the one that needs to evaluate himself.<br>Holy shit I wasn't mad but now I am.<br>You try to clearly explain a point of view and someone calls you autist because is a bit long.<br>You have problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're taking the bait</br>  <br>Norio Wakamoto</br>  <br>you must be one of these hidden geniuses i keep hearing about</br>  <br> I wasn't mad but now I am. <br>That's the point faggot.

Does she have a concussion from getting hit in club?</br>  <br>Go to bed Shirou.</br>  <br>I still prefer Tomo but goddamn that Misuzu. <br>Tomo is for marriage but Misuzu is for passionate, extremely rough sex.</br></br>   <br>Tomo is for friendship. Misuzu is for marriage that involves frequent passionate, extremely rough sex.</br>  <br>survival is a winning strategy</br>  <br><br>I am very conflicted on this.<br>I want to break Misuzu's shell, but I also like Tomo.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Misuzu has a shell <br>You saw how badly she reacted to the news of molestation. Her shell was taken against her will.</br></br>  <br>Anon, please. Everyone has a shell they show to the world. People are like onions. They have layers. If one of them gets stripped away there'll always be more under that.

Twitter says 2 hours ago. <br><br>any Rawfag there?</br></br></br>  <br>And reminder that a fiancée is not a fiancé. Unless they're refering the prince as a girl.</br>  <br>i'm a huge vanilla-fag but why this shit makes me so hard ?</br>  <br/>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>I've just read this. I need more long necked girls in my life.</br>  <br> Who what kind of girl is it that you wanted to fight? <br> Is she strong? <br> Uhhhm, I heard from Misuzu that <br> she's about as strong as a gorilla. <br> As girl... as strong as a gorilla? <br> (Could it be) <br> Sounds pretty strong. <br> Yeah. <br> But I'll win. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, based anon</br>  What's with this retarded Love Live / M@S pissing content?  <br>I heard it's because this Love Live Scanlations guy got super salty because of some other drama that happened some months ago between him and masterscans, and he did it to get revenge or something.</br>  <br>There's a pissing contest? i just go with love live because I prefer their translation.</br>  <br>So butthurt</br>    <br>I think he doesn't want to recognise her as a girl, because he feels that if he did, he'd lose his best bro. He doesn't want his buddy-buddy bro friendship to change.<br><br>That's also why he didn't like it when she took off her spats, or when her shirt got wet and he could see her bra. Because in those moments he couldn't see her as anything other than a beautiful woman. And that felt bad and awkward for him, maybe a bit like if you saw your sister naked or something.</br></br></br>  why are feisty redheads so delicious?  <br>Oh lordy, this shit is soo good.</br>  <br>She reminds me of Locon's trap.</br>  <br>She won by default, the best kind of winning.</br>  <br> no one tweeted him this yeet </br>  <br>You should  ask the one who made that or just do it yourself. </br>   thread is STILL up  <br>Is this the magic of Misuzu?</br>  <br><br>Would you want to disappoint your queen by letting her thread die?</br></br>  <br>Never. <br>Post more Misuzu, until the sun dies and the stars burn out.</br></br>  <br>But slowly enough so that you don't hit the post/image limit too soon.</br>  <br>Then we'll just create another thread, and another.</br>  <br>Yes, but this was in reference to this particular thread staying alive.</br>  I almost fell off my chair.  <br>With every passing day my desire to fuck the smug out of her gets more urgent.</br>  <br>You're doing it wrong.If you go that route you've got to try to fuck the smug out of her only to fail as it only make her more smug that you are her eternal plaything.</br>  <br><br>I want her to have her way with me and eventually start holding back so she has to beg to carry on.<br><br>That probably wouldn't work with her, but at least it would make her be meaner to me which would be nice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was secretly my keikaku all along.</br>  <br> implying every single detail in your life wasn't arranged to manipulate you into fucking her </br>  <br>You could temporarily fuck the smug out of her. Eventually she'll sleep or pass out. You just have to outlast her. Then you can cuddle.</br>  <br>Yeah, aggressiveness isn't the answer in this case.<br><br>It'd probably be easier to break her composure with sheer amounts of pure love. Maybe even  hand holding .</br></br></br>  <br>That girl can keep up with Tomo and Jun. There's no way you can outlast her.</br>  <br>I am incredibly okay with that.<br><br><br> outlast her  <br>Misuzu would fuck long and hard etc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Love will find a way.</br></br>  HE DREW UMARU-CHANG  <br> draw Umaru <br> didn't draw based Taihei Onii-chan <br><br><br>dropped</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one is Ameri? The picked-up loli?</br>  <br> dat skirt length <br>P U R E<br>U<br>R<br>E</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit. The anime looks the same as the manga. I cant' wait.</br>  <br>So, being a flatypus makes Misuzu insecure?</br>  <br>CUTE</br>  <br>I don't think Misuzu cares about such trivialities. <br> At least not openly. </br></br>  <br><br>Don't need to. Through dick, unity.</br></br>  <br><br>I haven't drawn anything in years, but Misuzu-chan does things for me.</br></br>  I want to see Misuzu slavsquat  <br>my dick says YES</br>  <br> dat smug  <br>You did good, Anon.</br></br>  bump  <br>This.<br>Although he's still an idiot for not realizing she's suffering and it's his fault.</br></br>  More Misuzu, my dick demands it.  <br>Are you some kind of idiot?</br>  <br><br>Mine is working fine</br></br>  I am trying to imagine what Misuzu must sound like. She must have a voice like pure sex, but she would never speak with a raised voice. How to get the right level of smugness without crossing the line to being condescending? <br>Who could even be her voice actress?</br>  <br>The girl who did Shinoa from owari no seraph maybe?</br>  <br>She's smug-chan, but not in the same way. Misuzu can't possibly sound that high-pitched.</br>  The closest I can think of is Takayama Minami when she voiced Natsumi Tendo in Ranma 1/2.<br>No high pitched voices.</br>  <br>I want  Saito or Sawashiro </br>  <br>Sawashiro should be cuntslut AND Tomo<br>10/10 AOTYAY</br></br>  <br> everyone is sawashiro <br> 23 minutes of her talking to herself in different voices <br>I'd watch it.</br></br></br>  <br> 23 minutes <br> implying it won't be 2-3 minutes shorts. </br></br>  <br> shorts <br> not a series of half a dozen full length feature films </br></br>  <br>give me a minute</br>  <br><br>This. No ones body could handle 23 minutes of Misuzu.</br></br>  <br>I'm willing to risk trying.</br>  <br>I'd love to try, though.</br>  <br><br><br>As would I.</br></br></br>  <br>I want that hairband so bad.</br>  <br>For what?  Tying your dick? </br>  <br><br>You could steal it. I bet it would smell like nice shampoo.</br></br>  I hope Tomo will suddenly confront Carol and say something like "stay away from jun, he's mine"  <br>I just want to smell it.</br>  <br>Jerk myself off with it.</br>  <br>that's lewd</br>  <br>What a fag.</br>  <br>NO SHIT SHERLOCK</br>  <br>This is good.</br>  <br> tfw no doujins <br>The rising urge make hate love sex is slowly killing me.</br></br>  WAIT IT'S THE SAME AUTHOR?<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/717794/66e5f1<wbr>ad4f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/569582/d08422<wbr>357a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/557370/b268d9<wbr>2068/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>But the best part is when your body gives out and she keeps going.</br>  <br>If the name didn't give it away, yes.</br>  <br>I don't really remember artists names</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Mayu's story best story.</br>  <br>His other material is to vanilla for my tastes. Besides, Misuzu is more sex than all of his other hentai combined.</br>  <br> that Umaru butt </br>  <br>Japs sure love their handheld consoles.</br>  <br>Day late but if you're using Batoto it tries to load this comic as those long strip manwhas (Since it's tagged as webcomic). There should be an option to change so you see it page for page. I think it reverts back to normal after a chapter though, not sure.</br>  I hope the Misuzu doujins won't be just femdom with no reciprocation, the best thing about her is she says stuff because she wants to be roughed up.  <br>Her respective boy needs some more screentime before I can properly deduce what kind of doujins I want of her.</br>  <br> respective boy <br> implying she doesn't want Tomo <br>Don't ruin it, it's perfect in my head.</br></br></br>   fags have turned Tomo threads into misuzu circlejerk bullshit <br>You should all be ashamed of yourselves. You're the same people who post Yamada in Working threads. You are bad people</br>  <br> implying she doesn't have some sort of complex about Gundou </br>  <br>/u/, please. Take off your goggle or bring it to your own board.</br>  <br><br>I will retain my irrational and unadulterated rage towards both of your kind  especially the yurifag  because Tomo-chan threads should be peaceful.<br><br><br>That is the most accurate comparison I've ever heard, good job anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Post about Tomo then rather than complaining. Misuzu is more fun to speculate on right now because she's trying to play the puppet master with them all.</br></br>  <br> Boo-Hoo my favorite girl isn't being talked about. <br><br>Stuff it. This thread is for discussion on all the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>That's okay anon. All of us work as an ecosystem keeping threads lively for a 4koma</br>  <br><br>I know, I know, I'm sorry, I'll keep my /u/shit in check.<br>So, will Tomo misunderstand things horribly  because of Misuzu  and try to fight the bong girl?</br></br></br>  <br>I hadn't realized that "I want Misuzu to [x] my [y]" ad nasuem for hours was discussion</br>  <br>I hope so. I want to see Tomo destroy some fools again</br>  <br> destroy some fools <br>Oh my. Some drawfag PLEASE give me a Mr. T(omo)</br></br>  <br>She pity tha fool who try to mack on her Gundou</br>  <br>Great hyperbole. Maybe you should step away from the thread and live your life for awhile. There's just as much Tomo love as there is for Misuzu. I'm a Tomofag too.</br>  Misuzu remind me of this bed tiger  <br>One boy should make such a good girl</br>  <br>Of course he should.<br><br>Pixiv even has a tag for that:<br> So cute it couldn't possibly be a guy </br></br></br></br>  <br> There's just as much Tomo love as there is for Misuzu <br>This is such an absurd lie it makes you look deluded</br></br>  <br>This thread has been alive for 36+ hours and the last 6 has been talk about Misuzu. Therefore thread ruined.<br><br>What others are saying isn't stopping people who like Tomo from speaking up. Your just complaining for complaining-sake.</br></br></br>  <br>This thread has more content than the manga</br>  <br>Yeah. Because it's a page a day with one artist. There are 183 IP's posting in this thread.</br>  <br>Just pair her with Jun like the rest of us.</br>  <br> not self-insert POV doujin </br>  <br> locons tsundere traps <br><br>jesus my dick.</br></br></br>  <br>Anything that isn't MisuzuxJun hatefuck is objectively wrong.  Unless it's TomoxJun </br>  <br>I'd sooner kill myself, but not before getting 50 different other groups to TL it at once so that the ensuing drama causes none of them to.</br>  I want a doujin with MisuzuxJun hatesex while Tomo watches.  <br><br>That's cruel. It has to end with TomoxJun. I want Misuzu to make Jun realize its Tomo he really wants.</br></br>  <br>but how will they have HILARIOUS MISUNDERSTANDINGS if she does that?</br>  <br>Tomo can join in afterwards.</br>  <br>I was thinking the exact same thing.</br>  <br>You people are intolerably lewd.</br>  <br><br>No, it must end in cute, slightly awkward, tomboy loving.</br></br>  <br>Can you blame me anon? Tell me you wouldn't do the same thing.</br>  <br> Can you blame me Anon?  <br>No, the heart wants what it wants.</br></br>    <br><br>I'm not sure its his heart that's guiding him.</br></br>  <br>It's the heart of his dick and the dick of his heart, Anon.</br>  <br>The heart has to agree with the dick, otherwise it wouldn't send so much blood to it.</br>  <br><br><br>I never knew /a/ had such a romantic side.</br></br></br>  <br>Hard to explain in this case because it's not unwritten really. More of an "Do not fucking do this" that is confined within a company rule book for example.<br><br>We can take the artists working with Wakfu, that division started drawing the characters in really really lewd situations. Management had to come down and tell them to stop because if the images got spread outside the offices it would be deemed official and the top brass has to take the fall for not being able to have their workers under control.<br><br>It's a form of preemptive damage control if shit would hit the fan and the images would leak. I don't know when this started but I do know Disney had/have a strict "Do not share lewds with the public" when they first started.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Screencapped for posterity.</br></br></br>  <br>HNNNG<br>Every time.</br></br>  <br>S-superior version!</br>  <br>I don't like his porn</br>  Because there weren't enough.  <br> tsundere <br>Is it? It's not like he has genuine affection for any of his costumers, he just wants to fuck and be a tease while doing so.<br>Gotta say that the whole "cocksure" routine coming from a trap is refreshing in eromanga compared to ultra-submissive ones<br><br> jesus my dick. <br>Her designs are instaboner.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My guess it feels really gay when your best (male) childhood friend suddenly grows huge boobs and starts wearing skirts.</br>  <br><br>I came for the tomboy, but I stayed for the Misuzu. And then I came for the Misuzu.</br></br>  <br>She was more of a short-haired moeblob.<br><br>Pic related is best tomboy.</br></br></br>  Wait did people seriously not know that Tomo-chan spawned from this?  <br>no, what in the world is this?</br>  These threads have proven to me that NTRfags are cancer in the purest form.  <br>I just read that. I want to see more of the in between period of their relationship. Going from bully to bullier right away was boring.</br>  <br>This.<br><br><br>Pleb</br></br></br></br>  <br>It took these threads to prove that to you? That's something you should learn in like the first week on /a/.</br>  Thoughts? would you read if it get's translated? Mayuri Cameo in main series when? isn't she cute?  There will never be an adaptation of Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 3rei!!. Think about that.<br><br>Seriously, how many series get S4s?</br></br>  A lot, if they were as good as Illya.  Shit series, which is why Illya might just get one.  That's gonna suck for animeonlyfags who'll get fucked by that cliffhanger at the end of Zwei Herz  <br>Bro, this is Fate. Of course it's gonna get adapted.</br>  <br>They could pretty easily do an anime original ending.</br>  But Angelica.

As part of this program she pleases old men for money and that's how.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess who got a card-design in Grand Order and who didn't<br> Even Atomic Gatorade is more important than Luvia </br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>  pleases old professors for scholarships  </br></br>  She forces Shirou to work for her.  <br>Wait... is she pimping?</br>  <br>Fucking bourgeoisie<br> If only she wasn't as cute </br></br>  <br> pleases old men for money <br> forces her boyfriend to please old men for money <br>Why is Rin such a bitch?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course only Rin would do that</br>  Why is Luvia so slutty, bros?  <br>She has to release it somehow so it doesn't get pent up.

What is this I am seeing here?</br>  backgroundfu is back, she's in fucking everything in this show, does she become more of a MC later?  <br> if you want to talk about feminism go to /pol/ <br>Yeah I heard they love feminism and Jews.</br></br>  <br>See:<br><br>Basically almost-rape, but played for laughs</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody mentioned Jews. What do you have against Jews? <br><br>Anti-semite.</br></br></br>  <br>They sure do love talking about them.</br>  <br>Shimoneta is actually about politics, you mong.</br>  <br>She's like those backgrounds lesbos in Hanayamata.<br>No lines.</br></br>  <br>they'll have lengthy discussions about it</br>  <br>i'd only eat ayame's love flavored cookies</br>  <br>I don't understand. Surely Anna is a man, since I have been taught that only men are rapists, and all men are rapists. He is probably raping her. Probably fed her a date-rape drug.

I wasn't sure if it's her. Now that I think about it, she was also there the first time the scientautist attacked his pelvic region.</br>  <br>Because if he begin to fuck girls this would be hentai.</br>  <br><br> literally </br></br>  <br><br> Anon used the word correctly given the context she is indeed actively seeking his dick <br> huurrrrr of all the words you can use in a figurative sense, 'literally' is the one word out of every fucking word in the dictionary you're not allowed to use cause it triggers me </br></br></br>  <br>If pic related isn't literally lusting after dick, I don't know what is.</br>  <br><br>It's hear breaking his chastity belt.<br><br>He put it on himself because he was afraid of what he might do if he was alone with Anna.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't that hurt?</br>  Anyone know when the ED album comes out? It's pretty addicting to listen to.  <br>Not as much as the violent raping he'd be getting if he didn't have it on. Imagine death by Snusnu, but instead of a shattered pelvis, there's a 300 mile hole beneath where your dick used to be before it was obliterated from raw, hardcore sex.</br>  <br><br>if the chastity belt is made of metal, I don't know why it should hurt</br></br>  <br>Not worth the itch that comes along with the regrowth.</br>  Kajo a pure  <br>What the fuck is wrong with your hair?</br>  <br>Is it that weird to shave your balls daily?</br>  <br>How many times are you going to post this today?</br>  <br>Actually, I'm a different anon.</br>  Are there any other anime like Shimoneta that depict what it would be like if it were illegal to be politically incorrect? I like watching MSNBC, CNN, and reading Salon, Daily Beast, Washington Post, Huffington Post, etc., so this anime really clicks with me.  <br>I don't feel any itch</br>  <br>Shimoneta's basically SYD V.9 with terrorism add-ons installed.</br>  <br> thinking that two anime are similar just because they make dirty jokes <br>Anon, please. The children's board is that way ---&gt; </br></br>  <br>As much as I love Vilma, I wouldn't trust her anywhere near me scrotum with a razor.</br>  So now that Anna has finally begun her downward spiral, how long until she hits rock bottom? <br><br>Sniffing boxers should be next episode, followed by love honey. How far will she go?</br></br>  <br><br>Would you eat Anna's love honey, anon?</br></br>  <br> me scrotum <br>Are you a pirate?</br></br>  <br>It's thick and rough.<br><br><br> I dunno, but I'm too lazy for that. <br><br><br>Lucky you I guess, after kinda a week the itch is unbearable.<br><br> Actually, when I first shaved and felt the itch, worried I asked in a trap thrad on /b/ and they told me the itch is normal </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would eat it from the source, and then help her fix her plumbing to quit leaking so much.</br>  Am I the only one getting an 80's vibe from this show?<br>I know there shouldn't be any reason, but expecially OP with the narrated introduction and ED have something that feels like the 80's, andit's driving me crazy.</br>  <br>Blame the nonsensical plot. If the show had older designs and that 80s-90s grainy look, it'd fit right in.</br>  How can she be so much best girl?  <br>That voice does funny things to my dOck.<br>Actually, that everything makes funny things to my dOck.</br></br>  <br> how long until she hits rock bottom? <br>The better question is, what will her rock bottom be? Utter sexual liberation? Race-mixing? Cuckolding?</br></br>  <br> Anna cucks MC for Ayame </br>  <br><br>Anons, you read my mind. I was about to say the same things. Her and her voice is fucking great.</br></br>  <br><br><br>A-am I the only one who hates her voice?<br><br>It's really raspy and coarse. Her seiyuu needs to lay off the sin sticks.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw i thought this anime was gonna be shit   <br><br><br><br>I will never understand you people.<br><br><br>No, you're not the only one. That voice also coming out of what looks like a toddler gives my brain whiplash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I usually hate voices like hers but I don't know why or how, but she does it perfectly and I love it.</br></br>  <br>It's just plain perfection. Her voice gives me instant boners.</br>  <br><br>How the fuck does a voice give you a boner?<br><br>You can't fap to seiyuus, anon.</br></br></br></br>  Listening to Kajo spout lewd things is the highlight of my Saturdays.  <br>She's literally Kuroko, toddler edition. I hate Kuroko even more than this character though, cause at least she a rape-machine in Shimoneta.</br>  <br>You see that squat. <br><br>She obviously a slav.</br></br></br>    <br> How the fuck does a voice give you a boner? <br>I don't know, but Satomi Arai and and Matsuki Miyu does those things to my dick.</br></br>  <br>I can't get enough of that face. I want her to abuse me.</br>  <br>It ain't gonna suck itself.jpg</br>  <br> Listening to Kajo spout lewd things <br><br>Those are censored. How do you enjoy those things?</br></br></br>  <br>How did Anna get a hold of MC's boxers?</br>  <br><br>Would you let Kajo fuck your mouth and force you to swallow her cum?</br></br>  <br>her face reminds me of a character from a doujin but I can't remember the damn doujin</br>  <br> She's literally Kuroko, toddler edition <br>Anon, she's obviously Dark Nonon.</br></br>  <br> hating lolis </br>  <br>Kajou is perfect.</br>  <br> Not getting a boner from Watamoto's voice. </br>  Give me your worst  <br>I would. No homo.</br>  <br>Garden Eel<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tld<wbr>-I5MMbCY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>What's the sub font?</br>  <br>I think they are gym shorts?</br>  <br> Isn't a rape-machine <br><br>Ugh. fucking typos.<br><br><br>I have no hatred for lolis, just this particular seiyuu's typecasting of them. Seriously, how many times can Satomi Arai play the same abrasive lesbian loli tragically attracted to a non-lesbian that has no interest in her?<br><br>Bring me more loli vampire ojou-samas though please. Those are my loli flavour of choice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funimation Sans Serif Bold</br>  <br><br>I decided not to drop this show because she showed up at the end of episode 2</br></br>  Haven't been in any of the threads until now. So Anna pretty much becomes an obsessive yandere for MC after this?<br> I like it. </br>  <br>Those are clearly boxers anon.</br>    <br>More like a obsessive turboslut.</br>    <br>Anna becomes obsessed with MC, and is only a smidgen Yandere.<br><br>First she will smell his sweaty shorts, and next thing you know she is baking him cookies with her love honey.<br><br>She goes off the deep end quick, that's for sure. Mom would be proud.</br></br></br></br></br>  I wish sexy terrorists were a thing instead of the allahu akbar ones we get  <br>Is the new episode out?</br>    <br>I need a gif of that desk rumble</br>  This show is categorically immoral and wrong. <br><br>Rape is defined to be obtaining carnal knowledge of a women forcibly and against her will. Tanukichi Okuma literally raped Anna Nishikinomiya, and Anna's response is that she enjoyed the rape, please can she have some more. <br><br>Does no one else see a problem here?<br><br>We should seriously consider writing JC Staff to, at the very least, express that the international community frowns upon the allowance of this depravity, and that that aforementioned depravity plays a causal role in the aetiology of cultural decline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   He sees your dick   <br>Yes, and then ask directly from the source.</br>  <br>God damn it /pol/, I hate SJWs as much as you but can you fuck off to your own board?</br>  <br> Tumblr <br> Rape is wrong <br><br>Do you even try</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anna liked getting "raped" by MC's lips.</br>  <br><br><br> introducing the joys and wonders of lewdness to a pure-hearted maiden. <br><br>My fucking FETISH!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it is, now enjoy  my personal favorite  girl.</br>  <br>Why would you do this, Anon?</br>  Will you tell here the secrets of reproduction?  <br>What does Anna's love honey taste like.</br>  <br>sure<br><br>for a price</br></br></br>  <br>This is my fetish</br>  <br>Superior webm format</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  my<br><br>fucking<br><br>DICK</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will you settle for a demonstration?</br>  <br>Why wouldn't I ?</br>  <br>are they getting lewder?</br>  <br>The other one in the gif I replied to.</br>  <br><br>dammit guy i wasnt paying attention</br></br>    Watching Anna discover sexual pleasure gives me the greatest boner.  <br> they get lewder as the episodes go on and they discover their sexuality <br><br>Makes sense.</br></br></br>  Am I the only one who wanted to see Anna win?<br><br>I want to see Anna's punishment for Kajo.</br></br>  <br> Anna discovers S&amp;M and begins to discipline Kajo, Gorilla, and MC with her tremendous Slav strength. </br>  <br><br> we can get even lewder than what we already have <br><br>impossible... unless...<br><br>no... they wouldnt air...  hand holding?? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See Anna win what, exactly?<br><br>If you are interested in the actual politics in this anime, you'll have to wait for Anna's mom to show up. She's the real boss character, not Anna. Anna is just a girl MC corrupts, which is later played for DRAMA.</br></br></br>  <br>Type more. Type until you exhaust your entire stock of ellipses.</br>  <br><br>literally the most sexually appealing thing i've ever seen aired on japanese television<br><br>is there ANY greater self-gratification than watching this unfold before me<br><br>i dont think so</br></br></br></br></br></br>   ITALY VIA AIR   <br>Capitalise your sentences</br>  <br> played for drama <br><br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Big tit small history or some shit like that?</br>  <br>capitalizing is for losers</br>    <br><br> "Tonight our special is a thick, steamy wiener. Enjoy." </br></br>  <br><br>punctuate yours first, bitch</br></br>  <br>Yes. Anna and her mother Sophia are basically the only non-comic relief characters in the story for several volumes.<br><br>Shit will be going down in later episodes, once Anna has hit rock bottom.</br></br></br>  <br>Alright.<br>Capitalize your sentences.</br></br>  <br>I see, should be interesting then. Hopefully the show can transition well to drama.</br>  <br><br> n  o </br></br>  satomi arai hit the ballpark on Otome it was like this character was made FOR HER to voice personally  <br>Neck yourself.</br>  <br>Please tell me Anna will find Happiness. She is my favorite.</br>  <br>Messalianism. It's pretty great!</br>  <br>does scientist girl ever become relevant?</br>  <br> not mentioning "rape culture" <br>One job.</br></br>  <br>It isn't a full blown genre shift, but I suspect a few episodes will be at least somewhat serious in tone. The show will always remain light-hearted though, even if/when Anna's family skeletons get revealed.<br><br>You can see Anna's mom in the OP. She's like Yukino's mom: bad news.</br></br></br>    <br>God, I hope so.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dp5<wbr>Qf6cjrqY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>does ayame or mc develop feelings for eachother</br>  <br>Was Anna's mom a pornstar?</br>  <br>That....is actually a good question. I guess the author's just felt like giving a reason to put in this scene.</br>  Can you imagine sex with Otome Saotome?<br><br>That voice is a complete boner killer.</br></br>  Prison school is better than this shit.  <br>It might have looked weird for a guy and a girl to be hiding around in the bushes.</br>  Kajo is the best girl of the season.  why are people mad with this show? <br><br>i like it, it's fun</br></br>  <br>No comment.<br><br><br>Not particularly. <br><br><br>Maybe.<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd with the force of a thousand suns as soon as she says something</br>  Damn, Anna got kissed once and she turned into a cock hungry slut.<br><br>Low test waifu, impure as fuck<br><br><br>true</br></br></br></br></br>  we tittymonster now?  <br>when does this chick get involved, and in what capacity? She makes my dick explode.</br>  <br>Are they? I hid and filtered that one post about politics in the beggining and the thread has been mostly chill.</br>  <br>Don't be a faggot anon. We all know that Prison School had the smallest budget out of all the anime from JC Staff this season. I love the manga but the anime didn't do any justice to it.</br>  <br>Volume 8<br><br>Just another slut in training thanks to MC's hard work at corrupting shoujos</br></br></br>  <br>will the show contain the scene where anna bakes her pussy juice into some cookies for tanukichi, oh wise one?</br>  <br>Thank you based Tanukichi</br>    <br>It's hard to say, really. That "drop of water" in the ED seems to imply that the love honey cookies will be in the show.<br><br>We'll see. It should happen in a couple episodes if they keep up the pace (just started vol2 this ep).</br></br></br>  <br>I like both. Come at me</br>    <br><br><br><br> "We want the Hex Maniac audience" <br><br>My dick thanks you J.C.

I am happy with anything and I barely request as it is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br><br>you can do one of mine</br></br>  <br>Mmuda!</br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  I have Sayla preordered.  <br>That is one pretty figure.</br>  maybe one day i'll finish gundam. then i can move onto zeta  <br>Then you can watch the true masterpiece, ZZ.</br>  https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order<wbr>/detailPage/item?itemCode=101386728<wbr>2&amp;ref=list<br><br>Version 2 coming too I bet.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  I got something a little different from the usual buyfaggotry in the mail today. My Takarajima (Treasure Island) animation cel arrived today. Cels from Takarajima are really hard to find. I've only been able to find one site that has them, they only had a small selection.  <br>Anime ja nai!</br>  <br>I never said it was.</br>  <br>Its Ple</br>  <br>I thought turn A was the masterpiece</br>  <br>I watched about 16 episodes, it's kinda stupid and the mecha designs are awful. At least Laura is cute.</br>  <br>Good to know the site's at least legit.</br>  <br>Don't you already have a few of these?<br><br>Anyways, they're not uncool. Congratulations on your finds.</br></br></br>  Can't stop thinking about this beauty.  <br>So many gatari characters, I don't know if I should buy them all or none at all.</br>  <br>How about you only buy Kissshot and Shinobu.</br>  <br>Right now I have both ougi and kiss-shot on preorder. You just gotta get both.</br>   moving out because you can't bear the shame of your figure collection of half naked women to your family   <br>I already preordered Kissshot. I'm considering Nadeko.</br>  I didn't see anything in the guide related to managing finances related to figure purchases. I was wondering how you guys keep track of how much you will owe per month and all that.<br><br>Thinking about making a simple Excel file, but I was curious to see if anyone here does anything different.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate Ougi but this is really nice.<br><br>Such a strange conflict.</br></br></br>  <br> not hiding your figure collection in your closet in led lit deltofs </br>  But what if I only want GAR things?  <br> still living with your parents when buying that shit <br>damn you really fucked up</br></br>  <br>Nope, this is my first cel.<br><br><br>Yeah, they were pretty fast with shipping too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm the only one who thinks this will bin?<br><br>Just going by MFC numbers, there's 1k people with her on pre-order, then add the Japanse and the number can grow 3 times more or so, yet she's still available fucking everywhere. Kinda feel this is going to end up like Mikasa, shit ton of people with her, yet it never ran out of stock and now is selling for like 6k.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just display them anyway</br>  <br>whatever</br>  <br>Work is less than 30 minutes away and I live here rent free while paying student loans.<br><br>Seems dumb to move out. Besides the obvious shame.<br><br><br>Could try this.<br><br><br>You are a better man than I.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it might be a case of them overestimating the popularity and making too many, or it's just been SO LONG since it was announced nobody cares any more<br><br>... or they're just waiting for kizu to air then it'll be super popular - himouto stuff on amiami went from nothing to the 5 most popular spots after the first episode aired so it can happen if SHAFT actually fucking finish it</br></br></br>  <br>Even though you ask, it's not like there is any solid alternative to an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>I recall many people here manage their orders on Excel. It's easy to make and use.</br></br></br>    Anybody else getting the pink version? I'd prefer the original version but I missed out on it. Pink hair looks alright to though.  <br>I used one for about a month and stopped. I don't see the point unless you spend a huge amount every month or are really poor.</br>  <br>who wants a gomora?</br>  Does anyone have experience with those $15-25 chinese knockoff oppai/butt mousepads form ebay?<br>Not expecting them to be anywhere near official ones, but are they at least serviceable?</br>  <br>Get the best one.</br>  <br>I like Ultraman, so this and the Baltan have me kind of tempted, but I don't collect girl figures.</br>  <br><br>I use Excel, I got a job exclusively to maintain this hobby, so it helps me keep track of how much am I going to spend each month and if I can spend more if anything goes up without warning.</br></br>  <br>How about you just buy an official one?</br>  <br><br>I don't known the character and I usually don't like male figures, but that one looks pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>Wow<br><br>super cute</br></br></br>  <br>I have the original, but I can't decide if I want to buy this one, or not.</br>  <br>It's just aesthetically pleasing, don't mind the the character.</br>  <br>the only official ones that interest me are in the hands of scalpers and cost about 3 times as much as I'm willing to pay.</br>  <br>How is the original anyways? Besides being over hyped, did it turn out alright?</br>  <br><br>Dat ass so phat, even the skirt clings to it.</br></br>  <br> did it turn out alright? <br><br>It turned out pretty great. <br><br>http://toy-navi.net/archives/441507<wbr>55.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are probably made by the same chink as the official ones</br>  <br>That is super lewd.</br>  <br>Looks like I'm getting the strawberry version then.</br>   I missed preorders <br><br>Do you think there will be any Rankos after she gets released?</br></br>    <br>That's a tiny butt.</br>  <br><br>But it looks firm and tight, those are the properties of a good butt.</br></br>  <br>I think it could use a little more depth.</br>  Please sell on the PLUM shop so someone can sell this.  <br>This is the only worst girl worth getting.</br>  <br>Yes, preorders have been closed for months.</br>  <br>I buy too much with my dick. I have a thing for lolis in bathing suits / bikinis or lewder.</br>  <br> not putting them back in their packaging and hiding them in the closet every time you leave the house </br>  <br>I think it looks good.</br>  <br>are you me</br>  Is the Doflamingo figure worth the extra $40 to pre-order the European special edition of Pirate Warriors 3 or does it look like shit?  <br>It's not a bad figure but I don't want to support Date a Live since I hate haremshit. Tsunako's talent is wasted on it. Going to get the Black Heart figure though.</br>  <br>No other places open for them? I checked everything in the guide.<br><br>Here's hoping that some fags dont pay for her when she comes out or she gets a rerelease.</br></br></br>  <br>How is it haremshit if Touka is guaranteed towin?</br>  <br>Read the guide.</br>  <br> Tsunako's talent is wasted on it <br>You mean on nepshit.<br><br>DAL girls are much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying your parents won't visit now and then anyway <br>there's no escape.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck, I want this.</br></br>  <br> I hate haremshit <br>pleb taste</br></br>  <br> that face <br> worth getting </br></br>  <br>Will someone please tell me what anime she comes from? I will fuck off afterwards.</br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br> Date A Live </br>  <br> likes haremshit  <br> calls me a pleb <br><br>Well, okay then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon. I appreciate it.</br>  <br> I only like mature cartoons for mature men such as myself </br>  <br>Nigger are you retarded? I think you are if this is how you view people who don't like haremshit.</br>  <br>Is there a Nadeko fig up for preorder?</br>  Got this haul, everything was pretty well priced. Was happy to go 3/3 for best girls on the blind boxes.  <br>Damn fine camerawork<br>Damn fine image name<br>Damn fine figure</br></br></br>  <br>Could you please delete your comment? I'm black and this really offends me. Mods?</br>  <br>Stop being black so you won't get offended</br>  <br>I'm black and I think his post is aight<br>You on the other hand need to get your ass to reddit</br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128270385 <br>Please stop, I'm shaking because I'm so angry.</br>  <br>Harem genre is a founding father of anime. If you hate harem, you hate fun and all anime.</br>    <br>There's always a few around near release, plus if she gets delayed (she will) then there might be a few open then, too.<br><br>I'm hoping for a similar thing, I held off on getting any CGs for ages and now I have Mika and Rin I want Ranko too.</br></br></br>  <br>Ranko box has already been shown. It's coming out next month. It's already had two delays anyway.</br>  <br>BUT WILL IT LOOK LIKE SHIT</br>  <br>If you read the guide you would know.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with it.</br>  <br> I'm black </br>  <br>You won't get much help around here, even for shit not in the guide. Then they'll complain about spoon feeding you.<br><br>Some links in the comments. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>304196</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mead's designs <br> awful <br>Fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks bro, this helps.</br>  <br>Only that one picture you've probably seen already but it doesn't look too bad for the extra money. Get that nice box too.</br>  <br>This is the only nice one.</br>  <br>I really hope we get to see the actual figure at wonfes</br>  <br>Like I said, fuck you and your shit taste.</br>  <br><br>Is that a new Regi pokemon?</br></br>  <br>I'm betting no, since it was only announced last Wonfest. They've been much slower on the time between announcing and sculpting figures these days.</br>  <br>Total opposite, most manufacturers used to announce figures that were released years later. Nowadays we get some figures and preorders going up in mere weeks.</br>  <br>Figures also look better than ever nowadays.<br>I wish they would go back and do some old properties, some characters only have shitty figures or none at all.</br></br>  <br>今冬</br>  <br>Of course buddy, this winter. I swear</br>  <br>I'd spread my vanilla all over that ware</br>   Amazon selling nendoroids directly from their warehouses <br>They can be trusted right? They have one I want for the same price as mandarake but I won't have to pay shipping on amazon and I get that prime 2 day.</br>  Out of curiosity, why's Alter's Vivio always so cheap?<br><br>The figure looks amazing, why's it always like 3k when all other Alter figs tend to shoot up in price?</br></br>  <br>Ya, you're totally right, just like Phat's Anastasia, or GSC's Kiss shot, or MF's Lucina/Satsuki.<br> newfags </br></br>  <br>How much did the madoka production notes cost you? I already have them, but I'm curious.<br><br>And I got that prize figure this month, she's great.</br></br></br>  <br>it's old</br>  <br>You mean three figures that g against the general trend? Shocking. Now compare that to every Sin by Amakuni, Hestia and Momohime by them as well, or all the figures by Alha Max since their first Alisa. <br><br><br>Now go back to some years ago and check what we had back then, DArtagnan took 4 years, ignis of the endless winter took 5, All the Hyaka Ryouran Figures took at least a year, go even further back, Shii by GSC took 2 years, BRS took two years as well,. It wasn't that rare to see the exact same figure unpainted for three straight wonfes. <br><br>And if you want a larger sample look at Orchid Seed, they keep a years long queue of figures since 7-8 years ago and jsut recently they hav gotten into the sub-yearly releases.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody liked Vivio in Strikers</br>  <br>As long as it doesn't look like shit it's an insta-buy for me, I love snake god Nadeko.</br>  <br>The fact she barely even appears in that form, probably. I have her though, she's pretty great. Looks lovely alongside Signum too.</br>  <br>theres also the ougi figure that was posted before.<br>it was announced at the same wonfes and is already up for preorder.</br></br>  <br> talking about a GSC figure. <br> writes a paragraph on non GSC figures, as if that has anything to do with what was said. <br>dumb.</br></br></br>  Did anyone here buy the various merchandise for Houkago no Pleiades? <br><br>I bought the entire set of it, for some reason they didn't ship it all together though and one of the packages is stuck in customs.</br></br>  <br><br>Says the retard who can't even read.</br></br>  <br>Nothing pains me more than knowing that this masterpiece sold poorly and we'll never see anything more than what is already out on amiami. I bought a key chain, quality figures never ;_;</br>  <br>I'm sure they are fine,   but I'm not sure and I just ordered one too.  </br>  <br> How your car will perform with these new additions </br>  <br>I don't even know who this is but I want it.</br>  <br>I preordered a mug on amiami.</br>    <br><br>Was this honestly worth picking up? It was one of the few series last season I didn't even watch the pilot of.</br></br>  <br>yeah, sure bro</br>  <br>I got both for 160. I wasn't going to get the normal note but I figured the autism of getting one and not the other to save around 10 dollars would eat at me. Felt the same about Hibiki until I noticed I couldn't find her cheaper online.</br>  <br><br>That fucking paranoia, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>How do you not know Sayla?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Maybe he's new.<br>Also, any Lalah figures?</br></br>  <br>Aunt Jemima bottles are still a thing, I think.</br>  <br>I instantly dismissed his comment as sheer bait and didn't even bother replying since I assume everyone knows the important characters from the original Gundam--if they don't know them then they aren't even worth responding to in the first place.</br>  <br>Eh... I don't get it.</br>  Why do most shows get clear files for merchandise? Do people actually use them?    <br>I think it's just an easy way to merchandise illustrations alongside posters.</br>  Who would buy this?<br><br> page9.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/aucti<wbr>on/k193343255</wbr> </br></br>  <br>I use them, they come in handy sometimes.</br>  <br>Holy shit that is hilarious. Look at pochaco go. Too many people scared of going boom.</br>   awesome design <br> unique take on character <br> <br>Oh yeah, I can't wait to... <br><br> Play Arts Kai <br><br>God.Is.Dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. Looks like some bid was rescinded? Shows 702,000 en now. Still, too fucking much.</br>  <br> awesome design <br>That's debatable.</br></br>  <br>I thought Rin hasn't gotten a phat yet.</br>  <br> people still think paks are bad </br>  <br>Maybe recent PAKs aren't as terrible as some older ones, but they are still shit.</br>  So, amiami isn't letting me log in and I don't know why. Whenever I try to log in it says "There was an error with your e-mail address and/or password. Please try again." and I even tried the "did you forget your password?" option but it isn't working either. <br><br>What's up with this? My account was working just fine a few days ago.</br></br>  <br>At least Subaru has an okay figure that's not too hard to get. <br>There's also that one doujinshi and the artbook, although the former is impossible to find at a decent price so I just settled for xpoz's other unrelated doujin.</br></br>  <br>Did you cancel anything recently?<br>I'd say shoot them an email.</br></br>  <br>I found the scene the cel is from. It's from episode one, the scene where Benbow attacks Billy Bones.</br>  Why havent NG gotten figures from Phat yet? Minami is next.  <br>Happened to me before, just send them an email saying you can't log in and don't wanna make a new account since it's a rule violation.</br>  <br>Because they got ones from GSC.</br>  <br>I have one of mai waifu I use for keeping paperwork and info pages in when I'm travelling.</br>  <br>So phat isnt allowed to do the? I want a good Rin and I dont like GSCs</br>  <br>She hasn't, I got the GSC one. Since Phat is under the GSC umbrella they're probably avoiding doing the same girls.</br>  <br>It may happen eventually. I like the GSC ones but I'd like a set of NG in matching outfits.</br>  <br> NG in matching outfits. <br>Fuck NG. I want Triad Primus in matching outfits. I'm really tempted to get Rin's GSC but I'm holding out for something better. Phat ones are an instant preorder though,</br></br>  <br>WASH AWAY THE ANGER.</br>  <br>Who did the Subaru fig I want to pick one up now</br>  <br>Not enough belts.</br>  <br>And she was from back when the ova happened in 2012</br>   some shitty watermarks but whatever <br><br>This figure looks hot as HELL</br></br>    <br>Didn't cancelled anything, idk what's going on.<br><br><br>Thanks! Emailed them already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>Only if it's fulfilled.</br>  <br>No. How hard is it to search Pleiades, or even Pleiades + mug on amiami? Come on.</br>  <br>Did you import the swimming wear?</br>  Thinking about ordering this in the hopes that they make a Yuudachi one too.  <br> being gaijin and supporting boatshit.  <br>I'll never understand</br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with anything? It's not like gaijin can't play.</br>  <br> being gaijin and supporting japanshit <br>It's fucking retarded, right?</br></br>  <br>What does being gaijin have to do with anything? We can play boats just like anyone else.</br>  <br>Not all gaijin are EOP, and you don't even need to know nip to play the game or enjoy the character designs/voices.</br>  <br>You are actually fucking retarded. The irony is real</br>  <br>Because the series revolves around japanese warships and a lot of Japs support it also because they see it as nationalistic. It's not like they're American or EEuropean boats</br>   http://page4.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/<wbr>jp/auction/d168072732</wbr> <br><br>How much are you willing to pay for your waifu /a/ ?</br></br>  <br>this actually looks really good. i've never even played kancolle</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>A lot more than that.</br>  <br>About tree fiddy</br>  <br>at least twice that</br>  <br>those hips</br>  <br>I'm German. I am 100% ok with supporting it.<br><br>Unlike butthurt Americans, apparently.</br></br></br>  <br>the amount of references to the ships being sunk in real life is pretty funny.</br>  <br>Thanks m8 just ordered her from hobby link</br>  <br>No, I got them at  SDCC . The shop had it for retail price, same as the GuPs.</br>  <br>What are Bismarck, Prinz Eugen, Z1, Z3, U-511, Littorio, and Roma then?</br>  I love getting multiple packages in a week.<br><br>Somehow Amazon's packaging was better than FromJapan's.</br></br>  <br>Non-Allied ships.</br>  <br>What was your recent activity on the site?<br>You might have gotten banned, happened to me when I purchased an item for a trade with a guy on MFC, had it shipped directly to him.<br>They unbanned me but I was pretty mad.</br></br></br>  <br>No shit, you're an axis power. Of course you'll support your Japanese brothers.</br>  <br>Wow, AX was selling the GuPs for $10 each.</br>  <br>i need this in my life</br>  <br><br>I am convinced the crotch plate is forced cast-off. But i need proof.</br></br>  <br>Eagerly awaiting owari in the fall.</br>  Starting to realize I hate long hair on figures. Always feels like it's going to break.  <br><br> being butthurt about a conflict that ended decades before you were born </br></br>  <br>That's the price he bought it for. I saw the booth at SDCC.</br>   https://<span>youtu.be/-Jsy7xx0ltA  [ ]   <br>Buy it and let us know</br>  <br>I saw another shop selling blind boxes for 15+ apiece too, nobody there bought anything from what I could see.</br>  <br><br> buy it. <br><br>Like i can now.</br></br></br></br>  I preordered Sayla<br><br>Now give me a good figure of this goddess.</br></br>  Symphogear scale this WF?  <br>After listening to the OST properly I feel like I should buy it.</br>  <br>Don't hold your breath, anon.</br>  Postman showed up right before I left on a trip so these pictures were rushed. I'll unbox them and post pictures when I get home if no one else posts theirs.  <br>We need a Char figure more than anyone else.</br>  <br>There's already one.</br>  <br>Then why do you care?</br>  <br>Still waiting on an Amuro. I almost bought his prize figure for 5000 yen a while back. Kind of regretting not doing that, since now I can only find it on YJA and it's more of a hassle to get it there.</br>  How do you guys hide this shit from your girlfriends and friends?  <br><br>Because i want to own it anyways.</br></br>  <br> I love getting multiple packages in a week. <br>Same here. Getting a package can just brighten up your day. I'm glad years of being a poorfag taught me some self control, otherwise I'd be getting figures in the mail nonstop.</br></br>  New chapter is translated.<br><br>How long until these semen demons will have a taste of Papa's boner?</br></br>  I want to pop Ivileye's cherry.     and among them was even an Elder Lich, a powerful undead. <br>Is there gonna be a show down in the future? I am excited</br>  You have been teleported to the New World, last two digits of your post make your current level.<br>Are you a vermin or a remarkable threat to Papa Bones children?<br><br> Rolling for shota bard. </br></br></br>  <br>So which one of them  stays alive? </br>  <br><br> All of them. </br></br>  Marry one, kill one.  <br>Ainz has liches doing construction work, I don't think it'll be much of a fight.</br>  <br>Rolling as a Snow girl</br>  <br>That's nice.</br>  <br><br>A female Paladin, dedicated to fighting evil.</br></br>  <br>Marry both, kill self.

She mentions she never knew it had those kind of powers/curses on it before, and also it sounds chunni as shit</br>  I just noticed that whenever possible players are mentioned, it's always in groups. Like the six gods or the eight greed kings or thirteen heroes. It sounds to me like it's individual guilds getting transferred over.<br><br>Too bad Papa Bones is a lonely skellington.</br></br>  <br>Rolling for Demon Lord to join up.</br>    <br>The fuck is a chunni</br>  <br>Had they all logged in, Momonga would probably have convinced some to stay on until the very end and whoosh, there'd be more than just him now.<br><br>One of the dragon's specialty is turning players against each other. Wonder how that's going to work with Papa Bones. Without a WC item, turning the Guardians against him is nigh impossible.</br></br></br>    <br>lets do this</br>  <br>Alright lets go faggots.</br>  <br>You know how you wanted to be something nonsensical like a T-Rex or Harry Potter as a kid? Well a chunii is someone that nevr grew out of that phase and still spouts stupid shit like "Witness my Flames of Obliteration, mirrors of my dark soul!" well into his teens and adult life.</br>  <br>TOMB KING REPORTING FOR ACTION</br>  <br>But these people can actually pull off flames of obliteration.</br>  Ayy fucking finally lmao<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13399</wbr></br>  <br>She doesn't and that's why it's funny.<br><br>She's a cleric with a dark power sword and great warrior but she still wants to pretend she has a cursed evil energy and dark flames and all that shit when she doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>As long as I'm a cute grill, I'll just charm my way out of any situation :3c</br>  <br><br>Technically this is a lie while also being correct</br></br>  <br><br>I still don't see what's up with the princess but i'<br>d kill her anyway since they are hammering us over the head that something is wrong with her</br></br></br>  <br>rolling as slime</br>  <br>Well as long as she isnt telling people its ok. Reading it it seems like they overheard her talking to herself.</br>  <br><br>I WANNA BE THE GUY</br></br>  <br>Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers.<br><br>Honestly holy power doesn't even make sense to me most of the time. Can anyone that plays enough tabletop explain what holy damage is? I can understand healing and how it can damage undead, but what the hell is going on when holy damage hits a non-undead. I can't even fathom how it can be translated to reality.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was pumped but he's probably only a little bit stronger than iguava. can beat maids and thats about it</br></br>  <br>God smites people in the bible. That's basically what holy damage is. Divine retribution striking people dead.<br><br>I would agree that it's pretty vague, but that's how it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Gods wreck people all the time. They just wreck undead more.</br>  <br>Yeah, I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine.<br><br>I always try to see it as either physical construct of light hitting something like green lantern rings or a burning light.</br></br></br>  <br> Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers. <br><br>Again, that's why it's funny. This is a universe where you can gain dark power but she's not actually pursuing that, she's just being silly chuuni about it for fun.<br><br>As far as holy power/damage goes it's literally asking your chosen deity/source of holy power to add some FUCK YOU to whatever thing you're trying to attack. Depending on the system sometimes it doesn't modifying attacks against a non evil enemy but most of the time it's just another damage modifier that just happens to effect evil/undead more than it would a neutral creature. Just imagine it like adding fire damage or something to an attack but it has the added effect of doing 4X damage on undead and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also a maid and total qt.<br>All the girls are top tier semen demons.</br></br>  <br><br>Basically pic-related</br></br>  <br> Ninya <br> Lukeluther <br> Peter <br> Dyne <br>Nevar forget ;_;7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine. <br><br><br>It's easier to imagine than "arcane" damage and shit. Still, sometimes it takes the form of light or fire or lightning but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it feels like when you're getting hit by it.</br></br></br></br>   people in the New World using MMO lingo <br><br>that's kind of neat, im guessing some of the players became kings or some shit and propogated that shit</br></br>  <br><br> grasping her right hand <br> rings on all fingers <br> talks with her dark personality <br> darkness powers <br> darkness <br>comeon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were easily forgettable as far as killed off characters go. <br><br>Most of their interactions were just talking to Ainz and I don't think we ever got internal dialogue from any of them. They were also only there for a short time and were absent for like half the time they traveled with Momon. <br><br>Really easy to kill off overall. Compare that literally anyone else from the LIzardmen on and you can see how little you should honestly care about their deaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic doesn't have an analog to real life either though. Especially not "dark magic/energy".<br><br>I think of it mostly like a really focused ray of light from the sun, almost like a laser except sunlight. The reaction a vampire would get from normal sunlight, i.e. being scorched.<br><br><br>Aye, but I'm still not feeling people with "martial arts" (hoping for a better translation tbh) "activating skills". Sounds retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ninya <br>Male or female?</br></br>  They need to introduce some more players soon. Not that I don't mind Momongas rape train, but he needs some real adversaries.  <br>They all dudes. They even talk about how having a girl would be weird with them all probably wanting to fuck.</br>  <br>Sure, but they were nice and relatable, and didn't deserve to go like that. I liked them.<br><br><br>Male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hah, you're in for a surprise.</br>  <br>I've liked arcane as a damage type, it's just pure mana that hasn't been filtered or transformed into another element. Sure we can't imagine what the damage feels like, but that's an issue with the lack of magic in our world and not that the concept is incorrect.</br>  <br>I think it was impactful because it was the first time in the series people we;d spent some time with ended up dead. Good people. Carne village was filled with good people but we were never formally introduced to them the way we were with the Swords. It was then I realized if you weren't with Nazarick, whether good or evil, your life expectancy was pretty short.</br>  <br>Rolling for trickster fairy.</br>  <br>Alright, I've been grinding since .<br>It's finally time to beat Ainz and claim werewolf maid.</br></br>  <br>I'm actually enjoying the slow burn. No reason to rush things.<br><br><br>I guess I thought Ainz would have seen the resemblance to his own past and thought it was a bit sad that they died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't like how we're constantly shown how shit the people Ainz is cautious about are. <br><br>Like immediately after wondering who the fuck the group that MC'd Chair were we get to here a testimony from one of the guys how the super secret strongest person in their entire group could probably beat Chair without gear with the implication being that Shalltear with her armor and lance would fucking murder her so there's another group who we know aren't a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Surprise for what they're all dead</br>  <br><br>MC's pretty busy building his kingdom. Any player introduced in the current timeline is going to have to face Ainz and his kingdom. I actually prefer the players to have been in the past myself.</br></br>  <br>In the web novel Ninya stays a dude</br>  <br>Rolling for Muscle Wizard</br>  <br>Stronk chiken</br>  <br> 29 <br>Haha my pranks shall be mildy annoying.</br></br>  <br> How did a vampire loli get into Blue Rose? </br>  <br>You could turn them against each other if they thought it was to protect Ainz or if they somehow made the order seem like it came from their creator.</br>  So I think we can all agree that Papa Bones is Neutral Evil at this point, right?  this show any good?  <br>They're not going to buy it.</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>Some of the strongest human warriors are at level 30, so it's not like you're underpowered.<br><br><br>I like it a lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Round 2 rollan.</br>  <br>That part always tripped me out.</br>  <br>Then what do you suggest?</br>  <br>Since martial arts aren't from Yggdrasil and it does seem kind of wierd that people would have skills they can activate by calling them out, what are the chances of it just being from another dead MMO system?</br>  <br>That does seem plausible to me. Otherwise it's kinda weird.</br>  <br>Rolling for Broken Level Hamster Wizzard</br>  <br>roll</br>  <br> Holy fuck</br>  <br><br>I would file it under standard jap move calling.<br>That or they copied people calling spell names.</br></br></br>  <br>Rolling to Lich King</br>  <br>Don't worry, once Ainz subjugates the weak humans he'll have to contend with the non-humans of the world.

And of course if any of the "Twenty" show up that alone can put even fairly weak humans on par with floor guardians.</br>  <br><br>00 is GM</br></br>  <br>I WILL EAT YOU</br>   “Realize now, Shalltear. You face Ainz Ooal Gown, with the combined might of all 41 Supreme Beings. From the beginning, you had no chance of victory.“ <br><br>This gave me a boner</br></br>  So, are we getting lizardmen or opening trolling us?<br> I'd vote for the troll </br>  <br>Troll for sure</br>  <br>It's a troll. Frost Pain isn't even on there.</br>  <br>Rolling for a bowfag.</br>  <br>She had a pretty good chance of victory and his strategy relied on him being 80% close to losing. <br><br>If anything that fight, despite Ainz being at a MASSIVE disadvantage, goes to show that Ainz is barely stronger than the floor guardians without loads of prep time.</br></br></br>  <br>Or that almost all of his skills are ineffective on undead races with lifesteal.</br>  <br>Well the Floor Guardians are basically Dungeon Bosses so it's not a big surprise.</br>  <br>I think the fact that they made Shalltear do nothing and had her just stand about showed that they aren't necessarily antagonistic to Ainz. If anything, controlling her and just letting her sit in a spot that was obvious is really a sign of good faith I think.</br>  So, does Ainz ever take a ton of NPCs from Nazarick to go on a jolly adventure together? I couldn't be arsed to read past the first book yet, shit's kinda tiresome.  <br>I keep saying she would have won but for aura interfering.</br>  <br>The lifesteal mechanic wasn't even really that big a deal to the overall fight since he wasn't even really doing chip damage until the very end and her getting into melee with him meant he was fucked even without that.<br><br>The undead thing isn't the only problem, if you have any mechanic to avoid instant death (which was readily apparent in the MMO) he was gimped to shit.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't make her do anything because she mortally wounded the old lady who mind controlled her before she could give any orders.</br>  <br>They didn't. She murdered the shit out of the others and put the World Item user into a catatonic state before they could do anything more with the mind control.</br>  <br>You know that the level 95 fire elemental that took a good amount of time for Mare and Aura to kill? Ainz probably has multiples of those and can also summon thousands of skeletons endlessly. Any other guardian would be wittled to shit.<br><br>Honestly, if Ainz didn't actually need to kill Shalltear, she would have no way to get to Ainz through his summons.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you can also say that Ainz just soloed a Raid boss.<br>Said like that, it holds another meaning</br></br>  <br>That would be complicated. They're extremely dependent upon Ainz. And making them fight each other would be complicated, unless they managed to make they think that their companions are trying to betray Ainz, and they acted before consulting him.</br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  <br> Cocytus using four weapons <br><br>He says the he only uses one because otherwise it would stomp. Also, he usually fights only with 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I do not think the King will stop with things such as meddling.</br>  <br>The fire elemental was level 80 wasnt it? And he only summoned that with the guild staff.</br>  <br>We technically see only two weapons.<br>Dual wielding doesn't necessary means one on each side</br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter. Shalltear is good for crowd control. If you just add minions that are weaker than her, you're only helping her, thanks to being an undead she's resistant to most types of damage, and will lifesteal their hp bars.</br>   The whole everything with Shalltear vs Papa Bones <br> Everything after it <br>What an awesome fight, and then so many feels for lonely Ainz.</br></br>  <br>He takes best maid out for some adventuring.</br>  <br>That's why I'm saying that just because Shalltear hard counters Ainz, the other guardians don't necessarily match up to him.<br>Ainz can probably easily defeat any of the other guardians.</br></br>  <br><br>The only troll here is that after adapting vol 1, the anime is going to get rushed as fuck animate up to volume 8.</br></br>  <br>It really doesn't because we never get a gauge on how competent the parties invading Naz were. We're told she could take on a full group of 6 and some more but there's really no comparison on how good the people invading ever were. <br><br>If you really want to compare shit to the old game it means that the guardians are so shit that a single above average player (and I quote "middle of the high tier") with a joke RP build and small use of cash shop items was able to solo her meant she's overall not impressive (as far as we're just comparing every endgame thing from the NPCs to players) with most of his moves being useless and his final gambit being "use the shitty spell to job change and auto attack her".<br><br><br>That would only put her at even more of a disadvantage. She even summons shit for herself to kill while her Eidolon tanked Ainz (which he needed to use his ultimate shit to stop anyway). Adding the summons (which we're told how many relevant things he can summon anyway) only helps her in the long run and the fire elemental that A) was shit and B) could only be used by using the guild staff which he would never take out was better than any of the undead he's summoned before. Turning that into a prolonged fight would have been even shitter since he role is to be a drawn out tank fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well to be a threat to papa bones you either need to be a lvl.100 priest or a lvl.100 paladin. pretty much nothing else is a threat. maybe a lvl.100 mage. the problem all 3 run into is the NPCs in the tomb are all raid level boss characters, and all have varying strength which make a papa bones busting character sorta gimped for dealing with the npc horde. <br><br>I'll roll a paladin. they're fun to play even if you aren't taking on undead lichkings</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's build relies heavily on using his summons as meatshields/support, and his Unholy/Instant-Death Spells. Against Shalltear using Summons is stupid because she can lifesteal off of them, and his Unholy spells don't work on her because she's Undead.</br>  <br> It really doesn't because we never get a gauge on how competent the parties invading Naz were. <br><br>It wasn't so much how competent the raiding party was, It has to do with the quality of the gear they used. Shalltear has divine class gear, at least for the spear.</br></br></br>  <br>The other guardians all have other shit to avoid instant death mechanics and even though they mention that Chair is probably "stronger" than the others that the difference in strength is minimal enough that any two guardians fighting together would easily kill her fast.<br><br>I don't think Ainz would lose to any guardian shown thus far (honestly Pandora's Actor maybe) but really the "major disadvantages" he had against Chair were easily negated by the huge amount of preptime he had to where any floor guardian would be a hard enough fight.</br></br></br>  <br>ayyyy</br>  Gotta build my own Nazarick for that pathfinder game. That still needs ~2 more players.<br><br>Advice on design?</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say easy, but Shalltear is the only guardian that could realistically beat him.  Hell, the only reason he won was because he used his superior spell casting strength as a diversion to burn through Shalltear's MP and skills, and then took it to a melee fight with a bunch of OP weapons. Had the situation changed even a bit, Ainz would have had even more difficulty, or lose right out </br>  <br>Rollin to capture and  sexually bully  Narberal<br><br>60+ pls</br></br></br>  <br>The only reason he won at all was because of aura fucking with the fight.</br>    <br>True, the last second hesitation very nearly cost him the entire battle, damn Papa Bones and his sentimental heart or bone</br>  <br>It was upper 80s. And yeah he didn't use his regular divine items and AoG during that fight.</br>  <br>He should have taken PA. Taking Narbel was the worst decision of his life.</br>  <br>Ainz can beat any of the Floor Guardians relatively easy, compared to Shalltear, since she is specifically built to be his counter.</br>  <br>Why is narberal so cute and useless?<br><br>I don't understand how she pulls it off.<br><br>I don't even want to fuck her. I just want to hang out with her and talk.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What did she do? I forgot. I however remember that the whole fire/resist and faking his hp bar were more important overall.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how large groups could have trouble with a floor guardian if a single lv 100 can handle them. Even if Ainz is upper/mid tier it sees like the first few floors can easily be put on farm status by actually competent players.</br>  <br>Rolling for regular human spear-user.</br>  <br>She psyched out Shalltear when she was going in to finish Ainz.</br>  <br>Rolling for duel wield shield.</br>  <br>I cant remember 100% But when ainz hesitated she did something to distract shaltear before she could land the deathblow.</br>  <br>And yet it took 1500 of them to actually make a meaningful raid on the tomb.</br>  <br>She isn't built to be his counter. She has anti death resistances and beyond that she has a good class match up but that's it. <br><br>If you give any sort of anti instant death then Ainz is looking at a fight that's really not any different from the Chair fight.<br><br><br>At the very last blow Aura gave off a weird Aura that made Chair hesitate just a moment longer than Ainz did.<br><br><br>Well it wasn't just the floor guardians. You had to deal with any entire zone of enemies and traps, Ainz was still upper tier and knew her inside and out, and despite mentioning that they liked to pretend to be the final bosses the instances with the mine and shit implies the guild would still go to PK the fuck out of people invading.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it was never one floor guardian, it was always the guardians, their minions, and possibly the battlemaids. I'm pretty sure it was mentioned all the members of Ainz Ooal Gown waited in the throne room to meet anyone who could possibly get past. Plus I'm sure if any raids decided to stick around and farm one of the floors, the guild members would show up to take them out since they aren't doing it the right way, or other floor guardians/minions would show up to corner them or chase them off. But then again, you have to remember Shalltear was the first floor guardian, so she probably decimated any invading forces with her offensive power, and the raids decided to continue on rather than sit around and wait for Shalltear to be brought back.</br>  <br>Full Divine Gear.<br><br>People seem to be stuck in the mindset that YGGDRASIL endgame is like WoW's endgame. Where as long as you have a good guild that'll actually carry you, even a total scrub can get somewhat decent raid gear in literally like a week.<br><br>Based on the description that even if you include the hardcore players, the average level 100 had 0-1 pieces of Divine-Tier gear. I would assume YGGDRASIL is more like the p2w korean MMOs. In those, in order to get anything resembling end-game gear, you have to farm raid bosses for materials to make your gear. The catch?  The rare materials have 1/10000 drop rate on raid bosses so you're fucked unless you either land that 1/10000 chance multiple times, or you hate your money. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget pre-fight buffing, pay2win item abuse, attacking his opponent before the fight even started, using a treasure trove of high powered guild weapons he just gathered, reading up on all of Shalltear's abilities before the fight, setting mines up before the fight, wearing holy resist gear in secret, and pretending fire spells do nothing to him. With so many dishonorable tactics in a 1v1 fight it's no wonder he succeeded.</br>  <br> She used Sky Eye to spy on Shalltear and give off murderous intent to distract her for a split second long enough for Ainz to break the hourglass </br>  <br>A true pvp p2w god.</br>  <br>I don't think we'll be allowed to make non euclidean and nonsensical level transitions like that.</br>  <br>Rolling for skelly brawler</br>  <br>It's kinda sad how poorly she does at blending in with humans given her race. But then again she is only a level 1 doppelganger.</br>  <br>And from what we know, practically all the big names of Ainz Ooal Gown threw tons of money at the game, Ainz himself once spent all his money on trying to get a super rare ring.</br>  <br>Dont forget dropping two super magic spells on her.</br>  I wonder if fighter classes had a skill that let them turn into spell casters, like how spell casters have Perfect Warrior  <br>Aw yeah son, level 95 fighter, I'm ready to level castle walls and tear apart whole armies alone. Plus I still have room to grow.</br>  <br>I played FFXI with it's 0.0000001% droprates for years. Being with people that wont gank your drops or leave when they get yours and you haven't is a bigger issue than actually farming stuff.<br>There's also the fact that mulltiple guilds were higher ranked and/or stronger so it's not like there wouldn't be anyone incapable of fighting them<br><br>Then let's take the fact that everyone seems to insist that it's SO HAAARD to beat them that players all got scared away.<br>Absolute fucking Virtue didn't scare players away until Sundi accidentally revealed that it really was supposed to take 12+ hours to fight and there wasn't some super secret trick to drop it down to a reasonable time we couldn't discover. Sure the motivation to beat it was more of a fuck you to the devs but you underestimate just how hard players will throw themselves at a challenge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt they change Absolute virtue anytime someone found a way to feasibly beat it?</br>  <br>I live to serve papa bones.</br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br> fighters <br> able to do anything at max level </br></br>   DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE N PASSION   <br>Touch Me was literally unkillable for a while.</br>  <br> 12 hours straight dealing with shitty MMO gameplay <br><br>Dunno how the fuck people would willingly submit to that torture.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't talk shit about Touch Me</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>To be fair the first few times were from people experimenting so much they found random as fuck glitches to exploit.<br>I mean seriously. Who honestly expects to discover that you can become invulnerable to the strongest being in the game via catching yourself in a cutscene at a spot halfway across your current map section?<br>Plus the Wall of Justice where players would nuke it from above while it couldn't reach high enough to hit them.<br>The first time it died it didn't have drops because they put some obscene monster in the game without expecting players to kill it.(How do you get that lazy?)<br><br>Noone could actually fathom that it was SUPPOSED to take that long. Everyone thought that they were just missing some obvious in retrospect trick to make it from impossible fight to a reasonable but difficult fight. That's why that Pandemonium Warden fight managed to keep the players in for so long. Noone could believe that there was anyone Sadistic enough to make something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 12+ hours to figh <br><br>Let's be real here, was it fun?</br></br></br>  <br>He's concerned about his subordinates going on a killing spree. <br><br>Nevertheless, he's willing to sacrifice Nazarick if he can make sure that he can get away with his children. However, this is unlikely, given how formidable Nazarick actually is.</br></br></br>  <br>Ever played a game for 12 hours straight? Feels like you're slowly rotting away, falling and falling ever more.</br>  <br>I wonder if he only cares about the floor guardians or if he plans on taking the battlemaids and lower level NPCs and even a few skellingtons.</br>  <br>If 1500 players and NPCs attacking couldn't conquer Nazarick, I doubt anything in the New World below a godly being could take the tomb.</br>  <br>He cares about what was actually made by the guild.<br><br>The generated NPCs can all fuck off for how much he cares</br></br></br>  <br>I once played for 30+ hours straight back when I was in high-school.<br><br>I was fine all the way through but when I actually stopped and went to sleep I felt like dying.</br></br></br>  <br>Nazarick is a testament to endgame hoarding. He has enough legendary weapons hoarded away to equip a small army, much less the Divine weapons that many of the defenders seem to have.<br><br>This is not counting the mountains of high-end material most endgame guilds obtain over the course of just a year, much less 10. Ainz also has an advantage in that he's essentially a adult from the future; he has far more schooling than most individuals in the New World. He isn't like the demon lord and hero from Maoyuu, whom have to politicize their way to impose reforms; his minions essentially do anything he asks, alongside the perks of being mostly immortal monsters.</br></br></br>  <br>He cares about what was made by his old comrades, since they are like the children of his friends</br>  <br> goblin club </br>   DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION   <br>The only reason they lost was floor 8.<br><br>If they found a way to ignore Victim (and if the secret NPCs like the miko/Lastborn/Rubedo or whatever combination of them are each other aren't that amazing) then they would have beaten the tomb completely and even the guild itself would have lost.<br><br>Really if they all got together and tried again they would have won but Victim just fucking ruined everyone's day so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I DON'T WANT OUR SOULS TO LET GO </br>  So, is there a way for Ainz to actually bone Albedo and Shalltear, with him being a skeleton and all? I'm sure this topic was probably discussed at length already.  <br>Not to mention the hoard (in comparison) of World level weapons that all the Guardians have, and Ainz has up his sleeve to turn around any situation if it gets too dangerous.<br><br>Needless to say, if there ever was a threat that warranted the FULL might of Nazarick, every trick, trump and ace, said threat would be swiftly and overwhelmingly crushed.</br></br></br>  <br>They also had 40 other members answering the call to war. Now it's just Ainz.</br>  <br>I knew better(that entire region of endgame didn't offer much to me back then and I already had the only real drop from there needed fairly quick) and the people that did fight it before that revelation tended to also be experimenting on it for SCIENCE to figure out the mysterious super secret method to weaken it.  Turns out there was one tiny little trick that required you to use your job ability (that was on a once every 2 hours timer) at the exact same time it used it's own matching job ability to "seal" that ability. note that you have to pick from one of 13+ ja to get the right predicted one, natural lag means that by the time you see it it's already too late, a full wipe resets it to unsealed, it's aoe damage was enough that most of these jobs would DIE just from being close enough to seal it even in the latest set of gear before the 75 cap was removed, and even if you lived next door to the serve in Japan it was outright impossible to do so with proper timing without a bot. <br><br>There is a reason that when FFXI players heard that Sundi had cancer and had to step down that everyone barely held back tears of joy.</br></br></br>  <br>Easiest way is to use the wish ring that would transform him easily but I'm sure there are other work arounds.<br><br>If he really wants an heir (which he doesn't) and it has to involve actual fucking he'd be better of fucking Albedo or Aura since Chair is undead.</br></br></br>  <br>What's Victim's power?</br>  <br>Ruining peoples day</br>  <br>To separate the atoms inside himself.</br>  <br> Majin Vegeta </br>  <br>If you kill him he releases EVERY SINGLE debuff possible on the entire floor.<br><br>He can't attack and there's no friendly fire but he follows you throughout all of floor 8. There's implications that even if you were aware of this and didn't fight him the other characters on floor eight (with the only confirmed being cherry blossom guardian) would result in you having to use an aoe at some point and you'd still kill him.</br></br></br>  <br>So basically, Victim is the wizard's book of exploding runes?</br>  <br>Well we don't really know how the invasion went. Victim and floor 8 very clearly ended the invasion right there, but there were 7 other floors that easily could have torn through the attacking forces, weakening them and reducing their numbers in huge swathes. I doubt theres a way to just "ignore" a floor guardian though. But still, even if they got past Victim and Floor 8, they would have to still deal with Albedo and the whole of Ainz Ooal Gown, which would have been a fucking nightmare to face, Touch Me alone would have been an absolute monster to face. And if by some miracle the invaders beat down all 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown in their throne room, armed with who knows what weapons and items to route their invaders, theres still getting to the treasure room, which is guarded by Pandora Actor, so that's potentially fighting Touch Me two times in a row.<br><br>Regardless, the invasion would have probably been stonewalled by the guild if they made it past Victim</br></br></br>  <br>That's some nice stuff. Whoever made him was a wonderful asshole.</br>  Honestly I'd like to know how they did what they did with him at his level. There has to be some tradeoff.  <br>The middle girl looks like she's all about FREEDOM</br>  <br>You know what would be neat, if we get a side story telling us what all happened during the riad.</br>  <br>None of the guild members fought the invaders, they all waited in the throne room like final bosses. The invaders were wiped out due to the Floor Guardians, ultimately completely being annihilated by Floor 8 and Victim.</br>  What's up with Shalltear and the whoe chair thing, anyway?  <br>What would be neat is a side story about Touch Me being a complete beast.</br>  <br>He is a floating embryo that cant do anything but die. Thats a fairly big tradeoff.</br>  <br>Some sort of dual wielding shadow kirito mixed with ninja and EMIYA in there, It's going to be either amazing or I get Urobutcher's lucky rolls and fail at everything.</br>  <br>When's this ED song coming out? It's so good.</br>  <br>The trade-off was probably lots and lots of real money, and probably why he is literally useless when he's alive.</br>  <br>Both OP and ED come out on August 26th.<br> The wait is going to kill me. </br></br>  <br>Aw man, such a long wait. It's so catchy it's stuck in my head and now I have to hear the whole thing.</br>  <br>See but you can't assume that either. You're right on not knowing how powerful the 1.5k Player/NPC raid was but I cannot imagine having downed everything else that engaging in PVP with the guild meant defeat. The game balance was fucking abysmal but I can't imagine even Touch Me just being able to wade knee deep into hundreds of players just smashing through them (after losing his 100% resistance option) and the other players in the guild minus "the strongest magic caster" were nowhere near Touch Me's level. <br><br>It's all up to speculation since we don't know the details but I'd really imagine with that many players (despite it largely being NPCs) they were just getting zerged until Victim who shines the absolute brightest when his range is everyone regardless of numbers. <br><br>I guess we really never know since the deepest level defenses (whether it be the demon golems, the delay maids, the guild itself, PA, and the Avatara) never got a time to shine ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It still gets me that in universe the average player was so fucking stupid that the combination to make the low level Victim never got found out by anyone and that Yg itself was the most sealed game of all time where players had secret fucking classes due to everyone being assblasted over sharing.<br><br>It must had the most toxic community of all.</br></br></br>  <br>Rolling for radiant fist monk</br>  <br> but I can't imagine even Touch Me just being able to wade knee deep into hundreds of players just smashing through them <br>Wasnt he so powerful that they just banned his build?</br></br>  <br>I ain't even mad. If I had some super class that I found I wouldn't tell anybody shit.</br>  <br>Victim is also efficient as fuck as he is low leveled so he doesnt contribute much to the Guardian npc total level count max.</br>  <br>I bet it's something along the lines of forcing the low level with his martyr job preventing him from going beyond current strength<br><br>I mean these are supposed to be level 100 raid bosses, game devs just didn't account for people to make a boss with what is essentially a gimmick class that forces the loss of 5 levels on your character.</br></br></br>  <br>What end up happening was with all his previous traits that gave damage reduction him winning the tournament to get the special champion class meant he ended up with 100% damage reduction (he literally could not be hurt) so they had to change it.</br>  <br>stop that<br><br>the 700 levels were for the actual guild base not the dungeons it's why all the maids or butlers except Sebastian max out at level 60</br></br></br>  <br>Does it take less gold to revive since its so low level?<br>Can you even revive that thing?</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, it's like getting wasted, fun while you are doing it, hell the next morning.</br></br>   the feeling of his life being carved away. A feeling similar to your vision darkening from losing most of your blood, it violently rattled Ainz’s… No, Suzuki Satoru’s weak mind. <br> rattled </br>  <br>Yes. Ainz mentions he would res him if he dies.</br>  <br>I thought Victim was just one of the bought NPCs.<br><br>Tabula bought like a hundred carrion babies to make a spooky room at they were level 20.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ding!<br><br>Grats!</br></br></br></br>  <br>So apparently the Guardians full under a different system. <br><br>Ah, I bet I know. They can only have 700 lvls worth of NPCs free of charge when they raise their guild that high. After that, I bet they had to buy them after that.</br></br></br>  <br>Dont think they ever stated if he was custom npc or premade one.</br>  <br>Maybe he was based on some rare as shit monster in a misc far corner?<br>I personally don't get how anyone could possibly have run into whatever monster he's based off of and NOT realize he's perfect for defending a floor.<br>Given the level of assblast people got from victim he's clearly the sort of thing players would remember running into for later use.<br><br>But yes. The game community was clearly full of retards and toxic as fuck.<br>I mean seriously. How else could guilds actually let themselves get tricked into killing each other when they have an entire planet to divide up and they're the only threats to each other?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably is custom though considering how cheap his gimmick is and how the invaders didnt know about him.</br>   There will never be a game like yggdrasil where you can pk non-humans lawfully and create characters force the devs to patch out your skills.   <br>But if the raid succeeded they would have gotten a shit ton of loot as well as the world class items if they weren't used.</br>  <br>Instead everyone lost 5 levels and a random piece of gear<br><br>Which is probably why Nazarick has such a huge treasury</br></br></br>  <br><br>Odds are the fact that Dieing loses you levels is what prevented most players from even thinking about the implications of the Martyr Class. <br>it's only the fact that NPC revives work on a different system that makes the build work at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Well you can't blame them. They had 1500 dudes. THEY didn't know that shit was going to go down. Not to mention the guild was only ranked like 8th. I'd hate to see what the other tops guilds where like.</br>   “Our leader said so awhile back when we were alone.

Even if they can hide certain things the're is loads of stuff that's getting broken into within hours of a patch.

Ainz ooal gown was mostly a PK guild but considered "a top guild" with the hardest tomb in YGGDRASSIL, so were other guilds just ahead on raid progress, loot stash or what?</br>  <br> Does noone hack into the datafiles in the future or something?

If there's no teleport system they could have tried to lock the players inside while taking shifts.<br><br><br><br>Probably based on rarity of gear obtained, wealth(p2w probably helped that alot), and how absolutely fabulous your base was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the devs had future bullshit tech to stop hacking.</br>  <br> Another thing. why didn't they properly siege the place if they had that any people? If there's no teleport system they could have tried to lock the players inside while taking shifts. <br> sieging people playing a game <br><br><br>They'd just make alts if worse came to worse, keeping the game up on a different computer</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz was a small as fuck guild and relied on you being a functioning member of society. Out of all of them Momonga was the most NEET of all and even he wasn't on 24/7. I'm sure even he was outclassed by a NEET playing all day and wasting his future welfare e currency.<br><br>The other guilds were probably just larger and just generated more "activity points" which is usually how guilds are ranked or were dedicated to PVP (I'm assuming the other top guilds had a member who was one of the other 8 world champions)/PVE to a much higher degree than Ainz Oon which seemed to enjoy just making shit in their dungeon.</br></br></br>  <br> If there's no teleport system <br>Did you miss the part where almost immediately after the story begins, it mentions that there is one?</br></br>  <br>Yes and yes.</br>  <br> Another thing. why didn't they properly siege the place if they had that any people? If there's no teleport system they could have tried to lock the players inside while taking shifts. <br>there was lots of Teleportation, so long as you were part of Ainz ooal gown, otherwise the teleport blockers in the Great Tomb of Nazarick wrecked your day</br></br>  <br>Well there is the whole lose 5 levels on death thing<br><br>Yeah you can grind at shifts but after the first few wipes trying to figure out boss mechanics and getting harassed by a bunch of assholes that can freely teleport through the base to hit you when you are stuck fighting gargantua or someshit you'll eventually stop being a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Considering how stuff that entire government agencies work on for years to create gets cracked within hours I kinda doubt that.<br><br><br>That's different. I meant as in as long as there was no way to teleport around outside of the tomb.<br><br>I must have forgotten or you're referring to the teleports inside the guild base which don't really count for when you're besieging em from the outside to ensure they can't earn the money to pay upkeep.<br><br>The Alts delivering cash if there was a mail system that another anon said makes more sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's special about this nigga?</br>  <br>He's Ainz's husbando.</br>  <br>His build is literally broken, as in the devs made the class/race combination impossible to select when they figured it out. He's  untouchable .</br>  <br>That's Mr. Nigga to you</br>  <br>Rolling</br>  <br>Its future magic, I aint got to explain shit.</br>  <br>Considering all Ainz members were members of Society it is even more impressive they managed to be so high on the guild rankings. Not to mention their guild was also very small. Also it makes sense they mostly PKd shit out of intruders, humanoid races and just tinkered around in their Tomb like any good villains.</br>  <br>Going by what others said he apparently managed 100% damage mitigation because devs are retarded enough to not notice that before a dude abuses the shit out of it to beat an entire world tournament.</br>  <br>Except of Touch me whod go around being everyones hero in shining armor.</br>  <br>No him beating the world tournament is what allowed him to get 100% damage resistance.</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br>roll plz</br>  <br> "In real life, he has a beautiful wife and children."<br><br>The more you know about this guy cooler he seems.</br></br></br>   Guide the beasts to their cage <br><br>what does he mean by this?</br></br>  <br>Where are people getting the 100% resistance from?

Only when it pertains to fakku, yep. Stop being so defensive, you make it too obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's just because of that book, but there was an article once that said that Naruko Hanaharu was a millionaire</br>  <br>I don't really understand why people support fakku<br><br>they helped nuked galleries for books they'll never release. They have 9 fucking books in their store while the wani bullshit removed literally thousands of galleries.</br></br></br>  <br> grasping at straws <br>You used the argument a lot by now. You have to be the same guy because I heard this a lot in these threads.</br></br>  <br>People just grasp at a lot of straws in these threads</br>  <br>Yeah, according to a TV show it sold over a million copies. The nips were really surprised by it and didn't believe it, so I'm not sure whether to believe it or not, I dunno how credible the show itself is, and it's not like Hanaharu himself was on there or anything (though Igumox was).</br>  <br>They'll get around to it. Eventually. Hope you still like fapping to hentai in 2060 when they finally catch up on their backlog.</br>  <br><br>That's why I'm kind of pissed that they want to enter talks with MORE publishers. Why? Forget that Wani's been around since the 70s, just go back as far as 2010 and you still have more material available than Fakku could release for years, even with an increased release schedule with a larger staff. They literally cannot even offer Wani's recent catalog in a decent time frame and yet they want to fuck up more stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, even just for the X-EROS magazine alone assuming one per month, that's gonna be like 3-4 years playing catchup.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/s/0d5be8c98e/35<wbr>894-4</wbr>  <br>You're not being fair, the only way for them to release more content is if they grow. But you won't support them because they won't release enough content. Aren't they doing xeros and kairakuten now? how big is their team, that is a massive undertaking on its own</br>  <br>yes undoubtedly I can't wait to fap to freshly released hentai from 2015 in 2060</br>  <br> replying to yourself </br>  <br> So this is where I was born from </br>  <br>Fuck off Daiz.</br>  <br>It's Bobobo, like anon told you earlier, which is removed for Wani.</br>  <br>What exactly is 'fair'?<br><br>The fact that they made their business out of pirating the work and translations of other people, and are now issuing takedowns against those people so they don't have competition on their piracy ring because they told you they're going 'legit'?</br></br></br>  <br><br>And they've been 'going legit' for a long time now. Let's see if they even remove h-manga at the end of this month like they said they were.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I wonder what it would take to get it through your thick head that they didn't have anything to do with the Wani DMCAs. Tenboro said the DMCAs came from Wani, literally every other scanlator that got them said they came from Wani. Unless your argument otherwise is that Fakku was puppeteering Wani, and even went as far as to send themselves a DMCA to cover it up.<br><br>Just drop that from your argument, because it makes you look stupid. Especially because the whole "building your fanbase on piracy" is a halfway legitimate point.</br></br></br>  <br>LIAR THERE WAS NO LOLICON OR FEMDOM IN THAT!</br>  <br>The problem it seems he has and me as well is that they are looking for other publishers to make partners with when they can't even produce a fraction of the content their current publisher has. <br><br>If they made a new partner that publisher would gain a vested interest in sending out takedowns to western sites just like wani. Then we get into the same situation with that new publisher where we get less translations of stuff it is going to take fakku years to do if they ever even get around to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you referring to yourself in third person, Jewcob? Fuck off.</br>  <br>Do we have to start with this again?</br>  <br>That anon is right. If people stopped trying to pin the takedowns on fakku which has been proven multiple times to be false they would have a lot more ground to stand on</br>  <br> I wonder what it would take to get it through your thick head that they didn't have anything to do with the Wani DMCAs <br><br>Dude, they have a contract deal with wani. They hired scanlators who basically ran blogs that barely anyone knew about. Are you fucking going to tell me that wani knew about the english translated releases of YQII, and the massive amounts of wani galleries running under pseudonyms on a handful of unremarkable websites?</br></br></br>  <br><br> still using the exact same terms to samefag and shill with <br><br>Jesus christ just fuck off already, it's so obvious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Daiz.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833912/3a1661<wbr>13b8/<br> 25 pages <br> 3mb <br><br>Wut.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/filena<wbr>me/1406450752439.png<br>Your other advertising thread was removed and you instantly go here, Daiz.</br></wbr></br>  <br>I saved it from that post anon, do you know how filenames work on 4chan?</br>  <br> responding to samefagging shills <br><br>Why even bother?

I just hope I can find a translator for Takatsu again.</br></br>  <br>Anybody who believes that Wani wouldn't, at the very minimum, make Fakku assist in locating material hosted on scanlator blogs and places like panda as one of the conditions of the licensing agreement is painfully naive.

Wani is just a piece of shit anyway.</br></br>  <br>I was here during the purge and I remember fakku announcing their deal at the same time. Purge happened on july 24th, 2014. There's forum links of fakku where they got slammed with DMCAs in March and jacob was in talks with wani to keep their pirated content on their site by striking a deal.</br>  <br>Does Tenboro post the DMCAs he gets somewhere?</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/801871/58037b<wbr>fd64/</wbr>  <br>No, but we did get this tidbit:<br>http://forums.e-hentai.org/index.ph<wbr>p?s=&amp;showtopic=167500&amp;view=findpost<wbr>&amp;p=3446965</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> there are snakes in the grass <br>Wow</br></br>  <br>E-Hentai received takedown notices from Wani to get rid of content around the same time as everyone else in April (see eg. ). Most sites removed Wani content back then already, but E-Hentai didn't - it was just "hidden" in the secret club. That's why they got a second takedown later, after which they actually removed the content. So in reality the purge already started months earlier, it just took a bit longer until it actually reached the panda.</br>  I know this isn't /r/ but I'm in dire straits, I need anything with eye bags, which as I believe aren't tags on panda so I don't know where to start.  <br> MILFs edition. <br><br>Oh yiss</br></br></br>  <br>Why not jus say Mother's edition.<br><br>I dislike the term MILF.

They sent a DMCA notice to 4chan, 4chan complied.</br>  <br> This is scary as fuck <br>Are you really that scared by moderation?<br>You really haven't ever known anything ever actually scary, have you?<br>Melodramatic anon, pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>So, linking Fakku stuff directly on 4chan isn't allowed?<br>I guess it's okay. My only fear is that it might expand to other occasions.</br></br>  <br>An entire panda thread was deleted after someone posted a link to fakku stuff. This just seems to have been removed from the catalog.</br>  <br>It's the first rule of the site, so go figure.</br>  <br>It's still in the catalog if you have the thread pinned, like I do.</br>  <br>the thread is still in the catalog; the content in op's post has just been deleted</br>   tfw fakku is oppressing you   I think umaru chan is giving me mental troubles.<br>I really want to like it, it's cute and all but watching it in my undies, unshaven and miserable only makes me even sadder.<br>The world of umaru is perfect, cute and cuddley and the real world is disgusting, foul and depressing.<br>Umaru is so happy that it makes me depressed.<br>Anyone else feel that way or should I seek medical help?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seek help</br>    well when she grows up shes going to be a bag of shit like you if she continues indulging like that so there's your consolation  <br> The world of umaru is perfect, cute and cuddley and the real world is disgusting, foul and depressing. <br>Your first anime? Otherwise </br></br>  <br> Your first anime? <br>No. I usually avoid overly cute stuff. When i watched azumanga 10 years ago I didn't have that problem for some reason.<br>But this anime is giving me real "brb gensyoko" vibes.<br>I'm sitting here in my appartment in my underpants, a fully grown man with a beard in a disgusting 3D world and I'm voyeuristically peeking into this perfect 2D world of umaru and her brother.<br><br>It doesn't feel right and depresses the shit out of me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What exactly prevents you from shaving, wearing nice clothes, cleaning your fucking room, excluding all 3DPD people who can ruin your day from your life and creating a perfect 2.5D bubble around yourself to enjoy?<br>If you just sit there being jealous it's only your fault your life is shit.</br></br>  Is this why Umaru-chan is so hated on /a/? Because she lives the life everyone here wants but doesn't have?  <br>Most of it is because she's annoying and spoilt. But there must be lazy anons who can't be assed to clean their apartments up too.</br>  <br>Man I would kill to have an adorable and talented otaku imouto to spoil. You guys are looking at it all wrong.</br>  <br>Thats a 10000 yen fine Anon.</br>  WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?  <br> What exactly prevents you from shaving, wearing nice clothes, cleaning your fucking room, excluding all 3DPD people who can ruin your day from your life and creating a perfect 2.5D bubble around yourself to enjoy? <br>The fact that I have to go outside... well should. I haven't been to university in a few months because I panicked and couldn't stand 3D people anymore.</br></br>  <br>The moment you stop giving her attention she turns into a fucked up gyaru that sucks old men to compensate.</br>  <br>You feel guilty watching something that glorifies this lifestyle because you know the reality of it. You're subconsciously comparing yourself to the oblivious and happy Umaru and wish you could live without this guilt on your shoulders. Normally you'd be able to dodge the anvil of emotion by escaping into the world you're watching but knowing that this world is a brighter version of yours, you know you'd only darken it and be back in your own despicable shoes.<br><br>But fear not. <br>If there's an anime that makes you feel guilty about your lifestyle, you may change, you may be your own beacon of light that finally dusts off this depression and lack of motivation. In the end, you might actually have your life improved by an anime.<br><br>Either that or you'll feel bad for a minute, go back to masturbating and collapse under the weight of your own uselessness. After that you'll go back to the same old same old without having changed at all. I'm placing my cash on the second option.<br><br>In short. This is not for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you majored in computer science<br>Only major that rewards you for being a shut-in autist.</br></br>    <br> her solving the captcha at the end </br>  <br> I hope you majored in computer science <br>History.<br>There was just too much pressure and too many people. I didn't feel like going outside anymore.<br>I failed all exams because I didn't attend a single one this semester.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> In the end, you might actually have your life improved by an anime. <br><br>Going off of that, if you haven't watched Welcome to by NHK get OP, I think you'd benefit from it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss our old captchas.... NOT.</br>  <br> Going off of that, if you haven't watched Welcome to by NHK get OP, I think you'd benefit from it. <br>I hated the part where he got a job.<br>I read the manga though. No idea how the anime ends.<br>I also hate genshiken and how happy those otaku all turned out to be.</br></br></br></br>  Take a shower and clean up your room, retard.  it feels kind of dark to me, like umaru's carefree world is a house of cards, ready to topple over at any moment. <br>where shes totally dependent on nii-chan for companionship, dinner, shopping, and so many things.</br>  <br>Your aversion to happy endings might be keeping you from your own happy ending.</br>  Vol. 3 cover revealed. More tributes to Norman Rockwell. Meanwhile Dick Suck's vol. is currently sold out. Episode 12 nowhere in sight. When will the suffering end?  Why is the OST for this show so good?  <br>That'd be great, but I thought each new cour of Durarara is 12 episodes?</br>  <br> what was the point of the recap episode if it was going to throw it even more off schedule, anyway? <br>Scheduling must have gotten fucked and the episode just wasn't ready to air yet</br></br>  <br>They took advantage of the fact the setting in anime was very diverse and incorporated it into the OST.</br>  <br>It's 12, but it'll probably air the week after it finishes since the slot is probably for 13 episodes at most.</br>   Supposing. Supposing if. If those feelings became anything special. <br><br>Where were you when 8man wondered if he could still go down the Yui Route?<br><br>(vol. 11 ch. 9 translation http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi )</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't a formal request so she doesn't have to. I don't get why she even brings it up, it isn't as if genuine meant anything to her.</br>   It was faint, hardly reliable and the form it took was indistinct. But they definitely were linked, and they will definitely become one. If only, if wishes could materialize. That is definite…… <br><br>He meant Yui and him or Yui,him and Yukino? It seems the 3 wishes are linked.</br></br>  <br>All 3; he monologued this after Yukino asked the other two to hear out her request (her wish basically)</br>  <br>Does this actually happen in the show or what?</br>  <br>The 3 want the genuine.</br>  8 years  Quality memesubs.  <br> How can anyone like what I don't like? <br>Spoken like a true autist</br></br>  <br>And translators still can't translate tautologies for shit?</br>  <br>Why do you feel the need to lash out? Is it because of your shit taste?</br>  <br>the ironing</br>  うわわ<br>Happy birthday Retard Master</br>  <br>He also had his hand in his pant's pocket in the very first shot of the Washizu match, so I'm guessing it's just a nasty red herring.</br>  <br>Dunno, didn't see the raws yet, only a few spoiler pics. Anything from Kinma that's not Akagi isn't really popular.</br>  <br>I know that he's supposed to have his assets ready to go at that point but that place looks like a rich person living room instead of a eccentric psychopath kill room.</br>  <br><br>That will not be tolerated.<br><br>They're going down.</br></br></br></br>  <br> trying to rip off saki  <br>Disgusting. <br>If you're going to do that you have to be sneaky about it like Girls und Panzer.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
