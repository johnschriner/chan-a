[ MEN flashback  finally  confirmed for this month.  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>I love Annie from the bottom of my heart and the core of my soul<br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  EH is canon.  YH IS BEST SHIP.  <br>That picture is actually fun, Is from pixiv?</br>  <br>What the FUCK.<br><br>I was supposed to be making the thread you piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127703791 <br>I am not Allahshitter.</br>  <br>Nobody wants you threads, in case you forgot.</br>  <br>Fuck you Jean you slow shitty horse</br>  Can we all just talk about MEN please    Would Bert suck MT's dick if it meant Reiner's safety? Would Reiner? How low would they stoop to protect each other?  <br>Who is that guy to the right?</br>  <br>Sometimes pixiv gives nice things.<br>Other times pixiv makes you wish the world would implode.</br></br>  <br><br>MARCO HOLD ME BACK.</br></br>  <br>Fuck yes. Seeing Mike again after so long is going to do strange things to my body.</br>  <br>What if they think Mike is still alive? Would MT acknowledge Mike's death when they meet?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>M is dead.</br>  <br>Isn't this artist a shotacon yet she's a school teacher?</br>  <br>Reiner already has.</br>  <br>I think it's Kitts.</br>  <br> those holes in the armor </br>  <br>I don't think they're a school teacher. They are a shotacon though.</br>  Who Hanji Levi/Mikasa Sasha here?  <br>Yes.<br><br>H/she also draws Erwin as the ultimate semen demon.</br></br></br>  <br>At least she has taste and doesn't draw him with the manlet.</br>  Reminder that EM and YH are canon.  <br>Erwinfags usually don't like the shitlet.<br><br>It's almost always the manletfags that like EL.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no need to remind us of what we already know.</br>  <br>You know what's bad<br> Erwinfags who don't like Levi <br> Historiafags who don't like Ymir <br> Reinerfags who don't like Bert <br>All of you are scum.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, people get so insecure over retarded trolls. Which is exactly what they want, it validates their sad existences.</br>  We're talking about MEN. Stop getting off topic faggots.  <br> heart pupils </br>  <br>Literally everything you said makes no sense. Why do Erwinfags have to like the shitlet?</br>  <br>SHe's also a disgusting shotacon kindergarten teacher who draws for DC now.</br>  <br>I can understand them since it must be frustrating to see your favorite character being labeled as nothing but Levi's friend/Ymir's friend/Bert's friend when there's much more to them. But yeah it's still pretty dumb to take it out on threads.</br>  <br>Because Levi is his loyal waifu.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Levi is a horrible character and will die alone and a virgin.</br>  <br>They have a close bond so you would think Erwinfags would respect his canon relationships.</br>  <br>It's dumb because without them their characters would be nowhere.</br>  <br> character being labeled as nothing but x's friend <br>That never happens though, don't delude yourself. If anything I see Ymir being labeled as Historia's lesbian stalker and Bert as just Reiner's flunky more often than I see the opposite.</br></br>  <br>You're retarded for even taking his word as a fact, when it never happens.</br>  <br>You sure are defensive, Ymirfag.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> Paring Erwin with Mike because look like two bears <br>At least is a honest taste based only in how they look</br></br>  <br>I respect they have a deep sense of trust and admiration for one another, yes. Doesn't mean I get off to fujoshit fantasies of them dicking each other while saying they love each other and they're practically married it's so canon.</br>  <br>I'm defensive for telling you that you're wrong? You're just retarded.</br>  <br>I'm not him.</br>  Official character rankings: <br><br>1: Armin<br>2: Hange <br>3: Ymir<br>4: Erwin <br>5: Jean<br>6: Sasha <br>7: Eren<br>8: Mikasa <br>9: Annie<br>10: Bert<br>11: Reiner<br>12: Historia <br>13: Connie<br>14: Levi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why fujos always try to force their delusion into canon? That's why men can't be friends in fantasy anymore.</br>  <br>Honestly this</br>  <br>I'd say reverse that but only if Armin should replace Levi.</br>  <br>How the hell is the coconut head in first place?<br><br>I thought bitches loved alphas.</br></br></br>  <br> Ymirfag in charge of being subtle <br>You deserve the Allahfagging.</br></br>  Reminder that Armin and Eren are in love.  <br>Ymirfags used to call Historia her accessory so I think the YHfag thing is about equal now, don't you think?</br>  <br>I don't recall that happening.</br>  <br>YHfags used to see them as equals and still do, fag.</br>  <br>I recall that happening a lot.</br>  <br>Authors just need to learn how to write close friendships better.</br>  <br>Nah I wasn't implying fujoshit. Sometimes it's hard to tell if some Erwinfags hate his canon relationship with manlet or if it's just strictly the fujoshit they hate.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Spoiler that shit.</br>  <br>Actually I do. A lot.</br>  <br>It's fine, keep being in denial.</br>  <br>Depends in what context and if that person even likes one of them.</br>  <br><br>That never happened, if you were even here for the kidnapping arc you would know, but now you just want to shitpost</br></br>  <br>To be fair, Griffith and Guts relationship is a psychoanalsis nightmare picnic.</br>  <br>CONNIE'S A GOOD BOY<br>DIN DO NUFFIN</br></br>  <br>Stop trying to make excuses. The point is that Ymirfags used to do the same thing so you have no reason to whine about it when you guys had no problems doing it in the past. It's a different story now when the tables are turned though I guess.</br>  <br>It never even happened you fag.</br>  <br>I question this too. I think only because of shipping reasons because most Erwinfags here ship ME, NE, or Erwin/Anka.</br>  <br>Not really, also nice generalizing as always.</br>  <br>They're equally bad.</br>  <br>EATING MUFFIN</br>  <br> A small portion of Ymirfags think something <br> All Ymirfags think this </br></br>  <br>It's mostly just from Griffith's part. He's a spoiled, cocky asshole who doesn't handle loss well.</br>  <br>Reminder that Jean cucked Eren while he eyecucked Mikasa</br>  <br><br>Stop generalizing Historiafags then. Not all of us hate Ymir and not all of us just think of her as a creepy lesbian stalker.</br></br>  <br>I thought people were talking about YHfags and no Historiafags. YHfags do see Ymir as the creepy, lesbian stalker</br>  <br>A real YHfag sees them both as individual characters with their own depth and qualities.</br>  <br>Don't worry, I don't.<br><br><br>Pretty much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck?<br>Did you even read what I said?<br><br> Read something about not generalizing <br> All of you stop generalizing me after you just said generalizing is bad <br>Bitch! I just said generalizing is bad, but it seems like you're some kind of autist who can't understand for shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YHfags do see Ymir as the creepy, lesbian stalker <br>No</br></br>  <br>Listen friend, get out with your Yuri kumas first of all.</br>  <br> Ymirfags </br>    <br> that chin </br>  <br>How many times do you think Reiner has woken up like this?</br>  <br> those lips </br>  <br>I hate these uncanny valley renderings.</br>    <br>Holy fuck i'm so handsome lmao.</br>    <br>Reiner's a lucky man, if you exclude the kicks in the gut.</br>  <br>Do not bully the Annie.</br>  <br>You must really hate Jean</br>  <br>No he's just retarded.</br>  <br>Jean is a horse.</br>  <br>Jean is my waifu.</br>  <br>Horses are majestic.</br>  <br>Bert is taller than all of them.</br>  <br>Chingekis a cute. Is there more similar art of Jean?</br>  <br>Except for Mike.</br>  <br>Well, I guess horses need love too.</br>  <br>Yes they're very beautiful creatures.</br>  <br>100/10</br>  <br>I believe Mike beats everyone.</br>  <br>I don't suppose this eggplant would count</br>  <br> chingeki </br>  <br>Mike is taller, but I don't know if he counts because he was a minor character.</br>  <br>This is the only fujo delusion I can enjoy.</br>  <br>fag</br>  <br>but I'm a little grill.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127706555 <br> 555 <br>Yummy Curry confirmed.</br></br>  <br>I like Bert's sleeping positions. Will we ever get filler for it?</br>  <br>I want that</br>  <br>Hopefully Isayama will put some filler during Utgard. I would have hopes for the manga too but BR are always on the run.</br>  <br> 2 <br>faggot</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127706817 <br>Im a Believer</br>  <br>Muh nigga post more best pair</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127706817 <br><span>youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ  [ ]</br>  I'm going to marry Historia!   read last thread <br> everyone shitting on waifu because of petty shipping wars <br>Life is eternal suffering.</br></br>  Cannon anons  Hey you faggots, my girlfriend likes Mikasa and browses this thread, so you fuckers better stop shitting on her.  <br/>  <br>I want to see:<br>How jean and irwin convince the king to send the MP<br>One sasha scene to see what she was doing<br><br>Levi and pastor nick scene<br><br>MORE mike scene before he died</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're going to keep posting this Tumblr shit at least spell canon right you fucker.</br>  <br>Mikasa is a meme character.</br>  <br>Memekasa</br>  <br>Cannon is with two ns, canon is bad</br>  <br>Nikon &gt; Canon</br>  <br>Connie &gt; Nick</br>  <br>Every time I see this I feel my autism brewing when I notice how I missed coloring in Mikasa's leg.</br>  <br>We know, Eren.</br>  <br>Must be nice being so delusional.</br>  <br>Shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Manlet &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Connie</br>  <br>Why do you hate Connie so much, Ymirfag</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>I want to see up Historia's robes.</br>  <br>My face when my secret yumikuri folder is found by my roommates</br>  <br>Don't lie to us, you live in your parents' basement.</br>  <br>Shit, I'm an Ymirfag but Connie is best boy</br>  <br>Who doesn't, honestly?</br>  <br>kek 8/10</br>  <br>I'm not a NEET</br>  <br>Reiner pls.</br>  <br>I couldn't read all spoilers; just tell me, is Keith a cuck?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127708557 <br>If you're experiencing so much pain, then why don't you drink poison or something?

If only Manlet could bring Erwin and Mikasa together to interact at least once. I don't know if Erwin could handle two qt OP Ackerman in the same bed, though.</br>  <br>Fuck of you want a size difference replace manlet with Historia</br>  <br> if </br>  <br>Historia isn't into adult men.</br>  <br>Who cares if she is or isn't.

I got more on my other computer though, posting best one and best ass.</br>    I'm mad at the fact that YP is making Spyro quit<br>but the reactions are funny as fuck</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  He didn't say that he quit yet, calm down.<br/> </br></br>  Just let it die Anon.<br>Translations will come soon then actual discussion can begin.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  Believe in Spyro, I'm sure he'll keep doing God's own work to save us from Yen Press.<br><br> SAMPLE </br></br>   Reasons to not kill yourself in 2016 <br> .... </br>  <br> vol 11 established that no one will get hurt by it. Yukino won't be hurt if she confesses and he rejects, Yui won't be hurt if 8man chooses a woman that isn't her.<br><br>The loser will be fine. The love triangle isn't even an important plot point going forward. Right now it should be as simple as picking coleslaw or red beans and rice</br></br></br>  <br>Why not today?</br>  <br>none <br>because I know moon</br></br>  <br> Translations will come soon then actual discussion can begin. <br>See you in 12 years</br></br>  <br>Damn, those two are fine.<br><br>Why doesn't 8man try to pick 2 flowers instead of 1? That is the ending he should work for. Yui loves Yukinon, Yukinon is okay with Yui, neither of them have a jelly streak, and neither wants him for herself.</br></br></br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  <br>because there's a better option out there.</br>  <br>That's a great idea. You seem like a smart guy. Can I shake your hand?</br>  <br>Well they do have jelly streaks, but I don't think it's anything that would be an issue given the relationship between them.<br><br><br>And this guy thinks he's a comedian.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wanting a threesum end ever <br>I'm a yuifag, but I'd rather have a yukino end over that bullshit any day</br></br>    <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't I want that? <br><br> Yuifag <br>No, you aren't. You just posted a greedy, thieving whore and is pretty enough to have almost any guy she wants.<br><br><br>I have not watched a second of index in my life so I don't know what this means.<br><br><br>Neither of them have been jelly over the other at any point so it would work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> stick figure <br> brain problems <br> compulsive liar <br>I'd pick Totsuka.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep Press is shit. Spyro-sama is a bro. Yukino is perfect.</br>  <br> not wanting a threesome end <br>Yuifags, everybody.</br></br>  <br>Kek. That's brutal, anon.</br>  <br>Yuckyno is far from perfect.</br>  <br>Eh fuck you, I'm Yuifag too but threesome ending is even better</br>  <br>Picking more than one girl is for indecisive faggots</br>  <br>Recently she's been a little less than perfect, but she's still better than most.</br>  <br> threesome ending is even better <br>That was my point, yuifuck.<br><br> not wanting more than one girl is for faggots <br>fix'd that for you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the girls love each other and you love both of them it means a life filled with joys no monogamous relationship could ever know.</br>  <br>Yui looks so soft.</br>  <br> Yuckyno  <br>THK pls go.</br></br>  <br>the only people who want harem ends are people who have no faith in their ships or were never in one to begin with</br>  <br><br>do you enjoy being a beta that can't face the (painful) reality that he must choose one and make the other suffer and instead turns to indecision and cowardice? <br><br>sasuga anti-yuifags</br></br></br></br>  <br> anti-yuifags <br> implying <br>It's fairy tail ending, get it?<br><br>Also, been yuifag since 2013, not like those cowards that jump ship when things got worse for their waifu.<br><br>Of course, I'd prefer Yuifags over any other single ending, but<br>  I want everything forever <br>Is a fantasy to behold</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukinoshitter pls go.</br>  <br>I want to massage Yui and Yuigahama Mama's yuis.</br>  <br> he must choose one and make the other suffer <br>Protip: The loser won't suffer<br><br>Yui is emotionally stable and would be fine in a week.<br><br>Yukino isn't that attached the 8man and his idea of genuine so losing may not even affect her much at all.<br><br>8man will be able to reject one without hurting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Anyone who wants 3P ending knows it's not feasible. Doesn't mean it's not the ideal situation. Let's look at how things would stack up from there, shall we?<br><br> 8man marries Yui in an official capacity' <br> Yukino enters political marriage with Hayato <br> He's an actual cuck and willingly uses the Hayama family's clout to hide the fact that Yukino is living "in sin" with the Hikigayas <br> Yumiko finally gets over the spineless douchebag <br> Gets into an argument with Saki that turns into hatesex then regular sex. They eventually open a daycare center together <br> Iroha gets into voice acting, marries Zaimokuza, they both get realize their dreams. <br> Ebina finally takes Tobe because he's too dumb to realize what she means when she says he has to be the uke. <br><br>Everybody wins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn it, Spyro. Don't give up. Host the translation on Sweden server and everything will be OKAY. Do it for Yukino.</br>  <br>ITT: we motivate Spyro.</br>  <br> doing it for Cuckino <br><br>He'll abandon it then.</br></br></br>  is haruno a sociopath  Genuine 1.0 made the girls fall hard for him<br><br>Did genuine 2.0 do the same?</br></br>  <br>Yep</br>     you will never have yahallo gf     <br>No, she's just trying to stop her sister from becoming completely dependent of Yui and Hachiman</br>    <br> Cuckino <br> Cuck <br>Yuifags are the worst</br></br></br>  <br>And depend on her instead? <br><br>Hello, Satan.</br></br></br>  <br>enjoy your yo 'sup gf</br>  What do you think Gahamama will do once she finds out her little Yui is in love with Hikki-kun?  <br>Technically that is THK. He is a Yuifag though.</br>  <br><br>The best</br></br>  <br>don't trigger me anon</br>  <br><br>Then he has some pretty fine taste.</br></br>  Why did Yui only decide to start trying to get 8man after she found him alone in a room with the prettiest girl in school?  <br> Not best girl <br> fine taste </br></br>  <br><br>She already knows. Or at least she knows her daughter has a crush on her Hikki. She might not realize it's driving burning intense love.</br></br>  Why did Spyro leave? I haven't been in the threads since before S2 started because they immediately turned into the worst kind of cancerous shit.  <br>Yui isn't even in the top 3.</br>  <br>Because she found an excuse. Cookies for the Cookieman.</br>  <br>she wants Yukino to become independent</br>    <br>Touma is extremely talented though.</br>  <br>depressed because vol. 11 made Yukino's character more frail than anything</br>  <br>where my touma/yui bros at?</br>  <br>Isn't she supposed to win, though?</br>  <br>Can confirm the good taste.</br>  <br> driving burning intense love. <br>Does Yui really love him that much?</br></br>  <br><br> Yuckynofags' opinion <br> worth anything at all </br></br></br>  <br>You have no idea, 777</br>  <br>There was some discussion about friendship end.</br>    <br>Damn. Still though, it's just one of those things where she'll win anyways, because it's obvious from the start, so I don't get why he'd be worried about his waifu losing or anything</br>  <br>Irohasu~</br>  <br>It's not that, he was just disillusioned at seeing moeblob Yukino.</br>  <br> yukino winning <br>Incoming surprise  Sagami  end</br></br>  <br> THK's shitposting and "opinion" <br>Literally worthless.</br></br>  <br> implying WW can't asspull harder than the sun. </br>    <br>I was under the impression she fell out of love with him.</br>  <br>Nah, it's pretty obvious that the winner will be sensei<br>8man even said he'd marry her if no one else did so</br></br>  <br> likes Yui <br> likes Megumi <br> likes Silver <br><br>Say what you want about his shitposting, his taste is exquisite.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bottom of barrel Yukinofag <br>You're worthless.</br></br>  <br>It's understandable. Yukino turned into literal shit.</br>  <br> moeblob mode, the only thing that makes Yukino different from other Generic 10/10 Long Black Hair School Ace Ice Queen Heroine is a negative to the most prominent Yukinofag <br>what</br></br>  <br>People love dem stereotypes.</br>  <br> turned into <br>heh</br></br>  <br> None are best girls <br> Silver is the absolute worst bitch <br>THK's taste is shit, m8.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you people even argue about the taste of a boogeyman?</br></br>  いろはす～  <br><br>Megumi being best girl is indisputable. You have to have literal shit taste to think otherwise. Silver is slightly arguable, but you could make a decent argument for Pink being best. Yui is probably the weakest link but still solid.</br></br>  Brothers?  Why didn't 8man pin Yukino down against her will and used her pussy like his personal cock holster?  <br> personal cock holster <br>Well at least you're being creative this time, try a bit more succinct</br></br>  <br>Who would?</br>  <br>Nekohasu~</br>  <br> friendship end. <br>I would not watch the ED just to say I dropped this show.</br></br>  <br>No matter what happens, I will always love Saki.

Wish we could have seen more of this hair though  <br>Still here.<br><br> http://imgur.com/a/VuMzL </br></br></br>  Threesome end can't happen because it's the easy way out. A fucking cop out so to speak ans therefore it's not genuine. They need to sort their problems and come up with the result that prioritize what they want, but this is impeded by Yukino's lack of capability in having her own wants in the first place. Basically this all boils down to Yukino being broken the fuck out and there would be no consensus until she can decide for herself what she wants without being manipulated by any bitch and whoever don't get the 8dick would just have to move on.  If 12 is the last one, what are the chances FEEL makes an OVA in tandem with the release of it  <br>Friendship end would be a cop-out, Threesome end would just come off like a cop-out because there's no way Watari could handle it properly.</br>   mfw Yui and Yukinon realize they love each other   <br> against her will </br>  <br> Yukino <br> will </br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> pussy </br></br>  <br> Yukino </br>  <br> Yuki </br>  <br> Yu </br>  <br> Yukino loves pussy <br> Yui loves bitches <br>seems about right</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather have this show becoming Bara and having Hachiman ending with a guy than a friendship ending.</br>  <br>Don't fucking insult Sable he's a manly man</br>  <br> Sable <br> Manlier than Kamakura </br></br>  <br>Kamakura looks like a fucking faggot<br>look at that face he's basically asking for dick<br><br>Sable is dignified and intelligent which is why he realized the hopelessness of his existence and tried to commit suicide</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the face of a faggot. Kamakura looks like a friendly trickster, willing to humour people, but never going too far.<br><br>On the other hand, Sable just looks kinda mean and also dumb. No wonder he ran out on the street. My friend Kamakura would never have done such a stupid act.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're both off the mark in a number of ways.<br><br>Sable's sharp gaze and furrowed brow speak of a master tactician. He knew his owner would face trouble later in life without a man who could protect her from the more sinister elements of human society, and he instantly recognized 8man as the perfect candidate by his baleful fishy gaze. From there it was just a matter of Sable making a small gamble with his own life to put the pieces in motion.<br><br>Kamakura is a wily one though- from that face he's probably the sort of tomcat who'll be related to half the feline population of Chiba by the end of his days. That's the secret of why he's so distant with 8man these days; the little guy is disappointed in his owner for having less than zero game, and disappointed in himself for not being more help in cultivating said game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamakura is that guy who acts retarded and when he's told he's retarded goes "I was just pretending hurr"<br><br>Sable looks mean but he's actually pretty cute, nice biased image, you could have used any of his other art<br><br> also dumb <br>[CITATION NEEDED]<br>How the fuck can you prove that running in front of the car wasn't part of his plan to hook Yui up with 8man?

Was dragging my ass on preordering Yui but now I gotta have her and Yukino too.</br></br></br>  8man won't choose because he has already made up his priorities. As far as romance go, he already "chose" in vol 6 and hasn't changed since (at least from what I can tell in vol 10).<br><br>But people always forget that this series is not all about romance. We'll get at the very least three integral end: character end, friendship end and romance end.</br></br>  <br> If Kamakura actually cared about 8man he would have done something instead of being autistic <br>He knows what he has to do to get his boy a girl, and damn does he do it fine just meowing and shit.</br></br>  <br>Kamakura is a fucking beta male he has no chance with the women. I bet he spends his life on 2ch and mooches off the Hikigayas without doing anything for them. <br>I bet he has a 2D cat waifu and is too scared to kill himself, unlike Sable who would do anything for his owner's cause</br></br>  Wait to translating is kill for years?<br><br>This is some bullshit</br></br>  <br>When Feel redid the S1 scenes, they had them wear their black jackets.

Who know if toriyama is behind this or not ?  <br><br>same as bulma's dad too</br></br>  <br>Think we'll get any episodes focused on Chestnut's family?</br>  <br>you need to get your eyes checked anon i still see 2 feet on krillin</br>  <br>I can't imagine that being much fun.<br><br>A Kame House episode is necessary.</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama is doing the plot<br><br><br>I believe that will be 3rd episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats how Kame seinin leveled up for fighting Freeza's goons. he had to constantly avoid getting beaten by eighteen for his perverted antics.<br><br>there I just gave you an episode</br></br></br>  <br>wait maybe 18 grew?<br><br>she looked tall in the Super OP image but here she's shorter</br></br></br>  Will the third chapter of Kamehasutra ever be translated from Portuguese?<br>Will PBX start making new DragonBall stuff again?</br>  <br>Man imagine how hard it is for Krillin to get laid with perverts like Roshi and Oolong around all the time. Not to mention turtle and Maron.</br>  <br>Shit man. Krillin really robbed the Cradle if 18 is still having growth spurts.</br>  <br>Goten also seems shorter if compared to DBZ. Is it just me?</br>  <br> SSJ4 Goku vs SSGSS Goku. <br>TORIYAMA PLZ</br></br>  <br>Toriyama (and his assistants) were never consistent with height. Vegeta and Frieza constantly changed in the OG manga and series.</br>  <br>its his fault. after the 21st budokai he asked if he could stay at the Kame house for a while longer. that while turned into 30 some years</br>  <br>some anon claimed it wasn't toriyama who was doing the plot. How is this "Canon"? Does the manga follow the anime or is the anime who is following the manga?</br>  How do you go from faggy kid with a bowl cut to glistening Adonis?    Anyone else afraid this new series will be too child friendly? I feel like DBZ is too mainstream now to get away with some of the violent/racy things it got away with in the past.  <br>Nobody is having kids. There are no children in Japan anymore to cater to.</br>   there are actually people who haven't dropped this childish dogshit already   <br>yeah I miss the days when dragon ball wasn't mainstream way back in alternate universe B5</br>  <br>Roshi's basically like Krillin's grandpa at this point. He probably wants to live with his family. Plus there's no rent.</br>  <br>this doesn't answer my shit nigga</br>  <br><br>I think ever since the Buu saga was made, Toriyama had wanted to get back to the roots of Dragonball (more lighthearted, less "epic" fights). That's not to say DB fights weren't good, but they didn't have as much violence as DBZ. I'm thinking Super will probably be similar to the Buu saga in terms of silliness.</br></br>  <br> posting kumiko </br>  Is GT worth a watch even if it's not canon? I always avoided it.  me and my gf loved the first episode  <br> there are actually people who just enter the thread to shitpost and post smug moeblob faces <br>love this place. Stay mad faggot :^)</br></br>  <br>The last episode</br>  <br>It has an amazing ending, and some fun scenes here and there, but no. It's mostly a pain to watch</br>   Haruhichan still has no episode releases <br><br>send help</br></br>  Are Dragon Ball Minus and Jaco the Galactic Patrolman canon?  <br>Yes.</br>  I love Satan's jap voice, his voice is a lot more heroic.  <br> Gf <br>You sound like a   Well rounded individual  </br></br>  <br>Please anon... it hurts.</br>  <br>The show was always child friendly anon</br>  <br>Yeah, I hate mainstream stuff. Hope Dragon Ball never becomes mainstream.</br>  <br>I have very recently watched GT. Solely out of morbid curiosity<br><br>It is really bad. Like I seriously cannot fathom how it was made. <br><br>A few episodes in, you'll understand why it was unpopular in Japan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking source<br>I swear to god if it's taken out of context like the golden frieza 1 billion joke im gonna cap a bitch</br></br>  <br> I feel like DBZ is too mainstream now  <br> Too mainstream now <br> Literally the most popular manga before One Piece <br> Survived for over 18 years on video games and nostalgia alone <br> Got a new series because of two really popular movies <br> Too mainstream now </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's joking anon.<br><br>Toei will really never revisit GT. It only lives on in video games</br></br></br>  <br> A few episodes in, you'll understand why it was unpopular in Japan <br>Nigga, GT was one of the best-selling series in Japan back in the 90s. It outsold Dragon Ball and DBZ.</br></br>   tfw only one decent chi chi figure   <br>Toriyama pretends it doesn't exist ond so should you</br>  <br> 1 billion <br>You calling Frieza a little pussy bitch, faggot?</br></br>  I don't know why but i loved the part where piccolo was watching over Gohan and Videl.<br>He cares so much</br>  <br>Is that why its ratings were in the toilet<br><br>GT has higher sales because it actually had a home release in Japan. Unlike Z which didn't get one until years later</br></br></br>  Super will never have anything as epic as this  <br> epic </br>  <br> epic <br>Also, like all Fusions, it was another anticlimax</br></br>  <br> yfw when you realize Gogeta was a super saiyan god </br>    <br>Post-Cyborg Apocalypse is a helluva drug.</br>  <br>The wrestle mania voice fits so perfectly though. English is better hands down.</br>  <br>Being one of the 5 people who actually enjoyed GT i'd be every happy.</br>  <br>you'll cry at the end, calling it now.</br>   First episode is filler <br> People waited 20 years for this </br>  <br>Am I the only one who hates Bulma's current hairstyle? Even the shit she had in Cell saga was better than this.</br>  <br>I hated that this version of trunks was never a costume in any game. It's his coolest outfit/version</br>  <br>What's the purpose of that jacket?</br>  <br>Slice of life DB is best DB.</br>  <br>What're the odds of us getting great saiyaman Videl in Super?</br>  <br>Didn't teenage Videl hate girly stuff? Why did she become full waifu by DBS?</br>  <br> Drunk saiyaman in BOG <br>I could see Gohan running around as Saiyaman in Super. <br><br>but Videl being fun? Shes WAY too waifu tier now to do something cool like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>to look cool?<br><br>What's the purpose of half the outfits in anime</br></br></br>  <br>Bad. Videl is just a background character now because Toriyama is determined to make his show waifu-free.</br>  <br>so in the manga, the aliens tried to poison beerus and he told him no poison could take him down. Then he blew up everyone &amp; the planet<br><br>in the anime, he said it (the food) was too fat and not good for him, so he only blew up half the planet.<br><br>Nice one Toei</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the hell did Gohan drop the helmet? He looks dumb without it and clashes with Great Saiyagirl's costume.</br>  So they're getting married because she's pregnant right?  <br>Trunks is older than Goten.</br>  <br>Future Trunks was always the best. I wish we would get more of him.</br>  <br>Bulma said it wasn't cool</br>  <br>He dropped the helmet because he wanted to compete in the Budokai as the great Saiyaman but protective headgear is against the rules, and I guess he just never switched back after Buu saga ended.</br>  <br>Gohan beat her. Women need to know their place.</br>  <br>He replaced it because you can't wear a helmet in the Tenkaichi. Since the Tenkaichi is probably where the most folks ever saw him, the headwrap probably became a more "iconic" symbol of the Saiyaman than the helmet ever was. Why go back to a look the public he wants to protect isn't familiar with?<br><br>It's not like he needs a helmet anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>helmets are not allowed in the tenka ichi budokai so he started wearing a bandana and sunglasses.</br>  <br> striking down an entire race that were clearly planning on killing him <br>vs<br> fucking a plant over by destorying half of it and leaving the survivors to a slow and painful death because one of the foods was too fatty <br><br>Yeah Toei, that was WAY too child friendly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That means Broly is canon too. I hope he becomes a new enemy that is stronger than them.</br>  <br><br><br>He also got rid of the cloak. What a pussy.</br></br></br>  <br>God Bulma was such a passive-aggressive bitch in this scene. I loved it.</br>  <br>That's actually Bulma's way of being sincere. When she invites the nameks and Vegeta over to live with her, she reminds them they no longer have homes. Which is in rather poor taste, considering their planets were blown the fuck up after the GENOCIDE OF THEIR RACE.</br>  <br>Why is he wearing a seatbelt?</br>  <br>the characters shown are still alive and no poison (or malicious intent) is mentioned, that's the difference. <br>Regardless of how the planet will be after, since kids don't know any better</br></br>  <br> be manlet <br> your rival is stronger and a tallfag <br> have children <br> my kid is stronger and taller <br>rekt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish this nigga had been in the Buu saga, or even the RoF move</br>  <br>Trunks is basically a male Bulma.<br>even has the same hair color as her manga version.</br></br>  <br> Goku <br> 5'6" <br> tallfag </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree; Vegeta is a shit. He gets outshined by all the other Saiyans. Even his brother gets a better waifu.</br>  <br>I wanna waifu the fuck out of Gure but I don't want to be labeled a pedophile.<br><br>Will she and Tarble ever appear again?</br></br></br>   Still no animal people <br><br>Is it because the animators cant draw them or is it because Toriyama forgot them?</br></br>  <br> toriyama <br> designing anything but some shoddy writing <br><br>ayy the lmao</br></br></br></br>  So is AnimeRG the best group for subs still, or are people sticking with them since they're the fastest?  <br>The only non manlet is piccolo and he's fucking big guy around 8 feet.</br>  <br>Geez how tall is the rest of the cast, Goku towers over them in the OP</br>  <br>DragonTeam is best</br>  <br>They've been really inconsistent with characters' heights lately. 18 has grown like a whole foot since her first appearance and Krillin has always been drawn inconsistently. The only one who always looks about the same is Ox King and maybe also Puar.</br>  <br>Kid Goku's cute</br>  <br>There's a whole planet of animal people that got blown up.<br><br>Tori clearly hates them.</br></br></br>  <br> Recently <br>Toriyama's never been consistent. Y'all need to got rewatch Frieza and Vegeta shapeshift on Namek.</br></br>  <br>He drew Jaco and there weren't any there either, so he probably still forgot them.</br>  <br> gohan <br> not spopovich. </br></br>  <br>Hell, even Ox King was originally bigger than he is now. He use to tower over literally thing. Now? He's probably Piccolo height at best.</br>  So, is the episode out yet?  <br>Vegeta genes.</br>  <br>Of course Genocide loses it's sting when all the victims of the genocide are no longer dead.</br>  <br> Goku <br> 5'6'' <br><br>He is like 5'10'' which is considered tall in Japan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yea</br>  <br>And yet his new villain is a cat and a fat cat.<br><br>Also, I think maybe they replaced the bug aliens with the pigs because they cant draw them the bugs like Toriyama can. I think these maybe animators cant draw anything that doesnt have a humanish face. Even the snake had eyebrows thrown on.</br></br></br>  <br>No. It comes out after Haruhi becomes a God again.</br>  <br>Will the dinosaurs have feathers?</br>  <br>With his hair he is. Shave him and he's 5'6".</br>  <br>Why the fuck has FT never been introduced again?<br>You would think after spending some much time with everybody he would at least come back and say hi or something</br></br>  <br>they were all killed by Buu. when the gang wished for all humans to be revived, they weren't part of it.</br>  <br>the nameks Vegeta killed were still dead, but they still lost their planet</br>  <br>Will DBS even have any dinosaurs period?</br>  <br>Watch the last saga. The Shadow Dragon Saga was brilliant, and the last episode made you feel like they were intent on closing the book for good.<br><br>I support Super and all the new faces we'll get, but GT definitely left a place in my heart. Give it a go. Fuck the canonfags. Akira does not give a fuck. And Teen Bra is pure sex.</br></br></br>  <br>Oolong came back. <br><br>Oh, and Yamchas floating cock sock did too.</br></br></br>  <br> The Shadow Dragon Saga was brilliant <br>You're absolutely, unquestionable retarded.</br></br>  <br>That bitch somehow managed to be even more of a slut than her mother.</br>  <br> anon complements GT <br> Some other dude has to fly in and call foul <br>GT was fun</br></br></br>  <br>it wasn't a bad idea, just was executed poorly. LIke all of GT</br>  <br>Go play Xenoverse. It has him. But he's not as cool as in DBZ.</br>  <br> Anon says something stupid <br> Someone calls him stupid. <br>Yes, that's how /a/ works. Enjoy your stay.<br><br><br> it wasn't a bad idea, <br> Let's suddenly introduce a caveat to the dragonballs and fuck around with how everyone's powers work <br> not a bad idea </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GT was shit, and I say that as someone who has a lot of nostalgia for it from buying bootleg fansub VHS tapes of GT at the mall as a kid.</br>  <br>Not him, but the galaxy exploration arc was definitely the best part of the show. Shadow Dragon Saga was just more chumped Z so were S17 and Baby.</br>  <br>Everything in Dragonball is "Suddenly" introduced. And by good idea, I meant the idea of wishes having a consequence. <br><br>Unfortunately there were a lot of plot holes with that, like the dragons being stronger than king piccolo</br></br></br>  <br>Only things I don't dislike about GT:<br><br>SS4 (could do without the retarded fur and the gay mascara).<br>SS4 Gogeta (they should had made him serious like his movie version though)<br>100x Big Bang Kamehameha, it's cool to use in vidya.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw will never suck on Trunks boy penis   <br> Everything in Dragonball is "Suddenly" introduced. <br>No it wasn't.<br><br> And by good idea, I meant the idea of wishes having a consequence.  <br> Changing the premise of a series 500+ episodes in to create some contrived drama and a boring conflict is good  <br> I don't care about the tone or direction of a series, I just like the idea that "actions have consequences" <br>No, that's fucking stupid and has no place in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice reply. If you watched it, it was a nice condensation of Dragon Ball from the beginning to end, Haze being comedic to the shift in tone starting with Natron's facade as a weakling and ending with Omega, whose design is slightly similar to Frieza's and him being the penultimate villain of that arc. But keep insulting people for actually giving it some credit rather than jump on the "NON-CANON, IT'S SHIT YOU HAVE SHIT TASTE" bandwagon.<br><br>For what it's worth, SSJ4 was better than Super Saiyan God. Leagues better.</br></br></br>  <br>According to the GT Perfect Works or whatever it was called, SS4 Goku was only as strong as Vegito, so God Goku would destroy him.</br>  <br> No it wasn't. <br><br>Name one thing that isn't so I can laugh at you.</br></br></br>  <br> The Shadow Dragon Saga was brilliant <br>That's a bit strong, but it was probably the most solid part of GT.<br><br>Si Xing Long was a bro.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've read and watched every part of the series. You're an idiot who saw "adventure through space!" and thought it somehow captured what the series was always about.<br><br><br>Goku being an alien was foreshadowed the entire time. SSJ was foreshadowed for an entire arc. Someone being a God then someone else being a higher up God has been happening since Kame. The entire Cell/Android saga was Goku fighting an old foe.<br><br>What ever came out of nowhere?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Dragon I like, and the one that was a chick  until she turns into her real form .</br>  So, can I watch this if I haven't seen the newest movie?  <br> Actions have consequences has no place in the series <br> completely ignoring the Android arc which has Goku's actions coming back to haunt him <br> The android arc is full of contrived drama and a desolate future wasteland in a comedy series <br><br>It fits just fine. You're just booty blasted for some reason that people enjoyed an arc you didn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  RoF english subtitles here<br>http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx<br><br>Did he post any progress yet?</br></br></br>  <br> A scientist holding a grudge is the same as divine entities embodying their greed and folly coming to haunt them for a moral abuse of power <br>You're a fucking moron.</br></br>  <br>Delicious blue feet</br>  <br>Toryiama is the one planning the overall plot for the series. He isn't actually the one writing the scripts for any of the episodes though.<br><br>The Super manga is an adaptation of the anime, not the other way around.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it doesn't really matter.</br>  <br> I've read and watched every part of the series <br>I always hear this. This just gives you away so much. I only mentioned the last arc being a reason to watch GT, as it did build up Goku pressing himself to his limits to the point where he died(Shenron revived him, but only for the last attack. Note he faded away afterwards). Sit down.<br><br>And if you read the series like you said, you'd know Goku was based on the main character from Journey to the West. Him transforming under the full moon isn't alien at all. It's a common trope for those who have mammal-based appendages.<br><br>Sit the fuck down.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sweet, thanks.</br>  <br>RoF had Freeza's cut up bits squirming on the ground and Goku being pierced by a beam. When we get serious battles I don't think they'll be any softer than before.</br>  <br> Nigga, GT was one of the best-selling series in Japan back in the 90s. <br><br>Those sales are actually from the early 00s. I'd guess the higher sales happened because it's anime original so people couldn't just buy the manga.<br><br>Anyway, GT's original run on tv was a disaster (the first two episodes are on par with some of Z's lowest in ratings, and it only drops from there, never really recovering). There were also production issues, like the main writer leaving right around the beginning of the Baby arc and then another big writer leaving right after the Baby arc ended.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his just gives you away so much.  <br>Gives me away as what? Someone who doesn't type like a 12 year old from MAL like you do?<br><br> Him transforming under the full moon isn't alien at all.  <br>I never said it was, you fucking retard. <br><br> Sit the fuck down. <br>I wish GT didn't attract so much offboard faggotry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Super's first arcs are going to be extremely extended retellings of the two new movies.<br><br>Extended to such degrees they're still just setting shit up and establishing the characters' current status quo, even. Half the episode was purely about explaining why Goku is hanging out at Kaio's planet when Beerus drops by.</br></br></br>  <br> Goku being an alien was foreshadowed the entire time.  <br><br>No it fucking wasn't. People saying Goku is weird isn't foreshadowing he's an alien. he was originally based on Son Wukong is the monkey king. He's also friends with shape shifting animals and there are other monsters in the world, so you can't even say that's "him transforming into a monkey" is foreshadowing for that.<br><br>  SSJ was foreshadowed for an entire arc. <br>Saiyans and super saiyan are all dropped out at the same time when all this info about Saiyans are coming about. How are you going to complain about magic dragons, and not some monkey aliens from space that conveniently show up after piccolo is defeated? Get the fuck out of here.<br><br> The entire Cell/Android saga was Goku fighting an old foe. <br><br>Which is "Actions having consequences". Something you said doesn't fit in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta is now taller then Bulma in the opening, everyone has magical changing heights. But Trunks was always supposed to be taller, he is a year older</br>  <br>Not to mention when Freeza was standing on the wound and just fucking goku up in general</br>  <br> People saying Goku is weird isn't foreshadowing he's an alien. <br> "Aliens always seem to have crazy hair" <br>And then we see Goku in shot with his crazy hair.<br> Goku gets scanned by RR scanner <br>And then it says he isn't human<br> "What, are you even human?" <br>And then Goku says "probably not."<br><br>You're a fucking moron. Stop posting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the movie retellings will last 3 to 4 episodes<br><br>One to introduce the threat<br>The other for them to come to earth and do their thing<br>And the last for Goku to beat them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No it fucking wasn't. People saying Goku is weird isn't foreshadowing he's an alien. he was originally based on Son Wukong is the monkey king. He's also friends with shape shifting animals and there are other monsters in the world, so you can't even say that's "him transforming into a monkey" is foreshadowing for that. <br><br>He outright tells Piccolo Daimao that he knows he isn't a human, when Piccolo starts saying that no human could compare to him.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bo3<wbr>7377GB5M</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Except he doesn't beat Beerus. I doubt he'll be able to beat Champa either.</br>  <br>Episode 1 is the beginning of the BoG retelling and it's going at an extremely slow pace so far. This is basically Toriyama getting as much time as he wants to tell his story instead of having to condense it into the length of a movie.</br>  <br><br> Shit father <br> bred a bunch of kids who are powerful enough on their own   Not counting Gohan <br> Gohan married Videl meaning huge compensation with money just by letting Mr. Satan pretend to win <br><br>What more do you want?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aliens always seem to have crazy hair  <br>When does this happen?<br><br> And then it says he isn't human  <br>Yeah, at that point in the series he's a monster monkey boy<br><br> And then Goku says "probably not." <br>He knows he has a tail and no one else does, but this also the same world with emperor pilaf, Guran, Baba's monster friends and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Teen Bra <br>She's 10</br></br>  <br> When does this happen? <br>Yamcha says it.<br><br> he's a monster monkey boy <br>What the fuck does this mean?<br><br> but this also the same world with emperor pilaf, Guran, Baba's monster friends and shit. <br>What's you're fucking point? He explicitly states he knows he isn't human. You can't say him being revealed to be an alien later on is dropped out of nowhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Not human. He's a fucking monkey. The only reason you think it means alien now is because you know where the story leads. Goku fucking fought frankenstein, Yamcha fought the invisible man, Upa and Puar fought a vampire.<br><br>Garan is some monster that spits up some unbreakable saliva, and all of sudden you asssume "not human" immediately means alien?</br></br></br>  So who are the best  latino  non-speed subs?  <br>Kek, I'm 6'1". The thought of Goku barely reaching my chest makes me  hard. </br>    <br> tfw you are way taller than Goku and Vegeta <br>Being tall is suffering</br></br>  The animation seems pretty bad.  <br> English is better hands down. <br>Haha, no.</br></br>   foreshadowing  <br> people think Toriyama knew where his story was actually going <br>he made it up as he went and forgot half of it.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So, are there any doujins of Gure?</br></br></br>  <br>No it's not. Sure, we bump our heads into shit from time to time, but tall girls like tall guys. And legs for days. It helps that they are fucking rare too, more willing to take a dick in the ass.</br>  <br> Exactly Goku's height <br>I won't get called a manlet now! r-right..?</br></br>  <br>No and the only r34 is shit</br>  <br>but they poo there</br>  <br>i pray one of the alternate universes in DBS will have him</br>  <br> but I'm not a guy </br>    <br>Then congratulations, you are the 1%. Feels good mang.</br>  <br>he's not in an alternate universe. He's in an alternate timeline altogether.</br>    <br>he doesn't have to remember anymore, the autist that did AF is now Toei's Dragonball Continuity guy.</br>  <br>OH SHIT THAT'S MY FIRST GET IN THE 2 YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. FUGGGG YESSSSS</br>  <br> he killed Roshi <br><br>That still rustles me beyond belief</br></br></br>  <br><br>As another one of these 5, I agree with this post</br></br>   used to mock people for liking female Goku's voice <br> watch BoG and then the first episode of Super <br> suddenly like female Goku <br> think the American dub sounds weird <br>Did this happen to anyone else?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigga so stronk he got his own entire two-page spread.</br></br>  <br><br>Nope. You're simply suffering from shit taste syndrome</br></br>  <br>they could easily just say its a different universe</br>  <br>no, but my view on Gohans japanese voice has changed. I hate the Kai dub of Gohan/Kid Goku. and original Z VA was meh at very best. But Japanese I really like the cute tone.</br>  <br>Please tell me Toriyama didnt really say Friezas power level is 100 quintillion.</br>  <br>never watched an entire dub ep, but adult Goku's voice is forever shit.</br>  <br>I've always liked the sub voice, it's makes Goku hilarious.</br>  <br>What a shame, if they just added 1 extra 0 he'd be at Sextillion.</br>  What the fuck, I'm just watching Yo! Son Goku now and I'm shocked that Lunch is in it. Why doesn't anyone ever mention this when talking about what happened to her?  <br>That doesnt look anything like her.</br>  <br>Tori just "explained" her absence by saying she's in and out of prison a lot. In DBO she sets the world record for most successful prison escapes</br>  <br>cause not that many people watched this garbage oav</br>   “Dragon Ball Super” is a complete continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br><br>What kind of Waifus do you want from Universe 6 /a/?</br></br>  <br>He obviously killed himself on purpose when he teleported Cell to King Kai's planet to let Cell explode, he had time to teleport back out, instead he sat there for like 10 seconds waiting on Cell to explode.</br>  <br>but it was hilarious</br>  <br>Universe 6 already gave me my waifu.</br>  <br>Well, it's kinda a dick move to kill Kaio and then teleport yourself to safety</br>  <br>Loli fighters.</br>  <br>He couldve teleported all of them out in the time it took him to explain what was happening.</br>  <br> American <br> The ultimate enemy </br></br>  <br>In the manga he doesn't explain. He just says sorry, and it feels immediate.</br>  <br>You already got that bratty bitch Pan.</br>    <br>Care to explain that Gohan?</br>  <br>Man I miss old Toriyamas art style. That looks bad. Why cant things be like how they used to be?</br>  <br> Man I miss old Toriyamas art style.  <br> anime <br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan never would have met Videl if Chichi didn't enroll him into school. So that's more Chichi's fault than anything else.</br>  <br>Its called Sayin Dick. powerful stuff.<br> Tamed the smartest engineer in the universe <br> Tamed the strongest Human (unless you guys think Krillin&gt;Videl) <br> Tamed the bitchiest bitch, who in reality just wants a bright future for her kids <br>Don't underestimate the dick that could destroy worlds<br> The fuck's a condom? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Furrie pls</br>  <br> Broly goes SSJG <br> Just his base form with red hair <br><br>I for one, actually would like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can still by looking at his...anything else that hes still degraded.</br>  <br>Weird how they remembered every possible character for that party except Tien and Chaozu</br>  <br>Oh shut up faggot, they've been a part of the Dragonball world since the beginning.</br>  <br>I really like DB filler. I like epic fights but not every episode.</br>   Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br> Videl is about as bland female as it gets, not the strong independent woman from DBZ <br><br> Literal strongest men on earth are maximum beta in the presence of their wife <br><br>Did I miss something or am I stupid?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can some kind anon post the whole ,gif or Webm?</br>  <br>Tenshinhan probably asked "Is Vegeta coming?" and then told them to fuck off when he they told him yes.</br>  <br> Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br>He was always Goku's son. <br><br> Videl is about as bland female as it gets, not the strong independent woman from DBZ <br> strong independent woman <br>she was in high school, what the fuck?<br><br> Literal strongest men on earth are maximum beta in the presence of their wife <br>None of them are beta to their wives. Not even Krillin<br><br>So yeah, you are retarded, and know nothing of the series you're complaining about</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the best SoL anime that has been released in the last decade /a/?  <br><br>Watch it for Pan and watch the Black Star Saga<br><br>AVOID THE BABY SAGA AND SUPER 17 AT ALL COSTS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying that no one will die in DB Super? That is not going to be good. DBZ revolved around people dying, entire alien races destroyed. If they dumb this show down it will fail</br>  <br> Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br>anon, kamehamesutra isn't canon</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, especially after watching Kai's buu saga. That shit will get anyone burned out from all those fights.</br>  <br>First episode already had a victim..<br><br>My childhood memories</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br>Interesting. Another thing I noticed is that Gohan appears to be Goku's son, which makes him and Goten brothers.<br><br>Hm.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's impossible to dumb down dragonball</br>  Why haven't all the SJW and feminists called out DBS for its portrayal of Videl?  <br>  <br><br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she bought Gohan a book? What's so bad about that?</br>  <br>I've seen several people in these threads complain about the sexism but I think they were just baiting</br>  <br>Why would they?

Or the manly spirit literally got beat out of her by Spopovich?  <br>Because he has lost control of his life.</br>  <br>He cucked Gohan</br>  <br>Maybe Dr. Briefs built her into like an adult body in the 5 years after that picture</br>  <br>You'd have better luck getting a Kai torrent.<br><br><br>She could still be, we've only seen her around Gohan who brings out her soft side because she loves him, and Goten/Trunks who she's being nice and motherly to since <br>-She's pregnant<br>-Goten is going to be her brother-in-law</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because his life has lost no meaning.<br>He's not strong enough to be a rival for Goku anymore.<br>Dende is the Guardian of the Earth/Dragon ball Battery so he doesn't have to.<br>The only thing he's got left to live for is Gohan. Basically living vicariously through him.<br>Gohan's basically like his soap opera now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No active torrents for the most popular animu ever made <br>You just fucking suck.</br></br>  <br>They turned him into skinny regular Trunks in Xenoverse, but whenever I say it doesn't make sense, everyone's just pointing out that Future Trunks' old design was "gay".

Also Tenshinhan's kind of a loner who is probably the most estranged out of all of them.</br>  <br><br>He's frustrated that Gohan is going back to the life of being a researcher without putting any effort in training his body to be able to fight. The disgusted look is because Gohan is wasting all of his Potential.<br><br>So since Piccolo isn't strong enough to stay relevant he's going to kick Gohan's ass into gear and make sure he keeps his fighting ability up so he doesn't turn into Yamcha 2.0.<br><br> At least I hope so oh god don't let Gohan become useless </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're getting married soon.

I think anime is out of it's buff phase and now Lean is in.   Personally I think the round chubbier style is best  </br>  <br> Videl is about as bland female as it gets, not the strong independent woman from DBZ <br>she was in high school and learned her place after getting stomped nearly to death by spopovitch</br></br>  <br>He's still got it.</br>  <br>He was fighting freeza soldiers. What does that tell you?</br>  <br>I as well. It was the cutest too</br>  <br>Played by female</br>  I remember reading somewhere that if Gohan went into mystic mode and then into a Super Saiyan he'd be crazy strong.  <br>I most definitely liked that rounder style. <br>They still all have cute personalities</br></br>  <br>Goku should be turned into a girl on accident by the Dragon Balls. But damn that would fuck me up because I would be attracted to him/her and my childhood can't reconcile that my hero role model is now a sexy empowered womyn.<br>But I'd still watch it. And due to Goku's new ovaries he is interested in sexy girl stuff, then Vegeta sees him and falls in love, and they get married.</br></br>  <br>Fanfiction.net isn't a canon source of information</br>  <br>Not that itd do him any good.

That a dude or a chick? <br>The kid i mean. In the show they have a daughter right?</br>  They were probably both found, treated as guests initially, and in their sleep they were restrained, lobotomized, and forced to have sex with each other until she had a baby. They then either ate or skinned both of them (being burnt would have left evidence on the bones) and sent the bones back. <br><br><br>Reasons:<br>1. Saki wonders whether the queerats ever lobotimized a human<br>2. Mamoru/Maria weren't close enough to have a baby so soon. Because of the child's age, Maria would have had to get pregnant less than a few months after leaving. Satoru pulls out when having sex with Saki in the novel, so they know how babies are made.<br>3. The other (less sad) theory is that they had the baby willingly and were killed after. Do you really think the queerats would just wait?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought they were forced to take copious amounts of drugs.</br>  <br> In the show they have a daughter right? <br>In animu is a girl, in novel is a boy.</br></br>  <br>They could've done that to make them have sex and kill Mamoru, then keep Maria alive and lobotomized until the baby was born</br>  <br><br><br>Only the yurifags think this. Think it for a second, the people is SnY only need to feel stress to get to fuck. In the novel it's very explicit that adults fuck with children if the occasion calls it. <br>Maria and Mamoru were in a very stressful situation, the rats didn't need to do anything to make them fuck. After that Maria got pregnant, they soon discovered it and ask the rats to take them. The rats waited for them to be asleep and then killed them.<br>Because if they drugged them, then why not forced them to farm more kids for them?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>when did satoru have sex with saki in the novel?<br><br>Was it when they both went back to search for them?

The way Saber handled her kingdom was right, but when everything goes so smoothly you'll always have people against you. Saber just needed to face the fact that her kingdom was being destroyed and accept it, because everything she did was not a mistake!</br></br>  <br> The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. </br>  <br>He'd have invaded half Europe by now.</br>  <br>Rider was literally the boss of a gang of little kids, where the other retarded guys follow the "cool" dude. Do you really think those guys have something close to a dream? A life goal? Obviously not, they were just mindless and barbaric rapists that didn't know what were they doing. At the end, they're sublimated in a NP because that's the only thing they can do.</br>  <br>The army he'd have at his disposal would be smaller than the one he had back then, proportionally.</br>  <br>Clearly  is correct. Anyone idiotic enough to claim they're a superior earthly King and a son of a pagan deity shouldn't even be able to breathe. Iskander's not being upset over his kingdom's destruction shows how little he cares. "My kingdom's gone because I'm gone? That's okay because it would have been gone anyways." he claims. This is irresponsible to no end.</br>  <br>Alexander acted more like a general than a king.<br><br>He spent most of his life with his soldiers than actual citizens and barely stepped foot in his own homeland since he was always in war campaign after war campaign.<br><br>Alexander isn't right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying the Roman, Persian, and Arab empires afterwards weren't his successors. </br>  <br> Greece <br> Not currently the target of class SS jewry </br></br>  <br>After Arthur died, his kingdom collapsed, his enemies kept invading and taking over his land and eventually pushed his people to the wilderness of Wales where they were eventually conquered and assimilated into the state and culture of their conquerors.<br><br>Calling the modern English Arthur's people is like calling modern Iraqi Gilgamesh's people.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Get a load of this fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>Charisma bro, charisma.

It's "Aionian Hetairoi", "Ionioan Hetairoi" means companions of Ionia , not eternal companions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying dividing your kingdom like that was according to plan <br>That's like claiming your car broke down or house was destroyed &amp; you were lucky enough to use the surviving parts for other things.

There was no true successor.</br>  <br>Are Alexanderfags this braindead?<br><br>Majority of kings spent more time on paperwork than actually going to the battlefield and having a shit ton of meetings dealing with affairs of the kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>By this logic Shirou is greatest of them all.</br>  <br> implying modern-day Macedonia is related to Alexander and is not a bunch of Slavs who just happened to move down there <br> not knowing of the Macedonian region in Greece <br>Get a load of this guy</br></br></br>  <br>Shhh <br><br>not in Zero</br></br></br>  <br>The city he was born in and was capital of the macedonia city-state is still in greece anyway.</br>  <br>Hey, he mentioned Fate/Stay Night first.</br>  <br>Not true, maybe in the modern era but certainly not always. The Roman emperors certainly liked to campaign with their soldiers.</br>  <br>It depends. King Arthur's closer to a composite character than a real figure. Also, Arthur's kingdom collapsed more due to a civil war than the power vacuum left by Iskander's death. Artoria wasn't as good of a father to Mordred &amp; it was more because of others than her fault anyways.</br>  <br>Spain or Russia was bigger</br>  <br>Shirou isn't a king though.</br>  <br>Shirou finds himself dead in most of the Tiger Dojos &amp; in HF's Normal end.</br>  <br>The civil war would have been the fault of the king's leadership, though. <br><br>Shirou is a king.  The Harem King </br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that during Alexander's lifetime, the Greeks, particularly the Athenians, considered him a non-Greek, barbarian savage and he was just barely allowed to participate in the Olympics due to his heritage.<br><br>Only after he conquered the known world did Greeks suddenly start hailing him as the Greekest Greek would ever lived.</br></br></br>  <br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lis<wbr>t_of_largest_empires<br>Get rekt son</br></wbr></br>  Not this shit again.

Give me a break.<br><br>It was technically the largest, but most of the empire was Canada, Australia and Africa, uncivilized shitholes. You can't even compare it to people like Napoleon, who practically conquered the entire civilized world (read: Europe). India was the only relevant part of the British colonial empire.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit, he himself put a sign at a site of one of his victories "Achieved by Alexander and the Greeks, except spartans" without seperating macedonians and the rest. true, most-non macedonians weren't fond of him, due to conquering them, but macedonians were as different from athenians as athenians from spartans, just different city states.</br>  <br>Neither, but Kerry was more correct than any of them.</br>  <br>And now we have got both slavs and turks arguing over his legacy.</br>  <br>He conquered their hearts, /a/non.</br>  <br>Saber's the true harem king</br>  <br>Well not by example, but she did lead nonetheless<br><br><br>Multiverselol</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it the king's fault for not knowing the absolutely loyal and only one knight capable of governing just wanted to watch the world burn.</br>  <br> king's leadership <br>I say it was more to do with the screw-ups of her own guys rather than her own. Galahad apparently cost her many knights of his (totally not Percivals) Grail Quest, Lancelot couldn't hold back his Arthur-boner &amp; screwed the Queen, Gawain was pissed at Lancelot being hoes before bros, Mordred was able to plot against her in all this chaos. In fact, Mordred wasn't a natural creation in the Nasuverse. It ended up being something supernatural which took Arturia down.</br></br>  <br>But England was created by defeating the Anglo Saxons who defeated the indigenous Britons.<br><br>England only exists because Arthur was a huge failure.</br></br></br>  Saber was right, but Iskander was correct.  <br>Basically it was all Morgan's fault. But it's okay, because she went dere in the end anyways.</br>  <br>Same reason she got four in the VN.</br>  <br>True, but the way she lead was a way that couldn't inspire people to become the same way she was. <br><br>It's the king's fault for everything that happens to their kingdom. Absolute power means absolute responsibility for what happens.</br></br></br>  <br> also became the largest empire in history <br><br>Fighting niggers with sticks sure was hard.<br><br> French empire is best empire </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I say it was someone elses' fault. The original Battle of Camlann in the Welsh stories said "Arthur &amp; Mordred/Medraut died here" without specifying which side Mordred was on. For all we know, Mordred may have died on Arthur's side. Just about everything with Lancelot or the Grail was a later addition or originally didn't involve them so this could be another addition.</br>  <br>Sorry but its true in the ancient world as well.<br><br>Quit being retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> he was just barely allowed to participate in the Olympics due to his heritage. <br>And here's the best part: The reason why he was allowed to participate in the Olympics was because he claimed to be a descendant of Heracles, and the judged bought it.</br></br>  Both were right, but neither were correct.  <br> in the Welsh stories <br>The Welsh Annals you mean? Not much of stories, just a list of events that supposedly happened. Yeah, it didn't specify, but very soon after you get to see Mordred playing the role of the villain (a hundred years or so) so take of that what you will.</br></br>  <br>Literally the greatest reason I've ever heard of.</br>  <br> Well not by example <br>Fools and braggarts require a fool and a braggart to inspire them.

All of them are right, even though most of them are wrong.</br>  <br>Depends</br>  <br>Neither was.<br><br>There is no hard and fast rule. <br><br>Iskander led his people on a costly wild goose chase, died and his people got fucked<br><br>Artoria established about 10 years of blissful rule until shit fell down like a house of cards.<br><br>Its just opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   seifuku out <br> not the king of schoolgirl skirts </br>  <br>Except Gil. He was perfect and set up the foundation for humanity to rule the world.</br>  <br>Because they're dirt poor and can't even handle their own.</br>  <br>Arthur fought against the Saxons though right? He was Welsh. So the current England is indeed built on the graves of his people, outside of several talented musicians. Of course that same kingdom is already dead, so maybe he'd be indifferent to it if he saw London.</br>  <br>Gil wasnt right or wrong either.<br><br>He had an opinion and belief on how it should be done and did it.</br></br></br>  <br>Not even close</br>  <br> absolute power <br>If she'd had absolute power, none of that shit would have happened.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>But he did it better than everyone else, died ruling his kingdom properly, and is the best.</br>  <br>Didn't she only think she had a fourth command spell? I only recall her using three, then thinking about using a (non-existent) fourth.</br>  <br><br>He didnt do anything better. If anything his people were the most oppressed and downtrodden.</br></br>  <br>That's still essentially the same plothole in a slightly different configuration.</br>  <br>At least Iskandar isn't a fucking cuck.</br>  <br>Why would she think she has a fourth when she doesn't? She can see her own hand. There's clearly a precedence, probably something to do with the founding families, that Nasu hasn't explained. All they did for the anime was add one more for the Zero parallel.</br>  <br>She did have absolute power in the human sense. Anything she said would be done would have been done. The power she did have she didn't use correctly, however, so her kingdom fell into civil war. <br><br>Obviously no one would say that she was omnipotent.</br></br></br>  <br> cuck <br>Iskandarfags everyone.</br></br>  <br>It was the tough love humanity required to succeed at the time. He still did stuff like kill Humbaba simply for their safety.</br>  <br>Then by your logic, she only had absolute responsibility over what she had power over, which were commands relating to action - not with the hearts of people. Besides, her downfall was caused exactly by people disobeying her orders, so how can you say she has absolute power, even in a human sense?</br>  <br> absolute responsibility for what happens <br>Iskander didn't show so much responsibility either. He grieved &amp; shed tears but no regrets. He didn't see what could he have done to prevent things.</br></br>  <br>But saber actually got cuck'd by Lancelot.</br>  <br>NTRd*</br>  <br>Because she did. She appointed those very people that betrayed her. She failed to inspire loyalty in them and as a result they didn't trust her enough to follow her orders.<br><br>I'm sure if you forced him to tell you what he could have done differently he would tell you, but he recognizes that everything that happened was the result of his actions.</br></br></br>  <br>I have a feeling that backfired one way or another...</br>  <br>It's how these go. True events might find themselves becoming legends due to all the things later writers add.</br>  <br>She let him cuck her. She wanted him to. The only reason why Lancelot got that queen pussy was because Seiba wanted him to. Lancelot admitted that he would have preferred having the king over queen.</br>  <br>He'd probably, like Gil, think it was an unrecognizable abomination.</br>  <br> except spartans </br>  <br>That's barely absolute power. If she had to inspire loyalty in them for them to listen to her, then that's barely even power, just a good relationship. Also, it's not that Saber failed to inspire loyalty in Mordred, it's that Mordred had already been brainwashed by Morgan, so outside factors were also contributing to ruining Saber's commands.</br>  <br>Would he? Iskander was more of a wild ride &amp; a conqueror than a calm ruler. I wonder how he would have handled all the bureaucracy &amp; crap as a king.</br>  <br>well, the fuckers didn't want to join the campaign because "muh won't march under non-spartan king"</br>  <br>Well it basically is.</br>  <br>So?</br>  <br>It occurs to me if Saber had fucked everyone nothing bad would have happened.</br>  <br>Spartans were overrated faggots anyway.</br>  <br>Probably ignoring it.</br>  <br>And Alex was too much of a pussy to conquer Sparta after they sent a witty reply to his mean letter.</br>  Reminder that King Arthur is the most famous cuckold in all of literature.  <br>Or just acted cute around them. Nothing can resist kingly moe</br>  <br>Both were right and wrong in various ways. Iskander was arguably more wrong due to not only following an older line of thinking not in tune with our modern era, but also led his kingdom to an accelerated death.<br><br> B-b-but he died e-early! <br>A proper king would've planned out a succession system and had a backup plan instead of being the only glue keeping all of his generals and advisors together so they go for each other's heads once he's gone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he had already defeated and conquer them along witht he rest of the greek states( I think)<br>But it was in a "I'm going to unify greece way" so he didn't force them to march.</br></br>  <br>In general yea. If you want to be king then fuck no.</br>  <br>I agree. Most of their fights were civil wars &amp; capturing slaves anyways.<br><br>It's a good thing that some kings are allowed to do that. A king unskilled in one area can trust governors or otherwise to do so.</br></br></br>  <br> Enemies invade <br> Saber comes out to meet them <br> Enormous orgy ensures <br> Enemies are too tired to fight </br></br></br></br>  <br> I wonder how he would have handled all the bureaucracy &amp; crap as a king. <br>Are we talking about Nasuverse or the real deal?<br><br>Because the real deal was pretty competent at it. He was tutored by Aristotle himself, he built cities everywhere he went, he tried to stabilize and unify his empire by forcing the Greeks and the Persian nobility to intermarry.<br><br>He just happened to have the misfortune to get really depressed for like a year and die from drinking too much. He was pretty young, and he already had a young child. If he lived for at least a decade more, the dynasty would have stabilized and history would have turned out to be much different.<br><br>He died when he was 32 years old, remember.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even her son?</br>  <br>Neither</br>  <br>It would lead to all of them fighting for exclusive rights to do her.</br>  <br>Especially her son.</br>  <br>It is absolute power in that everything that happened was the direct result of her actions. <br>Bone Morgan&gt;Mordred being born&gt;brainwash&gt;civil war<br><br>I'm sure he could tell you what could have been done differently, but he would never have done them or wanted to have changed his decision.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Especially her son. At the end of Apocrypha, Mordred is full on dad love. Just like in the the twitter AF</br>  Saber. Because it was just a personal thing for her.  <br>She's a king. She would make them all part of the royal harem.</br>  <br> She failed to inspire loyalty in them <br>In Lancelot's case, he was just being a retard though. <br><br> Arthur makes you a Knight <br> Love him and be loyal to him <br> Fall in love with the Queen and fuck her even though you realize you're wrong <br> Arthur trusts you, so he turns a blind eye <br> Continue fucking her hoping to get punishment because can't stop thinking with your dick <br><br> Exposed <br> Arthur has to take action, so he puts you in a kangaroo trial so you can escape <br> Fuck that up and kill everyone anyways, including Gawain's brothers <br> Die with regret that your failed your King <br><br> Come back as a Berserker seeking redemption by wanting to be punished for your sins by your King <br> Accomplish this by trying to kill him at every available opportunity <br> Your King, still too kind, is unable to slay you and backs down <br> On your deathbed, chastise your King for not punishing you <br> "But hurr you're the best Arturia we all loved you and were loyal to you durr" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber. She was a perfect King, she was not wrong. The Fate route goes out of its way to spell that out. She's also stronger than Iskandar as well, so she could lead her armies from the front better than him.</br>  <br>I mean the Nasuverse version. Rider doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would do those things.</br>  <br>In that same vein, we can say that everything that happened was the direct result of Merlin. <br>Enchant sword in stone &gt; Saber king &gt; give her dick &gt; downfall of Camelot<br>Who's fault is it now?</br></br></br>  <br>Everything would have been fine if Merlin had just not gotten involved and let the Saxons conquer the isles. His way of fixing it resulted in a prolonged conflict followed by a clusterfuck of bloody wars sprung from Arturia's family issues.</br>  <br> Lancelot admitted that he would have preferred having the king over queen. <br>What?</br></br>  <br> the purpose of the LN was to show how Kerry was a naive manchild with no moral compass <br>I hope you're not implying what I think you're implying.</br></br>  <br>Really in Gawain's case too. He couldn't get over his hateboner for Lance and effectively stopped his help. Almost everyone screwed up more than Arturia.</br>  <br> everything that happened was the direct result of her actions.  <br> Bone Morgan&gt;Mordred being born&gt;brainwash&gt;civil war <br>are you for fucking real over here</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou is the king of swords.</br>  <br>Einzbern Consultation Room, episode 5, written by Nasu</br>  <br>Lancelot admits it in his Einzbern Consultation Room session. Non-Berserker Lancelot is surprisingly polite.</br>  <br>Gawain's entire issue was that he wasn't loyal enough to Arturia, which is why he devotes himself completely to the shota.<br><br>Lancelot was always loyal to Saber, but he was completely fucked in the head. I still don't understand what his deal is.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying it's not better to be someone strong enough to strike the king when the king makes mistakes. </br>  <br><br>Wait, so he wanted to fuck Saber? Why didn't he just fuck Mordred then?</br></br>  <br>It was, but, Saber's actions as king are a subset of Merlin's actions. They are both responsible.</br>  <br>He was French. That's all the excuse he needs.</br>  <br>I'm not sympathizing with Kiritsugu's ideals, just his disdain for all things "chivalrous"</br>  <br>Because he loves her for her heart, not her body!</br>  <br>Clank clank clank. I imagine it being like the sex scene in Excalibur except they're both wearing armor now.</br>  <br> Then why fuck the Queen </br>  <br>Okay excellent, so you acknowledge two parties' faults. Shall I explain why Uther and Morgan are at fault too now?</br>  <br>Instead of using the actual instance of Lancelot going mad as the reason for his being summoned as Berserker, Urobuchi, Nasu &amp; Takeuchi came up with a retarded reason just so they could put in a line at the end about Arturia being the best king.</br>  <br>Closest thing to seibaaaa</br>  <br> but he was completely fucked in the head. <br>He isn't the only one or most like other TM characters have some type of mental disorder.</br></br>  <br>But that should be Mordred.<br>What the fuck.</br></br>  <br>Is there a problem with that?</br>  <br>Since we're talking abiut Gawain, I just read Gawain and the Green Knight and although, yeah, Nasu's take on him is sort of spot on, does it bother anyone that he doesn't have any green sadh or something? Or even the scar crom the axe?</br>  <br>This Rider</br>  <br>Why didn't nasuverse characters just hire a psychiatrist?</br>  <br><br>Clearly she gets more Command Seals when she makes a new contract with a new Servant, possibly as a side effect of Rule Breaker completely nulling the previous one.</br></br>  <br>Only in looks anon, only in looks.</br>  <br>no one knew what Mordred looked like because that nigga never took off the huge horned helmet</br>  <br>Psychiatrists wouldn't help them. They'd just prescribe them some kind of elephant tranquilizer and charge them 500$.</br>  <br>Uther is indirect because he didn't make any choices  as far as I can remember in the Nasu-verse.  Morgan is a direct cause, but irrelevant because Saber is still responsible for the kingdom falling. She could have prevented it by killing Morgan. Either way, Saber failed to lead her people as well as Alexander, although I don't remember them saying exactly how Alexander's rule ended. <br><br>Did anyone know that Mordred was an Artoria clone? I know Morgan said to keep it hidden.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense.<br>Lancelot is still an idiot for fucking Guin just because she was the closest thing to Arturia.</br></br>  <br>What about a psychologis</br>  <br> although I don't remember them saying exactly how Alexander's rule ended.  <br>Heavily implied to be what happened in the real world: infighting amongst people loyal to him, but not his ideals or each other.</br></br>  <br>Maybe Lancelot is a masochist and wanted to be punished by Artoria.</br>  <br>Getting professional help isn't cool or heroic.</br>  <br> I still don't understand what his deal is. <br><br>His own guilt drove him mad. It's like when you fuck up as a little kid, then you tell your dad expecting him to yell and scream and rage at you, but then he just gives you a sad look and says he's very disappointed in you. All you can do is feel like shit afterwards.</br></br></br>  <br> Going for inferior copy <br>Mongrel, if you had a choice of going for the superior original or the inferior fake then which would you pick?</br></br>  <br>Actually yeah basically</br>  <br> Nasu's take on him is sort of spot on <br>I say it was closer to the French interpretation. Gawain in Extra is the "Whore of Babylon" trashtalking one over the gentleman "the Maidens' Knight" in Sir Gawain's story with Lady Ragnell.</br></br>  <br>Why not have the superior original then? Nero did come before Arthuria history-wise.</br>  <br>Okay, so Saber is responsible for things out of her control, which Morgan and Merlin were? Yes, she could've killed them, but she had no way of knowing that Morgan would've done that before you know she actually did it, so she can't just randomly go kill her half sister. Once again, they are factors out of her control.<br><br>Same with Merlin, she can't really control him, but he is a direct cause of her downfall, apparently.</br></br></br>  <br> Hello </br>  <br>Well the French variations are a tad bit more popular than the other ones.</br>    <br><br>Oh look, is this the best Saber thread?</br></br>  <br> Sup </br>  <br>I say it's due to Malory's Gawain being more French than English. Stories like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle were English ones yet clearly that Gawain wasn't always the depicted one.</br>  <br>They aren't outside of her control, though. If you can do something about it, then it isn't outside of your control. <br><br>A lot more popular.</br></br></br>  <br>So Saber should be able to read minds? She is not omnipotent, remember? Things can be outside of her control.</br>  <br>They are not outside of their control. She doesn't need to read minds to get people to be loyal to her. This whole argument is kind of pointless when Saber herself says she shouldn't have been king at the end of Fate/Zero.</br>  <br> It was true that Morgan was a ruler with immense power, that she was Uther’s daughter and retained the supernatural power thought to have died out with him. She who was the owner of the British Isle was a greater “King of the Island” than King Arthur. <br><br>You can't just kill the supernatural owner of the country, man.</br></br></br>  <br>Pussy.</br>  <br>Iskander was a physical representation of his people's dreams, wants, greed, the good and the bad. His kingship was truly based on "leading" people, he's more similar to a manager who got promoted. <br><br>On the other side, they had Saber, who tried to lead based on her ideals, based on being a matry, being more similar to a "CEO" than a manager.</br></br></br>  <br> This whole argument is kind of pointless when Saber herself says she shouldn't have been king at the end of Fate/Zero. <br>But on the other hand like the whole point of the Fate route is to get Saber to STOP her self-loathing wanting to revise the past and stop being king thing.</br></br>  <br>Not really. He was all about "him," and who he was. The people should live for him, while Saber thought the other way around.</br>  <br> This whole argument is kind of pointless when Saber herself says she shouldn't have been king at the end of Fate/Zero. <br>Which she realizes is false at the end of Fate?</br></br>  <br>His philosophy was to embody the extremes of his people. He became a larger than life figure.</br>  Stannis is more right than both of them.  <br>Wyman Manderly &gt; Stannis Baratheon</br>  Neither.<br><br>Shirou was right. That's why he won the Fate while Iskander died like a dog.</br></br>  <br>Shirou feels generic as fuck.<br><br>And no, being "Suicidally heroic" isn't not, generic. I honestly believe, there's more heros whos suicidal tendencies to be heroic, were brought up in their stories, more than not.</br></br></br>  The problem is that we know going in that both Saber and Iskander is wrong.<br><br>In Fate, Saber receives her answer from Shirou. She did everything she could and lived a life that she could be proud of. Shirou basically shits on Iskander's views (despite not knowing of them) by convincing Saber that she was a great king and that she didn't have to do anymore. Shirou, as the protagonist, is the one who is correct while Saber, Iskander and Gilgamesh are all "wrong".</br></br>  <br>Pretty much. But that won't stop people from arguing over it. Can we just accept that Saber is the cutest and move on?</br>  <br>No, because Saber a shit.</br>  <br>Wrong, based on Nasu's views. Personally I think Shirou's philosophy is the worst.</br>  <br>"Who dreams of the martyr's thorny path?"<br><br>The Japanese highschool ginger boy,who just beat the guy you couldn't even scratch.</br></br></br>  <br>Saber a love</br>  <br>Who let you in?</br>  <br>Saber is shit.<br>SHIT</br></br>  <br> But, Gilgamesh took Alexander seriously from the very beginning. I don't think anyone would argue that serious Gil could beat basically any servant. </br>  <br>Whatever you say, anon</br>  <br>If dead ends/deaths are canon, dosen't that mean out of the dozens of deaths, that Shirou only survived in about 3 timelines?</br>  <br>I'll smack you in your gabber m8 I swear on me mum</br>  I don't understand, who is this "Saber" person and what does she have to do with my son?  <br>There is only one blonde for anyone with taste.</br>  <br>How can you hate the King so Anon?</br>  <br>Saber is cute</br>  <br>The perfect waifu</br>  <br><br>Yeah, he wouldn't be wrong.</br></br>   In the LN, although Gil respects Iskander's rule, he does say he prefers Saber more because not only is she representative of the human condition, she's kind of like him. Iskander made the people live for him. Gil and Saber lived for their people.   <br> "Great" Britain </br>  <br> Being right doesn't necessarily mean you are correct. <br><br>Fuck off, Shinji.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin fucking up with electronics  <br>best part</br></br>  <br>If you're saying that Britain was never the biggest empire at some point, you're wrong. Of course, I'd argue that the Mongols had the biggest empire, they probably didn't even have maps, they just marched in a general direction and conquered whatever they saw there.</br>  <br>Why did you post a blank picture Anonymous-kun?</br>  <br>Shirou's views are perfectly valid.<br><br>Saber was a great king, or that's what Fate/stay night and Garden of Avalon keep telling us. The moral of Fate is that Saber did her very best. It's just that no matter how hard he tried, it just didn't work out. That's fine. But she has no obligation to throw away her afterlife to try and save her already dead country. She did her best. She should be proud of what she'd accomplished, accept things for what they are, and move on.<br><br> Saber: "B-But I couldn't save my country!" <br> Shirou: "You did your best. Besides, your country was the one that betrayed you anyway." <br> Saber: "B-But, surely someone else could have done a better job!" <br> Shirou: "Changing the past is stupid." <br> Saber: "B-But the King of Conquerors said I was a shit king!" <br> Shirou: "I dunno who that is but he sounds like a dumbass." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would you still love Saber if she had that awful Welsh accent accent?</br>  <br>Kerry pls leave</br>  <br> Arthur's kingdom collapsed because he fucking sucked at resolving internal disputes, while Iskandar's Kingdom collapsed for reasons he couldn't control, his death. <br><br>Okay, buddy.</br></br></br>  <br>That's nero bro</br>  <br>Nasu's views are that Saber is a good king though. Perhaps you are confusing Nasu with Gen?<br><br>The manga, Fate route, and Garden of Avalon all favour Saber's rule.<br><br>Gilgamesh, Archer, Shirou, and Merlin all agree that Saber did the best she could. Merlin even directly tells Saber that her path wasn't wrong when she asked him what else she could do to save the people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still a Saber</br>  <br>Hiei isn't "a Vegeta"</br>  <br>Please use the correct name.<br><br>They refer to themselves as the Caliphate of the British Isles.</br></br></br>  <br>Plus, it was Merlin who orchestrated the whole thing in the first place. By choosing to rule, Saber basically started the AoM</br>  <br> Shinji <br> Not Shirou. <br>You had one job, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Shirou understands Saber the best and just btfo Iskander, who couldn't understand Saber at all.</br>  <br>Iskander couldn't even control his unquestionably loyal army while he was alive.</br>  <br>Merlin and Emiya are fucking dumbasses too, though.</br>  <br>He survives in the ending of Fate, both UBW endings+that one ending where Rin fucks with his memory, MoS (?) HF True + potentially Rin's Geas.</br>  <br> Merlin <br> dumbass <br>uwotm8</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone who doesn't agree with my views is a dumbass <br><br>No wonder you like the King of Conquerors.</br></br></br>  <br>Gen said he doesn't even know what a leader is supposed to be like.</br>  <br>I'll give you Emiya, but Merlin is a fucking wizard man.<br><br>Go read GoA sometime. He sheds light on tons of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>but this is also a Saber</br>  Reminder that it was French FANFICTION that turned Arthur into a cuck  <br>Well to be fair Arthur's existence is still being debated.</br>  <br>pic related the first French fanfic writer</br>  <br>Sorry, but Alexander conquered real civilizations and has over 20 cities named after him.<br><br>Arthur probably didn't even exist, and if he did, his only claim to fame is failing to stop a civil war and having a story written about it. His people were virtually wiped out. The Anglo-Saxons took nothing from the conglomerate of rulers we call Arthur. Alexander is directly responsible for the Roman Empire.<br><br><br> Just because you're right doesn't mean you're correct. <br> not retarded <br><br> Merlin <br> not a massive faggot that got fooled by a random woman into becoming her slave </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that is why you should never let foreigners to write fanfiction about your national heroes.</br>  <br>They didn't. The Welsh weren't much of an entity then, and the English hadn't latched on yet.</br>  <br>Arthur ended the civil war though.</br>  <br> Using shit translations as evidence <br> Using the real people as comparisons to the fictional versions </br></br>  <br>It actually makes sense in the context shirou is using that sentence though.<br><br>Archer is correct that it's an ideal that contradicts itself, but that doesn't make the ideal bad.</br></br></br>  <br>  Alexander <br>  responsible for the Roman Empire <br><br>Literally a retard. On the level of the people that think the Moors are responsible for the Renaissance and bathing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's exactly what the people at ANN said: why didn't Kirei go to the doctor.</br>  <br> &gt;not a massive faggot that got fooled by a random woman into becoming her slave <br>Merlin had the power of prophecy, but was powerless to stop it. He knew, but he also knew that it was inevitable.</br></br>  <br>Do you mean this one?</br>  <br> Comparing Nasuverse to real life <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br>Nero did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>He couldn't have because that's the best Saber. He must have been talking about this failure of a knight.</br>  <br><br>By land Britain had the largest empire, but it was all islands and undeveloped shitholes that could not stand against a modern army and navy. <br><br>Mongolians though are just a bunch of horsefuckers that absolutely destroyed the foremost civilizations of the time and had the largest blob of land under their control that the world will ever see. <br><br>Holy fuck the mongols were so cool, where the goddamn hell is my Rider!Genghis Khan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the one that won the holy grail and had the sword of promised victory</br>  <br> implying alexander didn't pave the way for every empire from the atlantic to the pacific including the ones he didn't own lands in. <br><br> implying based muslims didn't teach europeans the joys of bathing and education <br><br>American Education</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nothing wrong <br>She should have gotten a prettier neckbeard.<br><br> Best Saber <br>B-But that's the one you posted in that picture!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Gawain?</br>  <br>But anon. San Francisco is in America.</br>  CYMRU AM BYTH  Is there any servant Gawain couldn't beat?  <br>With the Britons getting wiped out, yeah. <br><br><br>Arthur is a pretty shitty fictional hero, all things considered.</br></br></br></br>  <br> re-teach </br>  <br>Only pic related</br>  <br>Arthur is just Jesus without God on his side really.</br>  <br><br>Arthur is an appropriate hero for a land that got conquered by the romans, then the saxons, then the danes, then the french, then the dutch and then mostly by each other a ton of times</br></br>  Saber is on the right  <br>So, if Nasu liked Murrika, then seibah would be a girl version of Robert E Lee and seibah would be chanting "the south will rise again" during the grail war?</br>  <br>Arturia was a tool of her title, no matter how powerful she is her existence is tragic and is wrong in trying to dehumanize herself for the sake of her people. A King shouldn't be stranged from its own people. In that sense i believe more in a King like Iskandar, he was selfish, yes, but in a way that inspired his followers into do their best and feel the support of their king. Iskandar charged towards certain demise with a satisfied heart and a smile on his face. Saber is alone and sad in victory and was eventually abandoned and betrayed. <br><br>It depends on what you believe more. A solitary life full of sacrifices or a short yet fulfilling life that you can say it's worth living.<br><br>If you don't enjoy being a king then what's the point in it? I can see Gil at least sympathizes with that portion of Iskandar's view.

Your point?</br>  <br>You only really see the surface of him.

Some people like dicks, others like animals, and you like rhinos.<br><br>It's all okay. Keep fighting the good fight, Rhinobro.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing left to fight, the war's won.</br>  <br>Of course Rhinobro AKA Luvia likes Rin. Wouldn't you if Tohsaka pleased you for money?</br>  <br>As a huge Saberfag, I'm tired of this discussion</br>  <br> The war is won <br>Indeed it has.</br></br>    <br>/pol/ pls leave</br>  <br>Yep, can't be helped, Rin's perfect.</br>  <br>It's just the fujoshits</br>  <br><br>why is her face shaped like a guitar pick?</br></br>  <br> Rhino is perfect <br>Why are you going in circles?</br></br>  <br>Because Rin transcends everything. A rhino, an alien, a gorilla, even a guitar pick. Like a god, you see Rin as you want to see her.</br>  <br><br>I actually feel bad for Rinfags. They were duped into liking this... thing by seasonal waifufags. Now that those waifufags moved on the rinfags are left with nothing, they just go in circles like broken records never being able to explain why they like her, or examine how empty their love is. Kind of like KLK fans</br></br>  <br>I like Rin because she's kind, understanding, and wants to help Shirou. The relationship in UBW is kind of flipped on its head compared to the other routes, where instead of it focusing on Shirou trying his best to help the heroine, the heroine tries her hardest to come to understand him and help him.<br><br>She's about as perfect of an application of a tsundere as I can think of. She never really harms the MC, she just gets frustrated with Shirou when he puts himself in danger, which is understandable and reasonable.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like the same few guys in every Rin thread before it 404s too. <br><br>Delusion is one helluva drug.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked KLK just because of the people working on it, and the art direction.<br>Everything else was subpar.</br></br>  <br>There's nothing delusional about liking the best girl.</br>  <br> There's nothing delusional about liking the best rhino. <br>I agree.</br></br>  <br><br> i like klk just because of the people working on it, everything else was subpar <br><br>just like rin</br></br></br></br>  They all only embodied one part of the "perfect king"<br><br>Saber was about morals and laws that a king makes<br>Rider was about the relationship of a king to his people<br>Gil was the incarnation of a kings authority<br>In that respect they were perfect but they all failed in the two other parts.<br><br>Sabers people hated her for being a dumb inhuman bitch who couldn't lead.<br>Rider's army was just a ragtag bunch of barbarians and they did whatever they wanted, in the end his conquest failed because he lacked power<br>Gilgameshs kingdom was rich and protected but he was a tyrant despised by his subjects<br><br>In the end the discussion was just "well my aspect of kingship is better" when in reality they all lacked essentials. It was literally lol opinions.<br>If you combined them all you'd have a king with perfect laws, loved by his subjects and with unquestionable authority. But then such a character would be a Mary Sue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is the cutest rhino.</br>  <br>Not Lancelot's fault they tried to kill the Queen. Oh, wasn't Gawain the one who challenged Lancelot in the first place and got beat?</br>  <br> Implying Luvia doesn't like Run's feet in her face <br>Do you think Rin only cleans for Luvia?</br></br>  <br>Yes, Rin only want The Shirou.<br><br>And she will win it.</br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot's fault they tried executing the Queen <br> Queen was guilty of adultery <br> Adultery with Lancelot <br><br>If only Guinevere pulled the "Lancelot doesn't exist &amp; is an OC by Chrétien de Troyes" card. They would have passed it off as Guinevere cheating on Arthur with her imaginary friend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> And she will win it. <br><br>Which is kind of meaningless considering there are infinite realities where literally every character gets with shirou. romances in VNs are generic and not special in that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rin only want The Shirou <br>What?</br></br>  <br> infinite realities where literally every character gets with shirou <br> literally every character <br> Ilya, Kotomine, Rider, Caster, Issei <br>The Ilya Route exists!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Which is kind of meaningless considering there are infinite realities where literally every character gets with shirou <br><br>That's not how it works. There are infinite possibilities, but that doesn't mean literally everything anyone has ever thought has happened in the TM canon. Sadly, your fanfiction where you magically got teleported to Fuyuki and fucked all the girls isn't canon.</br></br></br>  <br>Not exactly. I mean the whole story of King Arthur is just fairy tale the first place.</br>  <br>Lurk more, you fucking retard.<br><br>The punishment for adultery was death and this applied to everyone.<br><br>Arthur could not excuse the queen. He wouldn't be King Arthur if he placed himself above the rules. He would just be like any other king, then, if he ran away from the rules whenever it was convenient to him.<br><br>Also all the Queen's guards before her schedule execution were all unarmed especially Gawain's nephews.<br><br>It was kinda expected for Lancelot to rescue the Queen.<br><br>However, no one knew Lancelot would go full retard once he entered the grounds and started slaughtering his fellow knights left and right and IGNORING THE FACT THAT ALL THE GUARDS WERE UNARMED.<br><br>Gawain wouldn't have any beef with Lancelot if NOT FOR THE FACT LANCELOT KILLED GAWAIN'S NEPHEWS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY HAD NO ARMOR AND WEAPONS.<br><br>Lancelot was the braindead moron who chose Hoes before Bros and didn't even notice that he was the guy who was armed and killing defenseless bros.<br><br>Lancelot fucked up the whole thing and spilled the blood of his brothers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Prisma, Rin wants The Shirou, and she will win The Shirou.</br>  <br>Gawain came about before Lancelot did. In the Welsh ones, Gawain was Gwalchmei who was Arthur's best walker &amp; best Rider. (Thus Gawain is Best Rider) Lancelot was a later addition.<br><br>If the Arthurian Legends were written today, Lancelot would be considered to be some fanfiction writer's OC.</br></br></br>  <br>Lancelot was the first knight from the round table to engage in kin slaying. <br><br>Stop making excuses for Lancelot.<br><br>He was never really shown to be smart and rational in the myth.<br><br>In fact, Lancelot was actually a pretty poor deadbeat male.<br><br>With the addition of Galadhad, Lancelot is revealed to be a fucking moocher and pussywhipped as fuck.<br><br>Guinevere was not really a nice women.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's with old stories and the best fighter always being some irrational retard? Reminds me of Lu Bu.</br>  <br>But Luvia already won Rin. Rin belongs to her now.</br>  <br>I'm surprised yurifags aren't all over this pairing<br>Hatesex a best</br></br>  <br>Her being hired by Luvia led to Shirou visiting and raising about a thousand flags. It's like stopping Saber on day 3.</br>  <br> best fighter always being some irrational retard <br>Not always. Sir Gawain, in the English tales, was both the best knight &amp; best bro. He was their best fighter yet most of his appearances were supporting roles. He's also one of the best knights when it comes to dealing with women. The bugger was the Queen's knight &amp; more.</br></br>  Gawain was literatures first gary stu  Reminder, Rin, the side character, is as popular as Kuro.  <br>Shirou works for Luvia too. It's a good thing that Luvia has a big bed. Rin's okay with threesomes as well. Especially if it's with foreign blonds.</br>  <br><br>and she only has 20% the popularity of Ilya</br></br>  <br>I want an Illya plushie.</br>  <br>Rin is not good enough to hunt vampires with Shirou.<br><br>Only Luvia is strong enough for Shirou to trust his back too when hunting vampires.<br><br>Rin is a failure as a mistress and only a proper mistress like Luvia can wield the ultimate butler known as Shirou.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In a show that literally has "Illya" in the title, that's pretty good.</br>    <br>Nah, that'd likely be Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is a weird case because while he has many sue-esque traits, they're not wish fulfillment. His arrogance &amp; screwing every woman in the kingdom was considered childish, he neglected his duties as king &amp; his most important quest for the elixir of immortality he fails. The guy's alike one but very different too.<br><br>Gawain's a flawed hero. In many cases he either struggled or otherwise even failed. His famous Green Knight story actually had him ,more or less, fail the quest yet the Green Knight claimed he couldn't expect anyone else to do better than Gawain did. He doesn't always win &amp; Gawain always finds himself dead in the end. By Mordred's hands or not, he doesn't survive long past Arthur's reign.</br></br></br>  Yall niggers go ahead and waste all of your time talking about Seibah just cause she's cute but Iskandar is the most based motherfucker that has ever existed and deserves far more appreciation  <br>Secondary pls</br>  <br> tons of negative qualities <br> mary sue <br><br>hurr</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rider could sweep the floor with Iskandar so easily it's not even funny.</br>  God tier:<br>Akagami no Shirayukihime <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br><br>Great tier:<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Durarara <br>Gate<br>Ranpo Kitan<br>Ushio no Tora<br><br>Good tier:<br>Charlotte <br>Gatchaman Insight<br>Rockka no Yuusha<br>Shimoneta<br>Wakaba Girl<br>Non Non Biyori<br><br>Meh tier:<br>Classroom Crsis<br>Miss Monochrome<br>Working<br><br>Why even tier:<br>Chaos Dragon <br> <br>Shit tier:<br>Gangsta</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   high tier <br>Gangsta<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br><br> mid tier <br>Gatchaman Insight<br>Charlotte<br><br> garbage tier <br>Gate<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Ranpo Kitan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Great <br>Charlotte<br>Durarara<br><br>Good<br>Shimoneta<br><br>Meh<br>Gate<br><br>Shit<br>Chaos Dragon<br>Gangsta<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127692907 <br>You are making Jojo haters look worse than the fans</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Good tier <br>Charlotte<br>Wakaba Girl<br>NNB Repeat<br><br> decent tier <br>Shimoneta<br><br> meh tier <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Okusama<br><br> Dropped tier <br>Gate<br>Akagami</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   high tier <br>DBS<br>Jitsu wa, watashi<br><br> shit tier <br>GATE</br></br></br></br></br>   God Tier: <br>Nothing so far.<br><br> Great tier: <br>Ushio to Tora<br>Ace of Diamonds<br>Gatchaman <br><br> Good tier: <br>Miss Monochrome <br>Gangsta<br>Charlotte<br>Akagami<br>NonNonBiyori<br>Wakaba Girl<br><br> Okay tier: <br>Okusama ga Seitokaichou!<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>GATE<br>Rokka Yusha<br><br> Not very good tier: <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Shimoneta<br><br> I want to drop this already: <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br>Game of Laplace</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it that so far I'm having the most fun with shoujo/otomoe shows this season than with shows aimed at otaku?<br>Wakaba Girl was also good I guess.</br></br>   High <br>Ushio to Tora<br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br><br> Mid <br>Charlotte<br>Gatchaman Crowds<br><br> Low <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Ranpo Kitan<br>Classroom Crisis<br><br> Lower than low <br>Chaos Dragon<br>Gangsta<br>Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aquarion subs fucking where/10  <br><br><br><br> All this Gangsta hate <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I put Gangsta in high tier dumbass.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127693535 <br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>muh sword versus guns you don't bring a knife to a gunfight</br>  <br>I don't know why you quoted me, I din't even watch Gangsta</br>   Good <br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime<br>Ushio to Tora<br>Charlotte<br>Gangsta<br>Ranpo Kitan <br>Working!!!<br><br> Alright <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br>Wakako-zake<br>Durarara<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br><br> Not good <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Gate<br>Shimoneta<br><br> Dropped already <br>Chaos Dragon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Black Lagoon for girls/10.</br>  <br>Akagami is hardly just a "shoujo".

Nice b8 m8.</br>   there are people who dislike Shimoneta <br><br>it's probably the best show this season, unironically.</br></br>  <br> I need to watch the first episode of SOL set in a high school #10000 to determine whether or not it's good </br>  <br>Actually, no. I watch at least 30 shows each season which means that I actually eat shit. Well, I dropped Shimoneta after the first episode. If someone with shit taste doesn't want to watch shimoneta then what does that tell you? It tells you that it's even worse than shit.</br>  <br>As much i hate the right wing political stuff in Gate and many things that make me rage - there are just too many awesome moments to not watch this show. So yeah - its shit and its genuinely great. The flight of valkyrie chopter scene or meidos alone make it worth it.</br>  <br>I´m probably here before you were born.</br>  Everything looks and sounds like shit. When is the last time a great anime aired?  <br>it tells me that people have different taste in anime?</br>  <br>I doubt it since you are still writing like a toddler.</br>  God Tier<br>Ushio To Tora <br>Rokka no Yuusha<br><br>Good Tier<br>Non Non Byori<br><br>Average<br>Gate<br>Durarara<br>Working<br>Charlotte<br><br>Bad<br>Gangsta<br>Classroom Crisis <br>Chaos Dragon <br><br>DBZ is somewhere inbetween average and bad.

Very valid opinions you have friend.</br>  <br>Yes, I may have shit taste while others have actual good taste. People who like shimoneta, on the other hand, are literally worse than hitler.</br>  <br>Gangsta's first episode was one of the weakest of the season. None of the characters have any chemistry, it's all gritty for the sake of being gritty. If you really think it's marketed at guys you have issues.

It had the best animation of any first episode this season. Hopefully Bones will keep it up.   Rokka no Yuusha <br>Generic and boring<br> Wakaba*Girl <br>Kinda cute and entertaining. Could go either way later on.<br> Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace <br>Really interesting premise for a mystery anime<br> Charlotte <br>Funny, heartwarming and unique. Has some potential<br> Gangsta. <br>Cool setting with really fitting music and nice style. Pretty good so far<br> Okusama ga Seitokaichou! <br>Boobs. Not sure what else to say about it but I'm not expecting much<br> Gate <br>Cool main character and original story.

Thumbs way up on this one. Blue Snow is the hero that we need.<br> Ranpo Kitan - Game of Laplace <br>First episode was underwhelming. Withholding judgement because the trap is cute.<br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Reverse traps are fine too, but I don’t expect much of this airsoft anime that so obviously panders to fujos.<br> Working! 3 <br>Same old, same old. No better, no worse.<br> Charlotte <br>Alpha male gets cucked. Pretty weak characterization here. The imouto carried the episode, even though she only appeared for about 90 seconds total.<br> Rokka no Yuusha <br>Seems fine by fantasy anime standards. Let's see how it pans out.<br> Joukamachi no Dandelion <br>Cute and shy Akane steals the show. Otherwise a boring show.<br> Wakaba Girl <br>Cute and entertaining high school girls doing cute and entertaining high school girl things.<br> Classroom Crisis <br>Retarded premise. Reminds me of Planetes, in a bad way.<br> Gate <br>Too much flash, too little (no, scratch that) - ZERO - substance. Will withhold judgement until the lolis appear, but I could easily drop this wish fulfillment garbage.<br> Okusama ga Seitokaichou! <br>Cute show about promiscuous boy meets promiscuous girl. Will probably start being redundant quickly, but at least it's not a striptease.<br> Ushio to Tora <br>A "frienemies" type shounen with a full on furry character. May be my guilty pleasure of the season, though.<br> Gangsta <br>Better than I thought it would be, given the nignog title. Will probably continue watching.<br> Chaos Dragon <br>“Violence is ikenai!” Fuck this stupid kid shit. Tentatively watching next episode, but planning to drop.<br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br>Stupid haremshit. I don’t know why /a/ likes this so damn much. <br> Non Non Biyori Repeat <br>So it’s a restart, and not a prequel?

That shit was all flash and sleight of hand.</br></br></br>  <br>no, because you're stating to watch a show with the mindset that it's going to be shit. That's pretty retarded</br>  <br> Great animation <br> Favaro was a fresh mc <br> that fight scene straight out of pirates of the caribbean <br>It was pretty fun</br></br></br></br>  So Ushio to Tora is the show this season that most people accept as good  <br>Nothing you've posted is drastically different from my own opinions, which leaves we wondering how you came off as this jaded and salty.<br><br>As for Jitsu wa the answer is always going to be the same.

To be clear, I haven't dropped anything yet. There are a few shows I probably won't continue after the second episode, but nothing decided as of yet. As for me sounding negative, I'm just trying to be honest about everything I think. There's no such thing as a perfect anime and people in these threads don't want to hear about them at the least.</br></br>  <br>We don't even have real subs for this yet.</br>  <br> average animation <br>We will never be friends</br></br>  What is the worst show so far /a/?<br><br>More importantly, is it likely to stay the worst once we've seen everything?<br><br>Putting in my vote for  laplace  and  yes .</br></br></br></br>  Shimoneta is garbage  This is some sort of joke right? We are only one episode into the season. ONE EPISODE<br><br><br>ONE</br></br></br>  <br>As opposed to manga advertisements? What's the difference?</br>  <br>Yeah, they pull the same joke every week</br>  <br>We always have these threads.<br><br>How fucking new are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Chaos Dragon, Ushio to Tora, and Gate were my three worst. In that order. I am .</br>  <br> Anime board speculating about the quality of anime <br> This is some sort of joke right? </br></br>  <br>Akagami Shirayuki-hime pretty much has the best animation for its first episode than all the other airing shows. Hopefully Bones continues with this.<br><br>I'm not counting Prison School because looking at the PV it looks like shit.</br></br></br>  <br> political <br> right wing <br> Gate <br>You what? It's constantly shitting on the (not)romans, the chinks and the USA. They're all about getting along, all the time. Hell, the only time anything even remotely political is shown is them telling utilitarianism to go fuck itself, the people come first as they punch the prince's face in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Been checking threads like these to see how the show is doing and UtT has more positive reception than negative although it bothers me how some people call it Ushio no Tora.<br><br>A ton of people will probably drop it later on when they realize it's very much MotW or, more possibly, that Mappa fucks up the animation.<br><br>I could see some people picking it up in the second cour though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a new summer meme of neo /a/</br>  Which show this season will have the worst threads?  <br>Gate threads were pretty shitty so far</br>  <br><br><br>Nothing they're both shit and the cancer killing anime</br></br></br>  <br>at least they're not web novels or whatever them japs call their shitty blogs<br><br>could be worse</br></br></br>  <br>I'd switch Ushio to Tora and NNB.

Because it's Eric? Simply Eric?</br></br>  <br>Gate turned out pretty shitty. Establishing a fucking harem weeks into an excursion? They're the fucking military. Should've had more magic and goddamn technology, and saved the harem hjinks for when they're stuck there. I mean some girls are fine here and there, but everyone's wading through bitches. You'd sooner guess they were pimps than soldiers if not for the uniforms.<br><br>And changing sorc's hair to blue and blobbing up her face is fucking unforgivable.</br></br></br>  <br>Every general is equally awful.</br>  <br>He's fine..

That's why there's so much effort put into their room designs and the actual aesthetic of the house. If you didn't like them and were looking for an actual plot I can see where you might not like it. I still think it's a solid 6 though. If you are interested I'd recommend finishing it, episodes 10 and 11 are highlights of the series in my opinion.</br>  <br> &gt;ZnT <br>6.5/10<br> &gt;Bahamut <br>8/10<br> &gt;Punchline <br>6/10<br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know anymore, it's all so shit.<br><br><br>I don't have any 10/9's really, some of the higher rated are:<br>BECK<br>Bakemonogatari<br>Death Note<br>Ouran Koukou<br>GitS 2nd season<br>Nodame<br>Toradora</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are cock sucker faggot</br>  <br>It already has a solid decades old manga.

A bunch of them start too slow to pass any sort of judgement at episode 1, though.<br>Still quite a few shows I'm excited to watch upcoming/in my torrent queue, so if even 3/4 of it holds up it looks like it'll be a good season.</br>  <br>Move Classroom Crisis up (I think it will get better) and I agree with you. <br><br>I actually haven't watched Akagami yet, what makes it appealing?</br></br></br>   charlotte <br> first scene is "tokyo ped xing crowd" shit <br>not off to a good start</br></br>   'Good' <br>Classroom Crisis<br>Rokka no Yuusha<br> Okay <br>Shimoneta<br>Gate<br> Bad <br>Chaos Dragon<br>Charlotte<br><br>Haven't watched too much yet since this season is so trash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice animation, clever writing, strong characters, and potential for meatbun-caliber shipping between Shirayuki and Zen.</br>  <br>I'll check it out.</br>  <br>Mappa's only held responsible for animation and production value, which ZnT does fantastically. Also the OST is brilliant. And some of the characters are alright or even good. It's not totally horrible. Just bad, and disappointing compared to how good it could have been had they gotten better writers.</br>  <br>Wow everything you've picked up is shit</br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much.

My main issue with the (decent) manga is that it's a little too slow and just becomes boring after a while.<br><br><br>If you looked at everything except the writing, ZnT would probably be the best show last year (except maybe Ping Pong).</br></br></br>  <br>From what I've heard, it's going to be a two-cour show. I'm guessing it's going to be fairly faithful but Bones might speed things up. <br> http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-06/snow-white-with-the-r<wbr>ed-hair-anime-to-have-2-split-seaso<wbr>ns/.90118</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br>Huh?

I'm gonna give it a few more episodes, but this first one was a hunk of shit. The premise is interesting, but writing and direction are garbage so far. If the dialog stays this clunky, and the characters this flat and boring, I'll definitely be dropping it. It could get good, but this first episode is like 3/10. Honestly, first episode of SAO was probably better, but fuck if I remember.<br><br>Any y'all niggas saying GATE is good have shit taste, come at me.</br></br>  <br> liking second season of gits more <br>this guy</br></br>  <br>So far everyone's been putting it in shit tier, so I don't know what you're smoking.</br>  <br> E 2&amp;3 <br> great, watching people get BTFO, anticipation of even more <br> the rest <br> blue balled, generic harem romcom mess </br></br></br></br>  Good:<br>NNB<br>Ushio x Tora<br>Working<br><br>Okay:<br>Laplace<br>Shinometa<br>Rokka Yuusha<br><br>Meh:<br>Gatchaman<br>Gangsta<br>Charlotte<br>Jitsu watashi wa<br>Classroom crisis<br><br>So fucking bad:<br>Gate<br>Chaos Dragon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. Gate's mainly good if for the BTFO moments. <br><br>Besides that it's pretty meh.</br></br></br>  Why do people like Charlotte? From the synopsis I'm assuming that it's the usual P.A. Works teenage romance. Am I wrong, though?  <br>it's like half and half, middling. some people said it was great. like what the fuck?<br><br>i'll bet the percentage of people with shit taste is much higher among actual posters on /a/ than it is among lurkers.</br></br></br>  <br>Has potential to be fun.</br>  <br>Wait, looks like I didn't read it properly. Welp.</br>  <br>People are so sick of Beta MCs that they desperately cling on something different even if the actual show is shit</br>  <br> self-insert cardboard cutout otaku are what you consider having a "shred of personality" <br>Nice</br></br>  <br>From the first episode it seems that way. I'm not really up to speed on the season yet, but as far as first episodes go this one seems good. The main character is really interesting because he's a fucking asshole who gets BTFO immediately. I already suspect they'll completely abandon that characterization however. If they hold onto it and keep him interesting I'm along for the ride. The setup seems interesting as well. I'm sure there will be standard romance subplot, but the show has a bunch of other stuff going for it so far.</br>  <br>i'm not that guy but wtf are you even saying</br>  <br>Went and took the time to go add the shit that hasn't aired yet.</br>  <br>Can you honestly blame them, though? I am so sick to death of the same generic shlock over and over again.</br>  <br><br><br>But the Key guy writes the scenario, right?</br></br></br>  <br>i don't think "/pol/ the animu" would have passed censors</br>  <br>yes? <br>I'll compare Pretty Woman to Gangsta, the movie which is a whore's dream. <br>Pretty Woman: Ordinary whore gets saved and whisked off her feet and romanced by billionaire playboy into eventual marriage and never has to work again. <br>Gangsta: Drugged-up, two-cent zombie whore Alex saved from abusive pimp by eye-patch gigolo and deaf samurai. Was only saved because they were tired of seeing and hearing her get fucked in the alley next to their office. <br>Later offered a job, but still has to pull her own weight and actually do something for shit-pay. Said gigolo gropes her a lot and only gets away with it because prior pimp raped and beat her. Samurai still doesn't give a shit about her. <br><br>Alex sure is living the fujoshit dream!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Working! <br>Animu about being a poorfag. DROPED.</br></br>  <br><br>You faggots actually think fujoshi means "female anime watcher", don't you?</br></br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>From how it's been used fujoshi = ugly NEET gook that's the azn version of a tumblr dyke. Also loves to draw (badly) gay porn. <br>Am I close?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much. They're all batshit insane.</br>  <br>Worse, it's Key shit. Expect awful comedy and forced drama</br>  <br>If it isn't cute girls doing nothing for 30 minutes every week, /a/ hates it.</br>  <br> loves drawn gay porn <br>That's pretty much the only requisite. That and a vagina. So I hope you can see how calling some hetero rape fantasy "fujoshit" might be a bit off the mark. I know you're a newfag still learning all the new memes to shitpost with but get your shit right at least.</br></br>  <br> God tier: <br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa  <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br> awful comedy and forced drama <br>You mean Plastic Memories?
