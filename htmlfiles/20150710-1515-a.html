Apparently this Sunday, July 12, there will be a special radio Anison feature where they will show all 193 Horizon radio episodes while the anime was airing. The article also mentions that it has been "3 years since season 2" and says something about a possible season 3?

Everything else is fine and doesn't bother me</br>  My god, I was reading this interview with Toriyama and this fucking man's thought process<br><br> Incidentally, what led you to have Goku become a Super Saiyan, or the villains to level up? <br>I was feeling that there were limits on mere strength, so I was generally always struggling to come up with something. I actually hadn’t planned Goku’s Super Saiyan transformation at all. Then, when I came up with the idea of the Super Saiyan, in order to show that Goku had gained a massive power-up all at once, I thought “there’s no choice but to change his form, too”. But in terms of design, the facial expressions and such would become like the design for a villain. I felt, “I wonder if it’s really OK for him to be like this.” Granted, since his transformation is accompanied by rage, I also thought, “I suppose that part’s fine.” It was a pretty radical concept. With respect to the villains, my editor would say, for instance, “I don’t like this”, and in those circumstances, I’d change it. (laughs) Before long, “they should transform” became the norm, so that was a pain.<br><br> Did you consider any other ways for Goku to level up other than going Super Saiyan? <br>At the time, I didn’t really have the time to come up with multiple ideas, so that wasn’t going to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The concept of fusion is also a form of leveling up. How did that concept come to be? <br>If I remember correctly, I was talking about how, as a concept, “there’s nothing stronger than a Super Saiyan”, and Katsura-kun (Masakazu Katsura-sensei), who I usually just joke around and say idiotic things with, said, “There’s no choice but for them to fuse, then.” So I said, “Whoa, sometimes even you say something good. It’s the first time you’ve ever made yourself useful.” (laughs) That’s how that plot point was born.<br><br> What about the concept of the Potara? <br>That was simply, since Fusion was a plot point that was already taken by one of the movies, I was wondering what I should do; I had always been drawing earrings [on Kaiōshin], so I thought, “perhaps I can use these”…<br><br> Had you drawn them from the beginning, thinking that you’d use them as a fusion item? <br>No, not at all. They were just for decoration.<br>So they were just a fortuitous coincidence, then.<br>I’m always crossing perilous bridges like that. (laughs) But, just as I’ve been driven into a corner, it’s like my brain waves go taut, and some sort of idea bubbles up. Also, I’m good at forcing things to stretch. (laughs)<br><br> That’s amazing. <br>No, it really isn’t. Even I’m always in suspense. In the previous chapter, I’ve already written “something incredible is going to happen”, so I think, “I have no choice but to do something incredible.” It’s so painful.

Extend the powers of the dragon and the reach of the wish? Make more than 5 wishes? I personally think thats an aspect that shouldnt have been touched.
