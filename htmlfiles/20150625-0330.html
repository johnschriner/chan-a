[ Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Because she was characterized damn well.    I know this is you, anniebot. Don't lie.   Thats not Sasha  is anniebot a  girl    I only liked her when she laughed at Armin.  I want to say Mikasa is the best but she is actually really boring.     How would either wall breach had gone if the full SL had been there? Slightly less casualties maybe?       It isn't Annie, it is Jean, who was by the way confirmed the winner of the Mikasab owl in the Live action movie (just saw the thread in the archive; funny how deluded autists thought it was supposed to represent Levi somehow).  I am celebrating victory over here, whilst EM/YH autistcucks are getting cucked the fuck out.  Allah akbar. *shoots his AK47 in the air*        kill yourself    *teleports behind you* *unzips katana* *slashes your AK47 in half* *teleports away with a cheeky grin*  Nothin personnel kid          Ymirfag owns a katana  Literally nobody is surprised.     I only read the AK47 part of your post Not gonna bother with shipping shit m8     Based Jean.   Is EH the hero we need?   EH is freedom from the tyranny of YH and EM.    are you high?   It's now official that Hanji is a tranny, Isayama just said it on his blog   dubs    nice one     the neckbeard has to post the same 5 pictures he has over and over again because Japan will never make any new ones for his delusions     We knew that already. What retard still thinks he's female at this point?    Because we haven't seen anything of her in so fucking long you forget about her and then remember her and you think she's the best, but really she was okay.    Annie a shit.    you sound underage    And has not been changed for years thanks to crystalization.  The rest of her corps' characterizations are now very messy.     so whats going on now, i stopped reading when that bitch got crystalized and they were trying to get to the basement, did they ever make it?  why are the walls titans? whos the gorilla man? why isnt everyone dead when they were all dying left and right  lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder        you'll never marry Annie    Hange is best, everybody else is a shit.   http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8867221.html  So Hanji is both male and female?  </wbr>  http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mt3WMO<wbr>fh2Wo</wbr>  [ ]  Dat kiss.     The fuck you say...    Annie worst girl    Sauce:  @hituzi2gou     Why do people care about the kiss?  best shingeki isnt a character but a concept. it's the concept of dropping shingeki and finding some self respect   It's inexpected I guess. And also it's probably because it's Mikasa.    Because Mikasa is only good for shipping fodder for self-inserting twats     Who is best kyojin and why is it Annie?     Blorphole Poover Poobar    It's okay, I got him covered.    Annie is love Annie is life Annie is the sun that warms my heart Annie a miracle of the universe Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out           think they will finale be going there next chapter or atleast to Shiganshina District      First king had them build the walls with hardening abilities.      monkey trouble he is a shifter and the one leading the others. He is waiting at Shiganshina District for them.     reanimation jutsu             I haven't been that legitimately sad in a long time.    Annie a shit.  Can't even run away properly and just gives up on life.      Butthole a love.    Blorp oozes from the Butthole.    Serves him right for the semen demon he is.   Eren x Annie OTP    lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder  SnK in a nutshell, I wonder how Flegel and the reporters are still alive.     I think the series actually does a decent job making you care about the cannon fodder characters.      Who, Marco? Petra? The rest of Levi's squad? Nifa? Mike? Not really.    Same guy, I wanted to add that I only know their names because I lurk here, otherwise I might only remember Marco and that's because Jean couldn't shut up about it in the anime. In the manga he was just a random dead guy.    It makes me sad that titans are primarily supposed to be war machines and this'll never happen.    The character grew on me when I read them in manga compared to the anime.    Maybe if you watched the anime first. For someone that reads/watches it for the first time most of these characters are just random redshirts.   I wonder what will the ending be. Most likely the entire wall will be destroyed but then what?  Was pretty cool.   Hey man.  You intentionally left your trip on.     Lelouch is intentionally a faggot, news at 11.   Does anyone have the most recent chart? I was withouth internets for 2 weeks, I missed the release hype  Who is Monkey Trouble, am I supposed to be able to tell who he is? It's just a long haired glasses dude     That guy who led the squade when taking back Trost and had Mikasa and Eren's back.  Those two guys who died last at Utgard.  That black haired chick who died because Eren's an idiot.       That guy   Those two guys   That black haired chick  So you agree with me.       Hey, I never said anything about knowing their names.    I thought Levi squad will live because they are like elite of elites.    Annie is eliter.    There no memorable I just remember all their names   Damage control        Damage control  Do you even know what that means? I only added more to my rant, I didn't take anything back.     To jump off your "Marco is just a random dead guy" comment, he's really not. His portrait is featured at the start of every volum of the manga, whereas other dead characters have their's removed.   I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow. Hopefully we'll find out when Annie gets uncrystalised.      Mmkay you don't remember every last one of them or anything I didn't even remember some of those names damn anon they really had an impact on you.     More like I lurk these threads a lot.        Historia a bestest.        You love them don't you I bet you cried when each one was killed off     N-No I didn't ;_;    Why I can't but agree with this.   Not that guy but I loved Petra, thinking she is qt and may be spared but not a single tears was shed when she died       It's one of the reasons why his characterfags think he'll come back.      I might be the only one who didn't give a shit about any of the fodder. Especially Levi Squad, they were too obvious.    Me neither. Although I wish Nanaba didn't die so soon.    Do not sexualize the queen.    No way he's coming back, but there has to be more to it than him just being a normal guy who died somehow.     I hope Levi died.   I remember Ian leaving an impression on me, he was an upstanding man and I'm sad he died.    Marco is Ymir's time travelling son from the future.  Marco will come back as a titan, Isayama said it.  Marco was just pretending to be dead, didn't you see that his left leg was moving?          I mean I didn't cry but I was like, aww, damn :/.     Ymir   Ever getting pregnant   I see through your lies.       :/  Get out.     She's the father.   So I heard Hanji was confirmed a beautiful transwomyn?   Fyi Ymir was just pretending to be a lesbian. Her true love, Bert, impregnated her and she's currently in labor. Baby Marco will be born soon and we can finally have our canon Jeanmarco.     :/  Scawwy angry face anon     Sounded more like she's a herm    It was just Isayama just fucking with us about the incognite thing.  &gt;2015   &gt;Still doesn't get Isayama's jokes       Marco is totally a BY spawn how did I not notice.      He sounded pretty serious.    Well are you up to date?    Bert actually has standards, he would impregnate Annie not some tranny-looking thing      So does Annie. He might have a chance with Pigner.    Do you think she will just be queen of orphans or will she get to try her hand at other things too?    If Annie had standard she would love Bert, not that self hating, crybaby titan with a huge role that he can't handle that is Er- wait, fuck.    I didn't say the Rageturd is any better.    That's who Annie likes though, and he's the same as Bert.  I like both anyway, she should too.     Not really.    Annie likes Armin       All this delusion.     Eren and Bert are completely different.  Bert is a pawn who's just going along with what's expected of him.  Eren is going against the world, and trying to change things. Annie respects that. I can't imagine she respects Bert.      You're a delusional retard    They are equally terrible characters though.    Ymir would rape his pathetic ass before he even touches her.    Look who is talking.    Eren is the scouting legion's pawn, which is quite obvious. He always does what he's ordered to. At first he wanted to go against the world but that's not really what happens, he's just a pet.     thinks Annie likes Armin   calls others delusional  /snk/ never ceases to amaze.      Only Reiner would want to touch Bert's second weak spot.    That's a trait that many characters have expressed respect and admiration for, it probably means nothing in terms of romanticism. Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point, maybe others that I can't recall right at this moment.    Historia admired Eren as well because he knew what he wanted to do. Even if he's their tool he still keeps a sense of self even though right now he's depressed over eating Grisha.    It also means that Annie has zero respect for Bert who is the complete opposite of Eren. If there's lack of respect there's also little room for romantic feelings to develop.     Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point  You mean Annie and Bert? Because Annie and Bert have pretty much the same worldview from what they said. About humans that go with the flow and being normal I mean.     Bert also knows well what he wants and has to do. Out of BRA he's the only one that never wavered from their goal even if he just wants to return home.    Bert's just a coward.     depressed  He showed symptoms of PTSD in the latest chapter.     Eren is just a whiny ragetard.    I'm thinking of the conversation between Eren and Historia during the chapter where they were in the cabin. Did she not say something about how she admires that about Eren? I could be remembering it wrong, it's been a while since I read the chapter    Maybe you should read the manga for a change.    It's much more emphasized in Annie's case, though, and she's very selective about who she associates with. I don't have anything against BA, but I don't see it realistically happening.    I thought it was more like envy.    From memory she was saying that she's jealous of the fact that he seems to know exactly what he's doing with his life.    And Bert is a whiny fag.    Sorry my bad, you're right. I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow as Annie or Historia describe him. From humanity's viewpoint, Eren does that and Bert is a pawn, but from the titan's viewpoint it's the other way around. If you look at it from a third person's viewpoint, both of them are pawns for their cause.      You both are getting to my words. I like both characters but in the end they're not much different from each other. Bert has acted like a ragetard at some points and Eren has acted like a crybaby. Both claim they have no will but both do everything to help their cause.     I think it's because Eren always calls other people out on not fighting back. At least early on he was always giving speeches about how humanity needed to stand against the titans.   Also, he did put in a hell of a lot of effort to become a soldier. That's respectable in its own right.      Eren put a lot of effort to become a soldier but BRA put much more effort to become warriors. Sure they're not the same, but Eren's will to go against the flow was there only in the beginning. After Levi and Erwin took him under their control he just helps the scouting legion with everything, it just happens that he agrees with their cause.  I expect Bert and Reiner to go against MT for whatever reason, since it's starting to look like MT is doing it for selfish reasons and BR disagree, but that's just speculation on my part.      Bert will go awol to save Annie. Reiner will directly go against MT and die for it.    Bert loves Annie but he wouldn't leave Reiner to die. Reiner always gets into trouble but that doesn't mean that Bert agrees with it, that's why he's always running after him.    Either way he managed to get two girls to envy or admire him because Eren comes across as a strong-willed person. Bert doesn't really have anything admirable about him.    So Reiner and Eren are equally dumb. Although Eren's behavior was even more retarded and got his team mates killed.    Bert is more strong willed that Reiner or Annie though, he only thinks he's not.    The SL's goals coincide with Eren's and it was a dream of his to join them. Why would he deter from that anyway? He still has a strong spirit to him and if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it.    Annie hides in a crystal and Reiner created a second personality, it's not like they're much competition.     He still has a strong spirit to him  Not as much, at least during the last arc that changed.  if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it  Really? He disagreed with the SL's intentions about Annie but he still helped them catch her.       Is this some sort of pretending to be retarded? Reiner wouldn't have developed a second personality if he had Bert's will and Annie wouldn't have hidden if she had his will. Although I think Annie did it to protect the information, not just her life. Point still stands about Reiner.    He also knows Annie is responsible for the deaths of many soldiers and is considered an enemy to them first and foremost.    Sure, but he still disagreed and he still did it. He doesn't do what he wants he does what the SL wants.    My point is that out of a guy with a split personality and a girl who hid in a rock, of course Bort is going to look like he's strong willed. But compared to others aside from his tagalongs he's a pussy.    Because for the most part he agrees with them. Do you think he would be okay with it if for some reason the SL told him to kill Mikasa and Armin?    He looks strong willed because Reiner and Annie are cowards too.    Annie was willing to risk being eaten by Titans. That's something.   What was he meant to do, let a Titan rampage through Stohess?        Sure I guess, he's far from strong willed in general. The problem is that people describe him as weak willed even compared to RA, hell some say he's more weak willed than the whole cast when that's not true at all. He just hates himself and thinks he's more worthless and cowardly than he really is.     Bert is just a weakling who shows signs of strength sometimes. Other characters are strong that at times show signs of weakness, as most humans do anyway.    Pretty much. He's just the least cowardly of a trio of cowards      Depends. Most humans are either weak that shows signs of strength or strong that show signs of weakness. He's not more strong willed than many characters in the cast, but he's not the most weak willed of the cast, unlike what the consensus thinks.    He is weak-willed in comparison to many others though.    That's what I'm saying too, in case you can't read.   Fuck off hetshipping scum. Only YH is canon and maybe EM.   He's not the most weak willed but he's definitely in that area.    Yes anon, in case you didn't notice we agree on that for quite a while.    I know that, I'm reiterating because some think otherwise.   How do Mikasafags feel about this?  Is it true that Mikasa's actress filmed a naughty scene with Shikishima's actor?   Jesus Christ, I wonder if Isayama will comment on this if the fanbase gets too loud.    No.    I like how that artist had to change Mikasa's expression and also turn the OC into Levi.    I'm looking forward to the massive amounts of LM fanart that this will bring about.   tfw Levi with a mustache      LM isn't as popular as people like to believe. Plus it's just a live action offshoot so who cares?    Yeah but we know nothing about him anyway. MT is anon-kun.   Am I the only one who doesn't care about Levi or Mikasa?   I guess anything's better than EM.     I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow.  Isayama killed him earlier than planned because he "didn't stand out"     You're never the only one, now stop shitposting.    Mikasa is qt but manlet a shit.    No, Kenny was the only interesting Ackermann. He had more personality than LM combined.    Marco was just a random good guy, like pretty much every redshirt in the series that dies two chapters after getting introduced.    Get out, neckbeard.  Kenny was just an autistic manchild.      I fucking miss when all we has were these ass threads and sometimes discussion.    The face of a cuck    We can still make the ass discussions happen. I'll take anything over more shipping cancer.    Annie has the best ass     neckbeard  Women with taste don't like the manlet. They go for better options like Erwin or Reiner.     You mean sleepy time threads?    Annie never to to see that.  Anyway Eren's still bent on his dream, he just recognizes the SL has the same dream as him. That's why he wanted to join in the first place so of course he'd do what they told him to. Eren has radical ideals for humanity that trump his regard for his own life and he's working towards achieving that, that's what Annie respected, and what Bert lacked.      That too, and Bert has a more gentle attitude and looks in general, and it may make him look even more weak willed than he is.   In the end I agree with the anons that say both Bert and Eren are pawns and just follow around orders. Which makes sense since they're soldiers and that's what soldiers do.      The difference is Bert's still going "with the flow" it's just that the flow is to do their mission. Like you said he's doing this because he wants to go home, it's not on the altar of a higher purpose unlike Marlo and Eren's goals.     I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow  Eren's living in a society of cattle. Everyone is encouraged to live with their heads down inside the walls, but he always wanted to go out.     Depends on how you see it, Eren wants to see the outside world, Bert wants to go home, they both do what's necessary for it. Along with their dream they also help humanity on Eren's case, and MT or the village on BRA's case.   Eren and Bert combined would make the perfect Shinji.   Nah I meant the threads way before and no one had any idea that Isayama would waste most of his girls into irrelevancy.    Well sleepy time had nice discussions too.    Erwin is a pleb and Reiner, again, looks like a deformed dyke. Tell me, what is so distasteful about the manlet? He has a better personality than the both of them.      Nice bait.    Manlet doesn't even have a personality.    Shinji a shit tho. Kaworu a best.    I wasn't implying that he isn't.    He's loyal, introverted feeler and consistent. What's not about him to like?     I have come to appreciate the manlet. He's better than characters like Eren and Bert. Erwin is good too.    So it makes sense that worst shingekis Bert and Eren combined make Shinji.    He's just a retarded lapdog who can't make any decision on his own and just repeats the same dumb speech again and again.    He's also mentally retarded, ugly, a manlet, can't think for himself and has an awful, bland personality. He can cook and clean sure but anyone with working arms and legs could do that if they tried.    I find manlet far worse than Bert or Eren    That's your opinion, but I disagree with it.    Because he is, manletfags are just desperate to make him rise up a little in popularity on /a/.    she is the queen of my heart    You and the rest of the retarded 13 year old fujoshits that populate 90% of the fanbase.    He is far worse. Bert and Eren at least have some conflict in their personalities despite being pawns, while manlet is just a lapdog that mindlessly follows orders no matter how bad they are. Bert and Eren think for themselves.    They already shit up the threads as is and hate on everyone who isn't the manlet because they think people only dislike him due to popularity.    I think out of all the characters who are consistently shat on here, which is pretty much everyone as is, Levi is the only one who deserves it. Especially since a good chunk of the plebs with bad taste will defend him no matter what anyway.    I'm neither a fujoshi nor am I a teenager. To be fair I don't even care about shipping. I'm not sure why you get so butthurt over a differing opinion.    I dislike his fanbase too but that doesn't mean the character is good. If Levi was a good character no one would mind his popularity.    Where do you think we are    No one is butthurt, just saying your opinion isn't unpopular.    I know I'm on 4chan but your level of butthurt over someone liking Levi is just childish. Did I shit on your favorite character or something?    Yeah he's pretty bad and this arc proved he's dumb as shit too    No it doesn't, really. The difference is ideological, that's the part Annie admires.  It's just that they have a dream or how far they're willing to go for it, though she does admire the way the "special" people stick to their guns, but the basis is quality of those dreams themselves.  In her conversation with Marlo she says he's special because goes against the society's mentality simply because of what he believes to be right even though the system itself is built on corruption, same as Eren who believes that people should go out simply because it's their world and it's their right even though everyone thinks it better not to mess with the walls and the SL are regarded as freaks.   Bertolt has probably the strongest determination out of BRA despite being underestimated, but in the end he admits himself that he doesn't have anything he values more than his own life. On a personal note I think he's not quite correct on this, I would bet he is capable of sacrificing himself for Annie or Reiner, but they're not dreams or ideals. He doesn't want to die for that, even on the off chance he was fed some bullshit about higher goals for their mission, what moves Bert are very personal things: his desire for home, and his care for RA.          Go back to Dumblr now    No one got butthurt though, your damage control proves you're the only butthurt here.     both Bert and Eren are pawns and just follow around orders  Difference is Eren believes in those orders while Bert just wants to get it over with.     I simply said I liked Levi and I got anons replying to me for no reason.    Ymir will get inside that with her BBC while you're gonna watch like an impotent cook.    How does that make someone butthurt?     implying watching your waifu getting fucked by another man with a big dick isn't hot     Clearly I'm not the one who's angry over someone liking a character I don't.    So in the end Annie admires Eren's ideals because he is selfless? Bert isn't as selfless, he puts RA above him but he seems like he doesn't care about the rest, like humanity and such. Not that he likes killing people, but if it means being happy with RA, then he's okay with it.   he admits himself that he doesn't have anything he values more than his own life  I don't know if that changed or if he never realized it, but that's not true.       I hope Isayama gives us canon beardlet soon. Beardwin was heaven sent from above      He has a better personality than the both of them.  I don't even hate manlet but that's just not true. Reiner is bro-tier and at least all Erwin's decisions are his own.     Ymir is not a man, she is a strong independent woman. Having a penis doesn't make her a man.     Ymir   man   big dick       Woah people replied to you? That's unusual, sorry about that, it will never happen again. Stop whining already, you should have expected that because almost no one likes Levi here.    A true Historiafag acknowledges that Ymir fucked her and impregnated her and is okay with that.     Eren's ideals because he is selfless?  No, it's because like she said, he's one of those "special" persons that don't go with the flow.   I don't know if that changed or if he never realized it, but that's not true.  Please read  On a personal note I think he's not quite correct on this, I would bet he is capable of sacrificing himself for Annie or Reiner, but they're not dreams or ideals. He doesn't want to die for that, even on the off chance he was fed some bullshit about higher goals for their mission, what moves Bert are very personal things: his desire for home, and his care for RA.          True, she probably has a tiny penis actually, from all the estrogen she used to take to help her transition.    Can you post that panel where she has Ymir's jizz all over her face?    This this this. Historiafags are all cuckolds with a bull fetish.    He always comments on other people's beards. Can he even grow one?     Nah.    No one gives a shit, Reiner was her first. He took her virginity. Nigmir can have sloppy seconds for all I care.    I can accept she will never love me like she loves Ymir.    I'm going to assume he has testicles so in that case the answer would be yes.    No mate no. She loves you just as much as she loves Ymir!!    You Ymirfags can't accept that YH is yet another one sided romance in a series full of one sided romance and Historia sees her as a dear friend and nothing more.    There isn't a single character in the series who wouldn't be improved with the addition of facial hair.    Reiner could barely even talk to her.    But he was malnourished so perhaps he can't and wishes he could?    I'm not a Ymirfag I'm a Historiafag. And YH is the only reasonable pairing for her because Ymir makes her happy.    And? He is an alpha male, he doesn't need to talk, he needs to  FUCK___ . He just put it inside her and gave her an instant orgasm with no talking.    I agree. Even shitren would improve slightly.     I'm not a Ymirfag I'm a Historiafag  Nice try, really subtle. Eren makes her happy too  and no EH is not a thing  and if you were a Historiafag you would understand that.     I believe this poster and everything he says.      Nice Historiafags hate Ymir maymay. But I really am one.    Who said Historiafags hate Ymir? Are you retarded?    That's not Ymir's liquid. The titan is not part of Ymir's body (since it is obviously male and we 4channers believe that gender is biological and not an identity thing).    like gordon ramsey?    Even the females?   The 104th are a bunch of 15 yr olds, they can only grow baby beards and shit.       Because that seems to be what some think here the moment you say you're a Historiafag who likes YH or Ymir.    Gordon Ramsey is an EH/hetfag? Fucking dropped his show.     Funny how Annie comes off as such a cynic but is openly into the idealists.     Umm no I said that YH is one sided, I don't care about Ymir and that means I also don't hate her. I also don't care much about Eren. I don't ship EH or YH particularly, but both Eren and Ymir make Historia happy, but at least Eren doesn't throw her off cliffs and force her to do things.    It's because you're not a Historiafag if you like YH.  Your fag status is determined by the most beta character you support.  Ymir is clearly the more beta out of the YH duo, so you are an Ymirfag.  If you liked, in example, Judenmadchen x Eren, then you are an Anniefag since she is the more beta out of the two (the one who wants his kebab dick; Eren himself has a harem to choose from).          Beardwin was great but mostly because of that smile. Not the insane one but the small one. That was the first time he looked soft.    Most Historiafags hate Ymir.    Annie a good but I'll always be loyal to MikASSa no matter how much Isayama wastes her potential.  Dem abs still the best though.      How can you love Historia but not care about Ymir? Ymir is the one who helped her stop being suicidal and I kind of doubt Historia only sees her as just a friend considering her reaction to being separated from her. As for Eren, he's important to her too but I don't see the romance in EH.    Fuck off. Hetfag scum are NOT real Historiafags.    You mean the two or so who hate literally anyone who gets close to her? They don't count as anything but bitter waifufags.    She is a cynic that wants to believe and it's breaking my heart.     Ymir helped your favorite, you MUST like her!  How many times do we have to say it for Ymirfags to understand this? Ymir doesn't appeal to me as a character, and thus I don't care about her. You should be able to understand this concept since grade school.     The threads ain't ever gonna be as cozy as back then, but sure. Unfortunately I lost my ass folder years ago ;_;     Ymir is the one who helped her stop being suicidal  Yeah, because she wasn't suicidal at all in chapter 50+. At no point was she like "Fahkeet, just kill all the humanities gibsmedat serum papa!". Nope, Ymir did everything, Ymir da man.  Ymir himself ran away from her because he knew that his future is somewhere else.      Previews of the ED and bonus tracks of the second recap movie: http://shingeki.tv/music/movie_op.p<wbr>hp</wbr>    I am afraid for her to be back now that the SL has a serum.    I'm not a Ymirfag, again. And if you devalue Ymir as a character then you're ignoring a huge part of Historia's growth as a person. Not only that but she's also the most important person to her above all else.    I never thought I'd say that but I hope she stays in her crystal a bit longer. It's safer in there ;_;    This movie won't flop now that it'll have a lot of Levi, will it.    Everyone hated Annie before and during the anime though, what are you talking about. The Annie a shit type of posts were everywhere and so was the Jew maymay.    Obvious sarcasm, but it is true that Ymir helped a great deal even after she abandoned her.    I understand that, but I still don't see why I should like a character that my favorite interacted with. By that logic all Jeanfags should like Marco even if he was a redshirt and so on. Liking a character isn't a chain reaction.    Did you even read 66? Her memory of Ymir is what caused her to rebel against Rod. It's obvious that Ymir's words to her mean a lot to her otherwise she would have went through with taking the serum and eating Eren.     what are you talking about  I don't remember much if any hate during the time of Pandaniku's reign and before, when no one had a clue she was FT.  Speaking of Pandaniku, does anyone have a fullsize of his Sasha one? With the heart eyes? That was him, right?       You just replied to a shitposter    I just don't see why you would dislike Ymir either. Even if you don't like her much then at least acknowledge Ymir's importance to Historia.    Now that MT's mentioned her chances are she'll be relevant in this arc.    It's kinda logical to appreciate the character that pushed your shingeki to become the person they are now. Individually this character may not appeal to you, but it's an undeniable fact that without Ymir Historia would have gone nowhere.     when no one had a clue she was FT.  Here's your reason.      I do acknowledge her importance to Historia, I just don't like her as a character. It's not that hard to understand and you should stop whining when someone has a different taste than you.     Those were fun days.    What exactly do you have against Ymir? Don't tell me you're one of those who thinks she's "abusive".    I'm not saying that you should like her, it's just that a lot of Historiafags seem to devaluate Ymir's importance to Historia and to me it just comes across as being ignorant on purpose. It's a weird concept to me that Ymirfags or Historiafags would look down on the other character.    I have nothing against her, I have a lot against your whining though. Not liking a character doesn't mean I hate her.    Let me do it again then.    Yes it does. It's literally a synonym. Hate = not like.     Nah I like Ymir a lot but I can intellectually acknowledge the impact a character I dislike has on a character I like without having to appreciate them. Like how I acknowledge that boring as fuck Marco had a impact on Jean.  It's a fucking simple concept and not hard to understand.        Uh, no, not really. Again, stop being so defensive. I don't like her but I don't hate her either, that means I'm indifferent.     Well I guess as long as you appreciate her for what she's done. I just don't get the other Historiafags who hate on her, they seem to be retarded.    No, it simply indicates a lack of like. Indifference can play into it.  Don't be an idiot.      For yet another time, your whining is annoying. It's a different opinion and you should learn to accept it.   I just created my own Ymir figurine  (on the toilet) , anyone wanna see it?     moar MikASSa plz?      I do understand that much. For example I don't have much of an opinion on Historia but I do acknowledge that she's important to Ymir. To be fair comparing it to Jean and Marco's situation is weird, Marco barely had any relevance in the manga and his interactions with Jean were too little to really form an opinion on him and his relationship with Jean.    You're replying to a reverse shitposter.     Keep you filthy wanking elsewhere, neckbeards.     No, he isn't. You are so fucking autistic that you can't even tell your posts apart from mine, Ymirbro.    There's no such thing as reverse shitposting, there's only shitposting.    I wonder how much her dad plays into it. She said he "was" "high on a pipe dream of an ideal" which means either he broke down/changed his mind or he died.  Given his apologies, he probably broke down. Her being bent on keeping their promise means he still means a lot to her. But does she feel like he let her down? Is she looking for someone who won't back down on their dreams?  Will we ever get more Annie backstory? ;_;        How am I a reverse shitposter?   When's that new game coming out?   This this this. Neckbeards and hetshitters go away.  Now let's post some delicious Bert x Reiner. :-^)      I'm replying to a Ymirfag that claims to be a Historiafag. That's some form of reverse shitposting but that person believes his claims.    I lost my collection.    With all the bloom effects and shit, it looks like an average picture of a cosplayer.    Just stop anon, it's embarrassing.    Eren and Armin then.     being in this much denial   I'm probably the biggest Historiafag here. Being okay with Ymir doesn't make me a reverse shitposter.     Sure why not.    Sure.    Bert is like Makoto-lite for SnKfags huh?    Why is Reiner an ANT?    Noice.    I'm hoping she gets a redemption arc, seeing as her crimes are far less than BR's.    That is a bee.    No. He has nothing in common with Makoto. Makoto is a cute tomboy Idolmaster, Bert is not cute or a tomboy.     her crimes are far less than BR's  Seriously? Annie is responsible for the same amounts of deaths as BR, since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well.     That's a bee, not an ant.    Fuck I hope not. I love Annie but redemption arc is way too cheesy for BRA and she's not looking for redemption anyway.    It's not a fucking bee. I studied biology for 8 years and I can tell a bee and ants apart. It's an ANT ANT ANT.    The fags have arrived. Abandon thread.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-qL<wbr>BEI0SFI8</wbr>  [ ]    What's so unbelievable about a Historiafag who likes Ymir? You're probably just projecting.     kiss  Por Que?       Nothing is unbelievable, just the whole  hey guys Ymir is best shingeki, I'm a Historiafag btw and why don't you guys like Ymir?      The belief that Ymirfags and Historiafags must always be at odds because of a few autists.    Just wait for Season 2, all the porn will be delicious.     &gt;&gt;hey guys Ymir is best shingeki, I'm a Historiafag btw and why don't you guys like Ymir?  You lack reading comprehension      since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well  Pure speculation.   She's only ever been shown fighting enemy soldiers. She never kicked down walls and caused civilian deaths. She's actually been shown having regret when civilians have died (when Eren punched her onto that church she seemed shocked by the people she crushed).       I never said Ymir is best shingeki, she isn't even one of my favorites. But I am okay with her and can acknowledge her importance to Historia.    I've reached my limit anon. Can someone please help us post more delicious shingeki girl ass ;_;    Te voy a encontrar en la vida real. Voy a descomprimir mi pene y lo puso en su boca y lo frota en el interior hay hasta materia blanca sale y te trague, maldito coño. MUJERES EN VIDEOJUEGOS NO MÁS    She was still in cahoots with BR and when discovered she was completely unrepentant and antagonistic. She doesn't want to work with the SL anon, face it. Embrace Annie as she is.     Pure speculation.  Sure, Armin's speculation and nothing so far proves the opposite. Armin is always right by the way, we know that well.     My ass is much more delicious than her flat ass.    Soon.     her importance to Historia.  Historia has now a good relationship with Eren. She doesn't need Ymir anymore, kek     So if we agree, I see no reason for all your whining, I see her the same way as you claim you do.    Wow thanks for ruining makoto for me you CUNT    When I said redemption I didn't mean working with the Survey Corps, I just meant her sort of going her own way and no longer trying to kill humanity.     kek   Hetfags, everyone.      Will the following chapters and Season 3 make them rise in popularity? Their role might be even bigger than the one they had in chase arc and Utgard.    At first I though that was a Mikaso.    Historia can have more than one friend you know.    I'm kind of lazy but eh, why not.    I think we can both agree that Ymir is as important to Historia as I am important to you.    Oh you dick    I hope so,    Oh but you're very important to me anon. Will you marry me?    Gringo de mierda, no sabes escribir español. Vuelve a tu país de mierda.       Thanks man.   I see. Annie as a free agent could be interestinf but I wouldn't call that redemption, to be redeemed she has to compensate for what she's done, and to do that she has to do something real big for the SL. But that's just semantics.          I just leave it here     back muscles  Yes.        "I won't forgive her"   proceeds to defend her against Connie      I fucking love Hysteria. Araki and her VA better not fuck this up.    Do you have any reading comprehension? She even defended her afters.      This and her screaming during Utgard.    Are you retarded?      You know the only this this proves is how much Historia cares for Ymir. And she's being rather possessive, too.    If anything that page just proves how much Ymir meant to Historia you fag.    I'm worried none of the extra pages will make S2    *afterwards     tfw their canon underwear looks nothing like this       The extra pages are part of chapters 50 and 51 and they were included in the official volume release.    I'm worried they'll cut out Eren's interaction with anyone who isn't Mikasa. I'm still annoyed they didn't include Annie offering to train him in S1.    They're important scenes and too short to make OVAs from.   Then again the Annie and Eren bonding scenes were important too.        I hope the make an OVA of it.      I want to see her go Hysteria as the queen.      In last chapter she talked with Eren about BR    And didn't say anything about Ymir  Yes, she is still really important to Historia, I see       tfw looking forward to fapping over shota-looking Armin on a bed   tfw Araki removes it for the sake of shipping faggotry  Fuck everything        How can they make an OVA of a few pages. I can see them making another OVA of the joke pages though.    She asked about BR because she knows Eren wanted to kill BR. Why would she even mention Ymir.    Why would she bring up Ymir when talking about if Eren wants to kill BR?    Because Eren is only angry at BR, not Ymir.    I don't.  Unless Zackly goes wild first, causing her to go Hysteria on him and removing him from his post.     Annie a shit.   What would she be Hysterical over? the only thing I can think off is when Eren finally dies at the end of the series so she has to raise their daughter alone      Combine them. Or add filler about BRY hanging out/traveling.      crystallized shit    I think I'm out.    I'm sorry you feel that way.    Nope, one more.    H-Hot    That was a valiant effort, anon, thanks.    Sankyu    I would just like to see another Hysteria moment again.    Maybe when Ymir comes back and Historia chews her out for leaving.     chews her out  Lewd     What makes you think they will have a daughter? What if they have a son instead?   can we *please* stop discussing hetshit already   No she will yell at Reiner for leaving her behind. Didn't you see how depressed she was when Eren said he has to kill Reiner?    Maybe her VA practiced a lot. She's good friends with a perfect sparring partner.    You'd be depressed too if your new boyfriend wanted to kill your old boyfriend, your first true loev.     implying Reiner will come back  He's gonna die giving birth to an armored monkey titan.      inb4 instead of angry screaming, Araki will change it to moe pleading     It was already pretty moe.    Who do you think she will root for in the end? The handsome, strong Reiner who is also the perfect soldier or the cute, sensitive Eren who helped mend her broken heart?    He might ask her to make the 'haah' sounds during the kidnapping more lewd.    This is a joke right?  Of course if she could have her alpha male Lyner back she would drop that kebab into the loo where it belong.      She will blush and cry and plead for Ymir to return to her and fuck her in the ass.    Do you think she was exaggerating or does she really think Ymir is the worst human bean to ever walk on the face of the earth.    Obviously exaggerating.    She exaggerated.    It's Hisu. She says a lot of dumb shit to get people to do what she wants.    She's merely speaking the truth.    She's saying she's the worst girl because she's fishing for compliments. Obvious desire for kebab dick.    That's a mistranslation, she says that Ymir will never get into heaven.    Well that is a fact. Deviants don't go to Heaven, even in Christianity I think.    True.    That's what it says dumbass.    Nope she's just being emotional, b-baka.     implying Ymir deserves to go to heaven  No friend, that wasn't an exaggeration.     Ymr and Historia both are going to hell.   Can we get more LM fanart of the kiss.   See . It's not about deserves or not deserves. In all religion, deviant women go to Hell.    So then YH are going to hell.    Look for it on Pixiv.    Historia had blessed Aryan semen (Lyner's) inside her first, so there is still hope for redemption.    Reiner is no aryan, he's a homosexual. Plus Historia would bite his dick off.    Disgusting.   Ymir is nordic so she's going to Valhalla. Fuck heaven.   Reiner was defiled by a monkey.    Ymir is African,    No she wouldn't dare. If she tried to, he would squash her skull between his manly arms, no problem.    he thinks Congoid immigrants are Nordic just because their ancestors immigrated to Swedistan  Look at him and laugh. Now I understand why you guys own fedoras and katanas.        If Ymir is nordic then she's going to Hel.    Historia acts more like a man than cherry boy Reiner.    2015   still thinking a hell or heaven exist     Jean is an albino.     Valhalla  Valhöll*  Ymir would go to Náströnd in Hel.       Remember kids, if you touch your weenie you'll go to hell.   Reiner will never get laid. Historia even ripped her skirt off for him practically and all he could do is sit there and stare. He has zero game.   It was loveless rape. Reiner is still a pure maiden at heart.    Kek, good thing I don't have one then.    Eunuch freak.    No you.   Why are we discussing Pigner, Stinkmir and the Bimbong when we could talk about much more interesting characters?   Sorry, we can talk about Blort now.    Of course, not only does he own a fedora and katana - Ymirfag is also an atheist.  Is there anything positive about you as a human being?       implying I'm a Ymirfag  Atheism is the only true way, my friend.     Why is Mikasa still thirsting after Shitren?    So either way you confirm yourself to be a euphoric gentleman.    She's yet to realize that Jean is the true MC and the best boy.    Shitkasa doesn't deserve Jean.    True, but Jean wants her and Jean gets what he wants.    Not even close.    <br/>    Why are you posting a picture of the BR fujo?    Stop posting your selfies Ymirfag.     implying Ymirfag is a woman  Nice try Ymirfag, you'd wish you were even a morbidly obese one.    Would Historia be angry if I stick my big penis in her butt?   It's Valhalla. Stop going to Google for alternate spellings to make yourself seem smarter. You're retarded.    She'd shit and fart on your dick.    Not if you're Reiner. If you're Ymir, she's gonna panic and worry about getting AIDS.   Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present  /ai/ - Idle Activities .   Dear lord.

Destiny does require PS+ for almost all of it's game modes, I believe.      Enkidu?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127110626  Are you still doing the testing?   Oh damn. I should get it later today.         What is this shitty feelings after finished Rebellion. I am not even saying Rebellion's bad. It's good. But this feelings man. I can't stop thinking Homura can never be happy from now on.   I hate this feeling. When she also personally tells you, it's even worse.    Learn to cope with it, and hope every day for the sequel announcement.     It's a Fate reference to one of Gilgamesh's noble phantasms used to chain people up.     Because you misunderstood a lot. The ending is the only way for Homura to be happy.    Oh yes. Happy. That's what they're calling it now.    Oh. Please chain me from this hell.   Absolutely happy?       There's probably going to be a sequel. I mean Homuworld seems to be hanging together by just a thread. All it takes is one little push and BOOM it goes bye-bye.    Homu personally tells me?  Dunno if I event want a sequel or not. ;_;  She sure looked happy in the ending of course. Maybe I should cope with that fact. It's just, I am not even forcing my kind of happiness, I am with the common sense of happiness.   How can I put this, you know villains in fictions usually feel happy when they do something "wrong" like, razing, destroying or killing like that right? I felt similar vibes from Homu's happiness.  Anyway, I can't say anything if that's the thing she really wanted. I can't do anything but have shitty feelings.            There's definitely going to be a sequel, because Shaft needs its drug money. The only question is how long this wait will be.     Stuff to consider. I'm off today and tomorrow.     Comparing to "Madoka takes Homura to heaven" it's super happy ending for her, but not for everyone else .     I had a dream Homurabtood me she is happy Madoka can live a normal life, but is miserable herself.   Well then, I gotta get a move on.       *Homura told me    *even  Yeah, I felt similar vibes even she actually revivified megucas.   I just. Man. If Homu felt like shit because Madoka sacrificed her eternally. It is also okay for me to feel like shit because Homura turned into a devil eternally.        How long has it been since you watched it?   Homura just can't be happy in this new world, where she desperately tries to connect to Madoka, but must let her be so her plans of keeping Madoka safe happen. It's a delicious irony in her part to put herself in this position.       Madoka never loved Homura, Homura will never be happy in a non insane sense. All she wants is to possess and control Madoka against her will. She ruined everything for that, but she is happy. Madoka will see to it that she suffers alone for her sins.   Shut the fuck up man. No. Sorry. Don't shut up and continue man. If doing like that makes you feel better.   ,1 Thank you, friend.    She wants to protect Madoka but she doesn't want her to change.  In fact Madoka saying in Rebellion that she wouldn't want to leave anyone is based of her before she saw Sayaka and Kyouko's sacrifices. In other words Homura can't accept a Madoka different from the one in her head.      Hah! Are you two now friends?    No you.   She was happy as a god, the dialogue was her being brainwashed by the barrier. She just says what Homra wanted to hear so she can insanely justify her ruining everything.       I thought we were friends.    Oh yeah, and it's all going to come back to bite her in the ass.  The big question is how.     Imagine the look on Homura's face when Madoka gets her powers back, expecting to fight, but receiving love instead.   Madoka and her real friends killing her.   Blank, because it won't happen. Madoka never loved Homura and hates her now.       I believe this will happen    You do realise Madoka is basically all loving right?     What kind of friggin assblasting anime this is.  assblasting means noice  It even spawned this weird fanfic guy in the thread.     She never loved Homura. She tolerated her and pretended to like her. Now that Homura is all consuming evil she will kill her and find happiness.      Dammit Mami first Nagisa and now this?   And just like Madoka having to fight her own witch, I believe Homura must one day fight herself. All her insecurities, all her pessimism. She can't be truly free until she loves herself, and allows her to be loved.     lalala I can't hear u~~   I win!!!   lalalala  It's funny how crack shippers have the mentality of a four year old.  Seriously, you fucking ruin these threads with your shipping faggotry. You're so lucky that you have a literal tumblr mod in power to protect you instead of the old mods that used to ban people for shipping.          Hey, cool bro. If you meet her in your dream next time, tell her to visit Dan's dream livin' in NV right?    Bullshit, Madoka will just kill her. Homura has no love or character.    I can't control my actions in my dreams. I would've prevented some if I could.    You are just so cute. Do you get your jollies this way?    Like cumming inside of Kyoko?    Shh, I bet he's fappin' now.     Yes!     I'd love to rape Homura then watch Madoka kill her.   No.       It's nothing bad trip guy. Just briefly wash with your hands and dry it whenever that happens.    I didn't want that dream. It's very bad!    You can safely do it now then. I can even watch for you if anyone's coming to your room. No need to thank, it's called universal brotherhood.    But Homura already did all that in Rebellion. Devil form is love and freedom incarnate. Also Madoka never fought her own witch?    Why is it bad? It's perfectly natural, and everyone has them. Kyouko would understand.      I don't like dreaming of having sex with a 14 year old. Kyouko would be disgusted at everyone.    You don't? Really? Well, then tell her to visit my dream and have fun with me please. You're a good guy so I know you'll do.    If I tell her that she will be upset because Kyouko loves me and only me. I will do no such thing.    Akuma is not freedom. A true freedom would allow both good and bad to happen.   Also Madoka fought her own witch?  "all witches, with my own hands," including Kriemhild Gretchen.    At least you recognize it as wrong. That's what separates us from the animals. But there's not much you can do still when your subconscious wants what it can't have.            everyone has them  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gvd<wbr>f5n-zI14</wbr>  [ ]     Try not to masturbate for a few days.

It also is the reason why you should be 100% okay with that ending, since she has already learned to cope with it anyway. Homura being unhappy simply is Homura being herself, except that now everyone has been handed better lives thanks to it. A net positive.  As an aside, Homura hates sympathy from strangers and does not really care about anybody's opinions on her feelings. Not even Madoka's.      To be fair, better have no second chair nearby than have one accompanied by a puddle of pink goo.     She has never been.   LIES!     homu   Both are pretty bad, tbh. The only thing worse would be the chair never existing in the first place.  Now imagine that sequel. Madoka being written out of reality.       You got it in the opposite. Homura exchanged her eternal happiness in Madoka's side for the chance to give Madoka a better fate than the head of some law of the universe, with the side effect of also bringing back a bunch of people that had befriended some of her acquaintances in that previous dream world.    I wish I can sleep with Homu.    Akuma get out of /a/.     Mami-san &gt; Nagisa &gt; Kyouko &gt; Madoka &gt; Sayaka &gt; Homura  Will Ayanero deliver a new one in this comiket?

Yes, yes. That's why Homura rekt LoC. Homu got mad at Madoka for taking all the glory from her. Now Homu is the real queen who did real SHIT.     It's too hot, Apple~chi. I hate this.      I know.

We all know Madoka never loved her and we all know Homura ruined everything since she was mistakenly brought into this world. She lives to suffer alone and eventually die, it's what Madoka wants.  Besides, Madoka is better off with no Homura around, and much happier. Homura is a plague on society.      It's up to him or !HOMU to tell you.    I disagree. I likeHomu.    That's like saying Inlike cancer or I like the guy who murdered my whole family. Literally nobody likes Homura, they think they do but their idea of Homura is a falsehood, a lie. She is nothing but trash. Evil trash. Madoka hates her and so does everyone.  She DESERVES to suffer alone and unloved. FUCK her.     NEW SYMPHOGEAR GX PV! GET HYPE, FAGGETS!

If you are not actively trying to link the moonspeak you hear to the subtitles you are not gonna learn anything even if you watch anime for 50 years.    Neither. OP is called Exterminate and ED called Rebirth-Day. Probably gonna be a battle song. Sounds a lot like a finale song though.

Then they'll be reminded of their position again once Nana starts to do her job and once they see her sing live.     I hope at least red and blue do. They are cute as fuck.

I liked Tsubasa's G gear more, why do they have to remove parts of their already revealing gears? Are they prostitutes or something?       Are they prostitutes or something?  Idols. Same thing really.     Hibizerker will appear as a separate entity, have a crazy punch-on with Hibiki, then be tamed by the power of SUNSHINE.    They should've let Ayahi sing that, for god's sake. Nana x Ayahi duet when?     Are you implying Nana is a prostitute? Don't compare actual pure idols to the sluts that fuck everyone for money and don't give a shit about their fans.        Nana   Idol   Bitch she's an artist.      Did they put Maria in a goddamn straitjacket What are they afraid she'll do, cry at them?    They're afraid her uselessness might spread to other Gears.    She is called an idol too by some people, fucker.     That was the joke.   Now post what you hear her singing.      But Tsubasa isn't a prostitute. If anything she'll be the one to buy the prostitutes.      Tsubasa became Chris' new pimp     Please no bully. Chris is pure.     That doesn't stop her from having a youth full of hard work.       Tsubasa-senpai please stop with your heart hymen thing.       not hibiki  what    That concert looks even more amazing than in G. I can't wait for the song.    So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Also the fact that they're bringing back the shitty G Gears is making me reeeeeeeeee       chuck boulders  Eat, sleep and movies.   sprint across water  Ninja.        Miku already bought them all.   So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Ogawa is literally a ninja. Genjuro is just that manly.         nolongerpodracing.jpg     They watched lots of action movies.  reeeeeee  Fuck off back to       Jesus Christ this PV almost dislocated my jaw. I'm going to need to buy a stand of some sort before the first episode if I want to come out unscathed.    She got a boobpad instead.    The House of Ogawa  The House of Ogawa: Descendants of ninjas from the Hida clan. A long time ago, the Ogawa family worked for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but they disappeared during the Battle of Sekigahara until they reappeared after the Meiji Restoration to work for the government. Since then, they've fought to subvert the country's domestic enemies who work to try and bring down the government. The previous leader of the family, Ogawa Kunimitsu, died and the eldest brother of the siblings, Souji, took over. The second eldest, Shinji, used his abilities to become a direct agent of the government. Suteinu, the youngest brother, was freed from any familial responsibility because he did not want to inherit the old traditions. So he became a host at a hostclub in Kabukichou, Shinjuku known as "Absolute Zero." There he's known as the No.4 host "Alan" and works throughout the nights. The technique that Tsubasa utilizes, Shadow Weaving, was originally Ogawa Shinji's forte. Tsubasa was attracted to the convenience of the move and mastered it over the course of 3 years.   chuck boulders  Eat, sleep and watch movies.         So no then. Because it bugs me when a show tries to keep a consistent set of rules, but then throws in Kill la Kill "lol anything goes" whenever it wants.  Also who else looking forward to more awful Engrish this season?         Genjuro is consistently a badass. Ogawa is consistently a ninja. I don't see the problem here.      consistent set of rules  You might be in the wrong thread, anon, this is for Symphogear.     holy shit that combination song, dat PV, dem witches and actually exploring something outside of relics and shit. just so damn hype.

The four dolls use tarot sets, coin for earth, cup for water, sword for wind and wand for fire.    So they really did it, sword hag fighting another sword hag.   We had little snippets of the G battle songs this time two years ago.  Fucking when?      More Chris and Bikki soon  My body is ready.     So Maria pretty much confirmed shield then? Else there'd be 3 swords.    same seiyuu    Are we going to get yuribait like Hibike or actual Yuri in this?     both of those outfits are ultra lewd        actual yuri   Haha, nice one.      Prince and princess    Miku's combat song in S2 is a literal confession of eternal love for Hibiki. The final attack has everyone  hold hands . Kirika and Shirabe shower together. I'm not sure how much more yuri this show could get without onscreen tribadism.    My only disappointment is they didn't flash a mysterious shot of hibizerker, then my hype would be infinite.    Maria just standing there in a dress     IIRC the last one has a club. Simple enough.     to be fair she seems to have some kind of stance  maybe she has been watching movies, eating and sleeping       She pulled out a sword in the G finale but it just turned into light and covered the entire group. Her main concern also seems to be protecting people like protecting them from the fireball so she's pretty much the shield.  I'd be pleasantly surprised if they go full Shield Hero on her. Too much offense on their group anyway.      Genjuuro training montage with the G geahs when?    That's because it happens when Miku gets killed by the red doll.  My dad works for Nana.      She's classy as fuck.    Well, she is the oldest of the Geahs so it would fit.    Please no bully. I don't think she even has a relic.   tfw I'll never be Maria   I can't be a damsel in distress and have Tsubasa protect me like a prince         I don't think she even has a relic.  She has one, but it's broken. Just like her.     They probably confiscated their gears sometime after G so it might take a while for the three to get them back.    Wasn't she in a strait jacket? I don't think they'll just give a relic to someone who I think they just recently released. I'm thinking they just let her be there because Tsubasa's there to keep an eye on her.    I expected more Tsubass from the front high-cut Damn!       Glorious nippon steel vs filthy gaijin sword   yfw gaijin sword wins the first few matches        who fist pumping here?    She used to have Serena's old broken relic. I don't know if they would have confiscated that.     Is she going to be finally useful in this season    I just can't help but be reminded of another supposedly hypercompetent mahou shoujo who was deemed useless for most of her season    Yeah but it's still a relic that they can examine even if it's broken. I doubt they'll let her keep it because of an excuse like it's a memento.  Thinking about it, I'm not sure what will be the more interesting route. They took away the relic and she just regains it some time later or if she has the relic but it doesn't work at the moment.       Maria    useful  You already know the answer.      Since when was Maria ever even supposedly hypercompetent though?    During G episode 1 and 2.    She was FIS's trump card and was supposed to be more than a match for the other Geahs. She also had a more complete copy of Gungnir than Hibiki.  People often forget that Maria was actually cool for two episodes       imprisoned   in what looks to be a straitjacket   hair is still fixed up with ribbons   I was hoping she'd have her hair down.       Whenever I look up Maria's hair, I can't help but see her semi-twintails looking like cat ears.   Everyone on the villainteam was competent in the first 2 episodes, but we know that this quickly fell apart. Maria just amassed the biggest pile of useless actions out of all of them.  Being a useless single mom is her charm though.     Miracle of the universe   Just like her seiyuu.     She was FIS's trump card and was supposed to be more than a match for the other Geahs.  You should really read pre-show material. She was never supposed to be even remotely as strong as the others. Hell, the show itself shows it, Tsubasa takes her on without even transforming and then practically one-shots her once the cape's novelty has worn out.      I think that was intentional.    Isn't that intentional? I thought it was stupid the first time I saw it, now it looks cute.    True dat     During G episode 1 and 2.  Ah yes, let us count the ways Maria was competent in the first episode.  practically goes "mustn't run away mustn't run away" before her speech   only manages to hold an untransformed sword back because her heel broke   accidentally throws her into a bunch of Noise   gets completely wrecked by transformed sword   ends the episode saying HOW THE FUCK ARE THOSE GUYS SO STRONG WHAT THE HELL  She did ace the concert, I'll give her that.           hibiki riding a rocket     tfw no more Tsubasa-senpai  ;_;     Hopefully next week. Damnit, King Records.     Nana announced it will be in her next radio show on sunday.    We now get Chris-senpai instead.    Tsubasa and Maria better infiltrate the school for one episode like how Shirabe and Kirika did it.    I want to get off the ride already. I'm going to die of a heart attack once GX airs.  She did good in the concert, but let's be honest, if Shirabe and Kirika didn't come to help her she'll be lying in the hospital bed crying to Tsubasa.       DESS!    Miku pls  you're right though      I want Meganebasa. I'm sure she'll look beautiful and cool as fuck.      Perhaps, just holding is not enough    Is Hibiki bisexual?   Amen. Aoi and Nana are miracles of the universe, I'm so glad I lived long enough to see those two being the perfection they are.     WOW!  3 int!       that bunny  CUTE U T E          Did Maria even go to school? Seems like she was a lab experiment then a terrorist. She'll probably be so excited just like the kids were and forget the goal of the infiltration.    Is she even pure?    She's handsexual    It's fucking perfect. I had my doubts reading the plot description at first but holy shit I'm hype now.     The FIS receptor children probably all had some kind of basic education simply for discipline.    Don't know if Maria and Serena went to elementary school when they were living in Yugoslavia.    Pls don't bully the dess  Doesn't one of her character songs actually talk about how self-conscious she is of her lack of education?      Why is the tall gray haired background girl paired with the main cast and not with Anime Janai?  Inb4 she's the final boss.      I'm so fucking ready. The wait is fucking killing me.   Dat soundtrack   Dat determination    Dat everything          Zombie Kanade  confirmed!    Dr.Ver and somebody else.    She's Shirou waifu     That blush    Symphogear is like a train wreck that sorta knows it's a train wreck and knows that you know it's a train wreck, but it doesn't care and just embraces its own ridiculousness, resulting in multi-track drifting.   I love it.      Dess's desss will catch up with Zenbu's zenbus one day.   The idol outfits actually look good with the lighting and in action. I was worried it wouldn't since it looked weird when I saw it at first.   It's like those low budget wacky B ranked action movies, they're retarded but super fun to watch.  And the fact Genjuro is a huge fan of good and bad action movies and we have references there and there makes me believe this kind of multi-track drifting is intentional.      S1 was not a train wreck.       trainwreck  Nope, Symphogear is the train that's rushing towards a bridge rigged with explosives which are detonated when the train is on it but it just jumps out of the fireball of the explosion while defying all physics and lands on the tracks again, completely unscathed.     EREKEJIGE       Look at those Radiant Forces. Amazing.       There is no way we are going through the entirety of this season without at least a small cameo of Ver.    Exterminate song list confirmed  Hype intensifies. http://www.mizukinana.jp/news/      Aoi and Nana are miracles of the universe  Kinda shame we never got an anime where one would molest the other.    Just woke up. That was hype as fuck. I just know it's going to be the best show of the season.   that bit of the PV where the main three sing at once and it shows a close up of their faces  I love that shit.   Holy shit that song is hype  How big will the threads be?   This shit is literally female Naruto    Aim for 2000!    Except it's not in any way. At all.     implying female naruto isn't vastly superior to male naruto by design.     They are quiet now, but when the shows starts airing the bandwagoners will start hopping in.    No it's not even close in any form whatsoever.   There's better places to shitpost than quiet threads on /a/.      Episode 4 or 5 probably  This time to eye of the tiger      I miss ginka    My entire body has become semen    I want him yelling GUNGNIR DATTO on episode 1 again    I miss gay werewolf.     I want a season 2.     How was it? I never watched it, but it looks kinda fun and the gifs I've seen of it look great.      orange   muh friends   punch stuff to death         You choose well.      some things are orange things in real life   some people have friends in real life   some people punch stuff to death in real life  Real life confirmed for Naruto ripoff.  Nah but seriously,  kill yourself .         Not that anon, but I dropped it once arrived at Money's dad part. Maybe one day I'll pick it up again, I'm not sure if I want to know how it ends though.     No?    Oh come on you're not even trying. Not to mention 'muh'.   Even if you were serious, it would show how little anime you've watched or manga you've read if you think power of friendship is so confined.      Its a "happy" ending. Just finish it    first thing Hibiki does is rescue a little boy from a burning building    I want to be that shota     see    perhaps, just holding is not enough   what can those hands prtotect         Its not 1 or 2 things its the combination of it all that makes it like naruto  even the villain in this show is a generic guy who wants to destroy the world  this show is shit and only watched because of the girls and the singing gimmick        Oh well, at least you're not going for the easy path saying it's a madoka ripoff, kudos for that.   Surprised a doll is going to show up at their concert in England. Guess they're specifically going after the geahs.    when they are showing ogawa talking to maria in prison   ver is in the next booth waiting for someone to talk to him   we get a small peek at him as the camera swivels to maria       Is Naruto the only other anime you've watched? Is it the only piece of entertainment you've consumed since you're complaining about generic guys destroying the world.   You're seriously retarded and so is your mentality.       They'll be relatively nice since theres about 14 other shows that are more shitpost worthy than our little sanctuary here.  We will of course get one or two faggots though  Best to just report, hide and ignore him. Dont even give him the response he seeks.        This guy is right. Character from both show have hair, IT'S A RIPOFF    Its not a tsubasa concert without something or someone trying to crash it and kill everyone   What will be your face if Maria does something useful?   They also have really big eyes, all have fighting uniforms and continually fight monsters every episode.  Confirmed for Sailor Moon rip off      Better recommending him other Shounen Jump manga.    But that's impossible    Something like this.    I'm looking forward to her awesome fight.      stopping a rocket with her bare hands    it's happening     I figured she was hitching a ride on it. They have to catch a falling space shuttle right?     Looks like she has no hands.    LN anticipation and cute Yuushas thread. Will we get more Sequel bait or an actual announcement? Also how many girls got sacrificed during the 300 Years of Vertex Invasions? Will the VN2 ever get script translated?       Will the VN2 ever get script translated?  Try not to give up!     I was about to make a thread!  When was the release date of the LN chapter again? And I am right to assume nothing VN related has been translated since the last thread?  Does anyone else feel sorry Takashima? No matter how awesome she is, she will always be overshadowed by the perfection that Yuuki Yuuna is.  Assuming they are not the same person or something like that.          26th     26th  Shit, that soon?      I'm here with you fellow yuushabrothers     And then YuYuYu Only on the 5th. And they already have announced a YuYuYu Only II to be held in September. So interest was quite high.     She looks better in the white than in the blue. Togo is fine in the blue, but this is better for Sonoko.       Have there been any leaks as to what the new girls look like?    No, yet there is aleady fanart of Takashima.    Cute    I don't think that any girls got sacrificed between Year 1 and Year 298. Shinju's barrier was doing fine on its own, and Amaterasu was just watching for him to show signs of him losing power.  The Taisha's bumbling is a pretty good clue I think that there were no Yuusha in service at all for centuries, just a written plan to mobilize some when Shinju asked. Gin, Sonoko, and Sumi's original weapons were I think the same kind of weapons they had used in 2018, and might have been effective against stardust. If their had been more Yuusha, their weapons would have been more advanced off the bat.       Is she going to have pink hair? Or are they going to play it straight and have these early Yuusha all have normal black/brown colored hair and eyes?    They are only a year apart but this makes Karin look so much older than Itsuki.  I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.     it's shit.    This is pretty good.   why are people getting baited so easy?    sex   not the pure     Get the fuck out with that horrid shit.  Onee-chan or imouto?   Why not be the middle child and have both?    Onee-san.    Imouto because Onee-chans are already tainted temptresses.    Twin sister you fag    Neither because I'm not an incestuous faggot   imouto with oneesan personality  The answer is you should be open to both possibilities.  It would be mean to discriminate your sister, just because she was a bit older than you, or just because she's younger than you.  I would like to fuck Mikan senseless though.         Onee-san that looks like a imouto   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591  Please kill yourself.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591   The Irregular at Magic Middle School.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591  Boku no Cockblock    I suspected it was a bad idea to ask before i posted, thank you for confirming my suspicions. Somedat, my knowledge of /a/'s culture will eventually reach a level where I, too, can tell offenders to kill themselves     The safest thing to do is to Image Search. (And yeah, you get the answer for this one). The second is to bait people into answering for you.     You don't even have to do that, show's name is in the metadata.    not picking Onee-chan   Unless the onee-san is at least 3-5 years older then it might as well be an imouto.   how can i say not imouto after the qt3.14 you posted anon?    anime Mikan sucks   Who would stick their fingers in a marshmallow?   it sucks when you are the middle and all you have are brothers. fuck that shit.    That's old manga, Mikan looks more ugly there.  Anime is better.      Mein bruder   Oneesan, unless the imouto is Mikan, in that case Mikan   Anime is shit   Oneesan   Overprotective neesan   IMOUTO FOR LIFE    there will never be an anime or a manga about a delinquent oneesan protecting her otouto     Holy fuuuuuuck    Has Ishikei made anything new lately?    Onee-san   a significantly older Onee-chan that just hasn't moved out of the house and is drunk every night.    This man speaks truth.    Nee-sans of the triangle variety.   Unlucky Malcom     NBR  DROPPED    Onee-san   You don't deserve a nee-san.   Remove nee-san.   This, but only if you came out first so she still has to call you onii-chan.   <br/>   Onee-chan always.    I hate my one-chan so imoutos are best        Onee-san, how is this even a question?    Yes I would!  Especially because she's my sister.      Prove it    Wrong, I'd do anything for her, so if she wants to fuck I will    Why not both?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  hownew.ru    The two toothbrush are touching.  Is his penis finally kissing his sister's womb?     Onee-chans are double edged blades. On one hand, they can be more voluptuous and therefore more attractive. On the other, they can become used goods quicker. I'm going to have to go with imoutos on this one.    Well since I would usually say "neither" I'm going to create a situation where I am forced to choose.  If my mind were warped so that I would have to have a fetish for one of those two then I would choose Onee-chan.  You see I wouldn't trust myself influencing lesser minds than my own, that is known as corruption and unlike Kyousuke or Haru I am not comfortable with reaping the rewards of manipulation.  Onee-chans are older and more experienced. They're far more likely to be aware of what they're doing and able to bear the responsibility of their actions. So naturally the only acceptable answer would be Onee-chans.  They also tend to be tall, have long dark hair, and be on the busty side. So naturally they're more womanly as well which is far more desirable than undeveloped and tiny.            She's so damn sexy     they can be more voluptuous and therefore more attractive  What about voluptuous imoutos?     christmas cake imouto    Has Mikan's belly been impregnated?    Anon please, she's just a child      I hope you mean pic unrelated because that's definitely a 12 y/o at best    It's the pineapple sex hair    Old enough to bleed, old enough to breed.    So you want some one who can fend for themselves? I can agree with that.    Eleven, actually    best friend that you call onee chan, when she is actually only a few days older than you.    This is loli... This doesn't feel right    Why contain it?    Onee-chan on face Imouto on dick     Is there actually anything like this?    More?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  You dont deserve those trips.    I love that him fingering his little sister's asshole was animated.  Thank you Japan.     Considering picking up this series just because of OP webm?  Good or bad idea?      look up source   find it   look it up in my list   dropped at ep1   Is it worth it guys?         Read the manga, faggot.     The show can't hold a candle to our based god Yabuki     yes, S1 is not that good tho, 2 and 3 are breddy gud    It's sixty odd episodes of ecchi romcom that consists mostly of Rito falling and landing exclusively in someone's breasts, ass, or thighs or wacky hijinks caused by Lala's inventions. Watch it if you have the time and feel you can put up with it.  Alternatively: Read the fucking manga, faggot.      Love this artist.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127085241   start watching halfway through the series   HURRRRR, who are all these characters?!      I don't think I've seen it explicitly mentioned, but some sibling doujins have siblings in their twenties.    Isn't she NBR to him? I only have a vague knowledge of this series.    yes, he is adopted.    Ah, so NBR then.     This is one of my favorite manga, but I couldn't get past episode 4 of season 1 and I tried watching it several times Try Season 2, it's more true to the manga.<br/>     imoutos   As a person who has older sisters I choose Imoutos.    She has the hips and thighs of a big teen already  I want to impregnate her so badly      As someone who has neither I choose both.    How is she so perfect?    at least the op was top tier    As someone who has both i choose neither       As someone who has both I choose imouto.  Nee-sans a shit, imoutos are love.         You a shit   Your sister can't help it if she's a bit older or younger than you.  You're just an asshole if you reject her based on that. Please fuck off if that's the case.     Nee-sans a shit.     ...and I came     I like to believe that you are a sister to someone and have a complex about being older or younger than them. Not fitting your brothers preferred.    As someone who as an imouto, I choose imouto.    As someone who is an imouto I choose oneesan    Is onee-chan closer to onii-chan or imouto?    I kinda want that frog backpack     What is faster than a kiss      your imouto will never look at you like that     degenerate    Oh I'd love to start some blogshit right now.    Don't judge me.    Imouto.    this    NBR       I just don't care for onee-san's in general. My general preference is for a submissive girl, regardless of age, but for some reason, even if the onee san is submissive, I just can't get into it.     It's a crime against humanity that she isn't in one of our beds right now.    Do you like tsundere imoutos who are only secretly submissive to their baka anikis?    hold on anonkun, when VR hits full force we can all mean up in the m/a/nsion online arm in arm with our waifus.      Mine specifically    Oneesan, only imoutos I like are Mikan and the one from amagami ss    Oh my....     middle child and all i have are sisters  they treat me like shit      lwhy there's always an asshole that thinks /a/ is his blog?     This, only imoutos O like is Mikan but that's because she acts like an oneesan half the time  Nice blog asshole       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090180  on /a/ it is    Because the world is full of retards, and sometimes they get in /a/     It's always funny to see the newest people acting like they're some sort of gatekeeper      disgusting otaku     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest. And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.    Stop it anon, you shouldn't be sexualizing your daughteru!   It's always funny to see the new people act like they're not new    Liza a hot.    New mods and janitors seem to say otherwise, a pity really.    She's not my daughteru and I'll sexualize her all I want     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest.  It's not, that two assholes like it doesn't mean it's okay  And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.  Again, its not       I've been warned because of incest blogshit multiple times already. You know like, she wore my shirt after a shower or, she grabbed me from behind to show me some move and I've felt het boobs on my back.      new   implying it was ever okay in the first palace      Try telling me what to do fag.    Stop being so bitter that you don't have any sister. Or stop being a monster without heart that can't enjoy the purest form of love.     You're the one that seems new to me. Do you want every Imouto thread to just be some image dump of Imoutos? You have to have some OC otherwise it is just a fucking circlejerk with pictures.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791   Incest   /b/   Please, incest is a pretty big thing in my chinese cartoon and weeb industry. Next time you will tell me that lolis are bad, right?       tfw I have an onee-san but she's a lesbian   Fucking /u/ ruining everything.    Incest is gross, otakus are gross, that's why they like it   Dick her straight.     Normalfags not welcome.     Why do you think it is gross?   Confirmed Mikan best imouto. And i thought nobody liked her, my dick is diamonds when i see her   He's probably american        I'm american and I want to fuck my sister.  I'm from the rural south though so I'm just a stereotype.     are you dumb? brothers are better in every way   Why are all imoutos silly in 3D?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791  /b/ incest threads are for shitty captioned pictures of 3D and fake greentext stories.    Not all of them   I want to make love with pineapple-tan   do it faget    Nope, the only people that like Mikan are onee-san fags and that's because Mikan is just a loli nee-san. Nee-sans a shit.    What the fuck does that even mean    She acts like a nee-san, not an imouto ergo she is just a loli nee-san, and nee-sans a shit should be self explanatory.    You're fucking retarded, you know that?   Always  <br/>    complying you have a sister     And you think /a/ ones are true? Fucking idiot     neesans   shit  What an idiot      That's my waifu, you piece of shit!    OHB wouldnt lie to us. A good end like he had is the only thing that keeps this godforgotten world from being consumed by darkness.    oh, look sisters thread   blogshit, people fighting over blogshit and newfags that don't even know TLR     I know TLR I just have no interest in harem shit.    Of course not, but /a/'s fake incest stories tend to be more than just &gt;slutty sister &gt;be me &gt;had sex.     I know TLR  You clearly not if you had to ask if it was good     Still not a n excuse to blogshit     not having read the manga     Isn't the manga still harem shit just more lewd?    お姉ちゃん    Just go and read it or shit the fuck up       I haven't read the manga     you seem to be confusing "occasionally tolerated/flying under the radar" with "allowed"    I suppose that's a more appropriate analogy.      What's the artist name?     I like it when they're as close in age as possible, twins preferably, but really I don't care. I can't get enough.  Truly the purest form of love     reverse-search, faggot.    That's the problem, I do reverse search and I get nothing    not google    I liked that one for some reason even if I'm not a fan of femdom.     implying iqdb ever gives you someth-  Son of a bitch it worked     you need to learn which service is appropriate for which kind of content   Listen up motherfuckers.  Imoutos are the best. That is all.     If you were going to pick up a series just because of that, then TLR is literally the series for you. Happy fapping, anon.    S1 is really slow and honestly just bad. S2 gets better, and darkness gets even better. You can honestly speedwatch a few episodes of S1 to get the characters down, then jump straight to S2.    Manga is good, anime is shit    Is that a shop, the have the exact same eyes.     No one has translated this yet     Unless all imoutos are Mikan, you're wrong    Except they don't.    No its not a shop, the anime implies that she's Shirou's imouto, who died in the fire. Also that would explain why Illya always mistakes him for Shirou in the mornings       Put you and your sister's name into the penis/vagina affinity analyzer and show your sister the results.      That outfit is far too sexy    I don't know if Kyousuke would let her outside in that.    Strictly for at home with him.    Worst. Girl.      Is this a Cirno thread now?    got any sadpanda links to them?    Same. Reality has proven to me that older sisters are shit so that may stem my bias and makes me wish I had a real imouto.      https://archive.moe/a/thread/126750<wbr>974/#126802854 Not sure if betacuck or gay </wbr>        You failed as a little brother, you failed hard.     Sora alone makes all imoutos best.      Sora   good  Pick one       Seeing as how Sora = good I pick Sora, always.     Sora doesn't even make up for Kirino. The record shows imoutos are still shit.     Now you're just shitposting anon, though this is expected since you are a nee-san fag, which are below even negroes in terms of intelligence.     Don't assume I'm 'pick one' anon. Sora wasn't very appealing in the anime, and as a whole doesn't counter the number of shitty imoutos throughout animu and mango.    Nah you're shitpoting. Only a shitposter would say this trash.    Sora a shit.    Only shitposters pretend that imoutos aren't vastly inferior to nee-sans.     Neat.    The correct word is "superior" anon, not inferior.         Most onee-sanfags don't even see the difference between NBR and Blood related which is utterly disgraceful.   Oneechan forever.   NBR, not a nee-san.    Nee-sans don't show up a lot in animu or mango, I take what I can get.    They're not sisters anon, you are simply deluding yourself.    Then they're not a true big sister, anon. They're just an older caretaker type female.    You're in desperate need of standards, anon.     Its nowhere near the same if its NBR. Not even close.      Christmas cakes are great too.    I don't go outside much.   I can see why a blood relation for imoutos tends to be necessary but is it the same for nee-sans? NBR imoutos tend to be tsunderes while NBR nee-sans tend to be childhood friends or keiki. I don't think blood relation is quite as essential for nee-sans but I would entertain some differing opinions on this matter.            She's plainly average an pesonality is unappealing, but the main problem is really the Sorafags. They always hijack imouto threads to blow up how important they are, but in reality, they're so few they YnS threads either die out of suffer from constant samefagging.    Then they aren't fucking onee-sans if they're not blood related. They're just extermely close people.     Blood relation isn't important for nee-sans but it's important for imoutos  It's either one or the other fuckface, you can't have separate standards for both. Fucking hell this is why nee-san fags are scum.      I didn't realize that Sora wasn't allowed in imouto threads. To think, she's not an imouto even though she's constantly referred to as such.      blood relation is essential to the whole thing. I'm not sure you're actually have the same interests, maybe you just like older childhood friends, like you said.     Twin sister who walks the line. Her fierce loyalty is her best feature and if she works on her faults she would be perfect.     Her entire arc is about her working on her faults and overcoming the most egregious ones. Unfortunately the anime glossed over this.     So the biological relation is what makes the archtype? Here I thought character traits were far more important.    I DO have seperate standards for both what are you gonna do about it? And look at you taking the highground, you wouldn't resort to namecalling would you.   I'm honestly an ara ara kind of guy, thanks for not calling me a fuckface.          Character traits don't make someone a sister, it is blood.    NBR nee-sans are trash. You are giving all nee-san fags a bad name.    Nee-san fags already gave themselves a bad name since 90% of the nee-sans they post are NBR. This is why we should stop including them in our threads.    You realize that imouto and onee-san refer to sisters, right? Not just girls that are younger/older than you.     4,5,11   M-Muh duck!     I find 12 to be the hottest.    But character traits make the archtype.   I just venture into these threads because of the nee-san/christmas cake overlap. They represent traits I like.   They also refer to a set of character traits portrayed in most anime and manga.          But that's not what we're talking about here. Learn to context.        <br/>        I agree. It just looks so affectionate and lovely.   Either. ;_;   Kirino please go and don't bother the pthwr imoutos. Kyousuke is waiting for you in bed.     other  Fuck me, that came out wrong.       Fuck off, you contrarian faggot.   Wrong, you idiot. We talk about Sora because no one posts any other fucking imoutos until hours later and we're keeping an incest thread alive.        4chan must be why my sister doesn't want my dick   scapegoat yuri like a faggot when your life isn't even fucking anime and manga     becuz i sed so         I noticed the thread turned into shit right about two hours ago, the moment they start posting.     Yea it's my fault, not the people shitposting.      implying kirino doesn't shitpost while laying in Kyousuke's bed with her bare ass hanging out the bottom of his old shirt        God damn that is a lewd ass figure.     The root of the problem is probably the degree of how obnoxious the fanbase is in general. A lot of people are turned off the moment you enter, because we don't want to associate with you. We figured out how obnoxious you are to other characters in yns, and we see how obnoxious you are to other sisters, especially older sisters, so it's kind of natural to connect the dots.       am i cool yet?   No, you're a tryhard hipster faggot.        Oh sure, all shitposting is me and totally no one else.  I'm not going to pretend I am 100% innocent but you really don't have any actual proof that any of what you are saying was done by me.        obnoxious to other characters in YnS    obnoxious to other sisters, especially nee-sans   Not even a whiteknight. You're full of fucking shit.       You've either never been into an yns thread to see how much they shit on nao, or you're in denial, refusing to see how much they've shat up this thread.     blame the anon getting shitposted, not the shitposters      They can be secretly, but it has to come out at some point.     It's not easy to make out.  Even shitposts against could in reality be mere retaliation to how much you shitposted in the past and maybe even well deserved. I'm not one to judge that. All I know is there's history between the two factors.        While I will be the first one to say that Nao is 3rd best girl, you aren't exactly doing her any favors by whining about some people hating her.     People, not including me, hate Nao for raping Haru and having the most boring route.  As soon as that anon posted about Sora alone being an example of how good imoutos are contrarian faggots got obnoxious and you're not going to attack them instead? Bullshit.      Did you even read the idiot post I replied to?  Are you simply denying that post exist and that my post came up from thin air?     Onee-sama all day every day   best girl    Because karma What comes around goes around.  People react to you negatively because you've behaved negatively.        I completely agree with the guy you were responding to though, you are full of shit. For some reason you have a problem with me or one of the other 4 Sora posters (probably me since I post the most) and now you are trying to construe the silly contrarian shitposting that has been happening since day one on 4chan, long before I ever started posting Sora mind you, as some kind of "karma" because I...post Sora which in your mind is some kind of unforgivable crime.      how much you shitposted in the past   First of all, faggot, I'm not either of those handful of Sora loving anons. In every thread I've seen them in I have never seen them doing anything but either post a little carelessly or properly defend her while posting plenty of images and occasionally amusing comments.     <br/>   Well, once you are ready to accept reality, you can come back to my post that explains where you went wrong.  The first step involves you to start behaving and stop throwing shit against other characters.      I should have realized eventually people were going to start more commonly being contrarian faggots even about a harmless girl and imouto like Sora with a civil enough fanbase.  I hope /v/ isn't leaking.       stop throwing shit against other characters   How about stop pulling shit out your ass and post some archive links if you feel so sure?      Your fanbase isn't civil Anon. Back when you had yns thread, it was full of shit slinging even back then.     I officially think this guy is a master baiter  heh   fucking hell I'm 27 and that can make me giggle  and he has effectively strung us along.  I shall stop responding or just go "K" to him like I do everyone else that's baiting, I suggest you do the same but hell that's up to you maybe you find his delusions fun.       You are anonymous. You don't have to defend your personal reputation because you don't have one. By trying to do so you are only shitting up the thread even more.    not even 300 posts   Merely a diversion.      Yea I've already come to that conclusion in      be onii-san   imouto is over 10 years younger   never see her as anything but a little kid       defending themselves is shitting up the thread   not the faggots making baseless claims       That simply means you will be more susceptible if you ever notice her womanly charms.     It was leaking for a while, I think. I remember sauce? posts in almost every fucking thread. Good thing that crap isn't all that welcome here.     You should do fun things with her.     Defending myself or whatever won't change the simpletons mind and all it does is give him more posts to air his madness and fewer posts dedicated to imoutos and the 3 BR nee-sans that actually exist.     Any idea what Meleefaggots do on /a/? I want more reasons to hate them.  Or do they just bitch about how the latest anime isn't the exact same as their favorite in the same genre regardless of its own merits?       dat webm     Same. Mine's cute though so it's okay. So long as she doesn't end up a bitch when she hits puberty, she'll be alright.   How many imoutos do you see here?  Has TLR taken any more steps towards the harem plan or was it just a shitty ruse after all?  I'm so sick of fake harems.      1 is the imouto of the MC, the other is the imouto of another character, the other two are boring.      Is this a trick question?  Three seems about right.       3 and one bitch that needs to die. Can you guess who is the bitch?     No, it's foreshadowing Miyu's brother is GOAT onii-chan     why do i live     So long as she doesn't end up a bitch when she hits puberty, she'll be alright.   Implying any girl doesn't become a bitch at that age.  I prey for you.       No one has translated this yet       You all missed best imouto.       NBR   not even inseki   WCW shit <br/>       No I mentioned her, she was in the boring category.      The two big girls looks so stupid, yet I can't stop wanting to fuck them.  I realise this would make imouto sad if I actually did this. I can only hope she grows up soon enough before the other two meat demons tempt me too much.      Who is the manliest aniki?   The sleepy aniki.    Kamina    Imouto.   I don't either so I like both, call me a tasteless faggot because I want everything.   *don't have      I think it's cute when brother and sister can't help but to have sex all the time.    But her ass isn't eve showing!    Isn't the Imouto a slut and the Onii-chan a faggot in that show?   My imouto used to be a precious one! Then boys and drugs entered her life. I want to rip the boys apart.    Thinking Len &amp; Rin are siblings    Onee-san i don't want to spoil someone, i want to be spoiled.   To be honest I wouldn't. I'd fuck a slightly older woman who plays that role however, that's the appeal for me.   As long as its Mikan not Kirino, im happy.  i want a suteki onee chan with a mio kind of personality  and then when she gets scared of lightning or something like that, i hear a knock on my door and she wants to climb into my bed  sho ga nai nee, nee chan        Onee-chans, of course.  They can step on you and berate you and you can't hit them back.       I'll never understand wanting to be dominated.    I'll never understand not wanting to be dominated.    Sounds like a beta thing, wanting to be controlled and abused.    Onee-chan x imouto    But those can't breed and impregnate.  It's better when it's brother and sister, two puzzle pieces who first each other.      checked    At least there a manga    I'm sure some yurifag would call you out on that.    Those people doesn't belong to /a/ though    Damn, I want that but options are either:  opened, "stained" on Mandarake   440GBP on Amazon       These two should just have sex already. They fit so well together. Like a T being inserted into a U.  I wouldn't fault anyone for wanting Mikan, no one would fault him for that.     &lt;-    stained  How stained is stained? Like somebody's cum made her shirt crusty stained?    You shouldn't really discard either. Lots of interesting combinations can be made from both older and younger.  Tsukihi is younger, but she's this sage at the same time. Albeit a bit inexperienced, she always has interesting advice, and fun to talk to and joke around with.  An older sister version would unlock her the super wise sage mode. I'd like to see something like this too actually.         Shit with a random whore.      Go away with your nbr.     It's always amazing when you can conquer an older girl in my opinion.  Since it's difficult as hell, the starts need to align, but it's so awesome when it happens.        These are completely irrelevant to this thread and serve as further proof of nee-san fags being plebs with no standards.     I feel sorry for True Oneesanfags that have to share a title with pretenders.    I think it's okay though. Sometimes when you're single child, you would need to settle for what you can get.  I don't mind adoptive older sisters.      Was it rape?    Starts fingering her   He's just pretending to be asleep, right?     There's a lot of hearts so I doubt it.  She's attacking him aggressively, but he can attack back at her weak part, with his penis, repeatedly.      He was clearly cowering in that tiny panel    Pretty much.  In the latest TLRD chapters, we actually had a title called "First accident", the first time something happened accidentally.  That means for all these years, Rito had been groping the girls very specifically and with intent, while pretending otherwise.          that pose  Gets me everytime     But why is she so peefect, /a/?     Perfect  I'm obviously not perfect like her.    Imouto for life   So all those "accidents" I see sometimes aren't accidents but him groping girls and getting away with it? What a louse.   Imouto, especially those with twintails and a touch of tsun.    yuri incest   It's shit. Keep them separate or you ruin both flavors, idiot.   It's better because brother and sister is just that fucking good while sistercest needs twins just to not be shit.         I can't really agree with you there.  Older sister and younger sister is better than same age any day. It's also more rare to succeed, because the older sibling is constantly tempted by other peers at its age and ever older peers. And this tempting will constantly happen over a long time before the younger sibling matures enough to be attractive to the older sibling.  That's why I think it's more miraculous when they succeed.         Okaa -chan    My issue is with the multiple taboos. It comes off less as romance and more tryhard in general.    It sucks more being in the middle with 9 sisters     tfw my sister became a super-bitch at puberty but then chilled out tremendously a few years later as if to apologize and now we're best bros   and she lets me see her in panties sometimes     I think there is also something very pure and romantic about older sister loving her little brother.  If she accepts him as her man even though he is still small and can't fully penetrate her yet, it requires something else, more extraordinary in their relationship.      Pretty much the exact same for me. She turned emo (literally) in middle school, but when she got older she stopped being edgy, and now we talk about comics and play video games and shit.   haven't seen her in panties, but basically everything else at this point        Fuck your sister already.      It always surprise me, /a/sisters seems to be the best girl of the bunch. They can be unbearably bitchy at times, but they're also bros and pure sex.    I'm trying         Good luck    All in good time.   Probably because everyone else decides they permanently hate their sisters the moment they enter the bitchy puberty phase.       This image always gets me.  the aroused face of the imouto   pantsu dangling from her left feet   pack of condoms on the pillow   wet spots from love juice on the sheets          Good luck  We already life partners anyway    Probably because everyone else decides they permanently hate their sisters the moment they enter the bitchy puberty phase.  And as said after that, their adult form is better because they're boner-inducing best bros.          I don't know if she wants it.   On any given day, she'll go from hanging out in my room in a t-shirt and pantsu or chilling on the couch with her feet practically on my penis, to randomly starting discussions about how some Swedish guy/Egyptian king/Game of Thrones character fucked their sister and how "That's totally disgusting." I don't know which hint I should be taking.        /a/     Looking back my Imouto dropped hints all the time that I only noticed after she become an angry SJW tumblrite. Proceed at your own discretion.    Imouto is the only way to wincest.    correct her with the D.         I don't know if she wants it.  Mah nigga      My relationship with my older sister is more or less like the one in that image. People with shitty family relations need to stop projecting.    tfw no imouto to pamper and spoil.   tfw you'll never have an imouto that'll cling to you   tfw you'll never get overprotective over your imouto    On the bright side I get money from time to time from my onee-sans and one of them is loli-sized        That is one puffy vulva     People with shitty family relations need to stop projecting.  It's just a matter of timing, really. At the very least, as a brother people has to stop being human thrash so the sisters wouldn't be ashamed.     Anyone got the sauce on this?    It is literally written on the page   Nee-san. Everyone who disagrees with me is a terrorist.   Searching it brings some shitty video of two people fucking and yahoo answers with people saying they want to fuck their sisters     All that NBR\   This is what we get for inviting you guys.       caring about NBR  amifitting in yet XD     you could've tried searching exh using the name that's literally on the page.    Kill yourself.     amidifferent yet    I feel like there's not enough usage of 'Aneki'. Why?   Imouto vulva is always the puffiest.   Onee-chan  Glad, my imouto never touchs tumblr.   It's a mind poison that females seem highly susceptible to.    Saying no to a Miyuki Sawashiro Onee-chan   <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435102926569.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143510292656<wbr>9.webm</wbr></a>   Did this character have any purpose other than being typical evil fujobait? I just finished it and he made no sense at all despite all the wasted screentime. He didn't even contribute to anything as everything he did was a waste.  He was the most popular character.  Show was literally about Slaine.   The show was literally about him. Are you fucking stupid?   The story was about Slaine.  he was a plot device and also so heavily plotarmored nothing remotely bad happened to him for slaughtering people. feelgood ending.  this points to him being the main character.    You can change Ass with a talking shit, and nothing of value would be lost. She's a great plot device in that retrospect.   You can stop trying anon, nothing will change the amount of love he gets    That's a picture of Slaine, the one you're talking about is Inaho. Don't mix them.   I was never convinced that Slain was a bad guy. The development was awful.  He could have been a good character, but they decided to just make him a really shitty Char clone.   Well I doubt he went to jail for being too good    Eh, the whole plot of S2 was pointless. The show should have ended with Inaho just killing Saazbaum as a generic monster of the week and war ending. Slaine really did do nothing worthwhile.     I'm not trying to justify his actions, he clearly massacred a lot of people. It's just his decent to 'villain hood' was weak and unconvincing.     As shit as Eggboy was, at least everything he did wasn't pointless and stupid    Typical landwhale    He got some sort of character arc in S2, but it was really sterile and dull. You could remove it completely and literally nothing would change.    The director(?) basically stated the the whole purpose of the show was to break Slaine down to nothing, a.k.a reset to "Zero"  So no, he doesn't.      He was a shittily written character who had potential  Like everything else about the show    Saekano volume 8 is out. I'll be posting summaries and dumping pics. This is my first time doing a summary, so I wasn't really sure what was fine to omit and wasn't, so if you have any questions or anything to add, please do so.  I look forward to the return of our goddess.  First for best girl! The post before me doesn't count!      Eririfags desperate as always.   Just post everything you want to summary   So, Ak-kun   ...yeah   It's research, Aki-kun.    Research, huh. I guess we can't do much about it.    Yeah, we can't.   ...Don't let go.   As long as Aki-kun grips on tight, we'll be fine.           Forgot pic.      can't do much about it.   *it can't be helped     Thanks for doing a summary. I look forward to seeing what this volume is about.       Prologue   The novel starts with Tomoya, Michiru, and Izumi gathered in his room to celebrate the creation of their new circle. Michiru questions Tomoya on the state of the circle now that Eriri and Utaha have left. Tomoya doesn’t take being reminded of the two leaving very well, but Izumi reassures Tomoya by saying that she won’t let the circle die. The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her. Tomoya panics and tells her to stop making her character develop like that. Michiru comments that nothing could have been done about the two leaving. When Tomoya asks why, she responds by saying that the two had lost the fight for survival within the circle. At that moment, Megumi enters with the drinks, right when Michiru explains that Megumi had kicked the two out of the circle, using an analogy of someone’s wife delivering punishment. Megumi is displeased and tells them to stop making her seem like someone so mean, but everyone is visibly scared of her. They move on with the party. Megumi encourages Tomoya to do the toast. The prologue ends with everyone shouting kanpai.     Chapter 1   Tomoya is talking with his classmate Yoshihiko in the classroom. When he asks why Tomoya hasn’t updated his blog in a while, Tomoya says that he’s busy. Eriri comes over, greets them, and sits down. Yoshihiko tries to ask Tomoya if there is really nothing between him and Eriri, but he dodges the questions. Tomoya reminisces about how rumors had started after he and Eriri started regularly going to school together after winter comiket. He also comments how more rumors started when they seemed more distant to each other after spring break. Tomoya’s phone rings, and it turns out that Eriri had just messaged him about how his new game is coming along. He responds that things are going well, but Eriri doesn’t like his tone. She questions if he’s still holding a grudge. The conversation gets heated to the point where Eriri stops texting and just asks him out loud what was up with what happened between him and Utaha at the train station. There’s a bit of an awkward silence. After class, Eriri apologizes to Tomoya. Izumi shows up in the classroom with two of her classmates who want to join the circle. Eriri is against them joining, saying that amateurs and non-otaku shouldn’t join. Izumi counters by saying that Tomoya was an amateur at first too, and the two classmates reveal that they watch anime too. Eriri can’t think of anything else to say, so she storms out of the classroom while Tomoya takes the two classmates away to explain the circle. She meets Megumi as she exits. They have an awkward greeting and soon go their separate ways.        Yoshihiko   I miss that guy      Chapter 2   Tomoya meets Utaha as he leaves the school. She has him accompany her to a café. They talk about college, which Utaha says that she hasn’t gone to since it’s just orientation, and about the two classmates, who Utaha guesses didn’t join because Tomoya was overenthusiastic and scared them away. She turns out to be right on that one, and Tomoya. Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside. Tomoya asks her not to joke about that because he’s been worrying about that too. Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react. She considers calling her on the phone right there, but Tomoya stops her exclaiming that it’s rude to call people in the middle of conversation. Next, Tomoya asks how Utaha’s work is coming along with Field’s Chronicle. She responds, “How should I answer? If I said that now was the most fulfilling part of my life in the passionate way you always speak, what would you do?” Tomoya says that he would wait in line in excitement for the game, which Utaha compares to NTR. They leave the café and talk as they walk while holding hands. Utaha encourages him to work hard for his circle, to which Tomoya replies that he’ll do his best and that one day they should gather together to discuss how their work is coming along.   (There were a lot of dirty jokes this chapter, and Tomoya notices that Utaha has been making more than usual, but some have been omitted because it would be way too long otherwise)     Were you somehow inspired by Spyro?    Chapter 3    Tomoya and Megumi are planning the schedule for the circle. Megumi is worried that the schedule might be too hard, but Tomoya reassures her that they have last year’s experience. She replies with how they had scheduling troubles even with Utaha and that artist by their side. Tomoya asks her why she properly referred to Utaha by name but not Eriri. Megumi is silent for a while before replying that it was just a mistake. Tomoya replies that there’s no way that’s the case because when she’s quiet like that for more than five seconds she’s scary. She explains that she never understood why Eriri quit the circle. Tomoya answers that doing so is probably just in a creator’s nature, though even he admits to not understanding what exactly that is. Their conversation is interrupted by Michiru, who turns out to have been there for a while and was just ignored. Megumi decides to go on a break while Michiru talks to Tomoya about how she wants him to set up more concerts and help make a CD. She pushes him down on the bed and begs him to help, but Megumi walks in on them. The scene shifts to them discussing who does what in the circle. Tomoya has too many roles and needs to quit some of them. Midway through discussing, Megumi falls asleep from exhaustion. When she wakes up, Michiru and Tomoya are playing a visual novel, with Michiru begging him to stop. The game turned out to be really awful. Michiru falls asleep on the bed while Megumi takes her turn at the game. Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.     Chapter 4   Tomoya goes over to Izumi’s house. He has her look at the plans for the game and asks for her opinion. Instead of answering, Izumi asks him to leave her room. He goes to the living room where he has Iori look over the plans. Iori comments that it puts a lot of pressure on the artist since she has to match up to Eriri but also remarks that that’s probably not the reason Izumi had Tomoya leave. Izumi calls Tomoya back to her room to show her sketches of Meguri that she had drawn based off the plans. There were three sketches, one in Eriri’s style, one in her own style, and one that looked like Megumi. Tomoya also notices that scattered all around the room are other sketches of Meguri, with varying hairstyles and expressions, and thinks that these are all a hundred percent Meguri. Tomoya asks her if she’ll do the drawings, but she’s confused since she thought the whole point of the meeting was to fix the character design. Later, as Iori accompanies Tomoya to the station, he advises Tomoya to finish the sub-heroines first since he’d lose all motivation to write after finishing the main heroine.     Chapter 5   Eriri calls Tomoya on Skype asking if Megumi is in the room. He answers no and asks if she still hasn’t made up with Megumi yet. Seeing that she hasn’t, he recommends that she do it soon. Eriri asks him for help, but he refuses, saying that Megumi is scary when she’s angry. He tells her to face Megumi and talk to her seriously by herself. Their Skype conversation moves to Eriri venting about her coworkers and how hard her work is to Tomoya. When the conversation shifts to Tomoya talking about how good Izumi’s character design was, Eriri isn’t very enthusiastic. Tomoya asks if she’s still scared of Izumi, she says that you don’t suddenly grow just because you become a pro. Tomoya reassures her by saying that she’s grown a lot the past few months. That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.      Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside.   Oh man, her dark vindictive side is still there.      For a moment there I read Saikano. Then I remmebered Saikano. Then I got depressed.      Chapter 6   Tomoya and Megumi meet Iori at the café and have him look at the revised plan for the game since Tomoya wants him to be the manager of the circle. After looking at the plan, Iori refuses, saying that it won’t sell. When Tomoya asks him what he should do to fix that, Iori responds by saying that he has no idea. Megumi interrupts the conversation and says that what Iori is doing isn’t fair because he hasn’t given a reason why it won’t sell. Tomoya says that it’s fine and that they’ll go back and fix the plan. After setting up what day to meet with him again, Tomoya leaves, but Iori comments that Megumi is heavy. It turns out that she had fallen asleep.     Chapter 7   Tomoya and Megumi are having dinner at his house. Megumi has some doubts about whether they can trust Iori on this one, but Tomoya reassures her that when it comes to knowing whether or not something will sell, he is no match for him. They move on to fixing the plan. Several hours pass. Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience. Tomoya claims no recollection for something like that. They keep working until two at night, but they still haven’t found anything wrong. They decide to go to sleep for the day. After waking up and eating breakfast, they continue to work but still have no idea. Megumi comments that all the heroines are done so well that it’s impossible to even tell who the main one is anymore which causes Tomoya to realize what’s wrong with the plan.     Chapter 8   Tomoya and Megumi are at the café with Iori. He congratulates them on realizing what was wrong and agrees to be the manager. Once everything is over, both pass out from exhaustion in the café. Later, Tomoya tells Megumi that they should go on a date to gather data for the Meguri route. Megumi suggests going to an amusement park, but Tomoya says no, the reason being that he had already been there for research for the previous game (in his mind, he adds that he went with Eriri). Eventually they settle for Rokutenba Mall. Like the previous time, they plan out what shops they are going to go to first. After shopping a bit, they get to the part with the escalator and the crowd. Just like last time, they hold hands to get through it. They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories. She offers buying chains, a leather jacket, and nose piercings for an image change instead, to which Tomoya responds, “What kind of boyfriend are you trying to raise, main heroine!?” The scene switches to them at the food court. Megumi tells Tomoya about the time she met Eriri at the mall and how it sparked their friendship. Her face turns sad as she remembers how their friendship was broken. Seeing that, Tomoya asks if he should set the two up so that they could rebuild their friendship. Megumi responds by saying that it would be wrong to request that of Tomoya, but if Eriri is okay with it, then she’ll do it. Two hours pass, and they’re walking back home. Megumi decides to play the main heroine again and asks him to turn on the recorder.   (I’ll just translate the rest of the chapter and put it along the picture)     Rest of chapter 8   “I guess I’ll play the main heroine one last time.”   “Katou…?”   Just as were about to reach the top of the hill…   “Just for now, can you turn off the recorder?”   “Huh, why?”   After giving that strange request, she ran past me with a light dash and gazed back at me with a warm look, although, in truth, the evening sun made it so that I couldn’t really tell what expression she had.    “Hey, Aki-kun…no, Tomoya-kun.”   Even so, that voice and those words were enough to put that image in my mind.    “Do you remember? It’s been exactly a year since then.”   “Katou…”   Of course I remember. That was when I was fruitlessly racking my brain for ideas on the plot.    “Am I closer to the heroine of your story than I was a year ago?”   Back then, Katou was supposed to be at Hokkaido, but, unable to just stand by and watch me struggle, she prioritized me over her family and came back.    “Am I someone dependable?”   You were already someone dependable.    “And do you remember what happened about a month ago?”   “Hey, wait…”   Well…even if I wanted to forget, I couldn’t. After all, I was sobbing my eyes out right in front of Katou.    “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.                            everyone is scared of Megumi   I like the smell of drama in the making.     “As long as Katou…”   Today, Katou really was just like a jack-in-the box. She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome…   “…as long as Megumi is here, I feel like we’ll make it through, somehow.”   …and to top it all off, someone I could always rely on.    “So let’s make sure to have a great time. Let’s cough up blood together.”   It was a good thing the recorder was stopped. I don’t think I could hear such embarrassing lines again.    “Let’s give our best together, Tomoya-kun.”   “Uhh…”   “Together, with everyone else, we’ll make the best game ever, right?”   “Uhh…!”   Why did I stop the recorder? I’m an idiot.             I love you OP.   Iori actually asked if Megumi was depressed and hearing that, Megumi's eyes turned lifeless.    Epilogue   #1 Eriri and Tomoya are on skype. She is shocked that Iori joined the circle. After a few exchanges on how surprising that is, the conversation moves to Eriri being overworked. She complains how they pile one character after another. A bit later, Tomoya tells Eriri that she’ll have her meet Megumi sometime next week. As the conversation ends, he remarks to himself that he has to do something about his habit of calling Megumi by her first name since he nearly let it slip several times talking to Eriri.   #2 Tomoya and Utaha are on the phone. He tells her that the circle will be watching the livestream of the game she and Eriri are working on. Hearing that, Utaha tells him that the Eriri now is not the one he knew before and that he should try not to make enemies with her. She also says that she wants him, Izumi, and Megumi to accept Eriri as she is now.  #3 The circle watches the livestream. After flashing the characters of the game, it turns out that all the pictures shown in the preview come together to form one giant picture. Everyone in the circle is shocked to see such a great picture from Eriri. Izumi is visibly scared to compete with someone like that, and Megumi slips back to calling Tomoya “Aki-kun.” Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.      not a single illustration of Utaha, not even in the cover or inlays  LELOUCH BTFO    Lelouch isn't even aware this is based on a LN.   OP you are da real MVP    Okay, thanks. I thought he was literally calling her heavy.      What are you smoking?     Megumi best girl. Tomoya agrees, don't bother him about it.     Caring about Lelouch   Unable to read  I can't tell which one makes you more retarded.     Will Tomoya be able to reverse this yandere in the making before it's too late?   Afterword:   Nothing really important beyond Maruto himself being surprised at how much screentime Megumi had this volume and dispelling rumors that Saekano was a split cour from the start (it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations).    That's all. Thanks everyone for reading my shitty prose and summaries that have probably left out one too many things.      Really really thank you, OP.     I know that he's the Yahariguy, but I don't visit the threads enough to see him.      Every volume needs tons of Megumi screen time.    How many volumes where adapted in the anime?    You know, the real bad thing that happened to Utaha was how irrelevant she became. Volume 8 highlighted it by making pretty every other line of hers a dirty joke because that's all she's good for at this point.     I never lost faith. Eriri is still the best.    That was the decision Utaha made in GS anyway.    Thank you for the summary, bro.   it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations   The series was literally blessed by a goddess.        For a moment I thought I was reading a translation of the chinks' summary for some reason.     tfw Izumi is more relevant than her now    Thanks, OP. You're alright.    The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her.    Tomoya will have to deal with two yanderes in the circle.     So yeah, if it wasn't obvious enough before, we're totally stuck on the Megumi route now. They're like a married couple at this point, they just need to realize it.   That's what Maruto promised.    The worst thing happened this volume to be honest. Megumi is still good but nowhere nearly as interesting as she was before.   Thanks OP. though I'm disappointed how MC just shrugged off the betrayal of those two bitches. At least be mad!  Maruto creates good plot and stories but crappy MCs. Tomoya is much worse than the WA2 MC.     The others never really stood a chance.     I dunno, I don't think she's changed so much as we're just seeing sides of her that we didn't before. Nothing before Volume 6 really made her mad, and there were the other heroines who took screentime away from her.      He's still a bit mad, at least to Eriri. He admits to still holding a grudge at the end of Chapter 5. The outburst in the classroom also made it pretty clear.     Why is the author surprised that megumi has a lot of screentime in this volume? Didn't he intended it to be this way?   Megumi is like spending days at his house at a time now      One and only.       He didn't.     I think it's like you don't realize the impact of something until you reread it.      She's the rival now. That means she'll be crushed someday.     Which actually made her really boring for me.    Thank god. MC is more human.   What does utaha mean that she was tomoya's first?    Kiss. Tomoya and Megumi are going to have a romantic moment, she'll ask if she's her first, Tomoya will awkwardly say no, and the mood will be ruined.     It feels that the author made her the winner way too early. However this is Maruto we're talking about, and probably this won't last much.   I'm fine with any development as long as Eriri doesn't take her place again.        Eriri got insanely close in volume 6. If it wasn't for her own stupidity, she would have won.     What volume and chapter did that happen?    Tomoya just says he and Eriri have gone back to their old ways.     Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.  What the fuck has happened to Tomoya?     She'll losr because she isn't the destined main girl. But it doesn't mean one can't enjoy her shining brightly regardless.     Volume 7, epilogue. It's been spoiled in pretty much every thread since Saekano first aired.     It's just a game m8.     Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience.   So Tomoya completely forgot that he ditched Megumi?        receive special treatment from MC   mend damaged relationship after years of being on bad terms   a volume later, shoot yourself in the foot and return back to square one again   Bravo Eriri, bravo.        Wait, why is any girl besides Utaha expected to win if she's both kissed the MC and is holding hands with him?  Eriri won. Utah went to college somewhere Kato is pissed at aki.  Basically sums up the ending here, boys       Poor Utaha is just grasping at straws at this point.     Her response was something like "...oh it's nothing, it must just be my imagination" but it was implied that she was a bit angry given the sarcastic tone.      Megumi is regularly staying the night at his house and makes him dinner.      They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories.     The only thing Eriri will win is a consolation prize.    Yes, but their relationship seems very platonic    Showing Megumi's dark tendencies is like the point of vol 8.    Eriri will always be the best friend/staff Utaha will be always the idolized author nothing else. Itoko will always be Itoko Kouhai will always be the kouhai.  Megumi will always be the heroine.   Simple as that. Your generic tsundere will never win.          has any1 played the psvita game?    platonic   This entire volume is literally the beginning of a yandere possessive Megumi      Until I see a knife smeared with blood being held by megumi, I refuse to believe she's a yandere    It's shit.     It's quite funny, her dark side was initially blamed on her long hair, but she feels even more fearsome with short hair.      Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her     did they start going out ? I dont remember that    "It can't be helped since unlike VNs, LNs can only have one ending." - Maruto   So in white album 2 terms  Tomoya = Haruki Megumi = Ogiso Eriri = Kazusa  who won again there?         Not like she has any chance anyway.    VN =/= LN     No, the hand holding is just fanservice to please Utahafags who don't want to admit that their character is irrelevant now.     Maruto said he won't let another Setsuna happen so Megumi is pretty guaranteed to win.    Then what's this    Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react      Why is everyone so scared of Megumi again?  Really the only characters that make sense to feel that way are Tomoya and Eriri.      My memory of White Album 2 is rusty, what does another Setsuna mean again?     That's mostly because she's depressed.     “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.   How can anyone think Megumi won't be the winner?           This is understandable. Maruto made Setsuna so unique and I guess he always thought of making her the winner. But the fans preferred Kazusa. It's like aquaplus forced him/her to make Kazusa the winner.    Is ponytail safe?     It was explained already, it just means kiss. It was part of the dirty joke since she said it out loud in the cafe.     Rinri-kun, have you seen Sawamura-san like this?  Have you ever seen her burning her life and enjoying drawing like this? You have probably never seen it... Because, had you known that she could be like this, Then you wouldn't have such insolent thoughts as to 'protect her'.   Ahh, really, what a waste.  And, I'm really glad. If you had seen her right now, You will surely fall in love with her again, and know the despair of not being able to reach her with that love.  Utaha's monologue in GS suggested Tomoya would fall for Eriri again after seeing her art. What happened?              It takes an Eririfag in denial to believe that.    There's a difference between ideal heroine and someone you actually want to be with.    Utaha will always be the teasing perverted character with the hot body and nothing else.  She was doomed from the start.    Jokes on you, Maruto intended Megumi as his redemption on Setsuna. It reflected on Tomoya's words in vol 2    Izumi so good, good thing she is my second favorite    He didn't see it at that precise moment.    I think the visually scared part is a gag scene    Anon, your analogy is really really bad. You compare romance drama and romance harem.     Tomoya is scared because of what happened at the auditorium in volume 7. As for everyone else, I think it's the aura she projects. Like, there's a scary silence.      What happened?  Eriri happened. I don't think I've ever seen another heroine as incompetent as Eriri.     Holy fuck I screwed up the green text so much    That's where she realized it's not about improving her art/skills after all. Even if she wanted to go back. The damage has already been done.     I don't see why Megumi can't be both.    basically a heroine that suffered endlessly in basically all routes, even the routes where she wins she suffers the most    why? Both were works of the same author and we are obviously going on the same route. Betrayal, ruining friendships and etc.    Best girl man    Both heroines won. It just that, narratively Kazusa end is more prominent in presence.   Utah's is the most genuine. All other girls are manipulative and fake.   the person in the middle here is setsuna     Both heroines won.  Yeah, no.    Is Megume slowly becoming Yandere or something?  Everyone is "scared of her"   Megumis "dark side"   That manipulative tone   Are all these things just things that are hard to translate and therefore something gets lost in the translation or is she going to kill Utaha, Eiri, Izumi and Michiru at the end of the LN?        wow this + handholding, and people say Utaha is non-existent now ?    Yeah I feel like she's the one far ahead of the other girls.    it's her character, anon-kun. those types never wins in a harem plot like this. It's always the long haired tsundere with no tits that always wins.     She realized after that. Even referencing Kazusa coming back in CC. It is all about improving her skill though.    What is Monogatari? Utaha is basically discount Senjougahara.    I don't think Maruto is boring enough of a writer to go for another WA2.    It was pretty bad, man. Setsuna never achieved her true happiness. Even in her "good" ending.  Worse, another girl will share the same fate as hers in another series.       It's more like she's someone you don't want to piss off. As long as you don't do something stupid, she's a perfectly nice girl.     was rooting for her until betrayal, now yandere the best.    Except she's the most mature one. Those never wins. She's the staple foxy mature girl.     She's 腹黑, a trait that would normally be associated with characters like Utaha, but not really ヤンデレ.    Don't reply to Yahari memecartel   I still can't figure out why /a/ likes Saekano.  When I watched it all it was was flagrant otaku pandering and fanservice. Not very interesting at all.     She gets pissed off quite easily now though.    Utaha reminds me a lot of yukinon from yahari and senj from monogatri. I think they are all considered kuuderes. Probably one of my favourite character type     /a/ is one person   Try mentioning saekano in a thread outside of this one      You mean eriri?   But that's his style. And it's heading that route.      Its going to be really hard to ever top Setsuna in the suffering heroine department.  Wataru is trying, but I doubt he would go as far as the CC Touma normal/true routes     Man I like how Tomoya is rather cool at handling Eriri and Utaha. It really shows that while he understands them he still has some troubles with them leaving the circle.   The anime adapted the worst parts of the novels so yeah.    Except that WA2 MC had loved Touma all the way through    Yeah no Maruto has done more things than just WA2 man.     She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome  MCs own words.     5 volumes where every scene is essential to the plot to a 12 episode anime is never a great idea.     You'll just get a bunch of "Megumi a best." It's all Saekano is known for. She really is the star of the show.      You know a show is bad when a girl like Megumi, whose main selling point is that she has no redeeming qualities, is the best.     Tomoya LOVED Eriri.    4 volumes actually and they weren't that good either.     it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations  And we all know who to thank for that.      Yeah, WA2 is an exception than a rule.     Sounds like he thinks if her as a friend, rather than romantically.     main selling point is that she has no redeeming qualities   I think you completely misunderstood this series.      They skipped Eriri's introduciton to Megumi and just introduced Utah and Eriri all together in the cafe.     Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.   Catfight incoming?      She'll lose because she is a retard.    You don't get it. He never got over his love for Touma, but Tomoya has got over his love for Eriri    The otakufags who buy this shit?    Yeah it will probably be a major plot point from now on. How well or bad it goes down will seal Megumi and Eriri's fate.    Megumi X Eriri end confirmed    It's     You talking about me?     I think they did a great job adapting though. It didn't feel rushed or anything. Maruto has talent in anime, WA2 and Saekano are amazing.     Eririfags.    She's more than a friend to him though.     I still can't figure out why /a/ likes Saekano     Thank you for the summary. And well as an Utahafag there wasn't that much for me, but I still like it I hope Izumi beats eriri, as she is my second favorite      That's not the point.    This is gonna be some forced drama if it doesn't get resolved next volume.   Tomoya already said he set up a time for Megumi and Eriri to meet next week       Am I supposed to find these girls attractive?   Because I don't.       Saekano anime is not good at all.    Point is he loved Eriri like Haruki loves Kazusa. Which makes Eriri = Kazusa and Megumi = Ogiso. But Maruto said he won't let another Setsuna happen again. You do the math. But this is just my opinion.       A stubborn retard at that.    Have some ninjas then.    Saekano threads really could do without the whole WA2 thing.    You only have your own homosexuality to blame.     The anime could use better designs, but the LN is absolutely gorgeous.     It was not rushed but like the yahari anime only the important plots are included. The introdutions became flashbacks so much it was irritating.     It used to be   Saekano? You mean the guy who did White Album 2?   Now it's   White Album 2? You mean the guy who did Saekano?   Oh how the tables have changed.             At least the comparison makes sense here. Yahari threads can get aggravating with WA2.     not finding this attractive  That sounds like a personal problem to me anon, you might need to do some serious soul searching.     do you expect me to be able to read these kanji you nerd.    Still waiting on Taiyou no Ko.     I don't find Megumi attractive because I think Eriri is better.  That doesn't make me a homosexual.     Absolutely.   I wonder when Tomoya will find it strange that Megumi is at his house and making them dinner all the time   You may not be gay, but your shit taste still remains intact.     I don't find Megumi attractive because I think Eriri is better     He already does.    Welcome aboard brother!    Based Kurehito.     finding Eriri more attractive than Megumi  Preferences are preferences and all that, but I'm still kind of confused. Since you seem like one of the less toxic Eririfags mind explaining what exacltly makes her so attractive to you?  Personally I thought her design and personality somewhat generic, but that might just me getting really tired of the twin-tailed blond tsundere archetype.       As in typical MC's denseness or he finds it uncomfortable?     DFC twintails is a superior combination, tsundere notwithstanding.     He's probably like "This would be a flag event with any other girl"    and that's why she needs to lose, she had her chance she blew it now just waiting to see her suffer more    That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.  I thought Eriri was a professional now? How can she still be making shit comments like these?      She's still immature. Also read GS.     Eriri said it herself. You don't suddenly grow just because you're a pro.     manga spin-off ?     LN side story. Have fun.     Vol 7.5 really. Eriri went to Akane to improve her skills so she could keep her promise (draw better than everyone else) to Tomoya.    It pisses me off more how she was trying to stop Izumi's friends from joining Tomoya's circle. She's not even a member anymore and she should feel ashamed of forcing her shit views on things unrelated to her.    Having amateurs join the circle now is not a very good idea.    Not to mention that this leaves no room for the pathetic "baaawwww my girl should have won" bitching and moaning I see in every series where a girl like Eriri loses.    Implying Eriri was concerned about the circle.    That's not the point. She gets mad and storms out of the room.    Wait, are they going out? When did the started?    Nekofags can keep crying.    Nope and never. Read the whole thing before posting.     She gets mad and storms out of the room  Sums up her character pretty well.      You must be terrible at interacting with girls.     There was a girl who would always link arms with me while walking. I confessed to her.  Never again.      Kannafags, Minamifags, Sanafags, Zessicafags, Noefags and soon  Misakafags  too.    She was more concerned about the girls in her own way. She and Tomoya were both surprised to learn that the two girls openly admit they are otaku as well.   Izumi put her on the spot really. Tomoya was actually happy that he's seeing Eriri acting more honest though. But whatever, the summary is biased anyway.       Don't forget Yuifags.    It's more about who's saying those words. She abandoned the circle and still feels entitled to it in some way despite all the trouble she caused.    So tell me something, they replaced blessing software's artist?  How will that come across in the anime? Because Eriri's art was done by the novel artist, right? So they'll have to find someone else to do this new girl's drawings?       Eririfag   T-the summary was biased guys   Nah dude, she's just a shit       The anime probably won't get past volume 7. It's the perfect place to end it anyway.     the summary is biased anyway  0/10 Eririfags confirmed for coming from the bizarro dimension     Irohafags   I hope Megumi and Tomoya calling each other by their first names isn't a one time thing   That's why she asked Izumi if she would really drag her friends into this mess.     Considering how consistent the sales have been, I think they seriously might do more than a season 2.      the summary was biased   basing his evidence on the "biased" summary  Confirmation bias at its finest, I expected no less from Eririfags.      Season 2 up to Volume 7 with Volume 8 released as an OVA bundled with the BDs.  Make it happen Japan.      You know you might as well get yourself a trip denialfag. You do a pretty shit job of making yourself none recognizable.   I guess your retardation is just that pungent.    I was pretty surprised how well it did to be honest. Not that I'm complaining, but Saekano wasn't exactly all that mind blowing in my opinion.         I hope they call their first names in front of Eriri next volume.    I'd be more interested than a season 3 at that point. Volume 8 is just a set up volume     Volume 8 wouldn't work as an OVA since it ends on a cliffhanger. I'd prefer they just animate everything in a couple seasons. Like fuck, DxD got so many seasons, we deserve some too.    I wish someone would upload the rest of the CGs so I can get rid of these shitty youtube screenshots   At least she got told by Izumi.     Volume 8 wouldn't work as an OVA since it ends on a cliffhanger  Implying it's a problem.       What the fuck man, I'm not that guy In fact I was thinking of writing Yukinofags too      Aniplex seems to have taken a liking to Saekano. Like, holy shit, it got a S2 just a month after it ended, and it wasn't even a split cour.     But Yukino will (unfortunately) win.         In fact I was thinking of writing Yukinofags too  I believe you, but that is really not helping your case anon. The denialfag is a Yuifag after-all.     But I'm a Harunofag    The irony.    You like the best Yukinoshita, you're forgiven.    REMOVE HARUNO    Then all is forgiven, your taste is one I approve of.   And I'm an Irohafag       Nope. REMOVE YUKINO instead.   Thanks OP. Not to mention after reading the summary of the first chapter suddenly i feel really happy. Izumi is such a good girl.    wanting to eliminate Eriri from Tomoya's mind   She's great.      who do you like here?    It's a blessed series.   Is kato in love with the Bowl?   Back to Saekano, where you know that Megumi will(unfortunately) win   Now I am done with the summary, damn no mood for the full content now other than confirming certain truths    unfortunately     Not that I hate her or what. Even though she is interesting with rare main heroine characteristics and actually has no bad thing to talk about. But knowing my favourite heroine will mostly not gonna win still hurts Well if you are not winnerfag you will understand right?    Is Eriri still the worst girl?   Well depend on which side they choose respectively  Me?  Yeah I think so      My opinion, yes. That's why i love when Izumi actually confronts her.    Can't wait Izumi for kicking her ass hard enough that she can't stand up well    That's most likely not going to happen. The best Izumi could manage is probably perfect her own style. Maruto's basically been building Eriri as an incredible genius who's caught the eyes of the best of the best in the business.    And now she's a villain. Unless you don't mind seeing a betrayer who gone due to her poor confidence smiles at the end    I couldn't care less honestly, but why wouldn't there be a scenario where they all smile at the end? Tomoya and Iori were both amused by the irony of how their rivalry turned out in vol 7.    Iori reminds me of Hayato though, still Iori is better for me You know that Eriri's betrayal is lead by forceful approach (at least I found it quite negative by showing her better pictures) right? Tbh here's is the development I wished the most  Tomoya could found a way that's way better than forcing them that he did before, which resulting a better apporch and result compared to his rivals and manages to gain back Eriri and Utaha's trust so regroup becomes possible  Of course regroup is nice but better if they could at least kick Eriri's ass up hard 1st, so to remind her where she should be at Sweet revenge, to conclude Also, Eriri is cute when she's vulnerable          Yeah, she deserve some punishment. I remember a story which has similar scenario, forget what it is though. Other members start to punch the betrayer until they satisfied and become bros again afterwards.    It's Akane. Everything she does is forceful.    Check your history list, NOW!!!    Literally old Tomoya with better expertise    Are you guys looking forward to Classroom Crisis then?    Maruto needs to go back and finish 太陽の子 first. But he's working with his bff Takahiro so it will probably be shit.    I feel she's more like Tomoya, Eriri and Utaha rolled into one.   Well I read Saekano simply because the harem doesn't include "Giving MC fist, kick or any other harm due to any sort of fanservice or misunderstanding"(once you finish with something like Mayo Chiki ,Strike the Blood or Index you will know my feels) Also you can found  Daughter of rich family who is also a porn doujinshi author   Female writer of a school love comedy LN with harem made for male readers who wrote that to get praised by the person she like   Can't find such awesome characters at anywhere else        I got Tomoya and Utaha, but Eriri part beats me    Both are artists, both are/were mentally weak, both are childish (Akane is said to be a cruel child who became an adult without actually growing up).    Damn you are more into it than me. Time to reread it     Come on, in the epilogue fandisk, she's visibly happy, baby and all. She's even friends with Kazusa. Kazusa's side was so fucking corny whenever it involved her though.     thanks anon      Takahiro  is that the akame ga kill and majikoi, writer?    Why you people act like if Eriri did something horrible?  She did what she thought it was the best.     Yes.   Maruto man. He constantly shits on Eriri and wonders why she isn't popular.       Maruti did his part ages ago    Well he's a goner then.     太陽の子     Speaking of betrayal, Tomoya is also at fault for having poor management recently (cause he quitted using forceful approach by looking better solution and while he is still out of idea the management get worst by days)  Expecting a better management to get their trust back in part 2     And some people thought Izumi was going to join as a better artist than pro Eriri? Ha.    She'll catch up someday.     tfw irrelevant    Could it not be that Japan is just getting tired of generic-as-fuck tsunderes?    Poor girl, the most sincere of the bunch about her love and she is just condemned to friendzone.    Even worse, authorzoned.    The key is the management, which will alter the artist's potential. Even pro will run out of idea without proper management(vol 6-7)  Implying Tomaya is responsible for making Izumi better than Eriri  And we shall witness the magic      Really sad, my only consolation is that Eriri probably will be on the same boat.    Eriri deserves it. Utaha not so much, but she still fucked up.  They should learn from Megumi and just build it slow and steady, no rushes, letting the other competitors destroy themselves.        Tomoya is also at fault for having poor management recently   recently  Tomoya is always bad at everything. That's part of the package.      I'm pretty sure Looseboy is the key factor holding the project back.     Eriri has always been closer to Tomoya than Utaha. She gets more special treatment.     Eriri losing is rather pathetic with all the advantage she has had over the othet girls. Now she's like a third wheel, the lowest position in a romantic story.    I disagree, I think Eriri and Utaha act their respective archetypes pretty straight most of the time. There's not much that makes them stand out from their peers.     the lowest position in a romantic story.  The lowest one is being in love with a guy while not being the love interest AND having some male orbiter around you. That's a death sentence.       probably  Too bad that's wishful thinking for you. Eriri is set as Megumi's rival and friendship that needs to be reconciled, so she will be relevant for a while. Utaha also wants to look out for Eriri, so she wil serve to give Utaha some relevance because of that.    Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain   wkwk  Will Gainax deliver?  I'm scared. I don't want it to end.    No opening   Insert of full version of Stella-rium when Subaru starts to fix everything   You heard it here first folks. My dead finacee worked at GAINAX       finacee      I don't want this ride to end either    Hva you bought strawberry milk for the last episode, /a/?  Please let them remain together in their universe even after the alien and their powers have gone, Gainax!   Like I said, I'm lactose intolerant.     3 hours left     You mean 6. 7,5 until HS.   Hopefully we will get another kissu.   one episode left     KinMoza and SB69 are over   Pleiades to end soon   Etotama and DanMachi will follow too  It it not an end. Just a transformation.        DanMachi will follow  It's not all bad news then.     Danmachi was good.    Good for what it is perhaps, but that's not saying much.    It really wasn't.    Danmachi is just a LN advertisement. The booty in it was good though.    Hestia could only keep me going for four episodes before I dropped it.    Good.  So i can marathon the shit out of this in the mid-seasons week of nothingness.       not being white    Both excited to see how it ends, and sad that it's ending. Somehow this series felt like Gainax really put a lot of heart into making it.   I can't be the only one doing a marathon rewatch before the finale, right?     1 hour 25 minutes remain    I want Gyate Gyate of the Houkagos.     There's no time. I'm re-watching Aquarion and Symphogear.    Until what? It's 80 minutes left according to anichart, but in previous threads, images start appearing 4 hours from now, and HS is out one hour after that.    So is anichart wrong?    Yeah.    Zettai! I've actually done it throughout the past Week because of Work Schedule.   Nanoko's song is so beautiful. So glad I downloaded the singles for the OP and ED.  Where's the stream? Yucie and Neet are dead for me.    Preview https://<span>youtu.be/QEGqRYax6Lk  [ ]   inb4 ends with Subaru opening a door    a fucking black hole   Minato and Subaru together   I'm getting hype.      So 1 hour or 3 hours till it airs? Can I marathon it in time?    3 hours, but you won't have enough time to marathon in   Dat parallel universes. Dat fountain.   I think anin has enough time as long as he is not planning to watch the livestream and wait for subs instead     The spaceship appeared  So the earth is fucked? Inb4 time travel.     3:30 until it airs, 5 hours until subs. You can make it. Just don't get distracted and don't check the thread.       Okay thanks anons.   Enjoy your finale          You are in a car advert thread.   The OST is out today.  It's a shame the characters look washed out.   Hestia is the worst part of Danmachi and not what makes it good.   Reminder: by buying banana milk you are a filthy Bananaraffe xeno scum and you should be purged.  Listen up faggots, I think it's high time we all recognize just how fucking good JC Staff is. JC Staff has consistently produced quality anime for the last 20 years, and they don't get the respect they deserve.  Season after season, year after year, JC Staff produces hit after hit, and we seem to forget that each successive AOTS is being produced by the same fucking studio. It's DanMachi this season, and It will be Prison School next season.   How can one studio be so based? Are the other studios even fucking trying?        Are the other studios even fucking trying?  Why won't you ask KyoAni on this matter.      Flopani   literally "muh animation is the only thing that matters" the studio  Sure, they're always trying to produce boring anime in a high school setting.  At least JC Staff have variety.        All of those shows are shit.   Are you mad about that P.A. Works thread or something    It's literally impossible to dislike all of those shows.     That's some consistency.    ghost hunt    joshiraku   kimi to boku   nodame   taishou yakyuu musume   I'm all about the PA works but damn JC staff makes good josei shit too        JC Staff make a lot of fun shows.   Oh its quite possible if you have any semblance of taste.    Just how long have you been on /a/?     haremshit   Into le garbage it goes       Golden Time was the best romance anime of the last 10 years. If you dislike like Golden Time then you hate love.       best romance anime of the last 10 years  Toradora isn't 10 years old yet       liking TADA BANRI     I like them, certainly in my top 5 of studios  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127114598   le  Fuck off.      Henneko   Sakuraso   Not Alien9, Excel Saga, Kill me Baby, Milky Holmes (S1 and 2) and Magimoji Rurumo   Yeah no.         They produce too many masterpieces to list all of them effectively.     JC Staff appreciation   Doesn't even include their two best shows  Also Utena.      Golden Time was the best romance anime of the last 10 years     Excel Saga  At least the mangaka had the good sense to see JC Staff would only butcher his work, and told them not to adapt it.         Name one romance better than Golden Time produced recently.      JC Staff has consistently produced quality anime for the last 20 years  I wouldn't go as far as saying that, but they sure get more hate than they deserve. Oh the other hand, pretty much everything they've made the past couple of years has been quite ranging from "good enough to watch" to "great".      For some reason to me, the words "J.C. Staff" always associates with Shana. And I don't see her here      flopani     White Album 2     KyoAni really doesn't specialize in taking good shows and ruining them.      Danmachi    AOTS  nigga you cant be serious       DanMachi is AOTS, but only because all other shows this season are bad. It wins by decision.     Meanwhile  still no Index S3 nor Railgun D    ITT: Good anime with cancerous fanbases.   what's cancerous about the fanbase?    It's way too popular with casualfag Toonami kiddies. /a/ pretends to hate it because of that.    So basically, you could rename your thread to "entrylevel anime"?  I think your thread would fare better on .      i'll take "all anime in existence" for 1000, alex   Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?    That's why there was blood huh.     Admittedly, I did say he redeemed himself later on. But rereading that chapter, I got angry. But after Dressrosa, he's gonna have his 8000 followers. And he has Haki now. He's got so much power on his belt at this point and I don't want to see that untapped.    Fucking stop please.    Plot things that will come up later. Be among the most amusing interactions with the crew. Use her fruit to do stuff sometimes. Far more useful as a member then brook.    Yeah she's definitely dead just like Wiper, Enel, Connis, Pagaya, Igaram, Pell, T Bone, Paulie, Lucci, Spandam and Bon Clay right?  Oh wait they are all alive when they shouldn't be.      Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be the next Hokage    No, the idea is to watch Futurama season 10 episode 1, and find all the ways in which Leela is wrong, because she literally makes the wrong choice every time because she thinks she's driving when it's actually me driving :D :D :D it's too fucking good, i'm dying of laughter here    Sarada deserves better.    I know, it's still a made up genjustu world    People forget Sasuke's hair was blue in Part I.    JUST REWRITE IT. We've been rewriting futurama while it's streaming for 2 years now   Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe   Yes   Will there ever be any decent Castlevania figures? I really like the outfits and just the overall look of these characters on my pic. Especially that hunky Richter Belmont! Anyways, dont /v/ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out me to death pls.     Interesting.     Yes, don't.   No.<br/>       maybe </blockquote>]
