I was choking up a bit in just the first five minutes of the first episode and the OP song feels like getting punched in the stomach. <br><br>On the surface it's all really light hearted and feel-good, but the atmosphere has something about it that doesn't make any of this feel like it's in the present day and it's more like this endless flashback sequence with a strong Anohana vibe to everything where it feels like you're watching the childhood memories of a dying Japanese woman that's reflecting on the idyllic all-but-extinct rural Japanese way of life that she lived when she was a young girl in a small rural village that is probably an abandoned ghost town now.</br></br>  <br>Not for this show but there have been other anime that was light hearted that made me feel like shit.<br><br>I can kind of see what you mean though.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you might be autistic.

It is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as acute delusional states, hallucinations, feelings of persecution (perceptions of being a victim of prejudice, aggression, or hostility from others), derealization, depersonalization, anxiety, and also psychosomatic manifestations such as dizziness, tachycardia, sweating, and others <br> &gt;contributory factors: Idealised image of Paris – it is also speculated as manifesting from an individual's inability to reconcile a disparity between the Japanese popular image and the reality of Paris. <br> Japanese visitors are observed to be especially susceptible. There is a 24-hour help line run by the Japanese embassy to help Japanese tourists suffering from this condition. <br><br>I want an anime about Paris Syndrome.<br><br> Anime about a Japanese girl who's obsessed with France <br> First 5 episodes are filled with her talking about how she can't wait to go to France and funny antics as she practices French in Japan <br> She's excited and happy as she boards the flight to Paris  <br> Suddenly Somalians every where. <br> Islamic call to prayer is playing so loudly that her ears are ringing and she's dazed. <br> She stumbles through the street and is subsequently robbed.  <br> A group of Muslim men drag her into a nearby alley and rape her after she accidentally bumps into the 200 Muslims that are praying in the middle of the road. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Barakamon meets Watamote.</br></br>  <br>You are simply having the crushing realization that you have long abandoned the innocence of youth; an innocence that you now hold dear in retrospect.

The show does not, for the most part, have any "thin layer of sadness". It's atmospheric, there's a child like sense of wonder and the setting contributes to that. You, as an adult, are feeling melancholic because the characters are experiencing their childhood genuinely, not the kind of bullshit you expect in anime where it's completely unbelievable.

Exposure to one or multiple traumatic occurrences of a close friend or family member leaving (abandonment or fate of mortality) would make the person unable to form true and affectionate attachments towards people <br>Not him, but her background fits</br></br>  <br>Shikinami will roundhouse kick you in the face if you see her bits</br>  <br><br>from psychnet:<br><br>  Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of attention seeking behavior and extreme emotionality. Someone with histrionic personality disorder wants to be the center of attention in any group of people, and feel uncomfortable when they are not. While often lively, interesting and sometimes dramatic, they have difficulty when people aren’t focused exclusively on them. People with this disorder may be perceived as being shallow, and may engage in sexually seductive or provocative behavior to draw attention to themselves. </br></br></br></br>  <br>She was mad at Shinji.

Misato was somewhat distanced from the others since she was much older and was interacting with Kaji. Rei is so far out there she doesn't even realize she has problems for most of the series.<br><br>The only true constant between all four of them is that their development in Rebuild has been significantly worse.</br></br></br>  <br> the only one who could have made Asuka happy turned out to be a homo <br>Fuck this gay Earth.</br></br>  <br>No, she hated herself above all. And berated people to keep them away.</br>  <br>No, she was fed up with his moping, self-centered attitude and for not doing anything to help out. She doesn't seem to hate him or ReiQ.</br>  <br>She'd still have had to kill him in the end, though.</br>  <br>She didn't give a damn about Kaji. He was just an adult male to get attention from. It was all about Shinji the moment Asuka realized he was another Eva pilot - he was the only one that Asuka could allow herself to feel equal to without destroying her entire bloated ego. Even then with Shinji it was still mostly about her.</br>  <br><br>They all had different circumstances that made them unique enough from each other, but the core problem was there in all of them: they needed to learn to accept/love themselves. In Shinji's case in particular, almost everyone served as a foil to him not just Asuka.</br></br>  <br>It still would have been interesting to see how his presence would have affected her in the long run. Also would put a whole new disturbing twist on the MP Eva fight.</br>  <br><br>Rebuild Asuka resembled the generic tsundere archetype that Soryu popularized more than Soryu. All of the character motivations and interactions are a mess on the surface with no substance beneath.<br><br><br>Nobody is arguing that. I'd just say there was a heavier focus on Shinji and Asuka's relationship than any other.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will never understand this. Kaworu was easily the worst executed character in the original. He was there solely to move the plot along and was hardly mentioned again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She didn't give a damn about Kaji.  <br>Which is why Asuka called out Kaji-san's name repeatedly to help her after she got mindraped by Arael and Kaji was already dead, right?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I actually wanted to see Kaworu interacting with others, not in a romantic capacity. Just to have that fag in a new role bringing different dynamics, but Q just made him really one note by boosting the gayness. He can't function without Shinji</br></br></br>  <br> was easily the worst executed character in the original <br>Nah, that award goes to Gendo. A shallow plot-device with no depth or character despite all the screentime he got. So bad they had to resolve his character in EoE with 3 generic 'I didndunuffin' lines.<br>The thing about LAK is that Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji, it's just interesting to think about how it would have affected her character and the overall story. Not to even bring up the fact that he's a literal teenage Kaji.<br><br><br>This. They ruined any trace of potential he had in the previous two movies. Fucking Anno doesn't want him to move past the shitty perfect Iku-chan husbando stage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing about LAK is that Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji <br><br>That's what Mari was made for.</br></br></br>  <br> a heavier focus on Shinji and Asuka's relationship than any other <br>Not really. Asuka shows up almost half way through the show and is relevant for about 5 episodes before she goes coma. It was always about Shinji and Misato more than anything, she's the heroine after all.</br></br>  <br> She's probably mad at him for sitting on his thumbs and letting her get mangled by Unit 01's dummy plug. <br><br>Possible. It doesn't seem like it's about impact or the curse since expositing about those is the most she talks to him without snarling and he's brat Shinji instead of worldkiller Shinji.</br></br></br>  <br> The thing about LAK is that Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji <br>Okay, I can't be the only one who thinks they wouldn't get along? Shinji and Asuka are outwardly different. Anytime they meet in other canon/universes they hate each other. Not to mention they are the complete antithesis of each other. This is shown in their relationship to Shinji.</br></br>  <br>That and merchandise, yeah.</br>  <br> Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji <br><br> one completely ignores her, lost in his own problems without realizing hers <br> the other unconditionally loves her for no reason other than that she has problems <br><br>Both sound pretty bad to me, at least Shinji forced some character development on both sides.<br><br>There are reasons why Kaworu and Mari are disliked in Eva - they are completely static with little insight into their own mind and history. The two major differences between them is that Kaworu at least affected the plot a little before fucking off and that Mari refuses to fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu not realizing 'Adam' was Lilith until they were face to face just becomes a convoluted mess once we learn that and his true identity. I am glad the movies established that difference right off the bat.<br><br><br>How so? Shikinami's a hot-shot wannabe lone wolf who gets knocked off her high horse by the 8th Angel and realizes relying on others isn't terrible. That follows through to the next movie when she's Wille's point man but expects Mari to be there covering her back.<br><br>She looks down on Shinji because she thinks he got the Unit 01 seat from being the Commander's son. When he comes back, she realizes he's still a bratty child out of his depth and she has no patience to deal with it.<br><br>The characters are consistent with each other from 1 to 2 to 3. What might be inconsistent Gendo/Seele's plans and how much is keikaku or just bullshitting stuff as it comes up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shinji and Asuka are outwardly different. <br>And by this I meant that Kaworu probably wouldn't fall in love with Asuka because one of the things Kaworu really liked about Shinji was his modesty/shyness. <br>It'd be cool if they were friends however, just that Asuka might have to tone it down though.</br></br></br>  <br> The characters are consistent with each other from 1 to 2 to 3. <br>Asuka's mommy issues are completely gone and her latching on to older figures (Kaji) and attention-seeking behavior is gone too, which made up 80 percent of her original character.<br><br>Shittynami a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in terms of motivation, Shinji and Asuka are essentially the exact same <br> both have very similar histories and family situations as well <br> the biggest difference is that Shinji turns inward and Asuka outward to avoid their problems <br> despite this they spend the entire show hating each other without even knowing why, failing to understand themselves or show compassion for others <br> &gt;this is why the ending scene of eoe is so great </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaworu really liked about Shinji was his modesty/shyness. <br>Kaworu loved Shinji because he deserved to be loved. Kaworu is the embodiment of the concept that all people deserve love, regardless of their flaws.</br></br>  <br> Mari and Asuka were going to be rivals for the Unit 02 seat <br> Mari was going to get Unit 02 and know Kaji and Asuka was going to be stuck on the sidelines. <br><br>I'm glad they changed that plot but I do wish they'd kept some of the rivalry between Mari and Asuka in 2.0, like Mari could have been the runner up for Unit 02 and that's how she got in tight with Nerv Euro and earned the Unit 05/8 position.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I personally prefer rebuild Rei, seeing her develop a personality is great.</br>  <br>He acts exactly as Kaji does in personality, plus he's patient and willing to listen to problems and give attention. All Asuka really needed was someone who would love her for her instead of putting her to standards and expectations, and Kaworu fits the bill.<br> they meet in other canon/universes <br>Those universes aren't canon and aren't made by Anno and co. In the drafts she was smitten, she even started a fanclub at school for him.<br><br><br> Kaworu disliked in Eva <br>He's really not, though. There's a reason why he's one of the most memorable of the cast. He has more character and depth to him than Maya, Hyuga, and Aoba despite them receiving far more screentime then him. <br> they are completely static <br>He's as static as Ramiel or Sachiel. He's an angel in a MoTW show, and has as much depth as one would expect him to be as such. He fulfills his role with his relationship to Shinji as Armisael did to Rei and Arael did to Asuka. Unlike the major shit that is Mari, Kaworu contributed to the show in a reasonable and expected manner and gave it substance and memorability in his episode. Mari is just a whole bunch of nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What the fuck is this bitch's problem? <br>Germany lost the chance of winning the women's fifa cup last night.</br></br>  <br> All Asuka really needed was someone who would love her for her instead of putting her to standards and expectations, and Kaworu fits the bill. <br>True that someone with many of Kaworu's traits would work but that doesn't have to mean Kaworu himself.<br> Those universes aren't canon and aren't made by Anno and co. <br> made by Anno <br>After the End is, and they hated each other there. Kaworu actually starting ragging on Asuka's personality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is Kaworu static? He's fine for what he is, which is just another angel in the show. It's actually hilarious how despite receiving only 10 minutes of screentime he had more to him than Gendo ever did. Jesus fuck, Gendo is such a shallow shit character, and in Rebuild he's even worse.</br>  <br>*started</br>  <br>as someone that just finished watching it for the first time i think her anta-bakaism was a result from shoving her sadness way deep into herself and decided to become strong to not be in pain anymore resulting in her acting like a cunt</br>  <br>It's interesting how this dialogue can also be applied to the Unit 03 situation.<br><br><br>So? If you want NGE, watch NGE. Rebuild's not telling the same exact story so that's your problem. Her personality in 3 follows from her personality in 2.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he had more to him than Gendo ever did. <br>What? Did you completely forget about Gendo's self hatred and obsession with Yui?</br></br>  <br> I'm honestly surprised she didn't turned out suicidal like her mother <br><br><br>It's been quite a while since I saw Evangelion so sorry If I'm missing something here. But wasn't there a scene where she tried to kill herself? The one where she lies in the bathtub? For me it always looked like she tried to slit her wrists.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that doesn't have to mean Kaworu himself <br>True, it doesn't. It's just a silly crackpairing and it's fun to think about their possible dynamic with eachother. At the end of the day it's just fanfiction bullshit, no need to get triggered and take it seriously.<br><br> After the End is <br>So we have Asuka loving Kaworu in the drafts and Asuka hating Kaworu in the Drama CD. It's a 1 on 1 situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me too. I also like ReiQ and I hope the ending allows the two of them to coexist and show that they can develop as their own people.</br>  <br> Gendo's self hatred and obsession with Yui <br>Which is never expanded on AT ALL. Gendo's role in the show is essentially be a plot device for Shinji, spout cryptic generic one-liners and look menacing with his shitty pose. He's literally nothing but shallow, and even Fuyutsuki has more character to him thanks to the backstory episode. He gets no resolution or expansion in the final two episodes and his character is forced into completion with 3 quick lines in EoE.</br></br>  <br>It looked like rust and wear in the tub to me, but the scene is definitely supposed to imply she's committing suicide by slitting or starvation.</br>  <br>The folded clothes gives it away.</br>  <br> Me too. I also like ReiQ and I hope the ending allows the two of them to coexist and show that they can develop as their own people. <br><br>That's a pointless question because you know it's already true. They can coexist (they already are), and there's literally nothing stopping them from developing as "their own people" to begin with.<br><br>Also you're a faggot for liking Rei Q, a character whose entire existence is to belittle the character she's based on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Abandonment issues by a batshit insane mother who hung herself.</br>  <br>I give Gendo a lot of slack.<br><br> personally watched the entire world go to shit in an instant <br> too old to pilot eva himself <br> his wife likely intentionally killed herself to get into eva 01 <br> has to let children like his own son pilot what is essentially a $888 trillion version of his dead wife <br> another of the children is essentially his dead wife, who his son likely wants to fuck <br> his elderly assistant also wanted to fuck his wife <br> has to game two generations of female scientists just to keep them moderately happy, one of which killed his wife/child <br> he likely split his wife/child's soul in half just so that it could pilot eva since it didn't have an actual mother <br> has to manage an entire militarized government agency that is filled with lunatics <br> has to deal with a group of fanatics trying to become gods through the end of the world <br> has to do all of this just to keep the world from breaking long enough for him to see his dead wife again and knowing that everyone will hate him <br><br>When you think about it this motherfucker was the sanest and craziest guy in the entire show. I admit his primary motivation of seeing his dead wife is rather shallow, but I can also understand why he would really want it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope to god you're trolling.</br>  <br> &gt;he likely split his wife/child's soul in half just so that it could pilot eva since it didn't have an actual mother <br>You're a fucking idiot.<br><br>He's a faggot for liking anything rebuild related in general. Eva is a character driven show. Rebuild butchers every character in the show. Rei, Asuka, Shinji, Gendo, all of them. Why do people give a shit about and discuss the rebuilds for god sakes? They're the anime equivalent of the second trilogy of Star Wars.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I gave it a comedic spin, but not trolling mate. Gendo is underappreciated in the original. He has plenty of development with everything I just said, it's just that most of those events didn't happen during the timeline of the series. By the time the series starts he's a bitter man. Some notable moments are when he burns his hands to open Rei's hatch or when he is seen personally helping the workers when the power goes out.<br><br>The fact is he's a simple man who just wants his wife back. His role in the show is more of an antagonist in his relation to the actual main character Shinji. He doesn't have to have a huge complex psyche to justify his character.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a faggot for throwing all of Rebuild under one label.<br><br>The first two movies don't butcher the characters in the show. They present perfectly workable specimens that are only held back by their lack of conitnuation.</br></br></br>  <br>And he's such a conspiratorial Machiavelli because exploitation is the only human interaction he understands, and his motivation changes between working with Yui and without her, and he demonstrates in his monologue at the end that he knows he's fucking wrong and doesn't know how else to be on his own. Gendo's an awesome lunatic, Kaworu doesn't have anything that good.</br>  <br>Are you really posting in an Eva thread without knowing the "likely" (aka only viable possibility) relationship that Rei has with her unstable Eva? A pilot has to sync with the soul of its mother in the eva, and being a clone Rei clearly doesn't have one. Souls in nge are borderline tangible and can be transported or altered. It likely happened when Rei I was killed and before Rei II was made.<br><br>Get the fuck out.</br></br></br>  <br>He has development, but he's a psycopath and an evil man by every definition of the word. The creation of pointless suffering is what he did.<br><br>His character doesn't need to be justified beyond what NGE presented him as, and just ignore the Kaworu fan earlier. All they know is belittling other characters to that theirs will look better.</br></br></br>  <br>Rei is the body of Yui with the soul of Lilith inside of it you fucking doofus.</br>  <br><br>The problem is we never get to see anything of him reaction to this or even mentioning it. He's almost inhuman in how he wears the same fucking expression over the entirety of the show like a completely generic villain. Yes, this is good in setting up the tone and tension for Shinji and the audience, but it still doesn't make Gendo a good character in retrospect. EoE's half-assed attempt in making him sympathetic is also pathetic. They could have put in flashbacks or scenes of Gendo thinking about his past to himself, showing his relationship with Yui for example to give him some depth but they never did. He's pretty empty even in comparison to Fuyutsuki, and that's just sad. In my opinion, he's without a doubt the most shallow and worst character in NGE. He gets the job done being a plot-device for Shinji and the plot, but definitely not good writing in the way he's portrayed and executed.<br><br><br> Kaworu doesn't have anything that good. <br>Kaworu had a personality, for one. And likes and dislikes. However brief his screentime and role was in the show, we know more about him as a character than whatever the fuck generic ass villain Gendo is supposed to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but before people thought that, they said Naoko was in the EVA.<br><br>The actual, correct conclusion is that you don't know what exactly is inside EVA00 since it was never shown or mentioned explicitly.<br><br>The most likely option beyond that, if you're going to point something out, is that it's a dummy plug variant. It's a copy of Rei's personality, an emulation. This is why episode 14 is about testing things to develop the dummy plug system.<br><br>That Rei's soul was split is denied by the fact that both the series and supplemental materials make it clear that there's only one soul going around, and that's the one in Rei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaworu had a personality, for one. And likes and dislikes. <br>What? Kaworu is essentially an abstract concept of unconditional love. He doesn't have a character.</br></br>  <br> Kaworu had a personality, for one. And likes and dislikes. However brief his screentime and role was in the show, we know more about him as a character than whatever the fuck generic ass villain Gendo is supposed to be. <br><br>This here gentlemen, is why Kaworufags are despicable people. Whatever the conclusion you make from this guy's post, is that he's either ignorant or extremely self-deluded.<br><br>Gendo has no personality? Really? He has no likes or dislikes? Fucking really?<br><br>You know more about Kaworu than Gendo? REALLY?<br><br>I don't expect anything more from sub-human scum that only interacts with Evangelion in terms of homosexual fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Abloo bloo bloo not muh Eva <br>Get the fuck over it already.</br></br></br>  <br>Your suggestion for what soul is in Unit-00 is reasonable, but nothing in NGE or supplementals suggests that a soul cannot be broken or fractured. Quite to the contrary, it seems that Kyoko's soul was fractured during her contact experiment and that is what lead to her insanity. Additionally, the changes from Rei II to Rei III also suggest that she got part of her soul back.</br>  <br> His character doesn't need to be justified beyond what NGE presented him as <br>He does when even fucking Fuyutsuki has more to him than Gendo does. You can't call a shallow character 'justified'. The truth of the matter is they didn't know what to do with him, so they left him as a plot-device and called it a day. Same thing in Rebuild.<br> All they know is belittling other characters to that theirs will look better. <br>Not even. If we're ranking all the characters by depth and good writing, Kaworu is no doubt in the bottom 5, but Gendo is further behind him. Just trying to point out the hypocrisy in someone calling Kaworu shallow but approving Gendo despite having 20 times the amount of screentime as him.<br><br><br> He doesn't have a character <br>That's retarded ass thinking. He's a concept and symbolization of something, sure. But he has interests and personality in episode 24, much more than you can say for Gendo, Hyuga, Kensuke and Maya. So why are people so insistent on calling Kaworu shallow but not these characters despite having more screentime than him?<br><br><br> Kaworufags are despicable people <br>Fuck off with this meme. Just because I don't despite Kaworu, I'm now a Kaworufag? Just fuck off.<br> Gendo has no personality? Really? He has no likes or dislikes? <br>Go ahead and fucking name them then. You yourself know that if you watch NGE Gendo is nothing but a shallow figure of nothing. When even Kaworu and Fuyutsuki have more to them, you know they fucked up with whatever 'character' he's supposed to have besides generic villain #4.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Too perfect for her show.  <br>Says the shit eating plebian who can't even get decent taste in one of the artistically devoid mediums.</br>  <br>Figured, butthurt kaworufag detected. Only capable of spouting shit.</br>  <br> but nothing in NGE or supplementals suggests that a soul cannot be broken or fractured.  <br>Neither did I suggest that. I suggested that Rei's soul is always mentioned as complete; never incomplete.<br><br> Additionally, the changes from Rei II to Rei III also suggest that she got part of her soul back. <br>There aren't any changes in Rei II from Rei III that isn't explained by already established ideas, or conventionally explainable phenomena.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is more evidence in support of part of Rei being in eva 00 than anything else. Being a Dummy Plug would be such a let down and the eva was being operated long before a reasonable system was made in the series.<br><br> the stark difference in personality between Rei I and II <br> the deformed Rei head often connected with 00 <br> the general instability of 00 (albeit this could be because of pretty much anything) <br> Ritsuko having the dark hair of her mother when the camera is arguably shown from 00's perspective when it goes berserk <br><br> That Rei's soul was split is denied by the fact that both the series and supplemental materials make it clear that there's only one soul going around, and that's the one in Rei. <br>I would love to see some support for this.<br><br><br>Part of Asuka's mother being in Eva02 was obviously confirmed. In fact I think that's the basis for people arguing that Rei's soul could have been split for 00 as well. I also thought that because II and III acted so similar despite being a new body it also supports the soul breaking theory - Rei's soul from II was fully transferred to III without splitting again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people unironically defending Gendo <br>Fucking Eva threads</br>  <br> Just because I don't despite Kaworu, I'm now a Kaworufag? Just fuck off. <br>you're a kaworufag because you're making so <br>many posts defending him. look at yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> But he has interests and personality in episode 24 <br>I can think of exactly one "interest" of Kaworu, and that is music. What else is there? Also, how can you ignore Gendo's actual character traits while pretending that Kaworu has any?</br></br>  Why are Eva designs so ugly? What's with those pointy chins?  <br>So wait, he's a kaworufag for engaging you in discussion about a character that you choose to continue? How fucking retarded are you? Why did you put that line break there you stupid shit?</br>  <br>Ikari Gendo did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Keep trying junior. You might accidentally find some substance in your bile</br>  <br>He's a Kaworufag for vehemently trying to extrapolate the equivalent of an entire series' worth of character development from a characterless character that only had about 10 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br> We have seen every inch of Asuka and Rei except for their nipples and vag <br>Were we watching the same thing? Asuka's nipples are in the EoE, Rei's in Prelude. Plus there's a shitload of vags in EoE, just pick one and say it's Rei's.</br></br>  <br> doesn't refute any points <br> resorts to ad hominem <br>I'm pretty much indifferent to Kaworu, but even I notice how retarded it is to bitch about him being 'shallow' yet accept Gendo, Kensuke, and the bridge bunny faggots for eating up screentime being shallow one-note characters. Figures some mindless Kaworu-hater can't give me anything of substance in response.<br><br><br> many posts defending him <br>I'm also defending Fuyutsuki. Am I now a Fuyutsukifag as well? Fuck off, you paranoid retard.<br><br><br> Gendo's actual character traits  <br>Yes, please tell me something of relevance Gendo does in Eva besides his retarded pose and mumbling about 'the plan'. Clearly a great character of depth here. Kaworu being the representation of the ideal, unconditional love for 10 minutes is far more than whatever Gendo bring to the table.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  imagine Ragyo and Gendo as your parents  <br>Then tell him why he's wrong and an idiot. Calling someone an [x]fag just because they're trying to discuss the qualities of character [x] who you happen to not like is the gayest shit ever.</br>  <br> There is more evidence in support of part of Rei being in eva 00 than anything else.  <br>There is none whatsoever. There is evidence for a dummy plug version, that part of Rei is in there (as in, a chipped off soul piece) is categorically denied by established facts about the show.<br><br> Being a Dummy Plug would be such a let down and the eva was being operated long before a reasonable system was made in the series. <br>On the contrary, it'd strengthen the series lore as well as be more true to the show, because it's the de facto technology they were researching at NERV.<br><br> the stark difference in personality between Rei I and II <br>See <br>No difference here. Claiming it's because of some soul nonsense would be the actual letdown here.<br><br> the deformed Rei head often connected with 00 <br>Which ties in well with the dummy plug tech.<br><br> the general instability of 00 (albeit this could be because of pretty much anything) <br>It's an established prototype, a design that's less complete. That's the actual issue.<br><br> Ritsuko having the dark hair of her mother when the camera is arguably shown from 00's perspective when it goes berserk <br>Dark hair through dark glass? Color me surprised.<br><br>Absolute nonsense that by the way, also fits with the dummy plug idea anyway.<br><br> I would love to see some support for this. <br>Ep 23, Red Cross Book section on Rei, and some NGE2 stuff I believe. Never a plural. Nothing corroborating a split soul.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But if you actually read his posts you'd see he isn't. He's criticizing Gendo's character by using Kaworu as an example. Gendofag pls.</br>  <br>Would you have been happier if Gendo's "plan" that he constantly mumbled about was revealed in the first 5 minutes of his appearence on screen instead of building tension and mystery by waiting until the end? Would that help you better understand the character and motivations that he clearly had?<br><br><br>You clearly don't know how many Eva threads and how many Kaworufags /a/ has been through. It's been over 10 years of shitposting anon, people like to keep things simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't deserve anything more you filthy Kaworufag.<br><br>Gendo is a character with a well-grounded backstory, with motives and intents, several character relationships, and is a cornerstone of Evangelion.<br><br>Kaworu is a MoTW Angel.<br><br>You are deluded and the only cure for you is to kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gendo does in Eva besides his retarded pose and mumbling about 'the plan <br>Again, he is obsessed with Yui, fearful of his own son, manipulative and deeply intelligent.</br></br>  <br>How Touji could sync with 04?</br>    <br>The fuck is yours?</br>  Wait, there are people who actually think Gendo is a good character? Even Touji left more of an impression on me.  <br> you wake up <br> everyone is bitching at you for 0 reasons <br> found your dad <br> you listen to your dad <br> bravo shinji , you blew it <br>it was their fault for bitching.<br>Poor Shinji</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up. Not that guy but this guy is fucking obvious.<br><br>There is no other person on this planet that would pretend Gendo has no personality or somehow has less character than Kaworu.<br><br>Fucking 3.0 ruined the entire fanbase by letting Kaworufags feel full of themselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You clearly don't know how many Eva threads and how many Kaworufags /a/ has been through. It's been over 10 years of shitposting anon, people like to keep things simple. <br>If you want to keep it simple then just don't fucking reply. What, you feel like you somehow have to fight the cancer even though you're being just as much, if not more of an obnoxious cunt than him? Good job nigga you top dawg what would we do without you</br></br>  <br>Not him but see <br><br>That's enough. Gendo has several times more screentime than Kaworu. Gendo has more backstory. Gendo has more development. Gendo has a more rigid place in the story.<br><br>He's not just an idiot, he's an incurable faggot Kaworufag who is entirely capable of accepting he's wrong.<br><br><br>Nobody gives a shit about who leaves a better impression on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not being cancer, you're cancer. Right now you're being a little fucking bitch who can't see the problem when it's right in front of you.<br><br>There is no way in this world Kaworu as a one-episode character with shaky characterization at best, is somehow less shallow than Gendo, a character whose presence is there for the entirety of Evangelion, and has solid backstory segments that explain the character.<br><br>It's extremely irrational, and that irrationality is only making people hate the shit out Kaworufags (and people like you, who may also be one).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I made four points, with the "00 being unstable" really just being a copout as I pointed out. I personally don't see how any of your counterarguments support a dummy system more than a split soul.<br><br>The way I thought the dummy system works is that it takes the current pilot (whose soul is syncing to the eva's soul) and basically tricks the eva into believing the dummy's inputs are the pilot's. I prefer to put the Steele Eva series in an entirely different category. The Eva still needs to have soul inside it that a dummy system couldn't provide on its own. Also when Shinji used the dummy system of Rei there was no Rei head.<br><br>You could also easily argue that extra sources wouldn't want to spoil one of the show's bigger mysteries by denoting plural or singular.  And I thought Japanese didn't easily distinguish between them kek. <br><br>My point of seeing brown hair on Ritsuko was easily the biggest support, inculding the huge difference between Rei I and II. Nothing you said counters this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Would you have been happier  <br>I would have been happier if Gendo had actually acted like a character instead of a generic villain. The fact that we know more about Fuyutsuki at the end of the show than Gendo says something, thanks to the backstory episode. Where are the scenes showing Gendo interacting with Yui, showing why he cared for Yui so much for example? He's completely expressionless and shallow in everything he does for the entirety of the show. His only purpose is to be Shinji's plot device, and he has no motivation outside of his 'love' for a person that we never once see him with in backstory scenes. It's shitty writing.<br><br><br> you filthy Kaworufag <br>You need to seriously fuck off with this shit. Not hating Kaworu does not make me a Kaworufag. There's something seriously wrong with you if you're this butthurt about a fictional character.<br> Gendo is a character with a well-grounded backstory, with motives and intents, several character relationships, and is a cornerstone of Evangelion. <br>You must be trolling. All of this shit exists because of fan speculation and is never once given any depth or extension in the show. Shallow and empty.<br> Kaworu is a MoTW Angel. <br>Who has more purpose motivation and depth than Gendo, and that's pretty sad.<br><br> he is obsessed with Yui, fearful of his own son, manipulative and deeply intelligent <br>Shit that is never detailed and given execution in the show, just speculation and a small pathetic excuse in his scene in EoE.<br> Gendo has no personality <br>Making a pose for 26 episodes in not a personality, you autist.<br><br> Gendo has several times more screentime than Kaworu <br>And the fact that he is more shallow than Kaworu makes him a terrible character.<br><br> solid backstory segments that explain the character. <br>They don't explain the character. They even explain Fuyutsuki more than fucking Gendo. He's a shallow generic villain. Get over it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You don't even know what or with whom your problem is anymore and you don't even know who to group into scary camps that are convenient to hate. Go shove some Valium up your arse and lie down before you pop a vessel you sperglord. You don't want to give yourself PTSD over some stupid shit like fanbase wars.</br>  <br>You're the one's that so butthurt you have to belittle a clearly more important and deep character like Gendo, not me.<br><br>You're filth for doing the above. Absolute filth, and it does not make me butthurt in the least to point that out.<br><br>Thanks to people like you, this fandom is utter shit. If you could just accept that Kaworu is a poor character aside from serving as homsexual fantasy fuel, you'd at least be honest.<br><br> b-but I'm not a kwrufg <br>Please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't her character supposed to be a 'what is tsundere exsisted' question, showing how fucked up a character like that would be in actuality as opposed to the 'dream' which Hideaki Anno believes anime fans live in?</br>  <br>Roshi doesn't like expendable sex dolls.<br> Also Asuka's outfit has colors similar to his gi </br></br>  <br>Continued; like in pic?</br>  <br> Fucking 3.0 ruined the entire fanbase by letting Kaworufags feel full of themselves. <br>I don't even know how it happened, Kaworu in 3.0 is directly lying, understands less than ever about what's going on, and his contribution as a pilot was getting dragged by his partner in the three-legged race. Is it the piano?</br></br>  <br> I personally don't see how any of your counterarguments support a dummy system more than a split soul. <br><br>Because if you watch ep 14, you'll see that they are doing the testing in which the "distorted Rei" appears in conjunction with the dummy plug testing. After that, they develop the Dummy Plug which has big fat "REI" letters on the side.<br><br> My point of seeing brown hair on Ritsuko was easily the biggest support, inculding the huge difference between Rei I and II. Nothing you said counters this. <br><br>I did, here's the one in repeat:<br>The colored glass she's behind would produce a darker color, and given EVA's quality and whatnot, there's no saying.<br><br>But more importantly, it's rubbish because EVA00 isn't targeting Ritsuko. It's targeting Rei.<br><br>Moreover, to finally put that theory down; if it was indeed a copy of Rei's mind and soul in a dummy program, it'd probably inherit whatever bad feelings Rei has for Ritsuko.<br><br><br>Seriously dude, just fuck off. You're lying your ass off at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure anon why not it is the master himself after all. I'll tell you what if even half of  is remotely true then I'll take back half the bad things I said about Rebuild.</br>  <br>It's the fact that Kaworufags are fucking retarded plebeians with the mindset of a twelve-year old. They're like machines that exist only to produce depravity in the form of yaoi.<br><br>It never ever mattered how retarded Kaworu was, or how bad a character he was. All that matters was that he was in a fantasy position with Shinji. That's why 3.0 can get away with what it did and have them produce a standing ovation.</br></br></br>   This exists. <br> People still don't think Asuka is best grill.  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mjo<wbr>Ax9djpNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>In Eva the mind and soul are essentially the same thing - it is the soul which decides a person's personality and individuality. The body is just a vessel for the soul contained by the soul's AT field. The dummy system would just be dummies with no actual minds.<br><br>I just remembered out of my ass more about the scene from 00's berserk when testing. The scene was done to make it ambiguous as to who it was attacking, with the audience assuming Gendo. At the end of the scene Ritsuko mentions that it was likely after her mistaking her for someone else. This coupled with the CLEARLY DARK BROWN HAIR WHILE NO OTHER COLORS WERE ALTERED really argues the split soul theory. The show itself wants you to believe this.</br></br></br>  <br> or how bad a character he was <br>Oh fuck off. There were no bad named characters in Eva and they all served important purposes. The very fact that you said shit as fucking stupid as this shows that your whole problem with the guy is not that he's an idiot, which he is, but because he's part of some gay conspiracy that serves to take away the girl you believe should have won over Shinji.</br></br>  <br><br>Let me give you some basic theory on fiction.<br><br>What if he actually took off with Shinji?<br><br>They'd run off, and Shinji would soon discover Kaworu is retarded and can't be depended on for shit. He'd make no progress whatsoever in his own life, he wouldn't be solving any problems, it'd be like that piano scene on repeat forever, and ever.<br><br>But what if Kaworu wasn't retarded then? What if he was a good character?<br><br>Then Kaworufags would be out of a job, wouldn't they? Making it canon, or at least "real" would spoil all the fanwank they had done, and they'd move on to the next fantasy.<br><br>Because that's precisely why Kaworu dies in 3.0 and is retarded: To save the fantasy. When he dies, the scum known as Kaworufags are now free to imagine whatever they want with the blessing of Anno himself. This is the intention. It saves the idea of true, eternal homosex love. Starcrossed love.<br>If it didn't happen, the story would end right there wouldn't it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There were no bad named characters in Eva and they all served important purposes. <br>Yeah, except when you're shitting on Gendo for being a bad, shallow character with no purpose.<br><br>Take your hypocrisy and fucking shove it faggot.<br><br>I also love how you start defending yourself with shipping, just proves how fucking shallowminded you are. I don't even know what the point is in conversing with you. I don't even consider you a person at this point, just a machine regurgitating shipping propaganda.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> important and deep character like Gendo <br>Yes, generic villain with shallow motivation is so deep. That pose he does? That menacing glare? Wow, so intricate. So important. Must be why he was in all those instrumentality scenes and the last two NGE episodes, right?<br>Listen, NGE has fantastic characters like Shinji, Misato, Rei, and Asuka, but unfortunately fails in the minor character department. Kensuke, Gendo, and the bridge faggots unfortunately suffer from this heavily, as there's nothing to say about them; they had potential for depth but in the end they're shallow and one-note unfortunately. However unlike these characters who have a lot of screentime at their disposal, Kaworu is given 10 minutes. He's a MoTW angel, so what he's given and what he does with it is perfectly find and acceptable. He serves his role to Shinji like Arael to Asuka and Armisael to Rei, and is able to be memorable in his motivations and personality traits as well. Obviously he's not a deep character in comparison to the MCs, he's just another episodic angel, but the fact that there's more substance to him than the previously mentioned characters who have more screentime clearly says something: Anno writes for characters he has personal interest in, and therefore other characters suffer as a result. This is why in the Evangelion cast, about half are good and have depth, while the other half are shallow and mere plot-devices. <br>Do you understand now, paranoid mcgee?<br><br><br>If Kaworu is so goddamn triggering to you, then how about we use Fuyutsuki as a character instead? Like Kaworu, he's also a minor character and is given more substance and depth than Gendo. This argument from the beginning has been proving Gendo is a shallow plot-device character, so start trying to refute my points like a rational human being instead of some rabid autist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, I totally read that wrong, my man. Feel free to insult me now. Thought you were insinuating something else.</br>  <br>What would 3.33 be like if they just told Shinji a 20 second explaination of what happened?</br>  <br> I'm not even reading them anymore. </br>  <br> In Eva the mind and soul are essentially the same thing - it is the soul which decides a person's personality and individuality. <br>I don't agree, there's a more grey area to this. It's true that the soul affects both, and if there's no soul there's certainly no individuality as you speak of it, but personality?<br><br>The body contains the memories, the ingrained reflexes in your spine that has come to be during your life. That affects your personality. <br><br> The scene was done to make it ambiguous as to who it was attacking, with the audience assuming Gendo.  <br>Not true at all, there's no ambituity to it whatsoever almost. It's Rei, and only Rei that's the highlight of the attack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you <br> you start defending yourself with shipping <br>I wasn't aware I had a tripcode on. Fuck me I'm silly, right?<br><br>Just the last day I was vehemently called an asukafag for trying talking about the EoE ending. The entire Eva fanbase on /a/ consists of fucking mouthbreathers who don't give a shit about the themses, characters or artistic value of this show and only give a shit about flinging shit at people who might hold an opinion incompatible with their favourite shit, you included.<br><br><br>You people make me fucking sick, if you could even be considered people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> favourite shit <br>ship*</br></br>  <br>Every post you make just show how much of a menace Kaworufags are to a good community. You're slamming Gendo hard for no reason here, and it's just to make Kaworu look less shallow.<br><br>The worst part that when you slam him, you describe him better than the anime described Kaworu.</br></br></br>  <br> start using the word mouthbreathers lightly on /a/ <br> notice over the last couple of weeks more people using it </br></br>    <br><br>Sure thing, the only mouthbreather here is you faggot.<br><br>You got schooled hard earlier and now all you've got is faux complaints.<br><br>You can't expect anyone to take you seriously after you've been proven wrong. Someone not fucking cancer would have gone "hm, OK I was wrong" and then continued the discussion. But not you. <br><br>Look at the other discussion ITT. Theories going back and forth, actual discussion, and all you've got is hatred towards other characters because you know deep inside that Kaworu is every bit as shallow as the show made him.<br><br>Even Anno admits he was a failure. Why can't you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey. Dumping a short manga by Takao Saito (Golgo 13). It's an adaptation of the classic Chinese novel by the same name.<br><br> The story, set in the Song dynasty, tells of how a group of 108 outlaws gathers at Mount Liang (or Liangshan Marsh) to form a sizable army before they are eventually granted amnesty by the government and sent on campaigns to resist foreign invaders and suppress rebel forces. It has introduced to readers many of the most well known characters in Chinese literature, such as Wu Song, Lin Chong and Lu Zhishen. </br></br>                                              This is probably going to focus on only a few of the characters and stories but it seems really cool and accurate, way better than the others Takao Saito historical manga I've seen.<br>How many volumes are there?<br>I can't even find it on Mangaupdates.</br></br>  <br><br>It's under his name as Suikoden. 4 volumes.</br></br>                        <br>Found it now, they forgot to add the author in the specific sections, that's why it didn't show up in his page.<br>It seems to be only 4 volumes and it was probably made to be published alongside the tv series.<br>Better than nothing I guess.<br>I don't expect it to show all the heroes though<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LD-<wbr>ci2yeDUs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>        <br><br>I haven't looked at the show yet.

How was it, /a/?  Boring  <br>I don't really remember anything specific, but I remember the episodes being really inconsistent.</br>  <br><br>Only 2 or 3 decent episodes, the rest were shit.</br></br>  <br>I'm a huge Halo fan, but other than the Package (which was the least anime-like episode of the entire thing) it was quite boring.</br>  If you like Halo watch it otherwise don't bother.  <br>It's literally episodic.</br>  I'm not even sure if I watched this.  <br>I think he might be referring to it being inconsistent with the Halo canon in places.</br>  The CG in the one episode was pretty good.  <br>Actually no, I confused it with the Starship Troopers stuff but most likely this is shit as well.</br>  <br>This.</br>  Literally only one good episode.  <br>The Package. <br><br><br>The music was good - but then they just ripped a lot of it from the Halo games, so that goes without saying.</br></br></br></br>  Shit, but not Halo 4.<br>Honestly, 343 is outright incompetent in all fields.</br>  <br>Halo 5 has the potential to be great (at least from a story perspective), but I'm not holding my breath just yet.<br><br><br>The Package was probably the one that adhered closest to the Halo lore too. There were still inconsistencies, but they got a surprising amount of the small details right.</br></br></br></br>  Awful, and I like Halo a lot. I was hoping for another Animatrix, but the quality just wasn't there.  <br>And there is so much potential in the Halo lore for good anime. Legends had potential, but fell short.</br>  <br>Origins I was inconsistent, but it was mentioned in it. Babysitter also didn't fit in, but it was a decent story. (and had a Spike lookalike). Package was shit storywise, had the most conflict with the lore, but was the best otherwise maybe. Protoype and Homecoming were also pretty good. The rest was garbage. Duel was so shit, it made me rage.</br>  <br>You know in your heart that 343 will find a way to fuck it up.<br><br> &gt;it's revealed that the UNSC and pro-humans Covenant was working with the Didact all along<br> Master Chief gets some bullshit Jesus powers along the way <br> press RB to kill Arbiter </br></br> </br></br></br>  <br> Honestly, 343 is outright incompetent in all fields. <br> ask a competent writer to write a pretty interesting background for the franchise <br> retcon it in the next game 5 months later <br>Baka Spark.</br></br></br></br>  I wish Japan would adapt RvB. The early episodes are paced so slowly that I would almost welcome a typical anime introduction of it.<br><br> I was just a normal spartan recruit, living an ordinary life, until one day I was assigned to the Blood Gulch base. Etc, etc. </br></br>  <br> Package was shit storywise, had the most conflict with the lore <br>Really? I would say it was one of the better ones lore-wise.<br><br><br> Master Chief gets some bullshit Jesus powers along the way <br>I am disliking that element of the actual overarching Halo plot at the moment. By making him "special" in a Jesus-like way they've diminished the achievements of the MC somehow.<br><br> press RB to kill Arbiter <br>Pls no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Halo 5 beta was fun so I have hope this one will be good and 4 was just them testing the waters.</br>  <br>Which of 343i's retcons are you referring to?<br><br><br>Not enough cute girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They could pull a Yamato and genderbend half the cast.</br>  <br>Basically the ones regarding the flood, and the knowledge the forerunners got about them.<br><br><br>Dr Halsey wasn't a teenager when the spartans were adults. Also if you read the novels and know the the game trilogy then when would it happen? It conflicts with both Reach stories.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 343i Studios <br> not ruining the franchise sine Halo 4 <br> Halo 5 <br> "potential" <br>Pffffffttttttt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty certain more girls show up in the later seasons, but I quit watching it sometime before the jump to Halo 3 for the footage.<br>Though I do agree; Shiela and Tex, and Donut  aren't enough girls to effectively make it work.<br>Maybe if Tucker got genderbent it could, he whines enough to be a girl anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Bungie themselves retconned parts of Eric's Fall of Reach novel, there are other aspects it also follows up on. 343i just make up dumb shit or do things like  kill off The Rookie. </br>  <br>Halo 4 made me lose interest in Halo Multiplayer, and this is coming from somebody who loved Halo Reach Multiplayer. <br><br>Halo 5 MP will have to be bloody amazing to reel me back in.<br><br><br> Dr Halsey wasn't a teenager when the spartans were adults. Also if you read the novels and know the the game trilogy then when would it happen? It conflicts with both Reach stories. <br>Artistic licence. 343i themselves said that the events of all but one of the Halo legends episodes are canon, but the way that they are portrayed is just an interpretation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 343i just make up dumb shit or do things like kill off The Rookie. <br>Anon, face it - the Rookie wasn't an interesting character. <br><br><br>And just imagine the amount of retconning that would be required to make Halo Reach work with The Fall of Reach.</br></br></br></br></br>  Prototype was animated very fucking nicely  <br>I dunno, while they've definitely messed up in places, they are doing some interesting things with the story. <br><br><br> Basically the ones regarding the flood, and the knowledge the forerunners got about them. <br>I don't recall any huge retcons in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Rookie wasn't an interesting character <br>Get out.</br></br>  It was shit. There was a fun episode or two, some surprisingly good ones, but overall, it was mediocre. Even as a fan of Halo.<br><br>At least it surpasses the Mass Effect anime. That was absolute trash. Not that you should expect much from video game adaptations or original stories but holy shit it was fucking bad.</br></br>  <br>What about the Supernatural anime?</br>  <br> video game adaptations </br>  <br> tfw when we're getting a Fall of Reach animated series but it's not anime <br><br><br>Okay anon, why was he interesting. Dirt is our only real insight into him as a character, and even at that it isn't a great one.<br><br><br> At least it surpasses the Mass Effect anime. <br>Anon, I'm pretty sure I could surpass the Mass Effect anime using only MS paint and Microsoft Sam.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  On the topic of 343, why do their Spartan-IV armor designs such so much? It's like they didn't even try to design unique armor that was somewhat practical, they just copy and pasted designs from popular sci-fi games and anime.  <br>You dumb mother fucker. The author admitted he couldn't do anything with the Rookie because he had no idea how to deal with silent characters in the novel narrative at all.<br><br>The Rookie shows off plenty of character and mannerisms without having to explicitly vocalize his presence.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you can surpass the ending.<br><br> has to make the choice between saving his waifu/military data or literally thousands of people <br> including a little girl and her mom he promised to save <br> he lets them all die for his waifu <br> gets promotions <br> PTSD <br> REMEMBER THE 6 BILLION </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't make him interesting though. I'm not saying he's a bad character (I actually quite like him), but there's only so far you can go with a character like that. I think he was handled perfectly in New Blood.</br>  <br> Not that you should expect much from video game adaptations <br>VNs are also video games, you know.<br><br> or original stories <br>Then what, only LN and manga adaptions make for good anime?</br></br></br></br></br>  The Exterminate song on YouTube got deleted.<br>Now I can't loop it anymore because I didn't downloaded it at that time.<br>Can't find it on nyaa.<br>Where can I find it, so I can loop it again?</br></br></br>  <br>Search your heart. There you will find it.</br>   <br> not predicting it will get taken down and instantly downloading it when you get the chance. <br><br>Also,<br>ONLY TWO MORE DAYS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have the determination to FIST?</br>  <br>I don't.<br>I don't think I ready. I will just let myself get swept away by the torrent.</br></br>  <br>thanks Anon!</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/APG2Xr6J<br><br>I uploaded them for that reason.</br></br></br>  Thank God somebody made one.<br>I crave these threads like crack.</br>  <br>I know that feel. Looking for Sympho threads is the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning.</br>  <br>Can't wait for who will give us the jam this time.</br>  <br>Genjuuro</br>  <br>I feel sorry for Tsubasa since she seems to be the only one that's flat. Everyone else have cowtits.<br>Even Shirabe's grew out a little bit more.</br></br>  <br><br>Genjuuro symphogear when</br></br>  <br>She doesn't have an ass either.<br>She probably has a nice toned tummy, if you're into that sort of thing.</br></br>  <br>hell yeah motherfucker</br>  <br>He doesn't need one.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but can you imagine him with one while singing the whole time?<br><br>I'm not gay and I don't like men but my dick would be erect</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ. How does he just gently grasping the metal pole crush the damn thing?<br>Even Superman can do that shit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know what you mean.<br>I was semi-chub during the G training montage to be honest.<br><br><br>He's the hero we need.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She isn't flat, they're just small.</br>  <br>Always did wonder what was the point of the gear users when Genjuuro probably could have done most of their work.<br>If Genjuuro was also singing with Zwei Wing, I doubt Kanade would have died.</br></br>  We've had land battles (S1), naval warfare (S2), and the trailer hints what we all know must come next: Aerospace.<br><br>Are we gonna get Zenmetsu Hibiki? Will there be another Gungnir Datto?! Is NotCommie going to throw away two seasons of convention and translate Swan Song as Superb Song? Will Miku and Hibiki finally get married? Is Ver going to redeem himself and become a True Action Hero?<br><br>Will Tsubasa ever graduate highschool?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Will Tsubasa ever graduate highschool? <br>Already confirmed. She's off being an idol with Maria while DMJii go to school.</br></br>  <br>He can't do shit against noise, since he's human.<br>Not directly, anyway.</br></br>  <br> Genjuuro probably could have done most of their work. <br>You need a Gear to not get exploded on contact by Noise. You're correct for every non-Noise opponent though.</br></br>  <br>I was talking about him taking the singing parts. Genjuuro singing Orbital Beat with the other two would be great.</br>  <br>sometimes she has a big ass,sometimes she hasn't, It's really weird</br>  <br>i still think their backup plan was quite literally people tying complete relics around his hands and feet and using them so he can strike at the noise with his martial arts bullshit.</br>  <br>Now I won't be satisfied until I see that.</br>  <br>Commie won't do it.</br>  Is someone subbing it this time?  <br>Where was this?</br>  So wait, the new characters are a bunch of androids, a literal wizard and her pet loli?<br><br>I-Is this season going to be Symphogeah vs Vocaloid?</br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05232 these guys are</wbr></br>  <br> I-Is this season going to be Symphogeah vs Vocaloid? <br>HYYYYYYYYYYYPE!</br></br>  <br>BASED</br>  <br> We don't translate native concepts such as mythology, foods, or customs unique to the language/country (unless it has an !

Isn't it dedicated to her by default?</br>  <br>Symphogear threads are automatically dedicated to her.<br>Mostly because there's Nanafags here no matter what time you ask. There's also that hardcore guy that tells stories of Nana.</br></br>  <br>Is it 7' o clock already?</br>  <br>First day of the 7th month.</br>  <br> tfw its already the seventh month of the year <br>Its Nana's month!</br></br>  <br>This month is official nana month!</br>  <br> its also the month where GX starts airing <br>I bet they planned this.</br></br>  <br> 2015 is over halfway finished already <br>fuck</br></br>  <br>Time really flies fast.<br>It'll only be a matter of time until Nana reaches 40.</br></br>  <br> tfw Smile Gang is also near its 700th episode <br>What a nice month.</br></br>  <br>She's forever 17.</br>  <br>She's not Yukarin, Nana is aware of her age.<br>She even joked about her age being 17x2 on her 34th birthday.</br></br>  Can we talk about Symphogear please, not about same song mcmolested as a child?  <br>u wot m8</br>   thread became Nana praising thread again <br>I really wonder why we haven't put "Nana thread" in the subject yet.</br>  <br>not wanting to worship Nana</br>    <br><br>/jp/ exists for this.</br></br>  <br> same song not mcmolested as a child <br>Look at this faggot who hasn't even tried to listen to Nana's music asides Synchrogazer and Vitalization.<br>Try to listen to her first albums before trying to judge her, fag.</br></br></br>  <br>So, asides Symphogear openings and insert songs, what other songs of Nana have you listened to, Mr. Expert?</br>  <br> complains about people talking about Nana on a Symphogear thread <br> thinks seiyuu talk goes on /jp/ <br>Be more subtle with those baits.</br></br></br>   idolfags <br><br><br>To be fair, she's more of an idol than a seiyuu.</br></br></br>  <br>Moot point, even idol seiyuu are discussed here and not on /jp/.</br>  <br>Well they should take it to the seiyuu threads then and not derail Symphogear threads all the time.</br>  <br>She's a damn Seiyuu-Artist. She calls herself a Seiyuu-Artist, everyone calls her a Seiyuu-Artist. Even Music Japan calls her a Seiyuu-Artist. No because she sings and dance in lives doesn't mean she's automatically an idol, you dumb fuck.</br>  <br>And we should take the yuri talk to /u/?<br>The Chris imagedumps to /c/?<br>Whether you like it or not, that's not how /a/ as a board works, Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>The show hasn't even aired yet, dumbass. Go bitch somewhere else.</br>  <br>I'd love if that'd happen.</br>  <br>How can you expect multi-track drifting if the train doesn't derail in the first place?</br>  <br>Well how about not having running generals then?<br><br>Second season was plagued by uneaded threads when episodes were not out.</br></br></br>  <br>Just ignore it? Or are you upset because whatever shit thread you tried to make got archived with 0 replies? If that's not the case there's no way this affects you. While we can't discuss episodes of S3 we can discuss things related to the show, which includes voice actors.</br>  <br>No no, you have it all wrong. I love Symphogear.<br><br>It's just that there is nothing to discuss yet so it's just a petty circlejerk with no real meaning.<br><br>I mean hype treads are alright but having multiple threads daily and even having those dreaded "edition" threads just takes away all the fun in hyping an anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just let them be if they want to discuss Nana. Hate it or not, Nana is related to Symphogear and its inevitable that someone will bring her name on these threads at times, that is one of the ordinary things in these threads, if they want to discuss her let them be, once GX airs we'll go back to Symphogear with minimum amount of Nanaposting anyway. <br>Also, stop saying things like Nana is a piece of shit, if she doesn't exist and advertise this show, this show wouldn't have existed at all. If you love Symphogear, learn to respect Nana.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear is more than just Nana anon.</br>  <br>Good thing we don't discuss only seiyuu in these or the /m/ threads then.</br>  For sake of appeasing anon, has there been any new info or comments from the pre-screening besides plot spoilers and  Chris-chan cute ?<br>Anything on Aoi/Nana's blogs, twitter/etc about the show?</br>  <br>Yes, but she's one of the major factors why this show sells.<br>She is one of King Records' top seller, and she's literally at the top of the voice acting industry today. No matter how hard you push Aoi Yuuki, she doesn't have the same popularity as Nana's even if you combine Takagaki Ayahi's fans too. I'm not biased, I'm stating this with references surveys about favorite VAs.<br>So basically my point is, yes, its more than Nana, but let's be honest, if we replace the cast with literally who's this show wouldn't have sold at all.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't have cared if she were in it or not, sales don't mean shit to me. I just enjoy it.</br>  <br>I don't know about Aoi, but Nana's very busy with her live rehearsals that her blog updates is one or two days late.<br>I think Re birth day preview is coming soon.</br></br>  <br>Aoi has not written anything on her blog, and Nana wasn't even in the event.<br>Most you can do is fish for comments in twitters from some of the 500 people that attended the event. We posted translation for a few of them some threads ago.</br></br>  I was watching my twitter feed for any Aoi news, and noticed that they uploaded "Best Of" scenes in the official Symphogear youtube channel.<br><br>https://twitter.com/Anime_Voice/sta<wbr>tus/616229297229967360<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS<wbr>ECkCuFpjNrO9CQ-uvQqcg/videos</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> I think Re birth day preview is coming soon. <br>I think it was tomorrow actually<br>Correct me if I'm wrong</br></br></br>  <br>Are they region blocked?</br>  <br> Aoi <br>Nothing on her blog<br> Nana <br>Very busy with rehearsals, the start of Live Adventure 2015 is after the day GX airs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently they are.<br>Each seiyuu selected a favorite Symphogear scene, it seems.<br>For example, Ishikawa choose Genjuro VS Fine.</br></br></br>  <br>What did Chris' VA pick?<br><br>Also I have to say, Aoi and Nana are very well known, but Chris is someone I don't recognise so well, dspite her amazing talent. What are some other good anime I can hear her in (idealy singing)?</br></br></br>  <br> tfw most of Nana's fans don't watch her anime </br>  <br>Just listen to her albums.</br>  <br>What is the gear trio's favorite?</br>  <br>I can't into moon, but in case the titles have the VAs name in them</br>  <br>Episode Heart-attack of G, judging from the thumbnail.<br><br>You should know.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the mainstream fans like her mostly as an artist and not a seiyuu.</br>  <br> Hibiki rekt Chris with that same move  <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br>  Has there been any sort of character rankings since G ended?  <br><br>Give me a second and I will check all of them.<br> Nana <br>Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki<br> Ayahi  <br>Classroom Monochrone<br> Ao-chan <br>The entire Synchrogazer scene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're all choosing scenes with their own characters <br>They really love their characters. That makes me fluffy inside</br></br>  <br>Those are probably the only scenes they can remember.</br>  <br>Anon don't be rude</br>  <br>Don't ruin anon's fluffy moment, anon.</br>  <br> Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki <br><br>Aw yes this scene is finally on youtube it was one of my favorites. She gets over shadowed a lot but she is probably the most skilled fighter of the bunch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EcH<wbr>REFFvrGY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>   That one guy whose favorite scene is Chris' transformation sequence   <br>Aoi said she and Iguchi all choosed the same scene where Hibiki fought Miku in S2E10, but the rule is one people one scene.</br>  <br>Such good taste.</br>  <br>Someone I can relate to.<br><br>Did Sugita pick one? I really want to know.</br></br></br>  <br>Main animator Shikichi is always a Chris fag since S1. Most of Chris' scenes were drawn by him including that sequence.</br>   Kayano <br>DMJii at the school festival.<br> Iguchi <br>Rainbow Flower.<br> Hikasa <br>G finale scene when all the girls talk together near the end.<br> Kaneko  <br>One of those cute OVA specials.<br> Jesus Yamato <br>Tsubasa's speech during her concert in S1.<br> Ishikawa <br>Genjuro VS Fine.<br> Nana <br>Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki.<br> Nanjolno <br>Shirabe and Kirika mutual confession.<br> Ayahi  <br>Classroom Monochrone.<br> Ao-chan <br>The entire Synchrogazer scene.<br> Katsumi Ono <br>Maria singing Ressou Gugnir and going against Noise in the tower.<br> Agematsu <br>SHINFOOOOGIAAAAAAAA<br><br>There are few left out that are either animators, artist for the manga, etc<br> No Sugita or Sawashiro <br><br>What would make you believe that?<br>Seems specially incoherent when for example Aoi remembers the cantonese lyrics for Eiyuu Koji of all things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No Sugita or Mom's VA.</br>  <br> Ogawa's favorite is Tsubasa's speech in S1 <br>Sasuga prodyuusaa-san.</br></br>  <br>Well, Soichiro and Sugita are hardcore Nanafags.</br>  <br>There is a comment in the keyframes book where they said they all worked extra hard on the monochrome scene and did it all for Chris-chan.</br>  <br>That's so cute.... what a lovely bunch. I hope Chris is loved in GX too.</br>  <br>I want to fuck the dess out of her.</br>  <br>Soichiro is? I know Sugita is one because he's on the damn POP MASTER PV and he really talks about her and even makes fun of her songs sometimes. Too bad he'll forever be Sugita-kun to Nana.</br>  <br> Souichiro <br>Ninja, or Jesus Yamato's VA.</br></br>  Get to dancing, niggas.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r6w<wbr>2mTa_zMA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yes I know who he is, I'm just surprised to know he's a hardcore Nanafag like Sugita.</br>  <br>Because he just confessed it this February.</br>  <br> Nana dance lessons <br>Wow, I haven't seen these since Live Academy.<br>You should send that to Nanoha threads since its Angel Blossom.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow, no wonder I didn't knew about it. What did he say exactly?</br>  <br> You should send that to Nanoha threads since its Angel Blossom. <br>But we're all nanafags, and its a nana song.</br></br>  I want to get into Nana<br>Which live do I watch first?</br>  <br> all Nanafags <br> Did you forget some people here are Aoifags and some people hate Nana for being popular or something?</br></br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br><br>Live Grace 2013 Opus II is my personal favorite.</br></br>  <br>I'm not<br><br>I'm here mainly for action, not songs</br></br></br>  <br>Not too much. He said he always sings Nana's songs when he goes to Karaoke or discuss Nana's songs a lot at party.</br>  <br>Maybe Live Union 2012, that was a nice concert.<br>But my favorite as of yesterday is Live Theater Acoutic 2015, because that's where you'll really know Nana isn't only good because of wubwubs and technical accompaniment.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So how is this any different from Funi subs?</br></br></br>  <br> So how is this any different <br>They exist?</br></br>  <br>Why do i feel like there's romance flags getting set?<br><br>Each Nana live has a theme of its own. For example, in Live Flight 2014, Nana really used the concept of flight and she even "flew" which caused her to get sick, in Live Theater she used the concept of a theater, formal and stuff. Live Academy, she made videos teaching dance lessons and shit. There are many to choose from, look at Wikipedia, choose one Nana concert you think sounds interesting and watch it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was asking in general quality with previous funi subs.</br></br>  <br> romance flags <br>You know when Nishikawa had a duet with Nana 2 years ago lots of Nana and Nishikawa fags thought the same thing right?</br></br>  <br>I prefer NanaXHikasa.</br>  <br>Yukarin fags will riot then.</br>  Just watched both seasons. Wish I had watched them with you guys.  <br>TMRxNana duets are great. They should do one again.</br>  <br>You are in time for S3 at least.</br>  <br>Please explain how anything in that statement makes them like funi subs. Or do you just love when commie localizes rice balls into jelly doughnuts.</br>  <br>Welcome to Nana's wild ride</br>  <br>It was better times.</br>  <br> I'm really really bothered by her crooked right incisor. I can't help myself but stare at it all the time and then feel bad about staring at it. Why hasn't she had braces to fix it yet? </br>  <br> make a live tour named Fly Fly <br> doesn't sing Kindan no Resistance <br>Nana a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Kindan no Resistance didn't exist yet.</br>  <br>It's kind of cute though.</br>  <br>This series' hype train is off the charts</br>  <br>How? Was the concert in january?</br>  <br>Is there one for S1?</br>  <br>Live Flight was in summer 2014 wasn't it? Cross Ange was in October.</br>  <br>But she sang it in the Singapore concert.</br>  Rebirth-day when  <br>But they should have recorded the song earlier. Like months earlier. I just don't know why they made the reference then.</br>  From 0 to Madoka, how much suffering is there in this show?  <br><br> Use proxmate, my fellow german. </br></br>  <br>I'd say about 3.<br>There's light suffering but it's all overcome with fighting spirit and hotblood.</br></br>  <br><br>They say it's going to be darker this time, so more than in S1 and S2.</br></br>  <br>It's hard to pinpoint it on that scale, however<br>1 = SOL<br>5 = symphogear<br>7 = Madoka<br>10 = YuYuYu<br><br>It has it's brutal suffering moments, but friendship and being true to yourself wins everytime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YuYuYu more suffering than Madoka </br>  Some what related question, anons.<br>How many here also enjoyed the following: <br><br>-Gerren Laggan<br>-Metal Gear Rising: Revengence<br>-Kill la Kill<br>-Ace Combat Games</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is left? I just saw this episode and cannot clearly tell. Is it the new, pink concert/symphogear girl?</br>  <br> 10 = YuYuYu <br> Didn't YuYuYu cop out at the end? </br></br>  <br><br>Gurren Lagann was okay but not as good as Gainax's earlier works like Gunbuster or Blazing Transfer Student<br><br>MGR was alright but too short. Wonderful 101 was better.<br><br>I only watched KLK because I needed something to fill the void after G ending<br><br>Ace combat is alright, but I need to play it more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her sister.</br>  <br>I can't see the point.</br>  <br>Holy shit I butchered the Gurren Lagann.</br>  <br>Yes, and I guess I should have kept it at the 9 that I originally typed. but still,  did you see my awesome fight? </br>  <br><br>Except he's right</br></br>  <br>Re is the worst offender.</br>  <br>That cop out was a cop out, based on those new LN chapters, the suffering's gonna continue.</br>  <br>Each has either a great over the top action and/or great ost.</br>  <br>Oh, then I enjoyed MGR. But I thinl Bayonetta is more fun.</br>  <br>Except YuYuYu's suffering was pretty much erased at the end. Even Madoka pre-Rebellion had more suffering by the end with Sayaka. Rebellion took it to a whole new level though.</br>  <br>How is this related?<br> GL <br>Pretty damn good, but ultimately a worse Getter Robo that was lucky enough to get proper budget/staff<br> MGR <br>Amazing. I prefer Ninja Gaiden though.<br> KLK <br>Wasted potential.<br> Ace Combat <br> COME ON!!!!!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except YuYuYu's suffering was pretty much erased at the end. <br>Confirmed for not reading the LN.</br></br>  <br>How so? I thought the cripple punishment was gone for good?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>They're doing a lot of hinting at something being wrong with Yuuna.</br>  <br>haha, okay pal.</br>  <br>Yuuna might be 0% human.</br>  <br>Gurren Lagann is really enjoyable, though  I need to actually finish it <br><br>I need to play MGR, because it looks like the kind of game that I'd really enjoy<br><br>I wanted to like KLK, but everything felt so horridly watered down compared to his other works and especially to Symphogear that I couldn't enjoy it, even after waiting a few months and watching again <br><br> Never actually played any Ace Combat games </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> felt so horridly watered down compared to his other works <br><br>What this about? Who? Did I miss something?</br></br></br>  <br>Gurren Lagann - 8/10<br>MGR - 9/10<br>KLK - 5/10<br>Ace Combat - 7/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are KLK and Symphogear created by the same guy, or did I misread your post?</br>    <br> might be <br>And Homura IS 0% human. What's your point?</br></br>  <br>MGR seems like the perfect Tsubasa game.<br> cut up noise and other monsters <br> superhuman stunts <br> boss battles have your theme song with lyrics popping up at the finales <br>Only need to add attack cards when you do a special attack.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> -Gerren Laggan <br>Imaishi is just fucking garbage at storytelling. <br> -Metal Gear Rising: Revengence <br>Not Platinum's best, but still enjoyable.<br> -Kill la Kill <br>Terrible. All the stuff I hate about Imaishi in one show.<br> -Ace Combat Games <br>Never played them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm probably in the minority, but KLK felt watered down in comparison to Gurren, PSG, and Dead Leaves.<br>Can't really explain it properly, but it didn't feel like there was as much feeling put into it or something pretentious like that<br><br><br>You misread it, I meant to say it that felt watered down in comparison to Symphogear, as well as his other works</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka's suffering wasn't as dramatic and hard hitting as YuYuYu's. In Madoka, character's got the salvation of death, some pretty early, and therefore can't be subjugated to more suffering, but the Yusha's had to live on, each suffering for themselves and eachother.  DID YOU SEE MY AWESOME FIGHT?  Even with their daijoubu ending, YuYuYu was better.<br>Rebellion's only quality as a chinese cartoon movie, is being aesthetically pleasing.</br></br>  <br>TTGL - 6.5/10<br>MGR - 3.5/10<br>KLK - 6/10<br>Ace Combat - N/A</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The offering system is gone, but that also means that the protection from the fairies is gone.<br>The future lies in a mass-produced system that has more heroes which are less mighty and more vulnerable.<br>There's tons of suffering potential in there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Suffering for the girls was kinda the same. Turning into witches vs. becoming a full on cripple is equally shit. Although if post anime yuyuyu actually got rid of all the sacrificial lamb stuff aside from the usual child soldier danger then the wraith filled Madoka world is more shit.<br>If you take the whole state of the world as we know it into account though, then Yuyuyu definitely wins on the suffering scale just for being indefinitely on the brink of full annihilation.<br><br><br><br> Nice.  <br>I should finally start reading them. Although does this just concern Yuuna or is it implied that this will be a side effect for all the Yuusha who got something back?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>11Eyes had more suffering than Madoka. G'enei too but sadly it was retconned in the end.</br>   YuYuYufags actually think their show is better than Madoka   <br>That wouldn't even be much of an achievement.</br>  <br>I want them to leave.</br>  Can we please talk about Symphogear again?  <br>Tsubasa a perfect</br>  <br> MGR 3.5/10 <br> 3.5 <br>Well that is a first for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I know I'm in the extreme minority and I can easily see why people loved it, but I myself just...didn't.</br>  <br>Symphogear virgin here. She seems to be best girl from that image. Is she bullied for her bust size? It is important.</br>  <br>More suffering != better show.<br>Madoka had a flawless story.<br>Symphogear is still better than both combined.</br></br></br>  <br>In universe or the fandom?</br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br> Officially she is a B81 though... </br>  <br>Tsubasa is pretty best, but everyone else is too.<br>Full scan of this when?</br></br>  <br>Im universe, no. Fandom, occasionally.</br>  madokafags pls go  <br> Perfect <br>While she's the best Sympho, I wish she was  more  flat</br></br>  <br>We are just Aoifags.</br>  I'm glad that even in a symphothread we can all agree that Pleiades &gt; symphogear &gt; yuyuyu &gt; madoka.  <br>No.<br>Symphogear &gt; *</br></br>  <br>But does pleiaedses has mechs?</br>  <br> Madoka had a flawless story. <br><br>No. It was a cop out from a good ending into more grimdark shit that became Rebellion and which ended even worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Are we really so bored that we have to start this kind of shit now?<br><br><br>Does car advertisement count?</br></br></br></br>  <br> symphogear &gt; yuyuyu &gt; madoka &gt; pleiades <br>Now it's correct.<br><br>Only really fault of Pleiades to be below all other shows is that main girl has a boy love interest who looks like a girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Does car advertisement count? <br>It didn't have any though. It has astrophysics though.<br><br><br>And unlike any pairing in any of the other shows they actually kissed. Having a guy who looks like a girl kissing another girl is the closest you will ever get to a yuri kiss in any of these shows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How was the original anime a cop out from a good end? The movies were shit and Rebellion a simple cash grab and sequel hook that has yet to produce a good follow up and I hope that no one actually means those when they talk about the series.</br>  <br>If there's really nothing to talk about until we get for information, there is no need to start this shit. <br><br><br>Completely disgusting /u/ mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if the car can transform into a bipedal robot.</br>  <br>I thought their staffs, brooms, whatever were kinda related to the cars or something?</br>  Stop talking about other shows you fucking faggots.  <br>Be the change you want to see</br>  <br>They were, but apart from the car-sounds they made it never played any role. It never tried to advertise anything at all.<br><br><br>By leaving Homura behind and putting her into another stupid world where she had to continue fighting. Madoka should just have taken her with her when she became a goddess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine. Lets talk about why FIS is better than the original trio.</br>  <br> Only really fault of Pleiades to be below all other shows is that main girl has a boy love interest who looks like a girl. <br><br>Yeah, that was some pretty shitty pandering a whole useless part of the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> I hope that no one actually means those when they talk about the series. <br>No, don't worry, they don't.<br><br> Yeah, that was some pretty shitty pandering a whole useless part of the anime. <br>I really honestly hope this is supposed to be sarcastic, and not a serious post, because this shit is faceook-tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pandering <br><br>Stop using words if you have no clue what they mean.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does this even mean?</br>  <br>Surprisingly, I unironically agree.<br><br>Maria, even in her normal 'boring' state, is someone I would really enjoy spending time with, and when she's faking her cool persona she's great to watch. I like how protective and caring she is, both in general and towards the two idiots, and I don't mind her being cowardly, as her less active approach to life is one I myself prefer over, say, Hibiki's.<br><br>As such, because I'm just as boring etc as Maria, it comes as almost no surprise (despite my usual hatred of lolis and lolifags) that I really really like both Kirika and Shirabe. Yes, Shirabe is currently my least favorite of the GEAHs, but not only is it for completely understandable reasons, but I can see her getting quite a bit better with some more time in the spotlight. Kirika, on the other hand, is pretty much the best kind of child a parent could ever hope for, and given my strong desire to be as good a parent as possible, the DESSfag easily skyrocketed to the top for me.<br><br>That's not to say that I have anything against the main trio though, as Tsubasa and Chris are both very well written and exceptionally lovable in their own right, and I would currently put them tied at second best. Hibiki, on the other hand, just doesn't cut it for me currently, and I really hope that won't damage my enjoyment of GX.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Re-birthday that aired on Ayahi's radio show is not full version.  <br>Still want to hear it.

I think I'd put YuYuYu a bit above it though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pleiades was great <br>I don't deny that, still it didn't move me as much as Madoka or YuYuYu at the time when it aired, and wasn't as guilty fun as Symphogear was every season.<br><br>Still better than Wixoss, Precure series or that tarot card magical anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I'm not really feeling it yet. Meteor Light is still the best.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/cvnhst.mp3</br>  <br>It was probably because Pleiades is actually a mahou shoujo played completely straight, which is really rare these days outside of Precure. There wasn't any suffering outside of maybe episode 10. The series is worth watching just for Stella-rium though.<br><br>Wixoss had potential but there was just too much stupid shit for me to enjoy it completely, plus they didn't focus enough on why Ruu was so obsessed with battoru. And Spread was retarded. Both seasons had god-tier OPs though.<br><br>Haven't watched Precure but I heard that Heartcatch was the darker and edgier season that's been a tough act to follow, and the subsequent seasons have been mediocre or otaku-pandering like Smile. <br><br>CHICKEN SALAD had some good ideas and designs that were ruined by a retarded committee, and I don't think it was ever able to shake off its status of "Madoka ripoff" like YuYuYu was able to. It's kinda sad that the producers were clearly expecting it to become a big hit.<br><br>Also to keep it Symphogear related:<br>Synchrogazer &gt; Exterminate &gt; Vitalization</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing it did better was characterization.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br>I liked the premise of the suffering more than "Aliens need little girl suffering energy". Also the world was more interesting as well.</br>  <br> Heartcatch was the darker and edgier season <br>That's the stupidest shit I've read all day</br></br>  <br>Genei had actually been in development since before Madoka. Whether the entire story was planned before Madoka or after/influenced by it is unknown. As for YuYuYu, even the staff said it was compaired to Madoka a lot and so they had to try to be different. The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever.</br>  <br> The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever. <br>Haha, oh wow.<br>People like this exist?</br></br></br>  <br>YuYuYu was actually better than Madoka in some ways though (mainly characterization) and it actually doesn't share much with Madoka besides suffering and some slightly similar character designs.</br>  <br>Yuyuyu played up it's Madoka similarities and used them to set up plot developments that people really didn't expect.</br>  <br> I've read loose summeries based on questionable translations  <br> tells others to read the LN  <br><br>Don't bring that shit here, YuYuYu has a thread up all the time if you want to shitpost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they were so unexpected they ruined the whole thing.</br>  Can Yuyuyu fags discuss Yuyuyu in Yuyuyu thread?  <br> YuYuYu has a thread up all the time <br>Really? Fucking cancer.</br></br>  <br>I liked the premise of Madoka more than "God takes away bodily functions chosen by the writers for suffering". The imouto losing her voice just felt too manufactured. So, opinions I guess.<br>The world was more interesting, I'll agree, but Madoka was never about that. But sure, I'll give you that one.</br></br>  <br>Because both don't have yellow senpai-type characters that go crazy when they learn the truth, right?<br><br><br>I'm surprised there isn't one up right now. They love to make back to back never-ending generals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>S2 when?</br>  <br>It's mostly YuYuYu haters AKA Madokafags.</br>  <br> The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever. <br><br>So is yucky tuna the hipster Madoka of Evangelion?<br> Also I never really felt the similarities that much, but to each their own if they feel the need to compare every mahou shoujo to Madoka nowadays I'll let them be. </br></br></br></br>  Symphogear - when mahou shoujo gets physical<br><br>Pleiades - when mahou shoujos are all pacifist<br><br>Wixoss - when mahou shoujos tried playing Yu-Gi-Oh<br><br>YuYuYu - when mahou shoujos need to change their smartphone<br><br>Madoka - when mahou shoujo burns out<br><br>They're all about mahou shoujo, turn off your brain and enjoy the girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  SO HOW ABOUT THAT SYMPHOGEAR GUYS?<br>I HEAR IT'S STARTING IN LIKE TWO DAYS.</br>  <br> Symphogear - when mahou shoujo gets physical <br>I want to see mahou shoujo go mental. Anything like that?</br></br>  <br>What a childish mentality.</br>  <br> all the time <br>like once a week maybe.<br>It just looks like there is one all the time because it gets bumped for 3 days.<br>Beside that we all are quite disciplined to do it only once a while</br></br></br></br>  <br>Less than 48 hours now.</br>  <br>I tried saying something, but everyone else was too busy arguing about other things.<br><br>Then again, is there even anything to comment on yet? Re-Birth Day has been uploaded and it's good, but that's about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Wixoss.</br>  <br>Yeah sure, all those yuyuyufags in here are totally just flaseflagging madokafags, right?</br>  <br><br>Just fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand this mentality at all. Just because you're a huge fan of something, doesn't mean you're required to hate something else which shares similarities or extreme differences<br><br> Madoka haters aka Symphofags <br> MANIME haters aka CGDCTfags <br> Lucky Star haters aka TTGL fags  <br>etc.<br>It's retarded. Pidgeon holing people like this is stupid as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking more traditional mahou shojou. Like a show where the whole group is like Mami after she breaks, but with their own quirks to set them apart.</br>  <br>/a/utism.</br>  <br>Look at all the "lol they think they're think is better than Madoka" posts. It's most of them.<br><br>Reading comprehension. "Mostly". There's also YuYuYufags.<br><br>Now everybody do this or talk about Symphogeah now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you'd read my post then you'd see that I admitted that the two shows share some character designs, mainly Fuu/Mami and to a lesser degree Tougou/Homura. And even though both Fuu and Mami go crazy upon learning the truth, what they do afterward is different (Mami tries to commit triple murder-suicide, Fuu goes into open rebellion), and Tougou and Homura are completely different characters.<br><br>Also the multitude of YuYuYu threads lately is because there's new material coming out, just like there's more Symphogear threads in anticipation of GX.<br><br>Can't somebody just love both Madoka and YuYuYu? And Symphogear too? Not Gen'ei though, fuck Gen'ei.</br></br></br></br></br>  This thread reminded me that I should watch YuYuYu off my backlog.<br> After I finish Sora no Woto </br>  <br>Insecurity in their own tastes and a need to downplay those who enjoy something else for not enjoying their favorite things instead? I mean, I have no love for Madoka and I used to be that kind of person, but it got pathetic after a while.</br>  <br>Just stop already.</br>  <br>I'm mostly talking about the ones that keep posting shit about people that think YuYuYu is better than Madoka. That's also pretty stupid.</br>  <br> Sora no Woto <br>Great. Can we at least shitpost about that instead?</br></br>  <br>  Not Gen'ei though, fuck Gen'ei. <br>You shouldn't say this just because Gen'ei has the smallest fanbase among these shows anon.</br></br>  <br>Aoi Yuuki once again voices best girl<br> I JOE YOU JOE </br></br>  <br>Go away.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yeah and that mostly is totally bullshit when half of the posts are from Yuyuyufags going on about how much superior their show is. If you faggots want to circlejerk about Yuyuyu that much or start Madoka vs. Yuyuyu shitflinging feel free to make an appropriate thread for it instead and stop shifting the blame.</br>  <br>You could also stop. Just an idea.</br>  <br>I love all 4 and there is nothing you can do about it</br>  <br>Fat ass. I like it.</br>  <br>But Yuyuyu has no Ao-chan.</br>  Describe bikibutt.    Cute girls being cool as fuck is the best shit  Show power rankings aside, we can all agree that Mahou Shoujos are only getting better, right?  <br>Your post implies a power ranking.<br>Just fucking stop.</br></br>  <br><br>Jew Ginka was best gen'ei, you know you can't prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>I still love Cardcaptor Sakura, but yeah I agree.</br>  <br>Round, firm. Absolutely 10/10.</br>  Between<br> mahou shoujo that punch, kick, wrestle, haymaker, dropkick, club, slash, headlock things up close and personal <br>and<br> mahou shoujo that shoot, snipe, blast, nuke, pulverise, evaporate, disintegrate things magically <br><br>which one do you prefer  both isn't an option </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to use it as a pillow</br>  <br>Mecha musume isn't mahou shoujo for me.</br>  <br>The latter, simply because there's more versatility and I find it more interesting. In the end it's not going to matter as much as the characterization, the world, the overall story and the way all 3 are presented.</br>  <br>Second.</br>  <br>I'm not implying by the season, they get better, just in general, from the last 5 years.</br>  <br>Magical beam attacks are pretty boring.</br>  <br>But one without the other is boring.</br>  <br>This anon gets it.</br>  <br>The latter when most of the fighting is going on.<br>The former when shit gets real.</br></br>  <br> 5 years <br>Tiny sample. Worthless trend.<br>You'll have to be more blatant in your shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>The power of interpretive ballet dancing.</br>  <br>Regardless of how long or short that amount of time is to you, the trend is being set with each and every show and there is nothing you can do to stop it. At this point it could take a series of total garbage mahou shoujous shows in a row to break the trend. Not even the shit that is Pisma Illya can stop true Mahou Shoujous.</br>  <br> Prisma Illya <br> shit </br></br>  <br><br>Nobody cares.</br></br>  Radiant force &gt; Exterminate &gt;&gt; Rebirth-day  <br> Mecha musume isn't mahou shoujo for me <br><br>This take your guys magical girl shitposting elsewhere this is /m/ territory.</br></br></br>  <br>Plebs can't handle the lolis.</br>  Why are you guys saying that it starts in 2 days? Isn't the air date suppose to be July 4?  <br>It's July 2 in nipland</br>    <br>Remember timezones and the japanese 24 hour format tv time listing? That's why.</br>  <br><br>Lolis are fine, but Prisma Illya does a terrible job at it's cute/girly/SoL side of it's anime. And the rest was only alright. Fight scenes were cool in season 1, mana transfers were cool in season 2. That's about it.</br></br>  <br> cute/girly/SoL side <br>How so? I mean there isn't really that much SoL anyways.</br></br>  <br>Yes. Even Precure is getting better again.</br>  <br> Futari wa, A's, CCS, Tutu, Rayearth <br>The only thing from the past 5 years that compares to these is Madoka. While I love YuYuYu and Symphogear, things like that doesn't really compare to 90's and 2000's MS.</br></br>  <br>Christ, I should really get to watching GoPri.<br><br>She looks like best girl.</br></br></br>  6 way henshin when  Are the Symphogear threads always this full of shitposting?  <br>Not this kind.</br>  <br>Think of this as the calm before the storm.

Requesting Miia as an Apophis.<br>http://i.imgur.com/EpnOhb3.jpg</br>  Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  Requesting Loki from Boku Girl putting The Mask onto another character of your choice.

Sorry to disappoint, Anon.</br></br>  <br> it's absolutely atrocious <br>Well, yes.<br><br>I was about to say "Don't be afraid to spend more time on the pose to get it right" but then I remembered beginner drawfriends will never get it right and are better off moving on to more studies and practice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's so cute! Thank you so much for this!</br>  <br>This girl is one of those rare characters who always has their eyes shut, and yet is not evil.<br>Look at that smile.<br>She's up to something.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a man, look at that chest</br>  <br>Gin wasn't evil ;_;</br>  <br>I'm not as terrible as that drawing might tell you. I'm certainly not good, but I'm inconsistent. One day, I'll produce shit. Another day, I'll make something half-way decent.<br><br>But yeah, I definitely need to practice more. I'll become a master at drawing yet.</br></br></br>  <br>thanks cyan</br>  <br>I don't believe you.<br>I think you're a liar.</br></br>  <br>All he wanted to do is avenge his waifu being raped by Aizen and his goons.</br>  <br>Ganbarou!</br>  <br>I see.<br> He still hurt a lot of people though. </br></br>  <br>Who cares, they were dicks anyway.</br>  <br>Shoulda sided with Ichigo.<br>He's living his life correctly.<br> Even if his life consists of 350+ episodes/chapters' worth of going-nowhere. </br></br></br>  <br>Hestia plz, no bully.</br>  <br>He was genuinely a dick to Rukia in the SS arc though.</br>  <br>didn't you get a drawing of this already?</br>  Requesting Miia with short but still girly hair, like a bob cut.  <br>Very cutie, Audere.</br>  <br>the toes on her foot are backwards</br>  <br>Is the hood on the Apophis part of her body or ornamental?</br>  <br> I think  it's metal.<br>It certainly looks metal and inorganic.</br>  </br>  Requesting slutty girls wearing slutty sandals to show off their lewd, slutty feet.  <br>Requesting you hang yourself with the slutty straps to those slutty sandals.</br>  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance.<br>Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan</br>  Warmly waiting  <br>And apparently I don't know how to use the [/spoiler] thing without ctrl S, I guess.</br>  <br>I'd like Futayo in a bobcut or something more sporty, but still having her hairpiece.</br>  <br>Seconding</br>  <br>Is this monorus's work?

You idiots always miss out on the best drawfags since they all hang out in the IRC channel.</br>  <br><br>It appears that it is apart of their bodies. It looks to come out of the shoulder blades and extend up to the where the neck meets the back of the head.

The worst they will say is "no".</br>  Requesting fusion of Arata Demon Lord Form, Issei Balence Breaker and Tatsumi Incursio.  <br>Nah, but that's the thing. The worst they'd do isn't say no.<br>The worst that will happen is, they'll say no, so you'll put up your request to the threads at large, and then they'll be like,<br> "Are you that dude who tried to ask XYZfag earlier?" <br>And then it never gets drawn.<br> In other news, I am a very self-conscious man. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a delusional world.

You're right in that the anime never shows any brushing but its heavily implied that brushing did take place. The gif I was thinking of is more of a petting than a brushing.</br>  <br>So this is the secret place where the quality and mass deliveries come from<br>I must lurk here for my chance</br></br>  <br>No, that's that other place where drawfags like audere and ycame hang out. This IRC is for the drawfags that don't draw and talk about dicks.

I don't think it's actually physically possible to have thighs in front of of both your lower leg and thigh at the same time without either dislocating the femur or toppling over immediately.<br>The shading feels like pillow shading too, and it is flattening the thighs a lot. The breasts are obviously showing a light source is coming from above, but the bottom half has a light source going straight at them. The two feet also imply two more lights coming from the left and right based on how they're shaded.<br>I'm not trying to bash your work either, the image just shows a lack of specific fundamentals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The pose isn't the most confortable but from what I looked before drawing it it works.<br><br>The shadows are placed totally randomly, I'll give you that.</br></br></br>  any WIPs?  <br>Thats an impressively grotesque dick. <br>Great jobe.</br></br>  It's "end of shark week", not "start of shark week".

Someone once linked a Nip site that matches hentai pseudonyms with the actual actress so you can see what porn they've done, but I lost it when I accidentally my bookmarks a while back. Anyone know the site I'm talking about?<br><br><br>Also goes by Rei Mizuna apparently, probably both pseudonyms too.<br><br><br>She always looks like one of the kids of well-off Asian immigrants I went to HS/college with, liberal but well-done makeup, busy but cute clothing, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to think that Amamiya Sora did. She just came out of nowhere last year with all these leading roles.</br>  <br>That JAV actress has modelled for that Eva clothing line.</br>  <br>She did and it's pretty good</br>  <br>She's cute</br>  She also likes it in the ass.<br>Her ex-husband confirmed it.</br>  <br>Why'd they break up?</br>  So, how's Yukarin?

Not because shes a over-breasted spazz that uses her tits as arms to touch Bell with, but because shes the living embodiment of what the gods were in greek mythology. Jealous over-zealous sex-crazed human-meddling retards who have all the faults mortals.</br>  <br>You are now a Yasuda fan, if you weren't already.</br>  <br>Yozakura gif thread is starting to sound a lot better than this generic bitchingabouthestia thread.</br>  <br>Hestia is actually one of the least sluttiest Greek gods.

It obviously hit one out of the park.</br>  <br>Kotohas the only half semon demon I need.</br>  <br>Best couple</br>  <br>Well, she's supposed to be a god noone wants to follow, it's only natural for her to have such a terrible design.</br>  <br>If people watches the show only for this character design, it is a good character design. Deal with it.</br>    <br> bitching about character design <br> starts by posting a shitty, off-model fanart </br></br>  <br>Someone make it stop already.</br>  <br/>    <br>What makes her bad is her insufferable personality</br>  <br>Big breasts are disgusting.
