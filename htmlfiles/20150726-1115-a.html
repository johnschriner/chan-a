Wasn't so sure.<br><br><br>See how much more helpful a response like that is compared to an insult?</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Adlet as a Yuusha or a Clothe swap between Adlet and Yuuna.  <br>You look like a newfag, so I'll let you in on a little secret. When you request something that isn't anime or manga-related, even shitposting, people here aren't afraid to tell you otherwise. Now, please, kindly fuck off from these threads forever.<br> Also, your reference is shit. </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128577164 <br> Technically they both appear in an anime. <br>Exactly why I wasn't so sure.<br><br> Note that porn requests or multiple girls are frowned upon in waifu drawthreads. <br> Such requests are made in the regular drawthreads. <br>I'd guessed as much, but thanks for reaffirming it.<br><br>Forgive my mistake, if you will.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu from sougou tovarisch in cute frilly swimsuits kissing underwater like the scene from Sakura Trick  Requesting this cutie looking at a magical mechanical vibrator she made with a completely red face.<br>  follow up pic with her using it would also be greatly appreciated  </br>  <br>The world needs more techno witch art</br>  Requesting Slav-Aria squatting on the front of her gondola, holding a Pocky between her fingers like a cigarette.<br>If you could give her a tracksuit patterned after her undine outfit, that would be even better.</br>  Requesting Aoki giving a handjob with her claw hand/masturbating with her gloved hand  Requesting the three Gungnir users from Symphogear Hibiki Tachibana, Kanade Amou and Maria Cadenzavna Eve playing Rock-Paper-Scissors with Hibiki using Rock, Kanade using Scissors and Maria using Paper.

Hope you do one of mine someday.</br>  <br>You still cant keep track of it especially considering you knew it existed in the first place.</br>  <br>Her left tit is too far from her right. It's like she has perma-sidesag boobs.</br>  <br>Amazing work, I'd be extremely pleased if that was my request, and as a fan of Holo I still am!</br>  <br>OR here<br>Jesus fuck, thanks D!</br></br>  <br>uncensored<br/></br>  <br>Do you happen to have a blog or anything?</br>  <br>Amazing work as always, Doyora - keep it up!<br>One day I hope to see one of my requests done by you.</br></br>  <br>2 years later, I'm still not as good as you were back then. But I'm closer.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br>  The softest  The shittiest.  The sexiest.  The best.  <br>Couldn't agree with you more anon</br>  <br>Why? Why'd she win? Why?</br>    KoiChoco TL patch never ever.  <br>This. Fucking bitch ruined the show with her retarded drama. <br><br>Satsuki was the superior girl and should have won.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't someone working on it at some point?</br>  <br>The game isn't that hard to understand, so you can enjoy most of it without knowing moon.</br>  <br>I still like her. Chisato is cute.</br>  <br>One of the worst childhood friend ever conceived. To think that she was much worse in the VN.</br>  <br> To think that she was much worse in the VN <br>She really was. Crazy, jealous, manipulative bitch. And a big sucker for childhood friends.</br></br>  <br><br>Remember, there is ALWAYS worse.<br><br>At least chisato was cute in the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree that Chisato has issues, but that can be moe too.</br>  <br>Meant to quote<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather her older sister.</br>  <br>More like your taste is the shittiest.<br><br>Best girl won who's also best for MC won. Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>MC has self-worth issues, at least in the VN. It's made really obvious in his internal monologue.</br>  <br> Best girl won who's also best for MC won. <br> dat nonsensical sentence <br><br>Typical Bitchsatofag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still being worked on. Just very slowly.</br>  <br>And? Chisato is the type of girl that supports and gives him a push to break out of that. It's one of the reasons why she is best for him. She's always that kind of energetic and thoughtful girl.<br><br><br>You're the delusional one.<br> Calling any girl besides Sensei or Satsuki a bitch <br>Now that's nonsensical.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chisato is the epitome of bitch.</br>  <br>Amazing arguments, you sure convinced us all with that</br>  <br>Watch the show.</br>  <br>Another jewel right here!</br>  <br> denial </br>  <br>You're like the gift that keeps on giving</br>  <br>I can agree that she is the best girl in the anime. It's different in the VN though cause Michiru is best there.<br><br> Satsukifags liking the no fun allowed and manipulative pres with family drama issues over fun and engaging childhood friend who is sweet and a bro, more so after the drama between ber and Yuuki got resolved on both sides <br>I'll never understand this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're like the river that keeps on crying</br>  <br>This anime taught me that I should never, under any circumstace watch the pv for the next episode. The truck-san visit went from "holy shit" of horror to a "holy shit" of anger.</br>  <br>Years later, they're still salty as fuck.<br><br>I love coming to koichoco thread to remind everyone that the best girl won the choco</br></br></br>  <br> worst girl wins <br><br>Nothing suprising really.</br></br></br>  <br>Repeated nonsense is still nonsense. Chisato is the one girl the MC gets along with the most and in good spirits. They act like true childhood friends around each other and you can tell by the way they act around each other: natural, relaxed, and messing around, getting physically rough, and their over-dramatic skits they are fond of playing at the drop of the hat. There's an understanding between them, unlike any other girl.<br><br><br>Well, at least the anime watchers in Japan agree too from what I remember.<br><br><br>Moy tovarishch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Masayuki and Miou were both cunts. Scratch that, everyone besides Miku and and the mother were absolute cunts.</br>  <br>Wow, someone actually read it.<br><br>Miou is probably the worst childhood friend out of anything i've read, the whole route felt like a big fuck you as a childhood friend lover.</br></br></br>  <br>Theorically the editing and translation are done though.</br>  <br>It's been some time since I've disliked so many characters of a single VN. I was disappointed as it was an Akabeisoft2 VN but the Miku route made it a little better. The word"Why" kept floating around my head during the Miou route. Still don't know where they were going with that.</br>  <br>I think the miou route was a extra they added on later and the writer's way to say "FUCK YOU" to the fans. Maybe he didnt want to make her a playable heroine or something.</br>  Satsuki &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * &gt;&gt; shit &gt; Shitsato  <br>They are, it's just that there's one more QC pass through in progress. I'd say full release next month or the month after.</br>  <br>Chisato &gt; * &gt; * &gt; * &gt; Satsuki<br><br>You can't even argue otherwise ITT.</br></br></br>  <br>Satsuki is just superior to Shitsato. Softness &gt; retardation</br>  <br>Wonderful argument, Satsukifag. I never did expected more from you.</br>  <br>Softness trumps everything.</br>  Teacher or Satsuki is a tough call to make, Both are so perfect.<br><br>Long as we can agree that Chisato is the biggest disgusting rotten cockroach that ever set foot in harem land.</br></br>  I don't know anything about this show but is it worth watching for that really soft girl alone?  <br> Lelouch <br>Thanks for confirming that chisato is the best</br></br>  <br>Don't you find it embarrassing that even Lelouch has better taste than you?</br>  Read the guide: buyfag.moe<br><br>Wonfes in a few hours.</br></br>  3 hours  1 hour  Where the boats at?  Now  <br><br>I don't get it.

Wow</br>  <br>I canceled my PO.</br>  <br>I may, I just hate missing it since I've always watched it live myself for years. <br><br><br>Yeah that's what I feared, I'll watch it through my phone but l may have to give up that luxury for practicality and just browse the threads like the other anon suggested.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please no stupid swimsuit</br>  Anyone getting these? Any Canadians getting these?  <br>I read the manga and didn't like it. Wanted to start the anime but haven't for weeks.

There can even be good videogame adaptations, but it's not something that you would normally expect.<br><br>If the vampire is just an old school motherfucker it can be okay. If there's a vampire girl in an ensemble cast like Pokaan it doesn't count as a flag. If the vampire is the protagonist then it's a massive red flag for angst, homoeroticism and edginess.

Chiyo's just going to assume that Hana likes wearing men's underwear unless Kiyoshi wrote his name on them  oh god he wrote his name on them didn't he. </br>  <br>What would be written on that paper then?<br>I doubt it'd be her name.</br></br>  <br>She'll realize he's wearing panties.<br><br><br>Maybe they both have to go with friends? Could be that Risa picked for the two of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>citius altius fortius ,bitch<br>besides, it's an 1 v 1 race, that's plain dumb</br></br>  Are you guys idiots?

I bet she's a land-whale weeaboo, and you also share doujins too.</br>  Anyway, i'm pretty new to this manga, i read the first chapter long ago and then dropped it because i was pretty busy, in the last week i read it all and i coul say, it's a very enjoyable one. People who tell this is just an ecchi manga are wrong, this is way more, i never had a boner reading this "ecchi" it's somethig different, in those absurd situation we had a deep psychological introspection of the character, also the puns are really smart beside the impossible plot, this is a great manga and i think it will lead to some psychological level like Tetsuya Egawa mangas.  Fuck you Kiyoshi, fuck you.  <br>She doesn't have friends or doesn't understand the concept of friends.<br><br>Hana is going to get something to grab Kiyoshi</br></br></br>  <br>I want to see Klutz-chan playing FATAL.</br>  <br>No my fine sir don't call her fat she's only 235! No but seriously I keep mangas and my real life separated, because it's kinda gay and lame to be 19 reading mangas. So the only people who know I do read them are my siblings and they still look Down upon it, I have nobody IRL to talk to about it so here I am<br><br>So just because someone reads manga and is 4chan doesn't mean they have to lead A lonely life or their girl has to be ugly it's all just about how you play it</br></br></br>  <br>Also what's A doujin? I've heard about it but never looked it up</br>  <br><br>Ge the fuck off /a/ until you learn the basics of being here.</br></br>  <br>Why dont you just tell me instead of wasting time posting unimportant shit, if doujin was so basic i would know about it</br>  <br>I've thought about that page a lot this week. Kiyoshi surely doesn't deserve everything we've done for him</br>  <br> biting baits over and over </br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%<wbr>8Djinshi</wbr></br></br>  <br>Finally anon who isn't actually like it's hard to hell a nigga out</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128543039 <br> :S <br> *time to shine Utopia* <br>Oh wow, kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128543039 <br>Nigga he didnt give up the man is busy.</br>  <br>korea bro #2 reporting in.</br>  <br>Prove it with translations.</br>  <br> Ohhh... Hana and Risa are having a showdown. <br> Looks like a skirmish. Cough... <br> As expected <br> It's not that simple... <br> ah Anzu!? <br> You guys might not know this but last year, those two fought... no.. <br> battled <br><br>here's your dirty translations. Like last time, please be patient since i'm not nearly as good as OG korean bro #1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Many thanks Koreanbro, it's ok if they're not completely right, as long as we understand what's happening.</br>  <br>thank you.</br>  <br>Based</br>  <br> ready <br> set... <br><br>Uhh, maybe "battle" might not have been the best translation. I'm gonna change it to "struggle"(?) from here on out. If any other korean bro wants to provide a better word, please feel free to change it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> St- struggle? <br> That's right... Last year during the obstacle course, two people used violence during the competition. <br> At the end of the fight, even though Hana-senpai ended up winning. <br> After the competition, they both ended up being taken away in an ambulance. <br> WHAT!? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Translating gakuto's thing is weird. I dunno if it's my lack of korean prowess or the way he talks but it's funky.<br> My god... fighting with power to influence the cavalry battle... <br> At the first obstacle, ahead of the pack, Hana-senpai and Risa-san arrive at the same time... <br> No! Hana-senpai is barely faster!! <br> Up to here, it's matching last year's record. <br>I'm not really sure how to translate what Risa is saying here. But I think this is correct:<br> Oops, my body is stumbl- <br> ing! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dangerous!! <br> I... I am also feeling a bit wobb- <br> LY! </br></br></br>  <br>Thank you. I hope you continue whenever you're ready.</br>  <br> Those two... How can they possess such physical abilities! Their actions are way above the average person!! <br> Heh heh... That's why those two battling is so much fun. <br> I...is it fun? What's she talking about...? <br> That's right! Their skills are almost even... In the 100m race, Hana-san is a little better. Of course I trust Hana-san will win. <br> Are you done trying to help that fucking pig Meiko? <br> Hah!? You don't need to know asshole!! <br> Vice-prez seriously going all out is twice of that of someone like you <br> Our should I send you to the hospital right now!? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God bless Korean bro  <br> How... <br> How is it that in those specially small gym clothes Hana's wearing... <br> My boxers aren't sticking out...? <br> "Became used to it" was it? <br> Hana-san is... slower than last year's record... by 0.3 seconds. <br> Risa-san's record is a tad bit faster... We're in trouble <br> !? Hana's underwear... <br> Has she really become used to it? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ugh... nice... hip... <br> Ah, have you come to your senses? <br> I'll make you some coffee <br> ugh... where...? <br> Right now you're at my house. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wh...who... are you...? <br> Huh? <br> ...memory loss? <br> You... can't remember me? <br> No... I can remember seeing your beautiful hips... But strangely enough, I can't seem to remember anything else... Sorry... <br> I... <br> I see... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ;/ </br>  <br> It appears that you seem to know me... <br> Can you teach me, who I really... <br> AM!? <br> Y...you're...... <br>  My.... <br> fiance... </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> angry winking face <br>kill you'reself</br></br>  <br>Oh Shit, she's gonna monopolize the assman</br>  <br> How women trap you <br><br>Oh god what a bitch. Shes taking advantage of the memory loss because she knows he drives a lambo.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128546891 <br>And whether there will be a break, please</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128546891 <br>  &gt;--&lt; <br>Go away.</br></br>  <br> lambo <br> expensive <br>good thing women don't know how garbage those "supercars" are</br></br></br>  <br>The bitch lives in a fucking trailer in the middle of the woods. You're damn right a lambo is expensive to her.</br>  <br> Ahaha! Did you see, Hana!! <br> kuh... <br> When bare-foot, I'm the best!! <br> As I thought, Hana-san's condition isn't good! Risa-san's 0.3 seconds faster than last year. <br> However, Hana-san is 1.5 seconds slower!! This isn't good... <br>I'm not sure what Kiyoshi is saying here. So this next part might not be 100% correct.<br> Anzu's underwear isn't as frustrating as Hana's but more importantly. <br> Earlier, Hana's underwear... Her body's condition wasn't in good shape <br> *squeeze* <br> Ah!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ;/ <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128546891 <br>  &gt;--&lt; <br><br>Both of you, fuck off.<br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In what universe are lambos not expensive?</br>  <br>Huh. I don't remember the scene from that flashback (the one with Hana wearing her prison gym attire). When did that happen?</br>  <br> Go away. <br>Why?? Just because I used a emoticon when I did a question? I didn't anything wrong...</br></br>  <br>amazing. Mari and Chiyo's new mom incoming.</br>  <br>Summer. Lurk before posting, retards.</br>  <br>/o/ pls go</br>  <br>Hes probably trying to say that aznu might be wearing something more comfortable than hana is right now since hes trying to understand why hana is behind in the race and it looks like he figures it out in the next panel.</br>   I like the "old" Meiko personality better.   <br>Fuck, translating these long monologues take so long.<br> Could it be!! Hana's underwear. My boxers. Her ass. Up to her ass... <br> Her butt ate it. That's why it can't peak out!! <br>Another bubble(s) that I'm not 100% positive on. Hopefully OG Koreanbro #1 will clarify later.<br> However, even if we can assume that. If she had replaced her panties!? It doesn't matter how much she "became used to them" it wouldn't be as bothersome as those. <br> No.. instead what does she mean by "became used to it"!? <br> Does she mean it's fixed by becoming used to it or is that not it? Shit... I haven't even gotten close to understanding... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ... <br><br>Really? Kill yourself newfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuh... Dangerous... <br> Little by little as we're fighting... <br> My hands are too tied up to fix my underwear!! <br> Uhahaha! Now it's time to crowned the winner!! <br> Hmph... foolish bitch... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's friend, chingu is friend</br>  <br>So does everyone with any intelligence and taste.</br>  <br><br>Are we talking about the aggressive Meiko, or the submissive Meiko?</br></br>  <br> Ah... Risa-san has already arrived at the borrowing event... <br> The difference is 4 seconds! <br> Hana~! Be strong!! <br> Ho eh~~  <br> Pres... I'm sorry... <br><br>So the next line is either:<br> I...feel like I'm going to lose... <br>or it's<br> I... feel like I'm going to throw them off... <br><br> The eating(?) is little by little bothering me... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ack... <br> Hana! <br> This... this is wrong... <br> 8 seconds... <br> Although unfortunate, the difference is now... irreversible... <br> Risa-san is has probably already finished the borrowing part. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wait... Risa-dono is still there! <br> Huh? <br> Risa-dono must not have been able to figure out what she has to borrow? <br> What kind of difficult thing could it be!? </br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the word on the break, ,koreanbro 2.0?</br>  <br> Friend <br>Well shit, I guess other people already figured out what it said.<br><br>Oh by the way, there's a break next week. At least it says "Sorry!!" on the bottom of the page.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The underwear is eating into her ass. That's what some people say when their underwear bunches up and bites deep into their ass crack.</br>  <br> Break <br>Let's see if Utopia can catch up</br></br>  <br>i dont get it, whatd he do wrong there?</br>  <br>Her ass is eating the underwear</br>  <br>Whoops, I accidentally reversed it.</br>  <br>His thought process remains amazing.</br>  <br>Nah, he definitely uses the word "annoying" in there but I can't really understand how he's using it cause there are some parts that I don't really understand and using a dictionary or the ol' google translate doesn't help me with it either.</br>  <br><br>I'll just leave that for personal decision.</br></br>  <br> her </br>  http://yomanga.net/series/Prison-Sc<wbr>hool/chapters/185/1a.php<br><br>chapter is out on yomanga</br></br></wbr>  <br>Seems they have a completely different translator</br>  <br>Hana losing because she can't Kiyoshi go.<br>I can't tell if that's sweet or just dumb</br></br>  <br>But you post about manga on a social network, or am I mistaken "sir"?</br>  Is this right?<br><br>Mari, Meiko, and Kate - 3rd years<br>Hana, Risa, and Mitsuko - 2nd years<br>the boys, Chiyo, and Anzu - 1st years</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> having a 3DPD girlfriend <br><br>Fuck off normalfag scum.<br><br> 19 <br><br>Fucking teens newfags, fucking faggot kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Both ASC and USC are all third years. Anzu is a second year.</br>  <br> requested document not found on the server <br>god dammit what is this</br></br>  <br>More like she's losing, because hiding her true feelings &amp; not revealing the truth...right?</br>  <br> Korean <br> raws <br><br>お？ wasn't aware Prison School was a manhwa. always thought it was made by a nip..<br><br>the more you know</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Hana is a 2nd year. Also, how can Kate be a 2nd year when she was in the same class as both Mari &amp; Meiko?!</br>  <br>It's is a manga. Translations come out in Korean first.</br>  <br>It is made by a nip, but it appears that the korean raws get leaked earlier than the nip raws</br>  <br>I'm the guy who asked, but I think he's right. Anzu is talking about a race between Hana and Risa last year, and she's referring to Hana as sempai, so reasonably, Hana and Risa would be third years and Anzu a second year.</br>  <br>Anzu is a second year. She's Shingo's senpai.<br><br>I'm not sure if Hana's a first or second year. I'm sure her introductory chapter says it.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you remember the house this man lives in, besides how else could he become a school principal. Hell, i bet he's not an actual old money. Maybe he was in some shady shit to make that money, and married a rich girl.</br>  <br>Who the fuck said kate was a 2nd year? Anzu is a second year and she refers to all council members as senpai because they are a grade above her.</br>  <br>Specially when that model, the aventador came out in 2011.</br>  <br>They arent raws you fuck. They are korean scans of the raws that get distributed earlier to them or some shit.</br>  <br>?<br>but then this isn't raw. it's a korean scan<br><br><br>so it's just people misusing words they don't know the meaning of?<br>alright thanks, that makes more sense</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well, since most of the major supporting characters are seniors, it wouldn't be that off of a guess to assume the last chapter will be graduation  <br><br>Yeah yeah, whatever. I fucked up by misusing words, won't happen again</br></br>  <br><br>No but you were blogposting you fucking piece of shit, serves you right for having a 3DPD, fuck off and go back to your shithole  <br>Fucking summer.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, this deserve a spin off series of its own</br>  <br>They school year still has 8 months left. It worries me that the girls coming out of the school will be bathshit insane cat ladies, sad Christmas cakes or cock carrousel riders because of the indoctrination they faced for 3 years.</br>  <br>Completely wrong, Assman will decide to travel the world again and make Mari take his place as Chairman</br>  I'm in love with Hana. What do?<br><br>I hope the anime will be a success and i'll finally get a Hana daki. If not, i will fucking kill myself.</br></br>  We have another break, fuck.  <br>Hadn't the school been girls only for a while before the story starts<br>I guess there's no way to know if Mari's man hating policies were in effect before the boys transferred there</br></br>  <br>same here<br> No Hana daki and Figure on sale <br>why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>This the first year they accepted the boys.</br>  <br>She's the 40th president of the USC. Those school policies were perhaps established there before, and most certainly a derivative of original post ww2 Japanese school codes as the school building is claimed to be 50 years old. That time when the Japanese were under the influence of outdated American moral laws based on the Victorian era such as the censorship of pornography and prohibition of night clubs and dance halls without dancing licenses / running past 12:00 am.</br>  <br>You are lucky, Hana seems to be a parody of the psycho girlfriend who has violent outburst. You could probably get one in the future and ask her to get a straw blond medium bowl cut with bangs, and learn karate.</br>  <br>This fucking site is such garbage. Stop fucking posting it here.<br><br>You can't even access anything beyond page 14, not to mention everything else is wrong with that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fine.<br><br>It's something, it allows us to get a gist of what the chapter is about.<br><br>Also, not sure what you're doing, most people can view past page 14.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything past page 15 404s for me.</br>  <br>there's also that event with a teacher that was mentioned somewhere in the early teacher</br>  <br>yeah same here really gives ya blue balls</br>  <br>Where the fuck did you get 184 from? Apparently most sites only go up to 182.</br>  Have chapters 183-4 even been translated?  <br>yeah try yomanga</br>  <br>it's translated by kore/a/ns and yomanga. Utopia is doing their siesta again.</br>  <br>Much appreciated.</br>  <br><br>Utopia and their fucking hiatuses.</br></br>  <br>it always fucks up past page 14 for me hopefully that doesnt happen to u</br>  <br>What the fuck is this reply? Seriously.</br>  <br><br>both hana daki and figure (preorder) are available</br></br>  <br><br>add .php to the url</br></br>  <br>The hell is this trash even about?</br>  <br>I notice it more now, probably summer. Just report and ignore.</br>  <br>about 5 boys in prisonsent by the USC.</br>  <br>The translation on yomanga is shit. There was a mediafire link with 184 that was better translated. Maybe some kind anon who still knows it will share</br>  <br>A devoted member of the anime club you tried out in middle school that one time</br>  <br>Because her pussy is destroyed</br>  thanks koreanbro 1  <br><br><br><br>Senpai could also refer to someone who is higher than you rank wise, which Hana is. (Not sure if Anzu is still a USC officer though.) Then again, she calls Risa 'san' so yeah...</br></br></br></br>  What's the message? Will Risa-dono be able to decode it?  <br><br>They are all at least second year, because they refer to the contest from previous year when Risa and Hana faced off.<br><br>Besides that, I've seen no explicit mention of which year each girl is taking, apart from Chiyo being a freshman.</br></br></br></br>  So...I can't imagine that this woman is going to let the Chairman stay with her. She's going to want to find out where he works and lives so that she can partake in some of that money. But if he has family the jig is going to be up. <br><br>Yet, if the Chairman isn't there...doesn't that mean that even if the USC loses, that they have really won, because Mari will have to run the school in her father's stead? Will the board even allow that? If Mari were to take over she wouldn't have an issue letting the boys stay, now, unless something happens to be piss her off. Would it be that she found out that her father found another woman? Would it be what happens with Chiyo &gt; Kiyoshi &gt; Hana? <br><br>Or would someone else have to take over the school and create a new council, knocking Mari, Meiko, and Hana off? Also, the Chairman's, Andres's, and Kiyoshi's plots have all been mirroring each other. Are they going to converge at some point? <br><br>I already know that the Chairman and this new woman will not work. I feel that if Risa wins, Hana will lose. If Risa loses then Hana will win.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I went back to reread the beginning and there was no mention of it. I would prefer that they were 2nd years so that this won't be the last year they are all together.</br>  <br>I went here because it looked like there were two dildos going you know where.</br>  <br> Then again, she calls Risa 'san' so yeah... <br>oh yeah, that's true.</br></br>  <br>Its the raws of the official korean veesion</br>  Personally, I kinda hate it when people compare this to Nisekoi. It's not anything like it. I don't even understand how anyone can bear through that story. To me, Prison School is written (and drawn) way better.  <br>Who the fuck compares it to nisekoi? They'd have to be fucking retarded.</br>  I don't understand what the deal is with the box and the piece of paper Risa got  <br>She needs to find a friend. She has no friends.</br>  <br> Sorry there's a break next week. </br>  <br> 食い込んでも食い込んでも <br> 먹어치워도먹어치워도 <br>lel shit translation.</br></br></br>  <br>My fellow trilingual brethren.</br>  <br>if they came out they will, maybe... not<br>of course they will</br></br>  <br>Based back up Korean bro to save the day</br>  <br>Some guy tranlsated from jap. raws last week. <br>try to find link in previous threads.<br>unfortun. there is no 183</br></br></br>  Why did Gakuto went after the Prez?  <br>Anime only-kun, please.</br>  <br>TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE SEARCHING FOR 184:<br/></br>  Volume 18 cover  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Whered you find it</br>  <br>Best girl got 3 covers so far, nice</br>  <br>yeah, they said sorry there is a break.</br>  <br>he needs to de gozaru his zaru</br>  chapter and translation when?   mfw the latest episode   I hope someone gets NTRd soon. I was hoping it would be Hana but it looks like its going to be Fugly once Andre goes back to the vice president.  <br> claims he'll go on a one year hiatus <br> doesn't update his fucking comic 7 months later after he was supposed to return </br></br>  <br>No that anon, but it's up on amazon japan.</br>  <br>How can Hana be NTR'd when Kiyoshi doesn't give a shit about her? It will be Fugly for sure.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi doesn't think of Hana that way, even though he fucking daydreamed about spending his life with her.<br>Risa will likely get fucked over, even if she doesn't deserve it</br></br>  <br>Fuck, I laughed. 10/10<br>This is my new pasta.</br></br>  <br>http://yomanga.net/series/Prison-Sc<wbr>hool/index.php</wbr></br>  <br>I want to see fusion. Between the "Moeko" and "Vice-prez" personalities.</br>  translation and chapter when?  <br><br>right here</br></br>  <br>Did you even read the god damn thread?</br>  <br><br>As you should be well aware of by now, no one reads these threads.<br><br>Most people just write whatever comes to their mind at the moment, which is for the most part "where is the chapter/translation/episode/subs".<br><br>At this point, I'm convinced they are just acting on biological instinct. Their internal clock tells them that it's about the same time the last chapter/episode came out last week, and they reflexively type out the question.<br><br>It's like when a dog starts barking due to some internal mechanism unknown to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People just come here to shitpost, anything related to the actual plot gets flagged as xfagging or just plain ignored</br>  i kind of like the idea that one day both usc and asc graduate, try to start a new life, but somehow always getting involved with the boys in the future  <br>Sequels will be Prison College followed thereafter with just Prison.</br>  <br>and a prequel to the prison arc with a piss brothel arc</br>  <br>I want that too, hopefully as a result of her becoming more mentally balanced</br>  <br>Is that... a Jojo reference?</br>  I was thinking:<br><br>In the beginning of both the manga and anime Kiyoshi said that he:<br><br>1. Wanted to throw his virginity away by April, which I assume was by next year.<br><br>2. He wanted to do a lot of things with girls.<br><br>Number 2 has definitely come true, so it's just a matter of #1 coming to pass. The only problem is that by idolizing Chiyo the way he does #1 can't happen. Even when he was about to make a move she cried so he stopped herself. He considers her pure so it's hard to move forward. In a way, he uses her as a cockblock for himself. <br><br>By doing so he can, also, keep himself above the rest of the boys as he's not 'that perverted.' Even though the Wet T-shirt contest is coming, I assume that by the end he has to lose his virginity...as it's been set up as his ultimate goal. The only reason he might not have achieved this yet is because of Chiyo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kiyoshi isn't going to NTR Hana<br>Chiyo is</br></br>  <br>How can you NTR someone you aren't even dating?</br>  <br> I dont know what NTR is at all </br>    <br>He ended his hand virginity with hana so it's all good.</br>  <br>That entire sequence was great, I hope we get a similar one soon. Maybe when they switch their underwear back</br>  <br>what is NTR?</br>  <br>Can anyone confirmed this is legit?<br>Also   nice Jousuke pose   as expected of best girl</br></br>  <br>Ask your mom.</br>  <br>what is it, really?<br>need to what?</br></br>  <br>I have the feeling half of /a/ doesn't knows it</br>  <br><br>I have a feeling you want to be spoonfed because you can't use google.</br></br>  <br>It truly was. I am looking forward to them exchanging their underwear back assuming that the fact that they are wearing each other's underwear doesn't get exposed first.</br>  <br> What is Google? </br>  How will they handle the nipple scene?  Yusari~n made my heart go doki doki and hit a home run.  <br>Did we really need a new one?</br>  So, what's next episode name?   Ayumi = another Fuko <br> Yusa = another Misuzu/Nayuki <br> Tomori = another Haruhi </br></br>  <br>Haruhi is more tolerable then Tomori</br>  But who was brother?  <br>Yes, it's a fairly popular show and it's the day the episode aired.</br>   speedbro died <br> imouto died <br>This was pretty dark episode.</br></br>  <br>Tomori= Nagase Iore<br><br>shitposting Nao, you should just ignore them.<br>They are mere fanatics, they create useless topics.<br>spoil all the topics in which they participate.<br>always use the same arguments and always post the same images.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else have a slight panic thinking that the student council assisting with the baseball club somehow affected how Hinata ended up in the afterlife?<br><br>Didn't they say all the key series share a universe?</br></br>  OH GOD MAEDA<br>DO SOMETHING</br>  <br>QUICK<br><br>CUE THE DRAMA</br></br></br>  What if Tomori was testing how many seconds Yuu's ability lasted, in order to see if he is improving it in time.  <br>Didn't she say she wasn't sure?</br>  <br>My goddess Yusarin.</br>  <br> sales circlejerk <br>Fuck off. You have a thread to shitpost.</br></br>  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  <br>just kill the loli you fucking stupid jun</br>  <br>What do you call this? A sidetail?</br>  <br>Well, who's stopping you?</br>  This was the worst baseball episode ever. They don't have enough gimmicky characters in this series to make it work.  How do idols attend school in japan if their presence causes this much disruption? And what about them missing time because of work?  I'm pretty disappointed with the backgrounds so far considering it's a P.A. Works show. <br>The city shots in OP and ED are nice, and so was the scenery near the hospital with Nao's brother, but I never really seen anything that would make me pause the episode and take a screenshot like some other shows do. Most background look really simple or artificial.<br>Even Glasslip was much better in this respect.</br></br>  <br>They attend all-girl schools.</br>  <br>Tomori = another Velma Dinkley - Scooby-Doo</br>  <br>Speedslut and Lelouch.</br>  <br>agree, not even close to AB</br>  <br>But there are still girls that freak out over them.</br>  <br>They go to school like normal, there are idols that are able to pass law school entrance exams while doing idol things.</br>  <br>Charlotte best girl</br>  <br>Once again the show gets ruined by it's 13 episode length. With AB they introduced more characters then they could develop and spread out too thin, here they focus on a smaller cast, but can't do as much with them as they would want to.</br>  <br>Well, at least there isn't rape.<br><br>At least in the same quantity.</br></br></br>  <br>When will we get an anime about cute prosecutors?</br>  <br>The speedbro bit was gold, though.</br>  <br>Real life isn't anime.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I want to cum Inside Momo-chan</br>  I don't get why they brought Yusa into their group, her abilities don't seem useful for what they do, and having an idol around only brings attention to them which I imagine they would want to avoid.   guy uses telepathic knuckleball to cheat <br>   loses on a wild pitch <br><br>That's great. As someone who's watched a ballclub with a knuckleballer for 18 years (21 if you count the prospect spot starter) I didn't know if to celebrate or laugh my ass off.</br></br></br>  <br>She was testing if he could use his powers on power users, which was confirmed as not. This also confirms how she's with the scientists or something.</br>  <br>because a group of 3 would be boring<br><br>also her sister is pretty useful</br></br></br>  <br>I believe that's actually one of the reasons they brought her into the team. Her idol charms. Besides, as Misa, she gives the entire team a very defensive stand in case they need to 'fight' something.</br>  <br>Yeah he the only good part of the episode. <br><br>Even Misa who would be the home run batter in this series got gimped by Yusa's body.</br></br></br>   Next episode is gonna be a cliche baseball filler episode, don't expect anything too special <br> "OMG I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE!" <br> Generic baseball episode comes out <br> "What a shitty episode! Nothing happened! Angel Beasts was so much better!" <br>/a/ never fails to show it's autism</br></br></br></br>  Why the hell is this show so goddamn unsettling? Even with the shit we know about the scientists everything seems way too saccharine. For some reason i'm tense as fuck whenever they do things like the imouto's pizza antics or the yusarin magic. Is it because I know Maeda's going to start his wild ride sooner or later?  <br>I mean the pyrokinesis as the ability that's pretty useless. What could they use it for other than torture or threatening somebody? And they seem to be doing fine when it comes to threatening anyway.</br>  <br> Not wanting hot idol and hot idol's hotter ghost sister </br>  <br>He already used his power on Archer-kun before.</br>  <br>3 People is boring and Yusa is pretty much 2 extra characters.</br>  <br> threatening somebody? <br><br>that's pretty much what they do most of the time so it's pretty useful</br></br></br>  <br>An extra dimension.</br>  <br>I get why they are in the show, I just think that the plot reason for it is pretty weak.</br>  They should have focused on the actual Occult Research Club.  I want this guy back.  <br>this, I miss self-inserting in him</br>  <br> Literary has the power to defy physics and create enough kinetic energy to start a fire without having to have direct physical contact <br> Not wanting that person in the league of friendship  <br>Even if the power isn't used all the time, that doesn't mean it's not useful to have it. Is the USA just gonna get rid of it's army because it has nukes?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck the older sister and she reverts back to the younger one when we both cum.</br>  Did anybody else get suspicious that the pitcher didn't actually have any powers and it was his catcherbro that was actually the telekinetic?    <br>Were that the case he would have caught the last ball.</br>   Key show <br> Baseball episode <br>Waa, how fun.</br></br>  <br><br> I like stronger men who have everything planned out better because they represent who I could be if I actually tried in life <br>That is the most unbelievable character. Even the dense virgin character is more believeable. No one in this world has "everything planned" like the Lulu character arch type.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This was a meme episode.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she was in that mode all the time, but I guess we need her younger sister mode for some quality gap moe.</br>  <br>But he didn't have everything planned, are you stupid? <br>He just thought he did, and the episode was presented from his perspective, so as a viewer you might have gotten the same impression.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully this show is on Fatalpulse's radar.</br>  <br>Umaru-chan is.</br>  <br>She could actually make Yusarin's next mixtape even more fire.</br>  <br>Please be true.</br>  <br>And his character changed to more humble after his "precise calculations" failed, just like any person would. Thinking someone would keep on trying to be a strategist at life after being beaten at his own game is stupid.</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br><br> they go after the wrong guy in a future episode and fail to save the guy that actually has powers </br></br>  <br>Ebina, to be exact.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the vagina would tighten and trap your dick from the shock of suddenly finding out she's in an alien situation and has someone inside her. Good luck with limp dick.</br>  <br> Yusa working on rough song ideas <br> Misa possesses her and keeps inserting parts about fire and burning things down </br></br>  <br>God damnit. Why is she so overrated?</br>  <br>poor Ebina</br>  <br> No one in this world has "everything planned" like the Lulu character arch type. <br><br>Anon, you watched the first episode right? You do know that MC is essentially being forced by Tomori to do her bidding since then. <br><br>Anyway, I miss first ep MC, but mostly because of his shenanigans. Now, he can't come up with any crazy shit anymore. But who knows? Maybe once the show gets going around the 6th/7th episode, we'll see him again (or maybe not, since the show's only 13 episodes).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be like carrying around an AK-47 with you at all times since it might come in useful in some situation.<br><br>Even the telekinesis guy would seem more useful and I'm sure they have lots of other people with useful powers at the school.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's the best.</br>  <br> implying that wouldn't make me cum harder. </br>  <br>Fucking hell, I want to see Umaru suffer, Ebina is not deserving of the Fatalpulse treatment.<br><br>My body is ready.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember when people could make their own threads when they wanted to discuss something?</br>  <br>No, you don't understand. A male's penis getting pinched like that while erected would cause the tissues to tear, literary breaking your penis. This would cause sever issues to your sexual life.</br>  <br>And I never said anything about "precise calculations". I don't know why do assume that.<br>I liked the fact that for once we got a selfish asshole willing to ruin other's people's lives for his own personal gain as an MC.<br><br><br>And I want to discuss this show. Where is the problem?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out back to your shithole</br>  <br>I am diamonds.</br>  <br><br> Thinking these charts mean shit within the first 4 episodes </br></br>  <br>All the fault of bitch mary sue.<br>With your child cases of shit every week.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure if you didn't exist, this show would improve significantly.</br>  <br>There is whole containment thread for retards who actually believe that</br>  Speedbro has given so much for the team. I hope he gets the idol ending.  So, can anyone explain to me  the rules of baseball?   <br>Not the same anon, but I can see why some people have a problem with Nao. I really like her as a character, but sometimes she can be very overbearing, and given how it's rare to have an MC that was originally presented as selfish, I somewhat understand where people are coming from when they are complaining about Tomori.<br><br>Then again, I'm more worried about how they're gonna present Nao's supposedly "cute" side, when the show's supposed to take a more serious and dark tone after the 6th or 7th episode.</br></br></br>  Meanwhile the whole experiment thing is still weird. Serious plot element with no romantic meaning, no serious plot element and just romantic meaning, or serious plot element AND romantic meaning?  <br>Based from an interview that was posted last week or two weeks ago, the anime's supposed to be romantic AND serious. How they pull it off when they're about a quarter through is beyond me.</br>  do you think we will see   truck-kun   or   key aids   until the end of the show?   no cute idols on television tonight <br>It makes me sad</br>  <br>Key aids for sure. My bets are on the imouto.</br>  <br>I mean, angel beats did it and most of it was a compilation of comedy skits.</br>  <br> Not best girl </br>  Episodes <br><br> #5 - The Sound I Will Hear Someday<br> Itsuka Kiita Oto (いつか聴いた音)<br><br> #6 - Unnoticed Happiness<br> Kizukanakatta Shiawase (気づかなかった幸せ)<br><br> #7 - To the End of the Flight<br> Touhikou no Hate ni (逃避行の果てに)<br><br> #8 - Chance Meeting<br> Kaikou (邂逅)<br><br> #9 - The World Not Present<br> Koko ni Nai Sekai (ここにない世界)<br><br> #10 - Plunder<br> Ryakudatsu (略奪)<br><br> #11 - Charlotte<br> Charlotte (シャーロット)<br><br> #12 - Promise<br> Yakusoku (約束)<br><br> #13 - Records of the Future<br> Korekara no Kiroku (これからの記録)<br><br><br>The MC retains information of the people he possessed.<br>Nao wants use the power of the MC in your brother, to get information about what happened.<br><br> #5 - The Sound I Will Hear Someday<br>Itsuka Kiita Oto (いつか聴いた音)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> #6 - Unnoticed Happiness <br>Goody by creature</br></br>  <br>Her ED has her eating something in two slides. What a glutton.</br>  <br>That's true. Then again, I don't remember if Angel Beats took this long to set up what was about to happen to the characters or if it was this hard to predict what was gonna happen.</br>  <br>You always need to need your Nao or she'll go hungry</br>  Is it my imagination, or do japanese lyrics and titles tend to be a lot harder to extract their true meaning than English ones? Or maybe it's just bad translations.  I'm not really a huge fan of baseball, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Here's hoping that Ayu would be able to meet Yusa at some point just to see her reaction.  <br> Ayu will possess Yusa <br>How would you react?</br></br>  Who is this guy?  <br>me irl</br>  <br>It's the other way around. MAL is stealing that shit from here. By the way, why were you on that site anyway?</br>  <br> This long <br>Nigga, it's only been 4 episodes. Angel beats was saving the drama like a jew with money.</br></br>  <br>What if Ayu meets Yuusa before she   dies by the hands of the scientists, because MC decided to save Nao instead of his imouto?  </br>  <br><br>Charlotte</br></br>  <br>MC's brother. He has that sharingan ability that traps people in deadly dreams.</br>  <br>Can't blame him for trying not to get diabeetus.</br>  <br>Like I said, I don't remember much about Angel Beats.<br><br>I just really hope they'll be able to pull off the romance and the dark tones in a satisfying way. I just want this show to be successful, because I want my Nao figure.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They won't since its only one cour, if it was two then the pacing would be fine. I thought Maeda said he learned from his mistakes from Angel Beats but I guess not. This will be another show with wasted potential by rushing the ending.</br></br>  <br><br>Whoops accidentally quoted myself.</br></br>  Imouto must get her sauce from Papa John's. That stuff is NASTY. <br><br>Well shit and my captcha had to be of pizza too.</br></br>  <br> This will be another show with wasted potential by rushing the ending. <br><br>Angel Beats was actually okay. Then it dragged on the drama for far too long and did some pretty forced stuff just to get an emotional reaction from the audience. <br><br>I just really want a Tomori figure ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really puzzles me, you would think that after the success that AB was it wouldn't be hard to get the funding for a two cour show.</br>  Misa is clearly the superior sister.<br><br><br>It's the best of both worlds, Yusa cooking something with pizza sauce would be hilarious.</br></br></br>  Oh snap, the MC uses his power up to no good.

Also, my power isn't imperfect.</br></wbr></br>  I'm disappointed in this series. I wanted more of the MC coming up with cool/smart way of using his power, like in ep 1.   people who still want to believe Imouto's gonna be ok <br>Check the beginning and the end of the opening sequence</br>  Will they ever run out of pizza sauce?  <br>Imouto death/kidnapping episode.</br>  <br>That was a mass deletion, not a samefag.<br>I was one of those deleted posts.</br></br>  <br>Shiro</br>  <br> wanting death to imouto. <br>Excuse me?</br></br>  <br> babby's first Key show <br><br>She will magically resurrects in the final episode, faglord.</br></br></br>  The most surprising thing about this show's threads are the people who thought Angel Beats could've been good.<br><br>Anyway, are people only watching to see who eventually dies?</br></br>  So what was the experiment Nao did at the end for?  <br> Angel Beats could've been good <br>It could be at least decent if it was 2 cour.</br></br>  <br>She needed an excuse to hold MC.</br>  <br>Still no clue.

A 34-year-old NEET gets killed in a traffic accident and finds himself in a world of magic. Rather than waking up as a full-grown mage, he gets reincarnated as a newborn baby, retaining the memories of his past life. Before he can even properly move his body, he resolves to never make the same mistakes he made in his first life ever again and instead live a life with no regrets with the new one that was given to him. Because he has the knowledge of a middle-aged man, by the age of two, he has already become a magical prodigy and possesses power unthinkable for anyone his age and even older. Thus begins the chronicles of Rudeus Greyrat, son of swordsman Paul and healer Zenith, as he enters a new world to become the strongest mage known to man, with powers rivaling even the gods themselves.  <br>A Biomega adaptation that isn't a shitty net series like the Blame! adaptation.</br>  Typical shounen nonsense, however it focuses on the daily life of a middle-aged man who lives in one of the cities that constantly ends up leveled due to massive collateral damage from generic shounen fights  <br>I know it's not entirely the same. But Mouryou no Hako covers unit 731 a bit.<br>It's a fairly good series as well.</br></br>  <br>It's the new XDDD spam.</br></blockquote>]
