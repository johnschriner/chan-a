[ TAKANARE  JII BEAT  Gary best doll.  G~BEAT~  Tsubasa's new battle song is the best one even though the lyrics are edgy as fuck.  <br>G-BAIT</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128169623 <br><br>Anon pls.</br></br>  Threadly reminder that Miku is straight  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128169623 <br> The retard posted his twitter shit here <br>Why? Is this bait?</br></br>  <br>Just report it.</br>  <br>Why is Tsubasa so cool?</br>  Reminder thatHibiki has not once ever felt love for Miku.  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>GARIE A SLUT.</br>  <br>SORE WA CHIGAU ZO!<br>That's like saying Komaeda is straight</br></br>  Which main character do you think will get a doll kissu first?  <br>Chris.</br>  MICHA A RETARD.  <br>Gen, and he'll resist it by being true man.</br>  ETA for the next episode?  <br> Miku gets kissed and loses her memories of Hibiki <br> &gt;Hibiki has to kiss her to give her her memories back </br></br>  <br>Blue = Green &gt; Red &gt; Yellow<br><br><br>Not soon enough.  11 hours 45 mins </br></br></br></br>  <br> 11 <br>I meant 23. Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Because Nana willed it this way.<br>It's kinda weird for me because I never liked her that much in S1 and didn't think much of her during G but in the few weeks of hype before GX she just became my favourite character for some reason. Tsubasa is the coolest and most reliable senpai while being cute and shy on the inside.</br></br>  <br>Carol being kissed by all dolls.</br>  <br>Edgy retards are the worst.</br>  <br>24 hours and 40 minutes by my clock.</br>  <br>Retard shark moe</br>  <br>Trust Heart &gt; Beyond the BLADE<br><br>They're both great though.</br></br></br>  <br>That is weird, because she had really good character development in S1.</br>  <br>I didn't get to hear enough of Trust Heart to form an opinion of it. Too messy and too much talking over it.</br>  <br>I come from the future.</br>  <br>Maria, and it'll be the reason why Tsubasa screams so much in ep 7</br>  <br>Wait, Tsubasa's character songs are out?</br>  <br>Wait to see Phara Sword Breaker Tsubasa's Tsubasa in ep3.</br>  <br>I'm really liking Garie's voice.</br>  <br> ep 7 <br>Not soon enough.</br></br>  <br>Will Tsubasa become a Sword Breaker breaker sword?</br>  <br>It's surprisingly erotic, I hope she has lots of lines.</br>  Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist!  <br>Because.</br>  <br>You should go back and rewatch s1. I felt the same way as you until I was reminded of how great she became after ep 4.</br>  <br>Maybe after s3 training montage.</br>  <br>Yellow is the coolest doll though</br>  <br>I can agree with this. The greatest difference I noticed re-watching S1 was my impression of Tsubasa.</br>  SYMPHOGEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR  <br> Garie ganbarimasu~ <br><br>Also, the music box sound when she lands and does a spin.</br></br></br>  Why anon like this slut?  <br>Go to bed Carol.</br>  <br>So far we haven't seen much of her personality.</br>  <br>NO</br>  <br>Because she exterminates people.</br>  <br>Sex voice.</br>  <br>Yes we have. Her personality is that she is just cool as fuck. She's basically Jotaro with coins.</br>  <br>Chris is so cool</br>  <br> She's basically Jotaro <br>Stop that</br></br>  <br>Young, cute, lolita clothes, teeth, sexy grandma voice.</br>  <br>This bitch needs to calm down.<br>I think a couple of head pats should do it.</br></br>  <br>Go to bed.</br>  <br>I really can't take her seriously. Those arm puffs are especially adorable.</br>  <br>literally perfect, considering getting three  even though I'm already getting two </br>  <br>It's cute how she's so mad while having that tiny body.</br>  <br>No, she needs to get angrier. Some of the best moments in anime are when a character is melodramatically yelling the name of something.</br>  <br>and that giant hat is absolutely ridiculous</br>  <br>Because Symphogear GX is a convenient anime for doll loving masochist.</br>  <br>G-BEAT!</br>  Why don't the autoscorers just use their giant forms to kill the symphogears?  <br>Can't lean back on her throne or keep her head level with a hat that large. No wonder she is so mad.</br>  Reminder that Carol's dolls are killing people at her command. She is not your cute daughteru, she is a murderer no different from Ver.  <br>Because that just makes them bigger targets.</br>  <br>Hibiki is top tier anchor in that kusoge</br>  They should swap out the ugly yellow doll for best maiden.  <br>Well, everyone loved Ver too, so that's okay.</br>  <br>go away pls</br>  <br>Uh, why? I don't get it. I thought people liked Jotaro. I know I do.</br>  <br> loving an idiot, who wore a white coat and demanded to be called doctor <br>Shit taste and disgusting.</br></br>  <br>she has a dick</br>  <br>But small girls with braids and bare legs are my fetish.</br>  <br> Sugita <br><br>Your argument is now invalid.</br></br></br>  <br>You have good taste.</br>  B81  <br> he didn't love Ver <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/fkaydeexdq.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br>  <br>Break dance is fucking cool.</br>  <br> Sugita voicing a hilariously ineffective villain who just screams and makes faces <br><br>how is that not great</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night, faggot.</br>  <br>[flats externally]</br>  Which Geah has the best personality?  <br>Hibiki<br>How is that even a question</br></br>  <br>Chris obviously.</br>  <br>Finally some truth!</br>    <br>Ending a sentence with a "?" generally turns it into a question?</br>  24 HOURS.  <br>The promo always looks so wonky to me.</br>      Episode 3 previews when?    <br>22 hours</br>    <br>Why, thank you anon.</br>    <br>The cutest granny.</br>    <br>The biggest loli boobs.</br>  <br>Why is Kirika such a braless slut<br> I love it </br></br>  <br>Isn't she only like a year younger than the others anyways</br>  <br><br>Who is the flattest?</br></br>  <br>Its not flat its aerodynamic!</br>  <br>Yes, Kirika was 15 in G and is 16 in GX</br>  <br>B72.</br>  <br>Shirabe<br><br>Just look at that sword dodge scene in the second episode of GX, Tsubasa might get a lot more clearance than Maria's Marias but there's still something there.<br><br>It's amazing that stunt didn't cost Maria her nipples really.</br></br></br></br></br>  I  didn't really like Hibiki's new song. The whistling didn't even sound that good.   <br>Chris. Not even close.</br>  <br>wow, I didn't know there existed such shit taste.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out and don't ever post again.</br>  <br><br><br>That is quite a size difference there.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Ver so perfect?<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/hpbbtgerat.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that during the next live we will get to hear the entire crowd screaming G-BEAT and I LOVE YOU at the top of their lungs.</br>  <br>Why are you even here</br>  <br>She's only 2cm smaller than Hibiki.</br>  <br>Literally blue Miku, this is going to mean something just wait.</br>  <br>Tsubasa. The way she's chuuni about being a sword is fucking adorable</br>  <br>Cute Tsubasa is a miracle of the universe.</br>  No Kanade, no buy  <br>If he wasn't voice by Sugita it would of been really really bad. He carried that entire shitty character on his back.</br>  I want to be as cool as Tsubasa-senpai  <br>I want Aoi-chan to enter the stage as Nana and Ayahime whistle the intro for her.</br>  <br> not having the crowd whistle it </br>  <br> not both </br>  First season - sing<br>Second season - enemies sing louder<br>Third season - enemies dance<br>Fourth season,, er, rap?</br></br></br>  <br>Bike-kun did nothing wrong!<br> Tsubasa will never care enough for her bike to not crash it </br></br>  <br>I'm trying to learn for G-Beat, but I still can't whistle.</br>  <br>That wasn't her fault. It got hit with at Noise bomb.</br>  <br> it got hit with at noise bomb <br>Holy shit I never noticed that<br>I thought it just randomly broke</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer Nana and Ayahime.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Hibiki so badly.</br></br>  <br>It's the best Hibiki song by far.</br>  <br>Shut up, Miku.</br>  <br>Go home Miku I saw her first</br>  <br> s4 <br>Symphogear series might not end in s3, but Hibiki's story would end in this season. <br>S4 would be a whole new story with new MCs( but also with the same VAs).</br></br></br>  <br> S4 would be a whole new story with new MCs( but also with the same VAs). <br>Nope.<br>Fuck that shit.<br>Symphogear ain't the same without Hibiki as MC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what if the MC was Hibiki and Miku's daughter?</br>  <br><br><br>Maria can be the new MC, I'd love to watch that.<br> The question is if it would still be a badass mecha magical girl show or if it would be a slapstick comedy. <br>No seriously, I love Maria.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No Chris <br>Wouldn't even bother.</br></br>  <br> implying S4 won't be hibiki taking genjuroo's place after he dies in S3, and training the new geahs </br>  <br>It was a terrible idea in Nanoha<br>Why do you think it will be different with Symphogear?</br></br>  <br>So long as we don't get StrikerS-levels of cast bloat.</br>  <br>Source on Hibiki's last story is S3</br>    <br>We'd get a new geah with  Chiwa Saito  and then JAM Project as the antagonists</br>  <br> Is there a version of that edit without the censor bar </br>  <br>I want SoL scenes of Maria babying Kirika and Shirabe  and Tsubasa. </br>  <br> Chiwa Saito <br>Please no, I can't stand her singing.</br></br>  <br>L-like that'd ever happen.</br>  How old is Maria? 21? And she's still a virgin?<br><br>Sad.</br></br>  <br>Says you.</br>  <br>She is an American idol.<br>The possibility she is a virgin is less than one percent.</br></br>  <br> Implying Ver didn't get all up in there </br>  <br>Idols need to remain pure.</br>  <br>What a pleb</br>  <br>to be fair, american idols probably have a better chance at being pure than japanese ones.</br>  <br>Swords are not supposed to blush!<br>This is wrong!</br></br>  <br>A couple months before she becomes 22 too.</br>  <br>By what logic?</br>  <br>I want Tsubasa, Maria, Chris, Kirika, Shirabe, and Elfnein to live in a large shared apartment. <br><br><br>She's one of my favorite VAs, fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  Am I the only that cannot stand DMJii? Shirabe doesn't bother me as much now, as Kirika. Fuck Kirika so much, she was the most annoying shit throughout season 2.  <br> Ver <br>The shit only knows how to tumble on stairs.</br></br>  <br>She's a great VA though and her singing is alright.</br>  <br>Because american idols are slutty because american girls are slutty, japanese idols are slutty because they need to be slutty to get a job.<br>so being a slut is a requirement of a japanese idol, meanwhile an american idol has the same chance of being a slut as your average american.</br></br>  <br> She's one of my favorite VAs, fuck you. <br>She's one of mine too, but I just can't stand her singing voice. I don't like any of her character songs.</br></br>  <br>The sword is broken.</br>  <br>American idols don't sign contracts that prohibit touching a man's hand outside fan events</br>  <br>  "I knew I forgot something this morning." </br>  <br> no </br>  <br>Doesn't Tsubasa have a large japanese mansion?<br>They can all crash there for a while.</br></br>  <br> implying P-san isn't fucking the idols behind the scenes anyways </br>  <br> they need to be slutty to get a job. <br>Source? Also, proof that American idols don't often rise in their careers through sexual favors would be appreciated.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe was the fucking worst with her whole "hurrr ur a hypocrite!" bullshit, she still hasn't redeemed herself for that.</br>  <br>DMJii is olev.</br>  <br>The sword needs to re-forge herself.<br>  BLACKSMITH TSUBAS </br></br>  <br>But they would never-<br>You know what, every idol is slutty.</br></br>   Ando giving out Nicknames <br> Mishira <br> Katsu </br></br>  <br>She is cute.<br>Iisn't that enough for you?</br></br>  <br>Dat flat game too strong though tbh</br>  <br>She's not the one who'll be doing the re-forging, if you catch my drift.</br>  Can someone explain to me why everyone tolerates Tsubasa's sword autism?<br><br>Was she adopted?<br>Where are her parents?</br></br></br>  <br>In the same anime as Hibiki, Chris, Tsubasa, Maria, she's average at best. Too bad, all the rest(except Kirika, who's just as useless and an idiot) are more interesting, and have a better personality.</br>  <br>Saying those stupid lolis are cute in a show with Chris is like saying a candle is hot when compared to the sun.</br>  <br>She can summon swords on command, so I guess it might be difficult to prove her wrong.</br>  What is Phara going to do about Tsubasa in episode 3?  <br>Miku it's past your bedtime.</br>  <br>They tolerate it because its moe.<br>And her idol shenanigans brings in the money.</br></br>  <br>yamato damashii</br>  <br>Swords are cool.</br>  <br>Break the inner sword.</br>  <br>Tougou go be gay in your own show</br>  <br>Don't bully her, her parents are probably dead.</br>  <br>GET MORE OXYGEN IN THOSE SWORDS TSUBASA.</br>  <br> Was she adopted? <br> Where are her parents? <br>Only Kaneko knows. Currently he only told us Genjuro is her uncle and she has a grandpa called Fudo, who is the first commander but also an evil person.</br></br></br>  <br>They are the cutest.<br><br><br>They were more useful than Maria at the very least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would sharpen her tsurugis if you know what I mean</br>  <br>*was</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Why won't Genjuuro contain her autism?<br>Does he care? <br><br>Kazanari's are crazy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>MY GOD SHE HOLDS HER SWORD WITH TWO HANDS THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN COUNTER THIS JUST LOOK AT THE POWER BEHIND EVERY SWING</br>  <br>We can probably assume they're some sort of parallel to Nana's parents.<br>Abusive father who didn't let her have friends and a mother who did nothing about it but loved her nonetheless</br></br>  <br>Genjuuro doesn't act like her uncle. He seems closer to Hibiki than his own niece.</br>  <br>Does a sword have a hymen in both places?</br>  <br>Genjuuro is the most autistic out of all the characters in this goddamn show<br><br>hes so autistic he has broken the laws of physics</br></br></br>  <br>You are talking about the man that gets stronger seeing movies.</br>  <br>Its probably his fault that Tsubasa ends up that way. Too many samurai movies and assigning a ninja to be her manager.</br>  <br>probably because his real niece is just chuu2edgy</br>  <br> They were more useful than Maria at the very least. <br>Really? At what? Getting their ass handed to them? Maria at least went up against Tsubasa on even terms on more than one occasion. Also Maria's decisions throughout s2 might be wrong and ultimately bad, but at least she made a fucking decision and not simply followed for no reason or logic while throwing around idiotic one-liners.<br><br>Don't even get me fucking started on DMJii's fight with each other in the climax of G. The pinnacle of how retarded Kirika is. <br><br>So no, they weren't more useful than Maria, unless by useful you mean fill the loli character position and wasting up screen time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Genjuro is so chuuni that he can wreck relic-users' shit</br>  I want Tsubasa to shove her tang into my hilt<br> Jesus christ, captcha stop with the mountains </br>  <br>SHE USES BOTH FEET TO HELP DODGE. YOU'VE NEVER FOUGHT AN OPPONENT THIS SKILLED BEFORE. I BETTER THROW IN THE TOWEL.</br>  <br>Doesn't seem like her mom cared much about her losing her only friend, being edgy for 2 years or getting hospitalized after nearly dying. I think it's safe to assume they're both dead.</br>  <br>100%. S1 really benefited from a rewatch. The biggest problem getting into it at first is that the tone is all over the place and it's hard to get a sense of what exactly the series is doing, whereas the pieces fall into place much better on the second viewing, because the random stuff that keeps popping in doesn't throw you off as much.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br><br>Shirabe and Kirika could not exist and literally nothing of worth in S2's plot would be lost.</br></br></br>  <br>No wonder Tsubasa ended up as a sword.<br>Her uncle didn't make her watch kung-fu movies.</br></br>  <br>Didn't you see Hibiki's flashback?<br>Japs fucking suck</br></br>  <br>Well if they are alive then that makes them even worse parents.</br>  Will we get<br>SHIMOFOGIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAA again?<br><br>shit never gets old.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I bet Miku sucks really well</br>  <br>To be fair, if they didn't exist Maria would have been defeated in episode 2.</br>  <br>I'm sure you aren't the only one.<br><br>that doesn't mean your tastes aren't shit.<br><br>DMJii a best.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> on even terms <br>don't start this again. Maria could never fight tsubasa on even ground.</br></br>  <br> Maria is defeated <br> moon issue is resolved in 2 episodes <br> rest of the season is cute SoL <br>I wouldn't complain</br></br></br></br>  None of the characters had a stable parents.<br>Jesus Chris.</br>  <br>You could fix that by literally just making Maria slightly tougher<br><br>Bullshit that she had a bigger piece of Gungnir or something, than the random shards stuck in Hibiki.</br></br></br>  <br>Chris is more like Judas but if you think she's Jesus, that's fine too.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Miku did</br>  <br>What if Miku has two moms</br>  <br>It's not that uncommon really<br> at least in burgerland, no fucking clue about nipnongland </br></br>  <br>Her parents appear in a flashback, she definitely has a dad.</br>  <br>On a fair or long fight? Of course not, for a certain time period she probably could. And in either case, still fucking better than Kirika getting BTFO'd in literally 2 fucking seconds before she could even swing her weapon once.</br>  <br>Hibiki seems to have it "best". At least she still has her mom and her grandma<br> Chris <br> both assassinated <br> Tsubasa <br> either dead or don't give a fuck about her, grandpa made her into a child soldier <br> Maria <br> died in war, surrogate mother died in space <br> Kirika and Shirabe <br> kidnapped as children or picked up as orphans, surrogate mother died in space </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it started with an underground military base that recruits students to fight monsters.<br>Not that I am implying a relation to a certain other anime or anything.</br></br>  <br>Kanade, get in the fucking Symphogear?</br>  <br>Is nastasha actually dead? I mean they bothered bringing her body back and everything.</br>  So prediction time:<br><br>Who will be the gayest by the end of GX?</br></br>  <br>I kinda wonder if there really was a deliberate shift in tone from roughly episode 5 on. Before then the show came really dangerously close to taking itself seriously.</br>  <br> she can fight on even ground! <br> just not if its fair or longer than 30 seconds. </br></br>  Friday fucking when.  <br>Aside from Kiri and her bitch? Probably still Miku.</br>  <br> They are the cutest <br>That's objectively wrong.</br></br>  <br>It was Kirika who almost defeated Chris.<br>But it doesn't matter since everyone was cheating, and even then they could only fight for like a minute or less before they were defeated.</br></br>  <br>That, and birds of a feather flock together<br>People with shitty situations are attracted to others like them, since they understand each other and can relate to each other<br><br><br>Nastassja also saved the world. It'd be DISHONORUBU to just leave her corpse floating around in space</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of parents would let there daughter live with a chick that's only good for warming the bed?</br>  <br>My brain says Miku, but my heart says  Maria . I want to believe.</br>  <br>The only reason Maria could even fight Tsubasa "on even ground" was because Maria was pumped full of LiNKER while Tsubasa was suffering the effects of Anti-LiNKER. As soon Maria lost her advantage she got the hell out of Dodge. Even if it were to come down to skill, Tsubasa had been training for years and years while Maria at best had one or two years of training, if even.<br><br>At all points in G the main trio completely outclassed the FIS girls. The only way that the latter ever gained advantages was through trickery or luck, and even that was often subverted by shit like Maria letting go of the hostages or DMJii's constant 1v1 me faggotry.</br></br></br>  <br> chick </br>  <br>Maria once she realizes she has a chance to be with the sword.</br>  Will giant Lieur fire off giant coins while breakdancing?  <br> DMJii's constant 1v1 me faggotry. </br>  <br>  BELIEVE IN JUSTICE WITH THE DETERMINATION TO FIST!  </br>  <br>Why is being Lancer always suffering?</br>  <br>G-BEAT!!</br>  <br>Giant boats hopefully. They need to somehow top ep1.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128175516 <br><br> Symphochicks. </br></br>  <br>Kind of weird that they're trying to connect Carol to Hibiki when she actually seems to have more in common with almost anyone else.</br>  <br>She could use manhole covers</br>   Hibiki finally kisses miku <br> everybody goes crazy <br> Dies in series finale <br> everbody goes crazy <br> Emerges alive and well from rubble after post-credits </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Lancer's always end up dying even though they're the best.<br><br> Even though she was only around for one episode and a couple of chapters/illusions Kanade is still a best. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but Hibiki's the only one with any evident daddy issues<br>God I hope they don't get super annoying on this point</br></br>  <br>She should throw the S.O.N.G submarine.</br>  <br>It was great how even though she died in ep1 she was still relevant all the way to the end of S1. I wouldn't say she's a best girl (that's Hibiki) but she's pretty based.<br>Plus she could probably thrash Maria in a fight despite having weaker LiNKER</br></br>  <br>The scene with her fighting Fine after shadow stitching Hibiki near Kadingir was one of the best fights in S1.</br>  <br> Ghost Kanade. <br> I'm back Kanade. <br>Tsubasa sure has gone a long way.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki is second best girl in my opinion so our opinions don't really clash much. <br><br>It's sad that we won't get to see more of Kanade given Tsubasa is getting over her issues and no longer needs to rely on Kanade.<br><br>I would personally like to see some strange situation where it's possible for Kanade and Hibiki to speak so we could get Kanade's opinion of her successor. <br><br>As for the fighting thing. I'd say Kanade is stronger up to a point but I'd say GX Tsubasa is probably better at this point. <br><br><br>She really has, I didn't think I was going to like her just from the first few episodes but Tsubasa really grew on me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YAAAA HIYAAAA SETSUNA HIBIKU</br>  <br>Tsubasa talking to herself while pretending to be Kanade in the elevator in S1 was really weird. As if she was really scizophrenic.</br>  <br>Yeah, and the manga Fine vs Tsubasa too.</br>  <br>Good, maybe they S.O.N.G. would get a airship like the Highwind or a Satellite base next.</br>  <br>Most characters were pretty iffy in the first few episodes, Tsubasa was a cold bitch and Hibiki was completely useless. But it made when they both got over those things a lot more satisfying.<br><br>Also GX Tsubasa would definitely be stronger, and maybe even S1 non-flashback Tsubasa given she doesn't have to rely on LiNKER. Kanade still has the best attack cards though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dude, Touhous eat people and everyone loves them anyways.</br></br>  <br>I really was digging that comic book style look for her cards. <br><br>Hibiki in my opinion hasn't really even changed that much. She's no longer useless but they've only really just filed away a few of her rough edges, while Tsubasa has gone the fuck spectrum from Moe with Kanade to Asshole against Hibiki to ultimately friendly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Chris is seriously one of the hottest anime characters ever. Those years of forced semen injections did wonders to her body.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki finally kisses Miku <br> everybody goes crazy <br> another Hibiki walks into the room <br> everybody goes REALLY crazy </br></br></br></br>  <br> Both Hibiki's fight <br> Off screen, one changes back <br>   we never know which Hibiki it was that kissed Miku </br></br></br>  <br>With Hibiki it's the fact that she actually actively sought to git gud instead of whining about it for 8 episodes only to get a bullshit powerup or something. <br>Plus a few episodes in S1 and G showed that her philosophy is actually pretty fucked up, which made her interesting.<br>Mind of Steel Hibiki when</br></br></br>  <br> Mind of Steel Hibiki when <br>episode 7</br></br>  <br><br>I was about to disagree but then I realized   Maria has the extra bonus of being an adult with a hot body, so her gay has the potential of being lewd as fuck while Miku's gay is only cute and heartwarming </br></br>  <br>Hibiki's philosophy may be fucked up but it's one I can respect. <br>As long as she takes Tsubasa's advice and doesn't commit sudoku, I think it could work out well. <br><br>I don't think I could handle an MoS Hibiki. That would be heartbreaking. <br>Shirou was fine, I didn't particularly care about him going full Batman to murder a bunch of people but Hibiki doin it would just feel wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mind of Steel Hibiki when <br>Never.<br>She has a supporting waifu that understands her.<br>Even with using Shirou as parallel, she will become UBW Shirou if anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She hasn't really had much success in unfucking Hibiki's head thus far.</br>  <br>She is the Nana of the Symphogear world she can do anything she wants.</br>  <br>Isn't that what this season is for?</br>  <br><br>You can't unfuck someone without fucking them.</br></br>  <br> She hasn't really had much success in unfucking Hibiki's head thus far. <br>That was in G, and we know how it ended.<br>She isn't trying to fix Hibiki anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>She can't defeat her in any capacity if Tsubasa seriously fought her. <br><br><br> almost defeated Chris <br> got a single cheap shot whole Chris was anti linkered and took a shit ton of backfire damage  <br><br>Don't start this retarded argument again, FIS needs a Genjuro training montage to be anywhere near the main trio in a serious fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said she is more powerful and I clarified she was cheating.<br>What's the problem with that?</br></br>  <br> Miku confesses to Hibiki <br> Hibiki only throws herself harder at mission to protect her wife <br>Miku just can't win</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki just completely shut down and nearly got killed because someone mentioned her dad. She uh, should probably get back on that.</br>  <br>laserbeams might also have had something to do with that.</br>  <br> She uh, should probably get back on that. <br>The last time she tried, Hibiki almost kill herself.<br>Bitch is too crazy for any argument.</br></br></br>  I wonder which songs will we get to hear next episode.  How do you think Hibiki and Miku met anyway?  <br>Is this even is a question? Of course. We've gotten at least one in every season and there was one in the second episode of GX for god's sake.</br>    <br>Either one or both of DMJii songs</br>  <br><br>Very likely. They probably want to get every character song out of the way as soon as possible and at this point it's only logical to save Maria's for last.</br></br>  Where did the whole "DMJii" come from?  <br>Jiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<wbr>iiiiiiiiiiii</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> equal ground <br>implies that she's not cheating.</br></br>    No panties  <br>I'm </br>  <br>Dark Magician Girl + Jii = DMJii<br> Not sure I may be completely wrong </br></br>  <br>Who needs underwear when they're wearing magical ancient spandex?</br>  <br><br>Let's not compare Hibiki to a shit character from a shit series in the first place.</br></br>  <br> Those "I'm tapping that and you aren't" faces </br>  SLAY THE GAY  <br>They wearing a low riding leotard with exposed back.</br>  <br>This is correct</br>  <br>Sound hot</br>  <br>I don't think Chris can defeat Carol and the Autoscorers all on her own, though.</br>  <br>Let's try to not go off topic.<br>But if there is a single thing that is good about Fate is their characters, especially Shirou.<br><br>And Hibiki has some parallels with Shirou on how they survived a catastrophe and now they want to help people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It might already be an airship. They’ve never really shown the submarine in G before it went into action, if they want to pull something similar in GX, it’d be<br> emerge, to the surface! <br> thing pops out at high speed like in G <br> doesn’t drop onto the surface, it FUCKING FLIES AWAY </br></br></br></br>  <br>How dare you. Hibiki and Tsubasa are straight as fuck! (At least Tsubasa is.)</br>  <br>Why does she have clothes irons with spikes under her shoes?</br>  <br><br>Oh, well okay then.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you?</br>    <br>You called?</br>  <br>Ogawa please.</br>  <br>She likes it rough</br>  <br>Heavy metal.</br>  <br> But if there is a single thing that is good about Fate is their characters, especially Shirou. <br>If you were trying to make me vomit on my mouth, it worked. Over simplified ideals personified acting as heavy handed story telling tools don't make for good characters. None of their personalities or struggles have an once of subtlety or wit.</br></br>  <br>I love Kirika's quantum pantsu</br>  <br> this mad <br>smughibiki.jpg</br></br>  <br>I would like this better if it was 3 zerbikis (using the 3 designs from each season) in place of the noise.</br>  I want to fill Chris with my baby producing liquid.      Which one tops?    <br>Shirabe.</br>  <br>Jesus christ, I never noticed how lewd those uniforms are. You can see their armpits so easily</br>  <br>Best summer uniform ever.</br>  <br>They alternate</br>  <br>Kirika tops from the bottom</br>  <br>Kirika, unless she starts screwing things dohohoho  up, then Shirabe casually takes charge.</br>  <br>Uh, why? I don't get it. I thought people liked Jotaro. I know I do.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, retard. You don't deserve to use a picture of someone as wonderful as Nozomi. Go to hell and die.</br>  <br> I thought people liked Jotaro <br><br>Not sure what gave you that idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and if Hibiki randomly killed Genjuro it would be really bad too. What's the point of talking about things that didn't happen? The fact of the matter is, an amazing voice actor was enough to turn him into an amazing character. This is reality, accept it.</br>  <br> randomly <br>You can't just randomly add that word to everything hoping that it will make it look stupid.</br></br>  <br>I dunno, maybe the fact that literally everyone always talks about how great he is and I watched the show and saw his greatness for myself. He's just the classic 90s stoic badass was the inspiration for a bunch of other badass anime characters. A good guy that doesn't necessarily show it all the time because he's too busy being COOL.<br><br>But I forgot, this is the Symphogear thread, where it's not okay to like men and all we ever do is talk about lesbians. Sorry.</br></br></br>  <br> him into an amazing character <br><br>I hope you are not serious, Sugita made him tolerable and even that ran out by the end. Ver is a fucking awful character.</br></br></br>  <br>You have to admit it would be pretty fucking random if she killed Genjuro. That was the whole point. If something happened randomly it would be dumb. But nothing happens randomly in Symphogear, it's all planned out. So we shouldn't talk about things that didn't happen. Ver was the largest ham thanks to Sugita and it was wonderful.</br>  <br>What, so it's not okay to be entertained by a guy that's evil just for the sake of it? This isn't a show with any pretensions, this is a show about beating people up with your fists. He fit in perfectly.</br>  <br>I don't think it would be random to kill Hibiki's only semblance of a father figure in a season where her main conflict is clearly going to involve her daddy issues.</br>  <br>I like how that's enough for it to be lewd to you. Says a lot about what you're looking at.<br><br>Though I think they are excellent uniforms myself.</br></br></br>  <br>Ver was funny and one of the most memorable things about G. His character is flat and simplistic, sure, but like the other anon said, this is Symphogear, who cares about that?</br>  <br>  dunno, maybe the fact that literally everyone always talks about how great he is and I watched the show and saw his greatness for myself. <br><br>So basically your own confirmation bias tells you Jotaro is awesome. <br>Go to the Jojo general and start talking about how awesome Jotaro is and how good he is in relation to other Jojo's and see how your opinion is taken then. <br><br> But I forgot, this is the Symphogear thread, where it's not okay to like men and all we ever do is talk about lesbians. Sorry. <br><br>Genjuro exists and he's a fucking badass. Also in a series about young girls with lesbian undertones, were you expecting us to be talking about Genjuro and Ogawa all the time and how awesome they are?<br>When 99% of your cast is female, females are going to be talked about more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah HA HA so funny Ver made that great face again and then shot some Noise it was so awesome. I know every time I remember cool moments in G I always think about my man Ver falling down stairs.</br>  水樹奈々『Exterminate』MUSIC CLIP（Short Ver.）<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=30&amp;<wbr>v=htmjxz81BxM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Dude, Ver literally was the majority of the cool moments in G.</br>  <br>I knew you would understand.</br>  <br>You're as annoying as crack kunt.<br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Are you upset someone insulted your joke character</br>  <br>Good clip.<br>A shame I have no idea what the visuals mean.</br></br>  <br>Yes, very.</br>  <br> how good he is in relation to other Jojo's <br><br>I'm not comparing him to them though. And come on man, even if I was, he is literally THE most popular JoJo in Japan. You can't say he's not liked. I'm just respecting him on his own as a pretty badass character. He can't help it that he happens to be a series packed so full of them. However, he stands out by being his own kind of badass, the coolly dressed delinquent schoolkid that you see in anime all the time because of him.<br><br>And I actually do expect people to talk about those two because they are amazing, but not all the time, to be fair. I just think it's rude to dismiss Jotaro just because he's male, especially when the comparison to Jotaro is pretty apt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bro. I disagree with him but "my man Ver falling down stairs" is a hilarious phrase. Step off.</br></br>  <br>Seiyuu/Anison MV visuals have no relation to anything most of the time. Just watch any FripSide MV and see what I mean.<br>Actually, the music videos for Aoi Yuuki singles see to be one of the few exceptions that come to mind.</br></br>  <br>Part 3 is the most popular part in Japan. I wouldn't be going to Japan's tastes for what is considered good. <br><br>Though in saying that, taste = subjective even if I disagree with their horribly shit taste. <br><br>Jotaro being a standard was a terrible thing to happen. <br>We had Joseph before him being absolutely amazing as a protagonist and then having Jotaro come along and be boring as shit was terrible. <br>He had good moments but he's playing in a league he's not suited for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> where it's not okay to like  <br>nigga wat</br></br>  <br>I don't think everything is just as random; Exterminate, as well as Only My Railgun MVs seemed to have a purpose for the visuals.<br>If not, I probably try to read to much into things.<br><br>Also,  I'm going to blame you for suggesting seeing a FripSide MV.<br>I just saw Sister Noise and those two fat boys out of nowhere were creepy as fuck.</br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>To once again be fair though, the protagonist in part 3 was obviously intended to be Polnareff. He got almost all of the major battles to himself.<br><br>Jotaro was definitely a disappointment after someone like Joseph, but anyone would be. Even Joseph himself, apparently. But still, I don't think he's bad at all. Just different. And he has Daisuke Ono's smooooooooth voice. Mmm.</br></br></br>  <br> DMJii <br>Where did this nickname for them come from? Legitimately curious.</br></br>  <br>I have no idea but it works well.</br>  <br>DM I can kind of understand but if you can't tell where Jii came from you must not have watched the show.</br>  <br>Shirabe made a Jii noise and Kirika's Gear looks like DMG</br>  <br>read the thread</br>  <br>The Dank meme guy?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=io-<wbr>tTOCs4Yo</wbr>  [ ]<br>なんだこのおっさん！<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zY_<wbr>Tp7QLHyg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FGG<wbr>6PVhUhB8</wbr>  [ ]<br>I like Aoi's MVs aesthetically, and her body language is great.</br></br></br></br></br>    I can only hope we see this again, but this time it actually gets fired.    <br>Why are we allowing Sword to edit pictures?</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>12493&amp;showfiles=1<br><br>Has this been posted yet?</br></br></wbr>  <br>That not being fired was the biggest cocktease in all of G. <br><br>Also Josuke is best Jojo</br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa <br>Phonic Gain</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa <br> tits </br></br>  <br>You are quite literally weeks late.</br>  <br>Why didn't she just fired her itano circus right here?

Or she just got Maria to do it for her </br>  <br>She was cheated by the plot</br>  <br>Red Hot Blaze head shot or a full battle? Which would be better?</br>  <br>I wonder if Maria lives with Tsubasa.</br>  <br>She probably lives either in straight up captivity or at the very least under constant surveillance.</br>  <br>All of those are great, especially the second one.<br>Although, only the third one seems random visuals.<br><br>I never notice Aoi had good music outside Symphogear, I guess is time to download some of her music.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be so mean on her, her parents might be already killed or something. <br>There must be some reason why she fucking went apeshit so hard she threw a fucking giant sword to a young genki girl out of frustration.</br></br>  <br>Both. And Chris says 'BAN' just as she fires her Red Hot Blaze shot.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Maria moves in when they return to Japan. DMJii probably have a room together in the school dorms, but Maria would have no where else. Plus if they've been touring together it would be a pretty easy transition to make.<br><br> Unless they just throw Maria back into a jail cell </br></br></br>  <br>He fucking let Tsubasa train to become a soldier at the young age of 5, why the fuck should he care now if she breaks down?</br>  <br><br>That one scene in episode 2 that showed her accepting the contract for DMJii's freedom implied she lives in some sort of prison. Probably a pretty nice, cushy one where you'd find political prisoners, that's closer to a hotel than a prison, but a prison nonetheless.</br></br>  <br> And Chris says 'BAN' just as she fires her Red Hot Blaze shot. <br>Dick status: Muh.</br></br>  <br>I'm a little offended by how shitty this webm is.</br>  <br>They should probably all stay in the submarine if the dolls are coming after them.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you'll be fucked up hard too if your only friend disintegrates on your arms.</br>    <br>Close it, look for my bat, then call the cops.</br>  Give them some burgers.  HENSHIN  Invite them in for tea.  Quickly call Ben Garrison.  Ask them about Bane.  but they look like good persons.  Ask them how their day is going and then ask if they would like some water, as the fellow on the right there looks to be parched.  Movie spoilers from yesterday.<br><br>In a post-apocalyptic future where only a fraction of humanity has survived to live humbly amongst the rubble, Eren Jaeger dreams of more. His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called "Titans" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted "Titan Survey Corps" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what "freedom" means to him in a new world ruled by fear.<br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br> Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead <br> It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life <br> During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack <br> It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on <br> Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him <br> At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly <br><br><br>Is there more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>I love Annie more than anything in this world<br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  Mikasa:the movie  <br>Also new reaction images for us.<br><br><br>I think it's so delusional it's funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br>no</br></br>  <br>Nice shitposting general.</br>  <br>http://special.movies.yahoo.co.jp/d<wbr>etail/20150716387704/<br><br>New full trailer on Yahoo Japan</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Can't open it at the moment, Is there anything worth mentioning?</br>  <br>Who gives a shit, any news on the 2nd recap movie?</br>  <br>it looks awful<br>oh dear god</br></br>  <br>Armin and Mikasa run with goats<br><br>New giants cartoon animation <br><br>fuller look at titans running<br><br>Mikasa holding a baby and crying <br><br>Hanji teaching<br><br>New name intros<br><br>New RT scene <br><br>Mikasa and Shikishima kissing full scene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.

I mean indirectly it does but is Yummy in there?  <br>Are people still going on that a movie based on Japanese source material, written, produced, and directed by Japanese, doesn't have enough white people in it?<br><br>It's a Japanese movie, the actors are Japanese. Get the fuck over it.</br></br></br>  <br>Why not just change the setting to Japan?</br>  <br>The setting is a fantasy world based on European culture.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Since Isayama had some involvement in the project he was probably in awe of Kiko and pretty much let her do whatever she wants. The movie is like a massive, horribly written fanfic. <br><br><br>Armin and Sasha are fucking cute. Can't wait for the full size versions of these.</br></br></br></br>    <br>No it isn't. There's no such thing as "European culture".</br>  <br>This anon's right.

Mikasa licks Eren's pussy every night.</br>  so did any of the titans from the invasion of Trost become shifters when they ate those pieces of Eren?<br>Maybe not the arm because it got lost, but a leg definitely got gone</br>  <br>No because they have to eat and digest the spine.</br>  <br>You have to eat the shifter not the titan body.</br>  <br>You have to eat the spine in order to be a shifter</br>  <br>I know it's reverse shitposting, but I still threw up in my mouth after reading this post.</br>  <br>Separately they are still terrible characters</br>  <br>I can see it coming<br><br> the new red shirts get introduced <br> Survey Corps arrive at Shiganshina  <br> BR and MT show up <br> a bunch of red shirts + maybe Keith and/or Marlo die <br> Eren puts up a decent fight but ends up getting kidnapped <br> Mikasa goes crazy <br> Manlet tells her to calm down <br> Erwin says that saving Eren is the most important thing to do for mankind <br> end of chapter </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget<br> introduce like 10 new characters that are barely named <br> kill them all within a chapter while redshirts look scared <br> pretend like this is novel and interesting </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you Nifa's death still haunts me</br>  <br>literally who<br>there's like dozens of throwaway characters I don't remember</br></br>    <br>How can you not remember Armin's  good  twin?</br>  <br><br>Best imouto.</br></br>  <br> Armin's good twin? <br><br>Wasn't that Historia?</br></br></br>  <br>Next season is going to suck</br>  <br>She's just fodder and wasn't even that cute.</br>  I still wonder why manlet opened up to Nifa. It seemed out of character for him to tell someone something specific about his past. He could've just had an inner-monologue to fill the reader in on his relationship with Kenny, but him opening up to her still feels kind of odd to me.  <br>Oh yeah, Petra 2.0<br>but seriously why are there so many short light haired white girls gettin wasted</br></br>  <br>There was no relationship. He later told everyone about Kenny and that he was an Ackerman like Mikasa.<br><br>Manlet only cares about Erwin and pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Hanjo the banjo.</br>  <br>What? He clearly said he lived with him as a kid, that's called describing a relationship to someone else. I never said they had a caring relationship. I just said him bringing up Kenny and telling Nifa that he knows him is strange. <br><br>And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. The first time he actually referred to himself as an Ackerman was when Kenny was dying. It's doubtful Isayama would pass up illustrating Mikasa's reaction when she finds out.</br></br></br>  <br>Hinting at his troubled past is how Levi flirts.</br>  <br>It's possible he was going to follow that up with<br> yeah, so I know he's pretty dangerous and might try to blow people's heads off <br>but didn't quite get it out in time</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about Levi's relationship with Nifa, that she was nothing really special to him.</br>  So, I was considering why Grisha went after the Reiss family and I began to wonder whether MT is really the bad guy. If we consider that Grisha himself was the coordinate (i.e. The end goal of a mission) then it opens up a few possibilities. That MT was after Grisha because he was dangerous and that Grisha seized the Reiss power to further his goals. I think Grisha attempted to pass his ideology to Eren in the same way that the First King passed his to the Reiss family.  <br> And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. <br>I think he already had his suspicions about it. He did say that he had the same Ackerman power Kenny and Mikasa had.</br></br>  <br>Why would Mikasa care? It's only if it affects Eren in some way. I think the Ackerman line is done and Isayama is going to focus on Mikasa's Asian side next.</br>  <br>Kek.</br>  <br>Grisha implied to Eren that life outside the walls was utter shit and it seemed he wanted to change that, so I think he was an ends justify the means type of good guy. <br><br>With MT's casual disregard to life though I can't see him as a good guy.</br></br></br>  <br>What did Ymir and Historia rank?</br>  <br>Yeah he had a hunch but now he knows for sure. <br><br><br>She spent half the series having a one sided grudge against Levi. Isayama would probably get a kick out of illustrating her reaction to finding out they're related. I do agree he's going to focus on the Asian clan, hopefully, but I do think Levi will properly tell his squad about it when it becomes relevant again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>69</br>  <br>That would make sense though. Grisha wants to destroy all the people outside the walls. When he saw how well life worked within the walls he reaffirmed his position and is going to try to set Eren up as the new King, after giving him the ability to control titans<br><br>MT on the other hand only has shown a casual disregard for the people within the walls, which he considers similar to animals in a pen.</br></br></br>  <br>Lewd.</br>  <br><br>1) Eren<br>2) Manlet<br>3) Erwin<br>4) Hanji<br>5) Mikasa<br>6) Jean<br>7) Nanaba<br>8) Armin<br>9) Bert <br>10) Historia<br>11) Reiner<br>12) Annie<br>13) Mike<br>14) Marco<br>15) Erd<br>16) Sasha<br>17) Connie<br>18) Ymir<br>19) Moblit<br>20) Gunter</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isayama would probably get a kick out of illustrating her reaction to finding out they're related <br>I guess it does have the potential to make her reaction amusing, but I'm not sure she would be that shocked, especially if she already has a hunch about their connection. Then there's the fact that Mikasa has been developing little by little, and she shows more respect and trust towards the manlet.</br></br>  <br>Good to see Historia in the top ten. Is she getting more popular again?</br>  <br> Nanaba <br> Bert <br> Mike <br> Marco <br> Erd <br> Moblit <br> Gunter <br>The troll votes are stronk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The pole was full of proxyfags and let each person vote 5 times besides, so it's pretty worthless as a judge of anything. <br><br>Also the top 3 all had tens of thousands of votes, while those below that only had a few thousand at most.</br></br></br>  <br>She just had an entire nearly all about her. Of course she's going to be more popular.</br>  <br>Bert has ranked in the top ten in every poll since Clash.</br>  <br>Eren, Manlet, Hange, Erwin and Mikasa usually always make the top 5.</br>  <br> she shows more respect and trust towards the manlet <br>That's true, but she did smile when he got punched so I think a little grudge remains. I find her reactions funny and it's ironic how someone she initially hated is now connected to her. It could be pretty funny if Isayama decides to bring it up. Levi figured out he was an Ackerman, but I'm not sure if Mikasa caught on yet. It could still come as a shock to have their connection confirmed.</br></br>  will BRA ever be together again  <br>They were never together to begin with. Annie was a lone wolf who clearly thought little of Reiner and Bert outside the job.</br>  <br>I'm betting no. It seems like Isayama's setting them up as semi-sympathetic characters, so you feel bad for them when they never meet up again</br>  <br>I think even with that considered, aside from Nanaba the positions are pretty believable.</br>  <br>I hope they will reunite somehow</br>  <br>They are literally made for each other.</br>  <br>This so much. Now let's dump some YH pics too.</br>    <br>Not on my watch.</br>  <br>SUNK<br>&amp;<br>DELUSIONAL<br>CRACK</br></br></br></br>  <br>Historia wants Eren's dick. Accept the canon truth.</br>  <br> Eren <br> having a dick <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Historia wants her</br>  <br><br>EH will give us Freedom from the tyranny of the EM and YH fags.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone honestly think EH has any chance of happening with given how much the anime, the spoof and even the chibi spinoff push for EM?</br>  <br>I think Eren's going to die, so it doesn't matter who he gets paired off with.</br>  <br><br><br>Does anyone (other than hetfag himself) at this point believe that hetfags are anything but shitposters?<br><br>They keep posting the same pictures.<br>They keep saying the same stuff.<br>== They keep shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Isayama is going for a sibling-like relationship for EH considering Eren pretty much carries Frieda's memories with him.</br>  <br>The spoofs and spinoffs are made for laughs and EM being mutually canon is the biggest joke of all.</br>  <br>See? Even this artist knows better and honors the Eternal EM &amp; YH Alliance That Shall Last a Thousand Years.<br><br>The only thing that can sink EM and it's Greatest Ally YH is your suicide, hetfags, for only in your delusional dreams these canon ships are not canon.</br></br></br>  <br>anti-bert fags btfo</br>  <br>They also show that Mikasa would pretty much kill herself if Eren ends up with someone else.</br>  Is Mikasa regarded as best girl here?  <br>Bert is the second best character in the series and the best male character overall!!<br><br>Only Ymir is better.<br><br>And Mikasa is the third best and the best female character overall!!<br><br><br>Yes!! She is so amazing, always thinking about Eren!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the worst, actually.</br>  <br>Didanwhisperer pls</br>  <br>seriously speaking it's probably either hange or historia, leaning on hange</br>   Tryna get a JoJo thread goin but /a/ won't let me <br><br>pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br>      Gay priest is here now.

Hopefully it'll never come to anything the Supreme Court, that'll almost certainly end poorly.</br>  <br> loli banned because some soccer moms don't like it  <br><br>I don't think you understand how legislation works, even if your story is purposeful hyperbole.</br></br></br>  <br> Jewcob brings hentai into the mainstream, it becomes one of the most browsed porn sites on the internet <br><br>Hentai will always be a niche in the west, though.</br></br></br>  <br>FAKKU is willing to go to court to defend H-manga (including loli etc) if it actually comes down to it.</br>  <br>Does /pol/ actually believe this or are they just being ironic?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  Why don't we put porn on goddess manga? Is that allowed?<br><br> Is it woxxy / Foolz who runs that shit? </br></br>  <br>Don't worry, I'd take up arms to fight for my right to loli.</br>  Reminder that this guy was responsible for introducing Wani to e-hentai. He's the reason most of the best galleries are expunged  <br>But first the kikes will profit from it, and then who cares if it will eventually get banned.</br>  <br>"Ironic" stuff like this normalizes and ultimately results in real lunacy.</br>  <br>Until the people that license the H-manga to Fakku say no more loli. Then he will switch over to why loli is bad, and you will still shill him.</br>  fakku sucks on my phone anyways, pururin for life  <br>Hey Daiz, can you tell me if Fakku has any plans to speed up the release of content?</br>  <br> look up drawings on the internet <br> end up on sex offender list for the rest of your life <br> can't move anywhere without telling everyone you're on said list for child related reasons <br>Thanks Jacob</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wani didn't need FAKKU to introduce them to E-Hentai, they were well aware of it on their own already. They got the takedown notices from Wani at the same time as everyone else, the difference was that while most entities that received them took the content down, E-Hentai just somewhat hid it and it didn't escape Wani's notice.</br>  <br><br>We Shimoneta now.</br></br>  <br>Just stop being retarded.</br>  <br> Then he will switch over to why loli is bad <br><br>That's some wild leap of logic you have there - why on Earth would he do that?<br><br>And no, I wouldn't defend him if he suddenly did a complete 180 in attitude like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the point of these threads ? They only attract Jewcob and Daiz</br>  <br> FAKKU is willing to go to court to defend H-manga (including loli etc) <br><br>I bet Thad is thrilled to hear about this!<br><br>Still, I'm actually really interested to hear what his defense would be. As far as I know, the "they're drawings, not real lolis" defense hasn't done too well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well when the magazines start that'll be ~1000 pages of additional content a month.</br>  <br>I need my monthly dose of daiz, it's a drug.</br>  <br> when the magazines start <br>And that will be when? What price?</br></br>  <br>On the federal level it's done just fine. Laws that tried to ban drawings have been thrown out multiple times by scotus rulings. The problem is individual states.</br>  <br> still believing this lie </br>   Removing scantalations <br> getting rid of other people's work which he used to make his site relevant in the first place <br><br>So Doujin.moe for casuals now?</br></br></br>  <br>  deleting those nudes you got in highschool is now a crime <br><br>Never change America</br></br></br>  <br>Well obviously the main point of it would be that they're just drawings, not real people, and that it's then a matter of artistic freedom and freedom of speech etc. Jacob's been in touch with the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund from pretty much the beginning of the legit publishing thing in relation to this and FAKKU even set up shop in Oregon because it's the only state that has declared obscenity laws to be unconstitutional.</br>  <br>Are they starting up a print magazine or would it be digital?</br>  <br>Will Fakku eventually expand into localizing hentai games and anime?</br>  <br>You deserve to die. I hope you get cancer or your mother dies horribly</br>  <br> It is a wild leap of logic that japan will get stricter on loli laws <br>Japan has been trying to ban loli for years. Not a wild leap if some of the licensing companies ban it.<br><br> I wouldn't defend him if he suddenly did a complete 180 in attitude like that. <br>He has already done this when money was waved in front of his face.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Digital, and with no download links.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he had actual CP (not that it should be any more illegal than anything else).</br>  <br> FAKKU even set up shop in Oregon because it's the only state that has declared obscenity laws to be unconstitutional. <br><br>You can still be prosecuted federally for obscenity, especially for selling and mailing obscene content like he is. With the free sites it isn't a problem.</br></br></br>  <br> And that will be when? <br><br>Can't say for sure. Probably within the next month or two.<br><br> What price? <br><br>As the article in the OP mentions, "$10 or so a month for subscriptions"<br><br><br>Magazines will be digital only.<br><br><br>Who knows. Maybe.<br><br><br> He has already done this when money was waved in front of his face. <br><br>He has already done a 180 on what exactly due to money? You'll need to elaborate on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Urination tag when? </br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br> 250m viewers <br>All those people who cannot get past the sad panda</br></br>  <br> trafficking of scanalated physical copies of doujins blows up <br> the process to fap to chinese cartoons gets at the same level of buying coke </br></br>  <br>We're all tsundere to fakku</br>  Targeted for kill  <br>One day, perhaps.<br><br>Expanding the tags a lot is something I'd like to see done myself as well.</br></br></br>  <br> scantalations <br> scantalations <br> scantalations </br></br></br>  <br>It would be like porn bounty hunters game from D-Frag! Just not in space.</br>  <br> 50 years from now, states are voting on legalizing medicinal lolicon </br>  What a turbokike.  <br>Yeah but federally all cases with loli have been thrown out, it's only at the state level people got in trouble</br>  It was only a matter of time before publishers digitized hentai (manga and anime). And since digital media is easier to export, it's a no-brainer someone with an established userbase would create a business surrounding this principle.<br><br>It will probably be a successful business, as their easily accessible exclusivity deals with major publishers will be lucrative to a lot of consumers.<br><br>Like it or not, money wins.</br></br></br></br>  <br> simul-publishing two biggest hentai mags <br> with 3 editors <br><br>Yeah I'm just waiting for the fire to start burning at this point.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He has already done a 180 on what exactly due to money? You'll need to elaborate on that. <br><br>The sudden change when he got the licensing deal. He did a drastic change of his standing point when it comes to his website.</br></br></br>  <br>Sweet.</br>   Fakku has begun the process of removing unlicensed content, but it won’t be completely removed from the site until the end of 2015 <br><br>Cukku</br></br>  <br> medicinal lolicon <br> 5 years later, a few starts start legalizing lolicon for general consumption </br></br>  <br>Drawings aren't real, nigger.</br>  I support Rebis on Patreon.  <br>As the business grows, they'll be able to bring in more staff.

He did a drastic change of his standing point when it comes to his website. <br><br>Hardly. Here's something he wrote back in 2007 (three months after starting FAKKU):<br><br> The future for FAKKU is looking awesome. Soon we will have multiple people uploading manga directly to the site, which means a ton of updates every single day. Eventually I want to start translating the more popular manga titles, I want to talk with Japanese publishers and get them to ship us the actual manga and sell it on the site. There is so much that FAKKU still has in store! <br> I want to talk with Japanese publishers and get them to ship us the actual manga and sell it on the site. <br><br>It certainly took a while, but when the opportunity to actually do that came up it was only logical for him to jump on it, as it's something he has long wanted to done.<br><br>It was really the same thing for me - I've wanted to work on legit digital distribution for years (because I believe it's the way to truly push things forward), so when the opportunity for it finally came, I got right on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I feel like whenever I fap to 3D. Give it time. You'll reach here someday.</br>  <br>Next they will come for our lives.<br><br>Fucking jews.</br></br></br>  <br>I respect this man.</br>  <br>The memes are next  tbh. </br>  Personally speaking I think the Fakku team is pretty cool.<br><br>The site itself not as much but the people themselves yeah. Anyone else feel me here?</br></br>  <br> That's what I feel like whenever I fap to 3D <br>Same here, I'm always really sad whenever I fap to 3D over 2D. A wasted fap doesn't settle correctly in the heart.</br></br>  <br> I've wanted to work on legit digital distribution <br>Anyone with a sane mind would jump on such opportunities, especially with this much financial potential.</br></br>  <br>It's not tsundere if there is no dere.</br>  <br>Fuck off Jacob, you're an ugly, greasy, slimy kike.</br>   people, including 4chan posters, actually paying for porn <br> another thread of Daiz shilling <br><br>Awful.</br></br></br>  <br>How many cc's of loli would constitute an overdose?</br>  <br> Manpower really isn't an issue <br><br>Having bodies to typeset shit? Maybe. People who want and know how to decently? Doubtful.<br><br>Lot of people working in the scantalation industry do it because it's fun and it's a neat side hobby to them even if they're not getting paid. Money runs things. And once money becomes a factor in whether or not people want to typeset porn you know it's going to eventually devolve to articles like:<br><br> Fakku editors demanding to be paid more for typesetting porn with a lot of redraws <br>Dark days are coming, that's just how I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want Jacob-senpai to scratch his beard on the back of my neck and down my back.  <br> backpfeifengesicht <br>that looks like gibberish</br></br>  <br>Same here, hoping for something not so vanilla to get translated.</br>  <br> What's taking so long? <br><br>Well, it's a pretty big business deal, and as such it involves a lot and lot paperwork and other sort of business formalities that need to be sorted out before it can be given the greenlight.<br><br> almost two years ago <br><br>FAKKU Books in general was only announced like a year ago. And Titikei's going on sale in less than two weeks. Will probably sadly still be a while before NTR2 comes out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  MAL is gonna stream anime now.<br>inb4 ANN<br>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/da<wbr>ily-briefs/2015-07-16/dena-acj-to-s<wbr>tream-anime-on-myanimelist-site/.90<wbr>513</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Sorry mean to say "Money ruins things".</br>  <br>i think most people were k with fakku til jacob started makin dosh off it. also, signing that deal with wani that torched a good chunk of the panda down pretty much sealed it fer him then and there</br>  <br>Jacob pls go</br>  <br> people are actually fucking defending this and not telling Daiz to fuck off </br>  <br> idiots on /a/ <br>Shocking.</br></br>  <br> people <br>You mean Jacob without his trip on again.</br></br>  <br>You have to admit $10 a month for these two magazines in Daiz quality is a great deal</br>  <br> signing that deal with wani that torched a good chunk of the panda down pretty much sealed it fer him then and there <br>No, it didn't. Stop spreading misinformation.</br></br>  <br>I don't know if this upsets me. I can only hope this means more cartoon porn for America.</br>  <br>It isn't the first time hired Fakku shills have posted here.<br><br>It's also far from the last.</br></br></br>  <br>$0 sounds even better.</br>  <br> Yes, someone serious about porn would want to watch it in HD. <br>With 240/360p videos you can't see all the defects</br></br>  <br> being this stupid </br>  <br>Pilot V5 master race</br>  <br><br>Fuck off, Jacob.</br></br>  <br>Who r u quoting</br>  <br>While I agree that money ruins everything, there is a huge quantity of editors, both amateur and professional (who will probably also be typesetters) who might want to get paid legit for their work.<br><br>What the wage will be? What benefits? I don't know, but with the likely revenue stream, I doubt it will be insufficient.<br><br>I'm only being realistic here, of course. I hate it as much as anyone else, but this is a natural evolution of the hentai manga scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people like to see 3D sluts bruise marks and other beating marks they have. <br>It's gross either way.</br></br>  Better start backing up shit onto externals. The Fakku Forums were a great resource of links to VNs and such, and you can bet those will go too.  <br>Does anyone knows how many % of the money actually go to the authors?</br>  <br>I'm thinking positive and hoping more hentai artists will like their work published and translated for us.</br>  <br>Just stop being retarded.</br>  <br>No, why would they make their contracts public?</br>  <br>Fair enough. But what's taking NTR2 so long. Is it legal issues or staff favoritism? If so then who chose that book anyway? Was it literally just a statement work to appease the hardcore crowd?</br>  <br>Probably as much or less then Crunchyroll.</br>  <br>This means more regulamentation and easy enforcing of law.</br>  <br>FAKKU's entire staff consists of like a dozen people. There are no "hired shills" posting here. I'm basically the only person that works for FAKKU that also actively posts on /a/ - and I'm completely open about that fact. And I don't get paid for it either, it's just something I do on my own time.</br>  <br>7%<br>Just kidding. Of course it's not going to be that huge.</br></br>  <br>Likely the same they always get from the publishers.</br>  <br> paying for pornography </br>  <br> I'm only being realistic here, of course, ya dumb goyim. </br>  <br> blatantly lying <br>Just fuck off Daiz, you goddamn kike.</br></br>  <br>Why would you do that, go on the internet and tell lies?</br>  <br>Why are you letting someone else make money off your time and effort, when all they do is host it. You are a cuck for Jacob.</br>  <br> sweet <br>Just like the tag you want.</br></br>  <br>Daiz, you ruined a beautiful thing that made people come togheter and collaborater just to share with others spontaneously. it was good because it was unreliable.<br>I hope you fucking die</br></br>  <br>All we know is it's enough that Bosshi was cool with coming to America and doing panels with Fakku</br>  <br>Does that include everyone who'll be working on translating and editing the magazines? I'm sure I could find out how official stuff gets translated over there but considering you're here, figured I'd ask.</br>  <br>I've got four NAS servers with backups on it so when jewcop thinks hes won I will release it all to the masses. This thread should be deleted anyway.</br>  <br><br>Since when has Daiz ever told lies?</br></br>  <br> not paying for something you like </br>  <br>Daiz what are your takes on terrible genres like NTR and vore?</br>  <br> supporting artists </br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>No bully.<br>Everyone likes money. This jewing just doesn't take advantage of anyone, besides the authors. But they always get beaten up anyway.</br></br>  <br> paying for something you can get for free </br>  <br>The thing I find issue is that all this is doing is pushing out the people who were responsible for giving us the material to enjoy in the first place. <br><br>It's like CrunchyRoll/HorribleSubs meets porn: look how many sub groups are active today in comparison to 2-3 years ago: you've got FFF, UTW, and maybe a handful of semi-active ones. Same goes for porn, only a few groups out there like the one that Hayate trip runs are still active and it's kind of sad to see the people who liked doing this as a hobby getting muscled out by a suit with shit taste in porn.</br></br></br>  I formally ask to the mods of /a/ to permaban Daiz.<br>he's one of the few people I've seen in all these years that actually deserve it.<br>this whore of a man must get the fuck off and never come back</br></br>  <br><br>He's done way more for the community than you ever have.</br></br>  <br> There are no "hired shills" posting here. <br> I'm basically the only person that works for FAKKU that also actively posts on /a/ <br> it's just something I do on my own time. <br>ｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ</br></br></br></br>  <br> pushing out the people who were responsible for giving us the material to enjoy in the first place. <br>But it's the artists who are responsible, and what fakku is doing is putting them first. It's the right thing to do</br></br>  <br>Sadly that's not information that can be shared to the public.<br><br>I'd love if it was, but it's not.<br><br>The artists have definitely been happy about the whole English publishing thing, though.<br><br><br>Well, it is a bit more niche book content-wise, so other books have ended up getting prioritized over it. But it'll definitely come out eventually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That fucking ending.</br>  <br>Just stop shitposting you piece of shit.</br>  <br><br>Pre-paid debit cards</br></br>  <br> 4 NAS servers  <br> filled with jap porn  <br>im counting on you anon</br></br></br>  <br>You should probably just leave. We all hate Daiz but we also respect all he's done for us</br>  <br>You killed fansubbing and now you are trying to kill hentai. Good job, Daiz.</br>  <br> serious about porn <br>lol i bet you download and save porn also kek</br></br>  Amusing.  <br><br>Why yes I do, I only watch porn of the highest quality. I bet you don't even masturbate twice a day.</br></br>  <br> mfw I have everything Fakku has <br> have all the Wani stuff too <br> almost done ripping all of Ex-Hentai's translated content <br> will release it when this shit happens <br>Get fucked, Jacob and Daiz, I'll make sure anyone with half a brain never gives you a dime<br><br><br> killed fansubbing <br> doing anything for us <br>The Fakku shill brigade is in full force tonight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing I find issue is that all this is doing is pushing out the people who were responsible for giving us the material to enjoy in the first place.  <br><br>You mean the authors, animators, and other creators who can only do this if they are able to feed themselves?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm happy with that.</br>  <br> Does that include everyone who'll be working on translating and editing the magazines? <br><br>Yeah. Magazine team is basically one translator (SaHa) and a couple editors right now. Book team's basically the same with different people (YQII as the translator and a bunch of editors). There's also a script editor involved in it all.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>he did a u-turn and fucked everyone in the ass. you respect him for what, brand loyality? do you want to look like a big dawg that doesn't get angry? fucking hypocrites</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's sorta destroying the community.<br>The upside is that at least the audience is broadened, along with the capital and there might be more official exposure out here in the west.<br><br>In the end, the businesses have too much momentum and none of us have any power to stop it (unless you consider DDoSing a valid venue).</br></br></br></br>   employee who is in the know posts facts and answers questions about the situation <br> fuck off shill <br>I, too, like my discussions based on wild speculation rather than fact.</br></br>  Somebody at Forbes must be a weeb, they have had several articles about the anime and manga fandom this year. It's a little irritating to hear them gush on about CR and Fakku though.  <br> respect all he's done for us </br>  <br> where are no hired fakku shills that post here <br> except for me  <br> but i dont get paid for it </br></br></br>  <br>Hey Daiz. This isn't porn related, but do you feel a subscription (As in either pay for a season of shows+library or pay for that individual show) based model for downloading anime with good subtitles will ever happen?</br>   This nigger went to worcester state <br> holy fuck that's way too close to me <br> holy fuck i definitely went to a better school and will never make his munnies </br></br>  <br>We all know Daiz has a harem of little Bangladeshi boys shilling on 4chan, where each post gets them five minutes of reprieve from his affections.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with legitimizing an emerging market even if it's porn and fairly tiny. I'm just sad it's always chinese and jews that are cashing in on this stuff, because they don't have very high quality standards as long as they're making money.</br>  <br>But only in the US, I presume?</br>  <br>I imagine you'll start taking in more people after a while.</br>   yfw fakku will make futa mainstream as well as bring to mainstream america Loli   <br> we also respect all he's done for us <br>Speak for yourself you fucking mongoloid.</br></br>  <br>You forgot your tripcode, Daiz.</br>  <br> But it's the artists who are responsible, and what fakku is doing is putting them first. It's the right thing to do <br>Not really anon, it goes from a situation where we can get our shit easily and for free to a monopoly where we have to pay to look at cartoon porn.<br><br>The weeb sector isn't going to make any significant difference to artists, this will only line the pockets of the faggots who manage to convince you that this is for the artists, and not himself.<br><br>I swear to god you faggots never learn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> niche book <br>Not really. It was on top of the charts in Japan for a few weeks if I recall. But whatever, I'm relieved. I had a suspicion it was taking this long because of the legality of its content not because of its marketability. <br><br>I just hope Inoue Kiyoshirou's book doesn't take this long. I mean. That was a chart topper for months.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Artists need support, you fucking jew.<br><br>The only good things in this world come from art.</br></br></br></br>  <br> sites/laurenorsini <br> I write about the business of fandom. </br></br>  <br> yfw american censors and control organs put their hands on futa and loli <br>you like it mainstream uh?</br></br>  <br>that could only end badly</br>  <br> he did a u-turn and fucked everyone in the ass <br>Go on, explain in what way did he do a u-turn or fucked anyone in the ass?</br></br>  <br> more western knockoffs <br> more Avatar <br> more Teen Titans <br>Oh god no.</br></br></br></br>  sometimes i think about directly sending money to sanbun kyoden because he has ruined me and i NEED his work to fap now  <br> respect all he's done for us <br>Thank you for everything,  Daiz. </br></br>  <br> Do you think somebody would do that, just go on the internet and tell lies? </br>  <br>You guys really need more people.</br>  <br>Monetizing the volunteering activity of a community is enough?</br>   Jacob is only 29 years old and is on the way to becoming a multimillionaire by owning the CR of hentai <br><br>Are you jealous?</br></br>  <br> futa <br> mainstream <br>This might happen now that the homos can get married. I imagine the next big social bandwagon will be trans acceptance/rights.</br></br></br>  <br>They just need more dog knots in the ass</br>  <br>doesn't fakku just get all of it's material from months old ehentai posts?<br><br>I don't understand</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not jealous because I don't like sucking dicks</br></br>  <br>That's like saying DeviantArt will make futa mainstream.<br>Psst, it didn't and it won't.</br></br>  <br>Yes. That being said it would probably be faster to make a list of people I am not jealous of rather than the opposite.</br>  <br> Make your own site and give 5% more to the artists <br> lel out loud when you take his muney </br></br>  <br>Totally Spies was bretty good tbh</br>  <br> "Poppa Jacob, we're doing a project in school about our parents, can you tell me all about your job?" </br>  Why are people so autistic about Fakku? I havent used it in years but I mean, come on. What they're doing is super cool and helps expand the industry. <br><br>What's the argument against it? Content removal isn't a problem; just go literally anywhere else if you want doujinshi. There is absolutely no shortage of piracy sites. Jacob isn't accountable for Wani's actions and to begin with we aren't entitled to H-manga.<br><br>It's respectable to be a smart consumer and again, I havent even purchased from Fakku. But you can't just blindly reject the pursuit of progress. We have to go forward somehow.</br></br></br></br>  If I had the means I'd instead donate to the artists directly or buy the jp mags/tanks.<br><br>Like how ShindoL sent a cake for donors on Patreon.</br></br>  <br>Someone have a brain seems.<br>now put on that the fact that homosexuality is being forced as politically correct without the slightest hint of sexuality and not accepting it is socially unacceptable.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I indeed do it for free. That's why I only post about it on /a/, a place I regularly visit and enjoy.<br><br><br>If you think I've done sort of U-turn then you clearly didn't know me well enough. I've talked for years about how legal digital distribution is where the real shit could happen if the companies involved actually cared.<br><br><br> subscription <br> downloading <br><br>Probably not.

I would gladly spit on your fucking face</br></br>  Hopefully the USA will join the free trade treaty. That will help free trade and capitalism. That will put an end to these debates about who bothers paying for porn when they can steal it easily. The best thing about criminalizing media counterfeiting is that it allows the police to seize and then impound the property used to implement the crime. The seized property can later be sold at auction to help benefit the city's budget. Already, various property used in other crimes are sold such as computers, cars, houses, boats, and even mobile homes. If you distribute (or sell) drugs out of your home, it can be seized. Note that distribution is not necessarily selling as a house that is used to store drugs prior to sale can also be seized. It will be a real test of the law if a home is seized after media is distributed from it via the internet. But this test case will never occur if media counterfeiting is not criminalized.  <br> i sell cartoon porn on the internet <br> i charge people 10 dollars a month to jerk off to all the porn comics japan can produce </br></br>  <br>the problem with it is<br> paying for porn </br></br>  Just you wait.

But sadly I don't see the second one happening too often.<br><br>Also, holy shit people are really defending fakku now I wasn't expecting this.</br></br>  <br>That's actually hilarious</br>  <br>It's more than about porn, though.

There'll be fucking CNN shit stories and then the fucking "board" will try to make the product "family friendly".</br>  It's because Jacob has been able to hire shills using the monies he's getting now.<br><br>also they have a DMCA bot that issues takedown notices to the panda nearly instantly nowadays, apparently. Some anons mention how they'll see something go up only for it to have been taken down an hour later.</br></br>  <br> Jewcob shows off his new subscription model.jpg </br>  <br>The funny thing is whether we will see all the fakku monthly/weekly releases promptly ripped on Nyaa or will Diaz use his powers to pull down everything.</br>    <br> I don't get paid <br> I get paid <br>Make up your fucking mind.</br></br></br>  He cannot convince anybody. It's like with any other business like this, there's two sides of the spectrum: extreme autists (people paying gooks 200-400$ for a tank translation) and extreme casuals (golly, there's only fakku on the internet, guess I've got to pay now).<br><br>As for choice, choice is good, because  as a scanlator  I think hentai is fucking overrated.<br><br> ALL THE WORKS FROM PINK-SPUNK NEED TO BE TRANSLATED XD <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gas everyone on this thread, you fucking kikes deserve a real holocaust.  <br> no replies </br>  <br>Can you not read?</br>  <br>how much do you get paid?</br>  <br>I swear I'm going to punch your fucking face if I ever met you at a con you shiller motherfuck</br>  <br>I don't get paid to post on 4chan about FAKKU.

I just haven't bought anything Fakku because I haven't given a shit about anything they've released.</br>  <br> I don't get paid to post on 4chan about FAKKU. </br>  <br>The reason it gets taken down is simply because it's part of the sadpanda's policy to take down stuff that is not allowed.

Both of that was confirmed by Oda.</br></br>  <br>tinman= supernova with metal powers<br><br>though I suppose it could be<br><br>Lion=Pekoms<br>Scarecrow=Baron Tamago<br>TinMan=?<br>Dorothy=Big Mom/three-eyed girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all this conjecture <br> pls go <br><br>nah. Coby is a bitch and will forever be a bitch no matter how many times Garp punches him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tin man is hand axe Morgan.</br>  <br>That makes him Vice Admiral level<br><br>Coby in the second chapter would have loved to have been Vice Admiral and thought it impossible Now he would realize how shit vice admirals are compared to the real world</br></br></br>  <br>Oda also confirmed that he only reached the captain rank as of now iirc.</br>  <br>didnt they kill that fucker?</br>  <br>I meant in terms of power not rank<br><br>mastering rokushiki + haki is easily vice admiral tier seeing how most of them only seem to start to have a grasp of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the lion is wearing sunclasses, and Apoo is a pretty cool guy. <br>coincidence? I think not!</br></br>  <br>No they were bringing him in. He got loose and attacked garp while garp was sleeping<br><br>garp started laughing</br></br></br>  <br> conjecture <br><br>Did you go to retard school? I bet you were the dumbest kid in class. <br><br>Oda literally confirmed most of that. <br><br>Oda flat out said he has advanced CoO and mastered rokushiki. He blatantly went from a little gnome of a human being to a guy who could use basic rokushiki and unlocked CoO pre-skip as well. The fishbone guy after the war said to ask Garp about his Haki and Garp was clearly his mentor. And if retards like Bellamy can get CoA then I'm sure being trained by a legend like Garp he probably has a grasp of it.<br><br>Use your fucking head, you goon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oda confirmed Coby can take out all supernova </br>  <br> And if retards like Bellamy can get CoA <br>bellamy may be retarded, but you make it sound like it's a bad thing that we'll get another retard in the strawhat crew.</br></br>  <br>Your acting like Apoo is some pushover, but he's the strongest of the super novas his powers one hit kill anyone who isn't a logia.</br>  Isn't it sort of weird how a nameless new world fodder could probably fuck off into one of the blues and conquer it by himself yet all the blues have are useless losers like Don Krieg or Arlong? Just like crocodile being dumpstered by a pre-gears luffy, it just feels strange when you try to put it into perspective.  <br> Your acting like Apoo is some pushover <br>no im not, Apoo more-or-less oneshot Kizaru(or did the most when others couldn't touch him)<br><br>Coby couldn't touch Apoo AND he sure as shit cant touch anyone else pre- or post-TS</br></br></br></br>  <br> it just feels strange when you try to put it into perspective. <br>that's because it's a shonen. The powerlevels have to go higher. That's just how the autistic kids in japan roll and oda wants them to vote for one piece although he doesn't need it anymore.</br></br>  <br>why would you want to go to some nowhere sea where nothing is ever happening?</br>   Monet will never poop on your car   <br>so how did croc get stronger while locked up? he was fucking with everyone at marineford. akainu, doffy, mihawk, jozu. alabasta luffy could not do that hed get 1 shot</br>  <br><br>I assume his resolve/haki/ambition came back while being tortured for x amount of months</br></br>  <br>Yeah that's shit tier writing, but the croc at marineford makes more sense than the one at alabasta powerlevelwise</br>  Reminder that Rebecca is a poor man's Vivi.  <br>All logias are made of butter, nobody knows how much damage kizaru would have taken if he didnt avoid it<br><br>To be the biggest fish in a small pond</br></br></br>  Reminder that Vivi is a poor man Rebecca  <br>Vivi is a shit tho I bet she didn't even get bust size boost</br>  <br><br>I brought this up last week.<br><br>It seems far better to me to go be king in east blue than to be yet another nobody in the new world.<br><br>I guess the only reason they don't is because going to east blue and taking the easy route makes you lose strength. Everyone who was a new world legend seemed far weaker in the grandline other than mihawk who was bored.<br><br>Even shanks who was a big name seemed pretty weak in chapter 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   babby5 betrays the family for some asshole she just met despite them raising her from a little kid <br> doffy was the only one who didnt manipulate babby5 and now she'll be used forever <br> tfw </br></br>  <br>I sure hope she didn't <br><br>I JUST WANT SOME VARIETY ODA IS THAT TOO HARD</br></br></br>  <br> shanks <br> pretty weak <br> gets his arm bitten off by a Sea King and it's no big deal to him </br></br></br>  <br>It should have never happened. And don't give me that sacrifice to the new generation bullshit</br>  <br> tfw Oda can draw a huge variety of women but chooses to just go skinny with huge boobs and a pretty face with named characters almost every time </br>  <br> implying you wouldnt give your arm for the reincarnation of your beloved former captain </br>  Does sabo have a dead eye?  <br><br>Can you two just fuck off. /a/ is cancer enough even without you two.</br></br>  <br>he could have just used his Haki to take out the mountain bandits</br>  <br>Fuck off OP<br><br>Your spoiler tags were never funny.</br></br></br>  <br>can you blame the guy for having a bit of fun with some no-names?</br>  is sabo strong or is burgess weak?<br><br>is sabo as strong as doffy? or stronger</br></br>  <br>generally no, but Luffy was still in danger, so that was pretty careless of him.</br>  So considering Luffy used Iva's Hormones and has those Gear techniques that shorten his life/damage his body a little more each time, how long until Luffy is out for the count/severely weakened for an entire arc whilst the crew tries to find a way to save him?  <br>never<br><br>people in one piece live to the hundreds<br><br>even if it cut 40 years off his lifespan he could still live to 80</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP humans live to be 140<br><br>he's fine</br></br></br>  <br>Burgess is pretty unknown, and Sabo got some kinda plot armour right now to hype him up as a huge badass  before he gets the snot kicked out of him by akainu later on in the story . He'd probably get fucked by Doffy's haki though.</br>  <br>The stronger you are, the bigger your dreams. Why conquer the blues when you have the possibility to have one piece?</br>  Could Zoro kill Luffy?  <br>Yes, luffy is weak to swords, that has been established.</br>  <br><br><br>Zoro getting physically dragged around by Luffy is one of my favourite smaller running gags in One Piece.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>no gear 4th completely negated all of doffy's offense when we saw him cut through stone and metal like nothing with those strings<br><br>Zoro would have to go into his "breath of all things" mode to cut luffy but that's way too slow against gear 4th<br><br>Though we haven't seen the extent of zoro's power post timeskip it would have to be something really fancy to beat gear 4th.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I just marathoned through all of one piece again and I have to say oda must be one of the few manga artists who actually got worse when it comes to readability. His art kind of "improved" but it's not nearly as clean anymore and the panelflow is not nearly as easy and comfortable to follow.<br>The first few chapters are so much better in those aspects.<br>The further you go the more it feels like having a stroke while reading. It gets especially bad after the timeskip for some reason.<br>Everything is a disjointed mess now and really hard to follow compared to the first few issues.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel it. It's nice you get more stuff happening each chapter but i'm dyslexic as fuck and it all gets a bit hard to piece together sometimes.</br>  <br>sounds like a personal problem. its just more detailed meaning you can't speed read and get the whole picture</br>  Oda will not live to finish OP.<br><br>I wish I was shitposting.</br></br>  <br>I just love exchange they have afterward<br><br>"I'm going to kill this idiot one of these days"<br>"Sorry Zoro!"</br></br></br></br>  We really need a full recording of this....<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gf9<wbr>SSz1d8oA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>The colour chapters were a lot easier to read for me.<br><br>One Piece just looks really good coloured.</br></br></br>  All this chapter did was drive my hype for Dragon even more. His past and info on the Revolutionaries is one of the biggest reveals I'm waiting for, and Dragon is definitely the scariest looking fucker when he's mad so I can't wait for when he inevitably begins fucking shit up.<br><br>Those poor poor Gorousei</br></br>  Reminder that hammock was the Doffy's cousins slut and they take her virginity  <br> its just more detailed <br>There is more stuff happening at the same time.<br>It's not about detail. I was really fucking surprised by how good the art was in the first chapters.<br>Stuff like cloth folding, perspective, clean inks.<br>Oda was a lot more clean back then.<br>The guy either had great assistants that left him or he started getting swamped by the workload of weekly chapters.<br>But things just got really bad after the timeskip.<br>I mean even pages like this, with no battle going on are nightmareish when it comes to panel composition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nigger chopper in that gif.</br>  <br>Yes, I agree, One Piece world is a world of colour.</br>  <br>Doffys strings could not cut swords.</br>  <br>Why do people never understand that "closer to death" or "shortening your life" is a phrase with a double meaning in Japan?</br>  <br> Robin spent 2 years with the revolutionaries <br> We still don't know anything about them <br><br>I'm suffering</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell us what the meaning is then, Oh great Weeaboo.</br>  <br>I wish they could talk and properly catch up already. Sanji might have learned a thing or two too since Iva was one of the top Revolutionary figures.</br>  <br>As much as people like to bash it FI is probably the best arc he has done artistically.</br>  <br>And Zoro and Fuji's armament haki swords could not cut the Bird Cage, so it evens out.</br>  <br>...what?</br>  <br>This is the biggest problem oda has. The storytelling has just gotten TOO autistic for it's own good.<br>When the manga started and there was a bit of mistery about how the world works and what organizations are there it was cool.<br>But now it has been 20 years of one piece and we still don't know the most basic stuff, other than it being mentioned in some panel from the story chapters that come after every big arc and then completely forgotten again.<br>Remember when capone got sucked in by some huge ufo thing? <br>Now he's back without any explanation.<br>This is just so fucking annoying at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish we got a few more trickles for reveals but at least Oda doesn't forget so when they occur, they'll be fucking huge.</br>  <br> dat resting bitch face <br> those eye brows <br> dat hair line <br> back hair bigger than front <br> mullet <br><br> tfw i'm a literal celestial dragon <br> FUCK </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>enslaved hancock got fucked by doffies "cousins"(tenryuubito/world noble) is what he is trying to say</br>  I feel like there used to be more members in the straw hat crew.<br><br>I could be wrong.</br></br>  <br>When I look at it now.... it looks like Fujitora power</br>  <br>Because they're not japanese? You fucking nong.</br>   mfw I've never seen The Wizard of Oz and have no clue what the fuck everyone is talking about   <br>You're gonna get the D.<br><br><br>I always wondered what those growths on the spherical object were.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think I'll like one piece?<br><br>My favourite anime is fairy tail, I love the characters, humor and friendship stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually prefer the earlier artwork to his current style. Everything felt so crisp and clean, now everything has this jarring Gantz blur to it. I dunno, just looks sloppy.</br>  <br>Exhaust for the Rocketship</br>  <br> &gt;not liking Diamante <br><br>Well, Oda seems to like modeling the occasional character after famous rock stars. That pirate guy from the Syrup Village arc (Kaya &amp; Going Merry) is quite similar to Michael Jackson including the backwards walking. Diamante is modeled after Mick Jagger and even includes the exaggerated lips.</br></br></br>  <br>It looks weird as shit, came out of nowhere and was never explained.<br>Oda keeps stacking more unexplained shit than attack on titan does. And attack on titan already gets tons of shit for dragging out the mysteries and constantly introducing more of them.<br>But I think overall one piece is just fucking worse when it comes to teasing awesome or interesting stuff and then doing a 3 year battle arc with little to no story moving forward.</br></br></br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=759<wbr>HrKwl02Q</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>have at, anon</br></br></br>  <br>It's a classic, at least watch it to add to your general knowledge.</br>  <br>I know people who've never seen it either and they know the gist of it.<br><br>It's essentially girl from Kansas and her dog get blown by a tornado, smash a witch with a house and loot some magic shoes off her, meet a talking scarecrow, a man made of tin and a gay lion, go over to a city made out of emerald to meet the wizard, kill another witch with water, and in the end it was all a dream or was it?</br></br></br>    <br> I actually prefer the earlier artwork to his current style. Everything felt so crisp and clean, now everything has this jarring Gantz blur to it. I dunno, just looks sloppy. <br>I feel ya. The old art was dynamic but not too hard to follow.<br>Currently one piece is way too fucking busy visually and the narrative is on TV DBZ namek tier.</br></br></br>  what are the chances Bonney can use her age powers on people besides herself and we'll get an arc with a young garp?  <br>I'm being serious.. I got to ep 176 and now cant watch anymore of it because it isn't English dubbed and I'm used to hearing all their voices ;_;</br>  <br> Monster trio walk to Arlong Park <br> Usopp clutch against a fishman <br> Zoro literally falling apart <br><br>Shit was so focused and thrilling. What happened</br></br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who thinks Kidd and Luffy are going to be allies?  <br> has this jarring Gantz blur to it. <br>That's just the scanlators doing a terrible job at "cleaning" up the scans. The tankobon art is a lot better too. But I cant find any proper scans.<br>I stopped buying the german version once I had a japanese one piece issue in my hands in some japanese bookstore in munich and noticed the german version looked like someone copied it with a fax machine compared to it.<br>There's just nobody bothering to scan the thing properly and the fresh scanlations are from the shonen jump chapters that are printed on what is basically toilet paper.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br><br>She literally used her powers on other people on her first or second appearance.</br></br>  <br>You can't seriously think that MangaPanda blur is in the original scans...</br>   think of asking friend what sex feels like <br> immediately think it would be the same as asking what One Piece is or if it exists <br>Thanks /a/.</br></br>  <br>I don't expect it to happen but man I want it to. KidLawLu friendship is the best.</br>  <br>Ah, that's a good point, I didn't consider that. What a shame...<br> basically toilet paper <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br> What happened <br>Burnout and oda losing focus.<br>If he cut back on 50% of zany sidecharacters that only exist to cheer on the strawhats things would flow much better.<br>At this point the structure is pretty messed up. There is too much cutting between scenes that dont fucking matter.<br>Who liked the dwarves here?<br>And who liked the senor pink fight that kept interrupting the ruffy dofla duel?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You will never get to live with Monet until both of you pass away from old age what's the point of living</br>  <br>Not the water marks you you  __:^)___ , just some of the shading effect, <br><br>See:<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Senor Pink fight was the only Executive fight that I cared for. Everything else felt like a typical brawl. Zoro vs. Pica wasn't too bad because it was literally Zoro fucking around with Pica the entire time before he finally hunted him down and fucked him up.</br>  <br>Did I mention watermarks? Mangapanda puts a blur effect on the scans, it completely destroys the shading Oda drew originally.</br>  <br> hating on the senor pink fight <br><br>Though I agree the Tontatta were the worst part of this arc.</br></br></br>  <br>That's true, it was bloated with stuff that should have probably been introduced elsewhere. I wish Oda would just take a month or two off and relax, and I say that as a Berserk fan. What Oda does weekly is insanely impressive, but shit's beginning to read like spaghetti.</br>  <br>I really wanted to feel something during the senor pink fight.<br>But I think I'm numb to oda's formula by now.<br>I remember crying during franky's flashback and chopper's flashback... even during brook's flashback.<br>But for some reason the senor pink flashback had no momentum and no buildup.<br>Everything feels so rushed in one piece now and it still drags on.<br>It's really fucking weird. If oda took his time and cut 50% of the shit that doesnt add anything of value it would be much nicer to read.<br>There's this weird flow goin on since the timeskip where oda wants to do too much but then ends up panicing because it takes too long and then starts cutting randomly between several fights during one chapter. Kills all momentum and enjoyment.<br>I think he realized this flaw somewhere during thriller bark and tried to fix it with summit arc and removing the strawhats to streamline shit.<br>But since then it has gotten really bad again.<br>It's not like I'm not enjoying one piece anymore.<br>I'm just not enjoying it as much as I'd like to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gladius vs Bart was pretty awesome too</br>  <br>Fair point. <br><br>Mangapanda is pretty much garbage according to /a/ and I don't have much reason to disagree.</br></br></br>  <br>learn<br>to<br>type<br>properly<br>faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He should have taken a half-year break before the timeskip and plan things out properly.<br>I feel like he's losing it. The constant one week breaks, the completely incoherent narrative, the dragged on arcs, the bullshit sidecharacters.<br>I think kyros was enough of a sidecharacter for this arc, the dwarves were fucking unnescesary.<br>At some point I didn't really care about any of the stuff that was going on anymore and just wanted to see one string of events being finished.<br>Also hasn't sanji been missing for more than a year now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reminder that hammock was the Doffy's cousins slut and they take her virginity </br>  <br>The arc had some great moments, they were just so awkwardly paced that they deflated themselves and tripped over each other's feet.<br>But it was still better than fishman island or punk hazard. But only barely at this point</br></br>  <br> yfw it's luffy's awakened power that's making the story so fucking contrived. </br>  <br>Meh. I don't much care either way for Bart. However, I do want to find out what is in the suitcase.</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>Aw goddamn it. It was going so well, too.</br>  <br>Fishman island is the best arc so far dressrosa is a pretty close second but it is a cluster fuck of shit I don't care about (sabo, Rebecca, tontatas, etc)</br>  <br> Sanji <br> Racked by the guilt of forcing a mentor to become an amputee <br> Now a nose-bleeding gag character gone awol <br><br>Enough</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His work schedule is finally taking its toll.<br>He's going ga-ga.</br></br>  <br>Same goes for Brook, really. It's unfortunate.</br>  <br>Oda should've done it like toriyama and cycle through party members once in a while.<br>I mean he's kinda doing that now but it's just even weirder for some reason.<br>Sanji is useless now.<br>Brook was always useless.<br>Chopper is only there for being cute and selling toys anymore.<br>Nami is more useless than she ever was.<br>Franky is comic relief at this point.<br>The only characters that still do shit are luffy, usopp and robin. And zoro once in a while.<br><br>But it's TOO MANY CHARACTERS ON IDLE OR DOING BORING SHIT THAT WONT ADVANCE ANYTHING</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was brook ever usefull? He never should've become a partymember in the first place.<br>They should've brought him to laboon and then call it a day. I don't see how he brings anything of value to the manga. He's just a wasted slot.<br>Franky is probably also going to become more useless pretty soon. Oda has no idea what to do with him.</br></br></br>  So it's pretty obvious that Usopp will get a huge rise in his bounty, but what do you think the chances that the World Government will treat this bounty rise different to his Sniper King persona are? As in they'll think Usopp and Sniper King are two separate members of the Straw Hats. I know that the Admirals of the marines can make the connection, and anyone else with a worthwhile name/title but having said that, what do people think about this?<br><br>Also bonus question, do you all think there may be a chance that Usopp may bring out the Sniper King disguise for the next arc or one upcoming and raise that bounty on top of his inevitable 'God Usopp' bounty?</br></br>  <br> Fishman island is the best arc so far <br><br>I can't tell if you're trolling or not, but I respect someone with a fresh opinion. I personally loved skypiea and thought Alabasta was okay.</br></br></br>  <br>Franky is that guy that fucks off someplace solo and fucks shit up.</br>  <br><br>I've only just caught up on the manga, and I've enjoyed the timeskip around as much as everything else.<br><br>I wonder if it's because I'm reading it all at once. I think all the Punk Hazard running or jumps between different characters would really frustrate me weekly, but reading it at once, it seems to be okay. For me, anyway. I think I'll follow One Piece weekly until it gets into it's next battle arc, then dip until the arc is finished. Seems to be the most enjoyable way to read it to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"He never should've become a partymember in the first place"<br><br>You're talking about the musician that Luffy has sought after since the first book here. He's 100% necessary if you ask me, but that's just one guy's opinion</br></br></br>  Why did oda kill best girl?  <br>I'm serious the fights were meh but the story, info, and build up were classic oda.</br>  <br>This is what Franky does best. Need a building or certain area demolished, or any type of battlefield set up? Franky is your man.</br>  <br> slut <br> tattoos <br> open shirt </br></br></br>  <br> Usopp may bring out the Sniper King disguise for the next arc <br><br>Valid questions, and I have no idea. A return of Sogeking would be amazing, but I don't remember if Luffy ever made the connection.</br></br></br>  <br>Kid popped a pretty huge boner for Luffy in Sabaody<br><br>I think he'll be creeping after Luffy's ass in the future like Shiki used to do to Roger<br><br> Join me Mugiwara no Rufi...! <br> With our combined might we can rule the seas <br> &gt;  いやだ。 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Kidd was impressed by Luffy punching a Celestial Dragon in the face, and Kidd, Luffy, and Law rekt a pacifista together. Kidd was impressed how crazy Luffy's crew was.</br>  <br>:_:</br>  <br>Honest talk, but I don't think Luffy and Chopper will ever work it out. There may even be a moment where he'll tell them and they'll just think he's bullshitting and tell him to shut the fuck up.</br>  <br><br>Brook's problem is when he was introduced, I think. As soon as he joined, the strawhats were seperated.<br><br>From a storytelling point of view, he's spent like, what, a week's worth of days with the strawhats and two years apart? I suppose his loyalty to Luffy makes sense given the events at Thriller Bark, but still. Franky hasn't ACTUALLY spent that much in universe time with the SHs either.<br><br>And even that doesn't really give Brook an excuse for doing little during PH/FI/Dressrosa.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  We are still reading this right?  <br>Every day OP, every day.</br>  Why is blonde such a big slut?

This disappoints me.</br></br>  <br>I'm a simple minded man. Fix it yourself.</br>  <br><br>I like it. It just needs some more kinky violence.</br></br>  <br>it's adorable that she uses hiragana and katakana in her bubbles.</br>    <br>You forgot flicking her forehead.</br>  <br><br><br> hiragana and katakana  <br><br>Whom uses what and what doe's it imply?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's at speaking Japanese. Imagine an accent, I guess.</br>  I am both looking forward to and dreading the next few days' worth of pages<br>I don't know if I'll be able to stand it if Tomo cries</br>  <br>Misuzu must be laughing hard inside.</br>  <br><br>Misuzu doesn't laugh, she plots.</br></br>  <br>Ha ha time for forced drama!</br>  <br>It is not forced drama if it was planned by the devil.</br>  <br>Do your worst.</br>  I hope this gets an anime someday. I wanna hear Tomo-chan speak.  <br><br>She's not the devil, she's a good friend.</br></br>  I can't tell who's more popular in these threads, Tomo or Misuzu.  <br>That's not a problem. So far there hasn't been any "X A SHIT, XFAGS PLS GO, Y A BEST" shitposting.</br>  <br>She'll probably cut her in half too.</br>  <br>not yet</br>  <br>I dont get it why people get worked up over a delusion ntr?</br>  <br><br>I think Misuzu gets more posts.</br></br>  <br> implying thats better </br>  <br> /a/ loves to be contrarian and retarded <br>sounds about right. Everyone knows Tomo is the best</br></br>  <br>Tomo is great, is just that Mizusu has that something, the osananajimi factor.</br>  <br>I think everyone already acknowledges this and talking about her only would make these threads rather monotone.</br>  <br><br>I know this, but Misuzu does things for me. And I want her to do more things.</br></br>  Why is this guy releasing one page a day?  <br> starting best girl wars <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't help that cool girls are my favorites.</br></br>  I think i know how Misuzu messes with them. It's so amusing.  <br>There are still those sick fucks who ship Jun and Misuzu.</br>  <br> She's a good friend <br><br>Literally the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Because we've caught up. It's a once a day strip, just so happens that when it first got translated there was a huge backlog.</br>  <br>I'm curious as to what Misuzu would have done if Jun wasn't around to catch the molester. Just what could she do, and why does it scare  and arouse  me?</br>  <br>She would have punch him herself. She was only embarrassed because Jun was there.</br>  <br>To be fair if Jun hadn't been there, Tomo would have wrecked the guy. She only held back because she was embarrassed about Jun finding out.</br>  tomboy by MAL  do not bully the tomboy  <br>What's the difference?</br>  <br>but anon<br><br>I do want to talk about sports with her.</br></br></br>  Just picked it up, this is great  <br>I don't get why anons are trying to force this shitty manga to be related to GOAT Tomo-chan.</br>  <br>I like hearing people talk about things they're passionate in though. It makes me feel fuzzy inside when they talk about things they like..</br>  How long until misuzufags and shipfags start to ruining these threads?  <br>Now.</br>  <br>Those skirts are stupidly short.</br>  <br>It's just a fag forcing it evra tomboy thhread. just ignore it</br>  <br> dem spats <br>Muh dick is diamonds.</br></br>  <br>I think she goes spats-less now tho</br>  <br><br>It feels weird seeing Tomo with Red hair. I always imagine her with black hair.</br></br>  <br>Sawashiro</br>  <br>Yeah what the fuck are with those school uniforms? The betafag on the far right doesn't even have the jacket like the other 2 guys.<br>And short skirts are to be expected in anime, but how did Misuzu get such a long skirt when she is shorter/smaller than the other 2 girls? Also, the girls don't even seem to be wearing matching school colors at all. <br>Fucking doesn't make any sense, man.</br></br></br>  <br>Tomo said herself she has the skirt hemmed short because it's easier to move around. Cotton Candy is a slut.</br>  <br>I would fuck Jun. <br><br>No homo</br></br></br>    Why is Jun so mean?  <br>On top of just generally being cold to people besides Tomo? He's using most of his energy to suppress his sexual urges for the delicious tomboy, which has left him a bit on edge.</br>  <br>I think he likes her but doesn't know yet.</br>  <br><br>This. That was the first moment he saw her as a sexy lady.</br></br>  <br> your best friend is a GUY since forever <br> next day  <br> your best friend has big boobs and wear a skirt <br>What face would you make?</br></br></br></br>  being an athlete Tomo's virgin pussy would be even tighter  <br>I wonder at what point Jun realized that he's a fucking idiot? He may still act the same, but maintaining the status quo is pretty much the only response you can have when you fuck up this badly.</br>  <br>Actually I had a friend who pop her cherry during atletism</br>  <br>but her vaginal muscles would be tighter than virgin part. The hymen merely blocs the entrance. She may not bleed but the still moan like a virgin</br>  <br> moan <br>no anon, virgins don't moan when they're cherry is being popped. they scream and nag<br> omg it's so painful <br> aaaahhhh <br> stop stop stop! <br> i don't want to do this anymore <br> ok let's try one more time </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ur makin muh dick diamonds, m8</br>  <br>This. He's trying to keep up the act because if he acknowledges her as a girl, he's got to reexamine how much of an asshole he's been. Like completely shooting down her confession. Or giving Tomo a brotap to the ass, which is an even bigger one in light of the molester plot.</br>  <br>my wife then girlfriend took it like a pro even if it hurt. I guess the hour long foreplay helped</br>  remember theres a fucked up manga about thin Himegoto Juukyuusai?  <br> haaaah... <br> fuu...... <br><br>He can't keep it any more</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's shit now.  After faglord screwed up with tomboy </br>  <br>He likes her, but he doesn't want to.<br>He just wants to be bros with her, but his dick is killing him</br></br>  <br> He can't keep it in anymore <br> He soon confesses and the series ends by 120 <br>Be honest /a/, how would you feel?</br></br></br>  <br>tomboy is still a virgin. They stopped remember</br>  <br>I want to see them fug. mangaka could do his former job and draw a canon doujin</br>  <br> he confesses <br> the series continues with cute tomboy relationship as the focus </br></br>  <br> Jun confesses <br> Tomo bro taps him. <br> "What are you talking about? I love you too, bro!" <br> Y-yeah <br> 120 more chapters, but with reversed roles. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>has anyone even done that? Black lagoon doesn't count.</br>  <br><br>There is more that could happen after they get together.<br><br>Anyway, its not going to happen. We need to know what that British slags agenda is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? I didn't know that!<br><br>Pics pls</br></br></br>  <br>there's a 1-inch omake box and an art book page or two, neither of which I have saved.</br>  <br>If he does confess, they could turn this into a semi Yandere Konojo kind of thing, which would be fantastic.</br>  <br>Best time of the day!</br>  what is with the egg jokes, I missed something    <br>I'm not 100% on this but it might have come from Boku Girl, at least that was the first time I saw it brought up, someone gave the image with blank speech bubbles and someone filled this in.</br>  <br><br> You wouldn't want to talk about sports with her <br><br>Not everyone here is a fat loser whose interests are limited solely to anime, video games, and stuffing their faces :^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait what are they doing after school?</br>  <br>Often confused with  mayonegg. </br>  <br>an old meme from raildex generals</br>  <br>holy shit, i can see this happening</br>  <br>it started with the accelerator panel</br>  ITT: Guess others' favorite anime based on the loli they make.<br><br>https://2995c29805bc626322462667989<wbr>40ee013527468.googledrive.com/host/<wbr>0B31ASET0VYFvWjE5SEtwZWZmbjg/chara.<wbr>swf</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>    Guess my favorite anime if I just stripped the loli.
