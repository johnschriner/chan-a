Its like plastic memories, only the same.    Not now, please.  I never finished it because when I watched it for the first time I was at the stage when I was extremely autistic about reading the source material of the adaptations first, but I couldn't find scans at the time.   As far as I've watched it was still better than Plastic Memories, though.    This is what I think of Mahoromatic.  What the fuck did I just watch    Not knowing moon already       We can't get all our answers, anon    I'm European, tho.    I'm not liking the 3d models.     Precure Thread     You wouldn't understand until you fully embrace your inner little girl.   So Majorina got a  boobylicious  facelift/upgrade for this episode, but nothing for the other generals? What a rip-off.  Can't decide between playing some games I bought during the summersale Start up Football manager Or continue watching Precure  Honoka would probably tell me to finish Max Heart..       The other generals aren't witches.    Had to decide too, but I'm watching cures all semester so I should spend holidays differently.   夜空に浮かぶ星達は一人ぼっちの寂しさと巡り合う喜びを繰り返して長い時の<wbr>中をすれ違っていきます 今日の予報は流星雨。星空を見上げていると、今はまだ出会えていないどこか<wbr>のだれかの事をふと思ってしまいます その誰かも同じようにこの星空を見上げていて星達は空からそんな私達の姿を<wbr>見守っていてくれるはずです  "The stars flying in the broad night skies are crossing paths within the long passage of time after feeling lonely and joy again and again. Today's prediction is meteor shower. If you look up to the skies, you will remember of someone from somewhere you haven't yet meet. That person shall also look up into the starry skies, and the stars will watch over us from the cosmos."  Gainax, you sucked most of the time. But this show is a great parting present. See you again someday.      </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>    Will they make an OVA if I do?  Won't my Subaru be lonely without a Minato?  These are important questions.         If I ever get my license or enough money for a car, Subaru will likely be at the top of my mind.    Subaru CEOs are big weebs     No, Greenhouse Minato goes back to being in a coma and Dark Minato becomes a transfer student who gardens with Subaru.   But how did Dark Minato know current day Subaru? He seemed familiar with her and that he knew about the times they talked at the greenhouse.   No, but it may be implied if you really want a happy ending.  I really want it and it probably is a happy end.    I thought we just got a timeskip, Minato was always in coma, magical and afterwards dark Minato were just the boy's soul or something like that.  But we see Minato in the hospital room and he's fine. He also takes the strawberries the nurse left him.  Also the Prez takes that star fragment from Minato. I interpreted that as Dark Minato.                I think some Anon indeed bought a Subaru. People were joking that he funded an entire episode on his own.  I'm a poorfag college student, but I'll consider Subaru first when I have enough money.      Are there any influential anime from this decade?  Pic maybe related?    SAO K-On!   Where are my spoilers?!   Are they fading too, like my powers?      Her quirk is creating boners right?      It doesnt look so bad, but it suits the original owner better    Her quirk is making dicks grow right?   <br/>  Remember me /a/ ? Remember when you had fun watching my show? You haven't forgotten about me have you?     We had a thread a few hours ago and one yesterday with 300+ posts, now fuck off    Well you should at least watch 5 since it's the best and prettiest episode in the show and were all the budget in the show went to.   I remember you. I just finished your show recently and loved it. Especially the part where  you and Mako were canon lesbians  and /a/ couldn't accept it.   unless you are a characters from a chinese browser game, yeah /a/ will forget you    i demand proof in the form of pictorial evidence   Who was best tan?   Oh trust me Anon, we all noticed Rat's legs And those delicious thighs And cats delicious thighs And those school outfits  Give me a minute, I seemed to have spilled some milk and it got everywhere          Can't hate a crying Rat.     OH god, this guy gets it.    You're missing Rat's delicious vagina bones. And Cat's delicious navel peek. And Rat's tail.        Episode 23 was based off the book Dune  the /lit/ inside me cringes but it's /a/, so it can't be helped.       How do you feel about Sakura?   Off the top of my head, I can't think of any right now. Ask the sadpanda thread when one's up.    Thanks for the heads up.    QT    I bet my ass that isn't toothpaste    Sakura is the first anime character I've been obsessed with and she was my first figure buy. She might be my waifu if I have one   Summary anon delivers  Previous thread  just 5-8% remaining of chapter 5 and epilogue.  Neorigami best girl, Phantom best mom (?).

DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?         Why does Josefumi have 3 circles in his eyes, but Josuke doesn't?    name one time Dio actually touched the protagonists in Part III.   I don't think you should ask this unless you like doujins       That filename   Lost      I'll wait to more chapters or information about him. But, talking about how he looks, man I thought Joshuu was ugly.   Will Togashi die before he finishes Hunter X Hunter?   I love how understated HxH's humor is. 10/10.   Is it wrong that I feel as though Killua has the most potential for growth in the series? I mean next to Gon of course, of course Kurapika is OP just because of his bullshit eyes.   Just imagine when they reach adulthood, they'll be walking God hunters, also I don't see the fascination with Gin. He is regarded and viewed as some OP hunter but is he really that strong? He was said to be among the top nen users in the world.   I just see him as a shitty father who wants to go live in space with aliens.        most potential for growth in the series is potential power level  ur boring       not wanting Princess Naoko to take over her husbands work and turn all the boys into cute Sailor Senshi       Is it wrong that I feel as though Killua has the most potential for growth in the series?  Not with that personality and diet.   but is he really that strong? He was said to be among the top nen users in the world.  You just answered your own question.   I just see him as a shitty father who wants to go live in space with aliens.  What does that have to do with his strength?        </blockquote>]
