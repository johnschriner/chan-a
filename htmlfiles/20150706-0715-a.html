Why can't more anime do this?<br><br> 10 minutes later <br> gets found out <br> transferred to MAGIC HIGHSCHOOL <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is white haired bitch so annoying?</br>  It's probably some bullshit about their powers or timeloop thats gonna cause the bigass drama.  <br><br> by cheating he's harming himself and others <br><br>Motherfucker, are you for real.<br><br>History is written by the victors, not by the just. That's how our world works. You'd like to think it's the opposite, but that's not. If Hitler, in world war 1 and 2 had actually taken over the world successfully, or Napoleon before him; their ideals and values would be our new history, not America's or Great Britain's or anyone else's.<br><br>Finally, cheating is harmless. If others get screwed over, too bad. That's just life. It doesn't exist to coddle you. Some people win, some people win big, and others lose. Nothing in life has ever been fair, and trying to make the world a giant hug box is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying MC won't ditch his asshole personality and be revealed to have a heart of gold followed by some tragic backstory that explains why he acts the way he does <br><br>There is no such thing as a real asshole MC. It's always either an act or there's always a reason for it.</br></br>  Here's the thing. They see MC as a threat because he has proven that he is in no way to be trusted to use his powers in any ethical way.<br><br>They wrecked stuff to get to MC, but he has put peoples lives in danger to set up a fucking romantic encounter. He puts their lives in danger to get some action, with the possibility that they could die if things go wrong, and he is somehow not a complete moron for doing so? Not to mention he possesses girls to peek at their boobs. That has to be some kind of molestation.<br><br>So, MC has shown that people's lives don't matter, he can force women to expose themselves to him, cheats at everything with no one noticing, and he somehow isn't a threat to the public?<br><br>If this were the X-Men he'd have a sentinel up his ass before anyone could say "Din du nuffin."</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Project Hrunting <br> Get arrow that never misses <br> Project and attach Caladbolg <br> Arrow that never misses + nukes everything <br> Project and attach Rule Breaker <br> Arrow now never misses + nukes everything + breaks servant contracts on hit, so if they survive they're fucked <br><br>Why didn't Archer do this and turn the grail war into a done deal? It beats literally everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Lancelot didn't also take injuries stalling Gawain <br>Was fine enough to wreck him after buff was gone.<br><br> Implying EMIYA didn't have multiple NPs to get pass God Hand <br>KoH, A rank STR.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A rank STR. He can literally kill him 12 times with different methods.</br>  Chances are, the shit would take too long and a crapton of mana. Probably can't keep more than one of those arrows in existence at once. Like, other than the obvious, when is he or Shirou shown dual wielding? The whole issue with Rule Breaker in the first place was that it was shit as a weapon. Why the fuck not just use it offhand? Why not trace Berserker's axe and use it as an arrow for a straight Nine Lives and just go full Touhou on their ass? The only way I can make sense of it is that he has to discard and draw, or certain shit's beyond what he can do.  <br>A-rank strength is not the same as an A-rank attack. If you don't throw an NP or spell with a high ranking they will just bounce off. Lancelot swinging a scrub item as low-tier NP won't do shit.</br>  If Archer can change the structure of swords he's copying to suit his battle style like he did with Caladbolg when he turned it into arrow, why can't he take the best aspects of all swords he owns and create one ultimate blade?  Is it a fact that the strongest Nasu protagonist is Shirou Emiya? He becomes a  servant  later in life and even takes down a Servant on his own.  Even if he kill part of Reality Marble that means he will be dead because of cosmic radiation and vacuum  Pointless discussion as Tsukihime remake will shift powerlevels once again.  <br>Actually, the biggest avatarfags are Shiroufags. They post a heck of a lot more Shirou/Archer reaction pictures, they post a heck of a lot more Shirou x Saber/Rin pics just to bump threads. They also ransack threads that have Diarmuid x Saber in it. They also post a lot of fanfiction stories about Shirou having harems and shit.<br>These are things that Shikifags barely do. Probably because there are less Shikifags overall.</br></br>  <br>Then explain how Archer can access it WITHOUT a master.<br><br>Literally checkmated</br></br></br>  <br>Not if it's never released</br>  Why does she wear the mask?  Great first episode but I can see it getting old pretty quick unless it goes in an unexpected direction   <br>Just imagine they're living in Sweden.</br>  <br>No one cared about her panties until she wore them on her face.</br>  <br>Was she the only one who didn't cum in the gym?</br>  <br><br><br>Reminds me of SYD. The acting there was also top-notch.</br></br></br>  <br>It's too stupid!</br>  Pretty good start overall and the story is pretty good at least on the LN. what do you think /a/.<br><br>Also <br> FREMY THE ONLY BEST GIRL <br> RABBIT CAN SUCK DICKS AND GTFO </br></br></br></br>  Awful first episode<br><br>the exposition and constant talking was extremely off-putting <br><br>The fights looked fun though and I feel strong waifu game coming, i'm hoping it picks up in the next episode at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with talking.</br>  <br> and I feel strong waifu game coming, <br>Fremy and Chamo are great waifus. Nothing wrong with talking.</br></br>  <br>Good news.</br>  <br>Chamo literally looks down at her in disgust and smacks her around a few times. I think she did apologize though</br>  Who on earth would want to lick lolibutt? That just sounds really gross.  <br>Because they probably aren't that good at Japanese.<br><br>Scripted dialogue, especially porn, is completely different from an afterward written conversationally especially if it's long like <br> <br><br>I don't scanlate nor am I by any means fluent but that's my guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and the substances their bodies produce. </br>  <br>to virgins with low standards maybe</br>  <br> I don't scanlate nor am I by any means fluent <br>You seem fluent enough to do what they cant.</br></br>  <br>I would buy that edition of Rampage.<br><br>First time I played Rampage was an old old old DOS version as a kid. It was awesome. You never do it these days, but it was made so you could squish three people in front of a keyboard and have them controlling the game co-op on just that one keyboard.
