[  [HorribleSubs] Ore Monogatari!! - 15 [720p].mkv   threads for this show are so dead  <br>The show gave everyone diabetes and they're dead now.</br>  <br>The show gave everyone AIDS and they're dead now. The ones who survived are cancer.</br>  Saijou a slut<br>Suna best bite the bullet and distract her for Takeo and Yamato</br>  I didn't even know this series was still going on.    <br>I always forget until every week when our persistent OP makes a thread about it. <br>It's not a bad show, it's fun and sweet, but it's very repetitive and little happens so there's never anything to say about it.</br></br>   Cucking Yamato <br><br>My dick is diamonds.</br></br>    Saijou a cute. I hope we see more of her.  <br>Is it just me or is this episode full of QUALITY?</br>  <br>It was bound to happen eventually, they gotta save the budget somewhere.</br>  <br><br>Saijou a stacked<br>I hope we see MORE if her</br></br></br>  <br>It's just you.</br>  Best girl.  <br>She's pretty cute.</br>  This face was priceless.<br>Watching Himouto and OreMono back to back isn't good for my heart.</br>  <br>Destined to lose, such is the fate of being the best girl</br>  <br>The development for her was better than Yamato just suddenly falling in love with a bear. Either way, this isn't that kind of show/manga, so it's not even that she's gonna lose. She was never allowed to run in the first place.</br>  <br>All the girls are best girls.</br>    <br> just suddenly falling in love with a bear. <br>A bear that saved her butt and is handsome</br></br>  Saijou was actually cute as fuck<br><br/></br>  <br><br>Yamato was a treasure trove of reaction shots this episode. Not as much as Ai was in the previous ones, but still a good source of images and WebM to follow.</br></br>  is there porn yet?  Is it just me, or do her boobs look insanely huge?  <br>I think they are in the show's universe<br>I think Yamato and Suna's sister were both pretty flat</br></br>  <br>Show should have been divided in seasons with 6 months between them, Now it's dragging.</br>  <br>Yamato only really noticed how big her chest was, so yeah they are supposed to be pretty large.</br>  <br>She's fucking stacked compared to everyone else.</br>  <br>Why do you think she runs so slowly?</br>        <br>what an ikemen</br>  REMOVE SAIJOU SAN  <br>Behead those who insult Saijou-san</br>  Is Yamato's yan awakening?  <br>THERE WILL BE BLOOD<br>SHED</br></br>  <br>I hope there's more of her in the future.</br>  <br> Crepe scene <br>she's a bitch<br><br> Can I call you master? <br>MY DICK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that Takeo :^) </br>  <br>She'd just do really petty things that would backfire on her. Like making Saijou's food really spicy but Saijou actually loves spicy food.</br>  <br> Takeo my obento is really spicy all of a sudden! <br> SOU KA <br> C-can you chew it for me first, you know because of the spice <br> UNN </br></br></br></br>  where did these koreans come from  <br> I'm not hungry anymore, you can have the rest Takeo! <br> ARIGATOU </br></br>  <br>They were comparatively bigger in the manga, but since it's shoujo you wouldn't notice it because that wasn't the focus on her character.</br>  <br>The boys in the audience didn't get excited when she ran, so I'm assuming they're closer to moderately sized rather than huge</br>  Can't believe i'm saying it but this show really should have been just one cour, or a season delay between cours.<br>I thought the show was great the first few episodes and that I would be sad when it was over.<br>However the show has become stale as fuck, its just the same shit over and over.<br> TAKEO KAKKOII~ <br> YAMATO SKI DUH~ <br>The new girl would make things interesting, but going off how the shows progressed so far, nothing interesting will come out of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, this face looks familiar.</br>    Why can't he just have a 3 some<br><br>Yamato said she could come to like her</br></br>  <br>Yamato is a slut and wouldn't share.</br>  Oh wow another setup, what shame that literally nothing will happen in this dead show in the end.  What a qt  <br>Wait so now you have to share the guy that you're faithful to with other girls to not be considered a slut?<br>Why is 4chan so sexist?</br></br>     lost the bowl before she even entered <br>;_;</br>  Saijou going for the long con, I can respect that.<br>First I call you Master, then I suck your dick.</br>  Why am I Takeo in fat  <br> tfw she confessed her feelings in such a way as to never have a chance at Takeo <br><br>The realest sacrifice.</br></br></br>  <br> respecting whores </br>  <br>Feels bad</br>  <br>In addition to fiercly chasing after the Takeo-D, she also makes Yamato more interesting.<br>That's worthy of respect.</br></br>  <br>best taste</br>    <br>nice crop job fag.</br>  <br> stealing cute girl's husbando <br> meta argument <br><br>nah, try again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks guy</br>  <br>She's not stealing, she's trying to steal.<br>And we all know she's going to fail, that's why I'm fine with it.</br></br>  <br>Opposite for me. I didn't like Yamato and the cute overload at first, but I'm warming up to it. I guess my delayed reaction made me last longer.</br>  <br>That justifies pretty much anything bad anyone has ever done in fiction.<br>She's gonna fail, so what. Doesn't make her less of a bitch.</br></br>  <br>10/10 would impregnate. <br><br>Is a pity she lost even before starting</br></br></br>  <br>"Attempted murder?" they don't give out awards for "attempted chemistry" do they?</br>  Reminder that Yamato's voice sound seiyuu from Inferno Cop doing falsetto.  <br>You can enjoy bad guys in fiction for any number of reasons. Because they are charismatic, interesting, because they move the plot in a way you enjoy. Doesn't matter how many orphanages they burn down.<br><br>Obviously she isn't a bad guy but I enjoy and respect her role in the story, that is being the underdog trying to steal away Takeo from Yamato.</br></br></br>  <br>rofl</br>  I find myself with three unwatched episodes on my hard drive. Well I guess the question of "does getting together early work" has been answered for me. I suppose there is a reason the whole "will they or won't day" dynamic is used in everything.<br><br>Granted it was still great at the start. Might have worked better as an OVA or something.</br></br>  I like how Yamato's friends are all two faced bitches yet she still hangs with them.<br><br>Yeah Saijou san is way superior, Perfect girlfriend material.</br></br>   Master I messed up again please spank me! <br> &gt;What? <br> It'll help me learn <br> &gt;OKAY!!! </br></br></br>  A CHALLENGER APPEARS<br><br>About time shit got stirred up.</br></br>  <br>Best girl always lost</br>  <br>she's not trying to steal Takeo, she knows that she won't win so she's just going to enjoy being around him</br>  I seriously don't get why people complain about the lack of tension and "will they or won't they" being boring. This shit's gotta be the most feel-good I've ever watched.  <br>While I agree with what you said<br> Commie <br> nice screenshot </br></br></br>  <br> cute as fuck <br> not a bitch towards Takeo <br>Shouldn't this make her breeding material for Suna? She's the only one besides Yamato and Suna's sister that doesn't treat Takeo like shit.</br></br></br>   /a/ admits Saijou is best girl <br>I guess good taste does exist <br>too bad she isn't even allowed to compete in the bowl</br></br>  <br>At least you are not using VLC.</br>  <br>She's absolutely best. Not even Nee-san comes close to Saijou.</br>  <br>I just started watching  tbh </br>  <br>Yamato &gt; Saijou</br>  I can't be the only one who thought they looked similar  <br>could she still win the Sanabowl?<br><br>i lost track of the manga once it got licensed</br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe they are just boys.<br><br><br>That's fucking adorable and in character with the show god damn it.<br><br>God damn it I hate this show it's fucking adorable.<br><br> noticing her bust <br> we're on the same wavelength... friends? <br> YOU CAN'T BE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BANG YOUR BF YAMATO GDI </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Suna wants the grade A Takeo dick<br><br>Threesome?</br></br>  <br> YOU CAN'T BE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BANG YOUR BF YAMATO GDI <br><br>I'm not so sure about that. Polyamorous relationships do exist, you know.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Yamato will share, even with Suna </br>  <br> implying the pure love that is Yamato and Takeo would give in the degeneracy that is open relationships <br><br>But really I'm a threesomefag, just quoting her friends. Her friends really went from shit tier in that one episode, to great tier since that time they thought she was getting the dick.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah her friends really came around after the singles meetup episode.</br>  <br>Are any of them going to get with Takeo's friends?<br>Actually, a better question would be is Sunakawa going to end up with someone?</br></br>  <br>Well they are shit in the sense that they are judgmental and kind of catty, but they try to support their friend and help her wherever they can. They are mostly just atypical teenage girls.</br>  This show is more boring than Golden time and Mahouka combined.  <br>Isn't the Afro guy dating one of them?</br>  When will Takeo NTR Yamato with best girl?<br><br> also, mfw this is slowly turning into a harem </br></br>  <br>I think more typical teenage girl response would be call her a slut and not cover for her.<br><br>Seeing them (wrongly) being hyped for her getting laid and being happy was nice and unexpected for me.<br><br>But yeah typical teenage girls being judgemental in places. I want Yamato and Big Tits I Haven't Learnt Her Name Yet to be friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. Where the mangafags at?</br>  Has the anime now overtaken the manga? The last translated chapter on Batoto is the relay.  I hate Jap porn hentai manga with big tits<br>But shojo with big tits is the greatest. Mariya a perfect bust.<br>Please explain this.</br></br>  <br>Only the scanlations.<br>Apparently the official English release is farther ahead.</br></br>  <br>The fact that his classmates didn't go all hyper-jealousy on Takeo when he told him he had girlfriend made it seem like everyone has some bro in them.</br>  <br><br>I don't understand manga scanlation anymore.<br><br>mangaupdates says someone called MangaLator did up to chapter 33 but I can't find a site for them or a link or anything.</br></br></br></br>  Curious, if anybody knows, how many eps is S1 getting? I have been expecting it to end for the last 3 eps but it keeps on going. Not to say I want it to end because I like this anime.  <br>24 episodes. So only 8 left</br>  <br>It's probably going to go until the end of this season, so 24 episodes I'd guess.<br><br>MAL says 24 too.</br></br></br>  <br>it's 2 cour, man. 24 eps</br>  <br><br><br>cheers!</br></br></br>  I need a gif of when Mariya first runs. 6:14-6:16~ish. For reasons.  bumping because i want to see  as well  <br>Those 3 people must have trained for centuries in order to be able to use a search engine, anon.<br><br>You better pay respect to those who can do such a great deed.</br></br></br>   Best girl will never ask you for a piggyback ride   So no one's gonna bring up the fact that Yamato was willing to smack a bitch for her man?  <br>What's so bad about that?</br>  <br>As opposed to being a doormat and letting someone take Takeo?</br>  <br><br>chill fambruhghinis, i just thought it would've been more talked about<br>personally, I thought it was hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>I think her definition of fight was "become a more attractive option" or "assert your exclusivity".</br>  takeo and yamato's conversations are so fucking bland now, this really should have been one cour.  <br>It's the reason everyone is hopping on the new girl bandwagon. Shiny new thing is better than used up old thing.</br>  <br>Nah it's still adorable.</br>  <br>Yeah, I still enjoy them because I don't expect much from the show. Every week I get a consistent feel good vibe and 20 minutes of smile time. Though Saijou did make things more interesting, in addition to being cute as fuck herself.<br><br>It would be neat to mix things up a bit further and introduce a character that doesn't like Takeo. The guy's great, but when they introduce him as someone who isn't very popular, with girls at least, then make him the raddest dude in school, it doesn't make much sense.</br></br></br>  <br>It's way better than two cours of will they or won't they nonsense.<br><br>First fight episode when?</br></br></br>  <br>Takeo will punch a dude from episode 13/14 (the one that liked Nee-chan) for making Nee-chan cry</br>  <br>Did he pull his punch? Getting hit full-strength by Takeo would probably feel like getting hit by a truck.</br>    <br><br>Yamato a shit</br></br>  <br>dayum</br>  Well, even though this anime is somewhat slow and predictable it's the only way to see what happens next in the story. Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't this episode the last translated chapter? <br>I haven't seen any manga spoilers and there doesn't seem to be a group dedicated to scanlating it so I gotta stick with the anime to see what happens next. <br> Even if no drama happens from this love triangle I'm still excited to see how the anime will end. </br></br>  I don't know how to feel about this.<br>On one hand, I was so happy for a change with a series that was a couple straight from the start, and was so happy and cute and the big guy was the cool good guy.<br>But now this happens and it makes me realize drama is still entertaining, meaning I have shit taste for liking the same old drama shit and couldn't just be happy with happiness.<br><br>Yamoto won't lose, but then again Takeo and Yamoto both acknowledged that its natural and more likely for couple to break up. Only in anime and such do high school sweet hearts end up together. <br>Yes it happens sometimes in real life, but even then its kind of stupid to settle down with the first person you ever love, and just shut your ears and go lalalalala to the rest of the world, and think when things go bad, its just how couples are and pull through it. But then again I firmly believe in what Jesus said that the only reason you should divorce if for immorality.</br></br></br></br></br>  DED THRED <br><br>DED SHOW</br></br>  <br>dat Takeo ass doe</br>  <br><br>Don't be so hard on yourself anon, nobody's perfect :3</br></br>   you won't ever have an overnight stay with your boyfriend or girlfriend   Take can't turn his swag off?  I'm scared.   big breast make you slow <br>See /a/, cow tits are useless and harmful.</br>    <br>Her chest looks swole rather than showing a big tit.inb4 she was running.</br>     my feet hurt <br> tfw no gf <br> Why am I here? <br> tfw no love triangle about me <br> I want to go home <br>Oh Suna.</br></br></br></br></br>  Saijou-sanXYamato when  <br><br>Happiness is totally fucking meaningless without drama. Happiness without drama is a fake happiness, and love without hardship is a fake love. <br><br>You should watch Nana instead.</br></br></br></br>  Aw fuck, I just want some lovey dovey stupid couple bullshit with some bros around. Please no harem   <br> You should watch Nana instead. <br>This guy, again.</br></br>  <br>Oh gosh, I just tried watching Nana, I had to drop it halfway through the 2nd episode, where it exposed the brown haired Nana to have been a total slut. There is drama and there is fucking shit that should be avoided. I'd take ore-monogatari anyday</br>  <br>I love this show, and im a big guy so i can relate to it. <br>the only thing i dont like is that sometimes the music sounds like low quality drama/soap.</br></br>  <br>Cow tits are gross, that is perfect large chest.</br>   tfw two of my friends became a couple <br> been thirdwheeling all the time <br>Suna knows my feels.<br><br>At least in Japan shoujos they are pure and don't make out in movie theaters fucking degenerates.</br></br></br></br>  <br> At least in Japan shoujos they are pure <br>Actually anon, shoujo is full of sluts. This series is an exception; but, usually, they'd have fucked already.</br></br>  <br>Eh, I meant to say that at least in Japan PDA is punishable by death. Not holding hands and cuddling in public.</br>  <br>That is one hell of a boob loaf right there. I feel sorry for her - don't the Japanese make nice bras above a size C or something?</br>  <br>Sports bras attempt to compress the utters away.</br>  <br>stupid sexy Takeo</br>  <br>Would Takeo top or bottom?</br>  Outside Umaru is undeniably the best girl.  I want the entire OP.  This show makes me want to kill my hamsters.  guys Umaru is supposed to be a terrible sister, it's part of the humor   TFW your waifu has a secret accent   Reminder that Ebina is a fat pig slut that would suck your dick for a couple of big-macs.  <br>I'm okay with that. $10 blowjob, can't turn down a sale son.</br>  <br>still better than lazy neet hamster</br>  Ebina is cute but Sylphy a best  <br>Incest doujin when?</br>  <br><br>This nigga gets it</br></br>  <br>when you draw it</br>  <br>Best girls shouldn't have cleft lips anon</br>  <br> Shit is like every onii-chan besides Taihei is bit autistic or retarded <br>dude every CHARACTER in this is autistic or retarded<br><br> Umaru <br>multiple personalities, can't confess anything to her friends, autistic at home<br> Ebina <br>literally retarded foodie, locks up when she sees Taihei and refuses to confess to him<br> Kirie <br>autistic, cannot socialize, completely locks up from desire when she sees Umaru, cannot recognize Umaru in Komaru form<br> Sylphin <br>gaijin who knows nothing about japan and goes around shouting at people when she's trying to make friends<br> Kanou <br>stalker, probably yand<br><br> Taihei <br>asexual workaholic with a clear mother complex who constantly spoils his sister despite her behavior<br> Kou <br>angry chef who left home to work and won't contact them, probably gay<br> Bomber <br>social retard without any sense of tact or reading the mood, also cannot recognize Umaru in Komaru form, cannot even recognize his own sister<br> Alex <br>the worst kind of weeb, is also probably the antagonist<br><br>I love Himouto but every single character in it has issues (which makes them a lot fun to read about than if they were "normal")</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the live like a year or something anyways so please don't do that.</br>  <br><br> refuses to confess to him <br><br>Still mad</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only a year?<br>gud lawd</br></br>  <br>I've long since moved past expecting real progress in manga like this.</br>  <br><br>I'm ok with this as long there is not shitty drama</br></br>  Where's he looking?  She's worse than Konata to me.  <br>Would it actually be a good idea for her to confess to her best friend's adult brother?</br>  <br><br>it's possible to have progress without drama or huge events, I mean over 100 chapter and lots of stuff has happened already you just don't realize it.</br></br>  <br>she is from akita, she should be married to a 30 year old by now.</br>  <br>It's more natural for the guy to make the first move really, she just needs to goad him more effectively, girl has no game plan</br>  <br><br>Is a miracle that she is not already raping him</br></br>  <br>It always makes me wonder why people can't just watch these shows without getting so hardassed about every single thing of every character.<br><br>I guess I just have high tolerance for every kind of character. Except for the truly evil ones, fuck them.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't view her as a woman at all though. Manager on the other hand....</br>   burger <br> 300 calories <br>I guess in japan burgers are smaller.</br></br>  <br>what are you replying to?</br>  Smug Umaru is best Umaru  <br><br>Ebina being a fatty</br></br>  Maybe it's the voice work but I actually like Umaru even when she's being a complete bitch.  <br>I fucked up my image.</br>  <br>diet arc soon</br>  <br><br>Dogakobo really know their semen demons</br></br>  <br>Yah, even I want to rape Taihei</br>  <br>i think satisfied umaru is best umaru</br>    <br>second</br>  Would you watch anime with Umaru if she picked out snacks for both of you?  <br>no because she's got shit taste in anime and food</br>  <br>All the food going to dem tits. I would cook for her.</br>  <br><br>Komaru &gt; Umaru</br></br>  <br><br>Ebina would suck your dick if you become her onii-san for a while</br></br>  <br>~da be.</br>  <br>nanmo shinpai ne~</br>  <br> people don't realize he gets a full serving of Umaru's breasts almost daily </br>  <br>I bet that accent will be completely open and exposed during sex with Oniisan, screaming all sorts of gosh darn words.<br><br>All he has to do is go downstairs and she is waiting for his benis.</br></br></br>  <br>country girls are the best</br>  <br>Could you imagine how hot she'd get for you if you made her some gourmet savory dishes and sweets? Hand feeding her would be orgasmic.</br>  <br>I've always wondered what foodplay would be like.</br>  Holy shit waking him up on Sunday for no reason when he slaves away at work to provide for both of them. Fucking bitch. Worst girl. Fuck I'm mad.  I like her but she's portrayed frowning all the time, I want to see a smile on that cute face more often.  <br>I'm pretty sure their parents are still alive and probably sending money for Umaru's living expenses.</br>  <br>I'm a work slave too, but I think it's nice to have a sister to spice up things.</br>  <br>She can't help spilling spaghetti when oniisan is around</br>  <br>Doesn't make it less of a cunt thing to do.</br>  I wish this series diverted from the manga and she winds up losing everything, her image, her friends, her health, and then her onichan.<br><br>I wish she experiences the worst suffering.</br></br>    <br><br>Imagine coming home from work and then having to take care of a toddler. That's umaru.</br></br>  Why do some anons hate Umaru so much? Are you guys poor? Do you have real little sisters?  <br>Gotta admit, she's really cute.</br>  <br>Wait, the official subs uses onii-chan? That's so fucking stupid, I don't care about goddamn nip phrases, that's why I'm watching subs. I don't play your fucking secret handshake bullshit of tsundawas and moemoes and onnichawks. Fuck.</br>  <br>I have a real little sister, and I love Umaru. Kirie best though.</br>  <br>She's a brat that hides her true self from others and causes only problems for her brother.</br>  <br>And yet every normalfag does it and still loves their kid.</br>  <br>I have real one, nothing as shitty as umaru though.</br>  I hope fatalpulse picked this up   Drinking Cola early in the fucking morning <br>What the fuck.</br>  <br> I bet that accent will be completely open and exposed during sex with Oniisan, screaming all sorts of gosh darn words. </br>  <br>I don't hate her. She'e really annoying, but her being a nuiscane it's what really drives the show, so I'm okay with that. <br>Thankfully my sis isn't like that, mainly because we don't get along.</br></br>  <br><br>Except those are actual toddlers not some grown ass bitch leeching off of you.</br></br>  <br> grown ass bitch <br>She's in high school, m8.</br></br>  <br>She's a teenager, not a grown ass bitch. Teenagers are still pretty commonly leeches.</br>  At least we agree Umaru is the bitch of the season.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I agree she's the one that triggers a few autists the most.</br>  <br>More like she's a teenager, not a 4 year old kid.</br>  <br>100% sure</br>  She hungers for the onii-san shroom.  <br>What makes are so cute? I can't put my thumb on it.</br>  <br>Only sluts wear capes.</br>  <br>Her bitchiness is almost entirely the fault of her brother. He deserves all the pain.</br>  <br>How come</br>  <br>This. You're not supposed to spoil wild imoutos so much. Do you complain when animals come to you for food after you routinely feed them?</br>  What did Ebina mean by, oh gosh I did that with onii-san, in the episode preview?  <br><br> victim blaming </br></br>  <br>She shlicked to oniisan</br>  <br>Sorry tumblr.</br>  <br><br>He just cannot stop spoiling her and stand his ground. He's too soft on her.</br></br>  <br>I want to bully her with muh dick.</br>  <br> mad at onii-chan in the subs <br>Yeah, because it would be so much better to translate is as "brother" or better yet his name, because you clearly hear her not say his name.<br><br>Tell me which one is the least shitty translation<br> Onii-san is very kind afterall. <br> Brother is very kind afterall. <br> Taihei is very kind afterall. (we hear "Onii-san yappari yasashi") </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Does she even count as loli?</br></br>  <br><br>Makes for good entertainment, though.</br></br>  <br>no she is 16</br>  <br>When it's cold, even carburated beverages are very refreshing in the morning.</br>  <br>1. She's underage<br>2. Umaru would find out<br>3. This would fuck up all the progress Umaru has made in terms of personality, and would likely end up with Taihei in jail.<br><br>Same reason Kirie and TSF haven't scissored Umaru yet, basically. Fear of social stigmatization is an evolutionary trait.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can girls be NTR'd?  No. Women are generally attracted to men who have many partners whereas the opposite is generally true for men.  <br><br>Is that true?<br><br>So, It is impossible to cheat on a woman?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're on /a/, what do you know about women?<br><br>Your mom doesn't count.</br></br></br>  <br>I need sauce on this so I can answer your question, anon.</br>  <br> So, It is impossible to cheat on a woman? <br>Depends. If you are alpha enough then you can even have a modern harem unofficialy.</br></br>  <br>Or being rich.</br>  <br>source?</br>  <br>Being rich alone is not enough. You are still going to get cucked in secret.</br>  Is that the trap giving him head?  <br>Abso-fucking-lutely.</br>  No, they can only be haremified.  <br>If you're a Muslim, you can have a harem officially :^)</br>  <br> this thread <br><br>Sasuga /a/</br></br></br>  <br> No. Women are generally attracted to men who have many partners <br>yeah, but that's only so they can monopolize that male and his rescues. <br>no use getting pregnant and having no provider.</br></br></br>  ITT: Morons who think they're funny and try to fit in.  ITT, no spoonfeeding.  <br>In the OP pic it's the rei clone.</br>  <br>But why would you want to eat a spoon in the first place?</br>  yep anyone can experience the joy of watching your love fucking someone else  <br>Yes? That's conventionally what most NTR is. And you can stop making these repeat NTR threads; people had already hated it enough so there's no need to play the agent provocateur.</br>  <br>please i want my gay ntr</br>  <br> no use getting pregnant and having no provider. <br>And that's where the role of the beta provider comes in.</br></br>  <br>that's a boy?</br>  <br>Yep, 100% a boy.</br>  ITT: Muh Fetish, NTR Sucks, Vanilla Fags Butt hurt... ect  <br>You're that same person who posts this same response in this thread every time aren't you</br>  <br>Where is he from god dammit.</br>  Yes, but it's not the same thing. Both women and men get jealous, but for different reasons. For a woman the worst is seeing her man having romantic feelings for another woman, while for man the worst is seeing her woman being fucked by another man. There're women who wouldn't care that much if they found out his partner hired hooker or had a one night stand, but she'll be destroyed if he's  holding hands  with another woman.  <br>It still depends on the woman but I accept this as correct answer.</br>  <br><br>Boku No Adam</br></br>  <br>Any good NTR doujins?</br>  <br>Source?

I remember an eromanga that started out as yuri lesbian stuff, then one of the girl discovers her girlfriend in the middle of the park fucking multiple men.  <br>This is actually very true. I've read tons of studies that support this. Of course there are exceptions but majority of women are like this.<br><br>A piece of advice though, never tell a girl you haven't had a girlfriend or haven't had your first kiss yet. If they know no women want you then and it will create subconscious wall that will stop them from falling for you. Always make it out to be that you have had plenty of girlfriends before. And make it seem like there are women who currently want to get into a relationship with you or straight out lie you have a girlfriend. It will make more girls want you if they think other women want you.<br><br>Saying your a virgin is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any links, keywords, or authors, titles to the research?

Does it really upset your vagina that much that women do what other women do? Anyone who spent five minutes with a woman knows that.</br>  <br>Yeah, the unfortunate truth is the amount of game-theory that goes into relationships these days, particularly when your main communication is over text of some kind, is ridiculous.<br>That said, a genuine connection will generally overpower whatever social-games are being played.</br></br>    <br> Anyone who spent five minutes with a woman knows that. <br>So then why are you acting like you know what you're talking about?</br></br>  <br> stay virgins <br> thinks its a legitimately good idea to lie to the person you want a legitimate relationship with the first time you meet them <br><br>You're a virgin aren't you?<br><br>Because only virgins have this retarded thought process of you need to make yourself look like a manwhore to attract women<br><br>You couldn't look like a manwhore even if you tried <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Depends. If you are alpha enough then you can even have a modern harem unofficialy. <br><br>When I was a child, I used to think this was fantasy. Until I started meeting a ton of people that had mistresses, and their wives were cool about it. In all, I think I've met about 32 people in real life, that had wives and a mistress. More if you count people that knew someone like this or possibly a friend of a friend. I'm not even a normalfag either, it's just more prevalent than you think.</br></br></br>  <br> Now there's nothing I can do to stop you from sitting in your moms basement being a virgin forever. <br>So upset she ends up making shit up.</br></br>  <br>Raw? Fan art? I'm up to date on the scans...</br>  <br>Source of pic? Google gave me nothing.</br>  <br>Throwing insults won't change anything.<br>Your a girl aren't you?

Its not like this is some underground knowledge, a lot of people already know.</br></br>  <br>Do you think I've never been with a woman because I watch anime? This is getting embarrassing.

Virginity is used as insult by women because it implies no woman would ever want you. Just what that anon earlier said.</br>  <br> Stating facts equals hating women <br>heheheh</br></br>  <br>How long you going to use the /r9k/ meme as a way to deflect the actual posts? You're coming off as very insecure here. Which I guess is to be expected given the gender.</br>  <br>I don't even go to /r9k/. This is sad. I'm done discussing this with you. I'm sorry you can't except simple facts about your kind, but like I said, the research is there. Look it up if you ever cool down.<br><br>Have a nice day miss. Im out</br></br></br>  <br>You've stated no facts. You've regurgitated things you heard on /r9k/ while shouting "MUH STUDIES" over and over to try and make them look valid without actually posting any of these alleged studies, and will now undoubtedly try to say "i'm not doing your work for you" instead of actually posting them because you don't have any but don't want to admit it.</br>  <br> Can girls be NTR'd? <br><br>You should ask childhood friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Somewhat true. After having sex, pheromones linger on a man which makes him attractive to other women, so having more sex could potentially make him more desirable, unknowingly, to other women.<br><br><br>Childhood friends always understand that they will never win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you based anon</br>  <br> I'm going to ignore the absolutely tremendous amount of cultural history that has lead to the word virgin being an insult. <br><br>I mean literally everything in this thread is so armchair that it's not even worth addressing. I especially liked the guy asking for someone to link their peer reviewed journals and studies and getting nothing. Because you know, they don't exist.</br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br>Keep playing the academic as means of rejecting common sense for anyone who has dated women. Not /a/'s fault women act like women.</br></br></br>  <br>I am not a virgin but what use is stating that to a woman over the internet? The only reply you can expect is "lol u lyin u litle dik virgin :)" or some similarly inane stupidity.<br><br><br>Have you ever talked to women? Known women? They love "playboys" and disdain virgins almost unanimously. Men obviously feel differently.</br></br></br></br>    <br> You've regurgitated things you heard on /r9k/ while shouting "MUH STUDIES" <br> mfw all this butthurt and victim complex <br> mfw I am not even the same poster who said about the studies <br>The funniest thing of all is that all of this comes from actual real life experience from women just like yourself. <br>I've found that the most vocal ones who are trying to disprove all of this are the very women who are the worst offenders of that behavior.<br><br>But please, do tell me more. Say how I am a permavirgin from /r9k/ and that I am somehow wrong because it hurts your feelings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> those <br> credible academic sources <br> even the one that could MAYBE slip, basically in the article admits that they don't have a clue, they're just drawing a conclusion for the sake of articles. </br></br></br>  <br> I am not a virgin <br>Get out. Only Wizards and Apprentice in Wizardhood allowed here.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is literally the gayest thing I've read today</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Wait, he has fucked him in the LN then?</br></br></br>  <br>culture isn't made on accident, you fucking Redditor. Culture is an expression of our nature through civilization. It being culturally derived does not discredit its biological meaning. On the contrary actually. Virginity being used as insult is the same as weirdo being used as insult. We shun and mock people who can't live up to our ideals, in this case being men being unattractive to other women.</br>  <br>I need source on this. Might be NTR but it looks sweet.</br>  <br>It's funny because her entire argument based on the fact that women don't find virgins repulsive, while actually using virgin as a way to insult people ITT. Talk about self-fulfilling prophecy.</br>  This thread has nothing to do with /a/ anymore. I don't care if you're a female or a virgin, take your internet debate somewhere else faggots.  <br><br>Except there are plenty of Christmas cakes out there who enjoy breaking in new territory, so your theory is wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>He's fucked literally everyone, mang<br><br>Fuck he even got the trap to taste pussy in exchange for cumming in his butt</br></br></br></br>  <br> but it looks sweet <br><br>Well she does get some in the end.</br></br></br>  <br>Right, yes you're almost certainly correct in that there's an element of biology as a starting point thousands of years ago, but if you think you have ANY chance of even beginning to understand it and draw a meaningful conclusion, you're so arrogant that you're not worth talking to because you clearly have no grasp of your own limitations. Unless of course you happen to be an expert in this very narrow field.</br>  <br>I don't understand why more women don't prefer virgins. They're easier to manipulate in bed due to their inexperience. Why are females so inherently submissive?</br>  <br>Did he fuck Enju in her pussy or only her ass like in the manga?</br>  <br>But anon he also fucked a lot of girls<br><br>a whole fucking lot</br></br></br>  <br>Culture is a thing.

The field of common fucking sense? Again, sources have been posted. Anyone who's been with a woman knows this. The only ones denying it are the same as those guilty of it, which is understandable. Keep playing the academic card. I'm sure it works fine when you're with your girl friends out and the subject pops up. But on 4chan, that mask won't hide your blatant bias.</br>  <br><br>We talking about the twintails?<br><br>Because holy shit does she get plowed super hard</br></br></br></br>  <br>I knew it, thanks anon.</br>  <br>But seriously, I'm into bondage and almost every girl is a fucking sub. It's such bullshit.</br>  he still didnt fucked his sister  <br>Nobody gives a fuck<br/></br>  <br> Culture is a thing <br>Tumblr please. This is a cross-culture phenomenon. Just as many other social traits inherited through genetics. A person using culture as an excuse to disregard social behavior lacks understanding on the subject of genetics.</br></br>  <br>Is Enju shaping out to be his main girl like I thought she'd be?</br>  <br>Common sense has nothing to do with the evolution of language, culture and human mentality over the centuries, or anything in this dicussion. You're the one with an obvious bias. I'm simply saying "none of us have anything worth saying in this topic because none of us know the first fucking thing about anything."<br><br>Stop trying to fall back on the argument which basically is just "this is normative for me"</br></br></br>  <br>LN has this as images right?</br>  <br> You're the one with an obvious bias <br>Says the girl who called people virgins because they said virgins were socially shunned.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You know what I think all of your problems are?<br><br>You're completely obsessed with sex (probably from a lack of getting it, but that's another issue. And now that i've said it you're all probably going to completely ignore everything else in my post, but whatever, I don't really expect productive discussion from you in the first place)<br><br>You're so obsessed with sex you project your obsession onto the rest of the world, and thus assume the only kind of feelings anyone else has are also exclusively about sex. Hell your obsession with sex is so severe that from the beginning of the argument you haven't even been thinking of what NTR actually is. You've brought up all your "studies and experience" and all they've been about was in relation to the hook-up culture of bars and clubs. NTR doesn't mean some stranger you just met at a bar fucks another random stranger instead of you. NTR is when you're supposed to be in a committed relationship with someone but they fuck someone else. <br><br>Basically, if you weren't so obsessed with sex you would realize that the kinds of douchebags and bitches who hang out and bars and clubs every night constantly looking for 1-night stands aren't the only kind of "normalfag" in the world. The majority of normal people don't do that, and spend most of their romantic lives in regular monogamous relationships. And neither men nor women like seeing the person they're supposed to be monogamous with cheat on them (besides people with an NTR fetish of course)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much yeah<br><br>She's basically claimed 'first wife' position and keeps having to defend it from all sides<br><br><br><br>Yup<br><br>Also a threeway with her, witchgirl and angel in the bath</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your post never makes an argument to why everyone isn't obsessed with sex.</br>  I'm just picturing fat ass neckbeards and legbeards arguing with each other behind their monitors. This thread is hilarious. Never change, /a/.  <br>What cultures are you looking at? how many of them have a major history of patriarchy? how many of these have been incredibly heavily influenced in the last 100 years by nations which could be called Christian and patriarchal?<br><br>History doesn't happen in a vacuum. It's so meaningless to try and simply draw conclusions from simple things, and it's so tempting to do, I understand, you see two things and they look like they should be related. But that's overly simplistic and it ignores a lot of things, it's the kind of thing that historians get mad about.</br></br></br>  <br>You realize everyone is born a virgin right?<br><br>You were socially shunned long before virginity became a factor in peoples minds.</br></br></br>    <br>I can't tell who's baiting who anymore, just that everyone involved is a dumbass.</br>  <br>Why do you assume that I'm someone else? I made two posts in this thread. Both of them were basically saying "everything you're saying is worthless, because you're an armchair"</br>  <br>I KNOW LOL</br>    <br> TL;DR you are virgins because you hurt my feelings and I am going to repeat the exact same insult over and over again cause it will make me feel right <br>el oh el</br></br>  <br>except those are movies and doujins and not reality.</br>  <br>No, I would have dicked him till my penis fell off</br>  <br>Please continue.</br>  <br> how many of them have a major history of patriarchy <br>Here we go again. This bullshit excuse to discredit societal norms again. I'm not going to engage in a tumblr-tier conversation. I get enough of that outside of 4chan.</br></br>  <br>I very clearly said the majority of "normalfags" aren't constantly out looking for 1-night stands like you assume they are. If you keep focusing on nothing but those lowest common denominators then you're going to keep thinking they're the only kind of people in the world. <br><br>But you'll never stop focusing on those kinds of people because they're the ones having lots of sex, and you're obsessed with sex so you'll keep focusing exclusively on them, and that will make you keep thinking the entire world is like them.</br></br></br>  Yes, the girl that does it is called a cuckcake    <br>muh patriarchy<br><br>muh gender studies classes</br></br></br>  <br> "women don't prefer non-virgins over virgins, youre just ignorant" <br> proceeds to call everyone in the thread a virgin as an insult <br><br>You are living proof of the claim and you don't even realize it</br></br></br></br>  <br> this factor that is a major contributing factor to the social normativity is an excuse to discredit them <br><br>I just asked you if this was true, would you disagree? (I hope not because it would make you an idiot) You have a position that you believe and want to defend. I haven't even challenged what I'll call the core position, I've just challenged the reason you think that is the case and you're eager to discredit any attempt I make to simply question it. You aren't arguing with facts and reason, you're arguing in "I don't want to talk about this" which emphasises just how unqualified ANYONE here is to have this discussion, so we should all just fucking STOP.</br></br></br>  <br>There's futa too?</br>  <br>Is this still on X?</br>  <br> Basically, if you weren't so obsessed with sex you would realize that the kinds of douchebags and bitches who hang out and bars and clubs every night constantly looking for 1-night stands aren't the only kind of "normalfag" in the world. The majority of normal people don't do that, and spend most of their romantic lives in regular monogamous relationships. And neither men nor women like seeing the person they're supposed to be monogamous with cheat on them (besides people with an NTR fetish of course) <br>Then why is cheating at an all time high now?</br></br>  <br>But normalfags are still constantly looking for sex, whether through monogamous relationships or one-night-stands. It's a desire as universal as eating and shitting.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  "Egalitarianism" is an MRA project<br><br>Feminism is a human project</br></br>  <br> but that's another issue. And now that i've said it you're all probably going to completely ignore everything else in my post <br> You are living proof of the claim and you don't even realize it <br><br>Is this some kind of next level ironic baiting?</br></br></br></br>  <br>God fucking damn it.</br>  <br>I don't know, you don't know, no body fucking knows for sure, lots of people who are qualified to argue about this probably are doing so. None of them are in this thread.</br>  <br>Just because you called your own contradiction before someone else did doesn't discredit the contradiction.</br>  <br>It got purged along with alot of hisasi's works.</br>    <br>Tits or fuck off.</br>  <br>The notion that patriarchy of societies not being tied to genetics is false. Men exhibit a great many features desireable for leaders than women. There are clear genetical differences between man and woman in behavior.<br><br>All this has since long been established in the realm of actual science, and not some bullshit gender studies lie you keep repeating.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still on porn nyaa.</br>  Women really got BTFO in this thread. God damn.  <br>Strangely enough I think you can find it on the regular version of the site.</br>  <br>What contradiction? I don't recall anyone besides you bringing up whether women prefer virgins or non-virgins. This question of this thread is if women can be NTR'd. <br><br>People like you claimed they can't because they prefer non-virgins. Then I pointed out that you people are obsessed with sex because you can't understand the difference between hooks-ups/1 nights stands, and actual relationships. And NTR of course, involving relationships, not hookups<br><br><br>Saying that about your own posts doesn't make them true bro.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes thats how adult life works, now go to sleep</br>  <br>Actual relationships also revolve around sex. On what fucking planet do you live on?</br>  <br>I never disagreed, in fact I outright said that biology provided the foundation a very long time ago.<br><br>What differences can we tell are purely genetic? we have genetic data from a very VERY narrow gap of time. Long after many cultures had formed, it's pretty much impossible to determine what is and isn't genetic with out limited understanding of the fields of Intelligence (which we know fuck all about) the human body (which we're still discovering new fundamental things about) the brain (no need to even comment here). So even ignoring just how corrupt our data is going to be inherently, we have such limited understanding (it's growing all the time I'll give you that) of ourselves, what makes you think we can draw an accurate conclusion?</br></br></br>  <br>Sex with each other, not other random people.</br>  <br>You apparently haven't noticed the rise of female teachers getting arrested for fooling around with 14-15 year old boys.</br>  <br>I don't know what the fuck you're on about now, but this whole thing started because you got indignant when told that you and women like you are instinctively attracted to mansluts. And your response was to criticise, repeatedly, everyone for being a virgin, like being a virgin was a trait that you as a woman found undesirable.<br><br> Because only virgins have this retarded thought process <br><br>You are arguing entirely from emotion rather than reason because you can't accept the fact that you, like all human beings are programmed pieces of garbage.<br><br>And if I'm an "armchair psychologist" as someone with a degree in psychology, which is the other thing you like to throw around, you're an armchair sociologist and feminist, so shut the fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The world runs on sex, seriously.<br><br>Look at big of a deal it was when people who love fucking the same gender got the freedom to get married.</br></br></br>  <br> 15 year old boys can only be inexperienced virgins <br>You apparently haven't noticed the decreasing age of first sexual encounters</br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Sex all the same. You're making it seem normalfags aren't crazy about sex, which is wrong.</br>  <br> Check out volume 7 <br> MC takes it in the ass from the trap <br><br>I'm sure if I should continue</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do it you wimp</br></br>  <br>What else happens in 7?</br>  <br>anyone can claim to have a degree, and lets be honest, this is 4chan, even if you do have it (which I'll admit is entirely possible and I'll assume you do) you know as well as I do that there's not enough time in a thread to even write down the preamble required for anything you would write to have any genuine meaning and context.<br><br>I don't know who you are, what your background is, I don't know what your thesis was, many people in this thread probably don't even know the differences between norms, normality and normativity so to properly explain your argument properly you'd have to explain a huge lexicon.<br><br>And if you're an expert who will genuinely try and condense these incredibly debated topics into something you can say in a short post on 4chan, then I'll have to stop taking you seriously or at the very least question your bias.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>When a girl is stolen from her partner, then she's NTRed, you fucking retard.</br>  <br>I realized this would be the next logical step in your mental gymnastics. First you demanded studies, and when given, is now denying the validity of science. I suspected from the start this is where the conversation would head.

Bonus points if the girlfriend tried to make him hard in the first place.</br></br>  <br>And that has nothing to do with why h-manga is disproportionate in roles. Somebody has to make it and somebody has to have a reason to want to make it, and guess what? Nobody in Japan wants to masturbate to girls getting cucked. Not because they think NTR being any other way is so incomprehensible that they couldn't even produce fiction that supposes such a thing.</br>  <br>We really need more stuff like this.</br>  <br>New girl gives guy paizuri which he winds up loving to the point of not being able to get off to anything else and old girl is flat-chested.</br>  <br>Shit just got real.</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Calling bullshit especially if its paired with femdom.</br>  <br>Well japan is fucking plebs. The amount of rape and bondage shit proves they like watching girls suffer, but they're so short sighted they only think of the physical suffering.

I made it up as an example, you didn't need to take it as a personal insult and hostiley retaliate. <br><br>Why is your kind always so angry and confrontational.</br></br></br>  <br>  implying majority of ntr artists isnt female which explains the lack of male ntr <br>Only a woman could come up with something like Hime Kishi Tame.</br></br>  <br><br>Yep.

I wasnt trying to shit on cow tits or anything, and then I noticed I replied to a cowtits post.</br>  <br>well it still makes no sense since all girls have thighs</br>  <br>All girls have vaginas too, are you also saying they feel all the same?</br>  <br>He's just a retarded sensitive butthurt pedophile who likes skeleton chests.</br>  <br>Its true though.

The time seems better spent marathoning something that's finished airing.</br>  Always different.<br><br>Generally depends on my mood/enjoyment.

Fuck. <br><br> But I digress. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't need to get all autistic about it anon. Truth is people didn't need the sweater or the bag or whatever.

And lewds.</br>  One of the big anime changes is Miki being there from the start. <br>If she was there since the infection began, that means she was around with Megu-nee.<br>This would greatly change the dynamic when they find out about the basement.<br>One of the reasons Miki could clean up is because she wasn't around at the start.<br><br>Or if she was previously rescued before the start of the anime, then that means they've already gone on a field trip which removes tension there.<br><br>Predicting a big change between anime and manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry. The manga does a good job keeping those things in the middle of danger and death.</br>  <br>Or, you know, flashbacks.</br>  <br>Kurumi needs her now that Yuki is full-time babysitting Rii-san.</br>  <br>It's literally going to be the same thing except Miki is here from the beginning, so some scenes might be slightly altered. That's it. The course of events will stay roughly the same.<br><br>Case in point, today's episode is going to be chapter 2 and 3, except it has Miki and Taroumaru.</br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi needs no one.<br><br>I bet the author is setting Miki up so she has to be the one that kills Kurumi.</br></br></br>  How long until Rii completely loses it over her not-sister?<br><br>The girls at the university will start asking her questions about Ruu and shit will hit the fan.</br></br>  <br>What? She's slowly losing it and can't be trusted on her own. If not for Miki Kurumi'd be full zombie.</br>  <br> Kurumi was keeping the gun around as a quick way to suicide before she turned into a zombie <br> Miki threw it away <br><br>She brought the fate upon herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My problem with anime Mii-kun is that I can't understand her stoic character without her hellish routine at the store and I'm sure that part would be skipped.</br>  <br>She will not lose it anon, I'm here for her.<br><br>And the Uni girls will probably cause drama in other ways anyway.</br></br></br>  Quick, who is best girl?  <br><br>Why does Yuki wear a different uniform?<br>Why doesn't Miki wear a different uniform, considering she's not even from that school?<br><br><br>Kurumi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Taroumaru</br>  <br>Everyone.<br><br>But I like Rii the most.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She has the best body but the craziest personality.</br></br>  <br>Miki wears the same uniform because she is from the same school.

Rused again!".<br>I just feel that later on the presence of the extra characters is going to play a part in changing things up enough that the anime will stand slightly apart from the manga.</br></br>  <br>Aren't Cathat and Shovel in the same grade? Why is Yuki's uniform blue?<br><br><br>She has the best crazy eyes</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who knows, I have a feeling she's going to snap. The university girls are going to question why she's talking to a teddy bear and everything will go downhill from there.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Yuki in a grade above?</br>  <br>level-headed Yuki &gt; everyone else</br>  <br>Why does Yuki wear a different uniform?<br><br>Who knows but what I noticed is that only girls within her delusion wear the blue uniform like her classmates or the gardening club, real girls wear the green uniform like Kurumi, Yuuri or even zombie girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Uni girls drama is going to be about the bikers and whatever the reason was for the university to be marked on the map.<br><br>If anything, Rii's delusions will cause trouble in a dangerous situation and she will be forced to wake up, but I doubt it's going to be because of the Uni girls pressuring her.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't know, the best theory is that they're from different departments (like humanities/sciences).<br><br><br>No, they wear the same color ribbon. The ribbon signifies what year they're in.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uni girls drama is going to be about the bikers and whatever the reason was for the university to be marked on the map. <br>Shit, this sounds way too much like that Walking Dead game.<br><br>It was a shitty plot; I hope GG doesn't go that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mii-kun of course.</br>  <br><br>Why are people suspicious of the uni girls? The title of the manga is School Life, so they need a school to live in.</br></br>  Shovel is basically the loli version of this motherfucker with a shovel instead of a crossbow.  <br>Oh. I didn't notice the ribbons had different colors.</br>  Why do their uniforms have gommie stars on them and gommie green colors  <br>It's a manga about zombies; you always have to be suspicious of every single character. Always.<br><br>I just hope they don't use the old cliché of "oh boy, they're actually eating humans!"</br></br></br>  <br>must be gommunistis.</br>  Is this good? I flipped through the manga and it looks pretty gruesome, but the opening of the show looks very cookie cutter cute-girls-doing-cute-things. Is the apocalypse thing just a gimmick?  <br>There's a scene where  just fucking read it. </br>  <br>The anime makes it seem like a gimmick but the manga is simply a zombie story with a psycho character. There's little to no zombie-slashing and more down-time moments than in usual zombie stuff, but other than that I don't think there's a gimmick unless being in Kirara and having cute designs counts as a gimmick</br>  <br> the opening of the show looks very cookie cutter cute-girls-doing-cute-things <br><br>Keikaku doori</br></br></br>  Yuki is best girl and greatest hero.  <br> with two psycho characters <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>sorry can I get a translators note</br>  <br>Talking about eating humans.

They are still flesh and they make sounds.<br><br>Why don't zombies rot until they can't move anymore?<br><br>The zombie apocalypse shouldn't last more than a couple of weeks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In that case it isn't bad at all!</br></br>  muhdik  <br> &gt;refuses to simply survive in a room, holding out, because that's not living <br> &gt;leaves <br> &gt;dies probably immediately <br><br> In most stories you'd call that edgy, but her entire story was actually rather subtle. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They want living flesh</br>  <br>Zombies saying ''Brrrrraaiiiiiinnnnn''</br>  <br>Realistically, yes, it should end in a few weeks thanks to the fucking sun.<br><br>But that would defeat the purpose of every zombie story ever, so fuck logic. Also, they don't eat each other because zombies eat LIVING flesh. Why? Because that's what zombies eat; you don't question why vampires drink blood, they just do.</br></br></br>  <br>When do Miki and Shovel fug?</br>  <br>Nigga think about it it's fucking hard to survive like that, Mii-kun almost gave up too.</br>  <br>Literally perfect.</br>  <br> I'd rather die free than live imprisoned <br><br>It's not really an uncommon statement. It's been done all over the place.</br></br></br>  <br>And the buttons near the mustache are the bear's eyes</br>  <br>Miki might have her poker face on, but I can tell she's thinking about marrying Kurumi.</br>  <br>Ever hear of the cordyceps fungus? Nasty little thing. It changes the behavior of insects to do its bidding. The host cares not for anything but to let the fungus propagate and infest its friends and family. In this case, the virus might be manipulating the zombies in some effect to allow it to spread.</br>  <br>Living in a single spot is insanely stressful and it really isn't living. It's not edgy, it's realistic.</br>  <br>1st episode is enough to judge</br>  Do you think it would be possible to teach zombies to protest about how they're oppressed and discriminated upon for having a taste for raw, yummy live flesh and uh- being dead?  <br>And there's the fact that even the Angolan Military could handle a couple of corpses moving around at a snails pace, meaning realistically as soon as the military or cops got on the situation, zombies would be fucked</br>  <br>They probably wanted to show the whole main characters from the start. We might get a flashback of how they find Mi-kun</br>  <br>Doesn't stop hikkis!</br>  <br> teach zombies <br>This is where you fail</br></br>  <br> the day before Kurumi turns into a zombie they hold a wedding </br>  <br>Don't teach them stuff like that. The're bad enough as they already are.</br>  <br>Hikis don't just sit in a room doing nothing though.</br>  <br>I wonder if they'll ever bother explaining how the zombies even appeared. It's odd how the entire school got zombie'd, but not the girls who were on the roof. What was/wasn't in the roof that made her avoid the...virus? Toxin? Gas?<br><br>It's just odd. The whole city is a zombie. There MUST be a really common way of spreading this zombiefication. I won't believe it spreaded by nothing but zombies bitting people.</br></br></br>  <br>Would zombie rats do? All mammals are susceptible.</br>  <br>No Anon, it was  the bears </br>  <br><br>If only mammals are susceptible why don't they train reptiles to kill zombies?</br></br>  <br>Is this the Black Plague again?</br>  <br>If she was a student at their school, then she must have know Megu-nee from before since she was a teacher.</br>  Is Megu-nee anyone's favorite character?  Forget about bites. Zombies throwing their own fluids when?  <br>God damn it Anon, we can't just breed Raptors</br>  <br> a group of trained alligators sent in towns to kill zombies <br>Holy fuck do I want to see this for some reason.</br></br>  When Randall turns all the zombies back into normal people with their cure all serum, how long will Kurumi go to jail for? Death penalty, maybe?  <br>You can never trust bears.</br>  <br>Hard to make her my favorite character when she hasn't been in any chapter since forever.</br>  <br>They don't have much of an option for partners</br>  <br> I'm not a big fan of zombies. </br>  <br>Zombie contrivance 1: they want to bite/attack living flesh humans just because. Many of them probably don't have stomachs or teeth/jaws but they still "eat"<br><br>Zombie contrivance 2: they're rotted but they somehow never rot all the way through into dust.<br><br>Zombie contrivance 3: they don't need to feed yet have unlimited energy to continue moving.<br><br>And lastly, there's probably no way an outbreak would bring about the apocalypse. Shaun of the Dead is pretty close- the entire situation would be resolved in a short amount of time with relatively minimal losses. Some zombie fiction makes it so the zombies starve but really, none of it makes sense. You are really, really not supposed to think about it. I never understood why people complain about this setting. Yes, it's bullshit: do you want a prize for your discovery? Yeesh.<br><br>Also this is actually a real thing that happens  but not much fiction uses it since the fungus doesn't really possess you into generic zombie behavior. Last of Us used it, I think. Freaky shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Quick, someone post Ruu so we can all take a careful look at her design.  <br>but anon, the law don't apply to zombies. They can't judge her.</br>  <br>Language in Megu-nee's file implies it was a kind of leak, not necessarily an "outbreak" or something. They were prepared for a leak, and had serums for it and everything. At the labs or whatever where this...whatever it is was concocted, it's probably very dangerous. It probably does not only spread via bites, but also liquid injections or if you swallow it or something.</br>  <br>Wasn't there some kind of shitty movie that used that to make mass suicides?</br>  <br>They were just sick humans. Japan doesn't have the same self defense laws the US has, she has been committing murder.</br>  <br>Zombies natural enemy seems to be stairs.<br><br>Maybe at the start people got infected without immediately turning into a zombie, you know, like Kurumi.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. Kinda sounds like The Happening, but I never watched that.</br>  <br> Zombie contrivance 2: they're rotted but they somehow never rot all the way through into dust. <br>Forget dust. Bugs, rats and birds would get rid of them before that could happen.</br></br>  Zombie Girls 4koma spin-off when?  <br>The only reason they didn't get zombied is because they had a door to hide behind.<br>The initial source is still unknown, but the school song mentions an old 'folk tale' of poison in one of the main water sources for the area.<br><br>So contaminated water causes the initial surge, people trying the help the victims finding themselves getting bit, and soon you get a critical mass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well you COULD handwave this by saying animals would avoid it because they would be inherently wary of infection. Bad meat.</br>  <br>World War Z actually did a phenomenal job explaining why zombies spread through Japan with insane success. <br><br>Japanese people don't have many ways to defend themselves. It's not like Clapistan where there's an M-60 under every couch and Berettas grow on trees. The majority of citizens don't do their own housework, so they don't have tools. Most people are salarymen or businesspeople, and as such don't waste their time on sports like baseball or other things that require a lot of equipment to set up (golf is a thing, but what defense will a golf club provide against a zombie?)<br><br>You don't have guns, you don't have wrenches, you don't have bats, you don't have sledgehammers or the like. Only a few people have shovels, and most of them wouldn't really take note of how easily you can weaponize something like a shovel.  The survivor telling the story found an antique katana and started dicing zombies up.  No, I'm not making that part up.  So it's extremely tough for Japanese citizens to fight zombies back. To top it off, the JSDF isn't particularly large, and can only defend certain areas of the city at once, and if they get overwhelmed, they can't call reinforcements from thousands of miles away. They have to make due with what they have. <br><br>A defenseless population that is densely packed with an unimpressive military and a piddling degree of zombie enthusiasts would leave cities very, very exposed to rapid zombie spread. Characters like Kurumi would be painfully rare in a city, but would be one of the few who could carve out a living in that desolate world..</br></br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> injections <br>I've got it.<br><br>All the students were zombified because of the injections they give at school. Because of plot, the four main girls didn't get their shots, but everyone else did!<br><br><br> Maybe at the start people got infected without immediately turning into a zombie <br>I think that's been confirmed several times already. There's Toroumaru and that one guy at the mall. Also, the radio lady.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's undeath, I ain't gotta explain shit.<br><br> Obviously the zombies have some sort of mechanism, like a chemical signal or something, that identifies them as zombies to other zombies. Which is probably why they don't recognize Kurumi at first either: the drug saved her life, but that doesn't mean it completely blocked the infection's effects </br></br></br>  <br>I think thats it. I think I saw it once.</br>  <br> All the students were zombified because of the injections they give at school. Because of plot, the four main girls didn't get their shots, but everyone else did! <br>I know you're trying to make a funny, but everything regarding the corporation's weird experiments was strictly confidential and on lockdown.</br></br>  <br>this girl</br>  <br><br>Fetch me a Shovel.</br></br>  <br> All the students were zombified because of the injections they give at school. Because of plot, the four main girls didn't get their shots, but everyone else did! <br>This seems suspiciously familiar</br></br>  <br>Rats would eat every single zombie in masses honestly.<br><br><br>Reminds me of that zombie manga I Am a Hero where the nips have to make custom weapons because their gun control laws leave their citizens without any means of defending themselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it really is great at showing how powerful gun is in a place where no guns are in but are needed</br>  <br>Rats would also become zombies, and now you have zombie rats. I hope you're happy. You doomed us all.</br>  <br>I gained a lot of respect for her from the flashbacks she was featured in, but no she's not my favorite.<br><br>I feel HORRIBLE thinking about what she went through, and I'm not even talking about  turning. </br></br></br>  What happens to neets during a zombie outbreak? they never leave their houses, probably have provisions to last them for a long time so they don't need to restock often, don't bath so water supply should last for a long time too.  <br>The Plague 2: Plaguing with a Vengeance</br>  <br>best girl<br>when she  turned and used her last cognitive thoughts to seal herself in the storage room  was sad as fuck</br></br>  <br>The Internet's down. They'd all kill themselves.</br>  <br> Shitpost on /int/ </br>  <br>No, they're as good as dead once the virus takes over completely. The serum only works in the initial stages of infection. Even  Megu  only stayed lucid for a little bit.</br>  <br>They kill themselves once they lose access to the internet.</br>  <br>Seriously, if dogs can become zombies and they are fast and aggressive as we've seen with Megu-nee, they could spread this shit really fast.<br><br>I wonder why we don't see more dogs in the streets while the girls drive.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They'll eventually need to come out to restock on food. Thanks to their poor physique, they'd die quickly.</br></br>  <br> You doomed us all <br>That was the plan. Welcome to hell, now survivors are fucked even in their safe zones.<br>Just imagine a swarm of rats, entering buildings, eating and biting everything in site.<br><br><br>I Am a Hero had a good scene about that. Possibly the only good part of the manga imo.<br>Basically, neets would just chat on the internet and in forums, like here, about events and gossip.<br><br><br>Maybe the dogs kill themselves?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>id imagine that due to them being a neet theyd blend in with zombies</br>  <br>NEETS aren't necessarily hikkikomori.<br><br>Either way, they'd starve to death or die on the streets.<br><br>I'd love to see zombie fiction where Anons huddled on some -chan and talked about how shit sucked and they're just gonna play vidya/watch anime for as long as they can.</br></br></br></br></br>  We're lucky the birds don't get infected  <br>Maybe with their smell and low speed they'd blend in.</br>  <br>Imagine /x/ during a zombie apocalypse or something. I want to see that.</br>  <br>and if there's no internet, the ones who do nothing but shitpost go outside to write shitposts on walls, with their trips and everything.</br>  <br> talked about how shit sucked and they're just gonna play vidya/watch anime for as long as they can. <br>What else would you do during a zombie outbreak?<br><br>As long as there's electricity, I'd just  start on my backlog </br></br></br></br>  <br>Since it would be real they'd lose interest.</br>  <br> Don't lie to yourself anon, you know full well you wouldn't. </br>  <br> on the clean-up crew following a massive zombie infestation that was beaten back <br> going through a city making sure there are no zombies left <br> looking through an apartment you find a dead man, naked in front of his computer with his dick in his hand <br> he never even turned into a zombie </br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I better start printing all my check em .png just in case</br>  <br> dogs can become zombies <br>Fuck, you just reminded me that  Taroumaru can open doors in the anime. <br><br>For what fucking purpose?!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh, makes sense.</br>  <br>Without new manga coming out, is the only sensible thing to do.</br>  <br>Read I am a Hero.<br>If you just want to read the bits about neets on the internet during a zombie apocalypse, start at chapter 112.

I'll check it out.</br></br>  <br>I'll print me some gifs and webs of smug lolis</br>  <br>GG addresses the subject of guns. The reality is that, where zombies are concerned, guns aren't really useful; an intentional headshot is difficult even for professional soldiers and law enforcement, and the noise will draw more zombies to your location.</br>  <br> Taroumaru can open doors <br>Well shit. Well fuck.</br></br>  <br>No purpose. Humans can do it too before they turn.<br><br>Megu-nee will put him in a leash anyway</br></br></br>  Well is that Taroumaru 2 or is Megu-nee alive? or will they just make someone else put him down?  <br>worse<br> taromaru will bite megu-nee </br></br>   Last chapter <br> The four girls are in a car <br> Kurumi is at her limit <br> Rii has lost it <br> Yuki has lost it once again <br> Miki is the only sane <br> Turns out Miki found the weapon she threw from the roof and saved it, just in case. <br> We hear 3 shots <br> Rii, Kurumi and Yuki are dead <br> Miki is crying, trying to shoot herself but realizing there are no more bullets left in the gun <br> She exits the car and   the millitary passes right next to her, holding a lot of weapons, clearing the whole place from the smoke and zombies and driving a lot of survivors to complete safety, including Kei. <br> /a/ loses its shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw  the Mist  yesterday.</br>  <br>Considering all the Steppen King references, a The Mist ending isn't impossible.</br>  <br>I've already seen that movie lad.</br>  <br><br>Not again, please not.</br></br>   bear ears <br> button eyes <br> mustache <br> bear claws </br></br></br>  <br> Steppen King references <br>I've only seen one, though, and only in the anime.<br><br>Did I miss anything?

Yep, definitively real.</br>  I want one.  <br>The kuma things are ok (although bear paws grabbing your sides is a little too pedobear) but the fucking mustache?</br>  <br>The manga is 'realistic' and has good art but it's not really a good story or manga honestly.<br>It has some cute ideas and that's basically it.<br><br>I would personally recommend skipping it entirely.<br><br><br>Good movie honestly.<br>I personally love the ending. Especially that song.<br><br><br> no mustache </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Doesn't that mean the bear clothes are some sort of uniform or at least real somewhere?</br>  <br>Baka outbreak</br>  <br> I would personally recommend skipping it entirely. <br>Fine by me, my backlog could use some shortening.<br><br>112 was an interesting read at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A ribbon.<br><br><br>I still want the cat mug from Houkago no pleiades.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's be real. <br><br> Last Chapter <br> All of the gakkous have found the Randall corporation's base destroyed, plundered, and full of zombies <br> Kurumi begins to bite Yuuri <br> Yuki sees an opportunity <br> She grabs a bat and murders Kurumi <br> Yuuri is already turning <br> She batters Yuuri until she is a bloody mess <br> Miki is beside herself with panic and rage, but finally sees what Yuki is trying to do <br> Miki shoots herself in the head with the one bullet that remains <br> Yuki attempts to kill herself, only to find the gun empty <br> She instead buries her friends on the roof of the Randall corporation HQ, having found another rooftop garden <br> She stands at the end of the roof and looks over the ruined city <br> The last thing we can see is her smiling at a rainbow in the sky <br>   "Daijoubu" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God dammit, I fucking know this. What is this a reference to?</br>  <br>FX</br>  Why is it so difficult to fap to the School Life Club?  When will they fuck  <br>In the zonbie-dick futa doujins.</br>  <br><br>You people are horrible at this.</br></br>  <br>When they find a shota survivor.</br>  <br>Because they're pure and daughteru material.</br>  <br>Blame Steppen King, not me.<br><br>Then again, the novel had a different ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kurumi always on the left and Miki on the right?</br>  <br>Says you, I fap to Yuki all the time.</br>    <br>political allegiance.</br>  Who dies first? I say  the 4 of them survive, but Kurumi has to amputate her arm   <br>Your forgot the bonding  and the death flag  at the river.</br>  <br>A broken daughteru can't be pure.</br>  <br>The wife has to be to the right of her man.</br>  <br>Rii, Kurumi, Miki<br>Yuki is the sole survivor</br></br>  <br>What does it mean</br>  <br>Yuki is the only survivor<br> She immediately returns to her psychosis </br></br>  <br>I think we're on to something.</br>  Yuki will take up the shovel when Kurumi dies  <br>Here's one with Kurumi on the right.<br><br>dat smile</br></br></br>  <br>Wait what happened to her eye?</br>  <br>It's good that my wife and mistress get along so well</br>  <br>You mean Yuki will murder Kurumi with the shovel when she turns.</br>  <br>The teddy bear had been around already and Rii had probably seen it. She projected that outfit onto her "sister". It should really be pointed out that while in the flashback that's her "sister", Ruu is not the same person according to her, but is instead simply a "friend". A friend that looks exactly like the sister she was thinking about.<br><br>Rii is in full on delusional mode. She probably never had a sister. The idea of a sister is a convenient excuse because she has lost the "big sister" role she had with Yuki and that was basically the last role she had.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it was after the  helicopter exploded. </br>  <br>She's gone nuclear</br>  <br>It would be hilarious that for Rii to snap out of her delusions, Yuki would take the loli bear and rip it to sheard.</br>  <br>"It's time to take back what we lost"</br>  <br>Yume Nikki, the several-armed white girl.</br>  <br>Never. Kurumi likes dicks and Mii-kun has no feelings for Kurumi anyway, aside from reliance.</br>    <br>Is it permanent?<br><br>Also just noticed Yuki is some sort of reverse chuuni.</br></br></br>    <br>Reverse chuuni. That sounds kinda cool.</br>  <br> We're not burying Rii? What then? <br> We make diamonds from her ashes. And take her with us into survival.   We are The School Life Activities Club. </br></br>  <br>Jesus christ how horrifying</br>   Mii-kun will never use you as her footrest while reading Steppen King <br>Why live?</br>  <br>She only had it on for a few chapters. You should read the manga.</br>    <br>No she takes it off after like two chapters.</br>  <br> Yuki wears a bear pin on her hat <br>THE BEARS<br><br>WHAT DO THEY MEAN?!</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's bear stuff everywhere. It's basically the GG universe's version of Hello Kitty at its most popular.</br>  IT KEEPS HAPPENING      <br>See, this is from behind, so it's flipped. Miki is always on Kurumi's left.</br>  <br> Taroumaru can open doors in the anime. <br> For what fucking purpose?! <br><br>His ability to wander around will be how he gets bit in the anime, instead of being found after he was bit.</br></br></br></br>  Holy shit this is lewd<br><br>Shovel x Miki OTP</br></br>  <br>I think those are easy to make. I read somewhere that you just need to get a plain white cup and a sharpie and put it in the oven for awhile then it will stay on there.</br>  <br>Take off your goggles already.<br><br>Jesus, remove context from this one time they get pretty close and you can maybe call it gay, but within context it's anything but and is really just a comforting gesture to calm down a distressed Miki.<br><br>I love yuri, but delusion always really gets me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> learn how to handle a joke you mong </br>  But the other three aren't part of Yuki's imagination, right? The anime can't fuck it up that much, right?  <br>Too persistent, too constant, too annoying to find funny.<br><br>If they had even 3 moments vaguely similar I'd probably say "Ha! Gay!" as a joke too, but lord talk about driving shit into the ground.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course they are.</br>  <br>I've been saying it from the start. Yuki is the only survivor.</br>  <br>What if the zombie apocalypse was the part that she imagined to cope with her boring typical life?</br>  <br>then im sorry your autistic m8 if thats the thing that gets ur panties in a bunch</br>  <br>Though, a gun WOULD be useful in coercing other people.<br><br>A gun would also be useful in blowing your own brains out before you turned.</br></br></br>  <br> GG addresses the subject of guns <br><br>Throwing it away a useful tool because its not an I win button is really weak logic, I prefer to think the author had garter toss it because shovel implied it was a way out.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or you could take the expensier route and go to a place that does prints on cups. Its quite cheap I think.</br></br>  <br>What if Rii, Miki and Kurumi are the one's pretending and Yuki is just bad at playing along?</br>  <br> I prefer to think the author had garter toss it because shovel implied it was a way out. <br>I also agree with this logic. It makes much more sense since the gun could have still been potentially useful in some situation. Outright throwing it is silly and stupid.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi didn't really imply any such thing, she picked up the gun for potential usefulness but probably knew showing it off would cause a fuss. Miki explained that guns were useless for zombies, Kurumi asked why bother with them if not for that, and MIKI implied it was a way out, which is why she threw it away.</br>  <br> Yuki is actually the one whos dead, and they just imagine she still exists to keep that last bit of hope left alive </br>  <br>Maybe, but that isn't reminiscent of the plot to American Psycho.</br>  <br>This makes me wonder, didn't Kurumi got splattered with zombie blood on her first kill? Why wasn't she infected then?</br>  <br>Probably only infects through saliva.</br>  <br>It didn't get in her eyes, she was very lucky.</br>  I'm really confused on the layout of the school<br><br>Yuki goes out every day for classes into the hallways<br><br>Yet there are multiple times where they go into the halls outside the clubroom and theres a zombie there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They have a safe zone that has been blockaded off. To go to places like the library they have to move past those blockades.</br>  <br> all the clothing that supposedly mean Ruu is the teddy bear are actually present in a flashback </br>  <br>The delusion is based off the last time Rii saw her imouto.</br>  <br/>  <br>The flashback is a fake too. Rii never had a sister, it's a coping mechanism.</br>  <br>That's fucked up.<br>Can you really imagine a flashback?</br></br>  <br> It should really be pointed out that while in the flashback that's her "sister", Ruu is not the same person according to her, but is instead simply a "friend". A friend that looks exactly like the sister she was thinking about. <br><br>Yeah no.</br></br></br>  I personally like to think that Rii actually saw her imouto in the streets as a zombie and then went full delusional afterwards.<br>She had to believe that the bear was her imouto because she couldn't bear the though that she was dead.</br>  <br> believing an anon forcing his speculah as fact </br>  <br> The reality is that, where zombies are concerned, guns aren't really useful <br>A ranged weapon that can be used to intimidate humans, and kill zombies is always useful. Plus, its only a 9mm handgun, with a proper grip the recoil should be light enough for even a 18 year old Japanese girl.</br></br>  <br> believe <br>I don't believe anything. I'm just saying that it would be pretty fucked up to imagine a flashback as a coping mechanism if it's what's happening.</br></br>  <br>Turns out I misinterpreted the chapter "Ruu" is introduced in, taking "they're friends" as Rii talking to the group and explaining that this new character was the friend of her sister.<br><br>Anyway, the bear WAS still around; Yuki had no real opportunity to suddenly find it immediately at the elementary school gates, and thus it's likely Rii saw it. Furthermore, the excessive bear imagery really, really can't be ignored. There's also the fact that Ruu is very unlikely to be real. Lastly. it hasn't been that long since the outbreak and you really think Rii just "forgot" her sister throughout all this mess?

They make it a point to show that it's a very casual part of their lives, even having random arguments between people such as when Yuma doesn't tell his sister or grandmother about the parent's meet and we see Yuma's grandmother in a restaurant where two dudes just start arguing and then dueling in the backround. With holograms everywhere, shit would get chaotic for people in daily life. There's no reason whatsoever for them to use holograms when they can make it participants + spectators only. <br><br><br>What makes you say that? BBT is them just jumping in time, not jumping between dimensions.</br></br></br></br>  Sawatari will win. I bet my soul he will win.  They really are trying their best to reenact the fortune cup arc with the friendship cup huh?  <br><br>BBT disagrees with you</br></br>  <br>Just noticed the hands, the image is ruined for me now.

Even NAC says the only source is that post.  <br>Some people will believe anything if it gives them an excuse to shitpost.</br>  <br>No. The Don Pierrot and the other name (Christian?) interested me though<br><br>Those are random names to choose if you were making fake character</br></br></br>  <br><br>All Barians looks the same to me imo</br></br>  <br>....how?</br>  <br>so what you're saying is in the DM timeline which takes place in the Fusion Dimension, GX takes place 10 years later in the same timeline, and Arc-V takes place X number of years after GX in the same timeline?<br><br>Should I assume for 5Ds it takes place in the Synchro Dimension and in a timeline similar to DM (since KC exists) but X number of years after that? <br><br>As for Zexal it's in the Xyz Dimension in a completely different timeline from any of the other series?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/, tell me about Alito, Girag, and Mizael <br><br>Why do they wear the mask on top of the mask?</br></br></br>  <br>actually, 5D's, GX, and DM are all in the same timeline, with 5D's in the distant future after GX.</br>  <br>no astral worlders cared who they were until they put on the extra masks.</br>  <br>If I take off their masks, will they die?</br>  <br><br>DM-&gt;GX-&gt;5D's is one coherent timeline<br>ZeXal is whatever<br>and Arc-V seems to be an alternate timeline altogether though the various dimensions seem to be based on the different eras of YGO and Arc-V seems to take place parallel to 5D's timeline seeing how Jack and Crow are alive yet we haven't seen any other YGO characters, although all other dimensions were introduced before Synchro.<br><br>Arc-V will probably explain how the dimensions were split into respective summoning methods and maybe we'll get an explanation how it correlates with the other YGO series. And if we don't learn it in the series, maybe we'll learn it through a movie like BBT.<br><br>My theory is that the dimension split happened some time in GX because Yubel and her dimension fusion shenanigans and X years later which would regularly be the 5D's plot Arc-V takes place just with the dimensions split into their respective summoning methods.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>Done :^)</br>  <br><br>It's a not so distant future actually. Ushio is in 5D's is the same guy as the school bully from DM</br></br>  <br>Looks like Mizael doesn't want to be there.</br>  <br><br> middle schoolers hellbent on destroying the world with trading cards </br></br>  <br>mizael was a next-level cunt.</br>  <br>He doesn't</br>  <br>I wonder if Zexal's popularity means we'll get a movie that actually explains what happened when they flew away.</br>  <br>He can handle it, he's a big guy</br>  <br>did we ever get resolution on whether yusei became a good doctor?<br><br>or what happened to yugi after atem passed on?<br><br>or whether or not judai won his duel?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Completed series getting a movie <br>I don't think that's how it works, DM nostalgia nonwithstanding</br></br>  <br> did we ever get resolution on whether yusei became a good doctor? <br>Yusei didnt become a doctor you dumbass<br><br> or what happened to yugi after atem passed on? <br>Literally the 2016 movie you dumbass<br><br> or whether or not judai won his duel? <br>He had no cards in his hand or field that could stop Slifer, he lost, you dumbass</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was ZeXal really all that popular? I know it had high ratings but the japanese fanbase doesn't seem to like ZeXal either. <br>I guess there is a reason why they go back to 5D's pandering and pretend ZeXal never existed</br></br></br>  <br><br>A Ph. D is also a doctor you know</br></br>  <br>So is it possible to look at it this way then?<br><br>DM-&gt;GX-&gt;5Ds is all in one timeline in one dimension.<br><br>Zexal is completely different timeline in a completely different dimension.<br><br>Arc-V is in a completely different dimension too called the Standard Dimension but there are the other Summoning Method Dimensions in the same plane? And in some of these Dimensions are timelines that exist parallel to stuff in the DM dimension? Like how the Synchro Dimension has Jack and Crow although they're different from 5Ds Jack and Crow?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no cards in his hand or field that could stop slifer <br> judai was the one attacking <br> and he had cards in hand </br></br></br>  <br> Yusei didnt become a doctor you dumbass <br>Yusei was a doctor, just not a medical one<br><br> He had no cards in his hand or field that could stop Slifer, he lost, you dumbass <br>Slifer would have died end of turn because it was special summoned</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everything related to the first three worlds is an alternate timeline from Arc-V, so that point is moot. <br><br>Holy shit you are retarded</br></br></br>  <br> pretend ZeXal never existed <br> Heartland references <br> same school uniform with inverted colors <br>Pretty sure that's just your delusion. The new arc is specifically about the Synchro dimension, which is why they're there. Not only that but 5Ds got shitty as fuck rating in Japan, Zexal is alot more popular, but also too recent to make a throwback to already.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but the japanese fanbase doesn't seem to like ZeXal either. <br><br>That's wrong though.</br></br></br>  <br> would have <br><br>Keywords</br></br></br>  <br>that's exactly it.<br><br><br>are you?<br><br><br> yusei didn't become a doctor <br>yes....he did? not a medical doctor, but he became a doctor<br><br> no cards in his hand or field to stop slifer <br>judai's entire schtick was powering up his own monsters, and he had honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Zexal is completely different timeline in a completely different dimension <br>Where are you getting this from? There still aren't any contradictions made between GX and Zexal, while references are drawn specifically to the monsters used in those. Kaito used both Ritual and Fusion summoning as well.</br></br>  <br><br>It is heavily implied that the dimensions in Arc-V were forcefully split and it used to be one single dimension. Who knows how long that was ago in Arc-V timeline. <br><br>It's basically an alternate universe that was split into 4 alternate universes on top of that. Or it's an alternate universe BECAUSE it was split into 4 alternate universes. Who knows. That's what the show is about and we're trying to figure out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everything in your post is wrong.<br><br>Zexal was more popular than 5Ds<br><br><br>Guys I'm 100% sure all this stuff you are speculating about how dimensions work isn't even occuring to the writers right now. They don't think of this stuff to the level of extreme detail like we do</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>whee did it say he had honest<br><br>didnt honest die</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean aside from little children. Among the 2ch crowd or any dedicated YGO fanbase ZeXal seems to be hugely unpopular</br></br>  <br>This anon is totally tsun for the other one</br>  <br>And you're getting this from?</br>  <br> kaito used fusion summoning <br>uh...when?<br>I know he used rituals, but at this point, we've yet to learn whether or not rituals have their own world.<br><br> there still aren't any contradictions between gx and zexal <br>technology progressed completely differently. in GX world, synchros were discovered, which led to the nuking and eventual emergence of the meklords, while in Zexal, d-gazers and Xyz summons became the norm, with no references EVER to synchro summons.<br><br><br> didn't honest die <br>...no? judai used honest to beat DARKNESS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize that little kids are the only art of the fanbase that actually matter right?</br>  <br><br>Opinions from japanese people</br></br>  <br> He had no cards in his hand or field that could stop Slifer, he lost, you dumbass <br><br><br> &gt;no cards in his hand or field that could stop slifer <br> &gt;judai was the one attacking <br> &gt;and he had cards in hand <br><br>You guys are missing the point. It doesn't matter what cards he had/didn't have in his hand. He lost. It's implied when he says "Yugi-san, I'll become stronger.... Until that time...."<br><br>He wouldn't need to say that if he beat Yugi. Thematically speaking him losing to Yugi makes sense too because it was the spark he needed to get his love for dueling back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>him seeing yugi's excitement alone already gave him his love, his attitude towards the duel completely changes by the end of the vision.</br>  <br> or any dedicated YGO fanbase ZeXal <br><br>And again, you're wrong. Zexal is still one of the most popular behind only DM at this point. Hell it's only previous show getting consistent fanart and discussion despite the fact that it's over already.</br></br></br>  <br> uh...when? <br>Photon Twin Lizard. <br><br>Zexal takes place in a timeline different from 5Ds. They intentionally left out any references to 5Ds, but they had a small story dedicated to the previous legendary monsters used in GX and DM. Since there are no contradictions and the summoning methods are the same, it's safe to say that there was no intention to make it take place in a different universe altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean aside from little children. <br>Why would you be considering opinions other than small children?<br><br>You know "children's card game" is very literal right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure sounds reliable. Zexal is incredibly popular, and has been since around the time Shingetsu revealed himself.</br>  <br> Zexal is still one of the most popular behind only DM at this point. <br>No, GX is still the second most popular.</br></br>  <br>in that case, perhaps a diverging timeline thanks to the time travel shenanigans in BBT?</br>  <br>Fujos (i.e the majority of the adult Yugioh fanbase) love the shit out of it</br>  <br>Something like that, but I doubt there's an actual cause for it. Like 5Ds is just events that happen after GX if they discover Ener-D or something, whereas Zexal is if nothing world-threatening at all happened for really long because there were no Synchros to destroy everything.</br>  <br>Fujo opinions don't matter. They love every season.</br>  <br>Huh? Even Zexal reruns get better ratings.</br>  Tfw Yuzu and Yugo are going to leap in to protect unconscious Yuya<br><br>Tfw Yuya will never know he was so close to Yuzu</br></br>  <br>Are you actually retarded. Not only does the Bonds Beyond Time movie explicitly show 5D's and GX to be in the same universe, there are a bunch of references to GX<br><br>Pic fucking related</br></br></br>  <br>Zexal was wildly popular in Japan but despised everywhere else.5Ds was wildly popular in the USA but not very popular in Japan.</br>  <br>It's not, Zexal is more popular than GX in Japan.</br>  <br><br> Hell it's only previous show getting consistent fanart and discussion despite the fact that it's over already. <br><br> Number of fanart pics with the DM tag on pixiv: 48508 <br> Number of fanart pics with the 5D's tag on pixiv: 18376 <br> Number of fanart pics with the ZeXal tag on pixiv: 15080 <br><br>Yeah sure<br><br> tfw nobody cares about GX <br> 10513 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There still aren't any contradictions made between GX and Zexal <br>Besides the fact that Yugi and Jaden both met Yusei, the same Yusei who came from the future where Synchro Summoning, Fusion Summoning, and regular Summoning are prominent? <br><br> oh they referenced these monsters <br><br>Woop-to-fucking-doody do. Arc-V did the same thing. Nothing in ZEXAL screams same timeline as DM/GX. The Duel Disks don't even have similarities besides the pads. The technology is completely different, no mentioning of anything that happened in DM/GX, none of the same lore as DM/GX, people don't even use monsters from DM/GX besides the Duel Lodge thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gx is easily the most unpopular YGO in Japan. By a margin</br></br>  <br>Trash taste that fits them perfectly</br>  <br> Gx is easily the most unpopular YGO in Japan. By a margin <br>Keep believing that, sport.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't bracelet-kun zap Yuya away?</br>  <br>That's 5Ds anon</br>  <br><br>Note that DM doesn't have it's own tag on pixiv. It's all 遊戯王 with 5D's, ZeXal and GX being child tags.<br>So according to pixiv among the YGO spinoffs 5D's is at the top and GX at the bottom</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Huh? Even Zexal reruns get better ratings. <br>Please prove it. <br><br>We know Zexal's average ratings against GX's. They don't even compare.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yugi and Jaden both met Yusei <br>Different timeline, something which you don't seem to grasp. Zexal is simply if the events of 5Ds never happened.<br><br>ARC-V simply showed them as monsters, not monsters with legendary legacies that an old man would spend years making statues out of because of how important they were. Nothing in Zexal screams DM/GX, but they make direct references to it. The technology is not completely different, it's further in the past to the point where duels went from sports to being as normal as eating food. The events of DM/GX very clearly take place far further in the past for them to achieve legacy status. They do present another similar lore to DM/GX which is Shadow Duels specifically using magical tablets when prominent figures are fighting against eachother. Hell, they even call it a Yami no Game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure what you think these numbers mean considering Zexal is the second newest show and fanartists post new shit all the time, especially on twitter.</br>  Can any single one of you people actually back up your claims with evidence that doesn't involve "I read posts on 2ch" and "number of fanarts"? <br><br>Like any actual numbers, TV ratings,sales or something? Cause this entire discussion is sounding incredibly stupid</br></br>  Currently 6 episodes into 5Ds. Can't believe that they actually aired some of this stuff, like the police brutality against Yusei. <br> It only heightens my desire for a full on serious mode dystopian cyberpunk Yugioh </br>  I'm glad we are having so much discussion that hasn't anything to do with Ruris  <br>I personally surveyed every human being in Japan and they told me that Duel Monsters was the worst Yugioh series and Zexal was the best.</br>  <br> Different timeline, something which you don't seem to grasp. <br>What in ZEXAL suggests ZEXAL is a different timeline of DM-&gt;GX-ZEXAL?</br></br>  <br>We spent like three whole threads talking about Sawatari vs Yuzu, there's really nothing left to do but shitpost about Zexal and pray to god that Crow jobs</br>  <br>I meant not being in the same timeline as GX -&gt; 5Ds and instead diverging to GX -&gt; Zexal.</br>  <br> Can any single one of you people actually back up your claims <br>I dont think they can. I'm pretty sure certain "facts" get repeated on here so often that people assume they're true</br></br>  <br> They do present another similar lore to DM/GX which is Shadow Duels specifically using magical tablets when prominent figures are fighting against eachother. Hell, they even call it a Yami no Game. <br>They have done that even in the mangas. The only series that hasn't had a Shadow Duel is Arc-V</br></br>  <br>So what? The point is that it's a very clear reference to DM, as sealing monsters within the tablets wouldn't have become a thing without DM.</br>  What do you think of new Anzu?  <br>Yes, and I'm asking what suggests that?</br>  <br>Did someone say Ruris?</br>    <br> The only series that hasn't had a Shadow Duel is Arc-V <br>I wouldn't be too sure.<br><br>The carding technology Academia uses lets out the same pink miasma we see come from Yuzu's bracelet.<br><br>So the duels we see are weaponized shadow duels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that they intentionally avoid anything relating to 5Ds while actively referencing DM and GX. The only world-ending catastrophe that happened after GX was because of Synchros, so it's natural that things like that wouldn't happen without Synchros.</br>  <br><br>Even IF ZeXal were to get 3000+ new fanart pics on pixiv even with Arc-V currently running and it getting all the new focus it would still be only equal to 5D's (and that assuming of course that 5D's would get absolutely no new fanart pics on pixic despite currently a lot of new pics with the 5D's tag being created thanks to ZeXal). <br><br>So saying ZeXal is the ONLY one that gets consistent fanart is just absolutely retarded which is what these numbers prove.</br></br></br></br>    Where the fuck are people getting the rating figures for the YGO shows for Japan from anyway?  <br> Shadow Duels <br><br>Literally every Yu-Gi-Oh story bar Arc-V has had Shadow Duels, even the old games on the PS2 and such. I'm talking about the actual lore like in GX when they explicitly say multiple times that there are only 12 dimensions and they were all touched upon in the Yubel story yet ZEXAL comes and introduces 2 more dimensions.</br></br></br>    <br>They are literally making it up</br>  <br>Literally for what reason would they bring up those events specifically? They already showed the monsters involved in those events and called them legendary, which very obviously means they did something to achieve that status. Shadow Duels literally would not exist if it wasn't for DM, so if it took place seperately to that then it wouldn't have been in the series at all.</br>  <br>I am every person from Japan and we're here to tell you that I think 5Ds sucks and we'll never watch anything to do with card games on motorcycles again</br>  <br>I want to go out on a date with a Ruri.</br>  <br><br>Well if anyone can read moon this is all I've found<br><br>http://sakuhindb.com/janime/7_YUGIO<wbr>H_20ZEXAL/<br>http://sakuhindb.com/janime/7_Yougi<wbr>o_20five_20ds/<br><br>I can't read moon but it seems the reception for 5D's was better but that's me looking at graphs I don't understand</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well for one thing, there was that poll at AFA that had Zexal at top 30. I think ARC-V got top 30 or something.</br>  <br>I don't know if it's the nose or the eyes that making it weird. That's not official, right?</br>  <br>Nigga you just said ZEXAL is after GX in its own timeline yet ZEXAL fucks up the lore that GX established. <br><br>ZEXAL has its own lore that doesn't make any connections to DM OR GX bar Shadow Duels. And Shadow Duels are literally just duels with a life or death condition. Just because ZEXAL has Shadow Duels doesn't mean its automatically connected to DM and GX. <br><br>In ZEXAL, a fucking dragon created the universe. That in itself makes it a completely different universe than DM and GX.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't believe how anyone would even believe ZeXal shitposters. 5D's got a fucking movie. How the fuck can anyone think it was not popular in Japan?</br></br>  <br>I told them it wasn't, and I'm always right</br>  <br> That's not official, right <br>It is, they've revealed some sketches</br></br>  <br> yet ZEXAL fucks up the lore that GX established. <br>What. When? <br><br> In ZEXAL, a fucking dragon created the universe <br>The universe started with a card, the Numeron Code. In GX in the duel against DARKNESS, they say the exact same thing. How is this contradictory?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally out of their ass</br></br>  <br> In ZEXAL, a fucking dragon created the universe <br>I agree with you in that I think Zexal is its own completely different thing, but an undisclosed card created the universe in GX</br></br>  <br>Well she's 2ayy4me.</br>  <br>What? If you mean BBT that's because of the 10th anniversary of the original DM anime, not because of 5Ds specifically. <br><br>Unless you mean that Stardust/Red Dragon Accelerator OVA</br></br></br>  <br>No, the Numeron Dragon created the universe. Life and all the rest of reality was made by the Numeron Code when it hit Earth.<br><br>DARKNESS says the universe was created by a card.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Fucking GXfags, not even Zexalfags are that bad. They even admite the first part of Zexal is shit, but OH! god forbid someone say something bad about GX! because the GX defense force begin their witchhunt.</br></br></br>  <br>The reason its estimated that 5Ds was not as popular in Japan as its contemporaries was that it's average ratings were at a lower average compared to the other ones. it's also speculated because of how very little Synchro support came out for it after it ended compared to getting a bunch of new Fusions, notably HEROes<br><br>Also, it was a custom to rerun the previous series at some point during a new series but this never happened with 5Ds. During Zexal, they reran GX again.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I don't particularly like GX. Actually, I haven't even finished it. I'm just quite sure that it was the second most popular, certainly not the most unpopular</br>  <br><br>Funny thing is Darkness also told Jaden of the world in ruin at an undisclosed time<br><br>I wonder what he was talking about</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If that's supposed to be an indication of ratings, what about the fact that 5D's got a shit ton of video games released?</br></br>  <br><br>The Numeron Dragon created the universe you dumbasses</br></br>  <br>So did GX and DM?</br>  If anyone is wondering over Zexal's popularity, the link for the actual poll is dead right now. However the most recent standings available in the archive had Zexal at #7-8, and ARC-Vs highest I can find anyone mentioning was it at #30. <br><br>https://archive.moe/_/search/text/a<wbr>nime%20festival%20zexal/<br>It's Anime Festival Tokyo by the way.</br></wbr></br></br>  This question about ratings was asked at NAC once and after navigating baidu somehow, the average ratings were pulled<br><br>Average rating for<br>Original-7.0<br>Gx-3.4<br>5d-2.2<br><br>Zexal average rating for the first half of 2013<br>2.9 <br><br>After that, Zexal moved to a new timeslot and it, along with Arc-V, has no ratings data available. There, now stop fighting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That cover <br> No character songs </br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/122232<wbr>456/#122237032<br>That data is from chinese Youtube or something apparently.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Yeah but ZeXal didn't. I think it only got that one 3DS game.<br>I think 5D's has the most YGO games (at least if you count Japan only games) though. If you count western stuff, DM is probably on top</br></br></br>  <br>That poll was for best of 2014 and Arc-V had only just started obviously it wouldn't be high up</br>  <br>Reminder Kaito's VA is living the life and is now voicing Slice of Life/Romance animes</br>  Arc V &gt; DM &gt; 5Ds &gt; GX &gt; Zexal  <br>That makes me happy actually. His VA is the most emotional one I've heard, I still hold down his death as one of the best episodes.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JL9<wbr>tL9Ry3sk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  This is a list of ratings up to the end of Zexal I. I've crosschecked a few, so they seem okay. Zexal I is definitely higher than 5D's.<br><br>http://www.geocities.jp/animesityou<wbr>ritu/</wbr></br></br>    <br>He voices this semon demon</br>  I want to card this fucking xyz scum.  <br>I remember when Vector made his big reveal and Pixiv exploded with fanart. <br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm204<wbr>25678<br>I can't blame them, this shit was fucking scary. How did parents let them watch this?</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> death <br>but anon, orbital 7 called him a space ambulance! He's just MISSING!</br></br>  <br>Be honest, would you expect THAT from a show starring fucking Yuma?</br>  Post best girl.    <br>I mean, it was a great moment, but it's not like other shounen don't get away with comparable or worse.</br>    <br>For YGO, that's not really that scary</br>  <br>No, that's it. Like they were fucking around doing their silly Barian Police business while hiding things from Astral like he was a nosy parent, and the result was utter despair<br><br><br>Yeah, but it's the contrast from everything else prior to that which made it so intense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you are going to lose that soul pretty hard</br>  <br>Even though it was obvious that Shingetsu was Vector, this scene was fucking great</br>  <br> I want to fuck this carding xyz scum </br>  <br> actively referencing DM and GX <br>Where? Beside the statue episode, please tell me the others references.</br></br>  I don't fucking care what anybody say, that ritual trap card is the best thing ever for rituals, so I will get it, but I really hope they ban Trishula, because that is the card based on another broken ass card that never should had that effect exosted.  <br>Only homosexuals would disagree</br>   Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn as an YCS Prize Card <br>FUCKING WHY I HATE YOU TREWART FUCKING LEAVE NOW I HATE THIS WHY I AM STILL PLAYING THIS IF THE GODAMN PROUD OF AMERICASHITTER ARE STILL BEING ASSHOLES</br>  HAHAHA IT MUST FUCKING SUCK TO BE A LIGHTSWORN FAG RIGHT ABOUT NOW  <br>RIP Pegasus. ;_;</br>  <br>Ruri pls, you are attracted to your brother a bit too much.</br>  <br>Or infernoid or clownblade or anything that wants milling you stupid fuck.</br>  <br> you stupid fuck <br>Found the salty mill.dek player</br></br>  <br>Yes I like to sack bitches.</br>  <br> America shit <br>Leave pleb, I bet your country would wish to be like us.</br></br>  <br>Sora please go back to sleep.</br>  <br> Tewart and KoA ever doing anything logical </br>  <br>I don't even fucking play this game IRL anymore and you shouldn't either.

There's no longer no one on the Xyz Dimension.</br>  <br>Ah I love YGOPRO/DNG and shit, get this card for completely free.</br>  <br>It's Heartland anyway, they're clearly pro-incest. Shark and Rio were shameless about it and nobody batted an eyelid.</br>  <br>Shun and Ruri's parents need to stop.</br>  <br>I know, any more Shuns and I'll explode</br>  <br>I wouldnt be surprised if Rio makes incest mandatory when she becomes President</br>  <br>Well look at Shun/Ruri.</br>  <br>muh dick.</br>  <br>You can't force something like that. The purest form of love must occur naturally.</br>  <br>Sorry don't want to be obese</br>  <br>In Zexal they mentioned that Kaito's deck was made using technology from different worlds.</br>  <br>I love this artist.</br>  <br>Yeah I just found this link too and ended up calculating all the ratings just to make sure. I got:<br><br>DM - 7.09 average rating ran from Jan. 2000 - Sept. 2004<br><br>GX - 3.18 average rating from Sept. 2004 - April 2008<br><br>5D's - 2.07 average rating from April 2008 - April 2011<br><br>ZEXAL - 2.25 average rating from April 2011 - October 2012<br><br>The list only goes up to the end of 2012 so there's no consolidated data for 2013-2015 but you can pretty much extrapolate that ratings are going to go down. ARC-V is probably lower than ZEXAL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I am ok trying to win it or buy it.<br><br> Judging us in something about a people instead of country <br>top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br> DM 7.09 <br> Rest have less than 4 <br>Damn</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck with that then, if you don't win it you best be ready to shill out some major money for it if you want it that bad.</br>  So with this movie are they trying to turn Yugi into a Ritual specialist? That new Black Luster Solider support works for generic rituals as well, the BLS effects are just added bonuses.  <br>Well Atem, Yugi, and Kaiba were pretty fucking fabulous.</br>  <br>KOG always wins baby</br>  <br>Kaiba is one of the few characters I can remember who I simultaneously love and hate to death. Can't wait to see what kind of bullshit he pulls in the new movie</br>  <br>It's probably just a Ritual, Yugi will be an Xyz specialist considering Black Luster and Gaia support. <br><br>Since someone brought up Minerva.<br><br> tfw Infinity ends up being a prize card too <br> tfw Head Judge continues being a cunt on the banlist <br> tfw KoA continues to be massive fuck ups </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No amount of Dark Magician Girl porn will ever be enough</br></br>  Post YFW Yuya and Yuzu reunite  IM GONNA BRING IT TO EM<br><br>WATCH ME HIGH FIVE THE SKYS</br></br>  <br> posting non 2d girls.  <br>the fuck are you doing</br></br>  Where is the TCG banlist? It's already three months late.    <br>I want all Konami to reconsider what they are doing before people just bankrupt them. And if you don't believe me see what the "fans" and "professional magazines" did (though in this case was really unfair) to SEGA and Sonic and now soon they will do the same with Nintendo,</br>  <br>Go pop flying</br>  <br>There's that new Sacred BLS as well as the Supreme BLS</br>  <br>Get the fuck off of 4chan and jump into the Stadium, Yuzu.</br>  <br>Sauce</br>  <br>Considering he's the main character and Atem has become a villain and now Pendulums, Synchro, Xyz, and his BEWD, I'm going to imagine A LOT of bullshit. <br><br>Head Judge said for us to stop being impatient and read a book during summer while we wait. They're being cunts about it because they can't actually figure it out.</br></br></br>  <br>It always bothered me that Yuma's Jap voice sounded a lot deeper than you would expect<br><br>His dub voice nails it but his Jap voice makes it seem like Yuma is some 18 year old smoker when he's only 13</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Damn, can't believe 5Ds was received that badly in Nipland. At least DM still reigns supreme.<br><br>Any info on the BBT movie sales?</br></br></br>  Even if vanity is banned, I really think I should move to ARG.  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Do you really enjoy playing against Tellers and Qli?</br>  <br>Blue Eyes is still my favorite ace after all this time. Just has an irreplaceable charm to it that I can't put my finger on.<br> that episode where Kaiba tributed Obelisk to summon Blue Eyes and shit on Ishizu </br></br>  <br>His dub voice only got worse over time though, and it was never great in the beginning either. Shark's voice made him sound like he could be older than Kaito, who was 18.</br>  <br> moving to a meme format <br><br>Well, don't let us stop you.</br></br></br>  <br>At least we got a banlist, and some of them are almost accurate (I could say something against Lavalval and Fusion Gate, but whatever).<br>With Konami what we have?</br></br>  <br> His dub voice only got worse over time though, and it was never great in the beginning either <br>It was his first ever VA role, I wouldnt be surprised if his voice couldnt handle the strain</br></br>  <br>Grossed 250 million in box office and sold about 12k BDs. I guess that's good enough. Hopefully this new movie will have better sales.</br>  <br>There's also the alleged sightings of Silent Magician and Silent Swordsman who looked like their manga art instead of white and blue.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12814532 <br>The TCG meta has been stupid as fuck for a really long fucking time.<br><br>Probably the design, I used to think like this as a kid for Red Eyes too. Too bad I suck at using either deck what with their graveyard discarded, Silver's Cry, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>the guys that print the cards?</br>  <br><br>Or just start hosting your own duels or something on ygopro and omitting the things you don't want. I see people doing duels all the time with shit like "No Xyz, No Synchro." or "No Meta" or "DM Classic Only." and shit.</br></br>  <br> Grossed 250 million in box office and sold about 12k BDs. <br><br>How much you wanna bet that was all because Yami was in the movie?</br></br></br>  <br>It was definitely because of Atem and Judai. The new one is going to sell like hotcakes having Kaiba, Yugi, and Atem all in it.</br>  <br>I'll host a duel on YGOpro<br><br>US Server<br><br>Name: Hundred<br><br>Password: Bennis<br><br>Rules: No  fucking scrubs </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to know what deck you use Hundred, but I'm afraid I'd just get ran over as I haven't played YGO in ages. Just been trying out things on the AI here recently.</br>  <br> LIGHTSWORNS <br>Literally who cares.</br></br>  <br>I use the sackiest deck, Heraldic Beasts</br>  <br>Anyone wanna step up and join? I've got two spectator-kuns in here 2shy2duel</br>  <br>Red-Eyes is so much easier to play with the new support coming through</br>  <br>I used to spurn the OCG meta for being nothing but rank 4 spam engines with mass S/T removal and other nonsense and now I'm begging KoA to do things that even remotely resemble OCG scene.</br>  <br>Yeah I plan to give it a look again, but so far I'm enjoying just messing around with random decks so far. Wish I was good at playing Fluffals though, I'm dogshit at using them.</br>  <br>No, you see anon, when someone does something for a while, they get better at it by simply having that mileage under their belt. Muscles don't break down and stay that way, they rebuild and get stronger. When an artist practices drawing, as an example, they also build muscle memory and finer control of their arm and hand. Your body's ability to recover and adapt is not something that you get to flip on and off like a switch.<br><br>Many Yugioh characters, including MCs, had first-time or rookie VAs who got better over time. I've only seen 4-5 episodes of the Zexal dub (a few at the start and a few around the time Kaito died). But for whatever reason, whether it was 4k's directing or the VA himself, Yuma's voice was actually worse compared to what it was at the beginning, it's amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll play go easy on me senpai</br>  <br> ygopro <br><br>just learn how to play and go on DN.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the same shit man.</br>  <br> Grossed 250 million in box office <br>Yen? Because I thought box office sales were around 2-3 mil (US).</br></br>  <br>except ygopro is automated, has retarded time limits on turns, and lets shitters be shitters, even when it gets the rulings on the system wrong?</br>  <br>I got 2.56 just for Zexal I. You sure you didn't count things like reruns?</br>  <br>I haven't had any of these problems honestly.</br>  Hundred senpai where did you go?  <br> except ygopro is automated <br>Like every other modern simulator, yes.<br><br> has retarded time limits on turns <br>You can change it if you want but I sure as hell don't want to wait 10 minutes for my opponent to decide what to do.<br><br> and lets shitters be shitters <br>Hilarious considering you prefer DN which has the most shitters who think MST negates and you need a retarded admin to come in just to correct them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else thinking that Yugi vs Kaiba will just be Yugi using Gaia and Black Luster Solider's new support with the Silent archetype at first and then against the villain he'll bust out the new Dark Magician support?  <br>Yes</br>  <br> Like every other modern simulator, yes. <br>other than DN, you mean?<br> You can change it if you want but I sure as hell don't want to wait 10 minutes for my opponent to decide what to do. <br>some decks have long combos that basically force you to autolose on pro simulators.<br> Hilarious considering you prefer DN which has the most shitters who think MST negates and you need a retarded admin to come in just to correct them. <br>sounds to me like you're just playing against shitters, as higher level DN doesn't have issues like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He will probably use DM against Kaiba and BLS against villain</br>   yfw Pendulum BE/DM <br>Das it mane</br>  <br> other than DN, you mean? <br>Which is the cause of people not understanding cards all the time, such as MST.<br> some decks have long combos that basically force you to autolose on pro simulators. <br>Precisely why time limits on turns is a thing. <br> sounds to me like you're just playing against shitters, as higher level DN doesn't have issues like that. <br>This exists on both pro and dn. They both have their shitters and they both have their good players. Cherry picking either one is silly to be honest. The only real fault with pro is how long it takes to get new cards sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> other than DN, you mean? <br>DN is not modern at all. It's a shitty flash application and it took them years to even get counters and tokens properly applied.<br><br> some decks have long combos that basically force you to autolose on pro simulators. <br>What are you talking about? You get more time with each play, there is no way for you to lose unless you literally don't know what you're doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for every idiot that was assured by other scrubs on DN of a stupid ruling, I've had scrubs come from ygopro to DN with wrong rulings because 'THATS HOW IT WORKED ON PRO!!'<br> You get more time with each play <br>not last time I checked, which is when, after losing to time while playing madolches, I decided fuck pro simulators.</br></br></br>  does anyone have a good place to read the original Duelist manga? All I find is shitty scanlations like pic related  They buffed Jack's synchro and gave him a neat trap.  Scar-Red Cocoon<br>Trap Normal<br>(1) Target 1 Dragon-Type Synchro Monster you control; equip this card to that target you control. (2) If the monster equipped by this effect battles an opponent’s monster, negate the effects of all face-up monsters your opponent controls until the end of the Damage Step. (3) During the End Phase, if this card is in your Graveyard and was sent there during this turn: You can target 1 “Red Dragon Archfiend” in your Graveyard; Special Summon it.</br></br>  <br>Oh god don't remind me of this abomination</br>  <br>Is this how he would counter Yusei in a rematch?</br>  <br>High and low ;)</br>  <br>Red Wyvern<br>Fire Dragon / Synchro / Effect<br>LV6 2400/2000<br>1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters<br>(1) During either player’s turn, if there are monsters on the field whose ATK is higher than this card’s ATK: You can activate this effect; destroy the monster with the highest ATK on the field (your choice, if tied). You can only use this effect once while this Synchro Summoned card is face-up on the field.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the trap he used during 5D's last episode</br>  <br>I never really finished 5ds, all I saw was gifs and webm's of the final impact from Junk Warrior. This is another reason to marathon 5ds.</br>  <br>And I've had the reverse happen where people come from DN to PRO and assume things too, again such as MST negating spell activation. <br><br>Besides you shouldn't be losing on time at all in any situation unless you're actively trying to FTK every time and that's only in the case that you can't do it fast enough because you're taking your time activating what you need. <br><br>I've seen madolches do just fine on PRO regardless of time and even then as someone else stated, the time limit can be changed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anime one was slightly different<br><br>Continuous Trap<br>After activation, equip this card to a face-up "Red Nova Dragon" you control. If the equipped monster attacks an opponent's monster, negate that monster's effects. When this card on the field is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, you can Special Summon 1 "Red Dragon Archfiend" from your Graveyard during the End Phase of the turn this card was destroyed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why is it called SPHR if its Highspeed Riders and not Speedhigh riders?</br></br>  <br>pro encourages bad players to not learn why cards work the way they do, DN does not. once you get past the bubble of scrubs, you don't encounter turbo scrubs....shit, I dick around on trad, and I haven't encountered an 'MST negates' player in at least a year.</br>  <br>Bad nipponese engrish i guess</br>  <br>It's a special booster</br>  When do we get our first look at Breakers of Shadow?  <br>The full name is Booster SP(Special): Highspeed Riders.</br>  <br>So its Special High Riders?<br><br>Jesus Christ</br></br></br>  <br><br>Retrained Dragon Master Knight when?</br></br>  <br>It's just a special booster pack, that's how it is named in OCG, TCG will be HSRD</br>  <br>Bad players are going to be bad regardless of whether or not they learn why the cards work the way they do or not. If you understand the cards then it doesn't matter if you use PRO or DN, as you still know what it is your doing and can do it in a timely and effective manner. Besides PRO is automated so it doesn't matter if they learn the cards or not, the system helps them out and does it for them and it's not like people don't just look up whichever deck is doing good at the moment and just copy it regardless of program, after that it's just a matter of how the cards work together and that's as simple as reading the text and then playing it.</br>  <br>It's the same as Raging Masters (SPRG) and Tribe Force (SPTR).</br>  <br><br>Nips and their naming schemes</br></br>  Hey guys it's the anon who asked about how to get into Yu-Gi-Oh again since I had stopped after GX.<br><br>I've been watching Arc V and I'm at episode 23 right now. But I've got a question about this damn pendulum bullshit.<br><br>So basically Yuuta has these 2 special cards. First of all I thought all cards were made by the pegasus foundation or whatever. So how come he has unique special cards and how come the LDS school can make cards?<br><br>Second, I assumed that the pendulum cards were lvl 1 and 8 (the white one being lvl 1 and the black one lvl 8) making Yuuta able to summon cards in between.<br><br>I'm assuming he can just summon cards from his hand.<br><br>But now at episode 23 he cancels his pendulum and does a fusion between his odd eye dragon and the white card that is apparently a lvl 5 card needing a tribute.<br><br>How the fuck does this pendulum bullshit work? If it allows you to summon shit between lvl 1 and 8 then why is the card that is meant to be the pillar of lvl 1 actually lvl 5?<br><br>Also I haven't seen Zetal or 5d or whatever so are the alternate version of yuuta and the glasses dude people I'm supposed to know about? Is this a different universe?<br><br>Also this Solid Vision system makes shit real and they just let their children play in a real field with flying moving platforms floating several meters in the air? That's dangerous!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Isn't it funny how even after all these new gaia and BLS cards Envoy of the beginning is still the easiest one to use in a Yugi themed deck? I was hoping the movie would be a chance to make his deck a bit more consistant but it seems like it'll be full of this shit, kuriboh shit, Silent shit and Dark Magician shit together in an unholy combination of dead draws. Here's hoping Kaiba gets some really good stuff. Blue eyes still suck compared to Red Eyes now.1  <br>Pendulum Scales, ya doofus. <br>If you have scales of 1-8 in the pendulum zone, you can special monsters 2-7.<br>Levels have nothing to do with the monsters in the scales.<br>Also, the action fields for the children are bouncy and safe. <br>Also, it's fucking YUYA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>here's how pendulums work. <br><br>put a pendulum card in the pendulum zone. it's treated as a spell. get two cards in the zones and you can, once per turn, pendulum summon any number of monsters from your hand and faceup in your extra deck, as long as their levels are BETWEEN the scales. if pendulum cards on the field would go to the grave, they return to the extra deck. faceup, instead.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to kiss him</br>  <br> pegasus <br><br>Alternate universe anon. Solid vision with mass is also a reference to KaibaCorp's Solid Vision</br></br></br>  <br>LDS is like kaiba corp and industrial illusions together, they have a school, make duel disks and make cards</br>  <br>Why don't you read the fucking rules?<br><br>I2 hasn't been the maker of cards since Doma with shit like Orichalcos or half the space and Monster spirit decks in GX.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>as for the rest of it...<br>he invented pendulum summoning. LDS is effectively the company in DM/GX that created cards, they create ALL the cards in the world now, so they were trying to simulate pendulum cards.<br><br>the children's solid vision(where they train) is soft, so they're not at risk.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dub calls it ARC Vision <br> Still thinking all this shit is AR like ZEXAL </br></br>  <br>If they're bouncy and safe then why did he try to save the girl and the kids in the very first episode?<br><br>And in episode 23 the chandelier breaks or some shit and it drops on YUYA and everyone is all panicky and going apeshit cause the fool killed himself. (But he was actually okay and CHANGED HIS FATE!)<br><br><br><br><br>If LDS make the cards then why can't they make pendulum cards? <br>Like are YUYA's pendulum cards counterfeit? Was his dad just some cheating bastard? Why did he only make 2 cards? And why did he give them to his son?<br>Also is the fusion card in animeverse able to fuse any 2 shits together?<br><br>And thanks everyone for the quick and detailed responses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The holograms were always called Solid Vision. Real Solid Vision is just a variant developed by the Leo Corp.</br>  <br>Nigga that is what I said. In ZEXAL they call it AR Vision though because its AR through the glasses.</br>  <br>Pendulum Cards are half green monster cards that can be placed in the Pendulum Zone. Their scales (the numbers in the middle of the card (not the levels)) determine things. So Scale 1-8 allows you to summon monsters Levels 2-7. Any Pendulum monster on the field goes back to the extra deck instead of the graveyard. <br><br>As for LDS/Pegasus, Arc-V exists in a different dimension or timeline than DM does, so Pegasus might not even exist. But yes, it's a different universe it has no correlation to any other series beyond the other dimensions being the other series in their own alternate timeline states. <br><br>The Vision System is made bouncy for the small children and by the time you're in Junior Youth, Yuya's age and stuff you should have mastered jumping around between platforms and even if not, the falls don't exactly hurt them anyways, it seems only say Shun's dueling is dangerous because of the shockwaves it creates or anybody from any other dimension, barring Synchro and their D-Wheels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If LDS make the cards then why can't they make pendulum cards? <br><br>They did make Pendulum Cards, remember Reiji has them, you'll see more of them as you keep watching.</br></br></br>  <br> If LDS make the cards then why can't they make pendulum cards?  <br> at episode 23 <br>???</br></br></br>  <br>no, yuya made his cards pendulums MID-DUEL. his dad didnt make them pendulums. and they're real, and yes, later on, LDS makes pendulum cards. <br><br>basically, I guess you haven't seen yet, but 'real' Xyz/synchro/fusion cards are much stronger than LDS's usual cards. Pendulums are brand new, and yuya has 'real' pendulums, so they're much different from any cards they could try to make.</br></br></br>  <br> If they're bouncy and safe then why did he try to save the girl and the kids in the very first episode? <br>Not all of the Action Fields have that faculty. You will see that later in the Maiami Championship.<br> If LDS make the cards then why can't they make pendulum cards? <br>Because they didn't exist. This is a little weird but that's how it works. "Discovering" summoning methods it's something relatively new in Standard as you have seen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends Standard is the Pendulum Dimension, so all of their Pendulums might be just as strong, at least if we're to assume it's the Pendulum and it just took them forever to get their summoning method. <br><br>I mean the first guy that used Xyz in Heartland was bound to have just poofed them into existence like Yuya and then they proceeded to make them for Heartland too. <br><br>I'd imagine all the Pendulums are actually legit ones at least to some degree of Reiji's understanding of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His dad is the one who gave him the pendant that allowed pendulums to appear, but it's still unknown how directly involved he is with them, and what he's up to if he's even up to anything.</br>  <br><br>Yea but those had glitches and shit and couldn't output the same power as YUYA's cards or some shit. Meaning they're trying but haven't achieved it yet.<br><br><br><br>How did he just "make" cards? Is this some will of the cards magic bullshit?<br><br><br>Yea so basically these companies make cards and don't even know how they work? Like it's not ancient egyptian magic or anything so how the fuck were they not aware of pendulum summoning until Yuya "discovered" it?<br>Also was the Egyptian girl having a love affair with Sensei Marco? She's like obsessed or something.<br><br>Anw thanks for the answers guys, I'll keep watching to catch up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How did he just "make" cards? Is this some will of the cards magic bullshit? <br>Pretty much yes, we assume the pendulum he is wearing made them</br></br>  <br>Well Reiji/LDS figures out how to create them later, so don't worry about it, Yuya isn't a speshul snowflaek for long.</br>  <br>Or at least turning his regular cards into pendulum cards. We know that Odd-Eyes, Stargazer, and Timegazer all started out as regular monsters.</br>  <br>LDS figures out how to make them 'stable' or whatever, and the number of pendulum users grows beyond just Yuya and Reiji. And it's implied that everyone worldwide will be working at incorporating pendulums with their decks.</br>  Fuck this SHIBERUUUUUUU bullshit. Are retarded catchphrases popular in japan's youth?<br>That fat kid will grow up to be a pedophile. Just like Marco sensei.</br>  <br>Japan has shit taste, more news at 11.</br>  <br>Shun carding Shivers when?</br>  What kind of stories world tabloid magazines in the Yugivese print?  <br>Who the fuck is Jason and Nico?</br>  <br>Who the hell are Jason and Nico?</br>  <br>Nigga it's card game magic<br>That's pretty much all you need to know</br></br>  <br>I'm almost looking forward to seeing Academia invade Standard just because of the off chance that Shivers might get carded</br>  The definition of Duel is between 2 people.<br><br>Fuck you jap shits.</br></br>  <br> Jason and Nico <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>There's 2 people, 1 bird, and 1 mouse in that image</br>  <br> Shun Kurosaki  <br> on "I'd Fight 10 Men" <br> not on "Why Incest is A-OK" </br></br></br>  <br>No the kids will literally each face a Jobelisk Blue and beat them because next generation is always better or some dumb shit.<br><br>Didn't duels like this happen in DM or GX too?</br></br></br>  <br>Late reply but<br> A-Rank ZR </br></br>  <br> Didn't duels like this happen in DM or GX too? <br>On top of my head I remember the Umbra and Lumis one and the Tag Duels in GX.</br></br>  <br>*1 person, 1 bird, 1 mouse, and 1 furfag</br>  <br>Yea and it was bullshit then.<br><br>Call it a card war or battle. Just not a duel.<br><br><br>Yea he showed me how to fusion his dick with my vagina. Fuckin psycho bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, they call it a battle royale, even if they still shout DUEL! at the start.</br>  <br>WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS WITH SHUN KUROSAKI<br><br>LDS IS SUPREME<br><br>BUY WAR BONDS TODAY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Maybe some characters from another anime or the artists OC otp.</br></br></br>  <br>Well they do call it a Battle Royale mode. Duel is just a customary way of saying it, like Tag Duels.</br>   At least a month until the next Yuzu duel   <br> her duel happens entirely off-screen </br>  <br> &gt;At least a month until the next Sawatari duel </br>  <br><br> she will lose </br></br>  <br> Yuzu.wav intensifies </br>  <br>I'm still doubtful over info that comes from only a 2ch post. But it'll only take a month to see for sure, anyway.</br>  <br> 2ch post <br>Not once have those been right unless they have detailed summaries with writers and titles.<br><br>But V-Jump has confirmed that Yuzu is in the Cup, so it shouldn't be long before we see her duel.<br><br>Well, maybe. There's a fuckton of contestants, so they might pull that irritating off-screen duel shit they did with Sora.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's normally right if it gets reported on NAC. But the only NAC post is directing to the post from HERE. Anyone who actually believed that is an idiot.</br>  <br>Yuzu vs Selena when?</br>  <br>D-does that mean we can control Arc-V through recursive realities?<br><br>Ok! The next 87 episodes are slice of life romance with Yuya and Yuzu.</br></br></br>  <br>In Act 3, when Selena, Ruri, and Rin team up to try and stop Yuzu in a 3v1 because 3v1s always go so fucking well.</br>  <br> Arc-V will never have a SoL episode </br>  <br>Arc-V's last twelve episodes will be only SoL episodes.</br>  <br>Come to think of it they never really focused on Miami middle school did they? I remember the past series focused on the MC's school to an extent</br>  <br>Not on 5Ds, everybody was too poor for that</br>  <br>Didnt they show some content of Rua, Ruka and Aki's school?</br>  <br>There was like one episode that was more about Lucciano than the school life.</br>  <br>They focused on the duel schools instead of doing anything with their middle school, but even then only a little, and they were mostly just backdrops. It's probably why they never bothered showing Yuya or Yuzu in full uniform.</br>  <br>Actual education is not important</br>  <br>More like Serena/Yuzu vs. Braindwashed Ruri/Rin.<br><br> tfw all the Ruris use Fusion </br></br></br>  <br>True, they don't even teach kids how to read in the YGO universe.</br>  <br>THERE CAN BE ONLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY ONE</br>  <br>The most educational thing they taught the students in GX was fucking alchemy</br>  <br>Much like Crow,they learn it through card games because why not</br>  <br>The writing on the cards is too small to read anyway, which is why everybody forms a psychic connection with their deck.<br>How else can they play cards they've just drawn, before they even look at them?</br></br>  <br> mfw every time I try to think of a 'brainwashed Ruri' situation just to make Ruri an antagonist <br>Maybe if she and Rin were told why Academia needs to do what they're doing, but I doubt it. If Leo is anything like his son, he doesn't tell anyone anything.</br></br>  <br> Shun witnesses from the sidelines all the Ruri's using fusion <br> Has the biggest PTSD attack </br></br>  <br>When the fuck did half of them even go to class in GX anyways? <br><br>Leo turned Academia the fuck around.</br></br></br>  <br>If Reiji can fix the memories of Masumi and the gang, I'm sure Leo can do it as well. <br><br>Shun will get over it, hell he'd probably start using Fusion if Ruri told him to.</br></br></br>  <br>They were in class fairly often actually<br>They learned important pieces of information like "what is a Field spell card" and "if you use ring of destruction on a monster with 1800 attack, how many life points will you lose"</br></br>  <br>Blame dropout boy, he started the whole trend  na no ne </br>   brainwashed Ruri <br>Don't be so fucking daft. Shit's on a larger scale than brainwashing, we're talking about two Gods with their souls separated into four(probably five) different pieces.</br>  <br>Just because it's possible for Leo within the context of what kind of tech Academia must have, doesn't mean that the writers SHOULD go that route. It sounds dumb as hell.</br>  <br>I think it's also better for Leo to be straight up about his goals. <br><br>Thus far Leo hasn't lied to anyone about anything. He's been very straight forward.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun will get over it, hell he'd probably start using Fusion if Ruri told him to. <br><br>YUGO SHOUKAN!</br></br></br>  <br>Delete this</br>  huh, I just noticed something....yuzu uses 'real' fusion summoning, doesn't she?  <br>Would it be better if Ruri sold Xyz out and was evil in the first place? <br><br>Well she was taught by Sora and if Reiji's theory is true, then his power passed to her same as it did Yuya.</br></br></br>  <br>He'll sooner find a way to tune a Rank 2 Tuner XYZ monster with a Rank 4 Tuner XYZ monster.</br>  <br>yuya's using pendulum fusions though, he wasn't taught fusion summoning by sora.<br><br>but I was rewatching the videos, and she does the clasped hands thing that serena and sora do.</br></br></br>  SOUND DUEL 4 WHEN  <br> Would it be better if Ruri sold Xyz out and was evil in the first place? <br>No</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't that make a Synchro monster that's level 0?</br>  <br>Well Yuya is just getting after-effects. Sora personally taught Yuzu and gave her the same Polymerization card that Yuya used when he first Yugo'd. <br><br>I'd imagine it just depends on who is straight up teaching you. Shun teaching people would probably give them access to Rank Ups like Sora or Serena would give access to hand-claps.</br></br></br>  Remember that time Crow stole Yusei from Jack?  <br>I want fujos to leave</br>  <br> like Sora or Serena would give access to hand-claps <br> being taught Fusion gives you the claps </br></br>  <br>The only obstacle between Jack and Yusei was Bruno, and Bruno exploded</br>  <br>Me too</br>  <br>It also makes you a candy fiend.</br>  <br>This is Yu-Gi-Oh nigga, fujos eat this shit up.</br>  <br>Nah it would make a X-level 6 synchro, the newest hotness only available if you BUY RAIDRAPTORS</br>  <br> xyzsynchro </br>  <br>So fusion users are basically drug addicts with STDs?</br>  <br>Yes and diabetes, they need their sugar fix.</br>  I want to have sex with Kaiba's knee guards.    <br>Is that a D-gazer? We Zexal or what?</br>  <br>Yeah we've having Kaiba/Yugi vs. Evil Atem in Space with Saiyan Scouters.</br>  <br>Toon Dragon Master Knight when?</br>  <br>I'm moist just thinking about it.</br>  <br><br>Why does Kaiba look normal but Anzu look ayy?</br></br>  <br>Anzu looks pretty good though.</br>  <br>That's because she looks like a Ruri.</br>  <br>Because Anzu a shit and Kaiba is and will always be perfect even with lime green hair.</br>  <br>Ruri?</br>  <br>Has Shun ever said 'Yuzu' or 'Selena'?</br>  <br>No. Yuzu is Ruri #2 and Selena is Ruri #3 as far as he's concerned.</br>  <br>I thought it was:<br> Ruri <br> Strong Ruri <br> Angry Ruri <br> Wrench Ruri </br></br></br></br></br>  I fucking hate Yuzu<br> "Our competitor is Sakaki Yuya!" <br> "sakaki yuya...that could be yuya..." <br> literally show yuya <br> "maybe that's yuya" <br> yuya pendulum summons timegazer and stargazer <br> "HOLY SHIT IT'S YUYA!!!!" <br>I fucking HATE Yuzu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok</br>  <br>She was literally just Yuya.wav this whole episode</br>  <br> we've seen all other Ruris except for /the/ Ruri <br><br>Tell me /a/, why are they doing this?</br></br></br>  <br> She was literally just Yuya.wav <br>???????</br></br>  <br>She's the most annoying and useless character and she's part of the main cast, i fucking hate her</br>  <br>Because Ruri is kill, and Yuto couldn't just tell Shun.<br><br><br>Oh. Kay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up Dennis</br>  <br>Reiji, you're just mad that Yuya cares more about Yuzu than your shitty dimension war.</br>  <br>If Yuzu dies Yuya will end the war himself.<br>He'll just charge onto Academia's doorstep and tear the place apart with his bear hands</br></br>  <br> He'll just charge onto Academia's doorstep and tear the place apart with his bear hands <br><br><br>Prebear yourself for disappointment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As fucking if, he'll just go around yelling at people until they come up with ideas for him.</br>  <br>Shun will help, since that was his plan in the first place.</br>  <br> Implying the absolute rage, grief, and despair of Yuzu dying won't cause the darkness deep inside him to unleash itself and overwhelm Yuya, then proceeds to go on a dimensional rampage destroying everything in sight <br><br> Yeah if only ;_; </br></br></br>  Where do you guys get tips/strategies to make character decks? I want to build a decent Yugi and Yusei deck, obviously limiting it to a character deck won't make it competitive but I'd still like it to be fairly playable.  <br>Just look at what they play in the anime</br>  <br>Literally just take out any Synchron that's not Junk, Quickdraw, or Jet, put in some good traps, and you have a playable Yusei deck</br>  <br>Give up on Yugi, play Synchron mastrubation for Yusei. It's actually pretty decent now as a deck.</br>  <br>Ironically he assembled it from trash cards that suit him perfectly.</br>  <br> trash cards <br> Yusei </br></br>  <br><br>Different anon. What if I want to play a  Yuzu  or  Masumi  deck?</br></br>  <br>He literally found them in a trash heap.</br>  <br>His first instinct isn't to confide in others and use the power of friendship, it's going off on his lonesome</br>  <br>Melodius are a joke, Gem-Knights are slightly less of a joke but still bad. At least they're useable.</br>  <br><br>Research the deck. Pick a strategy and go with it. Consistency is better than using worthless cards.</br></br>  <br>Masumi is just a Gem-Knight deck</br>  <br>Melodious has an effective lock; not sure how it works but they have one.</br>  <br>Their lock is shit though and they have no win conditions.</br>  MORE PSYFRAMES<br><br>PSYFrame Lord Omega<br>Light Psychic / Synchro / Effect<br>LV8 2800/2200<br>1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters<br>(1) Once per turn, during either player’s Main Phase: You can select 1 random card from your opponent’s hand and banish both it and this card face-up until your next Standby Phase. (2) During your opponent’s Standby Phase: You can target 1 banished card; return it to the Graveyard. (3) If this card is in your Graveyard: You can target 1 other card in either Graveyard; shuffle both that card and this card into the Deck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares? This is an anime thread.</br>  Is Union a viable for fun deck nowadays?  <br>Union was never viable.</br>  <br>Fun is dead.</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>the wiki has lists of cards they used in the anime.<br><br>I prefer making decent archetype decks from the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> gem knights are less of a joke than melodious <br><br> their lock is shit and they hve no win conditions <br>few decks run an out to elegy+aria, and sonata, bloom diva, and schuberta are all win-cons aside from lock deckout.<br>please stop talking if you don't know the deck.<br> btw, 2-0'd this guy. and this was even before the fusions were released AKA th deck's wincons. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes because Yuzu yuses Solemn Warning and fucking Gagaga Gunman, of course, how could I forget.</br>  <br> Tomo <br>Opinion discarded.

You're not beating anyone but the worst shitters with Melodious.</br></br></br>  <br> from the anime </br>  <br>the fuck are gem knights going to do against shadolls?<br><br>oh yeah, lose almost immediately.<br><br>BA?<br><br>oops.<br><br>any deck that has ways to stop battle easily?<br><br>uh huh.<br><br>fucking melodious?<br><br>yeah, nah.<br><br><br>melodious have a damn good matchup against most decks, aside from monarchs, UA, qlips, nekroz, and, depending on draws and skill, satellars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gem-Knights can sack with OTKs. Melodius can create fragile locks that don't do anything, and then proceed to lose. <br><br>Melodius don't DO anything, writing them off as anti-meta when they have nothing going for them is ridiculous. If they really did have a good matchup against both Nekroz and Qli then they would see even a slight bit of play, but they don't because they're inconsistent and bad.</br></br></br>  <br> melodious have a damn good matchup against most decks <br><br>LOL<br><br>No they don't. They haven't appeared even a single time in a tourney tops. Hell they haven't appeared in a tourney period.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How bad are we talking?<br><br><br>I'm not the type to use stategies. I like to play for  fun .<br><br><br>Nothing unique to hers then?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This is a lot to take in.

I can't make a decent deck out of his cards? I'm fine if I have to include some staples in there to balance it out, but I still want the theme of the deck to resonate with his. Is there no decent recipe of his deck that's playable in meta right now?</br></br></br>  <br>Gem-Knights. It's sacky, fun, and actually does things. Try both decks out if you want.</br>  <br> Nothing unique to hers then? <br>Nope, just go on the wiki and it will show you all the cards she has played</br></br>  <br>yugi's entire deck revolves around heart of the cards. 90% of his deck is high level shit he can't easily summon, godawful s/t cards that are situational as FUCK, and other godawful monsters that are just bad.</br>  <br>Either one is good for casual play, don't listen to the shitheads that assume everyone is meta or nothing.</br>  <br>Yugi's cards are really, really bad. Closest thing to Yugi.dek that's actually playable is ignoring everything except the last duel and making it a pure Gadget deck. That alone should tell you how bad they are.</br>  <br> also, they've topped a couple events. <br><br>Let's see those reports, buddy. Take your time, I'll wait.</br></br></br>  <br>You could wait for the new BLS support and hope it's good.</br>  <br>I'm not saying melodious are meta, I'm just saying they have a good matchup against most meta (and even nekroz they don't AUTOLOSE against, like gem-knights would), and they're a fuckton better than gem-knights.<br><br>http://ygorganization.com/ocg-05032<wbr>015-ocg-japan-and-china-decklists/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>fuckkkkkk, what about making a Dark Magician themed deck?

Apart from hotglue turning from an in-joke into an actual thing here, people are pretty up front. If anything, James' bandwagoning is a blessing in disguise, because if anything, he's successfully made people buy Rin and Samurai which both skyrocketed on the aftermarket.</br>  <br>hotgluing has always been a thing</br>  Never buyfagged anything.

It was always a joke, "hehe your preowned fig is hotglued".</br>    <br>Because if you tell a febble mind something every single day they will start to believe it. Posting Pochaco in every thread is slowly going to start changing the minds of lessen men. But someone posting good figs, with good camera and lighting, can change the minds of people by showing actual quality. <br><br>But since buyfagging is expensive, people buy characters who they really love. So selling a foreign, good quality figure, every single day can get annoying to some people.</br></br></br>  <br>The colors are different, the poses are different, the facial expressions are different, the amount of love and care poured into the finished product are different, the release date is different, my opinions on each are different, your opinions on each are different.<br><br>One will come with free spider eggs in the box.</br></br></br>  <br>Alter fucked up on the bangs.

Another Anon convinced me into buying Phat's Yayoi, which apparently looks far better in real life. No bandwagoning necessary.<br><br>I don't know what to make of the Pochaco thing though. I wonder how Sonico fans feel. Seems like she's already been put aside for the latest trend. It's no worse than the "every day until..." posts. Reminds me of Native's Margit.</br></br></br></br>    Cheap bootlegs from china, is there a place I can see some examples? They always post a photo of the real figure instead of the bootleg they sell. Trying to figure out if it's really worth it.  <br>Remember last year? Sonico was pushed hard by Nitroplus and young buyfags. This year is Pochaco. Next year will be something even more ridiculous.<br><br>Sometimes people need to stop buying figs with their dicks.</br></br></br>  <br>It never is.<br>Just save up for the real thing.<br>Have a miku.</br></br></br>  <br>Bootlegs are only worth for spare parts for real figs. Never buy the bootleg. If you can't afford a real scales then this hobby isn't for you.</br>  <br>Is it just me or does her face not look right?</br>  <br>I only have Monkey now, the only other ones I really want right now are the fire sisters. Green or pink Tsukihi?</br>  <br>No shit Sherlock.</br>  <br>but what if the bootleg is better looking than the real fig?</br>  <br><br>Thanks for the quick reply</br></br>  <br> Finding other people's loads attractive <br>You are a fag.</br></br>  <br>It's just you.</br>  <br>There has only been one occasion where a bootleg, not a Garage Kit, has been better than the official one: Nendo Sakura Miku.<br><br>It was so good, that GSC's first All Japan-Made figure is a ripoff of the bootleg.

All prize figs cost around $15. Save that money for one good scale of AmiAmi of Manda. The satisfaction is incredible.</br>    <br> It was so good, that GSC's first All Japan-Made figure is a ripoff of the bootleg. <br>That's bullshit. The made-in-Japan version is nothing like the first Sakura version's bootleg.</br></br>   retard buys new unopened figure on Ebay. <br> files dispute and claim because he broke part of it after opening it. <br> chooses all 3 different dispute options that has nothing to do with the part they broke and wants a return. <br> makes me write an essay and provide pics just to show how retarded he is. <br> will probably be on the phone with ebay for half a day after they side with this retard buyer without reading my dispute.  <br><br>This is why you always need at least 6 pictures of your shipping process and delivery receipt and confirmation. Don't fuck around on Ebay if you don't want some autist to waste hours of your time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no gankyou fig <br>on a side note i copped a neato marii fig off  amazon </br></br>  <br>Forwarder is always okay if it's not banned from the site, and that's rather rare.</br>  <br> buying 3 crappy things instead of saving the same money and using it to buy 1 good thing <br><br>You need to start learning to properly manage your money now, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Make an account with 2you4 (the cheapest and best forwader, in my experience) and send them an email with your new Japanese address. The forward service is less than $2 per transcation, meaning as many figs as you can buy at once.</br>  <br>woop meant  ebay </br>  <br>This is the main reason why I prefer selling here.</br>  <br>Depends on the site. Can't hurt to try.</br>  <br>I hope they don't side with the buyer, Anon. What figure was it?</br>  Does anyone wanna buy a Levi or Armin nendoroid? <br>$40 shipped for each in the US</br>  <br>It's still a big "Fuck You" to china for ripping them off by recoloring the Miku nendo.

No one buys here. Offer something, you'll get a bunch of lowballing faggots. <br><br>Pass. I'm pretty sure if I state what figure it was it's pretty easy to tell who I am and some dickhead here will just do the same thing out of malice.<br><br>Paypal does the dispute settlements. Not ebay. It doesn't matter where you sell. The only viable option is gift payment only, and no one is stupid enough to do that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't sell very much, and I sell it around the price I bought it for. Nomally works.</br>  <br> Is this a joke? No one buys here. Offer something, you'll get a bunch of lowballing faggots. <br><br>I tried MFC a couple of time and it was not that bad.

Not all buyfags lurk daily.

Tons of anime and manga were inspired by it. The only reason the anime didn't sell well was &gt;Madhosue and the fact that they changed designs and the setting, which pissed off a lo of people. <br>Hell, the manga, which ended in 1995, was selling like crazy after the anime.

Reasons I could come up for these view counts:<br><br>Charlotte is Maeda who has very impressive reputation in Japan, obviously lot of people are watching this.<br>WORKING!! already has big fanbase, and as you can see it also gets high ratings by the audience. See <br>GATE I really can't explain, maybe the LN is popular or the whole military setting is making lot of people curious.<br>Classroom Crisis has staff with generally with good reputation and is getting Igarashi episode next, so the view count is hardly surprising.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like that top ten except for WORKING!!! and Classroom crisis<br><br>Working would be nicer if anything ever happened, you can literally watch the episodes out of order and still not miss anything.<br><br>Classroom crisis was retarded<br> Guy is being held for a ransom of 7 million <br> Lets blow 500 billion yen and a robot it took us years to build while trying to save him even though he had everything under control </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point of CC, the teacher is hopeless and Nagisa as their boss isn't going to take any of that shit anymore.</br>  <br>Guys, only children watch Anime in Japan</br>  <br>Im not going to take any of that shit anymore either</br>  This is some good taste though.<br>The top ten is spot-on solid.</br>  <br>Everything about this post is correct and it makes me sad.</br>  <br>I mean, you'd think that it'd be more popular *because* it's shit.
