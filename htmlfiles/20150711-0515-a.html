Because it's a video game and, rather than making it pay2win, they relied heavily on RNG . But I like to think it's because the abyssals live underwater and move around the area so who knows where they are, might as well spin the compass.

Can't wait when they get their kai ni.  <br>Fusou is the slightly stronger one.</br>  <br>I was looking for the source of this image for ages, thanks a lot anon</br>  Welcome to the CG era, the future of anime, Miyazaki-san<br>http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASH7B<wbr>5RS5H7BUCVL01G.html</wbr></br>  Translate weebs.  <br>10min CG short movie but I think it will take 3 years to make, Miyazaki coming out of retirement and wants a new challenge. Google translate is your friend.</br>  There is no god.  <br>Miyazaki retiring is always a joke</br>   It'll be about 10 minutes long, but Suzuki expects that production could take up to 3 years.  <br> production could take up to 3 years <br><br>It will never come out, then.</br></br></br>  <br> Miyazaki coming out of retirement <br>Where are the japanese trucks when you need them?</br></br>  <br>Why does Miyazaki keep pretending like hes retiring</br>  <br>He thinks its hilarious</br>   CG <br>For what purpose?</br>  <br>He's tsun as fuck.<br> "I was merely pretending to be retired the whole time!" </br></br>  <br>My grandfather is the same way.</br>  <br>They preferentially feed on little girls.</br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>To show the youngsters how an old master can use even the crummiest tool to create a work of art.<br><br>his way of saying<br> step up, kohai </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think at that age, you may sometimes start feeling like you might kick the bucket soon so it's like a precaution.</br>  <br>Why must Japanese CG be so awful</br>  <br>Anime was a mistake</br>  <br>most studios don't have pixar's budget, technology pipeline or experience.</br>  <br>Also Japanese PCs are generally toasters or potatoes.</br>  <br>Etotama was really good though.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they can afford at least a few decent ones for a rendering farm. It's not like you need realtime, full quality rendering on every animator's workstation.</br>  Remember the last time a Miyazaki and CG mixed?  <br>maybe his dad was disappointed</br>  <br><br>Why did she just sit there for like 2 minutes after hearing the truck? is she part deer?</br></br>  <br>Same reason mami got chomped</br>  <br>And then, there is ufotable</br>  <br>I didn't know he's still alive.</br>  <br>Then how did Shirogumi do it?</br>  <br>1. Very short sequences<br>2. They chose a style that wasn't too human anymore to avoid the uncanny valley.</br></br>  <br>And lots of closeups and playing with speed so they have to animate less actual motion. Of course regular animation uses those kinds of tricks too.</br>  <br>That looks good though? Fucking autist.</br>    <br>Anime was a mistake.</br>  <br>Arpeggio was fine too.</br>  <br>Why does he always carry his Academy Award with him everywhere?</br>  <br>It's his only friend.</br>  <br>Are you implying that Sidonia didn't look awful?</br>  <br>Not knowing Arpeggio of Blue Steel was CG, I initially didn't even notice. In stills (and admit it, a lot of anime is panning stills with moving lips) I downright couldn't tell. Motion is still where CG gives itself away.<br><br> pic related <br> i wish anime always looked this awesome </br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyazaki has already used tons of CGI. He only started to hate it when it became an awful budget saving tool.</br>  <br> Not knowing Arpeggio of Blue Steel was CG, I initially didn't even notice. </br>  <br>Season 2 looked fine, the animation could be better but the chars were nicely done.</br>  <br>You will never use the world's most powerful commercially available computer to create the world's first movie with digitally created sequences.<br><br>And then be denied the Academy Award for Special Effects because using a computer is cheating.</br></br></br>  <br>Really dude? They were stiff as fuck. I love Sidonia, I really do but that shit never looked close to good outside some of the mech stuff.</br>  <br>I liked the CG in Sidonia. Not perfect, but not horrible.</br>  <br>As long as they go with plain colours you can mostly ignore the 90s style animation and the jarring cell-shaded shadows. But, God, anything textured is awful.</br>  <br>Tron got fucked. Did Terminator 2 ever win any awards? The T-1000 still looks incredible.<br><br>Sidonia exposed the other problem with CG anime, they reuse assets everywhere.</br></br></br>  CG:<br><br>Etotama &gt; Arpeggio &gt; Precure etc &gt; shit &gt; Sidonia</br></br>  If all CGI was Etotama style no one would have a problem with it.  <br><br>It's an internal conflict between the human being's desire to retire with the Japanese male's insect-like mentality as far as work is concerned. What we see as a result of this is a hive of depressed salary men who dream of retirement but work until death.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the animation was bad, and I was mad about that all time (especially the first season).<br><br>But I liked the characters design, it's hard to make these face expressions while trying to look 2d at the same time.</br></br></br>  CG will only get better. It is the future.  <br>I never asked for this future.</br>  <br>I don't know how but they made that scene sillier.</br>  <br> And then, there is ufotable <br><br>fuck off with this shitty meme fatefag<br><br>ufotable has just as many quality moments as any other decent studio like madhouse</br></br></br></br></br>  Sidonia's CG made the scifi/mech action visceral and and intense. It was a great fit for a fully CG attempt.  <br>That still looks like a cutscene from a PS3 game. I'm not even a purist who hates 3D period, there's a lot of pretty great western 3D animation, but Japan just can't into 3D at all. They need to stop, it's getting embarassing.</br>  <br>You cannot stop the future.</br>  <br>I sure loved how they animated the Type 19. Wait, never mind.</br>  <br>It's not that Japan can't. It's that anime can't, cause no show is popular enough to justify the needed budget.</br>  <br> Very short sequences <br>The last episode is almost entirely CG and it's fantastic.</br></br>   Miyazaki should to put that Oscar into the frozentards` asses, one by one.  <br>Terminator 2 won:<br>Academy Award for Best Visual Effects<br>Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing<br>Academy Award for Best Sound Editing<br>Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, at least one pioneer of CG in cinema got the recognition it deserved. Shame so much modern CG looks so much worse.</br>  <br>That's Miyazaki-sama for you.</br>  <br>But computers are cheating because they do all the work for you :^)</br>  <br>Don't use emoticons on /a/.</br>  <br>This is a joke that seems to have passed you by.</br>  <br>Don't use emoticons on /a/, period.</br>  <br>Sorry for breaking your rules anon  :^) </br>  <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br> Not knowing Arpeggio of Blue Steel was CG, I initially didn't even notice. <br>nigger, you blind?</br></br>  <br>Stick your dick in a beehive.</br>  New material for the movie: Hinata and Himawari's sketches.  <br>Why the fuck does Hinata look younger</br>  <br>Aging is for commoners and lesser bloodlines.<br><br>Here's Salad's design with an ass shot just for you, /a/.</br></br></br>  Sunflower's got a decent range of emotions. Bottom right probably occurs after the cake smash.  Lee's facial aesthetics have improved.  <br>Hinata got some Uzumaki in her so she gets a piece of that expanded life span.</br>  I kinda liked Tenten's old hair better.  fuck off  Mitsuki's evil, right?  Dadruto in full Hokage gear.  Shikamaru's got his wedding ring on a necklace.  <br>Shut up.</br>  Shikadai's the tallest of the kids and also clearly doesn't want to deal with any of this bullshit.  <br>To be fair The Last Hiashi looked younger than he did in the Exam period.</br>  <br>Milfnata got taller.</br>  <br><br><br>They look a good ten years younger than in chapter 700.<br>Naruto's Gaiden design looks much physically larger, more like a proper authority figure and appropriately so. <br>The fuck is SP doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  Nyaa isn't really giving great results, is the last BD out yet?  Post Sakura OP.  <br> skirt <br> stockings <br>  adorable <br><br>new best girl coming through</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From the trailer and  she seems to look basically the same as in The Last.</br>  <br> Had a one-way crush on Naruto when she was young, but now that has transformed into deep, romantic love.  <br> After she built a family, that love reaches out to other family members as well. <br> She fully trusts her husband who‘s often upset and cannot come home <br> But, she feels sad and worried about the rigid relationship between Boruto and Naruto, Boruto who's so stubborn and Naruto who often cannot come home. U cannot see that shy expression on her face anymore. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Boruto<br> Confident and arrogant, he easily clashes with the people around him <br> But towards his sister Himawari he is quite the gentle brother. </br></br></br></br>  <br> New character for the New era. <br> Unlike Boruto and Sarada, he doesn't show his emotions much. <br> He is always using the perspective of an adult to judge Boruto and Sarada's actions. <br> Just like Bolt and Sarada, he has great parents. <br> But who are his parents, even Boruto and Sarada doesn't know. <br>Has stretchable arms.<br> When he smiles his eyes will turn to the shape of the crescent moon. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks pretty good.</br>  <br> Ninja world's hero. <br> Used to be a mischievious kid, now he has become the hokage who protects the village. <br> Felt like there is a heavy gap between his generation and the new era. <br> Keeps thinking on how to pass down 'what is the most important thing to everyone' to the next generation. <br> While this is a good intention, he couldn't even get along with his son Boruto. <br> Is constantly feeling troubled by this. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just wanted to see if the bottom part of her outfit was different.<br><br>Don't know why Kishi took away her spats.</br></br></br>  <br> She helps her mom around the house despite her young age and is the opposite of a troublemaker. It mentions that Boruto is very protective of her, and she of him. It also mentions she tries not to trouble her regularly absent father and does her best to be patient. </br>  <br>Why the fuck is he wearing a onesie?</br>  Sakura<br><br> In the manga she became a good and frank mother - and even though her husband almost never comes back to the family, she's building up an open and sincere relationship with her daughter Sarada <br><br> Sakura's full body. A bold/aggressive fashion, showing her belly-button. If you look at the Uchiha crest on her back, you are filled with a deep emotion. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Otsutsuki blood, I ain't gotta explain shit.</br>   Naruto's biggest rival but also best friend. A boy who only saw revenge in the past, but has now become an adult that jokes with his friend. Sasuke seldomly returns to the village, but he does this to protect Konoha from possible/impending dangers. In the movie, he became Boruto's master. Sasuke believes that no matter what era it is/how time passes, the nature of ninja will not change. He is on par with Naruto. Using his left rinnegan and right m.sharingan, he fights with the two strongest genjutsu.   <br> Then he kills the cake. </br>  <br><br>Good, Bolt really needed a soft spot.<br><br>I thought the source of the whole butthurt on Bolt's part that they were really tight before Naruto became Hokage and suddenly couldn't spend as much time with his family as before? Certainly the end of The Last seemed to show that.<br>If the generational split is more general than just with his son, something not shown in the Gaiden, it would take quite a bit away from the whole dynamic of the movie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they were really tight before Naruto became Hokage and suddenly couldn't spend as much time with his family as before <br><br>That got retconned in the gaiden. Now Naruto has been hokage since Sarada was at least 3.</br></br></br>  <br>the issue is probably that the nations are united and that the older generation grew up with war and some shady ninja shenanigans, while the new generation lives a peaceful life</br>  <br> That got retconned in the gaiden. Now Naruto has been hokage since Sarada was at least 3. <br>Where is that stated?</br></br>  <br>if you are talking about the flashback where sasuke says he's going after kaguya, that happened a couple of months after gaiden<br><br>naruto has only been hokage for a couple of years</br></br></br>  <br> even though her husband almost never comes back to the family <br>Sauce the same as always<br><br> If you look at the Uchiha crest on her back, you are filled with a deep emotion <br>who wrote these, Kishi? sure, deep emotion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He has only recently been inaugurated in chapter 700, which seems a year or two before Gainden at most.</br></br>  <br> She helps her mom around the house despite her young age and is the opposite of a troublemaker. It mentions that Boruto is very protective of her, and she of him. It also mentions she tries not to trouble her regularly absent father and does her best to be patient. <br><br>She's seriously primed to take over as Best Girl for this generation.</br></br></br>  <br>Then how come Sasuke has time to go to the village to visit his fuckbuddy and his wife but not his 8 year old daughter?</br>  <br>You know why.</br>  <br/>  <br>He is a bad person. The manga should have clued you in on that.<br>It is far more simple to accept the fact that he doesn't really care to spend time with his family and be back on his edgy road trip asap like he did at the end of Gaiden, than to assume a whole character dynamic at the heart of the movie was retconned.</br></br>  <br> He is a bad person. The manga should have clued you in on that. <br>I know that, but it's hard to accept it when the MC keeps telling me he's the most awesome person that has ever existed.</br></br>  <br>you'd do the same if you were married to sakura</br>  <br>Naruto's gauge for that isn't exactly calibrated well.</br>  <br>Ninja anon.Not person.</br>  <br>He is the first person the MC's age he ever made a real bond with, after spending the first 12 years of his life feared and shunned by all adults around him and none of the other kids knowing why the adults fear him and keeping their distance too.<br>He's hardly objective on the topic. Shame he was not teamed up with better people than with whom he was (anyone, anyone else from that generation), but that is how things ended up.</br></br>  So will the movie confirmed whether Lee and 10/10 got together? Seems weird to show them both in the sketches without their being a something between them.  <br> He is on par with Naruto <br><br>So one armed Sasuke = endgame Naruto with two arms?</br></br></br>  <br>R.I.P. milfnatatatas</br>  <br>why is he so smug</br>  <br>They're ninja now.</br>  <br>He probably pulls a Susanoo arm like in UNS. Also he good powers comes from eyes anyways</br>  <br>His parents are Shikamaru and Temari. You'd be smug too.</br>  <br>She is really good at hiding her assets.</br>  <br>Naruto is probably stronger than Sasuke's right now, but Sasu could be closely that gap quickly with him actually practicing shit whereas Naruto is just doing paper work.</br>  <br>laighed way too hard at this post.</br>  I want Taka to have a cameo just to see Karin animated in her new outfit, she's really /fa/.  <br>Well, at least it isn't the generic housewife outfit.</br>  <br>he doesn't even need them that much anyway. One arm is more than enough.</br>  <br>hinata is the epitome of comfyness</br>  <br>She's also the softest<br><br>All the other girls are /fit/...Ino, 1010, Temari, hell even Sakura, but Hinata is nice and soft.</br></br></br>  Naruto: 180 cm (5”10)<br>Hinata: 163 cm (5"4)<br>Himawari: 138 cm (4"6)<br>Boruto: 145 cm(4"9)<br>Sasuke: 182 cm (5”11)<br>Sarada: 147 cm (4”9)<br>Mitsuki: 149 cm (4”10)<br>Shikamaru: 176-177 cm (5”9)<br>Shikadai: 154-155 cm (5")<br>Sai: 176 cm (5”9) <br>Inojin: 147 cm (4”9)<br>TenTen: 166 cm (5”5)<br>Rock Lee: 179 cm (5”10)<br>Momoshiki: 176 cm (5"9)<br>Kinshiki:231 cm (7"6)<br><br>Apparently, nobody grew since The Last<br><br>Also, Bort is a manlet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino seems fairly soft in some scenes. Not as soft as Hinata or Tsunade (her young form anyway) by any means, but there's some softness in there, dressed up in a 'fuck me' outfit.<br>Mei (or whatever the redhead Mizukage with the two blood limits was called) kinda qualifies too.</br></br>  <br>they didn't get together, Tenten is not part of metal lee's family tree</br>  <br>Same as his father, eating junk food all the time, without even the excuse of being a malnourished orphan.<br>Do we know if Minato was a manlet at that age?</br></br>  <br>Ino is so best girl is fucking hurts. She is everything perfecf rolled into a sexy package.</br>  <br>She looks better with the generic Konoha vest than with that prostitute outfit.</br>  <br>Tsunade and Mei don't really count. Christmas Cakes are soft by definition.</br>  <br>Yeah....Ino's biggest problem is her shippiden and the last outfits sucked ass. She was lovely in her vest outfit, or the orange shirt. Her RTN outfit was cute.</br>  <br>Second best, tied with 10/10. <br>Both are good waifu material, though (for this series' standards) unlike Hinata who has a case of single target sexuality and I would not have it any other way.<br><br>Well, there's that blonde chick that either Bee or Darui allegedly fucked. She seemed pretty damn soft too.<br>As did Kaguya, come to think about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anybody else really fucking excited for the special episodes that will come out before the movie? Because I am.  <br>Kaguya had the secret Hyuga shrinking technique.We can't know how big they are.Unless you go by that Kaguyafag's art.</br>  <br>I wonder what that's going to be about.<br><br>I'm mildly curious about the Hokage oneshot</br></br></br>  <br>dad is Netori-san confirmed</br>  <br><br>I'm personally wondering how Bolt is supposed to amount to anything. Like, the problem with any story is that it comes with the caveat "Naruto and Sasuke are on hand to solve the problem. One is Jesus, and the other is also Jesus. Together, they are DOUBLE JESUS."<br><br>How the fuck could you compete with that? Every story about Bolt would either be a not-so-significant threat ("Dad has to have the planet-shattering punch up with the god-beast now. Bolt, uh, take the guy with the sword. You kids play nice now!") or find a way to nerf Naruto and Sasuke so they can't actually get involved.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Move over salad we got a new best girl here</br></br>  is the Last movie out with decent sound and not cancer subs?  <br>Then why the yellow eyes and the stretching powers?</br>  <br>The last one was pretty damn good, it does raise my expectation levels.<br> adorable sisters <br> good animation and fight scenes <br> the whole Hyuuga clan being based as fuck, retelling the events of pein's attack to the clan head in a completely objective and unbiased manner <br> Ino being fucking cute as she explains Naruto's Rasenshuriken to Hinata and Neji <br> Hinata shown as growing, earning her clansmen's respect and taking charge of who she is, her little sister finding confidence in her once again <br>Bolt's one could have some good stuff too. By the title I am presuming it is Naruto teaching him the Rasengan, either before he became the Hokage or shortly after, though it could be a lot of things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we don't know the mother</br>  <br>He fucked Orochimaru in a female host.</br>  <br>That ass.</br>  <br>salad is used goods now</br>    <br><br>So why exactly don't we have a manga/anime about her?</br></br>  <br>sp may do something, kishi is a lost cause</br>  <br>Kishi don't give a shit about anyone who isn't Naruto or an Uchiha.</br>  <br>Kishi isn't giving spin-off licenses  for now. </br>  <br><br><br>Himawari gets all this fanart yet we haven't seen a single thing out of her, for all we know she could turn out to be shit like most of Kishi's female characters tend to go.<br><br>People just go with "Naruto's cute daughteru" and slap on whatever personality they see fit.</br></br></br></br></br>    http://marumaru.in/b/mangaup/93615   they fucking swapped underwear <br>Oh boy</br>   gook   <br> http://marumaru.in/b/mangaup/93615<wbr></wbr> <br>Is there just one page?</br></br>  <br><br>This is the link, you should just click bellow the image:<br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>464442</wbr></br></br></br>  who the hell watches this  <br>Oh yeah my fault I forgot that some people probably never used that site and I should of gave the link to the whole chapter instead. But thanks I'll remember next time</br>  What a bunch of crap, she went back to being a beta bitch in less than 2 panels.  <br>Nobody yet the anime is airing to night</br>  I want a misandrist to choke me with her legs  That panties/boxers swap... hnnnnnnnngggggggg<br><br>Hahaha chios' gonna think they were kiyoshis' panties... will probably think he's a crossdresser because of the school uniform thing before</br></br>  <br><br>No worries just tell us what's the text here.<br>As for anime it should be in 3 hours from now.</br></br></br>   Chaiman runs into a forest <br>   It's the same one he lost himself in at the beginning<br/> <br>Ayyyyyyy</br></br>  It says in less than 3 hrs<br>www.livechart.me/summer-2015/tv</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Unfortunately this defuses the potential bomb of Chiyo recognizing Hana's panties.</br></br></br>  <br> The old VP is back <br>I haven't been keeping up but this can only be a good thing. Unless it means less Mari lewdness, which is entirely possible.</br></br>  I just don't like this manga, I don't know why<br>It was decent for the fist 3 volumes but then turned into lewd shit</br>  <br>VP reverted back to Moeiko. It was only temporary and i don't speak Korean so i have no idea what's going on.</br>  <br> those hips  <br> them thighs </br></br>  <br>I hope she'll choke Kate with these legs. And that they'll make out in front of everyone.</br>  <br>I'm conflicted. I want more shenanigans to ensure if they try to exchange them back, but I also want Hana to insist on keeping his boxers.</br>  <br> prison school chapter 183 <br><br>definitively more shenanigans PLIZ<br><br>Also: some korean bro dropping by to tell us if end page says another pause or not?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they won't come in each others underwear before the swap back </br>  <br>Hana is gonna cum in his boxers during the cavalry battle.<br><br>The Medusa will drool.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is this manga suppose to be about anyway? The pages I see posted just implies it's a manga about people getting raped.</br>  <br>Mari won't do lewd things unless it's necessary</br>  <br>There has been no sexual intercourse yet.<br><br>I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Hana x Kiyoshi.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good thing. Moeiko is best.</br>  Oh boy, if they don't swap undergarments in the next few chapters, Kiyoshi will 100% be derobe'd in the battle.  <br>Basically 5 nigga ends up going to a previous all girls school and crazy shit ensues. And really glasses and MC are the only true bros the rest are kinda bitch nigga (well hood is between). And yeah no sex at all but Hana and the MC has a great thing going on since like chapter two or three, and it could get even better as long as that one bitch doesn't join in</br>  <br>Oh okay thanks for taking the time to explain it to me. Appreciate it.</br>  ok, ok, first things first. last page, is there a break next week or not?  <br>Because fucking Kate was really necessary? She could just have make out with her, and not putting her tongue between her legs.</br>  <br>It's not good leverage unless she's fucking her properly.</br>  <br>Or he could just dump the panties and freeball in the battle</br>  <br><br>THIS</br></br>  Here's what I'd do if I was Kate and lost the cavalry battle. I'd announce to all school that I was in love with Mari and that's why I treated her better in prison than she treated the former prisoners -which is true-. Then, she seduced me, said she loved me and I was happy. Then I found out she cheated on me. With a boy no less. I show the pictures of ouroboros between mari and kiyoshi. If mari reveals our 69 too, it's all "you not only cheated on me, you filmed it without me knowing too?"<br>Iirc school code forbids lewd relationships between the sexes, not between girls.<br>And again, does someone know if there's a break next week?</br></br>  Still not over Mari eating Kate's pussy just to blackmail her with that.  <br>Don't be surprised, mari has done much worse to people who did much less than kate.<br>Once a cunt, always a cunt.</br></br>  <br>Basically, these five guys go to an all-girls school that's going co-ed. The student council there doesn't like men, so at the first sight of them doing something bad, they send them to this prison set up on school. So now the five guys have to get out while enduring the torture the girls give them.</br>  <br>summoning koreabro</br>  <br>Someone dump the pages.</br>   mfw she will keep the panties and masturbate with them after she gets them back   <br>Righto clicku not arrowed. So i had to manually snippet everything.<br><br>I probably didn't capture every page perfectly, but it's good enough for ghetto translation work. Commencing dump for Koreanbro. Someone sacrifice a Tumblrina to appease his Korean bloodlust.</br></br></br>  <br>2 of 18</br>  <br>Reminder!</br>  <br>3 of 18</br>  <br>W H Y<br>H<br>Y</br></br></br>  <br>4 of 18</br>  <br>5 of 18<br><br><br>It takes a lot of energy to hold her final form.</br></br></br></br>  <br>6 of 18</br>  <br><br>yeah, it's not like they trained her for four whole months or anything</br></br>  <br>7 of 9  :^) </br>  <br>8 of 18<br><br><br>I don't remember Moeiko receiving any training. This is the first time they're attempting to revive the VP because her picture doesn't work on Andre anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Almost.</br>   You will never run a train on Marie.   <br>9 of 18<br><br><br>Don't worry, Risa is going to get her pet stolen.

Where did you get them?</br></br></br>  <br>So is the VP back or not. From the links it looks like she went back into childhood mode.</br>  <br>17 of 18</br>  <br> Hana: give me back my panties! <br> MC: but i used them, isnt it better to trash them? <br> Hana: NO, ITS NOT LIKE I HAVE UNLIMITED UNDERWEAR <br> MC: sigh okay, you cant trash my underwear  <br><br> hana goes home and masturbates furiously in the next chapter </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  dem eyes <br><br>You can almost feel the Horror leaking through the page..</br></br></br>  <br>18 of 18</br>  <br>She hasn't fully turned yet, but obviously is triggered when Mari is messed with. So most likely will happen during the battle when they clash.</br>  <br>And that's it. It's all yours from here Koreanbro. This is all i can do.<br><br><br>Super Saiyan Dominatrix.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see it now<br> andre about to steamroll prez <br> VP goes back to S mode and smacks his shit </br></br></br>  Does this mean when they go to make the switch chiyo will see kiyoshi giving hana gakuto's panties?  <br> Andrenomics proven viable </br>  <br>Hana is too innocent to know how to masturbate<br>But<br>I like the idea of her FURIOUSLY masturbating</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit.<br><br>It's happening</br></br></br>  <br>Oh Jesus fucking Christ it just gets worse and worse.</br>  <br> about to <br> not mauling her for a whole chapter <br>come on, let me have some fun<br><br><br>koreanbro, if you arrive, let us know if there's a break next week</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that''s disappointing. Really wanted VP to return back to normal. Her kid mode has been going on for too long.</br>  <br>Maybe before, but clearly mari's actions violated her once pure mind.</br>  <br>is it just me or the art seems shitty<br>is he rushing it</br></br>  <br>Word is, he's working on Me And The Devil Blues again</br>  <br><br> Someone sacrifice a Tumblrina to appease his Korean bloodlust. <br><br>Consider me appeased.<br><br> Right... Right now, that whipping ability... <br><br> That unforgiving thigh pressure...  <br><br> She's back... <br><br> The vice-president has come back to normal!? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Carrier has arrived </br>  <br>Oh yes.<br>please, seriously, is there anything about a break next week at the end?</br></br>  <br>Here we go.</br>   Wearing each others underwear <br><br>These two are fused in every way possible.</br></br>  <br>Again?!</br>  <br>THE SACRIFICE WORKED<br><br>PRAISE THE KOREAN BLOOD GOD</br></br></br>  <br>you da man</br>  <br> 'Tis the Revival <br><br> Of F!!

It ends with Kiyoshi falling out of the tree.</br>  I'm not watching the show but by screenshots alone whoever had the idea behind these colors should feel bad.  <br> Did we mistake it recently whilst our minds were numb with shock... <br><br> Kiyoshi's Hana's Panties! <br><br>And finished.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*bad</br>  Wow, that was some fast ass pacing.

Pacing is too fast    <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;5  chapters in 1 episode<br>I hope they don't skip too much of Kiyoshi's &amp; Hana's Shenanigans.</br></br>  <br><br>Another great transition here.</br></br>  Lol, they associated Leilei with Rei.

Chairman!</br></br>    why does hana pee so much, like a gallon at a time.  <br> It feels more like they were in a rush to get to the shenanigans in the first place. <br>I mean ALL their Shenanigans, with good pacing.</br></br>  <br>She pees very rarely. She saves it so she can unleash on Kiyoshi at a moment's notice.</br>  Why does it look like they used the burn and dodge tools for the shading in almost every frame?  <br>She literally pisses tea she drinks so much of it. Shes a glorious lipton fountain.</br>  Going by the screens the art is really inconsistent and the color choices are odd.  <br>Leilei who and Rei who?</br>  <br>But she already has a pair of his that's worn so why not come up with a reason to keep his</br>  If we are to believe they will end when the boys are released there would have to be 16 episodes assuming they continue doing 5 chapters an episode.  <br>They zoomed in on her in a shot of the Gate animu and said she looked like 'that girl from Evangelion'.<br><br>And indeed she did.</br></br></br>  <br>That sorcerer bitch from Gate and Rei Ayanami, you know, teh Rei.</br>  <br>Indeed she does.</br>  <br>I just thought that they where just gonna do the 1st escape attempt, but after seeing this much pacing in just 1 episode that will probably happen, adn if so, it will feel too rushed, even the 1st episode already seemed rushed.</br>  So wait the sub episode already aired?  <br>yes</br>  <br>Read the first 5 chapters again, the pacing isnt far off from the manga, its actually pretty fucking damn faithful.</br>  <br>Thank you, man. I couldn't live without you.

Oda only wanted Nami to look like a slut..</br></br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br>She had them since Skypia though.

Really?</br>  <br> to look like a slut <br> look <br><br>Nami is a slut. It's one of the few cases in anime when you can't call her a slut to just to insult her, that's exactly what she is.<br><br>Nami doesn't feel romantic love for anyone, she would sell her body to fat old men just to have some money</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*reason</br>  <br>Nice head canon you got there.</br>  <br><br>You shouldnt use the figurine as a critique of her design<br><br> 0 gravity tits <br> 0 gravity neck </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She flashed people for money and as a kid offered to pay for things with her body. That's pretty slutty.</br>  <br>Those pirates who took on Arlong Park?<br>A bunch of kids. Kid's with promise but kids all the same.<br><br>The pirates who left Sabaody and took on the New Fishmen Pirates? A crew fit for the Pirate King. Designs that imply determination and confidence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is supposed to be on a journey from an ordinary boy to a pirate. So along the course of the series, his clothes will become more and more piratey. Longer jacket, sash, pants, boots, tricorn hat, and probably, by the end of the series, the famed eyepatch.<br>On pic related you can clearly see Oda wasn't quite sure at first of exactly how much more piratey Luffy should be after the timeskip. He made multiple variations and settled for the tamest one.</br></br>  <br> Implying any redesign happens for any reason other than to sell more merchandise </br>  <br>Here. The tits are literally the same size.</br>  <br>Entities which lurked the Florian Triangle long before Moriah arrived, and were the cause of the ships disappearing within. Whatever they are, they absolutely dwarf the likes of Oars/Sanjuan Wolf, as well as Thriller Bark itself which is probably similar size to Dressrosa.</br>  <br>my brain. it hurts.<br><br>how can anyone that has followed One Piece this far be so fucking dense??<br><br>Awesome  gets it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We saw Bonney just before Dressrosa started, eating pizza and reading the newspaper about Law and Luffy's alliance.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127869131 <br>long hair makes every woman a lot prettier</br>  <br>That's neat, I like it. I hope by the end of the journey he'll get a coat to, in strong world was amazing</br>  <br>To slowly weaken Blackbeard's forces from the inside, or use Blackbeard's additional force to make his task of taking out the remaining 6th level prisoners in the world somewhat easier.</br>  <br> post-skip Namis tits are a lot bigger than pre-skip <br>Another myth busted, nice</br></br>  So Im on episode 7, when does this show start to get better? This begging is weak, but there have been cool moments.  <br>My favourite was "Why doesn't Zoro smile anymore?!"</br>  <br>A few arcs in.<br><br>Some will say during Kuro, some will say during Baratie. If your not in by the end of Arlong Park then you wont be at all</br></br></br>  <br>People who hate on post-ts Nami are mostly tumblrinas who hate the fact that her outfit is more revealing because of muh sexism</br>  <br>After the dressrosa arc</br>  <br>Read it.</br>  <br>Stop watching the anime and read the manga, its for your own good</br>  <br><br>Why lads?</br></br>  <br> back facing one of Luffy <br> it's the pirate symbol he drew for the flag <br>I hope he has that shirt lying around.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda isn't exactly consistent when it comes to breast size.</br>  <br>Fight me irl faggot</br>  <br>Around episode 300 the pacing gets utterly horrible and a bit later the drawings and animation are extremely low budget most of the time</br>  <br>Quality's better, less filler and around episode 300-400 the pacing drops to the floor.<br>It's basically a slideshow now.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OF0<wbr>MZ6FH67g</wbr>  [ ]<br>Shouldn't be many spoilers (if at all).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The manga is the original material, you dont have to put up with shit animation, shit art and filler.<br><br>Same reason in you wanted to judge a sng you'd listen to the original version, not a version produced by underpaid sweatshop animators.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook has actually been useful in every arc since he joined. It was just not as spectacular as some stuff other chracters did.</br>  <br>I want more badass Brook moments</br>  <br>You can read the first 700 chapters in glorious color on Batoto</br>  <br><br>But the anime has a God Tier OST<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sYK<wbr>owP0WEIc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then listen to it while reading the manga.</br>  <br>Already complaining 7 eps in? You should be hooked by now.</br>  <br>He still gets them some times. More for sure though.</br>  <br><br>Well get used to it because you're going to hear a lot of it while background characters gasp and tremble for 5 seconds to every line from the manga</br></br>  <br>Its okay I guess, Luffy is a mad cunt which regularly destroys my sides.</br>  why doesn't his power also knock out all his opponents? wouldn't his fruit technically slow all blood circulation?  <br>Have you encountered our Lord and Saviour Buggy-sama yet?</br>  <br> Luffy is a mad cunt <br><br>You don't even know.</br></br></br>  <br>Magic nigga.<br>How is Luffy alive when he's made of rubber?</br></br>  <br>Buggy just got rekt for fucking with the hat, also a side terminator.</br>  <br>Zoro's dimple is so kawaii</br>  <br> no captain's coat for Luffy post TS <br>That bummed me out a little.</br></br>  So by know we've all realized that Kaido isn't human<br>What animal is he and what fruit does he have?</br>  <br> What animal is he and what fruit does he have? <br>It really is still anyone's guess.<br>You'll get nothing but wild speculation.<br><br>Anyone who claims near certainty on this issue is a fool.</br></br></br></br></br>  I bet Drake will end up in alliance with Law and Luffy as a thanks for defeating Doflamingo, who he probably hates a lot more than he admits.<br>(Oda wouldn't place him in Law's flashback for no reason.)</br>  <br>He's a human with a zoan who prefers to remain in his hybrid form, thus being called a "beast/creature". I don't believe that was his silhouette we saw this chapter.</br>   Works for Mam now <br>Goddamn it I had hopes for him.<br><br>What's left for Drake &amp; Capone now they've both sold out.</br></br></br>  <br>He seems perfectly content working under Kaido though.</br>  <br>It doesn seem very strange he doesn't have a grudge against Doffy...unless his father was an asshole.</br>  <br>He's one of the few recurring "villains".<br>You'll start loving his shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait until he's revealed and there's suddenly a wave of:<br> I knew that <br> It was so obvious <br> You'd have to be a retard to think otherwise <br> Really obvious there Oda, getting lazy are you? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> well-designed <br>yes<br> interesting <br>meh<br> useful <br>not yet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't seem to like Barrels much though; he even ditched him before he died.</br>  <br><br>Just makes the eventual payoff sweeter</br></br>  <br> Works for Mam now <br><br>Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br>All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> concerned <br>*confirmed, obviously</br></br>  <br>I hate retards like you.</br>  <br>She's the navigator, they'd be dead several times over without her. <br><br>I agree her design is shit now, her boobs may not have gotten bigger but she shows them way more so they appear that way. Completely removes the uniqueness of her character. Same with Robin in my opinion, both their new hairstyles turned Robin (my favourite character) to below Zoro and Luffy, and Nami who I appreciated for being Nami not looks like a random slut. Fucking hate it. Oh well, at least Franky got a badass Robot.</br></br></br>  <br>Aw, how cute. <br>I hate shitposters like you too.  ;^) </br></br>  So Urouge met Enel right?  <br>Was Arlong Park the last time Nami had a proper clothes?</br>  <br>Enel is probably still on the moon. If he were to come back though, I see him going down to the blue sea.<br><br>Perhaps this is how he's reintroduced through. I just can't see him being "rational" and wanting to meet someone in such a way.</br></br></br>  <br>It's this guy.</br>  <br>What makes you think he's wanting to meet someone?<br>They said somebody's here not somebody wants to meet you</br></br>  <br>I don't remember having problems with her until post-time skip, but now that I think about it she was probably wearing a bra after most of Arlong yeah. What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service?? I assure you, Nami's breasts aren't what I'm fucking watching it for.</br>  <br>Oh right, I must have read it with someone being there to see them.</br>  <br> google image search <br> Nami water 7 <br> Nami enies lobby <br> Nami sabaody <br> all have shirts on </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>interesting idea<br>proof?</br></br>  <br>Probably stems from the fact he has wings and is likely from the sky islands (or has some angel zoan).</br>  <br>Blackbeard's crew is after pirates for their powers and Lafitte has shown to have the ability to fly.<br>Urouge in particular has a power to convert damage into power. Since he's a Skypeian, Lafitte is the only one able to track him reliably.</br></br>  <br> is likely from the sky islands <br><br>Wasnt he a cop in some blue? And those wings dont look like those stubby little things sky islanders have on their back, even the ones on the moon hieroglyphs in the cover story had different wings.<br>It has to be a DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br> All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar. <br><br> he's after Ceasar on his own <br> doesn't work for Mam at all <br> wants to make a killing on the black market with Ceasar's drugs and other shit <br> Capone has gone full Broker during the timeskip <br> Wants to be the kingpin of the underworld, harking back to his namesake <br><br>Holy fucking shit please god yes.<br>I believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Luffy has been in the New World for 3 FUCKING DAYS and he already captured the second most famous scientist in the world, defeated a Shichibukai an one of the most influential person in the New World, formed alliance with countless rookies and managed to piss off the whole fucking world<br><br>Why haven't you accepted Luffy as your lord and saviour</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Lafitte already has a devil fruit and it's Rosinante's. He was able to enter a room with VA's and Shichibukai's without any of them noticing after all.</br>  <br>Just because he lived there doesn't mean he's from there.</br>  <br>Luffy becoming Pirate King in two weeks confirmed.</br>  <br>Not sure, seems like Oda has something in store for him though.<br><br>What worries me more now is Bonney.<br>She's stealing food in the street like a homeless person...she's still pirate right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, pirates do steal shit.</br>  <br>He's also declared War on two yonkou, basically.<br><br>I love Luffy sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably on the run from the marines.</br>  <br>Oda sent a skypeian to a lightning island<br><br>It has to be enel</br></br></br>  <br>It slows the rate their bodies use oxygen and nutrition as well.</br>   Apoo/Hawkins/Kidd confirmed ded   Guesses on why Shanks? Will luffy stop this if he learns i wonder  <br>I'm sure he will.<br><br>Not that Luffy would want to protect Shanks.<br>More that Luffy would consider Shanks "his to beat".<br><br>Either way this sets up the Kidd/Hawkins/Apoo alliance is official Strawhat enemies now.<br>Things could get fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who was Ace's first mate before he joined WB pirates  <br> Guesses on why Shanks? <br><br>they probably think he's the most calm and laid back while the other threes are out of their fucking minds. I guess they really didn't think that through if that's their reasoning.<br><br>Luffy knows Shanks can handle it by himself, but I'm sure he would get against Kidd and co because he wants to defeat Shanks himself and cannot allow them to try before him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Same hair, scar and lost an arm <br>Daddy issues obviously</br></br>  <br>It's unconfirmed, but I actually think Urogue might be Birkan like Enel. That's make things more interesting if he went down to the blue sea before Enel blew Birka out of existence.</br>  <br>Why does everyone forget Killer?<br><br>Also, I wonder if Shanks laughed at Kid?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because messing with Shanks would piss off less people than in comparison to Kaidou and Big Mom. Big Mom and Kaidou probably have more allies and connections in the new world than Shanks does.</br>  <br>Poor killer, can never eat meat.</br>  <br>These are really cool looking. Got any other images depicting the other crew members with different TS designs?</br>  yfw shanks convinces apoo/basil/Kidd to join him on an alliance to take out Blackbeard, the remnants of the WB pirates are also in it too  <br> kidd and the others arrive to shanks and decide to go full out on him <br> yfw he doesn't even move and simply releases his conqueror's haki power to bring them to their knees <br><br>it's unlikely because Kidd, Hawkins and co would seem like total retards but god it would be great</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br>Lucky Roo is gonna blow Kidd's brains out and kill every single supernova crew member by himself.<br><br>Lucky Roo ain't a nice guy and extremely brutal and efficient,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard is so hot right now.<br>Shanks called this years ago so I can see him marshaling forces against him.<br><br>Then again, I think all the yonkou save BB will fall.<br>New era and all that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Big Mom was having a sea battle with Urouge and Capone.<br>Urouge went in the clouds that just happen to be a sky island to recup.<br>Then Sanji gave Caesar to big mom and talked to Capone to tell him he wants his help getting Caesar back.<br>And he's now in the sky getting Urouge to help him.<br><br><br>So basically it's Sanji that's in the clouds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>would be too powerlevely</br>  <br><br>Blackbeard is a literal pirate. He's in it for booty, plunder and fun, unlike pretty much anyone else in the cast.</br></br>  <br>That is a lot of stuff to happen offscreen.</br>  <br>He's not a captain.</br>  <br> Sanji jobbed and has to ask side characters solve his issues. <br><br>Believable.</br></br></br>  <br>He's in it for dreams.</br>  <br>Neither is Zoro, but they're both Supernovas who are more powerful than Urouge, Bonney and Capone.</br>  <br>Enies Lobby Nami barely had a shirt on. Remember how she changed into her "bra uniform" on the train.</br>  Luffy didn't get involved when he heard Ace got rekt.<br>He did want to get involved once the marines announced they were going to kill him.<br><br>So it's going to be the same with Shanks. He's gonna be like meh it's his problem until BB shows up rapes the kidhawpoo alliance and kidnaps shanks takes him to Raftel to execute him and videosnails his execution to the world. Until Luffy shows up and shit.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll get a flashback that shows it all eventually.</br>  will sanji defeat big mum?  <br>Had a vest on though iirc.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't hit women. He'll beat the shit out of her crew though.</br>  <br>yeah but the alliance is named after the captains. If Kid/Apoo/Hawkins go down it means Killer is going down too because he's part of Kid's crew.</br>  <br>Yes, the guy who had his leg almost broken by Vergo and got fodderized by Doflamingo will defeat a fucking Emperor, you fucking retard</br>  <br><br>This is true.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> Next weeks big reveal is Sanji in the clouds <br><br>I'd be okay with that. He'd finally get a chance to do something.</br></br></br>  <br>My point is that if you're listing supernovas, you can't exclude Killer and Zoro because they are also two of the eleven.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>he wasn't using his full power</br>  So what's so fucked up with killer's face that he has to wear a mask all the time. I mean it would be hard as fuck to eat spaghetti through small holes in a mask and nobody would go through that if they didn't need to.  <br>Oh damn. A vest?! Well nevermind then.</br>  <br>We are 100% going to find out what it was, Oda always delivers</br>  <br>He's Shiki's son so he has to keep the mask on to remain anonymous.</br>  <br>Point is that Sanji was going to die if Law didn't save his ass</br>  its good that oda is bringing all the supernovas back. best characters  <br> What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service? <br>Nothing about Namis personality changed, she is still the same character she always was. People like you seem to miss that since you focus too much on her tits and clothing now.</br></br>  <br>If you take it off he'll die.</br>  <br>It's his plot armor</br>  <br>Would it be extremely painful?</br>  <br>Doffy was just caught him off guard. He'</br>  <br>you don't get to bitch about characters going to shit after their introduction when they are in the same series as sanji</br>  <br>gtfo tumblr fag</br>  Did Luffy just forget about Sabo?<br>So far for Oda's masterful planning.</br>  <br>Sabo was dead.</br>  <br>he thought sabo is dead</br>  <br>no, you are just retarded</br>  <br>I don't use tumblr</br>  <br><br><br>forgot about that, nvm</br></br></br>  Duffy said that he wanted 10 members to join his crew<br><br>So far we have 8 and Jinbei is pretty much confirmed.<br><br>I guess the last member will be another girl? What do you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I hate it when every girl is NEXT STRAWHAT NEXT STRAWHAT CONFIRMED GUYS GONNA JOIN.</br>  <br>I think another female is pretty much guaranteed.The twist will be that she will be almost as retarded as Luffy and will often hang out with Chopper and Usopp instead of Nami and Robin.</br>  <br>The anime is fine for at least half of the series but yes it gets like this eventually.</br>  <br>I honestly hope it's Rebecca. Her little sister dynamic with Robin is cute.</br>  <br><br>I'm hoping Koala. She could be the bridge to the revolution army or something.</br></br>  <br>If it's Rebecca I'll stop reading One Piece. She ruined Dressrosa, she would ruin the rest of the manga. <br><br>I would thank Oda for the creation of great arcs and emotional moments but I would just fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Violet, or as another anon mentions from time to time, a fox woman from wano.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>This is what I'm talking about.<br>None of these characters are interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anyway, it was weird that he wasn't even mentioned once (like luffy saying: "i don't want to lose another brother". I think the chapter about the childhood should have been before marine ford.</br>  <br> Violet isn't interesting <br> A dancer to go with Brook's music <br> An amazing lookout, better than Usopp could ever hope to be <br> somewhat useful in a fight <br>Probably the most useful "new nakama" from this arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>barto is much more fun though</br>  <br><br> Koala <br> not interesting <br><br>Yeah man, you're opinion is shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>god please no</br>  <br>What use is he for the crew other than a cabin boy and some defense from cannon fire (which they do well enough on their own)?</br>  <br>yeah i think he's better as a allied crew or division captain instead of actual crewmember</br>  <br>Likely. I don't get why people are against a beautiful lady swordsman with meat. They really don't pay attention to God Usopp's wisdom. Case in point:<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He tried on the mask and then it stuck. Or maybe the tan-line embarrasses him.<br><br>The real mystery is how he got so big and muscley on a diet of pasta.</br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe his face is disgusting? that could make anybody appetite to lose.</br>   yfw luffy will die at the end of the last battle,and will never live in the new world that will be created   <br>This dumb deserve that .</br>  <br>He's not dumb, he's the literal definition of a superhuman. He declared war on the entire world and survived</br>  <br>Maybe he could take it off, but he just never thinks of it.</br>  <br>What the fuck did you say?</br>  <br>This is why I think Blackbeard is gonna win in the end. Or at the very least, he will die with the title of "King of Pirates"<br> Blackbeard is a famous pirate name, not Luffy or Monkey <br> Blackbeard's attitude "influences" the way future pirates act (ie. like a typical real world pirate) </br></br></br>  <br>If anything Sanji caught Doffy off gaurd, flying in out of nowhere to kick him in mid air.</br>  <br>Man Doffy was so based from the moment he flew through the clouds. Cant believe he lost to a simple punch. Felt alot like the shitty Soul Eater anime ending.</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that literal though.<br><br>The real Blackbeard was killed by a guy named Maynard.<br>I don't see that happening in OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cant believe he lost to a simple punch <br><br>Did you actually read the fight? He got his insides roasted by Red Hawk, his organs destroyed by gamma knife, and still managed to keep up and was going to win if the Gladiators didn't protect Luffy</br></br></br>  <br>that's what I'd like too but we both know it's not going to happen.</br>  <br> Nami drinking too much <br> zoro passed out <br>they had sex</br></br></br>  He seemed legit mad at the gorosei for making a fool of him.<br>How will he respond to the dragon's treachery?<br><br>What's he gonna do with Fujitora? <br>Yell at him some more?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope he chases Fuji down and beats the everliving shit out of him. Poor Sakazuki.</br>  <br>None of them read the manga. They're too stupid to comprehend anything, look at their grammar and you'll see.</br>  <br> She ruined Dressrosa <br>stop being autistic</br></br>  <br>Nah, Kaido is just a faggot with a Sea King Zoan</br>   Good odds Sanji &amp; Co are now facing down fellow supernova Capone Bege's crew along with Mam's <br><br>They're gonna need help.<br><br>Who's gonna give it to them?<br>Law's crew?<br>Jinbei?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Captain Buggy </br>  <br>Based Uncle, of course. Why else does he have that Poneglyph?</br>  <br>Shadows from a random sky island. Just like Wiper's and Luffy's shadows.</br>  Doflamingo is the glasses.<br><br>Vegapunk made them eat the Ito Ito no Mi.</br></br>  <br> even Sogeking <br>Nice play, but take away your fake chapter page, m8!</br></br>  <br> Laboon is Kaido </br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br>She always had big tits.</br></br>  <br>as retarded as it might sound it's not as stupid as some theories regarding sabo that came up in the past two years</br>  <br>interesting</br>  <br>Would be great. Too bad Doffy changed his glasses many times.</br>  <br>Come on man, you can't deny that Nami's chest started out at a more reasonable size<br> in b4 people say that she was just naturally growing as time progressed <br>I know it's just Oda's art style changing but all of his women characters just seem to get bigger and bigger breasts as the series progresses.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo is a complete asshole.<br>If the promise that they made with Ace and Luffy was the reason of why he didn't go to Marineford, I can accept it.<br>But that fucking asshole threw that promise away when he stated to Fuji, regardless his position he will always be at Luffy's side if it's needed.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>then stop posting shitty and ugly tumblr fanart is it that hard, holy shit</br></br></br>  Who's ready for this bad motherfucker to join and be on more cover pages?  <br>I don't want to deny and of course they are bigger now. But be honest she had pretty good tits before too. Just look back Arabasta or even earlier.<br>We saw those tits' shape in her jumper too.<br><br>I know it's hard to belive that they naurally grew during timeskip due Nami's age, but it isn't inpossible.<br><br><br>Same with Tashigi. I really dislike the dum theory that she gave birth to a child duting ts, thats why her breasts grew and that's why she's so great mother figure for PH's giant kids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's not goofy enough<br><br>even zoro looks silly when he's pissed off</br></br></br>  <br>That's not really hard when you have Plot-armor ,and that's why he suck , luffy can do anything he wants , he'll never be punished for his action . This is a generic shounen MC , boring and immortal.</br>  <br>Well yeah.<br>Can you name a single shounen that handled killing the MC and continuing the story well without the MC coming back via some stupid shit?  Aside from JJBA. </br></br>  <br> he's not goofy enough <br>That's why I liked him. He was a good mentor figure for Luffy.<br> stopped him at ID to wasting time fighting with BB <br> helped and saved him at Marineford <br> made Luffy remember that he has more important things and instead of loss and past he should focus on the future </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not shounen but  TTGL </br>  <br>I forget more stuff than I remember with One Piece so its all ok.</br>  <br>I'm not blaming oda because he doesn't kill luffy .<br>But luffy declared the war on : World goverment , Big mom and Kaido , that's too much , He's only still alive because he can't die , every other pirates would be already dead .</br></br>  <br>I totally forgot Zoro still had those earrings and now I can't ignore them</br>  <br> every other pirates would be already dead <br>bullshit<br>I bet Shanks made something similar until he became one of the Yonko. and so on</br></br></br>  <br><br>That bring's my memory back about those shitty theories about Doffy's and Corazon's plus the string clones' earrings.</br></br>  <br>Aokiji</br>  <br><br>Well he's also alive/not caught because of Zoro and Kuma.</br></br>  when will it finally be zoro's turn again  <br>All of Wano</br>  <br><br>Once somebody appears who is worth his time. <br><br>He must be getting frustrated with all these jobbers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will he again use his bandana?</br>  <br>Nami was 18, it's normal to grew tits</br>  <br> He's forgotten about his promised duel with Kinemon over Shusui already </br>  <br>No, he's just Luffy without the moral compass.</br>  <br>he wasnt listing Supernova<br><br>Kid/Hawkins/Apoo dont have a catchy alliance name to toss around like StrawHeart</br></br></br>  <br>OZ ALLIANCE</br>  <br>You're following the "At the end of the series the world has to transition into being Earth" trope, and no, that isn't going to happen.</br>  <br>I SAID CATCHY<br><br>THAT ISNT CATCHY</br></br></br>  <br>He did in fishman island and against pica. What are you reading?</br>  <br>Explain Robin's massive bust increase from 27 to 29 then.</br>   when you nut so hard the whole squad feel it   <br>You're dumb.</br>  <br><br>Also Blackbeard would benefit greatly from converting damage into power, since he's prone to taking hits, and relies on physical punches after sucking enemies towards himself with his Yami Yami no Mi power.</br></br>  <br>Its not Oz anymore with Big Mom as the Wicked Witch</br>  <br>He's hot shit, and now every Marine is thinking back to when Smoker was like:<br> "Yeah, this kid is hot shit going on to hottest. You guys give me some more resources, pls." </br></br>  <br>plus candy cane rails</br>  <br> Shanks has red hair <br> Kidd has red hair <br>Shanks is a dead beat dad and Kidd holds a grudge for him because of it. So to prove he is better than his dad and doesn't need his care, he's going to usurp his position.<br><br>Daddy issues, everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy might not step in.<br>He could say something along the line of:<br> "I promised him to return the strawhat when I'm king. I can't meet him just yet." <br>Or<br> "Shanks and the guys are strong. They can handle themselves." </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's in it for the dreams.<br> "A man's dream.... never dies!!" <br>- Blackbeard on Jaya</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dragon made her preggo m8.</br></br>  <br> Marines presented as incompetent while pirates are hailed as heros on Dressrosa and surrounding nations <br> Gorosei giving you tough shit <br> Your own admiral talks trash to your face <br> Be a total failure of a fleet admiral <br><br>He's gonna cry to his fucking bonsais.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that's who gave Kidd his new look and he's looking for vengeance.<br>Or he might have the smallest crew and it'll be easier that way. <br>Or it's easier to get close to shanks. <br>Either way they're fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's gonna make an example of every pirate he sees.<br>Starting with Luffy/Law if he has his way...which he won't.<br><br>People were calling Akainu as a serious big bad before Timeskip.<br>Sure he'll be a big fight one day but for now, circumstance is making a bitch of him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't get why people are against a beautiful lady swordsman <br>There's a big difference between the word Usopp used in TB and Rebecca's title. Rebecca is a kentoushi/gladiator while Usopp referred to a kengo/swordsman, someone who's dedicated to the art of swordsmanship like Mihawk. <br> meat <br>When the bento dropped to the ground it was just mush, not like the cartoonish drawings of meat/steak we usually see in this series.</br></br></br></br>  <br> violet/usopp sniping antics <br>I'm okay with that.<br>Barto is fine to</br></br></br>  <br> Shanks is a dead beat dad <br><br>Shanks would have been 15-16 at the time Kid was born. He probably laid some pretty farm girl and left long before the girl knew she was pregnant</br></br></br>  <br>Are you serious? By 18 a girl is finished developing, short of surgery or pregnancy they're not getting any bigger.</br>  <br>why does bigmam have a jolly roger with a mustache??</br>  <br>She is an Okama, there is no way a woman be that strong in One Piece.</br>  nigga  <br>They're lips, not a mustache.</br>  <br>Don't be silly, anon. Moriah is Kidds dad.</br>  <br>Who would a Moriah?</br>  <br> implying he needs consent </br>  <br> she's still pirate right? <br>Well, the crew she had amassed got either killed by Blackbeard or locked up by the marines. Not something you easily replace.</br></br>  Let's discuss something important. <br>Who makes the best parties? <br>Luffy or Apoo?</br></br>  <br>What if Foxy is the 7th Shichibukai?</br>  <br>Luffy.<br><br>Luffy throws the better party.<br>Apoo is a better party attendee, I expect.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He doesn't even need roofies, he'd just cut your shadow off.</br></br>  <br>I will eat my own ass.</br>  <br><br> say no <br> he fucks your shadow instead </br></br></br>  <br>Not a chance, the 7th Shichibukai cut off Z's arm.</br>  <br> Not a chance, the 7th Shichibukai cut off Z's arm. <br><br>Good odds it's another swordsman?<br>I don't think I'd like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't need to be a swordsman to cut, Doffy and Moria aren't swordsmen.</br>  <br> Wire in the back looking like a giant cockroach <br><br>i'll never understand that kid's design</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was Chameleone?<br><br>It isn't?</br></br></br>  Do you like Capone ?  <br>does hair even grow that long in two years?</br>  <br>That's not a real character, it was something Oda made up for some event (and I think a game).</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br> 100+ years old <br> still looking relatively youthful and able to fight hordes of vampires with his students and easily dispatch them <br> can heal people using his ripple <br> can see the future of people using his ripple <br><br>Were all subsequent ripple users shit because they were selfish and didn't maintain their training into old age? Also did Tonpetty have a stand? Because the healing other via touch (not like how zeppli unlocked the ripple in johnathan and his ripple healed him) and future reading seems completely out of line with the Ripple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  first for wanting to eat hot pants' ass  <br>The Ripple is JoJo's Hokuto Shinken.</br>  <br> Were all subsequent ripple users shit because they were selfish and didn't maintain their training into old age? <br>The only other Ripple users we saw last into old age were Straits and Joseph. Straits tried his best, but just wasn't as talented as Tonpetty, while Joseph just got outright lazy because there was no reason for him to train his use of the Ripple for 50 years after Cars.<br><br>One could argue though that Hermit Purple's power partially drew itself from Joseph's Ripple, so he did get the "seeing the future" ability in the end.</br></br></br></br>  Jotaro is the best JoJo imo tbh.  Stupid question, but what would you guys like to see in future JoJo installments?<br><br>personally,  i kinda wanna see Ripple return. maybe not for the full part, but just have it there. </br></br>  <br> Jotaro <br> Best Jojo </br></br>  <br>Not a Jotarofag but, why do you post the worst Jojo?<br>Jolyne didn't protect a damn thing</br></br>  <br> Trashes on Jotaro <br> Posts a picture of the   second best  JoJo<br><br>Fuck off, nigger</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?

I guess he's just one of those guys who works better on the sidelines.</br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean all true ripple masters have Hermit purple?<br><br>Was Tonpetty a stand user?</br></br></br>  Dead franchise.  <br>not Lisa Lisa too?</br>  <br>Why? He was awesome.</br>  Jojos in one sentence.<br><br><br>Johnathan: Moralfag gentleman kenshiro<br><br>Joseph: Buff human Bugs Bunny<br><br>Jotaro: School delinquent Kenshiro<br><br>Josuke: Sweet boy on the outside, straight hustler on the inside<br><br>Giorno: Gold Experience punched a brick wall and gave it life.

There was a bad guy coming, he was after me, and using some weird liquid I trapped his Stand in a part of the house and left him there.<br><br>There was a very weird part of the house, everyone was told to not go there but some kids went in anyway, it was a smal room wih a big virgin Mary statue, if you stared at it long enough you would lose control of your body and then wander around the house telling people to not go to that room and leave the house in a very spooky way.<br><br>Some time passed and I was chilling with my crew and one of those cursed virgin mary kids came up to us so we knocked him out.<br><br>Just after that, some dude in a trench coat, looking very menacing, walked by a door no one really uses. I have seen this guy before he had a fucked up ability, if you stared into his evil eyes he would give you an order and you would have to follow it no matter what or you will die.<br><br>I told my crew to get out of the house and go to a big house across the street where some event was being held. We went there and chilled for a while, but before I realized it, that Stand user we were running away from was there, this guy can sense when someone looks at him so I cant even look at him to check his position.<br><br>My crew was gone so I went looking for them, but some dude grabbed me by the back. I tried to call out my Stand but nothing happened, thats when I realized the dude grabbing me, was the enemy Stand user, to not look at his eyes I started to call for help and a nearby cop noticed me, but did nothing. The enemy Stand user was disguised as a cop. He grabbed my head and made me look at his eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I thought aqua necklace could only turn into different liquids? How did it turn into a brandy logo?  <br>The logo is made of wax, which is a very viscous liquid.</br>  <br>It's fun. not as fun as Stands but still fun.</br>  <br>I had sleep paralysis once and I felt some spooky girl behind me trying to suck my soul and drag me to hell. <br><br>Since I was so used to sleep paralysis though, it wasn't such a big deal to me. <br><br>Stardust Crusaders final ep came out that night so I just focused my thoughts on Star Platinum beating up the spooky girl and so it came out of my body and did just that, in the dream. It was pretty rad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Lali ho!!  </br>  <br>I honestly disagree. Any power that can shoot the cap off of a coke bottle, make water into a solid, allow you to stick to walls, transmit the power of the sun, break through rocks and walls, mind control/give people incredible strength, create a force field out of hair, redirect lazer beams, create a hangglider out of stone, let you walk on water, shoot out bubble beams, and probably a bunch of other stuff that I'm forgetting is far too vague and powerful. Ripple users never figure out how to use their power in creative, fun ways. They just create new powers.</br>  <br>Did it yell ORAORAORAORA?</br>  <br>Well, fuck<br><br><br>Yeah, ended up destroying my cabinet with his punch barrage too. Good thing it wasn't real.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Tonpetty was over a hundred years old.</br>  <br>She has one objective: Leave the prison. After that, Pucci was just icing. Icing that she never got to enjoy, but icing nonetheless. But, in terms of being a badass and fucking niggas up, Jolyne was top-tier.</br>  Isn't there some sort of Jojo event going on today in japan?  if there's a part 9 jojo protagonist, what names do you think will be picked? would it be a japanese name, or will he go with a western name?  Evafags drool over Asuka, Rei, Misato and Kaworu.<br>Why don't we give some love to Ricchan?</br>    She's just awful.  <br>Wow. This might be good. Depending on how good this does, i might do a Misato thread (She gets no love)</br>  <br>You have good taste</br>    heres some appreciation for you.  <br>Thanks anon, you too.</br>  A high school girl will never pursue, like, four doctorates to get close to you.  <br>Poor Ritsuko. <br>She's as broken as the rest of the cast, but probably also the only one that can't possibly save herself.</br></br>  I'd give her a go.  <br>Easily the most sylish of the bunch</br>  <br>The worst of it might be that she really didn't know. That felt like love to her.</br>  OLD AND BUSTED. OLD. AND BUSTED.<br><br>THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE HER.</br></br>  <br>To me it seems like her conscious self didn't know, but her subconscious definetly knew, but she tried to reject it until the very end</br>  <br> OLD <br>She's only 40.</br></br>    <br>Absolutely. <br>Misato, which people drool over, is younger by just one year, which is nothing, really.</br></br>  How the fuck did Gendo manage to tap that?  <br>Evangelion is just a harem anime for Gendo.</br>  anno is the master of making attractive anime girls, every single girl in EVA is top tier    <br><br><br>I want to understand this as well, what the fuck was so attractive about Gendo? Didn't Shinji's mom barely tolerate him?</br></br></br>  <br>In at least one continuity it looks like pity, but somehow she was just always attracted to him for some reason.</br>  <br>gendo has (or more likely had) a different side to him that yui saw<br><br>gendo is basically shinji that made all the wrong choices so he ended up the douchebag he is</br></br></br>  <br>There was no reason. Evangelion is secretly a deconstruction of the harem anime genre.</br>  <br>Seems like a pretty spot on explanation.<br>Also, if we think about it Gendo x Yui/Naoko (later Ristuko) vaguely resambles Shinji x Rei/Asuka.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qWd<wbr>60cQPoRw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Who here thinks Ritsuko would be crazier in bed than Misato?  <br>Unquestionably. Misato would demand an apology if you peed on her.</br>  <br>Without a doubt</br>  <br>I abhor fake blondes</br>  <br>Since she has greenish eyes, blonde hair suits her way better than a darker color</br>  <br>Her hair in general sucks</br>  <br>Best woman. <br>Nobody really got a good end but somehow I've always felt that what happened to her was undeserved and out of nowhere.</br></br>  <br>To each their own I guess.<br>I think her short hair works well with her scientist nature. Also, if she had long hair it wouldn't contrast as much with Misato.<br>If you are talking about style however, those were the 90s. <br>Nadia (secret of Blue Water) has a similiar hairstyle</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel bad for everyone's spines.</br>  <br>It's kinda cute on her if naive and tragic is a kind of cute. She very specifically made herself over after visiting her mom and mom's boyfriend at Gehirn.</br>  <br>I may have done structural damage to my dick because of Denkichi.<br>He has a very bad case of sameface/body but goddamn!</br></br>  <br>When she puts the effort, she can easily compete with Misato (imho)</br>    <br>That landing gear looks like a man with an afro and moustache.</br>  <br>What the hell, you are right, never noticed that</br>  Evangelion is the fucking reason why every silver haired anime character is gay as fuck  <br>She is always putting in the work, mouth pussy like that doesn't just happen. She had that game locked down so hard they had to engineer Kitakami to defeat her.</br>  <br>Yui was all over that Gendo dick<br> I've been dating Gendo Rokubungi. A lot! <br>Even Fuyutsuki questions her shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Maya and her non reciprocated love.</br>    <br>Well, that's fanmande. <br>Altough knowing Anno, he may have tought of some even crazier relationship.</br></br>  Absolutely the hottest Eva girl, and one of my favourite characters. Not enough fanart, but I'm eternally thankful for the Lilium doujin existing.  <br>Such as?</br>  I've got Rule 34, but not sure if this is THAT kind of thread.  <br>Anon, please refrain. <br>This is more of a comfy thread. Very mildly nsfw is ok, hentai should be avoided.<br>Thanks for asking :3<br><br>Image search gives no result. I hate to ask, but what is this from? The manga or one of the spin-offs? It has been a while since I read them</br></br></br></br></br>  So does she have Electra complex? Or is that Misato I'm confusing about?  Misato and Ritsuko were both beautiful honestly. Misato was not only sexy, but she was energetic and wild, but also had a sensitive side. Risato is a two sided coin with both intelligence and beauty and most notably I didn't recall her showing any emotional weakness. Wow, let me end this love letter here.  <br>Thank you for clearing that up for me. Just thought it'd be better to ask than haphazardly post.</br>  <br>It looks like the Shinji Ikari Raising Project. Ritsuko is an old pervert</br>  <br>To go with you "love letter"</br>  <br>Ritsuko is for sexual</br>  I could have sworn seeing some official looking pictures of Ritsuko with short hair? What's that all about?  <br>I wouldn't be so sure about that</br>  <br>That's the design for Evangelion 3.0, anon</br>  <br>3.0. Pretty much all of the adults' looks got updated.</br>  She would be best girl if her shit taste didn't ruin her.  <br>Was it this?</br>  <br> sleeping with the same men as your mother <br>Disgusting!</br></br>  <br>Boom. Yeah, that's it. I wonder why they had a mind to change her...</br>  <br>She probably smells like an ashtray and cat piss</br>  <br><br>Just (Not) Fuck My Shit Up</br></br>  <br>That's mean!</br>  <br>To represent that time had passed without aging her at all. That's her at 44 years old.</br>  <br>Probably to signify the "break-up" with NERV and a fresh start. I do like that she wasn't banging Gendo this time around, I just wish there was a better sense of when Wille split off on its own</br>  <br>She looks great for 44.</br>  <br>I really hate how she looks in the third movie.</br>  <br>It takes place in the future, even Misato's hair was changed. It's most likely to show that they're leaving the past behind.</br>  <br>Misato looks like she straightened her hair or something. It was wavier before</br>  <br>I think I get it. I'm still on the original series and haven't watched the Rebuild(s) yet so it caught me off guard initially.</br>  Best Eva girl? Best Eva girl.  <br>Wow, Misato! She looks much more professional now.</br>  <br>I think it's fitting because it looks more modern, with the side swept bangs and all.</br>  <br><br>You've made a world where cake never goes stale, Shinji. Omedetou.</br></br>  <br>She passed 14 without being recruited as an Eva pilot. That's amazing</br>  <br>Older Misato looks so much better with that "mom haircut".</br>  <br>because she's a loser who was mad Gendo didn't fuck her enough</br>  <br>I thought she looked a lot better with a ponytail</br>  <br>She's just a hard working woman, with deep personal issues</br>   Much hotter than Yui <br> Image forever tainted thanks to Unit 02 making her bugfuck crazy once </br>  <br>I think you described her precisely. That's how she always came off to me.</br>  <br>It's a shame neither the manga or the anime had the time to give a complete backstory to Kyoko and Naoko. What we got was good, but there's a lot of potential there.</br>  she should have dumped Gendo and hooked up with Maya.  <br><br> That Kaworu JoJo</br></br>    <br>Maya's behaviour seems that of a lesbian, but for Ritsuko I'm not so sure</br>  <br>wasn't there the theory that Aoba had a thing for Maya?</br>  <br>Well by 3.0 she has left Gendo, so maybe that's a possibility. <br>Also in Rebuild the two cat statues on her desk were changed to two females, for whatever reason.<br><br>If that were the case wouldn't he have seen her during Instrumentality? It was actually implied he didn't love anyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Very possible from Aoba's part, but I really doubt Maya reciprocates</br>  <br>hm, true. Maybe Maya even kind of appreciated that. Remember, she didn't look all too happy when Kaji flirted with her.</br>  <br/>  <br>Well...you know Kaji. He WAS coming on a little strong. Enough to make most women weary atleast.</br>  <br> I want to understand this as well, what the fuck was so attractive about Gendo? <br><br>Power is an aphrodisiac<br><br>No clue what Yui saw in him while he was still just a midlevel scientist though</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>but gendo didn't have any power initially right?<br>He came onto yui because of her connection to seele</br></br>  <br>Actually, it's never implied that she's with Gendo in Rebuild in the first place</br>  <br>OP, I just want to thank for starting this thread. Ritsuko doesn't get nearly any attention from the fanbase so it was nice to have a thread completely devoted to her. You're one of the good ones.<br><br><br>I like this one, my two favorite girls &lt;3</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gendo was just some punk college student Fuyutsuki bailed out. People assumed he came onto Yui because she's the daughter of a Seele member, but Yui insists he has another side they didn't see</br>  <br>That was Fuyutsuki's perspective of him at least, a leering creep 10 years older than her. Yui says he's sweet when nobody's looking.</br>    <br>Women love people like him because it makes them feel like a special snowflake since "he's not always a total dick to me like he is with everyone else."</br>  <br>yui is the daughter of a seele member? when and were was this stated?</br>  <br>It's in Yui's files in Eva 2's Classified Information<br><br> D. In-Depth Information <br><br> Yui is the daughter of an influential member of SEELE, and, accordingly, was in the position of being able to understand their plans. Knowing this, Gendo became acquainted with her </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this changes fucking everything. how is this not mentioned more often?</br>  <br>21 implies she has connections, it's gotta be family since she wasn't personally anything yet, and they went high enough that Gendo was part of the Katsuragi Expedition with a secret mission a year after meeting her.<br><br><br>Then NGE2 just outright says it, she's the daughter of a monolith and the Ikaris have been doing science for the Illuminati since the end of WW2.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not helping Maya up, kiss her and give a "see? THAT'S MY GIRL" to Gendo just to see his face. </br>  <br>Probably because it's only brought up in a video game and that's the extent of what we know. Yui's the daughter of a Seele member (we don't know who or which), and Gendo used her status to gain membership himself.<br><br>It does cast her conversations with Fuyutsuki from the flashback episode in a new light</br></br></br>  <br>It's not anyone on the Human Instrumentality Committee, anyway, there's no representative for Japan but Gendo. So don't worry about figuring out if you've secretly seen Shinji's maternal grandfather.</br>      <br>She grew up without a father and Gendou was the only father figure she had. She had a standing rivalry with her own mother and tried to one-up her, so that's way she went after him instead of Kaji.</br>  Enjoy the weekend and take it easy.  Requesting Eureka in a Kendo gi, can be a different color from the example.<br>Additional References: http://imgur.com/a/jK9yw<br>Kendo Uniform: http://i.imgur.com/LwoPlv3.jpg<br><br>Thanks for your consideration!</br></br></br></br>  Requesting C.C in a fundoshi  Good morning or afternoon everyone, hope you all had a great week!<br><br>Since this month is the 10 years anniversary of Akari and I, I would like to requests something related to it, if you don't mind!<br>Something like a POV of Akari in a beautiful evening dress and in front of a table with champagne cups in front of her and her with a beautiful smile? <br><br>In any cases, thank you very much if you pick this up!</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Maka.

And once they hired Rory as their religious advisor Rory made sure they avoid any taboos.</br></br></br>  Why do so many people on /a/ dislike Heaven's Feel? <br><br>I personally think that while Heaven's Feel is my personal favorite route, that each route is great in their own way. Just because I prefer one route doesn't stop me from enjoying Fate and UBW.<br><br>What is it that you guys don't like about Heaven's Feel? And be real with me. No "LOL COOKING LOL WORMSLUT" shitposting. But more importantly, why must we all be so tsundere for each other?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirei says the grail is inside the church and he touches it everyday, he's not a trustworthy source for anything.</br>  <br>So what Illya said doesn't count because you said so?</br>  <br><br><br>All correct on the assumption that all three routes had the same backgrounds.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a different route, faggot. <br>In HF Sakura "eats" more servants than Illya, so the one that gets to summon the Manjew is her. It's not that hard to understand.</br></br>  <br>Illya "doesn't count" because Kotomine contradicts her, and he is the one with more authority on the subject.</br>  http://otakomu.jp/archives/277093.h<wbr>tml<br><br> Amamiya Sora gets her own photobook <br><br>スッキリ ｷﾀ━━━ヽ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)人(ﾟ∀ﾟ )ﾒ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)人(ﾟ∀ﾟ )ﾒ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)人(ﾟ∀ﾟ )ﾉ━━━!!!!</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I don't think she's act like that only with Kouki. In Shigatsu, She's also act like that to Ohsaka Ryota and Hanae Natsuki. <br>I think it's just that she's genki type and can act friendly even if with male seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>Obviously if a producer or whatever have good connection with some agency, their seiyuu will get more role. Work is like that, Nepotism everywhere.</br>  <br> Kaito Ishikawa <br>What role he get this season? I only know Rinne, and it's from last season.</br></br>  <br>It is even more noticeable now when she only does main character roles and especially Aniplex every season.</br>  <br>This. <br><br>Sawashiro and Miyano are the greatest examples of fan service acting. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OLk<wbr>FyNHKDIA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  New episode in 3 hours and still no thread yet?
