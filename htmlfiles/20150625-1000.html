[ DOWNLOAD YOUR ANIME NOW. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. DOWNLOAD YOUR ANIME NOW. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.     BUT I AM ALWAYS DOWNLOADING    Ooh, I'm shaking.   Kill yourself you ecofascist fuckwad. TPP is good.    It hasn't passed yet, though.  Blow your brains out, you jewish-dick-licking cuckold.      After you, you 99% populist retard.     tpp is good  Good goy    https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/<wbr>08/whats-wrong-tpp</wbr>   Labor unions and nativists: truly the scum of the Earth. Asia wouldn't be "stealing" your jobs if you worked harder and more cheaply.     sure, if you're a corporate scumbag, or a super greedy jew, or a rich person.      TPP IS GOOD    let's give corporations even more power oh and basically make them the equivalent of states what could go wrong?   As if the MPAA, RIAA and friends weren't enough..        You first, you farty poop-gobbling dumbface.    Corporations are good. I'd much rather have one decide what's good for me than worthless liberal arts students like yourself.    I wonder who's behind this post?    Why do you keep shilling this shit here? The bill has no chance of passing for bigger reasons than the internet. go back to reddit     I'm conservative but nice try Mr Goldberg.    this entire thread <br/>    conservative   hates corporations  So you're a fascist?       I live in the UK so I'm good for a while      TPP is good    Every year the same shit and two months later no one remembers.  Antichrist when?  Will we get anime in the next world?       It just did you stupid goy     Wow it's fucking nothing  Just like sopa and all the other net policing bills   OP is a fag        TPP is bad, it hurts workers, i care even though i'm a worthless NEET.    I'mean sure you'll bend over like a good little boy when you get that indictment from insertcompanyhere   Is this the current dubs thread?  Did it even pass in/for Japan?   No.       implying i pirate      doesn't think corporations should rule the world    I'm somehow a fascist   Ok.        I miss Hime too.    Please don't engage with /pol/, there is nothing to be gained.   so what happens, I can't download anime anymore?  maybe ill finally get a job then    When and where did it all go so wrong?   /pol/ hates TPP too, faggot   Don't worry. The next president, Rand Paul, will never let this pass.   When antiglobalist fucktards began posting. Global interconnectivity is the future whether these cumstains like it or not. They probably hate NAFTA too      implying piracy is the only thing corporations will go after   You haven't payed your YouTube payment this week sir, would you like to upgrade to the silver BUNDLE to have access to facebook, youtube, and reddit for a 10 percent discount?       UK   good       Manga     are you an alien     these socialist delusions  Yeah okay that'll totally happen Mr. Marx.     April 19, 2000   So basically, they're going to shut down torrent sites like nyaa? Are they gonna go after IRC? Or, are we just going to start getting more angry letters from our ISP about us pirating media?   He's not pol. They hate TPP too.    Everyone hates TTP/TTIP.     /pol/ is one person  ok     Nothing will change as usual.    Most 4chan users aren't really NEETs though, judging from the overall post quality on other boards, I'd say a large part of 4chan's userbase is still in high school, and I'd wager at least 25% or more of posters on /a/ are still in high school.  Even then, most people here don't care about the workers at all, they're just afraid they're going to have to actually start paying for CR or buy BDs for exorbitant funds.      We're just going to use TPP as an excuse to funpost and get doubles.     Shutting down torrent sites   And 4 new ones will show up.      Here's your reply    And what about TCP/IPv6?    The problem are doujinshi as well.     Rand  Push is trashing everyone expect the non Dick sucker.      it won't happen, they said    corporations aren't greedy, they said   Mark my words faggit it has been a wet dream of theirs for years now        Epic.   I want /pol to leave  The polls showed more than 50% where under the age of 18. I know it's digusting, I'm 25 and probably in the higher age tier.       Are they gonna go after IRC?   Good luck.      Thanks, put a lot of thought in it.    kek    Lol my ISP can suck a dick. They can't ban someone's internet connection legally.      April 19, 2000  Why do you fucks blame 9/11 for everything?     Are you a fucking brony with that name?     looks at how its impossible to fimd jpop online      You haven't payed your YouTube payment this week sir, would you like to upgrade to the silver BUNDLE to have access to facebook, youtube, and reddit for a 10 percent discount?   Pls no. Is this really plausible?      With TPP they can. Was in one of the leaked papers, look it up.    Please do explain how you know what the name refers to I'd love to hear you explain how you're aware it reference.    No, it isn't. Anyone who tells you there's a single chance in hell is a marxist fearmonger.     9/11  Can you read?     9/11 was the day the Jews blew up the WTC and got everything they wanted in the Middle East. Now they just keep pushing their luck, and so far they haven't failed.     He wasn't already using jpopsuki  Hooo boy. I guess the next best thing is Soulseek, but the wait is much longer for those files.     Because I was a brony. Three years ago. John deLancie voices the character Discord.    They wouldn't be able to cancel massive events such as Comiket with nearly half a million attendees a year without stirring up massive shitstorms. It's such an integral part of modern Japanese otaku culture, the outrage would be akin to restricting the sale of indie and self-published games on Steam (they're different, I know, as doujinshi are usually derivative of other works, but the principle of stifling independent creators is the same)     Global interconnectivity is the future   Global interconnectivity is fine, but not when it's being negotiated behind closed doors with lots of input from corporations.      This happens every fucking year do you even remember SOPA? Or maybe the 3 iteriations that failed before then?       Why yes, but let's be honest here. It's more profitable to sell you adds and give you the service for free. Like they are already doing.   What niggers fail to understand is that having too much control is expensive, so is better to just sell your personal information.       You realize that none of this matters? This is going to happen at one point either way. The Internet isn't going to stay this way. It was never meant to do so.    6 million wasn't enough.    Serious question are you still in highschool are you even 18?     Pretty much this, they're going to keep trying until it slips by.     Yah, fucking pansies, every country should have sweatshops amirite?    Corporations are the future too. Privatization drives innovation. I can't wait for my great grandkids to live in the Pepsi sponsored Mars colony.    Yeah, and NAFTA was good too.  Oh wait, Mexico is still a total shithole with no economy to speak of, and so is Canada.       shit taste in anime   faggot jew  what a surprise      lmao read a book nigger Canada benefited most from NAFTA    How is it better than what we have now?    Yes they can, and do. Most of the time they don't care enough and just do the bare minimum to appease the corporate overlords.  Look it up in your ISP agreement, most have a 3 strike policy.  As in if they have to send you 4 copyright notices they SAY they will terminate your service. But they know if they kept their word they wouks lose too many customers so they just don't most of the time.         Is this really plausible?  Yes, and the only remaining option would be to   give up the internet, spend more time outside with your more immediate friends, and return to the way people lived socially for the better part of the last 10,000 years     Nothing will happen as always. At least for me, that is, 3rd world countries are the best.    NAFTa immensely benefited the region. Mexico circa 1998 is loads worse (except for the border regions thanks to American drug laws) than Mexico 2015.    where did you get your copy of The Phantom Pain?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan - Mangekyou Sharingan techniques like Susanoo and Amaterasu - Super Strength - Great Medical skills - Chakra Chains - Healing Bite  Which of the two will be better?                     </wbr>   I dunno, but Sarada should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.    HAHA THIS FAGGOT. TRY HAVING AN SAUCE AS YOUR DAD AND CUCKURA AS YOUR MOM    So, its all quiet on the spoiler front?    tfw Mitsuki took a bite of gum-gum    Why do you all believe that Boruto can use Chidori? It makes much more sense that the is using Rasengan with Raiton.    Orochimaru does that stretching thing all the time why does no one make luffy jokes about him.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127119800     but [Sarada/Himawari/Naruto/Hinata/Shik<wbr>adai] should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.</wbr>     No wonder no one replied to that. Naruto is not in the title and there isn't a naruto picture.    Because he only stretch his neck and puke himself all the time    0:28  Konohamaru confirmed being Sarada-Mitsuki-Boruto sensei      Because in the trailer when lightning appears around his hand the typical sound of chidori is heard.  There are many raiton jutsus and none sound like chidori, so that's why it seems boruto will have both the rasengan and the chidori.      Don't forget the Uzumaki chains in case she turns out to be Karin's daughter.    And you can tell which one of these two threads the mods will delete.    How does Naruto's kid get snake shit and chidori?    Doesn't really look like either. He doesn't have a chakra ball in his hand and the lightning is all around him rather than lighting up his arm/hand. Maybe he threw a lightning rasengan ball?    Sasuke trained him.     - Chakra Chains   - Healing Bite  Karen is not her mother.       Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin  Ain't fucking happening. He may be a cheeky shithead, but he is not snake-user tier edgy. When she grows up Sarada could pull a neat snake lady act with that summoning contract, though.        It most likely his own technic - a combination of Sasuke's and Naruto's favorite moves.    Yes she is did you even read Gaiden?     Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin   Toad Summoning    Sage Mode   Super Strength   Great Medical skills   Chakra Chains   Healing Bite  I didn't see any of that shit in there            It looks nothing like a rasengan.    Does he not know that his father is an orphan?    I can't figure out why his eyes seem strange to me    That's dark history He's a sweet summer child     His eyes a lighter blue than Naruto's, probably due to Hyuuga genes.    Doesn't he know that his teammate grew up 12 years without her dad or that Shikadai is in the exact same situation as him?    It should easily be Salad Because she's Tsunade with Sharingan  It will be Burrito Because he dripped out his dad's penis.        Quote's wrong. He actually says:  "This parent shouldn't have been there from the beginning!"   He'd be a real class-A shithead if he threw Hinata under the bus like that. Threw her like he did his sister's cake.       It's the same color as Naruto's. They just look weird because of the actual decent animation.    Shikadai's mom isn't a doormat    asspull retarded explanation for misunderstanding is incoming     she a Tsunade  That didn't help Sakura much what make having a low level sharingan any different?     Because pic related sounds just like a Chidori and we see him add the Rasengan part later on in the movie.   I'm not sure if he throws it though. Could just be an animation thing.      Not like that bit of history pertains to him in any way. Telling someone that their parent was an orphan doesn't help at all. Trying to get a child to pity their parent is one of the worst things you can do.    She should definitely yell at him more. It's arousing.   And it looks like Himawari grew up, so the cake scene was likely a flashback.      I don't think it will be Rasenshuriken, if he learns lightning jutsus. He's more likely to make his own variant of Rasengan using lightning chakra. Something like Rasenbolt, which might be some sort of ball lightning.   fuck off   She is too much of a loser nerd.     She probably spanks the fuck out of him whenever he gives her lip, which is quite frequently if he's anything like his father.    <br/>   Okay, how about we talk about your waifu from SoL #39567?   But who is Mitsuki?  Everyone is giving Sarada MS, but how can she awaken it? She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma.    She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma  I nominate Bolt.     You wish.    It needs to be someone she CARES about.    Why does boruto got nothing of his mother ?  Shikadai=Temari eyes Chouchou=Karui skin Inoscrarecrow=Ino hair Himawari= Hinata hair Sarada=   Karin glasses            Fuck no, Cuckura should be the sacrifice    We're talking about each character at peak potential and the description reads that Salad would at least get Mangekyou Sharingan. That shit is hardly low level.  Also Peak Sakura still never surpassed Peak Tsunade unless she got significantly stronger between the war and plopping out a kid.       yfw Sarada turns out to be the first ever Uchiha to unlock her MS without maximum suffering and edge     One of her mothers... Or Sasuke after he's done training Boruto.   Don't like the setup. Seems like Kishimoto just wanted to mix the best of the best into one character. Especially dat kids attitude. Would be better off if that kid got tourette's syndrome and could use no jutsus at all.     Big bouncy tattas susanoo    BAKA DORITO!   How can this guy be so fucking whiny? Naruto is ALWAYS AROUND   oh no, it's a shadow clone thats playing hide and seek with me, MY LIFE IS SO TERRIBLE   Literally what the fuck Kishimoto probably doesn't even realize how entitled he's making Bort and actually thinks his problems are legitimate          Hinata is a shit tier Hyuuga whos genes are so shit she can't even pass down her goddamn Byakugan.  Master Eugenicist my ass. He should've gave Hanabi to Naruto.       you were slow this time   Holy shit apparently Sasuke went back to his "mission" after the Gaiden. So Sarada is father-less again till he returns to become Boruto's master.    asspull retarded explanation for misunderstanding is incoming  And missing out on the opportunity of giving Salad an easy powerup? Not a chance.      He should've gave Hanabi to Naruto.   Noone can handle that semen demon People have premature ejaculations the moment they'd look on her in bed       It's clear that Naruto "dies" so Boruto can learn what losing his dad actually is.     Peak Sakura still never surpassed Peak Tsunade  was said during the war that her Baykugo seal is stronger than Tsunade's       It's Kishi projecting his own fears onto his characters again. He worries that his kids might resent him for being a busy ass mangaka.   Really it's just teenage angst. And it all gets resolved in the end anyway so there's no need to worry.      Pretty sure it was just as strong.    Boruto and Himawari are the only known descendants of the Hyūga clan who do not possess the Byakugan. However, according to Masashi Kishimoto, he intended to give them the Byakugan, but forgot to before releasing chapter 700.  http://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2<wbr>014/12/06/27884.html</wbr>      More like he did not give a fuck seeing as he was joking that entire interview.    i swear you whiny faggots acts like you never said shit like that to your parents    He didn't intend. That would go against making Boruto Naruto and Sasuke's lovechild   So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.   Boruto movie coming out before the anime even gets to Madara vs Guy    That makes sense. It's not like his mission finished just because he got screentime again.     THE RIDE NEVER ENDS  How does it feel, knowing that you'll be still watching Naruto when you're 80.         he was joking that entire interview   pretty much this. the movies take about 2 years to make from first concept to release, so he has plenty of time to work shit into the manga to do whatever the fuck he likes, like asspull a byakugan brother for Sot6P which tipped his hand about NH ending being (even more) likely.  burrito/salad designs and their powers were probably pretty solid ca. chapter 650 in mid 2014.          I think most of us have a few times. Usually we got put in our place though. Naruto and Hinata are too lenient as parents and no one dares touch a kid spawned by ninja jesus.  It's the only way he knows how to repent.      She a girl, once she hit her first anything could cause her that much suffering  There are like 3-5 gaiden left  At least it still has anime unlike bleach  So whoe is going to REALLY end first? Naruto or OP           Naruto. Oda doesn't have a stop button.    so the antagonists all are byakugan aliums, some who have rinnegan handeyes as well?     Usually we got put in our place though.  hat makes you think bolt won't?  the whole movie is about him being put in his place        So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.  He doesn't need one. When you are as powerful as he is it no longer affects his daily life. It's his non-dominant arm anyway.      Oda doesn't have a stop button.   implying oda won't literally work himself to death despite (WJS Mandated) On Break Next Week.       It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  sauce was left handed before 698.     Making Hinata mama sad  This kid is shit.     He's ambidextrous.     We all know Oda's "breaks" are just him pumping out the next chapter and getting ahead for when the cassette runs out so they can continue the adventure for that little bit longer.     It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  They both lost their dominant arms, it's symbolism or something     I bet Himawari immediately forgave him cheerfully  then went to her room, burst into treats and cried silently into her pillow/favorite stuffed animal     adult Naruto still has the same voice    He doesn't die, he's this movie's "kidnapped princess", so Sasuke, the 4 other kage and Boruto set out to rescue him.    Bort having ANY of Naruto's moves doesn't make sense.  Even if he's a born genius with the best of both gene pools he's just a regular kid from a peacetime era.  Naruto's entire skill set came from the secret scroll he stole from the ninja FBI, and he was the only one of his generation able to pull off the techniques because he had absurd jinchuuriki battery life.   Rasengan lite is the only high tier technique Bort should have any chance at whatsoever, and that's only because Kishi gave it to Konobodyhamaru on a baseless whim.         so Sasuke, the 4 other kage and Boruto set out to rescue him   Salad doesn't get to come along on their interdimensional rescue mission    Bort gets to make up with his dad and brag to everyone in school the next day about how he killed an alien god       Is that a grill?    No, just a faggot.    tfw the other four Kage are so useless that they get outclassed by a 12 year old who hasn't even finished the Chuunin Exams       Just like dragonball characters. Blame nips.    fuck this edgelord     her favorite stuffed animal is a fox     It's albino Gaara   When can we expect competent subtitles for Naruto: The Last to come out?   B-but he has no Hitler stache.    why is the anime taking so long?    SP and their filler fetish. Their fight is slated to start on July 2nd.    July 22 the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out     Snake clan doing anything for Sauce after he barbecued Manda  Narnians don't HAVE to help nins out, right? Didn't Sasuke even contract with a bird once?     delicious salad booty  Even SP knows    He probably said he was sorry     implying anyone can ever stay mad at the Sauce   He is going on an interdimensional roadtrip with 4 people that were first hand witnesses to his kage summit chimpout.      inojin continues to be best girl      Ino's abomination doesn't look half bad there.     filename  kek  captcha is cake  kek again       Waait a sec.Right center pic.Do those two fuse?     If it wasn't for Chouchou the new InoShikaChou would be the perfect trap squad.     That cake looked delicious, too. Goddammit Bort.    Looks like a standard cake to me bro. It wasn't even that fancy.    Sauce looking dapper as fuck in the top right.    so who is mini-lee supposed to look like? those eyes look a bit unusual. wasn't he supposed to be a few years younger than bort, salad, and inoshakcho 2.0? he has the same radio earpiece as inojin and both are fighting grass nin, so I assume this is chunin exam second portion stuff.      After killing Manda, he still summoned a snake that obeyed him when him, Naruto and Sakura all summoned their creatures while fighting the ten tails.     top right  isn't this a children's movie     His retarded vest looks significantly less retarded if he looks like he has two arms.    He might be 10/10's kid like people thought. Or he might just be some faggot Lee found on the side of the road and shoved into a tacky green leotard.    You could easily salvage half of that cake.    Lee wasn't Guy's kid either, so maybe he's just some random loner    Gaara looks like a faggot with his new hairstyle.    It landed on the plate. most of that shit is salvageable.     Or he might just be some faggot Lee found on the side of the road and shoved into a tacky green leotard.  Most likely option. There are plenty of orphans and there is no mother of the child complaining about the training being too hard on the kid.     God, why does gaara have to look so gay. I mean, he probably is mad gay, but still     so who is mini-lee supposed to look like   Not Ten Ten.  Amd probably not even Lee.        he has the guy/lee eyebrows, but not the lower eyelash thing.  the solid black irises and overall eye shape don't match 10/10 either.  probably just an abducted child.        At least Temari knew she had to tie up that shit    That sounds terrible. I get that hes supposed to be a prodigy or some shit, but if hes anywhere near sasuke or naruto's level thats just retarded as hell. Or is supposed to somehow be both transmigrants at once or have ten tails chakra or some shit like that?    tenten became a wizard, let it go     probably just an abducted child.  kek The eyebrows most likely come with the outfit      Is Boruto being voiced by a woman?    He might pull it off with two arms, but why doesn't he cut the useless sleeve?   Who is Sarada's VA?   Just in case he needs to whip out a roboarm    Hasn't the anime taught you a lesson after all this time?     happy birthday to the ground     or just wear a long coat like back when he was edge surpreme?    A newbie seiyuu.  She voiced toddler Boruto in The Last.      Wait why didn't he get a new arm like Nurudu?    Why couldnt lee have a female clone? Fucking bodysuits are made for girls!   <br/>    dat Salad      the solid black irises and overall eye shape don't match 10/10 either.   both guy and lee had the solid black iris thing going on, but Lee's were larger with his gaping round eyes.  could be lee's kid, but thematically would make more sense to just be a student, but then again, why would lee have been training him in 700 as a presumably pre-genin?   solution: there are actually multiple mini-lees running around konoha now, all taken as war orphans from the aftermath of NWW4.           An old hag.    Sasuke and Chouji were the only ones that lucked out with those.   It'll all be worth it for the new Kana-boon song.   They had to downgrade the Sauce      Maybe hes "hiding" it like a trump card. Could even be an arm full of sharingans!    Anyone else notice Salad looks significantly less cute in the movie?    Everyone looks worse in SP art.    How long until Salad just hates her dad's guts.    From what you hear in the trailer it sounds bretty gud.     Anyone else notice Salad looks significantly less cute in the movie  No?       I dont know whats more retarded a) The fact that there are more Rinnegans b) The fact that Naruto, Ninja Jesus, who moves at the speed of light and can throw ki blasts that destroy entire mountain ranges while being the buddy of all 9 bijuu, is supposed to get kidnapped  I really cant wrap my head around that.       Are you implying she was a carpet muncher? She has never shown interested in vag, only Shikamaru's then underage cock.     Because we haven't seen shots of her emoting yet, though I'm glad there's finally some promotional art that shows her smiling rather than pulling the Sasuke face.       No scan of the characters we actually haven't seen.   Jesus Christ.      I wonder if she'll pop an extra tomoe or two when she sees Bort wearing her hopes and dreams like freshly skinned animals.     Himawari dresses in a bright yellow hoodie  Adorable. And she looks older, too. About as old as Bort did in chapter 700.     It looks like nips really love Salad    It's a Kamehameha wave    I'm just happy (and actually surprised) to see Himawari getting prominent placement on the promo material.  Also, the fact the Sakura survives the Gaiden intact is news to me. I could almost see Kishi killing her off at this point.       It's the path of redemption    Don't expect much, she didn't even get a shot in the long trailer while Tenten and Shino did.    birthday cake of sadness has 6 candles. assuming burrito is about 12 in the movie, they were probably about 3-4 and 9-10 in 700.      that upper left panel  Is he fucking posing with his clones while trying to wrangle a panda out of someone's garden?      Burrito after the move   I think I want to be Hokage.       just kidding!     Maybe it's just a flashback, there is still hope     I guess that means I'll have to fight you for the title, huh?   How about we start with some light Rasendoris before moving onto the heavier stuff?      dunno, but I guess we're supposed to infer that burrito is in like 99th percentile for chakra reserves even if he doesn't have an kurama juice in him, since most genin couldn't even do a single shadow clone without collapsing    Genetics, anon. Genetics. Also Uzumakis were known for having absurd amounts of chakra compared to normal people. Also he's got a wee bit of Kurama juice inside of him thanks to the whiskers, and even a tiny amount of that stuff probably fucktouples his chakra pool.    Inojin and Rock Lee's Kid would be one hell of a duo    Deception is one of ninja's weapons. Enemies, who don't know it, might think twice before attacking, if they think he has two arms.    Inojin looks alot less ugly animated.     dat filename      needing an arm when you have the supreme eye hax    So I'm more than a little confused by the trailer. In one part it looks like Burrito is winding up for a typical Chidori, and then the next second it looks like he just threw a fucking lightning bolt.  And then later on we see him doing a li'l babby Rasengan with two hands. Obviously Kishi wouldn't spoil what his special attack truly was, but I bet it's a mixture of the two. His not-Chidori and his Rasengan.     why do you care about me?   because youre my son ;)  We all know that this is what Sasuke will say      Sakura kept his left arm for the lonely nights so she can poke herself      Daddy issues intensify     He was supposed to wear more baggy clothes, wore a kind of Hyuuga symbol when he was younger and his face is more soft and round, like Hinata's rather than Naruto's. Small details like that are the first to go though. Compare the original sketches of the characters for The Last era and what actually ended up in the movie. Big difference. Then there is also the Byakugan that Kishi supposedly forgot, and the originally lavender eyes he had that later became blue.      chidori and rasengan lite are both the half-ass variants of a nature-infused shape manipulated chakra attack.  that said, rasengan makes sense with wind since the spiral ball storm goes hand in hand with the cutting nature of wind. another form or shape manipulation might suit the piercing nature of lightning chakra better.       I'd be hard pressed to say never. But that's because I have a single mother and she's honestly been pretty chill my whole life.     I worry about my children rebelling due to being a mangaka and having no time for them   finally I managed to finish that massive series that prevented me from spending time with my kids and made me worry about them rebelling   time to make a spinoff series where I express my worries by having the former MC's kid rebel instead of spending time with my own spawn        yfw they pull out some "Oh he just had to awaken the byakugan or He's just been hiding it with a jutsu or contacts or something.     WHERE ARE THE EVIL SPOILERS ??!!!    To be fair in the war they got outclassed by a 16 year old genin too. Standards clearly have been dropping in the time of peace.     Originally Kakashi made the Chidori because he was too stupid to add lightning chakra to his Rasengan.  Maybe this weird pseudo-Chidori is Bort's way around that?  One of the biggest problems with Nurudu's fighting style is how repetitive it got after a while. Nigga only had like 3 moves. It'll be nice to see something new introduced and not get completely overused. Seeing the development process of those techniques is what made them interesting in the first place.        From his interview with Oda, To me it seems like Mangaka have a habit of becoming addicted to their work to the point where they feel very uncomfortable when they're NOT making a comic. Like they just can't bring themselves to chill for a while.    That explains the God of Manga Tezuka.     all this power creep and copy-paste powers  How can anyone like naruto? It's shit.     Is he seriously going to use fucking Shadow Clones? Way to go, Kishi.     He already did it in the Gaiden  He's a prodigy, unlike his father.       I think it's not fair nor funny of you to joke about the death of evil's uncle like that.     Doesn't look like he does them en masse like his dad though.    looks like they're making him special by just being another generic jonin-in-a-genin's body kind of prodigy.    shadow clone or two    rasengan    competent taijutsu and thrown weapon skills   byakugan's just too hard to make interesting combat scenes around, since it completely negates the "look at me surprise you with this attack" thing and is only good for really contrived setups.         I hope Sasuke gets to use his overpowered Rinnengan powers and shit, I've been starved from that shit since Madara jobbed like.. a jobber...   I bet is just going to Chidori and petty shit like that though..      Everyone uses shadow clones, anon. The difference is whether you make 5 of them or 50.    He's a prodigy   learned a variant of Chidori at the age of 12   also learned how to Rasengan without clones at the same time   smashed that shit together and help killed alien Master Blaster  Keikaku fucking doori.           why does it look like gaara?     He already did it in the Gaiden  Naruto used clones to play tag with Bolt, but not much more happened than that. I was referring to Bolt making the finger cross sign thing Nardo always did when using clones. Best case scenario, it's only to add the lightning element to his Rasengan.      evil not posting spoilers either means the chapter is boring, she's busy or she wants people to think it's boring but it's actually a huge bomb    I thought Boruto's clothes were supposed to be a reference to his dad's greatest hero     Not the same anon, but since I don't lurk those forums I had no idea.  I apologize anyway.       Chidori, Amaterasu and Susanoo. Might use his bait-and-switch eyes to get out of a jam or something. Basically shit we've already seen a hundred times with the MS that doesn't require the stupid fucking Rinnegan.   Nigga won't even make a sick robot arm to replace the one he lost in a gay bar fight.      Jashin?     Naruto used clones to play tag with Bolt, but not much more happened than that.   I was referring to Bolt making the finger cross sign thing Nardo always did when using clones   1/2       Actually Minato also wore similar shit. CG's jacket in that pic definitely looks closer to Bort's though.    I was joking anon, get that dick out of your ass, if that was real we would talk about it here more often     yfw she unlock MS through maximum happiness     2/2  He can already use clones, and did it against Naruto when playing tag.      Well, the comparison was never fair. We have known for ages that Naruto was cockblocked by Kuruma when he was a child.     surrounded by bishies while Bolt watches     I dunno, he looks exactly the same as he did in 700.   Maybe SP took some liberties with Bort's design for the movie to make him look more like a child of two people.       Sarada unlocks MS on her wedding day right as she says "I do."     yeah that was revealed by kakashi tree walking and Jiraiya water walking/ frog summoning.    Clone tag looks like fun.    Exactly. Now you can see what kind of shit those genes can do with proper training and without the tsundere demon fox being a dick.     armpits   ZR   Salad is such a semen demon       Her mom dresses her like a slut.    Holy shit I just noticed the intensity of that ZR. Fuck man, they know exactly what they're doing.    Holy shit Bort does have the byakugan    "Remember Salad. Get them staring at your body and in the distraction use your gorilla strength to punch them in the face."    "I cannot write any better than this" in a trailer    He's not exactly wrong. Let's hope the movie is good and Kishi can finally hang up his hat for good.   Wishful thinking, I know.      That's pretty smart. The enemy will never know the itch is actually Amaterasu burning his crotch.    His name can't be Boruto, I thought it's a new meme.    What the shit, Chouchou's not even in this movie?    Na-Ru-To Bo-Ru-To also Yellow Flash Bolt  Thematically it fits, but it sounds awkward in English.          Then you obviously haven't read any naruto since 699.    Boruto is the loanword for Bolt. It's Engrish, basically.   Just like Sarada sounding like Salad.      Doesn't even have a listed VA. No one wants to play a fat nigger.    She probably will, she is apart of InoShikaChou and was on the movie poster.    Himawari is taking up her spot.    and Madara is Maldla    Bolt   Salad   Mitsuki   Konohamaru  I'm okay with this. I even kinda want to see a little more with them all since I already know Konohamaru ain't going to do shit in this movie.       No, Madara would be Madala.    Mandela?    She is, I'm guessing she isn't in the trailer because she's already had more screentime than even Boruto himself in the gaiden.    Then Sarada is Sadala    Since Konohamaru is their teacher does it mean Sarada has a chance to learn Rasengan?    Who do you think taught it to Burrito?    Are you dyslexic, anon?    Like how sasuke learned chidori from kakashi? POTTERY     Then Sadala is Sarad and Madala is Marad    No.    Bitch better get them I want my loli Scorpion goddammit.     dad grew up as an orphan   teammate didn't meet her dad until she was 12   sensei had a hokage relative    He says this:          That's a mistranslation though.    Then Naruto is Nalt and Sasuke is Sazque    that fistbump  It's nice to see that they makeup.    I know what they were going for but just the way it looked it was like "Look guys, I'm sorry, this is the best I can do. Just bare with me."   Why?   Oh good. Best girl made it into the film.     Weeding is a disaster due to everybody looking at her eyes except Sasuke and Naruto   Meanwhile at after life   Madara:Now, this is an Uchiha wedding.       Hinata probably sees a bit of Neji in his anger.     that ending   Duuuude He gonna do rasenshuriken with lightning kek. Prbably also has wind inbued into it       So that alien with the hands is actually a woman? Everyone thought it was a he and Kaguya's husband.    I'm holding on to your words as gospel, anonfriend    Shit, man. I'd be scared to get a bj from a girl that comes from a clan of Fire spitters.    Sometimes when you're raising a kid, they act up, and you're like "What am I supposed to do with this thing?"    Boruto's life is set. High social status, money, and god tier genes.  What the FUCK is his problem? I don't get his shtick, he's a whiny fucking baby. At least his sister is alright, even if Hinata is a shit tier choice for a wife.   The only alright kids are Shikumaru's son, the Orochimaru spawn, and Ino's kid.        Nigga it shows the ball literally one second before that    He's being voiced by Hisoka.     Life is literally GOAT   still complains  Welcome to the Western world aka First World Problems     Do you think Salad will inherit her   Foster   mother's Inner voice? I'm a bit scared to see what combining Uchiha genes raised by the most aggressive woman in existance could do.   Sasuke will find a way to ruin her wedding, like only showing up to be Boruto's best man    No it doesn't retard.    She probably recognizes dissatisfaction at one's father in Boruto. She's sad because she felt it too and doesn't know how to heal the hurt.    Same reason /a/ complains about everything all the damn time.   nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeesssssssss<wbr></wbr>    even if Hinata is a shit tier choice for a wife  Who would you have preferred, anon-kun?      Hinata shit tier  Now why you gotta be serious for half your post then drop the ball right there?     Look at 4chan and tumblr always complaining about everything.    The way it arcs off his hand makes it seem like he threw a lightning bolt or something. Li'l niggas Zeus.    He's a whiny faggot?    Generational pendulum. The same reason why you see so many SJW now.       FUCK YOU FOR THINKING OF THIS    <br/>    That's just a vanilla Rasengan, anon. He can do both apparently.    I'm hoping it will. Inner Sarada will be the only way to activate MS      he has the best father ever who used to spoil him rotten and misses him   Hinata is a shit tier choice for a wife  ah you just have shit opinions, carry on        Those are two entirely different scenes. Boruto is wearing a black jacket when he does that lightning and in that screen he's in an orange.     four arms   four tits      If that's what you think of yourself then yes.   So how does /a/ think the movie will turn out?   Yeah which makes it probably the fusion of both, or a new technique on its and not just a plain chidori. There is no reason for him to use chidori as the main weapon above rasengan when rasengan has always been the better one. Also he doesnt have sharingan or god ninja body yet to use chidori correctly     fingers herself with the arm every night   heals it when it starts rotting      Closeup on Madara smiling because everyone was caught in the inifinite tsukoyomi all along. Isnt it obvious?     why would lee have been training him in 700 as a presumably pre-genin?  Lee probably found him when he was young. Not to mention Guy met Lee before he was even a genin also.  dem parallels        Theres way more things to make fun about like his new Ara~ Ara~ self   what if sasuke gets gravely injured and ends up giving his eyes to bolt instead of sarada. bolt becomes kakashi with god tier genes with EMS and rinnegan while sarada get stuck with nothing   Just to expand on it. I bet sasuke told him he can''t learn sage chara stuff fast enough to use rasenhuriken in the examns and then taught him how to imbue it with lightning which probably makes it safer than the needle things fuuton does    Salad, stop telling us about your nightmares.    I doubt a non uchiha has enough chakra to use EMS/Rinnegan efficiently.    He could definitely use the rinnegan effeciently with enough training just like nagato. see as uzimakis are pretty much chakra batteries he could get more use out of MS than kakashi    Damn Rock Lee's son looks handsome as fuck     Madara is George R.R. Martin    Sauce would have dropped his mission if Sarada was a cute boy.   doesn't train daughter   trains someone else's son   Sakura looks really cute in this movie, she needs to give Sauce a son ASAP so Salad won't be lonely.  So with the new gen a smaller cast will their be decent development if Kishi goes through more with it?           Maybe he threw a lightning rasengan ball?  Yep, that's exactly what it is, when you play it in super slow mo you can see he's making a throw motion and the rasengan ball. And earlier in the clip he's practicing making this technique when he's throwing the mini rasengan.    I honestly hope Sarada wins the chunin exam. I care way more about her than Boruto. Plus her parents all have really cool techniques I hope she learns   fire jutsus and sharingan, Healing jutsu and Robot strength from Haruno, and Uchiha shit from Karin      And earlier in the clip he's practicing making this technique when he's throwing the mini rasengan  You have it backwards, anon. He uses the lightning thing first, and then later on when he's wearing his dad's jacket he throws his Rasengan.     I have a feeling sauce would treat sarada way better if she was a boy he could train and do edgy stuff together with     Burrito hates his dad   Trains under Sasuke so he can surpass Naruto    Salad hates her dad   Idolized Naruto and was inspired by him to aim to become Hokage         I hope if Kishi makes more of this new gen that they stick to a pretimeskip tone because Shippuden is a fucking mess.    The obvious solution is for them to switch kids. Or live together in Nurudu's mansion.  Pink Shit gets to sleep in the shed because she'll end up nuking the place otherwise.      There's enough room for Sauce and Salad to move into the Uzumaki household.   Hopefully Bort grows up to be a chill guy like Asuma. Maybe even take Jiraya's place as a wandering pervert sage.    Salad is so mad that Sauce is spending all his time training boruto   She trains her sharingan more and more.   She levels it up to mangenkyo super fast because she already feels like she lost her father.     Learns how to chakra control punch like her gigaton punch of a mother and becomes virtually unstoppable.         i like how boruto wears naruto's childhood jacket and sasuke's scratched headband at one point    hinata is pretty fucking patient, but I'm pretty sure this would make her snap so hard the eyeball-yanking thing on the moon would look like mild displeasure in comparison     What if some leaf Shinobi think he's a rouge because of the scratched headband and kill him?     Sauce would be gone most of the time anyway   Bort and Salad would argue over who gets the top bunk    Sunflower gets a big sister   Hinata threatens Salad with a fate worse than death if she makes a move on her man   Pink Shit is nowhere to be seen         but chakra punch is so telegraphed it only works if you're practically invisible like pink shit, and salad is already bordering on MC status right now    It's the epitome of POTTERY  And it kinda makes sense because it shows how he still cares for his dad and the headband is a reminder of how much bullshit Nurudu went through as a kid saving Sauce's ungrateful edgelord ass.  Plus he can rub it in Salad's face whenever she comes over.        The exam will be interrupted by Aliens. Also  A woman winning anything in Nardo.  Best she can hope for is a draw.        &gt;Pink Shit is nowhere to be seen   I'm still waiting for the follow-up on Pink Shit's newly revealed chronic weakness deal.       Best she can hope for is a draw  She'll win in the fight against  Inojin.      kek     newly revealed chronic weakness deal  ?      YFW she doesn't or gets a draw so Kishi can hammer it home that she is a loser Uchiha.      Salad wins her match and gets promoted   Bort is about to tear Shikadai a new asshole but since ayyliens appear and his dad bribed the judges he doesn't get promoted to Chuunin      Actually a draw would be hilarious because muh Ino vs. Pink Shit PARALLELS     Naruto bribing.  He doesn't even give his friends loans.     True but she's an Uchiha. Meaning she's probably fast and definitely good at dodging shit. Meaning all she has to do is charge the punch, get in range, and wait for you to slip up.       Naruto   not Shikamaru who's already the Hokage's adviser and brother in-law to one of the judges      Fucking boruto? Wasn't he called "bolt" But japs says "L" like we do "R" and the other way around? So it was just "bolt" but they have wierd habit of saying "o" at the end of some words so it's like "bolto"     No wonder she looked so much like Itachi in that flashback.     Fedor in anime      He doesn't even give his friends loans.  We both know Naruto would have a house built for Sakura if she ever asked. And in fact, he just might do that after the Gaiden ends. Sakura just wanted to tough it out because of low self-esteem, and because she wasn't expecting Sasuke to be gone this long.     Oh god no.    He could have a name like Fish cake or vegetable.     filename  You cheeky bastard     Yes, boruto is an english loanword in moonspeak for "bolt" (as in screw/bolt), but the name was not translated back into english since the manga title itself was always in english, and they wanted to do that writing over the name logo thing.   Post some adult Himawari.   She's going to drive her brother to incest, isn't she?    Gotta keep those eugenics strong, m8.      NH ends up canon two generations in a row       Looks like they'll resurrect Kaguya one more time, I see.  Post butthurt and cuck, please.  Where are the spoilers?  Seems like Hiashi's keikaku is going strong here  god tier genes   Bolt receives training from Sasuke, probably got his own technique which is the combination of both Naruto and Sasuke.   might unlock Byagukan later   inb4 Salad unlock MS without a tragedy        Shame, should have brought back Madara instead.    Nothing yet. Either tonight's chapter is boring as fuck, too juicy to even give an inkling of spoilers, or they knew the trailer hype would overshadow everything.     Boruto would rather run into the woods to beg an Uchiha to train him than have anything to do with the useless jobbers from his mother's side   Bravo Hiashi       Sarada ends up raising the child of Boruto and Himawari     If it's true that Karin is Salad's real mom then that'd mean no Haruno shit polluting the gene pool.    something like this?     She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma.  No, she needs to kill someone she deeply cares about to awaken it.  It's a very specific trauma trigger.       IT JUST KEEPS HAPPENING     she needs to kill someone she deeply cares about to awaken it  She doesn't need to kill them. She just needs someone she cares deeply about to die in front of her.   Someone like pic related.         From the looks of the official pic it seems as if she's going to be just a normal citizen.     Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  The 80's were a different time  Because Araki likes to spice things up every now and a gain   Because your gender prejudice is too strong.      But Part 5 was serialized between '95 and '99.   Forget looking like girls, almost everyone has that same fucking face and build.  Fuck Araki, he sold his drawing talent in exchange for eternal youth.    I think he means the chronology   Early part 5 is arguably the worst art   really the biggest art change happened in Part 4    But mid part 4 was arguably the best    It's set in the 2000s    The worst is fucking 6. I cant believe this isn't general consensus.     There is literally no one in that image that I don't want to fuck in the vagina, wtf?!    To be fair that's entirely possible - he'd been trying to go with a female main protagonist since part 2 but his editors kept cockblocking him so he went "fuck it!" and just made them all reverse traps.  That and part 5 marked the point when he seemed to go more towards fashion models as body shape inspiration.            well, late 4 and early 5.     How is Bruno even standing like this? Are his feet glued to the ground?     this is why I need feminism.      But mid part 4 was arguably the best  that doesn't mean that the art didn't change.     I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  I want to ravage Narancia's boy pussy   I dunno.     Heyzeus's legs help him     I don't think the early 4 panel is representative.    Narcinia is best girl    Late 6 looks like shit, especially Jolyne that looks like a tranny.    The other thread got deleted it seems and there was some decent discussion in it too. Just don't name threads "edition" or "general" anymore, hopefully that will take the heat off.       sounds like the work of a moderator's stand     Are mods really deleting JoJo generals? Fucking finally.   A crack down on generals would severely increase the quality of the board.       What is 「GRAVITY」? Green baby don't hurt me     I thought they were purging them because there are usually multiple up at a time.   While the threads were fun there's nothing to talk about until JJL chapters/EoH trailer/general announcements of a Jojo nature. If jojofags really need a thread at the most have one weekly.  Why didn't Kira just use Sheer Heart Attack in the mansion instead on relying on slow ass air bubbles?   The one holding the knife is actually a girl... right?    A new chapter did just come out and we've actually had some unusually in-depth discussion about it over the last few days despite not even having a text translation yet. I understand why they'd want to get rid of generals but I think it's a real shame it happens just when all the cancer DIO's World brought in is finally clearing up.   That're some manly girls.   /ag/ when?    Nope    Because Araki just forgot.    Apparently the /a/ sings Jojo is going to be starting soon, someone said last thread that Jebus was going to pick it up. We should just stick to those threads.     Never.     Late part 7 is my favourite.    /r/ing an edit with them in the Gangstars' outfits and/or faces.    Early Part 3 was the best.     Because he knew they were aware of how it worked and he can only use one type of bomb at the time.     But Josuke couldn't do anything against it anyway,only Koichi could.   Araki got tired of drawing manly homos so he switched to twink homos.    He could divert it long enough to punch barrage Kira to death if he set something on fire.     Josuke could just punch it and it'd go back to Kira as his hand.    Early and Mid Part 7 was awesome, Araki started to suffer from his sameface syndrome around Late Part 7 and he has never stopped since then.    If he used Crazy Diamond's healing ability, it would go back to his left hand. Also, then he wouldn't be able to do anything offensively in that time period.    Actually at this point there's more variety than there was during either late 7 or the scratch nose era.   can anyone give me name of a music that is played during almost entire the world part from anime?   Darkness of the world i think.    Araki went through a David Bowie phase while writing part 5.     Araki had just learned to draw different faces around mid part 4 only to revert back to his sameface style in the next volume   Truly sad.  I think he hasn't found an equilibrium yet.        He got sick of people comparing his characters and artwork to Hokuto no Ken so instead of manly characters he went the opposite route and made them FABULOUS instead.    i love you     It's more like he didn't have to imitate HnK and buff 80's action stars once they went out of fashion and he became established enough to do his own thing when part 3 ended.     Didn't he lose it with his left hand?    It might just be my fetish for white hair talking, but I don't blame the Japs for liking Fugo as much as they do just because of his design.    I guess that worked out for him because that's what people prefer for him now, I mean fuck look at all the shit he's done since adapting that style.   NEWS ALERT-Actual Discussion approaching  http://jjlscans.tumblr.com/post/122<wbr>355928463/jojolion-44-delay   This month’s chapter is taking awhile because the store is slow to stock this issue and our Day 1 contact is hard to get in touch with this week.    Expect the chapter sometime really soon    Edited for brevity.       </wbr>     Fuck you.    No fuck you leatherman!    I liked the muscle bound style before part 4. Then everyone including Jotaro and Polnareff turned into fruit boys. There's manly fabulous and then there's faggot fabulous.    Both are acceptable as long as the source material is enjoyable. Like LotGH for example. Full of fruit boys, but still a great piece of work.     Early part 1 will always be objectively the worst.      it took me a while but damn.  J♂J♂     How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        I need the pastebin guys    I totally agree with you, Mid Part 4 is beautiful.     calling Jotaro JoJo     In terms of story and characters the first 3 parts were the best, series went to shit after he was forced to make it more mainstream     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     DIO's♂DARK♂FANTASY    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     Jotaro could move for 2 seconds within DIO's time stop   DIO can stop time for 9 seconds (as High DIO)   Jotaro stops time at the 9 second mark   DIO can move for two more seconds (now 11 seconds)   DIO can't move anymore         The youngest JoJo is the relevant JoJo     Implying   tfw Araki will never ever make women as beautiful as in Phantom Blood.      DIO seemingly crushed Jotaro to death before the 11 second mark    Because Araki is a massive faglord, but a cool faglord.    Those are 12 year olds.    I know. It's ridiculous but you just have to go with it. Araki is known for drawing things happening and then having a character say it didn't happen.  Wheel of Fortune burning Jotaro for example and then just saying it was his coat.       not colouring the painting on the wall  lazy colour job      Implying  He started excelling with females at part 4     I love how Araki used to draw women, even before Jojo. Gorgeous Irene is really  gorgeous.     The anatomy's kind of crap but the faces are truly gorgeous. So expressive.      So since they found it necessary to notify us this time I'm assuming we might not even get it this month.  Shit happens and all that and I do appreciate that we get scanlations at all, but I just really want to discuss Karera and Josefumi with you guys.      Looks like early part 1.     Fugo is not blonde  Welp.     Nobody here know enough japanese to translate it?    Yeah, Gorgeous Irene is really wild.    They said to expect it really soon, I don't think that there's anything strange about them giving us an explanation for being a few days late.    It is.    I like it, looks original. I do like Part 8 art a lot but, the sameface is kind of annoying sometimes.     Can someone explain what they're even wearing?    Clothes.    Now here's Gorgeous Irene with the Steel Ball Run art style.    I fucking hate it, how did Araki lose the ability to draw expressions on people's faces?.  Look at this Gyro from mid Part 7       He started diversifying after Paper Moon King, I think it's a telltale sign that he became aware of it.      Now look at this one from Late Part 7, that expression on his face it's terrible, it doesn't look sexy, or intimidating, nothing.     I'll give you late 7 and very early 8 but here's plenty of expression now. Our main character this time is the kind of guy who doesn't show his emotions much to the people who normally surround him, but look at the others around him.      He looks like Iggy before having a human face   Oh God. People really shouldn't be trying this early to guess the designs.  How long do we have to wait an announcement of Part 4 anime?  Like a month ago someone told me to do the phonetically matched lyrics for Jonathan's Ballad. So, uh, here it is I guess.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RwN<wbr>jSwZD8e8</wbr>  [ ]     Awful.    Jojolion Volume 10. We first saw the Iggy promo on a flyer from the Volume.    Please don't use Casca as a reaction image, it'll make me feel bad for fapping to her getting raped.  I wish she enjoyed it as much as I did.    Gyro SAS announced.   I'm pretty curious to see how he'd draw him now. Karera gets a lot of really good panels in this month's chapter and her thick eyebrows reminded me of her a bit.    That's pretty nice, i love the song and Jonathan.    Damn, that's fucking nice, It makes me really appreciate Johnathan.    As dorky as it is to say, I understand why the guy yesterday said Jonathan was his favorite Jojo now.    Jonathan has always been my favorite Jojo     tfw we'll never get an OVA/HFTF The World    This should have played when Jotaro kill DIO.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yqt<wbr>JqKgemw4</wbr>  [ ]     Making the video was such a treat for myself as well because Jonathan is also my favorite JoJo.     No Diego SAS   No Shadow DIO SAS   You'll never have 5 different Dio SAS figures        Jonathan is the kindest and most gentle JoJo in the entire series. He's Kenshiro if he wasn't so stoic.    Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?   I would let Diego fuck my ass<br/>     Where is the Pucci SAS, and the Whitesnake     Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?  That's like an anon if they breathe air.      no diego  it hurts.    At some point he played so much with the clothes that forgot the faces.   They did say they were doing more villain part 5 SAS then they'll move on to 7. Have hope anon.      Can't unsee young Dio      Italian civilian clothing To blend in     YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DIO? NO, IT WAS I, IRINE.     No, this is Dio.     Purest Jojo didn't deserve that fate   New Redundancy Chapter  Spoilers  &gt;Lucy of admission first day prequel (Ranoa magic academy)  Born the last 2 daughters of Rudy (Lily and Christina Greyrat )   In the Family gatherings they decided to send their children to Ranoa academy.   Lucy First day in the School   Overprotective Rudy as father   Lucy go alone to the school and Rudy   wants to follow his daughter, but Sylphy stops him  He go to President's place and tells his worries   Orsted lend his helmet and outfit to Rudy   to follow his daughter  when leaving Kalman III calls him, he is a baka and dont discover that he is Rudy   After that, Kalman III enter in the office, elf-chan tells that he is rudy, and he think that is a plan to lure the enemy dressed as Orsted              End of the chapter      Finally its the kids turn, awaiting our Saviour Lara   Bump  Kalman seems pretty moe.  need more harem moment with the wives  Part of me wants the guy to begin writing his new story  whether it be the Akihito one or the one outside the MT verse     When does he start that?   I just read to the part where Rujierd is smuggled onto a boat do things get real anytime soon?    Why would Rudy want his kids take public school straight out from medieval times when he has access to 'common' knowledge from hundreds years of a more advanced world.    Cause Goddess of Wisdom is a teacher at that school.    To make connections and friends like him (He met zanoba, ariel, cliff, nanahoshi, cat and dog)    How old is Lucy in this chapter?      seven    After the labyrinth.    were not getting progress reports on the kids magic are we?    Pretty Sure All the kids will reach advanced in multiple areas and hopefully Lara can at least match Roxy in combat. Seeing as she's semi telepathic it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say she can do chantless magic   On Kaezars website and made a list of stories he plans to make.  "Going to the Holy Land of Swords once again" Well that's going to be potential awkward. Sorry Nina kind-of killed you father-Eris     I have a feeling Eris and Nina will be more concerned about bragging about there families.  my husband is 6th! So what me and my husband took down a ancient war god of legend!      Are these stories in sequential order?   or perhaps they will talk about arranging marriage between their child   Just finished http://ncode.syosetu.com/n1222ci/ Up to ch 2 is translated for those interested. It is quite good , the fights well done and the party isn't just him bringing his harem around(though he does have 3 girls going after him).  MC is summoner.He deleted his own memories so he can have LVL S summoning skill .He can have up to 9 summons, with +100 stats bonus to his pets and him being able to contract anything as long as the other one wants.Later he lvls up wind/earth magic and scythe skill(to use with rank S magic scythe) 1)Angel/Goddess , looks like a Valkyrie.She said he seduced her but like she herself said she just wanted a break after more than a thousand years of hard work.Infact while she teases him about MC confessing to her she never really goes after him even after he can finally summon her avatar around lvl 80 2)Slime. Ranks up in gigant black slime. Second strongest summon since it can sacrifice energy accumulated in its storage(weapons, armors or bodies) to make a beam or self explode divided parts of him.Is even used as weapon storage by party members during battle by hiding small parts of it in guantlets 3)Black knight,after he ranks up in dread knight he gets a physical body. Got defeated by the slime's beam while distracted by MC. Is a bro (and probably a lolicon) (not a summon=Then he gets an half elf slave who got a fire dragon king curse. He reverses it in a blessing. She combines fire magic and archery. She may be half dragon half elf (daughter of fire dragon lord ) but according to lore it should not be possible. Since son of said fire dragon lord appears as human's pet the former one could have got killed by them and elf's mother raped) 4)Demon principess sealed by her maou father a few centuries ago. He unsealed her after fighting one former maou general who wanted to unseal her and absorb her powers to kill the present maou and be king.Specialises in fist fighting and can fly with her wings(looks like a succubus)<br/>             (not a summon)With the suggesstion of Goddess he summons an hero since there are enemies who can be only hurt by them.Specializes in acrobatic fights with the help of a shadow wolf.The so called 3 sword style(wolf using one).IS basically an imoutou to MC(not aiming for his D) 5)Shadow wolf, he usually hides in the hero girl's shadow He still has 4 more free spots to use.        Isn't that another one of those series where the protagonist starts off week, but becomes essentially the strongest in like 2 weeks? Stuff that like bizarrely annoys me.    Stop reading shitty escapism webnovels. If you continue this might actually get really popular and we will get another shitty anime like Mahouka or SAO.    Needs more FeMC anime.    While he does get strong really fast (even faster than the 4 heroes called one year before him) the fights are really well made and realistic with each party member doing its part. Though a bit more plot related stuff only started to come out towards the end (is at ch 111)    Arus and Nina's baby? What a twist    Inbreeding between idiots? Would that not be dangerous?   So the chapter about it being about Aisha's marriage was a lie after all?  I want Aisha to marry   a clone of her brother   or maybe   be MILF maido for Akihito       I need more fantasy WNs with QT grill MCs instead.    especially ones with lewd undertones   dragon bloodline   ogre village   100 ogres wanted to fuck her           https://darkfishoftherevolution.wor<wbr>dpress.com/2015/06/24/she-professed<wbr>-herself-the-pupil-of-the-wise-man-<wbr>chapter-20/ http://www.sousetsuka.com/2015/06/d<wbr>eath-march-kara-hajimaru-isekai_24.<wbr>html</wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr></wbr>  Guess I'll post these here.   And, guess who finally got an illustration.   I wish Sun Knight translations would finish up already.   Dude that one blind tiger chick nice forgot her name    Forul was surprisingly more feminine looking than I thought. I always had the image of him as being more muscular in my head.     That Fohl  No wonder Naofumi tried to fuck him     Spear looks hilarious with those filorial feathers Is sword being chuuni with that mask or part of a curse?     Oh yeah, and MT volume 7 is finally arriving in August.  http://mfbooks.jp/3167/      White haired loli by the way is a new character and uses scissors.     Oh shit. Misremembered his name. Well, at least I know Atla is named Atla.   I think it's part of his bandit lord disguise when he was being corrupt? Not sure if he continues wearing it or if this is just for his arc? Don't know what the story is for the LN, anyway.   She from their world or from the other world?           Only know that her name is Sein and that she may be a scissors hero.I guess hammer will be turned into blacksmith tool instead of hero weapon. Or maybe both.It would be nice if MC's favourite blacksmith got it.    Speaking of which, is anybody here going to be purchasing the published LN of shieldbro?    Don't think all the stories will come out in the same order the author listed them.     A question. I haven't read Tate Yuusha, but I have been reading the author's new Narou work about the protagonist being the only one able to return to Earth. And it's complete garbage and is pretty poorly written. Am I wrong to think that Shield Hero, his previous work, can't be any better written? Or is it that everyone likes the light novel version of it that went through an editor?      Here illustration  I will probably buy it when my brother gets to aru majutsu so that we spend less money with international shipment.      That work is shit, just read tate no yuusha skip a few SOL chs about village building and then when final battle starts just read the last 3 chs.    I pre-ordered the first two for now. I'll decide on the quality of the first one if I'll continue (most likely yes, though; since I see no hope for a LN translation).    This thread needs more Atlas.   It's just Atla, isn't it? I remember the 's' being added by mistake by some people.     I don´t like much atlas hair(the cut) specially the front     Yes, it's just Atla. Her name is アトラ, whereas Atlas would be アトラス.    Atla´s*   All Arifureta illustrations here, at least they are good compared to plot. http://imgur.com/a/GNSTn    Rape time.    Oh my, that switch from cute and innocent to edgy as fuck.   Also, it's dripping, how led.       I will never not be able to bitch about how this asshole with no knowledge of gunsmithing randomly built 100% reliable super advanced magic railgun revolver and anti-materiel rifle plus rocket pods by himself. On his first try, without even any trial and improvement on rough first attempts. And the process isn't even described to us to try and justify it, it basically just says "btw made built a revolver called Donut and he uses his electrical power to make it a railgun too"  It reads like a ten year old wrote it.      The epilogue biography chapter mentioned that Rudy's thesis on chantless magic led to most people being able to use it so I'd imagine all of the kids would be able to.    Guess Takayaki alone was worth the money.    That actually looks pretty good.    The first volume of Arifureta is good. It's just the rest is garbage.  Artist is pretty based, though.      He lost his eye through some laser shit from some freaky hydra fuck, so why is there a knife scar.    Can someone insert heart pupils here? It is my fetish.    Apparently, aside from being into manga/anime, he's also a gun otaku.  I know, I know, those are some pretty weird range of interests. But in all the time I've lurked on /a/, I found that there was a surprising amount of intersection between people who are interested in manga and people who are interested in guns/army stuff (most recent reminder being the JSDF Gate manga). There was that MC from I Am A Hero, too, so that just reinforces my impression. I don't even understand the reason why there's such a crossover.       I don't even understand the reason why there's such a crossover.  Guns are moe.     There's a long, long way from being a gun otaku and being a gunsmith.  How many /a/nons could actually make an anime?      Ah yes. You've reminded me of Kancolle and Girls und Panzer. And I'm pretty sure there's a manga about girls who are guns who are girls. I know I read a few chapters of a story like that, anyway.    He must have a degree in automotive engineering too, to be able to make an SUV that's more complicated than "box on wheels and magic makes wheels spin". And that bike too. Also the submarine that nobody noticed he was building even though the harem is with him 24/7.   Upotte        There's a long, long way from being a gun otaku and being a gunsmith.  Well Hajime's transmutation lets him basically reform and restructure metal and minerals at will, so I guess that lets him skip a lot of steps when it comes to crafting prototypes and shit.  That said, it's bullshit that his first attempt worked out so well.       Didn't he just use the magic of the materials he was using to supplement his designs?    "box on wheels and magic makes wheels spin"  What else did he need to know besides that anyway? I mean. The thing was entirely operated with magic, so. Same with the submarine. Were there any functions that couldn't be explained with "magic"?         That said, it's bullshit that his first attempt worked out so well.  M-Maybe the LN editor fixed shit like this?     I'm pretty sure it says it took him a lot of trial and error to get it right.    Ah, found it.   When he read the description, he felt a thought develop in his brain. This stone may play a similar role to gunpowder. If this was the case, then he could create a weapon with extreme firepower with his transmuting. Hajime was excited. There was going to be a lot of trial and error. The amount of effort needed to design it would not be small. Even though his transmuting had saved him many times before, it still lacked a real means of attack; the idea that he would get a real weapon had him rejoicing.    Ten days have passed since he ate the wolf, and finally he had succeeded producing his project.    With an attack that could exceed the speed of sound for a short distance, it was a modern weapon with great firepower. Overall length was 35 cm, it had a revolving magazine that held 6 bullets made from Tauru Ore; the hardest known ore in this area. The barrel was elongated. Bullets were made using Tauru Ore as the projectile and compressed powdered Combustion Stone was the propellant. Oversized revolver would accurately describe the firearm. Combustion Stone was not the only explosive to propel the bullet. Using his “Lightning Clad” skill, he could produce electromagnetic force to help accelerate the bullet; like a small rail gun. This equated to a power that was 10 times stronger than an anti-matter rifle. He called it “Donner”. Hajime wanted to have a partner to rely on.           This. As long as he powers everything with magic a car is way easier than a gun.He just has to make those stupid wheels work , make them slightly change direction and put brakes.     I'm pretty sure it says it took him a lot of trial and error to get it right.  No, this is what it said.   This stone may play a similar role to gunpowder. If this was the case, then he could create a weapon with extreme firepower with his transmuting. Hajime was excited. There was going to be a lot of trial and error. The amount of effort needed to design it would not be small. Even though his transmuting had saved him many times before, it still lacked a real means of attack; the idea that he would get a real weapon had him rejoicing.

This equated to a power that was 10 times stronger than an anti-matter rifle. He called it “Donner”.    “I did it! With this I will be able to deal with that monster!”   All the development from initial planning to proof of concept to prototyping to field testing to debugging to revision to reprototyping to field retesting to further debugging to further revision and back again was finished in one sentence. Actually, he never even field tested it, he just finished it and said "yeah this'll do it".  And I hope they meant "anti-materiel rifle" and not "anti-matter". But even then I'm skeptical. "10 times" sounds like a number the writer pulled out of his ass, like a child in the playground.                 Man, anon, I already saved you the effort.     Ten days have passed since he ate the wolf, and finally he had succeeded producing his project.   I doubt it took 10 days to try make a single attempt.       proof of concept to prototyping  With his transmutation power, these two steps are basically one and the same. Creating a gun-like weapon, with prepared explosives and material, with the power to instantly transmute the materials into the desires shape, wouldn't be too difficult, if you already know the basic mechanics of a gun.  The end result of the fire-power, and "rail gun" part though is complete bullshit, unless his Lightning Clad actually lets him control magnetic fields at will.   "anti-materiel rifle" and not "anti-matter"  Probably translators being stupid.   Transmutation powers pretty much means "making" it is the easiest part, without having to worry about manufacturing issues.               Before this goes any further   Care to restate your statement? Any additions you'd like to make to it?  Because we can all agree that it IS lazy, but that it does not mean that it only took 1 try, as the other anon is saying. The prior statement within the quote, that there "was going to be a lot of trial and error" together with the timeskip, gave the implication that prototypes and test runs were carried out. It would be silly to assert otherwise. However, saying that it's a unsatisfactory way to describe how that development came about? More reasonable. People would concede that.           I guess I may as well start with how we're never shown any of what he went through in those ten days.  How did he start off design it? What real revolver did he use as the model? We're not told.  How did he decide on the optimum barrel length? Optimum bullet shape and size? Fineness of the granules used for the gunpowder substitute? Rifling pattern? Balance between weight and power? We're not told. Were there any accidents or setbacks during the development and testing? We're not told. Did he draw his design anywhere or was he relying entirely on memory to retain the whole design as it changed over time? Oh, right, we're not told! The text heavily implies he never actually tested it against a monster, because the very next chapter the rabbit he kills seems to be the first victim of the bullshit gun. How did he test his gun? How did he quantify the results so he could improve on previous revisions? We're not told. How does he know that it's exactly ten times stronger than an antimatter rifle? Has he ever been within ten feet of an antimatter rifle? Nope, we're not told.  Compare to Gun Ota which is also trash but which puts some effort into suspending our disbelief by walking us through some of the steps of crafting an S&amp;W M10, from the history of firearms design to the rationale behind his choice of gun.              Fuck yea..............Oh wait August is two more months from now......fuck!!!!!!! Was hoping they could have at least volume 8 by the end of the year    See, there we go.  Remember that this line of discussion started with  this post right here. I understand that the essence of your feelings is your dissatisfaction with how the story proceeded through this development with such hazy details, but it's best to make yourself clear and to differentiate yourself quickly or else a post like this  just shows people that you're ignoring a flaw in the original position. It's not the crux of your argument, yes, but it's important to acknowledge it so that you can move away from it.  Returning to the actual subject; I enjoy such comprehensive attention to detail as well, but I don't think it takes much away from the story. Certainly, there are times in the story when I feel that the narrative is way too brisk with its treatment of the characters' development and interactions (especially around the time they meet Shia, yes, and as of late), but I feel that is a separate matter from this. This part of the story's entertainment value is more about mixing-and-matching disparate abilities and exploiting them to terrible effect. It's lacking in explanation, but well, can't be helped. That's just the sort of story it is.            It's just lazy writing. The author likely has a fascination with guns, but doesn't know the first thing about creating/designing one. So he skipped all of that, and just described what kind of gun it was, and how strong it was supposed to be, even if it was unreasonable as fuck.     even if it was unreasonable as fuck.  See, that's what I'm speaking of here.  What's unreasonable about it?      So, now that this season is drawing to a close, who was the best girl featured this season and why was it Cyan?  Shuri Shura Rai is brettygud.   As expected of fire element.    This. I have been downloading it, but my heart still isn't ready.   I think I'll actually cry this time at that scene where Retoree learns the truth about Cyan.       This fuccboi, goddamn. Are their songs good? I am very slowly wetting my feet with the non-anime songs.    I love that Arashi is the lead singer.  And yes their songs are great. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hyT<wbr>kl6dLXE0</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aNT<wbr>4S-rHK8E</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Ey<wbr>v5xEQoBY</wbr>  [ ] http://cdn.sbr-vcj.com/download/Sou<wbr>nds/Bgm/music_06_004.mp3?version=1.<wbr>mp3</wbr></wbr>        Oh boy  Goddammit  since i didnt watch negima,the part where touta says who she will fall for kinda hurts    So good. UQH should have been a spin-off solely for Eva.   Post the rest of the chapter.       Captcha sucks, so no      theres an option to use older captcha in settings. no more 'select all pizzas'     Should read X's changelogs more     Keep going.     Who is he talking about?    Negi/Nagi, but she met Nagi first so she thought he's the one and fell in love with him    So he likes or not?    Eva is so moe and love.    <br/>    So basically Eva thought she was in love with nagi cuz of touta's words?    I really wish for her to experience Motherhood.    Slut   I can already see it... Eva get's her memories from the rift She sees touta they kiss (probably not) the end super not obv        he has double personality or what is he talking about?    How did he mistake her ID when he clearly knows the bitch? See the mangaka fucking around with pairing and harems again and doesn't learn from past mistakes. Like the bitch was already shot down by nagi and if anything was ever going to happen between her and negi it would of been happened, so what's the point of keeping loli Eva forever alone?   Fucking touta cucking his own self! Why is he such a bitch, like one moment he's crying for three days straight about how she treated him and how he noticed she looked at nagi/negi, but the moment he confessed he back tracks for no reason and then starts to hype the fuck out of two guys who doesn't even want her.  Fucking drop   Because Touta has serious self esteem problems due to being a clone and feels he can't comparet to Negi in anyway. So why try to win her when he know she will be happier with Negi. Him growing over that shit is part of his character development and won't be easy to do.    He is clearly talking about her future self.    Fucking Touta man. He really is an idiot. I know he has good intentions but this is both heartwarming and infuriating at the same time.    How can she be happy with negi when negi doesn't want her? And for him to grow he actually has to stop feeling inferior and stop running away from his feeling.   The way I see it the mangaka just wanted to throw in another unnecessary twist into the story (which wasn't needed at all and didn't help progress the story in any way) just to play with touta/negi/nagixevafags and now he's decided to sink the toutaxeva ship just niw he can build up on the other three ships he built for touta. The gender bender ship, the loli tsundere ship, and the yaoi ghost ship.  Honestly that's why I don't like dealing with action harems (or harems in general) they usually make no sense at all and leaves you exactly where you started at in the first chapter when it comes to romance.         Honestly that's why I don't like dealing with action harems (or harems in general) they usually make no sense at all and leaves you exactly where you started at in the first chapter when it comes to romance.  You've been reading the wrong harems.    So will anyone post the rest? Or at least direct me where to find it?   Its in the folder as usual   Where is Negi?, did some girl win?   Touta doesn't really know much about Negi. As far as he knows he is his super cool grandfather that Eva and Fate love and Touta assumes that Negi can make Eva happy. Compared to someone like him, Touta just assumes Negi will always be the better choice.   Ending it like this is a bit disappointing, but it's realistic. The issues Touta has are not things you deal very easily, and the fact he admited he loves Eva is a good step for the boy. Now he has to grow into believing that he is worthy of her love too.     Yeah, the Lifemaker did.            What you mean with that? What is the folder?       So does Touta just plain turn magic attacks back on their user in some weird twist of antimagic and magia erebia?      Since Touta has both Magia Erebia and magic cancel does that mean Negi married Asuna?       Destruction left   Negation right  Reminds me somewhat of a certain Onii-sama        That actually might be how it works, it looks like Touta used ME to absorb the magic attack Dana did and transformed it into anti-magic power to banish Dana from the Rift. So I guess he learned Counter?   Now, it means he might be the clone of some Negi and Asuna clones.    It reminds me of GaoGaiGair, so I hope that Touta learns how to HEAVEN AND HELL!          He's a clone, probably made from Negi and royal blood magic. Not literally an offspring          is page 7.   page 8   page 9   page 10   page 11   page 12                           Pretty badass technique.          No, Touta is some clone of Negi, they probably spliced in some of Asuna's genes because why not. Looks like Negi can't have/never tried to have kids.  inb4 there are Negi clones with the genes of all of class 3-A      And that's it.  Thanks to the mega guy like usual.  https://mega.co.nz/#F!CAlXEY7L!cooK<wbr>ERhviytsGX16p2iVMg</wbr>        Where is my negi/nodoka or yue clone?     Graduation Certificate  I miss Jack.     What would his finishing move be called? Yin-Yang?    Too easy Eva, too easy.    So I wonder what will Dana do with Kitty here, I feel she will have Kitty train Touta some more.   Anon, she is pure, and she just learned about Love.       Eternal Touta Fever!   Kitty is a cute name    Anon, she is pure, and she just learned about Love.  Even so, she's still too easy.     Negi/Chisame, Negi/Ku-Fei, Negi/Setsuna, Negi/Konoka clones when?    Not like she was any better in Negima, Eva has always been bad with her personal feelings.    You putting it like that I can accept but that's only if he actually does man up and realizes that. If he just let his so call love for her just fade then I doubt he actually did love her and maybe it was just more of fear of losing her.    Well I guess that's true, the way she fell for Nagi was just about the same.    Ok then name two good harems where it was actually done right?    What the fuck happened to Jack anyways?    Not giving a fuck on Mars I guess.    Well, the core of this arc for Touta is his relationship with Eva, and how to mend it, so I feel that we will get some progress on that font by the time the Tournament ends.    I know, I guess Touta will have to teach her of other kinds of love or something.    Probably still in Inverse Mars or something.          He's probably somewhere in Mundus Magicus doing fuck all.   Rakan should have been the one to take care of Touta.   I doubt it tho, the relationship problem seemed kinda forced so by the end of this arc we will be right back to where we started with their relationship.    I don't know about that. Dana is pretty funny and captures a fair bit of what made Jack great.    Jack will come back and teach Touta the way of locating women by sniffing their panties when the time comes. Dana is good for now.    No, Touta still hasn't solved his issues with Eva, mainly that he feels she cares for him because of Negi, so the core of the problem is there. So for their relationship to be restored, Touta must learn that Eva really cares for him, just as he cares for her (and that's why it was important here that he learned to accept he loves her [whatever that love might be]).    I dunno, he might have made Touta more of an idiot, maybe it's for the best Dana took the kid. At least she will make him to learn beauty and style, as fitting for a vamp.        He wants to protect that smile, but knows he can never be the person the REAL Eva smiles at       I meant raising him as a child, not what's going on right now.      Mmm, it might be a cool idea, I know that Jack wouldn't mess as much as Eva has done recently with Touta. That guy was way smarter emotiaonally than Eva.    If Fate raised Touta, would Touta inherit Fate's homolust for Negi?    Oh of course that will be solved (or at least I hope) but what I mean is she will not like him like that and he will bow out for negi and just accept the role as a brother and things will go on as if it never happen, and thus allowing other ships not to be sunk (even when he will end up with nobody)    And you bet your ass touta'd use it with that name.   Honestly though Eva is perfect without the romance seeing her act all cutesy kinda ruins the Evatroll. She should be left alone for all eternity not getting with anybody, her character shines best when she's just being Eva not a lovestruck Harem Girl #02378   Knowing Ken, he will bring back the Eva ship somehow, the man is good at this, so sadly I don't think this is the end of things. But yeah, I honestly don't expect things to work out romantically for Touta at the end of this.    Nah, because Fate would have raised Touta as an anti-lifemaker weapon and nothing more.... or he would have raised Touta as the son he and Negi never had, so Touta.   Kitty is a more innocent Eva, before she got the time to developed the thick armor that allowed Eva to be Evatroll in Negima. Plus even in Negima Eva could be pretty bad about her feelings like here.          And that's why i just wish Akamatsu won't end Eva with somebody else. Her character's perfect as a mentor not a love interest. That's what made her great in Negima she acted normally with Negi treating him as a child if she somehow develops feelings for anyone those interactions might be reduced to blushing and the usual Tsundere BS.  Romance ruins Battle Manga whether you like it or not. People tend to get more invested in the romance subplot instead of the actual plot. And it invites waifufags and the likes.  Her character should just be left alone till the end without getting with anybody. Stay as an immortal loli with a haughty attitude.       We all do anon.  ;_;     What the fuck will it take to kill the Lifemaker?    Wanting Eva alone for all eternity.   Just awful.      Magic Cancel, meaning that Touta or Asuna will be the ones to do it.    But then when there is no romance it makes all the male characters seem gay, like any guy who chooses fights over female seem pretty gay. Now the real problem to me isn't the romance it self but how it's handled and battle manga with harems does it the worst of all. All they really have to do is set a fix girl and not throw in unnecessary drama and love rivals to make it cool.    Eva would be great as trolldere.   Imagine he gets out of the rift and Eva really did remember him all along. It'll alternate between her teasing him even harder than before, and her still blushing furiously at certain things because she's still got no personal experience with romance.      Considering the Yin-Yang motive, it probably is.   Is UQ holder follow the same story line as negima? I'll probably read negima if that's the case since the anime sucks dick.    Nnnooooooo why must he be such a douche! And I will never understand the point of harems with no end game, they basically have no point at all. And yeah touta will end up exactly like negi, years later he still doesn't have a girl, is still working under Eva , and is OP.   (And even if I didn't original start reading for the romance if touta doesn't end with anyone I probably won't read another series from this mangaka because I refuse to read another battle manga with a harem.)      Don't the manga isn't much better then the anime you will be disappointed expecting better.    what would you have a Tsundere Eva with shitloads of blushing and acting all cutesy ?  Kuromaru will be the end girl for Touta, Negi and Fate has the Homolust covered  Eva is fine as an immortal loli vamp who knows nothing about love her blushing is fine if it's for a short while and it happens rarely that's what makes it special/bearable if it happens often the novelty of it wears off and you'll have your so called Harem Girl #02378.   And I will never understand the point of harems with no end game  You probably never read Negima   Harem    end game  you can only choose one anon. Stop being stupid and you don't read a battle manga for romance if you want romance go read sum Shoujo shit. That's where your kind belongs              Negi Yotsuba would be the most powerful.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were not clones but test tube babies. In order to get the most out of Negi and his army of invincible school girls you could make one child from him and one of the girls and then blender that one, and produce a child using it's DNA and a 2nd member of 3-A.     For a 'clone' they fucked it up a lot.  He doesn't even look like negi.    I never said I read it for romance, I just said the MC be more or less gay when all they care about is fighting and friendship. And that makes a series worse to me but you don't need full romance he'll look how fucking akira did it, he just threw chichi on that nigga goku and didn't really worry about the relationship aspect that much. And why does anon say I've never read negima(which I have)    They seemed to want to 'clone' his power rather than the man himself.    Don't project your own feelings on her. In this very chapter we see that in her youth, Eva even contemplated getting herself killed over the prospect of a future alone.  In Negima, we see one timeline's Eva abandon her life there to travel through time seeking love.  She doesn't want to be alone.        Well he didn't show up to the final battle with Negi and the others. Maybe he dead.  ;_;      He is a clone of a clone, plus he probably was mixed with someone other than Negi.     Lets combine these, shall we?      Punctuation on a separate line   Literally worse than Hitler.      He should learn to shut bitches in a middle of a emo swing with a kiss.    nice     I wouldn't be surprised if they were not clones but test tube babies   Yeah, I thought it was pretty clear that they're different blends, since they don't look like Negi and are called his grandkids. I figure Touta's parents really are his parents - as in, they really did provide the base genetics. Leaning on the way they call him Negi's grandson, I'd guess he's at most 1/4 Negi-derived, and at most 1/4 Asuna-derived.   If they Konoe clan is trying to make an anti-Lifemaker weapon, trying to get Asuna's magic cancel, Negi's magic talent, and Konoka's magic capacity all in one might have sounded like a good idea at the time. The problem is that there are a bunch of possible results that won't work (Touta, apparently), or might become dangerous in general (Touta becoming a mindless magia erebea monster), or would be an excellent new host body for Lifemaker to hijack (Negi's magic and Konoka's mana capacity).  I would also assume that this is plan B. A team based around Negi and Asuna themselves, plus support, should be able to beat Lifemaker - and DID, in one of the Negima ending timelines - but they're not available in this timeline.          thanks anon.    Nagi. Obviously    That's Nagi he's talking about, not Negi. Eva never loved Negi.     Does Touta even know about Nagi?      So this is his finishing Move.      clon war when?   Never      No, this is    somtimes touta looks quite old.   nobles are more civilized than anyone else in this manga and its prequel   Yes, Ikkuu talk about him. the yukihime´s love interest    Eva´s hell is the loneliness. I don´t want to end up alone. But it hasn´t to be a romantic relationship. A family is fine.     I don´t want to end up alone  you are not alone. you have us       Beat her off.  Hue.      You are (not) alone     Thanks guys.    Well either way it's still bad.    Eternal EVA FEVER ??      Am I the only one who thinks that he earned a lot of points with this move? Seeing as Eva would have been disappointed if he had answered that he was the one.       I wonder if current Eva remembers him.    Evangeline hope centuries by a redheaded that not love her. Good job Touta.  So, Eva is certainly pure     Hopefully they will have 700 years of sex.      I know why you are doing this, and I respect it and all but holy shit man, stop hurting yourself.      They can't hurt me anymore, they have played plenty enough with my feelings     Eva´s faces are the best.    I literally forgot this series existed.   I'm not satisfied, Akamatsu. There were some bright moments early on but I'm rather upset right now. How many chapters does this make, anyway?    I guess we know why Eva fell for Nagi. Also calling Dana a "last boss" was hilarious. Dat cliffhanger, can't wait for next chapter.     She is in love with nagi because Kuromaru wins the toutabowl and she couln't have touta.    Kuromaru will win the asuna zone.   "I mean sure, there's gonna be some cloudy days and some storms, but when the the rain stops, your tomorrow will be filled by blue sky" Yes, the wind is nice today, the ship is sailing smoothly...   Guys go read hentai harems like Cheers! if you want some relief.    I literally forgot this series existed.  I dont believe you m8.    If I where an inmortal I would fuck loli eva all day every day so she doesn't feel alone.   of course she does, that's why she want to keep him away from danger and has been taking care of him.    what where the nobles doing on the two previous crisis of reality, with the MotB trying to fuck eveyone up forever and all that?   yfw the MotB is just ana verage noble.       Dana said that the other nobles don't give a single fuck about anything, Dana was probably doing Dana things.    No, it's true. I literally forgot that UQH was a series and hadn't thought about it in about a month or two, and when I saw this thread and skimmed a few images I found myself wondering whether this was a monthly or a weekly manga.   I barely even remember the Big 3 nowadays. The only ongoing weeklies I'm reading religiously are  Hayate the Combat Butler  and  Boku no Hero Academia       nice blog dude.    I think i Know what happens next. like santa and co touta has to fight someone. I gues the Uq holder noble     Poor Touta, doesn't realize that the reason why Eva went after his ancestors is because he told her to. He had already stolen her heart many hundreds of years ago.    I bet Dana will seal her memories.     That does not make sanse     sorry got it wrong i meant     i bet that not. She just doesn´t want to tell Touta.   is Jack a last Boss?   Mini-boss at best.     Why not? I don't think Dana's cruel enough to make Eva remember about him and maybe hoping to meet Touta again for more than hundred years.    who think that this finished in ToutaxEva in the end??   I would prefer it before the end of Negima.     Guy Dana said Touta is evas man of destiny. Second its the opposite of cruel.  Here she realizited that touta and her ar from different places.    I think you can put together the dots just fine.           It'll end with Touta finally ending Eva's life.    Touta will die first.    meh, reminds me too much on judo with the whole "use the force of the enemy against him"     i doubt that they dead easy     Touta kill Eva when Negi fucks with one women.    I'm sure he has tried. I mean it's not like they would know that he couldn't have children if he had tried.     she acted normally with Negi treating him as a child if she somehow develops feelings for anyone those interactions might be reduced to blushing and the usual Tsundere BS.  this man knows     Shut up judo is awesome.    Sure. Fate can´t have children.     implying there is no other way to know that.     It is but Toutas ability is just straight like judo, nothing original really. I hope he can use the Gravity blade later on to pull enemies to him or to suck in light and load it.  Negi already had a judo-like style by being able to use his own offensive force to empower himself at the cost of his health.      yea but it looked more like a basic technik. he will use the basic and expend on it. negis first magic arts were kind of lame. But he made them awesome.         nice job      When I see this page the FF 9 battle theme instantly pops up in my head    Are you me?   Eva, Negi and Touta are family.   That's Touta, an idiot that will never win. He ruined his best chance for love.    But Nagi rejected her. And we don´t know if Negi love Eva. So she only has Touta.    isnt that Aikido?    I stoped reading when some before some necromancer was going to destroy the world with a hikkikomori, dunno what chapter was that.    But he could have won right there, before the competition appeared, was it so hard?    Akamatsu.     No he now winning would change nothing but people complaing how cheap that win was.     So he has to work more to win? I gues that makes sense.    Anyway, it has been shown by much Touta loves Eva. Unless Eva reject him and see him only as a child. This ends ToutaxEva.  for many turns of the author.      This is Ken, I bet he already has plan to have Touta end with his Yandere Imouto or something, so don't think this will end so soon.    Touta thinks she really loves Negi, and only raised him as an obligation, so he said "C'mon, you'll love that red head far more than me". She really does like Touta, possibly her first love outside of time she still remembers, but when she met a red head in the future called Nagi she felt like seeing where it would go.  Imagine if you fell in love with someone, but it turned out to sort of by your son as you ended up raising them.       , but it turned out to sort of by your son as you ended up raising them  kind of your own fault. it wasnt eva who played family it was Touta.She was his teacher and master he made more out of it        After jobbing to a 10 year old boy with little training after he had lived through a full life of strife and training he committed sudoku.   RIP Jack Rakan, greatest jobber of the entire Akamatsuverse.      Goes both ways with this pseudo incest, they both met each other when they were young and sort of fell for each other in different ways.  Few hundred years later it makes for an odd love story out of time.      jack can´t dead. !!    Evangeline call Touta boy.   Negi only remenber her Touta. Sorry, bad english.    the panel in the secand panel i guess are dead. people who possible live are - science girl -sayo -ku fei -robot girl -Satsuki(Dana incognito)           Ayaka is probably alive too.    sayo is dead anon    Touta + Yandere Imotou -----&gt;Chao (?)    Nah, Chao is probably another Negi clone or something, and Touta eventually will meet her.    I'm ashamed to say I'm kind of reminded of ATLA where Zuko couldn't shoot lighting bolts but what he could do was act as a conduit for redirecting them.    Yeah, that move really reminded me of that trick, but I don't think it works the same way.    Eva is just too edgy.   I like Touta. He's a good guy   He truly loves Kitty, sadly he will never win her, so he is hoping to at least make sure she is happy.   He really is a nice guy.      He's the only one who actually can win that race  Nagi chose someone else, Negi chose someone else, Eva liked Touta back before he met either perhaps, the only one that doesn't believe there's a chance lately is Touta.  He's like "She likes that other guy", yet he's never really heard the truth there, he's just feeling useless or a burden.        Well Touta currently has a lot of self-esteem issues, but I am sure that after he faces Eva in the Tournament, they will clear the air out and Touta will start getting over his inferiority complex and start thinking he might have a chance to make her happy, or at least try to do that himself.    Eva has feelings for him, but because she would ask him this.     Eva has feelings for him, but because she would ask him this.   Eva has feelings for him, but why would she ask him this.?             Eva is so fucking sexy, perfect, and moe. Years later and she is still the best.           you have good taste anon     She hoped it was him, but at the same time is too tsun to admit it. It's typical Eva stuff, so don't worry Touta still has the best chances of winning the Evabowl.     He's the only one still in the race, aside from a lesbian maid who doesn't count.  So yeah      Determination counts for something, right?    Touta protected his waifu. thanks, maga guy.    Karin will kill Touta.    Touta will kill  Touta.     Touta x Brown imouto is OTP.  Eva is for Negi.      Nah, Karen will go for the OT3 route and take both Touta and Eva, just wait for her arc.    But the Imouto is too Yandere, how will Touta win her over?        Kill   Immortal       Negi chose someone else  We actually don't know.  Nagi of course, chose someone else before he even met her.        take both Touta and Eva  I'm more than fine with this.     Chao existed, we have no reason to think he didn't choose a girl even if the whole thing deviated.   Soo.. How much time would it take me to read all the negi manga and then catch up with this? Would it be better to watch the anime?    My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong As I Expected     what does 8man's dick taste like?   Coma cheese   Denialfags not allowed below this line ________________________________    ask saika     It seems like the most positive exchange they've had in the entire series is when Yukino asks Haruno for help during the culture festival when they need to buy time for Hachiman to find Meguri, Haruno refuses because she's confident Yukino won't be able to stand up for herself, but Yukino does just that and takes her by surprise. Haruno even complements her on how it looks like she's changed.   And we went from that to where we are in vol 11.  I don't think Yukino really needs years of self-reflection away from Hachiman and Yui to overcome her problems like some say. She has that found that answer already. She just needs to rediscover it.        Reminder that the code got cracked.    I meant Sagami not Meguri.    Friendly reminder that Yukino has had absolutely no romantic development with the 8man.   Right on man, Iroha's feelings aren't genuine   Where is my Legion?   Genuine    8man is her god. She would give herself to him if he simply asks for it.    Gay isnt wrong at all    Yui's feelings are not romantic    saying "you don't even have your will" is the most cruel thing you can do to your sister.  Can't blame her though, must be frustrated seeing her sister acting that way for more than ten years and just couldn't do shit about it must feel horrible for Haruno, too.      Max coffee    8cum tastes sweet because he drinks MAX coffee    bags of sandy milk and salty coins     continuing from last thread:     because friends never take pictures       lol deluded     But seriously though. If you think that she would go to romantic end and put all of the things she was trying to build up from the start to the trash, then YOU guys are the deluded ones.                   She just needs to rediscover it.  My thoughts exactly. Funny that the right answer had been at the middle point of the series all along. Though I am pretty excited we might go back to that in the last volume or two.      because friends never take pictures  They took a lot of pictures in Destinyland but she went out of her way to buy that one expensive picture of just her and Hachiman alone.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127121196  I missed this pic.    Do you have a lot of girls who want to be your friend all the time? If so you might be the main character for an anime    Taking a break.    2spoopy    the only one that would know     all the things she was building up to the trash  There are people who actually believe this     Too much denialfags right now, better wait until they get bored    Yukino   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KVk<wbr>ziuwXif0</wbr>  [ ]      Rewinding from my earlier post:    Also, her attempts of romance is clouded by her dependency.   If you want her romantic feeling to stay, her problem stays.    You forgot we are talking about a MAIN CHARACTER OF AN ANIME.     there are people who doesn't read                   You must have missed the notice<br/>    How far are you trying to go to troll, you already got us dude congrats we fell for it    Alright everyone it has come to my attention that this club is tied up in some unspeakable drama that we're all just conveniently ignoring.   That ends now.   We are going to discuss everything on our mind under the following condition:   We will speak honestly, and after all is said and done we will all remain friends.   You may deny this proposal, but if you do then I'll have no choice but to leave this club.   I will no longer allow things to go on this way, so no matter what happens things are going to change.   Make your decisions.           Why do people continue to ship 8man and Yukino if Yukino still loves Hayama?    this guy is still posting      Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's. I know this seems very narrow minded (since its largely a coming age novel) but even though Hachiman is the MC, the overall plot and interactions of the series all boil down to Yukino   Its her problems, her interactions (or lack of) with the characters that fuel the story so that the characters can grow  Hachiman has pretty much rounded out development wise I feel like (what is left for him? getting 100% over nice girls and ending up with a chick?). Yui has a little development left to go but her characterization has never been as pivotal compared to our two loner autists. Meanwhile, Yukino has to undergo the most changes since the series began and we have yet to reach her final growth. And the final volumes are (and the ending of the series) pretty much revolve her development and what she wants to do in her life       Filthy pleb, that's what yui said in the end of Vol 11. 8man consider that's a LIE! not GENUINE, and he CRIED. Learn some moonrunes      Remember she's playing the "tyrant", so even if she said that to Yukino, she might be suffering a hell inside of her for saying it to her own sister. It's like anon said too, she's watching her sister wasting the chance Haruno never had.  To the other anon asking how I "fixed" her, I didn't. She fixed herself. I only gave her a huge push after forcing her to remove her mask and telling everything I thought and then walked away. Next day she opened up with me. It's a process, like a damn rehab.      Why do people continue to ship Yui with 8man when Yui still loves cookie man?   I can't wait for Irohafags to get BTFO so they finally shut up like Yuifags.  It'll be like OreImo all over again.  Ayase best girl ;_;     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127121196  Nobody has feelings for 8man, he's creepy. Happy?      I will post too      I agree, her past and her relationship with hayama, her mother and haruno are still a mystery.     Are you kidding me. Yui gave 8man a bag of cookie in Vol11.  But 8man call that some kind of "payback gift" and she's nearly going to cry.      Just because people get BTFO doesn't mean they shut up.   Great taste.   I preferred Manami though.        Because she is the main heroine obviously. She needs to be taken care of by EVERYONE.    I was actually okay with the Oreimo end.  Kyousuke admitted he was fucking up his entire life and that he was making a horrible decision. Love isn't rational so admitting that is really all it takes.       yukino   growth or character development  All she does is copying other people. She herself didn't change at all. Her "drama" is bullshit too, since she's just a spoiled kid, who got bullied once. Shit character overall.       Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's  That's the main point.  It's about a high school Batman saving someone. Everything that happened to him in the past is to prepare him mentally so that he could save her.   That someone is our Ice Queen.        Good Irohasu, everyone!   I thought Manami was alright in the anime but LNfags told me she was literally Satan himself and the reason for all evil in the universe.     liking yuckyno   liking oreimo      The problem was that he rejected all other girls just to fuck his sister once.     Spent most of his time saving the independency autism.   While non-stop flirting with his kouhai.   NTR queen        Ice Queen  More like cold fish.     You got meme'd m9    In love with the dead fish.     Neptuniafag   Shitting on OreImo       once   he really believes this       Even as someone who likes Yukino the most, I am telling you right now that vol 11 slammed the door on Hachiman swooping in wearing the bat suit and saving Yukino. He has explicitly rejected it.  That isn't to say he won't provide peripheral help to her, through emotional support or advice or whatever, but Yukino is going to be the one to stand up for herself. It absolutely has to happen. Or else we're really going to get a 'sour grapes' ending.        saving a picture means watching shit show  Kill yourself oreimoshitter.     It's Vol11 m8, learn some moonrunes, and your meme is trash now.    Not sure if falseflagging or just a retarded yukinofag    And he recognized that he was alienating himself from the others. He still valued it higher than everything else.  Of course it's implied he went on to have a secret relationship with her but he never could have known that would have worked when he started. He took the philosophy of "The flame that burns half as long burns twice as bright"        lol u a troll   That level of delusion.      Do you think Yukino is good at sex?    booty blasted worstgirl fag     Bad on day 1. You'll be cumming faster than her on day 3.     Probably a dead fish first, but then warms up and ends up going at it like a rabbit.  Perfect for 8man       No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Although for some reason I feel her 'stamina' issue is psychological somehow.       Yeah this is true. But he is going to "save" her not doing the hard work for her. He'll probably become to Yukino what Hiratsuka is for him, someone that cares deeply for the other person and gives advice/wisdom  Ultimately, after Yukino tells the other two what her problems are and listening to what the other two (mostly Hachiman think), she'll do what she wants to do and not copy/shadow anyone      Oh great, as if being autistic wasn't enough    She's a virgin, of course not.  Sensei on the other hand,       I was referring to the "8man != cookie man" meme in case you missed it     Damn, that was cute.    You got it backwards. Yukino is not a virgin, while Hiratsuka is still a maiden.    Like a dead fish.    I can't believe you're arguing about the virginity of a 30-something bombshell desperate for marriage. It's not a bad thing that she's experienced you know. It means more fun, few nights cut short.     She was a great character but...     perfect for a man with dead fish eyes.    You are retarded if you think Hiratsuka would spread her legs in desperation.    fewer*    Why does everyone say this as an expression for bad sex. I bet you haven't even had sex with a dead fish.    8man fucks a panda infront of yukino   Yukino gets fucked by the panda   Happy end       you will never marry a hot obsessive sensei      8man fucks a 8man fucking Yukino     people change a lot after go through university. And saying sensei sill a virgin is just ridiculous. She must have serious problems if it's true.  It's a different case with Haruno when she isn't allowed to be in a relationship though.     Reminder that Yukino and Hiratsuka are as pure as snow.   The Aristocrats.    Isn't 8man the panda? So he's fucking himself then the himself he fucked fucks Yukino?     not posting the superior webm version     She's amazing at it.    It can happen.    Does that mean he's getting cucked by the himself that he fucked?    Yahari has the  DEEPEST LORE     Hachiman would suck in bed so they go perfectly together     No best version     Who would have the most sexual chemistry? 8man and Yukino, Iroha or Yui?     Iroha has blown Tobe more times than I can count.    Iroha is for sex Yui is for cuddling Yukino is for cuddling Pan-san      Girls don't need stamina to have good sex    Yukino or Iroha Dead fish and dead fish eyes synergy vs. experienced in sex Yui is too dumb to have sex correctly      Karen replaces Yui in the Service Club, how does the series change?   Guys I kinda liked first season besides the episode where the shitty bitch cried on stage in front of the entire school. Is the second season even worth picking up or does it become Oreimo S2 tier waifu wars?     For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  I don't get this logic. Do people suddenly drop dead after feeling worn out from running? That's basically what you're saying here.     8man fuck hayama infront of yumiko   yumiko fuck yuis dog infront of yukinos car      No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Why does everyone assume you just stop going after she's tired?     They didn't read the doujin where even when she ran out of stamina she could still do something  Kinda shows how much these kids know about sex       What?    This is worse. This has /pol/ level hate.         Best ending    You don't need to read a doujin to know that you don't stop functioning as soon as your stamina bar depletes to 0 which is what every faggot with their dead fish meme is apparently advocating here.     too dumb to sex  right, because fucking like an animal requires a literary bent.      Yahallo no more.   Ain't gonna watch it.     Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?    118 / 29 / 39   You guys need to calm down.         Eh? They both like Hikitani-kun!?      NTRing Yumiko  What kind of a sick fuck would do that to such a kind girl?     hnnnnggggggg IROHA OR DEATH     She gets to NTR Yukino's car so it's ok     This has /pol/ level hate  What does that mean?      She must have serious problems if it's true.  No shit? she's still unmarried.    So what do you guys think is Yukimom and Yukino's disagreement/conflict?  1. Yukino studying abroad 2. arranged marriage with Hayato 3. stop education and be a "perfect bride" 4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat 5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  Also, who will reveal it? Hayato? Haruno? Yukino?            Nice, Hikitani-kun! Two hot chicks are after you, lucky dog.     He must be a bit new around these parts    Don't ask, you don't want to start another nuclear bomb shitposting    Still better than waifu wars.    Probably going to same college and following same career path as Haruno.    That's pretty normal for a general. Several threads ago we hit bump limit with only 98 posters.    Yui isn't capable of boiling water, what makes you think she's capable of having sex correctly?    Yukino will be studying abroad, she's in the International Curriculum.     1. Yukino studying abroad  cop out  2. arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  3. stop education and be a "perfect bride"  unrealistic and stupid  4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat  realistic  5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  she wouldn't dare                5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  They say she has schizophrenic delusions because of Pan-san, but she knows what she saw that night.     Why is Yukimom so daft? Does she not realize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses? Likes and dislikes? She should find out what Yukino is actually capable of, what she is suited to do, before trying to control her life.  Once you figure out what her talents are and where they can be best be applied, then you can begin engineering her future and convincing her that it's "what she always wanted to do."        But if its about her career? What do they want for her? Be a politician? And also, why would she disagree to this to the point of moving out?      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2 . arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  Hallo, I'm WW Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand       I think it was mentioned at some point that Yukimom wanted Yukinon to study science like Haruno? This would separate her from her friends so I can see where the disagreement comes from.    Given all the flags we've gotten, I definitely think Yukino is going abroad by the time the series ends  Currently, she is on the same path as Hachi/Yui and before she was just following Haruno's science track. But by going abroad (since shes in international curriculum) she is going down her own path and not copying/chasing anyone. It makes the most sense given what we know  She leaves either in Year 3 (end of the series most likely) or some timeskip ending where she studies in an overseas college        From what I've gathered skimming the LNs, Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college, probably so they can become doctors.  It's just typical Tiger Mom shit. I think Yukimom is actually smart and playing the long con on Yukino, convincing her that the rebellious thing for Yukino to do would be to become a prestigious lawyer.  It's all part of the keikaku.       Now that's alpha.   Certainly fits in with the larger theme of Yukino wanting to escape the shadow of Haruno.   There was some faggotry about Hachiman rejecting Iroha last thread. Is there some truth to it?    My fetish is when a low stamina girl is all tired out but the guy just keeps fucking her because she's too exhausted to make him stop and he just keeps doing it until she's cum like a dozen times and is just a quivering mess lying in a puddle of her own fluids.      B-but that's not possible! You are a guy!      yfw 8man could have done this in the infirmary but didn't because he wasn't assertive enough     What do you think? Just your usual damage control    It's just over-enthusiastic people reading way too much into the writing. If he was gonna reject her it would definitely be way more pronounced and you would know when it happened.     Why would he? Iroha has no feelings for 8man!    He responded to her in a way that was not genuine. Make your own judgement    Is it wrong want to kill a cunt?     That's it? And why doctors? They are a family of politicians right?     Yukino   friends             Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college  Chapter?    YAHALLO  Why is she wearing ropes under her clothes? Is she a pervert?  Now that 8man told Yui to be genuine with her feelings and for Yukino to do things for herself what is to stop a love triangle from forming?    Actually, I want to add another entry:  6. Yukimom wants Yukino to go to a better school but she chose Sobu because  Hayato was there.   Also, about the arranged marriage thing. There are some points that I could support it:   Haruno doesn't want Yukino to get married to Hayato, so she ships her to 8man   8man's monologue of rich people marrying their children for family ties   Yukino gets depressed when she mentioned her mom wants a lasting relationship with the Hayama family              Not that anon but you can reason it out  Vol 6 during fireworks Haruno learned from Yui that Yukinon was going science track and she seemed upset by that (following footsteps). Vol 11 when Yukimom learns that Yuki is going on the lib arts path she starts going on about she is worried about whether Yukino is going on the right path for her future  We also know from Vol 10 that her career path ties in directly with Hayama's. Hayama as we know is going lib arts when he told Hachiman during the marathon. And Yuki even said to Yui/Hachiman that their mother wants a lasting relationship between the two families and one such way was to have both Hayama and Yukino go on different career tracks  That's my best guess and its also why I think Yukino is ultimately going to go abroad when the series is over          She's a slut.    Oh my.     over-enthusiastic people  you spelt denialfags wrong though.     Yukino's feelings for Hayama.     That's why it's trash now, Outdated meme, you live under a rock?     It's probably a fancy camisole.     Yukino   friends  Epic.       I've never known the touch of a woman since leaving my mother's breast  ftfy      Isn't she out of the house before the three even met?     Haruno could have just been disappointed about Yukino copying her choice. And I think Yukinomom would have reacted like that regardless of what she said.     implying that a girl who put on a dog collar without hesitation when given one isn't into kink   implying that if she win she's not gonna have genuine BDSM sessions with 8man      Yui probably. 8man doesn't seem the proactive type at all, so a lover who will just climb all the hell up on him and not quit until they're both sore is going to be the best bet.  Iroha comes in second because she'd be able to tease him into action eventually. With Yukino I just can't see the two of them having a super-active sex life, but by the same token I doubt it'll bother them much either.     I'm just here to say how much I love yumiko    チーン　チーン   Subtle.      based ponkan    How correct should it be when she's about to unleash her 2+ years of sexual frustration on the 8inch?    In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago. But it's just some fancy bra with extra support for her Yuis.     Why does she look like Honk?     Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand   implying WataWata would want to ruin his beloved's perfect body   You're dumber than a denialfag.        normal shirts behaving like latex bodysuits  Gets me everytime     8man fucks komachi infront of taishi   taishi fucks kamakura infront of yukino     8man's reaction to the spoon exchange can be read as a tacit rejection on his part, yes. At the very least it's more plausible than the assertion that 8man was intentionally making a pass at her.       anon fucks logic infront of other posters      yfw, originally WW used childhood promise with key + locket to bind the main trio together.   Then he switched to suicidal dog because Komi knocked his front door.     Iroha is not even a virgin. Why do people like her_   Don't know about sex, but damn the teasing would be NNNGGGHHHH   IROHA OR DEATH btw         In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   o u        a cat is fine too     Exactly. Just take one look at the outfit she was wearing for their shopping date; she may as well hang a sign around her neck that says "collar me, train me, make me your breeding bitch"   And that's reason #88 why she's Best Girl      SORE ARU!    I already ate Sensei's hymen, along with virtually 80% of Japan's virgins.     You can buy genuine woman's hymen in Japan?    Stop smelling paint anon    Sorry but dumb sluts like Yui need to be bred by middleaged men, not schoolboys.     Frankly, I have no idea. But despite that, she looked exactly like your typical high school girl. I’ve seen her type around a lot – a flamboyant girl revelling in her youth. Short skirt, three buttons of her blouse popped, hair dyed light brown, and a quick glance at her chest revealed a large heart charm on a gleaming necklace. It was an outfit that completely defied the school code.      I can't unsee Yui now, wanting to be tied up in a tortoise knots.      In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   Oh boy, I think I got spoilered already   7-year-old Yui playing alone in the park because she had no friends   There was a child there who played baseball alone   She decided to talk to that child and became interested in him   His name was difficult to remember so she gave him a nickname   One day the child gave her a pendant as birthday present   She was embarassed, couldn't find the words and instead brushed it off by calling him kimoi   She realized his eyes and expression suddenly changed   Since that day, that child never came back to the park   10 years later, his suicide dog ran in front of a limo   Someone jumped to save her dog   She saw that student's ID   "Hikitani? Hikigaya?"    The same rotten eyes she saw the day she called him kimoi   She started sobbing   "Hi...kki..."                       Haruno. You don't even have to like her to admit this.    This. For fucks sake, she's fucking hot damn it.    pls no pendants and childhood memories pls no nisekoi pls no pls       Sorry anon, I just don't think she'd be that into you.   I'd murder Watari if he pulled something like this.   That said if it were a much less serious series I'd eat that shit up          8man fuck yui infront of yukino   yuis dog fuck kamakura infront of yukino     Well played    Nisekoifags can grab the pendant and shove it up your asses and use the key to lock your Irohanus.     his suicide dog   his   youtried/10       Literal and figurative sex goddess.     had no friends   *was being shunned by her friends      Damn right! May you live long anon     I'm suddenly getting flashbacks of the dog NTR doujin.    Imagine the amount of sonnets without Yui   How does it feel to be cucked by dogs?     It's like a knot in your guts.     Try it and write us a 100 word long essay on it    Wrong pic.     100 words  nigga, what? That's way too much.     She still hasn't apologized about it yet. Still hasn't thanked hikki for saving her dog.     a reminder for those that didn't read the LN about how much you're missing in this chapter, the service club play a strip card game    What is 8man showing us, /a/?   It's a blank paper. Are you retarded?    What's with the body proportions?    Sure anon. And Iroha rapes Hayama with the tea set while Miura makes good use of the vibration feature of cellphones.      the three idiots colluded to make the two girls strip   All you had to do was to lose the motherfucking game 8man.       8man did lose the game, as a scapegoat for chuuni to win    Yukinoshit haven't even mentioned that it was her car that hit her. Although it was 8man and stupid dog's fault.    I haven't re-read that volume since the first time I read it. It still feels like it belongs in some other series.    Because it's a dick move. It might mean you get to look but it's gonna blow your shot at getting to touch.    hit him*    Did she give birth to a truck or something?     What? They where partners in the game.    Few in number, yet we stand tall brothers.   see   and the image i replied to. that's not fan art, it's from the official LN. for what reason did u think yukinoshita stripped in front of the almost nude 8man?       This explains why is she still virgin and her love for 8man isn't just because of guilt but something more  genuine , childhood friend  yandere  love     Basically he's taking the damage (stripping) for the team knowing his bad luck, the ploy was rather proudly announced after chuuni and 8man won. Pic related, smug witty bastards.      "p-please.. let me rest a littl- AAAAAAAAhn&lt;3"         is from volume 11 ?       Nope    She didn't stripped. She was just trying to cover her mouth and nose because Yui farted and apparently the room was going Chernobyl    I'd say 1-3 and 5 all feel like they fit well together. 4 is a little different but it still fits with the rest of the first half as a "test run" for a longer plot. It's definitely a whole different animal from volume 6 onward though.       This is the real reason why Yukino isn't genuine. It's not because of Hayama or anything, it's because she really likes a panda. Ultimate plot twist.     and 8man's nude torso? was yui's fart so corrosive it melted his clothes?    Why is S2 8man so fucking hot? Is it true that men become more attractive when is surrounded by bitches?   Reminder that yahari threads are pro isreal and gg supporters   Yeah. She had tried to make her own bento that morning. Suffice to say, if Yui ever offers to make you fried chcken start running and don't stop.    That's right. And based on how 8man looks, I'd say his anus is starting to melt    Wish I had photoshop on this computer   I think that during the final episode tomorrow we'll get some kind of announcement.    Gahama-san, I'll give you this in exchange for your virginity     Announcement pertaining to...    only fried chicken? pretty sure everything she makes can be categorized as chemical and biological weapon   pretty interesting expression for a melting anus. it's almost... orgasmic. did 8man has some fetish we didn't know about?        Finally, a live-action movie adaptation of the first few volumes.      ...     Potential OVAs in the future that will cover the ending of the show, something like that?    New Yahari Li ve Action     My sources says its another vita VN directed by watari and kojima    There is nothing wrong with ellipses used in that way.   Does Yukinon want the 8? If so why didn't she let him kiss her.    Have you seen this man?      Implying 8man would have to give her anything for her virginity     Well it's the fried chicken that dissolved 8man's uniform. The tamagoyaki is still slowly dissolving its way through the ground beneath Sobu, heading for the center of the earth.    Post old ponkan art to bait discussion about art progression   Denial shitposting on the rise instead  Can we discuss the ongoing art progression? I beg of you. The cutesy art progress slightly finer on volume 5, then take a massive turn on volume 6. My hypothesis is the change of tone in the LN forces ponkan to adapt a finer artstyle, the art in this volume also differ from 6 meaning the tone actually becomes more serious       I know fuckers like you popped in at around 2 years ago complaining about something everyone has done on this board from the very beginning.     I think the art progression is great. Yukino looks more beautiful than ever.   But my shit is still better looking than Yui and Iroha      and on that day, humanity received a grim reminder...    What nigga? Those fuckers are back? GTFO plebs we don't need more shitty complaining    I think you might be onto something. Volume 6 was clearly an intentional change in tone for Watari, so I can believe he'd have sat down with Ponkan8 to talk about a shift in the art too.  Speaking of the old art though, sometimes I miss the old kinda-tsun Yui. Her smile might be like the sun on a warm spring day, but it's a crime how cute she is when she's angry.   The Service Club's true final request         You are biased shithead.    8man tell Yui to be more genuine with her feelings and not gloss over everything for the sake of superficialness  That of course it going to be the fact she loves him dearly. Unbeknownst to him he just gave her the green light to pursue   8man tells Yukino to solve her own shit and not go with the flow  I can interpret that as her being her own person and going for what she wants. That also may mean that she might actively pursue 8man if that is what she wants. Before I got the impression that even though she had feelings for him she would never pursue but probably would let him take her.       Fuck off. Shit ain't supposed to talk     yukinoshitter calling anyone shit       He basically tells them both to be yourself (Yui to be genuine, Yukino to stop chasing people and follow her own path whatever it is).   Its like he added more fuel to the triangle but at the same time he diffused the tension that the previous one had.     who is 8man's dad   some corporate wageslave    Hideki Tojo    Komachi is not blood related  what the fuck?    It's true anon. WW is pulling a Mahouka    Yeah, the shift was so ridiculous I thought it would relate to the storyline, and it does. The 8man goes full batman on volume 6. Can't wait for volume 12 artworks.     Really?         Huh? They have the same ahoge, that means they're blood related.    I find that hard to believe.     Yukishit   likes Manami   Why am I not surprised?       Yes, different father     GTFO      Komachi's is a clip-on. She uses it to dissuade her brother from pursuing the love between them because even as NBR they'd be treated like pariahs.     ... the movie     Holy fuck. Hikimom is a cutie.    So he unknowingly sparked a love triangle?    He said in Vol11 that Komachi is a mini version of his mom    Fap?     sparked    How does 8man achieve nice boat end?   Episode 13 ends in a cliffhanger   MOVIE GETS ANNOUNCED!  How would you react?     mfw 8man gets run over by Yukinos car again   mfw 8man dies   mfw the car fucks Yukino       lol    8man and komachi got the best voice actors at least.  so hentai is legal here  Hey yuifags, where the fanfics at  yukino is the best damn written character ever    "This is the plot for Zaimokuza's new novel."     I'm gonna shitpost on /a/.   iroha sucks and her fags are the worst   So he blackmail Iroha, and NTR Zaimokuza? what a twist    What did I say wrong? I think it s pretty clear that there is one at the moment.    "Iroha sucks" "Fags"      &gt;"I don't think I'm the one that needs to take responsibility."     Oh, hot news you fuck.     ""     Yeah, she should buy a better brand of fags.    Okay, Yahari thread = best place for shitposting    Sometimes, it feels like Watari hates Yukino considering how hard he's throwing her through the wringer for the past who knows how many volumes.   How does Iroha so successfully rile up Yui/Yukino?    Mild Menthol filtered Irohasu     "sparked" would imply that it's what started the love triangle.    She knows the 2 girls can't make any move without shit going south, so that gives her space to tease the fuck outta 8man without getting shit on.    She was too perfect before so he needs to show how flawed she is.    99% chance that we're at the bottom of the ocean, brother. With each passing volume Watari manages to push Yukino's victory through subtlety. But I'm still here and will always be here, even if we sunk.     Yukino sits in the clubroom in her chair, chained    Yui has a big kitchen knife in her Hand   Yukino tries to scream   Yui gives her a fist into her mouth, pulls Yukinos tongue out, and cuts it off   Yukino cries but can't make sounds   Yui continues pulling out Yukino eyes one by one    Then takes out her teeth one by one   Yukino is still alive and has a seizure   Yui stucks her knife into Yukinos heart and takes it out   She puts it in the dustbin   8man comes back from the toilet   Sees Yukino face without eyes, tongue and teeth and pukes   Yui comes nearer   "Hikki, something really bad happened. Yukinos heart didn't taste like her eyes, they where much smoother ahaha..."   8man pukes again   "What's wrong Hikki? Oh, this will cheer you up!"   Yui cuts off Yukinos face and puts it in hers   "Am I genuine enough for you now, Hikki?"   8man tries to run   Gets smashed against the wall and forcekissed and tastes the blood in Yuis mouth and the rest of Yukinos eyes and her heart   "I want more of you Hikki!"   Yui stabs him in his heart too and takes his heart out   Eats his heart infront of him   "Look, Hikki. You will live within me now, ahahah"                            Perfect    Typical DelusionYucky-copypaste-nofags      Nice boat.     cute     Basically she's a non-evil Haruno. She's pretty good at reading a situation and pushing peoples' buttons, and it's an entertaining pastime for her.    Yeah. I wonder what is his endgame for Yukinon given that she's going to to the main focus for the rest of the novels (as if Yukino wasnt already the sole vehicle for moving the plot)  Vols 1-6 had some decent development for her (Vol 6 when she stood up to Haruno being the peak so far); Vol 7-9 were pretty bad. Things got a little better  Then Vol 10/11 and her dependency/copycat issues came about but it seems like the end of Vol 11 is when things finally starts going up for her again.        She's perfect  to me.     this    people ironically liking iroha   bitch sucks hayato's dick every night, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?     Actually laughed out loud.    Then what did? When did it start?    Yui is perfect, thus she has perfect taste in BFFs, thus Yukino is perfect. QED.     with each passing volume  kek, it's actually the other way round nice attempt, Yukinofag       iroha fucks hayama infront of yumiko   yumiko Ducks 8man infront if yukino   yukino fucks Yui infront of sable   sable fucks the car infront of 8mans bike   8man bike cri         He's cuntkiller faggot, at least pay respect to your legion's captain    People complain about Yui suffering, but at least, she's very consistent and true to herself. Being a Yukinofag, seeing Yukino go through so many changes, both good and bad, hurts to see. I was expecting the MC to be the one with the most problems, but now it's apparently Yukino.  The payoff better be huge, Watari or I will slap a fucking bear   and hopefully not get killed afterwards.       sleepover arc confirmed, yuri ending imminent     cuntkiller guy   yukinofag  Nigga what, you must be brand new in these threads.     http://exhentai.org/g/826973/a338ef<wbr>5065/</wbr>    nisemono. Just like Yuckynonfags.  Act like our Honmono Cap'n.        Its not that hard to see where her end lies. Rumi is basically loli-Yukinon and recall what Hachiman told Rumi in Vol 9   Cooperation and trust were likely, more so than you could imagine, very cold things.   It was fine if you did things yourself, but that’s because you had to.    By living your life without being a bother to anyone, for the very first time, you’d be able to ask for things from people. Once you’re able to live by yourself, for the very first time, you’d be able to walk alongside someone.   Because you lived by yourself, because you could do things by yourself, that you’d be able to do so with someone else   That said, someone posted this earlier but I do agree that Oregairu has shifted towards being more about Yukino's story more than anything else. Just give her a good ending Watari              ages ago, though not really in a symmetrical fashion. Yui had been crushing since the beginning, and I'd say Yukino since the shopping date for Yui's birthday. Yui really fell for him somewhere between the camping trip and summer festival, while Yukino was more gradual, with things intensifying at the cultural festival until the penny finally dropped after Genuine.   The way of the solitary bear™   Sorry, it's just my pessimism speaking.  Iroha or Death, always. Is that better?      so, you read that doujin?    Go suck some dick irohafag    Man, they did a pretty respectable job of keeping the faces on-model.    No anon. Iroha can die already.    Anon, my dick exploded. Give me a new one.     they're wondering if they should invite Sensei, Haruno, and Komachi     So are you saying there was a silent triangle for a few volumes? If the volume 11 spoilers are true then there might be a louder triangle coming.  I wonder if Yui ever had a secret fear that Hikki and Yukinon would fall in love with each other.      ayy lmao why would i pay respect to a s4s tier shitposter get the fuck out crossboarder scum    So, Hachiman tells Yukino he won't solve things for her, so she asks them to help her, instead of just doing it for her?   I'll add in this bit too as a follow up to what Hachiman thought of Rumi   I glanced at Rumi who was working next to me.    This girl was probably going to be able to live by herself. If she could already do this in elementary school, she was in a good position. &gt;She was also cute too.    That’s why, one day, she’d be able to walk alongside someone.   Watari loves symbolism and references in the novel so I think its obvious that Hachiman will be the person who walks beside her (Sensei also alluded to this though she also includes Yui as well)  In what capacity they walk together is up for debate            I wonder why he did that, two of his most important people are going to go after his 8, he probably can't handle it. He wants genuine, not ass.    Have you not picked up on any clues since the series began?  If you just somehow ignored all the Yukino flags in the past few volumes, whatever, I shall let it slide. But how the fuck did you miss Yui's and her reactions to everything      Yes, the romance flags have been there from  day one , Watari had just been keeping them subtle rather than going full harem gag comedy.  At this point I think we're going to be seeing a sort of friendly rivalry thing between Double Y for 8man's affection. It sounds like they both put their cards on the table during the sleepover interlude.  I don't know if Yui worried about 8man/Yukino being a thing before, but it's obvious from her actions early in volume 11 that she thinks that's the case now.       Did someone post vol 11's scan yet?  So, regardeless of romantic resolution, I think Hachiman going on to become a teacher is a given. He's doing for other people what Sensei did for him.   The one things he's fucking great at is not reading people, but changing them.     So will he take up smoking like sensei?     In what capacity they walk together is up for debate  Precisely. I don't think romance is at all a necessary factor for 8man, Yukino, and Yui to walk beside each other, it's just going to be gravy for two of them.   See above. Genuine isn't about romantic love, but they aren't mutually exclusive by any means.   In his defense, misreading Yukino's flags would kind of mean he didn't see any triangle, unless you come from a dimension where geometry works differently and a triangle can be defined between only two points.           He's gonna be an editor.    He already walks like Spike. Might aswel start smoking to complete the cosplay    He's already addicted to MAX Coffee.   You're all faggots. Akiyama Mio will win the 8bowl.   nice shitpost     not ritsu tainaka       Yeah... a real cutie indeed.   Irohasu~   Mio&gt;Mugi&gt;Azunyan&gt;*  Everyone below those three don't matter.      If that was Hachiman and Komachi's reaction to the cat-included pet show, then what was Yukino's reaction?    SLUT    You'd look like shit too when your kids were being noisy fuckers when you were trying to sleep in.    Ritsu is plain, fuck her.    Irohasu~~    damn anon that was cute    i just wanna know the size of senseis cups.    Was it true that Yui is surprisingly good at math?  I remember it was mentioned in the previous threads, but can anyone verify the source?       muh special snowflake  shes qt      come for 8man    stay for Iroha  I wish yukidrama would just fuck off.      They're large anon. A paradise for hands and dicks    Diary entry #1003   Today was the promised date   We went to the aquarium and did other things   I brought Yukinon along so I could suggest something   I wanted things to stay the same   I didn't want them together...   Hikki saw through it, I knew he would   He told me essentially to be true to my desires and not be superficial   I will take that to heart and follow my deepest desires   I will win his heart and beat Yukinon   Maybe once Yukino goes back to her apartment I should sleep over   I wonder how much chloroform costs...               No, she sucks dick in everything that isn't social    She's definitely good at it on the practical end. 8man praises for her housewife-like financial prowess a couple of times.  I think late in volume 9 when they're discussing the new plan for the christmas event, and then again in 10.5      Too bad she smokes and hit males for cheap comedic relief.    Dman. 8an is fast with the recorder    Yuri rape confirmed    How come in the first volume, it clearly states red ribbon differentiates the grades in the school. Implying that the other grades should have different color ribbons. But here, Iroha has a red ribbon also? I just started reading this.    Don't ask, just enjoy them.    Does anyone actually want this? I feel like I'm wasting my time uploading if not.    Probably a Brains Base fuckup in S1 that nobody is bothering with fixing now.    You know, I just had a thought. Yandere Yui probably wouldn't have to do anything crazy to put Yukino out of the picture.  She could just collude with Komachi to sneak into Casa de Ocho one night and "take" 8man.      That would explain Yukino's face at the end.    Anon...Maybe people actually want those scans. Maybe people actually want spoilers. Maybe people actually want it all so we can shitpost, fap, and shit on Iroha.    Fuck you, faggot. Infinitely better than your pedo bait who's just a mashup of the rest of the cast, vanilla bland caterpillar eyebrows that fucks niggets, autist airhead who stares off in space, or boring scared girl (oh look she's scared again, how cute!) that interrupts bantz between yui and Ritsu because she's a jealous cunt.  Fuck you, faggot.       liking slut   epic     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings                      Irohasu~     Diary entry #1003   Today was the promised date   We went to the aquarium and did other things   I brought Yukinon along so I could suggest something   I wanted things to stay the same   I didn't want them together...   Hikki saw through it, I knew he would   He told me essentially to be true to my desires and not be superficial   I will take that to heart   I will win his heart and beat Yukinon   I wonder how much chloroform costs...I don't want to ask Yukinon   I know Hikki stays up late so I will have to be careful to get there at the right time   Better?                  I don't actually follow this series, I just stumble across the scan and thought people might be interested in it. Feels like I walked into a waifu warzone in here.       It's clear this fag was caught while masturbating on K-On cast.  The trauma...      SUBARASHI    You did, it might be better for you to run.      Yui wants to fuck 8man &amp; Yuki.   She wants it all.       It's not a warzone yet anon. We're just warming up    Your friends are not here you fuck. They are not awake yet. You are all alone you fucker, we are going to rape you nice and slowly. Oh I have a better idea, Im gonna buy some foxes and letting them fuck you, because it looks like you love &gt;slyfuckses so tell me your adress.    2 days until the last episode.  It's been nice guys.  Preach it.        yui always acts like a nice girl because deep down inside she likes being called a bad girl and being punished.   Yui is out to provoke both of them into punishing her yuis and spanking her.       IROHA OR DEATH    I knew Yui had a crush on Hikki and I know Yukino had been attracted to him for awhile but I never thought it would turn into love. I didn't think there was a love triangle.     a sort of friendly rivalry thing between Double Y for 8man's affection. It sounds like they both put their cards on the table during the sleepover interlude.  I thought the only thing Yukino said was that she is concerned in him. I do recall a spoiler saying that Yukino tells Yui, after 8man tells her something, that she doesn't want Yui deciding her feelings.        Irohasu~    You Will (Not) be Missed.    Oh you can say that again when wild foxes gangbang you, you fucking shit. They will cum all over your ass with their foxcocks you fuck.   IROHA!  can go fuck herself and commit suicide    Irohasu~   If spoiler is true,Yui is only girl(outside Komachi) that "officially" give 8man Valentine's Gift(bag of cookies) and he accept it during V-day.  So it is foreshadowing for Yui ending ?     I'll get the book tomorrow to scan, but I'm sure the chinamen should have gotten around to it already.    Maybe I'm wrong but the term I saw used was "conscious" rather than "concerned" and that tends to have unspoken romantic connotations.    This is pathetic anon    im with this guy     Irohasu~     And people said Irohafags are the worst while we're clearly the victim of jealous otherfags. We revel in the fact that their banter is enjoyable, but we're still realistic and admit that her chance to win the 8bowl is small.    Who knows? You can make an argument that both girls have equal chances of getting the ending (though 3some friendship seems likely too)     Irohasu~     Thank you Spyro! I'm waiting for my book too, if you need any help, I'm available.    How's the anime in your opinion? As far as I can tell it's utter crap compared to the LN     https://mega.nz/#!X5lhkRwb!mOsZVYyo<wbr>EW3XNs0NvOpeZsCjkP8PgUivYmTXL4Ar9u8<wbr></wbr></wbr>   Save you some trouble then.       SLUT      "conscious"  Yeah, you're right. She is conscious of him. That could mean anything though. Maybe he has found a place in her heart or she thinks of him a lot, it could be friendly conscious.     Let the waifuwars begin    Irohasu~    Irohasu~    Man, The crazy thing is that Watari's got just enough groundwork laid to pull a surprise OT3 ending on us if he really wanted to. You know polyamory is the best kind of love Watari, do it.   Bonus mode: after their night of passionate menage a trois, cut to Iroha sadly dry-humping her Hayama bodypillow with 8man's face taped on it.       Irohasu~   I didn't know they ever stopped       We're every where Anon.   So if not 8man, who will Yukino give the MAX COFFEE to?  Irohafags continue to make their desperate cries, but in the end your tears will be delicious.  Fuck you     Irohasu~    Irohasu~    She will give it to 8man in exchange for  a Pan-san.    Maybe it'd be better if you just calmed down Anon.       Irohasu~   Why so frustrated anon? It's just fanart dumps      I don't know who I like more, Sensei or Saki.  Saika is the true love made for 8man though, NoEbina.     I wouldn't mind a OT3 ending for this, the best club is an united club after all. Plus I am sure that Yukinon wouldn't mind being a part of Yui's harem.     Eguchi, nohomo    Forgot the pic    Yes, it's left open to interpretation because the Japanese have a boner for leaving things unspoken that's big enough to cock-slap China from across the Sea of Japan. Again, it's extremely common that when a character says that, they are implying they mean it in a romantic sense. It's kind of like how "suki nano" is nothing more than "I love it" and in literal context was just Yui reiterating how she loved the club, but the implied context was that she was saying she loves 8man.   Someone remind me why I'm defending Yukino's love for 8man when I'm the guy who had so much Yui-love and so little shame he posted his Yui daki in one of these threads a couple days ago.       How come Yukinon doesnt have a Hachiman thought bubble whereas Yui, Komachi, and even Haruno did    I'd like to take a dump on those fanarts    Irohasu~    Irohasu~    Because their love for him is pure and you can't just hate that.    Maybe because, much like Yui, you're actually a  Lesbian .    Irohasu~   Here's some official art then anon          Meganesu~    No idea, though it is a bit strange considering she's the one that's been giving him a lot of MAX COFFEE lately.                   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127120702#p127130412">Click here</a> to view the full text.

Probably just to add a little bit of suspense as to who she's going to give it to, even though it's obvious.   I finished Rebellion. ...So Madoka Thread. Reaction Images or general disscusion.   no   why can't Homura travel back in time to meet herself?  The only thing Homu did wrong was doubt the power of love and hope.     Homura did everything right.   Why must Homu sacrifice her happiness to make everyone happy? When will she get to be happy?   She gets to spend her life with her waifu. She is very much happy.    Helping thread reach image cap by posting best girl  Fluff   Best fluff of all     so when homu said she loved madoka what did she mean? is it a friendship love or a fug love?

The most autistic one of them all.    He's now a slave of Homu.   He betrayed Sayaka.        In that case kevin is now the smartest and best tripfriend of them all. Based kevin      You can go fluffier.    What is homu staring at?    To be honest, I also think Homura is better than Sayaka.     I really want to organize folder v3,     Something she doesn't have    President wouldn't lie    You know, the point of these threads isn't for people to spam things just to irritate someone.

Kyouko Loves Sayaka. Sayaka Loves Kyouko.      Kyouko loves food. Sayaka loves me.    Prove it      Failed trips say otherwise.    Dressing like sayaka does not mean she loves you...  Still holy shit      Oh shit kevin kun is getting called out! Who will win ?    I think I meant Sayaka took off her meguca clothes in my room.    B-but sayaka is 2D and you are 3d.. those are defiantly 3d clothing. Dont you lie!    Uh, pic is me. I love Sayaka much more than Kevin-kun so I am the next generation.    Can't even keep up with Kevin-kun.             I heard a rumor that you're a Korean. Is it true?     No, that would mean I would hate Sayaka.            I don't get it but dat pantsu m8.      Koreans hate Japs and Sayaka was made by Japs!            hatin' a qt like Sayaka only for that reason is stupid tho.    Is there a better quality version? This one is so fuzzy.      I agree! It probably has to do with Japan raping their country.      __No               Have you ever kissed Sayaka?      That's lewd!    oh shut up, you panty poster.      No! It's a fine picture. Stop!    Just remember: Homura did nothing wrong.    You must answer in Yes or No.      Not until she's of age and real.    So no, huh? Too bad that Sayaka-chan's first will be mine.    Doesn't work that way, champ.      We'll see, cali boy.     Cali boy.      You don't like? Okay. Just post Sayaka. Better if lewd.    No lewd.    Come on or I'll call you a cali boy.    It's creepy.    That pic is waaaaay creepier tho. Good night btw.    Good-night, Anon-kun!

Guess my name will be chi again.          http://kotaku.com/why-destiny-playe<wbr>rs-feel-screwed-over-1713417685</wbr>     Cute.    How dare you can say good? You're worse than Lelouch.     &gt;kotaku  I haven't played for long so idk. On top of PS+ you have to pay for ARR?    You wanted it.   No anon. Just no.              Stop spoilering everything dammit.     Do you actually need PS+ for FFXIV? I know you need it for Destiny.      Implying implication that imply such a statement is true.    So, uh... Tart Magica, anyone? I can't find it online.   Am I going to have to drag you into Kyouko night this week?    I don't know. You tell me. I'm new to the console.   Please. Drag me from my hell into Kyouko warmth.        no image     If only I had Enkidu.    You would be happy?     As far as I can tell, you do not need a PS+ account to play FFXIV, but you do need a FFXIV sub to play FFXIV. If you want to play the FFXIV trial, you do need to have PS+. Destiny does require PS+ for almost all of it's game modes, I believe.      Enkidu?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127110626  Are you still doing the testing?   Oh damn. I should get it later today.         What is this shitty feelings after finished Rebellion. I am not even saying Rebellion's bad. It's good. But this feelings man. I can't stop thinking Homura can never be happy from now on.   I hate this feeling. When she also personally tells you, it's even worse.    Learn to cope with it, and hope every day for the sequel announcement.     It's a Fate reference to one of Gilgamesh's noble phantasms used to chain people up.     Because you misunderstood a lot. The ending is the only way for Homura to be happy.    Oh yes. Happy. That's what they're calling it now.    Oh. Please chain me from this hell.   Absolutely happy?       There's probably going to be a sequel. I mean Homuworld seems to be hanging together by just a thread. All it takes is one little push and BOOM it goes bye-bye.    Homu personally tells me?  Dunno if I event want a sequel or not. ;_;  She sure looked happy in the ending of course. Maybe I should cope with that fact. It's just, I am not even forcing my kind of happiness, I am with the common sense of happiness.   How can I put this, you know villains in fictions usually feel happy when they do something "wrong" like, razing, destroying or killing like that right? I felt similar vibes from Homu's happiness.  Anyway, I can't say anything if that's the thing she really wanted. I can't do anything but have shitty feelings.            There's definitely going to be a sequel, because Shaft needs its drug money. The only question is how long this wait will be.     Stuff to consider. I'm off today and tomorrow.     Comparing to "Madoka takes Homura to heaven" it's super happy ending for her, but not for everyone else .     I had a dream Homurabtood me she is happy Madoka can live a normal life, but is miserable herself.   Well then, I gotta get a move on.       *Homura told me    *even  Yeah, I felt similar vibes even she actually revivified megucas.   I just. Man. If Homu felt like shit because Madoka sacrificed her eternally. It is also okay for me to feel like shit because Homura turned into a devil eternally.        How long has it been since you watched it?   Homura just can't be happy in this new world, where she desperately tries to connect to Madoka, but must let her be so her plans of keeping Madoka safe happen. It's a delicious irony in her part to put herself in this position.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111202  Shut the fuck up man. No. Sorry. Don't shut up and continue man. If doing like that makes you feel better.   ,1 Thank you, friend.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111202  She wants to protect Madoka but she doesn't want her to change.  In fact Madoka saying in Rebellion that she wouldn't want to leave anyone is based of her before she saw Sayaka and Kyouko's sacrifices. In other words Homura can't accept a Madoka different from the one in her head.      Hah! Are you two now friends?    I thought we were friends.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111327  Oh yeah, and it's all going to come back to bite her in the ass.  The big question is how.     Imagine the look on Homura's face when Madoka gets her powers back, expecting to fight, but receiving love instead.   I believe this will happen   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111442  You do realise Madoka is basically all loving right?     What kind of friggin assblasting anime this is.  assblasting means noice  It even spawned this weird fanfic guy in the thread.       Dammit Mami first Nagisa and now this?   And just like Madoka having to fight her own witch, I believe Homura must one day fight herself. All her insecurities, all her pessimism. She can't be truly free until she loves herself, and allows her to be loved.   Hey, cool bro. If you meet her in your dream next time, tell her to visit Dan's dream livin' in NV right?    I can't control my actions in my dreams. I would've prevented some if I could.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111648  You are just so cute. Do you get your jollies this way?    Shh, I bet he's fappin' now.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111699   Yes!     It's nothing bad trip guy. Just briefly wash with your hands and dry it whenever that happens.    I didn't want that dream. It's very bad!   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111769  You can safely do it now then. I can even watch for you if anyone's coming to your room. No need to thank, it's called universal brotherhood.    But Homura already did all that in Rebellion. Devil form is love and freedom incarnate. Also Madoka never fought her own witch?    Why is it bad? It's perfectly natural, and everyone has them. Kyouko would understand.      I don't like dreaming of having sex with a 14 year old. Kyouko would be disgusted at everyone.    You don't? Really? Well, then tell her to visit my dream and have fun with me please. You're a good guy so I know you'll do.    If I tell her that she will be upset because Kyouko loves me and only me. I will do no such thing.    Akuma is not freedom. A true freedom would allow both good and bad to happen.   Also Madoka fought her own witch?  "all witches, with my own hands," including Kriemhild Gretchen.    At least you recognize it as wrong. That's what separates us from the animals. But there's not much you can do still when your subconscious wants what it can't have.            everyone has them  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gvd<wbr>f5n-zI14</wbr>  [ ]     Try not to masturbate for a few days.      I knew you were actually a girl. Karen.    Yeah, I don't have sex dreams with Sayaka in them.   I have intense guilt dreams where I beg forgiveness for girls that I have horribly wronged.       She sends her consciousness back, like in Steins;Gate. It's why she can't bring anyone with her.    I wish I could've prevented it. I never felt so dirty in my life.    Enough to make a contract?     I already have my grief gem, incubator.     You could and it's super simple. Fap to other porn before go to bed.    Fapping is disgusting.    You're saying that fapping is for beta? Yeah. Ice cold man. Sure that an alpha male doesn't fap. He only have sex.    The idea of it. I don't care about the whole beta, alpha, giga, omega, whatever you want to name them.   https://<span>youtu.be/4Owj52XhoxI  [ ]   wut   Classic?   I dun get it.

Try guess   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111600   Canon fags have the mentality of babies, actually.   "You can't ship what I don't like"  Lol, you're pathetic, go back to Tumblr,        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113031  What was this post about Apple-chi? I am curious!     This video contains content from SME, who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds.   Basically, I can't watch it.      She has never been. It also is the reason why you should be 100% okay with that ending, since she has already learned to cope with it anyway. Homura being unhappy simply is Homura being herself, except that now everyone has been handed better lives thanks to it. A net positive.  As an aside, Homura hates sympathy from strangers and does not really care about anybody's opinions on her feelings. Not even Madoka's.      To be fair, better have no second chair nearby than have one accompanied by a puddle of pink goo.     She has never been.   LIES!     homu   Both are pretty bad, tbh. The only thing worse would be the chair never existing in the first place.  Now imagine that sequel. Madoka being written out of reality.       You got it in the opposite. Homura exchanged her eternal happiness in Madoka's side for the chance to give Madoka a better fate than the head of some law of the universe, with the side effect of also bringing back a bunch of people that had befriended some of her acquaintances in that previous dream world.    I wish I can sleep with Homu.    Akuma get out of /a/.     Mami-san &gt; Nagisa &gt; Kyouko &gt; Madoka &gt; Sayaka &gt; Homura  Will Ayanero deliver a new one in this comiket? His doujin is of course lewd but fun to read.   Nagisa arose that high? That's why you should've watched Rebellion before calling her a shit. A SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!    Homura is the best to be honest.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113260   getting asshurt cause I said lol   accusing me on going to Tumblr    linking me to shit that I don't give a fuck about.   I'm not even going to bother with you anymore. You're being a jackass at this point and I'm just going to ignore this thread. No one cares that you are triggered by anyone who ships a pairing that isn't canon. None of the ships are canon, so who cares? You can't tell anymore what to ship. And by the way, you're not a mod, so fuck off.        tfw no Kyouko to eat a burger together with.    tfw no Kyouko to feed with Umaibo       Madoka &gt; Homura  Madoka didn't do shit, just capitalize on a wish that cost Homura many years of agony to build up, before forming a contract and taking all the glory for herself.     Yes, yes. That's why Homura rekt LoC. Homu got mad at Madoka for taking all the glory from her. Now Homu is the real queen who did real SHIT.     It's too hot, Apple~chi. I hate this.      I know. The heat is unbelievable.     Apple chi is sliced and now in my oven if you know what I mean.   t. Apple pro.      What?    Very juicy.     Hopefully it rains more. Night Apple~chi.     I suppose.   No, it's bright here. G'night.      Another Ume Aoki Hidamari x Madoka pic. http://www.umeten.jp/   Apple chi anon should get a trip.

Oh man are you serious? How could we have all been doing it wrong this whole time??? Drop everything guys, we've been doing these threads wrong all along.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117368  You really want me to hate Homura,right?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117489  I've been through wikis and watched all of Madoka Magica, but Madoka never hinted or even thought of anything involved of hatred. Perhaps you have a screenshot that can convince me that Madoka has these thoughts.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117659  That's not really hating.   Rebellion is shit.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127118002  If Madoka knew she wouldn't be under Homu's influence now would she? Until Madoka personally uses the word 'hate' I won't hate Homura.    "nobody but you and 44 others", you mean. And blame Kevin and his depressive imagedump   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127116989  Homura did nothing wrong you faggot. If anything, Madoka is the evil trash. See<br/>   Madoka isn't evil nor does she understand the concept of hate.  Still shit.    American politician   wouldn't lie  If only.        tfw I missed all the crackposting fun      Check the archives if they still aren't down.        Homura looks uncomfortable.    You see, it looks as if he posted spoiler text, but it's actually part of the image.      I stole the image from you   Constantly shit.       Madoka would insult someone like that, she's as pure as winter snow.    If she is pure then why does she have such raunchy ass?      Because you sexualize the Megucas.   I want to do lewd acts with HomuHomu and make Madoka watch.   Boy did you fuck up. You should have done this like 10 hours ago when there were only some 17 posters around, and the thread was moving much faster overall.      would?    wouldn't    Tfw you will never cum inside moemura while madoka watches wishing she could be in homus place.    She's the pumpkin full of seeds. She will be the one to seed you.    Moemura not akuma. Big difference you got to fill the pumpkin with seeds before it can fill you.    But she wasn't Akuma. She was being moe, and when she does become akuma you better believe you will take in all of her seeds.  Every last seed.     No, whoremura always is carrying the seed of several men, women and even animals inside of her. Because she is that much of a whore.   She already was like this as early as her retarded braids phase.       Homuhater you are late. Even kevin beat you to the thread!      Seed of women?    Futanari is a hell of a drug    I guess he loves futa as well as men.   Even Madoka bro was banned.  Don't worry, I know there jokes, I hope.      can't delete posts this often  This is a thing?   *they're  I don't think there was support. For one side orthe other.          And me and Kevin-kun weren't?  I'm going to perform an exorsism if all of you don't be quiet.    Ugh, today wasn't really good.  Pokemon has great girls, do you agree?  I love all the girls.  Except Misty, who was kind of a bitch.  Iris was a bitch too, but damn if I don't love her design.      Yes, so which should I jerk it to today?   Skyla    Don't think I've ever done it to her actually, so okay.    There should be a roulette for this, it's hard as fuck to decide who to do it to sometimes.    They are all extremely fappable.    gen 5 hast best girls. The best being the bun girl with the leggings.      TFW most pokemon doujins are furryshit   Why     I just wish the artists didn't give the girls watermelons instead of breasts. THat-s fucking disgusting.     TFW only played XY because my custom Serana     you played as the superior and cutest color serena, right?

Good taste   No one here likes Sabrina?        not posting best boy    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113964  Yes     POST HILDA         You will never lose a battle and have to pay with your body        that pic where the lass does     Best girl will never be animated    didn't even appear in the anime   replaced with a shitty nigger loli  No wonder BW is easily the worst series        Only best boy deserves the best girl. Not Ash.   Reminder that Serena was voted the best on /a/.  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm</wbr></wbr></wbr>      I think they made the right choice. I wouldn't want her to be sullied by Ash and his losing streak     The only exception is Hilda, she's 14-ish   Cynthia a best  Needs more doujins.   Right on.     As hard as diamond   Especially the participant of kalos queen competition or whatever the name is.    Game Serena is something like 16, while ORAS May is canonically 12. The whole 10-year-old protagonist thing only ever applied to the anime; the game versions have always been older.   Best girl, why doesn't anyone remember her?     he hasn't read Chibikko Bitch XY 1 and 2       YOU probably wouldn't walk for weeks - she's definitely a ravager.     read them both. Thats why is said MORE. Get your memes out of here.     Go on.    I really really like this picture     Just the way I like it.    Quick reminder that the Pokemon anime is still shit because it still focuses on Ash and Pikachu losing every league.   Seriously, how hard could it have been to make Ash the aged mentor to the XY protagonist? Maybe make him an Elite 4 member who travels around a lot?     Not after the shit pile that was Best Wishes. Maybe next gen. Hopefully next gen. At least let this Ash retire in peace. If it absolutely positively needs to be an Ash in the starring role, then just switch to a different one courtesy of Hoopa.     This. You also can easily spot an anime-onlyfag or a Genwunner when they mention the whole 10-years-old shtick. I'd say the very least, they're 12. Leaf comes off as that age anyway.      Most people have never read the manga either and don't realize that everybody actually ages as the story progresses. Ash is the only oddball in the whole franchise, he more of an anomaly. I wonder if Ash even exists at all      It was mostly in jest, but I agree there are those who still think so.  And just look at those proportions.       sabrina a qt3.142. Can Sabrina read minds with her psychic abilities?    anon have you not seen b2w2's promotional trailer?    Same with May, I know there are ten year olds with developed bodies(I saw many of them in my school at fifth grade), but in all honestly twelve is the borderline to being considered a young adult or a full fledged adult in certain societies.   <br/>   I love that image. It show how slutty Rosa and how pure Hilda.       pure   those shorts   Nah they're both sluts.        Ash got blasted with so much shit that he's a minor deity at this point. He will never age. He will never die. He will roam the Pokemon world for all eternity. His body will always be exactly 10 years, 10 months, and 10 days old.     And he will always have the brain of a 10 year old - he will never learn, he will always job.     since Black and White, the protagonists have all been AT LEAST 14 which is legal in Japan.   though I do guess perhaps ORAS might still be different since remake and all that.       I bet they would have been great in any anime      Nah I know, I've played every game to date, and watched the anime.    I wish they would have gotten May's original design and her pure waifu personality on or/as.  it also has great pokemon  Pokemon was a mistake   Nah, even a 10-year-old can learn. In fact, they're irritatingly good at that. Ash did a pretty good job of dealing with Fairy-types with a Fighting-type in his latest gym battle, so clearly he's figured something out about not jobbing. Who knows, maybe he'll find a way to grow up some day.  Maybe it'll work too well and he'll become a giant. Maybe he'll end up building a turbolaser to resurrect Pikachu and spend the next 3000 years atoning for it.     Speaking of the anime, has anybody gone back and started rewatching the series from the beginning all the way through?     Ash becomes AZ   Sasuga.       someone needs to slow this down     Or a webm so I can pause it.     Nah, the first season is bad. Ash is a total faggot. But I'd rewatch Orange league.     dat puffy vag    The purest  Why is she so under-appreciated?    Because Sky Battles are shit, she didn't deserve this.       You're not wrong, but at the same time, I would think there'd be more fans regardless of game mechanics. Even the freediver was pretty simple to battle, and she's just as under-appreciated.   Serena is waifu tier   Cute or sex?       you will never be forced to call him master and obey his every command     Underrated post    sex    My nigga.    Minbreak.    You disgust me.    My dick!    You shouldn't do mean things to White.   Post best pokemon  vanilla  doujins.   I want to violate her.     Shut it, kid.     Only recently did I take note of how stupidly nubile Rosa's body is. I never understood why people liked her until I saw the good shit. My fucking God, when I die bury me in that ass.  May=Rosa&gt;Hilda&gt;Green&gt;Dawn&gt;Silver (or whatever that bitch from Gen II is named)      I wanna show her my dick.   Should I pick up the pokemon adventures manga?  guess i'll start with the best villian   yes. much better than the anime counterpart    http://exhentai.org/g/339759/ab4dac<wbr>1618/ http://exhentai.org/g/533163/7b2844<wbr>b039/</wbr> </wbr>   Sugimori mastered the fine art of drawing cute girls. Gamefreak should make a game focused around that and cash on it. Only creatures, no pokemon.  I want her milk   Breeding material     hating based Kris     Yes. It's different from the game and the series. http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>02067 Some guy uploaded the first 13 volumes in good quality.</wbr>       Yes.   What a qt.   Kindergarten teacher    Holy shit   what pokemon would you fuck   also a slut        No pokemon, but gijinka yes.     That's not stupid sexy Domino        <br/>    My favourite movie, and favourite bad girl.        I want her to step on me    <br/>   Damn I wish TR weren't such a joke in the anime. Poor Giovanni.     They were good in the beginning       that Serena       For all of like 3 episodes.     You have the right idea.    First 2d waifu.   Nobody ever mentions the female Ranger.  Oh well more of her for me.      implying you can have more than one waifu   implying a waifu can be anything other than 2D      this TR was never good.  now shut up and post Jessie in outfits that aren't her usual shit one.      Rangers are sluts.    Or Crystal, even. I remember many nights of fapping to her bike spats years ago, to that cover on that volume of Pokespe.    Imagine those biker thighs leglocking you.    I'm still mad she's not in the remakes.     putting your dick in crazy  reminder everyone confirmed to have touched that vag is dead.     I remember that. When she dropped her skirt during her introduction, it raised my oak.    It was the nineties, man. I didn't know the rules. My devotion was an ignorant one. I treated her wrong and I lost her.     implying Ruby won't pound the curse away     That's anime logic. Notice in the games that there are clearly trainers younger than 10. There's no rule that you have to be 10 in the games, which makes protagonist ages a bit more vague. Only ones I remember hearing confirmed are that Red is 11 in Gen I, and the Gen V protagonists appear older than other protagonists.    This edgeventures we're talking about, he'll probably explode into a flurry of blood and gore the moment he touches the lips.    The anime just says you need to be 10 to be an official, licensed trainer. There's been plenty of younger kids in the anime using Pokemon owned by others in battle.    All the females drawn by this artist have great hips and thighs, that's why pokegirls are so fappable.     not keeping zinnia as your side waifu for when you need breaks from mays pure loving     tfw you will never a pokegirl    May and Brendan are confirmed 12 in ORAS XY's protags are said to be "the same age" as 16 year old Emma (which doesn't necessarily mean they're 16, but somewhere around there)     got a bigger version of that pic? it'd make a good desktop background.     Shit, I really want to get all the games from gen3 onward and carry my team through all the games, for the experience of it.  But I know I only say I want that and if I do it, I'll end up suffering.  I hope there are more top tier girls in the next game.      The best.    you will never stick your head up there    Roxie is the cutest pokegirl!     When ash dressed like the last one?        She will never call you a worthless pig while you lick her feet      AG    Nah that's the biggest I could find.    breh? I thought I was the only one    She was pretty nice towards everyone other than Iris.    Best pair.     My brains hate her. My heart doesn't give a shit. My dick would lift mountains for her.          Conflict of the peneart     She's an unlikable bitch but damn was her body made for steamy passionate sex.     https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/1565050</wbr>      There's no way I'm the only one.  Mile-high club when?   Not even best yuri pair.    now voiced by Kei Shindo   How does this make you feel?    Why did Iris have to be so shit in the anime?   Nah. Rosa x Roxie just makes sense.       I think the same thing     Is this canon? huahua   Nerdy looking school girls are great.   I don't see how, but okay.    Me too.     no    her midriff does things to me      on related note, is it true that terufuu is dead?   They start having sex on the next page, anon.    he hasn't drawn shit in a long time. last thing he did was korrinaxashxserena    Well it makes much more sense than pairing two people who have never met.    she will never be your teacher    https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm   0 votes   </wbr></wbr></wbr>      She looks like a spoiled ojou.    i don't know     pokeshipping   sense      That's not nerdy, that's slutty.    I want to spoil her with my dick    but candice is pure, anon.    Because otherwise, any new pokegirl would have been way too much of a downgrade. Like going from /a/ to /v/.    Fair enough.    Would this not be the perfect wife? A cultured, classy, fashionable, stern yet warm woman?    I liked the one from Pokemon Platinum the most.  Something about her just triggers me really hard.     Why was Misty so much better in the manga?   Do tell, anon.   MY DICK IS DIAMOND   How do people not know the names of the Pokegirls?    I named her ♂BORIS♂ when I played the game.   Which pairing is shipped harder, Ash and Serena in the anime, or Brendan and May in ORAS?   Ruby and Sapphire in the manga.     Red and Yellow's pikachus are representations of their masters.   They pika each other's chus and have a kid   Implying this is not foreshadowing   Pure my ass, she can't wait to get a taste of the Red D.       I want milk a ghost  The first pokegirl is still the lewdest girl   amen to that     Shh...  Pokegirl with big knockers is sleeping    I swear the character designers of pokemon are fucking magicians. They create such cute and innocent characters yet they manage to incorporate high levels of subtle lewd.    Gotta sell'em all    I wish Iris got to be more of a wild child and less of a naggy "You're such a kid" annoyance.  I love all that smug   I think the reason for that is the target audience. She could easily be a badass character if everything wasn't so sterilized to present to kids. Instead they just relied on that one catchphrase so they wouldn't have to think too much.    Not even the "target audience" liked her. She was just Misty II.     What could have been...     time to fap i guess    She was forgettable tier before the redesign. Now she's hot as fuck.      Her, Burgundy and Bianca were the only reason I still bothered with BW.  Someone post the ass shaking gif      Roxanne is olev     Iris has a friend at home   she doesn't treat said friend like shit   she travels with two other "friends"   she shits on them at a constant rate        Yeah, that was a shame. It's not like they weren't capable of doing it either, they had her relentlessly fighting Drillbur in the flashback, and she went up against a Scolipede iirc.   Jeez Iris. I wish your character was more enjoyable cuz you do things to my dick...     Plus she's the only one of Ash's friends who (other than Gary, I guess) in the games, becomes the mother fucking CHAMPION. Having her be a bit tougher would've been cool.   I want to compile a list and rate all of the girls stats    Pikachu's big adventure   Best anything   I would have agreed if you at least posted Pokemon Adventure's Misty, but come on       that's a dude    and..?   How is Serena gonna fuck up this time?      gardevoir   tits   Absolutely disgusting.         how can she be so perfect?       not enjoying both  You're more right though cause you know if garde was real she'd be the stuck figure she is in the games/anime     the stars aligned when whoever first drew her did so    That fucking picture gets me every time.    Don't think so. But she can do lewd stuffs to you without even touching you.    post her updated design if it's better. I've never liked creepy chicks with perfectly straight dark hair     if it's better   There are many people that aren't too keen about it.     Why was the BW gen so bad?   anime or games bw1/2 were some of the best games     How's this?    that's pretty bad I am not aroused in the least     I need canon-ish proportions still meh     I kinda like it but it's so radically different from her original design, it's hard to believe they're the same person.      pokemon girl thread    no elesa  What are you doing, anon?      her x her Zebstrika OTP     I like it better    For me it's because most of the designs just don't appeal to me. The entire generation had maybe a handful of monsters I didn't think were fucking stupid looking. The girls were pretty nice though.    Your welcome anon      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127128774  the stilizing helps she's cute in these      But b2w2 were arguably the best games.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127128774  What's the one on bottom right?    Gen 4 &gt; 2 &gt; rocket &gt; 3 &gt; 1   Gen 1, she was just a modified Tamer back then.       post Marley or something    Did she have a different gen 2 design? Can't remember.    The one in the middle of that image, while she had the one on the bottom right in Gen 1.    I have to day I do dig the red eyes     The one in the middle of that image  That's her gen 3 design.     Middle is best    I always get confused with her Gen 2 and 3 designs.    Game Sabrina's a friendly pacifist with no particularly apparent personality issues. There's no reason why she can't wear trendy clothes.    The ones in your pic are anime (top left), gen 4 (top right), gen 3 (middle), Special (bottom left) and gen 1 (bottom right)    So Sabrina is Asagi now?    I have no issue with the logic behind her wearing it. The clothes and hair are just so vastly different that it's hard not being quizzical about it.    Battle me, anon    Well she's an actress now.  Most of the returning gym leaders have pretty different looks, though. You'd never guess Misty was Misty unless the game told you.      I like that misty    They are shipped so hard they might as well be an official couple.    They all got a lot more stylish.  Except maybe Lt. Surge. He's pretty much Guile without the ridiculous hair.      She's a movie star, too.   Misty was affected by the timeskip from gen 1 to gen 2.       They are an official couple.    Well, wasn't Asagi supposed to "retire" soon because she was too old? not that it matters in 2d.   So I've been watching some Pokemon-related videos on Youtube and they're all pretty fucking retarded.   Why are you only allowed to carry six Pokemon?   Because GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY, THAT'S WHY   This is all completely reasonable and definitely correct   Jesus Christ, and I thought /vp/ was bad.          Youtube   ever not retarded      her fangs are so good    Her everything is good.    Sabrina Lv 99?

Is the "Ash Is In A Coma" theory finally less prevalent? That was all over the place years ago.    I hope not.    I'd imagine people got bored with the theory once everyone stopped reacting to it.  It's a pretty stupid theory anyway. It completely falls apart the moment you realize that this is a children's show and none of the writers or producers likely ever put that much thought into this shit.  It's like theorizing that Sesame Street is a drug-induced hallucination. It's a show for toddlers, of course it isn't.       Just no   http://shipping.bulbagarden.net/lis<wbr>taz.html  Pokemon fanbase is autistic as fuck.  </wbr>    lost interest since 2nd gen .   get attention back from lewd pokegirls art .   this feel so wrong but my dick keep reacting .        If pokemon was a seinen, they woud fuck all the time, right?        That's exactly why I want it to be all done with.    lost interest   That's how I feel from Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Somehow the previous content and more in current gen isn't compelling enough.         If it was a shoujo they would have made a marriage proposal.  Maybe they did, I don't red the manga    http://exhentai.org/g/826867/2f00fb<wbr>702d/  Thread soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/4chan-guitar<wbr>-whore/fascination-1</wbr>  </wbr>   Some of us want to support this stuff. It's fine if you don't but don't criticize those that do, that's just stupid.    Is this your first time in these threads or are you just trying to stir up shit on purpose?   There is way too much rough sex for me. I want something that has lots of kissing, hand holding and 'I love you's before they start having sex.  Is there a tag for lovey dovey sex?     I wonder how little money the artist receive, 30%?    Just search for vanill- oh wait.   Is Ararararagi a gary stu?   No, he's just dull as shit.    Thank you Amagi-kun.    It is in Owari/Zoku    Thank you Koyomi Onii-chan    The only real Mary Sue of the series is Gaen I think. Everyone else has pretty signifcant flaws.

Should I watch the prequel first, or the sequel first?  It seems a bit weird they stopped making the movies after 2012. It's been 3 years now, and they used to make the movies annually it seems.      ooh~these hot-blooded youths and their lawyers sure are scary~    Just watch the fucking movie    It doesn't matter. This isn't like the Fate series where you need to watch it in a specific order.    I can't, I have to research this first, and then I need to figure out which release has the best encodes and which has bluray source or dvd source, and which has the better translations, and stuff..   What's her name again?   Chico   DOn'T wATCH an ANIMe CALLed boku!!   Has summer officially started?   Are there any other anime like Boku no Pico or Natsuyasumi?
