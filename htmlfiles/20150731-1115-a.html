[ Is yu yu hakusho underatted or overrated?  <br> Doesn't make brawls bad or worse. <br><br>Brawls are boring, monotonous punch fests that get old real fast.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really. Never cared about Jin. Characters who use wind-based abilities always tended to be boring for me.</br></br>  <br>Totes agree, just saying when it comes to brawling anime only YYH and Hajime no Ippo seem to be the only go to things.</br>  <br>I love how you missed the Jimmy Kudo implication since you're such a dyed-in-the-wool dubfag.</br>  <br> Brawls are boring, monotonous punch fests that get old real fast. <br>To you.</br></br>  Kaidou is edgy  So if the Ope Ope no mi can give immortality, can it also take it away?<br><br>If not then what fruit is the opposite? Can that take it away?<br><br>Can Buggy take away Kaidou's immortality?</br></br></br></br>    <br>KidHawPoo confirmed ded then?</br>  <br>The eyebrow closest to the viewer makes it look like he has another eye.<br><br>It's disconcerting.</br></br></br>  <br>No Emerald City. No CP0 arc. No Reverie. 0/10</br>  Am I stupid? I'm reading about various things on the wiki, and a lot of the info is new to me. Did the show do a poor job at explaining things, or did I just not pay enough attention? It seems like a lot of the info I'm finding on the wiki isn't directly stated in the show.  <br><br>Autism samefag</br></br>  <br>No, kowaru was hanging around with sinji a lot kowaru grew on him and really became agape for sinji in that God loved what he saw in sinji and allowed him to either let 3rd impact happen or (inevitably) stop it</br>  <br>I feel sorry for you people. If you can't follow visual exposition, then animation and films as a medium might not be for you. I'd recommend books, but then only stuff from before the 19th century. Moderenist and later literature relies on unconventional means of exposition as well. Games are slowly getting into that too, since the beginning of this decade. <br><br>Most of the best works of art across all media are closed off to you, if you have to have the narrator and characters spoonfeed the story and its meaning to you.</br></br></br>  <br> if you have to have the narrator and characters spoonfeed the story and its meaning to you. <br>But that's exactly what NGE did in episodes 25/26</br></br>  <br>Excuse me, why did you think it was neccessary to invent a whole school of academics regarding the analysis of literature? It's because people are too butthurt to say what they mean. The whole thing is a sham based on the need to feel special.</br>  I want to meld bodies with her.  <br>Shit. I didn't look at the end caption well enough to notice that's a knife pointed at Kajou. I thought she hasn't noticed anything between them so I guess I was wrong. <br><br>I just hope they don't skip the love honey cookies. That scene was golden.</br></br></br>  quality  <br>My brother of African American descent</br>  <br>If they were willing to animate vag juice dripping everywhere then they'll likely animate the cookies.</br>  <br>Why would Anna be so pissed at Kajou? I think Anna should share, she needs to be a better friend.</br>  5 hours till YY Friday!  <br>It's been mentioned before that the Kawasaki and Hikigaya families are close because of their dads being life-long buddies.<br><br>They also have a plan to solve their oldest child's issues  by placing them in a arranged marriage for each other. <br><br> I wish anyway... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does she look sad?</br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  <br>You should've made the OP without the generals' name if the goal was to make it a waifu love thread.<br>Having something like this  in the OP would also help out.</br></br>  <br><br>Hestia's outfit only looks good when you have big tits.</br></br>  So kishi and Oda are dating, right?  <br>Why not?</br>  They are the Naruto to each others' Sasuke  So I found Goro in some random cosplay jav, turns out he's still in business since last winter. <br>Anyone know if he's working on anything recently or has he given up on our waifus?</br>  <br>no love for goro anymore?</br>  <br>He won't stop fugging waifus</br>  What's with the popularity boost of manwha and light novels?  <br><br>Same here. Its hard for me to look through the list and find Japanese titles because the Chinese and Korean titles are so confusing to read.</br></br>  <br><br>I think that says more about the translators than anything. Its not like they take on popular novels because they get paid to translate them.</br></br>  <br> I feel like all manwha and manhua revolve around martial arts <br>Already much better than the typical Jump battle manga.</br></br>  <br>I think Naver might make it happen once webtoons is bigger in the states.They got plenty of decent animation studios at there disposable. <br>I know china is trying their hardest to make there scrub tier animation industry take off.<br><br>http://ac.qq.com/event/pv2015.html [might need Unblock Youku to view the PVs]<br><br>http://ac.qq.com/ [A Main chinese webcomic &amp; anime platform]<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/user/u17com<wbr>/videos [ Current chinese anime ]<br><br><br>Apparently most of the studios are built on the Douga [inbetweeners] workforce which are trying to reverse engineer anime production which can explain to the lack of quality and consistency. As for the moment they mainly adapting there own local web comic into 5- 20 min animated episode series.<br><br>Very true the first couple of waves manhua and manwha are very martial art orientated and a lot of it are unpolished in terms of it's art. I doubt anyone would disagree with that. But its still developing in an alarming rate.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if the first manwha animed isnt Girls the Wild Ill be dissappointed. by far one of the most popular ones</br>   The opening is shit and doesn't get changed throughout the whole anime   <br> OP/ED is japanese rap </br>  <br>To an extent Psycho Pass S2, though it stopped after some time.</br>   Song has a sick bit where it picks up that you wait in anticipation for when watching the OP.    ED is god tier while the opening is non existant   <br>Some Openings of Naruto and shippuden</br>  Who's your Prison School waifu? Pic related.  <br><br>they come out every friday I've heard. so hopefully tomorrow</br></br>  <br>17 hours until the next one airs.</br>  <br><br><br>Im going to be disappointed if he doesnt patch things with klutz-yaoi-chan</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Cool, thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>He has to. She's likely the only woman alive who likes The Three Kingdoms as much as him.</br>  What exactly separates this show from any other run-of-the-mill SoL anime?<br><br>The only character who isn't a total stereotype is the "spacey" girl.<br><br>The hyper girl and the loli are cute, and the dynamic between the two teachers is nice but a little overdone.<br><br>It seems like they always take a joke and repeat it until they've run it into the ground (ex: the scene where they keep hitting each other on the head with the volleyball).<br><br>What am I missing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>However, until you can name something better, it is best by being first since the first thing is the best since it is the first thing. So far, haven't seen anything that has surpassed Azumanga Daioh. Kiniro Mosaic had a good run at it, though and, if you want to count it as the genre, Usagi Drop was doing well to surpass it until the author was strangled by her own hormones.<br><br><br>There were a few, but none that had as much success as Azumanga Daioh.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There were a few, but none that had as much success as Azumanga Daioh. <br>I think K-ON is the top-selling SoL anime, IIRC.</br></br>  <br> Calling Chiyo-chan a loli <br>It sounds so vulgar and disgusting.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, I misunderstood. Yeah, none before Azumanga.<br> So far, haven't seen anything that has surpassed Azumanga Daioh. <br>ARIA and Non Non Biyori.
