Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br><br>I don't care about the integrity of the narrative I just want to be entertained.<br><br>A giant foot could land out of nowhere for no reason and crush Iroha and I'd be all for it cause it'd be funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, that was a great thread.</br>  <br>That was hell</br>  <br>Yahallo~</br>  Have you all wished best girl a happy birthday?    Why is Yukino such a psycho?  <br>Fuck off</br>  This show used to be funny. This show used to be good.  <br>Confirmed</br>  <br>Then the best advice I can give for you is find something else to watch until Spyro finishes 6.5, and maybe re-read the first 5-6 main novels.<br><br>Slice of Life comedy stopped being a thing for Oregairu after that, and Watari isn't just going to change gears all over again when he's starting in on the big finale. If that's not the kind of entertainment you want, you're unfortunately SoL.</br></br></br>  Any good LN illustrations of 8man expressing his need for  genuine ? I don't know if volume 11 has been scanned yet but earlier volumes will do too.  <br>I think "autistic" is the term you're looking for.</br>  Wait a fucking minute, where is the scene where Yukino gives 8man the max coffee and Yui has her trigger face?  <br>She wants the 8 so fucking bad now.</br>  <br><br>No that scene did not have an illustration.</br></br>  <br>Yes, more than a week ago. I'm not sure why you're so late to the party.</br>  <br><br>So what was this line about? My initial thought was that Haruno could obviously tell that Yukino was repeated verbatim what Hachiman told her, so she told Yukino to give Hachiman the phone so she could respond to what Yukino said since it was basically Hachiman who really said it.</br></br>  <br>Hey even girls like her need some happiness.<br><br><br>That was in ep11 but Yui was just smiling.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your initial thought is correct.</br>  <br><br>She has had almost no appearance since her arc.<br><br>Has there been another character who has disappeared so utterly?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the one you're talking about?<br><br>Because this was from the episode they crammed 90% of volume 10 into.</br></br></br>    Season 3 when? I want to get more councelling from Komachi   spyro vol 11 translations never <br> vol 12 eons away <br>what to do now anons</br></br>  <br>plz no bully</br>      <br>Fuck off<br>She can get love from old fat men</br></br>  <br>In the end her love will be from someone more  genuine,  someone who knows the real her.</br>    <br><br>I just wish he'd translate Yukino's diary. She's always been one of the most opaque characters in the series and we finally have something that's from her PoV.<br><br>All I know is that someone said she talks about going abroad and gives her thoughts on what genuine means.</br></br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucken hack.  <br>Seriously.<br><br>Can any anon translate Yukino's diary? Please.<br><br>I can't wait on Spyro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, thank you <br><br><br>I'm retarded to have missed it.</br></br></br></br>  Here's a pastebin for links to all of the interesting Iroha videos out there on Nico.<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW<br>Enjoyhasu~</br></br></br>    <br><br>disingenuous translations incoming</br></br>  Threadly reminder: Gamama a best, and 8man's a fool if he doesn't take Yui so he can spend the rest of his life with this level of hotness.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/xwkbmrkjkw.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>  It's nothing but pining for Hayato seriously guys! </br></br>  <br>Reminder Iroha is a goddess</br>  <br>Thanks anon. I am willing to accept any translation, even your disingenuous translation.</br>  <br>It basically says that<br><br>You are a fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, Yukino going far off end is confirmed, probably with a time skip. At least she knows she has problems.</br></br>  <br>No please don't go bakuman on me</br>  <br>Too many difficult kanji</br>  <br><br>It's just a collection of everything 8man said that day. Maybe she needs it for practice.</br></br>  Hi guys I am the OP if this thread, am I something special?  <br> yukinoshita being a stalker <br><br>make it happen</br></br></br>  <br><br>After reading both Yui's diary and Yukino's diary we can say one thing: Both of these girls have demons they need to address.</br></br>  <br><br>same<br>im a retard who relies on furigana or rikaichan to read anything beyond babbytier  just like how yukinoSHITa relies on everyone to do everything for her :^) </br></br></br>  <br>If by special you mean faggot sure.</br>  <br><br>How is that going bakuman? That shit was as straightforward shounen as it gets minus the timeskipping.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Wow, this could turn into maybe one if the best series if watari is going to do what I think he will. The girls looked like normal schoolgirls everything was a Rom-com in season1, but it goes downhill. Wait. This is schooldays all over. Fuck off watari</br></br></br>  <br>At this point Yukino character is pretty much irredeemable unless there is a timeskip. It isn't a problem where you can just turn on a switch and solve. Going abroad and timeskip would do her good with her request being "wait for me".</br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-a/prologue-2/</wbr>  <br>you retards act like just because she has problems when it comes to love means she has mental issues pertaining to every other aspect of life</br>  so can you really consider these the best years of their lives  <br><br>Thanks Spyro for lurking the thread</br></br>  <br>Translation: I am YukinoSHITa and I don't know what I want. So everyone should suffer for me.</br>  <br>Fucking cocktease.</br>  <br><br>No mention of going abroad or anything like a time skip.<br><br>In fact it's really hard to understand altogether. "Nonsensical ramblings" indeed.<br><br>I guess what you'd expect from Yukino.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blind Yukinofag detected. Her problem concerns her identity, not love. She has no stable sense of her genuine self.</br>  <br><br><br> However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. <br><br>MUH HEART</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants the 8man</br>  <br><br>Alright, basically the way I read it is:<br><br>  Yukino has no idea where she's going or what she wants <br>  She can't define her relationships with Hachiman or Yui even though she keeps trying <br>  She gets embarrassed it seems when she tries to verbalize what she feels <br>  Hachiman wants 'genuine' <br>  Yukino latches onto that as some kind of vague belief that unites them <br>  She can't really hold on to anything but that or even herself <br>  In truth she's depending on that conviction but doesn't seem sure about it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks Spyro. You're forgiven. <br><br>Now you can translate volume eleven leisurely at your own pace.</br></br></br>  daily reminder  <br>Now that's dependency.</br>  <br>You realize you're talking about someone whos never really had friends, let alone close friends and a love interest, right?<br><br>She isn't inherently stupid. She just doesn't know any better because this kind of situation is new to her. This isn't studying for exams or baking cookies. Theres no obvious right answer in a complex situation like this.<br><br>And I've always been liked Yui more but that doesn't mean I can't defend Yukinon. fuck off</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> love <br>M8, none of her problems have anything to do with love.</br></br>  Well I wouldn't care if Yukino would be dependent on me. In fact I would CARE-Y her. <br>Uhh? UUUH?</br>  <br>Hachiman turns to drugs end confirmed</br>  <br>Your mom is a Virgin end confirmed you fuck</br>  <br>She has fallen into the trap of trying to rationalize irrational concepts.<br><br>When you ask what is "something genuine" the obvious answer is an honest relationship. But then you have to question what honest means. Saying what you believe is true.<br><br>Now you have to ask what it means to believe something is true. Well if you're saying it to someone without a clear purpose then you're most likely only saying it because you have doubts in it and as a result you need to affirm those beliefs by voicing them to others. The problem is if you truly believed in the words you were voicing from the start then why would you ever voice them?<br><br>The more you try to break things down to their base components and get a very clear cut definition of "something genuine" the further and further you seem to get away from it.<br><br><br>In the end "genuine" is an irrational concept and so people who seek order and definition will greatly struggle with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Yui trying to get in their way of happiness? <br><br>WHY WON'T SHE FUCK OFF?<br><br>YUIFAGS KILL YOURSELVES</br></br></br></br>  <br>Update yourself, she affected reality that day.</br>  <br>fuck off falseflagger</br>  <br>You can tell its Yukino based on the syntax used;</br>  <br><br>That sounds good. Ima go with that.</br></br>  <br>Wait, so that anon is the second coming of Jesus?</br>  <br>Autism thread was two days ago anon. Everything has been explained.</br>  <br> defending copypastenon </br>  <br>It reminds me of what Hachiman went through with his genuine speech. There was a fuck ton of sophistry in in because he too was rationalizing the irrational. <br><br>Thats why the best answer he could come up with was genuine but even he is unsure what the hell that is</br></br></br>  <br>Was I saying she was stupid? No need to be so defensive. You were the one who was reducing a complex situation to a simple cause i.e. love.</br>  <br> Yukinofags <br>That should speak for itself.</br></br>  <br>WHAT WAS EXPLAINED? TODAY'S MY DAY OFF FROM WORK AND I JUST CAUGHT UP.</br>   muh genuine <br>In-story meme.</br>  <br>What the fuck does that even mean faggot</br>  Yui is a bitch.<br><br>Yukino is actually a weak girl.</br></br>  <br>Haruno definitely treats is like some kind of stupid meme<br><br>Though she's basically just taking the piss out of them anyway</br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Achieving something genuine is like achieving enlightenment.<br><br>Those who want it know what it is but never fully realize it until after they have it. It's a means of making shortcuts in your head to skip past doubt and fear and go straight to what you truly want. It's about achieving harmony between logic and emotion. For those intellectually inclined it might seem like emotion only clouds judgement and thus it may seem right to deny or suppress them.<br><br>The problem is that they are an integral part of human nature and no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase them. Still though, from every logical perspective you could take it never seems right to accept something irrational like emotion and use it to make better decisions.<br><br>Overcoming that mental boundary and moving forward is a process that cannot be described, only known. That is why from an observer or a pursuer it seems like something impossible to attain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>another get.<br><br> how long until this anime lost it heat and we can enjoy reading Iroha fanart and over analyze Iroha scenes in the book? </br></br></br>  <br>Go do that in your weekly Iroha thread.</br>  <br>She isn't anywhere near that big.</br>    Even so, there is something like an answer for us, so I decided to vaguely think of it as the right one. <br>  I don’t mean that in a negative way, but as the initial condition since it’s an answer that should be the greatest common factor for all of us. <br>  I want to believe that is what’s genuine. <br><br>What's she talking about here? Sophistry aside, she does seem to have narrowed onto something in these lines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Zaimokuza one is the best.</br>  <br> she has problems when it comes to love <br>That is wrong. The problem with Yukino is her latching into everything that is closed to her. She is literally a useless moeblob. Her family did the right thing by letting her into the wild alone but all that did was switching the problem from haruno/hayama to yui/8man.<br>Oh Yui love 8man, let me try copying that too.<br>When Yui proposed her solutions where it shit all over Yukino, she was going to take it until 8man cut in.<br>Yukino can't even think for herself. She is a 100% conformist. Yui isn't the dumb one, Yukino is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Janitor deleted it. Apparently they don't want multi Yahari thread. So I wondered when will the B2B threads die out.</br>  <br>She applied basic scientific principles.<br>Eliminate everything that isn't genuine.<br>Whatever's left must at the very least contain "something genuine".<br>So now instead of thinking "genuine could be anything" she now knows that "genuine is related to this idea".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not at all sure, but my guess based on blind conjecture around "greatest common factor" would indicate she believes their desire to be together is what's genuine.</br>  <br> Oh Yui love 8man, let me try copying that too. <br><br>This will be freaking hilarious (and creepy) if it's true.</br></br></br>  <br>They also can't be bothered to check the catalog.<br>There were two other Yahari threads with like 20 replies that didn't get deleted.</br></br>    <br><br> Oh Yui love 8man, let me try copying that too. <br>I mean, that might be where she picks up some of her cues to try and express it like the cookies, but she does have genuine feelings for 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't even fathom such a ridiculous post.</br>  <br>can't believe i missed it</br>  So I guess all we can really glean from Yukino's diary is that she really is a 'monster of logic' just like Hachiman.<br><br>Her diary doesn't say anything tangible about herself or her feelings except to indicate how confused she is.<br><br>If the whole thing really is a long rambling rumination on 'genuine' then it does establish I suppose that finding it out is extremely important to her. And why would that be?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Thanks.<br><br>Yui is such a conniving cunt.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, Yukino starts to subconsciously like 8man romantically by the end of the 3rd volume.</br></br>  <br>How would that redeem her character.<br>She would basically go, then come back some time later and then go "HEY, LOOK, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!".<br><br>Placing every other soap-opera problem on her and then try to solve all that by doing a time-skip is just terrible writing.<br><br>What WW needs to do is retract the idea of ending Yahari soon, and giving this story, at least 5 more volumes to develop Yukino properly, not merely showing her attempting to face them, but actually doing so and then showing, through her actions afterwards, that he has changed for the better, mainly doing so by making her help people out, so that she can also redeem herself from all the unnecessary drama she's brought upon the story and all the fun she's sucked out of it.<br><br>Only that can save her character, but I doubt WW has any idea of how to end this LN properly.<br><br>At this point in time, any end that isn't a Yui End would be bullshit, and I'm a Yukinofag.<br>Not only has Yui try her hardest to get closer to 8man, but she's also tried her best to get closer to and help Yukino. In volume 11 she also showed she understands 8man a lot better than Yukino does, and that she's very concerned about her friends.<br>If despite all of that, Yui loses because of the idea that the first girl has to win this would be bullshit.<br><br>The only way for a Yukino end to work - assuming that's what WW wants - the story needs to go a bit longer, so that Yukino can redeem herself and return all the favours she's received from 8man and Yui.<br>That's the only way a victory of hers will feel fair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's an ideal illusion. Yui's genuine feelings are clearly described in her diary. She was terrified going into her confrontation and had no idea what was going to happen or if she was right.<br><br>Yet somehow you managed to conclude that Yui is a genius saint who calculated every possible outcome and decieved her friends into taking a step closer towards maximum genuine whilst never letting on that she secretly had an IQ of 300.<br><br>Does this sound like an over exaggeration? Good, now you know the feeling.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, leaving and timeskip as a method to solve problems is incredibly lazy on the author's part.<br><br>It's like<br>  I have a problem. <br>  I go away for a while <br>  Unmentioned stuff happens <br>  I come back and I'm all better now. <br><br>We need to see Yukino's improvement happen before our own eyes in the story. The author has invested way too much ink into it to just hand wave it away with a time skip.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> subconsciously  <br> like <br> romantically  <br>[citation needed]</br></br></br></br>  <br>agree, you can't solve the copy paste personality by just going away. She will probably defend on another person when learning abroad anyway.</br>  <br>How the fuck does a Yui end solve Yukino's problems holy shit. You can have a fucking Totsuka end and Yukino could still not be redeemed. Seperate the two issues here ffs</br>  <br> the story needs to go a bit longer, so that Yukino can redeem herself and return all the favours she's received from 8man and Yui. <br><br>You're also falling into the trap of rationalizing irrational concepts.<br><br>There is no equivalent exchange or necessary order of events here.<br><br>All Watari really needs to do at this point is have the service club sit down for a heart to heart story telling time.<br><br>They all have problems and if they all share their experiences and their thoughts about it then they will all learn from the experience and become better people for it. Not only that, but will also all be in a genuine relationship by that point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   eye-fucking in the club room <br> I'm not into younger girls, yup, that's it. Isn't her birthday coming up in april? <br> She's amazing, she can even cook <br> eye-fucking her in the apron <br> Oh god, she used this spoon... but I'm not complaining <br> Wait, she's not talking about the choco?...Still not complaining. <br> Did she just give me cookies? She's so cute, holy shit <br> eye-fucking some more <br> Nope, I'm not falling for it. It's all a trap, yup. Nope, not happening. <br><br> she's gone for the rest of the volume <br>Watari is a cockteasing cunt and I want to kill him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you intend to reply to me? (  )</br></br>  <br>Eh, I don't have too many issues with a timeskip end. I think that 8man and Yui will set Yukino on the right path, but Yukino's problem always felt to me like the sort of thing where you just need to take some time and sort yourself out.<br><br>The only big points she needs to hit on are standing up to her family and deciding for herself what course she wants her future to take. That can be handled in the space of one book, but after that it's just sort of a nebulous settling in period that I don't think we really need to see.</br></br></br>  Yui is a fucking tiger. Hope you don't take characters at face value.  <br>I'm saying how things should be done so that things would be satisfying for the reader.<br><br>If you just have them 3 sit down, talk down their issues, and "poof, problem gone" would be anticlimactic<br><br>I know I'm exaggerating your point, but after all the shit Yukino has got (and as a result, made the story boring) she needs something big to redeem herself (in the eyes of the readers).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uhh why did you put in ship wars at the end of your post. It dilutes your argument<br><br>I thought we were discussing what Yukinoshita should do to solver her problems not <br><br> Yui should win the 8bowl because she has tried her hardest </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Monster of Logic <br> She's just copying Hachiman and really doesn't have thoughts of her own. </br></br>  I just want 8man to end up happy<br>is that too hard, WW?</br>  <br>This is what happens when you waste paper and ink on something like 10.5.</br>  <br>I'll agree to disagree then.<br><br>There is no real reason why she has to go through some kind of redemption arc when she doesn't owe anyone anything. You're creating that problem that doesn't actually exist.</br></br></br>  <br>She was already like that before she met 8man, that's one of the first things he realized when they met is that they were similar.<br>That is unless she is able to emulate anyone upon meeting them.</br></br>  <br>Most anons here work on a merit/demerit system when it comes to relationships, that's why.</br>  So it's been a while since I've seen these get dropped in thread, but now that I've remembered they exist I've been listening to them for the past hour.<br><br>https://soundcloud.com/droplamp/yuk<wbr>itoki-koc-remix<br>https://soundcloud.com/kntkhk/kan-t<wbr>akahiko-remix-3<br>https://soundcloud.com/pylonix/hell<wbr>o-alone-pylonix-house<br>https://soundcloud.com/okilax/harum<wbr>odoki-on-gemini-bpm87<br><br>Anyone know of any other good /Yahari/ remixes?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Do you guys think Yui might have tried getting with Hayato, so she befriended Miura and acted like a doormat only later try and backstab Miura to get Hayato?<br><br>She might have heard about Yukino and 8man, so she wanted to play a better high stakes game, so she dropped Hayato</br></br>  <br>That was 8man putting her on a pedestal. Remember the real Yukino isn't a strong, logical girl. That was a facade. She's actually a moe moe autistic girl.</br>  <br><br>She seizes on what Hachiman wants and then has invested a massive amount of thought to figuring out what exactly it is when it's actually not that complicated. That's where the "Monster of Logic" comes in.<br><br>The question that is relevant to her feelings and which her diary at least appears to not address is why what Hachiman wants matters so much to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can definitely see her following Yui around in this episode<br><br>But that's more just having no idea how to express her feelings properly than her liking 8man because Yui does, that would just be really creepy</br></br></br>  <br>But her properly addressing her issues is character development, and highly relevant to her character.<br><br>Why would you want all of that skipped is beyond me.<br>The journey is what is most important, don't you agree with that?<br><br><br>I was addressing both points.<br><br>1. How should Yukino's problems be addressed.<br>2. If WW wants Yukino to win (assuming he's planning or that or any romantic end at all), how that should play out.<br><br> Yui should win the 8bowl because she has tried her hardest <br>Wouldn't you have a bitter aftertaste if she loses after all she's done, whilst Yukino has barely done anything important for the rest?<br>I'm not talking here about what's fair and what isn't, because love isn't fair, but about the after-taste a poorly written end would leave on the readers.<br><br><br> There is no real reason why she has to go through some kind of redemption arc when she doesn't owe anyone anything. <br>So that it feels satisfying.<br>If you feel her simply talking with people and then her problems are gone, than good for you, but I'm sure most readers would like to see her get a proper redemption.<br><br>Sure, she owes no one a thing, but at the same time, but that doesn't justify her character nor does it make an anticlimactic end, like the one you describe, any more desirable for most.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>He is clearly Yuifags</br>  Based commie  <br>How is he baiting?<br>What that guy said is something 8man realised this volume.<br><br>The strong, independent Yukino was all part of her Ice Queen façade.<br>She was never really like that.<br>She pretty much put up that wall to hide how fragile she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She has changed and redeemed someone. That person is Hachiman. The very first request in the series was Sensei telling Yukino to change Hikigaya. The entire story is about these two growing up, changing each other (with the help of other characters), and finding an answer together<br><br><br>Anyways, Timeskip is fine<br><br>What is not fine is WW uses the so I'm going away and when I come back I'll have found my answer. No, thats fucking awful<br><br>Timeskip is fine under these conditions:<br> Yuki fully explains her situation with her family to Yui/Hachiman so we actually know what the fuck it is without needing any guesswork/connecting the dots <br><br> In the end, she chooses to study abroad on her own accord. Not because of Yui, Hachiman, Haruno, or her mom. But because she 100% wants to go on that path (and not lib arts as she is currently doing to follow Yui/hachi) <br><br>Reminder that Hayama and Yuki's parents want some relationship to each other. Some say its marriage. But you can also achieve a relationship by having them go on different career tracks. Hayama is lib arts. Yuki is Lib arts. Solution? Yuki goes sciences <br><br>Haruno in like VOl 5 said she studies sciences at a local Uni but despised Yuki for going sciences too because she was afraid Yuki would just follow her to the same Uni and not do something on her own merit. <br><br> Maybe because shes in Int. Class J she can choose to study abroad at an elite uni. <br><br>She comes from an affluent family where image is everything. What if Yuki goes abroad? Hey my daughter is studying science at Harvard. Doubt her family would mind that at all</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Duel me motherfuckers  <br>nah</br>  <br>I bet this is going to end with 8man attempting to turn Yukino's strong girl Ice Queen facade into the real Yukino.<br><br>He's seen that she's capable of standing up for herself without the need to depend on someone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't they need to be on the same career track for working relationship?</br></br>  <br> She has changed and redeemed someone. That person is Hachiman. <br>How did she redeem Hachiman?<br>Sure, she's one of the many people that has influenced him, but Hachiman has changed through his interaction with many people, and many by his own introspection of what he's gone through.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Watari isn't just going to keep up with his ambiguous, pretentious writing style till the very end <br>Never have I hated the Japanese language so much before.</br></br>  <br>Who can stop Iroha from winning the 8bowl if Yukino goes aboard? Yui?</br>  <br>That doesn't change that timeskips are shitty excuses for development.</br>  <br>Keika.</br>  <br><br>Wataru Watari</br></br>  <br> Yuki fully explains her situation with her family to Yui/Hachiman so we actually know what the fuck it is without needing any guesswork/connecting the dots <br> &gt;In the end, she chooses to study abroad on her own accord. Not because of Yui, Hachiman, Haruno, or her mom. But because she 100% wants to go on that path (and not lib arts as she is currently doing to follow Yui/hachi) <br>Maybe I'm alone with this, but I don't understand how you guys find this acceptable.<br><br>So, for you a timeskip is okay as long as she accepts she has a problem, and confronts her parents.<br>However, how she deals with her problems is, somehow, not important and can be left to a timeskip?<br>Really?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed with this post. Watari wrote himself into a corner by piling on cliche after cliche and problem after problem on character: Yukino. It's a pretty poor way to build drama for your story since it just creates a black hole of negativity that shits all over the character.<br><br>This would be fine with proper development, but considering we only have 1, maybe 2, volumes left to go I'm not seeing how he can properly resolve her character arc.</br></br></br>  <br> Miura </br>  <br>Surprise ending</br>  <br>What he said was completely true. The Yukino we all knew is a lie. The real Yukino is an autist with dependency issues.</br>  Is it supposed to be vague and unclear that Yukino is in love with 8man?  <br><br>I like them dubs.<br><br>Btw, Keika can be easy bought by some sweets or candies. No match for Slyroha. And WW is a cockteaser who ships Iroha as hard as us shippers.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree with you.<br><br>If Yukino goes abroad, she can't be wrestling with her problems as she does it. It needs to be fixed and then she goes abroad.<br><br>I also don't really want a timeskip period. The story can end with her going abroad and bidding farewell and leave it to us what happens after that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Everything about Yukino is vague and unclear.<br><br>That's why there have been endless arguments this entire season about Yukino.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She has changed and redeemed someone. <br>You make it sound like Yukino is the only who did that, when it's more a collective effort of everyone who interacted with Hachiman and his own desire to change.<br><br><br>As far as I understand, he's saying a timeskip end because we only have like 1 volume left. There's no way her issues can be resolved properly without some sort of timeskip in that amount of time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She was lifeless in most of volume 9 because she had no one to copy <br> She copied Hachiman when btfo of Tamanawa </br></br>  <br>Is that good writing, or bad writing?</br>  <br>Now this is the one I can agree with.<br><br> Miura and Iroha now compete for the 8bowl since Hayama already goes study abroad with Yukinoshita. My (netori) romcom is wrong as I expected. </br></br></br>  <br><br>We could have another volume after 12. A lot of people are speculating there will be at least one more volume.<br><br>But I don't really view Yukino's issues as requiring massive amounts of text to resolve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I expected WW to do something about the whole Yukinoshita family problem but Vol11 didn't do anything, honestly. <br><br>It even ends on a huge fucking cliffhanger for fuck's sake</br></br></br>  <br> But I don't really view Yukino's issues as requiring massive amounts of text to resolve. <br>these anons are expecting a master's thesis on how her character will change in vol12 and maybe 13. They don't realize it has been changing but in a different way that they think</br></br>  <br> As far as I understand, he's saying a timeskip end because we only have like 1 volume left. There's no way her issues can be resolved properly without some sort of timeskip in that amount of time. <br>But that would still not be acceptable. It would still be bad writing, because WW would be leaving the most important part of her development (i..e. how Yukino solves her problems) to a timeskip.<br><br>A whole different issue would be to show her deal with all her problems, and then by the end have her go abroad, not because she has problems left to deal with, but simply because she really wants to go, and then you do a timeskip with her coming back.<br>Now that would be acceptable, though still cliché.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh I wasnt being clear. The timeskip is at the very end of the novels when she leaves for college or maybe 3rd years. All her problems would have been settled by then and we just see her goodbye or something. I thikn she will go abroad because Watari made her in international class J for a reason (I think...)<br><br>Anyways, her leaving at the end also removes one of Hachiman's other misguided thoughts, that relationships always reset and that you will always grow distant from each other. <br><br><br>It wouldnt be in the middle of the series; that's stupid<br><br><br>I know I implied that but every semi revelvant character has done so yes. But Sensei specifically made a request just to Yukino to change him so theres no doubt Watari will use that again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's good writing if he actually decides to address said ambiguities which he hasn't really done all that much yet, so it's in between for now.<br><br>Another thing I hate about how Watari handles Yukino is he seems to be painting her as always being in the wrong while everyone else is right. Can't tell if he has a grudge against rich people or people like Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br>I have this suspicion that volume 12 will bring up issues on Haruno's part with regards to her inability to believe anything genuine exists.</br>  <br>It's more that realistically speaking, codependency isn't something you can solve within a few days or weeks. You can't just force someone to suddenly stop relying on others to enable their behaviour, or to develop their own identity. It's a process that takes tons of psychological therapy over a long period of time with gradual lifestyle changes to rectify, and even then some people relapse.<br><br>Watari kind of fucked himself with this whole dependency thing by piling it on too much and too quickly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's writing I dunno.<br><br>Generally it's good when an author writes his characters in a way that leaves open room for speculation. But not when it reaches the point of leaving the readers utterly frustrated.<br><br>We should also remember that we're getting a translation of a work that's already unclear at times and open to debate. So we have it worse than the Nips do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's doing that to force her to change into something better<br> but as a Yukinofag it hurts me too much </br></br>  <br><br>  piling it on too much and too quickly <br><br>Thus we probably shouldn't assume that Yukino's recent appearances is the end-all-be-all to her. It's a demon she has to wrestle with, but it doesn't wholly define her. She has shown a better quality in the past. Haruno herself has been impressed with Yukino in the past.</br></br></br></br>  Yuckyno a shit. A SHIT.  <br>She solves her problems by making her own choices and desires. What if her desire in the end is to go abroad to study? What is that is what Yukinoshita really wants? I have no fucking idea but hopefully you get my point<br><br>I dont know why you guys are making this harder than it is. She lacks an identity, she follows others footsteps, she doesnt choose for herself even when she had the freedom to (Haruno doesnt have said freedoms). She just needs to have confidence in herself and figure out what the fuck she wants, to find her self. Its not rocket science. There doesnt need to be 5+ volumes of shit to redeem her</br></br></br>  <br> Another thing I hate about how Watari handles Yukino is he seems to be painting her as always being in the wrong while everyone else is right. <br>literally everyone in the series is wrong, except for possibly sensei, and she even implies in episode 12 that she doesn't understand the service club members completely<br><br>there's also the implication that Haruno's projecting a lot on Yukino with her shit<br><br>this is literally the entire premise of the series, that everyone is fucking wrong about their beliefs<br><br>Is it really that hard to detect subtext or</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I know I implied that but every semi revelvant character has done so yes. But Sensei specifically made a request just to Yukino to change him so theres no doubt Watari will use that again. <br><br>It's pretty cliche for the mentor (sensei) her acting like a medium for god (the author). I just hate those plot devices.</br></br></br>  <br> years later, at Tokyo University, 8man see Miura on campus <br> he see her but walks past her <br> she see him walking by and she stops him <br> "you're not going to say hi?" <br> "uhh oh... hi" <br> weeks later, Hachiman and his colleagues go to a bar to drink <br> Miura happens to be invited by that group along with her friends <br> A couple drinks later, she's drunk and starts going off about how Hayato went to America leaving her to 8man <br> She's about to puke, so 8man takes her outside <br> she's about to knock out <br> so he princess carries her to his house <br> she sleeps on his bed while he sleeps on the floor with no blanket <br> she wakes up and see he's lying on the floor <br> she panics and checks her vagina <br> she's safe and blushes angrily at 8man then gets up and walk home <br> later that day, 8man walks up to her and says you forgot this and hands her the jacket she wore that night <br> "hey hikitani, w-wanna grab some coffee?" <br> "it's not hikitani its hikigaya <br> 8man walks away <br> hey, she pulls his arm and pull him around and kisses 8man <br> sorry hikigaya </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Can't tell if he has a grudge against rich people or people like Yukino. <br>First nice girls, now this?</br></br>  <br> Thus we probably shouldn't assume that Yukino's recent appearances is the end-all-be-all to her. <br>I'd say her issues with dependency is a very central part of her character and getting over that isn't something that can realistically happen in one volume. I mean it could, but for any normal person, it requires a large suspension of disbelief.</br></br>  <br> Wouldn't you have a bitter aftertaste if she loses after all she's done. <br>Was in your mind Yui only existed as romance bait? if yes she has no different than Iroha, why Iroha doesn't win instead. It is because Yui has friendship with Yukino that Yui even get involve in Yukino's problem it has nothing to do with winning 8man bowl, or in your mind Yui did everything she did so she can win 8man do you think she is not sincere with Yukino? if yes than she is worse than Yukino.</br></br>  <br>Does a "self" even really exist?</br>  <br>No one is expecting avant garde writing, just a satisfactory conclusion to her character, in which she doesn't simply realise her issues, but faces them, deals with them and then is given some time to show how much she's developed.</br>  <br>Everyone's pretending to understand what the fuck is going on but in reality they don't. No one does except Watari.</br>  <br> these anons are expecting a master's thesis <br>Strawman harder, faggot.</br></br>  <br>I feel like in Yukino's case it's been pretty extreme ever since the end of volume 7. But I felt 7-10 were good. Volume 11, however, kind of jumped the shark.<br><br> I blame the anime. </br></br></br>  <br>You're thinking realistically when you should think fictionally and Watari will likely resolve Yukino's dependency with an asspull. Although, you are right and I don't disagree.</br>  <br> hikitani <br> not Hikio <br>0/10 immersion ruiined.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura calls him hikio not hikitani</br>  <br> &gt;hey, she pulls his arm and pull him around and kisses 8man <br>this is way too fast.</br></br>  <br>this is true but I don't think 1 volume is enough to wrap things up<br>also timeskip IMO is a far fetch but it's been done in worse situations where you expect something to happen but never does, I hope watari properly closes the series but it seems hard, hopefully he doesn't do a timeskip</br></br>  <br> literally everyone in the series is wrong <br>Hardly any of them have caused as many issues as Yukino, though.<br>Not to mention the only relevant characters in this story are 8man, Yukino, Yui and now Iroha.<br>Yui and Iroha barely have any serious flaws and hardly cause any issues.<br><br>8man is presented as a flawed character, but he's the one who's solved every other issue. And even when the story tried to tell you his methods were flawed, it went out to show you his methods did help Rumi, Ebina was happy he helped her and Iroha gained a lot from his help. So, even when 8man is wrong he's correct.<br><br>Compare that to Yukino who's become a complete fuckup, not once has she done anything particularly relevant to help others (as in, she's the main reason someone could be helped), and time and time again she's shown as incapable of overcoming her own issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Doffy Nico for your heart!  Anyone else want God Usopp's bounty to go up by an unprecedented amount? Maybe from $30 million to $300 million? It might happening when hundreds of former pirates and other ne'er-do-wells leave Dressorsa spreading word of how Usopp broke the Hobby curse and how they revere him as a messiah.<br><br>Not to mention having Usopp's bounty the 2nd highest in the crew is like poetry.</br></br>  <br>Usopp is the best crewmember, so yes</br>  <br>He lost so quickly it's unreasonable or should I say unbelievable. When I was reading the chapter there was no sense of "OMFG!" it was just an "eh? Oh Doffy's lost oh well" I'm not even hype for the future arcs after this bullshit. This really is a poor man's alabasta arc.<br><br>I wish Oda stopped dickriding the chapters. had he just fused the final chapters together it wouldn't have been so bad. Oda's losing his fucking edge.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, 100m is the most likely. I think Usopp might be getting Luffy's previous bounties. Completely baseless, yea, but hey.</br>  Aokiji was haki stabbed by Shirohige, Akainu was haki sliced by Marco and Vista, Crocodile was (haki?) decapitated by Doflamingo.<br>How come they survived that? Can haki users with logia powers block haki attacks or something?</br>  <br>They changed shape so the attack didn't hit them. Crocodile was clearly not Haki decapitated. Aokiji literally does this like the next page after he gets stabbed.</br>  What powers will kaido have?<br><br>I'm betting on one of the following<br><br> Typhon Mystical Zoan <br> Hydra Mystical Zoan <br> Sabre tooth tiger Zoan <br> Blood Logia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A plain ol' Lion Zoan. King of the Beasts, motherfucker. Enies Lobby 2.0 with Chopper Rescue Plot incoming.</br>  <br>Quickly? Lmfao.<br><br>I was honestly getting bored with this prolonged arc. A one on one fight should in my opinion not take several weeks.<br><br>Not that realism and manga go hand in hand, but a one on one fight where both opponents are like fucking gods and it just never ends are really boring.<br><br>I think the reason series like Naruto and Bleach always turn to shit in the end is just that. The ridiculous power ups they always get. Shit becomes really boring when that last drop of realism gets thrown out the window.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then why don't they do that all the time when they get injured? Aokiji lost a leg for fuck's sake.<br><br>If they can just change shape to evade the haki attack, then what's the point of haki attacks? They were brought up especially so that a normal human being could defeat logia users.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because they can't ? They fought for 10 fucking days, dude. Both of them were heavily injured. You think Aokiji is going to be on tip top shape on Day 9th when Akainu was throwing a fucking Magma rock at him ? Hell no. The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel''</br>  <br>God Mystical Zoan. Or devil.<br><br>Probably not, it will be some generic albeit strong animal. But I want Oda to go all out here.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel'' <br>That was literally what it was brought up for in the first place though. And anyway, the fact remains that a haki user can hit logia users, and that rule simply did not seem to apply when Aokiji got stabbed.</br></br>  If Doflamingo could make clones of himself, why didn't he get more outlandish and just copied himself exactly to the detail? Why not go full Bayonetta and create some weird string beasts?  <br>Because Aokiji didn't get hit. It's that simple. The attack simply didn't hit him. You could say he just dodged. It's not that hard to understand. And iirc, CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia.</br>  Does anyone know what kind of island Zou is? Sounds like it would be related to wano/Kano  <br>Haki showed up in the literal first chapter.</br>  <br>Probably because it would be very weird. And Doffy could probably only make some Flamingo's which would have made Luffy lose his shit.</br>  <br>Hmm, in that case I find it weird that Aokiji looked so shocked when being stabbed.<br>Also, Rayleigh could stop Kizaru with a strike of his sword, wouldn't Kizaru possibly be able to dodge it the same way?<br>Then again he did not get hurt by that. Also, Marco sent him flying with a kick, so Kizaru probably just isn't that good at dodging things? Or does not care because he is Kizaru.<br><br> CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia. <br>Same difference. It circumvented a devil fruit power to hit the user.<br><br><br>But it was not adressed by name and described expositionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People speculate that it is the Korea to Kano's Japan.</br>  <br>King of Beasts fruit.</br>  <br>Big Dick 90inch Mystical Zoan, I'm calling it right now.</br>  <br>Remember when people thought Akainu had blood logia? good times</br>  <br>LMFAO</br>  <br>Black person zoan. Luffy will have to play basketball against him for the title of Yonko. When Kaido reveals his awakened zoan he turns into Shaqaido o'Neal and is like 20 feet tall. To keep up, Luffy will perform a full body gear 3, and also get back his afro power from the Foxy boxing fight.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl<wbr>wOe6WKz4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Aokiji just looks serious. Not shocked whatsoever. Kizaru is a lazy shit and you know it. And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. And Rayleigh kept up with a fucking Light dude. That could be also a clue. <br><br>And it still hits Devil Fruit users. You just have to not be a scrub. Which Luffy won't be when he fights Akainu.</br></br></br></br></br>  quote me on this one<br><br>its going to be a monkey zoan</br></br>  <br>quoted <br><br>ayyyyoooo lmaoooo</br></br></br>  <br>Mythical King Kong Zoan who gets taken out by Luffy's Gear 5 "King Kong Jet Pistole Pasta Machine"</br>  <br>kek'd</br>  <br>I can see this happening in Gintama very soon.</br>  <br>I think he looked shocked, but fair point. It just seems like a minor inconsistency to me, but I can write it off as "haki raises your chances against logia types" rather than seeing as like "haki always beats logia".<br><br> And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. <br>Well, he's been a marine for the same amount of time and was known as a "monster" back then aswell. So I just jumped to that conclusion.<br><br>Also, I find it kinda sad that we probably won't ever have a marine as strong as the red-yellow-blue admirals with Shengoku on top. Fujitora apparently is much weaker than the other admirals (though obviously he has still time to prove himself) and I don't have really high hopes for green bull (will he maybe be a zoan user? we don't really have any zoan marines other than The Buddha).<br>It feels like Luffy will never defeat the marines at the zenit of their power, even if he beats Akainu at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do you best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>We don't even know if they both had fruits back then. And if we're going by the movie info, Zephyr says that Kizaru relies on his fruit too much so we can assume that he is a cocky prick that won't think about dodging that much. And Rokugyu and Fujitora has been called ''Monsters'' too.</br>  <br>But Fujitora seems so much weaker than the previous admirals. It would seem unreasonable that the marines could simply replace their strongest forces that were intact for the decades without a drop in power - though obviously possible.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  Damn, I keep forgetting how few logia users there actually are. Seems like so many more because Smoker was introduced early, but many that seem to be logias from memory are just logiaesk paramecias, like Mr. 3, Jozu or Magellan.<br>It feels like thee are more characters that have conqueror's haki than logia powers (though that obviously is not true.)</br>  <br>An actual high bounty's capabilities horrified Usopp. He's not there yet.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=egJ<wbr>_tcZC0Ek</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I wouldn't bet against Oda just yet, we've seen the extend of the Marines but not of the World Government. <br><br>We know for sure a new generation of Pacifista is coming, no clue what Vegapunk is up to, CP0 has been on the sidelines.

People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are "hated" by the sea, and cannot swim. The "sea" here can refer to anything from rivers, pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level, they are all the "sea." When these people enter the water, not only can they not use their powers, they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit, but it wouldn't do much good. That's if their entire bodies are submerged in the "sea." With less than half the body or just the limbs, it gets easier. Also, rain and dripping water have no effect at all. Therefore, hip baths or showers are the most common choice. Now, in Crocodile's case, "water" is the weakness of his very powers, so his abilities are robbed even in the shower. But it's not like there are enemies around when you take a shower, so I'd bet he would take them even with his powers being blocked. Don't you think? ---And to answer your final question, about myself bathing. As it happens, I do bathe. Twice! In a year! </br></br></br>  <br>You could easily rape crocodile while he's taking a shower</br>  <br>So let me get this straight. So if you want your kid to be strong, determined, and successful, all you have to do is make his middle initial D? Why isn't everyone a D then?</br>  <br>it is not the name, it is the bloodline</br>  <br>Because not everyone believes in that superstition.</br>  &lt;- who knew?  <br>If I ever have a kid his middle name will be D</br>  <br> opmemes.com </br>  <br> Shotamingo has an adorable girl voice <br><br>Nice<br>Now why couldn't they do that with Law?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou is Kaku with his awakened Giraffe Zoan, which turns him into a Kirin. <br><br>On a more serious note, I'm expecting one of the following<br><br> Mystical/Ancient Zoan <br> Godzilla Zoan <br> Lion Zoan <br> Something that seems dumb like a Flea Zoan or a Tardigrade Zoan that is actually retardedly powerful <br> Paramecia that lets him summon animals rather than become them <br> Something that lets him turn into any animal and mix and match them (Something like Ultimate Kars) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffin Zoan</br>  <br>You're not serious right?

Better than ever. <br><br><br>???</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm one of those people who thinks he wasn't trying, both with the meteor and pushing the birdcage because otherwise his bet on Luffy wouldn't work for his plan.</br>  Kaido will have a Dragon mythical zoan. The whole thing with Wano and Kinemon's reaction imply it.  <br>Really you're arguing Garp has never been shown using conquers haki <br><br>did you even read dressrosa when garp it on chinjao<br><br>did you skip marineford where ivankov stated dragon had it <br><br>Why are you even in this thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What will happen now?<br><br>Will they go after Sanji and the rest and fight Big Mom? Or Kaido will appear first?</br></br>  <br>Nah bruh he has that mythical/ancient Godzilla zoan, and Law and Luffy are gonna need Dino Drake to take him down</br>  <br>he said that after timeskip.<br>refering to how much he has grown those past 2 years</br></br>  <br>Garp doesn't have conquerors you sperglord, the proper translation wasn't "So he inherited it", it was "So he has it". Which could practically mean anything. Against CHinjao it was only Conquerors haki.</br>  <br>5 more chapters of Rebecca crying all over Luffy's face, shots of every part of Doflamingo except his face and Gatz mouthing off about wieners.</br>  <br>You're 110% retarded</br>  <br>haha really?<br><br>Man Luffy looks younger to me Post TS so I guess that reference went right by me</br></br></br>  <br>Troll confirmed</br>  <br>...you mean Armament but you said Conquerors</br>  <br>How does he look younger? Nothing about him changed.</br>  <br><br>My meant against Chinjao it was armament, am in a hurry to go out.</br></br>  <br>I swear his eyes got bigger or something. His proportions definitely changed though. He's softer-looking since the skip</br>  <br>Chinjao and Garp had a fucking clash of conquers haki you speed reading normie</br>  <br>No they fucking didn't, show me the page. We've seen armament haki clashes look the same with sparks everywhere as well.</br>  <br>What? Did you even read the first half of the series? Luffy looked goofy as fuck up until Water 7. After time skip his upper body looks a little wider, too.</br>  <br><br>First they need to find out who is giving them a ride to wherever they're going because they sure as shit arent getting there on the Sunny</br></br>  <br>that's what im sayng you dip<br><br>he doesnt look the same as he did for the TS. He's younger looking</br></br></br>    <br>is Law's arm on backwards?</br>  <br>Fujitora seems to have gotten his fruit recently going by his words, maybe he'll get stronger.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you saying? Widening of the upper body makes a guy look older. Oda even gave size changes in an SBS and Luffy grew like 5 inches or something. I don't see how you can think he looks younger</br>  A episode worth watching next week  <br>The current group is Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Robin, Franky, Law, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro, can Luffy fit two 9 feet giants on his back.</br>  <br>I already said his eyes are bigger. It's his face that looks younger not his body</br>  <br>Luffy only grew two centimeters, that's like one inch.</br>  <br>Aw Yeh<br><br>It's about damn time<br><br>though the.. makeup looks off? Why are all the lines so thin?</br></br></br></br></br>  What is this?  It's a cat, you twit  <br>It's a Menchi.</br>  <br>emergency rations</br>  <br>A bad anime.</br>  <br>a stray left over from Excel Saga</br>  <br>Menchi was actually cute unlike this piece of shit.</br>  <br>Reincarnation of Yuuta<br>In Shintoism, the mourning period is 49 days after the person dies, and in Buddhism, it takes 49 days to be reincarnated.<br><br>Also notice that Yuuta's picture fell down when they heard it, and named it after his panchira fetish (panchira means "panty peek", and the chira in Chiranosuke means "peek"). Of course, he runs off with the panties in the end.<br><br>And just because he's his reincarnation, it doesn't mean they're the same character either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Chironosuke is reincarnation of Yuuta who already possessed very strong spirit power and can travel through time? Then he abadoned his body for new Yuuta who traveled back to tell the old ghost Yuuta about meteor? So basically we can assume that Yuuta and Chironosuke are both Pine from different time lines. Am I right?</br>  <br><br><br><br> It's a chinchilla, a kind of persian cat. <br><br>Didn't you listen to Ito? :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it takes 49 days to be reincarnated <br><br>It doesn't look like a newborn kitty</br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Basically, Chiranosuke is what happens when Yuuta succeeds in stopping the meteor, but dies in the process. Even if the loop happened over 4 billion times, that's just 4 billion times for that Chiranosuke, that Yuuta that succeeded but died.<br><br>Now as for why he becomes a spirit later on to help Yuuta, that's also up for interpretation. It could be that Yuuta's spirit powers were high enough after dying. I also think that line Rabura throws out when exorcising Tsubouchi Qmay is interesting, when she splashes "God's sacred sake" on him, which is what Chiranosuke is always drinking.<br><br>Chiranosuke also talks about the "Human Preservation Project", which he could have come up with on his own, but it sounds like something he was collaborating on with someone else. If I had to guess, God. Now this gets into really speculative territory, but the game supposedly has 10 more episodes of content to it, and loops occur much more frequently.<br><br>God makes Chiranosuke a spirit so as to help Yuuta stop the extinction of humanity. That's probably what he did to the original Yuuta after VR-1 hit the first time, and then that Yuuta (or a later one) stopped it, became Chiranosuke, and then helped out future Yuutas. The big question here is how to end the loop.<br><br><br>It's a kitten, so it was born after Yuuta died, but it became his reincarnation then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rabura throws out when exorcising Tsubouchi Qmay is interesting, when she splashes "God's sacred sake" on him, which is what Chiranosuke is always drinking. <br><br>deep</br></br></br>      Is it gay to be attracted to chiyoko-yuuta and not chiyoko-guriko?  <br>Yes. We all thought he was a guy for almost 6 episodes</br>  Where IS the Punchline, damn it?!  <br>Do you think Chiranosuke mentors Yuta #6,373,153,741?</br>  <br> #6,373,153,742 <br>I mean</br></br>  can someone explain the finale for me please?  I knew it was going to be a buy the game for true ending yet I still watched it. I'm so pissed but damn it I'm going to have to buy the game now  <br>You mean #6,373,153,743, and I'm not sure, actually. Chiranosuke is present in the game, and he makes you pull pranks, but it's not like the Yuuta that just went back in time needs him there, though the now disembodied Yuuta might. If they can get a system going where each Yuuta tells the next everything that happens and what they need to know, they won't need Chiranosuke.<br><br>#6,373,153,740 = Previous Yuuta/Miyaken<br>#6,373,153,741 = The Yuuta we follow for the entire story<br>#6,373,153,742 = The Yuuta that goes back in time at the end of the anime (already received help from Chiranosuke as a spirit)<br>#6,373,153,743 = The newly disembodied Yuuta at the end of the anime</br></br></br></br></br></br>  shit cat from shit show  <br> #6,373,153,742 = The Yuuta that goes back in time at the end of the anime (already received help from Chiranosuke as a spirit) <br><br>Chiranosuke gives the exact same rules to this Yuta, and approves his change in history?</br></br></br>  <br>meteor got destroyed<br><br>Earth is saved<br><br>The END</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually we know, that Yuuta's spirit power was exactly the same as Chiranosuke before VR-1 impact. He was almost or already god same as Chiranosuke but god can change nothing in this anime. <br><br>The biggest problem in interpetation is why Chiranosuke had memories from loops? But what if it was a lie? What if Yuuta in Chiranosuke reincarnation remember only 1 loop but he's lieing to increse ghost Yuuta and in the future, new Yuuta's morale? <br><br>I really don't think it's that deep because all Punchline budget went propably in last 2 episodes and it isn't good anime at all but it's funny to make interpretations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chiranosuke didn't tell Yuuta he wasn't allowed to change history until after he got his body back. If Chiranosuke isn't present for the coming Yuuta, he won't have to abide by those rules. He also knows pretty much all the important stuff that the previous Yuuta learned.</br>  <br>Damn, you're an expert at this. <br><br>The one thing I don't understand is, what was the point with Muhi? Should've used the bear to save Yuta with it's regeneration ability.</br></br></br>  <br>Chances are that Muhi will be more relevant for the game, but he also acts as a way to introduce Tsubouchi Qmay into the story.<br><br>Muhi is basically a W, and Tsubouchi thought that they needed him to create others, when Teraoka had done it already. Yuuta and Mikatan rejected the idea of becoming a W, as that would be basically accepting Qmay's ideals like Teraoka/Guriko. We also don't know how one actually becomes a W (hopefully it'll be elaborated upon in the game), or even what W is supposed to stand for, so I don't think that just having Muhi around would have been that helpful for Yuuta.<br><br>I'm assuming that Tsubouchi's plans were to possess Muhi himself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubouchi's plans were to possess Muhi himself. <br><br>The bear can Uber too? That's be weird.</br></br></br>  <br>Well it's obviously going to  ubear </br>  <br>Überfication seems to be tied with the spirit rather than the body. Yuuta could Überfy as a spirit, Tsubouchi could Überfy while possessing Tomoda, Yuuta could Überfy while possessing Rabura, etc.<br><br>It's kind of odd when they say that it's from the "Hercules virus", because that implies it's a body thing.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Fine, too.</br></br>  <br> KUMA SHOCK </br>  <br> what W is supposed to stand for <br>W = double U = double uber, perhaps?<br><br><br>Yes, that's a thing I don't quite understand.<br>As you noted, it has to be tied to the soul as Yuuta can uberfy while possessing Rabura's body.<br>But if it is tied to the soul, then Guriko, being a W, could have regained her original body without dying, and Pine's death becomes unnecessary.<br><br>Ok someone is gonna say<br> but Pine has to die in order to be reincarnated into Chiranosuke <br>But how could Pine know?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>W definitely seems to be a body thing, separate from Überfying. It allows continuous Überfication since it restores the body from the damage caused by it.<br><br>Hopefully the game will expand upon Überfying further. There are a lot of scenarios which should be expanded upon, but I feel that the anime did a good job as well, even if we don't have encyclopedic knowledge of everything it introduced. We got the concepts down.</br></br></br>  did Muhi win the yutabowl?  <br>If only the producers decided to wait until the games release, then adapt everything into 2 cours. Would have gotten more popular since we know what to expect, people thought it was a generic ecchi.</br>  <br>Will Muhi eat everyone when it's fully grown?</br>  <br>I don't think Punch Line would have gotten 2 cours even in that case. Anime is expensive and adaptions and tie-ins are usually just advertisements for the source material. (See: "buy the game :^)" ) Even Danganronpa got just rushed 13 episodes.<br><br>I'm personally happy that the anime came first. Having to wait and speculate every week was more fun than just being able to get spoiled about all the plot twists and such right away.</br></br></br>  <br> Danganronpa <br><br>Now that was trash. Storyboards literally copy pasted from the source.</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck?

However, it seems that having the soul's uber override the body damages it regardless of the body, case in point homeroom teacher.<br>It seems more likely that Muhi simply represents extreme regeneration that can withstand the force of the uber.<br>As such, the damage to Guriko's original body is permanent, while Pine's original body has extreme regeneration powers regardless of who is in it.<br>Still doesn't get the part about the virus though, how is that transmitted from the soul to the body?</br></br></br></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05348</wbr>  <br> Muhi simply represents extreme regeneration that can withstand the force of the uber. <br><br>Didn't think of that one.<br><br><br>No OST yet?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that I can find.

It'll betray you after a night out time and again.</br></br>    <br>Finally. At least this one isn't dissapointing like Kekkai sensen's ED.</br>  <br>It's Sissel</br>  How is it noble and heroic for Pine to sacrifice himself in order to spite Guriko? Maybe I'm not Japanese enough to get this, but in my book a peaceful future with Guriko dead and Pine alive enjoying it is strictly better than a peaceful future with Pine dead and Guriko miserably wandering the earth atoning.  <br>You don't sacrifice your friends even if they try to kill everyone in Earth.</br>  <br>6 days.<br>The first digit to the left corresponds to the number of days.</br></br>  <br> Teraoka wasn't inherently evil <br> Mikatan wanted Yuuta to save Guriko <br> Guriko was Yuuta's friend too </br></br></br>  <br>People who do bad things need to receive punishment. Death is the easy way out.</br>  <br><br><br> a noble death is better than living <br><br>Yeah I'm clearly not Japanese enough for this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A noble death is better than living in an inmortal body.</br>  <br> Need to receive punishment <br><br>Says who? God? What if you don't believe in that? That's based off of human "morality" and the concept of "an eye for an eye". The universe doesn't give a shit. You die whether you do something bad or not.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually there's no telling if Pine's body is ever going to expire. I don't know if Yuta ever wanted to live in it to begin with.</br>  <br>No one could grant Guriko to be atoning for her crime. She could be up to reviving another cult what's with her being immortal with lots of free time now.</br>  <br>If you believed in god, you could let her die and be at peace knowing that she'll be burning in hell for eternity. Since we can't assume that's going to happen, the only thing to do is the inflict human justice on her. Of course, there's no universal rule that this needs to happen, but the one who made the judgement is a human, so obviously it's based on human morality. If you're going to bring up the universe's apathy in this, you might as well start arguing that nothing Yuuta did to prevent the earth from being destroyed mattered because it's just one of billions of billions of planets in the universe and it's going to be vaporized eventually anyway, regardless of what anyone does.</br>  <br>The thing was that Teraoka was feeling bad about what he had done. That's exactly why he was offering to swap bodies and die instead of Mikatan. Yuuta decided that he should feel bad about trying to destroy the world for more than five seconds.</br>  <br> she'll be burning in hell for eternity <br>Christianity is not the only belief with spiritual concept, dude.</br></br>  <br>It's also not the only religion with some concept of hell. So... what's your point?</br>  <br>Not everyone believe that bad people go to hell.</br>  /a/ describe to me punchline in 5 words or less  <br>This is Zero Escape 3, you fuck.</br>  <br>ebin</br>  <br>pantyshots, evil organization, meteor, übermensch</br>  <br>get your spoonfeeding on reddit</br>  <br>Get off my case, will ya? 's mentioning of a singular "god" in modern times pretty much narrows it down to the perspective of the Abrahamic religions who do generally believe there is a life after death and the fate you have in the afterlife reflects the way you lived before your death. Pointing out that I didn't take into consideration some minor league belief systems that believe otherwise is just pedantic.</br>  <br>Inferior to dogs.</br>  <br>I came here to agree with this statement</br>  do we know if the game's gonna be translated yet?  <br>So if the cat is a good guy, why did it act like a D ?</br>  <br>A snack.</br>  <br>it's ghost yuta fucking around trying to get a future where he lives</br>  <br>It's not fucking Yuuta. <br>Yuuta becomes the bad guy at some point and directs Qmay. You hear him talking to Qmay in a ghostly voice.<br>How did no one fucking notice this?</br></br></br>  <br>no i thought that was the dead old Qmay leader</br>  <br>The dead old Qmay leader is who Yuuta is talking to in that scene. He told him to not kill Ito.</br>  <br>It's Tsubouchi Qmay arguing with Ito's teacher.</br>   (OP)<br>it's the punchline anon</br>  guriko a shit, shouldnt have been forgiven. I know pine needed to go back and fix everything but seriously. Guriko gets to be a W forever and live.  <br>She wasn't forgiven, that's why Pine forced her to live with her mistakes instead of taking the easy way out.</br>  <br><br>That's fucking Tomoda you moron, aka Ito's teacher who was obsessed with her and worked with Tsubouchi Qmay so he could get revenge on the girls who bullied her and try to win her over</br></br>  <br>Pine gave her what she wanted when she didn't want it anymore.</br>  <br><br>Im pretty sure she got over that and now is fully enjoying life</br></br>  <br>molesting mountain lolis?</br>  <br>Cats are dicks</br>  I really enjoyed it.  <br>So did I, but it would have benefited from removing Cheermancy and a longer season to spread the story more evenly. Still a solid 8/10.</br>  Is there any way to end the loop?  <br>He's really cute when he's not being a fucking lying asshole.</br>  <br>Spirit Yuta has to stop going back to December 21. I guess he wasn't so satisfied with the happy and peaceful future of the ending.</br>  <br> removing Cheermancy <br> removing the best part of the show <br>why would you do that?</br></br></br>  <br>If he doesn't come back, nothing hapens and Earth is destroyed.</br>  <br>In another timeline. Think of it as multiple parallel lines, if spirit Yuta doesn't go to December 21 in a timeline where the earth is safe then I don't think there's any problem.<br><br>anon please</br></br></br>  so wait, what happens to the original Yuuta "chironosuke" spirit?  Pine died a virgin  <br>not him, whats wrong with Cheermancy?</br>  <br>I thought it overstayed its welcome and probably played a significant role in why people dropped after episode 2. I'm less tolerant of engrish than most though.</br>  Enjoy your shitty bad ending animefags.  <br>Oh, no, I hate engrish too.<br><br>I hated how the US army troops spoke like retards.<br><br>But cheermancy was cute, and It's silly non-sense engrish in purpose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he got in lots of women.</br>  Cheermancy was fucking great<br>We needed more of it</br>  Punchiline!  The first loop couldn't occur. Since Yuuta never went back into the past to possess Rabura that would've broken the cycle.  How did he get dissembodied in the first loop?  <br><br>He knocked himself out from the future. That's how a time loop works.</br></br>  <br>I think a ghost trick anime would've been far better than all this ecchi shit.</br>  Come on, Uchikoshi, you're better than this. Punchline was such a disappointment after 999, Virtue's Last Reward, and the Infinity games.  <br><br>Why are you calling it a disappointment when the game isn't even out yet?<br><br>This anime was just a big preview.</br></br></br></br>  I only got to about ep 6 before i decided i just didnt care anymore.<br><br>Is there some big twist that makes it worthwhile to keep going or is it more convoluted body switching and panty shots?</br></br>  <br>A creature.</br>  <br>There's some more twists, but none of them make it worth it imo. Go play/read Ever17. Now THOSE twists were well worth some tedious bullshit until the true ending route.<br><br>Is there any indication the game will be any better?</br></br></br>  Anime with the most autistic fanbase? <br> pic related </br>  <br>Oreimo<br>Naruto</br></br>  everything kyoani has made since haruhi  <br>Bump</br>  <br>On here or in general?

The animation is great, the direction is basically flawless, and the story is pretty compelling despite being mundane.

It is a nice, entertaining series to feel happy. You don't really have to finish it. I did because I had dinner while watching it. <br><br> Oregairu <br>It really, really picks back the fuck up. I agree that the quality drops midway through, but towards the end it gets good. If I'm honest, I only put Hibike as the best anime because of how consistently good it was, though I think Yahari's final episodes have been better. <br><br>I'll just say that I think Yahari started out as good as S1 in the first arc, the second arc the show gets boring, and the third arc is better than anything S1 offered. Dere Yukino is something else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ore Monogatari <br>Well, if you liked what you've seen sso far the show doesn't chage its tone one bit. Also, it's a 2-cour.<br> Punch Line <br>The whole first half is a setup for the second, which is far more engaging (but that's not saying much).<br> Oregairu <br>Drama ensues.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only watched 17 anime this season so ill skip this one.</br>  <br>It has a shitload of characters that I just don't give a damn about. It's supposed to be about music but it doesn't really touch upon it and is just mostly about melodrama and Yuribaiting. Like Reina is basically one dimensional as a character only lusting over Sensei's dick and pretending to be Kumiko's lover.<br><br>Some people act like this show is special but the truth is it really isn't. It's like every boring Highschool setting filled with useless drama by KyoAni.</br></br></br>   Best anime <br>Punch Line, probably.<br> Worst anime <br>Denpa Kyoushi, only show I dropped<br> Best OP <br> Ninja Slayer, I'm a sucker for BBS <br> Best ED <br>Soma - extra points for the amazing way they used it in ep09<br> Best soundtrack <br>Hibike, mostly because of the attention to sound they've given it<br> Surprisingly good <br>Hibike - I expected it to be pretty dull and not go anywhere, but it's actually a pretty good show of a lot of neat characters.<br> Biggest disappointment <br>Yahari - I still enjoyed it, but it gets a little too wordy and takes itself too seriously quite often.<br> Best girl <br>Isla<br> Best boy <br> Soma </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  [s]ITT: everybody posts nobody reads[/s]  <br> ITT: Anon doesn't know about ctrl+s </br>  <br>Actually I'm reading this.</br>   Best <br>Shokugeki no Souma<br><br> Worst <br>Denpa Kyoushi<br><br> Best OP <br>Shokugeki no Souma<br><br> Best ED <br>Shokugeki no Souma or Plastic Memories<br><br> Best OST <br>Plastic Memories<br><br> Surprisingly good <br>Ore Monogatari<br><br> Biggest disappointment <br>Hibike<br><br> Best girl <br>that girl with hair on her eyes and huge ass shield from danmachi<br><br> Best Boy <br>Gouda Takeo or Yukihira Souma</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Best anime <br>They were all bad, very difficult, i will say for me it was Ore Monogatari!!<br> &gt;Worst anime <br>Punchline<br> &gt;Best OP <br>Yamada<br> &gt;Best ED <br>Without a doubt, Shokugeki no Souma.<br> &gt;Best soundtrack <br>None was memorable for me, maybe Yuki Nagato for the nostalgia<br> &gt;Biggest disappointment <br>Owari no Seraph<br> &gt;Best girl <br>Yamato<br> &gt;Best boy <br>Takeo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Best anime <br>Euphonium<br> Worst anime <br>Triage X<br> Best OP <br>Ninja Slayer<br> Best ED <br>Yuki-chan<br> Best soundtrack <br>Euphonium<br> Surprisingly good <br>Yuki-chan<br> Biggest disappointment <br>UBW<br> Best girl <br>Reina<br> Best boy <br>Leo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Soma - extra points for the amazing way they used it in ep09 <br>One of the few EDs I listen to every time. *humming, humming, humming, here it comes* SORE GA SUPAISU</br></br>   Best anime <br>Tie between Oregairu and Hibike<br> Worst anime <br>Nisekoi:<br> Best OP <br>Hibike<br> Best ED <br>Plastic Memories<br> Best soundtrack <br>Hibike<br> Surprisingly good <br>Plastic Memories<br> Biggest disappointment <br>Yuki-chan<br> Best girl <br>Yui Yuigahama<br> Best boy <br>Takeo Gouda</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best anime <br>All the omni pandering ones <br> Worst anime <br>Nagato Yuki-chan.

We HF now, fuckers.</br></br>  <br>They just showed the same trailer as before and said it's on the way. TM is probably focusing on GO since it seems to be coming out at the end of July. Read the HF manga to hold you over for now since it's pretty good.</br>  Sure.    is Shirou cool and handsome like in UBW in HF<br> :^) </br>    <br>Do people actually give a fuck about Saber anymore? I mean back in the day she was pretty much the only thing available but nowadays you've got saints&amp;emperors&amp;treasonous knights&amp;whatnot and the welsh broad can't really hold a candle to them.</br>  Who hyped for the best fight in the visual novel here?  <br> Do people actually give a fuck about Saber anymore? <br>They're just in hiding. If you look at most TM forums or polls, she's still the most popular heroine. After episode 22 and even know, there were a bunch of people asking for UFO table to do the fate route.</br></br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br>Fuck do I love this part, no strategies, no magic and no weapons. Just duking it out in a final hurrah.</br>  <br><br>considering the amount of merchandise she still gets yes. good luck trying to find a decent Caster or Lancer figure. if pic related was done in a decent scale it would be an instabuy for me</br></br>    <br>What the fuck is Curry doing there?</br>  <br>HF is on it's way</br>  <br>Shirou is manly enough to steal bitches from another series.</br>  <br>Curry gives the Red Man his shroud, making him the Red Man.</br>  <br>Okay secondaryfag here, more or less i understand about this fight but failed to get the hype, what's so good anyway about beating an old man on it's last breath? he'll die anyway with or without this fight.</br>  <br>They are both dying. Shirou has swords literally impaling throughout his body, and even acted as armor against Kotomine.<br>Its two men beating the shit out of each other just so one of them can live a few seconds longer than the other.</br></br>  <br>It's two people with their lives on a timer, on their last leg, engaged in a battle of sheer will power to to make their goals succeed. What's not to get hype about?</br>  <br>Hopefully, if we get a decent adaptation, you'll know why</br>  <br>It's a fist fight between two dying men one good and one evil. it's so simple but it's so good.</br>  <br>I hope they animate this fight insanely realistic. doing crazy flips and shit is cool as a fuck but that's not what shirou vs kirei is about.</br>  SAKURA'S SAKURAS  <br>You'll get superman flips and you'll like it because that's what HF is about.</br>  <br>That's what I'm worried about as well. In fact, I want it slowed down a bit to emphasize that they are both dying and not Kotomine pulling off crazy martial arts moves.</br>  <br>If its directed by Miura I would expect it to be like the Episode 20 part of Shirou vs Archer when it comes to the fight and monologue.</br>  <br>I know it's too far into production but I hope it isn't Ufotable doing the movie. Or that the movie would be so bad it would need a reboot by another studio. HF doesn't deserve the same shitty treatment that UBW got.</br>  WORMSLUT  <br>If they animate it like KnK, it should be fine. It needs emphasis on the atmosphere rather than the shounenish action in UBW.</br>    <br>Any good place to read it ? I</br>  <br>Why is she so perfect?<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Who is this  cutie puppy ?</br>  <br>Ufotable animated the rape scene in the KnK movie format. Heaven's feel will be fine in movie format.</br>  <br>Miura took out the rape in KnK 6.</br>  <br>Shiki was supposed to be raped by her blond male evil twin ?</br>  <br>The girl who got drugs injected into her was supposed to be raped and pregnant instead.</br>  <br>Ok. Weird</br>  <br>Not after ufotable fucked up Kirei v Kiritsugu, I'm not.</br>  <br> best girl <br>Go back to being fucked by worms.</br></br>  <br>I would pay to see this.</br>  <br>Yes we better get DEEN to do the movie right?</br>  <br>You have no idea what you are talking about.</br>  <br><br>I thought the fight itself was fine. The only thing I didn't like was that they used The battle is to the strong instead of asking for new music.</br></br>  <br>You're that kind of guy that just likes to wail for every fucking thing aren't you?<br><br> Kill yourself </br></br></br>  <br>Because it's beautiful in the simplicity of its brutality.</br>  <br> this is literally a show for the same children as power rangers </br>  <br>They'll grow up like MEN.</br>  <br> one of the best fight on Fate franchise <br> fucked up <br><br>Go back to your MUH superior still image and MUH drama CD. <br><br><br> The only thing i didn't like was that they used the best insert song for the best fight scene <br><br>Literally wat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like the song, but it didn't really fit the scene. And again, that fight is a pretty big deal so it should've used new music.</br></br>  <br> movie <br> most /a/ will watch it after 2,3 years  <br>sadly, Sakura will be always in shadow of new TV anime heroine</br></br></br>  <br>The monologue Shirou has regarding their similarities, and the speech Kotomine gives, make the manly fist fight.</br>  <br>Of course!</br>    <br> no Shinji <br><br>How? Why? What.</br></br></br>  <br>Excellent comeback.</br>  <br>Who would Shirou brought up by Kotomine grow up to be?</br>  <br>Read F/A</br>  <br>why ufoWormslut is such a babe?</br>  W O R M S L U T<br>O<br>R<br>M<br>S<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miura is the problem here. If he's not at the helm of HF, it should be all right.<br><br>Not only with changes of rape and stuff like that, the whole feel and pacing issues that UBW had, and that KnK6 also had.</br></br></br>  <br>They'll adapt RN anyway</br>  <br> If he's not at the helm of HF, it should be all right. <br>Isn't he doing the storyboards?</br></br>  <br>A  cute Mooki belonging to a certain pigtailed girl. </br>  Think we'll see rape?  <br> Best Girl <br> No Saber <br> No Illya <br> No Caster <br>I think we may have a problem here...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no medusa <br><br>A real big problem</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is at her best outside of her own route.</br>  <br>Yeah. Because she's barely around.</br>    <br> along with her shitty heroine <br><br>Don't talk shit about archer, you fcking wormfucker.</br></br></br>  <br> Wormfucker <br>*mongrel</br></br>  I will cry out if HF is directed by Takayuki Hirao. That would be the best adaptation of our times.  <br> fcking <br>Underage detected.</br></br>  <br>UBW was just the test run.<br>Sakura is Ufotable's waifu, and that's why she had the best character design.</br></br>  <br>Not that it'll see much use until at least 2016.</br>  <br> implying it's not Saber <br> implying Heaven's Feel isn't a test run for a Fate adaption </br></br>    <br> implying Fate adaptation won't be a test run for a new Illya route </br>  <br> Saber and Ilya <br>I have the weirdest boner</br></br>  <br> Best Girl <br> Posts Wormslut </br></br>  <br>Saber + Illya &gt; Any other waifus</br>  <br> 6 KB <br> 250x140 </br></br>  <br>But as far as we know, he's not directing. There's still a difference because the main issue is how content, character interaction and overall feel will be handled, and that's more the director's territory.<br><br>He did storyboards for /Zero too, not only UBW, so not doing it for HF would end up doing away with some of the visual identity of Ufotable's Fate adaptations.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, it'll be glorious.<br>A shame we'll have to put up with sakura too, though.</br></br>  <br> Offend mine eyes <br>Good.</br></br>  Did anyone else prefer the VN over the adaptation? The adaptation was almost perfect and expanded upon things like the epilogue and Caster's previous master but it lacked suspense and wasn't exciting to watch whereas the VN had me on the edge of my seat  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8qA<wbr>E_Th1b_4</wbr>  [ ]<br> 20 hour route <br> 90 minute movie <br>What could go wrong?</br></br></br>  <br> delusional Saberfags </br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it'll be multiple movies. They'll still have to make a lot to make it worth while though.<br><br>Also, no guarantee the movie will only be 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't agree more</br>  <br>I love Saber, but Medusa still makes me rock hard.<br><br>I'll be seeing myself out...</br></br></br>  <br>Can you tell me what tomorrow's stock prices will be, or do your oracle powers only work for anime?</br>  <br>That's what I'm wondering myself.<br><br>Even if they cut of all the boring cooking scenes etc. there's no fucking way it will be a good adaptation of the route as a whole.<br><br>Hell, the final fight and the aftermath of it should take at least 20 minutes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber would whore herself out for a sandwich and Illya exists to pander to pedophiles.</br>  Reminder that Rin was legitimately trying to kill Shirou  <br> whore herself out for a sandwich <br>I'm cool with that.<br><br> pedophiles <br>*lolicon. There's a difference.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that no.</br>  <br>I don't think that's true.</br>  <br>Reminder that Rin created a fucking reproduction of the legendary second magic in order to try to kill her sister.<br><br>Yet she chose to save Shinji in UBW without blinking.</br></br></br>  <br>Only for anime<br>I haven't been wrong yet</br></br>  <br> can't hit someone running down a narrow hallway <br>Rin is a terrible magus.</br></br>  <br>They could make a full movie out of just the last day and epilogue and still not have enough time to cover everything.</br>  <br> Saber would whore herself out for a sandwich <br>What if the sandwich is really good, though? It can't be wrong if it's a really good sandwich, can it?</br></br>  <br>Has Manaka fallen in love with this Saber yet?</br>  <br>Nah. She's still all about the D.</br>  <br>Then maybe Merlin can help.</br>  <br>Proto Saber's Britain, is exactly the same as Artoria's right?<br><br>Gawain, Lancelot, etc being all the same?</br></br></br>  <br>Minus knowing that seiba's a girl, assumingly</br>  <br>Nothing that really compares to her obsession with Arthur.</br>  <br>Higher res</br>  <br><br>Oh she was just playing around then?<br>Just joking when she was firing those deadly magical projectiles at him?</br></br></br>  <br>Read the bad end that happens if Shirou loses that fight.</br>  <br> Senpai... <br> S-senpai... <br> Um...Senpai... </br></br></br>  <br>Shinji is an actual character who can be redeemed and is the deepest character in the franchise. He's simply misguided, even Gilgamesh recognizes his greatness and chose to serve him. When found out Kirei died he barely cared, but having to kill Shinji was clearly something which he was barely capable of handling.</br>  <br> Shinji <br> Redeemed <br>Friendly reminder that he raped his sister</br></br></br>  <br>im just glad best guy appeared</br>  <br>Will probably continue doing so while Shirou is busy with being an ISIS jihadist.</br>  I just notice Sakura is wearing Taiga's clothes in the final episode. She really doesn't have anything other than uniforms does she?  <br>People kill eachother all the time in the war and his sister lusts for sex. If anything she's the one at fault for constantly alluring him, if she didn't want it them she would just reject, stupid bitch.</br>  <br> Shirou is in ISIS <br> Shinji is a rapist <br>Damn Fate has some good protagonists.</br></br></br>  <br>Rapist and a terrorist, good job nasu</br>  <br> meet a murderous bitch who's taking a break from summoning the motherfucking Beast of Revelation to practice her Scott Bakula impression <br> join her LARPing group in exchange for food <br>Goddamn it Seiba.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks Gawain, if you only hadn't traumatized her with your potatoes she might have develop a moral system more complex than offers tasty food=worth of following.</br>  <br>Lance confirmed better knight</br>  <br> &gt;join her LARPing group <br>I love this about Manaka. She spends most of the time just building her harem of Servants and shitting on anyone who won't play ball.</br></br>  <br>wait they are really making the final alternate time line arc from the old visual novel where sakura goes apes shit on every one ?!?! why now ? it should have been after the one where archer survives years ago</br>  <br>Probably.<br><br>Or maybe it's similar to the original myth, considering Proto Saber IS King Arthur.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying it wasn't a good thing <br>Just ask Shirou.

Also, the existence of a Y chromosome would have given Mordred the potential to be a male, making it more similar to the original legend.</br>  <br>Lance confirmed better knight</br>  <br>Mordred confirmed better knight</br>  <br>Female Gawain &gt; Mordred</br>  <br>Try saying, "King Arthur is a woman with a penis and testicles."</br>  <br>Doesn't have the same ring</br>  <br><br>Anon(s) confirmed shit taste<br><br>Anon confirmed great taste</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Try "I ejaculated inside of King Arthur's vagina" or be Rin &amp; say "I had lesbian sex with King Arthur".</br></br>   thumbnail looks like Rin is about to give Shirou head <br><br>Oh baby.</br></br>  <br>Nope. Still Mordred.</br>  What was the part with the desert at the end supposed to symbolise exactly?  <br>Shirou surpassing Archer in removing ISIS.</br>  <br>I want to protect this smile.</br>  <br>Incorrect. Shirou IS ISIS. Need I repost the picture?</br>  <br>Slanderous propaganda. Shirou is a seigi no mikata. Are you saying a seigi no mikata would join ISIS?</br>  <br>[[Wasteland Scene<br>After the credits. The same wasteland as at the beginning.<br>Shirou is walking alone. Exhausted, he comes to a stop.<br>When he looks down, there are signs that somebody was here before him. (This is where Archer stopped.)<br>He sighs, and looks up. Though his expression is a little weary, it is also full of hope.<br>With a purposeful stride, he begins walking forward again.<br>The camera stays at Archer's footprints, watching Shirou's back as it recedes into the distance. End Scene.<br>(If you need to make it easier to understand, have Archer appear at his footprints after Shirou leaves, watching over him... though hopefully you won't have to do that.)]] <br><br>By Mcjon from Nasu's blog</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Everyone knows that ISIS members are seigi no mikata.</br>  <br>Dunno. He made best friends with Shinji in HA.</br>  <br>Movie when ? Still no fucking info since july last year</br>  <br>For some reason I feel like Fragments is kind of like an otome story with the MC as the villain. It probably has something to do with the fact that most of the cast members shown are magical bishounen.</br>  <br>Those things shes shotting kinda suck. Why not use a gun instead?</br>  <br>Next year, at the soonest. Ufotable got busy with God Eater and Tales, so they're probably not rushing to get HF done. They might be slowing down the pace at which they churn out Fate anime, so they can work on other stuff.</br>  <br>That Shirou doesn't stop where Archer stopped and keeps moving on living the life of a seigi no mikata instead of focusing about its ends.<br><br>Notice how the anime cuts to shirou foot stepping on a similar cinematographic spot that Archer disappears. Then you see Shirou's smile.</br></br></br>  <br>Any gun Rin touched would turn into a Glock.</br>  <br>A break from Fate is what they need for the Heaven's Feel movies to turn out good.</br>  there was a CM at the end of UBW's last episode., but nothing new. At least, we know they didn't forget about it.<br><br>but why last episode ??? (Last route?)<br><br>here is the CM: https://d.maxfile.ro/voinqduhks.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the context it is probably just a reference to HF's stutus as the last route in FSN.</br>  https://imgrush.com/E_hTp6VmhV0Y.mp<wbr>4</wbr>  <br> That Whirlpool of Fate <br><br> still no release date </br></br></br>  If there's one thing I'm hyped about it's this.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/6wLHKS6EOko?t=30m3<wbr>9s</wbr>  [ ]</br>   inb4 they don't use church on the hill YET AGAIN <br> inb4 they don't use this illusion piano </br>  <br>No, they are talking about the "Last Episode" (in the VN with the Avalon thing)<br><br>it is going to be included in Fate HF</br></br></br>  <br> Expecting Shirou vs Kotomine from thumbnail <br> goes right into Die Lorelei </br></br>  <br>LE's saberfag pandering doesn't really make sense as something that they would try to stuff into HF.</br>  <br> all those godawful days until the last 3 <br>Despite all the cool shit in HF, I can't even get hyped. Sakura and post-Sakura Shirou are just such unlikeable characters and I never want them to succeed.</br></br>  <br>I'm not quite sure how LE could work it's way into HF, they're probably with talking about HF being the last route or animating LE separately.</br>  <br> liking or disliking characters based on their morality <br>I bet you don't like Kirei either.</br></br>  I am the bone of my missile<br>Steel my body and jet fuel my blood<br>I have created over a thousand JETS<br>Have fired over a thousand missiles<br>yet jet fuel will never melt steel beams<br>So as I pray, UNLIMITED JET WORKS.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, don't watch it.</br>  <br>I like Kirei, but both of them are such unlikeable fucking idiots. There is no reason why I should even want Shirou to succeed, he throws away everything for the worst person in existance.</br>  <br> inb4 they don't use this illusion piano <br>Sounds about right. It's a narration heavy scene there with the piano for atmosphere. Most of it will probably be cut for time.</br></br>  <br> no new teaser <br> show the old one <br>It's like they want to torture me</br></br></br>  Whatever. Right now Ufotable have problems with God Eater production, because of f/sn high quality.<br> HF first movie 2017-2018 <br> BD release 2018-2019 <br>But anyway I gonna watch HF movies in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really based on morality, but based on personality. I just can't stand Sakura's personality, and Shirou's not fun with her. Different anon by the way</br>  <br>Ok explain me what the fuck that ending, Shirou ended like Archer again? or he cums inside tohsaka every single day and live in happiness?</br>  <br> They don't care about HF </br>  <br>The word you're looking for it slow paced.<br>I agree that HF was definitely a harder read than the other two, but in the end that was only positive, at least for me.<br><br>Kirei literally wants to throw everything thing IN EXISTANCE away because he wants help some monster be born out of pure curiosity.<br>If you don't understand Shirou in HF then I am sad to tell you that HF was literally too deep for you. His character was a subversion of the previous routes in which he always chose the greater good above his personal happiness.<br>In HF he decides for pursuing what he wants over what's good for everyone else. I think it's pretty relatable.<br><br> Most of it will probably be cut for time <br> Sounds about right <br><br>Are you fucking nuts? If they cut out Shirou's inner monologue then HF would be fucking terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I like listening to this scene just to hear Kirei's lines again </br>  <br>GO Assassin is in Fragments?</br>  <br> tfw i sometimes listen to his voice in my head <br><br> EMIYA SHIROU <br> YOROKOBE, SHOUNEN </br></br></br></br>  <br> You said an older brother protects his younger sister, right? <br> ...Yeah, I'm the older sister. So I have to protect my younger brother <br>EVERY TIMEEEE</br></br></br>  <br> Post <br><br>The man had his fucking body broken just for his soul to liner until put into a doll. The fuck are you on.</br></br></br>  <br>Different person, I like HF thematically but the fact that Shirou throws away his ideals for fucking Sakura makes it less enjoyable for me.</br>  <br>Same with me - I like the concept of the route, but I just don't like Sakura enough to fully appreciate Shirou's change.</br>  <br>He goes on to become a hero and may or may not end up dancing at the end of a rope like Archer did. I guess that his hair not turning white from the overuse projection is supposed to be taken as a sign that he is somewhat smarter about his hero of justice thing than the Archer was.</br>  <br>So do you not like it because of Sakura or becuase he abandons his ideals?</br>  <br>I understand what his purpose and everything is, but after seeing how gallantly he followed his ideals in UBW despite being directly confronted with what would seem like absolute failure, discarding them just for Sakura was awful. Letting all those people die and killing fucking Saber was painful to even read through.</br>  <br> Saber: Mega rehash <br>Good shit.</br></br>  <br> throws away his ideals <br>You mean the ideals that were revealed to be hollow, based on survivors guilt and making him a generally unhappy person? Yeah, terrible thing to lose.</br></br>  <br>I found it the other way around. I thought Shirou's ideals in UBW were so hamfisted and all about how he is right and everybody else is wrong that Shirou came off as a literal retard, while the throwing it away to defend his family felt much more natural.</br>  <br>Because UBW was TALK TALK TALK, his ideals weren't really challenged as he had to experience nothing that challenged them first-hand, just stuff Archer told him.</br>  <br> and making him a generally unhappy person <br>Fate and UBW Shirou seemed to keep them pretty well. In fact, Fate Shirou pretty much gets eternal happiness and his waifu</br></br>  <br> based on survivors guilt <br>Here we go.</br></br>  <br>The bad end for that scene is literally one of the few in the game that you could really argue isn't bad.</br>  <br>I thought it made HF Normal a very fitting end. The crime judging him and all that.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>I guess that's a good point. <br>I marathoned Fate and UBW but read HF weeks later, so it wasn't really in comparison for me. I didn't like UBW anyway and I hated Shirou's ideals (as I think you are supposed to).</br></br>  <br>Yes. He's Bahsahka in Fragments, though. His Master died from a melted brain and was resurrected as a zombie just to fuck with Assassin.</br>  <br>I mean, it makes sense how Shirou himself cares for Sakura and discards his ideals for her. But personally as the reader, I think it's not worth it for Sakura, while Shirou may think so.</br>  <br>They were plenty challenged, but it was a type of challenge Shirou was built to fight again. He'd always been fighting against himself after all.</br>  <br>France vs Britain Saber and Ruler scenes please, Nasu.</br>  <br> That EMIYA ost start <br><br>Got an erection every time the fight begins.</br></br></br>  <br>They were definitely challenged, Archer was constantly telling him how his life would turn out if he kept following it. He knew for a fact that he was going to have to commit actions that would be considered regrettable but he'd still be steadfast in living his life in that way without regret. <br><br>It wasn't even TALK TALK TALK, that was just the anime. The actual route was mostly getting to follow Shirou's thoughts and getting to understand how he worked them through within his mind without needing everything said out loud.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean up to the start of fs/n.<br>Of course your mental condition gets better if you get loving waifu thrown at you.<br><br>I wasn't in the cancerfest that were UBW threads, but is that actually a controversial statement? Isn't that the literal whole point of UBW?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's explicitly pointed out in the VN that his ideals were not based on survivor's guilt.</br>  <br>I just don't like Sakura much. The abusive past thing fell flat for me and didn't make her as sympathetic as I assume Nasu was aiming for. Then again, I like UBW Shirou and sympathize with the aspiration to be a hero even if it's unreachable, so maybe I can't appreciate HF.</br>  <br>GudaGuda Order is great. Self advertising at its best.</br>  <br>No, Shirou admired Kerry and tried to be like him.</br>  <br>Got a screen or anything of that?</br>  <br> His Master died from a melted brain and was resurrected as a zombie just to fuck with Assassin. <br>Good times. Seeing the cutest Hassan suffering just makes her even cuter.</br></br>    <br>I didn't read the VN in a long time, but I'm petty sure Shirou repeatedly said something about him being saved and the others not being and having to repay that debt.</br>  <br>I do want to see Bedivere in Grand Order. GudaGuda Order makes a joke of him having a better chance than Nobu and Sakura Saber, but I'm genuinely interested in what his abilities would be.</br>  <br> discarding them just for Sakura was awful <br>As opposed to what, trying to save everyone including Sakura, then failing to save anyone?<br><br><br>"The fire ten years ago.<br>Because I was the only one who survived, I lived on, swearing never to let such a disaster occur again."<br>[PIC]<br><br>"The atonement.<br>Am I going to betray my previous self, who had to cling to that atonement to continue living?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Fate. Not in UBW, where the ideal is actually confronted and he admits </br>  <br> HF_Good_End.jpg </br>  <br>He also, says it In HF. <br>UBW is just conveniently changed.</br></br>  <br>Oh, he's blushing! Such a cutie patooty!<br><br>I will proceed to search and not be spoonfed then.</br></br></br>  <br> Everything in HF is shit until the end <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8y<wbr>e-eSdYxM</wbr>  [ ]<br>Opinion invalidated</br></br></br>  <br> UBW is just conveniently changed. <br>What the hell are you trying to say exactly?</br></br>  <br><br>Anyone who thinks Shirou doesn't suffer survivors guilt is fucking retarded, but I guess I can't prove that without digging into the VN again.<br>I can just say that the monologue of a character isn't always absolute truth. I'll be stopping now.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay yes, Mapo Tofu was good but that doesn't fix the entire rest before the last days.</br>  <br>I never really liked the criticism that "Shirou's ideals are borrowed". Pretty much every person's moral beliefs and ideals are borrowed if you take borrowed to mean "learned from parents, or from anyone else".</br>  <br>It's entirely possible that he does suffer survivor's guilt, the point of that scene is that that's not the source of his hero complex.</br>  <br>He does, but that's not why he has the ideal.</br>  <br>UBW is the only route he realizes it in. Shirou even makes a point of trying to block it out of his mind when Archer is shoving it in his face.</br>  <br>I love how everyone shits on HF for being boring until the last 3 days because it literally has no shounen bullshit when it has the shadow, Zouken, Ilya, True Assassin, then the whole school scene and the big reveal about the worm thing, Mapo Tofu, Kotomine and Shirou teaming up to save Ilya, and Archer's arm just to name a few.</br>  <br>Or you should realise that UBW Shirou digs far deeper than HF and Fate Shirou in terms of ideals</br>  <br>HF was a rollercoaster to me. It was pretty exciting at the beginning, then it fucking stopped for a while, and then it got really good.</br>  <br>well they DID have music they could have used<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8kq<wbr>ls64aYUs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  All we're ever going to get for Fate is that piece of shit that DEEN made  <br>I don't remember much but I was certainly interested throughout most of the route. It had a lot more mystery to it than the other routes.</br>  <br>Unless you actually like Sakura or Shirou after he's changing more towards Sakura, it's hard to bear with anything but the last 3 days. The last 3 days had some moments that were good enough to ignore that or just didn't make those things relevant.</br>  <br>It was the monologue of Archer, that Shirou tried to deny but knew was true.</br>    <br>I didn't mind Sakura at all. She isn't my favorite Fate girl but her yandere moments were some of my favorites.<br>I didn't like Shirou until HF anyway.</br></br>  <br>That version of Emiya is great, but I prefer  Prisma's <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jiR<wbr>dixLq38o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Better than nothing</br></br>  <br>Most of those people say that hate everything involving Sakura or all of her scenes were boring, There is a whole lot of Sakura there.</br>  <br>Literally the only parts of Fate that would have actually been exciting were off-screen. Archer vs Berserker and Lancer vs Gilgamesh were the only fights that had potential and we never got to see them.</br>  <br>You don't like a character who's being crazy heroic instead of selfish?</br>    <br><br>I don't think that's how the human psyche works.<br>Is he suffers survivors guilt then that's at least one of the reasons that cause his actions and thoughts, including the adaption of Kerry's ideal.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>Did you forget when Ufo animated like a two minute long scene of a guy drooling over a girl? They can do creepy rapey shit if that's what gets you off.</br>  <br>Shirou in HF was more heroic than UBW Shirou.</br>  <br>Saber = Best Girl all day</br>  <br> UBW Shirou <br>Saved the city without murdering anyone<br> HF Shirou <br>Couldn't even get by without killing himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on what you consider heroic</br>  <br> thinks HF is next <br><br>You clearly didn't bother to watch epilogue which was setting up Fate H/A <br><br>they aren't doing HF, get over it.

After all Manaka was supposed to be her best friend and she grew up thinking that her father had cursed her to die a terrible horrifically if she didn't win the grail.</br></br>  <br>He's either bathing alone or bathing with Hassan. Either way, he's right to be grumpy.</br>  <br> he didn't play the VN <br>the bad end where Shirou gets hit by her blast has him wake up the next morning without his command seals and with no recollection of the Grail War.</br></br>  <br>Best girl strikes again, I see.<br><br>Seriously though, Sakurai seems to be doing a good job with what she had to work with.</br></br></br>  <br>What a slut!</br>  <br><br> no updateds </br></br>  Tsukihime remake news in Type-Moon Ace in a few days  Who is this semen demon?  <br>London Rin</br>  <br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So what the fuck happened to her hair? Looks atrocious, like a washed-out 80s rock star or something</br></br>  <br>She let it down?</br>  <br> Tsukihime remake news in Type-Moon Ace in a few days <br><br>I'm expecting a 2 page art spread with a small box of text saying "We're still working on it, honest!"</br></br></br>  <br>Or a picture of Arcueid giving everyone the middle finger</br>  <br> Tsukihime remake news <br><br>Haha. If only. I am not holding my breath for it.</br></br></br>  I'm still haunted by the tragedy that is the new Arc design but at least we have the manga for that.<br>Still looking forward to reading it in 2019.</br>  <br><br>Oh never mind, it says Tsukihime remake there. There MUST be something new, right? RIGHT?</br></br>  <br> Tsukihime <br> news </br></br>  He already addressed the Remake in the UBW boxset for last season. He hasn't forgotten anything even though its said here often.<br><br>Tsuki fans are basically the bitchiest TM fans. No matter how much they're reassured or how much they're given they're like "Haha, nice joke, fucking Nasu hates us, that cunt".<br><br>Said he would have the remake out in ten years, a year passes by and they've already decided Nasu hates them and it was always a joke. Three years pass by and they can only start a conversation about Tsuki by saying how much Fate sucks / is milked / always sucked and Nasu still hates them.<br><br>I think we're at about four to six years by now, so we have another four years to go.<br><br> In b4 magazine article says "Remake on the way in four years, then it gets delayed another year because he decided to put another route in at the last minute, like with CCC". <br><br> Arihiko, Seven, Fake Shiki, SHIKI, and Kouma routes are added </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Shiki the greatest TM protagonist?  <br> Liking her twin-tails. <br>are you a fag?</br></br>  <br>Shirou &gt; ??? &gt; Hakuno &gt; That guy from NOTES &gt; Shiki &gt;Soujuuro &gt; Guy from Kara &gt; Grand Order kids</br>  <br>She's literally perfect</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YR4<wbr>ff-PtT6Y</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I don't blame Nasu. He has a shit ton to do. With Tsukihime alone he has to <br>-Have Shiki better written<br>-Add more depth to the routes without destroying the integrity of them and people bitching he ruined it<br>-Do the Sacchin route which is going to be a bitch as it has to be done right/perfectly.<br><br>This is disregarding all the other things he is doing/watching production over. F/GO is probably killing him and Takeuchi as they have to deal a lot of artist and servants. The only thing he has left now is his video games.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> -Have Shiki better written <br>Impossible. He is already perfect.</br></br>  <br>Shiki is good but he still has shallow personality/identity.</br>  <br> Add more depth to the routes without destroying the integrity of them and people bitching he ruined it <br>It's a shame that no matter what he does people will bitch about it. I'm expecting him to change the vast majority of the vn and even if he makes considerable improvements people will give him shit.<br>I imagine Roa/SHIKI will be given some powerups and the game as a whole will have a larger-scale feel to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Ten years is already fucking long for a VN. How can you can keep the same fanbase interested for that long?</br>  <br>In terms of expressive personality he has more than Shirou, at least in things after Tsukihime.</br>  I hope we at least get some more character designs. I can't wait to see Nero, and if Mahoyo is anything to go by his chaos will look very impressive.  Load El Melloi II Case Files news?  <br>That has always felt weird to me. The events have a chance to leading to the end of humanity, but it never feels like it. HGW feels so much larger-scale, but it never really has a chance at ending humanity, just shrinking it greatly.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Nasu asked Ufotable to put in some of the changes we saw in UBW to gauge the audience's feelings about the differences.</br>  <br>I really hope they don't go with the new Arc design but everything else looks great, personally.</br>  <br>Shiki really grinded my gears when I read Tsukihime for the first time. This motherfucker is allowed to live in a giant mansion again and isn't grateful or considerate of the others living in it at all.</br>  <br>Well at least that didn't kill your interest in the VN.</br>  <br> Hakuno <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> This motherfucker is allowed to live in a giant mansion again and isn't grateful or considerate of the others living in it at all. <br>Shiki is a bit of an asshole but he's nice when it counts.</br></br>  <br>But anon he's 'subtly mysterious' and 'slightly off'!<br>Basically allowing Nasu to claim Shiki has a personality without putting in too much effort or ruining the self-insert potential. <br>I'm really looking forward to seeing how Shiki comes out in the remake.</br></br></br>  Nasu just needs to make Shiki less easy to self-insert into. Shirou is nearly impossible as he is too fucked/broken as a person yet with Shiki it is relatively easy.  <br> The events have a chance to leading to the end of humanity <br><br>Are you referring to Arc going crazy?</br></br></br>  <br> with Shiki it is relatively easy. <br>Yeah I love self-inserting into insane rapists.</br></br>  <br>At that point I just wanted to see where the plot would take me after he minced Arcueid. I wasn't disappointed by the plot, but I did read it after F/SN which spoiled me with its voice acting and special effects.</br>  <br>Arcade 2moe4me</br>  <br>Yes. That and if Roa establishes himself and Arc is killed by him he could easily get to the point of being stronger than all the other DAA's.</br>    <br>You first</br>  <br> How can you can keep the same fanbase interested for that long? <br><br>Because they're whores who don't know how to leave, and TM is popular as fuck.<br><br>Even if the old fans pretend to leave, the game will be rolling in fans when it comes out and suddenly the complaints will be gone as they all come back like the whores they are.<br><br>It's like when Utawarerumono 2 is coming out and all of a sudden people are excited, rather than spending the entire time saying "Why isn't it here yet, its bad". Shit came out years after it was supposed to apparently. Its because its not a super popular as fuck franchise, so people just forgot about it for awhile until it happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked that about Tsukihime though. It didn't feel like the standard "MC is going to save the world!" because how special he is. Just a supernatural problem in his own town (or mansion) that he has to unfortunately deal with. Everything feels more personal.</br>  <br>That wouldn't be too bad.</br>  <br>And I guess if Nrvnqsr had successfully assimilated Arc too.</br>  <br> Shiki is a bit of an asshole <br>Gee, don't you think that's taking it just maybe a smidgen too far?</br></br>  <br> Hating on Hakuno <br><br>I don't even know how that's possible.</br></br></br>  <br> personal <br>This, so much. I hope Nasu doesn't try to expand the conflict too much.</br></br>  <br> yfw there's a fucking release date </br>  <br>That is somewhat true. I feel like the Arc route should've felt a little grander. Especially the climax. I liked that feeling for the maid routes. Roa was just an unimpressive endgame. Nrvnqsr was more impressive.<br><br>I wonder who'd win in a fight between Roa and Nrvnqsr</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about Hakuno, not Hakunon</br>  Shiki &gt; Shiki  <br>Accompanied by Melty remake news, right?</br>  <br>Shiki&gt;SHIKI&gt;Shiki&gt;SHIKI</br>  <br>Shiki &lt; Shiki</br>  <br>Lot of people like to hate on Haku thinking she/he's nothing but a literal self insert.<br><br>Extra and especially CCC show he/she does have a personality, it's just not wacky or really out there enough to stand out among the other ones. Which is kind of the point, since Hakuno is just the normal one. A normal enough kid who got involved with a grail war and had to evolve to survive.<br><br>Has pretty normal values; when asked what she wants in a waifu she said that household abilities and cooking rank near the top, or life skills. A gopher who gets used by people around, passionate and foolish, insensitive, mildly perverted as she likes to spy on the Nurse's room in both games, has an ability to pick up yanderes without trying, Hates microwaved food, hard beds, hates debt collectors, weapon bragging, likes candy and Anmitsu, and is that stupidly determined type MC who admits he's weak but makes up for it by never giving up. Standard enough in a way.<br><br><br>Same shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get out.</br>  <br> Same shit <br><br>Are you autistic?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Averagely adorable.</br></br>  <br>Autists never say "Same shit" about anything.<br><br>They're always "No no, its all in the details, the details, its very different you see".</br></br></br>  <br>If there's one thing he needs to fix it's one or both endings to Akiha's route.</br>  <br>Nanaya Shiki &gt; 「　」&gt; Ryougi Shiki &gt; Satsujinki Tohno Shiki &gt; Ryougi SHIKI &gt; Tohno SHIKI</br>  <br>Kagetsu confirms that Shiki is still alive in one ending, yet people often lambast it saying "It kills the poetry".<br><br>Despite how even in the game it sort of showed he was still alive in that ending as she felt him in the end, but they still go "But I thought it was just poetic, like she felt him from Heaven"<br><br>Nah, he survived, and he's coming back home thanks to Ciel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked both of them.<br>The true ending was quite touching. It's a shame that Nasu decided to kill the ambiguity by confirming Shiki's survival in KT.</br></br>  <br> 「　」 <br>Literally no personality.<br>How can you like infodump characters? That's akin to liking Rin.</br></br></br>  <br>Or they will mention the real release date!  that is on the same month as Kizu <br><br><br>I actually don't really mind it, now after I'm getting used to it. Arc does strikes as a type that can wear short skirts while still looks elegant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her godlike, literal-perfection aura is alluring.</br>  How does it feels like to shake Shiki's shikis?  People excited for that Grand/Order news?  <br> it sort of showed he was still alive in that ending as she felt him in the end <br>This confirmed nothing. You can view it as Akiha desperately kidding herself after suffering a close death she can't accept. Of course you can also view it as proof of his survival due to her feeling the weight of his lifeforce.<br>By confirming that it's the latter, Nasu removed the possible personal emotional element for no damn reason.</br></br></br>  <br>It really sucks that FGO exists. A filthy EOP like myself will never be able to play it, and TM have had to put resources into making it. A fucking mobile game.</br>  <br>It really cannt be played outside Japan?<br>It won't be a game like the LoveLive one?</br></br>  <br>Nasu is too soft. He'll put his characters through hell but he'll always want at least one happy ending.</br>  <br>Lion Saber</br>  <br>It might be fair enough. The normal end was fucking brutal.</br>  <br>I felt like Sakura would've had two shitty endings if he didn't have a change of heart after Tsukihime.</br>  Will the remake be all-ages like Nasu wants?  <br><br> waifu in another game I can't read <br>Should just learn moon already. TM works alone would probably make it worth while.</br></br></br>  <br>The sex scenes didn't really feel forced in Tsukihime the way they did in Fate (specifically Saber's route).</br>  <br>If it wasn't an MMO I'd probably like it at least a little. But an MMO means no routes.</br>  <br>It's blowing in the wind, as hair is sometimes prone to do when people go outside</br>  <br>They still fucked up the bangs. They look really weird.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yLK<wbr>3B7SySFs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Anyone hoping Fukusawa will do the soundtrack?<br> Aoko route please, Nasu. </br></br></br>  <br> Aoko route <br>This isn't Mahou Tsukai no Yoru.

Twintails looks god-awful on a teenage girl.</br>  <br>Well there is Archetype's route in Melty. That was the highest scale event in all Nasuverse.</br>  <br>Sakura no Uta is the only instance I know of where the interest has relatively maintained itself for that long.</br>  <br>You can die with him if you love him that much faggot.</br>  I'm worrying about Type-Moon...<br>I know that many newfags didn't even read VNs / Light Novel F/Z and just watched shitty animu by Deen, Ufotable and JC Staff.<br>And now even more retards will play in shitty April Fools' game, Fate/Extra and even worse CCC, watch Fate/Zero and Carnival Phantasm without even reading VNs/LNs and pretend to be TM-fags after that, make tons of shitty threads about characters and power levels.<br>They will not be even familiar with the original art-style and will think that this shitty K-on CP is "okay", Morii-san's art is not pure shit, RCO Wada is nice and F/Z is soo kewl stylish and grim dark, also Fate/Extra is acceptable by any means with all this "wH0 iZ mai WAiFUUUU" &amp; UmUshit whore of babbylon crap.<br>Type-Moon is not supposed to be this popular, get the fuck out you narutards.<br><br>And now you can CLEARLY see all these "typemoonfags" of 2010-2013. Fucking horrible. You're not TYPE-MOON fans, but NEO-NARUTO-MOON fans.<br><br>I ordered Mahoyo and finished that shit VN in this year (2011 late release) while you are still sucking dicks for at least 5 years or so without the translation, fucking plebeians and casuals. But even Mahoyo was a PIECE of SHIT and BOMBED really hard.<br>And what is more hilarious - Type-SHIT is pretending like it never happened and preferred to completely FORGOT about their new VN by making another absolutely IDIOTIC fate/shit such as EXTRA/SHIT and APOCRYSHIT.<br><br>And now Type-Moon decided to resurrect this shit Fate/Apocrypha like it wasn't enough to make Fate/Milking Sabers shit, their outbursting impotence and rectal dysfunction is taking them way far away from something actually new and original, you may suggest that Mahoyo is new but you'll be terribly wrong because the sequence of Mahoyo was made in 1996(!) year and the only "new" thing will be Girl's work but I'm not sure even about this, there's no guarantee that they didn't pull this shit out of someone's old ass again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is pasta, right?</br>  <br> -Have Shiki better written <br>For what reason? He was already written well. What do you want more from Shiki? He's a mature and adult young man who needs no character development because he knows he's going to die fairly sooner than everyone else. All he needs in his life is to enjoy it.</br></br>  <br> This motherfucker is allowed to live in a giant mansion again and isn't grateful or considerate of the others living in it at all. <br>The mansion is deprived of electronics and the wonders of a giant mansion except for Kohaku's room.

There are Stands in Part 7 that don't originate from Corpse parts if I remember right. I don't think In A Silent Way or Tomb of the Boom came from Sandman or the Boomboom Family having a Corpse piece, so maybe enough exposure to either pieces or Devil Palms enable the use of Stands without them.</br>  <br> Killer Queen <br> The Spin in general <br> Bohemian Rhapsody can probably do something similar <br> Diver Down <br> No idea <br> Yellow Temperance? <br> No idea <br> Atum? <br> Atum as well? <br> Rockmen? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why no other part did this?<br><br>Feels less complete.</br></br></br>  <br> and "I win" <br> loses against diego </br></br>  So I've been reading the manga because I finally thought that I should see what all the fuss is about.<br><br>I've started part 5. <br><br>My question is, does the plot ever get better than "let's fight a bunch of one-time stands, learn every infinitesimal detail about how they work, and then never see them again (because we killed or otherwise incapacitated the user so they're no longer relevant)"? I liked parts 1 and 2 a lot, but starting at part 3 and the introduction of Stands I started to feel this way. <br><br> Also, I'd just like to say that while I enjoyed him, I feel like Dio's popularity is way overblown compared to his actual screentime, especially Part 3 Dio. The last part/final fight of Part 3 was very anticlimactic.  <br><br>I think I might watch the anime, maybe seeing things animated and in color would make me more hype about things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Missing ones were Spice Girl and the Pillarmen.<br>Oh and mind read could be Hermit Purple as well</br></br>  So if Dio decides to masturbate, does he end up jerking off or does he end up giving Johnathan a handjob?  <br>If you can't get used to the one-off stands, you probably won't enjoy the rest of the series.</br>  <br>its just jonathan jerking off with dio watching</br>  Post your favorite pose  <br>It's not so much the fact that they're one-off stands, really, so much as the fact that the comic spends so much time going into detail about the exact way their powers work. Literally pages and multile chapters dedicated to it. Hell, half the time the user is the one monologuing that shit directly to whoever they're fighting.<br><br>It's really like that the rest of the comic? Maybe I should quit, I dunno. The Italian gangster stuff in Part 5 has been sort of interesting so far, I'll probably at least finish off Part 5 I guess.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes, it's more or less the same flair.<br>Stand fights are more or less puzzle fights. They each have their own rules that need to be explained as their powers become more and more abstract. Part 6 has a lot of abstract stands.</br></br>  <br>It's a fighting manga. The whole point is to create situations that the protagonists struggle to resolve by brain and brawn. In a lot of ways Jojo is entirely responsible for the modern shonen "overcome all odds with my friends" genre. I can see why it'd become dull, the writing has never really been it's strong suit. I like it for the art.</br>  <br>part 5 also has an ass translation for a majority of it (thankfully the pace of the re-translation is picking up). Like, if duwang was bad because the translators didn't have the best grasp on english, the old part 5 translation is bad because the translators don't have the best grasp on japanese</br>    <br>It's been 100 years, the body is DIO's now.</br>  <br>The art is definitely part of what keeps me reading. The art in Part 4 started to get a bit more "generic" in my opinion, and I suddenly realized in part 5 that no one can do anything without posing like they're on a fashion magazine cover, but it's still beautiful to look at (weird hair and clothing aside). <br><br><br>Part 4 was absolute hell for me to get through because of that. Even besides the Duwang shit, I recognized two absolutely unnecessary references to Homestuck in the translation that made me pissed because if you throw in shit like that, how am I supposed to be able to trust your translation at all?<br><br><br>The fact that that body can produce a Joestar would indicate otherwise to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fuck?</br>  ITT: We post JoJo songs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e0q<wbr>3lby5bDQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Wait, what were the homestuck references?

I need your help to find a song<br>Years ago someone posted a song, it had a pretty old time and classy style, that was all about a man who killed a girl and kept her hand to himself because it was pretty, the lyrics had a part like "I wish the rest of you was here too" I don't know.<br><br>JoJo readers went mad about how much Kira had in common with this song. Please, if you know the song, giveme the name.</br></br></br>  <br>Josuke has kept four balls with him all the times he remember.</br>  <br>Cleaning and/or typesetting. You probably were able to all 3 but I assume you did translations, right?</br>  <br> They do <br>like what?</br></br>    I want to gabo gabo Karera.  <br>I've done translation, cleaning and QC in other groups before, but they didn't need any help in translation and I'm currently not interested in doing cleaning so I'm QC (and resident punmaster) there.</br>  <br>No, unless those two cops have stands</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vAV<wbr>xW5uoQe8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I still think this song really was Araki's inspiration for Kira</br></br></br></br>  <br>similar appearance (plus kira and josefumi appear to be related, explaining why a fusion between the two could be easily mistaken for one or the other)</br>  Fuck, I hate JoJolion. Every chapter opens several more questions.    <br>they dont look alike at all</br>  <br>Really piss me off.</br>  Sinve Araki moved to Ultra, JoJo became more sexual than ever.  <br>I wonder how lewd part 4 would ave gotten with Yukako if it was in Ultra<br>Or part 5 with Trish</br></br>  Whoa, these two football guys have quite a unique power I haven't seen before in JoJo. As for Karera, her power won't protect her from these guys unless she has more abilities we haven't seen yet.  What does karera's stand do exactly? I didnt understand it.<br><br>Also no more jo2uke or gappy. Now its Josefumi time</br></br>  <br>And less gory and violent.</br>  <br>I hope all four fight together.<br>I loved that part 5 had all those tag battles.</br></br>  Man Eyes of Heaven is such a fucking bummer<br>I mean the fact that it'll only be ok at best just makes me wish they were putting the effort into making a sequel to ASB that plays like HttF</br>  <br><br>And let's not forget part 6 with the gang of prison sluts</br></br>  <br>Something is telling Yukako would have hug Koichi really her against her breast or Okuyasu watching some girls teets.</br>  <br>really, to me it looked like a mix of nut king call and that stand that switches items in the user's hands from one of the novels, unless I was looking at it wrong.</br>  <br>Show some respect! I liked Miraschon and Gwess.</br>  <br>That pirate joke actually made me laugh, shit.</br>  <br> Less gory and violent <br> Pucci's death <br> Wekapipo's death </br></br></br>  If the kanji for Josefumis last name is the same as Jotaros then why did they spell it differently? Just trying to be more correct or what?<br><br><br>QC? You mean typesetting or what?<br><br><br>Well at least it doesn't look as trash as it did in the first demo. I know what you mean though, real jojo fighting game when</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One guy can switch body parts with another by touching. The other can teleport other objects and materialize them from his hand. Both are rock related.<br><br>These are very dangerous people.</br></br></br>  Wow can't believe I didn't notice that white sailor outfit is just a reference to Jotaru "Autism" Kujo's aquaman fantasies.<br><br>Man I'm slow as a motherfucker</br></br>  Kira doesn't look anything like Kira.  So Gappy's other half is called Jose?  <br>Part 6 was in Weekly Shounen Jump. I'll give you Wekapipo's death though, even if it's just kind of more gruesome that Shigechi's death.</br>  <br>Tripfag pls we all read it 3 days ago </br>  <br>Josef</br>  <br>QC as in quality check, it's like an advanced type of proofreading where you "proofread" every step of the process, the cleaning/redrawing, the typesetting, the translation, the entire result, and then at the end pronounce the work ready for release (though every scanlation group allocates QC work differently in my experience, some require the QC to actually go and fix every mistakes he finds himself, others just want you to tell them what you find wrong and they'll fix it themselves, etc). It requires extensive knowledge of all steps involved in scanlation and you have to be available a lot for discussions with the staff etc, but I like doing it because I'm a nitpicker that likes telling people how they did things wrong. But if there's still typos and shit in the end release, it's my responsibility so that's that.<br><br>I know, but it's still more satisfying to read it on nicely cleaned and typeset pages instead of dirty raws with a script on hand. And judging from the reactions, many people avoided reading it that way and instead waited for the full release.</br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br> Wekapipo <br> Shigechi <br>damn feelings</br></br></br>   Jojo parts described in one sentence: <br><br>part 1: downtown abby with vampire, sunlight kungfu, and the titanic<br><br>part 2: ancient homosexual aztec vampire gods get trolled by british human bugs bunny<br><br>part 3: A jap, his gramps, a muslim, a metrosexual, and a frenchman all hunt down a british vampire banana man on the other side of the world<br><br>part 4: a quiet town has a fetish murderer, manga artist, and a couple of characters up to no good, while a gang of school kids hustle niggas left and right.<br><br>part 5: a group of gay fashionistas seek to find their pink hyena leader to save his daughter<br><br>part 6: women go to prison with a 10 year old boy while a gay black catholic priest ends the entire universe for his deceased gay lover<br><br>part 7: Paraplegic and an aspiring Italian comic race across america to find the corpse of jesus christ and kill the president while dinosaurs wait for them at every turn<br><br>part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As part of the JJCA crew that does Part 5, QC is kind of split between me, the typesetter and part-cleaner, and another person who proofreads and does the rest of the cleaning. It's kind of hard to check for translation errors when you don't know a lick of Japanese and have to check the raws for proper punctuation, sentence length, and names being said.</br>  How will "grow hair where you touch after I touch you" beat "teleport things that I touch elsewhere?"  <br>It's actually a reference to doppio's sailor fantasies</br>  Post images that would really confuse people who don't read JoJo.      <br><br>That's why it's best for QC to also have at least cleaning/typesetting knowledge and translation skills. It's much easier to work with a small group of staff where everyone has one or two jobs than a big group where the work is split up awkwardly. Sometimes those kinds of groups can't be avoided of course, but it's still favorable to avoid them as much as possible.</br></br>  <br>Took me until I read part 8 to get this (obviously) but I would see it in threads and have no clue what it meant</br>  <br>Fuck me, how did I miss that?<br><br><br>Alright then. I noticed there are two cleaners so I might go for typesetting though I know the guy is picky about typesetting. idk. I should probably redownload skype.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What does karera's stand do exactly? I didnt understand it. <br>It's pretty straightforward.<br>It makes a person's hair grow in the spot she makes the person touch. She can't make it grow herself and the hair disappears when she's not in the area.<br>A pretty shit stand even worse than love deluxe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah.. SBR was pretty damn violent. Some of the deaths were really gruesome, like leaving the Boom Boom brothers to bleed out in the desert and Diego becoming half the man he used to be.</br>  <br>saved</br>  This chapter was too lewd for me.  <br> part 1: downtown abby <br> downtown abby <br> downtown </br></br></br>  Karera and her stand are fucking disgusting.  <br>I don't find the typesetting hurdles to be higher in HWMN than in other good groups? And we already have a typesetter anyway, but recruitment is kewls job so I guess you should talk it out with him.</br>  <br>Damn it, she's kind of cute in a trashy way.</br>  <br> How will "grow hair where you touch after I touch you" beat "teleport things that I touch elsewhere?" <br>So Autumn Leaves ver. 2 vs downgraded Love Deluxe</br></br>  <br>Maybe if they came out at a reasonable pace it wouldn't be so bad. We basically got one large plot development and now we have to wait another fucking month to figure out who the new pillarmen are.</br>  <br><br>Dat Spaghettimind</br></br>  <br> brb about to edit Karera sucking Gappys dick  i'm gonna color him black too <br><br><br>She's geniune "white" trash<br><br><br>Kewls the guy I emailed and stuff about it, he told me himself that he's really picky with it and tries to replicate the japanese fonts to english fonts.</br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>    <br>Yeah, but the fonts are already picked for this series so you just have to use the ones we allocated for it.</br>  <br>wtf happened with my spoilers? I only meant to put it on the first reply</br>  <br>It's only me, NearZero, and Daxing Dan that's working on Part 5 at the moment. Checking for translation accuracy's a bitch when Daxing Dan isn't available all the time.  And you know how people here love to complain about the old scans. <br><br><br>Still won't beat Part 6 in those departments though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're disgusting.</br>  <br>It's pretty sad to think about her reaction when she will find out that her loved Josefumi is dead</br>  Give me some good panels for black Gappy from the new chapter, I can't decide which to use.  <br>After he moved to ultra, Araki become so lewd.</br>  <br>Actual sex scene when?</br>  <br>There isn't much holding him back now</br>  Reminder that if you like Evangelion, you are most likely a terrorist.  <br>Higher suicide rate<br>Less reproducing<br>And no shit Sherlock you should really educate yourself because Japan only bans guns because of the WWII agreement with the US <br>That agreement is like over 100 years long</br></br></br></br>  <br>More to the point, a larger and denser nignog population.<br>Black Americans have a disproportionately high gun crime rate.
