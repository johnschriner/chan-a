Vulović, 22 years old at the time, was a flight attendant on board. She was not scheduled to be on that flight; she had been mixed up with another flight attendant who was also named Vesna. <br><br> Vulović fell approximately 10,160 meters (33,333 ft). She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae (one crushed completely) that left her temporarily paralyzed from the waist down, and two broken legs. She was in a coma for 27 days. In an interview, she commented that according to the man who found her, "...I was in the middle part of the plane. I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane. The man who found me says I was very lucky. He was in the German Army as a medic during World War II. He knew how to treat me at the site of the accident." <br><br> Vulović continued working for JAT at a desk job following a full recovery from her injuries. She regained the use of her legs after surgery and continued to fly sporadically. She claims she has no fear of flying, which she attributes to the loss of memory of the crash, and she even enjoys watching movies with plane crashes.[4] She is considered a national heroine throughout the former Yugoslavia. <br><br>You can't be too certain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Gundam Wing.

Especially due to the last episode's title.<br>Real answer: There's an established harem in a school, but the MC views the girls as something to protect and guide more than anything, essentially like a shepherd and his sheep. These girls show slight abnormalities but nothing too extreme. The plot really gets going once the Bro character enters the fold, as the dude wants to help guide the poor little sheep too. He becomes the MC's sheepdog. Girls hate the new dynamic and their 'quirks' become larger for a time but the Bro calms things down. Then, something happens to make a Kouhai of MC's become 'lost'. The MC finds her and looks for an answer to her problem, finds it and sends her on her way. Bro's help is essential in this process, and the girls get jealous of the Bro's closeness to the MC. This causes chaos in the harem and the girls start throwing a fit. They eventually turn this anger on to the MC, but find that the Bro character fends them off at all costs, including his reputation. This drives them mad and their individual psychoses start flaring into the foreground. They reveal their status as 'Wolves' and start viciously attacking Bro in all kinds of ways. MC finally has enough of it, reveals he's gay, and calls the police on the bitches, finally seeing that they are irredeemable in their natures. He then decides that it's not his job to help people out like that, so he and the Bro start hanging out and eventually, at the end of the last episode, actually call what they're doing a date.</br></br>  1.

But we all know that either Crocodile, Moria or Kaidou will attack the marine ship and see doffy dying. <br>Also Sanji a best  Secret Dellinger a whore thread </br></br>  <br> fisherman island </br>  <br>hair</br>  <br>The WG sure didn't care when he took over the country</br>  <br> Losing 2 shichis in one arc again <br><br>This shit is gonna get disbanded</br></br></br>  <br> fishman island <br>were already done with dressosa and that took 2 years</br></br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  Gon  Were people surprised? It felt like a natural, albeit extreme, culmination of his character flaws when faced with a situation he couldn't handle. <br><br>Fucking scary though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, i've seen a few posts who said they didn't understand why Gon changed so much, when in reality he hardly changed but just was pushed past his breaking point.<br>Also i don't think it wasn't only a culmination of his flaws, but of everything that defined him as a character.</br></br>  <br>You're right, not just his flaws but also his good traits like optimism and determination. I really loved that aspect of it.</br>  <br>So he's like kid Goku.</br>    Gon is so cute  I really like Gon, he's a great and precious character.  <br>yeah but it was subtle enough to pass the radar<br><br>the Crimera ant thing was much more easy to notice</br></br></br>  <br>gon a best</br>  What a nice kid.  <br>I wish Shoot got to thank him. He needs that right now, kind words and praise</br>  Hypocrisy is a construction of society, though. That's where the idea of holding yourself to some sort of stated set of values came from.<br><br>Gon just like what he like, and don't like what he don't like. It's the same as when Goreinu wanted to shit on Bomber, but but wanted to heal Killua instead. <br><br>That being said Gon needs to learn to chill the fuck out and he doesn't learn that lesson from being 99% dead then fuck him</br></br></br></br>  Tell me /a/, where does he place on the character alignment?  <br>definitely chaotic neutral</br>  <br>People cannot handle characters in shounen handling situations like real people would in real life. They think hypocrites are poorly written characters<br><br>Gon is a kid who needed to decide between avenging one of the few truly influential figures in his life or getting through with the rescue plan safely</br></br></br>  <br>Hisoka is Chaotic Neutral. Gon is Lawful Good, that's why he was so conflicted in the first place.</br>  <br> Gon is Lawful Good <br>What makes you say that? I've started rereading the CA arc and the only part where Gon seems truly "good" is when he tries to rush and stop Yunju from crushing one of the guys he kept on a leash.</br></br>  <br>Gon also could not understand how the Genei Ryodan would kill people they didn't know.</br>  <br>Nah, he's neutral good if anything. maybe chaotic good.</br>  Gon will be a fucking monster if he has to, it's just that he acts nice in normal settings.  <br>There was also this guy.</br>  <br>Can we say he tries really hard to be Lawful Good? I mean, Neutral Good and Chaotic Good are definitely Kurapika and Leorio</br>  <br>He isn't acting.</br>  <br>Isn't Kurapika more like chaotic neutral?</br>  <br>If he were Chaotic Neutral he wouldn't care about the eyes anymore as they serve no purpose to him. Him wanting to serve justice means he has some good, albeit twisted, inside of him.</br>  <br>He got mad at the Spiders for indiscriminately killing people with no regard for their lives.</br>  Since we're discussing alignment now, let me try to give the best examples for the remaining ones:<br>Lawful Neutral - Netero. Otherwise he would have gone on a dojo rampage after becoming super strong instead of becoming chairman.<br>True Neutral - Zeno. The Ant situation barely phased the Zoldycks and Komugi dying made him lament not being able to act truly neutral.<br>Lawful Evil - Meruem. Don't think there's a lot to discuss from this point onward.<br>Neutral Evil - Genthru.<br>Chaotic Evil - Pariston.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Illumi?</br>  <br> Meruem <br> evil <br>What? <br>Uvo would be lawful evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaotic Neutral, just like Hisoka. He wants to preserve the family hierarchy but at the same time he wants to control Alluka's power.</br>  <br> Lawful Evil - Meruem. <br>get the fuck out of here</br></br>  <br>He could never realize the evil in his ways of maintaining humanity as cattle for the Ants. In fact, his revival only made his become more delusional about his intelligence and the true meaning of equality.</br>  <br> Chaotic Evil - Pariston. </br>  <br>Pariston stop posting</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Although I can agree maybe we already have better examples. I'd like to place Chrollo and the Spiders or Gyro in that spot but we have no clue what their motives are.<br>their motivations are</br></br></br></br></br>  YOU    <br><br>lawful evil is pouf, completely bound to the 'rule' of serving meruem</br></br>  <br>CAN</br>  <br>But that was what he was biologically programmed for. Those were his innate instincts, there was nothing evil about it at all. He forgave Pouf, wished good luck to Welfin, spared Knuckle's and Meleoron's lives, judged himself unworthy of his RG's loyalty and gave up on everything once he remembered the thing he truly cared about as a person.<br>He is not evil in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br>More like Teen Gohan 2.0<br><br>You do know the ENTIRE Chimera Ant Arc is based of the Cell saga, right? <br><br>Culmination of DNA built into one "perfect" being? <br>Check<br>Netero sacrificing himself for humanity? (Do I hear Goku?) <br>Check<br>Netero power up scene in front of Colt IDENTICAL TO GOKU POWER UP SCENE IN FRONT OF KORIN where both are told they're not strong enough? <br>Check<br>Self-destruction bomb used (TRIED to be used in DBZ) on perfect being? <br>Check<br>Young boy realising tremulous power that culmunates from hatred? <br>Check<br><br>Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ho before bros <br> not evil </br></br>  Pariston is more chaotic neutral than evil IMO.<br><br><br> more delusional about his intelligence <br>What do you mean? Meruem was very smart and capable of rationalizing moral values; the only issue was that his standards stemmed from a position in which Ants were the key species, not us.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Teen Gohan 2.0 <br>How exactly? I'm curious, it's been a while since i read DBZ.<br> Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen <br>I'm pretty sure he does get an immense amount of credit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the whole point was what would a perfect being like that actually think and feel upon coming into existence. Kind of like how Gon was like what if a super optimistic stereotypical shounen protagonist actually existed and had to deal with things like loss and failure?<br><br>It's no secret that Togashi takes influence from Dragon Ball</br></br></br>  <br>I understand where you're coming from but I'm judging him on the perspective of the story as a whole, not on each character's nature.<br><br>For example, maybe the Ryodan have a good reason for killing all those people, but none would make them be good. If I were to judge them from their perspective, they would be heroes.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never hold hands with Gon </br>  which part of hunter x hunter left the biggest impression on you? it was netero vs. meruem for me. the scale and brutality of that fight was insane.  <br>116 for sure.</br>  <br>The dodgeball game</br>  <br>gon and killua</br>  <br>Pushed to his breaking point. A usually young, playful, caring boy having power brought out by rage. Gohan's character changed when fighting Cell. He never liked fighting, but after going Super Saiyan 2 he only wanted to punish Cell. Make him feel pain and fear instead of killing him quickly. Basically torturing him. Though with the speed of DBZ, that phase didn't last too long. Gon, on the other hand, is an even more extreme version and is drawn out more, as you can see from Hunter X Hunter.</br>  <br>That picture is so disingenuous because Madhouse altered the events of the first chapter.</br>  <br>Not really altered, just rearanged.<br>Doesn't change the fact that everything you see in the pic would still have been in ep 1 even with the Kite flashback, it's a very short one.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br><br>If we're talking about scenes, though, it's definitely this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VYQ<wbr>rOXbznKs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Few were able to better flesh out characters like this scene did with Ging and Gon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay anon, at least we have this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nDg<wbr>WDlvvaNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Probably that one scene of Kaito under that cherry blossom tree at the end of GI, even though it's like one page. Netero vs Meruem was great too, I really liked the analogies of the field of needles and a contest in which one must consecutively make the correct choice.</br>  <br>This part. It sent chills down my spine when I first read it.</br>  <br>Togashi's really good at conveying expressions. Most other mangaka would have everyone looking shocked instead of tailoring it to each character's personality.</br>  <br><br>the yorknew arc made me realize this wasn't going to be an average shonen. aside from uvo, the phantom troupe all remained alive and escaped, as opposed to becoming structured 'boss battles' for kurapika. chrollo was also a very interesting 'villain', i haven't really seen anyone like him before.</br></br>  <br><br>gon-san jadedly smashing what remained of pitou's head, still muttering his rock-paper-scissors callout.</br></br>  <br>This is the essence of HxH</br>  <br>Right? The part with Gon and Killua following Kurapika's plan from Leorio's directions really sealed the deal for me.<br><br>Chrollo also looks like he's in just as much of a struggle as Kurapika to get to his objective, from the fight against Silva and Zeno.</br></br></br>  As someone who recently watched the 2011 anime then went back and read the manga, what is the justification for not showing Kaito's flashback at the very beginning? It seems like a pointless change.  anyone else find greed island just sort of...clumsy? the dodgeball finale was great but i thought the rest of it was all over the place.  <br>Gohan had gotten angry before and the thing that changed about his character was the maturation past his cowardly nature. He only needed a little push at that point and that's why Goku had him fight Cell. <br><br>Sure it was rage that brought him there, but he was still himself and was even still holding himself back.<br><br>More or less, Gohan is a regular person psychologically where as Goku and Gon are sociopaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty angry at the 2011 adaptation for making him look so fucking ugly. His appearance along with his somewhat disturbing facial expression was a big part of his charisma.</br>  <br>Same here. It had a lot of potential, specially since Togashi looked like he was gonna follow some RPG structure, but it turned out to be more like... all sidequests? It was cool that he managed to fit in the training sequence with Bisky in it without it feeling forced, though.</br>  <br>This video reminds me that we don't see enough of HxH's beasts. We see pterodactyls and "chocobo" in Kurapika's flashback arc, though. Where the fuck did he live?</br>  <br>These<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QvNU<wbr>kqHni6o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>he looks too 'cute' in 2011. in the manga it's impossible to determine what he's thinking, which makes him eerie/more of an effective antagonist.</br></br>  <br><br>Greed Island is a mess, the card system just slows the story down and the 'reveal' of it not being a game at all was pretty poorly done. I'm fine with the twist itself, but it didn't carry any weight.</br></br>  Hajimeruyooo~  <br>Nothing. Madhouse fucked up immensely.</br>  <br><br>all i can think of is to build mystery when gon/killua finish GI and encounter him under the tree. so the audience has more of a 'who the fuck is that' reaction rather than 'oh, it's kite'.</br></br>  <br>There WAS no reason. There's a lot of things Madhouse messed up on</br>  <br>GI is an amazing arc. Its obvious you dont enjoy it if you cant follow the meaning of the game for Gon's pals and for the rest of the players.</br>  <br> it didn't carry any weight. <br>I'm fairly certain it wasn't supposed to be an important plot point, they kind of just shrugged it off.</br></br>  <br>Director's waifu was certainly true</br>  <br>HxH is all over the place in case you haven't noticed. It's an intentional design.</br>  <br>Do you thin shonen characters turn strongers just because of power of friendship? Yes, GI is a "training" arc, but it gives a great sifnificant of nen and it gives too the support of how much Gon and Killua become stronger during the arc. And thats the reason why Biske is so important in the plot.</br>  <br>Damn, that directing is pretty fucking good. I think i need to rewatch the old version.</br>  <br>No, he understood how they could kill people they didn't know, he didn't understand how they could feel upset over their own being killed and nothing over anyone else.</br>  <br>I think you're almost right. He didn't understand how they could do it, but he wasn't upset at them for it, it seemed like he genuinely wanted to understand why. The only thing that made him upset is the fact that they could feel bad over one of their members being killed.</br>  <br>I watched the show first and that was my exact reaction. Thought it was kind of cool how they just jumped straight into the next arc with a new character we knew nothing about.</br>  <br>It felt structured like a training arc meant to give Gon and Killua their nen abilities.<br><br>The ending to it was contrived. <br> "Everyone who came here was prepared to die, that's why we're letting their killers live". <br><br>Aside from its resolution, it was a decent but lighthearted arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And, obviously, GI is much better in manga than any anime version (OVA version is awful).</br>  There would be no issues if people would just be his friend. But no, they just have to be the antagonists. They chose their own fate  <br>I thought the OVA was okay. Then again this was a long time ago. I don't really know.</br>  <br> 'oh, it's kite'. <br>I was actually very happy to see him again after like 180 chapters because he's a really cool guy.</br></br>  <br>easily the dragon dive scene, it gives me shivers no matter how many times i rewatch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=86M<wbr>oueTiBXE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a big fan of the 99 version. I think it had the best version of York Shin and I complain a lot about the 11 version for its directorial flaws.<br><br>The GI OVAs however were fucking shite.</br></br></br>  <br><br>and now he's a loli.</br></br>  <br><br>pouf going apeshit is great.</br></br>  <br>Dat episode</br>  <br> 1:08 <br>God damn, Zeno's VA REALLY nailed that part</br></br>   watch the first Madhouse movie thinking it's gonna be great with more Troupe interactions <br> they don't do shit in the whole movie and instead it's about the edgy chuuni villain and his imouto complex <br> has more Killua Illumi angst even though he canonically can't get over it yet since he doesn't pull out the needle until later <br>Boy was that a disappointment. Is the other movie any better?</br></br></br>  <br>He's a natural born psychopath. The way he absorb things after he left his house is like a sponge. Whether it's good or bad he takes interest in it without a second consideration. His concept of "good" is only imitation because that's what his aunt taught when he grow up with her. Imagine Gon was growing up in the same place as Chrollo, his perception and personality would fall to the later personality. He might even be crazier than Chrollo.</br>  <br>No. The movies are basically fanfics.</br>  <br>I love how Togashi just added a narrator to the final half of the CA arc. When he's talking about the Ants it looks like a National Geographic documentary.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with the art on that page.</br>  <br>Togashi stop posting and make a new chapter</br>  <br> Pitou's expressions </br>  <br> Is the other movie any better? <br> <br>I enjoyed it a lot more since Gon and Killua actually have their abilities instead of just Ten/Ren, but it definitely wasn't a masterpiece by any means.</br></br></br>  What gender is Pitou actually?  <br>Please don't start</br>  <br>Probably female, but we'll never know for sure</br>  <br>That's why I said Gohan 2.0<br><br>But Gon got angry before that point too? For both of them it was their breaking point and power up. <br><br>Like I said, Gon was more extreme and willing to kill an innocent person for his selfish purposes, whereas Gohan as willing to keep everyone on danger by keeping Cell alive for his own selfish purposes, which isn't as extreme, but is similar. Whereas, Gon is the more extreme version in an arc that seems to have taken away from Gohan's arc, which makes him Gohan 2.0</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You tell me</br>  <br>Transnigger</br>  <br>that's a cat</br>  <br>He was put in a similar situation, but with his own circumstances and has pretty different morals and personality. That hardly makes him Gohan 2.0. <br>But i do understand where you're coming from.</br></br>  <br>Wrong, that's a  cute </br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>she's a fucking ant, are you really this desperate?</br>  <br>a psychopath wouldn't get that angry over kite's death</br>  <br><br>Was he? i always felt he was some kind of psicopath/ sociopath...</br></br>  Isn't Shu the one where they focus their aura on a weapon?  <br>They are more likely than a normal person.</br>  <br>He was angry because he was a factor in Kite's death, not just over it. I don't think he would have reacted the same way if it wasn't the case.<br><br>That's correct, but Ko is when all your aura is concentrated into a single point. Shu is just making your aura flow through an object.</br></br></br>  <br>i guess he means because it's from the perspective of a guy who just got conked on the head by a very heavy super yo yo</br>  <br> gon growing up raised by an assassin family <br> killua raised by mito in the mountains <br> they meet each other <br>they'd still like each other</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon punching Hisoka.</br>  <br>No altered, very little of chapter 1 is actually in the 2011 adaptation.</br>  <br>That or he has Asperger's Syndrome.</br>  <br>They are more likely to act violent, but Gon had real feelings involved. He was just as sad as he was angry. Togashi wouldn't make Gon a psychopath.</br>  <br> Togashi wouldn't make Gon a psychopath <br><br>Really.</br></br></br>  <br>He isn't anon.</br>  A psychopath doesn't experience emotions the same way a normal person does. Nor do they have a conscience. Chrollo may be one. But gon certainly isn't. He has a conscience and a set of morals. Albeit an odd one.  <br>as i explained on<br><br><br>People can't deal with their characters not always sticking to a set behavior, so they try to address one to them themselves<br><br>Gon gets called a psychopath even though he has very well structured emotions and moral reasoning through the entire story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or they're just moralfags who can't get it through their heads that HxH doesn't follow their moral compass.</br>  <br><br>The nen system feels so authentic with the way everything has a checks and balances system. <br><br>You need more physical power? Use Ko on your fist/leg/object but subject to yourself to more damage since all your aura concentrated on a specific place leaves you defenseless <br><br>Need more defense? Increase your Ten into a Ken state but you won't be able to maintain it since it drains your aura(stamina) at a rapid pace <br><br>Ryu doesn't even need a name or be identified since it's something every Nen user does in battle by applying more aura to a specific body part in real time combat whether it be for offense or defense <br><br>Need Stealth? Stop your aura flow with Zetsu but again subject yourself to increased damage <br><br>Then throw in how emotions affect Nen, Vows/Contracts, and finally something of a beast on its own, Hatsu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Chimera Ant so polarizing?  <br>It drags out a lot</br>  <br><br>I think it's the best arc of the series but even I can see it has some pacing issues. <br><br>115, and 130(and the respective manga chapters) are literally blue ball episodes which setup high points for the arc</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the manga the pacing isn't terrible but because of the constant hiatuses it took a while for it to finally end. So people got arc fatigue. For a while readers had a similar reaction to Greed Island arc because it took so long to end.<br><br>The 2011 adaptation didn't help things by dragging on the arc.</br></br></br>  <br> The 2011 adaptation didn't help things by dragging on the arc. <br>Uh oh. So it's probably better to read rather than watch?</br></br>  <br>Just do whatever the fuck you want. Both are essentially the same as far as pacing goes, albeit with slight atmospheric differences.</br>  <br>Yes, Gon definitely comes across as sane. He was just having a bad day was all.</br>  <br>Considering how the 2011 cut out key parts of the MC's backstory which plays a part in his involvement in the same arc that MADHOUSE was rushing to get to, I'd say it was doomed for failure.<br><br>At this point in time only really 2011fags who'll claim that Madhouse handled it well.</br></br></br>  <br>I watched first, and it wasn't horrible. The parts where it drags on have incredibly badass fights inbetween so it's not too bad, I've certainly seen much much worse. It never got even close to bad enough where I considered skipping through episodes or skipping episodes altogether.</br>  <br>Is Arturo Vidal a HxH fan?</br>  <br>It's the most ambitious arc that achieves the most in the story, but things on that scale are more susceptible to flaws. Most people cite pacing as the worst part but I found it just fine in the manga, I think it's just a big risk to bring in a bunch of new characters and dedicate a lot of time to each of their role/development. Instead of everything being resolved linearly, it's split up and if you're really into one storyline it will annoy you to switch to another. <br><br><br>Nen is really cleverly written and so well thought out, particularly the vow and limitation part from the writers perspective. It's a built in resolution and conflict plot device, you can solve nearly anything but it forces the character to deal with conflict at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  115 and 116 were such good episodes though that they made me stop being anime only and i read the rest of the manga<br>was not disappointed</br>    Is anyone else here a retard that spoils the ending of CA because they looked up how long each arc was?  <br>I spoiled Ging appearing and being an active character by watching the last 2011 opening</br>  Pitou - lawful girl  <br>ptiou was so obviously neutral evil</br>  <br>I'm one of those idiots who can't resist reading threads and even reading through archived threads while in the middle of watching a show. I'm still so mad at myself for spoiling Meruem's death.</br>  Just finished the anime and "caught up" with the manga.<br><br>5 &gt; 4 = 1 &gt;&gt; 3 &gt; 6 = 2<br><br>Some people shit on Chimera, but I think it's a flawed masterpiece.<br><br>What do you guys think about the story continuing after 339? I think the story found it's natural conclusion in the tree, and outside of some unfinished plot strands like Hisoka and Illumi's arc, I thought the story ended at a perfect time. IMO, HxH continuing with a new arc is an enormous mistake as it's committing to an enormous story (that doesn't need to be told) for an overall saga that frankly isn't as sustainable long term as One Piece. I feel like the ideal scenario is to finish the story conclusively over 20-30 chapters and just let it rest, if not retcon the last ten chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A V <br><br>you blind fuck</br></br></br>  <br> it's split up and if you're really into one storyline it will annoy you to switch to another.  <br>This so much. I think this arc has great reread/rewatch value because once you know what happens you pay more attention to the details of each scene.</br></br>  <br> lmao pitou btfo</br>  Yupi is best RG.  <br>The story was always fucking meant to continue after CA arc.<br><br>Kurapika and fucking LEorios objectives hadn't been resolved.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually the opposite situation to One Piece. In One Piece, there is a lot of build up for the mystery of One Piece, but with HxH the entire series was Gon getting sidetracked or even forgetting about Ging, so of course it makes sense for when we finally do meet him for it to be nothing special and for the story to continue on beyond that, because ultimately Ging was nothing special. Gon even points that out when he Talks to Mito.</br>  <br> more than half of the plot points are left unresolved <br> it's done guys <br>Nope</br></br></br>  <br>wow<br><br>ant arc was just about character growth...and the change in relationship between Killua and Gon..it wasnt the ultimate build up of hxh<br><br>Gon meeting Ging at the end was just a sidenote.<br><br>Other plotlines were still as important....also What Ging has been up to and his main objective has been scratched at multiple times in the manga.<br><br>The Dark continent ins the ultimate goal of the ultimate hunters which Ging has been for a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Gon is interested in the Dark Continent he just can't go along with Ging is all.</br>    <br>I don't recall Gon being interested in the DC, are you sure about that?</br>  <br>They could have been left as is.<br><br>Kurapika got the eyes back showing he got some level of closure in some context.<br><br>Gon proudly proclaimed Leorio was going to be a doctor during the election's conclusion and that honestly felt good enough.<br><br>As someone who loved HxH and YYH, Togashi doesn't have it in him to give this series the continuation it deserves. 339 left it in a good enough place I think, and definitely a better place than YYH left off even with light unresolved threads.<br><br>And from what we've seen, I think DCE is looking to be the worst arc yet. It feels the same as if they decided to continue Yu Yu Hakusho for a fifth arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more than half <br><br>Yeah, okay big guy.</br></br></br>  <br>During the talk with Mito, he admits that he wanted to go along with Ging.</br>  What's the word on the hiatus? Do we think we're looking at another 2+ years before it starting up again?<br><br>Trying to decide if I even want to start the new arc.</br></br>  <br>I just checked, i guess you're right. Though i think he just would have been interested in going with Ging, not in the DC itself.</br>  <br>The Spiders are still alive, and we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan either so no there wouldn't be any closure there.<br><br>The election in and of itself was obvious build up for something else.<br><br>Again the story went out of it's way to show that meeting Ging was nothing important, that's why the story continues on afterward.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HxH isn't worth it anon. Save yourself before it's too late.</br>  <br>Don't. Wait for new chapters. The few chapters we have of that arc are basically info dumps and are hyping the DC up really well, it's very frustrating.</br>  <br>How are DC arc and YYH even remotely similar? If Togashi continues the way he has, DC arc is going to be extremely unpredictable and most likely extremely good. All the different characters and plot lines involved have so much potential, he's set it all up so thoroughly and it looks to be on such a huge scale. <br><br>He seemed to have gotten a big burst of inspiration for it, hopefully he commits to it.</br></br></br>  What are the odds Ging is Yusuke Urameshi?<br><br>Damn, he looks, acts, and sounds exactly like a 40 year old Yusuke would.</br></br>  <br>The only that was really resolvevd was Gon meeting Ging, which the story built up as not important. And Leorio becoming a doctor. There are far more plot points left open:<br><br>- The mystery of the dark continent<br>- The Spiders and all of their plot points<br>- Kurapika's revenge<br>- Alluka<br>- Ging's motives</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan <br>Anon... for money. There's no mystery at all about why the troupe do things, they're thieves who steal valuable things even if they happen to be body parts.<br><br>You're right that their story is nowhere near resolved though.</br></br></br></br>  Alluka is pretty much to this what Bran is to GoT: A mistake that needs to be dropped as fast as possible.  <br>There are people who honestly do think that the story was just about Gon and Killua's relationship. As well as Gon finding Ging.</br>  <br>Then who ordered it? We just found out who the Spiders were working for, and even then you have the subject of how Kurapika is going to get his revenge on them.</br>  <br> who ordered it? <br>I don't think they're mercenaries, they just sold the body parts.</br></br>  <br>Alluka is actually tied to the dark continent.</br>  <br>Anon we already know who ordered them to do it, my question was rhetorical.</br>  <br> we only post when there's no discussion you guise </br>  <br>My bad, i misunderstood your post.</br>  <br>There are a lot of parts in Chimera Ant that stick out in my head as things I'll remember for a real long time.<br><br> Dragon Dive scene <br> The nightmarish Netero/Meruem scene where the chairman activates the rose bomb <br> Meruem's final hours/the conclusion of that love story (honestly maybe my favorite part in the entire series) <br> Gon turns into an Ultimate Gohan-level monster from pure hate alone just to murder Pitou </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan either <br><br>the Kurta took something from Ryūseigai, Ryūseigai sends the spider to kill the Kurta, Kurapika thanks to her first PMS reveals the location of the Kurta, We reject no one, so take nothing from us.</br></br></br>  <br>Which was only shown after 339, disputing anon's belief that the story could have ended there.</br>   tfw no one has ever tried making a game based on HxH in the modern era <br> tfw the only appearances are in the Jump fighting games <br><br>Is there a chance of this series ever getting the One Piece/Naruto or even HnK treatment? It's one of the top 25 selling manga ever, the 2011 show was pretty damn popular, and it's built for the anime game treatment more than most anime that actually get it.<br><br>What kind of game do you want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's built for the anime game treatment more than most anime that actually get it <br>Hardly, i really don't see some hatsus and how nen works in fight being incorporated (Ryu, Ko, In and the likes) into a fighting game.<br> I'd love a Greed Island RPG though </br></br></br>  <br> doens't know about HxH <br><br>HxH has a lot of games released for it, granted most of them were released for the manga or for the '99 anime, there are strategy games, adventure games and role playing games. Hell there was even a Harvest Moon-esque simulator.</br></br></br>  <br> in the modern era <br>Read.</br></br>  <br>If you mean a game for the 2011 anime, then it not having a video game actually tells you a lot about it's actual popularity.</br>  <br><br>How Uvogin killed those Shadow Beasts so easily, I mean, Jesus, he basically ate his skull.</br></br>  <br>Uvo was so fucking based, it's unfortunate he was the first to go.</br>  I just finished the 2011 anime after watching the '99 anime up until the end of Yorkshin a couple years ago and I feel pretty satisfied. I understand that what most people fault the 2011 version for is the lack of Kite, but is there anything else as big as that?<br><br>I plan on reading the manga from start to finish sometime in the future when (or if) there's enough new chapters to justify it, but having seen both anime I feel like I have a fairly complete experience. Of course, I will move the manga up my list of priorities if I'm wrong.</br></br>  <br>There are differences in characterization between both anime and manga. It's always better to start over from the very start.<br><br>Cause you'll be waiting a while for Togashi to get off his hiatus.</br></br></br>   HxH still on hiatus <br> Berserk is back <br> even fucking D Gray Man is back <br>There is no end to this suffering</br></br></br>  <br><br>They probably didn't include Kite at the beginning because they weren't sure they were going to animate the whole thing when it was announced in case the series got shit tv ratings on Sunday morning<br><br>If anons forget or didn't watch it as it was airing, let me remind you when the anime was announced it was commonly listed as 48+ episodes which would've placed the "end" right after Kurapika vs Uvogin</br></br></br></br>  <br>D.Gray-man, and Berserk were on a much longer hiatus than HxH.</br>  <br>Still makes no sense to include that but to still include their own bullshit, instead.</br>  <br>I want to be happy about Berserk but I'm just jealous as fuck</br>  <br><br> include their own bullshit  <br><br>What the fuck are you talking about? Besides Kite, the story is pretty much the same as the manga except some streamlining of the excessive non relevant details Togashi loved to randomly add</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right about D.Gray man, but i'm pretty sure the latest Berserk hiatus started after the HxH one</br>  <br>It's your own fault for liking the works of artists who have all since lost their work ethic. Togashi is the worst of them too because he sometimes just does scribble chapters when he actually isn't on hiatus.<br><br>All that aside, G.Ray-Man is just a mess, so it's best to pretend that it died long ago. Because it did.</br></br></br>  <br>episode 2 they added in their own character and even gave him his own character arc. They changed the scenes around so that Mito could essentially play the role of Kite. In reality they could have cut down on the chapter 2 material but they didn't.<br><br>All of those random things helped us to better understand the world of HxH and the characters. Because of the consistency of which the 2011 anime changes the things they adapt I think that it was more because someone on the staff interpreted the series differently rather the series being streamlined.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Episode 2? With the Kiriko? <br>Seems like you're making a mountain out of a mole hill since that character has nary impact on the big picture of HxH for Gon or the audience</br></br></br>  <br>Look at it this way, which ultimately caused more problems for the 2011 adaptation, including their pointless shit or not adapting chapter 1?<br><br>Considering that we have animefags who are genuinely confused about why Gon cares so much Kite and those who think that this is an accurate representation of Gon in the early part of the series. I wouldn't say that my complaint is something small at all.</br></br></br>  <br>He found the guy that was shot by what's his name's poison arrow a couple days later in the exam arc and carried him over near a pond.</br>  <br> They probably didn't include Kite at the beginning because they weren't sure they were going to animate the whole thing <br>The 99 staff still did it, even if Kite didn't become relevant at the time the anime was made<br>And even then, they changed his relationship with Gon when he was "introduced"</br></br></br>  <br>That's supposed to be him spitting it out in the bottom left panel, right? Am I forgetting wrong, or did they not have that in the anime? I remember being actually disturbed that he had no problem actually eating someone like that.</br>  <br>the porn</br>  <br>Surely you're not talking about shota porn</br>  Why?  <br>Because they both had their childish views shattered by reality</br>  <br>No, Togashi said if he wanted to kill his story he would. Just doesn't give enough of a fuck to work on it regularly.</br>  Okay, I'll say what I think.<br><br>Lawful good : Mizaistom<br>Lawful neutral : Netero<br>Lawful evil : Pariston<br>Neutral good : Gon<br>True Neutral : Zeno<br>Neutral Evil : Illumi<br>Chaotic good : Kurapika<br>Chaotic neutral : Gin<br>Chaotic Evil : Hisoka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want."</br></br>  I dropped hxh before the dark continent arc, I just hate togashi's long dialogs, they make me sleepy and the info in them is usually garbage, better wait for the anime  <br><br>I just wanted to see Gon wreck Pitou's shit the whole time, it took forever to get there. I really do like the Chimera Ant arc though. It had some solid character development and a lot of sub plots that I ended up really liking. And the end was awesome. Not what I expected at all</br></br>  <br>Me too but I think the wait made it all the more enjoyable when it happened. Everything is better with build up, if things happen too fast they lose impact.</br>  Also, Gon looked gay as fuck when he went apeshit on Pitou.  <br><br>Yeah I agree. At the time that's all I wanted, after it happened I knew it was worth the wait.</br></br>  <br>I think anyone would look gay as fuck if they're wearing a twelve year old's clothes when they turn into a buff adult.</br>  <br><br>Meant to reply to this </br></br>  <br> Gon looked gay as fuck <br>It was funny and symbolic, i like Gon-san a lot. His design is the most amusing thing in the series.<br> went apeshit <br>I don't know, he seemed pretty stoic while doing it. He knew it wasn't heroic and he also knew it was fucked up while somewhat maintaining his composure.</br></br></br></br>  I wish Gon had died and Killua became the MC.  <br><br>Except there is so little good HxH porn, shota or no. There needs to be much more.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not saying I didn't like it, I definitely found it a little humorous. I think he went apeshit when he first transformed. It was just pure rage and hate that made him that way.</br></br>  After spending these last couple weeks watching every episode of the 2011 anime, I still don't get why they kept the OP the same for the entire thing. I rarely skip them even when watching many episodes in a row, but I couldn't manage it after the first arc was over, especially considering the shifts in tone that it doesn't match.<br><br>On the other had, I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it.</br></br>  Was there a reason why Gon never interacted with the King?  <br>I think it was a bit more complicated than rage and hate. He really didn't know what to feel, and was experiencing conflicting emotions. Ultimately he came up with the decision that both him and Pitou were at fault for what happened to Kite.<br>The words he said to Pitou before his last blow didn't really seem hateful or angry. I really can't tell what he was feeling.</br></br>  <br>God, I love this page. It really feels like his hand is sticking out of the page and pointing right at you.</br>  <br> I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it <br><br>Same here. Especially the second version used in the Chairman Election arc. This shot with them in the suits was cool.</br></br></br>  <br> being a dirty Killuafag <br>Ging became the MC anyway.</br></br>  <br>Killua wouldn't have taken the hunter test if he wasnt born in an assassin family</br>  <br>Really? I've only seen the anime so I didn't know. That sounds like the next best thing though.  Not that they'll finish the anime while I'm alive. </br>  <br>The people who like it are delusional, and the people who dislike it rightly see it as so absurd within the HxH universe that they can't immerse themselves. <br><br>As soon as you see the human-sized ant, just quit reading.</br></br></br>  Why is there so little  straight  porn of HxH?  <br> so absurd within the HxH universe <br>How so? Creatures like the ants have been around since the first arc</br></br>  So does this show get any better? I dropped it after the Ant arc because Gon turning into the strongest being on the planet despite being 10 years old was fucking retarded.  <br> strongest being on the planet <br>That always was Meruem<br> 10 years old <br>He's 12<br> fucking retarded <br>How exactly?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That always was Muruem <br>Neferpitou clearly stated that he was potentially stronger than the King and he had to try and stop him from getting close to him at all costs<br> He's 12 <br>Not a big difference<br> How exactly <br>Oh i dunno how about because a little kid who only had powers for about a year suddenly turned into a 30 year old man with enough power to kill people who literally dedicated their whole lives to training and perfection in an instant and without any explanation whatsoever? It is literally the equivalent of 12 year old Sakura from Naruto getting angry and killing a Hokage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, but Machi is the best girl.</br>  <br> and without any explanation whatsoever <br>You must be a special kind of retard to not understand something in a battle shonen of all things.</br></br>  <br> It is literally the equivalent of 12 year old Sakura from Naruto getting angry and killing a Hokage. <br>Why is it that retards always go straight to the Naruto comparison?</br></br>  <br>The trips have spoken.<br>I second this, Machi best girl.</br></br>  <br><br> He doesn't like the idea of a little kid being the strongest shit thats ever breathed for no reason! <br> Hahaha what a retard <br>Fucking autists...</br></br></br></br>  <br> Neferpitou clearly stated that he was potentially stronger than the King <br>This never happened. Only that he was as strong as the King, which could be Pitou overreacting like Knov explained. Also, post-nuke Meruem definitely was stronger.<br> without any explanation whatsoever? <br>What? It was all explained in that episode. Gon made a contract, he sacrificed his nen, potential, future and life just to reach his full hypothetic potential for a few minutes. He would have died without Killua and has no powers as a result.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason was literally explained in the same scene. Fuck off back to whatever underage forum you crawled out of.</br>  <br>Purple or pink hair? <br> Pink is the correct answer. </br></br>  <br>Both are great.</br>    <br>Surely you mean Bisky</br>  I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HXH SINCE '02<br><br>MAKE THE PAIN STOP PLEASE, I WANT THIS SERIES TO END BEFORE I DIE</br></br>  <br>http://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/<br>Reminder that we could be at chapter 700</br></br>  <br>I found it pretty funny when I first saw it but once I got past the fact that he was wearing short shorts and a crop top it was just scary and tragic. <br><br>He went apeshit but I think it had building up in him over a long period of time, so it was less of an explosion and more him consciously choosing to punish himself and end Pitou, and by the end he was just sad at what he had done.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, lower quality chapters though</br>  <br>Do you want to send women to the asylum if they act like a huge bitch on their period?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oo0<wbr>d1zTAFKA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Current hiatus: 44 issues <br> Longest hiatus: 79 issues <br> Longest publication streak: 30 issues <br><br>He couldn't go 30 fucking chapters without taking a break?<br><br>At least according to that maybe he'll release a chapter in 10 or so months.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait I dont remember this, what chapter is this from?</br>  <br>it's the one where he tests his yoyos and hatsu on Gensuru's ally</br>  <br>Well so far we've had at least 2 chapters a year. We can only hope this isn't the year we reach 100% hiatus.<br><br>178.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he was a hypocrite, his patience just reached a breaking point and he decided to be selfish. Imagine if you were a money loaner and you came to collect a debt and the guy told you he won't be able to feed his family if he paid. Maybe you'll do the right thing and give them a break but what if this happened again and again and again? When it happens enough times you're just going to say fuck it it's not my duty to sacrifice myself for the greater good.</br>  <br>That's because nen and ki is almost copypasted from real life concepts of chakra, kundalini, qi, and other such equivalent eastern philosophies in the neighborhood of Hinduism and Buddhism. Characters literally practice yoga/meditation on screen as a nen exercise.<br>Keep in mind I'm not criticizing it, I like the occult and mythologies in my anime, you won't see me complaining about demons in SMT.</br></br>  <br>For me , this scene is probably the best in all shounen.</br>  <br>hes a fucking autist that can draw but draws like shit<br>lazy fuck</br></br>  <br>IIRC Berserk had a 7 month long one while we're about a month away from it being a year.</br>  <br>shut up already you whiny autist</br>  <br>His arms look so weird here.</br>  <br> Bisky <br> Girl </br></br>  <br>Best woman.</br>  <br>y-youcan smile ; ;</br>  <br><br><br>Best girl is Senritsu you mongoloids.</br></br></br>  It's time<br><br>Top 10 girls/women:</br></br>  <br>1/machi<br>2/machi<br>3/machi<br>4/machi<br>5/machi<br>6/machi<br>7/machi<br>8/machi<br>9/machi<br>10/Kurapika</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All that's important is<br> 1.

Oh damn, Feitan's 2011 voice is a huge improvement over his 1999 voice.  <br>He's so moe.</br>  <br>But will we ever see the Dark Continent arc?</br>  <br>He's definitely more of a chink in the '99 version.</br>  <br>Who's death he used in the hunter exam?</br>  <br>I hope so. Really looking forward to pic related too</br>  Why do half of the young boys in this show look like girls?<br><br>Is Togashi a pedo?</br></br>  <br>Kalluto is the only boy that looks like a girl.</br>  <br>Pito too</br>  <br>Please don't start this. Pitou isn't a boy or a girl, so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  How can people claim Gon is inherently good? He never is disturbed by all the deaths happening around him (no empathy). He never chastises Killua for killing people and actually accepts him easily. He is simply a child with childish morals and may seem good (friendly with people) but can't comprehend the difficulties with morality and death in general.  <br>All of the Zoldyks look like girls at one point or another. I'm sure even Silva and Zeno at one point were full trap mode.</br>  <br>Moralfag plz.</br>  <br> What is Alluka <br> What is Kurapika </br></br>    <br>I don't care, I like Gon.

Does Komugi look like a girl, because Killua looks like them.</br></br>    <br>Stop</br>  <br>Girls like Pitou and komugi have pronounced eyelashes unlike togashi's boys, the only exception being kalluto whose specific gimmick is looking like a girl.</br>  I'd love to hear what speculations people have on what the Dark Continent arc will have in store for the characters. Will we see more suffering? How will Gon regain his nen, and will he be a different nen type post Gon-san?<br><br>What nen abilities beyond Jan Ken Pon would suit him?</br></br>  <br>Not disagreeing, but all of the Zoldyck children (barring Alluka for the most part) have noticeable eyelashes. It seems to be a family trait that just happens to play into Kalluto's 'thing'.

I actually found myself smiling more often than frowning.  Though I was crying the whole time. </br>  <br>Yeah. I read that part. I inferred it was going to be used against zombies</br>   next ep preview is more SOL <br>Are they just gonna keep transitioning to grimdark within the last few minutes or will there actually be a focus on reality eventually?</br>  <br>We don't know. The manga is quite different, and the anime already fucked it up by adding Mi-kun right off the bat.</br>  <br> how come the military didn't immediately wipe the floor with them? <br>First of all this is Japan, dense population with low crime rates and minimally armed police force. The SDF has guns but they're not very many and obviously they can't adequately contain a plague when it's presumably popping up all over the country.<br><br>Speaking of which (I'm assuming you haven't read the manga), vaccines are a thing and  they work . So maybe they didn't kill the completely turned zeds until it was too late because there's that misguided hope of "curing" them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll become more and more real as it goes on. Next episode should have  the first zombie kill(s)  for instance.<br><br>Do you think we'll get the library chapter next episode?</br></br></br>  <br>A good portion of the entire manga is actually SoL, even if it doesn't only focus on the delusions of the one character. The anime has fucked around with everything pretty badly already though, so there's no telling which direction it'll take.<br><br>Hopefully as the show progresses the vividness of the delusions will gradually deteriorate each episode until all that is left is Yuki talking to empty space while everybody looks at her worried.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. I just assumed that they were going to use it to kill zombies</br>  <br>If you've read the chapter, you'd know that the (non anime original) scenes are still there. Yuki still acts like it's a moe SoL, so it makes sense for her to do a cutesy next episode preview. As the series progresses and gets more and more suffering, the cutesy stuff will provide more emphasis through juxtaposition. It's like watching the first episode knowing it's all fake and being on edge the whole time.<br><br><br>I've read it, I'm just bad at remembering specific details.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kurumi going to the barricades with her shovel <br> Taroumaru wearing the ghost thingy <br><br>We're getting chapters 2 and 3 next week. People raving about how we're going completely off course are wrong.</br></br></br></br>  I've been reading the manga and the latest development worries me.<br><br> Where the fuck did the imouto come from? Rii is obviously losing her shit to critical levels (in the genuine bad way, not the good Yuki way) so I highly doubt her stability. Also, am I supposed to believe that a loli imouto was able to survive in a zombie infested school safely? Everything is too fucking convenient and happy that I think something is definitely fucking wrong here <br><br><br>They could still do the entry of Mii-kun into the party via flashbacks.<br><br>The reveal about the truth behind Megu-nee can easily be integrated with the introduction of Mii-kun into the club through one of the members reminiscing or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So yeah. Whatever animesalestard keep saying about the preorders of the anime version, the main fact is here:<br><br>7/10 漫画ランキング コミック売上BEST500【ワンピース78】<br>91 9784832242364 がっこうぐらし！　１ 芳文社 海法紀光 2012.12.12<br>116 9784832243095 がっこうぐらし！　２ 芳文社 海法紀光 2013.6.12<br>190 9784832243781 がっこうぐらし！　３ 芳文社 海法紀光 2013.12.12<br>217 9784832244627 がっこうぐらし！　４ 芳文社 海法紀光 2014.7.11<br>227 9784832245389 がっこうぐらし！　５ 芳文社 海法紀光 2015.3.12</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tis but a ruse</br>  <br> It's the teddy bear. </br>  <br>The chopper scene was just her giving up because there were too many</br>  <br>   Where the fuck did the imouto come from?<br/> <br>   Rii is obviously losing her shit to critical levels (in the genuine bad way <br>This question answers itself and I'm sure you've realized that  it's not a real loli. </br></br></br>  <br>Just like I thought, the dog doesn't real.<br><br><br>So what does this mean qualitatively?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest they probably just started out with Mi-kun already there to be able to skip over her arc and get to the more grimdark stuff more expediently, considering the limited timeframe of a single cour. It's understandable, but it doesn't really sit right with me, since her introductory arc is a major aspect of her character. We'll see how the studio handles it.</br>  <br>Sorry chef</br>  <br>And considering that 芳文社 is a part of the production committee - and quite an important part.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127911763 <br>Then go and read the manga.</br>  Just got past mikun back story it's obvious hat the dude got bit but who set him on fire and why did they block out everyone else?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127911763 <br> :( <br>O:</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127911763 <br>The real question is why you haven't already read the manga. This series, by its very nature, is really damn easy to spoil You should probably avoid these threads if you don't want that.</br>  <br><br><br> So she joins the Cray-Cray delusion club? Fuck man, only Yuki can pull that kind of shit off. Rii just looks and sounds loco if she's the one doing it. </br></br></br>  <br>That means that the next day after the first episode people have started purchasing all volumes of the manga and I'm more than sure that it will manage to sell 10x amount of it's previous sales in a week or two.</br>  So the manga won't hiatus after the anime right?<br><br>Because God Damn, I don't know how long HotD has been stuck on the Bangbus</br></br>  Imouto is Beary cute  <br>What's their track record for S2s? I know Kadokawa is a pack of Jews that never gives S2s.</br>  Why won't you love me?  <br>I'm assuming that's a list of the top 500 best-selling manga in Japan and the anime has brought up sales for volumes 1-5.<br><br><br>   Rii just looks and sounds loco if she's the one doing it. <br>That's the idea anon, up till now she was the stable mother of the group but being the oldest isn't always a good thing. It's a wonder that a girl her age lasted this far without cracking completely.<br><br><br> HOTD <br>It's deader than Abraham Lincoln and only "on hiatus" in name. The author is genuinely retarded and he's clearly never going back to it, even if the artist wants to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look a little closer.</br>  <br>Means that manga sales are also very important for the success of the anime/Gakkou Gurashi! as a whole.<br><br>Here are the chief producers of the anime version:<br>Ogura Mitsutoshi (NBC) - anime sales?<br>Kobayashi Hiroyuki (Houbunsha) - manga sales<br>Digitarou (Nitroplus) - dunno</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just her confirming a suspicion. <br>She interacted with  the radio gal  offpanel, and that was when she realized that she's half-invisible to the zombies.</br></br>  <br>My sister has a mustache also, that's not proof of anything.</br>  <br>I honestly wouldn't mind if the serum made them half zombie with super instincts and crap.<br>Its be amusing in a way.</br></br>  <br> That's the idea anon, up till now she was the stable mother of the group but being the oldest isn't always a good thing. It's a wonder that a girl her age lasted this far without cracking completely. <br>Aren't all three of them in the same class? I might have missed it, but I don't think it's ever specified how old Mother Bear is. I just assumed she was as old as the dead one and the acid freak.</br></br>  <br>She's wearing the same clothes she had on during Rii's flashback. What about it?</br>  <br> if the serum made them half zombie with super instincts and crap <br>World War Z sequel when?<br><br><br>I don't quite remember if they were in the same class (not watching the show) but even if they're all the same age, Rii was the most mature and level-headed of the lot</br></br></br></br></br>  What's the exact point where she broke?  <br>Shit, you're right. What if  the author is trying to fool us into thinking she's the bear, but we only realize she's the real imouto when  she dies.  </br>  <br>I want to know how she killed all the zombies in the room.</br>  <br> I still blame Yuki. I realize that she's supposed to be the healer of the group, but goddamn she is the one actively perpetuating the mass delusion. When Rii came out and introduced her Not!Imouto, Mii and Kurumi just stared at her with a "What the fuck is this nigga talking about" expression. Only when Yuki acknowledged Not!Imouto as THE imouto that all of them started playing along. Fucking hell, she was the one who planted that bear in the first place </br>  <br> World War Z <br>Thinking back, GKG is more like that book than that failure of an adaptation was.</br></br>  <br>On the roof top when she flipped at yuki during the heli crash.<br><br><br>Well considering they don't even feed her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet they laid out a plate/bowl thing and spoon for her?</br>  <br> Yuki made it through her shit, so she's decided that letting Rii's delusion play out is better than ripping it apart. </br>  <br> Not!Imouto <br> ! </br></br>  <br>To keep up pretenses I suppose.<br> what do Mii? <br> l-let's play along for now <br> I never played House though </br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you look at her bowl? it had nothing in it while everyone else did.</br>  <br>She didn't, chances are she pulled a Yuki and just grabbed the bear then stood in the room a while, interacted for a bit with what wasn't there then left.</br>  <br>I don't think so, the other characters act too weird around them for that.<br><br>Also pic related from 36,  you can clearly see the bear there. I can't make up if that's Yuki or Miki though </br></br></br>  <br>In every sense of the word, Yuki is still the heroine of the story.<br><br> It's already been implied that she already (or at least partially) recovered from her dementia. Hell, we've seen that when shit hits the fan, she breaks delusion mode and gets things done. She probably keeps up the act because she realized the significance of her act and what it does to keep the group together. <br><br>I honestly won't be surprised if by the end of the story, Yuki is the most stable girl in the team.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read Foucault <br>They really say that? French philosophers are garbage in general.<br><br><br> that shadow on the wall <br> the bear's ear <br>Things like this are what makes the manga a decent horror story in my book. The little details.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this show any good or just a ripoff of Madoka?  <br>The eyes are definitely Yukis.<br>Doesn't look like Miki.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not the bear's ear, it's the imouto's hair ornament thingies you see here </br></br>  <br>It is a deconstruction of the Madoka of the Evangelion.</br>  <br>Less plot machinations, more psychological angst<br><br>Also I don't think the twist in the premise is even relevant to the story. They could've done away with it if they didn't desperately need some sort of hook for it to not get canceled immediately<br><br><br>I was more referring to how there's no way the loli fits in that space and the shadow on the wall. It definitely points at the bear more than anything, besides, when they went into the building Yuki said "I can't hear anything" and they've been hinting at her going mental for a while, so for ~storytelling~ reasons it has to be a delusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shovel-chan is a ticking time bomb. I don't want to say she's going to die for sure but I do think theres two possibilities. Either she turns at the worst possible time or she begins to require another dose of medicine which the group doesn't have.</br>  <br>I don't find it scary, but rather... so sad. These girls are really sisters that are bound to each other through adversity and blood, and the shit that they are willing to put through for each other as they are falling apart really hurts to watch.</br>  <br>It looks too big to be a mini-hair band or whatever you call them, and anyway where's the thin tuft of hair sticking out?</br>  <br> if by the end of the story <br><br>You don't even have to wait that wrong. <br><br> <br> Rii has obviously gone off the deep end <br> Kurumi is slowly becoming half zombie and will either fully turn or go suicidal heroics <br> Mii clearly does not deal with stress and anxiety that well so if something critical happens to the other two, she'll break down via domino effect <br/></br></br></br> <br><br>Yuki is clearly far more sane and stronger than she appears or acts. At the latest point in scanlations, I daresay she's already top dog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, Yuki and Rii were friends/at least known to each other before the apocalypse. Did they know Kurumi at all?  So what if the real premise of this manga is some sort of contagious delusion? Every thirty or forty chapters it will spontaneously jump to another character and the previous host will pretend to still be delusional so as to not upset the fragile emotional status quo. In the end only Kurumi is left, being immune to the delusions as she is already dead, and she ends up killing herself surrounded by emotional vegetables with self-inflicted brain death.  Maybe it's because I've been speed reading but why did they leave the school building after the help crash? Was it just to look for the other two? Also the fuck was up with the pilot  <br> Either she turns at the worst possible time <br> yfw it happens ON-SCREEN </br></br>  <br>Would you keep her hands warm for her?</br>  <br>does it stay mostly cute at least? i don't want 20 minutes of slouched characters with their faces shadowed out, it's got to be mostly cute</br>  <br>why is there always a need to add tweests to everything<br><br><br>Because it's the only way of making progress. You know, besides rotting inside the school forever until there's no supplies left and zombies swarm them or they break from stress.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have the school is a burned mess now, and their barricades and such got fucked up. It was time to go.<br><br>Also, he was infected and keeping himself afloat with the same stuff Kurumi used.</br></br></br>  <br> In the end only Kurumi is left, being immune to the delusions as she is already dead, and she ends up killing herself surrounded by emotional vegetables with self-inflicted brain death <br>I don't like you</br></br>  <br> Have <br>half</br></br>  <br>Everything was burned on the upper floors, including the garden. They did stay for a few months preparing to leave and living on the rations in the basement, but they didn't want to stay in such a place anymore. Moving on, graduating, getting to the next chapter of their lives, and whatnot.</br>  <br>she can do it while rubbing my meat</br>  I thought this would be something like Higurashi. Cute girls on the outside but a really interesting horror and mystery experience. But this looks like a joke.  <br><br>Have you ever wondered why that Helicopter crashed? Exactly.<br><br> The antidote is probably just a temporary cure and not fully effective. The Helicopter guy is definitely a good guy and a Hero, but he is foreshadowing Kurumi's eventual fate. He only lasted that long because he had a stock of antidotes keeping him together, notice how upon seeing the live girls (which probably triggered his zombie hunger), he slowly lost control and struggled to stick the antidote syringe but ended up crushing it (a combination of him slowly losing his sense and the zombie adrenaline strength)<br/> </br></br></br></br>  <br>This is one scene the manga didn't convey so well: the school got burnt into a crisp, which is why they had to evacuate into the safehouse in the first place. The fire also burnt off their rooftop garden (source of food).</br>  <br>It's the deconstruction of the moeshit version of the SnK of the Madoka genre</br>  <br><br>It's not a mystery series, but it's psychological horror. Go read the manga.</br></br>  I really like this series but the biggest issue I have right now is that theres no stress factors other than the zombies. Usually in zombie stories you have some indication of the protagonists getting low on supplies or some sort of rescue operation with a deadline but in this manga we have none of that which has made the whole thing feel off since they left the school. We have no idea what they have packed in the camper and they're just kind of going from place to place while the threat of zombies is diminishing.  <br> They did stay for a few months <br>Holy crap, I thought it was only for a couple days, if not a week or two after the fire. Several months seems like a bit much.</br></br>  <br>I don't care that you don't like me. But you like Kurumi, right? As long as you like Kurumi I'll like you.</br>  <br>It'll probably be fine.  Sensei stayed conscious after turning long enough to get the fuck away. </br>  <br>Its Yuki. You can see her antennae.</br>  <br>No, it's the deconstruction of the YuYuYu of the SnK genre's deconstruction.</br>  <br> this looks like a joke <br>Read the goddamn manga<br><br> b-but reading is for FAGGOTS <br>Fucking burgerfats, read it anyway. It's cute girls surviving a zombie apocalypse and handled well, what more could you want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kurumi is slowly turing into a zombie, and Rii-san is slowly going crazy. Those are the two big stress factors right now.</br></br>  <br>I don't feel like the threat of zombies was ever there outside of when they go into narrow corridors or whatever<br><br>The stress factor is that literally everyone's dead and they don't even know what the fuck to do with their lives, which is why they end up following the manual lead and trying to go into the university and then the corp.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, they said they would spend the next dew months preparing to leave. The next chapter just kind of skipped to graduation so there's no way to know how long they actually took. Also, not sure if it has any bearing, but a little before the fire Mi-kun said they were around halfway through the school year when Yuki said she might have to get herself held back so they could graduate together.</br>  <br> the threat of zombies is diminishing <br>Is it? <br><br>Also they're beginning to see other survivors and not all of them are friendly or even sane, shuffling zombies aren't as scary as desperate crazies zooming around in cars trying to catch the girls for who knows what.</br></br></br></br>  <br>pedophile chapter when?</br>  <br>I don't like the whole "there's other survivor groups" thing. Sure it's realistic and easy for the author to add more characters but I thought the small constant cast was a good point of the manga. I don't like zombie stories with oddles of characters, it makes it too easy for the actor to play out the survival horror cliches without any real consequence or weight.</br>  <br>I've got a big stress factor for you. In my pants.</br>  Something is def wrong with kurumi twice they refer to her hands being cold <br><br>I'm depressed as fuck from reading all the manga tonight I got to read or watch something happy or else I'm not going to fall asleep</br></br>  <br> low on supplies <br>They had the school store, their personal garden and later that basement fallout shelter stacked with supplies.<br><br>It's not played up but they are clearly rationing themselves. For example, Rii makes daily allocations and records to keep track of things. Hell, one of the reasons they moved out was because the school was slowly becoming not the best place to live.<br><br> some sort of rescue operation <br>There was, and that hope got shot down real quick<br><br> other than the zombies <br>The zombies aren't really the real threat here. The focus of the manga is more on the girl's slowly whittling sanity rather than the zombies. <br><br>On the zombie horror scale, the zombies in GK are at the absolute lowest tier; essentially brainless other than their most primal desires, no augmented super mutations, easily manipulated by sound and fucking hell, they can easily be subdued by a middleschooler armed with a goddamn shovel. Hell, even the dumb as bricks Yuki takes one out with a fucking mop at one point. As long as they aren't in bulk, the zombies are hardly a threat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it makes it too easy for the actor to play out the survival horror cliches without any real consequence or weight <br>Let's give the author a chance, they've only just met the sex trio. One thing that's foreseeable though is the other survivors freaking out when they learn Shovel was infected and serum-dependent.</br></br>  <br>See <br>The zombies are just part of the setting, and not necessarily integral to the story. It didn't have to be zombies, but they are convenient and easily recognizable, requiring little extra characterization. The stress comes from the isolation and the lack of any knowledge about what the fuck is going on, as well as the emotional problems that the girls don't share with each other even though they suspect.</br></br>  <br>The loss of their clubroom was crippling for Rii. That girl's been hanging on only by a thread even when they lived at the school. Do you remember how furious she was with Rii when Rii bluntly questioned why the group allowed Yuki to be bathed in her own delusion.<br><br>Come to think of it, I think that Yuki accepted the fact that she had to graduate and that's how she has stepped up to be the emotional pillar of the group. She's accepted Megu-nee's death and with it, all the responsibilities that go with living yet another day.</br></br></br>  <br> they can easily be subdued by a middleschooler armed with a goddamn shovel <br> shovel <br>Shovels are good weapons m8</br></br></br>  <br>Although I do agree with what you're saying, we've been stuck with four (realistically) character I wouldn't mind an additional 3 or so characters [spoilers]they might all be zombie food in the future though[/spoiler]</br>  <br> survival group internal politics <br> that on who knows more than they let on <br> zombie swarm <br> fodder dying <br> actual infested person getting the rest in trouble, token friend going mad over killing them <br>blegh. I hope the 3 new girls are just 3 and they won't settle with a larger group or anything and just keep doing the same stuff focused on how they're all going mad</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Rii scares them off with a fire extinguisher. The zombies are nothing. These new survivors are trouble though.</br>  <br> they can easily be subdued by a middleschooler <br>They're high schoolers, and legal adults at this point.</br></br>  <br>I hope that you start using something called punctuation marks. I'd go mad faster than those girls if I have to suffer your concatenation.</br>  <br><br> middleschooler <br>Wait, aren't they in high school, what with all the talk of college and the workforce? I'm confused now.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the proper way to write at 4 am</br>  <br>I've seeing too much of survivor politics lately</br>  <br>High schoolers yes.</br>  <br><br><br> mfw I thought they were 12 but they're actually all legal <br>BRAVO JAPAN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but Kurumi is a fucking teenage girl with a small build, so unless she was taking steroids, she obviously won't be able to use it to it's max effectiveness.<br><br>And yet even with her build, she can take out zombies easily with it. It just goes to show that the zombies in GK aren't exactly what you call the sturdy and difficult type to deal with.<br><br> Even her getting bit by Megu-nee was just a result of psychological stress rather than her lack of ability to face her. Mii-kun, someone who is outright shown to be physically inferior to Kurumi was able to deal with Zombie-nee without much problems <br><br>tl;dr, GK zombies are easymodo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is that doesn't exactly make sense. If he has a helicopter and a stock of them that implies that he not only belongs to an important group of people but also would not need to be careful about his use of the antidote unless theres some unmentioned consequence of overusing it and I doubt the author has thought far aheas. <br><br>Plus is being around humans triggers the zombie relapse Shovel-chan shouls have already relapsed since shes been half dead and walking around with her friends for days with no negative mental and physical consequences beyond being cold like a corpse.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fondle Yuki's lolibutt</br>  <br> And yet even with her build, she can take out zombies easily with it. It just goes to show that the zombies in GK aren't exactly what you call the sturdy and difficult type to deal with. <br>Keep in mind that zombies are only as physically strong as they were in life, and most zombies in the story thus far (if I remember right) were scrawny students. Also they've been in the school for months so maybe some zeds are going grody. Japan is hot and humid so I imagine they'd decompose faster than, say, zombies in America or Europe.</br></br>  <br> easymodo <br><br>This is the land of the fuckin' rising sun, not the land of freedom. Do you honestly expect survivors to pack loads of machismo and have unparalleled candor as they tear rotting carcasses asunder with axes and chainsaws? <br><br>If Left4Dead featured these four girls, then it'd be even more impossible than Ninja Gaiden 2.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That shouldn't change how you think of them.</br>  <br>He could have been infected for much longer, and the antidotes effect became less effective over time and repeated usage.</br>  <br>I want to make shovel my bride<br><br><br>I can't wait till the mystery of pilot-kun will be solved (if it will ever be). The base where he came from could be another possible setting.</br></br></br></br>  Is showel gonna die? I don't want to suffer.  <br>Everyone but Yuki might die in the anime</br>  <br>Best boy Mii-kun isn't</br>  <br>I wonder if the virus can transmit in the air. I don't know if the pilot was fully secured from exposure given that he had that paper and all.</br>  <br>Honestly speaking though, Zombies aren't a real threat. As long as they aren't Resident Evil style SUPER MAD SCIENCE MUTATIONS, Zombies are a Joke. You don't need to be a MACHO MURRICAN to deal with them. Most Zombies will probably end up as walking wet tissue paper rolls.<br><br>Rigormortis would've rendered Zombies into stiff shambling messes in just a few days, so unless you dangle your hand in front of them, they wouldn't be a thread. Not to mention how weather conditions and natural decomposing processes will make the zombies practically non-functional in a few weeks tops.<br><br>Now, an army of reanimated through necromancy Spooky Skeletons on the other hand, THAT is something to be scared of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kurumi will never be a bride <br> even if she never turns, there are no living boys to waifu her </br></br>  <br>I don't want to see cute grils dying.</br>  <br> Rigormortis <br> applying to zombies <br>That's not how it works.</br></br></br>  They fucked up big time throwing the gun off the roof they are a bunch of high school girls sooner or later they will encounter another group of survivors who will try to rape and emslave them  <br>But anon, what if they're already dead?</br>  <br>Zombies are among the most physics and biology defying sci-fi concept I can think of</br>  <br>What if they are the zombies and everyone else is normal!?!?!?</br>  <br>Anon that might be the dumbest thing I've read in these threads yet.</br>  <br> That's not how it works. <br>Zombies aren't supposed to work in the first place Sherlock.<br><br>Zombies are moving corpses. Corpses undergo Rigormortis.<br><br>But fine, let's call GK "Zombies" as "infected" and not the classic definition of Zombies as "Reanimated Corpses" so the rules may not apply to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> GK <br>Stop that.</br></br></br></br></br>   manga ends <br> last scene is Shovel (the sole survivor) staggering along a deserted highway with dead-looking eyes <br> she coughs and doubles over, spasms wrack her body, vision fades to black <br> suddenly she finds herself in school, everyone is fine, the teacher and her other classmates are fine, the bell rings and they all run outside shouting and laughing <br> Shovel is lying face down on the road and in a coma, dreaming of the past <br> end </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this GK show you keep talking about?</br>  <br> implying there are any survivors   other than radio </br>  <br>That seems to be the reason for  radio-chan turning , and why the  military guys wear air filtration systems.  <br><br><br>Welcome to suffering! Hope you enjoy Mr. Zed's wild ride!</br></br></br></br>  <br> (the sole survivor) <br> already infected <br> suicide flags out of her cute butt <br> only one that actively fights monsters <br>Remember anon, he who fights monsters might take care lest he himself becomes a monster.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck happened to radio girl? Did she get bit and then continued on before killing herself or was she just too depressed to keep on?</br>  <br> everyone turns into zombie <br> happy school life scene <br> okaeri <br> tadaima <br> end </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There haven't been any suicide flags at all</br>  <br>The former.  At least, she tried to kill herself but left a note warning others not to open to the closet in case she failed. </br>  <br>She turned. Shovel had to kill her in the back room. And since she lived in one of the bunkers, same theory about the antidotes not fully curing someone can apply to her as well.</br>  <br>Bit before she got into the bunker, then locked herself in the closet when the medicine  no longer worked. <br><br>She wasn't depressed, given the note she left, and she still had several boxes full of supplies and medicine to use, so she wasn't without necessities.</br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi doesn't have a cute butt.</br>  <br>Shovels butt's adorable.</br>  <br> tfw shovel won't survive this manga </br>  <br>Right that's what I figured too but iirc the girls never ran into any zombies in her bunker plus her bunker looked secure as fuck</br>  <br> implies she'd use the gun if she turned into a zombie, considering the fact that none of them have any training with firearms whatsoever <br> body cold <br> zombies ignore her <br> helicopter pilot and radio-chan and their usage of the medicine </br></br></br></br>  I get what they are trying to do but did they have to make the SoL parts so boring? I only watched it because when I looked for some info for the show the genres were horror and SoL so that picked up my attention.<br>God, even stuff like Madoka was actually entertaining to watch even before the twist.</br>  <br>She was bit, but for some reason, turned alot slower than usual. (That or she had some antidotes on hand.)<br><br>You can hear her cough during her broadcasts which indicates that something was going wrong with her. And the fact that she made a last will that indicated: <br><br> "I'll try to end it myself, but I'm not sure if I will be successful" <br><br>Means that she knows shes fucked. She probably locked herself in the closet to hang herself but the Zombie in her was too stronk and it probably didn't kill her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The thing is thats way too far a jump of assumptions since we barely know how the medicine works or exactly what it does other than seemingly fix the problem. The real question is how it's going to be addressed by the rest of the group because it can't be hidden for long. Like I said, I doubt the author has thought that far ahead. Plus we haven't seen any negative symptoms in Shovel-chan. Frankly I'm somewhat worried that she's just going to drop dead and not even come back as a zombie. That could've been what happened to the pilot.</br>  <br> Madoka was actually entertaining to watch even before the twist <br>I hope you're joking.</br></br>  <br>Anon what the fuck, that's way too lewd.</br>  <br>Mii-kun disagrees.</br>  <br>Thats the point, the SoL (delusions) was there to be mundane as possible to indicate the quaint, normal and peaceful lives that they will never get back.<br><br>Their SoL facade is literally the only thing keeping them sane. <br><br>When they leave the school, their sanity levels are far less stable when they were at school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats what a lot people are saying and what the original impression was. Chasing the dog served no purpose other than to show us the school through Yuki's eyes but the thing is we have the potential to see that throughout the course of the show and also its really not all the important in the grand scheme of things.</br>  How far into the plot do you think the anime will get to <br><br>Graduation? They already speed things up with mi kin already being part of the gang</br></br>  <br>Normally I'd agree but the thing is none of them are mentally stable or in normal circumstances. Yuki is delusional, Miki has a history of quickly sinking into depression, Yuuri is suicidal and starting to hallucinate, and Kurumi is half dead. The chances of something bad happening with the gun before a conflict with another group are fair and the chances of something happening after and great considering the additional possibility of a causality or despair.</br>  <br>All that just leads to the fact that she is at risk of turning back but I don't think that means she's going to kill herself doe</br>  Can someone translate this?  <br>We might get an original ending that isnt suffering.</br>  <br> can't fucking read a simple hirigana from watching anime <br>How pleb are you?</br></br>  <br>I love you all from the bottom of my heart.</br>   AH, I WANNA TASTE A DICK!~   <br>Same as the anime when she says she loves everyone.</br>  <br> radio-chan and their usage of the medicine <br>How do we know radio-chan was using the medicine?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127911763 <br> :( <br><br>t(-_-)t</br></br></br>  <br> Thats the point, the SoL (delusions) was there to be mundane as possible to indicate the quaint, normal and peaceful lives that they will never get back. <br>I know, but when I watch regular SoL shows they aren't as boring as this. It's usually, you know, fun. Even if I didn't know there was a twist coming I expected to be entertained. I think the few minutes during breakfast were the best parts of the entire SoL side.<br><br>Showing the school was definitely important. When they show the desks again at the stairs was such an "Oh shit" moment, legitimately smart. But man, even when I thought the puppy was cute, the whole episode was dull.<br><br>Just my opinion though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only understand those two characters in the middle: big good because those are Chinese characters I can't read those curvy Japanese ones</br>  <br> actually being able to read moon runes </br>  <br> zombie-fucking CG set (Gakkou Gurashi edition) by AlanSmithee never </br>  <br>It's just a theory that many have since she killed herself because she knew she was turning but she had been in a secure bunker for awhile doing radio so no chance she got bit recently</br>  <br> nitroplus <br>you are already doom</br></br>  <br>daisuki must be the most pleb level kanji vocab you can get in japanese</br>  <br>Or she's at no risk of turning back, since she was injected with a massive dose of the medicine right at the point of her turning, which made her into a stable hybrid. Remember, it's been months since she got dosed. The real danger to her is psychological. Just like a certain other zombie tomboy we all know and  hate .</br>  <br>She tasted something alright. Probably not the cock she was earning for though.</br>  <br>I'd rather have a manga ending that isn't suffering and anime ending where they all get bitten and spend their last moment as humans cuddling close in the club room reminiscing about the good before they finally lose it and fall into zombie-dom.  Then an OVA where they're all zombies and continuing club activities while the school somehow returns to vaguely normal except everyone is now undead and shambling around </br>  <br> The thing is thats way too far a jump of assumptions <br>No its not. We know it didn't completely cure shovel, and radio didn't last forever either despite have a full bunker reserve to herself. And chopper was clearly trying to get an injection for himself, one that he had at the ready none the less, until his zombie spasms fucked him over.<br> Plus we haven't seen any negative symptoms in Shovel-chan. <br>Are you serious? Its mentioned that she's cold for a reason, and the fucking zombies ignored her very presence.<br> Like I said, I doubt the author has thought that far ahead. <br>And I think you're giving the author very little credit when its clear that they're building up to something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not trying to learn Japanese though I'm just Chinese and can read Chinese</br>  <br> Showing the school was definitely important. When they show the desks again at the stairs was such an "Oh shit" moment, legitimately smart. But man, even when I thought the puppy was cute, the whole episode was dull. <br> Just my opinion though. <br>I agree, I just think they could've reached the same effect but in a much shorter period of time. The thing was the SoL part was really hard to watch and I'm usually a fan of moeblob anime.</br></br></br>  <br>sorry, I read that wrong</br>  <br>So what is the psychological threat that she's depressed that she's turned into thus half zombie thing or just the situation itsel?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Why does Yuki have a different uniform?  <br> No its not. We know it didn't completely cure shovel, and radio didn't last forever either despite have a full bunker reserve to herself. And chopper was clearly trying to get an injection for himself, one that he had at the ready none the less, until his zombie spasms fucked him over. <br>Fair enough, I kind of forgot about Radio-chan so I guess the possibility of her lapsing is greater.<br> Are you serious? Its mentioned that she's cold for a reason, and the fucking zombies ignored her very presence. <br>Thats not exactly "negative" other than the fact its fucking scarey because shes dead or close to it. I'd be more concerned if she started to space out or have insanity surfacing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shes the oldest I believe.</br>  <br> I doubt the author has thought that far ahead <br>if there is ONE thing we can give to Nitro+ writers is that they plan out their plot mechanics fairly carefully, so I wouldn't assume that so quickly</br></br>  <br><br>There is no explainable reason. Miki is the only one in a different year group and she has the same uniform as Rii and Kurumi.</br></br>  <br>I'm hope that the ending will be at least somewhat happy, since the theme of the story is to never give up. Then again, Japanese writers like being total fucking dicks about endings.</br>  <br>MODS</br>  Is this show gonna be a thing now? That first episode was grimdark in such a laughable way I thought /a/ would be angry    <br> grimdark </br>  <br>I don't know what you're talking about, silly! It's a lighthearted romp!</br>  Rize is best girl  <br>That's Aya.</br>  i read the manga last night. i loved it  <br>same here</br>  <br><br> yfw no translations for at least a month, maybe more </br></br>  <br>There would be translations in no time if we had raws.</br>  <br>I need my suffering and mental breakdown fix.</br>  <br>We have korean translations, at least</br>  <br>At least try.</br>  <br>the wait is going to kill me</br>  <br>That's good news.<br><br><br> It's deader than Abraham Lincoln and only "on hiatus" in name. The author is genuinely retarded and he's clearly never going back to it, even if the artist wants to. <br>It's really a shame because I was honestly interested in seeing where it would go.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> only a month <br>Be patient.</br></br>  <br> Range <br> Tank <br> Mage DPS <br><br>The RPG party is coming together</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shovel &gt; Rize &gt; Aya</br>  Other than Shovel-chan's shovel and Yuki's bat does the group have any other weapons? Since it's kinda been confirmed they won't be touching guns do you guys think their self defense situation will become a plot issue?  <br>That's why she's going to waifu all the girls.</br>  <br>Shovel&gt;Aya&gt;Ryze</br>  <br>They still have the glow sticks</br>  <br>That's a stuffed animal, anon.</br>  <br>Yeah but that doesn't really serve much more than a temporary solution. They going to new territories and when they first sectioned off the school they had Shovel-chan to fight and Megu-nee to direct and help. The thing is its looking grim for Shovel-chan and since she has the shovel with her at all times nobody else is going to be getting their hands on if it she turns while holding onto it.</br>  <br>They may eventually come around to other weapons eventually, just not yet. It seems Shovel well might have kept the pilot's pistol if Miki didn't chuck it. <br><br>It seems however that distracting the zombies enough to run is a more sensible strategy anyway, as standing your ground to just fight through all the zombies if they swarmed would guaranteed lead you to being eventually overwhelmed and bitten, short of having a minigun with infinite ammo.</br></br></br>  I assume things are looking grim for everybody. I kinda assume everyone is going to die before the end. Yuki being last of course.  <br>What about Miki?</br>   tfw animeonlyfag who was expecting pure SoL <br>That twist got me real good. Still going to watch though. Just a question, is the teacher actually there or just part of pink's imagination? Same question for the people in the agriculture club</br>  <br>Do you want to be spoiled?<br><br> Both are delusions. </br></br></br>  <br>Pay attention to the scene where the teacher appeared in front of the girls.</br>  <br>Yes I wanted to be spoiled on those parts. Before the show started airing some anon said I shouldn't read up anything on the plot, glad I did that. I imagine the SoL delusions will still be present each episode</br>    <br>Exact next scene.</br>  NIGGA  <br>Yea I just checked out a few sections again, you see a similar thing when pink is talking to the teacher. Probably a slow I'll rewatch each week as it has quite a lot of subtleties</br>  das sum depressing ass shit  <br>Forgot to mention, it also explains why white didn't care about shouting so loud into the classroom.</br>  So /a/ hates everything  <br> hate <br> everyone is discussing the anime <br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>the fuck?</br>  I hope it stays more survival oriented then finding survivors like walking dead. Since walking dead had stupid fucking drama from the survivors that causes the zombies to kill them and end up finding another group of survivors repeating it over.  <br>The walking dead becomes a lot more interesting when you start rooting for the zombies.</br>  Remidner that hatless Yuki is a fucking sex goddess.  <br>pretty much this everyone became unlikable at certain point.</br>  <br> rooting for teleporting shits <br><br>It's just not fair.</br></br></br>  <br> She's slowly developing into Rick Grimes </br>  <br>TWD does exist in their universe...</br>  <br>TWD a shit. I dropped it after like 3 episodes in S1</br>  <br>How did I not see that.</br>    <br>She went against what Megu-nee said and killed her in the process</br>  <br>Non-cray Yuki is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br> no shovel <br><br>What is this bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> no shovel in some striped pantsu <br><br>I'm disappointed.</br></br></br>  <br>I know its a long shot but does anyone think these are gonna be like Walking Dead Zombies? I know they're showing signs to be a lot more like early RE zombies but we haven't actually seen a character thats died from non zombie causes yet except for the teacher that killed himself via hanging which wouldn't count since it breaks the neck thus separating the head from the rest of the body.</br>  <br>Who do you think took the photo?<br>It's in her special stash.</br></br>  <br><br>Add Lucchini.</br></br>  <br>I just want more shovel.</br>  <br>This looks like something that's a lot better in the manga.</br>  <br>Megu took the picture, obviously.</br>  <br><br>I'd play the fuck out of that</br></br>  <br>Dead people cant use cameras.</br>  <br>Have you seen a zombie not use a camera? Then you can't say they can't.</br>  <br>I really don't think its possible to see something that doesn't happen.</br>  <br>I sincerely believe that TWD fans have some sort of pattern blindness for quality. How can a person keep watching that show without losing their mind over how shit it all is?</br>  <br>It was fine for the start of the show but it got crazy stupid and all the characters became unlikable cunts. Now they are milking the show for whatever its worth even if it leaves a shit taste in your mouth</br>  <br>It's getting harder to tolerate with each season, but I'm still interested in what happens next. And sometimes, annoying characters actually die, like this insufferable moeblobb cunt.</br>  <br>I just keep watching it to laugh.<br>Sometimes, like 2 or 3 times a season, the show actually gets good for one scene.</br></br>  <br>can dead people kaio-ken?</br>  <br>That was from dragonball right?<br>I'd day so, goku died like 4 times.</br></br>  <br>We will see how the anime sales go. First episode didn't really set any major points of how the story will progress, but went for the shock value to peak interest.<br><br>But with manga sales boosted that hard, it was already worth it.</br></br></br>    <br>Is this manga even popular at all?<br><br>The reveal must've hit the Japanese harder than us.</br></br></br>  <br>It's never ranked in sales before, so no.</br>  <br>how is this a suicide flag?</br>  <br>Daijoubu</br>  <br>It's closer to a death flag.</br>  <br> never got to see Yuki go ham on her own <br>I was disappointed but the reunion made up for it</br></br>  <br>She's found a gun and says that using it will be pointless since you can only get headshots on zombies. However, Shovel says that she'd use it for 'something else'.<br><br>In that panel, she's basically saying ''I know I'm dead but we can't be too cautious about it. We just have to make sure I don't turn and prepare for it''.</br></br></br>  <br>I like you a fucking lot, bros.<br><br>Or something like that.</br></br></br>    Why is she everyone's bestgirl?  <br>best girl is  though</br>  <br>I prefer Yuki, especially when she gets her shit together</br>  <br>Because she looks like ayaslut and acts like ayaslut</br>  <br>Your taste is  not the same as mine since I like Miki more, but I respect it. </br>  <br>Unexpectedly hot.

Sure it was a little dragged out and Mii-kun is already there, but I liked the subtle hints sprinkled throughout the episode like the broken windows.  So, I'm reading the manga.<br>This is sad as fuck.<br>If the anime is even half as good as this, it's my aots for sure.</br></br>  Kei ;_;   mfw Kinmosabros in Japan were saying it will be their new 'refugee camp' <br> except it's the Auschwitz of SOL </br>  <br>After 30+ chapters of it's-hopeless-no-wait-they're-okay,<wbr> I doubt it.</wbr></br>  <br>How would someone learn hiragana just from watching anime?</br>  <br>In case anyone doesn't know about the character page yet.<br><br>So, how is Kei going to be fit in? Part of me hopes she gets a different role, though I doubt it'll be less depressing.</br></br></br>  <br>The lingering feeling is always there. You never know when it will happen. It's even more intense because the author isn't freely killing characters so you are attached to them way more.</br>  <br>It's been the kind of story that relies on making you think that anything could happen, but without it actually ever happening.</br>  <br>They can't be. You turn when alive, which is how Kurumi was able to come back with medicine.</br>  <br>Fuck off. She does not look like Aya, Rize, or Kurumi.<br><br><br> peak interest <br>Pique.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit<br>Will Miki start hallucinating too?</br></br>  <br>Maybe kanji from reading manga.</br>  <br>Again, if all you're reading is translated stuff, how could you pick up on it? The only time I could think of anything like this happening would be titles where you can hear what they sound like. Like hearing "non non" in non non biyori and reading のんのん, but you can't learn an entire "alphabet" like this, and certainly no kanji.</br>  <br><br>Fuck you, she looks as much like them as they look similar to each other.<br> Do you hate her, or Strike Witches? </br></br></br>  <br>Her hair is fucking green and her twintails are too short.</br>  <br>What is furigana.</br>  <br>Yeah, a girl with bear eat shaped hair pins and a mustache shaped l shaped ribbon thing on her uniform. I wonder what matches that description of (along with the looks they have about her and what is seen in the raws).</br>  <br> day night <br>So when does it switch between the two states? I've only seen the day version.</br></br>  <br>Not present unless you're reading manga raws, at which point you're making a specific effort to learn Nip, and that's not what this conversation is about.</br>   happy SoL <br> cool <br> zombies plot twist bs at the last minute <br> nitro+ <br> urobutcher <br><br>Dropped, fucking Japan.<br> happy SoL <br> cool <br> zombies plot twist bs at the last minute <br> nitro+ <br> urobutcher <br><br>Dropped, fucking Japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So where did you copy and paste this bait from?</br>  <br> fucking green <br>You already have blue and purple there, so what? Dark green, dark blue, and dark purple all count as black anyway, stupid.<br><br> twintails are too short <br>Now you're just being arbitrary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How blind are you to not see that Rize, Ayaya, and Kurumi all have very similar character designs while your strike witches girl doesn't? You're literally the only person who has said she looks like the other three. Why not just include all twintailed characters ever then?</br>  <br><br>See </br></br>  <br>Anon, jesus christ stop that.<br>Its way too lewd.</br></br>  Am I the only one who wants to have a handjob from shovel?  <br>Shovels don't have hands.</br>  <br>I'd shovel her butt if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I'd rather get one from a spade.</br>  <br>I'd rather shovel Shovels trench, if you know what i mean.<br><br><br>Of course not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a spade, not a bloody shovel.</br>  Fuck. This got to me.  <br>I wanna be that pillow ;_;</br>  <br>Do you think she masturbated a little before returning to the car?</br>  <br>I self-insert as the shovel.</br>  I think the dog has already been bitten in the anime and they are keeping him until it becomes a zombie completely, that's why they decided to keep him in a leash.  <br>You poor lonely anon.</br>  <br>So, dog got bitten while he was running away.</br>  <br>a spade is a shovel<br><br> wanting to spade kurumi  <br>guess she won't be around long enough to have kids anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> kids <br>I doubt that'd would work since she's already infected.</br></br>  <br><br>Stop this anons ;_;<br>Our five kids will be perfectly healthy!</br></br></br>  What the fuck is going on in this show?<br>how many students are actually in the school and how many are her imagination?<br>Do they even have class or was it just the two of them sitting in an empty room?</br></br>  <br>the morning after scene, nice</br>  <br> mfw contributed to the boost <br>Feels good man</br></br>  <br>the students are really there<br><br>its everyone else BUT yuki that has gone insane</br></br></br>  <br>Either wait and see, look for spoilers, or read the manga</br>  <br>There are four students alive. She was sitting in an empty class the whole time.</br>  <br> Yuki is craycray, everyone is dead but her, Shovel-chan, Rii-san, and Mii-kun. I'm not sure about Toromaru, in the manga he was long dead at this point, but it seemed like he was alive enough, as they were all chasing after him. </br>  <br> Animeonly fags <br>Sure is summer....</br></br>  <br>Are the teachers dead?<br>Why did the other girl get embarrassed when Yuki kept opening the classroom doors to look for the dog?<br>She said "they're in the middle of class!" but were those empty rooms? Was she only acting embarrassed to play along with her delusions?</br></br></br>  <br>Read the fucking manga.<br><br><br> ellipsis <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and you answered your own question.</br>  <br>I've been lurking here for 16 hours a day for 7 years kid. Feel like you fit in yet?</br>  <br>I guess now's the time to stop posting and read the fucking manga</br>     getting incredibly sad and creeped out by your PTSD-riddled broken sempai who is living in an absolutely deranged fantasy world   <br>And so for you to stop forcing people to read the manga</br>  <br>I don't really like manga.<br>Ironic because I run a scanlation group and typeset.</br></br>  <br>What group?</br>  <br>Go away, Norway.</br>    <br>The group that is doing Ika Musume right now.</br>  Reminder.  <br>Miki never actually saw Taroumaru.<br>By the time she joined them he was long gone.</br></br>  <br>So the basement guy already is with them in a parallel world?</br>  <br>He's in Gensokyo</br>  <br><br>Can you even imagine?<br>Killing yourself before finishing this show.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At its heart it's still a SoL about cute girls, just imported into a setting that doesn't easily support that sort of thing. A good portion is still reading about the internal daily struggles of high school girls, but instead of wondering whether to buy that guitar she can't play or whether to study or go out for ice cream, they think about how to maintain their own sanity and how much of their psychology they're willing to share with their friends. The way the author presents it allows it to still perfectly fit the definition of "cute girls doing cute things," even if the things they do wouldn't normally be considered cute.<br><br> Please don't die, Kurumi. </br></br></br></br>  <br>the principal missed out on a great loli harem</br>  <br>No, they'll all have cold hands and be terminally  cute .</br>  <br>But that's the correct way to do it, while they're still alive in your mind.</br>  This man now writes Gakkou Gurashi<br><br>What happens?</br></br>    <br>Healing.</br>  <br>Main girls actually die one by one.</br>  <br>I don't watch it.</br>  <br>Yuki wishes to the bear for zombies to not exist and she turns into god, while Kurumi becomes satan and pisses off half of the fanbase.</br>  <br>People spend the threads arguing about which girl wants to fuck which other girl instead of actually talking about the show.</br>  <br>Shovel did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Pretty sure we talked about everything that could be talked about<br>Go translate the korean manga so we can discuss more</br></br>  <br>The manga quality drops by 500%.</br>  <br>She let Megu-nee bite her.</br>  <br>the zombies are actually humans</br>  We all know shovel-chan is dead, but will walnut-kun survive?  <br>Who the fuck is walnut.</br>  <br>The threads will start their decline from about this point. I'd say we can keep quality discussion for about one or two more weeks.</br>  <br>Of course, he and Miki will be the ones that will kill her.<br><br><br>Shovel's shovel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When the hell was it decided to call the shovel walnut?</br>  So if anyone's interested to hear, I just got back from wandering around Akihabara for a few hours, and was surprised to see that Gakkou Gurashi was probably about the second most heavily advertised series there. Huge billboard ad right in the center facing the main intersection, those little flag ads that hang from streetlights all up and down the main road, caught the PV playing on the main monitor overlooking the plaza, etc. Looks like the producers are really pushing this show big time.  <br>It wasn't, but it was proposed in one thread before and I happened to remember it.</br>  Just finished watching it, man that was awful. It was manipulative bullshit, but not in a particularly clever or interesting way.<br><br>It's disappointing too, it looked pretty interesting going in.</br></br>  <br>grab us some raws  ;_; </br>  <br>Oh, and sorry I didn't take any pictures to share. I may go back tomorrow though (sunday's the day they shut down the main road and all the cosplayers gather), and if I do I'll definitely take pictures.</br>  <br>I wish I had infinite funds and lived near Akiba.</br>  <br>I'd try, but I have no experience in scanning raws and, more importantly, no machine to do it with. That's assuming I could find them, my moonspeak is kinda weak.</br>  <br>It's ok anon I was just half joking  enjoy your trip </br>  <br>I see, because i proposed the question on what to call the shovel yesterday. And we never really came to an agreement so i was wondering when the hell that happened.</br>  <br> manipulative bullshit <br><br>There's hints and foreshadowing all over the place and most of it isn't really subtle at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We haven't talked about how since she was just pretending the whole time Yuki never actually loved Kurumi.</br></br>  <br>I always watch SoL shows before I go to sleep. Watched the first episode of this in that timeslot, then realised how much I'd fucked up</br>    <br>It's actually a good SoL though, just not a good high school SoL. At least, the manga is. How the anime will turn out remains to be seen,</br>  <br>Everyone loves Shovel!<br>Especially Yuki!<br><br> tfw you'll never nibble on shovels thigh </br></br></br></br>  <br>Somebody more skilled than me should make a version where the zombie world is around the noose, with the inside of it still the same</br>    <br> SoL <br> zombies infestation <br>Yeah no</br></br></br>  <br>It's zombie apocalypse SoL.</br>  <br>Just because it doesn't have the typical setting doesn't mean it's not about the girls' daily life</br>  <br>Do you like this one?</br>  <br>What do you think "SoL" stands for? "Schoolgirls' Ordinary Life"?<br><br> Because even then, it still fits the definition. </br></br></br>  <br>Work on the masking or find a background with more green.</br>  <br>Is there anything that shows the exact same shot, but from both delusion and reality? Sort of a comparison or something? Would be best to use that if possible.</br>    <br><br><br>Zombies aren't slice of life. SoL is about everyday experiences</br></br></br>  <br>learn to photoshop</br>  <br>pls I just made a quick color range<br>here's a better one</br></br>    <br>better, but you should make some color adjustment to make the green into red in the noose layer</br>  <br>It's everyday life for these girls. It's a show about them not just trying to survive, but trying to both cope and make the most of the situation they're in.</br>  AOTY  <br> everyday experiences <br>Whose everyday experiences? Yours? Mine Those of people in real life? Most SoLs that are interesting are interesting because they showcase the everyday life of characters in uncommon or fantastical situations. By your definition, most of the good SoLs aren't SoLs, because of their unrealistic settings or scenarios.</br></br>  <br><br>Hm, point taken I guess. It's not a bad show by any definition, just not what I was expecting. I prefer my SoL to be comfy cute girls though</br></br>    <br>The Walking Dead: The Anime<br><br> hoping the part where she says "We are the Gakkou Gurashi" </br></br></br>    <br><br>Can you post the original image?</br></br>   Please don't throw me away.   <br>gr8 b8 m8</br>  <br> What the fuck is going on in this show? <br>Zombie apocalypse. 4 girls are holding their ground in a destroyed school.<br> how many students are actually in the school <br>Everyone is dead apart from the 4 main girls<br> how many are her imagination <br>Everyone apart from the 4 main girls.<br> Do they even have class  <br>Nope, she is just pretending.<br> was it just the two of them sitting in an empty room? <br>Yes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only 7 years <br>you'll never fit in</br></br>  <br>If they're stuck in the school how do they get food?</br>  Sorry about that, wrong pic  <br>Scavenging from stores/the bunker in the basement which has food.<br><br>They stay at the school but it doesn't mean they can't move around town.</br></br></br>  <br>Aww, look at that! They're all alive. Even Taroumaru, and we thought he would die because he's a dog in a zombie apocalypse!  Ruu-chan's there too! </br>  <br>I'm wondering if they're going to have a flashback episode of Miki's arc since they show her friend in the OP.</br>  <br>How can they move around with the zombies? Also that store food is probably all looted or rotten</br>  <br>What do you mean when you call someone brain dead?<br>How dead is a zombie's brain?<br><br><br>She's still alive and they'll save her instead of Miki or,<br>Miki will start hallucinating about her.<br>The OP is part of the dream after all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are not stuck, it's their base, they fortified it so it's easier to hold. They grow stuff on the roof as well as they do periodic trips to other parts of the city (they have a functional car) to pick up whatever is available.</br>  <br>Wait, we actually have a bear with a moustache in key visual. Does this mean we get to this point somehow?</br>  <br>The bear was there all along.</br>  This was very heartwarming. I hope that there will be more chapters with a bit of a lighter tone, like this one.  <br> How can they move around with the zombies? <br>They have a car, pluse Kurumi is pretty good in QCQ, hence her shovel<br> Also that store food is probably all looted or rotten <br>The zombie apocalypse didn't happen that long ago, so some of the stuff is still eatable.<br> looted <br>It seems that at least in their area there are very few survivors.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> damaged clothes/tights </br>  <br> qcq <br>quarters close qoqk<br>i always new she was a slut</br></br></br>  <br> in QCQ </br>  <br> lighter tone <br>Mii-kun realizing that Kurumi may be done for isn't really what I'd call a 'light tone'.</br></br>  <br>God damn, Kurumi is manly.<br>She'd look good in a tux.</br></br>  so anybody here checked the changes on official website at night(japanese time)?<br>is that potential spoiler or what?</br>  <br>At least Megu-nee can now enjoy her meal</br>  <br> QCQ <br>You make the boss disgusted</br></br>  Episode 2 in 4 hours  Rui´s legs are the miracle of universe.  <br>fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff<wbr>fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff<wbr>fffffffffffag</wbr></wbr></br>   you'll never trap a Rui with a lifesaver   <br><br> Dumb silver hoe stole my partner </br></br>   Katze sees Rui´s ruirui.   so why is katze in hajime's boobs? Did i miss something last season?  <br>Damn Katze getting handfuls of those big Hajimes.</br>  <br>Yeah, last ep DC version.</br>  <br> Katze feels Rui's ruirui </br>  <br> Katze bound to hajimes <br>I hope he'll get real screentime this season.</br></br>  I hope Rui wears that dress this ep.  It's still weird to me that this got a second season. I liked crowds, but it didn't really seem popular enough to get another season.  <br>In B4 they are traps too.</br>    I can't figure out if the new girl is the true genki character, and Hajimi is just the pretend Genki one or not.  I wish they went back to the discourse on anonymity and the positive and negative benefits of the internet anon army instead of braindead silver girls.  <br>New girl is a genki tomboy.</br>  <br>New girl is red ranger.</br>  <br>did you miss episode 00 or what?</br>  Never forget.  <br><br>Oh that would make sense then.<br><br>Who is blue? Black? Token pink?</br></br></br></br>  <br> all men wearing high heels. </br>   Waiting for Cthuko   When was the white knight such a chick magnet?  <br>He started producing more pheromones after he realized that he's gay.</br>  <br><br><br>Seeing art work like this really makes me wish Nakamura just went wild with colours in the show rather than keeping it relatively muted compared to his past works.</br></br></br>  <br>Katze might be one of the only characters I've seen that looks better with short hair. There's something endearing about his eyes we didn't see much of in S1</br>  <br>You wouldn't white knight Hajime?</br>  Why is the OP so catchy? http://galax.moe  these gatchas sure know what they're doing  What subs should I pick /a/?  <br>Whichever ones come out first.</br>  <br>Why they hold hands so much?</br>  <br>Not Commie, anything but Commie. They rape Hajime.<br>Cthuko if you don't mind waiting<br>Horriblesubs if you actually want to watch it when it comes out. These threads have a pretty high mortality rate, you'll get a few whenever an episode airs and that's it, so if you wanna watch with /a/ Horriblesubs it is and Cthuko (or AnimeNow if they do another release) for a rewatch.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I need to be gay too.</br>  <br>What about streams? Last year watching it with /a/ was fun, but this time nobody even made a thread for episode 1. Will the usual places (y or n) work?</br>  <br>White Knight Hajime will be an incredibly great catch. But it is even hotter because she is a pretender.</br>  <br>I have gotten into the habit of just downloading from Horriblesubs all my anime needs.<br><br>Terrible, I know.<br><br>Also, we need to mark the thread in a way that makes archive diving easy for the rest of us who could not make it to the threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm not in all the sekrit clubs but Neetball doesn't have it on his schedule and episode 1 came out of nowhere because anichart fucked up and had it set for one day ahead. That + being a pretty niche show meant no one knew it was out until it was already out, and then subs came 30 minutes later.</br>  Tsubasa's Gatachaman color scheme looks like shit.  <br>Also Yucie is kill, forgot to mention</br>  <br>Isn't it akin to a gift we never expected?</br>  More importantly, why is grandpa's emotional bubble grey all the time too?<br><br>Is it wisdom? Or gives no fuck? Or looking down on the world?</br></br>  <br>It was a pretty fun day when it dropped, I'll admit. Episode 0 as well.</br>  <br><br>I could do a  stream  with the HS release if you guys would like</br></br>  So red crowds is basically /b/?<br><br>And normal crowds is /b/ when it is helpful?</br></br>  <br>That would be fun once the episode is out.</br>  <br>  :&gt;  <br><br>Also, that's the first time I noticed Paiman's avatar. Too cute.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought of Crowds as more like an over controlling facebook. There is really not that much anonymity when everyone on Crowds recognize Hajime.<br><br>And that raised the question of whether we should follow her example and become a bit more known on the internet to connect it with our real lives.</br></br></br>  <br>Me too. It's just so convenient.</br>  <br><br>Fun fact, that Ruirui was 3rd most liked pic of the day by males on pixiv.</br></br>  <br>Is Gatchaman that popular in Nip land?</br>  <br>It's just because it's by a really popular artist. I doubt even half of them liked it because it's Ruirui.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>Oh. Too bad.</br>  <br><br>Definitely.</br></br>  <br>red crowds is /b/ and /pol/ while everyone else in blue is mix of everything.</br>   red crowds <br> VAPE <br>I guarantee you we're going to get a shot of their leader wearing a fedora before this is all over.</br></br>  <br>I am not so thrilled about the ill founded planet of the apes reference.</br>  IT'S ABOUT ETHICS IN SOCIAL MEDIA SUPERPOWERS  <br>Or something</br>  <br> Hajime will never drill you  r walls </br>  <br>You must be new.</br>  <br>Would call this handy man any day.</br>  <br>Gatchaman? yes<br>Gatchaman crowd? i'm not sure, but we got a second season because high rating</br></br>  <br>Can't get a high rating without being somewhat popular.</br>  <br>I wonder why she's covered in specks of white stuff. Maybe she  was doing herself. </br>  <br>Just not gatchaman movies?</br>  <br>The movie that Crowds was suppose to coincide with did rather shit actually.</br>  <br>Japanese anime-&gt;live action movies are always trash</br>  When the next episode comes out, I'll show it here:<br>http://galax.moe/stream</br>  <br> How to log in? I tried Baccano and that didn't work </br>  Watched the first episode finally. I like how JJ doesn't give two fucks anymore and forcibly transformed the new girl in front of camera crews.  <br>He means he'll add it to the main page, I assume.</br>  <br> secret </br>  <br>What is this and why does it asks me to log in?</br>  <br> you'll never eat rui up <br>why live</br></br>  <br>Oh god, I think VAPE has gotten to X, god help us all!</br>    <br><br>Wearing spats? Hell, Rui is know how to make me diamond hard.</br></br>    <br><br> there probably won't be an S3 <br> no more Rui after this season </br></br></br>  <br>I never dared to dream there'd be an S2 so I'm pretty happy.</br>  2 hours 30 mins until estimated release  With the absolutely shit lame ending of season 1, why are we giving this another chance?  <br>Because Hajime is a miracle of universe and anything with her in it is worth watching.</br>  <br>Because  Rui Rui </br>  <br>.... wow, that's actually valid.</br>  <br>Because traps sells.</br>  <br>Because critical opinion does not agree with yours.</br>  <br><br>Because Rui. He deserve the attention.</br></br>  <br>I want to see Rui being happy.</br>              <br>Didn't you watch the director's cut?</br>  <br>I can't stop laughing at Katz's expression as he forced to grab a handful of Hajime's Hajimes. I will be sad if they're forced to separate before the series is over.</br>  Katz manages to escape but takes Hajime's Hajimes with him.<br>Hajime is now flatchested.<br>How would you feel?</br></br>    <br>What kind of pantsu does he wear?<br>- shimapan?<br>- fundoshi?<br>- white ?<br>- no pan?</br></br></br></br></br>  I would only accept this if he sneaks into Ruirui and gives him breasts instead.  <br>Definitely something frilly and lacy, likely black.</br>  <br>Oh, hello, there, my other favorite trap. <br>See , but I think there was a Q&amp;A floating around about underwear, sleeping garments and swimwear.</br></br>  <br>In my head, shimapan or something lacy</br>  <br>Maybe we will find out if they finally decide to make a pvc release of his figure.</br>  <br>If somebody were to look at this screen cap without context they'd think it was yuri. Fun!</br>  <br>That ass, god damn.</br>  <br> his <br>Ff there isn't any built in bulge up the skirt it's whatever I want it to be</br></br>  <br>I have news for you</br>  <br>Please don't joke. This is a serious matter.</br>    <br>I will do everything in my power to bring Katze to justice and restore Hajime's hajimes.</br>  <br>Is dat....Rui´s ass / pantsu and...bulge??</br>    <br>I am very serious, my friend.<br>http://blog.livedoor.jp/toshigk/arc<wbr>hives/8206258.html</wbr></br></br>  <br>There's no way that's rea-<br> reverse search <br> it is </br></br></br>   Draw a girl <br> Call it a boy </br>  <br>my fucking D I C K</br>  <br>With Insight and Ranpo Kitan, what a great time to be alive.</br>  <br> That face </br>  <br><br>Dat wet look leather.

So yeah, if you define dying as ceasing to exist, everyone in the previous worldline dies.</br>  <br>It's not my favorite SciADV anime but I hold it in quite a high regard myself. I could see it being my favorite of the VNs once it's translated too.</br>  <br><br><br>That's confusing, didn't they also tell us that world lines run parallel from each other like a current? Why would one immediately cease to exist because of Okabe's influence?<br><br>For other time travelers, all their actions regarding the changes to world lines are, for Okabe, just events that transpires to whatever world line he happens to be in. That's logical.<br><br>But what's weird is how everything sort of uses Okabe as a reliance of some sort. You said world lines ceases to exist but would that not only apply to Okabe? To everyone else, world lines are just mere fiction cause they never experienced it, and even to other time travelers, they're just other 'events' to transpire in that world line, for Okabe.<br><br>Even Suzuha told Okabe that she would cease to exist once Okabe changed the world line to the Steins Gate world line cause there would then never be a need for her to use the time machine in the new future, so isn't she implying that the actions of Okabe alone is the only variable that relies on any sort of actual change in a world line rather than following a self-consistency principle that implies that any 'change' in a world line is merely things that were meant to be?<br><br>I feel like I'm tossing up a word salad and getting nowhere with this shit, but I can't help but feel confused about something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you watch the anime or read the VN?
