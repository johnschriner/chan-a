An individual who experiences inconsistency (dissonance) tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and is motivated to try to reduce this dissonance—as well as actively avoid situations and information likely to increase it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so that girl is the bear</br>  <br>There isn't enough food to last a week in my country.
