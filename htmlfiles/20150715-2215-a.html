I rotated my chair and turned my body towards Yuigahama. I sat there while digging around for the proper words to tell her. Yuigahama, however, didn’t give me the time and nodded. <br><br> “…Yeah, I think I am unfair!” Yuigahama said, her voice cheerful and as though she was convinced of something. <br><br> I didn’t quite catch the meaning behind her response, but I wanted to get the right nuance across to her and opened my mouth. <br><br> “I didn’t mean it like that, but uh, in a good way…” <br><br> Yuigahama, however, shook her head and interjected. “I think… I really am unfair… It’s because I can never stop you or even help you. And also… for a bunch of other things.” <br><br> Yuigahama’s words were in a jumble, perhaps because she was trying to think while she talked. But it’s due to that that I felt her words were from the bottom of her heart. In the same way she’d laugh to hide her embarrassment or mumble her words and look away, I’m sure she wanted to play it off somehow. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128104727#p128110881">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the part where she ran for the stuco president to stop 8man from committing social kamikaze?</br>  <br>She did it to save the club she loved.</br>   pic related   <br>Not them but it doesn't make that much sense.<br>Ok he has amnesia, why the fuck did Ace's death fix it?
