[ I am thankful for Non Non Biyori, the best anime of the decade.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134007410 <br> anything I don't like is a meme and all memes are bad <br>This meme needs to die.</br></br>   tfw NNB was really good <br> tfw shitposters on both sides of the spectrum can't ruin my fun </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134007507 <br>It's a meme to derisively refer to NNB as a "meme show."</br>  <br>Where does it say it's a meme show?</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134007410 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134007426 <br>That's not black swordsman.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just thankful for the memes.</br>  <br>Just saying,  is the reason for this post, whether the post's assumption was accurate or not: <br><br>I am too, anon. All the Hikage screentime was glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>It's definitely up there.</br>  <br>Why can't I take my eyes off Hotaru's calves?</br>  Was there ever a scene in Repeat that could even compare to the first episode of NNB? The intro with Renge's recorder and the shots of the landscape was beautiful.      <br>Watch more anime.</br>  <br>Anon, you might need to watch more anime. <br><br>Not sure where I'm getting this feeling from.</br></br></br>  <br>Every scene exclusively of those two is gorgeous.</br>  I dunno about best, but it's definetly one of my favourites, they never really did anything badly in it, every episode was atleast good and some were excellent, the soundtrack was lovely, the scenery and backgrounds were beautiful and the healing was exceptional. S2 had a little more QUALITY than I would have liked, but hopefully the BD's will fix that.  I am thankful for non no biyori, the greatest fap material of the last decade  <br> Was there ever a scene in Repeat that could even compare to the first episode of NNB? <br>Non Non Biyori Repeat episode 4 is the greatest anime episode of all-time, anon.</br></br>  <br>Confirmed.</br>    <br>Is that the Nee-nee centric one? Because that was the real best ep in the series.</br>  I love you Natsumi!  <br>No you don't.</br>  OP is a faggot  <br>In other news, water confirmed to be wet.</br>  <br>I0m glad i never watched that shit.<br>My friend told me he got sleepy every episode.</br></br>  <br>It's the one with Flatty-san.</br>  <br> My friend told me he got sleepy every episode. <br>That's the point. It's iyashikei. You and your friend may not have realized it, but the show was doing what it was intended to do to him.</br></br>  <br> being stressed <br> ever </br></br>  <br>I suppose there's not much to be stressed about when you never leave your mom's basement.</br>  <br>Just live in a socialist state, comrade.</br>  Good that shitposting gets deleted now<br><br>Mods confirmed for NNB fans<br><br>That's what you get for the best anime this decade<br><br>Honestly, what's better? The rest of it is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>S3 needs more Candy Store.<br><br>The downside is that is those states will be the first to fall to the Muslims once they stop pretending to be peace-loving.</br></br></br>  <br> Was there ever a scene in Repeat that could even compare to the first episode of NNB? <br>There were many.<br><br>Fuck off heretic.<br><br> The rest of it is shit <br>That's a very hipster statement. There have been other good shows in the 2010s.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's what you get for the best anime this decade <br>I agree, but if I had to venture a guess I'd say the deleted posts in this thread are someone who got banned for posting something worse in a different thread. Sometimes when people are banned here all of their posts are deleted from the board at once.</br></br>  It's a cut above the slice of life standard but I don't think it hits the same highs as like, K-On!, Azumanga Daioh, Yotsuba, or whatever. Still, very far from bad and easily one of my favourite shows this year.  <br>Don't worry, comrade. There are bigoted socialist states that do not tolerate foreigners and religious people.</br>  <br> There have been other good shows in the 2010s. <br><br>Such as?</br></br></br>  <br>GochiUsa &gt; NonNon<br><br>By far.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, I don't even like Non Non Biyori that much but I can't let such a bad opinion fly. <br><br><br>Try lurking more, newfriend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'll have to. Nothing you can do about it but accept it.</br>  <br> such a bad opinion <br>One autistic retard loli, one adult sized loli (oh wait), one whiny cunt and one whiny bitch<br><br>vs<br><br>One more adorable autistic retard loli, two cute loli friends, one fun cutie, a quirky cutie, a tsundere cutie, a whatever you get the point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the one you responded to<br><br> You have a point </br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it but ok.</br>  Post your best NNB memes  <br>Non Non Biyori is the greatest slice of life series of all-time.<br>GochiUsa is one of the most formulaic, bland slice of life series of all-time. Literally all it tries to do is be cute.<br>The opinion you just posted is the worst opinion of all-time.</br></br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori is one of the most formulaic, bland slice of life series of all-time. Literally all it tries to do is be cute.</br>  <br>Not gonna spoonfeed you, but for one there were two very good shows in 2014 specifically in Fall and Autumn seasons. Go look them up.<br><br>GochiUsa is drivel compared to NNB.</br></br></br>  <br>No, never. You have shit taste, are lying, or haven't seen them and are just shitposting.</br>  <br><br>Literally wrong. GochiUsa isn't just cute, it's hilarious.</br></br>  <br>And GochiUsa ISN'T formulaic?</br>  <br>Come on, mate. Just accept the superiority of GochiUsa. No need to make a big fuss about it. Just because it's a better show doesn't mean you can't enjoy Non Non Biyori.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the crazy bunnies alone make GochiUsa less formulaic than NonNon.</br>  <br>I'll never accept any buttmoe as anything but terrible. You're gay and I hate you!</br>  <br>The unique scenarios stemming from its rural setting make NNB one of the least formulaic, least generic SoL series ever made. Most episodes have the Biyoris doing things you don't see characters do in most SoLs.</br>  <br> buttmoe <br>u wot m8</br></br>   liking NNB but not liking GochiUsa <br>fucking HOW? the two titles are so similar, and they're both really good.<br>you faggots need to stop taking all this bait.</br></br>  <br>It's dark and edgy<br><br>Rize has a fascination with guns and Cocoa likes prime numbers</br></br></br>  <br>It's true, Non Non Byori is the first anime ever with a rural setting.</br>  <br> here. I actually like GochiUsa, because I simply love cute girls doing cute things. It's absolutely unquestionable that NNB has far more substance to it, though.</br>  <br><br>What's so bad about prime numbers?</br></br>  <br>Silver Spoon was shit.</br>  Can't we just all agree to the fact that they're both great Slice of Life anime? Is there any reason to try and say one is better for a reason other than "I'm an autistic faggot" ?  <br>NNB was a better title, I agree with that<br>however, I also disagree with your assertion that GochiUsa is the most bland SoL. That goes to Sora no Method</br></br>  This anime is pretty comfy but I would only go as far as a 7/10, to be completely honest.  <br>I did say "one of the" most bland SoLs, you know. Lucky Star is the blandest.</br>  <br>Thank you SO much for your input, malfriend!</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with some shows being better than the others in their respective genre. That's completely normal. 2nd place isn't necessarily for losers.</br>  <br>I wouldn't even say GochiUsa is bland at all. the drunk scenes are funny as hell.<br>also, the characters are well developed</br></br>  <br>I'll let my current banner respond for me.</br>  <br> the drunk scenes are funny as hell. <br>You really aren't tired of this trope yet? Shit caused some hard eye-rolling over here m8.</br></br>  <br> Any format of rating in a thread about the "anime of the decade" is automatically MALshit <br><br>Sure lad</br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/S6NBf6splEI  [ ]</br>  <br>How bout you have a real fuckin opinion instead of hiding behind numbers you malfaggot?</br>  <br>You're right, but this is turning into a shitfest and nothing more. Not to mention this discussion is happening by completely denouncing the other anime, which is stupid, because they're both fantastic anime in their genre. I agree with you that regardless of whether NNB is better than GochiUsa or vice-versa, they're both really good and at least near the top of the Slice of Life genre.<br><br>I just wish people would fight less over the anime they like and not get butthurt like hell just because someone else likes another show a little more than the one you like most.</br></br></br>  <br>Some seasons are better than the other ones, just like some shows are better than other shows. <br><br>Getting triggered by having your favorite show be called out as being less good than another one is just sad, however.</br></br></br>  <br> I didn't like it therefore it's bad <br>okay then, but that's just your subjective opinion.</br></br>  <br> I just wish this were a circlejerky hugbox </br>  Why do people start their threads like this? <br>They are literally asking for shitposting.</br>  <br>I don't think is the best anime of the decade.</br>  <br>Not fighting over every little thing doesn't mean it's a hugbox. It's as  says: Getting triggered over every little thing is sad. And fucking dumb.</br>  <br> answering your own question  <br><br><br>What do you think the best anime of the decade is?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Madoka<br> Fate/Zero <br> Hyouka <br> Shinsekai Yori <br> Psycho-Pass <br> Ping Pong <br> Terror </br></br></br></br></br></br> <br>Watch more and better stuff, faggot.</br></br>  <br> It's as  says </br>  <br>Also, GochiUsa, YuruYuri, and Shirobako.</br>  <br> hyouka  <br> better </br></br>  <br> What do you think the best anime of the decade is <br>probably K-ON. Although GuP and Madoka(excluding rebellion) were good too</br></br>  <br>Of all the garbage on that list you pick the best ones?</br>  <br>Oh cool, K-On! is my pick too. Haven't seen GuP yet but Madoka's writing was pretty ass.</br>  <br>I didn't watch anything else he listed except for hyouka and NNB, and hyouka was not something I liked</br>  <br>Sora no Woto was a really good title, too. I could have done without the walking tanks, though. the whole premise of having armored vehicles on legs is really stupid and highly overused.</br>  <br> Fate Zero <br> Psycho Pass <br> Zankyou no Terror <br> better then NNB <br>Try harder newfag.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I loved that one, I'm a sucker for sentimental "power of music" themes.</br>  I need more NNB memes.    <br>waoh, deep</br>  <br> Haven't seen GuP <br>why not? what part about high school girls driving WW2 tanks is unappealing to you?</br></br>  <br>All of those are heavily flawed</br>  <br>Man two NNB threads within days of each other? Good taste guys.</br>  There will be another OVA and then that's it<br><br> S3 when? </br></br>  <br>Haven't gotten around to it, and from what I've seen it looks very bland, visually speaking. I'm sure I'd enjoy it based on the premise alone, but there are way more shows I haven't seen that are more appealing, so it just sits on the back burner.</br>  <br> bland <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rIY<wbr>36UbDbQQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I can't chose, K-on and NNB are so fucking good. Why can't both of them be anime of the decade.</br>  <br>Some anon saved all of these from that thread long ago, right?</br>  <br>I only saved the one I made, which was the Hindenburg one.</br>  Anons, lets stop fighting and post pictures of the best girl, of the best anime of the decade. They are all great, but my vote goes for Komari, so adorable.  <br>No you don't.</br>    <br>And loli komari is just as good.</br>  <br>Great taste.</br>    <br>Don't post angry komari anon. Flustered is much better.</br>    I don't know how you can pick one, we also have GochUsa, Kiniro, YrYr and maybe one day a new season of Yuyushiki.<br><br>This is the Golden age of Moe.</br></br>  <br>Hey, i just bought a komari magnet with that image, neat.</br>  <br>I can't believe you forgot wakaba</br>  <br>Yeah, that was incredibly boring. Backgrounds and colours are pretty flat, character designs are nice but they're nothing special. I'm not big on CG either.<br>None of it is inherently bad but it has 0 personality (from what I've seen ofc).</br></br>  <br> tanks <br> boring <br>were we watching different videos?</br></br></br>  <br>If you like sports anime and moe, then it's pretty much perfect, you really have to like both though.</br>  <br> hetshit <br><br>kek no</br></br></br>  <br>Dumb pinpons.</br>  <br>She looks older here</br>  so cute  The longer the series went on the more I realized how much Natsumi was the best.<br><br>She will grow up to be an excellent mother and wife.</br></br>  <br><br>why do people like K-On</br></br>  <br>You did this on purpose, didn't you?</br>  <br>whether they're tanks or bicycles or whatever, there's just nothing particularly good looking about them<br>you don't have to mind me anon I care a lot about visuals<br><br><br>haven't seen too many sports shows but I liked everything I've seen, I'm sure I'll like it at least to an extent<br><br><br>have you seen it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine all the reasons why someone would like a SoL.<br>K-On! was the best at those things.</br></br>  <br>If you appreciate visuals so much, NNB should be your favorite anime of all time though.</br>  <br><br><br>watched first season and half of the second. I thought it was okay but not really sure why people worship it<br><br>NNB I thought was pretty good tho</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who also pays a lot of attention to audio, NNB has one of the best opening sequences of recent memory.<br>I was hooked from the very first few minutes of season1.</br></br>   of the decade  <br>Let's not get ahead of ourselves.</br>  <br>I'm thankful for your shit taste, because without it I would not have my good taste.</br>  <br>Yea, the music was beautiful, made me feel nostalgic for some reason.</br>  <br>yeah I liked non non biyori quite a bit but I don't think it was particularly special in that aspect<br>sound design was top notch though, it brought everything together so nicely<br>also Renge's recorder music<br><br><br>you gotta finish it dude<br>K-On! is meticulously structured and it's all working towards the end's emotional climax</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> half of the second <br>The best episodes are in the second half of S2.</br></br>  I, for one, do not care if people hate NNB. Most of those who dislike it haven't even watched it. I think that years from now, NNB will be remembered as one of the best SoL anime out there. I think it'll be up there with Aria in terms of praise, just wait.  <br>I like all of those shows but I feel like NNB is just as good as all of them at being cute, yet has so much more to it than the rest of those shows.</br>  <br>I really hope so, jems like this don't happen often.</br>  <br>I don't think people hates NNB, people hates NNBfags like you.</br>  <br> I think it'll be up there with Aria in terms of praise, just wait. <br>It seems like a lot of people here already consider it up there with ARIA in terms of iyashikei.</br></br>    <br>This is a NNB thread, I don't think this is for you.</br>  <br> Non Non Biyori is the greatest slice of life series of all-time. <br>See, this is what I can't get behind. Are you just trying to false-flag or what?</br></br>  <br>*Gems, whoops.<br><br><br> It's a good show but don't talk about it because then you'll be a fag. <br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>people tend to dislike the weird brand of unwarranted elitism that the fans have</br>  <br>That's normal. Everyone on /a/ hates everyone else.</br>  <br>Hyouka blows NNB out of the water if I'm honest.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>You can go make a subreddit about NNB if you don't want people to hurt your feelings.<br><br>Who are you quoting?<br><br>Lurk more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just an exaggeration guys, we know that it's not the anime of the decade, we just really like it. Best anime of the year by far </br></br>  <br>hyouka was great. I has chronic insomia and it finally allowed me to get sleep</br>  <br>The lurk more was for </br>  <br>Or you could stop shitposting and actually tell us why NNB sucks, or is that too much to ask.</br>  <br>It's not hard to be anime of the year when everything else is shit</br>  <br>non non shitori is utter crap tho.</br>  The best thing about NNB is that I still have S2 to watch!  <br>I never said it sucks, it's just an avergare SoL, not even close to being the best.</br>  NNB is just the K-ON for newfags.  <br>As opposed to a fake opinion? I don't even have a MAL. I could give you a rundown of what I think about the show but then again I don't feel like typing out a review. So I'll leave you with this:<br><br>Pros:<br>Its rural setting is comfy<br>The characters are a treat<br>The ending is good<br><br>That's as far as it impressed me. I start from 5 and work my way up or down. That's just how I roll. You don't have to be registered at some cancerous website to attribute numerical values.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with criticizing shows like NNB is that you can deflect all critiques. <br><br> it's too slow <br> "that's the point!" <br> it's formulaic <br> "that's the point!" <br> it's boring <br> "that's the point!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see, there ya go, significantly more constructive than &gt;7/10 which is a pretty useless take<br>you're on your way, anon</br></br>  <br> Formulaic <br>Alright that's just plain not true, as for boring, and slow, you have to like slow paced, relaxing things, if you like fast paced shounen, you probably hate stuff like this, which brings me to the point, why did you watch it. It's like someone who hates shounen watching naruto or something. You're doing this to yourself anon.</br></br>  <br> it's too slow <br>how so? which parts specifically?<br> it's formulaic <br>Again, how so?<br> it's boring <br>well, that's just your opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's shit <br> "that's the point!" </br></br>  <br>it's pretty formulaic, not that I think that's a bad thing in the slightest</br>  <br> but for one there were two very good shows in 2014 specifically in Fall and Autumn seasons. Go look them up. <br><br>With that obnoxious and condescending attitude, it's easy to understand why you don't have any friends.</br></br></br>  <br> Non Non Biyori is the greatest slice of life series of all-time. <br>This is correct. ARIA is second.<br><br>Yeah, I hate people who like a thing more than I do too, especially when that thing is really popular. I like to refer to this viewpoint of mine as, "being a faggot."</br></br></br></br>  <br> tho <br>fuck back off to reddit</br></br>  <br> specifically in Fall and Autumn seasons. </br>  <br>Alright, let me re-word that, it's less a lot less formulaic than a lot of other SOL's.</br>   You just don't understand the deep messages and undertones   <br>I-I was just pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>elitism is quite different than liking something more than I do, you understand this<br>if non non biyori is your favourite anime that's great<br>if you like non non biyori more than my favourite anime that's great<br>if you go around parading the show as if it were some kind of trophy and liking it makes you special and better than everyone else, people will inevitably take issue<br><br><br>how so, exactly? it's extremely standard fare for the genre, just a group of schoolgirls doing kid schoolgirl things</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>The autist.</br>  <br>Quoting yourself is bad form anon.</br>  <br>It is the only way for me to remain relevant.</br>  <br> and liking it makes you special and better than everyone else <br>Nobody here does this regarding just Non Non Biyori, but plenty of people here do this regarding moe in general, because if you dislike moe you are from /v/ and thus inferior.</br></br>  <br> it's formulaic <br>The hell does that mean?</br></br>   hating on NNBfags for being "elitist" <br><br>Oh come on, Ariafags are way worse. Say something bad about Aria and the only response you will get is bait memes.</br></br>  <br>it's meaningless, just like saying something has "forced animation"</br>  <br> best anime of the decade <br><br>There are a few shows in contention for that title, but this isn't one of them. Sorry OP.</br></br></br>  <br>That it follows a formula. <br><br>Normally, that term would rather be used for shows where each episode would work the same way, like for example Sailor Moon, Pokemon or Yatterman or any other such shows (mainstream shows with lots of episodes are the best kinds of examples for it), where you'd have bad guys doing something, good guys doing something, then transformation sequence, fighting, good guys win, bad guys lose and make their escape, and then everyone laughs, and this gets repeated again next week.</br></br></br>  <br>Each episode focused on a different character doing something new, though</br>  <br>Well this is /a/, normalcy doesn't exist here, so formulaic actually means "This anime did 3 thing that another anime already did, therefore its shit."</br>  <br>i dont even agree with that guy but being formulaic is a legitimate criticism</br>  <br>How does that contradict anything that guy said?</br>  <br>that's definitely a part of it, but the mentality has extended to non non biyori on its own due to it being the only notable moe slice of life this year<br><br><br>ariafags are mad gay<br>every time I criticize their show it's like "it's okay that you don't like it anon :)"<br><br><br>I think in this context it's referring to how non non biyori follows the same azumanga daioh cute schoolgirl comedy formula we've seen so many times since</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're forgetting the country atmosphere anon, that literally changes everything! But yea, i guess it is formulaic, i was wrong, but in my defence, are people really watching moe for story, i would assume people watch something like NNB after a long day, and they just want to feel comforted, with beautiful visuals and great music. That's why it's a great SOL, it does that perfectly.</br>  <br> cute schoolgirl comedy <br>most of NNB took place outside of school</br></br>  <br>yeah, again formulaic does not equal bad in the slightest, and I don't think "it follows a formula" can ever be legitimate criticism on its own<br><br><br>still important to the identity of the characters and the metastructure of the show</br></br></br></br>  <br> due to it being the only notable moe slice of life this year <br>What? GochiUsa is extremely popular, has sold extremely well and has extremely high production value for a SoL; it's visually superior to K-ON, even.<br>You just see more people praising NNB than other recent SoLs because it's much, much better than every SoL released since Nichijou.</br></br></br>  <br> it's visually superior to K-ON <br>Woah there, buddy. I love Gochiusa, its my AOTS, but it doesn't look nearly as good as K-On</br></br>  <br>Ah I see. Though I don't think that would apply to NNB in any way.<br>But if you strech it any japanese comedy is formulaic, with the boke and tsukkomi routine.<br><br><br>NNB is much more laid back, countryside atmosphere, had time for scenery porn. GochiUsa is held by the 4koma rhythm.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, I meant notable in terms of "being good"<br>I think most gochiusa fans don't hold it to be much more than enjoyable, while certainly more nnb fans put their show on a pedestal<br> visually superior to K-On! <br>fuck off you know nothing</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's visually superior to K-ON, even. <br>Fucking lol</br></br>   it's visually superior to K-ON   <br> it's visually superior to K-ON <br><br>Good one.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> it's visually superior to K-ON <br><br>This is why nobody on /a/ takes NNBqueers seriously.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>No, really. K-ON has a lot more QUALITY in the character models when they're a bit far away from the camera, QUALITY that GochiUsa lacks. GochiUsa is polished as FUCK. It's not as polished as 2015 KyoAni but it's definitely more polished as ~2010 KyoAni.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>someone explain this meme</br>  <br>You mean gochiusa fags.</br>  <br>I love gochiusa, but everything you're saying right now is bullshit.</br>  <br>This isnt even clever bait.</br>  <br> K-ON has a lot more QUALITY in the character models when they're a bit far away from the camera </br>  <br>This looks better than everything I remember from K-On.</br>  <br><br> This looks better than everything I remember from K-On. <br>is this bait, or are you LEGITIMATELY retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>it's bait you dip</br>  <br>It's an intermittent issue with the character models, much like it is with NNB. It's also more prevalent in the first season.<br><br><br>Keep cherrypicking.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You just see more people praising NNB than other recent SoLs because it's much, much better than every SoL released since Nichijou. <br>Could be a fan of both. .</br></br>  <br> Keep cherrypicking. <br>yeah, fuck off</br></br>  GochiUsa's S2 ED is animated better than anything in K-ON.  <br> Keep cherrypicking. <br>I literally just picked the first one I saw that was under 4MB in my Azusa screenshot folder.</br></br>  <br>That's objective, the K-on thing was fucking dumb though</br>  <br> GochiUsa's S2 ED is animated better than anything in K-ON. </br>   hey /a/, X did Y better than KyoAni <br> RARRRRRRWHARRRRRRGARBLWARRRRRRRRRR<wbr>RRRRRR</wbr> <br>Every time.</br></br>  <br>Most boring anime of the decade</br>  <br>do you mean stuff like this?<br>I just picked a random first season episode and found a distance shot<br><br><br>don't be a dummy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, stop posting anytime.</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>Yes. I realize it's a stylistic choice but I seem to recall thinking they were going with that kind of look when the character models were too close to the camera for it to not look off.</br>  How do moefags like this shit? Even amongst the few that I've seen it's so boring. This must be a forced reddit meme.   all this bait   <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Now its just too obvious.</br>  <br>oh, anon...</br>  <br>if you can find an example, feel free to share it, but I definitely never noticed the show looking bad (outside of that one fucking Ritsu sidemouth in the beach episode that I can never unsee)<br><br>wrt my example, I'd argue that it's actually pretty impressive<br>at that distance there's no way to nicely do facial features, I think you'd agree, but they still managed to include essential details like Nodoka's glasses or Ritsu's headband<br>that aside, the details on their clothing and the models and poses themselves are still rather detailed<br>maybe it's just poorly cherrypicked but there's no way I could accept someone calling that frame bad</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br> Psycho-Pass <br> Ping Pong </br></br>  <br>ping pong is good you gay fag</br>  <br>Panzerkunst cyborg girl from Mars.</br>  <br>NNBfags, everyone.</br>  <br>Most cancerous fanbase of the decade</br>  Still don't understand why people here worship this boring inoffensive tripe  <br>why is inoffensive a criticism?</br>  <br>You clearly haven't been to the Madoka threads.</br>  <br>both are good though you fucking pleb</br>  <br>Honestly this. I can't believe how shitty these threads have become.</br>  <br>Each have their own merits, Yuyushiki is my favourite for the character interactions but NNB is the most comfy. <br><br><br>Sorry, still need to watch more.</br></br></br></br>  NNB is on the same level as Sketchbook full colors or Manabi Straight, that is to say second tier SOL.  <br><br><br> Ping Pong </br></br></br>  <br> Sketchbook <br> second tier SoL </br></br>  <br>if anyone here is being pretentious its you</br>    <br><br>Says the guy who types like a five year-old.<br><br>Yuyushiki does have some stellar character interactions, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>watched yuyushiki last week, the sense of humour that show has is absolutely fantastic</br>  <br><br>Let's be real, you really only watched that shit for Kanada</br></br>  What exactly is good about this show? I downloaded all the episodes recently and watched the first one. I nearly died of boredom. Does it get better?  <br> hurr what is water </br>  <br> the sense of humour that show has is absolutely fantastic <br>The humor is so damn wonderfully non-repetitive, unlike 99% of SoLs.</br></br>  <br>You aren't even using a new IP. Stop trying.</br>  <br>Nah, it's literally the third best iyashikei anime. Sora is great because autism moe is best moe, and the cats are great too, especially Kuma.</br>  <br>Not even him but what?</br>  <br>how new are you?</br>  <br>it's completely retarded, but it's the kind of retarded jokes hypothetical real friends share<br>felt realistic without being boring, and was pretty well delivered<br><br><br>in all honestly I thought it was fairly repetitive, especially with respect to the character dynamics, but I don't particularly give a shit in a single cour comedy show</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How retarded are you?</br>  <br>literally wat?I just came in this thread.</br>  <br>The cats were the only good thing.</br>  <br> in all honestly I thought it was fairly repetitive <br>I don't think there's even a single running gag in Yuyushiki, is there? No, Yui hitting Yuzu doesn't count.</br></br>  <br><br>Didn't show for me. My bad.</br></br>  <br>oh sure, in terms of the actual jokes themselves they did well there<br>I just mean like, a good chunk of them were given in the same context, fucking with Yui mostly</br></br>  <br>I think it's impressive that they managed to not repeat any jokes while steadily maintaining a strong 2 boke 1 tsukkomi dynamic.</br>  <br>definitely, it was consistently funny too<br>my favourite of the straight-up comedy cgdct shows that I've seen</br></br>  <br>I don't know what's going on... Can someone answer my question?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134023854 <br>I disagree.</br>  <br> is likely using a browser extension for 4chan which shows which posts are new posters to the thread and which ones aren't.</br>  <br>oh okay.. thanks?</br>    <br>is that art or from the show directly?<br>I don't remember the colours being so harsh</br></br>  Are the shit posters gone?  <br>I sure hope so</br>  <br>If people like you weren't shitting it up, everyting would sure be dandy.</br>  <br>The cookie just magically regenerates</br>  Well thread is dead. See you later NNbros.  <br>From the show, but I don't know who made the stitch so I don't know if contrast/colors/levels/etc. have been fucked with or not.</br>    More like Non Non I'm SNORING  Candy store lady best girl.     first post deleted <br>Sorry for talking down about the anime of the millennium.</br>  <br> every time I criticize their show it's like "it's okay that you don't like it anon :)" <br>I do think that is a better response than "Your taste suck dicks, anon."</br></br>  <br>Did someone say that here?</br>  <br>that's what people say on reddit</br>  <br>How would you know?</br>  <br> anime of the millennium. <br>At first I was like, that's a humorous exaggeration, but then I was like, well, technically, it is better than ARIA, so yeah, I guess it actually is.</br></br>    <br>Urge to hug critical.</br>  <br>Its a side effect.</br>  <br><br>Aria is an overrated piece of garbage.</br></br>  <br>literally nothing wrong with reddit</br>  Just started rewatching the first season, and god damn it's good. This isn't just any old SoL anime, this is something really good.   tfw Komari is taller than me   <br/>  <br>There's also an autistic fan of the show who immediately accuses newcomers who just give their honest opinion that they find this show boring as being a shitposter. <br><br>It of course doesn't help that the thread title is meant to be provocative in the first place, so it makes the autist fan even that much more dumber.</br></br></br>  <br>Heavily underrated.<br>If we're talking about SoL stuff this is superior  until Repeat happened. </br></br>    <br>That's a big tonkatu.</br>  NNB Repeat was so fucking good holy shit. Hopefully we get more good iyashikei adaptations in the near future thanks to its success.<br><br> Hope to see you all in the Amanchu threads this summer. </br></br>  <br>It actually does have those though. It doesn't need them, but it has them. But once you start viewing NNB with the melancholic veneer of its overall social context, it becomes a deeper experience.</br>  <br>No it's stupid have the balls to defend what you love from critique</br>  This show is so unrealistic. There are no kids being born in Japan.  I'm not sure I understand why people find the NNB fanbase annoying. I don't really see people discussing NNB outside of NNB threads or (understandably) AOTS/AOTY threads.<br><br>Is it because we keep making threads out-of-season where all we do is circlejerk about how much we love the show? Is that annoying?</br></br>  <br>People probably think that the people who post the "AOTY chart" threads are actual NNBfags.</br>  <br>NNB was terrible as Iyashikei though. It was just escapism. A security blanket for manchildren. And waifushit clashes with the genre, so autistic waifufags can buy it.</br>  <br> muh mature chinese cartoons <br><br>Get over yourself m8</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the point even though it's the truth. NNB is pure escapism for autistic manchild, "m8".</br>  <br>yeah as is anime in general, what's your point?</br>  <br> Honestly, what's better? <br>How does anyone still bothers to ask or answer this kind of question? They never lead to anything since it's subjective as fuck. <br> I know the answer is shitposting. </br></br></br>  <br>That, and this shitty thread title makes many assume that the NNB fanbase is only made up of shitposters. It doesn't help that at least one NNB fag is actually autistic. But then again, every fanbase has That Guy. <br>It's important to dissociate from those kind of people, and to make it clear that they don't represent the rest of the fanbase. <br><br>Fortunately, the Aoty thread got called out as the shitty cancer that it was and was swiftly deleted.</br></br></br></br>  <br> have the balls to waste your time arguing with someone whose opinion you won't change anyway to stop him from saying stuff that has literally no effect on anything </br>  Is this new meme replacing Tatami Galaxy?  <br><br>Kiniro Mosaic &gt; Gochiusa &gt; Biyori<br><br>It doesn't matter if you're formulaic, what matters is that you're cuter than the other.</br></br></br></br>  Nanishton?  <br>So instead of starting threads with things like "Can we talk about how Non Non Biyori is the greatest anime of all time?" we should be starting them with something like "Can we have a Non Non Biyori thread?" That would make us less annoying?</br>  <br>Yeah, sure. Or just have another kind of title, like Non Non Biyori thread.</br>    <br> Komari grows tits but remains a shrimp <br><br>Poor kid.</br></br></br>  <br> Komari grows tits  <br>except that she won't.</br></br>   OKINAWA NEVER   <br>they all died on that plane anon<br><br>That's why the story was also repeated in S2</br></br></br>    NANA WILLS IT<br><br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/dai<wbr>ly-briefs/2015-11-26/designer-symph<wbr>ogear-will-come-back-again/.95841</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I did, you read too much into it.</br>  <br>Not him, but your posts all literally bleed reddit.</br>  <br>You know Nana has no need for that.</br>  <br>How about you stop sucking so much cocks and try to have fun with you anime once in a while?</br>  <br>What sacrifices that went on to mean nothing?

We need someone who can nail this scene.  <br>Was he voiced in the vomic? I never actually listened to those.</br>  <br>Nah. The vomic covered only the first chapter.</br>  <br> She became super-lewd as a consequence of living like a NEET, still has the same poor social skills despite being a sex icon  <br> This is why she's still single at 30+ despite having the body of a goddess. </br></br>  <br><br>How about you McFucking kill yourself instead? :^)</br></br>  <br><br>I want Ikeda Narushi.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134030250 <br><br>That's not the end of the first chapter...</br></br>  <br>Shame, I didn't realize that. Oh well, I've heard good things about the up and coming voice actors so far. They got the guy that voiced Accelerator in Index to voice Bakugo.</br>  <br>It all makes sense. Do you think she was always voluptuous though, or if she got some enhancements after becoming a heroine?</br>  <br><br>Nah dude. Best part that always replays in my mind is the first time Midoriya punched anything. His first Smash.</br></br>  <br>She had her nipples removed to appeal to the PG audience.</br>  <br><br>Are you upset?</br></br>  <br>For me, the whole Deku vs. Todoroki fight. Shit was hype.</br>  <br>Jouji Nakata would nail this,</br>  <br><br>It's a result of her NEET diet. Her corset covers the fact that she has a bit of a belly too.<br><br><br><br>This was actually addressed, she wears a thin skintight leotard under the leather parts of her outfit and it's flesh-colored.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a bit of a belly too <br>She wears the corset at home?</br></br>  <br>It being an ultra thin body suit actually hides her bulging nipples?</br>  <br>Ahh, right. I remember that was a big theory for awhile, and finally got showed off during the fight with Mineta.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134030250 <br><br><br><br>For me, it's the moment when Midoriya judo-flips Kacchan and the entirety of their fight after that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That part was pretty good, but that whole scene posted earlier with Endeavor made me feel absolutely nothing, quite honestly. His design is good, but his character just feels like a tired cliché. I have zero interest or hype for him.</br></br>  <br>Pasties</br>  <br><br><br> Implying she has nipples </br></br></br>  Now Bleach is out in gooks. BnHA when?  <br> Bleach still getting early scans </br>  <br><br>Here's proof on the leotard thing earlier than the Mineta fight.<br><br><br><br>That's a pretty baggy sweater, enough to hide a little bit of pudge.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what are some powers you guys would like to see come up next? Personally, I'd love to see some sort of flesh control/shaping power, Alex Mercer style. <br>Also, have some fun with this.<br>http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Special:Random</wbr></br></br></br>  How do you see the schedule in ishuhui? I'm in mobile. OP is out.  <br>Woops, didn't mean to quote!</br>  <br><br>A different sort of superspeed+lightning power, where the user can turn into a bolt of lightning and move in a straight line at the normal speed of lightning, but only when they're in motion.</br></br>  Well, Manga Umaru started uploading Jump scans, but MHA is one of the last series that they do.<br>Ishuhui uploaded One Piece, but that was in response to MangaStream, because as they said, they don't want to lose views to English scans. They probably won't be uploading anything else for a while.</br>  <br>No, you dont.</br>  assuming Toga and Stain have similar powers,<br>when they bite each other at the same time what would happen?<br>  Toga is such a weird name; it's a piece of cloth you wear over a tunic  <br>  why would you call your girl like that?  </br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, the moment Bakugou realizes he can't just fuck with Deku anymore and his resultant rage attack is fantastic, but I also thought it had the best of Iida we've seen so far.</br></br>  <br>Her first name is Himiko.</br>  <br>I remember that /tg/ request. It was a good request.<br><br>As for the question, I'd like something really wacky and out-there again. Something like Tape's tape elbows. A quirk that seems ridiculous at first, but actually quite versatile when applied correctly.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming, giving the emphasis on bloodletting when describing her crimes, she has some sort of blood control/vampiric power. You'll notice, she's always got a bit of a focus on her mouth whenever she's shown off.</br>  <br>yes, I accept this as my headcanon<br>Kayama used to be exactly like Tomoko growing up<br><br>what eyecolor does midnight have anyways?</br></br></br></br>  Midnight/Mineta doujins when?  <br>Midnight and Mount Lady domming Mineta, please.</br>  <br>I DON'T want a literal spider-man joke. It's been done too many times.<br><br>I would like to see a top-tier telepath or psychic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone who can spawn lots of tiny little buggers that work as a swarm and then zerg-rush people. Like a swarm of locust type of deal.</br>  I think Toga Himiko's quirk is controlling blood inside the victim, like Katara's blood magic and maybe she is able to move it out of the body through cuts.  <br>So menagerie from the elite with a dash of the darkness, from, well, the darkness?</br>  <br>I have no idea what any of those are. I'm just thinking of a swarm of locust that would attack people and eat them up like regular locust do to plants.</br>  <br><br> They bite each other <br> Togo can't move <br> neither can Stain <br> it's a draw <br>most boring fight in the history of boring fights</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget how Ash and that Samurai dude used two Megapods that just kept hardening?</br>  <br>Menagerie summons little things to do that (see her arm) can fly and modify herself (better hearing, seeing etc...).<br><br>The darkness is basically spawning monster, plus tentacles. But only in the dark. You also die if you impregnate a women and you get it once you're 18. It's the edgelord power.</br></br></br>  http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>561062</wbr>    <br>No Mina, I won't lick the dog shit off your shoes.</br>  <br>Thank you Ochako for appearing at the right moment</br>  <br>At last.

Horikoshi made a deal with God or the Devil.

Like, the cavalcade of crooks he carouses with will change, but he'll remain Deku's arch nemesis?  <br>Dat healty invisible tighs</br>  <br>He will kill All Might in the future. Is there something bigger he could achieve?</br>  <br>I don't even read cape comics and I think it's ridiculous on just about every level.</br>  <br>Not really. Shounen does''t have to be dumb and childish, just because most of it is.</br>  <br>Bigger than killing a dying man? Yes. Killing Deku too, so the OfA is no longer passed on.</br>  <br> I have to deal with Bendis bullshit even on /a/ </br>  <br>No one except for a handful of people know that All Might is a dying man, even Deku doesn't know that he will be gone one day. <br>And Shigaraki probably doesn't know that Deku is the next OFA successor.</br></br>  <br>Anon, you're on /a/.

He just wanted heroes to be actual Heroes and not career salarymen.</br>  <br>Garou never tried to become an hero</br>  <br>13<br><br> Huh... <br><br> Yeah...Why didn't I think of this before <br> In the end it all comes back to this <br><br> Ahh for what purpose exactly was I confused about this earlier...! <br><br> It's because of「That Garbage」All Might And his stupid smiling face <br><br> That these dickheads can continue smiling their idiotic smiles and go on with their pointless lives <br><br> Urgh...! <br><br> It's because they're smiling like there are no hopeless people on this planet  <br><br> That I'm so pissed off!! <br><br><br>Sorry about the typos. My heater broke and my extremities plus my brain are freezing. <br>It's <br><br> This is all <br><br> Because of All Might </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Garou is the one who never wanted to become a hero. Stain even enrolled in a private school before realizing current heroes were just walking Ads for companies.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Shigaraki knows what he's talking about<br>And you don't go shit talking the guy who is taking you hostage and will go on a killing spree after he's done with you</br></br>  <br><br>damn I didn't notice that panel before<br><br>Poor shota Shigaraki.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;It's because they're smiling like there are no hopeless people on this planet <br>Wow, rly nigga ? Be more of a pussy, accept the world how it is and dont give a fuck. Be Gondola.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit did he kill his father?</br>  <br>Garou has always wanted to become a hero. He wanted a world peace, but not being able to achieve it through peaceful ways, he want to achieve it through terror and dictatorship.</br>  <br>Kaminari is the best in general.</br>  <br><br>the part that weirds me out more is how bloody he is. Maybe his father was the one who tried to kill him before he fought back.</br></br>  <br>Did he kill his own daddy with an hug?</br>  <br>Unwittingly, most likely.<br><br> Dad, gimme a hug. <br> Hands hug him <br> Dad explodes <br> Hands scarred for life. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He didn't protect my smile <br> So I'll take everyone's smiles </br></br>  <br> I killed my family with my quirk <br>Jeez, dude, just get over it</br></br>  <br>Nah, he caught his dad giving his mom head while she was on her period.</br>  Why does shigaraki not wear some gloves with one or more (just not all five)fingers cut off? This way he will be able to normally touch stuff without destroying neither the gloves nor what he touches. It's so easy. It would have avoided him a lot of troubles and pain.  <br>True, he is best boy</br>  <br>Maybe his father was one of the many people in that huge accident 10 years ago where All Might made his debut and saved 1000 people, but Shigaraki's father is one of them he couldn't save.<br>Just a theory.</br></br>  <br>Why do you think he calls the hand on his face "father"?<br><br><br>It's not like he'd be instantly disintegrated. It would start from the outermost skin first, and eventually it would develop to the point where his blood could flow out freely while his entire body crumbles.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oooh<br><br>I guess its safe to assume that's his padre?</br></br></br>  <br> All Might dies by hugging Shigaraki while in tears, apologizing for not being able to protect his smile when he needed it most <br> "What kind of Symbol of Justice am I..." </br></br>  <br>I haven't seen this ever, context anyone?</br>  <br>but he will destroy gloves</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134040417 <br>Wrong page, Boss.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134040417 <br><br>Wrong page, mate.</br></br>  <br>I think there's more to the story. Shigaraki's power dissolves what he touches, but there's a hell of a lot of blood. And why would there be just a hand left behind?</br>  <br>What if Shiagaraki's dad had the same quirk and Shiagaraki just went ballistic after watching him kill his mom? It's a given that he was abused as a child because of his scars.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134040417 <br>You skipped a page.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134040417 <br>umm Boss ?</br>  <br>He said NOT all his fingers.</br>  <br>Do you really need context for a retcon page where 3/4 of the panels are copypasted?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134040417 <br>Gonna correct that for you:<br><br> Ahh <br> Being able to talk to you is great! <br> Excellent! <br><br> Urgh <br><br> Thank you Midoriya! <br><br> I'm not wrong at all! <br><br> Stop moving around! <br> Do you want to die? <br><br> You really don't care about whether normal citizens die because of you? <br><br> Such irony  <br> Hero Killer... <br><br> You let me go by you unchallenged even though I completely embody what you oppose <br> And your ideals and belief <br><br> Will all become my stepping stones </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe worse. We didn't know how it works on a human yet, it's possible that it involves lots of agonized screaming, cursing, and blood squirting.<br><br><br>Oh god, they did say that a quirk can manifest anytime before they turn 4. Imagine touching your dad as usual, except this time he dies</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>lol that artist is so suited to drawing these two, its like they were made for him</br></br>  <br>Only if he clenches his hand.</br>  <br>No, because he's not touching them with all five fingers. Only four of them are in the gloves, the remaining one is bare.</br>  <br>I don't understand what's happenin like who's the guy/girl and why is he gay</br>  What if AfO is the one giving Shigaraki his quirk?  <br>Thanks. <br><br>15<br><br> Deku? <br><br> He is't... <br><br> Isn't your friend right...? <br><br> Let him go <br><br> Alright? <br><br> I <br><br> I'm Fine! <br> I'm okay! <br> So! <br> Don't come any closer... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why is he gay <br>Because "we want to be progressive"</br></br>  <br>I can get behind this.</br>  <br> Shigaraki kills Allmight <br> but he feels like crap </br></br>  <br> Even when he is about to die he cares about Ochako's safety <br><br>BASED DEKU</br></br></br>  <br> Shigaraki's face </br>  <br>You're right. So, what about covering two of his fingers with two different pair of clothing?</br>  <br>Makes sense. He could even where individual cups on each finger.</br>  <br>The guy is Iceman (I think), the girl is Jean Grey (I think), and he's gay because progressiveness and it's not at all insulting for a character's sexuality to be changed just to fill a box on a checklist.  I mean, come on, make new characters instead of just slapping new labels onto the established ones like a fresh coat of paint. </br>  <br>16<br><br> Oh so somebody was accompanying you afterall <br><br> Sorry sorry <br><br> Well it's time for me to leave <br> You should clearly know what will happen if you attempt to catch up with me right? <br><br> Deku! <br><br> Cough cough!! <br><br> [Coughing intensifies] <br><br> Wait... <br> Shigaraki...! <br><br> 「All For One」's intent <br><br> What is it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Gookscans come out right after I go to sleep <br> By the time I wake up, chinkscans are already TLed <br><br>Oh well. My TL would probably be pretty shit anyway</br></br></br>  I wonder if No.13 also killed his parents when his quirk awakened. He seems kind of traumatized.  <br>OH SHIT</br>  <br> ochako is so shocked she almost slips back into her hillbilly accent <br><br>Cute</br></br></br>  <br>I can literally hear gomen gomen when I look at his face in the top panel.</br>  <br>Deku sure doesn't beat around the bush.</br>  <br><br>Did Deku just blew his cover as OFA's current holder?</br></br>  <br>Is that you, Venom?<br><br>I hear it in Shinichiro Miki's voice for some reason</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much.</br>  <br><br>Shigaraki doesn't talk like he knows about OFA really.<br><br>Shit, if I knew that I'd blab about it the first time I ran into him. Revealing All Might's greatest secret to the world would be a great way to ruin him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Yes he did. Even if shigaraki failed to make the connection, AFO will definitely know what's up. Dammit, Deku. This is why oversized balls can be a liability.</br>  <br>17<br><br> Huh? You said... <br> Shigaraki... <br><br> Even I don't know <br><br> Anyways you should look out for yourself more <br><br> Next time we meet will probably be when I decide to kill you </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I was the guy who said he'd TL the Korean scans if we got them first this week<br><br>So much for that</br></br></br>  <br>And now Ochako knows, too!</br>  <br>DEKU NO</br>  <br>shit, Deku. Now you will get that Gravity pussy.</br>  <br>Only if AFO has told his underlings all about the whole OFA story of him and his brother, All Might, and all that stuff.<br>He might keep the connection to himself.</br></br>  <br>I'd be pissed. The girls being healthy and not stock figure tit monsters is partly what makes them all so great. Honestly them fucking with character design would definitely take away from the show.</br>  <br> You seem pretty cool Deku, don't go the Yuuei tomorrow </br>  <br>18<br><br> An intent to kill without conviction is pointless <br><br> No matter if it's faith or ideals... <br> I've had it from the very beginning my dear Hero Killer <br><br> Not once has it changed! <br><br> But from now on my actions will be closely linked with them...! <br><br> I'm going to 「Create a world without All Might <br> Proving to the sheep that what they call justice is such a fragile thing」 <br><br> From this day forward this will be <br><br> My belief </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, Liquid then<br><br>Speaking of which, how does Deku know Shigaraki works with AfO?<br>A hunch?</br></br></br></br>  <br> A hunch? <br>Probably.<br>Im a lot more suprised about the fact that Shigaraki knows about the name of the quirk. Or does the guy literally call himself AFO?</br></br></br>  <br>Aw, Deku healed him and now he will be twice as dangerous (maybe more), great job hero</br>  <br><br>I don't think AfO has transferred his power to Shigaraki.<br><br>I even think that AfO will give his power to someone unrelated to Shigaraki, making him mad in the proces, and killing AfO by himself</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause hands had noumu</br>  <br>19<br><br> Herro herro <br> Is this the police station?! <br> The enemy has shown his face! <br> Yes the location is at Kiyashi-Ward... <br><br> The only ones that can kill me are "Real Heroes" <br><br> &gt;Please call heroes here immediately <br><br> All because of  <br><br> All Might <br><br> A twisted determination, <br> Rising from the ashes---!! <br><br>No. 69 End<br><br> I'm so cold somebody send help. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ie because of you? <br>Yep I agree with you. I think Shigaraki is just one stage for Deku to mature and there will be a lot more villains</br></br>  Hands looks way better when he's not consistently face palming  <br> Kaminari is with Ashido again <br>Better than Kaminari x Kyouka for sure.</br></br>  <br>thanks for the translation.</br>  <br>ochako not being a retarded girl decoration is refreshing.</br>  <br>Dress in layers, put on thick socks, drink something nice and warm.

He needs to gather his courage back and help this poor girl with her problems.<br><br>Then she can have a normal life not hounded by Alphamon.</br></br></br>  Why did Toei have to push Daisuke to the side? I mean, I can understand why they would do that to Miyako and Iori since they'd just be waiting precious airtime, but Daisuke could've really be a valuable asset to their group. It just sucks that we're going to have to wait right until the end to see him kick some ass.  <br>Yeah, that too.

People can attack him on this front, as once you're scoured on one spot of sexual deviancy, it's easy to start rumours on other taboos.</br>  <br>He has a pet t-rex, you really see anyone attacking him on any front?</br>  <br>Yes, the verbal front.</br>  Hey guys, what do you all think of me?  <br>There is a startling difference between befriending one species of an entirely new creation you want to claim is worthy befriending and having an illicit relationship with your own sister.</br>  Reminder of my Adventure partner.<br><br><br>Guilmon is my favorite dino/dragon partner.

Hopefully not in Movie 2 as Jou and Mimi needs his own story.</br>  <br><br>Shit, because lazy recolors a shit, specially emo recolors</br></br>  <br>Literal shit. Served zero purpose to the story.<br><br>Wasted voice actor performance both in English and Japanese</br></br></br>  <br>Not even the fujos like him man. He is literally the least liked Digimon protag in history. Someone post the polls</br>      <br>Daisuke's more popular than Miyako, Iori, Ryo and Wallace combined. But time and time again it has been proven that Nips love their edgelords which helps explain why Yamato was rated higher than Taichi.</br>  <br> Trying to fit the 02 kids into something that they clearly have a movie per two people plan for <br><br>Just let them be ded or knocked out in the void or whatever. It actually adds more to the mystery of the story having them be out of the action than having them in.</br></br></br>  <br>Why can't the original can't be as strong as faker? Wargreymon does nothing but jobbing ever since Apocalypmon died.</br>  Are there crests to every egg? Does that mean there's some edgelord going around with the crest of darkness, and it's only triggered by being edgy as fuck?    Jack is fucking crazy  sanji is the best character  No other thread?  <br>No, no otter thread, just OP talk allowed</br>  Yawn, Wake me up when Luffy Gear 4th's the Shit outta him. heck he'll probably only need Gear 3.  So Nami blew the gas away and Chopper nursed the minks to health?  King mink got btfo by Jack. Mink army got btfo by poison gas.   Jack straight up nuke the fuck out of the minks    &gt;Oda introduces intimidating as fuck character <br> &gt;probably can tank hits like nobody the strawhats have ever faced before <br> &gt;instantly /a/ thinks he's a jobber </br></br>  Ace a cute  <br>Anyone think that Jack might have a speech impediment or something? I think he has a thing against talking.</br>  <br>When a charcter seems so powerful nearly invincible, then one of the SH would come out as their natural enemy, and will have a natural advantage or the high ground in the fight.<br><br>Perona - Usopp<br>Enel - Luffy<br><br>So maybe Jack will be scared AF of Chopper because he thinks he is a giant mouse or some shit like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They say that because Wanda said they had the upper hand, which makes sense because they're used to fighting in the forest. But they still lost and got tortured. <br><br>I noticed that when the minks attacked the Pleasures, they were still smiling even after they were hit</br></br></br>  <br>The few lines he has in this chapter doesn't indicate any different pattern in his speech.</br>  <br>I like it<br><br>Itll be more interesting than luffy just smashing him with gear 4.<br><br>I honestly think zoro will fight him if anyone is going to fight him at all on zou.</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that doffy and doffyfags got epic BTFO<br> mfw they were btfo so hard they don't dare speak up anymore <br><br>sorta like the sabo's dead the data book said so guys</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so, he just doesn't bullshit around. Kind of like Crocodile, but with more power.</br>  jack confirmed for shit <br>can't even destroy a single country</br>  3 Calamities kinda sounds like the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, especially with this drought stuff.<br><br>I wonder if X Drake is one of them and who the other one is.<br><br>Maybe we'll get another cool Ancient Zoan.<br>Sabretooth tiger anyone?</br></br></br></br></br>  Ahahhahah, Zoro's just like "I knew this shit would happen from day fucking one".<br><br>Man, I love this guy.</br></br>  <br>Even if Wanda was right she was speaking in collective terms. Even so, why would you take what a character says as 100% fact?</br>  <br>did Doffy touch you in a bad place?</br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br><br>Oda gives a lot of his characters quirks. I find his "no talking" stance mad suspect.</br></br>  <br>Your bait is weak</br>  <br> doffyfag <br>looool</br></br>  <br>This might sound weird but I can see Sanji and Absalom teaming up against a calamity. No idea why but I just have a feeling.</br>  <br>When he says "we're no here to have a conservation" he means he's not going to negotiate.</br>  <br>Nobody got 'BTFO' but the retards who thank the victory of a protagonist from a shonen manga was unexpected.</br>  <br>Bobbin on the other hand casually destroyed a country for Big Mom.<br><br>Kaidou confirmed weakest Yonkou crew.</br></br></br>  <br>he's just some shitty kaido underling</br>  <br>For Luffy to call someone strong means he considers them on his own level, or, historically, stronger than himself (Rayleigh). So someone as strong or stronger than Luffy already lost to Jack.</br>  <br>Luffy has lost before and there was bunch of people on the island who could take Doffy down (Issho, Sabo, Burgess, Hakuba, Chinao)</br>  <br>To be fair, Luffy does lose a lot. He got instantly chucked into water due to his own stupidity and would have drowned. Crocodile, Lucci, Sabaody, Impel Down, Marineford. Even against Caesar. <br><br>Just saying.</br></br></br>    <br>You're not even trying.<br><br>You're better off complaining about Sheepshead.</br></br></br>  <br>For all we know Jack is stronger than Marco.</br>  <br><br> a character asserts his dominance by refusing to parley <br> the first thing that to occurs to an OP autist is that he has speech impediment </br></br></br>  <br>what des the average usopp fag look like</br>  <br>How strong are the Minks compared to other armies of mooks in One Piece? Even the kids have electricity + martial arts.<br><br>Here's what I think<br><br>Kamabakka Okama masters &gt; Sugar's immortal headcracker army &gt; General Zombies = Gifters &gt; Minks &gt; Amazon Lily's Haki villagers &gt; regular Zombies &gt; Hody's fishman forces &gt; Pleasures &gt; regular armies of marines/pirates</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how do we know that?<br><br>I think so too but Id like to know where you see proof</br></br></br>  <br>Is this a c.uck joke or "black people love Sanji" joke ?</br>  <br> for all we know <br>It's not known my point was just that yonko underlings can be strong, and this one definitely is via the proof that Luffy called someone he defeated strong.</br></br>  <br> Issho <br>Not really. Doffy would never put his social place and the safety of his family in the line if he isn't confident that he can at least pretty badly hurt Fujitora and incapacitate him. His meteorites were nothing to him while Law shat his pants.<br> Sabo <br>Nope. Sabo won against Burgess (a retard) and his new with his flame power. He didn't want to push his luck and go all out against Fujitora because he didn't want to risk heavy injuries. Luffy knows his power perfectly and was a better match against Doffy.<br> Burgess <br>Ah ah, very good joke.<br> Hakuba <br>Yes, because speed is clearly very useful against Doffy. Are you completely nuts? Even Robin said 'Fuck you' to Hakuba and Doffy is miles beyond Robin in terms of 'Fuck you, stay right here.'<br> Chinjao <br>In his prime, maybe. Now, Doffy is just too much agile and proficient with his power for him to strike hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look man, if Oda gave a fuck about this guy he would have put more effort into hyping this dude up. <br><br>Just compare Jack's treatment to Weeble. You can tell who Oda gives more fucks about.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think the duke is going to be an ungrateful prick like that. Apparently it's not just the Sanji crew that he's thanking so it's most likely something to do with Luffy kicking Caesar's ass or taking down Kaido's supplier.</br>  Reminder that wb had to defeat all the other yonko to be titled the strongest man in the world, and he jobbed to Kizaru multiple times.  <br> citation needed <br>We have no idea whether any of the characters you listed could have defeated Doflamingo, except:<br>Hakuba - Lost to Robin<br>Burgess - good one mate<br>Chinjao - Defeated without gear 4<br>who certainly could not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sky warriors also, they werent that weak<br><br>also, regular marines&gt; bounty hunters</br></br></br>  <br>Kizaru couldn't even beat Marco. Kizaru basically waited till Whitebeard had a seizure or took massive damage from outside forces, blasted him, and then ran away.</br>  <br>Fucking speed readers it was states the furries would have won if jack didn't use ceasers weapon</br>  <br>What's wrong with his Tusks?</br>  Man, I'm really loving the minks.  <br>It states that their army would have won, not that king mink would have beaten Jack 1v1. Caesar's weapon is AOE.</br>  <br>Relevant characters don't generally have quirks when in serious mode. The only exception I can think of is Sanji refusing to hit Kalifa.</br>  <br>Hol up<br><br>u be sayin<br><br>If i become a sanjifag<br><br>I'll be druwning in pussy or sumthang?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True, I think the Skypeians might could equal or slightly exceed Hody's average fish thug and Enel's divine soldiers (the sheep things) just below that.</br>  <br>You're saying the SAME THING as the other poster you replied to. Reading comprehension problem, m8?</br>  <br> Hakuba - Lost to Robin <br>Highly debatable. She only stopped him because she had enough time to see him coming.</br></br>  <br>also ine one piece you can "lose" to weaker people due to unfortunate match ups and luck, the only reasons why luffy defeated crocodile and enel</br>  <br>I don't get it. Jack is consistently shown as an insane rager and violent prick. Of course he's not going to have a peacful fucking conversation with some nobodies.</br>  Not really. He's just big.  <br> For you </br>  <br>Enel losing to Luffy was raw plot armour, nothing more. Considering Enel can basically see what Luffy is going to do before Luffy does it, he should've known that he was going to throw the golden ball at him stupidly fast and been able to just zap somewhere else.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't we think he's jobber when he's already jobbed once? He hasn't shown anything impressive.</br>  <br>I don't think she'd be able to do that to Zoro, considering Fujitora couldn't.</br>  <br>Like normal people that is smart enough to don't use 4chan or facebook memes</br>  <br>I thought the same thing, but I have a head canon for that, though it's kinda ridiculous:<br><br>When luffy was about to punch him, enel decided to dematerialize once the ball came close, but as soon as it touched the electricity, he discharged due to gold being an extremely good conductor, and his real body became vulnerable</br></br></br>  <br>You're right, that was fucking retarded considering Enel had shown himself to be able to straight up move through an amount of gold that the ball was only a fraction of with no problems.</br>  <br>i wish someone would have asked oda what's up with that, so he could at least pull something out of his ass</br>  <br>To be fair, it comes down to the match up, like he was saying. Zoro is insanely strong physically. Cavendish is quick as a motherfucker but his feats of strength kinda lack.</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br/></br></br></br>  <br> Even if he might be pretending to be Japanese <br>This is important.
