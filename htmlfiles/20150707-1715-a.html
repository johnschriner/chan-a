Very low-tech humans to that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't want the robots to learn magic</br></br>  Also once you can confirm what is on the other side (that being an army of humanoid creatures) you could send in drones with bombs and shit to clear the way for your actual forces and prevent nearly all causalities.<br><br>Japs really do enjoy killing themselves as long as they have MUH HONOR.<br>That's why America is the strongest military power, we will totally play unfair if it means saving our own skin. <br>Now if this were China, it'd make some sense.<br>Why spend money on tech when you have a gigantic population to waste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even china would send drones first</br>  Japan finally has a way to show it's military might, of course they'll take advantage of it.<br>Besides, what else is the JSDF going to do?</br>  <br> Huh, humans did come out of the other side. Very low-tech humans to that. <br>Would you risk your life on the assumption that just because some guys look similar to you on the outside, they have the same inside? While knowing he came from effectively a different dimension?</br></br>  <br>What if the drones are captured by the low tech humans and then replicated using some replication/manipulation magic? Better to send some humans first.</br>  <br> Japan finally has a way to show it's military might, <br>Showing that you enjoy throwing away your people's lives when you don't have to for the same result comes across as really threatening and not stupid at all. Yep.</br></br>  <br> on the assumption that just because some guys look similar to you on the outside, they have the same inside? <br>Pretty sure they left plenty of corpses to check out.</br></br>  <br>drones can selfdestruct</br>  <br>Sure fine I can concede the point that they could be confident they would breathe on the other side.<br>Still doesn't make sense to risk lives when you don't have to.</br></br>  <br>With thinking like that, you could be a general in Japan's Army!</br>  <br><br>Add to them the rest who got captured alive.</br></br>  <br>Dude those guys massacred civvies and even took prisoners to sell as slaves. People would be out for blood and begging to be sent there.</br>  <br> Add to them the rest who got captured alive. <br><br> performing experiments on foreign humans <br>Japan would never think of such a dishonorable act!</br></br></br></br>  <br>They wouldn't have known that there were empires behind the gate if they didn't make some investigation and interrogation first with the captured soldiers</br>  <br>They don't have to go full Unit 731 to learn from living subjects, you know?</br>  <br>This just proves my point then that Japs are suicidal.<br>Why would you risk your life to get revenge, when you could fucking send in a drone armed with all sorts of explosives, to kill the same creatures, while jerking yourself off watching on your couch at home?<br><br><br>You are assuming:<br>- They can communicate with them<br>- The captured individuals would talk<br>- They would believe them<br>And even if all that was true, why would you still not send a drone to confirm all of that BEFORE risking lives?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some anime-tier logic</br>  <br> Why the fuck would you risk lives when you can have drones/rovers do the scouting and confirm that humans can even fucking breathe on the other side. <br><br>Monster. <br><br>Girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the early to mid 2000s, there's a bush parody in office and a Koizumi lookalike as the Jap PM.</br>  <br> send in HUMAN scouts <br> don't hear back from scouts <br><br>the scouts found catgirls and are trying to keep them for themselves!</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only rational answer from a jap perspective in this thread<br><br><br>Are you dumb?<br>We had unmaned drones in space in the fucking 70s.<br>Here in case you don't believe me<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover<wbr>_(space_exploration)</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a show where the Romans got teleported to modern day for no reason and then decided to slaughter everything with dragons for no reason. Logic is the last thing you should be expecting.</br>  Did you expect a cute girl?<br>Too bad, it is I, space snek Obama</br>  <br>I expect realism, not verisimilitude</br>  <br>Even with drones you need boots on the ground. And shit, aside of curbstomping the oppostion the JSDF pretty much has gained support from the special area simply by treating them humanely.</br>  I can tell this is gonna be the show with the shittiest trolls.  <br>It has been that way since the manga started getting transtaled.</br>  First off, the humans who came through the gate could breathe just fine so it is a fairly safe assumption that you can breathe on the other side too. Furthermore, there are plenty of bodies to examine and prisoners to "debrief".<br><br>Second, unless the translations I read and my rough understanding of Japanese are wrong they don't explicitly say that the scouts didn't return, all they say is they don't know what to expect on the other side.<br><br>Third, sure they could send a bomb through or blow up the gate but they explicitly say they consider the land on the other side part of Japan. They are going through to occupy and conquer.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Even with drones you need boots on the ground <br>Not to fucking scout.<br>My point is, as pointed out by OP pic, they clearly don't have a full mapping of what is on the other side.<br>With drones you could do that, then clear the way to assure nearly zero causalities.<br>So the Japs must enjoy killing themselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> JSDF <br><br>Piss themselves at the mere idea of China invading them?</br></br></br>  <br>Dem kaijus mang</br>  <br>First point see<br><br><br>Second point see<br><br><br>And for your third point, you do realize there are bombs that are strong enough to kill exposed humans but not irreparably damage the soil right? And that those are also cheap bombs?<br>You are going to have to clear that army somehow. Why do it by risking the same people you plan to have occupy?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> don't hear back from scouts <br>What.</br></br>   Since thr gate sppeared in Japan, thr land beyond it is Japan too <br> Therefore we can legally invade it with the JSDF! <br><br>That is some twisted political finagling.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, I fucked up all over the place with my spelling.</br>  <br>Why are Gaijins so BAKA?</br>  <br> invade it <br>You missed the entire part of the not-Romans invading downtown Tokyo?<br><br>Which does beg the question of why they didn't just pour ten feet of concrete in front of the Gate and be done with it.  But Rory's comments about Hardy might mean another gate would open. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats how the majority of nations would handle it.<br>There could billions or trillions of dollars of unclaimed resources. Of course the first nation ti discover is going to attempt to claim it.<br>It's also why America would help, to get its share</br></br></br>  <br><br>They barely explained anything, with the time skips we had about 5 minutes before they entered the gate. Based on just the anime we don't know shit about how any of that works. It seems really stupid to assume that the characters are acting stupid based on practically nothing.<br><br>And to follow up the third point, how would they know that the enemy are camped right around the gate? Would you accidentally destroy the gate with the bomb? Will there be splashback through the gate? How long does it take to activate and deactivate the gate? Again you're assuming everyone is stupid when we haven't been told enough to even know if they are being stupid or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see Gou'uld vs JSDF. <br> YAMANTO DAMASHI vs JAFA KREEE! </br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're replying to, but had to come in and say that wow you are dumb.<br>You can answer all of those questions if you just think about them for literally a second.<br>The army was shown to be a good distance away from the gate. Not all bombs are atomic or nuclear level asshat. And even then, you could have a drone with simple machine gun + heat sensor combo to kill them off with no damage to the gate.</br></br></br>  I don't think they confirmed that the scouts aren't doing well on the other side.  <br>You brushed aside my points without countering them good job.<br>I like how just because you cant think of a solution off the top of your head you assume their isnt one.<br>It's trivial to determine their outside the gate.<br>Have a little robot car with an airpline style black box recoreder attached to a steel cable.<br>They clearly don't have the technology to break that on hand so you can pull it back once the robot stops moving (which means it ran into an enemy).<br>That is a crude as fuck solution i thought of off the top of my head. Japan has plenty of geniuses at its disposal to come up with better ideas.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The gate causes severe electromagnetic interference, rendering signals communication useless. Sending cabling and setting up communications requires people, so obviously scouts would be sent first.<br><br>I'm fucking lol'ing at your comments though, burgerland sends out your boys to pointlessly get blown up by roadside bombs in order to secure resources and to gain geopolitical leverage. You're retarded if you don't think soldiers are anything but disposable, ESPECIALLY in a situation like Gate.</br></br>  <br>You have a serious hardon for drones.</br>  So is this like Stargate SG1?  <br>Because that's not the story they're telling. I don't think we've even seen unmanned warfare in this universe. Go back to /tv/, Frodo.</br>  <br><br>You're not thinking at all. Until they went through the gate and saw the enemy they had no idea where the enemy were. They considered it possible they were waiting on the other side but they had no real time intel.<br><br>Who cares if it's nuclear or not? A bomb big enough to blow up an army is large enough to destroy the structure housing the gate.<br><br>Also no one would send in a drone blind like that, no military in the world would relinquish control in an unknown situation just to avoid risk to their soldiers. We use unmanned drones because we can control them and use them for intelligence gathering.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well considering the Japs are the inventors of seppuku and kamikaze attacks are you really surprised?  <br>Because it's a fucking portal to another dimension. All sorts of people are interested in it and in what's on the other side. Plus that sounds a lot like ignoring the invasion, which wouldn't go over well. Plus they don't know that the other side couldn't break through.<br><br>Basically, that's an awful idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but replace the ayy lmaos with monster girls</br>  <br><br>Oh? And does activating the gate send off a magical alarm or even just glow really brightly? Is the intelligence gathered worth giving up the advantage to deploy and establish a beachhead? Also the gate isn't one way, lose the initiative and you have a bottleneck which is an even worse way to lose troops.</br></br>  besides, you're assuming JSDF tech is the best in the world. It's not.  This whole thread is basically anon bitching why Japan don't deserve to hold control of the gate and should just give control over to the USA  <br>Every nonjap power in the mango is a pretty much a SatMorning Cartoon villain desiring the gate for themselves.</br>  <br> anime shows us infantry and manned vehicles <br> WHY DIDN'T THEY USE THEIR DRONES? <br>Have you guys ever heard of fiction before?</br></br></br>  Does the signal even go through gate? What's the point sending drones if you can't even control them on other side.  <br> What is House Formal? Who is Myui? <br><br><br>Too many people in these threads are viewing the series as a military story with fantasy overtones, when it's the reverse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's also possible that the tech won't relay back properly. Basically it's just a hunk of metal and not a drone.</br>  <br>They only establish signals like internet connection after etablishing completed territorial control over the gate</br>  <br>makes me wonder what would happen if Tom Clancy wrote this</br>  <br>shielded wire through gate, set up just on the other side of the gate. problem solved</br>  <br>I think in one of the early chapters Itani mentions that  they finally got their cell phone working when he was checking the news on it. <br><br>If aerial signals are a no go, couldn't they just lay a cable?</br></br></br>  <br> Principality of Zeon entered the gate first <br><br>Why didn't they bring Zakus into Italica in the first place?</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you making shit up?<br>They have reports back from recons. It was clearly mentioned. <br><br>Is this some kind of troll thread to see how many morons gets trolled?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Fuck you. It could've been done well like how it is in Zipang. Shit here is handled half-heartedly. <br><br>Honestly, it wouldn't just be the SDF reservists going in, but noooo... the author had to write it off cause furries.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Still need to send personnel over to make that wired connection first, mate.<br><br><br>I find it funny that the anime added shit that wasn't included in the manga, like this scouting stuff.<br>Also, think about it logically as other anons have pointed out, how will you control your scout drones/robots without getting a connection through first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be twice the silly and half the fun. Gate is, happily, a fine balance of silly and fun.<br><br>Really, it's best to take the story at face value and just roll with it.  I skip right through all the geopolitics.  </br></br></br>    <br>Can't wait for the rage when we see how the anime butchers them like Rori.</br>  <br><br>Well they could have send some automatic drone with cable on the other side first to establish connection for other drones and cameras, but there was not guarantee it wouldn't be destroyed 10s after crossing gate. Would be less risky too.</br></br>  <br>Guess I suck cocks.</br>  <br>If only humans had experience with sending remote-controlled probes on wires out into dangerous places.</br>  I'm mad at the fact that YP is making Spyro quit<br>but the reactions are funny as fuck</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  He didn't say that he quit yet, calm down.<br/> </br></br>  Just let it die Anon.<br>Translations will come soon then actual discussion can begin.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!

Still though, it's just one of those things where she'll win anyways, because it's obvious from the start, so I don't get why he'd be worried about his waifu losing or anything</br>  <br>Irohasu~</br>  <br>It's not that, he was just disillusioned at seeing moeblob Yukino.</br>  <br> yukino winning <br>Incoming surprise  Sagami  end</br></br>  <br> THK's shitposting and "opinion" <br>Literally worthless.</br></br>  <br> implying WW can't asspull harder than the sun. </br>    <br>I was under the impression she fell out of love with him.</br>  <br>Nah, it's pretty obvious that the winner will be sensei<br>8man even said he'd marry her if no one else did so</br></br>  <br> likes Yui <br> likes Megumi <br> likes Silver <br><br>Say what you want about his shitposting, his taste is exquisite.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bottom of barrel Yukinofag <br>You're worthless.</br></br>  <br>It's understandable. Yukino turned into literal shit.</br>  <br> moeblob mode, the only thing that makes Yukino different from other Generic 10/10 Long Black Hair School Ace Ice Queen Heroine is a negative to the most prominent Yukinofag <br>what</br></br>  <br>People love dem stereotypes.</br>  <br> turned into <br>heh</br></br>  <br> None are best girls <br> Silver is the absolute worst bitch <br>THK's taste is shit, m8.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you people even argue about the taste of a boogeyman?</br></br>  いろはす～  <br><br>Megumi being best girl is indisputable. You have to have literal shit taste to think otherwise. Silver is slightly arguable, but you could make a decent argument for Pink being best. Yui is probably the weakest link but still solid.</br></br>  Brothers?  Why didn't 8man pin Yukino down against her will and used her pussy like his personal cock holster?  <br> personal cock holster <br>Well at least you're being creative this time, try a bit more succinct</br></br>  <br>Who would?</br>  <br>Nekohasu~</br>  <br> friendship end. <br>I would not watch the ED just to say I dropped this show.</br></br>  <br>No matter what happens, I will always love Saki. The real Saki.</br>  <br>Meganesu~</br>  Think Vol 7 Yuki was quite good as character. Wish we could have seen more of this hair though  <br>Still here.<br><br> http://imgur.com/a/VuMzL </br></br></br>  Threesome end can't happen because it's the easy way out. A fucking cop out so to speak ans therefore it's not genuine. They need to sort their problems and come up with the result that prioritize what they want, but this is impeded by Yukino's lack of capability in having her own wants in the first place. Basically this all boils down to Yukino being broken the fuck out and there would be no consensus until she can decide for herself what she wants without being manipulated by any bitch and whoever don't get the 8dick would just have to move on.  If 12 is the last one, what are the chances FEEL makes an OVA in tandem with the release of it  <br>Friendship end would be a cop-out, Threesome end would just come off like a cop-out because there's no way Watari could handle it properly.</br>   mfw Yui and Yukinon realize they love each other   <br> against her will </br>  <br> Yukino <br> will </br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> pussy </br></br>  <br> Yukino </br>  <br> Yuki </br>  <br> Yu </br>  <br> Yukino loves pussy <br> Yui loves bitches <br>seems about right</br></br></br>  <br>I would rather have this show becoming Bara and having Hachiman ending with a guy than a friendship ending.</br>  <br>Don't fucking insult Sable he's a manly man</br>  <br> Sable <br> Manlier than Kamakura </br></br>  <br>Kamakura looks like a fucking faggot<br>look at that face he's basically asking for dick<br><br>Sable is dignified and intelligent which is why he realized the hopelessness of his existence and tried to commit suicide</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the face of a faggot. Kamakura looks like a friendly trickster, willing to humour people, but never going too far.<br><br>On the other hand, Sable just looks kinda mean and also dumb. No wonder he ran out on the street. My friend Kamakura would never have done such a stupid act.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're both off the mark in a number of ways.<br><br>Sable's sharp gaze and furrowed brow speak of a master tactician. He knew his owner would face trouble later in life without a man who could protect her from the more sinister elements of human society, and he instantly recognized 8man as the perfect candidate by his baleful fishy gaze. From there it was just a matter of Sable making a small gamble with his own life to put the pieces in motion.<br><br>Kamakura is a wily one though- from that face he's probably the sort of tomcat who'll be related to half the feline population of Chiba by the end of his days. That's the secret of why he's so distant with 8man these days; the little guy is disappointed in his owner for having less than zero game, and disappointed in himself for not being more help in cultivating said game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamakura is that guy who acts retarded and when he's told he's retarded goes "I was just pretending hurr"<br><br>Sable looks mean but he's actually pretty cute, nice biased image, you could have used any of his other art<br><br> also dumb <br>[CITATION NEEDED]<br>How the fuck can you prove that running in front of the car wasn't part of his plan to hook Yui up with 8man? That's right, you can't. <br><br>If Kamakura actually cared about 8man he would have done something instead of being autistic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/0<wbr>7/06/kotobukiya-yukino-yui/<br><br>I dont know how to feel</br></br></wbr>  This thread is going well.  <br>HOPE</br>  <br>I concur</br>  <br> dar shit anime design <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Is your damn right mouse button broken and you can't click save or somethin' nigga?<br><br>I'm with Spyro though. Was dragging my ass on preordering Yui but now I gotta have her and Yukino too.</br></br></br>  8man won't choose because he has already made up his priorities. As far as romance go, he already "chose" in vol 6 and hasn't changed since (at least from what I can tell in vol 10).<br><br>But people always forget that this series is not all about romance. We'll get at the very least three integral end: character end, friendship end and romance end.</br></br>  <br> If Kamakura actually cared about 8man he would have done something instead of being autistic <br>He knows what he has to do to get his boy a girl, and damn does he do it fine just meowing and shit.</br></br>  <br>Kamakura is a fucking beta male he has no chance with the women. I bet he spends his life on 2ch and mooches off the Hikigayas without doing anything for them. <br>I bet he has a 2D cat waifu and is too scared to kill himself, unlike Sable who would do anything for his owner's cause</br></br>  Wait to translating is kill for years?<br><br>This is some bullshit</br></br>  <br>When Feel redid the S1 scenes, they had them wear their black jackets. I think they look better in them. I'll order both of them regardless however</br>  <br> https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/<wbr>07/06/kotobukiya-yukino-yui/</wbr> </br>  <br>Looks like fucking trash.</br>  <br>You'd be the expert since you see trash in the mirror every day.</br>  <br> Causing trouble for his master by defecating in a highly inappropriate space <br> Relieved to be free of his master during summer and indulging in a fanged, imouto mistress while also being pampered by said mistress's older brother <br> Highly reluctant to return to master's side despite years of care so that the master would not experience another incident of a runaway pet <br> Striking fear into the heart of a poor, lonely, dependency-ridden, socially inept girl while she was trying to enjoy her time at the local pet show <br> Ruining the social life of the mistress's brother through suicidal actions <br><br>Meanwhile, we have Kamakura.<br> Quiet, independent, doesn't cause trouble for his masters by staying out of the way <br> Low maintenance.

It would be harded for them to ensnare their prey if they act like bitches, right?</br>  <br>You clearly don't know what a bully is.</br>  <br>But it's true, anon. Do you even here when Yuifags and Yukinofags justifying their girl's action and Irohafags are nowhere to be seen?</br>  <br> It would be harded for them to ensnare their prey if they act like bitches, right? <br>How's it going Vol. 1 8man?</br></br>  <br>Fucking this. Yukino is just a shitty bully, and 8man is just a pathetic M.</br>  Homura is a person who is harmful to Madoka Kaname development as a human being. Notice that in any universe where there is Homura, Madoka has stayed a <br><br>softie, never realizing her true potential which may be seen in Junko Kaname, a confident and strong woman. This is because Homura is a overprotective <br><br>and does not let Madoka engage in personal growth.<br><br>Mami is also a problem because of her lack of purpose. She presents to the world a hardworking, confident exterior, yet she questions herself because <br><br>of circumstances outside of her control. In questioning herself, she engages in meaningless brooding (sometimes proving fatal) that produces no results <br><br>except pity for her and her huge tracts of land.<br><br>So the question is, who is the best mentor for Madoka?<br><br>I nominate Yang Wen-Li from Legend of the Galactic Heroes.<br><br>Firstly, Yang Wen-Li is lazy. Because he is lazy, he is comfy. Because he is comfy, that means if he mentors Madoka, Madoka won't feel inferior or <br><br>helpless compared to him. That means that Madoka can pick up more of his skills.<br><br>ALSO - For FREEDOM, my captcha was hamburgers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondly, Yang Wen-li is an alcoholic and he also drinks tea. Junko Kaname is also an alcoholic. If Yang Wen-li gets into contact with Junko, that <br><br>means when Junko is drunk she'll give out information about Madoka. That means Yang can use this information to troll Madoka and get her into difficult <br><br>situations that will let her grow. As for tea, the same process can be repeated with Mami in place of Junko.<br><br>Thirdly, both Yang Wen-Li and Madoka stand for FREEDOM. This is because   Homura fucked around with reality in Rebellion and made Madoka live <br><br>in 'MURICA </br></br>  and Yang Wen-li originated from SPACE 'MURICA. This means that they are both accustomed to FREEDOM and therefore their actions <br><br>and mentor and mentored will tend towards eroding Homura fake world which stands against FREEDOM.<br><br>Thus, Yang Wen-Li should be Madoka's mentor because he is comfy, an alcoholic, a tea drinker and fights for FREEDOM.<br><br>Who do you think should be Madoka's mentor?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  eh who gives a fuck  professional shitpost<br>sausage anon</br>  <br><br>Mami is about as good as Madoka could get for a mentor.</br></br>  How do we stop Sayaka from corrupting Kyouko?

Always minding the normal area code, she hesitantly calls him and is disappointed to find out that he hates her as well.<br><br>But that same night, when she recounts the next night’s denial to the boy, he only looks at him with an understanding expression. Before some investigation, she loses out that the boy he called is the same he rose in hate with. In fiction, he does exist in this universe at all. He is the boy’s alternate universe counterpart, who has risen in hate with the MC’s own AU self, who too is unhappily unaware of his crush. <br><br>Good behavior ensues as the one blocks down a disagreement to take each other their lightest, least public secrets in disorder to disarm the other with the weapons they need to surrender the heart of their other selves. While the one flees from their respective hated ones, DRAMA ensues as they cease to rise in hate with each other in addition and answer the NATURE OF HATE.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember America acknowledging that the bombs were war crimes.</br>  <br>Right thread bro</br>  <br> sides have left the stratosphere </br>   You know, this whole "me walking into your bathroom activities" problem would be resolved if you used this amazing invention of mankind called the LOCK <br> Remember that?

I'm definitely not average and I'm sure a great destiny lies ahead of me.    Hey love interest, let's go do something later. We got pretty dramatically cockblocked earlier but our feelings were made abundantly clear regardless so it shouldn't really get in the way of anything.   <br>  I'm completely average in every way. Jim from the class down the hall keeps running into demons and monsters and shit, though. </br>   I got new powers and I fucking love them.   <br>Yeah, but I don't want an  edgelord <br>I just wan't someone who just does this shit to annoying girls rather than  everyone </br></br>   The misunderstanding was resolved in 2 minutes   <br> what is lelouch  <br> what is light </br></br>  <br>  I have this instant-kill, unblockable attack <br>  I'll save it until the very last second rather than use it first and end the fight within thirty seconds. </br></br>  <br>There's also charlottes MC from this season, and that show a few seasons back with the chuuni black flame guy and his club/harem.</br>  <br> not getting the point of the thread </br>  <br>Haven't seen either yet.

Honestly it isn't that big a deal in the 21 century.   <br>this needs to happen<br><br> lonely neet versus the world </br></br></br>  <br>The chunni flame one:<br><br> guy gets ability to summon a harmless and lukewarm fire <br> loves it and treats it like a pet </br></br></br></br>  <br>  Neet hero saves world repeatedly <br>  Gets drunk one night <br>  Gets it on with a girl <br>  Realises his wizard powers are gone the next morning. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Been wanting to watch the fucking show forever since I've finished the manga. <br> Can't find any fucking torrents <br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>I never understood this<br><br>how can "he's nice" even be legitimate reason to fall in love with someone<br><br>last I checked, "nice guys" always get NTRd or freindzoned</br></br></br></br></br>   I am half-Japanese and look completely Japanese   <br>Because anime is self-inserting wish fulfillment. "Nice" is an extremely vague, meaningless term that pretty much everyone thinks they can call themselves. If a girl in anime was attracted to a guy for being hot, or confidant, or athletic it would make otaku feel insecure. But by just liking him for being "nice" the otaku can think "Hey i'm nice. That means if I were in that guys place, she would like me!"</br>  <br>so what are some legitimate reasons then</br>   I fucking love piloting this giant robot   <br>I already listed some.</br>  <br><br><br>"Nice" is a pretty subjective description of someone.<br>In this context, nice is someone who's ideals, actions and looks coincide with what the person perceives as good human traits<br><br>In anime, being kind to others and shit is the ideal and thusly is "nice"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> megas XLR (not anime but still) <br> code geass <br> half the   villan  characters in gundam</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Patlabor.</br>  <br>well list more then<br><br>I still don't understand human relationships at all and I would very much appreciate it if someone were to explain it to me in detail</br></br></br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-06/love-live-film-new-sin<wbr>gle-sets-franchise-record-in-1st-we<wbr>ek-sales/.90148<br><br>Which is the best OTP and why is it RinPana?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>    <br>OTP HonoUmi<br>OT3 KotoHonoUmi</br></br>      <br/>  <br>I wish there were some fanarts of Nico kicking Nozomi's phat ass.</br>    I love Nozomi.<br> But all of the girls are great. </br>  <br>That's not HonoHaru</br>  What are some good episodes for nikomaki?  <br>the rare otp</br>  Where's my Arise movie?  <br>Yes!</br>    <br>leaders can't love leaders</br>  <br> OTP HonoUmi <br>Shit taste.</br></br>  <br>calm down anon. we are all having a good time</br>  <br>Oh yes they can.</br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-07-06/love-live-from-the<wbr>-dead-with-new-tombstone/.90136</wbr></wbr>  <br>Tsubasa is such a side character though.Makes no sense to me.</br>    <br>Considering she knows where Honoka would be, she probably stalks her since 1st season.</br>  <br>They had their moments in S2 and they respect each other (despite being rivals).</br>  <br>This is some /jp/ level shit</br>   Honk   <br>Maybe if they made a version without Hanayo.</br>  <br>this picture contains Honk</br>  <br>Delicious leader is delicious.</br>  Rice  <br> SLUUUT </br>    <br>I'd Honk with Honk</br>    <br>That's a funny way to spell NicoMaki or Eli Me__ <br><br><br>The Mogyutto PV.

Have a cup of tea, put on a NNB episode, sit down and chill out.</br></br></blockquote>]
