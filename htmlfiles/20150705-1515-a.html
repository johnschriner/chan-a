This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris). The orchestral score was performed by the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra. Pretty neat.

But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed? The LoGH remake news got a sticky.</br>  <br>It was</br>  <br> stickying an old series getting licensed </br>  <br>Everybody saw LoGH already, who the fuck cares where it's licensed?</br>  <br>Quite the oblivious faggot you are.</br>  LWA made me realize how much anime costs to make.

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple. We need some other rules.  :^) </br>  <br>I'm no doctor but you might have legit autism Anon</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Do you really not see that you just answered your own question?</br>  They sure put up a fun show.  <br>A lot of TTGL's episodes made /a/ go nuts.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're not getting it. Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it.

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame.

Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old.

You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though.

Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good.

It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it. <br><br>Well, aside from the endorsements (from Hideo Kojima etc), it started out with some well-known people as well, as Studio Kinema Citrus is mostly ex Production IG staff. <br><br>Wikipedia is telling me that Kinema Citrus also did Yuyushiki and Black Bullet, so I'm starting to understand the whole "artistic differences" spat with Creative Intelligence Arts, which was big on the whole "anti-moe" thing. <br><br>Anyway:<br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/2<wbr>2/under-the-dog-getting-an-anime-ki<wbr>ckstarter-back-on-track/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm enjoying it.</br>  <br>Tell me some more how much you don't care.</br>  <br> i can't find myself </br>  <br>I feel kinda sad that the artist had to draw in the shadows for Sucy.

The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  <br>A common mexican name.</br>  If I'm a backer, where can I watch this without torrenting?<br><br>Haven't gotten any emails nor am I seeing anything on the Kickstarter site.</br></br>  <br>ok premise if they had a tv show</br>  Holy shit Akko almost made this unbearable to watch.

I want to bury my face in Sucy's butt though her dress.

SHINY!!! ARCA!!!</br>  <br>That has to be an edit.<br>Don't tease my penis like that.</br></br>  <br>she was adorable</br>  <br>That image was Trigger backpedaling. When you watch the first episode it becomes clear that the dresses are not designed that way.</br>  <br>It's not. You can actually see her bare butt in the episode if you happen to pause it at just the right moment.</br>  <br>Exactly when?</br>  <br>Sensory overload. <br>The wand represents my penis.</br></br>  I just naturally assumed that their school uniforms have some sort of censorship enchantment on them to prevent upskirts and panty shots  <br>A Little Witch Academia without "The Void" it's simply not Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>33:55<br><br>It's near the start of the parade, when Akko is dancing with the brooms.</br></br></br>  <br>That image is fanart.</br>      <br>Literally everyone leaves to go jerk off to Akko's ass. <br><br>Wasn't it from the trigger art book?</br></br></br>  Will Akko ever find out Ursula-sensei is her beloved Shiny Chariot?  Will they have sex?   <br>Akko is a lewd girl that likes to flaunt her booty around.</br>  <br>I bet the third movie will be about Shiny Chariot's backstory and Akko and Diana will finally see eye-to-eye in something.</br>  does anyone have a pic of the scene where Amanda does the broom dance and you can can briefly see her ass? Also, I hope this is popular enough to get made into a series    Was there color turn arounds for all the characters?<br>I need references badly.</br>  Is it me or is Diana kinda obsessed with Akko?  <br>if you look carefully, it becomes obvious that she is wearing panties</br>  <br>its you</br>  <br>Excuse the quality face.</br>  We need a TV series of this so we have more material to scour for loli witch asses.  Is Diana still voiced by the girl who voices Rias Gremory?  Best fucking $110 I ever spent. Thank you based Trigger.  Oh God, I'm super-duper excited and really want to watch it right now, but I'm dead tired.  So this isn't the BDs?    <br>is you</br>  if they are not going to do another kickstarter will they at least sell merch so I can throw money at them that way?  <br>ESPURR!<br>She reminds me of an Espurr. God, it's been bugging me since I watched it.</br></br>    <br>never ceases to amuse me</br>  <br>Yes, Yoko Hikasa.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would really love some LWA merch. I already bought the LWA1 BD off of Trigger's store, but it's not enough.</br>      Nendroid Petite LWA pack with Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Amanda, Constanze and secret Yasumineka.  <br>BEST</br>    <br>I want it!</br>      <br>Thanks nigga.</br>  <br>I want it. I want GSC to make some LWA nendos.</br>      Akko was kind of bitchy in part 2 but it's okay to have a bad day sometimes. <br>I still love you, girl.</br>    <br> that iMac on the left </br>  <br>That does make sense, as much as I don't like petites.<br><br>Gimme a Sucy scale with mushroom base.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't that bad. She got a little grating when she was being selfish about the whole parade, but she's a teenage girl and she's passionate. It happens.</br>  i want to have a ride on sensei's shiny chariot  <br>I still think they could have toned her down a bit</br>  <br>This. In the first half, it seemed almost out of character (compared to the first installment).</br>  The last moments of the episode just screamed Ooshima Michiru's work, so I wasn't surprised when I saw her name on the credits. Based Michiru, making the best soundtracks ever since SnW.   tfw I almost backed the kickstarter but an anon convinced me not to, because the business model was bad for the animation industry or something <br><br>Why was I so stupid</br></br>  <br>the one that did that folk music?</br>  <br>I wasn't able to back it because I had no money at the time. I would have gladly thrown dosh at the kickstarter for all the cool stuff if I had been able to.<br><br>Guess I'll just wait for the BD to be put up for sale.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was it stupid?<br>You got it for free.</br></br>  <br> folk music <br>What? All I know from Ooshima are these big orchestral stuff like you hear in Sora no Woto or LWA.</br></br>  <br>so what percentage of that outfit is life fibers</br>  The cutest witch.  I'm watching Enchanted parade right now. This stuff is Studio Ghibli tier in terms of story telling and near studio Ghibli tier in terms of animation.  <br>I want her to teach me how to dance.</br>  <br>So it's a convoluted mess that looks pretty?</br>  So, if they do a Kickstarter for Little Witch Academia 3, would you donate?<br><br>Assuming similar stretch goals and reward tiers, how much would you donate next time compared to what you donated this time?</br></br>  <br>She did apologize.</br>  <br>I would donate about $50</br>  <br>that fucking gif</br>  <br>I wouldn't go so far in terms of story telling, but I love the art style and it's very refreshing. Characters are also very varied and powerful. I was pleasantly surprised with everything in general. Would donate again for sure.</br>  I want her to tie me down with magic while she   insults my dick and then proceeds to rape me   Was it worth the money you put in?  <br>now that i have some money i will donate!!</br>  <br>Exceeded my expectations. <br>they should have focused on doing a series out of that instead of doing kill la kill imo. This has great potential to become a great series. A shame.</br></br>  I didn't know about this till today, the sticky made me curious and well, it was pretty good, even being that short the story and his little world envelops you, you really care for the characters even when you barely know them, I had a really good time. Is there going to be a full series about it? I would like to see that, all this have lots of potential for more.<br> Sucy best girl! </br>  <br><br><br>I was half reminded of Flash Dance with her routine and was expecting a bucket of water to be dumped on her at the end.</br></br></br>  <br>My nigro.<br>Sucy and Amanda, best girls by far.</br></br>  <br><br>My brothers!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br>I know that Luna means moon in latin, but what is Lana supposed to mean?

Speaking as an artist. </br>  <br>I have faith about they'll make a full serie of this.<br>It was said two or three days ago that Trigger anounced a new anime original, maybe it's LWA.<br>Even if they don't make it we'll still have the Inferno Cop X LWA.</br></br></br>  <br>Lana is wool in italian and spanish, but I doubt it has any relation to it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br> not wanting Sucy's upside-down isosceles triangle body </br>  <br>Same here bro. I didn't know about this series until today either and i was completely drawn in.</br>  <br>Probably enough to get my name in the credits.</br>  <br> Yoshinari will never do a spinoff for his favorite LWA, Diana <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised there were people that haven't seen this yet.</br>  <br>That would be the best news in years. It has enough elements to become a very rich series with lots of stories. It could become an improved version of Shitty Potter.</br>  <br>good post<br><br><br>i commend</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br>  Trigger said that they're working on 3 original things; the next original TV series (some sort of serious-looking show that has Persona-like character designs) a shorter thing for USPTime and another original that is farther on. Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 but for now fixes and retakes for the BD and theatrical release.  My personal ranking:<br><br>Sucy = Amanda &gt; Diana &gt; Akko &gt; the rest</br></br>  <br>It was everything I wanted, but even better than I expected it. Well worth it. Looking forward to the BD and the tons of extras I get with it even more now.</br>  <br>Amanda stole my heart, but that's not particularly dangerous.</br>  <br>She would be part of the main story in a third sequel; this movie set-up the seeds for her and Akko finally teaming up.</br>    <br>I'd rather draw Sucy  or lotte </br>  WIPs.<br>http://i.imgur.com/A7q6j16.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/AjoNZv3.png<br><br>Maybe do more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 <br>Really? I thought he wasn't too jazzed about LWA. IIRC he wanted to do a psychological drama thing.</br></br>  <br>He said it's still not the perfect LWA for him.</br>  <br> lewds of the LWAs <br>For what purpose</br></br>    <br>Doing God's work. Needs more Amanda and overall broom action.</br>  <br><br>Well, if LWA 3 is the Parent's Day it could have all the drama he'd want.</br></br>  <br> More Constance please. </br>  <br>Will /a/ save anime again with LWA3?</br>  <br>Funded in 3 hours or less this time.</br>  <br>Would be funny if the anime industry's western-like studios caught up with Kickstarter's possibilities by watching LWA and started competing for attention with great projects.

Erwin knows a lot and he seems to have many connections, so I'm sure he must have seen Keith with Grisha at one point, right?<br><br>Also, I wonder if his dream has something to do with what could be in the basement, what with that suspicious look Zacklay through at him last chapter.</br></br>  Keith and Grisha are Ymir's people. They are infiltrates.  <br> spinoff <br>Nobody cares. But I'm certain Keith must have some extra info on Erwin we didn't know about. Remember the ACWNR isn't canon, so it's possible Isayama even retcons it.</br></br>  <br>Keith should had only retired after wall maria fell. So it is highly likely erwin was with keith on that day.</br>  <br> so it's possible Isayama even retcons it <br>I doubt it. There would be no reason for Isayama to approve of that shitty spinoff thrice, if he was only going to change the story and waste panels on it.<br><br><br>That's what I'm saying.

Who the fuck is this "stiler"? It's just Anniebot as usual.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't quote me on this, but apparently on that cover Isayama did of Levi for Frau magazine, Armin was originally sitting on his lap with his head against Levi's, looking at the magazine.

The LM cover originally had Armin in Levi's lap. It was the WIP Isayama posted on his blog. Bessastsu edited Armin by the time it was published.</br>  <br><br>No, I don't. And why, what could I have possibly done to warrant that response? <br><br>(I highly doubt you can find my blog via that image, but just in case you can, don't.)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sauce please. Preferably, a link to the post on Isayama's blog.</br></br>  <br>Ok Jumping Giant.</br>  <br>No, the sketch Isayama posted in his blog only had Armin's head floating around like it wasn't meant to be there.

Almost like the circle shitposters are delusional.</br>  <br>kusugu posted update on gif week or two ago.</br>  <br>Honestly I just draw in erratic patterns. I jump from cute stuff to intensely lewd. Like the Mia drawing from earlier. If you put that you don't want lewds I'll respect that and make something cute, which is also along the lines of stuff I like to draw.<br><br>I am pretty much done today. Might stop tomorrow or next weekend.

Thank you for giving my husbando some love!</br>  <br>anon if there is only one set of hands there is no reason for the movement lines</br>  I would appreciate anything of Kurumi.

I think it would be fantastic if there were other people to enjoy the picnic with, but this is entirely up to the drawfriend. <br><br>Alternatively, anything cute or cool is greatly appreciated!<br><br><br>Thank you drawfriend, I will be around this week, and next week, and the week after that, so please take your time and have fun!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not really good at baking, I guess I should try.</br>  How long til shark week?  <br>It's the only thing I'm good at!</br>  <br>Next Sunday is delivery.</br>  Requesting Mizuha!<br>Optional: Wearing a basketball jersey, or holding up a butterfly.</br>  <br>Do you have the list?</br>  <br>Check the archives, he posted a wip.<br>There were a few he left out; but as far as I know there's no definitive list, just "whoever requested at the time".</br></br>  <br> Check the archives <br>Dang guess I have no choice then, thanks for the info.<br> I hope she's still in there, she's never been drawn by Sharkbro before and it was lucky that she even got in there in the first place. </br></br></br>  <br>then post a cake shaped/iced as you're waifu.</br>  <br>Riasfag can actually draw though</br>  requesting this adorable little girl, all skill levels are welcome  Evening /a/!<br><br>Today I'm requesting my waifu dressed as Saber Alter!

I definitely have a soft spot for anything ToG related as well  Have a great weekend!</br>  <br>i think i drew her too fat but here u go</br>  <br>I hope he remembers to thank you.</br>  Friendly reminder that 34 hasn't posted anything yet  Requesting Yutsuki.  <br>Preparing something nice for her friends here I'm sure</br>  Have you accepted that she won't be drawn?<br><br> I have ;_; </br></br>  <br> she was drawn </br>  <br>I think it looks fine, thank you!</br>  <br> Can the Circle just not request next weekend? </br>  <br>I really believe she won't, but I'll be requesting until the end.</br>  <br>She's done drawing wifus and 80% done drawing husbandos because of all the mouthbreathers like  shitposting.<br><br>She's drawn literally every single waifu, two or three times over, and people sitll try to say she's a shitposting circlejerking dark lord of the circle<br><br>I want to stop too but I really like making waifufriends happy even if half of them secretly hate me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much, we gotta show some chin for our waifus even if it means we won't get anything.</br>  <br> I'm new to these threads. What is the circle? </br>  <br>Epic shitposter meme.</br>  <br>So she actually left the threads or is just taking a break this week? I loved her art a lot.</br>  <br>I still hold hope!</br>  <br>She's so toned, hnnng. Almost tempted to request her doing hanging sit ups, just to see those abs in action.  Thanks so much, though! Now, I'm no good, really. But if you'd like, I could try and draw you're waifu as well. I still have to draw a couple I said I would, but haven't had a lot of luck, but I could very well try and squeeze you in there as well! </br>  <br>Aah!<br>So a drawfag.</br></br>  Requesting Pacifica celebrating Independence Day please!  <br><br><br>yeah, hands are hard to visualize without really drawing a lot of them. Think of the pose/gesture the hand might be in and make it with your own, try to take a picture of it or have someone else make that hand pose and you take a picture from the angle you think you'll draw it from. helps get you jump started<br><br>everything else looks great though, keep at it!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and people sitll try to say she's a shitposting circlejerking dark lord of the circle <br>Why would anyone besides the couple retards spamming polygons think that?<br>Hopefully it's just me being dumb, falling in some trick and not actually them thinking so lowly of every poster in here.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish. Nowhere near that good.</br>  Requesting anything of Ayame<br>Like wearing American Flag swimsuit or something America for 4th of July</br>  <br>I've actually never drawn a guy in a bikini before, but the requester gets what the requester wants. First time for everything.<br><br><br>Glad you like it, I'm always up for a request if it's ToG.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's drawn literally every single waifu <br><br>Not mine but that's okay too.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you literally start requesting this week?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Who is your waifu?</br>  <br> animooted qt waifu  <br><br>Whoa and full color too! I can't wait until Sunday night to say goodbye now; thank you  Kusugu?  </br></br></br>  Requesting Josuke barbecuing steak in an apron that says "Kiss the Pomp".  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>tamabro please continue being a qt</br>  <br>Tamabro pls tell me I'm your drawfu. Don't be tempted by that slut Kusugu.</br>  <br>I don't think she has drawn mine yet.</br>   you will never be as loved as Tamabro   <br>At least be thankful no one shits on you.</br>  <br> Tamabro will never come to streams </br>  <br>Who shits on Tamabro? It's impossible not to like him.</br>  <br>I want him to but I don't want to see his name on List-chan's lists. I hate those people and their lists.<br><br>"List of people who were lurking the stream therefore hate their waifus and suck drawfag dicks erryday."<br><br>Actually it was probably Lolyfag, nobody else is that shitty.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean you should be thankful that even if no one gives a shit about you at least no one says shit about you and shitposts about you even if you didn't really do anything.</br>  <br>He's my waifu</br>  <br>If no one gives a shit about me how can I get drawings without requesting like he does?</br>  <br>I request in my own way and still get drawings even though sometimes I don't. Maybe you should just hope?</br>  Requesting a young loli Yuzuko. Anything would be fine though.  <br>glad you like it. thanks for the appreciation but i dont have a waifu, i really sorry. but its enough to know that you are still around. Have a nice weekend and good luck with drawing </br>  <br>I liked him better when he posted, and was quite.</br>  <br> I'm jealous he's well loved in these threads and gets more deliveries than me </br>  <br>Quite what? Finish your sentence.</br>  <br> I liked him better when he posted, and was quite <br>But he does post, and is quite (charming).</br></br>  <br>you're welcome</br>  <br><br><br>Quiet. I didn't know he had his own defense squad.</br></br></br>  Requesting Marisa and Alice watching /a/ as if it were a movie.  <br>Sorry that I like someone you don't. Maybe don't be such a little bitch?</br>  <br>He has his own fanboys and drawfus (like kusugu) in these threads a defense force isn't that far off.</br>  <br>Now you know.</br>  <br>What has he done to you to make you not like him?</br>  <br>Get more deliveries from the WWD best drawfags than him. That and his mother never hugged him.</br>  <br>Well maybe if he smelled better his parents wouldn't be so dead.</br>  <br>maybe if you weren't so whiny you would get more deliveries</br>  <br>Who put Index in this? She looks completely out of place.</br>  <br>don't let jealousy take in anon</br>    Requesting Hibiki in Sabin from Final Fantasy VI's outfit. Alternatively having her in Alex* from SF3's outfit would be nice too. Really anyone who has famously used suplexes would work.<br><br>Sabin reference: http://i.imgur.com/E4nE3Ca.jpg <br>Alex reference: http://i.imgur.com/g7SDOK6.jpg <br><br>*Having an American flag draped over her because Freedom Weekend would be a nice touch.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Nice, Miki. But do skirts have pockets?</br>  <br>If not then they should.</br>  <br>ahahaHAHAHA</br>  Requesting Hatsune Miku wearing a Domino's uniform    <br>Cute.</br>  <br>She looks really cute in that outfit, and I'm really liking those adorable rice balls she has substituted for her antennas is definitely cute! Thank you for drawing her, I really appreciate it.</br>  <br>I thought that was a dick for a second.</br>  <br>I don't like her as much without the wolf ears.</br>   all these cute, quality deliveries <br>H-hope is starting to well up again! But even if I get nothing, good luck fellow waifufags, I'm rooting for you!</br>  <br>Hopefully these fireworks today will cheer me up.  ;_; </br>  <br>Y-you too.</br>  <br> someone steals my request and gets a delivery  <br>im not rooting for nobody they are all scum</br></br>  <br>Yep. All the true waifufags are done</br>    <br>Even if you get nothing, there's always next week.</br>  <br>Unless he gets done in by a car or something during the week, then he's fucked.</br>  <br>How do you even tell which of these guys are "true" waifufags?</br>  <br>He obviously can't, I haven't been delivered yet.</br>  So how do you eat your pancakes /a/?<br><br> I eat mine with only butter </br></br>  <br>I eat mine with chopsticks</br>  Maple Syrup.<br>There is no other way.</br>  Not with syrup that's for sure because I'm not an amerifat that needs to cover everything with sugar  <br>Isn't the syrup supposed to cover the pancake?</br>  With semen.  <br>Plain.</br>  <br>I guess this makes sense. Seems like an odd thing to go out of your way to explain to someone though.</br>   HOTTOKEIKEE not stacked neatly <br><br>TRIGGERED</br></br>  <br>Syrup.<br>Peanut Butter is also good.</br></br>  <br>I don't because I'm not a shameless fatman</br>  I don't remember the last time I had pancakes  <br> eating makes you a fatty <br>I forgot /a/ was full of starving students and third worlders</br></br>  I don't eat breakfast.  Small amount of butter and just a little simple syrup drizzled over it them.  <br>She stacks them after giving them an even coating of syrup.<br>She's got OCD when it comes to pancakes.</br></br>  <br>Only butter... <br>You monster</br></br>  Honey.  I only eat the frozen ones, I put them in the toaster until they are crispy and eat them plain like toast.  <br>You know that's not good for you, right?</br>  Yogurt  <br>Eating pancakes with butter is fatmanfood though. <br><br>I just eat mine with strawberry jam. It's not the healthiest choice but neither are pancakes.</br></br></br>  <br>Lighly salted butter and sweet pancakes, right?</br>  <br> plain like toast <br>but you put butter on toast</br></br>  <br>Yes, I do. But I just don't have an appetite, and it's physically painful for me to eat it.</br>  <br>True, I meant more that I eat them with my hands rather than a knife and fork.</br>   putting three pancakes on top of each other <br><br>Literally retarded. I eat one pancake at a time to savor it.</br></br>  <br> physically painful <br>No it fucking isn't. Stop overexaggurating.</br></br>  <br>They put syrup on them. The point she's making is if you spread the butter across then the syrup will cover the pancakes instead of just soaking in wherever it lands.</br>  With chocolate syrup and nothing more.  This is really making me want some pancakes.  <br>I don't eat pancakes because they make you fat. Instead I eat protein milkshakes for maximum gains.</br>  With strawberry syrup and a sliced up banana.   not putting jam on your pancakes   <br> not having a bowl of steel cut oats for breakfast everyday </br>  <br>In epidemiology it's correlated with unhealthy behaviours, but there's nothing unhealthy about intermittent fasting when done properly.</br>  Melted dark chocolate, whipped cream and strawberry jam.  <br>this</br>  <br>Crepes aren't pancakes.</br>  <br> eating pancakes <br><br>It's just not worth it for the amount of calories. 440 calories for 2 small pancakes with maple syrup.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I do eat steel cut oats for breakfast but most of the time I try to avoid them. I just prefer the shakes.</br>  <br> Caring about calories <br>Jenny Craig pls go</br></br>  <br> counting calories <br>Unless you're fat, no.</br></br>  Salt and pepper, obviously.  <br>nigga if you do at least a minimum amount of physical excersise, having pancakes isn't going to turn you into a hambeast.</br>  <br>Keep telling that to yourself fatty. <br><br>First step is always admitting you have problems.</br></br></br>  I love pancakes!<br>Rub a dub dub!</br>  <br><br> not counting calories and macros <br>Why do you even live if you're going to suck at it?</br></br></br>  <br> protein shakes <br>Literally a meme. Git gud</br></br>  <br> Why do you even live if you're going to suck at it? <br>To watch anime about cute girls. I can worry about my weight when I pass 120 lbs.</br></br>  <br>It's not necesarily about health either. Not eating breakfast can be bad for you in the sense that you become more lethargic during the first hours of the day. You won't really get any energy until you break your fast.</br>   no sugar in the mix and add a bit of water <br> make it thin as fuck <br> sugar <br> lemon juice <br>GOAT</br></br></br></br>   /fit/ refusing to believe anyone can be happy if they aren't obsessed with achieving dangerously low body fat percentages <br> image captcha: "click all the food" </br>  <br>It's the easiest way to stay fit and healthy. It's just a simple physics equation. Energy in, energy out.</br>  How the fuck do you get fat just from eating? Do people have turned of metabolism or what?  <br>That's not true though.<br><br>http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/to<wbr>p-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html<br><br>Further, eating often causes people to be more lethargic, which is why post-prandial naps are so common.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  I eat them as fucking waffles because pancakes are garbage for plebs. <br><br> putting syrup on top making everything soggy <br><br>There are two kinds of people...</br></br></br></br>  <br>440 calories for 2 small pancakes is a lot though. You could eat a healthy breakfast and take a walk or you could eat a dozen sugarladen pancakes and go for a run. You can't blame people for picking the first choice. <br><br>Also, it's really bad to eat sugary foods for breakfast. Eating sugar on an empty stomache is straining your insulin system and you'll end up with diabetus.</br></br></br>  <br> soggy <br>Stop buying shitty, watered down syrup.</br></br>  <br> thin pancakes <br><br>just eat crepes then</br></br></br>  raw  <br> soggy <br>you mean gooey</br></br>  <br>Blueberry maple syrup. Shit is the bomb, yo.</br>  <br>I really don't understand how americans can eat pancakes, eggs, bacon and all this greasy shit for fuckin breakfast.<br><br>Don't you feel sick later?</br></br></br>  <br> How the fuck do you get fat just from eating? <br>No, people just magically wake up fat.</br></br>  <br>No? And its not like Americans are the only people to eat big breakfasts.</br>  <br>Where on that site does it say anything about energy levels due to skipping breakfast? All I can see is "7. Myth: Skipping breakfast is bad and will make you fat." which is not what we where talking about here. <br><br>I can guarantee you that I have less energy in the morning before I eat breakfast and so do the people I meet in the morning. I call baloney on that sites science.</br></br></br>    <br>We were specially marketed that kind of food and now it's engrained in the culture. People's bodies just adapted to it over time,<br><br>I've been off it so long that if I eat anything more than coffee and toast I feel sick.</br></br></br>  <br> make pancake mix with milk <br> add hersheys syrup into the mix <br><br>Made it hard to tell when it was done, but damn if it didn't smell good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a difference between eating decent meals amounting to about 2000 calories a day and stuffing your fucking face like a pig.<br><br>People that don't understand that are either /fit/ super-autists or fat fucks themselves with projection issues.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck those captchas. I'm on a cut and they always make me hungry.</br>  <br>But apparently the Americans are the only people who synynoms big breakfasts with greacy shit...</br>  <br> americans </br>  <br>Few people eat pancakes every day. It's a pain to cook a full breakfast and the cleanup is annoying. <br><br>Having pancakes once every few weeks and will not destroy a diet or undo weeks of exercise.</br></br></br>  <br>No really, explain it to me. Do people think that when they have a cake after dinner that they will pick up 5kg or what? The log of shit they push out in the morning is heavier than the food they ate.</br>  <br>i don't eat pancakes. disgusting carb and sugar bombs are for fatties like OP</br>  <br>And no one claimed it did. What the fuck are you on?</br>  <br>Never seen an English breakfast?<br>Greasy as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Eating like shit with no exercise will make you fat over time, yes. Not everyone has fast metabolisms, I'd even argue that most people don't, judging by America's obesity rates.</br>  Pancakes are a "treat" here and not a staple because they are an "empty calories" type food. <br><br>I don't put syrup on them because they get soggy fast. I never liked eating anything "soggy" or with a soggy texture such as risotto, soggy pancakes, porridge, etc. I like foods to be either dry or chewy. <br><br><br> I only eat the frozen ones, I put them in the toaster until they are crispy and eat them plain like toast. <br><br>I had no idea you could do that. I lower the heat on the griddle (it has multiple heat sections) and move the pancakes over to the low heat section. That way, I toughen them up a little so they are drier and stiffer without burning. That way, the outsides are actually crispy stiff for the first minute or so off the griddle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically every white country eats like that, I wouldn't expect a third world nigger like you to understand.<br><br>See </br></br></br>  <br> Peanut Butter is also good. <br><br>People put peanut butter on their pancakes? I've honestly never seen this.</br></br></br>  <br>That's lunch.<br><br>No one eats beans for breakfast.</br></br></br>  <br>Some people will justify putting peanut butter or jelly on anything.</br>  <br>I've had english breakfast. I was just mocking him for trying to pass of greasy unhealthy foods as a "regular big breakfast that everyone eats".</br>  <br> starting your day by consuming 1000 calorie meal + beverage <br><br>all hail fatainia!</br></br></br>  <br>They specifically eat beans in an English breakfast, anon.</br>  <br><br>Britbongs do.</br></br>  <br> europoor thinks only americans use syrup <br>try harder</br></br>  <br>Britbongs are catching up to Murifats</br>  <br>God dammit who eats pork n beans in the morning? Fucking fat british.</br>  <br>Never had beans on toast? It's apparently an English thing and it's actually quite good.</br>  <br>butter with sugar sprinkled on top<br><br>absolutely scrumptious<br><br>sometimes with a bit of lemon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Canada is part of america though...</br>   poor as fuck, have to eat junk food all the time <br> 64kg </br>  <br>They really do, those fuckers fart so god damn much. All day every day with them.<br><br>In America people fart loudly fucking NEVER outside of middle school, despite the stereotype.<br><br>In Britain those fuckheads are farting and fucking giggling all god damn day.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you squeeze the lemon on top, or what?</br>  <br>TL: Beverage means pint.<br>Pint means 568.26mL of beer.</br></br>  <br> I put a little puddle of syrup on the side and dip the pancake slices into it. Some people find this odd but I don't want any nasty soggy pancakes from them soaking up the syrup.</br>  <br> beans on toast <br><br>God that's fucking disgusting poorfag food.</br></br></br>  <br>yea, the tang is a nice juxtaposition to the sweetness</br>  <br>Chi-chan pls eat healthily.</br>  <br>That's been a traditional English breakfast since the industrial revolution.</br>  Rin is the cutest!  Just think, before Fusion attacked Shun, Yuuto, and Ruri would probably have been major crowd pleasing duelists in their dimension. <br><br>Kuriboh</br></br>  Hey guys remember when Kaiba was legitimately, 100% going to kill himself because Yugi slapped a Mammoth head onto his Ultimate Dragon?

Either way, it's delayed by a few minuetes</br></br>    <br>BETV has a better quality than every stream out there</br>  <br>Second one has logos and shit on it, so I'm watching the first.</br>  <br>Galaxy9000 is about half a minute ahead right now.</br>      Galaxy9000 is ahead by like 20-30 seconds. And has less retards in it.  <br>I'm just glad I don't need to log in to comment.</br>  HAPPENING  That OP was kinda meh.  <br><br>Yeah... pop music has seeped into Dragon Ball.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it was underwhelming.</br>   Toei was too lazy to re-animate the finale of the Buu arc <br><br>Off to a great start</br></br>  that cha la head cha la remix made me tear up ;_;   they skipped the Freeza / Cell / Buu flashback <br><br><br>FUCK YOUUUUUUUU</br></br></br>  So is the episode just an animated version of that new manga chapter that came out?  Mr. Satan voiced by same guy as Old Joseph Joestar. FUCK YEAR  Dat Buu jap voice..  <br>There respecting the original. Hipster style yo.</br>  <br>Kind of, this episode has a lot of extra scenes.</br>   that subtle Super Saiyan God shown in the opening <br>muh dick</br>  oh, i gotta mention dokkan battle<br><br>it absolutely refuses to run if your phone can possibly be rooted<br><br>despite having root disabled, and it hidden with root cloak it refuses to run<br><br>fuck dokkan battle</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So no Super Cyan in DBSuper?</br></br>  <br>enough extra scenes to make it worth a watch.</br>  I can't get used to these Japanese voices. When is the dub?  <br> When is the dub? <br><br>In a year, minimum.</br></br></br>  <br>not until the revival of f arc probably</br>   they are fighting soldiers in frieza armors in the opening <br>so they are really rewrite movie released just like 2 months ago</br>  <br>don't worry, they'll just extend it with absolutely shit tier filler footage and use the movie stuff directly<br><br>also they'll cut out the best scenes and replace it with shit tier filler footage so you still have to get the movie</br></br></br>  ORAORAORAORAORAORAORA  When did Videl become such a softie  <br>They should let Frieza survive, train his golden form more and made something interesting from it.<br>No point to bring back frieza for one, not even that good fight.</br></br>  <br><br>I dunno, the movie was kind of shit. It'd be nice if they made it better, like explain why Gohan jobbed so much, or where people like 18, who was much stronger than any of Freeza's guys, was.</br></br>  <br>The D works wonders.</br>  <br>don't worry, a soldier can just wish him back with the dragon balls again<br><br>they should really keep those things somewhere secure</br></br></br>  Take the shekels, Goku.  <br>I had an image way back that said "he gave that bitch a Senzu bean. Bitches love Senzu beans."<br><br>I can't find it now.</br></br></br>   saves the world <br> makes boogabucks <br>All is right in the world.</br></br>  Toriyamabux  <br>That is a good point, why they are not keeping dragon balls safe, considering that even one bad wish can fuck things up a little.<br>Still better than retarded, GT dragon balls <br> well guys, I made dragon balls that will destryed the earth if they are not collected in the time, sounds pretty cool huh </br></br></br>  This is awesome good  next week super hyped.  Lol the streamer is a mudslime  <br><br>HOLY KEK</br></br>  stupid sexy beerus  <br> Vegeta acting like he isnt enjoying the ride </br>  Boring ass episode.  Pretty much everything I wanted it to be.  So is Goten replacing Gohan as the tertiary character now? Seemed like that now that Gohan has gone full nerd.<br><br>Also, Gohan getting cucked by Goten and Trunks.</br></br>  Welp the animation is great (perfect I'd say), at least compared to the horrible Sailor Moon reboot.<br><br>Every DBZ saga has a slow burn start that ramps up the action as it gets deeper into the antagonist, so really no surprise that nothing much happened in ep 1.<br><br>I already know he's going to fight Beerus because of the movie so... are they just going to reanimate it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>My sides</br>  <br>this would be so much better if bulla was there.<br><br>sigh... this is going to be GT2 isnt it</br></br></br>  Do you guys think that Goku will now be a better dad with this new series?  <br>Why so tsundere, Vegeta?</br>  <br><br> This is bullshit, I wanted to go on the bumper cars </br></br>  <br> dragon ball <br> ever raping up </br></br>  <br>Calm your tits. It's the first episode.<br><br>Of course not. As soon as they got enough money so he didn't have to work, he was out of there to train on his own. Goku confirmed for deadbeat dad status again.</br></br></br>   Mr Satan says Ora multiple times <br> Does a practicing flurry <br> Dat Billis blowing up a planet when they served him shitty food <br> Dat Stan/Buu arguing like an old Married Couple <br> Videl's cuteness over 9000 <br> Goten Yells "Atttatatatata" When fighting a giant snake <br><br>DICK<br>I<br>A<br>M<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they're gonna skip it.<br>I think it was anounced via their twitter, firsts episodes are after buu, then a few in between th movies and then the whole saga is after</br></br>  <br>Vegeta and Trunks can fly at the speed of sound. Bulma owns a company that makes portable jets. <br><br>Why are they riding a kiddie train?</br></br></br>  That was fun, I guess. I want it to be about Gohan, though. I'm also sort of disappointed that it looks like it's just going to re-tread the movies.<br><br><br>No. He let his son drive a tractor off a cliff and left as soon as he had money.</br></br></br>  <br>I think that Raditz started to fuck things up from the first episode of dbz<br>not that I am coplaining, it still have bunch of time to start something serious</br></br>  <br> Calm your tits. It's the first episode. <br>The first episode of GT was better, stuff actually happend. This was literally a side story about something that doesn't matter.</br></br>  <br>Because Trunks is a kid.</br>  <br> (perfect I'd say) <br><br>Get your eyes fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is Vegeta gonna get out of that cart?</br>  <br>He's a manlet, he fits in there perfectly.</br>   Tentacle prince   <br>That isn't a bad sign. DB is at its best when it's about wacky adventures. The series started going downhill when Piccolo showed up.</br>  <br><br>Gohan went Mystic and pretty much we know he is capped out. He might be out of the picture for awhile unless the Earth is in danger. <br><br>We have a good idea that this series will more likely take place away from Earth, so there is no reason for Gohan to get a prominent role anymore. <br><br>Maybe if the series fast forwards a bit we will get 4 year old Pan again and her going Super Saiyan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Welp the animation is great (perfect I'd say <br>DBZfags are sill fucking idiots I see</br></br>  <br> implying power levels matter <br>Toriyama obviously doesn't care at this point.</br></br>  <br><br>He never cared.</br></br>  <br><br>Gohan did bring about the peak of DBZ its just that the fans had trouble letting go of Goku. I know id also like to see Gohan do more abd im actually glad the way the series has handle things with the movies.Gohan would still be the strongest character if not for Goku getting God Ki so he never actually just passed up Gohan in strength</br></br>  <br>So then explain how Vegeta got stronger with out God ki? Gohan let himself go after Buu died just like he did after Cell. He's weaker then he was has Ultimate Gohan.</br>  how is roshi still alive  <br><br>Vegeta goes God in the second movie meaning he got God ki as well and has also passed up a non-God Gohan. Gohans great general powr may be meaningless even if he gets God Ki and even as a Gohan fan I might be able to live with that</br></br>  <br>waterfall of youth or some shit apparently</br>  <br>But even in Battle of Gods Gohan let himself go. So it stands to reason Vegeta was stronger than him then even then.</br>  <br>so.. you never watched dragon ball?<br><br>basically he drank the water of eternal life when he was already old</br></br></br>  <br>He's speaking english of course he didn't watch Dragonball.</br>  Is there a rip up yet? Didn't realize this premiered today.  <br><br>Vegeta surpassed everyone in BoG when he got his rage boost.</br></br>  <br><br>Vegetas limits were established as being a SSJ2. Babidi even says he made him stronger than he could possibly get and that just let him match SSJ2 Goku<br><br>In fact no Saiyan showed being able to go much past SSJ2 with SSJ3 being a freak form that burned up power so fast its almost unusable<br><br>Seriously its 2015 I shouldnt have to be explaining DB continuity like its dub is fouling shit up on TV again</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched it, I just didn't remember some minor plot point from at least 8 years ago.</br>  <br> power levels <br>Doesn't fucking matter.</br></br>  <br>But the point I'm trying to make is that right now in Ep 1 of Super Gohan is weaker than Vegeta because he stopped training. You said Gohan would be the strongest character if it wasn't for Goku getting God Ki but that's not true.</br>   No Yajirobe, not even in the OP or ED <br><br>He helped save the world more than Yamcha did...</br></br>  <br><br>as of the first movie and the end of DBZ yeah Gohans the strongest.After that no hes surpassed by Goku and later Vegeta</br></br>  <br>Is there Launch in OP or ED?</br>  <br>Literally nobody in Japan cares about Yajirobe</br>  <br>Dont insult my husbando.</br>  DYNAMIC!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OMS<wbr>hwUJKvB4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>See I think Vegeta surpassed him right after DBZ but I guess we can just disagree.</br>  so is there a torrent or something?  subs fucking when?   Dragon Ball Super <br> mfw the designs <br>This is going to be worse than Nagato Yuki-Chan.</br></br>  <br>Cause trains are cool.</br>  <br>What is he looking at, guys?</br>  <br>God</br>  So Super sucks because it still doesn't have the best Dragon Ball character.  <br>At the distance, thinkin bout Kakarott</br>  download Link?  <br> I wish I was back in my training capsule taking a fat Saiyan shit. </br>  <br>he ran away at the end because he wanted to train<br>so no</br></br>  <br>Launch is the best DB waifu.</br>  <br> DB was 8 years ago <br>anon...</br></br>  Why are people hyped for this? From the opening alone it looked like horse shit, more power-up shit with 'oh no an EVEN STRONGER opponent!' plot and the music was awful<br><br>There is no way it'll be namek-saga tier so being more like DBZ instead of DB is just disappointing</br></br>  <br>Goku was always a good dad whenever he wasn't dead. When they had 10 days left before the Cell Games Goku took Gohan fishing.</br>  <br>Hell no. Goku is the worst dad ever. That's why everyone loves him.<br><br> "Please notice me, daddy." -- Gohan. </br></br></br>  <br>That was like the ONE time he actually spent quality time with Gohan. And it was more just an excuse to see how long they could hold SSJ form to make it more energy efficient.</br>  It was great.  <br> Why are people hyped for this? <br><br>nostalgia. the 40 year old permavirgins cant wait to relive their childhood</br></br></br>  <br> When they had 10 days left before the Cell Games Goku took Gohan fishing. <br>That was filler, though.</br></br>  <br>but there's already Kai for that and it's actually really good</br>  <br>That's when I watched it JESUS CHRIST you know exactly what was meant</br>  <br> more power-up shit <br> oh no an EVEN STRONGER opponent!' <br><br>anon what are you watching?<br><br>from the opening you can tell this is going to be dragon ball slice of life<br><br>it's going to be great</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inviting ancient Egyptian gods over for BBQ <br> Trunks going SSJ to cheat on his tests and getting caught </br></br>  <br>what am I watching?<br><br> faulconer tier music <br> over half of it power-ups and fighting <br> cunning bad guys <br> goku getting all cereal to hype the audience up for *THAT* moment <br><br>compare it to this<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=X7k<wbr>ZVH849Eo</wbr>  [ ]<br>and tell me it reminded you of this more than DBZ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   [SOFCJ-Raws] Dragon Ball Super - 001 (CX 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4   wait, neither Kageyama nor Tanimoto sing the OP?<br>The fuck</br>  <br> more power-up shit with 'oh no an EVEN STRONGER opponent!' plot <br>so more Dragon Ball Z?</br></br>  Funimation doesnt licensed it yet. why?  <br>I could see Trunks sitting in class with an earpiece reading the questions to Gohan at home and Gohan answering Goten who then transmits the answers back to Trunks. Gohan would be all like "you sure are inquizitive today, little brother; wanna go to the museum later?!" and Goten would be all "y-y-yeah, s-sure."<br><br>Oh, and Goten would mishear the questions as Trunks reads them and end up getting a bunch of wrong, seemingly incoherent answers from Gohan that Trunks would write down. Then when Trunks gets the test back, it'd be an F and Trunks would be all "wow, I thought Gohan was supposed to be some super genius. What a dumbass!"</br></br></br>  <br>iirc Sabat said they can't yet Super's license is on hold</br>  <br>ok i think i get you now<br><br><br>Don't worry i don't think there will be a lot of fighting in this anime<br><br>And if you want that feeling of adventure the original dragobn ball had, don't worry i think we are going to get plenty of that with Goten and Trunks</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>O boi</br>  <br><br> no Mai <br>What's the point</br></br></br>  <br>Autism</br>  <br>SOON</br>  <br>Pilaf's gang was already confirmed as going to show up.</br>    <br>Lazy filler Piccolo</br>  <br>I want to see more loli Mai.</br>  <br>Dude had the best theme though</br>  <br>They said once that all Dragon Ball IP have to be offered to Fox before them or something like that. It's why it took 2 years to get Battle of the Gods.</br>  <br>We all want more Mai, son.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm a noob, so, after finding this, where should I look for the subs? <br>Only time I'm gonna bother you with the question.</br></br></br></br></br>  So was it good?  <br> opens fire on the Saiyan <br> not placed under custody <br><br>Bitch should be rotting in jail.......</br></br></br></br>  <br>he was cool af tho</br>  <br>It was filler good, which for Dragon ball is pretty decent. I always go by the rule of 3 for anime, so by the 3rd episode we should know if it's worth watching or dropping, but who the fuck are we kidding? We'll keep watching it anyway because it's FUCKING DRAGON BALL.</br>   tfw you'll never suck on Trunks boy penis <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>It was as comfy as watching Mr. Rogers.<br><br> Fuck yes, it was good. </br></br></br>  <br>I dont.

I need my revival of f  Did the new episode come out?   Horriblesubs don't care about DB <br>dragon ball super is FINISHED</br>  <br>It aired on tv</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Goku was always a good dad though</br>   Satan isn't muscular or tall as fuck <br>he still looks taller than the rest of the cast excluding Piccolo but he' really shrunk over the years.</br>  Since the manga comes out once a month, is every month going to be 1 important episode and then 3 weeks of filler?  <br>Lol no. <br><br>Piccolo was a better dad to Gowan than goku</br></br></br>  <br> Crunchyroll and Funimation don't care about DB <br>Fixed that for you</br></br>  <br>The opening reminded me of FLCL for some reason.</br>  <br><br>FUCKKKKKK when are we getting that shit subbed? Is there any groups working on it?</br></br>  <br>that'd suck. plus i doubt it. I'd say 5 episodes tops with this silly SOL stuff at the beginning then its straight to BOG arc then ROF arc.</br>  <br> pop music has seeped into Dragon Ball <br><br>Why must life be so painful?</br></br></br>  I wonder if they are travelling to Universe 6 here.  <br> implying <br><br>the very first thing Piccolo did to Gohan was throw him at a mountain</br></br></br>  <br>Around 4 hours after the streaming</br>  This series really shows how bad animation has gotten since Flash came along.<br><br>DBZ wasn't perfect, but it looked much better than this.</br></br>   Super's first episode just finished not even an hour ago <br> people bitching about no subs and there will never be any subs ever </br>  <br>That's probably a reference to Super Cyan.</br>  Any updates on the RoF sub yet? Kind of do not want to watch Super until I watch that.  <br>It was super good</br>  <br>You're wrong,though.</br>  <br>Man, I hope Piccolo is able to be relevant in Super. If just for the sake of having a non-saiyan in the main fights.</br>  Are Gohan and Videl already married? I want to see their wedding  <br> comparing promo art to episode animation <br><br>U wot m8?</br></br></br>  Are my eyes deceiving me or is that Mystic Gohan in the opening?  <br>What do you think? DB brings the worst kind of crossboarders. They don't even know that HS don't actually sub things like </br>  <br>Funimation has exclusive rights to DBZ. But I have no idea why they're simulcasting every show this season except Super.</br>  <br>When's the streaming?</br>  OL' SON GOKU HAD A FARM E I E I O  It's been a while since I've seen DBZ, but Goten wasn't that much shorter than Trunks, was he?<br><br>I know he's a year younger than Trunks, but I didn't think the height difference would be that different.<br><br>I guess Trunks is going through a growth spurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Mystic Gohan.</br>  http://watchdbzsuper.com/dragon-bal<wbr>l-super-episode-01-subbed/<br><br>enjoy faggits</br></br></wbr>  GT was good  <br>Crude art has its own charm.</br>  <br><br>I wasn't comparing the promo art to the animation...</br></br>  <br> Child Mai somehow meets Future Trunks </br>  <br>inb4 locked content</br>  <br>how the shit does he lose his mystic between BOG and ROF</br>  <br>An hero.</br>  <br>he better not forget it</br>  <br><br>Everything looks better than GT.<br><br>I don't know why, but GT looked like complete shit. Not being based off a manga isn't an excuse for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama forgot it.</br>  Those two movies are no longer canon.  It's been a few hours since it aired, and still no subs. Please tell me some kind anon is working on this.  <br>Thank God. Now they can put back Mystic Gohan and get rid of pedobait Mai.</br>  <br><br>I don't think he lost his Mystic powers...I think he just figured out how to go SSJ Mystic...but Revival of F was stupid and is non-canon so who cares.</br></br>  <br>Yes, a Mexican fansub is working on it.</br>  <br>You know the answer to that question anon</br>  <br>Are you stupid or something?</br>  <br>Hes right though.</br>  <br>What was the point of making the movies if they were just going to overwrite them with a new series? It can't be 'to gauge interest' because it's fucking Dragonball. They could have just gotten started on a new series in the first place and people would have been all over it, movies or not.</br>  <br>bait harder</br>  <br>Sure aren't. Beerus was awake but this episode was supposedly to be shortly after Kid Buu's defeat.<br><br><br>Stop whining. It's literally been two hours. Go the fuck to sleep, you impatient hillbilly.<br><br>Also, watch anime raw you sub pleb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was actually good<br><br>This, and certain 90s anime</br></br></br>  <br>didnt toriyama outright state the movies are canon as well</br>  <br>I want pedobait Mai to stay though.</br>  <br>FUCKING THIS<br><br>Adult Gohan is useless</br></br></br>  <br>They were probably trying to raise money for super is my guess.</br>  <br>I think it's the colouring and shading which really throw it off</br>  <br> literally been confirmed that BoG and RoF will be arcs in super <br> Beerus physically appears in the manga in chapter 1 <br>yeah okay then</br></br></br>  <br>probably because of toriyama, he might not have wanted another series but after 2 movies he was like "ayy fuck it, free money"</br>  <br><br>yeah, I guess that's why we see Frieza henchmen in the opening too</br></br>  <br><br><br>you're all fucking idiots</br></br></br>  <br>None of the movies are canon. Don't believe the casuals.</br>  <br>But it happened differently, Beerus should be asleep now.</br>  Guys, while the series is having a strong start, we must remain wary. It could start good but fall<br> into the same rut GT did</br>  <br><br>I think they just wanted to do a couple movies for fun, and they saw that people still really love Dragonball, so they figured screw it lets make a new series.</br></br>  <br>In Battle of Gods, it was stated Beerus had been asleep for the past 38 years. That was 5 years after the fight with Kid Buu. Here we see Beerus awake and destroying planets despite this episode being just months after the fight with Kid Buu.<br><br> So yeah, the movies are non-canon, just like the other 13. </br></br></br>  <br>Bojack is canon</br>  <br>But both this and GT didn't have a good start.</br>  <br>for you</br>  <br><br>Battle of Gods &amp; Revival of F are going to be arcs in DB Super, but that doesn't mean they will be exactly the same.</br></br>   people seriously arguing about whether dbz movies are canon or not <br><br>WOW IT'S LIKE I'M REALLY BACK IN THE YEAR 2000</br></br>  <br>Isn't that the one where Goten and Trunks beat up Hitler?</br>   first episode <br> already MUH GT MUH GT <br><br>you guys just want this to be bad but it won't be</br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't Dead Zone canon?</br></br>  <br>There's no argument. They are obviously non-canon.</br>  Little Witch Academia 2 gets a sticky, and fucking DRAGON BALL doesn't? What's up with that?  <br>/a/ hates anime.<br><br>Welcome to 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br>no you're thinking of Fusion Reborn<br><br>Bojack Unbound is after the Cell games when Goku is dead, and everyone but Vegeta goes to have fun in a tournament, Future Trunks is there too<br><br>Bojack and his minions also had their own "Super Saiyan" equivalent form</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize it was confirmed that Super will be covering the periods of those movies, but altering aspects of them, yes? Which means the movies are being retconned and the series will be the canon version.</br>  <br><br>If it's not a manga by Toriyama it's not canon. Plus the Deadzone movie has a huge continuity problem in that Krillin meets Gohan for the first time at the start of Z so he couldn't have met him during Dead Zone.<br><br>The Bojack movie has Goku break the rules on dead people returning to Earth (which isn't possible in the manga, that's why Elder Kaioshin had to give up his life in the Buu Saga). Also Trunks' hair is the wrong length, but that's just being pedantic.</br></br></br></br>   Toei puts more money into today's Precure episode than the premiere of Super <br><br>It's Sailor Moon Crystal all over again.<br>Bravo Toei.</br></br></br>  <br> Bojack and his minions also had their own "Super Saiyan" equivalent form <br>I liked this part.</br></br>  <br>Bojack can't be canon because the Future Trunks in that movie has come back from the future to tell everyone that he successfully destroyed the Androids and Cell. Prior to him doing so however, Future Bulma gave him a haircut and he sports his original short-haired look again.<br><br>In Bojack Unbound, his hair is long.<br><br>That obvious plothole prevents this movie from fitting into the canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ITS IN MY OTHER PANTS POCKET</br>  <br>NOTHING WILL EVER BE WORSE THAN SMC.</br>  <br>Piccolo and Worst Dad still don't have their drivers license.<br><br>Although Piccolo is a natural talent.</br></br></br>  <br>Also Bojack Unbound had animal people and everyone knows they all went extinct after the Saiyan Saga.</br>  <br>It's more likely to be bad then good though. Toriyama was already losing his touch in DBZ, and I doubt he's as involved as people think he is in Super.</br>  <br>Thank god.<br><br>They were terrible</br></br></br>  This is going to be great.  <br> Deadzone movie has a huge continuity problem in that Krillin meets Gohan for the first time at the start of Z so he couldn't have met him during Dead Zone. <br>To be fair, Krillin could've blocked out the entire day from his memory. After all, facing an immortal after getting pissed on by a drunk 3-year-old certainly would be a traumatic experience worth remembering. And neither Goku nor Piccolo seemed too impressed by Gohan's headbutt during the Raditz fight, which would mean they're both aware that Gohan was capable of being a little badass prior.</br></br>  <br> First couple arcs in Super are literally BOG/ROF </br>  <br> implying toei cares about series not created by them <br>Toei has been terrible since forever, why are you surprised</br></br>  <br> implying Pan alone didn't make GT better than Super </br>  <br>Holy shit, I need to watch Precure.</br>  <br> a traumatic experience worth remembering <br>I meant "worth not remembering."</br></br>  <br>Also, Goku and King Kai are hanging out in a cabin on a tree next to Snake Road throughout the movie. But that can't be, because in the series, the cabin fell apart immediately after King Kai built it, and then they left the tree to travel to Grand Kai's planet. There was no time for the movie to take place. This is a serious plot hole.</br>  <br>all aboard the hype train</br>  <br>So, because they changed a little detail no one even gave a shit about, you think the entire movie is not canon?<br>They'll just chop the new movies in 20 min bits and make a dozen episodes, with a little bit of added stuff.</br></br>  <br>I want to lick Pan all over.</br>  <br><br>im too late, i was fucking a whore, where i can watch it?</br></br>  <br> Kid Goku&gt;&gt;Adult Goku <br>GT Goku was the reason. GT&gt;Super</br></br>  <br>It was a major point.

I'm sure they were posted in other threads too, guess I just managed to avoid them somehow.</br>  Does Videl count as a sexy MILF now?  <br>What do you think they got a budget for? I'm willing to bet on original animation for BoG/RoF, if they even do them at all.</br>  <br>Bra was better</br>  <br>She has the worst fucking hair so no</br>  <br><br>Maybe not, if Super is redoing the movies she might not be pregnant yet</br></br>  <br>She always did. GT Videl's braided ponytail was pure sex.</br>  If Jaco made it in is there a chance we'll get cameos from best character?  <br> "Who is that? Android 18?" <br> -- Akira Toriyama. </br></br>  <br>If they're not even bothering with DB characters (like Launch) there's no way in hell Arale is getting in.

No way Toriyama would forget him. also iirc Tori likes to draw Jaco.<br><br> Jaco and Saiyaman episode? <br>I've been wanting this since Jaco was made.</br></br></br></br>  The hole JoJo left in my heart has been filled back in  <br>Read the fucking manga.</br>    <br>Where do you think that pic is from faggot?</br>  <br>I read it two years ago fucking chill. <br><br>What, I can't miss the anime?</br></br></br>   subs <br>Que fansub esta acargo de esto mi raza? :^)</br>  <br> We will never get cel animation again <br>I'm killing myself</br></br>  The wait for Baaro has begun.   It's time.   So what homo shows have we got this season?  To watch or not to watch?  I'm kind of sad the entire manga isn't about them as children. Here comes the inevitable love triangle shit.  <br>Just finished the episode. It was shit.</br>  <br>It's shit, Aldnoah 2.0 in terms of trainwreck</br>  This has potential  <br> That's a girl <br><br>Why.</br></br></br>  Why is he so damn adorable? I can't really place it.  <br>As far homo is concerned, Ranpo seems much better.</br>  I hope there will be some shota homo of them.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127582773 <br>Google the fucking name of the character.</br>  <br><br><br>Movie is out looks like.</br></br></br>    <br>Turns out there are a bunch of Itami a cute out there.</br>  <br>I am watching for the boys  and Morikubo having a lead role for once </br>  <br>And 90% of it is shoujo or supergay</br>  <br>It's called Nippon Stronk</br>  <br>Not spoonfeeding you, try again.</br>  <br>It's because he looks like a retard.</br>  <br>It's a shame the MC's not a guy, but I'm looking forward to more of this qt.</br>  <br>Feels like Captain Earth all over again. It's shit.</br>  <br>The animation is not all that great, but I'll probably keep watching for him.</br>  Did anyone manage to get the drama CD of this?<br>I was hoping to hear more about it.</br>  <br>That first episode was painful to watch.</br>  <br>Is this from the ED? Also what is he saying?</br>  <br>Maybe this? I don't know shit about sign language.</br>  <br>He looks autistic.</br>  <br>I hope he is. I love autists.</br>  <br>Yeah, it came out Friday. Spoke to someone who saw it, they said no new footage, just edited anime eps. Didn't sound very impressed.</br>  <br>Looks like it</br>  <br><br>Even if you did speak American sign language, the Japanese one is entirely different.</br></br>  <br>But isn't the setting america? Though I guess they wouldn't do this much research.</br>  <br>No, it's a fictional city in a fictional country</br>  So, how do you like this season so far?  <br>I am just gonna pretend she's a boy just like some people pretend some traps are girls.</br>  Any of you homos got this shit yet?  <br>I hope this doujin has a lot of<br> As expected of country grown vegetables! </br></br>  <br>Pretty shitty so far</br>  <br>I hope it has its own meme.</br>  <br>I want Ishiki to be the fucked one.</br>  <br>Reverse traps aren't supposed to be blonde. They fucked up.</br>  <br>Fuck yes! I asked for this webm in the thread.<br>Thanks anon.<br><br>It was subtitled anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a below average season, only Working!!! and Durarara x2 ten are good.<br>Looks like the originals and new adaptations are almost all shit, only sequels to look forward too</br></br>  <br> Durarara <br> good </br></br>  <br>I'm feeling very positive. Both Laplace and Aoharu x Kikanjuu seem to rather homo. Also there are some great boys in Charlotte, Gangsta and Classroom Crisis. Also, there's always Gintama.</br>  <br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br> homo <br>It's literally a reverse haremshit/love triangle with two boys one girl.<br><br> classroom crisis <br>It's shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ushio to Tora and Rokka no Yuusha had a good first episodes, the latter might be from a LN but at least it's not harem, the setting is interesting and MC looks good. Working wasn't as funny as I remembered.</br>   YOU WANT AMON?! TOO BAD! HERE FAGYAMA! FUCK U! <br>Fuck you too Ishida.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127591441 <br> fanfics <br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127591441 <br>God's work. Nice to see nips putting together an anthology too, love is alive if cultish.</br>  <br>None of those have any good boys.</br>  <br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Literally Ouran Highschool Host Club.</br></br>  <br>Aoharu was okay, Rokka was great and I still have Akagami to look forward to. That's already better than previous season.<br><br>Still need to catch up on Gatchaman before I can watch season 2.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't like deaf moe </br>  <br> It's literally a reverse haremshit/love triangle with two boys one girl. <br>Except it's not. We're 29 chapters in and they still don't know that she's a fucking girl. There's more fujo pandering in the manga than het pandering.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127591441 <br> fanfics <br>please leave.<br>There are other sites that specialize with that.</br></br></br>  <br>This is probably going to be my manga backlog season, I'm not really interested in any shows airing besides Rampo and Ushio to Tora.<br><br>Would anyone happen to know if any chapters were ripped from the Asumiko Nakamura anthology DMG published digitally? There's a chapter with Leo from Coponius no Kokyuu in it.</br></br></br>  <br>But Ouran was good with humor, boys were nice and pander to fujos there and here.</br>  <br> Gintama <br>I'll fight ya</br></br>  <br>Sure. All boys are shit.</br>    <br>Confirmed for not even watching, therefore opinion discarded.<br>Just wondering, but what boys do you consider good?</br></br>  <br> liking gintama boys <br>You can't have shittier tastes, fujoshit.</br></br>  Personally I thought the highlight of Aoharu x Kikanjuu was not the cute boy vibes (which were nice enough) but the over the top gun battle. I lost my shit when he was walking towards her dodging the bullets.  <br>The one-shot was better.</br>  <br>Not a great season for homo, I'll probably only watch the 8 minutes shorts, Monster Girls and Charlotte.<br><br>I want to like Gangsta, but I really don't trust Manglobe all that much.</br></br></br>  I want to abuse Green.  <br>Why don't? <br>They delivered with SamFlam.<br> Fuck Kurata. </br></br></br>  <br>Never watched SamFlam. <br><br> Probably a good thing, I guess.  </br></br></br>  <br>I want to  hold his hand. </br>  <br>Nope. You missed out on all the fun.</br>  <br>  the fun <br><br>SamFlam was ony good for the homo, it was all over the place in quality for everything else.</br></br></br>    <br>Not really the sale when they're doing an adaptation than when they're doing an original show though</br>  <br>*the same I meant<br>Also, while I loved SamFlam to bits it did have troubles un the visual department</br></br>  <br>Quality was the only issue with SamFlam and they fixed it in BDs. The characters were likable, the ride was crazy and the toku references were good. It was a good watch with /a/ since it was original and no one could  predict and  spoil the plot.</br>  <br>Watching it week by week was so fun.<br>That said, I dropped it when it went full power rangers for the couple of episodes it lasted.</br></br>  <br> The characters were likable, <br><br>I, for one, couldn't stand the idols girls, they were insufferable everytime they appeared on screen.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that arc was the weakest but Goto's arc afterwards and then yandere shota arc was worth it.</br>  <br>Mari a shit, but the other two were alright.</br>  <br>I can understand Mari, but Moe was an angel and Mizuki was pretty cool but<br> discussing girls in a homo thread </br></br>  <br>At least it's not fags getting mad at otome games again.</br>  <br>Watched only Charlotte so far and I kind of liked it, will watch Kikanjuu now. <br><br>Working is the same as ever, funny and a nice way to spend 20 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>I missed those too. <br>Too bad they are paired.</br></br>  <br>Soma is top you can't tell me otherwise. (still need this though)</br>  Not a huge fan of gradient hair, but he is pretty cute.  <br>Working is the best thing I've watched this season.<br>Still great, but damn the season is awful.</br></br>  <br>Gradient hair is ok in general, what's shit is long hair.</br>  <br>Yeh. I rarely mind a redhead MC.</br>  <br>But the only homo was a slutty straight girl kissing her lesbian friend.</br>  Why can't I ever find any translations anymore besides Free! shit where the guys have spider legs and long fingers? Did the hentai world move to a new site?  <br>Learn japanese, doujins are so basic to read too.</br>  <br> Needing translations for porn </br>  <br>Best captain soon.<br> so good he pops up in flashbacks in a critical game to inspire a different team to get past their fucking boring opponents </br></br>  <br>I want to pet him.</br>  <br>I usually think that long hair is shit, but I think it actually looks sort of good on the Rokka mc.</br>  <br>How is it plot wise?</br>  <br>It's generic, but the good kind of generic so far. There's no annoying LN archetype yet and the characters are likeable enough.</br>    <br> brown Akaashi </br>  <br> love is alive if cultish. <br>I'll take what I can get</br></br>  <br>Charlotte MC is kind of an endearing prick. and the rest of the show seems interesting enough. If only his little sister wasn't so damned annoying. It was like she sucked the fun out of the entire second half of the episode.</br>  New Tomcat doujin out. http://exhentai.org/g/829655/3e0e4b<wbr>b8f8/ <br> that cliffhanger ending </br></wbr>  <br>Hope the guy at the end gets fucked.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127599861 <br> balls touching <br> not gay <br>newfag pls</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127599861 <br>What's the source of that, anyway?

If it is actually a good as Ouran I would pick it the fuck up.</br>  <br>This is the gayest blush we'll see all season.</br>  Soon  <br>I wonder Uta will say to Haise</br>  <br>Why is there no dialogue?</br>  Why does Ishida tease us with cliffhangers  <br> being this retard. </br>  It seems Ishida is going to make a daily calendar for 2016.  <br>Do you guys think will get an awesome fight scene with Haise vs Uta or will it simply skip to three weeks from now and Haise will just make some comment of "So it turns out the mask was made for Kaneki" and just let us all down?</br>  <br>I doubt he will fight clowns yet</br>  <br> Do you guys think will get an awesome fight scene with Haise vs Uta <br>never, but it's really odd that Uta shows him his ghoul eye right away. He probably bets on Haise knowing about kaneki having ghouls friends and hopes that Haise thinks that Uta is an old friend of his.</br></br>  <br>So the art in :re is going to get worse?</br>  <br> Do you guys think will get an awesome fight scene with Haise vs Uta <br>No, the chances that Haise and Uta are going to fight are nil, but they're going to have an intriguing conversation.<br> Also, get out shounen fag. </br></br></br>  <br>Not much of that white hair left.</br>  <br>Something something tragedy something unpopular</br>  <br>Not necessarily. I think Ishida is quite capable of handling simultaneous tasks while keeping up the quality.</br>   Faggyama arc is progressing at a rabbit pace <br>Based Ishida, he knows that I want this arc to be over with. <br>So is Kanae get rekt by CCG or not? <br><br><br>I'm excited to see next chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never, Uta doesn't like to fight.</br>  <br>Really? To me it seems that he's enjoying fights. It's just that he doesn't really care about winning a fight, it's rather playing around for him.</br>  <br>He doesn't always start a fight. He used to yeah but not now. Next chapter will be talking.</br>  <br><br>Torture scene for Haise when?<br><br>It's coming right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Haise is going to immediately identify Uta as a ghoul, or if Haise is going to think Uta is wearing contact lenses or is one of those people that inject ink into their corneas to make their sclera look black.</br>  <br><br>Uta is probably an extremely powerful kakuja, fights for him are a nuisance, unless it's with someone he like to play with like Yomo or Hirako.</br></br>  <br>nothing will happen</br>  <br>Haise comes to the shop with the knowledge of the owner is making masks for ghouls. He is also aware of friendly ghouls like Hinami or Donato, I don't see why he should consider Uta as not being a ghoul. <br>He is a freaking ghoul investigator.</br></br>  <br>If anyone's getting a torture scene, I'd bet you it's one of the Qs other than Haise.</br>  <br>Which one of the Qs would it be though?</br>  <br> Next chapter will be talking. <br>Yeah, I know. It's obvious that Uta and Haise aren't going to fight, I was just talking about his attitude regarding fights in general.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>Ishida probably skip everything again and in chapter 36 we'll see Haise doing boring CCG stuff.</br></br>  <br>it will be same as it was with touka</br>  <br><br>That's bullshit I can believe in.</br></br>  <br> I think Ishida is quite capable of handling simultaneous tasks while keeping up the quality. <br>Friendly remainder that chapter 16's art sucked so much because Ishida was making the anime ED cards.</br></br>  <br> Based Ishida, he knows that I want this arc to be over with.  <br> So is Kanae get rekt by CCG or not? <br>I'm surprised as well, if homo prince and his fanboy got BTFO by CCG, then this arc's purpose was just to get rip off of them?<br>Based Ishida.</br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing will happen <br>SoL talk and then Uta saying: yeah he is the same. Now to work.</br></br>  <br>So what? He's always improving the art for the volumes and that's what actually counts.</br>  <br> Which one of the Qs would it be though? <br>Just one?</br></br>  <br>I'd say Saiko or Urie, but I actually doubt that there's going to be a torture scene with one of the Q's.</br>  <br> He's always improving the art for the volumes and that's what actually counts. <br>The errors are still there, and by errors I mean the weird hands, the photos backgrounds, the weird faces.<br>Chapter 31 was full of weird tiny faces. <br>I want Ishida to take things slowly, he said in his tumblr that he cried out of stress while he was doing the anime ED.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trap is a good candidate, as her meet with Torso is inevitable. I don't think the violence will be very brutal, more like a little sexual violence.</br>  <br> Mutsuki gets tortured <br> he gets a new personality <br> he becomes almost as strong as Shironeki <br> Mutsuki and Urie become the strongest investigator couple <br><br><br>Yeah, Ishida is loaded with work, he needs a little break.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he <br>kek</br></br>  <br>I feel bullied, anon-kun is trying to bait me. Now who can save me?<br> Well, it seems it¬¥s time to leave this threads and return tomorrow </br></br>  <br>*she</br>  <br>I agree he shouldn't rush things and take his time. I don't want him to get a stress induced sickness.</br>  <br><br><br>I forgot, sorry. I usually use "she" because I know using the masculine pronoun would trigger other anons.</br></br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3871711701<wbr>?fr=frs</wbr>  <br>he will do the hxh</br>  <br>No, please.</br>  <br> hxh <br>Ishida admires HxH's author, don't call the devil.</br></br>  so what does he say?  <br>He worked for Togashi as assistant.</br>  <br>Let me eat your dick</br>  <br>Chink anon where?</br>  <br>can I suck your Eyeballs</br>   banging his head in the tree <br>What a fucking dramatic faggot.</br>  <br>I don't understand japanese but I bet they're saying something like<br> Is this the HySy Art Studio? <br> Oh, a new customer... </br></br></br>  Does a ghouls dick grow back when its cut?  <br>If the ghoul isn't a jobber, then yes.</br>  <br>Yes, that's also why Big Madam could never be a true madam and forced her ideal vision of herself onto Suzuya.</br>  <br><br>He just says good evening and ask if the shop is still open. <br>Uta: "... yeah it's still open"</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hyped for chapter 36.</br>  <br> I'm hyped for chapter 36 <br>It is going to be like chapter 31, nothing happens in the end.</br></br>  I think the best explanation for Uta's constant kakugan is that it's supposed to be an eye tattoo, which isn't very exciting, honestly<br><br>I hope Haise still confronts him about it, I just want something interesting to happen...</br></br>  <br>An interesting thing about Uta's Kakugan is that he doesn't have the veins arround his eyes that other ghouls have.</br>  <br>Oh he has too high RC that he can't shut it off. Ishida will explain it later. <br><br><br>He does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it doesn't bother me too much<br>I just meant that saying "oh this? just an eye tattoo" is the perfect cover-up and that sucks</br></br>  I guess I can call Faggyama Torsoyama now.  <br>Nah, he doesn't tattoo it. I'm sure. Way before he had tattoo, his eyes were always on constant kakugan state.</br>  <br>Okay so I think that Haise is going to talk to Uta and to other ghoul about the person he used to be aka Kaneki Ken.<br><br>And, I think the time for Haise is up now.<br><br> Kaneki and the caterpillar fungus comparaison. <br> Arima becoming suspiscious of Haise after the Auction raid and sending Ihei to watch him over  <br> Since Haise is going to try to learn more about his past, he will probably interact more with Ghoul. <br> The CCG won't allow this. <br> Hinami in prison and Akira is losing patience. <br><br>With this much going on, I don't think he can keep up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit dude, really?<br><br>I meant that he could easily fucking lie about his kakugan being an eye tattoo, given that he looks exactly like a bodymod freak</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck do you find so good about this manga?</br>  On the other hand...<br><br> Haise knows that Kaneki had many ghoul friends <br> Haise gets a mask from Kaneki's friends <br> Haise walks into the shop and instantly sees a guy with a kakugan <br><br>I don't think even Haise could be retarded enough to be fooled in a situation like this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Uta send him the mask right ?<br><br>And well, Haise is not stupid , he probably already figured out that this mask was the mask that Kaneki used to wear.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't lie. There are many occasions that he needs to shut it down but he never does so.<br> Going to human market with Tsumugi and Asa  <br> Stay in front of hospital gate <br> Walk to Anteiku <br> Meet Tsumugi <br> etc <br>When he was young and he fought Yomo in front of the public, he had to wear sunglasses and he had a whole collection of it. It was shown in the omake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He does. <br>I never saw an illustration of Uta that showed him having veins arround his eyes. Also your pic doesn't show him with them.</br></br>  <br>Lower panel, look into the eye retard.</br>  <br> Okay so I think that Haise is going to talk to Uta and to other ghoul about the person he used to be aka Kaneki Ken <br>To be honest I don't think Haise is going to ask explicitly about Kaneki, maybe Uta is going to toy with him, because it will be bloody stupid for Uta to literately say: oh, yeah, I knew that man and I made the mask for him, When it could arise suspicions about him. <br>Haise is a pussy, but still.<br> I don't think he can keep up <br>Haise becomes ash when Amon appears. As he is the final key to Kaneki's return.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When it could arise suspicions about him.  <br>What suspicions?<br><br> he is the final key to Kaneki's return. <br>Amon is ONE of the keys, not the FINAL key.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why isn't he going full CCG on Uta?</br>  <br>Haise is not the type that kill ghouls he sees on the spot unlike Arima.</br>  <br>I meant throwing him into Cocklea but okay</br>  <br>*like</br>  <br>Yeah Amon is one of the key to Kaneki's return but, I just think that the time for Kaneki to come back is very near.<br>Like, I think that it is at this volume that Kaneki will come back.<br><br><br>Because he want answer and, since Kaneki was not the type to be a monster, Haise probably believe that Uta is the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What suspicions? <br>That he is a ghoul, I mean if I were a criminal that is visited by a police to ask about another criminal, I would be very cautious about what I say.<br> Amon is ONE of the keys, not the FINAL key. <br>He is the final key. He was the first key to be mentioned, but he will be last and final one. Typical Ishida writing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Haise is not the type that kill ghouls he sees on the spot unlike Arima <br>He can take him to ghoul prison, like the taxi driver.</br></br>  Anime &gt;&gt;&gt; Manga  <br> since Kaneki was not the type to be a monster, Haise probably believe that Uta is the same. <br>How fucking naiv√©, given that even Kaneki knew fuck-all about the clowns<br><br>next chapter is gonna be delicious</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add...<br>I think that because , it seem that all the hints to come back are here.<br> Kaneki's caterpillar fungus comparaison. <br> CCG and Arima being suspicious of Kaneki <br> Hinami in prison. <br> Akira losing patience. <br><br>I think that it's all going to explose, Haise's life is going to be destroyed and THEN Amon will appear to help him.<br><br><br> How fucking naiv√© <br><br>Yeah, that's very naive of me to think that...<br>But Haise is also naive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaneki knew fuck-all about the clowns <br>Kaneki doesn't know that Uta/Itori/Roma nor Nico are clowns. He only knows about Souta.</br></br>  <br>yeah that's what I meant</br>  <br> I think that it's all going to explose, Haise's life is going to be destroyed and THEN Amon will appear to help him. <br>Fuck, anon, that's delicious. I wish you are fight.</br></br>  <br>If the conversation between Uta and RE was right he always was a friend despite being a clown.</br>    <br> yeah that's what I meant <br>Sorry, then.</br></br>  <br>He wins if you reply.</br>  <br> But Haise is also naive. <br>In one hand the correct way to act is to be cautious when a ghoul investigator is at your door, in the other if Uta talks about Kaneki, hinting that he is also a ghoul, but Haise doesn't notice anything, then he will be a bigger pussy and retarded.</br></br>  <br>Amon is the chosen one along with Kaneki their tragedy will wash all others away. <br><br>Of course he is the final key.</br></br></br>  Man, if Haise is here to stay, then Kaneki died the death of a true tragic hero<br><br> didn't get strong enough <br> couldn't save anybody <br> ate his best friend <br> died ignorant to the fact that Uta and the others were just fucking with him all along </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaneki's tragedy is to keep suffering like Roma and I want. Pic related, see the face of a happy man-child.</br>  <br>Thats my theory aswell. Kaneki Tulpa will use the fight between fagyama and himself to try and sieze control. He will activate his half kakuja eat fagyama for bonus points and then escape. Amon will then track down Beserk kaneki and they will have their final "talk" before Kaneki gets his full memory back wnd teams with Amon.</br>  <br> He is the final key. He was the first key to be mentioned, but he will be last and final one. Typical Ishida writing. <br><br>We're not getting Amon back till chapter 100, are we? Our suffering is worse than Hirako's.</br></br></br>  <br> We're not getting Amon back till chapter 100, are we? <br>No, chapter 60-70 to parallelism.</br></br>  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/17Zwq2_njezILPbhozSwR-Fq-c1iXeR<wbr>ckRj9H3MyBrVw/pubhtml<br>Wow, IS are fast this week.</br></wbr></wbr>  <br> criminal <br>He doesn't know No Face identity, he just knows the shop owner one.

FUCK U! </br>  <br>They are the same entity.<br><br><br>This is what Amonfag actually believes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do IS put fuck Touka on the chapters for?</br>  <br> He doesn't know No Face identity, he just knows the shop owner one. <br>Kaneki was a ghoul, ghouls use mask, Kaneki's friends were ghouls. Haise doesn't kill ghouls but he sends them to prison.<br>Anon, do you have autism?</br></br></br>  <br>To have fun.</br>  <br>Cause fat landwhales are into yaoi.</br>  <br> They are the same entity. <br>i'm aware that this is what Ishida is trying to push<br><br>but a person without memories just isn't the same person, I'm sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon I believe you are smarter than that.</br>  <br> They are the same entity <br>They are two personalities created by the trauma of getting skull raped. Science approves of this. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnes<wbr>ia<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deper<wbr>sonalization<br>I know the exact name for this, but I don't remember it in this moment.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Because they actually don't want Kaneki to fuck Touka because as the anon above stated they are fujos.</br>  <br>They are still the same person anon. Do you actually think Haise will remain amnesiac till the end of this manga?</br>  <br>Anon, I'm not going to discuss the obvious because I don't want to makes this a shitstorm.</br>  <br><br>so we let fujos translate Tokyo ghoul kek</br></br>  <br> They are still the same person anon. <br>No, two personalities that have the same core, but aren't the same entity. <br>Personality disorder.</br></br></br>  <br>Haise never meets No Face. Haise never investigate about it. Haise never hears about him.<br>Haise only knows Uta as show owner selling ghoul masks and also a ghoul. <br>Then how the fuck does he knows Uta is No Face?</br></br></br>  <br>Do you think he will remain amnesiac?!</br>  <br> Do you actually think Haise will remain amnesiac till the end of this manga? <br>Why not?<br><br>Ishida already put us in an almost CCG-exclusive perspective</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any other translator that is ready to start a drama war with them?</br>  <br>Will you eat your post if he remains like that after chapter 70? It is obvious Ishida is going with the parallel here.</br>  <br> Ishida is going with the parallel here. <br>You mean Amon and Kaneki being essentially inverted?<br><br>Like Amon will provide us with the ghoul perspective as soon as they meet?<br>I'd like that<br><br>but that's not gonna fucking happen, I have zero faith in Ishida</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then how the fuck does he knows Uta is No Face? <br>If someone is a ghoul+if someone is a ghoul investigator= the ghoul investigator is obligated to kill/arrest him.<br>I don't know where are you bring the whole No Face.<br>If Haise notice Uta is a ghoul, he will be obligated to arrest him. That's what is I was saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I heard there was some professional translators who translate Tokyo ghoul so far</br>  <br>Niggastream.</br>  <br><br> I don't think even Haise could be retarded enough <br> Haise is not stupid <br>When it's about Kaneki or his ghoul side/past, he is dumb as fuck. Haise is only good for searching info about your average ghoul. <br><br><br>Indeed. But I guess Ishida will immediately start Rosewald raid and we will see this conversation in flashbacks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> be obligated to arrest him <br> whoo hoo, I'm gonna find my identity by asking a shop owner and also a ghoul ans then arrest him right away even when he used to be my friend <br> all ghouls go to prison even when they are my friend <br>What a retarded logic for Haise. Did you see how he was hesitating in Hinami's case?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good lock convincing them to start a drama war with IS cause a drama is going to start and batotofags plus tubmletards are going to start shitting on niggastream.</br>  <br> What a retarded logic for Haise <br>Haise is learning well from Autisma's autism.</br></br>  When will we get a nigga ghoul  <br>He learned shit. All he did was to pose lile Arima but he couldn't strike the same. It is like China copying Japan model but the quality is shit tier.</br>  Her eyes are way too far apart. Fix it please, Ishida.  <br>That's a nice looking quinque.</br>  <br>No, I don't believe that.<br><br>You see, Haise is currently doing the exact same mistake that Kaneki was doing :<br><br>He's trying to save everyone, all the while trying to keep the family that he has in the CCG.<br><br>But, the readers (us) and Kaneki, know that it is simply not possible, you can't save everyone.<br><br>Like, when Yamori had gave him a choice between a child and a parent.<br>He didn't choose, so both died.<br><br>He then though that , if he get stronger, he could protect everyone without having to sacrifice someone else, but he sacrificed his sanity and, because of all that, he failed.<br><br>At the end of the manga, he understood the lesson.<br>You can't save everyone.<br><br>Now, Haise is doing the same thing and Kaneki know that it's just stupid and that, if he keep on going, Haise will make the same mistake that he made and he will end up not saving everyone.<br>He want to protect Hinami and, at the same time, he want to keep being with his family.<br>Akira think that Hinami is responsible for her dad's death and... well, she want to kill Hinami and she's not happy with Haise having ownership.<br><br>Now, Haise is currently with Uta, a ghoul. It's very probable that he know that Uta is a ghoul since he's the one who send him the mask and he send him to "Kaneki Ken".<br><br>Some people here think that Kaneki will have his memories back in a fight or some shit like that...<br><br>They are wrong, Kaneki is going to try to know more about his past...<br>And he's going to do it by interacting with Ghoul...<br>Arima is already suspicious of Haise by sending Ihei to keep an eye on him...<br><br>The more he's going to try to find information about himself, the more the CCG is going to be wary of him...<br>He's going to try to "save everyone", the ghouls he used to be friends all the while trying to keep the family that he made at the CCG...<br><br>And well, at one point , the CCG will found out and he won't be able to run away anymore, he'll have to make a choice.<br>A sacrifice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing he was not able to do in the original manga.<br><br>Either he sacrifice his "ghoul friend" and continue to pretend to "be happy"<br>Or he sacrifice the family that he made at the CCG to find the truth.<br><br>Since this is "Kaneki's second chance to make the right choices" It's very probable that Haise will choose the second choice.<br>And, when he'll be broken, when he will be in despair, it's only then that Amon will appear and he will help him and Kaneki will be hopeful once again.<br><br>It fit with the star as well.<br> Star Tarot Story <br>On the bleak landscape where the Tower stood, the Fool sits, empty, despairing. He hoped to find direction on this spiritual journey, a path to his spiritual self, but having just learned that most of his life was a lie, he now feels lost. Sitting on the cold stones, he gazes up at the night sky wishing for some kind of guide. And that is when he notices, nearby, a beautiful girl with two water urns. As he watches, she kneels by a pool of water illuminated with reflected starlight. She empties the urns, one into the pool, one onto the thirsty ground.<br> "Like possible futures," agrees the girl. "Cool and distant. Yet if you keep one in sight, it can guide you to your destination no matter how far away it is." Even as she says this, she began to fade away, like dew, vanishing. All that remains is a gleam that was at the center of her forehead. This rises up and up, until it settles in the night sky as a shining star. "Follow your star," the woman's voice seems to sing from that light, "and have hope." <br> The Fool takes in a breath and rises. It is a dark night, a desolate land. But for the first time, he has a guiding light to show him the way. Distant as it is, it restores his faith. <br><br>http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/lear<wbr>n/meanings/star.shtml<br><br>The auction was the beginning.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It almost looks like she has a kagune  <br>Star<br><br>[picture of Card 17] The Fool is suffused with a serene calm. The beautiful images on the Star (17) attest to this tranquility. The woman pictured on Card 17 is naked, her soul no longer hidden behind any disguise. Radiant stars shine in a cloudless sky serving as a beacon of hope and inspiration.<br>The Fool is blessed with a trust that completely replaces the negative energies of the Devil. His faith in himself and the future is restored. He is filled with joy and his one wish is to share it generously with the rest of the world. His heart is open, and his love pours out freely. This peace after the storm is a magical moment for the Fool.<br>If what you say it's true, then the star is going to start when Kaneki is back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The auction was the beginning <br>At the auction the Tower started.</br></br>  Kek<br><br>I never would have thought that Kanae would be dumb enough to run face-first into a tree. Or did he just trip into the tree?</br></br>  <br>Isn't he hitting himself because I hurt muh Shuu-sama?</br>  <br>Speaking of The Tower, from the same site  shared:<br><br> As the Fool leaves the throne of the Goat God, he comes upon a Tower, fantastic, magnificent, and familiar. In fact, The Fool, himself, helped build this Tower back when the most important thing to him was making his mark on the world and proving himself better than other men. Inside the Tower, at the top, arrogant men still live, convinced of their rightness. <br><br> Seeing the Tower again, the Fool feels as if lightning has just flashed across his mind; he thought he'd left that old self behind when he started on this spiritual journey. But he realizes now that he hasn't. He's been seeing himself, like the Tower, like the men inside, as alone and singular and superior, when in fact, he is no such thing. <br><br> So captured is he by the shock of this insight, that he opens his mouth and releases a SHOUT! And to his astonishment and terror, a bolt of actual lightning slashes down from the heavens striking the Tower and sending its residents leaping out into the waters below. <br><br> In a moment, it is over. The Tower is rubble, only rocks remaining. Stunned and shaken to the core, the Fool experiences profound fear and disbelief. But also, a strange clarity of vision, as if his inner eye has finally opened. He tore down his resistance to change and sacrifice (Hanged man), then came to terms with Death (Death); he learned about moderation and synthesis (Temperance) and about power (The Devil). But here and now, he has done what was hardest: he destroyed the lies of his life. What's left are the foundations of truth. On this he can rebuild himself. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That felt more like a FF.<br><br>Tower by the Fool's journey.<br><br> How can the Fool free himself from the Devil? Can he root out his influence? The Fool may only find release through the sudden change represented by the Tower (16). The Tower is the ego fortress each of us has built around his beautiful inner core. Gray, cold and rock-hard, this fortress seems to protect but is really a prison. <br>Sometimes only a monumental crisis can generate enough power to smash the walls of the Tower. On Card 16 we see an enlightening bolt striking this building. It has ejected the occupants who seem to be tumbling to their deaths. The crown indicates they were once proud rulers; now they are humbled by a force stronger than they.<br><br>The Fool may need such a severe shakeup if he is to free himself, but the resulting revelation makes the painful experience worthwhile. The dark despair is blasted away in an instant, and the light of truth is free to shine down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, technically, we are still at the tower, it's only when he will have his memories back that the star will begin...<br>For know,"the tower" is currently being destroyed.<br>But you know, there is two ways of seeing the star, he will not be "filled with joy" after regaining his memories.<br><br> Upright: Hope, spirituality, renewal, inspiration, serenity <br><br> Reversed: Lack of faith, despair, discouragement </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he will not be "filled with joy" after regaining his memories. <br>I know and I'm happy for it.</br></br>  <br><br>He should be happy</br></br>  <br>Makes her look creepy when she's serious and cute when she's not.</br>  <br>She still looks hot</br>  <br>little theory there:<br>Maybe the whole point of keeping Haise alive weren't to make him ghoul investigator, but to use him as a bait for some big fishes of ghoul world.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Haise¬¥s purpose just to fit with the whole devil phase?<br>He isn't getting relevant information out of the CCG, he isn't getting stronger than Kaneki, I can't think of another thing. That's why Haise is so boring.</br></br>  <br>Whether he does or doesn't is irrelevant.<br>Do you also think every person on the planet is dead because they won't be alive forever?</br></br>  Amon is probably not the final key, more like the penultimate one, or the one before that.<br>The final one will probably be either Rize, the one who was Kaneki's first interaction with the ghoul world, or Hide if he's alive, who had been his friend for the longest time and played a big role in his life.</br>   going to a shop that has open sign in front of it <br> come inside and ask if the place is still open <br>Is Haise retarded? I know your amnesia fucked up your brain but Kaneki would really want to dig your grave if you are this mentally impared.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, you see him grabbing the tree in the 6th panel.</br></br>  <br>I agree</br>  <br> or Hide if he's alive <br>I want him dead, just for the tragedy fact.</br></br>  <br>He's just being polite, if a bit overly so.<br>For all he knows Uta could have been in the process of closing up for the day.</br></br>  <br><br>Haise needs to ask permission for his very existence.</br></br>  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/17Zwq2_njezILPbhozSwR-Fq-c1iXeR<wbr>ckRj9H3MyBrVw/pubhtml<br>Any minute now.</br></wbr></wbr>  <br>The fun thing is that IShit can take days in Quality Checking but in the end they will have the usual number of errors.</br>   decent  chapter out http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo<wbr>-ghoul-re/35-dependence/1</wbr>  <br><br>This amuses me</br></br>     Kanea, are you willing to throw your family for Tsukiyamas' sake. <br>I still can understand this, aren't Kanae's family dead thanks to Matsuri?</br>   Perhaps you would like a glass of wine? <br>IS is shit as always.

Chink scan refers to Matsumae as a man in this chapter also.</br>  <br>We all know that he doesn't care for anyone beside his Kaneki and his incest family and his slaves. Yeah he is not a decent being.</br>  <br> "Matsumae-kun" <br>Girls can be called with -kun, anon.

I cannot simply accept to think as Faggotyama anything more than Faggotyama.</br></br>  <br>Does Big Madam look like a man to you?</br>  <br>The shop is always dimly lit.</br>  <br> Chink scan refers to Matsumae as a man in this chapter also. <br> As a man <br>If you mean the kun honorific.<br>Then:<br><br> There are two exceptions to the rule I mentioned above. One is at workplace, and another at school setting. Young female employees are often referred to as ‚Äúlast name + ~„Åè„Çì(kun)‚Äù. For example, Tanaka-kun(„Åü„Å™„Åã„Åè„Çì), Hashimoto-kun(„ÅØ„Åó„ÇÇ„Å®„Åè„Çì), or Yamamoto-kun(„ÇÑ„Åæ„ÇÇ„Å®„Åè„Çì) etc.. So in this case, even if the person is a female, she is referred to as her last name + ~„Åè„Çì(kun). ~„Åè„Çì(kun) = boys rule does not apply here </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read </br>  Matsumae is the only likeable one of this faggot family. If she dies and Kanae sticks around, fuck this shit man.  <br>Speedreader, Matsumae is not part of the Rosewald family.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, the servant refers to Matsumae as "he" - ÂΩº - not the arguable kun suffix. Do you think we know more about the maid than the servant who actually serves the house and have direct contect with Matsumae?</br>  <br>  Speedreader <br>Both Matsumae and Kanae are both part of the Tsukiyama family. I was referring to the Tsukiyama family in my previous comment.</br></br>  <br>My apologies if that's what you meant.</br>  <br> Do you think we know more about the maid than the servant who actually serves the house and have direct contect with Matsumae? <br>Yes. She appears in novels, the CD drama (written by Ishida) and now manga.</br></br>  <br>Haha oh wow</br>  <br> Appears in cd drama <br> has female voice <br>Do you know that Big Madam has female voice in the anime also?</br></br></br>  <br> Do you know that Big Madam has female voice in the anime also? <br>Yeah, in the anime directed by Morita, the man who ditched Ishida's scrip.<br>Care to show the moon raw?</br></br></br>  The chapter's out.  <br>Since homo prince was a little boy, Matsumae is presented as a woman (CD drama written by Ishida and based in the manga universe).</br>  <br>dumblr, did you know even your wiki is supporting the fact she's a woman.</br>   Download zip, has like half of last chapters pages instead of this chapters <br>Nice one IS</br>  <br>Moonrune is found on sen, we will discuss this matter by the time it is released. <br> ditched by Morita <br>Ishida doesn't have the authority over which seiyuu voices the character. He just has the control over the script.<br>Nevertheless, I doubt chinks make mistakes over the ÂΩº pronoun. If it is there, they have to put it as "he", not that they must change to favor fans' belief.</br></br></br></br>  They fixed it.  <br>I don't care if he or she is whatever, I was just pointing out the fact that Chinese translated the servant using "he" and Mirumo uses kun to direct Matsumae. If it is in the actual raw, no one can blame the translator.</br>  <br> Ishida doesn't have the authority over which seiyuu voices the character <br>And? All he had to do is to tell them to give Matsumae an ambiguous voice.</br></br>  <br>The kun thing is explained already. Moon bosses called their female employees with kun. And I have a hard time to believe that IS from all people put 'she' instead of 'he' is the moon raw says 'he'. You know how their landwhales love trannies.</br>  Tarot card 9 in Kanea's tears , tarot card 10 on Uta's headphones  Nothing is going to happen between Kaneki and Uta. Uta is probably say some random shit to Kaneki and then Kaneki is going back to killing his old comrades. Ishida is going to continue this foreplay until all of Kaneki's old pals are dead. You heard it here first  <br> Nothing is going to happen between Kaneki and Uta. <br>We already know that.

Ishida is just a cockteaser</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where? <br>Ask IS.</br></br>  <br>Never. He is the shit tier Made in China goods. See how there are two Ace of Hearts in the card deck and there is no 4th Joker card? Haise is the 4th Joker but he fakes it as Ace of Hearts, taking Kaneki Ken - the black hair Ken's identity.<br>All Jokers have white hair.</br></br>  I still don't get homo prince problem.<br>His Kagune is out of contro and because of that he needs to become Kakuja, but he can't because his shitty incestuous genes. Why is everyone thinking a good dish is going to fix him?</br>   Kaneki becomes the strongest investigator en ghoul hybrid after taking back control <br> Urine takes Hirako's place after Arima finishes him off and will kill himself after being forever remembered as Kaneki's subordinate b. </br>  <br> but he can't because his shitty incestuous genes <br>Where did it say that? I thought the problem was because of their weak bloodline,the shitty food is fucking him up cause it's warping the rc cells in a bad way. They want to give him only gourmet food to help him become a kakuja faster.</br></br>    <br>Because he is a spoiled brat and the people in the house always give him what he wants ever since young. They don't fucking know what is actually good for it and what is not. Imagine a son of billionaire's son in real life and he is drowning in drugs and he keeps demanding money. The parents have always complied to his demand so now with his growing needs and cry and shouting, they only give him more in the hope of satisfying him. <br><br>Whole shitty family and staff, they brought this down themselves. They are the people who are killing Tsukiyama.</br></br></br>  Can we all agree on renaming the manga to Tokyo CCG  <br>No.</br>  <br> Where did it say that? <br>Two chapters ago, I think. It was what I got. So is that? They need to give him high quality RC Cells to help him become a Kakuja?</br></br>  <br>I think I remember reading that in translated spoilers but when the IS translations came out it was different. <br> They need to give him high quality RC Cells to help him become a Kakuja? <br>Yeah that's how I saw it. He's been wanting to eat so much they have no choice but to bring him low class food. Because of how stupid his family is with that incest shit they now have easily manipulated rc cells, that while with others ghouls wouldn't really bother them it fucks up the tsukiyama family and sorta gives a reason why Shuu became the gourmet.</br></br></br>  <br>The only problem is that Shuu's a picky eater</br>  <br> why Shuu became the gourmet <br><br>Good point you make.<br>So Homo prince became goutmet because he is naturally driven to Good Food or because he knows he needs it.<br>His obsession with Kaneki points me to the first option.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only problem is that Shuu's a picky eater <br>Anon, don't make me to go back to not understand this shit.</br></br>    <br>It might be a mixture of both. His dad seems to love him a lot and he knows about their rc cells being shitty so he was probably raised up on gourmet. He grew up with his ideals of how to eat and he probably does need it. His obsession with kaneki was being next to this great meal and watching it constantly getting better and better as time went by. I'm also sorta wondering how the hell shuu thought he's be able to eat Kaneki later on unless he truly did grow to like him.</br>  <br> unless he truly did grow to like him <br>That, I don't understand.<br>Homo prince was waiting for the moment to eat Kaneki, that's why he followed everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Wasn't it obvious that he ended up thinking of him as a "friend"? I thought he was trying to stop Kaneki during the Anteiku raid because of that and that wanting to eat him was just an excuse.<br> Maybe I got it wrong, but I even remember some omake scene where Kaneki says that he doesn't consider Tsukiyama a friend but enjoys his company or some shit like that and the homo prince seemed kind of happy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm positive he always wanted to Kaneki up to the end but it still felt like at some points Shuu legit thought of Kaneki maybe not as a friend but as a good acquaintance beyond being food. That's just how I viewed it a few times when I was reading. I'm just not sure what Shuu was planning on doing if Kaneki was allowed to get even stronger cause he could one shot Shuu in a second. Maybe it was just the risk for the taste. I usually don't like bringing up tsukiyama in these threads cause anons will sperg out and call you tumblr and shit. Finally able to get others opinions.</br></br>  <br><br>This is just really confusing<br> If you remain a foul feeder <br>Foul could either stand for eating low quality meat or cannibalism. If it was cannibalism why are they still allowing him to eat other ghouls? I have a feeling that in this chapter and at the end of 34 Chie and Kanae were talking about luring Kaneki in to show Shuu that he's still alive.</br></br></br></br>  Wait, why is half the chapter of 36 from 35?  <br>Well since the dad does want him to become a kakuja so he is out of that phase I assumed it meant he eating a lot of low quality food but thinking about would low quality mean humans or ghouls? Eating ghouls is what makes a Kakuja but also could be what is fucking up his rc cells in the first place.</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Kanae is Tsukiyama's half-brother. The Roswalds were probably a branch family of the Tsukiyama family so that they could get some new blood into their gene pool (as Mirumo has pointed out, because of their thinning gene pool due to intermarrying between too close relatives, there are some problems with their kagune in regards to achieving a kakuja). Anyway, I digress. When the Roswalds were destroyed, Kanae was taken in by the "main" family (the Tsukiyamas).</br>  <br> Homo prince was waiting for the moment to eat Kaneki, that's why he followed everywhere. <br>No, that's not the case. I know /a/ hates Tsukiyama for whatever reason but if you look a bit closer into his character you'll notice that he actually enjoyed being around and respected Kaneki. He himself didn't understand that he subconsciously considered Kanki as a friend. The same happened before with Chie, he was only calling her a pet while he treated her like a friend. When he was shouting at Kaneki on the rooftop about how he won't let anything get in his way of eating Kaneki, Tsukiyama did that in order to reassure himself of his original goal in order to cope with the fear of losing his dear friend. Also judging from Kaneki's indifferent reaction to Tsukiyama's words, he already understood that Tsukiyama subconsciously already stopped pursuing his goal of eating him That's why Kaneki still kept him close, because he knew Tsukiyama poses no danger to him, due to him having already dropped the hostile intentions, towards Kaneki, within his mind.</br></br>  <br><br>Could be similar to what happened to Kaneki in the sewers (right after his fight with Amon) when his own kagune started "eating" him.<br><br>It might not be related to the process of becoming a kakuja at all. It could be because Tsukiyama's hunger is out of control. We see he's severely emancipated despite being surrounded with the remains of his meals; it might be that his obsession is forcing his body to "consume" energy at a faster rate.<br><br>Maybe becoming a kakuja is meant to help stabilize his own kagune's form?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I know /a/ hates Tsukiyama for whatever reason <br>When did this start anyway? I don't remember anyone hating in Tokyo ghoul but in :re he suddenly got hate from everywhere.<br>And I agree with everything you said. Now that I think about it Tsukiyama is someone of privileged birth but he acted like Kaneki's servant a lot of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>True, it's probably part of the kakuja progression that the mind and body just can't handle it and it's probably worse for tsukiyama cause of his weakened genes. Shuu didn't seem to understand what he was doing in his crazed state but quickly apologized for being a bother.</br>  Since kagune obviously have to be controlled through the nervous system, I'm guessing that the higher the amount of rc cells, the higher the strain on the CNS to keep up with it, which is why all the kakuja start going delirious. In Shuu's case his rx cells are also of a very fickle nature, so that exacerbates the problem.  Is Uta gonna fuck shit up thing again?  <br> Kanae is Tsukiyama's half-brother <br>No, Kanae was the son of I presume the daughter of Homo prince's grandfather.</br></br>  <br>Like with Take? I doubt it, Kaneki is not his type, he is too gullible.</br>  <br>He gives mixed vibes. In one moment he wants to be part of Kaneki's band but in the next he is fat to say how much he wants to eat Kaneki. And you can't deny that. <br><br>Personally his ethnocentrism gets on my nerves. I liked anime's episode 3's personification.</br></br></br>  <br> he is fat to say how much he wants to eat Kaneki. And you can't deny that. <br>As I said previously, Tsukiyama is obviously lying to himself that's why he was giving mixed signals.</br></br>  <br> there are some problems with their kagune in regards to achieving a kakuja <br>No, the 'problem' is that they can become kakuja more easily, that's what was implied, as their kakuhou cells are more prone to mutations.<br><br> Kanae is Tsukiyama's half-brother <br>No. Kanae is from a different family. Not even a branch.<br><br><br> No, Kanae was the son of I presume the daughter of Homo prince's grandfather. <br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No <br>No my butt, read and put attention.</br></br>    <br>Yeah, the late master of the Rosewald family, left his heir in Germany.<br>Your point?</br></br>  <br>Finally, thanks based Chart Anon.<br>You and N Anon are the few constants of the TG threads. Gives some semblance of sanity to them.</br></br>  <br>Put attention of who and what is told. Tsukiyama's servants are talking about a late master, homo prince's father's dad. How the hell Tsukiyama's servants would know a german man?<br>Also, he [the late master] left [this is the key word. left, not is left] a grandkid.<br>My little anon can't be this dumb.</br></br></br>  <br> Tsukiyama's servants are talking about a late master, homo prince's father's dad <br>Or maybe it's because the Rosewalds were also a wealthy, well-renowned family?<br>They obviously knew about the Rosewalds, why wouldn't they know who the head of the family is?<br><br>You make no sense. Kanae was part of a wealthy family that was contacted by the Tsukiyamas to get some new blood into their gene pool. Being Tsukiyama's cousin would make no sense (unless you think the Rosewalds started breeding with the Tsukiyamas a WHILE back, which I doubt and we should stick to the simplest possible explanation when there's not enough information available).</br></br></br></br></br>   (me)(cont.)<br> (unless you think the Rosewalds started breeding with the Tsukiyamas a WHILE back) <br>I doubt this is the case or we would have more ghouls (from Tsukiyama's family) with different kagunes, who would be mistaken for Rosewald ghouls, as per: http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo<wbr>-ghoul-re/33-embracing-books/6</wbr></br></br>  <br> Or maybe it's because the Rosewalds were also a wealthy, well-renowned family? <br>Why mere servants would know a rich family from another country?<br> why wouldn't they know who the head of the family is? <br>Point above.<br> Kanae was part of a wealthy family that was contacted by the Tsukiyamas to get some new blood into their gene pool <br>Nice FF, post proves and manga panels.<br> Being Tsukiyama's cousin would make no sense <br>It does, dumb. A daughter (likely) traveled to Germany and married and fucked a german man, said daughter was the sister of homo prince's dad, hence why the servants said the late master left a grandson in Germany. <br>This is also supported by homo prince's speech "You are my removed brother". And also would explain why Kanae has the Tsukiyama's color hair. <br> which I doubt and we should stick to the simplest possible explanation when there's not enough information available <br>For what I said, there is. for your shitty FF there isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why mere servants would know a rich family from another country? <br>Firstly, because they knew about their defeat, which implies they knew about the Rosewalds, as they were a prominent European ghoul family, much like Tsukiyama. Secondly, because wealthy ghoul families aren't common, and servants usually do hear a LOT. Haven't you heard the expression 'the walls have ears'?<br><br><br> It does, dumb. A daughter (likely) traveled to Germany and married and fucked a german man, said daughter was the sister of homo prince's dad, hence why the servants said the late master left a grandson in Germany.  <br>And in the same panel he said they were separated by blood, retard.<br>Nice fanfic.<br><br>What I said about bringing new blood into the gene pool was indeed pure speculation.<br><br> And also would explain why Kanae has the Tsukiyama's color hair.  <br>Ah yes... I suppose that could be said for every blonde person in the world then. :^]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Firstly, because they knew about their defeat, which implies they knew about the Rosewalds <br>Yes, because his masters talked about them or talk them about it. Without that they wouldn't know it. <br>  Secondly, because wealthy ghoul families aren't common <br>One thing: give proof.<br>Second thing: You are giving me the reason, if ghouls family are that rare it would be more difficult to know about them.<br> And in the same panel he said they were separated by blood, retard. <br>They are separated by blood because Kanae isn't a Tsukiyama, he is separated by two generations from homo prince.<br>  I suppose that could be said for every blonde person in the world then <br>We are talking about a manga, retarded and a manga whose author put special attention to details. Now are you going to say Hikari isn't Yomo's sister?<br>What I'm saying is supported by manga and you only post a single page to prove your debate that I can deny easily.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, because his masters talked about them or talk them about it. Without that they wouldn't know it. <br>Nice headcanon. <br><br> One thing: give proof. <br>My proof is Tokyo Ghoul (not :Re). Everything that was said about ghouls, and the fact we've only seen two influential ghoul families, one of which has already been exterminated.<br><br> if ghouls family are that rare it would be more difficult to know about them <br>Or maybe they are rare because they stood out and were annihilated. Tsukiyama is known to most ghouls.<br><br> They are separated by blood because Kanae isn't a Tsukiyama, he is separated by two generations from homo prince. <br>Sorry, but my first degree cousin and I are not separated by blood, and if that were the case, Mirumo would have referred to Kanae as his nephew, and Kanae would refer to him as his uncle.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeff<wbr>icient_of_relationship<br><br> Now are you going to say Hikari isn't Yomo's sister? <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127581453#p127609132">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everything that was said about ghouls, and the fact we've only seen two influential ghoul families <br>The fact that richfags like the ones at the Auction must had told you something (many participated in the auction of the actor). <br> Or maybe they are rare because they stood out and were annihilated. <br>Point above, also many fags in the ghoul restaurant and Big Madam.<br> Mirumo would have referred to Kanae as his nephew, and Kanae would refer to him as his uncle <br>These characters are japanese and richfags, get more informed, dumb. Richfags tend to send their kids to another families to serve as their servants, the less powerful branch of the family did this too. <br>  but not because of their hair colour <br>Tsukiyamas are known for their hair color, how many characters in manga do you know with it? Ishida does this kind of stuff, but retarders like you can't see it. <br> No you can't, and didn't <br>Yes. And if you want I can make a colleague using the manga. <br>Kanae is related with the Tsukiyamas (CHAPTER 32, PAGE 14 and PAGE 17), this would explain why Kanae has a japanese name http://www.thenamemeaning.com/kanae<wbr>/.</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What anime have you dropped so far? <br>What will you continue to watch?<br><br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br><br>A plot about BB guns and also fujoshit so auto drop.

Still, it's a pretty good pretense to go ecchi.</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, her bangs are stupid.</br>  <br>If you seemingly also dropped previous Symphogear, why did you even watch the first episode of the third season. Is this just a shitty bait thread?</br>  <br> hates fujoshit <br> likes Gangsta <br><br>Why is OP such a flaming idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> STOP <br> WITH <br> THE <br> FUJOSHIT <br> JAPAN <br>Fujos just have more money. You know what they say in Japan: it can't be helped.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How are people already dropping shit? Only one episode has aired. I've enjoyed everything so far. Only one that seems the weakest of the bunch is Classroom Crisis, but it might change around 3-4 episodes.  <br>I generally give most things a shot, but it's easy to tell whether or not it's something I'd be into after just one episode. I don't really see a point in continuing with a show that straight up doesn't interest me.</br>  Nothing is bad enough to drop yet, but I don't see Laplace surviving three episodes for me unless the mystery is better than what I foresee. The TANOSHII mc is fun though.  <br>Have you really enjoyed everything? Even this stinking pile of fujoshit?</br>  Why no Castle Town Dandelion subs?<br><br>I'm about to watch it raw.</br></br>  <br>Beats me, I was looking forward to it too.<br> I'm about to watch it raw. <br> Always wear protection. </br></br></br>  <br>I do feel that the real way to tell is if the pacing is bad and you are not really sure what the main conflict is or if it takes too long to get to it. OR if the main conflict isn't gripping enough. <br><br>Sometimes a show can do a 180 by the 3rd episode though. Some take a little time to really set up things to get the ball rolling. <br><br>Example: I was so bored with the first episode I saw of School Days that I dropped it. Then, I heard about the last episode getting preempted, because that girl had chopped off her dad's head and I knew that I had to go back to watch. On the flipside I dropped shows with great beginnings only for them to pan out into an utter drag. You, truly, just never know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as it has a good story and great characters it doesn't matter if it's: harem, self-insert otaku shit, fujoshit, yuribait, yaoi, moe or whatever.</br>  <br>I only pick up 1 or two shows a season that I already am sure I will enjoy so I usually only drop stuff from my backlog.</br>  <br>I'm watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu because I loved how balls out fun the last two anime were that I watched that had characters shooting at each other with fake guns. <br><br>Sure, they were both yurishit with an all female cast but at least this anime is bringing something new to the table with more boys.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the same old shit.</br>  <br> fujoshit  <br> bad <br>It's a million times better than muh cute gurls doing cute things</br></br></br>  Rokka no Yuusha has the best first episode so far, that shit was great.   complains about fujoshi  <br> fine with ecchi  <br>lol</br></br>  KILL<br>ALL<br>FUJOSHIT<br>FAGGOTS<br><br>YOU RUIN EVERY ANIME</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> guys tend to like shit targeted towards guys and stay away from things targeted to girls <br>What an amazing observation, you deserve a Nobel Prize.</br></br>  <br> complains about and automatically drops what might be fujoshi bait <br> ecchi gets a pass </br></br>  <br><br>Homos/females on their periods detected</br></br>  <br>Nah man this is why I learned Japanese. This and nukige.</br>  <br>Oy vey are you implying that men and women aren't the same?!</br>  <br>You hate fujoshit but you like Gangsta? I've got bad news for you, OP.</br>  <br>Since when did the 3 episode rule become to widely disregarded? It seems more commonplace to drop a new show the second something appears on screen that you dislike.</br>  <br> Wants me to watch Fujoshit dick bait </br>  <br> Likes ecchishit but hates anything that might be decent simply because it's aimed at women <br> Doesn't even actually know what "fujoshi" means <br><br>Cancer killing /a/, right here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off women.</br>  <br>Why do you keep posting the same line over and over.</br>  <br>It's the usual crop of newfags.</br>  <br><br> newfags <br>Yeah no. Your standards are too low. Watch more anime.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Yeah, OP is huge hypocrite.</br></br></br></br>  How do we kill homosexuals in the anime industry?  <br>I have over 2400 hours watched. Once I hit that point I stopped keeping track.</br>  <br>Start with OP</br>  <br> I'm a hypocrite because I'm a man who likes pussy and not dick </br>  <br> y-you just haven't seen enough anime <br>Fuck off with this deflection. If you warrant a series to be shit upon episode 1 then you shouldn't have picked it up to begin with.<br><br>Get better are understanding your tastes.</br></br></br></br>  Is this the faggot thread?  <br>What's the 4th mouth?</br>  <br>Watch more newfag.</br>  <br>the butt</br>  <br>Yes.</br>   Gangsta  <br> NonNonBiyori repeat  <br> Rokka no yuusha <br> Durarara x2 ten <br> prison school <br>That's what am watching<br>Inb4 Gangsta is the best anime I've seen in a while now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pussy, butt, mouth.

Roughly 150 episodes worth of 300 manga chapters or so.</br>  <br>Yeah but those are episodic plots without much of an arc.</br>  <br>Probably around 400. There's a project called One Pace that attempts to edit the episodes to a reasonable pace. For current episodes it looks like it's usually three episodes combined to one. Prior to episode 300 the pacing wasn't too bad, but it could have probably been better.</br>  i've done a bit of searching and i still dont understand why fujitora wont act against doffy, someone care to explain?   mfw chapter 800 soon </blockquote>]
