[ Getting real fucking tired of these eyes. I know all harem MC's are meant to be empty husks for self-insertion, but this is taking it too far. No ability to read emotion whatsoever.  also smith-san is best girl  Best girl  <br>How does one go about mating with Cerea</br>  <br> empty husks for self-insertion <br><br>If he was a self-insert then he'd be all about the monster girls<br><br>Instead he's a leg-man</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're there so he gets 100x manlier when he has manly eyes</br>  Would you be able to last all night with the snake bitch   Shedding chapter skipped <br><br>Anime ruined, time to go</br></br>  <br>BD specials son.</br>  <br>There isn't anything like that mentioned for those</br>  <br>Why did they close his eyes? They're trying to make him more beta</br>  <br>Gotta get to Rachnee faster.</br>    <br>Saddle up and mount her.</br>  <br>Imagine fucking a horse.</br>  <br>That's great</br>  <br>I'm more disappointed this won't be in full color.</br>  <br>so you can self insert i guess. The guy that they want people to self insert into cant be more alpha than the audience ...then why give him eyes?</br>  It's there to show his constant state of bewilderment with how his life's turned out.  It's funny they kept Miia's face from that small panel  <br>Mr hands pls</br>  He's the worst part of the show and sadly, he takes all the screen time  how can you guys enjoy this without nipples    That series is garbage and people who like are fucking disgusting.  <br>The fanbase is full of crossboarders so it's baby first harem for them.</br>  <br>So, what are you doing here, faggot?</br>  <br>They probably compile shedding and director chapters in one episode.</br>  <br>You mean the shedding happens and then the next day/half of episode is the director stuff?</br>  <br>Yes, and next episode is Ranchee's appearing and jealous Centorea chapters.</br>  Secondaries, secondaries everywhere.  <br>Nice meme!</br>  <br>Why would you care about secondaries in a harem adaptation<br> implying there's plot or any notable character development </br></br>  <br> not liking anti spiral darling <br><br>Get a load of this new faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br>First, you discard any dignity you still have.</br></br>  <br> x, x everywhere <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Posts like this <br>Are why secondaries are the cancer of any franchise.</br></br>  <br> Not liking anti spiral eyes <br>Get the fuck out of here animeonlyfag</br></br>  <br>You fags screaming secondaries left and right are just as bad</br>  <br><br>Easily.<br><br>Sheer willpower would allow me to, solely because it was with Miia,</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't that post imply he read the manga? Darling's eyes are open.</br>  <br>How does reading the manga change the opinion about his faggot eyes?</br>  <br>Are you crazy? Next episode will be the shedding chapter and Suu arriving.</br>  The horse girl is the best because she is cute  <br>You mean Suu surviving. Look at the preview</br>  <br>MCs being clueless to a specific scene(s) in general isn't limited to haremshit.</br>  Papi &gt; Smith = Miia &gt; Cerea<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br> Not including more girls </br>  <br>Which is why it's such a shame that she's attached to a big ugly horse body.</br>  <br>Well, sweet slime rape will begin. I have nothing to complain about.</br>  <br> ugly <br>She's big, strong, powerful, and built. <br><br>You can always rely upon her.</br></br></br></br>  Anime Papi is cute as hell compared to Manga Papi  <br>Yeah right.</br>  <br>Yeah she gave that "loli imouto" vibe this series was lacking</br>  <br>Anime Papi is cute but her voice gets a little weird</br>  <br>Manga Papi's better</br>  <br>It's the voice</br>  <br> cant, only ntr  probably fist her</br>  <br>Confirmed for not knowing shit</br>  <br><br> Wanting to fuck horse pussy <br>Cerea is great, it's the horse bit I have a problem with, horses are disgusting unless Z-ton draws them </br></br></br>      <br><br>Cute? Yes.<br><br>Cuter than Miia? Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> birdbrain or normal human <br> superior to Lamia </br></br></br>  <br>I find it encouraging that the show is popular enough for so many people to come on and insult it. Its a compliment really, unpopular things tend to get ignored.</br>  <br>The trouble is the "character development" people seem to want tends to be things that would end a major element of its comedy (i.e. more of the girls figuring out how to not hurt Kimihito), or end the series itself (him picking one or all the girls). On the latter, as much as I would like to see Kimihito's married life, it seems unlikely the series would be as popular if it focused on that.<br><br>Also, given how the series has covered only a pretty short span of time (a couple months at most), its had a reasonable amount of character development. Course much of that has been revealing just who the characters already are in more detail.</br></br></br>  <br>Ive watched the scene like 5 times already where she introduces her, its just too adorable</br>   Yfw they skip the MON chapter so there's more Mero early   <br> &gt;Wanting to fuck horse pussy <br>No, I want Cerea not a horse.</br></br>  <br> only 5 times <br>I've watched that first half at least 2 dozen times by now, I get a heart attack every time</br></br>  <br><br> hurting MC <br> comedy <br><br>do people actually think this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> horses are disgustingunless Z-ton draws them <br>Horitomo centaurs are cute too.</br></br>  <br>I think they're supposed to laugh when he gets hurt sometimes. I self insert instead</br>  <br>Horitomo can go fuck himself after the last doujin he made</br>  <br>I don't like NTR too. But the story of the donkey centaur, the tsundere lizard and others doujins are nice and heartwarming.</br>  <br>supposedly a handsome guy makes her hot and then another centaur fucks her like horses do</br>  <br>But Cerea has a big fat stinky horse cunt, you can't get around it anon.</br>  <br>I do as well<br><br>I really want Miia to rape me and hug me so tight and close that she breaks a rib when we both cum at the same time and I impregnate her</br></br></br>  BEST<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>GIRL<br>I<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I just unlocked the 1500 point second letter for Miia<br><br>Can someone translate?</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna go home and re watch it and then EP 3 since I forgot it released yesterday</br>  <br>Or you know, kick the centaur on the head and fuck her yourself</br>  <br>This. Please shut up.</br>  <br>What if a centaur woman was a shotacon?</br>   two weeks until worst girl   <br>Shes a big girl</br>  <br>But two weeks for MON.</br>  <br>2 years until monstergirls invade the real world</br>  <br>this was the 1100 pic for Miia? haven't seen it until now</br>  Well the MC could be worse I guess. He could be Kampher 2.0  <br>do centaurs sport more pair of tits on their horse parts<br><br>and why is she covering her horse part chest? Her genitals is way behind her.</br></br></br>  <br>Cerea is incredibly moe.</br>  <br>Ya, I unlocked it awhile ago<br>I also have those 3 face response app things that I can post when I get home<br>And I posted her second letter a bit earlier in the thread</br></br></br>  <br>The more clothing they put on Miia, the more she looks like a worm.</br>  <br>Sasuga Chiyo Sakura</br>  <br>Imagine Monmusu with Muromi instead of Mero. Or even better, Levia-san. I mean, just any fish who's actually interesting.</br>  I like Miia, she's cute.  What if mero's dad is a serial killer  <br>Its allowed to be considered funny in part because he recovers so fast. And given he tends to get hurt unintentionally I find it a lot more tolerable than the mean-spirited "how dare you accidentally touch me" injuries harem MCs suffer in other series.<br><br>It also makes Rachnera look better so that's a plus. ^_^ I do have to suspend some disbelief though that the other girls still haven't learned better how to control themselves (perhaps if, like Rachnera, they ever inflicted an injury that lasted more than a few panels they would take things more seriously).</br></br></br>  <br> Levia instead of Mero <br><br>Best show.</br></br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off back to plebbit, you shitfuck</br></br>  <br> ^_^ <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  Kind of a weird thing to notice but I did too. I think they took it a bit too far in the last episode.  Not going to lie: the jokes aren't really landing for me the second time around. Watching the anime is just reminding me of all the things I didn't like about the manga like the non-entity of an MC  <br>I'm only watching it for scenes with my waifu</br>  <br>It's not just ass and tits man. Legs also work well with a good ass and tits.</br>  <br>It's a good thing I don't take things here seriously, I guess that face has negative connotations here. Consider me naïve.</br>  <br>Consider what we know of the other parents, unlikely. He's probably a human prince or something that gave up his royalty to be with Mero's mom.</br>  <br> Miia <br>They are all cuter than her.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense if mero mom is royalty Then why would he give up royalty</br>  <br>Aside from parodying morons from other sites, emoticons haven't been considered acceptable on 4chan for at least 5 years.</br>  <br>Indeed.</br>  MON SQUAD WHEN?<br>LALA WHEN?</br>  <br>smith a shit.<br>that pig voice.</br></br>  <br> talking shit about Yu Kobayashi <br><br>This is some poor bait. Not even worth a bait image.</br></br></br>  <br>think whatever you want.</br>  <br>I have nothing against people liking Lala, but you have to admit that she is the most underdeveloped character so far.</br>  <br>MON in two weeks.<br><br>Lala never.</br></br></br>  <br>This being terrible bait is a fact, anon.</br>  <br>Sure, but I feel like she has the most potential for development. <br><br>I mean, I like her this much despite the lack of development. I will love her with some development, I imagine.</br></br></br>  <br>Cereas ears.<br><br>I wanna touch them a play with them.</br></br></br>  <br>A bit longer than that <br>I remember people being shat on for it back in 2007</br></br>  <br> Lala never <br> implying </br></br>  <br>I want to nibble them while she squirms and pants.</br>  Which one of Zombina's eyes is originally hers, the yellow one or green one?  <br>I pretty much only come on here to see comments on Monster Musume, read the translations from Translator Fag etc. I know little of general 4chan stuff.</br>  <br>Where the he'll are you people coming from?</br>  Wouldn't this anime if better if they weren't monsters?<br><br>If it was just 3 cute girls all dating Darling-kun with the intent of marrying him?</br></br>  <br>Look kid, lemme help you not embarrass yourself and also not make this place more of a shithole than it already is. I'll give you a little bit of advice.<br>Stop posting.</br></br>  Ok so a Scylla is next. Predictions on her personality or the awkward situation Kimihito will be placed in?  <br> Wouldn't this anime if better if they weren't monsters? <br>Absolutely not</br></br>  <br>No, that's stupid.</br>  <br>GET.....OUT</br>  <br>You're mean</br>  <br>That's fucking sick</br>  <br>I've been reading and posting about the Musume threads here for over a year, no reason to stop over one emoticon. In fact, I think this is the first time I've offended anybody here.</br>  Will Darling get any more harem members, or will is just be monsters of the week from now on like the farm chapter?  What's the point of including a girl if she has no chance of winning?  <br>I think the house is crowded enough. Hell Lala doesnt really have that much of a reason to be there</br>  <br>leave and don`t come back</br>  <br>But this way, the monster is on the outside of the girl.</br>  <br>Where did you come from</br>  <br> we want the pedo audience<br>i see her more as a sister than an actual competitor</br></br>  Anybody got the English lamia subspecies end thingy?  <br> pedo <br> same age as the others <br> body isnt even young looking, just petite </br></br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>The fuck you mean papi isn't winning?</br>  <br>But Horse pussy's already there.</br>  <br>not even in the running really, her and Suu are in the same boat of being adopted daughters or sisters like you said</br>     mfw anime-only fags popping up all over the place   <br>None of them are in the running.<br><br>It will be a harem end or nothing.</br></br></br>    <br>I need the practice, so I transcribed it as best I can. Like the others, Miia's second note is basically an apology for some unspecified thing, she says she likes that he takes care of them, and she loves him. Wait for TF or someone with a better grasp than I for high quality translation.<br><br> だぁりん <br>  <br> このまえは、怒ってごめんね。 <br>  <br> だぁりん、私のこと想って言ってくれたのに。 <br> ほんとうに、ごめんあさい。 <br>  <br> いつも優しくしてくれるだぁりんが、 <br> 私は大好きです。 <br>  <br> だぁりんとずー、一緒にいられるように、 <br> これからはちゃんと言うこと聞くね。 <br>  <br> だぁりん、大好きだよ。 <br>  <br> ミーア </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this one gets it</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Everyone assumes its a harem ending, which it very well may be. But hypothetically, what if Crabman did decide to have a single victor? How would that even go over for the fanbase?</br>    <br>How can Darling-kun afford to feed these girls? He mentioned Miia and Papi ate a lot and I'm sure Cerea eats like a literal horse. how is he not broke? Does he ever work?</br>  <br>he would probably get murdered</br>  <br>Government</br>  <br>Later explained in the manga</br>  <br>Possibly, but Id give the crab points for having the balls to do so.</br>  <br>Explain?<br><br>I forgot about keeping up with the manga long ago. Didn't even read until Suu's arrival.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga</br>    <br>Welfare money. Liberals will defend this.</br>  <br>Read the bloody manga</br>  <br>These are pretty bad. I thought I remembered downloading one where they didn't just try to type over the Japanese.</br>  <br>Well first off shame on you. But as for your answer, Kurusu was struggling with a budget until he found out Smith would compensate those expenses.</br>  <br><br>Nah.<br><br>There are many leeches on this board.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of the monster jokes wouldn't be there.</br>  Will you faggots ever stop spoonfeeding  <br>as long as it gives me qt3.14 monstergirls</br>  <br>I absolutely will not read the Manga</br>  <br>And also posting the original Japanese.<br><br>Anyone know what font I should use? I'm gonna redo these so the words don't cover any more than the original Japanese text did. Because muh Crabman's art.</br></br></br>  <br>then don't complain when you don' get something</br>    <br>Olive Garden serves a better pasta than this...</br>  <br>I dunno why, but the combination of ridiculously large tits, the way she dresses and her horse body makes her unbelievably repulsive to me. Like vomit-inducing repulsive. I feel physically ill whenever I see her on screen.</br>  <br>I feel physically ill when I see your posts.</br>  <br>You're the one complaining</br>  <br>I'm not even a Cereafag and I think you're a faggot</br>  <br> That's just you wanting to throw up all that shit from having shit taste.</br>  <br><br>flying miia is the best.</br></br>  <br><br> sametails <br>Crabman is a hack.</br></br></br>  <br>So is God, because every snake with the exception of rattle snakes have the same tail. Rattlesnakes are the SJWs of the snake world, because "LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH, SILLY SERPENTS!"</br>  <br>If you see just her face, she's cute, but the further down you go, the worse it gets.</br>  What did the author do before this and his other series got published? He only had those small doujins before that, right? Assistant work or something?  <br>Posting the other English one as well. Too troublesome to directly transfer from phone to netbook.</br>  <br><br>Not him but I haven't even touched the anime. What chapter do they explain that? At ch. 21 by the way.</br></br>  <br>Sometime after chapter 21.</br>  <br>And as a manga only fag, how is the anime so far? Because like I said I haven't touched it yet.</br>  <br> SECONDARY DETECTED <br><br>Also use the fucking catalog you secondary piece fo shit.</br></br></br>  <br> You will never pet a Medusa's head. <br><br>God is a true bastard.</br></br></br>  <br>its almost exact except for the censorship here and there</br>  <br>Average</br>  <br>I like lamias, but logically Centorea sp? really is the best girl she hurts the mc far less then the others and really looks out for him its actually pretty touching.</br>  <br>Animated monstergirls but censorship everywhere</br>  <br>Imagine the shits she must take...</br>  <br>Anime voices match manga voices</br>  <br>Just as shallow and cute, I read the manga a few years back how did that end up?</br>  <br>Meaning the voices are what you expected to sound like?</br>  <br> SECONDARY </br>  <br>What if you use an actual horse?</br>  <br>Hell no, the only good voices for now are Cerea and Smith's</br>    In the translation of the Manga I read, Papi calls Darling "Husband", but she calls him Master in the anime. I really dislike that she's being used as the loli-body train for the incest and maid fanbases.  Which is better and why?    I never got around to watching Evangelion, but Escaflowne was the first subbed anime I watched, and to this date is still my favourite take on fantasy settings.<br><br>Evangelion... I'm not really sure why I have put it off this long, but with all the remakes of the same series, it's seeming a bit silly. I'd just want to watch the original series from the 90s.</br></br>  <br>Rahxephon</br>  <br>Infinite Ryvius</br>  <br>I'd put NGE off for years but I'm finally watching it now, it's great just do it.</br>  <br>wow, what shitty bait<br>Of course evangelion is better you fucking faggot</br></br>  <br>Escaflowne. While I did love eva it really didnt age well. I can go back to Escaflowne and still enjoy it</br>  <br>if you haven't watched evangelion you need to leave<br><br>maybe go blog on mal or something okay?</br></br></br>    Escaflowne is pretty shit entry level anime. But it will be seem good once you start watching more anime  <br>This doesn't make sense</br>  I enjoyed watching Escaflowne much more than I did watching Eva, but the ending was kind of limp. If only there were a few more episodes to give that ending a little more weight, it would be a real masterpiece. As it is, it's just a really good show, one that I look forward to revisiting in a year or so.  <br>The one that has the penguin</br>  <br> threads talk more about NGE than the actual show <br>No, and the fans know it.</br></br>  MC was a fucking slut  <br>Escaflowne was much more consistent in its quality but Evangelion had more memorable highs.<br>Evangelion also had better visual design.</br></br>  <br>I disagree <br><br>they both look pretty impressive</br></br></br>  <br>NGE because it has MAI WAIFU</br>   Escaflowne thread <br> people not posting glorious Escaflowne <br><br>step it up /a/</br></br></br>  Kuso teitoku, die!

Key just makes it worse I think. <br><br>Nagiasu, Glasslip and Shirobako had this problem too.</br></br></br>  <br>Perfection cannot be shown by mere pictures drawn by worshipers.

Nao says "yes."  I'm so glad to have started watching anime again just in time to experience Nao Tomori.  <br>Look at that waist/hip/thigh ratio and tell me it's not fucked. There is plenty of good Nao art out there, some even better than the anime art.<br><br>I'll concede that other than the proportions being fucked it's a pretty nice pic. colouring wise.</br></br></br>  <br>Because of people like you, Nao has to keep her shoes on.</br>  <br>When I rape the slut, I'll make sure to stat by taking her boots and socks off.</br>  Why is she so fucking smug goddamnit  <br>I never knew what I was missing until Nao.</br>  I want to give her sweet anal sex.  <br> Looking cute while eating, is that even possible? <br>Is this your first anime?</br></br>  <br>She has super powers and combat training. You'd get your bitch ass kicked.</br>  <br>It only adds to her perfection.</br>  <br>I greatly look forward to the rape doujins. She annoys the fuck outta me but damn if she doesn't have a great design.

Nao isn't very happy.</br></br></br></br>    I guess no thread is safe from summer fags getting angry over file names  <br>Her voice is shit. It's annoying and all nasely</br>  Nao that I have all your attentions  <br>Drop your panties and spread you nethers.</br>  I want to have sex with a twin tailed high school girl than can turn invinsible.  <br>Maybe you already are.</br>  <br>You must be tone deaf because you clearly can't recognize beauty from loser.<br>but in all seriousness, how the fuck do you tell any of the female's voices apart without dubs? Everyone sounds exactly the same in Japanese.</br></br>  <br><br>Only in death will Nao be free from perverts like you  Hopefully I didn't jinx anything ;_; </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128422549 <br>Don't worry. I can tell which one is Nao tho. Perfection can't be mistaken.</br>  It's not every day that Nao sees two homos trying to rape each other, but Nao isn't on /a/ every day either.  <br>The way she bounced there was so erotic.</br>  <br>She got hit while turning a corner, so the momentum caused her to rotate.</br>  <br>Perfectly annoying, you say? Impossible, she's at the peak already.<br><br> Yu a best. I have hope in chapter 4. </br></br></br>  <br>Another delusional, let me show you the wonders of living in the Nao and not focusing on Yu-self.</br>  <br>Don't you even wonder what Nao has recorded on that camera?</br>  <br>Do you feel the need to be accepted?</br>  <br>I have the solution for you</br>  <br>It comes in the form of Nao, because she'll always accept you <br> But not really because she's just a 2d girl in a fictional story, so don't get too obsessed with her. Go outside and socialize with diverse groups if you really want to feel accepted. </br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is Yu? Anyway let's just ignore all the facebook shitposting. We're waiting Mod, please read the post before deleting them. Just because it was reported doesn't mean all of it is shitposting.<br><br>Also I kind of afraid the way this show going. I mean look at it. Already 4 episode, and it's going for baseball filler? There should be some twist in this right?<br>Knowing it's just 13 episodes, shouldn't we enter the main plot already?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Evidence and footage for when she turns every single sample (as in: person with powers) to her master, the trusted person, who is also known as the leader of the scientists. </br>  <br>has anime ever seen such an inconsistent and haphazardly written character?</br>  <br>I don't. I just need Yu-sama to go back to his cheating and society-disturbing ways instead of this annoying, not even interesting Mary Sue, but hell if you guys are strong as, no, perhaps stronger than the Iroha defense squad back then.</br>  <br>Perfection doesn't wait my friend, perfection is just what it is.</br>  I want to  pat  Nao on the  head  and  tell her it'll be okay .  <br>You mean like a real person?</br>  <br>Oh hey there Eggman autist. I knew you'd fall for my bait. Works like fucking clockwork. Also try to deny  this happening. It's me. You and your fellows know it will and must be like this.</br>  <br>I see someone else sees the perfection in Nao. Here's your complementary Nao.</br>  <br>Don't be silly.

It was the exact same bullshit with Angel Beats. It is obvious as fuck that they're going to rake in dough, they can afford to take risks and make it a full 24 ep season. Everything Maeda touches turns into gold for fuck's sake.<br>I'll bet you this will have a rushed, midly satisfying, but bitter and sad ending like Angel Beats too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, if I like both then...</br>  <br>Why is she such a bitch?</br>  Given the situation she’s in now, what will Tomori do once everyone’s older and no longer has powers? There’s no guarantee that the members of the Student Council will stay with her afterwards, and the fact that she doesn’t have any other friends at the moment makes you wonder how well she’d do in a future without the club, the goal it gives her, and the people it helps her interact with. One could argue her solitary nature will help her get through regardless, but there’s a measure of added difficulty involved. Otosaka’s use of his powers to gain academic prestige bodes similarly in regards to how he’d survive in the real world without his abilities in the short-term, and everything here reeks of a potential future where the use of their powers could yield problems they never even considered.  <br> is good writing by just throwing together a load of random personality quirks taken from the normal archetypes</br>  <br> Tomori has something of a bad personality. <br> Of the main girls in this anime, the one that isn't the sister is prone and accustomed to violence. <br> It's unfortunate, really, that this girl is shows a propensity towards violent outbursts to the point where each almost a banality; each one is almost expected. <br> I don't want a girl accustomed to violence and bad-mouthing other people. <br><br>so japan hates nao the same way japan hated ange from cross ange?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The opening really grew on me. I thought it was lame at first but now I'm starting to like it more than Angel Beats' OP. Kimi dake wo is still the best though.    <br> badly written character <br> still extremely attractive <br> dick &gt; brain </br></br></br>  <br>He's just cherry picking posts. That shitposter really loves to shit on Nao for some reason.<br><br>I can find posts saying that Nao is cute too so fucking what?<br><br>全体的にキャラ造形が古臭いのに友利ちゃんだけ妙に可愛い<br><br>奈緒個人的には可愛いと思う。ツンデレとは違う感じがまた良い。 <br>あと、歩未。こんな妹ほしい。<br><br>http://www.logsoku.com/r/2ch.sc/ani<wbr>me/1437474919/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this refers to the design and external appearance, we are talking about personality, writing, actions and deeds.</br>  <br>beautiful comments that shame as most are related to her outside, and not the role and what it does in anime.<br>if more endeavor in next time.</br></br>  <br>but really for some reason, we find messages, saying that what she does is right, the way you act is right, his personality is beautiful.<br>Yes we find messages for external beauty, only to masturbators.</br></br>  <br>Actually, I'm pretty sure the fact that she's changing personality every episode is just the fact that she's trying way too hard to seem kooky and likeable, when she's just a monotone asshole.</br>  Why is this show called Charlotte?  <br>Irohas is superior.</br>  <br>75 cycles, charlotte Comet</br>  <br>Iroha in Japan is the least has fan</br>  <br>Japs have shit taste. More at 11.</br>  <br>They have good taste They do not like girls who choose the handsome and popular guy and take one in October<br>Then use another guy as a second option only to forget the blonde pussy</br></br>  <br>It's not random at all. It uses a user generated number and iirc a timestamp too. I've actually doxed people who posted facebook pictures anonymously. Twitter users a semi random sequence of numbers and letters in upper and lower case however.</br>  Is this show worth watching already?  <br>Not to mention the bad past, how many times anime used that cliche? we've seen characters change personality because of bad past so many times, her personality just remind me of how Yankee acts and there's nothing special about it.</br>  <br>This is true.<br>If I remember correctly it's the middle number that will bring you right to the photo on facebook if you put it in the URL.</br></br>  <br>This gif makes my dick hard, there's something wrong with me.</br>  Nao's got that sexy teasing attitude. Makes me want to chase after her. But I'd rather someone with more attitude like Haruhi and destroy mind break her.<br><br>Either way works though.</br></br>  I'll keep the question simple, Overlord or GATE?  Overlord  Both are shit  <br>GATE. Overlord is another SAO tryhard with bad animation and characters.</br>  <br>How much screen time does this semen demon get? Really makes or breaks if I pick this up</br>  <br> source material <br>GATE<br><br> anime adaptation <br>Overlord</br></br></br></br></br>  man, Overlord sure is slow as fuck  easily gate  <br>Both are pretty mediocre. Overlord though has superior waifus.<br><br>A-1 also fucked up character designs for Gate. Can these fuckers do anything right?</br></br></br>  GATE was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism, but the start was better than anything in Overlord (I've read the first 3 volumes).   Gate: 24 eps <br> Overlord: 13 eps <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>  <br>More.</br>  <br>Overlord. <br><br>GATE gets retarded with a 40 chapter drama bullshit with the Elf going crazy.</br></br></br>  <br> 3eps already fucked up for nothing </br>  <br> was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism  <br>You have no right to have this opinion if you're an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>I'm not and I find American jingoism more tolerable because they actually have the power to back it up. Japan does not.</br>  <br>but a broken elf is best elf.</br>  <br> American jingoism more tolerable <br> says the 'murrican while pretending to be not american </br></br>  <br>The difference is that America is actually a military superpower, while Japan doesn't even have an existing army</br>  <br>Why would I lie? My point still stands. America has the most powerful military in the world whereas Japan is America's bitch.</br>  What if the only reason GATE exists is to encourage jingoism and radical nationalism in Japan among otaku?  <br>Doesn't matter. It's still fiction and you're retarded if you can tolerate the American one but not the Japanese one.</br>  <br>Only thirteen eps, so not much and the most of it will be her wearing a full suit of armor.</br>  <br>Right now, Overlord. Maybe because i read Gate and did not Overlord LNs.<br><br>Gate i am looking forward to few moments being animated, but not very hype though enjoying it. Overlord for now is fresh, and unlike Gate does not gear gore.</br></br></br>  <br>And? Just because its fiction its based on reality, which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk<br><br>It's be like watching the Lord of the Rings and the halflings conquered the world from the shire, with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it</br></br></br>  <br>What if you are a butthurt ameri/k/unt?</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Melkor. Always bet on Melkor.</br></br>  <br>tojo plz leave</br>  <br>But thats not just gate. It goes decades ago, and passes through many stages.<br><br>From "anti-war" (in reality preparing children to fact that war is hell, but they`ll have to fight to survive even if their goverment is shit) Gundams, mecha in general, Night Raid, SnK, recently AirSoft to wake interest in guns and now Gate and reairing Grave of Fireflies in prime time.<br><br>Its all part of the plan. Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. War and nationalism propaganda was its core for long time, but there are other trends too - like recently attempts to fix the birth rates by propagating marriage and milfs or shows about work to make NEETs think work is actually fun and full of waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll keep the answer simple, Overlord.  <br>The one with Albedo.  Both shows suck anyway. </br>  GATE manga &gt; Overlord anime &gt; Overlord manga &gt; GATE anime<br><br> reading light novels <br>Hahaha oh wow.</br></br></br>  <br>The only one that sucks here is  your mom .</br>  <br> &gt;Overlord manga <br>Never knew it existed, huh.</br></br>  <br> overlord manga <br><br>Not really fair, since its only 5 chapters in, you should be comparing to the light novel</br></br></br>  <br> Reading period <br>You should be ashamed.</br></br>  The one that is not a rushed one cour with original ending. Also loving these new meme about faggots pretending overshit is good  <br>GATE all the way.</br>   Overlord <br> Protagonist is supposedly Lawful Evil <br> First thing he does is Chaotic Good </br></br>  <br>Just because it isn't called an army, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>He didn't care about the village, but felt indebted to help them because based Touch Me rubbing off on Sebas</br>  <br> Overlord or Gate? <br><br>Which one has the better art?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better female cast?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better mc?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has a better opening or closing?<br> Overlord <br><br>That wasn't difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Overlord, duh.<br>The only reason why people like the GATE anime is goth loli.</br></br>  <br>Foolish anon. He is extreme evil.<br>Every act of kindness towards humans is a carefully crafted deception.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/ says it's shit <br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Will ever the assburgers stop shiting threads?<br><br>Gate<br><br>I dont like edge lord MCs, and this is too much power fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br>Enjoy your SAO clone.</br></br>  <br> edge lord <br>Now there's that word again.</br></br>  <br><br>i will, thanks ;)</br></br>  Overlord<br>Got to give it some points for evil lich MC</br>  <br>Gate. I haven't saw the third episode of Overlord yet but nothing happen in the first two episode. Gate doesn't have pacing issue and it's really satisfying to see modern military not jobbing for once. Also it's 24 episodes instead of 12.</br>  <br>I'm with this guy. Too bad Overlord isn't two cours.</br>  Both are shit. Just watch Rokka no Yuusha  <br> not trusting the collective of /a/nons judgement <br> hownewru.jpg.tiff <br>GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation. Overlord is just a generic battle shonen with an edgy dumbass MC who gets the dick for doing nothing, not to mention it being an mmo shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the only reason you're acting like that is because you're actually nationalistic at heart and refuse to want to see other countries do it?</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch anyone of it.</br>  I've watched and read both.<br><br>Gate is about a middle aged guy trying to survive in the fantasy world.<br><br>Overlord is about a middle aged guy whose age stops mattering as the story goes on since it's the NPCs who run the story not him.</br></br></br></br>  Both dropped  <br>Worry not. He will become chaotic evil in no time.</br>  <br>look as a human Ainz was a good guy, but as time goes on the Extreme Evil that was his Lich will change his out look. he already doesn't care about human life</br>  <br> Gate <br> Source material <br> Not shit <br>It's a decent premise ruined by virtue of being little more than a vehicle for the author's fringe political views.</br></br></br></br>  <br>GATE because I'm not American</br>  <br>Nah you're just as right wing as he is, Amerifat.</br>  <br> I'm actually a pretty hard left by American standards. Not quite tumblr-SJW, but far enough. </br>  <br> implying you're not american <br> implying anyone is 'Murica's bitch. <br>Invading 3rd world shit places is all America can do, aside from humanitarians no one really gives a fuck about poor people being massacred. USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country.</br></br></br>  <br> USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country. <br>Because first world countries are, by definition, America and her allies. What country in their right mind would invade an ally?</br></br>  <br> China <br> Russia </br></br>  <br>overlord<br><br>are you 13?<br><br>overlord is edgy because the mc is an overdesigned skeleton?<br><br> first world countries </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are by definition Second World countries</br>  <br>Are second world countries, which are by definition the (former now) USSR and her allies.<br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm having a lot of fun with both.<br>Maybe GATE though because Overlord seems to be moving along at a glacial pace.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Gonna be first world before long. America's just lying to herself</br></br></br>  <br>You need to get out of that cold war mentality, brah.</br>  <br>The terms first, second and third world were created by the US during the cold war to describe the alliances.<br>They are not objective measurements of the development of a nation.</br></br>  <br>You're the one throwing around outdated terms like "first world."</br>  <br><br><br> letting someone dictate what is good and what is bad <br><br>What a bunch of retarded sheep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. </br>  Gate for action and watching military ass-rape roman armies, Overlord for being pretty interesting and wanting to see my childhood edgy online rpg fantasies come to realization.  <br>Overlord just got past the... know what? I'll make a list I guess<br><br>Overlord<br>Pros:<br>* I love the LN and like the manga<br>* Is not being censored as retardedly as GATE<br>* Is not about NIPPON STRONK<br>* Nice character designs, even if Albedo's armor bothers me<br>* Narberal Gamma (best girl)<br>Cons:<br>* The anime is being too slow by like 3 minutes each chapter. Or perhaps 3 minutes too short per chapter. It was late by 3 minutes, then 6, and now by 9. Makes me worried about ep4 being super rushed and skipping important stuff. This may or may not be valid depending on how it turns out. Maybe they will skip the intro and ED to compensate?<br><br>Not a lot of bad things, but it is stacking up on every episode. Let's see how bad it is by the end of ep4<br><br>GATE<br>Pros<br>* They improved Rori<br>* Just getting to the parts I love the most.<br>* Decent music so far. I hope for some sweet Ride of the Valkyries<br>* I liked Rerei's outfit more than the manga's<br><br>Cons<br>* Retarded censorship means they skipped the dragon attack on the elven village. We never got to see it eat elves and villagers, will probably not get to see most of the action scenes because of that<br>* Cute-ified characters. Even the fucking empeor got a facial lift-off and looks 10 years younger. Everyone looks 10 years younger- Not as bad as moeblobs, but dangerously close<br><br>Is really too soon to tell. Must wait for ep5 of each series, apparently</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are his views? I just saw it will probably have some anti-american propaganda, but that's rather common in anime.</br>  <br>Really? I like the OVERLOR LNs more than the GATE one. Unless you are thinking of the manga</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Food, alcohol, pipe-weed. Within a century of the end of Return of the King, the world will secretly be ruled from the Shire.</br></br>  <br>I liked ep3 tho, but it was still too slow.<br><br>They should have started like the manga did, with the battle at Carne, and then do a flashback explaining how they got there</br></br></br>  Gate.<br><br>Overlord really surprised me during the first two episodes and the idea is really cool. Problem is, it gets wasted as soon as the actions start.<br><br>I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil.<br>I wanted Momonga to start a fucking kingdom not<br><br> hurr durr let's be adventurers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Animation is also a big point. Gate &gt; Overlord on that</br>  <br> which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk <br>It's not. It's just pissed off right wing Amerifats like you who can't take it, and there's a lot.</br></br>  <br>Anime, Overlord<br>Manga wise, Gate<br>shield hero anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>Everybody is evil, I mean everyfriggin body</br>  <br>That reminds me of when someone asked "if you could be reborn in this very world right now, would you rather be reborn as a guy or a girl?" and i answered "it depends on location. Western first world country? girl. Give me easy mode on life for once. Anywhere else? guy, I dont wanna get shat on" and someone said that was retarded because women were suffering on India so why did I say life in wester 1st world countries was easy for women?<br><br> India <br> Western First World Country <br><br>Since fucking when?<br><br>China and Russia are 2nd world countries, by definition. Even if China is now the world's greatest economy, it is still a 2nd world country. Look up what 2nd world country actually means, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sebas-chan isnt</br>  <br>Im gonna assume you think "1st world" means "developed"<br><br>During the cold war, the americans and their allies thought the world was divided thus:<br><br>One side was america and its allies,<br>The other was russia and its allies<br><br>Thus, you had "two separate worlds" of politics and ideologies. 1st world, just means "america and its allies" and 2nd world just means "russia and its allies" but they were all considered modern and advanced countries to live in.<br><br>You are confusing politics with economics/sociology, and seem to think 1st world means "premium quality" or something like that. Its just a geographical and political division, that's all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is too much "how it worked in the game" sequence in Overlord for my taste.<br><br>On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. Or as anything.</br></br></br>  <br> war is hell </br>  <br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br>Gate is not manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Both are absolute shit.<br>But Gate &gt; Overlord.<br>MMO anime is always worst in any comparison.</br></br></br>  <br> glacial pace <br>Its about four episodes per volume, if I'm lead to believe. The first volume was heavily laden with setting shit up, getting you interested in the cast and the situation, and ended on a huge note of  lich overlord killing the fuck out of angels </br></br>  <br> GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation <br>It's not. It's just an excuse to pit /k/ against fantasy for shits and giggles and that's great. Being an idiot is alright, being pretentious as well is just obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> what if the sky is blue </br>  <br>Diplomacy &gt; all, no man left behind etc, just obnoxious nazi bullshit like that<br><br>they should just nuke those filthy savage slavers. For humanitarian reasons, you know</br></br></br>  <br> I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. <br>In the new world they are in, no one would get past the first damn floor. Even back in YGGDRASIL, 1500 players and NPCs raided Nazarick and were stopped dead at the 8th floor<br>  I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil. <br>Ainz plans to do that in the second volume, he starts working as an adventurer in an attempt to create a heroic reputation, then drop the charade and give all credit to his true identity, thus spreading the name Ainz Ooal Gown far and wide. He's not looking to be an evil tyrant, he just wants to try and find other players in the new world. Also the other countries aren't evil, they have yet to be shown that way, they have some evil people inside, usually nobles and such, but the countries themselves aren't evil</br></br></br></br>   The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game <br><br> however, the protagonist Momonga decides to not log out.

Or did you think I called gate an idiot? Come on, there's gotta be a limit to how dumb you can get.</br>  Which episode does Gate start showing the waifu's?  <br>Overlord, obviously.</br>  <br>I didnt think she was ruined. I know, shocking, right? someone has a different opnion than you!<br><br>Well, Im used to having different opinions on tastes, because tastes are like assholes. Everyone has one and thinks everyone ELSE's stinks but his.<br><br>That's why I never really go to war over "my tastes &gt; your tastes" comments.

Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. Meanwhile the B team working on Overlord can't decide on Albedo's proper proportions it threw me off. Also, it highlighted the bad thing about directly copying LN art.</br></br>  <br>All I know is that the MC is a fucking otaku which pretty much removes any credibility it could have had from the show.<br>You can't take it seriously if the MC is constantly surrounded by girls, is an otaku and still supposed to be some kind of soldier.

If you read tvtropes, I would say it was spikified to death.<br><br>Gore is 97% gone<br>Mature characters? 100% gone<br>Violence? 90% gone<br><br>The problem with that is not "hurr durr not enough blood" but that by hiding some scenes completely, they had to cut out large chunks that were actually relevant to the story.<br><br>Have you seen people on youtube and their "live reaction" videos? I honestly enjoy watching those, I think they're hilarious. All my friends are into GATE manga, so I cant expect them to surprised or anything. The youtubers... they all hate reading, so they have fresh reactions, and they are all confused as fuck over a lot of things, because they were never shown or explained in the anime<br><br>Arrow on the dragon's eye? their comment was "did that elf chick shoot out its eye?"<br><br>Rori? "Oh my god she's an apostle of a dark god! she's gonna be the villain of the series! she's just luring them into a false sense of security"<br><br>Its really fun to watch, but also a little sad. The anime is doing a very poor job of telling the story because its skipping too many bits or it in order to hide its most violent parts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate, we get to see stuff like Cocytus vs. the lizardman chiefs, I doubt we'll get to there.</br>  <br>No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing. They're falling behind at a constant pace, so they've obviously taken a big chunk out at some point.</br>  <br>We're basically in the last part of volume 1 now, the only thing left is papa Bones chokeslamming angels and we're done with vol 1, we're getting 3 volumes at this pace.</br>  <br> No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing <br>That was what volume one was made of, majorly though. The battle at the village was near the end of the volume, and didn't involve much beyond Ainz shit stomping the soldiers and angels.</br></br>  <br>Again, I said it wasn't just a glimpse. It was a whole animated part, the reason they included Cocytus vs the lizardmen was because they needed a cool scene for him to be in, and till then he didn't have any scenes in the LNs. The anime will cover till the end of volume 3, thus it will cover Shalltear vs Ainz.</br>  <br>Hey your call man.<br><br><br>I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. If you really wanted uncensored Gate then you also better want the US getting bitchslapped every which way. You can't have one without the other. Japan did this for your own good and your ungrateful ass is complaining.<br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>I agree with the other things but this is wrong. Unless you're talking about character design, which I could give fuck all about. 18 year olds looked like 30s in Space Battleship Yamato, didn't stop me from enjoying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How did he even manage to pump strength as spooky wizard? Can players grind stats after hitting the cap in Yggdrasil?</br>  <br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>lmao.<br>Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>He's level 100 while they're like level 20, he can just punch them to death due to level difference.</br>  <br>Hes at the level cap, and even spell casters in YGGDRASIL, at level cap, had substantial strength, which translates even harder when put into the new world.</br>  <br> I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. <br>That is true, which is why I gave Gate a ++ on animation.<br><br>Its characters ARE better animated, but that is not the same as "better designs".<br><br>The character designs in GATE are just moeblob humans, while the character designs in Overlord are interesting and unique creatures, with a few jokes thrown in that most people didnt notice.<br><br>Aura and Mare being a trap and a reverse trap makes me smirk<br>Demiurge wearing a swagger-full powersuit in a medioeval world<br>Shalltear name is basically "I shall tear you apart" but people don't seem to notice.<br><br>Plus, they are all "evil guys" which you usually don't get to see as the protagonists of anything. It reminds me of playing Dungeon Keeper and thats a big plus on my book<br><br>So I really have to give Overlord the edge on character designs.<br><br>You want to say "oh but they are better ANIMATED in Gate"? I agree, but that's animation, not character designs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation. <br>Would have saved it even more if they animated soldier dialog with more kyaaaaa and naniiiiii comedic reactions. Instead we get happy soldier banter which none of our non-/k/ friends get and call it boring.</br></br>  <br>Because it breaks my suspension of disbelief too hard. And this comes from a fantasy novels author</br>  <br>Man if only character designs were animated well too.<br><br>I brought up Log Horizon by DEEN in another post which proves my point. It doesn't matter to me if the design in the adaptation has been taken artistic liberty with, all it matters to me is that it moves seamlessly.<br><br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime yet the animation might as well be stickmen in a flipbook. That's just how I roll.<br><br>I also didn't agree with dialog going to Overlord fwiw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains?<br>widen your worldview fatty</br></br>  <br>That sounds like a bullshit excuse to me anon.</br>  I feel like the two of them are completely different in themes but share a common design with the "Fantasy world" thing.<br><br>But both of them are looking like solid contenders for AOTS so far. I'll enjoy both.</br></br>  <br>3<br><br>I am saying "I like Rori" and also "but my taste is mine and yours is yours, and im not going to argue about my preferences being better than yours or yours being better than mine, because there is no such thing as better when it comes to taste"<br><br>Hell, I enjoy classic music, and still havent gotten over a punk kid going into my hobby shop, buying a manga and asking me with a straight face "aren't you ashamed of listening to fag american music?" while I was playing some Mozart on the audio system.<br><br>He enjoyed rap<br><br>I like Rori. You dont like Rori? ask me if I care<br>But I can say "I like X" and also say "I dont care enough to argue over it" in the same post<br><br>Im not arguing about if X character is better or not, btw, im arguing that, indeed, i dont argue about "my tastes are better".<br><br>You like red soda? i like green soda. Am I gonna argue about which one is superior? no<br><br> Implying green soda isnt so much better <br><br>That was a joke, btw. Im explaining that because you dont seem very fast or very good at reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime<br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br> calling Overlord an SAO clone because there was kinda sort of a MMO setting in the first act and never again <br><br>god I hate this meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying it's not? Top tier aesthetics and character designs, all larger than life<br><br>The villains shtick you praise Overlord for, One Piece already did for 19 years.</br></br></br>  <br> another wall of text <br>hope you proofread it, because no one else will bother slugging through it</br></br>  <br> wall of text <br>Best be trolling.</br></br>  <br>One Piece... really? well, they're at least original, I'll give you that.<br><br>And about moving seamlessly... are you watching the RAWs? because I am, and they move fine. If you are watching it on Funimation, you should know that Funi fucked up the drame rate and Overlord looks like shit through them, and through the groups that ripped their eps from them.<br><br>Check out the episodes you saw. Do they say "Funimation" at the beginning? if so, go and watch the RAWs. They look so much better on that sense.<br><br>But the reason im giving the animation point to gate is because while watching both RAWs, I just think the 3D in overlord doesnot blend seamlessly enough with the traditional style.<br><br>The staff of Ainz Oal Gown bothers me a lot. It clearly stands out of place. The Death Knight blended in nicely, though, so maybe it was on purpose to make its power stand out? if that's the case, it was a decision I would have voted no against.<br><br>But seriously, see if the eps you watched have "funimation" at the beginning. Funi is fucking overlord, big time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hey<br><br>you<br><br>stop<br><br><br>it<br><br>every<br><br>word<br><br>doesn't need<br><br>its<br><br>own <br>line</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>All I see is "I have no arguments so now I will fling shit and hope you give up and go away"</br></br></br>  <br>You still watch Pokemon, do you?</br>  <br>Idiot confusing evil alignments with Chaotic Stupid. Evil characters are not suddenly barred from committing acts that aren't genocide.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>You did say Overlord had interesting and unique creatures which is the point of One Piece character designs. And they're also original as fuck even if you don't like it.<br><br>I do watch both RAW and Funimation. I'd still give animation to Gate.<br><br>Now, what's the reason you give dialog to Overlord as well? I didn't think it was any different to most light novels out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, apparently we are getting up to volume 4 and those things happen from volume 5 of the light novel and onward.Maybe a 2nd season?<br><br>In b4<br> madhouse <br> 2nd season <br>jokes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see you fixed your enter key.</br>  <br>they already did</br>  One is about Papa Bones<br><br>The other isn't</br></br>  <br>Why not both? <br>It's not like your time is valuable anyway.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. <br><br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br> Gate is not manga adaptation. <br><br>Because gate IS an adaptation, and your post made it look like you did not know the LN or the manga already exist.<br><br>Someone else said "Gate failed as an adaptation"<br>You said "Gate is not an adaptation"<br><br>It comes from either the LN or the manga (I would say the LN) but either way, its an adaptation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for your own good <br>Im Chilean, I dont give a fuck if USA gets bitchslapped.

Gate is not a manga adaptation. It's a light novel adaptation.<br><br>It was me telling people to stop expecting things out of the manga to be in the anime, it ain't happening.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They improved Rori <br> Rori has cat ears <br> improved </br></br></br>  <br>Its explained in the LN that he's at level cap and he couldnt keep pumping int or spellcasting any higher, so he raised str with all his unused bonus points. <br><br>So yes, hes incredibly strong</br></br></br>  <br>They'll show a brown elf taking an adventurer clubbing.</br>  <br> you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains? <br>Oh I believe all of that<br><br>PS: Your shitty grammar fucked your argument. Read it over and over until you spot the problem</br></br></br></br>  <br>All skills get a couple of levels on levelup, so even a pure STR warrior will have somewhat good stack of INT and such. Rest of the power comes from the armor and the weapons that are summons and even take slice of their power from INT.</br>  <br>You clearly don't know what "wall of text" means.</br>  <br>Its all trash, but at least Overlord is mildly enjoyable</br>  <br>You are exaggerating and using hyperbole. Does that mean you ran out of real arguments?</br>   Overlord <br> GATE <br> Monster Musu me <br><br>You can't fool me, Japan<br>Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> widen your worldview fatty <br>this must have struck a chord</br></br>  <br> Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish <br>Just accept it anon, the grass is a lot greener on this side</br></br>  <br>Your loss nigga. <br><br>Goddamn I want to fuck an elf.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at that and tell me she isn't asking for it</br>  <br>I also gave the animation to GATE. Did you pay attention? are you arguing because somehow you thought I gave animation to Overlord?<br><br>I gave designs to overlord, and animation to Gate<br><br>I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs.<br><br>I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing<br><br>You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. May as well try ti defend the dialogue in 50 Shades of Grey, Holy Cow!<br><br>Seriously, there's puns and subtle jokes in overlord, which you may have missed, while there's lines so retarded in gate, that thinking about them may lower your IQ by 10 points or so<br><br>I smiled at tje otaku references, but a reference is not wit, its just pandering to the masses and having them go "oh he said waifu lololololol"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rori has cat ears <br><br>Those are ribbons</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you like grass you cowfucker.</br>  <br>Ribbons that simulate catears.</br>    <br>Your loss man, cows are good.</br>  <br>I own both novel series, and like them both.<br>But I have to say Gate is a lot more entertaining in the long run, Overlord kinda lost its steam after the "lol kill all these adventurers aren't I edgy :DDDD" volume 7.<br>Gate kinda lost its steam with the Gaidens, but the last volume (not counting Gaiden +) gives us hope that season 2 will be a good read.<br><br>Anime? I can't say, I think Gate has a better start, but Overlord hasn't even gotten to the good shit yet. I'll decide once the season is over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, alright. Your grammar just made it impossible to understand that out of your post, though.<br><br>By the way<br>  I said what I meant I said <br>makes no fucking sense either.<br><br>I'm not a grammar nazi, but at some point, you have to draw a line. When your post is impossible to understand, you clearly crossed that line. May as well have written "I climb up down to the same floor" because that doesn't has a lick of sense either</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*shrug*</br>  <br>I don't get why people get so worked up about that line.

There's a time to keep your head in the cloud and a time to wake up.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mad that you fucked yourself, and yet too ameriretard to spot where it happened?<br><br>Realy, until you point out where it happened, I can't take you seriously anymore because if your words make no sense, how could I possibly take you seriously?</br></br></br>  <br> I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs. <br>You fucking liar.<br><br> I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing <br>No, I think it just pissed you off.<br><br>That line makes sense in context since Japan only considered 3 countries to attack them which is Russia, China, and USA. Unless black people are somehow popular now in Russian and Chinese SF (not saying they're not everywhere, just that these countries aren't US level of heterogeneity) it's an acceptable if not racist conclusion.<br> You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. <br>I can?

Just stop, certain nuances will never get picked up with Bing and GT. Just wait until someone picks it up.<br> Im Chilean <br>So why are you mad over just that one line?<br> retarded analogy <br>If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China.<br>They didn't expect the US and immediately stopped fighting when they realized they killed an ally.<br>The line was spur of the moment.<br>It was stupid, but it's not entirely unrealistic since people are racist.<br>How you equated that to 50 shades of unrealistic S&amp;M is beyond me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, unfortunately my collection is all physical. <br>I'm skimming through your file, and yeah, it seems completely out of order. <br><br>But I'm more amazed at how different it is... almost nothing stayed the same, the novel edition is pretty much a complete re-write. Other than the Flame Dragon encounter, everything else is completely different, might as well consider them separate books. <br><br>It's kinda fascinating to see the original, it's almost like reading a draft or storyboard of a manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reading the web novel version <br> completely different from the published novel version, manga, and light novel <br>No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked for the air force with TOP GUN</br>  <br> No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet. <br><br>It took me 5 seconds of search to find it. <br>Anon did you even try looking<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?%20%20page=sear<wbr>ch&amp;cats=2_13&amp;filter=0&amp;term=%E3%82%B<wbr>2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%20%E8%87%AA%E8%<wbr>A1%9B%E9%9A%8A%E5%BD%BC%E3%81%AE%E5<wbr>%9C%B0%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%80%81%E<wbr>6%96%AF%E3%81%8F%E6%88%A6%E3%81%88%<wbr>E3%82%8A</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine translations <br>whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit.<br><br><br> So why are you mad over just that one line? <br> Mad <br>Ive said multiple times that I am not. I think its hilarious<br><br><br> If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China. <br>You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry<br><br>And yes, the racism oozing out of it made me laugh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh sorry, "text" you say. Didn't realize you can't read moon at all.  <br>Shit or shit?</br>  <br>nothing like anything seen in the past for the first 3 episodes, nothing similar in it's concepts in the future.. why do faggots that know nothing about anime series exist in /a/</br>  <br>We are, some Japanese politicians are also considering changing the constitution to alter or remove Article 9 and allow Japan to start maintaining a standing army, or at the very least being able to help their allies (Korea, USA, etc.) in case of attack. Honestly I think they need to just throw it out all together, renouncing war may sound all fine and dandy, but once you don't have some big superpower backing you up it just makes you a target, and they're already violating both the letter and spirit of the article by maintaining the JSDF. So really what's the point of keeping it around anymore?</br>  <br>Granted Overlord has many conceptual similarities to SAO, but Gate?<br>Gate is completely nothing like SAO other than sharing the same animation studio doing the adaptation.</br></br>  <br>I want to squeeze those boobs really hard.</br>  <br>heh, yeah, i get that feeling a lot whenever I read a book in spanish and then find the original, too. It must be a lot heavier when you read the gate LN and then the WN. <br><br>My japanese is not good enough yet to read a whole book on it without checking shit with GT, but I get that feeling when reading stuff in french or english after reading it in spanish<br><br>Also, as a former owner of a bookstore/hobby shop, its nice seeing someone has physical copies.<br><br>I used to also have a photocopy machine, and I was just awed when someone came by and asked me for copies of a 300 pages book.<br><br>"Sir, each photocopy its 50 pesos a page. This book is 300 pages"<br>"So?"<br>"So, copying the book would be 15000 pesos. I sell this very book for 8700 pesos, wouldnt you prefer to own the original?"<br>"You are just trying to sell me something, just copy it, alright?"<br>"But its cheaper"<br>"Just copy it, im not gonna fall for it"<br><br>Its as if people was afraid of owning books or something<br><br>Man, I miss reading actual paper books</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aren't those scans of the novel? we are talking about text files</br>  <br> whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit. <br>It's because it's not quality. I ain't reading gibberish. Better to wait for quality translations than pure machine.<br><br> You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry <br>Expected and considered are two different things. They considered the US since Dirrell called them but didn't expect him to actually go through with it. Check it again, I didn't say anything contradictory.<br><br>Also if you really knew that why didn't you raise it up earlier?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its funnier to watch you self destruct<br><br>Is what I wish I would say but honestly I dont remember. I fucking love reading, I cant remember every line of every book ive read 15+ books ago<br><br>Yes, some people enjoy reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lel jokes on you i was trolling <br>Remind me again why you consider SAO-level dialogue is better than Gate's because of one line</br></br>  <br>You clearly lack reading comprehension. Bye</br>  <br>Is it bad that I watch GATE just so that I'd have a proper knowledge about it to be able to shitpost in the threads more effectively?</br>  <br><br>See, this is what happens when you're being an idiot. He'd already said he's mexican, there was no sense in pursuing it further.</br></br>  <br>There are stubborn people everywhere. <br><br>.... *reads 57* ... wait WHAT<br> <br>Tyuule doesn't die, and ends happily ever after with Furuta!?<br>WHY THE FUCK did he change her fate to be so tragic, what the hell!?<br/></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>That depends.<br>One of them is an SAO clone with the shittiest cast I've ever seen and the other one is pretty much a good adaptation that tackles modern political issues and also high fantasy stuff.<br>One is mature while the other one is something only 13-year-olds would enjoy.<br>You know which one is better.</br></br></br></br>  GATE is fun as a completely retarded trainwreck.<br>Overlord is actually pretty good and interesting. Papa bones is a good MC.</br>  watched the first 3 episodes, but I still don´t understand.<br>is he trapped inside a game? or is a human in a different world or what? shit was so boring my mind was just drifting trough the episodes.</br>  <br> tackles modern political issues <br> mature <br>Yeah, like whether to fuck the goth loli, catgirl or elf first thing after blowing up a dragon. Oh, or the dark elf. Shit that's deep.<br><br>It's fun but for fuck sake man get over yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think good is subjective here</br>  <br>He's "trapped" nowhere anon. He's in a skeleton body now in a new world.</br>  <br>The GMs and devs decided to mess with the only guy left over while the game was shutting down.<br>They changed his UI and took direct command of the NPCs he's interacting with to make interaction more convincing.</br></br>  <br>So far he's been pretty good. I like his transition from a normal human being to an actual spooky skeleton in body and mind.</br>  <br>Diplomacy is half the fun, why the hell would you complain about it?</br>  <br> it's harem <br> mc must be thinking of fucking them <br>MC doesn't think like that in the first season at all</br></br></br>  <br> Itami  <br> Ever thinking about fucking them <br><br>You clearly have not read the book have you.<br>The guy will run away from pussy at every chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another beta MC <br>DROPPED at least Papa Bones doesn't run from pussy<br> does he? </br></br></br>  <br>Itami is far from a beta. He just has his priorities straight....kinda.</br>  <br><br>His libido is very low, bearing non-existent, because he's a lich, so he ignores the two girls that want his dick.</br></br>  <br>are you completely fucking braindead? did it not cross your mind even one goddamn time that the post, and the question posed in the post it's a direct fucking reply to might somehow be related?</br>  <br> Granted Overlord has many conceptual similarities to SAO <br>Not really; it pretty much begins and ends with the "protag somehow gets trapped in a fantasy MMO" justification for the events of the show.</br></br>  <br><br>At least Itami has a valid reason, being a recent divorcee, it'd make sense if he wanted to not be engaged in any relationships, doesn't help that a lot of the bitches that want his dick are kinda crazy.</br></br>  <br>He's undead; his sex drive is virtually nonexistent.<br><br>Of course he could probably fix that with spells if he wanted to, but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Crazy? I don't know where you got that from.</br>  Actually haven't watched a single episode of GATE, yet. The manga is great.<br><br>Overlord is an excellent show, though.</br></br>  <br> posting the elf with literal delusions <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br>Finally, an actual primary in the thread.</br>  <br> what is sarcasm  <br><br>although I realize sarcasm is hard to convey through text.</br></br></br>  <br> Manga <br> Pirmary </br></br>  <br>it's primary as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>Somebody said that the webnovel doesn't exist anymore, so manga could be considered to be promoted as primary.</br>  <br>Didn't check GATE, Overlord is good so far.<br>Reminds me of both Log Horizon and HeXen.</br></br>  <br>The manga is an adaptation of the novel, not the webnovel.</br>  <br>His character is Lawful Evil, but the player who took over himself is Good-aligned<br>So yeah, he's playing out of his role, but there's no distinction between player and character in his case anymore</br></br>  <br> Lawful Evil <br> Ainz <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>man that whole elf arc was so fucking shitty</br>  <br>Albedo has 2 world class items. Shalltear got fucked by one. Do the math.</br>  <br>eh, ending wasn't too bad. But everything else was a drag.</br>  <br>Shalltear, although maybe Albedo would catch on faster if she gets more fighting experience.</br>  <br>yes it was<br> yous gots to shoot the dragons to go un-nuts <br>well, after that it was mostly fine but that crap just dragged on and on and on</br></br></br>  <br>I think un-nuts is my new favorite word today.</br>  <br>Chaotic evil is not "more evil" than lawful evil if that's what you're trying to imply.<br>"Extreme" is too relative a term anyways.<br>To be honest we don't know how far he sways towards lawful or chaotic. I'd say it's still more lawful. <br>What kind of fucking classes are those anyways? Wouldn't "Necromancer" and "Ruler of Death" be the same fucking thing?<br>Fucking japs and their DnD bastardizations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He is, he establishes guidelines by which nazerick functions.<br><br>a Chaotic Evil character would just randomly be killing people</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu is shit m8</br>  <br>outputbuffer.maxsize = 2;</br>  <br>in the case of this game, they would add different stats and abilities.</br>  <br>GATE is worse, but both are pretty bad to be honest. <br>If I had to say, AOTS would be either Classroom Crisis or NNB, but all the short anime this season are better to be honest.</br></br>  <br> doesn't exist anymore <br>It doesn't.

The characters in Overlord is boring as fuck.</br>  <br> A-1 or Madhouse <br>You seriously need to ask this question?<br><br>Also if consider source then they're equal, because I'm a gunfag so Gate fit me well, but Overlord is fine either because there's no nippon tronk propaganda involved</br></br></br></br>  <br>That loss of libido is unfortunate for him though.

Anime characters exhibit strong ties to shinto buddhism and character development leans to strong males reproducing with ideal japanese girls by willpower - that is willpower that can translate to nationalism and bravery on the battlefield.</br></br></br>  <br>Singapoor here. I still fwap till I glop every single day.</br>  <br> strong males reproducing with ideal japanese girls by willpower <br><br>That would imply that Fate Gay Night isn't gay, and doesn't have an MC that's retarded and pussy faggot maximus. You lie.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Last time they went to war they committed some of the worst war crimes and atrocities known to man. I don't think the world will be forgetting any time soon.</br></br>  <br>Still exhibits the willpower of the strong japanese male in all his traditional japanese spirit.<br><br>As a bonus to being a noble male you are surrounded by hot pussy.</br></br></br>  <br>Nanking , never forgot!

Thank u, amuriburgers for shaving asia!</br>  <br>World class items are all incredibly unique from one another.<br><br>Getting fucked by a world class item that hypnotizes and controls someone is very different from a world class item that makes the user super strong or grants more endurance.<br><br>Although we only have a vague understanding of what one of Albedo's WCI does and it seems to be an AOE destruction, the other one is most likely tied to her tank status granting endurance (probably).<br><br>We won't know until we see it, but I think Shalltear can give Albedo a run for her money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like how loving and devoted they are to him.<br><br>In a world where skeletons are not to be trusted, it must be nice to know his closest guardians will sacrifice themselves at a drop of a hat just to protect him.</br></br></br>  <br>log hog was great<br>hope it gets a second season someday</br></br>  <br>Probably for the best that it ended where it did. I can't see anyone doing the second season any justice.</br>  <br> implying anyone in politics cares <br>Everyone committed atrocities during the war ( and honestly the Russians and Germans are still way worse in that regard than the Japs). What matters now is that China is getting stronger every day and the US is getting weaker, it's more important for our national interests that Japan be a strong military power than some moral high ground or caution due to past actions. Besides WW2 was over 70 years ago, most of the people that orchestrated and participated in it are dead, time to let it go.</br></br>  <br>Agree with this</br>  Both are generic, OverLord is the more fun one to watch though.  Overlord because it's not garbage.  You used wrong picture OP.  <br>GATE.</br>  <br>It wouldn't end.<br><br>Both have regen and crazy stamina.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>The only people who care about japanese war crimes are the chinese and koreans who constantly harp on about it as a propoganda tool so that the public keeps itself ramped up and hateful.<br><br>And US guppies, but who gives a fuck about those guys.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Left, every time.

Women aren't even supposed to go bald but she's so old she probably went senile and forgot.</br>  <br><br> Everyone committed atrocities during the war  <br><br>Maybe, maybe not. Even if they did, not to the extent of what the Japanese did. Unit 731, Nanking, pretty much every POW camp (If you'd even call it that) owned by the Japanese. Can't think of many countries that ran around cutting the dicks off people and shoving them in the mouth of the corpses. <br><br>Not to mention, there's still Japanese politicians who deny any of these things occurred and try to shut down Japanese museums that highlight the atrocities. You don't "let it go". You remember it so it doesn't happen again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about Overlord VS GATE?<br><br>Magic VS Science?</br></br>  <br>Quick battle? Overlord<br>Battle of attrition? GATE</br></br>  <br>not if you can nuke all of ANUS HILL with 1 spell</br>  I still don't know why people claim Shalltear is a loli when she looks at least high-school age.  Both shows have 10/10 OP and EDs  <br>Overlord magic beats pretty much all the science we have or the magic that the GATE has.<br><br>This would be one of those incidents that end with nuclear bombing.<br><br>Of course, that's considering both sides going all out. In reality Ainz would come off as a powerful soldier and worm his way up the command chain until he's sitting beside ol' Abe personally revising the trade agreement that gives him full control of the GATE and all resources to be transported between them.<br><br>And Narberal is in the background being a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he wanted to darken the setting even more?<br><br>Some men just want to watch the world burn.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It will repeat, you can't change that, it is unlikely to be the japanese next time though.</br></br>  <br>Gatelord</br>  <br><br>there is a Vex Animu?<br><br>Cute Hobgoblins doing cute Hobgoblin things?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br> /a/core <br>Is their some written book or do you decide for the entire group?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd watch an anime about cute robots trying to rewrite the timestream.</br>  <br> Maybe, maybe not <br>The fuck is that suppose to mean? Every single major participant in World War 2 committed atrocities against their enemies, it's a documented fact. Did the Germans and Japanese commit more? Most certainly yes, that doesn't make everyone elses crimes less heinous.<br><br>Anyway, the point is, it doesn't matter what crimes they committed in the past, no one with any kind of power gives a shit, because in the end it's better for us if they're a strong regional power. Even if for some unfathomable reason Japan decided to go ape shit again and start committing butchery on a massive scale, the US wouldn't give a damn because we typically don't give a shit what our allies do as long as it can't be traced back to us.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot one.<br><br>Which one shows gore/violence?<br> Overlord <br><br>I only say that because Gate is censored as fuck comparatively to the manga. Fuck A-1 studios and their moe shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've come to post twintails and discuss travel plans.<br><br>Updated a new part on the site.<br><br>Also, fuck american ruled spellchecks. Why the hell would you introduce exceptions to doubling up consonants when applying different tenses to words that end with a vowel followed by a consonant? That just seems so pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aika a shit.</br>  <br>  I've come to post twintails and discuss travel plans. <br>And I'm all outta travel plans.<br>Thanks, doc.</br></br></br>  Almost 12'000 yen for a figure, pretty expensive. I wonder if there's going to be nendo of tail red.  Any expectations/speculations for the next volume?  <br> Souji with no twintail filter in his brain <br> Finally takes interest in girls <br> It's not Aika <br><br>Delicious Aika suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  S2 anytime now.  <br>I wish, dear anon, i really do.<br><br>  "Fight me Mitsuka Souji.

And maybe Tyrano Guildy turning into a little girl cause he's as big of a /u/fag as one can get.</br></br></br></br>   Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut <br> Finally one of Ayumu's work escaped from IMS hell <br> It's the IS clone <br><br>Will probably watch because of the character and mechsuit designs but will stay salty thinking that it's twintails that deserved better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally impossible</br>  <br>Kinda want to read everything in order, so not much I can say</br>  <br>I wonder if we ask politely, yen press or someone else will release the novels.</br>  T W I N T A I L S<br>W<br>I<br>N<br>T<br>A<br>I<br>L<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yen press would first of all butcher it and then finish it in the year 2050</br>  <br>Their translation of first no game no life book looks fine to me, but i haven't read anything else from them. Are they that bad?</br>  <br>Already happened though . It's just that the girl in question used to be a male elemarian.</br>  <br>Too bad it was not dandelion.</br>  <br> souji likes phoenix <br><br>Nigger what? He couldn't take his head off of Aika's lips.</br></br></br>  <br>I was just thinking of shenanigans that could happen while souji haven't regained his twintail affinity. Well with the assumption that he will act like the cool bishounen he is described to be without the twintail-loving-idiot quirk.</br>  <br>Would Aika's childhood affinity be enough for Souji?</br>  <br>He praises her legs but can't say I remember anything in particular about lips. Souji is tsundere as hell towards phoenix and there's bits of dialogue on his part that demonstrate his conscious interest in yuno as a girl. Their first meeting is hilarious as hell when you know how their relationship develops.</br>  <br> praises a guildies legs <br> when he has Aika <br><br>Come on, you dumbfuck densetard, there's a girl that would do anything for you, get your shit together Souji</br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant Aika's legs. He praised them twice in vol 4.</br>  <br>Well, good stuff then. But after the kiss with Isuna wasn't it that he could not stop thinking about aika's lips and stuff?</br>  S2 when?

Twirl's breasts even lose their effect on him by vol 6 and Aika actually disses her sought after cowtits to annoy her. The progression is so steady and obvious that you have to wonder why nobody thought it could be something serious until it was almost too late.</br>  this is how twintail fags actually live  <br>Literally perfect</br>  Best Meido Edition.  <br> Best Meido Edition. <br> post worst Maid <br>the least you could do is get things right and post our Outer God maid, or Robot Sniper Maid, instead of the retarded battle mage</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the Adventures of Momo and Narbel, hopefully with lots of Fanart</br>  The only thing that makes me upset about this last episode is that they didn't include the scene where Enri punches the knight that's attacking her in the fucking helmet.<br><br>The scene would be no more than 5 seconds and it sets up Enri's character way better than what they did.</br></br>  <br>just like how her boytoy has the talent to use any magic item, she obviously got Tactical Genius™ if how fast she got levels in general and commander are anything to go by.</br>  Papa Heinz Ketchup makes a Pleiades Event.<br>Meido Fightan round robin just bare knuckles wearing lingerie chosen by Heinz sama, no offensive spells just buffs.<br>Winner gets complimented and becomes Momongas new companion, Narbel needs to win to maintain companion status. <br><br>Who'll be the wiener?<br> <br> inb4 this becomes a doujin </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no contest Solution(Shoggoth/Ubbo-Sathla) is immune to melee combat</br>  <br><br>if one ignores Solution then Lupusregina Beta or Yuri Alpha would win as both are spec'd melee to Narbel's mage</br></br>  I want to live inside Solution.  So, any moonrune fags want to spoil volumes 6-9?  <br><br> albedo lusts for dick <br> demiurge misinterprets bones and vice versa <br> shellchair chairs <br> people die <br> some other people don't <br> war <br> magic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm concerned with how far they plan to get within the 13 episodes of the TV show. The OP shows off a bit of the climactic battles of both Volume 3 and 4, however 13 episodes isn't really enough to do more than 2 volumes if they want to do the books justice. The problem is that book 3 is when the series starts to get really interesting. Thoughts, /a/nons?  <br>3, nothing makes sense otherwise. Author writes every 3rd novel as climax for reason.</br>  <br>4 episodes per volume with episode 13 being either the end of volume 3 or an epilogue? Seems kind of rushed.</br>  <br><br>It's going to end after the Shelltear fight, right when Bones decides to stomp the Lizards.</br></br>  <br>Welcome to the world of adaptations.</br>  <br>I also would say at the end of Volume 3.<br><br>I hope that we will also see the resurrection of Shalltear</br></br></br>  Stalker, are you here?<br>Can I request stitches for Death Knight and Gazef? Also, webm when Death Knight is rampaging too if possible.</br>  <br>You mean physical damage, I assume? how are you immune to melee combat? as long as you have joints, you can be grappled. As long as you have a body, you can be pushed down, pinned, trapped, or otherwise immobilized<br><br>Uhmm... I think slime maid would win. She is also immune to physical damage but you cant joint lock her or render her helpless through any of those means, I think?<br><br>Grapple/joint lock her and she will just "flow" or squish herself free, and since punches do no damage... yeah, slime maid wins</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And ironically, they are going at a snail's pace</br>  <br>And they still cut out small scenes. Lemegeton's Demon, the simple Fireballs, Albedo considering stealing chair's bath, Ainz's experiments with the perimeter guards, eight-legged spiderblade assassin's intro and orders, and few others I might have missed.</br>  <br>That's what I'm concerned about. I hope they don't cut anything too major.</br>  <br><br>This too .</br></br>  <br>yeah, just waking up, I totally meant physical damage. and Solution as much a slime as Albedo is still an Imp, or Ainz is still a skeleton mage.<br>Slime is just Solution's original race, I like to refer to her more advanced ones because Shoggoths and Ubbo-Sathla are way more badass than a simple slime.</br></br>  <br> eight-legged spiderblade assassin's intro and orders, <br>they still got ordered this ep, just not introduced</br></br>  <br>so far I like the pacing, sure it's slow, but the novel is slow at this part, and going faster would seem rushed</br>  <br>I dont think they will be animated because animating something with 8 legs with sort of coordination its hard as fuck</br>  <br>I meant their new orders from Ainz during the funeral.</br>  <br><br>Plus they are invisible, it definitely won't be animated.</br></br>  I thought Overlord was just a fotm LN, then I beheld Lord Momonga's greatness and I was converted.  <br>Solution is the slime mage.</br>  <br>Yeah, at least the script writer learned for Papa Bones learned from Mahouka (he was junior in the script team there with aniplex) what NOT to do.<br><br>Mainly keep all the internal monologue/narration intact, lest the intended result turning out to be unintentional comedy.<br><br>Onii-sama wasn't called The Answering Machine for nothing during the 9SC arc where he only replied "There is a way", no matter what the problem was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Op doesnt mean they will animate it all. They could end at vol 2. The anime was made for advertising the LN so just wetting the anime only viewers with op "trailers" is enough. And its working. Overlord LN has been ranking lately.</br>  <br>The thing about it is, there's something for everyone to enjoy unless you really don't like the story's base.<br><br>Like OP MCs? Present<br>Like MCs who aren't moralfags? Present.<br>Like MCs who are intelligent and rational and not prone to having bursts of hotheadedness? Got it.<br>Like MCs who have to fight sometimes with strategy? Got it.<br>Like MCs who are a bit naive but not enough to piss you off? Present.<br>What are you looking for? I bet I can spin it so Overlord has it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well 6+6+1 would be really scretching it. 4+4+4 would work better with 1 ep extra.</br>  <br>This?</br>  <br>I hate gary stu shit.<br>spin it so that it's not.<br>I'll be using that response to explain to friends why this is good.</br></br></br>  <br>And this?</br>  <br><br>for reference Solution is an mind wrecking abomination outside of her human form<br>http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Ubb<wbr>o-Sathla<br>http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Sho<wbr>ggoth</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Once she loses control of herself her facial features start to wander, at least from what I remember of her appearance in the 3rd volume.</br>  Before I continue reading. Lulu is going to die, right?  <br>just read it nerd. It'll be glorious.</br>  <br>[Spoiler]She lives<br>[Spoiler]and got laid[/spoiler][/spoiler]</br></br>  Still waiting on those volume 9 chapter 2 spoilers.<br><br>Still waiting.<br><br>Still waiting.</br></br></br></br>   mfw I realize the title Overlord probably comes from Ainz being the Overlord of   Death , like the Lizardmen called him.  Anyone know if that sentient orb of death has a larger role in the later books?  <br><br>Thanks.<br>Do you also happen made stitch for Touch Me too?</br></br></br>  <br>All hail Skeletor, Lord of Hamhams!<br> Anime pacing is shit. <br> Log Horizon had more happenings per episode. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit that entire war.</br></br>  <br>I-I can touch you anon?</br>  <br>Early levels are easy to grind out. The curve only gets steeper from here.</br>  post cute albedo  <br> edition <br>Please don't.</br></br>  <br>I think one of the major things that makes it not Gary Stu is the fact the mc realizes that all the guardians worship him and that he can literally do no wrong in their eyes. It seriously disturbs him being held up in such high regard, as well as the role he has a leader and fulfilling his obligation to everyone.<br><br>Not only that, but there is that corrossion of morality and humanity, where his innate lichness is overtaking his former human heart, where he starts scaling up the atrocities he commits, where he only does good acts because his sense of nostalgia of the good old days stirs.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure anon.</br>  <br> pacing is shit <br><br>I wish you ADD faggots that can't stand an anime that doesn't have a fight scene very week would stick to your garbage and leave the rest of us alone already</br></br></br>  <br>if it was stat simple in the New World 30+ wouldn't be legendary.<br>also she was a level 1 farmer(she's 16 in a medieval setting so she's probably been farming in excess of 7 years) until Ainz gave her the goblin horns, after which she gains 5 levels in a very show period of time</br></br>  <br>It's important for each instance of a general to have its own theme.</br>  <br>And that the MC keeps this false image by lies most of the time, while being huge paranoid and tries to plan his movements as meticuously as possible. And tries secures said worries with trusting his monster/demon servants to do their jobs and his own occasional meddling. If not, then just remove the witnesses.<br><br>All the while trying to act like Overlord and proper master (and later a father figure for real).</br></br></br>  Please tell me the next chapter of V5 won't focus on Climb. I'm really getting tired of this little shit. Literally anyone else would be more interesting, but I'd prefer more Ainz or the woman team.  <br>As someone with ADD is resent that. I have absolutely no issues following interesting Anime like Overlord.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure is about Sebas and his waifu</br>  <br>The rest of V5 and V6 will focus on Sebas and  Eight Fingers .</br>  I finally understood the whole chair thing. I don't know If I should laugh or feel sorry  <br>Well chapter cover image features Sebas so he will make his entry at least.</br>  <br>You should feel sorry for  Ainz. </br>  If you were Momonga and Albedo asked you to shit on her, would you?  <br>Yes I do feel sorry for him.</br>  <br>No, because I wouldn't have a digestive tract.</br>  How the strong is Touchme he just 1 hit 4 players in a sec that bullshit MMO right there  <br>Gagaran was fun at least.</br>  <br>no pvp level limits</br>  <br>You can still be able to smell, I would ask to sniff her asshole</br>  <br>Strongest player in the game.</br>  <br>They probably weren't very high level.<br><br>He already had the world tournament armor on so he was level capped and had some OP as fuck gear</br></br></br>  <br> general <br>That is the problem.</br></br>  <br>I love her, and most of the female team really.<br><br>A chuuni, a pair of twins, an old loli and a man in boob plate? Best adventurer team.<br><br>Also is it this novel or the next that Ivileye falls for Ainz?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>6th I believe but not sure.</br>  <br>Volume 6.</br>  <br>I wonder how she'd react if she knew Ainz was a lich.</br>  <br>Obviously that just makes it hotter.</br>  <br>She probably won't care.</br>  <br>Underwear crisis.</br>      <br>His build was so horribly overpowered the devs made it impossible to copy.</br>  <br>take a look at his signature skill.<br>World Break: Attacks target by slashing the space. This skill is superior to the 10th Rank Magic, "Reality Slash". <br>he's a warrior that could break reality with his sword harder than a 10 rank spell</br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me is the winner of World Championship tournament. You can guess the rest.</br>  So, did Ainz revive those two other lizard men?  <br>Apparently he does in the web novel, but they aren't important enough to be focused on again in the regular novels so far.<br><br>Also there are some major turns from the web novel so that doesn't mean they come back.</br></br></br>  It could happen to you!  <br>The enemy players were talking about leveling. Touch Me was all specced out in end-game gear. Once you put in item level, maximum level characters get really ahead of lower level and new max level players in most MMOs.</br>  Anyone here know which volume Ainz  resurrects Clementine?   <br>Here.<br><br>Is that another loli?</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have her body, the Theocracy does. They have the proper resources for resurrection so maybe she'll be back.</br>  <br>Correction, someone has her body, but it isn't Ainz.</br>  Some spoilers from Vol.9 Chapter 2 and Intermission came out. <br> In the WN, Ainz has about 300 Death knights. In the Vol. 9 LN, he brings out 500 Death Knights. </br>  <br>She seemed to be a lunatic so I wonder who would even bother bringing her back.</br>  <br>spooky!</br>  <br>Thanks Stalker!</br>  <br>We already know that. It came out a while ago.</br>  Questions for those who can read moon.<br> Was there anyone else who actually put up a fight besides Shalltear? <br> Just how strong is Sebas? </br></br>  You know, I just realized that, with how different the WN and the LN are, we will never get to see the maids using 20 Death Knights to move around tables, chairs, and pour down tea,now.<br><br>This makes me a little sad.<br><br>I heard someone said that the rulers from both the empire and the kingdom go to nazarick when papa bones tries to set up a small nation, right? do they get treated to tea at the time?<br><br>I just want to see a Death Knight wearing a maid apron and pouring tea, it's that so wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her former employer or anyone who would want information she she has. Ainz would want to question her as well I'm sure.</br>  <br><br>She's a  vampire that is a few hundred years old. She fought with the 13 heroes. </br></br>  <br>   vampire that is a few hundred years old <br>That's wonderful, thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>It will never get animated anyway. No need to feel bad, just use your imagination.</br></br>  <br> I just want to see a Death Knight wearing a maid apron and pouring tea. <br> Not want to see the Plediaes pouring the tea. </br></br>  <br>Now that we're getting into the political intrigue the show has some potential, but Momonga's vassals arguing about whose pussy got wetter was getting old.</br>  Just finished all seven original films, plus the sequel and bonus OVA. What are /a/'s thoughts on this series?  God tier visuals, soundtrack and atmosphere.  I still had to watch it twice to understand what happened.   <br>No anime has any business having a soundtrack this fucking amazing.</br>  Could Shiki beat Shiki?
