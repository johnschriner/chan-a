[ Service Club's first request, its biggest request, and its final request The grand finale is about to come  Welcome to Yahari thread, enjoy your stay        Just look at him, no need to kill   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210928   WA2 OP   Fuck off, brainfucked retard      When I look at him I see 8man. They're basically the same character minus the social standing.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210980  Now that's alpha.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210980   How many times must we do this   Where are the fucking subs      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O8X<wbr>fV8aPAyQ</wbr>  [ ]  waiting for subs     Just give up man, this is Commie's most ebin meme yet! They're going to delay the subs until god knows when or just not release it. Watch the raw, you'll figure most of it out anyway.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127211074  look at all that POWDER    edition       Why did we need a new thread? Since there is nothing to talk about other than "subs when?". Should have just waited till the subs were out and made a fresh thread then.    But subs are already out    They're waiting for CR subs since Commie staff apparently is infected with a serious case of anal flu for trying to copy HS   Who else thinks that Yukino isn't actually in love with 8man?  Brothers?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127211181  good for you     &gt; Trying to deny the obvious   You're fun anon      hai!    She still likes Hayama.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127211181  Nothing about that bitch is genuine.   Singles and CR will release before commie   Some die-hard NTR fags and Hayato worshipers, and a handful number of retards who're actually suffering some serious reading comprehension issue  And then you know they will keep spewing same bullshit even after the series is over so who cares?      No one   Reminder that she will never ara ara~ at your dick and put her yuis to good use.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127211181  Genuine photoshop?    Doubles and there's no subs till monday.    Yukino has no feelings for 8man Iroha's feelings are not genuine  Am I doing this right?       Why do you need subs anyway, when all the key moments of volume 11 that are on anime have been scanned and translated already?       Iroha's feelings are not genuine  Iroha is falling for 8man in the most genuine way possible    WHERE THE FUCK ARE SUBS WHAT THE FUCK    I don't. I saw stream.    https://d.maxfile.ro/xwkbmrkjkw.web<wbr>m  If she had actually given us an "ara ara" in the episode I'd be dead right now.  How can 8man pick anyone but Yui knowing he'll have this to look forward to in a few more years?    </wbr>    lurk more    What, you mean by always pretending that she just wants his help to snag the Cunt?    Are all Irohafags this new?   Good Irohasu, everyone!  What is 8man trying to show us, /a/?   Blank paper.    I wish Yuimom had Black Hair    An exploitable meme.   Yukino - Linkin Park, shoegaze Yui - pop, chart music Iroha - boybands Sensei - dadrock 8man - emo, punk Haruno - indie rock, experimental Komachi - EDM Orimoto - pop rock, pop punk Saki - classical, jazz Saika - trap Ebina - metal, goregrind Miura - j-pop              Do you really think 8man is going to base on who he's going to pick based on looks, especially on what they might look like in the future?  He wants something genuine.     Commies translation status    Yukino totally listens to classical stuff     Out before FFF's.     Commie still being lazy shits   Where are those subs from that "only for the desperate" guy?     Well fff just released episode 4. They could catch up, you never know    Their mom&amp;daughter interaction is so sweet it's poisonous to me.   Is sensei really a japanese teacher? All she does is sperg over 90s anime, I think I've seen/read her talk about actual japanese literature like twice. The worst thing is she has shit taste, liking scryed and all.   Yukino need to see a psychologist, not involved in romance   Then why is she always shoegazing?    your brothers are long dead   So  8man  Wants something "genuine" but doesn't really know what that is. He probably seeks a friendship where everyone can be themselves, no facades at all. They can't.  Yui  I honestly can't remember why she even started hanging out with Yuki and 8man in the first place. Apparently she likes 8man now?  Yukino  Wants to stop chasing after her sister and become her own thing. Sadly, she's now chasing after 8man and doesn't realize it. Her mother is a bitch. Her sister is a bigger bitch.  Hayama  A cunt. Wants to maintain the status quo because reasons.  Irohas  Wanted the Hayama D, but couldn't get it. Now she just wants senpai's attention, but won't admit it.  Haruno and her fujoshi friend  Want to maintain the status quo of their group at the cost of the feelings of their members.  Did I get it right? I can't remember shit from S1, so I'll start reading the novels this weekend. Apparently, they skipped a lot of stuff.                  Implying music taste has anything to do with personality.  I'm pretty sure 8man's taste is diverse, he has 5-6 years to diversify his taste    Subs when?   I bet 8man listens to idolshit    Haruno did nothing wrong. She's a good sister who wants Yukino to stop being copy-pastenon     &gt;Yui   I honestly can't remember why she even started hanging out with Yuki and 8man in the first place. Apparently she likes 8man now?  I think its something about a dog.        You got most of shit wrong.    Hayama one is wrong, cunt  And did Haruno have a fujoshi friend?      Treats everyone like shit   "She just wants to help!"  Well, she's not doing a good job.       Irohas  Easiest way to spot a secondary     Shit, that was supposed to be Miura, not Haruno.  Haruno a shit.       &gt;Treats everyone like shit  Apparently exposing Yukino's dependency problem is bad now.     Orimoto is totally the girl from those old iPod commercials     Treats everyone like shit  Nice fanon. She is hard on 8man and Yukino. That's it.      LN gets translated   Suddenly, anyone who didn't bother reading them is a filthy secondary and no anime-only discussion is allowed  No, fuck you.  You don't go to fucking Rokujouma or Mondaiji threads complaining about secondaries; you just discuss what you know.       Holy shit. Really? That was a fucking joke. It felt like a shitty filler episode.    fuck you man fuck I didn't save the edited one     ? Ellen Feis?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l2-<wbr>UuIEOcss</wbr>  [ ]       Blogshit    There is no love triangle, there is no love triangle.   Romance isn't part of the story, Yui has given up on it and Yukino doesn't love 8man.     FTFY     Opinion on anime   blog  Guess this whole board is a blog now.      Of course the idiot who gets names wrong is the guy who actually falls for it when Haruno plays the villain.    ok   I knew this would happen. 8man didn't choose anyone in the end.  Also, Iroha isn't even in the episode.       "she's only PRETENDING to be a cunt, guys!"    Thank you     TLfag   I want to kill this cunt   IROHA OR DEATH  Are you?       Setsuna did everything wrong; she deserved it.  Yui hasn't done anything wrong!      you drunk?    Unlike Yukino Kazusa was an actual villain in her series.    IROHA AKBAAAAR     Wants to help her sister   Has to act like a bitch to do so   Nope, there's no other, more gentle way to do it!   Her sister fucking hates her guts now   "But guys, she's just trying to help!"  She should look for better ways or just don't bother at all.         Yes, that's what the author constantly points out. Are you retarded?     Setsuna did everything wrong; she deserved it   What did she do wrong?      I think my favorite was the brown haired girl from ww   Which volume/chapter have Yui moments?  I just want to read Yui moments and feel fuzzy inside.     I should go and watch that. I could probably download and finish all of it before subs come out.    I actually am    She manipulated her friends so she could get the D. Didn't you watch the last two episodes?  She knew everything that was going on but played innocent.        Volume 7    Apparently they share the same director   Anon subs pls  The world needs you now      She should look for better ways or just don't bother at all  Yeah, letting her spend the rest of her life as a spineless, parroting autist who can't even properly function in a theme park is less evil than hurting her precious feelings.     It's one of the few romance anime of the last years that are actually good.   what's the best romance anime of the past 5 years?    describing neuroses resulting from previous efforts at "helping"   stop trying to fix shit that isn't broken, Haruno. you're not any good at it.      He likes Yukino so that's a given.    Nisekoi.    I'm disappointed in my old self for thinking this series was something special.    Natsuyasumi   What are the chances Yui gets heart shaped pupils if 8man started putting moves on her?    describing neuroses resulting from previous efforts at "helping"  I don't even     Fireworks in Vol 4,5,. Alone time with Hikki in 8. Destinyland in 9. Aquarium/cookies in 11  All I can think of at the moment      Very bad shows in general, but I would say White Album 2 is really decent compared to others.    How about actually being constructive instead of just putting them down and making them feel like shit. That isn't helping them overcome their issues, that's just making them doubt what they have.  Even if she is just "pretending" to be an asshole, her way of "helping" them is still terrible. Sensei helps Hikki by giving him advice and setting him on the right path, whle also not completely coddling him and just doing everything for him. She helps the three grow through their issues. Haruno just walks up to them and goes "WOW LOOK AT THESE RETARDS CAN'T EVEN GENUINE LOL"      She wanted the D and saw that her friend is also wants the same D. So when there is chemistry between those two sparkle she quickly made a move to develop the relationship with the person she loved. And the person she loved agreed to it. I don't see anything wrong with that. Love is a competition ans usually wins the more brave one. That's how alfas get the girls while that omega normies who aren't blessed with 2D waifu are mopping, sulking and getting stuck in the friend zone. The only one who did everything wrong was MC who agreed to everything while loved another girl and cheated on his gf with her friend.    Was it wrong as you expected?  There are similiarities yeah but plot wise Oregairu is better than the mess WA2 became.   Never really got why people though Oregairu was groundbreaking; its a very well written series but it embraces tropes all the fucking time         WA2   Mess  I don't see any mess in this series. It's not that good, but I think is quite well done. Explain.      Fuck off    White Album 2.     omega normies  fuck off     You know it's true.    Okay, but not chitoge, fuck off pls    You can't name a single show that's better than Nisekoi faggot    But chitoge is best girl    no the white silhouettes with the colorful backgrounds    shitoge      All I can say is Touma looks way better than Yukino     speaking suspiciously like a 12 year old girl.  underage b&amp; nao      shittaste      chitoge   best girl   when Marika exists  Nope.       I disagree   who /skeleton/ here?   Literally any other show    Nisekoi is better than literally any other show, so checkmate    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O8X<wbr>fV8aPAyQ</wbr>  [ ]    That's fallacy    It's much worse than 虚無戦史MIROKU    Nisekoi S2.     I ready my chips but there are still no subs, how is it?   Regardless of tropes, I liked it better when it was The 8man Show.   where are the subs where are my fucking subs    I suspect skiddicks read the retarded anon filing a formal complain post      I feel sorry for you and your shit taste, anons.     commie what the fuck  1. Chitoge 2. Yui 3. Haru 4. Tsugumi 5. Iroha 6. Saki 7. Haruno 8. Sensei 9. Everyone else Power Gap  9999. Yukino 10000. Onodera               What have you done    Swap 1 with Marika and im okay with this   Commie I will NEVER download your subs again.   It's interesting how watching Nisekoi correlates with shit taste    is there any Iroha in it?    this    but Yukino was at the bottom where she belongs   HS when?   Commie are Irohafags  Deliver the subs bastards.    You're looking in the wrong medium if you want good romance.  WA2 is arguably the best though, followed by Yahari.      I bet you watch Nisekoi    Anon, what the fuck    Yukino should swap place with Onodera.   Toradora is objectively the best romcom of recent times.  Orange Road is superior, though.      You see Yukinoshita, this is how it's going to be     Agreed.    CC becomes a bit of a mess since they get hit pretty hard with some common dorama and k-drama cliches.   Girl leaves for different country because muh love pains   Girl decides to come back to 'settle her feelings' despite everyone knowing the truth   Drama ensues as everything starts getting fucked again   Introducing 3 heroines was also pretty unnecessary and takes away from the main story. Coda was decent though - too bad CC wasn't as focused.           Toradora   Not Nisekoi       Iroha's dead     Yes I do. I love harems, which is why I watch nisekoi and oregairu    theres no romance in nisekoi     Eh? Take responsibility?   I don't I'm the one you should be asking.      Then you have shit taste. Congrats   This series wasn't really a harem until Iroha got introduced.  Can I sue commie for this?   thread is now about nisekoi, wa2 and whatnot   Amazing how waiting for memesubs can affect people.     Read the LNs.     the theme of the series is wanting something genuine so desperately   not even the series itself is genuine       Shall I dump?      Dump Pan-san     Two girls aren't a harem. You don't count sensei.      love triangles end up with someone losing   Big surprise huh?      I would like compensation for their unprofessional behavior.    It was us that truly lost though     forgetting Kawasomething-san  Read the LNs.     yeah, but I can't help it; Oregairu is so funny to me     Has Haruno ever lied?   Read the LNs.     ACTUALLY mentioning Kawasaki  Saying "Read the LNs" doesn't mean your posts aren't retarded as fuck.    Only girl I care for in this series is Komachi. Will she pass her exams? Will she find happiness?   No never.   Are FEEL :  A) Iroha-fags   B) Yui-fags   C) Yukino-fags   D)   BUY THE LN-fags        Read the LNs.    When was the last time a character in anime didn't pass her high-school exams, specially when her brother is at that school?    D obviously    Nigga the enemy of the series was Setsuna.    Well maybe Komachi needs some suffering too in her life    see   The MC in WA2 was a terrible, generic, self-insert harem MC, and he's completely not likeable to boot. He is flawless in all ways, doesn't have a single original thought in his head, but still manages to come off as an idiot and an asshole, and if he rang true to you at all then you have terrible taste. WA2 was bad because MC was shit, end of story.      If you don't think Saki wasn't part of 8man's harem before Iroha showed up then you need to  Read the LNs.      E) All of the Above  E of course     Hai!     She wasn't.    She just wasn't.        F) BUY THE VN COMING OUT SOON     The worst thing was that the MC started out interesting: being popular, competent, and pretty intelligent. Then that all gets tossed out the window and he turns into a generic indecisive faggot.  I'd say he's even worse than 8man, who went from an interesting character to a wish-fulfillment one.       Read   the   LNs.      Has the OST for the anime come out yet?    Denial.     You need to  Read the LNs  denialfag    I'm not the one in denial, anon You still haven't Read the LNs, have you     FEEL is not one person.    Ya, I agree with this. The best MC scene in that show was in either the first or second episode when setsuna comes to the council or committee or whatever and says she doesn't wanna be the girl, and MC lays down the law. At that point I was like "okay, I'm on board." But that was the last time he had a character.   I guess the part where he climbed out the window was okay too...      Without going full "read the LNs fucking secondary" (because seriously, I wish I had time to read 11 volumes), HOW is Saki part of the harem.  What did she do in the LNs that she didn't in the anime? Did she EVER show ANY signs of having ANY kind of interest in 8man?  No, don't give me your ultra funny "read the LNs" answer. Seriously, just what was so different with her character?  inb4 you answer "read the LNs" anyway because you're a smartass  Seriously, only Yaharifags are this rude. Not even JoJofags are this retarded over original material.          meant for        I wrote all these posts.       yfw CR releases in less than 10 hours  Commie BTFO.   I know they are delaying this on purpose, but I think it's gone on long enough. Just give it to us, please.   An "s" at the end of nouns signifies plural and so does the word "are", you fucking troglodyte.    You're just asking for it. Read the LN's     There's a lot more development for her in the LNs.  If you read it you would know. Don't talk like you know shit when you don't  Read the LNs.        After solving her family issue, she's all dere dere on cram school and haunted house.    yes     There's a lot more development for her in the LNs.   Examples?     She had en entire volume dedicated to her, the funny thing is that in it she  Read the LNs     Read the LNs.    why a drink?   Who would take losing the 8bowl the worst, Yui or Yukino?   HS subs are going up before Commie     She acts dere   People consider her part of 8man's "harem"   Even though there are people who DON'T believe Iroga is part of it  Why?       Barely anything happens with her. She has very little interaction with him to make her a real contender.  8man says he loves her jokingly one time and she gets all flustered        The waifufags    Yukino likes Hayama, for fucks sake.    Yea You can find them in the LN's     /a/ would lose either way    Iroha is clearly just a golddigger there for 8man's future editor money. That's why.    Yukino would double down on the snow queen act if she loses. Yui would just find some other guy that would probbly be a better match for her than 8man anyway.    Who even cares??  Yukino end is bad end. yukino is a psycho, strange girl.  Listen to how she parrots 8man word for word , on the phone with Haruno.  Listen to how she almost lets Yui railroad her -- and then, when 8man firmly objects, she suddenly follows suit.  She looks for someone to depend on for everything. They become responsible for her well-being. I bet even her current "personality" is really just a carbon copy of Haruno's.  TLDR: ERASE PSYCHO BITCH YUKINO.    YUI END BEST END.                   Fucking hilarious, man. My sides are in orbit. The read the LNs station. What's next? Posting it AGAIN? I love this Read the LNs meme!         Any subs would be nice at this point.

Read the LNs.    Yui would get really hurt and might be scarred for awhile  Yukino might an hero if he rejected her at this point      no habla espanol :(     filthy secondary     It's "no hablo" you fucking imbecile.    Why don't you stop whining and  read the LNs?     Read the LNs.     Don't. Please. I beg of you     People are saying Yukino but she's only been in the running for a short while now. Yui has been in it for 2 years and there has been a great effort made towards building up her suffering and ultimate heartbreak.  If you read her diary entry prologue it's clear that she's absolutely terrified of making the wrong decision and losing.      If Komachi doesn't pass. I'll personally pay a visit to Watari and, let's just say, theoretically, he'll be submerge in wet concrete until it become dry cement.     What if they're a grill?     Who the fuck cares about your stupid, dead language    People who defend Haruno's completely uneffective way of educating Yukino, just because her intentions are supposed to be good   People who think Saki acting dere means she likes 8man and not that being dere is part of her character   People who think Iroha acting dere means she's just like that, but doesn't really like 8man   People who will answer READ THE LNs to every single question ever made, even though it's a show from this season, finally making the sentence in question a fucking meme   People who want Komachi to suffer and not just be THE supporter of 8man   People who want this to go the WA2 way.   People who think every person with a different opinion or theory over the characters is a secondary   No discussion allowed; time for waifu battles and memes  I miss the S1 times.  I really miss them. Everything has gone so wrong since then.             I said I couldn't speak Spanish you jerk    spontaneously just found a reason to like Iroha     subs when  How much better would this show be if the characters would just sit down and actually talk to each other?   That's not even the point of his post you stupid fuck. He means you can't categorize FEEL only liking one girl, like you can't /a/    Then don't try.    Read the fucking LNs   I'm actually secondary too     One day you'll have to come to terms with the fact that not everyone is going to spoonfeed you stuff whilst browsing /a/, and no amount of calling it a "meme" will change that.    How the fuck do you solve a love triangle by just talking it out?   Rewatching S1 while reading the novel side by side, I can't make any sense of this scene, what is the truth?   As I let out a deep and heavy sigh, I looked around the window of the now deserted classroom. Yukinoshita had been standing there just a while ago.    It wasn’t even two metres between where Yukinoshita had been and the seats Yuigahama and I had been sitting on. Yet for some reason, it was hard to cross that looming distance, and I could sense an unseen line drawn there.    It would not be long before the two of us discovered what exactly stood between us – or rather, you could say, the truth.           Discussion is now spoonfeeding  Stop using buzzwords you don't understand.   Are you that drunk guy who thought someone was blogging? Stop it, dude.        I imagine thats what will be happening from now on    You've seen the light. You can't leave the ship now or ever. Irohasu~      HOLY SHIT IT'S A HAREM LIKE, SAKI WAS DERE THAT ONE TIME A SHIT TON OF TIME AGO IN A SIDE-STORY  IT'S A HAREM YOU FUCKING SECONDARY READ THE FUCKING LNs LIKE LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE            People thinking Yukino will win   People thinking it won't be open/friendship end   You should add that to the list       No one is doubting that Yui wouldn't be absolutely crushed by it. She might even find it hard to love again for awhile but she is far more stable than Yukino. She has friends and family, Yukino has 8man and Yui.   If Yui and 8man got together it would hurt her too much to become an outsider to some of the only human relationships she has, not to mention the heartbreak of losing her love to her best friend.  People are completely ignoring that this triangle might get bloody and hurtful.        maybe if someone would actually admit that they like someone else that would set something in action. Also this doesnt only apply to the love triangle    Your anger amuses me.    Reallistically speaking, even if someone "wins", I don't think neither that person nor 8man can handle being in a relationship.  Not to mention 8man would have to endure Haruno's bullshit all the time if she ever dated Yukino, even though Haruno said she'd be friendly and invite him a drink if he dated her sister.       Retards. Denise Milani is all natural     Read the LNs.     rude  read the light novels fgt     A love triangle can be a subset of a harem you fucking mongoloid. Learn some basic set theory.     an hero  If Yukino attempts to an hero off a building I will shoryuken her so she can fly back to her apartment while she fall off her apartment     Did someone say set theory?    99% of the show is the characters sitting down and talking.  The problem is that they prefer to make vague analogies, deep commentaries and hypothetical situations instead of actually saying what they feel, which is kind of unrealistic for teenagers, but this is a LN, so I guess no one really cares.      Read  the  LNs.   we're not going to spoonfeed you           Believe me I don't, I mispronounce everything in that shitty language intentionally    Spoonfeed me what? I didn't ask anything.  Did you just want to post your meme?      Who? The tits are fake for sure.     The point is that there is actual evidence to say Yui would take it the worst where as with Yukino it's all speculation based on how little we know of her problems.    Yui definitely listens to pop punk/girlpunk, just look at her phone. Top 40 girls don't usually go in for the pink skull and bones motif. I guarantee you Pink is her favorite artist, bar none.    Read the LNs.    But I need my spoonfeeding!    Yukino knew about the car accident that brought the 3 of them together.     It reminded me somewhat of House.   Genius(?) antihero with issues   Problem of the day   Antihero saves the day through means everyone else disapproves of   Antihero is proven right again and again            he still didn't read the LNs     やはり俺の青春ラブコメはまちがっている。 第11巻   Im going to spoonfeed you, google it and  Read the LN faggot   if you can read moonrunes      The subs. The path we all walk. Blind man who told the directions, left unpaid by sand. Oh sand, the sound of sand. Music that I became to love. Mirage before me, the goal behind me. Or it is the other way? Has that march changed us? And the wheel keeps turning. Crushes the old and rise the new.     he still didn't spoonfeed me the things I didn't ask for     Read the LNs.    Some model I fapped furiously in 2007. People claim her boobs are natural including herself and some industry guys, but whatever works for me    Spoonfeed me.    Those waiting for commie cares.    Well, are you the one dude that barges into the threads of every anime based on VNs, LNs or manga, refuses to read the source material and demands people fill you in on what happens in them?  Because those are pretty much the worst people on /a/.     Reminder subs have been out for a while now   http://animeflv.net/ver/yahari-ore-<wbr>no-seishun-love-comedy-wa-machigatt<wbr>eiru-zoku-13.html</wbr></wbr>       Saika - trap   this nigga      you mean this Spoonfeed ?    Spanish subs left some things vague and parts untranslated at all.    Okay, you are right on the fact that we have pretty concrete evidence that Yui would take horribly. We also know she tried to stop all romance in the club in order to not lose.  Yukino is very unstable and in love with him, speculation says that those types take shit the worst. We see how losing Hayama in elementary school fucked her for years, losing 8man now might shut her down for good.       Read the LNs.      http://animeflv.net/ver/yahari-ore<wbr>-no-seishun-love-comedy-wa-machigat<wbr>teiru-zoku-13.html</wbr></wbr>   spanish. worst subs ever. even though i know spanish, i preffer commie's      So you prefer Cuba?    Read the LNs.     Streaming   Spanish   Spanish Streaming       Worse people are the ones who think every person should read 11 volumes just to ask a question.  No, wait, there are worse people. Those who respond "read the LNs" to people who did actually read them, but wanted to ask about something they didn't understand. I've seen this happen in both Fate and JoJo threads, but people eventually reply because you know, discussion. You can't reply "no man, go read the manga again, I won't spoonfeed you Made in Heaven to you!".  That doesn't happen in Yahari threads.       Mouth of an ogre and a crow inside the mouth. Where subs, I asked. The crow with the human eyes tells words with the snake's tongue. Words like pebbles falling on ground. The tower before me. The tower of lies we all have to climb. However before the top, we meet the ground.     subs  Read the LNs.     8man sure know how to hide his power level. Will they still like 8man if they know how much of a Precurefag he is?   Read the LNs.   subs where   Where can I read Vol11 then faggot?    Ctrl + F   Read the LNs   30 ---- 315/48/83      That's the problem with general threads. Shit that's asked has been discussed among the regular circlejerk a billion times. Generals basically just make this place animesuki except without the convenience of post permanence.    That translation is horrible. JKAnime's is better, but also bad.   What the fuck do these Commie self-entitled weebs have to do better than producing subtitles for the last episode of my fucking addicting chinese cartoons?  This is not like Communism is supposed to work, work your asses of for the purpose of my enjoyment, you fucking proletarian scum or provide me a bottle of XO Rum already, how the fuck am I supposed to spend my time otherwise?    It's the hottest meme now, right next to "I want to kill this fucking cunt".  Can't wait to post it in every single thread of anime that has fan-translations! I bet Rokujouma threads will be full of LN-readers master race!      She turns into a dere mess at the cultural festival after 8man casually shouts "Love ya Kawasaki!"  Clings to him in the haunted house during the Kyoto trip.  Gets all embarrassed when she tries to explain why she thinks 8man would be a good candidate for StuCo prez at the twitter psy-op planning meeting  She even makes an offer to let him come play with Keika more when they meet at the community center. With how Saki feels about her siblings, that's practically her begging 8man to go out and buy a ring.           Yui is emotionally stable. Losing Hachiman would hurt her yes but eventually she can move on. I think Yui has grown a lot since the time she though Hachi and Yuki were on a date back in s1; she's fully aware of Yuki's feelings for him and yet she always tries to get Yuki to move forward (see all of Ep 11). At the end of the day, she has a stable life with her only real problem is not being with Hachiman  Yuki is an emotional blob at the moment; she has no support structure outside of Yui/Hachiman. Hachiman is probably the only guy in the series that we've seen that can support her (yes she needs to be independant but she doesnt have to revert back to S1 loner status. There's a happy medium here ). I think she'd take losing harshly  If Hachiman gets rejected by Yui and Yukino (hypothetical), he always has komachi. Even when he was a loner at the beginning of the series, he was still emotionally stable. Partly due to his sister that he dotes on         I agree. Yahari threads went to shit when they became a 24/7 thing. Things like Highschool DxD, DanMachi, Shin Maou, Spice &amp; Wolf, Blade Dance and Mondaiji-tachi all have translations, but you don't see people demanding everyone to read every volume just because they're available, simply because the threads aren't THAT common.  Actually, it's kind of weird how JoJo has 24/7 threads, too, but people answer everything anyway.  I want Yahari S1 threads back. This thread is buyfag thread-levels of MAD right now.         hottest meme right now  When has it not been the hottest meme?      he always has komachi  Taishi would like a word     Sorry Anon, he's gone.    And you're completely forgetting that one of the main plots of the story is Yukino learning to be her own person. To argue that she'd be unable to cope is basically saying that the character development she needs will never happen, and Oregairu is going to end with "Haruno was right".  Whichever girl wins, it won't be the end of the world for the other, and if you think otherwise maybe it's time to  read the LN      Saying "read the LN" should really be reserved for things that only happen in the LN. Questions pertaining to the adapted parts should be fine to discuss.   Yukino needs to lose hard in order for her to grow out of her dependency issues. Just like toujo aya.    Maybe things might get dramatic on Yui's side, but Yukino's current family drama is completely divorced from whatever feelings for 8man she might have. So is 8man's, whatever romance stuff is happenin in his head is still completely secondary to him just wanting to get closer to both of them and to reach a genuine friendship with them.  Even with Yui, her problem is actually not being honest enough with her feelings and trying to shut them away to not hurt the other two. It's still a little hard to say how specifically she'd react to 8man and Yukino admitting they like each other, whether she'll react super badly before deciding that she still wants to continue her relationship with them (if it doesn't hrut it's not genuine etc etc) or she'll try to shut away her feelings behind a smile before 8man and Yukino convince her to finally open up about her own feelings.  Or it'll all take place AFTER Yui's character arc has finished and she'll already be acepting of (and still obviously hurtby) the fact.        rated by LN readers    Nope, gotta read all dem 11 volumes, you filthy secondary!   Then this communist bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “Though thy crest be fat and greased, thou,” I said, “art sure not deceased, Ghastly smug and oldfag High Priest wandering from the Eightly shore— Tell me what thy translation is on the Eight’s near-Genuine shore!”  Quoth the High Priest “Subs no more.”        Honestly, I'm not seeing any romantic attraction from Yukino's side to 8man. I don't think 'losing' would do anything, unless you refer to 'losing' his friendship.   She really gives a poorfag vibe now   Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing　in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making. So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it.   8man: You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now.   Yukino: Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad.   Yui: I wouldn't be happy with it...   Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai... So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer?   Is the azw-epub version of v11 not available yet?            Yuu x Mika   Fujoshit chart     Anyone have webm for this scene?   But 8man's methods were actually wrong and literally the entire second season has been about making him realise that  Hell, even the first season didn't hide the fact that 8man's lifestyle was legitimately just making him more miserable, though since it all takes place from 8man's perspective it was still easy to fall into the "he's the protagonist so what he's doing must be right" mindset       Hachiman x Yuki   8man can barely stand Haruno and Yuki's mother. Yuki is too reserved to do or talk about anything. 8man doesn't know how to handle a relationship with a girl his age. They both spend their time reading.    Hachiman x Yui   8man can't deal with Yui's excessive energy and can't deal with her group of friends that include the kind of people he dislikes   Honestly. only Saika is a good option here, just because he doesn't seem to have any problems at all when talking to 8man, and 8man wants that trap D. He wants it BAD.          Read the  LNs.     Does Hachiman like Yukino or Yui as romantic partners at all?   zaimokuza is a fuckin underrated bro    The question is: Would he even realize if he loved someone?  He seems like the kind of guy who knows damn well the difference between a crush and love. This is the guy who confessed to a girl who keeps making fun of him and yelling PREACH IT every 5 seconds.       she'll try to shut away her feelings behind a smile before 8man and Yukino convince her to finally open up about her own feelings.  I can imagine her doing that and then after deciding to be genuine and letting it all out in front of them; feelings of anger, betrayal, sadness, frustration etc. in a massive shitstorm. I want her to let it out.     8man truly has the greatest taste.    Yukino has tons of obvious romantic flags since late volume 9, and her whole buildup with 8man has been one of those "these two will want to frick eventually" situations from book 1.  I mean, I'd rather see Yui win and I think people who are arguing Yukino should win because she's emotionally fragile are so invested in their waifu they're forgetting the whole point of a character-driven story, but if i were to use a metaphor to describe you all, their vision is merely horrible while you're completely blind.  Yukino, what are you doing posting on 4chan?        Because she's Genuine.    No, just grouping bias. Fujoshits only have that one ship, while everyone else's votes are split wildly across a vast number of ships.      If she's SO genuine, then why isn't 8man dating her?  Checkmate. Preach it, you filthy secondary.       If he's wrong Yukino should be able to counter his method when he's about to solve Iroha's request about being student council.    Because Orimoto has no feelings for 8man.     Yukino has tons of obvious romantic flags since late volume 9  Like? Because flags/tropes don't mean anything when the character doesn't show interest.    Who /Gahamama/ Here? Am I still allowed to call myself a Yuifag for liking her this much?   Think it this way: That's how Yui will look like in 20 years.     Asking for examples   In a Yahari thread  Here comes the memes!        Yukino  Frigid bitch and strict everything   Yui  Goddess incarnate and maximum comfy  Seeing into the future should change everyone to a Yuifag.           is that YuiMom? that's how Yui will look like too m8, glad she's my favorite    She's prettier than Yui and just as lively. Top tier family.  I'm really jelly, since I doubt we will see Isshikimama.     Instead of complaining for hours about people not spoonfeeding you, why don't you just  Read the LNs?      Everyone's mother will treat 8man correctly except Yukimom    I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO CAMILLA  JUST GIVE ME THE FUCKING SUBS     Because I love reading that meme over and over and over again.     implying Orimoto want 8's D since middle school   call people secondary when you dont even read the LNs  Read the LNs faggot      That's where Yukidad comes in, obviously.    Infirmary dere Cooking event dere Trying to give 8man her cookies but she was nervous And again, the "they'll fall for each other eventually" cues have been in the story from the beginning, and acting like you can't see them means you're either a troll or this is the first japanese harem/romcom you've ever been exposed to.   Absolutely, since she's a glimpse into Yui's future.  I bet you're one of the older guys onboard the Yui ship right? Nothing wrong with preferring the more mature and worldly version of best girl when you've hit that point in your life when you start needing that in a partner.              Do you know what you should also do over and over and over again?  Read the LNs.     The back to back hasn't ended yet?   Once the subs come out there will be one last mess of threads then Yahari anime generals will finally die   uhm   Faggots mad they lost    Of course he was (mostly) wrong, hence why it was interesting to see how he dealt with problems by his own twisted methods.  If he was able to solve all problems perfectly without repercussion, it wouldn't be very entertaining, no?      It must be their plan since beginning.    Unless mods go out of their way to make sure it ends when the anime ends, the circlejerk is going to keep going, making new excuses to keep it going along the way.    Fuck off    Are you the anon that never experienced love? Let me explain this shtick real quick You remember the Yukino's indecisive choice to not give 8man's the chocolate/cookie scene? Most people that look forward to a long and lasting relationship have a really bad nervous tendency; most people that look forward to a long and lasting relationship to begin with are usually people that has a really bad relationship history. source: me and countless sample from uni.  That said, during the scene; nervous + bad relationship history = she's interested in a relationship with him. This is sociology &amp; psychology 101. Even anon without a degree in psychology can catch up on this one  She blatantly has 2 options, to give or not to give; but the importance of said action depends on how 8man takes it. Under the circumstances that she give him the choco, his acceptance based on his personality are either:  1. Nervously accept ++ Implies he return her feelings 2. Accept + Friendzoned 3. Decline - Friendzoned  4. Nervously Decline -- Implies he doesn't return her feelings Out of these options, the odds of a positive outcome in Yukino's mind are 1/2. So why is she nervous when the odds are in favor of her? In her mind the odds are lower referring to 1/4, implying that she wants more than a friendship with him.                They're going to keep going until they stop reaching the bump limit.  Even then some retard will probably keep making them every time the thread gets archived, though      He's not wrong though. If he is then everyone was retarded to begin with, Ebina shouldn't say thanks to 8man about Tobe, the group wouldn't follow his method on the camp, and sensei wouldn't consider him as one of the winner when Yui (or Yukino? Kinda forget) when she asked who's on the lead, which to be fair she said everyone has their own catagory for winning. Yes he's miserable about his twisted method but that because normally people wouldn't too retarded to hurt them self for the sakes of others.     Nah it'll die. There aren't enough circlejerking namefags to keep it going forever.  Eventually we'll start 404ing before the bump limit but people will keep making threads to try and keep it going, then even that will be given up.  Ultimately we'll be down to just a thread every now and then, whenever something gets translated or when the next volume drops.          Only 11   Still complaining  I suggest you take a detour from Index and Horizon threads.      I'm still not seeing those scenes as romantic attraction.  The only thing you have going for you are the flags, but I'd like to think Watari is a better writer than that.       20 volumes of blatant hypocrisy.     Sensei said that he was better at solving the immediate problems, but often failed to take into account the long-term consequences of his actions. Which is exactly what the rest of this season has been trying to say as well.    A better writer than what? Having a character become romantically attracted to another character?    More like 25% of a good end.    Yukino probably won't show what you define as romantic attraction in this series. She's way to awkward and her shell is too think for her to do that any time soon. The only way she can show her attraction is through those flags.      Yes but that doesn't mean his method are "wrong" to begin with. It was more like quick solution than long term one.    Funny enough, those guys have read 40+ volumes and STILL answer stuff to people and discuss theories and scenes instead of repeating READ THE LNs.  What makes Yahari so damn different? It's just one other LN that got a fan-translation, big deal.      Isnt her whole character defined by having to read between the lines? Why are people surprised about this? Yui and Iroha are very open about their feelings but Yuki has never been open (I'd thought you'd understand) though progress has been made on this front    Opera is dead anon.  Let it go.      You came at the wrong time, buddy. Your whining only made them parrot this shit further.    Reminder that the (best english translation of) the club's motto is "teach a man to fish and he is fed for a lifetime"    If you read the LNs you would know    Producer: Yukino and Hachiman empathized their value as individuals whereas the emotions of love were a separate matter. Starting from episode 11, the themes of love relationships begin to intermingle.    I know  ;_;      People get tired of every chucklefuck walking into the thread and saying "explain to me X" for the 398457394785th time.     When has it been a good time?  I've been checking these threads since day 1 and they've always been like this, except that today you're EXTRA mad because Commie hasn't released the last episode yet.      You should have included this image with your post.    Commie trolling everyone.  hue    When murrikans asleep, usually.    Maybe if you didn't have threads all day long, every single day, then you wouldn't get tired of discussing the series.  Some people have time to read books, other don't, so they watch the adaptation. For most people, this is probably "the sequel to that one show you most probably watched two whole years ago" and can't remember shit, so they ask.  And honestly, when the same question is asked for the millionth time, then there's a simple method for that question to stop: Not replying.          not discussing something you like in a conversative way   being autistic enough to post the same thing in response to questions over 10 times - including opinions     http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05228</wbr>   You can use this valuable time to read the LNs instead of shitposting, but you choose to shitpost.    kek   Maybe people would not be this FUCKING EDGY when they just accept that their waifu is shit and kamakura is best girl. You fucks.   Calm down.   How can Yukino even be helped? Her entire life has been hardships. Being bullied, pressured by her mom, and tormented by her sister. Hayama was her friend for a while in gradeschool but then he just suddenly cut all ties and abandoned her, leaving her with no choice but to develop the ice queen mentality to fix it. That worked for a time but then the service club showed up and she regressed back to being dependent.  At this point if they all ignore her to solve her problems on her own then she becomes ice queen 2.0, basically her mother. If they swarm around her giving her love then she stays in her regressed state.  How do you break this cycle? The only way I can think of is to somehow create a situation where she is forced to adapt into something new in order to move forward.  The closest this series has gotten is when she tried to help Rumi, only problem though is that 8man was the one that came up with the idea of how to help her. If Yukino was able to use her past experiences to determine what would and wouldn't have helped her then it would have given her more insight in how to handle her own problems.  I mean potentially a heart to heart storytelling time within the service club could work. They all get together and explain their pasts, what troubled them, how they dealt with it, and what they learned. All 3 would be better off for it and honestly at that point they would have all achieved a genuine relationship like what 8man had always wanted.  Only problem though is at that point why would 8man seek romance? It would just seem like romance for the sake of romance. It serves no purpose in the series and would just be tacked on.               Fun fact: if you phrased your questions in a better way or was less reminicent of denialfags then you might have gotten a serious answer.  You instead chose to respond to every person who told you to read the LNs then get mad as fuck when everyone was laughing at you.     Hello reddit   So is anon delivering or we really have to wait for herkz the faggot   Maybe we could cure cancer and stop people in Africa from dying of hunger if people read the LNs.  Oh, wait.       Implying anybody replying with "read the LNs" has ever actually read the LNs   Implying more than 1% of the people on 4chan are actually interested in having a proper discussion      And we're delayed again    Late night / early morning threads in burgerland time are the best.     laugh   Acting mad as fuck is laughing  Holy shit, /v/ is the happiest board on this whole website, then.  Just admit it; most people here are mad as fuck because of Commie, which is weird, because having read the LNs, you shouldn't even need to watch the episode.        Read the LNs.    xythar a shit herkz a shit raising heart excelion a leech      The LN hasn't been translated faggot. What's left here are only EOPs    It's like savewiping your ass one last time anon, just to be sure the paper is all white.     Needing translations  These EOPs are the same guys who treat everyone as secondaries?     At this rate we'll get HorribleSubs before Commie.    Any time after Fate airs as well. Most of the shitposters leave to make 4 or 5 bait threads. Too bad it eventually devolves into waifu wars after the first couple threads die.   you missed the easiest one of them all, newfriend  implying /a/ likes anything   cmon son          Thanks for non-meme subs    Because they have read the source material beforehand     Just admit it; most people here are mad as fuck because of Commie, which is weird, because having read the LNs, you shouldn't even need to watch the episode.  Are you stupid? this thread is full of mad secondaries and you ask them about LN. Holy shit, use your brain and stop fucking complaining.      Kirino  Fuck off     He finds both attractive and I have no doubt that he could fall in love with any of them. But in terms of relationships, I think he wants someone he can call a friend before getting any kind of girlfriend.    I don't think you know what secondaries are anon   to all the yuifags:  there is some slight hints in both the anime and ln that she is kinda, how should I say,,, easy, you know,   the kinda girl that would not cheat on you, but you would never be really sure, you know  also does anybody now why commie is delaying the subs?        Obviously people who I dislike.    the same reason you do anything on the internet    There was never any hint for that ever    tfw I pretend to be angry so herkz further delays this shit anime  kek    He has to be fucking retarded if he doesn't even know that volume 11 hasn't even been fully translated.    Stay mad.    so you don't understand basic psychology, my friend...    He's the one who's been complaining about not being spoonfed for this entire thread. He is retarded.     basic psychology   ...  Enlighten us before slandering the good name of a pure maiden.     I know why there are no subs.    reading translations    calling other secondarys    Loving every laugh       Give me your adress.    You should know by now that riling up Yuifags is next to impossible, but have a best girl lap pillow for your efforts.      Aside from her calling herself unpure in her diary there isn't much.  I'm not sure what examples he's talking about though.      Perfecto.     He's the one who's been complaining about not being spoonfed for this entire thread. He is retarded.  Nigger.       implying  How's that imaginary world working for you guys?   This episode is based on volume 11, according to the author who tweeted it. Translations started just a few days ago. But nope, I'm damn retarded, need spoonfeding and don't lurk at all!         well go on. Entertain us    One of hachi's reflections was something like this:"I don't like a girl that is nice to me, I don't like nice girls; if a girl is nice to me, she is nice to everyone"   So it's going to be a movie.  We knew this months ago.  Will watch for Ueno.   This nigga knows what's up.  What's the studio again?       TOEI or Pierrot     People still will have the wrong expectations from it.    I've already seen people hoping for a movie original ending, and you can guess what sort of ending they expect.   They're just setting themselves up for disappointment.     Now that the dust has finally settled can we all agree Vanilla is objectively the best flavor?  Yeah   Yes.   If Aizu was around to see Bell two-shot lvl 5 floor boss, would they fuck right there in the crater?    Aiz is literally too autistic for sex. Having sex with Aiz would be like fucking a dead fish, she'd just lie there, completely emotionless. Which is gross.     No, she would just go to Level 49 and fight the Monster Rex there and reach Level 7.    That's my fetish   Only when you put Butter Olive Oil on it  Damn, they really ran out of budget, didn't they?   Which is fine because with their current power gap she'd probably crush Bell's cock with one hip thrust     Now that the dust has finally settled <br/>    But anon, don't you want to make her experience the joy of the D, slowly breaking through her autistic shell until she craves it so much that she forces you down instead and starts fucking you in ecstasy until she is filled up completely, and your balls drained empty?    http://imgur.com/a/9d5I0     she forces you down instead    Oh please.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say none of us want to get physically overpowered and raped by Aiz Wallenstein.        absolutely   Yes  This anime was good.

Why the fuck not?   Looking for Koreanbros!          Isnt that the same kid with the dog from before?       Chairman in South America spinoff when?               Motherfucker has changed. Not even blatant ecchi shit interests him anymore.          Kate bullies Meiko   clothes bully Meiko   food bullies Meiko  What doesn't bully Meiko?        koreanbro?   Meiko.     mari bullies meiko   andre bullies meiko   gakuto(?) bullies meiko  not sure for the last one         Nope. Meiko's Meikos are the biggest Meiko bullies in the entire manga.    That means he won't be able to enjoy the Wet t-shirt contest anymore?   Oooooooohhhh is the VC finally going to make her return and tame the beast known as Andre         Wow why does it look like the author wants Fat boy to end up with Meiko    Im sure hana in a two piece would have his desire going wild like it usually does when hes with her.   To see the boys &amp; USC sitting together &amp; eating lunch? That's some huge progress from the 1st arc. Is It going to be doomed once Chiyo discovers the truth about Hana &amp; Kiyoshi.        progress  I already saw hana kicking kiyoshi in one panel and wait till we see mari's dialogue translated. last time she was calling kiyoshi ungrateful trash, I wouldn't be sure on progress yet.        Andre's legs  H-how    Aaaaaand done.  Oh shit is she gonna be back? Please let her be back!  Some extra pages incoming       They are eating their food, uninvited.    Sorry, forgot the image    Shes not just kicking kiyoshi shes kicking them all out because they are eating their food.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286   filler    Extra page 1    excuse me for not knowing korean    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286   filler     I don't know korean, it's called 'looking at pictures and figuring out the context'.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286  Do you even know what filler is you fuck?    Look at maris reaction to kiyoshi eating their food.    just wait for based koreanbro   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127208286  What the fuck are you talking about nigga (btw, extra page 2)     it's happening     Thanks mister!    Mm... it's dangerous to fly a rotor in a place like this...        Finally, magazine cover. Now to wait for a koreanbro. (dat Hana)    Not just kiyoshi, in the previous page they are all chowing down.    Bro...! Sorry for asking, but what is the chapter title?      Koreanbro has arrived     Thank you!!     Shit, it shouldve been,   Mm... it's dangerous to fly a rotor in a place like...     this...    ...    I'm sorry, I'll be careful... so please may I have that back...    ......    There's something... that I can feel from this rotor...    However... what is it? I can't remember...    Wait a second... that... isn't that dangerous?    Mister- Please give it back now-    ...    A pair of underwear?                            V for victory, yes Hana.    New Manoeuver: Gensis     Hey you, sir!    What are you doing in such a state!?    Stay well, young...    Man!                   Why is this the best manga ever?    because of hana... because of hana anon.      I'd nearly forgotten.. But I am a warrior...    Even if I'm distressed, I cannot stand still. Even if whilst bearing pain, a man...    I'm sorry... I am a bit late, but...    Ought to strive towards the next battlefield!    I have returned after a complete revival!    Heh...!?   Bottle: Mayonaise                Because the fanservice is the plot and both are compelling.    anyone good with photoshop care to get rid of everything surrounding Hana? Its a great picture of her if not for the adverts.     Genesis, not Gensis. Mistakes everywhere today.     Heh~ehhh!    Are you alright!?    Vice-president! If you don't have to worry about that kind of mayona...    Um... I have returned after a complete...    What!? Where have you been, it's lunch already!    I... I apologise. Whilst returning...    Kiyoshi! Bring something to clean up with!!    Ah... yes                      Are they having strawberries with mayonaise? Mayonerries?      NICE CATCH-! Andrei! Return!!    Good- Aren't I nice! GOOD BOY!!    TN:  She's speaking in English.         Lisa looking so happy  It'll hurt to see Meiko take Andre away from her.     ... Since a while ago they've been showing us how perfectly their synchronisation is going...   Are they trying to lower our morale...    Toppling that over seems quite difficult...    An anti-Andrei countermeasure... ...    Ourselves shall lend a hand!    Guys!    We'd be grateful to have you all, who were the closest to Andrei, participate in our strategy meeting...    And... It seems I haven't had the chance to properly express my thanks to you all face-to-face for your cooperation     Uh...                    I can feel it. Old VIcePrez coming back in few chapters.   Pretty much the only thing thats actually been predictable. I mean it makes sense given the andre/meiko dynamic. Then again maybe it wont happen like we think it will.     &gt;Ourselves shall lend a hand!  Are you missing a speech bubble in the first two panels?      Thanks... It was thanks to you guys that the jailbreak succeeded... ...    And that we were able to see the school festival and the day of judgement...    I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart    Uh... No... Such a...    That being said... How did you decide to cooperate with us?    Well, it would be long to explain... but to put it simply...    It is because rather than the cram-school lifestyle governed by the school festival of light, your...    Side which is governed by the school festival of darkness is more enjoyable...                  W-what if Assman was actually on his way to the school grounds to re-inspire Meiko?   Hes on his way to south america given all his reactions to things that fly.    I think I'm missing a memearrow, but that should be it. Correct me if I'm wrong.     That's...    That's how it is...    On top of that... Those bastards weren't content with crushing our souls, and took out the recyclable garbage...    'Tis nigh unforgivable!    *cough*...    Then let us quickly eat while holding our strategy meeting!    This sandwich is delicious-!    Rubbeth a dub dubbeth, thank ye 4 the grubbeth    Of course, I made them    Um... We... have come with a plan in mind...    Sure! Let us hear of it                             Rubbeth a dub dubbeth, thank ye 4 the grubbeth  You glorious bastard      Andrei Capture Plan!    It's a plan where, when Andrei is caught unawares in a large snare, we stab him with spears!!    You... Do you plan to stab a friend to death using a spear? He's not mammoth    I cannot think you're in your right mind...    Huh? No, that's... the spears are... how should I say it, a figure of speech... kind of... for example, a round end...    You can't use tools in the jockey match! That's obvious, you retard!!    We also lack the time to set up the trap at the beginning... Do we not have other methods?                 are the boys going to grope Mari? I remember she agreed to that if they helped her in the jailbreak.     There aren't!? It's only the mammoth!?    Of... of course we have... mm-... "Andrei Sleepiness Plan", "Andrei Hypnosis Plan", "Andrei Freezing Plan"...     From only hearing the names, I can tell that we can't use those!    You guys aren't worthy to eat my lunch, eat the school lunches!    Eh eh...? No way...    That's right... For you lot who aren't of any use, even one homemade lunch is wasteful    Anyways... You guys, like get your stuff together...    Kiyoshi you too!    If you can't think up any plans, eat as you will over there!    There, get out!!                       Didnt kiyoshi say he wouldnt do that? Idk about the boys.     P... Please wait, actually we do have a plan that we've thought...    Up of, but...    ... Meiko... huh    Mm... Andrei's sole weakness is the vice-president    However... For a person to have changed this much... ...             ANDRE HAS TURNED INTO A DOG, HE'S STANDING LIKE ONE     If... it were the Andrei before he were to become Lisa's assistant    When shown a photo of the past vice president, he would for a few seconds... revert to his past self    Yeah... If that were to be true, if we were to bring some photos of Meiko to the jockey match...     That is not so... For before coming here we have tested this, but... The current Andrei did not show the slightest interest...    ... So in order to revert Andrei to his past self, Meiko...    thud...               TL     Grrr...    Meiko... I'll revert her... ...    I must object...           Oh jesus. Meiko comin back is going to fuck with risa.    Um... This...    Please take this, Andrei... san...   Grrrrr!!    Maiko-!!    Hweh~! It hurts~!!     Calm down Andrei!    Whack!    Hu... I must apologise... Andrei doesn't listen to anyone but for me you see...    I'll be sure to give him plenty of punishment so forgive him...    That... Something like that is not the vice-president that we know    To be bitten by Andrei and not to retaliate...    Mm... 'Twas shocking... However...                              After witnessing the events just now, I thought once more. We must without fail, succeed in the revival of the vice-president!    It is the F (Vice-President)    Of Revival!         Thanks based koreanbro    Hell yeah, Andrenomics investments will become profitable again.    Thank you koreanbro, you live forever in our hearts    thanks for translation     &gt;It is the F (Vice-President)      &gt;Of Revival!  Something something chilling elegy.  Thanks koreanbro.           Mari hasn't changed   she's the same boys hating cunt as always  What do you have to say now, Mari haters? Right, shut the fuck up and crawl back into your holes.        u know im kinda going to miss the current Vice prez once she revert back to her usual self    Full staff Anime   There we go, I knew I was missing something.    Much obliged for the work.   so we enter into Pig Arc?   I hope you realize what this means, right?  We will NEVER EVER get off of cavalry Namek.       50+ chapters of cavalry  This could be good or bad.     Its going to be great, we have meiko changing back, andrenomics possibly returning, more hana and kiyoshi interactions, chiyo probably finding out about said interactions, and somebodies incriminating photos/videos being released   When is the next KyioshixMari scene?  Their snake bath was the hottest thing in the manga.     Don't forget the lewdest miracle.    Wasn't that the hand holding scene?    Thank you based Koreanbro.    I disagree. Plenty of others were way hotter. That specific one suffered in that it was solely life saving fused into extreme fanservice. There was no desire like kate and maris scene or literally all of the hana ones.     the hottest thing in the manga.     I don't find lesbians hot      They just desperate hos my niggah.    He invested somewhere else already.     implying he's not playing the long game   implying he's not going to make out like a bandit on masochism's Wall Street when he has two queens battling to control him      Pretend it's a guy sucking on the nipple in that page, or Kiyoshi with a wig in the whole chapter.    He is no longer a broker, he became the stock.    Risa is investing in him, andres market crashed when meiko went moe.    It doesn't work that way anon    For me it could.     the hottest thing in the manga     Jesus christ that just ruins it all. Why do people do this..?    This guy gets it. Love+lust is the winning formula.    Care to explain why you don't like two hos going at each other like they eating ice cream, homie?    I want to taste their cones too.    It's just not interesting. Lesbians can't even have sex without toys    not him, but women who can't please (or don't even want to) men aren't arousing, to me    It was just a way for him to enjoy the scene like the rest of us, calm your autistic tits.   cones  Either you're a closet homo or your first language is spanish.       You don't have ice cream cones in your country?    Bitch, the redhead and crow have been waging war on each other for years because deep down they have feelings for each other, but they afraid of everyone's views on it. All they got to do is say no lesbo.     because deep down they have feelings for each other  Thisi s a delusion fitting of /u/     Pfff, I'm Italian. If think hard enough you can figure out that a cone resembles more a male genitals than a female ones.     You can always lend them ya dick, bro.    Underrated post    Amico hai il cazzo a punta?  HEY GUYS! I've found pointycock!      Perchè, esistono donne con la figa a forma di cono gelato?    They aint dykes, they just like to get down a little bit cause girls just wanna have fun.    Stava ovviamente parlando dei capezzoli.    There was some pleasure in this.    Era per     Scusami homie, I don't speak ferrari.      2015   Not speaking pizza.      You know they are good at sucking each others asses  maybe they should do the human centipede with Hana      The whole cast doing the human centipede would be a nice final page.      Human Centipede ending.  Now someone's reading my mind.     Chiyo should be the last receiver of everyone shit so all of her purity and sanity will be gone    Better idea, an ouroboros human centipide. Starting ass man himself      Gakuto is the only male character between two men.   Kyioshi has Gakuto behind and Medusa in front of him.      You meant bellow his mouth.    Yep.    Hana's face doesn't look crazy at all.    That's how she looked when she was introduced, reread that chapter.   The ponytail strikes back   Reina would never harm Taki-Sensei's child. But she might wait some sixteen years for the child to become legal.     He would rebel against both his parents try-hard nature and their fondness of brass instruments by learning to play the  viola .    Don't watch it because you'll realize there will never be a real girl as perfect as Kumiko and even if there was one you would never have her.       Implying Taki can have children.  Dude couldn't even have kids with his wife. What a loser.    The wait for HS commences.     No new OP/ED this week.       The buttbros after gay marriage was legalized     its an abstract kind of wrong hole.jpg        Ulala    Her interactions with Souma are always cute.     Gokigenyo     Seriously? Why not?    Yugi would be CRAZY not to hit that.   Is Houjou paired with anyone?   Changing op/ed mid-arc is weird.    that reminds me, we never got the Generalissimo Meat pose.    If they don't change to the new ones next week, will they use Souma for the ED?   Shit I've been gone for about a week or two, when/why did hippo become hypo in these threads?   Megumi/Yugi.      one of these days I'll fuck your shit up    Megumi. Maybe Yugi if you're a fag.     not 'til elections arc, sadly.     Alice tries to Gokingeyou   fails miserably     I want to protect this smile.    I don't see the hippos   Because the current OP still has the egg flipping done by Souma. We'd most probably get it in 2 weeks.    That's during the elections.   Houjou isn't a man-hater per se, but she's touchy about guys at the moment due to negative experiences. She's still perfectly capable of being friendly though as we saw with Souma.        ASSETS OUT OF CONTAINMENT            Houjou isn't a man-hater per se, but she's touchy about guys at the moment due to negative experiences  She'd ride on Yugi's D so hard once he changes his mentality on Chink cuisine.     What a qt.      She looks hideous in the anime.    2cute4me. Alice best girl, as always.        We'll never get an Alice EDgasm face     dat ED intro was perfect, JC staff so based    IE SENPAI...     I want to think the new ed will have foodgasm faces.    deep down, she wants what all women do:  the approval of stern men        He shouldn't have been a cunt about only doing just shichuan cuisine he way he does it.     mangahere      Takumi needs to smile more and be less of tsundere fag      The manlet would break in two pieces tho.     i needed to pull up the image fast. sorry i don't have every chapter archived like an obsessive fag     shichuan  Do you even ching chong nip nong? Souma would probably be the one to make him change his ways, &amp; in the process, match-make the shorty with her.       manlet   tall, strong, manly girl  It just fits.       not using Casanova's SnS page  http://casanovascans.com/series/sho<wbr>kugeki_no_soma/</wbr>    Stalker   damn    oh look, no colour    She looks like a fucking monkey. Way to ruin best girl JC Shit.     Its written in the stars. Calling it now - Yugi &amp; Houjou to hook up later on.    gokigenyo   Sharp eyes.      that does NOT look like 50 meters...    I agree. I expected much better from them, especially from an attractive character like Alice. They've let themselves down, after all the good work they have put in so far, with regards to the character designs.   hishoko a best    DAT FUCKING ASS     was promised delicious nakahara mai voice for delicious nakiri alice   get shit voice instead to go with shitty animation  fuck you JC Staff, why do I always let you trick me     Nice dubs. Also,  ...       WEEWOOWEEWOO  HYPO ON THE LOOSE      They're allocating more of their resources to Hestia a Bestia.   I would like this version of Megumi  Alice made me rip the skin.    J.C Staff wants to be fanservice   But his source material won't let him    I know, let's make the outfit super skin tight with buttons on the nipples   Ends up looking like a hippo again         If she was like that she would have been best girl.    I think that might be what some people find appealing about the idea.     strike gold with one series   drop the ball on the series that is platinum in order to maximize gold profits  full retard      dang right      Like I said in the previous thread her "inner iris rings" should have been lighter, she looks kind of scary now since it's all red/pink  It seems they took cues from her first appearance, not her current one. Hair is OK        She's going to fuck him with a strap-on.     wait, is ryouko supposed to be the sukeban there? cause megumi's design here looks more fitting to that role.     They're all delinquents there    yes, and?   megumi pleases old men with food  They ruined Alice.  Thought they would finish the breakfast thing in one episode.   For free    Are you retarded?    OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH    are YOU?   no screencaps of Kurokiba?  So how is SnS doing in Japan? Is it projecting to be a popular manga that might be one of WSJ's staples in the coming years along with upcomers like BnH? (especially that Naruto is over and all)  Erina-sama kakkoii    The doujins write themselves     No, that was a sufficient answer to your first question.    Sasuga Erina-sama    I remember Shigatsu.      Sorry, Erina is already the market leader of pleasing old men for taste approvals.      Aniki! It has always been top 5 jump material, &amp; the anime boosted sales of the latest volume.     I doubt that, Satan    Here, have rankings:     It's from that one page in the manga (I don't have it on hand) where Ryouko was also the sukeban, iirc they were walking down a hallway intimidatingly together with Ryouko in front. The other image with Megumi as the sukeban over 4 other guys is from a completely different page, but it seems they took Megumi's design from that page instead to use in this scene, which is why it's confusing.    Oh alright, I didn't remember the first time that happened.    inb4 "I was only pretending to be retarded!"            Oh hey notJun.     Why is he pissing from his head?     O-Oh my.    I want alice to terrify my meat     Climax in Erina's mouth after magnificent blowjob   Her reaction when you skipped a daily citrus fruit serving, resulting in less tangy semen      JUST FUCK  already       gokigenyo<br/>    forgot image  post ruined     that was a great transition.    watching Shokugeki no Souma without fanservice    He asked who the sukeban is, not whether they are all delinquents, your reply answered nothing.    good. the ED is so soothing, I can never skip it I just want to float away on clouds~~     But sukebans are delinquents you idiot.    EGAO GA AREBA   But I wanted a new OP/ED    Her anime eyes make her look too much like a vampire.  Her revised manga eyes look different, I dunno, fey or elvish          I'm still catching up with the manga (at Stagiare now) but does the anime tie that phrase with Erina? I can't tell much with the manga, obviously.       Its anime-original.    A sukeban is a female delinquent leader.    Treasure what you have now in case the new ones are worse    No, it isn't, she and Alice use this phrase in the manga.      Thank you based Staff.      Alice introduction is QUALITY ep  Heh    I think of it as Erina's "IIE SENPAI", her and Yukina have the same VA after all.    One whole cour to go, and it's unlikely they will begin the tournament arc now     Thought they would finish the breakfast thing in one episode.   obviously not. They did cover like 3 chapters, but it's 5 or so chapters. They weren't going to do that.      Doesn't matter, he would still be a manlet.     They probably didn't make Alice's eyes part-white because Erina has similar fully-colored eyes.     Where? Do you have a raw page to show it?    I'm not on my computer right now so I can't show you, but just check the Raws for volume 2 and 4, they use this phrase.    Not him but the Nakiris do use it every time they go for maximum smug. I know moon.     If that's the case, I wonder why there isn't an entry on that, in the wikia page.     Because casual EOP ?    [HorribleSubs] Shokugeki no Soma - 13 [1080p].mkv     1080p      HVFULL    For those who missed it, Tsukuda's reasoning for the sitting order for the first years during the leaf viewing.  まずえりなが真ん中に座って、その隣に陣取ろうとするアリスを緋沙子が制す<wbr>。田所と目が合いどうぞお座りなさいよと言うえりな。創真に一言お礼を言う<wbr>つもりがタクミと創真がギャーギャー喋ってて声をかけづらい。どこでもいい<wbr>と思ってる葉山と、むしろ隅っこが好きな美作…という感じ。   Translated by anon   For starters, Erina seats in the center, Alice tries to sit by her side but Hisako interferes.   Erina makes eye contact with Megumi and she offers her a seat.   She intended to thank Souma but he was talking loudly with Takumi so it was hard to say anything.   Hayama didn't care and Mimasaka really likes corners.        </wbr></wbr></wbr>     SnS airs in &gt;720p, iirc.    960p.    Every anime airs in 720p Some are produced at higher resolutions, but only the BDs will have them     see<br/>     &gt;Erina makes eye contact with Megumi and she offers her a seat.  So are Megumi and Erina slowly gonna become close friends?     deepest lore     some are produced at higher resolutions, but only the BDs will have them       Mimasaka really likes corners   Can he mimic it?         Megumi and Hisako are gonna help melt the ice queen for Souma   Oh wow, that small eye-contact moment when Dojima says the main ingredient is Egg.  Gotta say I'm impressed with the adaption, especially considering it's JC     I don't get it. So the TV broadcast that CR uses isn't in 960p form? I recall some anons a while back saying 1080p's the way to go for this.    Nah, they get what is broadcasted, same way nyaruko was 1080p from the get go.    They get the broadcast, and SnS is broadcasted at 720p. We'll get (upscaled) 960p in BDs.    Then why   This is confusing. Which is which now?       That's not true for all cases and especially not CR. They receive the full resolution HDCAM tape (probably a digital copy and not the actual tape) and makes a 1080p transcode.    Well that's interesting, where's the source? Every CR 1080p I have seen has just been a shit upscale, madVR does way better    It's from stalking, since he can hide in corners.   nice hokuto no ken reference in the beginning.   No good reason to watch an upscale ever.     watching downscales     Not when SnS airs in 960p.    CR upscale isn0't the same as an upsacle made by the own studio.    Oh the contrast.    http://blisswater.info/regarding-cr<wbr>unchyroll-and-1080p-streaming/  Nothing about the HDCAMs are actually confirmed but that's the best I could find but it makes the most sense.  Unless the show was actually animated at 1080p, the HDCAMs are upscaled and the upscaling is done by whoever put them on the tape and not actually by CR. If a 1080p CR rip looks crappy it's either because it was upscaled by the studio or CR just fucked the transcoding (which isn't anything new).  Try to compare the 720p with the 1080p CR rip of Hibike and you'll see a noticeable difference. I did a comparison of SnS for myself but I couldn't really see a clear difference, not like with Hibike.  But to say that "every anime airs in 720p" is completely false.        </wbr>      He will use his ebonics to copy into some form of pin.       http://blisswater.info/regarding-c<wbr>runchyroll-and-1080p-streaming/</wbr>   By Daiz  Into the bin it goes.      They need more time together first.    Possibly.        Daiz  Either way, there's no point in archiving HS, and the minimum quiality increase (when it exists) does not justify waiting 5 minutes more to the episode to download. If I had to stream crunchyshit I would pick 1080p of course, but luckily my mpc-hc is well set up.     Man, this is a really good anime.  Definitely one of the best WSJ adaptations.    So there is two more weeks until new OP and ED?   Isn't that his potential waifu from his club?   Megumi Nendo when?   Almost certain to be, since Souma will only do his egg-flipping stunt next week.    Never.  ;_;     『食戟のソーマ』特別編　“秋の選抜”直前スペシャル  Looks like no episode on July 10. They are going to air a recap special instead.    Nah, I'm certain GSC would follow up on this, pretty soon, though I think Erina will get her own nendo first, followed by Megumi &amp; Souma.       I'm surprised Erina's gauge of respect towards Megumi. With how Megumi's flashbacks of middle-school in Tootsuki are, you'd think Megumi was well-known for being a dunce in those days. I was expecting Erina to look down on her from the beginning. Then again, Erina's pamperedness and all, she probably didn't give two fucks at the time which became a boon for Megumi since she's a clean slate to Erina.   Did Erina bring up Megumi's middle-school performance when they partnered up though? Can't recall.          Well, time to kill myself.    She didn't know. Megumi was the one who said "I shouldn't tell her"     recap special  I hate this shit so much.     Sauce? I don't see the words recap in there.     buttons on the nipples  anon go get an anatomy book     Why? Some sports event? Unfinished shit?    Erina-sama perfect as always.    At least they aren't doing it in the middle of an arc.     special   as an way to start the AUTUMN ELECTION      From Google TL:  Soma 2 cool first rush anniversary special program broadcast decision of Shoku戟!  "Shoku戟 of Soma" Special Edition "Autumn of selection" just before Specials MBS : 　July 10 (gold) 26 o'clock 40 minutes to TBS : 　Normal Press than 60 minutes for the July 10 (gold) 27 o'clock 25 minutes ~ ※ special organization CBC : 　July 10 (gold) 27 o'clock 12 minutes to BS-TBS : 　July 11 (Sat) 24 hours 30 minutes to  Anime look back and, such as round-table discussion with the cast thicker deliver the prospects for the second half!  New characters of cast anxious also appeared ...! ? Cast Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Kohei Submit role), Lisa Taneda (Nagisetsu collar role), Takahashi Minami (Tadokoro Megumi-yaku) Saori Onishi (Yihe Hisako role), Nobuhiko Okamoto (Kuroki field Ryo role), the other to enjoy !               With Google translate I get something about Autumn`s Election.    Well obviously the word "recap" wouldn't be there since it's in Japanese.    Megumi is liked by everyone instantly. She's a Mary Sue.    I meant the Japanese word for recap, obviously.     Autumn of selection  They gonna fucking animate it?     Duh. The anime's gonna end at chapter 46, so obviously the selection process is gonna be inside.     dat Ryoko   Muh duck     Preliminaries probably. Which was obvious with all the cameos.    mfw butt bros get ED instead of Fuyumi    They will probably do prelims and stop before the rest, then do a whole season of that. Maybe it's less painful in anime format with 1-2 episodes/match format.    Poor Marui-kun. Guy can't catch a break.    Erina made me see the beauty of the blonde hair/purple eyes combo. It's so mesmerizing.     yeah it's an early cameo from his fangirl. The ep also had Houjou and Nao.    Nao has been stalking Erina for a while in the anime.     I want to eat Erina's Eggs Benedict so badly   Hi Gendo.    OOO MAMA LEMME GET    She asked Megumi because she said it was odd that someone talented like her hasn't received much attention. Megumi responded that she was in the lower half of the test rankings while thinking she better not say she was dead last.  So yeah, Erina doesn't pay attention to the bottom of the class, so she has no idea how poorly Megumi had been doing.        I want to eat her Benedict made from her eggs.    Thank god I already made dinner before watching the episode    Yugi will live his life in eternal regret if he doesn't bang this.    God damn it, I just ate too.    I can taste the eggyness.   Why do people like Megumi? She's literally the definition of plain.  Liking Megumi is like liking vanilla ice cream.       try to poach eggs   fuck up every time   this is some hardcore shit        Here's your reply      Add vinegar to the water.    Because all the other girls are too perfect and I'm afraid people on an anonymous anime image board will think I'm a bandwagoner.   Anime-only fag here. Is Isshiki meant to be a better cook than Erina?   Wait, what's wrong with vanilla ice cream? Is it because it's vanilla or because it's ice cream? I seriously hope you're not implying that vanilla is bad, because it has been scientifically proven to be the most appealing flavor to men, and less so to women. Ergo, not liking vanilla means you're not really a man.     Look at her. So desperate for cock.     Just because your favorite anime just ended doesn't mean you can fuck it up for the rest of us.  Fuck off.      The anime adaptation has opened my eyes to Megumi's cuteness. I was 100% Erina before but I'm not so sure anymore.    Because she's fucking adorable and really pretty and isn't a cliche tsundere bitch like Erina.    go back to your sao 2.0 thread    That's a big cake.   As an Italian, I'm horrified. I mean, it's a good dish (nothing exceptional, I do it sometimes and I'm absolutely not a great chef), but you CAN'T serve it for breakfast!   Best girls   He is a second year. Don't be surprised if he is the better cook.    anime is doing a great job making erina lovable  i mean in the manga i barely gave a fuck about her, and now look at me saving pics of her and giggling like a faggot at her interactions with soma      We don't know as he really hasn't cooked yet. But he should be, he is second year sitting on 7th seat.     streaming      read the manga   chapter of todays episode comes up    dried mullet roe on top of bagle   that sounds stupid as fuck, who would eat that    look it up   it's Botargo   never knew it's from mullet   I have eaten it since I was a child    mfw                It took me and 2 other people to finish one of these, and by the end we were completely full.    erina 10 seat isshiki 7 seat you tell me      I'm the same but with Megumi    He is 7th seat and she is 10th seat. Guess.    I'm the contrary, I got reminded how glorious Erina-sama was before she got shafted hard in the manga.    AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I can't eat it from across the screen      Are the seat numbers necessarily in ranking order of skill?     For me is the opposite, the anime is making me hate Megumi    Sasuga Erina-sama    Nigga why not?      I see.      I once visited a small town in Italy while traveling, and they all but threw me out when I tried ordering just a cappuccino in the morning. I thought only the french were picky about their food, but italian ideas about what you can have, when, with what, and for what purpose are just as odd. All the moreso because it's much more in implied, unspoken rules than explained to be taboo outright.     The anime made me open up to Erina and Megumi a lot. It's like those two were meant to be animated.  I love them both now.        she got shafted hard in the manga.  Huh?    He is cum   Takumi can.     66-chapter arc where she was a barely in. Didn't help that some of the extra chapters explicitly said that Erina won't appear that much from here on out when the arc was starting.     yes like every other shonen but there will be another ep they talk more about the seats    She was like missing in the whole election arc which was 1/3 of the manga and just in the recent arc she's finally making a comeback    It's actually by prestige and power, but it's a very close correlation to skill since you can use your cooking skill to acquire prestige and power. It would probably be rare for any E10 member to be a better cook than one ranked just 2 seats above them, and in those cases the discrepancy is likely corrected the next time they order the rankings.    watching Fairy Tail with food   ....it is? I have never seen it on a menu.   If she was a better cook than him she'd just challenge him to a shokugeki for his seat.   What the hell does Alice say?  Gomensabase? It's too quick for me.     Why on earth would he accept that? What would he get out of it?     he doesn't like vanilla ice cream     Same here. Maybe it's served in some specialty or rich place.    I think its a "cute" way of saying sorry or whatnot.     Rich people eat this kinda shit.       Could it be a foreigner misconception? Here in my country they say similar things when I go to American-themed restaurants.       I think the japs who wrote this onlyvisited NYC or some fancy west coast city where you probably have more food options.   I don't think most americans know what egg benedict even is. I thought that was some western or nothern European dish.       Yeah obviously, I just wonder what she's actually saying.    dat WOOOOOOHHHHHHH.   I like anime Takumi better than the manga one.     seeing this reference made me really happy    Erina is rich, I'm sure she'd find something to wager.    gomenasobase that's ojousama way of apologizing     Gotcha     Her tongue.     Plots of land inside the academy (all the clubs she destroyed) and prestige for beating a Nakiri. She has a ton to wager.     Where are you from? I grew up in the Midwest (Illinois and Michigan) and you see eggs benedict on almost every breakfast menu around here, even at cheap places.    I knew what it was, I just never saw it anywhere.  Nips never talk about the west coast.  ;_;        and they all but threw me out when I tried ordering just a cappuccino in the morning  Uh? Strange. It's pretty common to have breakfast with a cappuccino actually. The most common breakfast here (at least when eating outside of home) is croissant+coffee/cappuccino. Of course this isn't the only kind of breakfast you can have, but surely not frittata (unless it's some strange sweet variant).   &gt;but italian ideas about what you can have, when, with what, and for what purpose are just as odd. All the moreso because it's much more in implied, unspoken rules than explained to be taboo outright.  Try asking for Parmigiano cheese while eating some fish-based pasta dish if you want the waiters to hate you.          Should be North American. I've seen it quite a few times, usually in hotels. Some diners serve it, but usually hotels do them due to how much of a pain in the ass it is to make them.    I see.    I sometimes watch fairy tail while eating. What's your point?   Anime&gt;Manga    I don't think most americans know what egg benedict even is  Why wouldn't we, when we invented it? Yeah, it's fancy shit compared to most "American" food, but no one but fatfucks like us would come up with shit like this that abuses english muffins and hollandaise sauce at the same time.     Have you never had brunch in New York? Every place worth its salt has eggs benedict.      all this QUALITY on Alice   her tight chef uniform that was boner inducing in the manga looks so wonky    JC Staff are a bunch of jokahs!        sauce looks too runny tbh thats also not a benedict since it has spinach       Why does she keep popping up out of nowhere?     yfw she pops up in maddogs bed       I don't mind her QUALITY but the voice is the biggest offender. I hoped to get my dick hard from it.    Fuck you talking about bro, spinach is excellent on eggs benedict.    Takumi is always cute but I agree that his pumped up rivalry moments are showcased nicely in the anime.    tfw only 11 episodes left and then S2 never     I wish for his arc in defeating Souma for his Mezza-Luna. Thing is, I hope Souma puts up a fucking fight in that and not a "I'm giving this one to you."   Guy needs a break. Gigganigga wrecking him was such a shame.       its not an eggs benedict then its like a combination of a Benedict and a Florentine     That looks like rocket or lettuce, not spinach. It's just a garnish either way.     semantics      Desert southwest.   Which is also a food desert in a sense (although the tradeoff is we get more based mexican food)        Imagine his shokegeki with Giganigga now with voice actors and dramatic music, shit should be impactful      I thought Takumi was going to be Souma's biggest rival, but was dissapointed when he jobbed to Gigganigga.  But that means there's going to be a lot of buildup for their next shokugeki.       Is the anime even selling well?    Florentine is a type of eggs benedict, isn't it?    This. Since Takumi lost I pretty much now consider Souma's big boss rival to just be the elite 10 first seater.    You're retarded right? Even if you're an animeonlyfag you should know Erina is the 10th seat of the Elite Ten while Isshiki is 7th seat, sice it was clearly stated.    Why is Hishoko so qt?  I never thought I would get this attached to a sidekick character.     yes one has bacon one has spinach instead      [ron] Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid 01-12 (BATCH)  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05040  Bring on season 2.  </wbr>     Bring on season 2.   God, no.        Thanks a lot, ron.     Bring on season 2.  Do want. My body is ready to see Champion's fight.      people think it won't get continued     tag is changed so it doesn't trigger my RSS   You're a faggot, Ron.  Thanks.        Thanks for the batch Anon. And thanks for the doujin too, I didn't know you were the one that translated it too.    No one ever reads the credits.   ah yes finally, thanks a lot for the hard work Ron   Oh thank god, I'm free.  Thank you for your hard work.     WHY IS IT SO SLOW FUCK YOU   All hardsubed?   Oh neat. Thanks for your hard work, Ron.   I hope so    Sorry to disappoint you but they're all softsubbed to MBS rips, manually retimed down to each frame.      The bad thing is now my smart tv will throw up all sort of weird code when notes or signs are supposed to appear on screen.    Timing to individual frames and keyframes is the best and most thankless part of timing. The scum who are so lazy to let scene cut bleeding happen or use TPP are the worse than Hitler.    Wait for [whateverFish] encodes.    I have the exact same problem with my TV. Rather than waste bandwidth downloading two copies, I always download softsubs and then just throw them into Handbrake to make a hardsub copy. It only takes about five minutes to encode if you pick reasonable settings. It's so fast and easy that I don't understand how groups like DeadFish even exist. I guess bandwidth really is unlimited for some people so they never bother to google how to do such things. I don't have that luxury which is why it's gonna take a while to seed this.   Confirmed by quads.        still having limited bandwidth  In my third world country that's like only very few jew ISPs doing, and only in areas with no alternatives. And they dying fast.    https://twitter.com/vivid_tv/status<wbr>/614269152807620608 Special program airing tomorrow.   今夜22:30～TOKYO MX／27:10～MBSにて『魔法少女リリカルなのはViVid スペシャルプログラム』放送です！ヴィヴィオとアインハルトの出会いからイ<wbr>ンターミドルまで、鮮烈な物語を振り返ります！</wbr>    </wbr>   Same hour?    Maybe we will finally find out info about the BD release and possible second cour plans.    Yes    GOD YES! THANK YOU FOR ALL SOFTSUBS FINALLY!     Looking back at a fresh story about the time between Vivio/Einhart's meeting and the Inter-Middle!     Hmm... maybe I'll give this a watch if a batch comes out with the BD releases.    You are a champ.       You are late ron, I'm not talking to you anymore!  Come on, seed faster faggots, I need my dose of lesbians.   Thank you for coming back from the dead to bring us lolis.    Fine! Then I'm not give you this cleaned cover background from the doujin I scanlated!   I had been attempting to manually manage it in various ways to prioritize the uploading of episodes 11 and 12 but apparently everyone who was prioritizing those eps aren't sharing what I give them so had to stop that. Still pruning obvious leechers and looking for that one sweet uploader to give all my bandwidth to.       3rd!   I hope it'll still have seeds when I get home.   Thanks for the subs. And thanks God for bringing you back to life.   I had a connection drop a little while ago. That prompted me to make the following batch patcher. It's actually a quite a bit of tedious work to make so I was hoping to avoid it.  https://www.mediafire.com/?wr5crvwg<wbr>95f83sp  If you possess a full copy of Leopard's raws (or even some of them), put them all in the same folder, put these files in that folder, run the bat file (not the exe), and please come help seed. The last time I did this for ep5, one person came and I gave up on ever doing it again. If you want to actually show your thanks, please do it now if you can.  </wbr>     Thanks, I just patched my raw files, I'll try to help seed the batch torrent now.   thanks based Ron   I love you aRon but this is the slowest fucking torrent ever     1 seed   424 leachers  I think I found your problem. He already posted a way around it here      based Ronanon is kingu  The swarm has episodes 11 and 12 which is the important part. The rest will slowly trickle in over the next day or two. Various sources say that there are other seeds but if they exist, then my awful connection still seems to be the best.  who are the best of the new character bloat. I like victoria and girl sol badguy. miura is cute too but for some reason I feel like her face is really punchable.  Thank you based ron  May your fields forever bare abundant crops    This show was incredibly disappointing. Half of it was devoted to training/tournament shit, and then the whole thing wasn't even covered.   Thanks.  It was faster to download the raws and patch them. I'll help seed.      There's an event coming up soon right? I expect they'll announce the second cour then. The ending (and the rest of the show) was so underwhelming that it just seems like they were planning to continue it.     wanting butchered of loli service adaptation  Why do people do this?     I don't know what the fuck the point of the show was if it's not getting a second cour. I guess we'll know soon enough.    Cashgrab, like, durr.   So what's the deal with this special airing in a few hours? Is it going be a full episode or shorter? I assume it's going to cover some of the manga scenes that got cut.  good man     4 Seeds   493 leechers   Seriously you guys?         Seeders are the ones who patched the raws.     I'm seeding the last 2 episodes only since I didn't bother to download 1-10.   I'd love to help the few people ho still haven't died in here, but my connection is way too poor for uploading stuff, so I just grabbed 11 and 12 and ran off. I even have problems uploading large images to 4chan, so please forgive me. I promise I'll seed properly once I have a decent upload speed or at least a connection that doesn't kill itself while uploading. By the way Rio is the best.   The number of seeds went from about 4 to 200 in the past five minutes. Anyone just now discovering this thread should ignore all previous complaints about speed.  Thanks a bunch to the few anons who helped. You probably ended up doing about 70% of the work tonight. It really would've just been me for at least a full day or two without your help. Now I might actually be able to get some sleep before starting on subs for this special.     Sleep tight Ron    Sieg is the strongest!    thank you TL anon, but I somehow wish for another studio to actually remake it with better art &amp; animation.    Thank you based Ron, sleep well.   Why couldn't they have just said "13 episodes"? Why do 12 episodes and then 1 that airs in practically the same time slot one week after the finale and not even bother to announce it until hours before its airing?   It's an event or something, not an episode.   What part of the story did S1 cover up to?   The finale ended with Vivio's next opponent being Miura.  And Einhart's next opponent is the champion.  I hope that helps Lutecia and the witch also fought filler girls to introduce their magic (What does the witch even do? A psychological assault?)       Did the anime skip anything important? If not, what chapter can I start at in the manga?        story    Is there even enough material for S2?   Yes. The manga continues quite a bit past where the scanlations currently cut off. More than 10 chapters further.     yfw the anime surpases the translated chapters      The only stories are the ones I like. If I don't like it, it's not an story  Fuck off, shitposter     SYU seems to have a thing for sunhats right now. Can't say I disapprove.     just a recap episode     not liking recap episodes    https://twitter.com/fujimatakuya/st<wbr>atus/614433281312866304 魔法少女リリカルなのはViVid　スペシャルプログラム放送終了しました<wbr>☆ そしてリリカルなのはViVidのBD/DVD鋭意製作中です、続報をお待<wbr>ちください＾＾</wbr> </wbr> </wbr>   I can't believe.     What is this?    So, did the special today air anything new?   There's some announcement coming?    [Ohys-Raws] Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid - 12.5 (MX 1280x720 x264 AAC).mp4    It was a recap.       not the chapter about Vita and Nanoha  I'm sad.      Please wait for further news about DVD/BD      Not this  Wasted potential.     Thank you.   Rio vs banchou never.   which doujin is this?      Not a doujin, that's from A la Carte.    "A Cold Nights Average Meal"  It's from Nanoha A la Carte, not from a doujin.         They could have done better.    It's not? Is this a spin-off manga?        Yeah, there is Vivid Life too. There is a good bunch of Nanoha official side material that didn't get much attention in the west.    Pretty much.   There's also Vivid Life, by Nekotofu.      Goddamn ninja'd.     I want more Material Musume.   thank you based aRon    Whores.      Anon please, I literally just finished fapping.    Only Hayate is the whore there, Signum, Nanoha and Fate are just dressing slutty for their mistress/waifu.    no plot   recap ep    My waifu &gt; your waifu  Seems like no one cares. A shame, but we all have read the manga I guess.   http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3852370259<wbr>  Spoilers for this months Innocent.  </wbr>   But Nanoha, you're my waifu.     child Fate   Nah.         I want to fuck Vivio!      Posting the highlights.  Wait, that wasn't really the last episode, was it?   Split-cour is pretty much a given at this point.    This was last ep and last nanoha series ever    if you lie, I will kill you      Subaru is a lucky girl.    Thanks for the hard work each week!  Sucks that a few leechers are making it take longer for everyone.    To everyone currently downloading, go to your own settings and set 11 and 12 to higher priority!         It was.   Oh goody, I get to retime 1/12th of the season again from scratch. It'll probably be subbed by tomorrow night for the few who care. I'm not in any hurry.  who is your favorite nanoha  mine is hayate     I need this background.      Cripple Hayate. I feel the need to specify this.     the only Nanoha is Nanoha    Vita is mine.    TEANA    Stern    Dearche = Gilgamesh Yuri = Enkidu     Nanoha.    Fate is my waifu but I'm more than happy to share her with Nanoha. Yukarin &gt; Nana anyway.    That would be Signum.   Claimed btw.      Megane.    Thanks aron. Vivid gets a lot of hate but I still kind of like it and I'm glad at least someone subbed it.    Nanoha doesn't share her waifu. Also Nana &gt; Yukarin.     Einhart's cat    I love Rein. And Feito. And all the nanohas.    My nigga    Is this lolicon.       Some people aren't in it for the fanservice. Personally, I got into Nanoha for the magic and fightan and fortunately that hasn't changed with Vivid.      She is older than recorded history   Ruri soon.  Sora when?  Yuya vs Yugo when?   not for like another 12 episodes at least    Who?    Yugo will duel Yuya because he sees him dueling the KINGU and gets jealous        In that case,I hope Yuzu hits him with the fan one day. It's like they forgot that gag.    Sora will probably appear in Synchro Dimension once Leo decides to send Yuri and Sora there with the Obelisk Force.  If Sora stays at Academia for whatever reason (I doubt it Leo needs all the help he can get to capture Yuzu and Serena), he could be used to properly introduce Ruri and Rin into the story if he meets both of the Ruris while they are imprisoned. Though I think Yuri and Sora's roles will be reversed compared to last time.  Meaning Yuri's mission will be to capture Serena (and succeed because Yuri is that good) while Sora's mission will be to capture Yuzu (and fail to do do. Meaning Yuzu wins the duel and escapes, Sora wins the duel but Yuzu escapes him regardless, or the duel is interrupted by someone like Yugo which allows Yuzu to escape and/or Sora gets BTFO).  Either way, it will end with Serena being captured and Yuzu will be reunited with Yuya.         why is yu ya  so perfect  How many people and who are they going to recruit people from the Synchro Dimension?   shinji is the most likely one   some characters from friendship cup maybe  the fact that they're doing high speed riders and making speed roids an actual thing makes me think yugo might not get absorbed       post the arc-v mega link  Last thread was defeated in a glorious battle of discussion  Speaking of Battles, I'm hoping to see another Ichigo fight.  When will Jugram stop being best girl? The answer is never.   and speaking of discussion aren't most of ichigo's 'fights' his way of arguing for information and debating?    I guess. I just want to see this New Bankai, Sword, and to see if he has Getsuga Tensho still. The Japanese voice actor for Ichigo was amazing.    He will, if he dare to kill best SR Bazz-B.    more like bazzed-b  Bazz rhymes with base, right?       rhymes  What are you doing?      inb4 quincy/ hollow dual wield     you making a prince of bel air rap? I could see that working      Would Based-B be better?     Yes. kek     tfw one day ywach shows up and fucks us around    got bored and made this using this anon's template  chekem out     Waiting on bateman    did we start the fire guys?   In the last thread someone posted Tier locked away but wasn't she freed?   Where did young yahweh get wraparound shades a thousand years before their invention?    no.   The last thread was filled with 4th level mindfucks. Can we achieve that now?   He's just too cool to care about things like that.  Not invented yet? Like I give a fuck.      Fashion is directly proportional to power level in Bleach. If you're strong enough, you can make fashionable clothing and wear appear out of nothing.   found this; accurate as fuck http://en.akinator.com/personnages/<wbr>jeu  guesses your waifu/husbando/it  </wbr>    I wouldn't be surprised if Urahara had actually freed her    She was revealed to be locked up with Yhwach in the original silbern in the shadow realm of seireitei. No idea where she is now, but she was never freed and the tres bestias were defeated by quilge so there was no one with any particular interest in rescuing her left.     urahara   freed   free   get anything from urahara without a price  kek  inb4 he ran a black market         Will Tessai ever use his cuhrayzee wizard powers in battle proper or are we destined to be forever blueballed?   I onder what ichigo thinks about tessai coming back    doesnt mean that someone couldnt accidentally stumbled upon her and released her    the most interesting thing about this particular image of Halibel is that she remains in her released form while unconcious which no other arrancar can do    The consensus is that Kubo realized how fucking broken kido are, and wrote out anyone who could use ridiculous kido.    people 'stumble' onto pictures of her every night anon   this is debatable       Checking in how many things is Ichigo "half" of now?    human spirit zanpakuto hollow shinigami quincy and faggot          aizen ywach getsuga himself      and no one said she "couldn't," but the fact is that thus far no one has had the opportunity and so the reasonable assumption is that she "hasn't."    nothing implied she was unconscious, and if anything her pose suggests she's awake, just exhausted and obviously in shackles.    Wrong kido is not only requires a character to be extremely adept with Kido it has to be used against someone whos weaker than the user to be effective  Itto Kaso did nothing to Aizen Kurohitsugi didnt even critically injure Komamura Rukias Soren Sokatsui is weaker than Byakuyas Sokatsui which did fuck all against Yammy Raikaho nothing against Isshin Everything below that gets laughed off by vice captains          sho is the strongest hado m8   While reading Jugo's uncle words, it came to me that maybe he wasn't sexually abused, and perhaps his uncle just used him for his power, so maybe Jugo's energy goes to his uncle in some sort of balance, and that's why his creepy uncle wanted him, and it would explain his power I guess.    power of youth  nah, got abused     I think it will become clear later on either way, if it's indeed sexual abuse, he will really side with Yhwach for killing his uncle, and if it was indeed power transfer/balance, such a technique will be explained. We just have to wait 6 million weeks to see that.     It's a stupid question because all of the races are mixes of something. A quincy is part human, a shinigami uses a hollow as its zanpakuto etc.     an israeli is part human, a german uses a mexican as it's japanese      Its makes more sense that he wanted him because he was the closest living relative. Why jump to such a strange conclusion?  The abuse thing makes sense given how  cute  jugo is and the conjunction of how reluctant he was to return to his uncle and the scars on his arm.        The abuse thing makes sense given how cute jugo is and the conjunction of how reluctant he was to return to his uncle and the scars on his arm.  True, I also believe that Jugo is  adorable , but recently I read the VIz translation:  ?:"Hey! Jugo! So there you are! Coming so deep into the forest by yourself! I told you not to! I'm useless without you. You know that. My sweet Jugo..."   The "I'm useless without you" part made me think of that. I won't rule out the pedo thing, and it still makes lots of sense, it's just with how this is still a shounen and reading that, the idea came to me.  All I meant was that there is also a chance that he could be after Jugo's power rather than his body...Or maybe both.                   No. That's just creepy pedo talk.     Okay...We will just wait and see for sure.    Ichigo will never fight again.    Kek'd hard    Not even against Yhwach?    Well it wouldn't be much of a fight since Ywach is a god.    Ichigo already knows the warmth of a male body. He isn't pure anymore    And Ichigo cant achieve his dangai level?    He's already at that level, but Ywach has ascended further.     only took 6 questions to guess right     Still more pure than Orihime    Disgusting.    Aaaaaagghhhnnn we'll see.    Woah never seen this thing before!     Ywach   creates the sternritter and plans to attack soul society cause he's foreseen them becoming a threat to quincy   him creating the sternritter and invading leads to the Quincy getting btfo and being hated   hostility eventually leads to another war and Quincy extermination   yfw you realize Yhwach inadvertently caused the very shit he'd foreseen   yfw it's a self-fulfilling prophecy         I want more flashbacks with cute little Jugo. My cute Jugo   He doesn't have a choice.   He knows he's going to get blown the fuck out by the Shinigami and he has to do it anyway.  If the future is written how he sees it and his foresight is accurate, it doesn't matter what he does.  His future is to get blown the fuck out whether or not he attempts to follow it because the end result is already set in stone for him.   If Ichigo was a more sarcastic protagonist he'd just be like "Nice foresight faggot. If you were really God, you'd be able to go against your foresight."          Races as in more like spiritual makeup.     omg   he guessed mine on the first try      You told me this was shit, it isn't. Why do you always lie to me, /a/?    /a/ has shit taste what else is new  But it is. It's grimdark, 2deep4me, angsty tween garbage. Your taste in anime is bad and you should feel bad.     Nice buzzwords, do you know any more?   Posting OTP.     It was an asspulled 12 episode kyoani shit.   I didn't like it while watching it, but after some time I do think its a pretty decent show.   i've only watched the dance number from the OVA, how edgy is it?   Probably the most visually impressive show by KyoAni.   I watched the recap movie and enjoyed it.     being this meme-minded     letting other people tell you what you should think   HEH.    The ending is shit; heard it was adapted in a weird manner that cut off the actual ending or something.   Not /a/'s fault that you have shit taste.   The whole thing has movie quality, how does KyoAni do it?   Indeed, biggest positive surprise ever.  And the ED transitions were the best I have ever seen in anything. Turns out this is an art of its own.  Is the latest movie worth it not-shit-taste-/a/?        Slaving chinese people    maybe if it was even subbed     /a/ says everything is shit.  I've seen people call Yotsuba overrated.    Mirai-hen when    You told me this was shit  Why would you listen to shitposters who didn't actually watch it?     /a/ says something good, it acually bad    This. In the end, it's all bulshit. Best episode was Idol Episode. Caught me by surprise.   Why is Mirai such a slut?   I never thought I'd like idol shit, but that episode is among my favorite episodes   It's KyoAni's masterpiece. There just exists a very large and annoying portion of /a/ that perpetuates the meme that KyoAni is good.    You don't go on to /a/ and expect them to know what quality is, anon. That's just common knowledge.     you forgot forced animation, forced drama, gary stu, bad pacing, bad writing and some other buzzwords that I'm forgetting     there are people who actually use the term 'forced animation' as a real complaint      bad writing  That's not a buzzword.     What else is a talentless pretty girl supposed to do for money?   Spoilers from the movie.    Do you remember how when Mirai got sucked into Kyoukai no Kanata there was a puppet Akkiko there? Akkiko's strong love for her while he regained a grip on KnK's power ended up creating another one of those and Mirai's soul inhibited it, However as a result of this, she lost any and all memories of her previous life near the end of the movie some stuff happens and Mirai makes the choice to keep living as she is now even without the memories and she and Akkiko actually kiss. Details on why her hair turned black and the general plot of the movie will have to wait for the blue rays, Sorry.     It's like people have different opinions or something...    That's not a buzzword.   The writing is shit because this thing didn't make sense   Actually if you pay attention you can see that it all makes sense, specifically these elements were explained in these episodes etc.   LALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU! THAT'S A BUNCH OF UNCONFIRMED BULLSHIT THAT YOU'RE JUST PULLING OUT OF YOUR ASS TO JUSTIFY THE RETARDED WRITING!  And then a fucking sequel movie got announced that literally has the premise rooted in the exact explanation the non-shitposters in the threads gave. It's almost like if you watched it and payed attention instead of shitposting like a retard, you could follow the show. I know it's a little tricky to follow exposition that isn't LN haremshit tier fantasy like Mahouka or SAO or Raildex, but if you try really hard you can understand what the story is trying to convey.        I don't know, something decent?     Kyoani   kiss       grimdark  please die      forced animation   What the fuck does that even mean?       What the fuck does that even mean?   Kyoani actually treats its staff like people and has proper time management and budgeting that allows them to properly animate their series. Shitposters need something to latch on to, so they call it forced animation and then shitpost about how it'll take 20k sales just to break even with the insane budget they spent on the show and how Kyoani is finished and going out of business.       It's KyoAni's masterpiece   Let's get real for a second, it's certainly not bad and it has it's moments, not to mention that it looks fantastic but that's about it.      The regrettably large, retarded portion of /a/ which shit-talks and refuses to watch any "moeshit" will tell you that every KyoAni show is shit. Ignore them.    It's a movie,anon. After all that shit, they deserve to kiss.   SUBBED BDS  soon  probably     You know who KyoAni is and what they do, don't you?    Not the anon you are talking to but yeah, they were the guys that animated Hyouka right? You know, the show that is a lot better than KnK.    Yeah I know that they made Disappearance. Claiming that anything but that is their masterpiece, is retarded.    You say that because you can't read japanese.   Meh, it would have bee a master piece if she remained  dead .    le Disappearance is good maymay  At least The Shawshank Redemption had Morgan Freeman.     I-Is this official?   Kyoukai no Kanata thread, Amagi Brilliant Park thread and Hibiki thread, Why is there no Hyouka thread? That's the best one.    grimdark     If you dislike Disappearance you don't have anything valuable to add.   maymay   Remove yourself.        I can read moon. I love KnK, but Hyouka is pretty much the best anime ever made.    Says the one who actively likes overrated shit.     Only bittersweet endings are good   I don't care if the plot literally built up and completely explained it, bittersweet ending is more important  You're a fucking retard.     Ending sucked dick    Plot LITERALLY built up and completely explained it  She just fucking shows up      The main problem with this show is the writer clearly had no idea what to do whenever there wasn't an action scene going on and we got the worst kind of excuses for what I guess was supposed to be character banter. Thosw scenes just felt so stilted and just sort of there as part of a checklist. A lot of the writing made no sense and even managed to contradict itself at times to. Literally nobody would have given the slightest shit about this show if it wasn't dear Kyoani involved.     Eat a dick, we get  good endings  every day, but this called for that pitter sweet flavour. It was perfect for it.     Said every season for whatever show is currently airing. Meaningless      i heard if people suck their clocks hard enough and are sure to shitpost their shows it gives them special drawing powers.     It's more the sudden jump. It does a pretty good foreshadowed sad end, then jumps back to a weakly foreshadowed happy end. Then add films to keep the emotional yo-yo bouncing around.  The rest of the show ranges from good to great, but the ending was too indecisive. Hopefully mirai-hen resolves it a bit.       Akkey absorbs KnK and it disappears from the world into him   Mirai disappears as well b/c she and KnK were fused   as KnK disappears so does she   KnK is absorbed into Akkey so Mirai must also   Contained within Akkey is all of KnK's energy and power and some pretty fucking intense emotions   youmu are created out of intense emotional energy   Akkeys emotions tap KnK's power and create a youmu   New Miral is a youmu    youmu are created from intense human emotion  Source: Episode 1(or 2)  KnK and Mirai were joined together  Source: Episodes 10 and 11  Akkey can access KnK powers  Source: Episode 11 and 4  KnK has the power to create youmu  Source: Episodes 10 and 11  Try not to be so retarded next time.                      It does.     She just fucking shows up  Try watching the fucking show with your eyes open. The explanation was foreshadowed across the series.   Eat shit you retard. It didn't call for it at all. Disregarding plot buildup and foreshadowing for the sake appeasing bittersweet shit eaters like yourself is horrible writing.   People were literally talking about how it would go down from episode 11 when the final pieces were in place to explain how he'd get Mirai out of the KnK. You have to be blind to not see it.           It started shit, showed potential but then went back to being shit again. Is that summation enough?  That said I hope the new movie will redeem it in the same way the Tamako movie redeemed that.      Disappearance was good but Kyoani has made much better anime since then.    Oops, wrong collage.    Do tell.     Sometimes. Anime fandom tends to be the biggest echo chamber where the same shit gets said about the same sorts of shows and creators pretty much every season. I've come to the conclusion of late that anime fandom is largely just populated by socially stunted idiots who have come to enjoy living out the stereotypes of otaku and just being awkward and predictable as all fuck. Its little wonder things can feel so stagnant these days.     Word salad. Maybe it makes sense in moon?     I wanted to kill you at the beginning but I ended up   falling in love with you    Of course ending in a bittersweet note wouldn't fit that setting.  EAT A DICK A T  A  D I C K                 This series came out before I could really understand moon well, and I had absolutely no trouble following what was going on. Is English not your first language, because those subs explain it quite clearly.    KyoAni   trashed      I don't care about foreshadowing and buildup   I don't care about exposition or world building   All I care about is my bittersweet ending   And shitposting with /sp/ style vertical text  Kill yourself.       I don't get it how Mirai came back to live in the end  I can see it already in the absence of a Kyoani show airing /a doesn't know what to do and just bring up old Kyoani shows to shitpost. This is your summer season folks.   See     where the fuck do i watch the new movie i cant find that shit anywhere nigga   Why is she so perfect?   I want Aoyama to dominate me. https://<span>youtu.be/6Yl2BXbt_Ww?t=3m5s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]    New charasong previews: http://www.gochiusa.com/contents/cd<wbr>/index02500000.html</wbr>  Reminder that S2 OP and ED songs are going to be mediocre.    have you seen Mangaka-san to Assistant-san. Sorry for shit quality and youtube, but:  https://<span>youtu.be/mnGuiDzySNs?t=8m30<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]       I like the third the most but first is also nice.   Which Shonen manga has the best worldbuilding?   Akagi      Magi, also posting superior Dark Continent.     shit piece   worldbuilding  kek     Bleach  New episode Soon   wrapping up all the hints and foreshadowing  I sure fucking hope that includes bringing BeniJiro back. Preferably complete with Hoshijiro's personality and all her memories.      I'm somehow really happy to see Kobayashi able to to have normal interactions with the crew now that she took off her mask.     My dick is  megastructure     You will never wake up and be surrounded by honokas     Shouldn't Sasaki be the one who tells Nagate what has happened to Benijiro?   Post smug anime. I need to expand my collection.    not using KDE        Da best neet     wake up   check /a/   still no news about Hunter x Hunter  send help      Pitou is a slut. I will delete nothing.    How many threads have you posted this in?     Just this one afaik, possibly 2 though that other one must've been months ago. Nana is a very popular manga and has a well known very long hiatus.  Sorry       Not all hiatuses are created equal. I loved Nana but I don't feel any serious urge to see the end, there wasn't as much half resolved plot as there is in HxH.    I was thinking of picking it up but i don't want to follow a 4th manga that is on permanent hiatus.  Is it worth it?   </blockquote>]
