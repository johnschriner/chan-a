[ Closer and closer to the most perverted Slime, are you ready for Suu? <br><br>Compilation Video:<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14376<wbr>57676</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Part of the fun of Suu's character is seeing her learn and developing her own unique personality. Shes come far from mimicking others</br>  I still want a chapter that shows where she came from. From past works from the author it seems that slimes are wild monster girls, and girl slimes evolve from small slimes.  <br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>post the full thing in the op next time</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>Faggot, I'm the same OP as the previous 2 threads I didn't post that playlist because there os other one with subs but incomplete.</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>So perhaps maybe Suu could accidentally create herself a sister?</br>  <br> she came from space </br>  when do the episodes air, and when do the translations usually come through?  <br>I wonder if her job actually paid her better she wouldn't such a giant work evading and lazy woman. <br><br>When she wants to get shit done she can, but she's usually trying to be the opposite of that.</br></br></br>  <br>Tuesday morning. Subs can usually be found later in the day</br>      So tell me /a/, which girl got the deal design-wise in the anime so far?<br><br>I'd say horsepussy, she looks qt as fuck now.</br></br>  <br>Looks so fucking adorable.</br>  <br>Probably not. Because her lazyness goes outside of her job. As shown by her dirty appartment</br>  <br><br>Bird.<br><br>Horse was already qt as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*got the best deal<br><br>Typing on your phone can be troublesome.</br></br></br>  Is Ms. Smith secretly a monstergirl?  <br>fan theories say shes a succubus</br>  <br>READ<br>THE <br>MANGA<br>FAGGOT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>She's a  semendemon girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. Possibly. Probably. Yes.</br>  <br>Only a theory so far.</br>  <br><br>It's no secret man is the greatest monster of them all.</br></br>  <br>Yes, the worst monster of all.<br>A Human.<br>Subspecies: Asian</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't that Doppel giving smith an excuse to be able to torture the pig guy for the whole mess?</br>    <br> You will never love Smith enough to break in an clean her appartment. </br>  <br>It's totally ending with Lala antics.</br>  <br>What ever is in that box I WANt it.</br>  <br>No.Sweetie Witch Mako-chan, obviously.</br>  <br> Cleaned so well that she no longer has a sink. </br>  <br>Cerea was always the qtest of the girls in the manga. But I think Papi's voice is also very cute.</br>  <br>I hope that makes her a bit more popular so she might get more screentime.</br>  <br>and a few cabinets are gone too</br>  <br>Papi's voice is very cute. It sounds so familiar for some reason, but I can't place it.</br>    <br>Ari Ozawa?Does the name tell you something?</br>   next episode has best girl introduction <br><br>hell yes</br></br>    <br>Episode 5 should be hype.<br>Suu Rape, Mero and Mon debut.</br></br>  Anyone have the YT link for the shorts w/ sub titles?  I know I'm late but what the fuck, CR?  <br>Wouldn't be surprised if MON was rearranged. Even in the manga, it's positioning was strange.</br>  Suu a sweetheart.  <br> At what point did you began to consider that Suu wants to make the harem end reality so that everyone can remain happily together? </br>  <br>Fool! The slime only wants two things. That is 1. RAPE and 2. Fluid.</br>  <br>Suu and Papi are sweethearts who value friendship over everything else.<br><br> Miia is a slut who has no interest in anything but MC dick. </br></br></br>  <br>So Papi's bird legs in an artistic manner also are supposed to be like stockings?</br>  Is it just me or does Rachnee never get much "screentime" she's always in the background, never the focus  <br> Miia is a slut <br>I know this combination of words trigger some Miia-fags<br> Don't start shit now </br></br></br>  <br>Just as Rachnee is a good mom</br>    <br> that spoiler  <br>Son last night was one of the worse threads I've seen in a long time. Lets not wake all the hate up again.</br></br>  <br>It reflects her personality.</br>  <br>Such is the fate of best girl</br>  <br>Well she's not wrong.</br>  <br>And Rachnee's legs with it's deep black color are like black leather pants fitting towards that white top or the black bra like clothing.</br>  <br>And then she was raped</br>  <br>Her time will come, for she is destined to win</br>    <br>At least we got that nice coffee chapter.</br>  <br>why are you posting two pokemons? </br>        <br>Hey, Polt!<br> Let's go for a walk. </br></br>  <br/>    <br><br/></br>    If I say that it's not the fur, nose, tail and ears that got me on Polt, but her great ASS  personality, will anyone believe me?  cerea probably smells so bad and shits everywhere. disgusting  <br><br>I like to believe these aren't edits.</br></br>  <br>LIKE A BARN</br>    <br> cloaca snake </br>  <br>No...</br>  <br>Nah.She takes frequent baths.</br>  <br><br> STILL having no idea how horse asses work </br></br>  <br><br>Do we have to go through this ever thread?

It got me into buying it along with all the currently released manga from MonMusu.</br>  <br>I own it. I can attest to that.</br>  <br>Yeah, the color pages were also really nice</br>  <br>They'll probably just reduce the effect to being right around her bagina so you can see her thighs.</br>  <br> that sound of her two tits smacking each other. </br>  What does Suu taste like?  <br>Fresh water, unless she drink a bottle of syrup.</br>  <br>Like jello</br>  <br>Shit.</br>  <br>Blueberry Jello.</br>  <br>Lemon jelly</br>  Damn Polt is really underrepresented, We need more Polt!  <br>Most logical, but kind of boring wouldn't you say? <br><br><br><br>Yes.

A little dark for Cerea though...unless she got really desperate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A little dark for Cerea though...unless she got really desperate. <br><br>I do wonder if Suu is even digestible. Imagine the bowel movement that would result if she weren't, basically an old testament grade bulk forming agent.</br></br></br>  <br> A little dark for Cerea though...unless she got really desperate. <br><br>Someone now needs to draw cerea donned in armor and weapons with the bodies of all the other girls strewn about slain, with her telling her master that there's only one left to choose.</br></br></br>  Reminder that Rachnera AKA Rachnee AKA best girl is the only one who has never, ever hurt Darling despite having genestealer rending claws for hands.  <br>I wonder if she would wear gloves during sex, or if Darling would endure it like the in Crab's earlier work.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ksg<wbr>rOD-SdpA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Poltfags are just kindling. It's the anti-furfags that either start the fire or fan the flames.<br><br>Either way, it's just two idiotic parties butting heads over not having the same viewpoint.

I can see 2 and 7, but why do people like slice of life jojo that much?</br></br></br>  <br>No u.</br>  <br>Because they like JoJo and SoL. Part 2 is a lot worse than 4 as well. Reading 7 and 8 has made me hate the villain of the week stuff in the first 6 parts as well.</br>  <br>seven stand of the week but pretty much all of them advanced the plot or built character in some way.

None of you respect Gay Priest. This is disgusting.</br>  Just started watching 2012 Part 1 and 2<br>I like Araki's taste in music, <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Td<wbr>u4uKSZ3M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>can't wait for part 6 to get animated so people start hating gay priest<br>unfortunately that means part 4 gets animated first so everyone will hate josuke and kira</br></br>  <br>Fuck off memelord</br>  <br> start hating gay priest <br>  will hate josuke and kira <br>Why would this happen? Who would hate Josuke?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a meme faggot, it's faith.</br>  <br> hating Gay Priest <br><br>Gay priest will be arriving shortly to correct that.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh no Kars was the genius that created the mask that created vampires. He was the leader of a crusade against humanity from 2000 years ago that an entire army of humans fought to seal away. Literal first thing they do is impale human beings to feast on their blood. It's later revealed that their race had lived secluded from humanity and didn't need to go out and feed on humans. Kars killed em all, and didn't even leave a woman alive for some reason, now being guilty of genocide against two races of beings.</br>  <br><br>Part 6 isn't going to get animated and neither will Part 4. They animated the part normies care most about, they will stop now.</br></br>  It's kinda ironic that a gay priest got killed by an underage shota.  <br>Kars did nothing wrong.</br>  7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;shit&gt;the rest  <br>It was only Kars that hated humans and wanted to kill them, though.</br>  Gay priest is here now.  <br>Gay Priest might not come to a thread full of heretics.</br>  <br><br>Oh, nevermind, he's here now.</br></br>  <br>Where are you getting this shit from?</br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>vs<br> strohiem is suddenly on the plane <br> vacano ride into space but that only worked because kars decided to get off the rock, got hit by joseph's hand which shouldn't even be able to pierce his skin, get hit by several rocks which pushed him into space <br> also joseph survives the fall back to earth that should have killed him even if he landed in the water <br><br><br>OK nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  Joseph best Jojo  <br>2 is heavily overrated and it lives only on Joseph being entertaining as hell, most of the other characters are crap and it never compares to the best moments of the other parts.</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br>to give stands<br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br>getting manageble powers through the arrow. Bites the Dust isn't that powerful and can easily be defeated as shown.<br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>In a way that completely defeats all build up, requires no talent or using your brains and is nothing more than 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge". Even Jotaro used his brains to defeat Dio.<br><br>Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall<br>Kars lost because he got distracted by Joseph using his "your next line will be X" trick while volcanic rocks were clearly flying up everywhere around him<br>The surviving part I'll give you.<br><br>So on one hand we have a MC who wins through sheer luck, the same luck that has saved him his entire life.<br>On the other hand we have a lousy final battle that only happened because Araki wrote himself into a corner, forgetting that they already had a working trick against Diavolo that didn't involve pulling an arrow out of your butt.<br><br>Part 2 might be have asspulls, but they are completely in line with the main character and actually get a reasonable explanation why they worked the way they did.<br><br>Part 5 didn't have that. It had powers that were immediately abandoned the next issue because the whole frog thing with Luca removed every challenge later on, same with the slow motion brain acceleration punch of Gold Experience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You only hate part 2 because you don't want to look like an animefag</br>  <br>I don't hate any Jojo part. I just don't like part 2 as much as most of the other parts.</br>  <br> 6&gt;7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1 </br>  4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;3&gt;5&gt;1<br>Just starting part 7 now</br>  <br> 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge" <br>except the entire race for the arrow where they had to use their brains and skills to best diavolo<br><br> the same luck that has saved him his entire life. <br>Did we read the same part because joseph always got by on planning I can't think of many instances where he just got lucky.<br><br> Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall <br>doesn't change that he was shown on the grround while the plane was in the air. He also made sure Kars was stuck to the plane as it crashed and saving joseph in situation where he would be dead otherwise is no small thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Change 3 and 5 and I agree<br>Would be m8s</br></br>  7=2&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3&gt;1&gt;5  <br> complaining about GE's powers <br> while supporting the constantly broken/bent rules of hamon <br><br>Reminder<br> star finger, seeing throw your stands eyes <br> josukes constantly changed fixing abilities <br> jolyne needing to unravel her body to make stone free <br> johnny needing the corpse for his stand, steph steel knows the goldern rectangle running technique, steel ball failed because it wasn't perfectly round while nails work, <br> Everybody does it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> except the entire race for the arrow where they had to use their brains and skills to best diavolo <br>Diavolo literally did all the work for them.<br>Then it went "Hey Diavolo check this out" while Giorno stole the arrow.<br><br> Did we read the same part because joseph always got by on planning I can't think of many instances where he just got lucky. <br>The majority of his tricks relied on luck. Best example that comes to mind is where his sledgehammer sticks t his ring. Most of his tricks are not much more than quickly adapting to a sudden change of events. Deepest he ever went was against esidisi with the rope trick.<br><br> doesn't change that he was shown on the grround while the plane was in the air. <br>Actually if you look at the panel where Joseph flies over Speedwagon you can see that Stroheim was no longer there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>About a year ago I tried getting into the anime to see what all the fuss was about. I really enjoyed part 1, made it pretty far into part 2, then lost interest. I picked it up again this year, finished what little I had left in part 2, then watched Stardust. <br><br>I think Phantom Blood and Stardust are much more interesting than Battle Tendency.</br></br></br>  7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;3&gt;5  <br><br>They are. But Part 4 onwards is more interesting than Part 1 &amp; 2.</br></br>  <br>You know there's more than three parts, right?</br>  Was he an alien? Or just a dumb stand user?  <br>Swap 5 and 6 and this is perfect</br>  <br> Diavolo literally did all the work for them. <br>The only thing he did was figure out how to beat SCR they kept the arrow from him on multiple occasions using sex pistols, spice girl, the blood trick, and GE's life making power. <br><br>I still think it a bit much put joseph's stuff off as luck. Even when they are it was still planning that got him that far, there was no planning in the final bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The greatest fuck ups of hamon were the magnetism trick, that it could destroy rock in part 1, but not harm the petrified pillarmen in part 2, which resulted in Caesar's battle with Wamuu having no other possible ending that Caesar dying like a bitch.<br><br>One could say that Hamon has shown less inconsistencies than stands did.<br>Not that stands are less fun, but Araki should keep a memo of what he is doing at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What magnetism trick?</br>  <br>He would have won if he didn't try to backstab Johnny. Clearly he cares more about his ego than his country.</br>  <br> final ripple <br> dire's head using hamon on the rose </br></br>  <br><br>I can see japan not caring about 6, what with strong female protagonist and all. But 4? Seems right up japans alley.</br></br>  <br> 5 that high <br> 2 at the bottom <br>You are so full shit I can smell it through the screen</br></br></br>  <br> what with strong female protagonist and all <br>What</br></br>  <br> the blood trick <br>Which was perfect to use since it clearly worked, shows tactical insight and would have made a better death for Diavolo than Gold Experience lol instant win for me Requiem.<br><br> there was no planning in the final bit. <br>He only said to Kars that he planned it, only to immediately refute it afterwards, almost explicitly stating that luck saved his sorry behind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but part 6 was less well received partly due to American setting and female protagonist.<br><br>Aka they have shit taste. They put 5 above it..</br></br></br>  <br>Japan likes cute girls, not girls that act like men.<br> This is why Japan is infinitely superior to America in terms of social media </br></br>  <br>Isn't part 4 the most popular in Japan</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying he's a alien. <br><br>But he's a alien.</br></br></br></br>   doppio will never be a part of the gang in part five. <br> helps them out of sticky situations, bonds with them all through hijinks. <br> keeps getting mysterious "calls" though we're unsure of why <br> the guy they were looking for was with them all along </br></br></br>  <br>Is this true or are you pulling it out of your ass?</br>  <br>Its true.</br>  <br>Okay I believe you anon</br>  <br>When they fled from Tarkus using the leaves.<br><br><br>I'd consider both Zeppeli's being able to properly breathe after the shit they've gone through much more unbelievable than giving your ripple powers to someone else.<br><br> dire's head using hamon on the rose <br> not the fact that Dire's head still functioned after being frozen and nothing more than a fucking head. <br>Honestly the hamon rose was the least bizarre part of that moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most clues lead to him being an alien or some other being, but not a stand user.<br><br>even Holly could see stands and she was barely conscious of her own at the time.<br><br>If he had a stand he should have been able to see Crazy Diamond, but he didn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  Josuke &gt; Joseph &gt; jolyne &gt;johnny &gt;Giorno&gt;jotaro&gt;johnathan <br><br> kira&gt;funny&gt;priest&gt;dio&gt;Kais/pillarm<wbr>en &gt;diavolo </wbr> <br><br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh anon I didn't mean the zeppeli's final ripple.

I'm trudging through part 6 just to get to cowboys.  <br>How is it boring?</br>  why are there 3 jojo threads? cant you retards keep it together?  <br>Just stick with it.</br>  <br><br>I started reading it after watching the anime, so maybe I'm spoiled by DP's color changes and ost.</br></br>  If we post enough of Asuka-chan moot will come back to us.    <br>all the more reason to stop posting this bitch</br>        But Moot never left us.

Will I like her more if I watch it again?    Bought these a while back. Anyone know anything about em?  <br>That is clearly the Evangelion manga</br>  <br>I'd say yes, but it really depends on how you handle the second watch.<br><br><br>Looks like the manga, apparently a special collector's edition. At first I thought you had Die Sterne or something from the cover of the second, but that wasn't feeling right.

Preview of the movie novel's just been released.<br> Page 2 and 3 <br><br> Same as with WSJ excerpt, with these new editions: <br><br> * Boruto is unclear on whether or not he wants to pursue the example set by his father, or part ways with it (in terms of being a ninja). He didn’t tell his mother or father about it, since other people expected him to do so.  <br><br> * Sarada is popular among her peers lately. She’s also a bit taller than them. <br><br> * They don’t know Mitsuki’s family name. The story goes that he’s not from Konoha. He aimlessly appeared from somewhere at the Academy. Before they knew it, he had assimilated into the class. Unknown parentage, etc according to Konohamaru, who’s not surprised about his many secrets. <br><br> * Since the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu was once designated as a forbidden technique, Boruto was said to be a prodigy because he could understand it at a young age.  <br><br>-----------<br><br> Page 4 <br><br> * Everyone else isn’t surprised at his Kage Bunshin though. After all, he is the son of Uzumaki Naruto. ‘Like a falcon’s chick flying through the air’. It didn’t merit being surprised over. This irritated Boruto a lot.  <br><br> Scene Change. <br><br> * White and black spotted wild animal in an undeveloped woodland. It’s eating someone’s crops. <br><br> * Panda mission= D-rank mission.  <br><br> (This ends the extended fluff inbetween what WSJ excerpt has. ) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Page 5 <br><br> * Anyway, the Borutos swoop down with kunai in hand. He says it’s just a bear. <br><br> * Sarada is more concerned about minor details. She says it’s a bear that’s an atrocious panda. <br><br> * Boruto says it’ll be easy. ‘It’s just an ordinary, lame panda ‘dattebasa.’ <br><br> * Sarada tells Boruto 'Quit messing around. Stupid Boruto!!' <br><br> * (Something something about genus classification about Pandas and Bears. Not important) <br><br> * According to Mitsuki, they are meant to herd the kuma-panda.  <br><br> * But it roars and starts running towards Boruto and comrades.  <br><br>------------------<br><br> Page 6 <br><br> * It’s not afraid of people and weighs about one ton <br><br> * Mitsuki stretches his arm out like a rope. It’s like a lasso around it’s legs and breaks the kuma-panda’s run.  <br><br> * ‘Shanna….!?’ <br><br> * Boruto’s other two Kage-Bunshin are already beating the panda in the face though. But their mission isn’t supposed to be defeating it. (Sarada’s punch isn’t suitable for the mission in terms of going for the kill) <br><br> * It’s muzzle and eyes have a lot of nerves. So it screams, bends back, and begins to run off. They can frighten it away by inflicting pain on it. It doesn’t want to die, after all. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Page 7 <br><br> * Boruto: ‘See, wasn’t that panda easy?’ Boruto is smiling because he outwitted Sarada.  <br><br> * Boruto does not hate Sarada. Sarada always keeps an eye on Boruto since they are rivals.  <br><br> *Boruto and comrades goes after the panda.  <br><br> * Mitsuki without sarcasm: “As expected of the Nanadaime Hokage’s son, and the Yondaime Hokage’s grandchild…Eventually Boruto will also become the Hokage…?’ <br><br> * Narrator called him a subtle boy who just says whatever he feels like.  <br><br>-----------------<br><br> Page 8 <br><br> * Mitsuki is someone who can’t read the atmosphere. 『空気の読めないヤツ』Konohamaru once told him that it was important to do so. If not, then whole organization could be ruined if one doesn’t read between the lines. But at the same time, someone who says objective things without reading the atmosphere is important too. Especially for ninja… Naruto is like that. He always says honest things without sensing the atmosphere.  <br><br> * Not to say that Mitsuki can’t be more considerate. He just usually doesn’t. He always picks the optimum/most suitable solution. So he says objective observations.  <br><br> * They are able to hit a vital point on the panda.  <br><br> * Narrator--&gt; Sarada’s movements are perhaps Jounin level. Since Boruto is the son of Uzumaki Naruto, and Sarada is the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura, she won’t lose to him (in terms of pedigree/skill).  <br><br>---------------<br><br> Page 9 <br><br> いや、血の問題ではない。  <br><br> No, it’s not a question about blood.  <br><br> 忍の意地の問題である。  <br><br> It’s a question about one’s shinobi willpower. <br><br> 「火影になるのは私！！」 <br><br> ‘The one who will become Hokage is me!!’ <br><br> * And then Sarada runs after Boruto.  <br><br> /End excerpt. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Burrito have something against Pandas?</br>   Boruto the cake destroyer <br> Boruto the panda annihilator <br>it surely sounds nice</br></br>  <br> lazy fat fucks who don't breed even if you rub them up against each other until they catch on fire <br> going extinct because they're so retarded <br> everyone thinks they're so cute even though they're the most retarded species of bear out there <br>Fuck pandas.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's been quite popular nowadays among the male ninja in her same class <br>She better be.

That's hella cute<br><br> Shino </br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't even look that good. Shikadai and Inojin would make better looking girls than her.

You should’ve woke up yourself! <br> Naruto: that sounds right… <br> Hinata: Then I’ll get the cape <br> Naruto: Eh!? The other cape is not ready yet? The one with “the seventh hokage” printed on it… <br> Hinata: Yeah…sorry…it seems like…the tailor is a very stubborn man </br></br></br></br>  <br>At least Kakashi seems like he'd be lazy enough to let that happen. <br><br><br>Li'l nigga just wants to eke out an existence of his own, away from his father's shadow.

When Naruto is riding on this blimp, he goes to other villages!? <br><br> 木ノ葉隠れの里もずいぶんと変わったな… <br><br> Konohagakure Village has really changed, eh… <br><br>so do you think naruto ever took hinata for a ride in his private blimp?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no one knows hes babutos son <br> hes blonde <br> has blue eyes <br> has whisker markings <br> assuming his mom is still alive or he knows who his mom is then his mom is fucking hinata <br> somehow no one knows hes baba yagas son <br>no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is the sky blue?</br>  <br>He is telling her not to take anything to the the inauguration as then someone else will have to carry it.</br>  <br>It seems that this generation is all about dem thighs.</br>  why the fuck would boruto have whisker marks, he doesnt have kurama inside him.  <br>Naruto had whisker marks before Kurama got shoved inside him.</br>  <br>i wonder who will end up fucking her. you know, assuming some angry narusaku fag doesnt assassinate kishimoto<br><br><br>its a birth defect you bitch<br> i think naruto had them at birth, so its genetic. nothing to do with the fox </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm sure there was plenty of kurama's chakra inside his mom during conception</br>  <br>Is it too much to hope that he'll get her a new cake at the end?</br>  <br>fish cake</br>  <br>it's very likely the movie will end with happy uzumaki family</br>  <br> he doesnt have kurama inside him <br>Maybe he does? A small fragment like the Gold/Silver brothers.</br></br>  <br><br>In the original plot it was because naruto was the nine-tail's son.</br></br>  <br>More like the whiskers are a relic from the manga's pilot, in which Naruto was literally a nine tailed fox posing as a human kid.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wix<wbr>XM-Sd3X0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>new naruto trailer<br><br> naruto is gonna die <br> bolt have cho odama rasengan </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> naruto is gonna die <br>will he? it kind of looks like he knows whats bothering burrito. he will be in the shadow of naruto for the rest of his life, so he goes along with whatever the enemy is planning to give the new generation the spotlight. of course it was around this time that his generation stepped up and was recognized as one of the strongest</br></br>  <br> bolt have cho odama rasengan <br>Salad should just quit now and bend over.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't die, he just gets kidnapped and then Sauce goes rescue him.</br>  <br>No it wasn't until part 2 that his generation was recognized.</br>  <br>you didnt saw the trailer ? he is gonna die in a nuke</br>  <br>no they were recognized early on as being exceptionally good. since they were fucking genins taking on jounins and shit</br>  <br>That was just an early on theory, you can watch the new trailer and see that he dies protecting his son from an explosion.</br>  Someone finally got a hold of a decent pic of the postcard.  <br>I wonder against who is Boruto using that giant rasengan it is not in the other dimension cause boruto is using his own clothes so maybe he plans to kill Shikadai with that or the panda</br>  <br>Salad a cute.</br>  <br>hes doing carpentry. hes gonna use it to turn a screw</br>  <br>Sauce is so autistic.</br>  <br> cucking boruto with his dad <br>shes not cute. shes like her dad</br></br>  <br><br>we literally see him fighting later by the god tree.

Boruto doesn't have Naruto's jacket in the explosion, We see Momo fighting also in that tree (You think this will happen before the chunin exams? are you stupid?) and finally, we actually have the summary out.</br>  <br>There are plotholes? st seems very complete to me</br>  <br><br>We do know. The god tree is the final stage and by then Boruto has his dad's old jacket.</br></br>  <br>Clearly the jacket blows up before that point, and the world tree fight was before that.</br>  <br>But he has his hokage cloak in the protecting scene, then later he's seen in his bijuwhatever mode without the cloak and his shirt open.</br>  <br>Get glasses.</br>  <br><br>He better re-release 700, the Uzumaki family poster and the Uzumaki family portrait with shorthaired Hinata then.</br></br>    <br>Pretending to be retarded.

The poor girl had a severe and glaringly noticeable guilt complex over the death of Kanade and was not receiving ANY sort of psychological support while being throwed constantly into dangerous battles. Then she got confronted to the idea of someone taking Kanade's place and Genjuro's answer was to punch her sword and tell her "she's your new partner, deal with it bitch" which in turn made Tsubasa suicidal.<br><br>Tsubasa's recovery is much more Hibiki's achievement than his.

I don't know what it is but I can't feel the hype for this season. I want to be excited for it like I was for the first 2, but something feels off in GX. I can't put my finger on it. I will still be watching it no doubt, but this non-hype feeling for it is driving me nuts.  <br>Bikki has always treated Miku like shit</br>  <br>Ok, let's hope that in the Tsubasa screaming episode the dolls rip out Tsubasa's eggs and use them to impregnate Maria with the alchemy magic.</br>  <br>BAH GAWD KING, ANON JUST RKO'D THAT LITTLE WITCH</br>  <br>Did you remember to shut down your brain and don't think rationally how you usually do with other anime?</br>  <br>Artificial insemination is a thing<br><br>Alchemy/Phonic Gain/Magic is also an option in the Symphoverse</br></br></br>  <br>Of course. Maybe becasue I was expecting an overpowered enemy this season instead of a little girl with killer dolls, but i thought if it as a pleasant surprise. But something just feels off for me.</br>  <br> don't think rationally when watching Symphogear <br>My favorite meme.<br><br>I can't help but feel it's the slower people who get confused that always say this.<br>G had its stupid moments, but compared to other shows, it's not that egregious.</br></br></br></br></br>  When are we going to get the obligatory training episode?  <br>They have a girl thanks to iPS technology.<br><br>How would she look like?</br></br></br>  <br>Sing a song with my buddy about magic, miracles and how scientists are always lying and pissing me off.<br><br>Then use the PHONIC GAIN to erect a giant tower like the one in S1 before blasting us off into space and crashing into the sun.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Chris will be all flustered because she wants to show off in front of DMJii but she just can't because she sucks at P.E.</br>  <br>My favourite meme is the one where we pretend Chris is pure.</br>  <br> After Genjuuro dies. </br>  <br><br>I need another "Chris is not physically fit" training montage<br><br>Bonus points if she has markedly improved from G, but still lags behind even DMJii and Maria</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Fb<wbr>uhH7p4jw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, show is really good at making sense in it's own silly way. Still, it's better when people don't even try to understand it and just want to enjoy the ride rather when they try to, but somehow completely fail at it and we get second best meme, shit writing.</br>  <br>Maria is pretty fit.<br>Look at dem legs.</br></br>  <br>Well, I can't say I am hyped for the plot so far<br> Here are these enemies on a completely different level from anyone before. They just didn't do anything because they didn't feel like it! Luckily, we can upgrade our symphogears to counter their symphogear-breaking alchemy, thanks to this little girl which defected and holds the relic we need. <br><br>But the plot is hardly the reason anyone watches symphogear, anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care how people watch it, but when they say "hey, just turn your brain off" one day, and then "what the fuck this is stupid I don't understand" the next; that's just retarded.<br><br>Of course you won't understand if you turn your fucking brain off, whatever that means.</br></br></br>  <br>Fit for breeding that is.</br>    <br> Hopefully next episode since we don't need to worry about Hibiki questioning her reason for singing,and project ignite is going to go into effect the girls are going to need to do something while they wait for the repairs to finish.</br>  <br>She's fit enough alright. It's just that her zenbus drag her down.</br>  <br>You mean the others train while Hibiki is in the hospital.</br>  <br>I want to see Tsubasa and Maria trying during the training the famous "Chris crotch into Hibiki face" move.<br><br>Just imagine Maria pushing her smelly crotch into blushing Tsubasa face, or Tsubasa blushing trying to push her sword in one decisive move into Maria who wasn't ready to receive it.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell me those are sakura petals on her skin.</br>  <br>A  sword  bit her.</br>  <br>It's cowpox.<br>Because she has saggy lardbags.</br></br>  You see that nigga turnin<br><br>You feel the relic burnin<br><br>Nigga now you learnin</br></br></br></br>  <br> Her shorts are still on and so is the front of the shirt . She was still wearing Gungnir when she fell so she'll shown to be just fine next episode.</br>  <br>I just assumed those are two different kind of retards. I hope that's the case.</br>  <br>She was completely naked in the following shot when Miku rushed over to her</br>  <br>Hibiki was kinda cool here again for a minute or two before she got turned into a vegetable</br>  <br>That was just for the viewers</br>   tfw no brutal gungnir onee-chan   <br>Why is she so manly?</br>  <br>Log.</br>  I wanna see a Symphogear made from Pandora's Box. it'd be equivalent to Salior Saturn as the Symphogear of destruction.   inb4 the damage on gungnir was so severe it cracked open a layer of seal that's been preventing ZENRYOUKU SENKAI   <br>I want all the Gungnirs as my family<br><br>Maria onee-san<br>Hibiki daughteru<br> Kanade Waifu </br></br></br></br></br>  So how long do you think it took for someone to offer Maria a handkerchief .  <br>Tsubasa pls</br>  <br> Not licking it off. </br>  <br>Are her cat ears getting bigger?</br>  <br>Probably a bit, I wouldn't approach a person with strawberry jam on her face walking casually.</br>  <br>Why contain it?</br>  <br>Hair grows.</br>  Why is Hibiki such a bitch  <br>She went full retard. Maria saved her ass and she went all muh Gungnir, she better apologize later.</br>  <br>She apologized immediately afterwards, but Hibiki very much went full retard.</br>  <br>I love how she was JAMing the entire time. Made the whole scene look incredibly awkward</br>  <br>She apologized right away. Hibiki feels useless when she can't fight so when Maria took the Gungnir and used it she panicked and thought she might get replaced.</br>    <br> I don't want to fight <br> but if I can't fight I get cranky <br><br>How does Miku tolerate this girl</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I have you and your uncle in my family Tsurugi-san</br>  <br>Hibiki's not having a good battle record this season</br>  <br>But no blood.</br>  I almost forgot there were other dolls  <br>Hibiki is good in bed and that's enough for Miku.</br>  <br>S'cool.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I'm still wondering how you people fail to understand her feelings, her character, her story and history, and her motivations.<br>It's like you don't care about characters at all apart from using them for your masturbation fantasies.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only 157 posts in <br>I think this is a new record.</br></br>  <br>bait</br>  <br>Miku is the real villain this season, I hope she doesn't cheer for the other girls.</br>  <br>My fucking nigga.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they had to make her look vulnerable, if it was another season of punching everything to death and arm regeneration it'd be superman syndrome.<br>  There was not a man watching that last fight who expected Hibiki to lose straight after TAKANRE, my outlook on life was shifted. </br></br>    <br>If I were Sally I would look for Anne because clearly that bitch ran off with my ball, I saw her eyeing it and now she's no where to be found.</br>  <br>    There was not a man watching that last fight who expected Hibiki to lose straight after TAKANRE, my outlook on life was shifted. <br><br>Are you kidding? It was obvious the moment she started apparently curbstomping the strongest member of a group who are all suppose to be stronger than the current Gears.</br></br></br>  DESS a dumb.  <br>I get the feeling she's gonna blame herself a lot after this.</br>  <br> my precious </br>  <br>It will be daijoubu.</br>  <br>The only thing Miku has to blame herself for is being friends with Hibiki.</br>    I really hope we start getting some conflicts where it at least seems like the outcome hasn't been decided in at advance. I want to feel tension from the battles and schemes unfolding, not at wondering how depressed the cast are going to be after they're hospitalized from the next categorical loss.  <br>why is gary so best doll?<br><br>the more I see her the more I like her</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to shit on Nanoha threads.<br><br> Oh wait. </br></br></br>    GARIE IS CUTE<br><br>CUTE</br></br>  <br> who are all suppose to be stronger than the current Gears <br>Yeah about that. I credit them as be very effective against Gears but i will hold my opinion on if they're stronger. Gears have punched/blasted chunks of the moon, scalped mountains and German Suplexed a Space Shuttle. Nothing the Autoscorers have done come even close. They only perceived advantage so far is being able to decompose Gears which yeah, make them really dangerous but not necessarily "stronger".</br></br>  <br>You're saying you know that Hibiki was going to lose straight after the peak of her song?<br>I knew there had to be some trickery or something that'd make her lose, it was michas first fight and it's only ep 4, but I thought there was gonna be more too it than that<br>  It was great though I'm not complaining, I was just looking forward to some serious phonic gain </br></br></br>  <br>Time to fap</br>  I just realized i missed a fuckhuge thread yesterday because I forgot horrible subs caught up and aired already.  <br>Have you not been watching?</br>  <br> There won't be any decent porn of the autoscorers </br>  <br>They also seem to be immune to Gear attacks. Every time a Gear attacked a doll so far the doll sustained zero damage.</br>  <br>I was about to make a snark comment about fapping to dolls but then i remember the anons who posses figures. This is weird.</br>  <br>Yesterday was insane. Two 600+ threads and a 1200+ thread, on an already crazy episode</br>   Garie Tuman <br> Micha Jawkan <br> Phara Suyuf <br> Leiur Darahim <br><br>I was worried they'd suck, but it turned out the alchemists side are so good they deserve their own series. I enjoy seeing them more than the main cast.<br><br>Also Phara and Leiur can go die for all I care near the end of the season, but damn Garie and Micha better stay alive, join the main cast, and become maid or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Can someone talented make a 'Hype thrusters activate' gif/webm with michas hair rockets firing up    tfw tsubasa was all "muh emotionless bladed deathseeker philosophy" after kanade died <br> Tsubasa tries to suicide bomb Chris <br> can't even do that right.jpg <br> Spirit Kanade tells her to cut that shit out <br> She stops beings a bitch to hibiki <br> I start to like her again <br><br>Has this happened to anyone else yet? also i started watching yesterday and im on ep8 now does it get better in the later season? also Miku a shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah but that seems more them being able to debilitate the Gears attacks rather than being stronger than those. The moment one of them lifts a building or cut a city in half i'll recognize their strenght.<br><br>So far they only have "Gear immunity" as their main feature. The moment the girls can bypass that restriction the dolls will get curbstomped unless they show some real strength.<br><br>I wonder when some of them will lift a building or cut an entire stadium in half.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also Phara and Leiur can go die for all I care near the end of the season, but damn Garie and Micha better stay alive <br>This.<br>Garie and Micha &gt; old hags</br></br></br>  <br>She's basically Nui with red hair.</br>  <br>Literally everyone. Also don't be mean to Miku.</br>  <br>Going by Model# Micha is the oldest.</br>  <br>Hey, thats mean</br>  <br>Throw Genjuro at them. Genjuro &gt; Autoscorers &gt; Geahs &gt; Noise &gt; Genjuro</br>  <br> The moment one of them lifts a building i'll recognize their strenght <br>You mean throwing around multiple boats isn't enough? If not, I am sure they can do more.</br></br>  <br>In looks maybe, but Gary got the personality.</br>   Garie tries to suck a geah's memory <br> she resists and fights back <br> kissu battle with implied tongue action </br></br>  <br>Hibiki also needs Spirit Kanade to appear and tells her to stop being a whiny bitch.</br>  <br>They're murderers, and worse, Garie's a genuinely horrible bitch. I don't see her surviving; she'll probably make herself the sacrifice to summon her true master or whatever it is she's plotting after Hibiki thwarts her.</br>  <br>it's not the age that matters, it's the appearance</br>  <br> Genjuro &gt; Autoscorers &gt; Geahs &gt; Noise &gt; Genjuro </br>  <br>That was actually impressive but that was a summon isn't? I'm amused who did it and if they can summon more stuff.<br><br>Still not close to scalping mountains and wrestling spacecraft but it's a start.</br></br></br>  <br>why is Spirit Kanade so based other than y'know being a spirit</br>  So we all know elf9 is going to fuck everyones shit up with evil swords right?<br>She's bad guys.</br>  WHY ISN'T MIKU FUCKING HIBIKI EVERY FUCKING NIGHT<br><br>THE GIRL FUCKING LOVES FISTS</br></br>  <br>It's not her fault, her memories were manipulated by Carol, just like Carol's are being manipulated by Garie.</br>  <br>She's either bad or unknowingly helping Carol, since the memories and knowledge given to her is limited to whatever Carol deemed necessary.</br>  <br>Elf9 is a good girl.</br>  <br>Samefagging a bit, if you notice none of the Gears was desicively defeated in combat by any of the autoscorers.<br><br> Chris &amp; Tsubasa got decomposed. <br> Maria suffered Sync problems the whole fight. <br> Hibiki got double teamed and decomposed. <br><br>Those dolls will be utterly screwed once the girls get in form to fight fairly with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if they can summon more stuff. <br>Probably not. The "summon" was Leiur's little sister that's mentioned in the official site.</br></br>  <br>She is being manipulated and her story arc for the next of the season will be about trying to redeem herself.</br>  <br>They aren't trying to kill them, or even to hurt them much. They want them alive with broken gears.</br>   post yfw dolls were scripted to die before the making of this show <br> post yfw huge popularity is making the studio reconsidering it <br> post yfw the studio solved this by having the scorers' memory reformatted when Carol is befriended <br> post yfw dolls ended up being enrolled to Biki's school and join the SONG ranks <br> post yfw they still retain their combat strength and personality enough to act as reinforcement and fighting alongside their respective GEAH users against a bigger threat next season <br> post yfw the SoL part will also feature them picking fights and bullying other main cast <br><br> I just want to dream ;______; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not about power levels, it's about the arms race of weapon development.<br><br>Gears were developed as anti-Noise weapons. Conventional forces get slaughtered because their attacks can't touch the Noise, while the Noise just have to touch them to carbonize them. While powerful in other ways, the special trait of Gears is to counter those two advantages. That's why they blow through Noise like they were nothing.<br><br>From all indications, the Autoscorers and Alch-Noise were developed as anti-Gear weapons. Alch-Noise have their focus shifted from carbonizing organic to inorganic materials; that's why they do more terrain damage and can disrupt the Gears themselves. Autoscorers are just built from the ground up to combat Gears. They're agile, adaptable, and don't have any of the weaknesses Gears were made to exploit.<br><br>Now the next step is to install Ignite upgrades on the Gears so that they're better equipped to deal with the new opponent. Of course, that might be a trap, but it's still the logical next step.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Poor Maria. <br>It's hard to be a 33 year old adult woman in a cast full of teens.</br>  <br>Still the "strongest" of the dolls ahd to be bailed out from Hibiki's fists (a stressed/confused Hibiki i must add). Not a good omen for them once their anti-Gear tricks stop working.</br>  <br>Where do the dolls fall into this arms race scheme?</br>  <br>She didn't actually seem to be hurt by that punch.</br>  <br>The autoscorers are inhuman bakemonos who have killed hundreds of people. They won't get off scot-free.</br>  <br> 33 <br>wat</br></br>  <br>But she's 21.</br>   bitch <br> noun <br> slang <br><br> a malicious, unpleasant, selfish person, especially a woman. </br></br></br></br>   tfw no perplexed zenbu.gif   Miracles!  did chris have another gear ordid nehustan change forms?  <br>ya just like Vers did, and he tried to destroy the Earth too<br><br>The autoscorers have the benefit of being (cute) girls in addition of that, they'll live</br></br></br>  <br>I covered that. Dolls = Autoscorers.</br>  <br>21 in cat years.</br>  <br>She was just borrowing Nehushtan, Ichaival is her own gear.</br>  <br> muh hibiki diddu nuffin rong </br>  <br>So, 2 years old?</br>  <br>Point remains she was unable to fight back the rampage and has to be assisted to finish the fight quickly. the other dolls also weren't able to get any upper advantage combat wise until they summoned the Alche-Noise.<br><br>So far i'm having trouble buying the suppossed superiority of the dolls in a fight. But you're correct on that it's still early to give a judgement. I want the dolls to do some truly impressive shit that justify them being feasible rivals for the Gears in combat. They're durable and can nullify Gears to some degree but by themselves they don't seem very strong in comparison.<br><br>As some other anon said, judging only by what's shown any of the dolls would be utterly obliterated by Genjuro in front combat. The guy punched a meteor for god's sake. Calling a "sister" that lifts boats is child's play compared to that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> girls </br>    <br> Autoscorers <br> Girls <br><br>They're dolls anon. It's entirely justified to destroy them (destroy, not kill as they aren't alive to begin with).</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that matters when you're going to fist it anyway </br>  <br>You said it Crack-kun<br>Hibiki a perfect</br></br>     mfw Genjuro is literally Akuma from street figter <br><br>god fucking dammit</br></br>  JAM friends.  <br>Which face would you like anon, I'll help, are you angry?</br>  <br>Garie's near-instant dislocation was impressive. If you consider Leiur's imouto as one her battle assets that's pretty impressive too.</br>    <br>a happy face, if you would my fellow anon</br>  <br> title of the episode was Gungnir Once Again <br> people were speculating whether it meant that Maria would put on the Gungnir again or that Hibiki would transform again <br> it was both </br></br></br>  <br>Maria's popularity sure seems on the rise this season. I'm totally okay with that.<br><br>(It helps she passed the cursed Relic of Uselessness off to Hibiki and can be cool again.)</br></br></br>  <br>Since the matchup is obviously going to be<br>Garie vs Maria<br>Micha vs Kiri-Shirabe<br>Phara vs Sword<br>Leiur vs Chris<br>Carol vs Biki<br><br>does this means<br><br>wait<br><br>guys<br><br>what if<br><br>guys<br><br>what if<br><br>Leiur imouto vs motherfuckin' Genjurou?!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Happy enough?</br>  <br>But she was cool and useful with the same Gungnir just this episode.</br>  <br>Agreed. Kanade really had her bitch under control.<br><br>Is Kanade the manliest geah in history? I personally believe she would out-manly Bikkie too.</br></br></br>  <br>You did it anon. You now overloaded my hype gear. I don't believe it will happen, but I want it so fucking mcuh.</br>  <br>Why do you Maria fans feel the costant need to shit on other characters when talking about her?

They just didn't do anything because they didn't feel like it! Luckily, we can upgrade our symphogears to counter their symphogear-breaking alchemy, thanks to this little girl which defected and holds the relic we need. <br> But the plot is hardly the reason anyone watches symphogear, anyway. <br><br>That's like my tokusatsu shows!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> flat <br>81/57/83<br>She's not flat!</br></br></br>  <br>My manboobs beat her girlboobs by 3cm, kek.<br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>True, but it's a relative measure. If I want cute vulnerable sexual, Chris does it better. A lot of Maria's appeal for me is that she's the All Woman of the cast (by Symphogear standards).</br>  <br>Manufactured hype is about at old is "fun is a buzzword" in   the Fightan Game Community  <br>  Truly, video games are suffering </br></br>  <br><br>Taking every chance you get in an interview or sound byte to doom and gloom about how the gear users are in danger of losing, and deliberately dropping hints about the dreaded episode 7 everywhere, is absolutely manufacturing something. Sorry your heads are too full of other /a/ memes to see what I'm saying just because I said "manufactured hype.'<br><br>"People said I crossed a line." - Kaneko "The Grim Reaper" Akifumi</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the boobs on your chest that matter, anon, it's the boobs in your heart.</br>  <br>All of the plot and everything else in the anime is manufactured, it's an artificial creation from the start. Of course the hype is manufactured. It's the redundancy that makes the term meaningless.</br>  <br> mamu mia.webm <br> not mamaria.webm </br></br>  How does one become this cool  <br>why is the fighting game community so shit compared to the other communities</br>  <br> I guess you don't play much dota </br>  <br>Why did her bike randomly malfunction like that?</br>  <br>But that's exactly what hype is, right?

"Hype" describes the audience's anticipation or reaction. I'd say it's generated "naturally" by PVs and promo materials. In this case there are these specific perceptions they're trying to instill in the audience, to the point that people are repeating  episode 7  like meme and biting their nails over nothing when obviously all the gear users are going to survive.<br><br><br>Bike-kun #1738  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else here enjoying GX more than the first two seasons?<br><br>I feel like I shouldn't but everything is just so hype. Not to say I don't love the first two seasons though.<br><br> This is quite possibly because I didn't watch the first two as they were airing. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad, when it comes to older, forceful women Tsubasa is the sub in bed.</br>  <br>I actually like first season more. S2 was an absolute piece of turd smeared with horse diarrhea. S3 looks promising. I personally watched all seasons while airing.</br>  <br> grown up man voiced by nana in a spanish speaking country. <br>why do i want this?</br></br>  <br>I was enjoying the idea of Tsubasa being the dom despite being younger very much, but I guess the anime isn't going for it.</br>  <br> PVs and promo materials <br>I don't believe interviews and other types of publicity are any "less natural". They are all intentional actions by the producers aimed at the viewers with the intent to increase their expectations for the upcoming episodes. Some are aimed at more hardcore fans and some are aimed at wider audiences, but they're the same in nature.<br><br>Also, pretty much every anime does this sort of publicity. It's the standard, Symphogear is not exceptional in that regard. People become extremely hyped with Symphogear because there have been two seasons and in general their hype has always been rewarded with loads of fun and excitement. People just really like the show. That's a good reason to be hyped as far as I'm concerned.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, yeah. Ep 7 is now a meme, but it's not the worst we have. And it's not like I'm hyped about Ep 5 because of it. Sure, I'm curious what will happen, but waiting for next episode seems to be that normal kind of hype, and it's what I feel right now.</br>  <br>S1 had more of a soul and I can't bring myself to like Carol and the dolls anywhere near as much as the FIS girls, but beyond that, GX on average is pretty close to matching S1's peak levels so far.</br>  <br>My problem's not whether the "hype" is real or manufactured or whatever, it's there seems to be no give-and-take in the show's conflicts. Everything effortlessly going the villain's way until the grand finale is just as unengaging as the opposite. I want to feel that the battles and other conflicts actually matter, not that they're just obligatory setup for suffering scenes.</br>  will her next character CD feature another enka song?<br><br>it fucking better</br></br>  <br>She's can be the dominant one outside the bedroom.</br>  <br>First season is still the best since the threat of characters being killed off seemed very real and angsty Chris and Tsubasa were great. <br><br>GX is way better than season 2 though.</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.symphogear-gx.com/produc<wbr>ts/GXcharactersong03.php<br> 02. 空へ… <br> Into the sky... <br>Sounds like some sad ballad or something</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I don't think Carol will keep having the upper hand for long though. She might, of course, but we're still at episode 4, it's too soon to be making that sort of critique.</br>   That whistling <br><br>I want to become the little bitch of a person like that.</br></br>  <br> Everything effortlessly going the villain's way <br>You're basing that off of the first 4 episodes in a season where the antagonists are supposed to start with a big advantage.<br><br>What does "actually matter" even mean to you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode seven is being sold as a huge suffering explosion, and we also have very strong suspicions that the supposed "upgrades" are yet again part of her plan all along, so even if they seem to give Chris and Tsubasa an advantage, it'll end up as a more long-term version of the water clone "We were just pretending you were winning!".</br>  <br>Suffering doesn't necessarily imply everything will go according to Carol's plan. See episodes 11 and 12 of S1 where they drove suffering to the max by having Chris and Tsubasa 'sacrifice' themselves to successfully stop Fine's big plan.</br>   mfw the only way for Tsubasa and Chris to use their gears is to become hybrids like Bikkie was in season one.  <br><br>That would be an actual fucking plot twist. Forcing Tsubasa and Chris to have to have relic shards in them to even attempt to get shit done.</br></br>  <br>Everyone gets the new pendants though.</br>  <br>Episode 4 tells us that? Since I can't into moon I haven't seen episode 4 yet. I have to wait for subs like a peasant.</br>  <br> Everyone goes berserk all according to Carol's plan <br> Everyone but Bikki <br> "Why won't you turn like them?" <br> Bikki shrugs as if berserk mode is any relevant to her anymore and does some speech about how everyone always helped her out during those times and now it's her turn to turn the favor <br> She fistes everyone </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But subs are already out.</br>  <br>The OP does.  Admittedly, there is still the possibility of the OP being a bait&amp;switch, but we know which possibility is more likely at the moment. </br>  <br>Wait what. Fuck. Can I be a spoonfeeding faggot and ask for where to find them? I just wait for  memecartel </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>These are the official website chara designs. Everyone has the pendants with the new wing design in them.<br> NEW GEARCONVERTER MODEL </br></br>  <br> Implying they have budget for 2 OPs </br>  <br>That would be sweet. It would help Bikkie's maturity majorly. <br><br><br>I'd put money on it not being a bait and switch. Now that I think about it, I can't even remember GX's OP. I'm terrible at this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're in nyaa like every other sub out there.</br>  <br>CR is simulcasting. That is all the info you should need.</br>   not trusting Genjuuro to only give the girls safe gear teach, or, if there is a danger, being up front and telling them about it <br>Whatever the shocking twist behind the new relics are, eventually they'll be harassed properly and help the gears win.</br>  <br><br>Nice timing.</br></br>  <br>The current OP feels very cheap and Exterminate really doesn't suit it, so I'm not ruling it out just yet.</br>  <br> harassed properly <br>D-don't touch Dainsleif-chan there!</br></br>  <br>That the tension lies in how the battles or other conflicts go, not in how badly the characters will be fucked up after they lose. So far, every single thing they've done except for Hibiki refusing to fight has been playing straight into their hands, and with the obviously-a-trap "upgrade" that doesn't look set to change any time soon. Losing is fine, but when it goes on for half the series, at least throw some kind of bone towards pretending that there are two sides to the fight.</br>   Just saw doctor-chan get shot <br><br>NOOOOOO!!!!!<br><br><br>Yeah, i agree. That shit gets annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers. I apologize for being useless.</br>  <br> trusting Genjuuro to only give the girls safe gear tech <br>He allowed this to happen</br></br>  <br>Blast my tohou music</br>  So far Carol's plan involved just destroying gears, so it would be hard to really mess with them. And even so we got it twice (Bikkie's problems and Maria being so useless it was actually helpful). I don't think everything will go according to keikaku just because girls will get their gears upgraded. Also, we still have DMJii, they probably won't get ignite as soon as other girls.  <br><br> Type X-1 <br> Model PR <br><br> Dansleif the ratio 10.23% </br></br></br></br></br>   purpose is to defeat symphogears <br> symphogears stop working and the hero is extermely vunerable <br> i cant fight like this, i'll come back when your powers return <br><br>why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her plan is pretty obviously to force them to use the cursed sword.</br>  <br>Because otherwise they would be no story. Why do you have to be so autistic? If you want good writing go read a book, nerd.</br>  <br>Because the purpose is to break the gears, not the users.</br>  <br> playing straight into their hands <br>Nothing other than that is even supposed to be happening. We can see that it's a trap, but the characters currently only see it as a necessary risk because they are not doubting Elfnein or any of the current events in the slightest.<br><br> at least throw some kind of bone towards pretending that there are two sides to the fight <br>It's supposed to be onesided right now though. If your first sentence is anything to go by, you may be looking for the wrong things in the first place in these 4 episodes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They need to break the gears but leaves the Geahs alive so that 9/11-kun can help upgrade the relics with Dainsleif and make them all go berserk while singing the song to end the world</br>  <br> modes 1 to 4 </br>  <br>but then the gears get fixed and the bad guys get btfo??? i dont see how this story could get anymore interesting <br><br>my autism flares up when plot holes suddenly appear in a good story</br></br></br>  <br>You don't get away with writing an unengaging conflict by saying "but it's supposed to be unengaging".<br><br>Of course they're only playing into her hands because they don't realize they're playing into her hands. Why on earth else would they? That doesn't change the fact that an effortless conflict where you never think one side has a hope even of a minor victory, even one they don't end up winning, is neither meaningful nor interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>The gears are getting fixed with the shards of an evil sword. If you don't see how this is going to develop you are blind.</br>  <br> symphogeah <br> good story </br></br>  <br>because they need the power of the gears</br>  <br>THAT'S WHY PEOPLE SAY ELF9 IS A FILTHY SPY THAT IS GOING TO MESS WITH THE GEAHS<br><br>REMOVE THE LOLI SCUM</br></br></br>  <br> but then the gears get fixed <br>With a magic demon sword that will obviously corrupt the users and fuck up things big time</br></br>  <br> ??? </br>   Custodians  when?  <br> no hole down there <br> loli </br></br>  <br>but is there possibility of a twist gainax ending as a result of the evil sword?</br>  <br> You don't get away with writing an unengaging conflict by saying "but it's supposed to be unengaging". <br>Yes you do, when barely a third of the season has elapsed. Engagement is down to each particular viewer, and if underdog fightbacks where victories and defeats are difficult to guess are the only way for such plots to be interesting to you then you're watching the wrong series.</br></br>  <br>symphogear GX!</br>  <br>Just because the Dainsleif is part of Carol's plan it doesn't men she's not taking any risks though. Like some anon said, once the gears become able to counter the Alca-Noise and the dolls they will probably have the upper hand in any fight. Carol's moves will be severely restricted. Even if her plan accounts for that, it's still risky.<br><br>And again, it's only episode 4, that's not even one third of the show. We're clearly done with the first big arc and we have no clue how things are going to develop now.</br></br></br>  <br>she looks better with blood oozing from her</br>  <br>I want to lick it off.</br>  Hibiki was messing up Carol's plans for two episodes, then Maria did it too. Hibiki's fight against Micha wasn't really that much of sure lose until lol Gary was there too! I don't really feel like villains have it too easy.  <br> if underdog fightbacks where victories and defeats are difficult to guess are the only way for such plots to be interesting to you then you're watching the wrong series. <br>It's a battle series, and one with two previous seasons with with tense, exciting battles. I hardly think Symphogear is the kind of series where I ought to be expecting tension-free conflict. I never mentioned "underdog fightbacks", merely the idea of there being some point in showing the fight unfold or sinister plot develop rather than just a card saying "they win again, as you already know".</br></br>  <br>One step of the plan working doesn't imply the next step also will.</br>  <br>It's a pretty safe bet so long as it's not explained on-screen, which probably won't be until it's already taken effect.</br>  <br>Sounds more like the title of an SoL OVA.</br>  <br>it is.</br>  <br>My point is something will have to go not according to plan eventually.</br>  <br>Sympho SoL OVA series, Drama CD and 4koma spinoffs where!</br>  <br>Episode 4 had two exciting fights with unpredictable outcomes.</br>   girls get possessed because of Dainsleif <br> their songs become a corrupted mess <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UH4<wbr>4Z46hcuU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>If you honestly thought that things were going well and some measure of victory might be within grasp even when everyone started relaxing and calling her unbeatable, I don't know what to tell you.</br>  <br>If we have to borrow from that franchise I'd like it more in the style of https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bsa<wbr>x70r7dlw</wbr>  [ ] , with the "real" song desperately trying to get out of the KILL CRUSH DESTROY one that's drowning it.<br>That song is a mess but god I love it.</br></br>  Reminder that Gungnir got shattered partly, while Ame no Habakiri only got a few cracks, and Ichaival wasn't harmed at all on the outside.  S1: I stole Kanade's geah, so let me take her place<br>S2: I lost Kanade's geah, so give me yours Maria<br>S3: How dare you touch my geah, Maria<br>S4:???<br> S5: Profit <br><br><br>More Gungnir shards in Biki's chest, my body is ready.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surge tracks were all pretty great. My favourite is probably Lxa Ti-cia.<br>Nothing beats KOWARERO KOWARE KOWARE KOWARETEYUKE in terms of spookyness though.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_sg<wbr>RKBot5bs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, but hopefully that will start to happen earlier than as a last-minute powerup at the climax. I can't stand totally unfazeable characters, especially when they pull the whole I-was-only-losing-to-manipulate-you<wbr> shit, which seems pretty much guaranteed any time the Ignite System is used prior to its true purpose being revealed.</wbr></br>  <br><br>Sorry, she's physically unharmed.<br>But unlike with Tsubasa and Chris there was this huge explosion when Gungnir shattered that sent Hibiki into a state of shock.<br>So the damage is certainly worse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Resorting to putting words in my mouth already? I thought we were actually talking to each other here, not calling each other names.<br><br>It's not just a matter of Hibiki defeating Micha or not. There's no way you could have said with confidence that the fight would end with a broken Gungnir and a broken Hibiki when you were watching it and that's the whole thrill of it.<br><br>You're still complaining about how they deal with the overall plot when they have just showed us the first chapter in the story. Sure you can tell that it's going to be a story where the heroes are initially pushed against a corner and will eventually turn the game, but there's still so much to happen it's impossible to tell when the tables will turn or how many times they will turn. I honestly don't understand what your problem is with the way they're carrying the plot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stole <br>But that's not what happend.<br> S2 <br>Maria was afraid to use it.<br> S3 <br>Maria was unable to use it well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> partly  <br>Closer to entirely,and that energy release is probably really bad.</br></br>  <br> Gungnir is fucked <br> Repairs takes until episode 8 <br> Miku doesn't want bikki to go again </br></br></br>  <br>Pendants are not shards.<br>Pendants are not shards.<br>Pendants are not shards.</br></br></br>  <br><br>As you can see in  the main body of Gungnir is still there.</br></br>  <br>I love the idea of a psychopath Bikki who's secretly going more bonkers each season until it spills over and no one noticing until it's too late.<br> Zerker Bikki was her alter ego </br></br>  <br><br>I'm waiting for more material before making my final judgement.<br><br>Still, GX Episode 1 &gt; G Episode 1 &gt; S1 EP1<br><br>GX looks like it has potential to beat G in every way, but the way Hibiki couldn't sing for roughly one episode was kind of awkwardly rushed. Felt like it should have taken more then a tearful 'break' Hibiki. Kirika gave her shit in G and Hibiki still fought to protect lives.<br><br>Still, I'm glad we're over that hump for now and it'll serve as a background for the real meat of the drama coming up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maria was unable to use it well. <br>Not as unable. But it was Hibiki’s gear, Maria gave it to her at the end of G. You don’t just take back presents.</br></br>  <br>"closer"</br>  <br> But that's not what happend. <br>Did you miss the part in S1E1 where Hibiki uses her gravitational powers to rip shards of Gungnir right off of Kanade's chest, and overshoot them into her own chest?<br><br><br> Anything better than S1E1 <br>Are you implying that anything in Symphogear is better than this moment? Remember back to when you first saw this anon. Remember how you felt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you my soul and all of my money that by episode 8 the status quo will be completely different from now and we'll still have one third of the story ahead of us.</br>  <br>She wasn't taking it though. She just temporarily used it to save their lives. Hibiki just went crazy from the thought of losing her power.</br>  <br><br>You're aware it was an emergency and Hibiki and her friends almost got disintegrated by the Alcanoise?</br></br>  <br>Speaking of Surge, the current GX events kinda remind me of that part of Ion's genometrics where, after a game and a half worth of her being the sweetest person in the world, you get to meet all her repressed issues and it's NOT pretty.<br><br><br>Maybe they can sing her the school anthem again? That worked last time</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which doujin was that page from?</br>  <br><br>Of course, but Hibiki’s reaction is not as unjustified as you make it out to be. Maria even thought about just keeping it moments before, it’s not as if Hibiki is paranoid.</br></br>  <br>The end of S1E12 was orders of magnitude more hype than that.</br>  <br> Did you miss the part in S1E1 where Hibiki uses her gravitational powers <br><br>Anon pls.</br></br></br>  <br> There's no way you could have said with confidence that the fight would end with a broken Gungnir and a broken Hibiki when you were watching it and that's the whole thrill of it. <br><br>It's obviously impossible to predict the exact mechanics of it, but she was very, very clearly set up to be completely and totally beaten. But it's not just about the battle, it's about the villains being perfectly in control of virtually every aspect of the grander conflict. Even when all the protagonists are trying to do is run away after losing, that was all part of their plan as well. Seeing everything go perfectly without even a hint of effort is dull.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess you must have missed it. It was pretty clear to me.<br><br>All of that episode was way too hype, but I supposed my statement remains true for Episode 1s.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a pixiv thing from the ep 10 of G.</br>  <br> Maria even thought about just keeping it moments before <br>No, she regretted that she gave it away, that's a different thing. She knows it's Hibiki's power.<br><br>Also Hibiki's reaction is understandable not because of Maria but because of her own emotional troubles. She's afraid of her power, of Gungnir, unable to sing, yet equally afraid of losing it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you talking shit about Hibiki?</br></br>  <br><br> Remember back to when you first saw this anon. Remember how you felt. <br><br>Yeah, that moment was like 'what the hell?' in the middle of a pretty so/so introduction to the show. I just think episode 1 both G and GX set the bars high. GX episode 1 has amazing pacing to get you hyped for everything else. It's almost perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, what are you going to do about, Miku?

I think it'd probably make her  better .</br>  <br>Saying it's dull right now is just a personal impression, which apparently most people disagree based on the reception GX is having. I don't think it's reasonable to say that the villains can't have the situation under their control for the story to be enjoyable. I'm perfectly fine with it if the story as a whole turns out to be interesting and exciting. So far the story has got me in the expectation for many things while also having many likeable characters and good developments being hinted for them so. I really don't see a reason to complain just because the plot follows this or that story telling convention.</br>  <br>She's fine the way she is.</br>  <br>Data for for two episodes plus extras is around 20 GB, disc capacity is 25GB.</br>  <br>Is this for real?</br>  <br>Only if Nanjo uses her cool voice when Shirabe is possessed by Fine.</br>  <br>I agree that the story so far is fine and the characters too. Only the villains goal seems very bland. "Emo girl wants to destroy the world." That is a bit too boring for Symphogear. Fine wanted to blow up the moon to speak to god, FIS simply save the world and Vert to be the last action hero.

I don't see that as emo. Also, there's something extremely fishy about how she thinks destroying the word is the will her father entrusted to her when his last words were for her to know the word, not destroy it.

It pisses me off people don't like vento aureo just because shitty translation, I'm Italian and we got the official translated manga and is one of the best parts, the ending is the only bad thing but the characters and the fights are the best.  I really liked Diego, because it felt like he was his own character, rather than DIO on a horse. He was a rival to Johny and Gyro, but not in a "Good vs. Evil" sense like the original DIO and Joestars, he was just a rival set out to win the race and get the corpse.<br>He wasn't necessarily a bad guy, just an asshole who sometimes went too far (Like with Wekapipo)<br><br>But then Diego 2 Za Warudo came along and was literally DIO on a horse. I know that was on purpose, but come the fuck on.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked both Diegos</br>  <br>To be honest, I did like how much more ruthless Diego 2 was, and how surprisingly different he was from the original.</br>  <br>Diego's rivalry with Johnny felt kinda forced, but they still played off his character super well. Alt Diego was cheesy and shoehorned though, but that made Diego himself feel a bit better because of it.<br><br>Still have no idea why HorseDIO just went along with locking away the corpse though.</br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't figure it out either. All I can come up with is that doing so made the corpse his? I think? I don't know.</br>  Where do I download the Part 5 from coloured adventure?

Her stand allows her to control earth and she's the one responsible for the Wall Eyes. She's an agent of the CIA and is trying to uncover the corpse's teeth, which somehow got lost when Johnny brought it to Morioh so she can bring them back to America and complete the corpse. The teeth are buried in the areas with the Wall Eyes, cause people who go close to them to get bitten. She can't dig them out, so she's looking for another method to get in. The rockmen are the result of a failed experiment to get them out conducted in the 90's where she created humans made of stone with her stand and someone else used their own stand to give life to them.<br>She will use the ground in the Higashitakas' backyard to fuse herself with this universe's Kosaku Kawajiri and gain his stand power to rewind to a certain point in time, but it only works in areas whose earth has been affected by her original stand power. This way, she hopes to bring those areas back to the day of the 2011 tsunami and use the water's force to dig the teeth out, regardless of collateral damage.<br><br>Don't ask me how I know this.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm totally okay with this.</br>  think josuke ever met his secret admirer for love?  <br>How come Kawajiri has a Stand in this universe then?</br>  <br>How do you know that, though?</br>  <br>Got bitten by a Wall Eye.<br>She knows of the stand abilities of everyone in Morioh and she uses him as a last resort by using her earth powers to bury herself with him.<br>She takes measures to ensure the resulting person will know who they are and what they have to do.</br></br></br>  <br>Its almost one and i'm too tired to keep reading, but Uni starts on monday, want to get it finished beforehand</br>  <br>Wait a minute.

Too bad the full version is bad  <br>Is it?</br>  <br>Shit show, shit OP, shit ED,</br>  <br>Yeah but the ED album contains the TV version as well</br>  because youre new to anime  <br>I've been watching anime since 1976 you fucking plebeian. My dad was watching it decades before that and introduced me to the genre. Anime is in my blood. I speak fluently in all the dialects of Japanese and I learned by watching anime. I bet you haven't even seen a quarter of the anime I've seen. I've seen anime you probably haven't even fucking heard of. You're a fucking idiot for even assuming I'm "new to anime" when it's you who is new. You're the biggest fucking plebeian on this site. Fuck you.</br>  <br> seen allegedly thousands of anime <br> thinks THIS is the best ED in the entire medium <br> gets angry when an anonymous poster on the internet rightfully tells him he's a newfag <br> "You're the biggest fucking plebeian on this site" <br><br>I'm either replying to copypasta, a troll or a clinical retard and I don't exactly feel like giving you the benefit of the doubt so clinical retard it is. Please get off this site before your feelings get hurt more, newfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was never a great song to begin with, just had a few snappy lines that caught everyone's attention.</br>  <br>ARIGATO COMMENTO ANON-SAN SASUGA DESUNE</br>  <br>Of this season? Top 3 maybe, really, this season sucks.</br>  <br> thinks people here use 'best' properly <br>Anon please, unrustle your pantsu. To be fair, it is easily top 3 ED of the season, and to clarify, this time it's coming from a true newfag who hasn't seen 100 shows.</br></br>  <br>Link to the full ED?</br>  Why is Shinji considered a "pussy whining faggot who can't do anything" when Asuka is far more annoying than him? I went into this show expecting him to be insufferable but the character bitching and moaning all the time is the red-head. Fuck she isn't even all that good a pilot for all the shitalking she does. Does she get likable after character development or remain this one note bitch?  I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities for me to find them relatable. Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, and Rei are all so exaggerated or poorly-rounded that I don't give a shit about them or their problems.  All Eva characters  besides one  have been deliberately designed to be unappealing with very obvious irredeemable flaws.<br>You're retarded if you consider any of them your waifu.</br>  Because Asuka is a girl so she's acting as she's supposed to while Shinji is a guy so he must be tough and put that tsundere bitch back to her place  <br> I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities <br>Full retard.</br></br>  <br>Why does it always have to be either being obsessed with the characters or hating them?<br><br>Most Eva's characters are actually very nice. Yes, even Asuka. They all have good and bad moments.<br>It's only that, as the series progresses towards the end, the bad ones become more apparent, but this is also very much because of the situation they're in.<br><br>The fights become harder and have a more psychological impact, especially on the pilots. Towards the end, everyone is on edge and too busy with himself and his own problems, which is why (I think) so many finish the show thinking they are all horrible people.<br><br>But really, if you think Shinji or Asuka is either 100% bitch or 100% nice, then you didn't pay any attention to the show. They have their bad moments and some good ones, just like real people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop making sense, you're derailing a potential asuka rei kaworu waifu war thread.</br>  <br> lack a sufficient amount <br> this means 100% </br></br>  <br>This. I am very baffled by people who can find them likable or sympathetic.</br>  <br> lack a sufficient amount <br> for me to find them relatable <br> Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, and Rei are all so exaggerated or poorly-rounded that I don't give a shit about them or their problems. <br><br>He said they were exaggerated. How?<br>Just because their each characters' actions originate from mostly one character trait (Shinji = Avoidant; Asuka = Narcisstic; etc.) doesn't mean they're too exaggerated to be relatable.<br><br>Since this thread is aimed at Asuka I will point out some nice things she did:<br>-Finding a place to eat that takes Rei's veganism and Misato's low budget into consideration.<br>-Admiring Shinji's ability to play the cello<br>-Her concern for Shinji in the hospital (which she tried to hide)<br><br>These are some very minor and mostly superficial elements, but they still show that Asuka tries to be nice once in a while.<br><br> But he said "for me"! It's all relative and it's just his opinion! <br>Yes, and this is mine. While watching the show I found enough reason to see why people like Asuka. You don't have to share the same problems as a character to find them relatable and given Asuka's history, I found her character very realstic and relatable and I saw "a sufficient amount of human qualities".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, and this is mine. <br>Cool. Then we both have our impressions of the show that work for us.</br></br>  <br>The thing is, if all it takes to avoid having others criticize your opinion is to write<br> well, duh that's just my opinion, you can have yours. <br>Then there is no point in ever posting here, because you don't engage in any discussion, but only post your own opinion and tell people who disagree to fuck off.<br><br>My opinion doesn't have to be right, but if others disagree I try to point out why I have this certain opinion that I do and, thus we engage in discussion.<br>I try to give reason why I have mine and you should give reason why you have yours. Maybe you can convince someone of yours or he can convince you of his, but even if we don't the very least we try to understand the reasons why the other person has his specific opinion.<br><br>Not every discussion has to end in war.<br>But this doesn't mean we shouldn't try to justify the opinions we have. That's why we post here and not on some shitty blog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing is, if all it takes to avoid having others criticize your opinion is to write <br>I'm not avoiding having anyone respond to my post, I just don't have any interest in engaging in a conversation I have had a few times before and has been fruitless each time. I was giving the OP my opinion. You're welcome to give yours and he can judge the merits of each.</br></br>  <br>Nice or not, the baffling part is the fact that Shinji gets all the flack for his flaws while Asuka who is far worse doesn't. At least Shinji does his job well and actively tries to be decent and helpful even though his life sucks.</br>  <br>I guess that makes somewhat sense, but it is still lazy. Reasonably lazy, but lazy nonetheless.<br><br><br>But that's mostly the fans isn't it? I'd say by this point it is basically a fact that girls get less harsh treatment, just because they're girls, which of course isn't how it should be, but unfortunatelly how it is.<br>And yes, Shinji is far more bearable than Asuka.<br><br>If I was a character in the NGE universe, I'd porbably dislike Asuka as a person and be friends with Shinji, but I still think she is a well written character and even someone you can like if you know her circumstances (which you won't, unless you are a spectator who watches the show).<br><br>But since I am not a person within that universe and because I am just a spectator, I can see that Asuka isn't just a bitch. She is bitchy, but also far more than that.<br><br>Don't worry, I don't like the fact that people always shit on Shinji, either, but this doesn't mean I have to like people shitting on Asuka. If people shat on Rei (without justification), I'd probably try to defend her, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Eventually she starts struggling with the fact that she can't be the perfect, sexy EVA pilot that she wants to be and pretty much shuts down because of the realization. She gets fucked up, anon, don't worry.  <br>I liked her because I thought she was funny. I honestly couldn't take anything that came out of her mouth seriously. She was full of shit and I found that entertaining.</br>  <br>Rei gets shat on more than Shinji though.<br><br>There's been like three-four threads this week where she gets shat on, mostly by Kaworu fans and Asuka fans.<br><br>Where were you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reifags shit on other characters the most.</br>  <br>Not that anon but Rei Ayanami was the most popular character since NGE started, Anno even got angry with the audience because he intended to make a creepy child, not a sex doll. Lately her popularity has decreased among the fanbase but she's still the sex fantasy of thousand of geeks around the world.<br><br>Shinji doesn't sell</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously not there. Anon, I can only do so much.</br>  <br>See <br><br><br>You're here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she has fire. He is a wet fart.</br>  <br>But none of them insult Rei.</br>  <br>They do.</br>  <br>It's obviously an attack on Rei if it belittles the character as a mere sex fantasy and claim that it's only point is to be a creepy child.<br><br>IMO you just lost my sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to /a/. People will shit on you're waifu relentlessly here. They do it to everyone. If you don't like that, fuck off.</br>  <br>Not talking to you cockknob.</br>  <br>Reifags to it to other characters all the time.</br>  <br> lying </br>  <br>Who do you think is always starting the bitchfights with Asukfags on how they only like their waifu for fanservice? <br>Give me a fucking break. You do it because of insecurity and jealously, Reifag.<br>You do the same to Kaworufags too.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I've grown up, when I rewatched it, I found that their personalities make a lot more sense than I originally gave them credit for, especially Shinji.<br>I had the unrealistic expectation that as the 'MC' he should rise to any and all occasions. But the reality is that very few people if put in a position that dire would ever stand up to it, especially at the Shinji's age.<br>Same for Asuka and Rei.<br>Though their backgrounds are all very different, they're just kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop shitting on others first then things will improve.</br>  <br>Nah. I've been around /a/ since 2004 and since then as now it's always been Asuka fans that are the most belligerent, both passive-aggressively and directly. <br><br>Rei fans usually attack in defense.</br></br></br>  <br>So you admit, Reifags shit on others too.</br>  <br><br>You're the ones that shit on other characters first.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if you're not talking to me or not, my point still stands. People will have different opinions here, yes, some will even hate you're waifu. Don't cry like a baby just because this isn't your persona Reifag tumblr hugbox.</br>  <br><br>see <br><br> Who do you think is always starting the bitchfights with Asukfags on how they only like their waifu for fanservice?  <br><br>That line in particular has been the operating attack from Asuka fans towards Rei fans (and Kaworu fans) since the early 2000's on english-speaking websites.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Playing the innocent victim </br>  <br>Asukafags mostly. Kaworufans too. If we also look at evangelion, they're the characters with the objectively most fanservice, so you don't really have to be a rei fan to call them out.</br>  <br> the objectively most fanservice <br>That would be Misato. <br>And doesn't Rei show up naked the most out of the entire show?</br></br></br>  <br>That's what you just did. Everyone who has been on /a/ for more than a few days know you're the worst, just in the last weeks there's dozens of threads concerning why Rei a shit.<br><br>For those who has been here longer, they'd also know that the above is nothing new.</br></br></br>  <br> why Rei a shit <br>Asuka gets threads like that too. Kaworu gets threads like that sometimes as well. Shinji gets threads like that almost every single fucking day, and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching.</br></br>  <br>Simple:<br>Because of what's between her legs.<br><br>Asuka's still a qt, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your point is irrelevant to what I and the other poster was saying. Why not go outside and shout it as well?<br><br><br> That would be Misato.  <br>I don't think so. She's got fanservice but Asuka one-ups her easily. Rei also has fanservice but Asuka has more still.<br><br>When we account for the spinoffs there's definitely more Asuka fanservice there, the biggest and newest thing (Rebuild) has more fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka gets threads like that too.  <br>Not nearly as many.<br><br> Kaworu gets threads like that sometimes as well.  <br>Not nearly as many.<br><br> Shinji gets threads like that almost every single fucking day <br>Nonsense. Also<br><br>  and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching. <br>then what is this thread about?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nonsense. <br>It's not nonsense, Shinji objectively gets shit on the most out of every Eva character, ten fold in fact.<br>You've got threads and posts on /a/ shitting on him constantly daily. And yet you don't have Shinjifags sperging like manchildren as you yourself are so fond of doing. Grow up.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, none of em gets as much as Rei except maybe Shinji, and then it's not the same type of hate-thread. Asuakfags are generally poisonous people who make the thread to attack and crap on a character because of waifu rivalry.<br><br>When Shinji gets some thread about why he's a pussy, it's always some newbie to Evangelion who was expecting something else, rather than some sort of waifu war tactic.<br><br>The latter is tolerable, the former one is actually seeking to start a waifu war.<br><br> and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching. <br>There's always one in every thread like the one mentioned above, and did you not read the OP? It's more or less whining about how Asukafags can give Shinji shit but avoid to give Asuka shit for being the same or worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, that's nonsense. There's hardly any Shinji-threads, if anything there's just as many pro-shinji threads, this one for example.<br>Also, whenever there's a thread about how Shinji is a wuss, it's always some newfag who's watching it and expects Goku or Luffy, it's got nothing to do with actual shitting on a character like Asukafags or otherfags do.</br></br>  <br> Again, that's nonsense <br>It isn't. One pro-Shinji thread in every blue moon does not excuse him being one of the most hated Anime characters in the entire western Anime fanbase. He's relentlessly shit on everywhere, by newfags or not is irrelevant. <br>The point is he's shit on more than you're waifu, and yet Shinjifags do not childishly sperg and whine to even 1/100th of the extent Reifags do.<br>He's the punching bag of the fanbase, don't even try to deny and pretend that you Reifags deserve any sympathy and praise for your shitty victim-complex.</br></br></br></br>  I like every single nge character and I think especially Shinji, Asuka and Rei have amazing writing.  <br>Thank you for having good taste. But why the hell are you on /a/?</br>  <br>Why is Shinji considered a faggot when OP sucks far more cocks than him? I went into this thread expecting him to get ragged on, but the one bitching and moaning all the time is OP. Fuck he isn't even that good at the shittalking he does. Does OP ever stop sucking dicks after he stops being underaged or remain this laughable caricature of an angst ridden ubderfaggot?</br>  <br>I mostly just feel like arguing when he's called all pussy and the stupid white knight heroics and aggressive streak are neglected.</br>  <br>The rebuilds are shit though, as are all characters in it.</br>  <br>Rebuild are a squeakel</br>  <br><br><br> I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities for me to find them relatable. <br><br>That's the point you idiot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, it is? I think they are very human, that's why I like them.</br>  <br>They are probably the most humane characters that has been created.</br>  <br> Reifags hating on Shinji <br><br>Suddenly it all makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>That's mostly samefags though. Shitting on Shinji goes waaaay back to probably the beginning of this fanbase for some reason. No one ever got as much shit as he did.</br>  <br>Reifags only like him when he comes to save their waifu.</br>  <br> and yet you don't see Shinjifags bitching. <br>Oh please Shinjifags hijacked Asuka threads and kawoshitters get butthurt and start shitposting the minute you inform them their waifu is shit. These groups are basically the same circlejerk of people.</br></br>  <br>I've never seen a Shinjifag bitch; I have seen plenty of KawoShinfags do so though.</br>  <br>This one <br>Bitched a whole lot in an Asuka thread a while ago and image dumped it to death before shitposting and crying.</br></br>  <br>What you posted is a Kaworufag, not a Shinjifag. Are you mentally retarded?</br>  <br>Same shit in these threads, fujo. Once you get a "shinjifag" mad enough it won't take long for them to start calling everyone a waifufag and dumping Kaworu/kawoshin.</br>  <br>This thread is a shinjifag bitching.<br><br><br> by newfags or not is irrelevant.  <br>It is relevant because it means it's just an initial reaction as opposed to being shat on, i.e there's not any group of people that exists to shit on shinji.<br><br> but your victim complex <br>that's the entirety of your post. good going denying the tons of pro-shinji threads and the fact that many people, reifags mostly and most misatofags after 3.0 are the ones doing the defending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even think there's such a thing as a "Shinjifag" who isn't also a Kaworu/KawoShinfag</br>  <br> shinjifag <br> kawoshinfag <br>Same shit <br>Both are fujo minorities who shitpost to make up for their lack of numbers</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinjifags want Shinji to be happy, so naturally they'll ship him with Kaworu. <br>They aren't Kaworufags though just because they ship the canon pairing, we couldn't give less of a shit about Kaworu as a character.<br>We aren't going to come to his defense and the landwhales who sperg over him anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>This THREAD is about a shinjifag bitching because Asuka is more well received  honestly Shinji is pretty bland anyway so his flaws will stand out more, while Asuka is flamboyant and energetic </br>  <br>And how is that any different from the cancerous Asuka and Reifags?<br>It's not except we don't make constant "hurr hurr post Usacar for teh moot xD" threads and shit up the board with our shitflinging waifufag arguments every thread.<br>Shinjifags &gt; Asuka/Reifags</br></br></br>  <br>There are  LASfags  who don't self-insert as Shinji, but we're small in numbers.</br>  <br><br>Reifags always liked Shinji. They have a tendency to like people/characters who get kicked around a lot, which Shinji and Rei both represent.<br><br>In these days and the days before, Asukafags did the "Shinji a shit" dance for the most part to be backed up by the anime community. In recent times even Kaworufags have become extremely dismissive of Shinji since the new canon of Evangelion requires it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being a LASfag and not self-inserting <br>Look, I don't even ship, but being a LASfag without self inserting is nonsensical. That being said, that's just Evagekks shit right there.</br></br>  <br>For one thing, neither of those group shitpost and shit stir to the degree you do. You feel insecure here in territory that is not as welcoming as it is for Asuka/Rei, so you lash out more. </br>  <br>Pretty sure that kind of LASfag is bisexual and just ships their waifu and husbando</br>  <br>In terms of defending or liking Shinji, here's the list:<br><br>Shinjifags &gt; Reifags &gt; Misatofags &gt; Kaworufags &gt; Asukafags<br><br><br>No, you're a Kawoshinfag. If you wanted Shinji to be happy, you'd actually cross out Kaworu. You're not allowing you're waifu a normal life, and by rejecting the happiness he achieves before Kaworu, you're proving that you aren't Shinjifags.<br><br>At most you're moefags that prey on Shinji's weaknesses. Shinji could become like Rei Q and it'd still be OK for you guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurr let me make up different definitions for shit on to validate my delusion that us Reifags are the punching bags of the fanbase <br> a bloo bloo no one suffers as much as us! <br>Grow the fuck up.<br><br><br>You support Shinji being abused. You don't like him, you just selfinsert for femdom shit. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say anything about who was the punching bag or not, just that you're the one with a victim complex.<br><br>Look at this thread. You are projecting hard man. How about you grow the fuck up?</br></br></br>  <br> You support Shinji being abused. You don't like him, you just selfinsert for femdom shit. Fuck off. <br><br>Teased yes, abused no. :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Nah you're just a fujoshit. Shinji is happy before and after Kaworu but you pretend it doesn't exist. I'm sure you get butthurt when people shit on the faggot or your ship, too.</br>  <br> Reifags always liked Shinji <br>Yeah, I'm sure.<br>Drawing pictures of her kicking Shinji's face in really proves your point: </br></br></br>  <br> You support Shinji being abused. You don't like him, you just selfinsert for femdom shit.  <br> Fuck off. <br><br>Not that guy, but if you support Kawoshin you're no better. Kawoshin is inherently abusive in canon and otherwise. It stands for abusing Shinji's weaknesses at his worst, and giving him a false happiness.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all this projection <br> all this asspain <br>You aren't making a good case for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> neither of those group shitpost and shit stir to the degree you do </br>  <br>You're assuming the artist is a Reifag, and even then there's plenty of Kaworu fans who draw Shinji getting pounded like a bitch by Kaworu or have him stabbed by him with a lance and so on.</br>  <br>my brother of african american descent</br>  <br>does Shinji really start cross-dressing in the manga?</br>  <br> Shinji getting pounded like a bitch by Kaworu <br>Manga Kawoshin. It's in-character. I'm personally not a fan, but whatever floats Sadamoto's gay ass boat.<br><br> have him stabbed by him with a lance and so on <br>Oh fuck off with this cherry-picking shit, 90% of Kawoshin art is them smiling and doing fluffy cute shit and you know it.<br>Reifags draw her shitting in Shinji's mouth in doujinshi, for fuck's sake. <br>You don't care, stop pretending you care.<br>You only care when he's doing it for your waifu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just the doujins</br>  Kawoshinfags, and "Shinjifags", how can you support Kaworu x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji?  <br>Do you need someone to start posting Kawoshin gore or rape to realize how retarded this logic is?</br>  <br> how can you support Asuka x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji? <br> how can you support Rei x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji? <br> how can you support Misato x Shinji if it's implicitly bad for Shinji? <br>It's the best of the bunch by far. Anno and co. agreed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of those are as bad for Shinji as shipping him with Kaworu.<br><br>Those three are relatively normal to Kaworu, and Kaworu's "love" always means betraying or hurting Shinji in the most pointless of ways. There's literally no other coupling in Evangelion you can choose that's worse. Imagine how hateful and hurting Kaworu is if he tries?</br></br></br>  <br>You've been shitposting ever since 3.33 generals. You must have stuck your head far up your own ass if you think people can't see through you.</br>  <br> Manga Kawoshin. It's in-character. I'm personally not a fan, but whatever floats Sadamoto's gay ass boat. <br>uh, it's not in character. It never happened.<br><br>Also, Asuka slaps and kicks Shinji, Toji punches Shinji, Rei slaps Shinji, does that mean they're "off the hook" too because it's in character?<br>Way to sink your own argument, as if anyone reasonable couldn't see it was dead in the water to begin with.<br>(lol hey I just pick a random image off the net and even if the artist isn't a reifag it means it represents all reifags!)<br><br> Oh fuck off with this cherry-picking shit <br>You just cherrypicked as well. One picture among thousands.<br><br>You're giant hypocrite, you know that? This whole picture thing was an argument you started and promptly failed. How about you stop pretending you care about Shinji and isn't just here to be a fetishist?<br><br>I think what you just said here: <br> You only care when he's doing it for your waifu. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128570428#p128585246">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Compare this official art of Kawoshin to this official art of AsukaxShinji:<br><br><br>Notice how he doesn't look happy? Yeah, me too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of those characters drove Shinji to suicide or made him kill them.</br>    Slowly but surely ch 38 coming together.  <br> implying Kurumi wears any </br>  Slowly but surely my dick is rising with Kurumi's corpse butt.  <br>I doubt it since they have access to water.</br>  REMINDER RADIO-CHAN IS ALIVE AND WELL  <br>She should've told miki to wear a condom.</br>  For some reason your tsun girlfriend is tsun-ing it out on you. What can you do to calm her down?  <br>At first, before the Sora arc, I thought she was a major QT. But she ruined that when she flips her shit at Haru.</br>  <br>What made these fucks so horny enough to do it in the fucking hallway?</br>  <br>They were<br>1) In the middle of a loving, and exciting relationship between 2 people who know each other inside and out<br>2) Not expecting Kozue to be a nosy cunt and pull the door open on them</br></br></br>  <br>Well obviously and it most certainly was a late night anime, i.e. aired when the little critters ought to be in bed already. And all yet the goodthinking people in our western societies would've been utterly appalled by the content if they ever caught wind of it.</br>  <br>that fucking scene gets me everytime</br>  Yusari~n made my heart go doki doki and hit a home run.  <br>Like I said, I don't remember much about Angel Beats.<br><br>I just really hope they'll be able to pull off the romance and the dark tones in a satisfying way. I just want this show to be successful, because I want my Nao figure.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They won't since its only one cour, if it was two then the pacing would be fine. I thought Maeda said he learned from his mistakes from Angel Beats but I guess not. This will be another show with wasted potential by rushing the ending.</br></br>  <br><br>Whoops accidentally quoted myself.</br></br>  Imouto must get her sauce from Papa John's. That stuff is NASTY. <br><br>Well shit and my captcha had to be of pizza too.</br></br>  <br> This will be another show with wasted potential by rushing the ending. <br><br>Angel Beats was actually okay. Then it dragged on the drama for far too long and did some pretty forced stuff just to get an emotional reaction from the audience. <br><br>I just really want a Tomori figure ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>SLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLU<wbr>TSLUTSLUTSLUT</wbr></br></br>  SLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UT</wbr></wbr>  <br>That shit was awesome.
