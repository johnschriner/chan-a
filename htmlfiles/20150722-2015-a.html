Individuals in each group respond sexually to visual images of children and young people in distinct and narrow age ranges.[10] Lolicon manga and anime contain images and narratives involving romantic and erotic interactions between typically an adult man and a girl in the age range desired by such men.[3] <br>Which is pretty spot on too. Notice how it's not about cuteness only.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128389468 <br> Not necessarily, because there are many pedophiles out there who are inactive. <br>What the fuck does that have to do with anything? Just because someone wants to fuck someone doesn't mean that they would.<br> Leaving that aside, one shouldn't forget that the Japanese basically use "lolicon" to mean "pedophile," <br>If anything, it's more of an argument for me because Japan produces your lolis with sexual intent in mind, but you for some reason insist that they are just for cuteness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd give all of my possesions to be in that situation</br>  <br>They make Kurugaya happy. That's reason enough. I bet part if why she likes Riki is because he's such a loli magnet.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128390052 <br> It isn't, it's an argument for how different the Japanese view all this in first place. <br>Yes, and they are the only ones producing loli anime, manga and everything else, West is just a consumer, so whatever western wrong definitions and misconceptions you have don't matter. You can't say that lolis can't be sexualized when they were made with that intent in the very first place.<br> the whole concept of a "pedophile" works differently for them <br>Not really, it works pretty much the same everywhere. Normal people in Japan view it just as bad as normal people in the West.<br><br>And you're doing nothing other interpreting things in a way that won't make you look like a bad and scary pedophile-child rapist for liking drawn little girls, even going as far as to deny the obvious sexual nature of lolicon. It won't work for normalfags anyway, so you're being in denial for nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Komari <br> loli <br>Nigga, what? She's a midget, but is otherwise curvy<br>.</br></br></br></br>  little girls are _____.    <br>Sexy</br>  Is there any official art of Kuro x Shiro? I want that brown slut stealing Shiro too.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128391649 <br>Yes, your analogy is very shitty. It's more like being a nazi but saying you shouldn't gas jews because it's wrong.<br> Let me ask again: would you be able to sell "pedophile comics" in stores and air "pedophile cartoons" on TV in a western country? <br>What that has to do with anything? No, you can't. That's why the likes of you are so obstinate in trying to deny any sexuality in lolicon despite it going against its nature.<br><br>Funny how insults are your best argument, huh. You can find loli cute and adorable and not fap to them, nobody is forbidding you to do that. Just don't call yourself a lolicon and don't push your agenda onto people who are actually lolicons and want and do fap to loli. Additionally, it would be nice if you fucked off from this dirty lolicon-infested place to somewhere more suitable for you, but I guess that's too much to ask.<br> find loli erotic <br> without going all "hurr durr I want to fuck them," <br> erotic: Relating to or tending to arouse sexual desire or excitement. <br>That's some nice mental gymnastics here. Well, whatever helps your washed brain feel better about itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  /ll/ never.   /a/ doesnt like loli anymore <br><br>what happened?</br></br>  <br>It's the middle of the day anon, most lolicons have jobs.

She had taken to using a recognizable cartoon avatar whenever she posted-- this cartoon avatar was named kohina. I was disturbed to suspect that she and I shared something in common.

If she did, would her feelings change? If the Sisters are so important to her she crushes on the guy for saving them shouldn't she start by having an understanding of that</br></br>  <br> She should at least try to spend some casual time with Touma, getting to know him on a personal level, his history, his interpersonal relationships <br> casual time with Touma <br>lol<br><br>She's tried a couple times but Touma has a busy schedule, world-saving and girl-punching and the like. On the off chance she catches up to him, he's having a fruit cola moment and doing something so stupid that she tries to fry him. I'm beginning to think this is all planned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The issue with her is that when she did try to at least get some info about his problems and shit Touma never lets her dig deeper and she never tries to dig deeper, that's why she's been trying to force him to accept help, so she can actually try to help him.</br>  I want to fuck Nero in the butt!  <br>Well, Nero wants to fuck you in the butt and will do it better!</br>  <br>Neato, but why?

What do you think /a/?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gakkou Gurashi!  <br> muh manime trash <br><br>Fuck outta here</br></br></br>  hahahahahahahah  NNB, Charlotte or Gakkou Gurashi.  <br>God eater is a joke.<br>AOTS will definitely be Charlotte</br></br>  <br>damn this season is shit</br>  <br> manime trash <br> implying all the anime in the OP aren't moe <br>A series doesn't have to be about little girls to be moe, so step it up senpai</br></br></br>  <br> god eater <br>OP pls</br></br>  <br> God eater </br>  The one I'm enjoying the most is Sore ga Seiyuu. Could be AOTS the same way Shirobako was AOTS last season.  What does AOT mean?  <br><br>excuse me?<br><br><br>Attack on Titan</br></br></br></br></br>  A lot of it comes to personal preference. However if you think any of these are AOTS you should kill yourself:<br> Charlotte <br> God Eater <br> Overlord <br> NNB </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gangsta is fucking terrible you DQN-kei chuunibyou.</br>  Gate, Rolls, or MonMusu  It hasn't aired yet.  <br> Overlord <br>Fuck no literal trash</br></br>  <br>How can one person be such a faggot?<br>REAL candidates are<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Prison School<br>Working!!!<br>Gakkou Gurashi<br>Ushio to Tora</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention<br> MonMusu <br> GATE </br></br></br>  <br> muh mature anime <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br> Gate <br><br>They fucked up character designs too bad to be considered AOTS. Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to watch it, but MonMusu for example did a way better job so far  still waiting for spider. </br></br></br>  op you only like low budget crap?  <br> &gt;Overlord <br> &gt;Gangsta <br> &gt;God Eater <br> mature <br>Are you retarded? They are stupid fun, nobody thinks hat they are deep or mature.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ushio to Tora <br> Prison School <br>Hang yourself<br><br><br> impyling any anime can be either "mature" or "moe" <br>You should hang yourself too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only character design that was ruined was psychopath army girl turned into an idolm@s, the rest are fine and Rory is an improvement over the original design. Deal with it nerd.</br>  <br>classroom crisis is pretty good too</br>  <br> they are stupid fun, nobody thinks hat they are deep or mature <br>That's not how normalfags thinks.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but regular /a/nons aren't normalfags</br>  Like last season there are no series that stand out from the rest.  <br> he seriously believe that <br><br>The majority here are just pretending to be virgin neet loser.</br></br></br>  <br>I said the regular.</br>  <br> <br>I fucking love the games. But so far, the god eater anime is absolute shit tier, anon. Especially the version of Leader they decided to design.<br> <br>With only 13 episodes(this season at least), if he doesn't turn around to stop being a bigger douchebag than Eric, it's gonna be the shitbag bomb of the season.<br> <br>Worried as hell about what they're about to do with Alisa, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   underwater   There's nothing really great this season, my vote goes to Gangsta. Overlord and Working!!! are doing fine too.   no Shimoneta <br>shit taste, the thread</br>  <br>It is funny but you do have to realise it's shit.</br>  Any airing anime except the ones I don't like  <br><br>Based on my extensive observations I can confidently state that /a/'s most-oft-stated AOTS's for this season are:<br><br>1. Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>2. Shimoneta<br>3. Working!!!<br><br>Note that this does not represent my opinion. This is simply what I have observed here on /a/.<br><br>Furthermore, I feel I must acknowledge that I have worded your post and chosen your anime in a specific manner in order to troll a specific fanbase here. Shame on you, OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. But although there's nothing really spectacular, there are a lot more shows worth watching.</br>  <br>And you have to realize it isn't funny either.</br>  Prison school  <br><br> Furthermore, I feel I must acknowledge that you have worded your post  <br><br>FTFM.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's really stupid and 80% of it is just bad but so far the 20% have been enough to make me enjoy the first 3 episodes.</br>  <br>I usually like some fun shounenshit<br>But what is so special about these 3? Watched all of them and found them boring, nothing extraordinary has happened yet.</br></br>  <br> Furthermore, I feel I must acknowledge that I have worded your post and chosen your anime in a specific manner in order to troll a specific fanbase here. Shame on you, OP. <br>Nope, I'm serious the other series' aren't bad, there are actually 11 shows I'm following this season, but those three in the OP are objectively the best (of those that I watch that is).</br></br>  Overlord, Gurashi, GATE, Working and Gangsta are best shows this season. It's meaningless to choose the best, as it will mostly depend on people's favorite genre.  <br> Nope, I'm serious <br> totally didn't choose 3 "manime" and say "we can all agree" just to troll "moefags" <br>We can see through your shit, OP.</br></br></br>  <br> OHOHOHOHO <br> Satomi Arai <br> god-tier OP and ED <br> Kajou's everything <br>it's the little things that get me to like it</br></br></br></br></br>  Ushio to Tora is by far the best.  <br> 3 "manime" and say "we can all agree" just to troll "moefags" <br>that is pretty paranoid of you. Just because someone is a "moefag" or whatever you call it, it does not mean that he can't like a series that doesn't focus on moe in combination with little girls. I'm dead serious. There are enough people with a vast taste. Just because someone like K-ON! it doesn't mean that he would hate Psycho-Pass automatically. My intention was not to "troll" anyone.</br></br>    3 episodes in <br>  it sure is anime of the year guys! <br>I bet you're one of those faggots who rate shows on mal before the season starts</br></br>  <br>I agree with him though. They also aren't manime.  There are other genres than moe and manime, newfag. </br>  <br> we all can agree <br> My intention was not to "troll" anyone. <br> we all can agree </br></br></br>  <br> Written by Maeda Jun <br> AOTS </br></br>  <br>I'm sorry that you feel so buttblasted.</br>  <br> But which one is the actual AOTS? <br>Non Non Biyori, obviously.</br></br>  <br>That's a normal line for a thread about opinions. It must suck getting offended so easily.</br>  <br>Charlotte is terrible Maeda trash though.</br>  <br> What do you think /a/? <br>Gakkou or NNB.</br></br>  My person AOTS are <br><br>  Akagami no Shirayuki <br>  GATE <br>  Classroom Crisis <br><br>With a honorable mention to Gakkou Gurashi and Durarara.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a lot of good shows this season and none of those are them.</br>  <br> LOL U MAD <br> but I'm not trolling <br/></br></br>  <br>As I said my intention in the OP was not to trigger you, but as it seems it happened. As you're not bringing anything new to the table, you should refrain from posting in this thread and (if you really have the urge) simply report it and post in another thread.</br>  <br>fuck off newshit <br> <br><br> there's a lot of good shows this season <br>you can't be this deluded, seriously</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AOTS was already officially announced a while back. The fuck you been? Lurkmoar.</br>  Post yfw MonMusufags think their show is the greatest thing ever   Was the second Gods Eater PSP game even translated?   <br>All three are garbage.</br>  <br>nope everyone was shitting on you when you made that thread with your shittaste, so fuck off.</br>  <br>Decent taste.</br>  <br> Koufuku Graffiti <br>It was boring trash, rest is fine though.   Pleiades was better than Hibikek  </br></br>  <br>ushio to tora is my aots</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>My nonnonniggas.<br><br> fuck off <br>Triggered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh, I dropped all of those during the first episode.</br>  Actually though, Shimoneta is probably the furthest in the running, but Gakkou Gurashi and Ushio to Tora also have a chance. Charlotte is a maaaaaaaybe. Nothing else is even worth watching.  <br>I agree with all 3. I think when you say that though, people have this reaction where they think you're saying those shows are the greatest things ever. Every other show is painfully typical and expected in some way. Overlord is the "trapped in a game" concept done right, Gangsta is a crime plot which isn't something we see often, and God Eater has the best production values. I don't feel like it's that far fetched to claim these 3 are the best of the season.</br>  <br> he dropped a Fall 2015 anime during the first episode </br>  <br>Damn right it is</br>   mfw my AOTY so far is Yu-gi-oh Arc-V <br>How the hell did that happen?</br>  <br>God Eater looks terrible though, despite the production values. They're cutting corners on movement as much as they can get away with.</br>  <br>Nothing is boring if the girls are great enough and Koufuku's main three are all miracles of the universe.</br>  <br>You're the most disgusting anon in this thread.</br>  <br> "trapped in a game" concept done right <br>Not saying Overlord is bad, but<br> Log Horizon <br> .hack//SIGN <br>exist.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best soundtrack or BGM this season??  <br> They're cutting corners on movement as much as they can get away with <br>I'm not aware of any of that. All I know is it looks better than anything else this season.</br></br>  <br> can we all agree <br>No, fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Gangsta and Durarara x2 Ten are the only good shows in this season.</br>  <br> all that pointless shading <br> good <br>Meh</br></br></br>  <br> Anything with action is mature <br>Shouldnt you be in high school?</br></br>  <br>So anything that goes beyond a typical visual style is pointless to you?</br>  <br>Rokka no Yuusha<br>Bikini Warriors<br>Akagami no Shirayukihime<br>Joukamachi no Dandelion<br><br>These all have potential to be AOTS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bikini Warriors <br>yeah no  or wait maybe if all the other series get cancelled. </br></br>  <br>Is this as depressing as the summary makes it seem? Everyone says it's good but I'm not sure I'm willing to do that to myself.</br>  I'm fucking loving Classrom Crisis. Wakaba Girl is also great. Rest is okay.  <br>Gangsta can be considered mature, considering the subject matter and &gt;main characters not in highschool.<br><br>But other than that, I'd consider Classroom Crisis the most mature anime this season. It's about corporate fraud and downsizing an unprofitable department, there's NOTHING more adult than that.</br></br></br>  Am I the only one watching this shit?  3-Wakaba girl or Joukamechi<br>2-Non Non Biyori<br>1-Gakkou Gurashi<br><br>It's a shame I can't count leftovers though, because shokugeki is going just as strongly as it was last season. Can't wait for the autumn election</br></br></br></br>  AOTS are Non Non Biyori and Shimoneta.  <br>I'll probably drop it. So no, but soon.</br>  <br> Can't wait for the autumn election <br>Protip: NNB will win again. "moe" anime wins every poll here. That's just /a/'s demographics.</br></br>  <br>I'm watching as well. Not AOTS material but it is fun. It's a great combination of reverse trap and bromance</br>  <br>Animeonlyfags in charge of being retarded</br>  <br> <br>If that's enough to qualify a show for AOTS, DB Super should be at the top with its coloring. In half the scenes, GE's blending is so bad, the white around the edges of the characters looks like poorly edited transparent gifs.<br> <br>Both Gate and Rokka look much better than GE in actual action, and I'm not even really enjoying Gate that much so far(Rokka's been fun though.)<br> <br>UFOTable is not cruise control for top quality. So far, the only thing GE is really doing right is its music and aragami design.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's so good about NNB?<br><br>Sure, the first episode didn't make me want to claw my eyes out like moe SoL usually does, but it was still pointless and dull.</br></br></br>  <br> autumn election <br>Will they be able finish it? That arc was really long in the manga.</br></br>  <br>It is the most well-executed iyashikei anime since ARIA. If iyashikei isn't your thing, you won't get it. Iyashikei is, however, a fairly popular subgenre here. There's also a pretty sizable portion of /a/ hyped for new ARIA.<br>It's just really well-produced and written for what it is. It's mind-numbingly heartwarming, cute and relaxing. It makes me feel good, man.</br></br>    Gangsta <br>  a word many would file as AAVE  <br>  about crime <br>  does not take place in Japan <br>  no black main characters <br>  just one latina chick <br>Based Japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It heals the heart<br><br>No but they will definitely get through prelims. The whole arc is great. They better have knifenigger in it</br></br></br>  <br>My top candidate is Gatchaman Crowds, followed by NonNonBiyori, Umaru, Gakkou Gurashi and Overlord</br>   muh cute girls doing cute things AOTS <br>I know it's bait but how is this not considered shitposting at this point? Even the polls are rigged every time. Also the number of images with the moeshit flavor of the season used for baiting. Just why?</br>  <br>Oh. You meant an election in some manga. Hazukashii.</br>  <br>Given the fact that this is a visual medium, yeah I do think going above and beyond with the production values makes a show a contender. Not even saying it's the best show, but it should be in the running since it doesn't opt for a bland presentation we're used to seeing.<br><br> GE's blending is so bad, the white around the edges of the characters looks like poorly edited transparent gifs <br>I'm not a producer, so I don't analyze it that way. All I know is it looks appealing to me.<br><br>I understand I probably hold visuals in a higher regard than most of /a/, but I'd argue that most don't hold it in high enough regard. Also the story is entertaining so far and I have no problems with it either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  People need to learn how to start a thread if they want to avoid shitposting.  <br>That must be it, I didn't like Aria either.<br><br>Although, Aria still had a beautiful setting design and some really nice character designs. Non Non Biyori takes place in the... countryside. That's just about the most boring setting out there.</br></br></br>  <br>What show is that in the bottom left corner? SAO?</br>  <br>But that would mean that the thread would die after ten posts</br>  <br> muh manly man doing cool battle attack </br>  <br>I wonder who's going to be Mimasaka's VA.</br>  <br> I'm not a producer, so I don't analyze it that way. All I know is it looks appealing to me. <br>Fair. I'm not a producer either so I don't analyze it (different anon, yes). It just looks unappealing to me.</br></br>  <br> What's so good about NNB? <br>Nothing. It's the state of life and problems of the people who watch it what "makes" NNB good.</br></br>  I bet you guys aren't even watching the true AOTS.  <br> <br>But that's just it. Production values implies quality. Given that GE is pretty obviously skimping in many areas and suffering technically for it, it lacks when compared to many other shows running right now.<br> <br>If you want to give it an award for technical reasons, sure, why not. Everyone sets aside some catagories for sound editing and such. But that's not remotely the same.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I know it's bait <br>It's not.<br> but how is this not considered shitposting at this point? <br>Because posting genuine opinions isn't shitposting.<br> Even the polls are rigged every time. <br>They're not.<br> Also the number of images with the moeshit flavor of the season used for baiting. <br>Sincere opinions =/= baiting.<br>Do you doubt me? Look at the /a/ catalog at any given moment, as many times as you like, and mentally note each time the percentage of images having cute girls in them.<br>/a/'s largest demographic, by far, is "moefags." Thus, you are going to see the opinions of "moefags" posted a lot on /a/. If this bothers you, there are other websites on which you can discuss anime, and pretty much none of them outside of 2ch have as large of a percentage of "moefags."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the "moe anime" are at the very least as repetitive as the "mature/manly anime", so what's your point?</br>  Do we really have to be picky?<br>The season is actually really solid, I'm watching a lot of stuff.<br>Though Overlord and Gansta are my favorites so far.<br>But I'm also liking stuff like Charlotte and Shimoneta</br></br></br>  <br>Literally say this exact same post with this  exact same reply in a previous thread.<br><br>I don't know if it's IRC are I'm just noticing cracks in the matrix from being on here so much.</br></br></br>  <br>They'll probably get someone like Miyake Kenta.</br>  <br> Non Non Biyori takes place in the... countryside. That's just about the most boring setting out there. <br>That's just about the most peaceful, relaxing setting out there. It's iyashikei. That's the point. Yep, that must be it. Iyashikei just isn't your thing. It isn't for everyone. I think there's nothing better right before bed after a long, stressful day, but that's just me.</br></br>  <br>*saw</br>  <br>No idea, but hopefully they nail his character. He doesn't have a huge role since it's only really the 2 shokugekis, but he has such a strong personality during those 2 shokugekis that it would suck if they messed it up.<br><br>Closer, but not quite</br></br></br>  <br>In most cases, yes. NNB is fairly unique for its genre though. It's unusual to have a core group of characters spanning such a wide range age, the countryside setting allows for a lot of unusual scenes/settings apart from the usual SoL tropes (oh boy, school festival, never seen that done before, etc.), and Renge, one of the great all-time show-stealing characters, uniquely defies categorization.</br>  <br>I can't imagine Miyake Kenta doing an impression of Natsuki Hanae.</br>  <br>Relaxing and peaceful just means that I worry about real life instead.

Take for example all those images of past AOTS where all shows are SoLs. The anon who made the pic really likes SoL. It's obvious, right? But he's just shitposting about it.

It is a fun watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Narutard thinking his opinion matters </br>  I could have liked it if Gakkou Gurashi was actually about the zombies, but it isn't. It's basically the Scooby Doo gang stuck in a zombie flick. So far, we haven't seen that much zomibes and they're really not threating at all. They move a snails pace I swear they could just literally run circles around the zombies and get out. There is no desperate from the cast and I think it's been over a year now they've been at that school. There isn't even any fast moving zombies. Like in Resident Evil 4 give me those zombies who move like champs and when you blow off their heads they're still coming after you.<br><br>The show isn't even satire because everyone in the show is super ceral so I can't even that that seriously, yet the people in this show act like goofy and silly.</br></br>  <br>That's just /a/ shit taste at it's finest, the best shows never get discussed because there's never QUALITY or other silly shit to make fun of and get pissy over because it's a solid anime with no glaring flaws.</br>  <br> Thank you based KyoAni. </br>  <br>Never caught up with it because I don't like Sauce-k.

I don't really mind romance as long isn't unfulfilled and doesn't detract from the series. I've read some of the manga when it was being dumped before the anime aired and it was really good. The anime is shaping up pretty nicely as well.</br></br></br>  If you could only watch one anime this season, which one would that be?  <br>I wish I was like you anon, every season I make it a goal to watch all these anime but every time the actual season starts I only keep up to date with very,very few, but it is most likely my fault since I don't use the 3 episode rule and I prefer marathoning than watching week to week which is why most airing anime don't hold my attention for too long.</br>  <br>NNB.<br>Though I'll be really sad if I can't watch Wakaba.</br></br>  <br>I'm watching 13 plus 3 other anime and 2 manga.

I sometimes end up just spending a weekend or two near the end watching everything that sounds good at that point.</br>  <br>Say that to the people mentioning 3-4 anime instead of one.</br>  God Eater and to a lesser extent Gangsta are disappointments.

Himouto may just as well be going up against K-ON; never stood a chance.</br>  <br>Gangsta is more boring than take the tea with your grandma and the most cliche series I seen in my life, dropped already. God Eater look like shit, I won't even give it 1 episode so I can't give an opinion on it. Overlord is fine, but nothing worth to mention.<br>This season is really bad compared to last one, where there was at least 10 series worth to be the AOTS, in this season none deserve that title, but I would go for GATE or GG, so far so good. And in the bottom of the barrel, Gangsta and Bikini Warriors.</br></br>  <br>Where is Aquarion or Chaos dragon</br>  <br>What about Shinometa?</br>  Gakkou Gurashi and Shirayukihime are objectively the best anime this season.<br><br>Even if you deny it you're just doing it out of spite because you know it's true</br></br>  <br>below 25</br>  <br> gangsta <br> god eater <br> no shimoneta on the list <br><br>Fucking kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assuming you mean Gangsta, IRC happened.

GochiUsa feels to me like NNB without Renge or Yuru Yuri without Toshino Kyoko.</br>  <br>It wasnt the most popular show of its season.

Some of them are as funny as watching paint dry.</br>  Overlord only went up because of Mr. Death Knights uncensored killing spree.  Why no one is talking about Jitsu wa watashi wa? it's really going to be an AOTS maybe. I'm still really enjoying the way events are rearranged and some elements are introduced earlier or in a different context, it feels very fresh to me, and the pace and flow of events is still great comedic-wise and storytelling-wise. They captured the essence of Mikan's character very nicely, and though it didn't feel as rewarding, if that's the right word, as it did originally, they still left a lot of room for development on her side, and she's still hilarious, so nothing's really lost. It‚Äôs even better because even mangaonlyfag can enjoy this because everything is changed in a good way and they make it new.<br>The truth is that there's the slight feeling that I really wanted to see some of the manga scenes accurately adapted, but I'm not coming from a place that thinks that the changes are bad, since I honestly don't, it's just that some of the scenes from the manga were so great. Now it's the adaptation's time to shine though, up until now I've thoroughly enjoyed each episode, I'm also loving adapted Shiragami more and more with every passing week, and I'm looking forward for what's to come because In the end, it is going to be a great adaptation and maybe AOTS like i said before.</br>  <br>/a/ is not a hivemind.</br>  <br> It didnt get the most threads or was the most discussed <br>This is because it was an IRC trolling target during season 1. Not long after the first episode aired, things were going peacefully in those threads until out of nowhere, all of the sudden, there was incredibly prolific spam about all the lewd things IRC wanted to do to the Non Nons. That shit hasn't stopped since that day, and a lot of Non Non viewers, myself included, simply decided not to participate in those threads.</br></br>  <br>Well meme'd my friend.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128404429 <br> &gt;newfags narutards acting like they have been here forever <br> Gold. <br>nope you're the only one</br></br></br>  AOTS threads are literally the containment threads for underage b&amp; and redditors.

Then everything became awesome.<br><br>I might read the manga after</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Boruto new trailer is out. <br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=puQ3<wbr>2k5HFGU</wbr>  [ ]<br>Apparently he can use Gentle fist but obviously he can't strike the chakra points, still based.<br><br>Also reminder that tommorow there's Madara vs fucking 8 gates Gai</br></br></br></br>  The other threads got deleted for a reason.<br><br>Fuck off Narutards.</br></br>  <br> 3rd thread in 10 minutes. <br><br>You retards are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because you shitpost on them?<br><br>We just want to discuss, let people discuss what they want and they'll go away. Antagonizing an entire fanbase that has been on /a/ for years and even Moot said to leave alone is not a really good idea.<br><br>Leave the threads alone and there will be no new ones popping out</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You people are not from /a/. Thats plain obvious. Fuck off already.</br>  <br>Your fanbase is nothing but newfag tumblrtards.<br><br>Fuck off.<br><br>Also, your bad English makes it obvious of your identity from the shitty threads you keep spamming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It just take one click for the mods to delete all my post and he didn't do it.</br>    <br> reddit thread <br><br>Please no.</br></br></br>  <br>But we are.<br><br><br> Your fanbase is nothing but newfag tumblrtards. <br>If that was the case, which is not. Why aren't you on Yahari Oregairu- "Edition" threads?<br><br>People posting Facebook images, people admitting coming from reddit and tumblr. <br> I want to kill this fucking cunt! <br> Good Irohasu! <br> YukinoSHITa Yukino <br>I could go on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> post like retards <br> deviantart/tumblr everywhere <br> likes naruto <br><br>You are not from /a/. Fuck off you crossboarding faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And it takes one click to make another thread, by any of the anons here.<br><br>We're not breaking any rule.<br>1-It has an ongoing Anime, which I mentioned in the OP<br>2-It has LNs that are being translated<br>3-A new trailer from a new movie has been released, which I also posted in the OP</br></br></br></br></br></br>  every Naruto thread, same shit happening :<br><br> 2-3 old fags telling Narutards to fuck off <br> OP ttying to defend his right to post about Naruto on /a/ <br> thread gets deleted  <br><br>jesus</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you fuck are any better <br><br>I will always remember when you all were discussing that one stupid 3DPD italian whore because she was a Sakura fan or something.</br></br></br>   4 ips <br>Sure is samefag in here, I'm guessing he's the same fag that kept spamming dub shit in the other one</br>    <br> lol i will just spam more xddd <br><br>This is why no one likes you.</br></br></br>    <br>You are the worst since your are the one who shitpost.</br>    <br><br><br><br>You on the other hand are breaking rules, shitposting on /a/ is not allowed, you should visit /b/ if you like that. Or /v/ maybe since it's the same shit.<br><br>It's your fault threads pop up, because if you left threads alone and people discussed what they want then they wouldn't make another thread until new material is out</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot to mention how hey spend entire threads talking about some shitty naruto forum.</br>    <br> they wouldn't make another thread until new material is out <br><br>Stop lying. They will just make new threads until a mod stops them.</br></br></br>  <br>Except nobody does that.<br><br>Yet I see all fate threads linking to VSbattles wikia and Narutoforum threads talking about how Gilgamesh can do this and how Saber can move at hypersonic speeds and how she has city powershit or something like that</br></br></br>  <br>Said the guy spamming threads on /a/. Kill yourself, newfag.</br>  <br> mods delete thread <br> LOL BETTER MAKE A NEW ONE <br><br>You are breaking the rules yourself, Narutards.<br><br>You already had your shitty thread with 650+ replies.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they would not, threads were autosaging by the hour when Gaiden chapters came out. Mod left people alone, the other day there was no Naruto thread.<br>Mod started deleting Gaiden threads? There was new Naruto threads until people had the chance to discuss</br></br>  <br> Stop lying. They will just make new threads until a mod stops them. <br>Mods deletes the thread, because of your shitposting - spamming. The thread itself doesn't brake any rules.</br></br>  <br> Except nobody does that. <br><br>Thats a lie and you know that.</br></br></br>   all these elitistfags complaining about narrowtoe when there are people actually wanting to discuss it <br><br>makes me chuckle every time you faggots try to shoot these threads down whenever someone decides to make something that isn't best grill or flavour of the month bullshit</br></br>  <br>Boruto movie aside, the anime is still airing weekly. Therefore there's something to discuss. It's plain as day this mod is a hypocrite who uses a weak argument to hide the truth that they hate Naruto.<br><br>Naruto is a currently airing anime therefore it can be discussed on /a/. I don't see why you can't have Naruto threads when you have literally 5 Fate threads up, 3 of which aren't real discussion at all, 1 which is talking about a stupid mobage, and 1 which is just talking about shit that's already been talked about to death.<br><br>Then you have your 2 DragonBall threads, One Piece generals, Bleach generals (both of those have just as much influence and a polarized fanbase as Naruto), 2 Eva threads, Madoka general, Raildex general, and the list goes on. There are even threads that shouldn't be on here like waifus or lolis and even a fucking sad panda hentai thread when this is /a/ not /h/. <br><br>It's pure hypocrisy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except it was filled with that samefag shitposting lolis and checking dubs? <br>Which is also hilarious because shit mod deletes loli threads and new ones keep popping up</br></br>  <br>I love your /v/ related image too.</br>  <br> what is reading comprehension </br>  <br> Said the guy spamming threads on /a/. Kill yourself, newfag. <br>Oh boy, I'm not a newfag. I know how looks a spammer on /a/.</br></br>  <br> elitistfags <br><br>Hello, newfag/crossboarder !</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ never ever had weekly Naruto anime thread discussion.<br><br>How fucking new are you?<br><br> lol I came here when da shippuden ending last year </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you think this board belongs only to retards like you?</br>  <br> &gt;lol I came here when da shippuden ending last year <br><br>Except Shippuden it's not over, it airs every week.</br></br></br>    <br> doesn't know how to speak english <br> likes naruto <br> not a newfag <br><br>Am I being trolled?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>piece of garbage loli shit</br>  <br>its just meme<br>people shitpost hoping someone replies and acknowledges them so they can shitpost more hoping someone replies<br>then <br> hurr durr i was just pretending to be a retard </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're a newfag and stop posting like an arthritic Yoda.</br>  <br>Im obviously talking about the manga you fucking retarded battle shounen tard.</br>  <br>Fucking pedofile, go to your pedofile generals that are being saged by mods too.</br>  <br> /a/ never ever had weekly Naruto anime thread discussion. <br><br>That's not the point. Apparently somewhere down the line that stopped happening, and it became a thing to sage and shitpost naruto threads, and now there are even janitors and a mod, maybe more who clearly hate naruto and just delete it because. There aren't even consistent weekly episode discussions anymore.</br></br></br>  <br> complains about the panda <br><br>Nigga, we all know you are new as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br/>  Narutards confirmed to be ESLs  <br>You aren't trolled. I've spent here 10 years. I know that /a/ full of shit an yes, you are a spammer and threads are deleted, because of your spam and not, because it's Naruto.</br>  <br>The point is you piece of shit were not allowed on /a/.</br>  Keep shitposting on an actual decent thread.<br><br>All you're going to do is make people create another one when Janitor prunes this one BECAUSE of your shitposting. It's like you faggots pretend to be retarded</br></br>  <br> been here for 10 years <br> can't even speak english </br></br>   these people make a thread after a mod specifically told them not to make a fucking thread <br> the mods will delete "mean posts" anyway <br><br>This board has gone to shit, I want to go back to 2008 and shitpost about Lucky Star.</br></br></br>  <br>you like little girls because you're afraid of the big ones?</br>  <br>He probably can't enter the panda.</br>  <br>You're fucking cancer.</br>  <br>Thats because you retards are not welcome on /a/. Naruto has the most cancerous fanbase.</br>  <br> after a mod specifically told them not to make a fucking thread <br><br>Why listen to a mod who's clearly not acting like a mod and just a little angry child?</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to grammar school, Narutard.</br>    <br> look guise i know buzzwurds <br><br>try harder</br></br></br>  <br> Apparently somewhere down the line that stopped happening <br>What stopped happening? Naruto threads? Because they never did happen. They were never allowed on /a/ back when and people routinely got banned for posting it. Only recently did moot allow threads to be posted after dicking with /a/ for awhile. And even then, 95% of them were spam and off-topic nonsense. The manga discussion is fine, when it happens. And the new "trailer" has already been discussed. There is no need to have another thread literally 20 minutes after the last one 404'd.</br></br>  <br>A Mod told people to not make another thread if there is no new material and surprise faggot, there is new material.<br><br/></br></br>    <br>No it doesn't, check the generals on the catalog going on right now and check how the posts are. They're cancerous as fuck.<br><br>The only thing cancerous about Naruto threads is you with your loli spamming</br></br></br>    <br> Why listen to a mod who's clearly not acting like a mod <br>What is your definition of a mod? Oh wait, I know! Deleting and banning posts that tell Narutoshitters to go away, that's a mod.<br><br>You don't belong on this website if you can't handle banter without a mod coming in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The mods better do the same for other speculation threads</br>  <br>You are the one acting like a little child, though. Its weird how you can't see it.</br>   people think making a thread about ongoing anime with new material coming out is worse than every other type of thread made on /a/   <br>And?<br>It's not my native language so I never would be perfect in that regard.<br><br>You are still a spammer and an obvious one!</br></br></br></br>      <br>There is still anime airing though, and this is an anime board. Not to mention there are LN translations going on right now for the epilogue LNs and there are plenty of other LN threads on /a/ right now. That's enough justification to make a Naruto thread. Fine, you can change the OP to something besides Boruto if it bothers you, but there the point is there is still stuff to discuss in this franchise, the manga ending hasn't done anything because there is still other ongoing forms of Naruto media.</br>  <br> deviantart <br> retards who can't speak english <br> pissing on board culture <br> tumblr <br> /b/ tier posting <br><br>Thats way more cancerous than anything else on /a/. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean that Naruto has the worst spammers.</br>  <br> never had weekly threads <br>they would be up for a small while before mods deleted the thread<br><br>anyways /a/ on 4chan is a pretty shitty board to discuss anime, mods powertrip too hard here</br></br></br></br>  <br>The other threads are fine because they aren't full of this. </br>  <br>I swear to fuck, I tell people we need a migration, but they always mention "muh gamergate" and continue to swim in this shithole.</br>  <br>Be honest here.<br><br>How new are you? Because Naruto threads were always deleted on sight or dubbed spammed very and I mean it very rarely you Narutards were allowed a thread here on /a/.<br><br><br>Yeah so why don't you fuck off?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  64 / 17 / 14 <br><br>So do you people have... you know lives ? <br><br>Pedos<br><br>Narutards<br><br>In the same thread...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As if we needed more proof of how cancerous Narutards are.</br>  <br>No, it has the worst fanbase. See: <br><br><br><br>Anybody with half a brain would be fluent in english at that point. Just stop it already. Its obvious that you are new.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah so why don't you fuck off? <br>We're stuck here, anon.</br></br>    <br>That would be the right thing to do. Take your nardo friends and fuck off.</br>  Welcome to Gerry town.    <br> 4chan <br> fluent in english <br>Oh man, you're a riot</br></br></br>  <br><br> Are you saying I'm a Narutard? Because I just agreed with him that the mods here a trash </br></br>  <br>The spammer has no life. He already destroyed the thread so now it would deleted anyway. I rarely come to /a/.</br>  <br>You aren't. No one even wants you fags on /a/.</br>  <br>I've just been trying to understand the hatred for Naruto specifically.<br><br>As I said with mods power tripping, I once made a thread for recommendations because my girlfriend watched certain anime. The thread was deleted fast. Seems the mods want to craft their own reality on /a/, one where Naruto doesn't exist and people having real relationships outside of anime don't either<br><br>It's more of an insider club here, but if that's what the mods want then so be it. I generally hover around other boards and chans</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No, it has the worst fanbase. See:  <br>So far I only spammers who has no life.</br></br>    <br>Where is any of this quality in any Naruto thread? Despite what anyone asserts, Naruto-haters, or Narutards, both of them seem to think that the mods are against them. Blatant Naruto shitposting is deleted and narutards whine, and when a thread is up (like the one we literally just had, as I already mentioned) people whine about mods and 'wah my post was deleted'.<br><br>But the fact of the matter is nobody was saying anything in that thread that wasn't new. Nobody was posting anything new, any original content, nobody was doing translations for things like in old threads, none of it. Naruto already has set the precedent for a terrible franchise and fanbase, which is why it is looked at extremely critically, and nobody who actually claims to like it is doing anything different in the threads that stay up to actually make it look like it's actually worth the increased moderation that likely no doubt has to take place nannying those threads. Even worse, they're filled with low-quality images, gifs, and discussion with people talking like they're right out of /b/.</br></br></br>  Why is being Sarada suffering?  <br>Except we're just so much more and so much more relevant to Anime than you pedofile basement dweller.</br>  <br>Yeah I have no life its true.<br><br>Im enjoying my NEET life.</br></br></br>  <br> I rarely come to /a/. <br><br>Average narutard.<br><br><br>This can't be real.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As I said with mods power tripping, I once made a thread for recommendations because my girlfriend watched certain anime. The thread was deleted fast. Seems the mods want to craft their own reality on /a/ <br>No, more like you broke Global Rule 16.</br></br>  <br>Nigger, I'm not the fucking Narutard faggot.</br>      <br> Falseflagging this hard. <br><br>C'mon you're not even trying with your bait to blame narutofags</br></br></br>  <br> Anybody with half a brain would be fluent in english at that point. Just stop it already. Its obvious that you are new. <br>You are on /a/. No one is fluent in english here.</br></br>  <br> girlfriend <br> recommendation <br><br>This got to be bait right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> NEET <br> Pedo  <br><br>why live ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Venera-sama is the cutest.</br>  <br>Because her father is a huge edgelord and because Kishimoto doesn't make Naruto fuck her already</br>  Stop replying and post loli.  <br>You know, that description fits every other thread here right now</br>  <br>In that case, any old mangas or animes that have ended should not be allowed to be discussed. Obviously those threads never get deleted though. I don't care too much since I don't hang out on /a/, but the mods on this board are control freaks / hypocrites.</br>  <br>Why die?</br>  <br><br><br>Of course it's bait, he's falseflagging so hard only a newfag like you wouldn't realize.</br></br></br>  <br>hmm not into little kiddies m8.</br>  <br>To be a neet and pedo, why else?</br>  <br> being this new <br><br>Average narutard.</br></br></br>    Quick question, why the fuck are we even replying to the Narutoshitters and their threads?<br><br>The more we bump this thread, the more people are going to think we allow Naruto discussion.</br></br>  <br> He keeps falseflagging <br><br>C'mon son, stop doing it. It's painful to see</br></br></br>  <br>So what are the top ships for the movie?<br><br>Boruto x Salad<br>Himawari x Naruto<br>Metal Lee x Sakura<br><br>?possibilities=endless</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> why the fuck are we even replying to the Narutoshitters and their threads? <br><br>You do realize there's 2-3 spammers samefagging really hard don't you? You call narutards new when you can't even realize that</br></br></br>  Illya is the cutest ! And the Hottest !  <br> Why die? <br> NEET <br> Pedo <br> seeks out shit nartards treads to spam pedo shit <br><br>you have hit the bottom. why live ?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>every thread is request thread depending on how you choose to think about it thus mods can delete everything by saying go to /r/</br>      <br>You are spamming this thread, so now this thread is just for spammers. /a/ loves spamming more than any discussion.</br>  <br>Sarada is hotter than illya, way hotter. She's also not an OC from a GAME so it's nice too</br>  <br>Looks like the average narutard, though.</br>    <br><br><br>Oh lord. You know I use to be a shy guy who was too nervous to even look a woman in they eyes. But eventually I had to grow up and support myeslf. I'm currently 27, and I feel the mods here are most likely around my age or older. The difference between us being that they never ventured outside of anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself, narutard.</br>  <br>No it doesn't, it's just your old falseflagging. <br><br>Unless you mean the fact that shitposters pass as "naruto fans" because /a/ wants to put the blame on something for being so fucking shit?</br></br></br>  <br> hit the bottom <br><br>Well thats why im on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>Can I hit that loli bottom?<br><br>I also like Naruto by the way</br></br></br>      <br>It seriously just looks like the average narutard you see in other nurutu threads.</br>      <br>ah you see not everyone on /a/ likes little kids and is a NEET that seeks out Nartards.<br><br>  I visit /a/  <br> other people who visit /a/  <br> we same  <br><br>...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Pedo<br><br><br>No it looks like your average shitposter falseflagging to make people hate something you see in every /a/ thread</br></br></br></br>  <br>That one is pretty good.</br>  This thread's too far gone of course, but most of the Nardo threads don't really seem that different from all the other threads on /a/<br><br>I think people just see what they want to see</br></br>  <br>Keep going, i'm saving my H folder</br>  <br>Stop posting. You have no reading comprehension and you can't even speak english.</br>  <br><br> loli is one of /a/ most favorite shit behind tomboy <br> get triggered over it <br><br>Everytime with you newfags and of course its not a surprise that you're also Narutards.</br></br></br></br></br>  If you are going to spam, spam woman. pedo aare lower then scum.  <br>You are either blind or lying.</br>  <br>No one is going to listen to a spammer.</br>  <br>I agree with this guy, /a/ is just filled with a bunch of weeaboos fags. They think that hating on a good show like naruto is the cool thing to do and that is the only way that they can "fit in" in their own little niche because they are too autistic to form interpersonal relationships outside of shitposting on /a/. These inbreeds collectively hate on several things that they deem "not cool" and they circlejerk each other while having an idiotic sense of comradery.</br>  <br>its shitpost on narutothreads meme, and its always same 5 ppl doing the shitposting<br><br>ids would be good so you could hide every post made by the same poster</br></br></br>  <br>Of course they don't, the only reason Naruto threads get deleted is because of Shitposting from bored anons.<br>Threads are normal for /a/.<br><br>Well I don't really think narutards care too much, they can talk about Naruto everywhere else and it's just a fact Naruto is the most popular Anime in the last 10 years or so around the world, a neckbeard forum isn't changing that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah go fuck yourself.</br>  <br>I'm an oldfag and I hate loli threads. It's the biggest nonsense on /a/.</br>    <br>I have close to nothing left. My manga/loli/idol/doujinshi hdd died a few weeks ago.</br>  <br>Yet why mods keep pruning your loli threads?</br>    <br>Newfag is a tag you put on things you can't disprove or you don't like.<br><br>pathetic really.<br><br>hurr must be newfag, leddit user, summerfag, ect... lame.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> weeabo <br>back to /v/</br></br>  <br>Too bad.</br>  <br>I want prisma illya to sit on my  benis </br>  <br>Its not a meme, newfag.</br>  <br> ... <br><br>Fuck off newfag. Go remember to take your astham medication.</br></br></br>    <br>I guess I'm just not very critical<br><br>Every thread has it's share of stupid shit, but I've always just ignored things that bothered me<br><br>If a thread really does get bad enough, I just leave, there's always something to talk about in some other thread</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure? I was in the loli thread that reached bump limit today.</br>  <br><br> Falseflagging and replying to obvious falseflag </br></br>    <br> memearrows </br>  <br> not on your face <br><br>Pleb.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you suck my dick anon? you're a little 2D girl right?<br><br><br>Three loli threads got pruned yesterday, MOD just got tired of you spamming threads today</br></br></br></br>  <br>And I was in a Naruto thread that reached bump limit, how about that?</br>    <br> Fuck off newfag <br><br>come on. is that all you can call me ? <br><br>my boner is getting flaccid. need more hate</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stopped watching Naruto a long time ago. Is there a list of well choreographed and animated fight scene episodes?</br>  <br>And I was in Naruto threads saging by half an hour because of the huge fanbase we have.</br>  <br>Thats nice but that mean the ''new material'' has been discussed right?

Whether or not they think she's your 'fap slut' is irrelevent.</br></br>  Requesting Sakurako and Himawari from Yuru Yuri in another of their little fights, with both in swimsuits (artists choice from ref sheet), with Sakurako leaning forward a bit and wearing a smug-ass grin, having just shoved Himawari down front-first into an oversized wet dessert cream pie, with Himawari looking surprised/humiliated/shocked and soaked swimsuit and all in the pie cream.  <br>Enough for me, sure. But she'll just end up as a topic for shit-posting and will be black listed in-so-much that just mentioning her will cause an uproar.<br>Everytime I see marikafag post, there's "Horse fucker" stuff, and "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. I wouldn't be able to deal with it if that happened to me and my waifu.</br></br>  <br>Well, then, start off with simple requests. Her drinking tea, or looking out at the sunset on the beach, or wearing so and so clothes or some shit.<br>Then maybe after two weeks or three, you can move up and start to request other things.</br></br>  <br>Just don't request waifus in the general then. Pick a pair of characters that are in the relationship, and request them.</br>  <br>Ignore other fuckers. If she's your waifu, then she's your waifu. Others can try to judge you, but only you can say what she means to you.</br>  <br>I've been requesting for months. That's how i know it won't stop them.<br><br>I don't just want this because I want fap material. Ideally, it would be an erotic image of my waifu.<br><br>Thanks you. And I agree, but it'd still suck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No way your waifu would lay a finger on my waifu, she'd be on the floor in a blink of an eye.</br>  <br>Then have the balls to request your waifu, instead of asking for a random one.<br> Requesting waifu masturbating. <br> Who is your waifu? <br> Not telling, since it would make me look bad, but a random other person getting a picture of his waifu masturbating, posted in this thread for everyone to see, is completely fine! Even if he wouldn't want one! <br>Put some fucking thought into this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't thinking. Please forgive me. I'll stop now.</br>  <br>If you truly cared about any of this then you would commission lewds of her so no one else can see.<br><br>And you're Tsuyufag, aren't you?</br></br></br>  so whenever i browse WWD for requests to draw<br>there bound to be someone who just say "nobody's gona draw her" or somthin similar<br>so then i ask who's your waifu and they just didn't reply<br><br>what is wrong with you guys?<br>you want your waifu drawn then fucking say it out loud ffs</br></br></br></br></br>   boa was drawing waifus  <br> didn't get to request mine <br><br>goddamn it.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's that people are willing to wait patiently to have her drawn, but will bemoan the chance that it might not happen before the end of Sunday.<br>That's how I see it. They're too proud to beg desperately for it, and are more than willing to request and wait.</br></br>  didn't know mono was at EVO edition  Haahahhaja  What if the loser subplot is that you can't live in the hotel anymore and have to watch the FC from the slums  <br>Unless it's the Death Penalty it probably doesn't matter.</br>  Why did they never call Yusei Kingu  <br>Because the position pretty much stopped being relevant after he got it, it was pretty much created for Jack and it seemed to be recreated by Jack's dueling circuit in the epilogue, Godwin's dueling circle ceased existing after the dark signer shit started going down.<br><br>Also, didn't Jack call Yusei kingu?</br></br></br>  <br>There was no time to do it after the tournament and by the time they were in the next arc, the WRGP thing was happening. Also, Jack's kingu was more like a stage name they made for him</br>  <br>It did seem to become Jack's stage persona, but wasn't it said at some point that it was actually the same title Yugi used to hold?</br>  <br>If Yuya wins against Jack in the rematch, will they call him Kingu?</br>  I've been watching the WRGP arc for the past few days and Jean is seriously gay<br><br>Yusei tries to shake his hand and the motherfucker rubs Yusei's hand with his fingers and Yusei's like the fuck<br><br>And then that flashback where he tells the bitch to shoo and he literally calls her a bitch</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with that anon.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Gon will lose and be taken someplace who knows where. <br> Reiji will have Ninja job to figure out where they're sent. <br> Sawatari will join them later. </br></br></br>  <br>Jean is literally the worst and not because of what you said but because of stuff that happens later.<br><br>I just remembered the reason I hated the WRGP is that none of those fucking characters came back</br></br></br>  so where is Yusei does he not exist in this dimension? Does that mean Judai and Yugi also don't exist?   You'll never get into the card game for the first time again <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>I don't know. Here, have some Yugo and his sensei.</br>  <br>Yusei is probably a tops. Living the life with his mom and dad and banging his girlfriend tittyflowerrosegirl.</br>  <br> tfw Grandpa Fudo will never teach you how draw like a pro </br>  <br>Seeing Yugo act so much like a standard shonen protag all the time makes Yuya seem less fitting as a card game anime MC.</br>  <br>Yuya is trash</br>  <br>Yuya is a very different kind of card game MC. I really like it compared to how I saw him before the show aired and I thought he was going to be something like Judai 2.0</br>  <br>Then he is the cutest trash I've ever seen</br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Jack Atlas so much, I owned all his cards and merchandise <br> I pray to Jack Atlas every night, thanking him for the burning soul I have been given <br> "Jack is love," I say, "Jack is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a traitor <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Jack <br> I call him a jealous commons <br> He duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Blackwings <br> I am crying now because my pride hurts <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> A burning soul is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Jack <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "This is entertainment" <br> He grabs me with his mighty arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Jack <br> He summons a bunch of monsters in one turn <br> I have no cards but I do it for Jack <br> I can feel my field emptying as cards are destroyed by his absolute power <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Jack <br> He laughs a mighty laugh as he synchro summons his very soul <br> My dad walks in <br> Jack looks him deep in the eyes and says, "There is only one king! And it's me!" <br> Jack drives away on his Wheel of Fortune <br> Jack Atlas is love, Jack Atlas is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ushio once mockingly called Yusei king, saying that if he beats Yusei then he would be king</br>  <br>Beautiful</br>   tfw no blue eyes synchro dragon   <br>You have no face, man</br>  <br>there is no expression that can properly convey my saddness</br>  <br> &gt;I loved Jack Atlas so much, I owned all his cards and merchandise <br>It must suck for Jack Atlas fans that can't get a Red Demon's no matter how much they want it because Jack Atlas owns the only existing cards and Industrial Illusions refuses to print more</br></br>  <br>I wonder if they made a knockoff like Horus is for Ra.</br>  <br>I always hated his ladies and gentleman thing and still do but his by far the most human Mc in all Yugioh maybe at par with Yugi</br>  <br>Jaden is human; a retarded one, but still</br>  The guy from Team Catastrophe who went against Crow said "Nothing personal, kid"<br><br>Are 5D's writers memefags?</br></br>  <br>Judai is human but he's also incredibly stock card game MC. That's not bad or anything, its just how he is. Until season 3 anyway when he gets all the development.</br>  <br>Coldsteel was after 5D's though.</br>  <br>He is still the generic protagonist who win everything and with incredible luck but still i love his personality</br>  <br>He also had the coolest cards</br>  <br> stock card game MC <br><br>How many card game animes existed before YGO?</br></br></br>  <br>6</br>  <br> that "oh shit" moment when everyone saw the shadow hook </br>  <br>Well I mean in retrospect but I also meant regarding toyetic/collecting shounen anime</br>  <br>Your trash</br>  <br>He's not mine. i don't want it</br>  Who was better in Ygo bonds beyond time? yugi, jaden or yusei.<br>Personally i think jaden did better</br>  <br> BBT was 5 years ago </br>  <br>Wait a minute. So is mono not doing subs this week?</br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Yuzu so much, I owned all her cards and panties <br> I pray to Yuzu every night, thanking her for beating up my bullies <br> "Yuzu is love," I say, "Yuzu is life" <br> My mom hears me and calls me a heterofag <br> She is obviously jealous of my devotion to Yuzu <br> I call her a jealous whore <br> She duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Motorcycles <br> I am crying now because my father ran away <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> An enchanting melody is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Yuzu <br> I am so happy <br> She whispers into my ear, "It's all daijobu" <br> She grabs me with her crude strong arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Yuzu <br> She special summons a bunch of Melodious in one turn <br> I have no monster protection but I summon Odd Eyes Rebellion for Yuzu <br> I can feel my lifepoints draining as Bloom Diva reflects the difference in attack power <br> I push against her force <br> I want to please Yuzu <br> She laughs a gentle laugh as she Yugo summons Schuberta <br> My long lost dad walks in <br> Yuzu looks him deep in the eyes and says, "Yuya is mine now." <br> My shitty dad explodes in a shower of EGAO <br> Yuzu is love, Yuzu is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn it Yuya you cuck</br>  <br> her   hymen  intact</br>  <br>Yes but not until tomorrow or Thursday according to TLC-kun.</br>  <br>That'll do.

I coulda had a Ruri...</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the reasons why I hated that fucking Tournament.</br>  <br>But Yu-Gi-Oh has bishounen male cast. I mean that could have kept her coming back for more.<br><br> That's the sole reason tumblrinas love it. </br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry Yuya, I'm sure you'll  end up killing her by the end of the show </br>  <br>Have her watch Arc-V, maybe it's not too late.</br>  So, Gongenzaka will be doing a riding duel next episode right? His steadfast principle should keep him from moving around the course. <br>I would find it pretty  entertaining if he didn't move though.  Too bad the preview showed him actually riding.</br>  <br><br>Yusei wasn't obsessed over it and never really cared for the title. <br>Or maybe it's just a title Jack gave to himself, like I dunno, Undertaker</br></br></br>  <br><br> Fudo no dueling <br> not on a motorcycle <br><br>His dueling style will finally be complete</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>His name is Jean.

I mean this.</br></br>  <br>DIE<br><br>DELETE THIS</br></br></br>  <br>wow fail 2 times, good job anon...YOU HAD ONE JOB, that that was not to fuck up.</br>  <br>No faggot. You tried that shit on a previous thread. You aren't fooling anyone.</br>  <br>But Slifer is playable.<br>If its good is a different story.</br></br>  <br>Totally not interested in a really fuck shit crap of fetish, and I support the Ruris with their Fruits. Seriously though why everyone is so obssesed with this awful crap?<br><br>Though a little harsh, I prefer that too.</br></br></br>  Why is it always late at night when the one NTR faggot comes and shitposts in these threads?  <br>yeah i didnt know about that, thanks Anon-senpai.<br><br>  senpai noticed me :^)  </br></br></br>  <br>It happens twice, man. Genuinely not intended to happen again. The image file is right besides each other.</br>  <br>i have no idea, i think its stupid as shit what kind of guy would like his lover be fucked in front of him is a loser or doesnt have the balls...but thats getting off topic so here is the best girl</br>  <br>How cardfus will look with the Ruris outfit?</br>  <br>I'm watching you faggot.</br>  <br><br>Be interesting. It would just murder any XYZ/Synchro attempt since it would just blow up the materials</br></br>  <br>I don't know, how Northwemko will look for you if she was with Serena clothes after joining Reiji?<br> In my case I want Winda with Rin outfit because hotto pantsu </br></br>  <br>What is Superheavy Samurai.</br>  <br>101 and Castel in defense position :&gt;)</br>  All I want is art of Yuya and Rin  <br>Castel would still die. Only 101 would live.</br>  <br><br>Servants of The Man</br></br>  <br>The Yuus should switch Ruris<br>Yuya/Rin<br>Yuto/Yuzu<br>Yugo/Serena<br>Yuri/Ruri</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree completely.<br>I don't even care who gets Yuzu, I just want my Yuya/Rin</br></br>  <br>How funny that Ra used to be the most garbage one and now it's the best one while Obelisk is more splashable and Silfer requires an entire deck dedicated to it and it still is the weakest. I wonder if Kaz had Atem use Slifer the most because he wanted him to have at least one badass dragon in his deck.</br>  <br><br>samefag pls</br></br>  <br>Everything is going to be ok, anon.</br>  <br> tfw pulled this out of a Gold series </br>  <br>What are you on.</br>  Is yugioh even any good? I remember watching it a long time ago when it was first airing in English. I didn't even like it back then. But, I've since taken up anime and have been on a tcg kick so I've been thinking of picking it up. Talk me into or out of it. And if I do pick it up, should I start back from the beginning or start with one of those new arcs with all new people?  <br>An anti-NTR crusade. Want to be first on the wall?</br>  <br>Yu-Gi-Oh! is pretty great.<br>Every series has its flaws, but overall there's a certain charm to each. They get progressively more Chuuni though.</br></br>  <br>Arc-V is ok since it includes all the current summoning methods. Watch whatever you want, but leave Zexal as the last option since it is the shittiest series.</br>  Jack is a fucking traitor I hope to Horakhty he gets carded like the traitor he is.  <br>Traitor at what? He abandoned all his friends and past just to be the king. It's inevitable.</br>  <br>Zexal can be pretty fun sometimes. Even if it is regarded as the worst you need to let him formulate his own opinion.</br>  <br><br> Yuya/Rin <br>Where is this come from?</br></br></br>  <br>Show wise, I believe someone somewhere constructed a sort of list of "Here's what episodes to watch and what fillers to skip" so if you really wanted to, you could start at GX. <br><br>If you don't want that one, 5D's is nice as well, up to a certain point, people will say how the dark signers arc is very good and then everything after it is junk. Up to you if you want to continue.<br><br>Zexal and Zexal II are trash, one of the worst MC's, who has a terrible habit of turboing into one ace monster when his deck is set up to be able to XYZ into almost any rank.<br><br>As for the card game, it's alright to a degree? Depends on both the meta and who you have to play with, you can easily play free versions of the game with YGOpro (A program which is automated so you don't have to worry about things like when to activate cards or where to put them) or DN (Browser based, more manual but easier to get into on the fly and you can easily allow others to spectate your games.)<br><br>I think /a/ plays mostly with pet decks, so you could have some fun for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tumblrshits that want yugo and yuzu as a pairing but feel bad about leaving yuuya out so they give him a random ruri.</br>  <br>Good thing that Yugo will be inside of Yuri soon.</br>  <br>I don't want Yuzu and Yuugo as a pairing. I want Yuuya and Rin to be good friends because I want Rin to die in a manner in which Yuuya will blame himself and Yuugo will also blame Yuuya. <br><br>I mean, I guess it'd be a cute pairing too.<br><br>Also &gt;Random<br>It's literally the inverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just sad.  I prefer the NTR route. </br>  I want NTR loving cuckolds to get the fuck out of my thread and never come back.  <br>I should probably add at YGO is a bit different lately also because it's shifted more to archetypes and themes more so than random cards, to give a sort of synergy.<br>So if you wanted, you could add Red-Eyes Dragon and make a deck based around it.<br><br>Also be prepared to read a lot, YGO does not like using shortened icons or keywords outside of something like Excavate or piercing and sometimes it can get really silly with wording.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't really matter Yuya(Berserk mode prob) will prob kill Yugo with or without the NTR. Only time Yuya saw him, he killed Yuto.</br>  <br>Read the dang card, sam.</br>  <br>Nah, Yuya specifically said that Yuzu is safe if she's with Yugo. Everything's going to be okay m8.</br>  <br> 2015 still believing horakhty <br>get on my level and follow the one true god, Z-One.</br></br>  <br> implying commons can read </br>  <br>I'M READING IT<br>AND ALL I'M READING IS IT'S GOT LOW ATTACK AND LOW POWER<br>JACK THE TRAITOR IN CHARGE OF LOOKING DOWN ON US COMMONS.</br></br></br>  <br>Let me use that card, then.</br>  Why did Reiji appear so late in the arc? Because he  declan'd  the script because it wouldn't make him feel all a  ]Shaymed  when his best lancers got arrested twice.  <br> He uses TRASH cards </br>  <br>I usually approve of NTR. But this would be too much, even for a NTR fan.<br>Have some Stardust Warrior instead.<br><br>Sphere Mode Ra is like a super Lava Golem, so it's the most "viable" one.

Even if he winds up losing to Crow, he's going to lose like fucking Rocky.</br>   using Big Bang Soul to tie with a Synchro Spammer <br> using a Synchro to try and out-maneuver his best friend's tactics of Action Cards <br> karate-chops a monster with a blazing hand <br> uses a blindfold to find a hidden enemy <br> takes the fall so Yuzu can win <br> sets up Shun's first Pendulum Summon <br> completely reverses on Dennis just because he hates being called the bad guy <br>THIS MAN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if ra is the most viable then why is Slifer the most expensive even after reprints?</br>  Is this a game changer?  <br>It's /nosg/, which is a secret clubhouse you're not allowed in.</br>  <br>Not really. It's just the same effect Crush Card used to have before the errata fucked it. So now a shitty petdeck can cripple decks that aren't Burning Abyss.</br>  <br>holy fuck all these critias fusions look OP</br>  <br> Raigeki <br> Tiaramisu <br> non targeting removal <br> Destruction prevention <br>not really to be honest.</br></br></br></br></br>  Surprised at all the Red-Eyes support and Joey cards in Dragons of Legend 2. Surprised they made this card too, pretty cool.  <br><br>Too hard to set up these days or else it would be.</br></br>  <br><br>If you intend to go meta with them, don't.

I thought the generic characters were just a joke behind the great story</br>  <br>Because I like to make my shounen seinen. You should hear my headcanon about the Yusei vs. Z-one duel.</br>  <br>go on...</br>  <br>Fuck off, my headcanon is absolutely autismo and unless it's animated in some form it doesn't matter because you don't get to see Jack get pissed off and denounce brotherhood with Yusei when he lets him die while trying to save Aki from Mekanikle.</br>  <br>It's probably the same as everyone else's: Z-One really is Yusei, but a Yusei who gave in to despair, whereas 5D's Yusei refuses to allow Z-Ones future to happen, rewrites Cosmo Blazar Dragon into Shooting Quasar Dragon by sheer force of will and alters the course of the future, causing Z-One to cease existing.<br><br>The way 5D's fucking should have ended.</br></br></br>  <br> reminder that Fusions are an inferior race that are to dumb to use anything other than brute force </br>  <br> Cosmo Blazar Dragon <br>Printed, when?</br></br>  <br> Fusion <br> niggers of YGO <br> not Rank 4 tooolbox black cards </br></br></br>  <br> you will never see future-Yusei with a broken D-Wheel crying with the rest of 5D's all killed from fighting Meklords <br> you will never see him demanding the Emperors to kill him too <br> you will never see the machines just walk away because he no longer has hate in his heart, only grief <br> you will never get to see Yusei genuinely cry at realizing he failed his best friends and family </br></br></br></br>  <br>Who and when was this?</br>  <br> ruled by someone who's most likely a standard  <br> probably got into power by showing off solid vision  <br> their tiny Fusion brains couldn't understand it so they just assumed he was a god </br></br></br>  <br>Grandpa Mutou when he was a treasure hunter in his youth. Scene is about how he got the Puzzle in the first place. Also reveals that he was a master of gambling and made a bet with himself that if he ever lost a bet, he would give up gambling and become a game shop owner wearing overalls.</br>  <br> dat get doe </br>  <br>He's also a card.</br>  So I'm just realizing this but Shooting Star Dragon and Shooting Quasar Dragon were just the same blank card Yusei had, weren't they?  <br>I wish this happened.</br>  <br>Naw Z-ONE pretty much provided those cards for Yusei because he wanted Yusei to put an end to him.</br>  <br>It really did fucking suck when Z-One revealed he is a Yusei cosplayer</br>  <br>I think Z-One only gave him one blank card and that was Shooting Star, no clue how Quasar got made</br>    <br>Do they really have all different pendants or is it just something the artist added?</br>  <br>Only Yuuya has a pendant.</br>  <br>When Arc-V Yusei appears.</br>  <br>It got made with raw, undiluted Kizuna.</br>  <br>Fucking saved.</br>  <br>I think the manga retconned it. Japan has a thing about their heroes being villains unless they're fake.</br>  Lads, I'm bored, lets talk about our favorite Mongol-slaughtering redhead.  <br>She get raped again?<br>If so, picked back up.</br></br>  Who is best girl and why is it Megu-nee?  <br>Cause Rii's fucking crazy now, and you don't wanna fuck crazy.</br>    <br>Yuki and Miki are still easier targets.<br><br><br><br>I don't think it applies in a situation where everyone's crazy and you're probably going to kill the person or leave her for dead when you're done.</br></br></br></br></br>  I just power housed through all of the translated manga.<br><br>Jesus christ. This shit is pretty damn dark.<br><br>I also agree with OP, Megu-nee is best girl.</br></br></br></br>    No homu.
