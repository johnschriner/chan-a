Waste of chapters.</br>  <br>Oh yes because she is the ONE THING stopping the story from reaching its climax.</br>  <br>CLIMAX SOON</br>  <br> painted toenails </br>  How many more chapters until we get some progress lads? My bet is on  NEVER EVER.   Well, now that the Yui filler is finally over what happens next?  <br>it's just shading anon.</br>  <br>No, that's definitely not shading. Her fingernails are the same too. Shading like that is always much lighter in color. Even Chuunibyou, which had some really unusually darkly shaded nails, wasn't anywhere near that dark.<br>/autism</br></br>   Yui gone <br> Chitoge pretty much confirmed for winning Rakubowl <br> being a marikafag still sucks <br>Well at least we can laugh at the doormatfags</br></br></br>  COMMIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  So Yui was just introduced to show up for a little and get rejected so it could seem like something is actually happening right?  <br>Raku is still on denial, so nothing happened</br>  <br>What the fuck</br>  Holy shit that last page.   plot is moving <br>What is this shit, Komi?</br>  At least Magical Patissier is fun  Where were you when kosakishits were BTFO  Holy shit  <br>More like we are past the half way point, and girls stop dropping one by one.</br>  <br>More filler.</br>  A Chitoge shitstorm is coming. As soon as Marika gets dumped shit will hit the fan.   there's actual spoilers for nisekoi now <br><br>wow</br></br>  Reminder.  <br>nah. She explained to Raku that all forms of love of love are real. USED THE WORDS FALSE LOVE. Possibly enabling him to accept his feelings for Chitoge.</br>  <br>Pure idiocy. Senjogahara was chosen by the fucking end of the first arc.</br>  Goddamn this fucking bullshit going the Toradora route. Onodera bestgirl4life. Shitoge a shit.  is she gonna kill him?  <br>Onodera is not even best Onodera.</br>  <br>You do know Nekomonogatari happened chronologically before Bakemonogatari and Crab. He even had this "is this shit love or lust?" part in it, and contemplated on marrying Cat.<br><br>You probably didn't even watch beyond Bakemonogatari.  I understand, both series are shit harem series anyway. </br></br></br>  <br> You do know Nekomonogatari happened chronologically before Bakemonogatari and Crab <br>Doesn't matter, as Nekomonogatari is not the first arc.<br><br>No one would be reading Nisekoi if the first arc was him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened.</br></br></br></br>   there are actually people who think someone will win this in the next five years <br><br>Author's gonna milk this cash cow as long as he can by last-second asspulling reasons why nobody can win the Rakubowl, over and over, like he always has.</br></br>    <br> Doesn't matter, as Nekomonogatari is not the first arc. <br>Actually, it's the second arc, just after Kizu and before Bake. Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes.<br><br> No one would be reading Nisekoi if the first arc was him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened. <br>Not the point of the screencapped post though.<br><br>Kosaki was choronologically first girl, just like Cat. Chitoge was the first girl in the first season, just like Senjougahara.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually, it's the second arc, just after Kizu and before Bake. Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes. <br><br>But /a/non, the novel order it´s the same.<br>Nisio wrote first Bake &gt; Kizu &gt; Neko</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually is Bake &gt; Kizu &gt; Nise &gt; Neko</br>  People discussing other series, that's how bad Nisekoi is. Not even in a Nisekoi thread people want to talk about Nisekoi.  <br><br>Chronologically. That means the whole Cat arc happened before Senjougahara even appeared. It's the same thing with Kosaki. She was in the Rakubowl way before Chitoge appeared.<br><br>It's not about the what Nisio wrote first or what the anime adapted first, it's all about the story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is you said "It´s the first season that aired, yes" <br>Implying that the novel order is different and it´s not.</br></br>  <br> Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes. <br>It is the first arc, you dumb fuck. It was the first LN too.<br><br><br> Kosaki was choronologically first girl, just like Cat. Chitoge was the first girl in the first season, just like Senjougahara. <br>Yes, chronologically it is similar, but arc-wise it is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ONODERAFAGS BTFO<br><br>SUICIDE WATCH ENABLED</br></br>  <br> chronological <br> chronologically <br> chronologically <br><br> It is the first arc, you dumb fuck. It was the first LN too. <br>Oh yeah, it is. My bad.<br> Yes, chronologically it is similar, but arc-wise it is not. <br>It's settled then. This would've been alot shorter if you just told me this from the beginning, sheesh. Still not sure why you're so mad over this, seeing I've been repeating "chronologically" all this time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Autism.   raku giving a response in the same chapter <br>Holy shit color me surprised. And here I was expecting Komi to somehow handwave this plot and bring it up again in 100 chapters.<br><br>Especially when raku went<br> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS <br>I kind of expected him not to recognice the confession as a confession despite Yui basically screaming that she wants his babies.</br></br></br></br></br>  My favorite picture of Onodera  <br> I kind of expected him not to recognice the confession as a confession <br>And he didn't. She had to repeat herself.</br></br>  WHEN WILL I BE FREE FROM THIS CURSE KNOWN AS NISEKOI???<br><br>I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!</br></br>  Why the fuck do I enjoy reading this shit so much? Like I adore these characters but there is literally 0 plot advancement, yet this has taken the spot of my 2nd favorite manga. It just makes me so happy. Am I autistic?  I like Tsugumi's boobs.  <br><br>Nothing wrong with enjoying things, dude.</br></br>   fade to black <br><br>They fucked didn't they?</br></br>   178 chapters <br><br>You could have fully read several great mangos in that time. Think about that for a little while.</br></br>  <br> I adore these characters. <br>Well there's your answer.<br><br>Nothing wrong there. These are top tier girls for the most part.</br></br></br></br>  Holy fucking shit this chapter, JUST FUCKING FUCK THE BLONDE BITCH AND END THIS SERIES FAGGOT.  <br>He needs to set up a proper WA2 ending first</br>  Who cares if the plot moves or not?<br><br>Do you actually think it's a good plot?</br></br>  <br><br>No. I actually enjoy shitting on this manga more than I enjoy reading it.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like /a/</br>   f/a/ggots actually want this to end <br>I hope it continues forever. Make it a slice of life manga.</br>  d-don't mind me, just posting best girl!  <br>Losers not allowed.</br>  <br> Make it a slice of life manga. <br><br>Wait, it isn't?</br></br></br>  <br>So adorable. I literally got into Nisekoi because I got a postcard from my weeb sister with Chitoge, Raku, and Onodera on it and thought she looked so cute.</br>  <br> weeb sister <br><br>Did you fuck her?</br></br></br>  <br>it's clearly a adventure seinen</br>  <br>No t yet </br>  <br>I want to make Yui reach her climax.</br>  <br>the mangaka is really talented. the way he frames and presents the story, and the way his characters are all likeable and fun. the overall plot doesn't really matter that much in these kinds of series, but it's by no means bad. characters develop slowly. the dramatic bits never weigh down the manga's fun overtone but still manage to make you care about the characters and feel a little suspense.<br><br>it's a good snack.</br></br></br>  <br>But why'd you post Chitoge?</br>  <br>You'd make a good dodgy car salesman</br>  <br>I've been reading this kind of shit since the first time I read Love Hina on a cjb site. Nisekoi is really good.</br>  So, the whole purpose of Yui-nee was making that faggot realise he likes Chitoge. Based Shuu helped a lot.  I'm so fucking glad RedHawk are the ones releasing Nisekoi. Imperial Scans did a shitty job.  I hope Komi Naoshi isn't a faggot and makes Y-san win the Marikabowl in the manga  <br>Y-San is the hero we don't deserve.</br>  <br>Y-san mai husbando</br>  <br>I knew it. The shitty fucking tsundere is gonna win. Fuck this shitty fucking predictable as fuck manga and fuck you Komi.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED.</br></br></br>  <br>But I'm a Tsugumifag.</br>  <br> the shitty tsundere <br>I know you're just fishing for replies, but what exactly is wrong with a Chitoge end? Especially with the improved Chitoge?</br></br>  <br>I agree with all of this but Komi's blueballing every time plot progression is hinted still rustles me.</br>  <br> Marika gets dumped <br> implying she won't get killed off in a way that makes even dense-as-fuck Raku realize the importance of letting people know your feelings before it's too late <br><br><br> him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened. <br>Ah yes, the hit TV show How I Met Your Grandmother<br><br><br>Stereotypical tsundere twin tails always wins, first girl always wins, people not liking how they made Chitoge so shitty of a tsundere in the beginning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't deserve it, she was abusive and still in denial about her feelings and she swooped in first chapter. <br>Meanwhile Onodera has been loving Raku since middle school, worked her ass off to get into the same high school and is honest with her feelings. Yes, there is the entire spaghetti bullshit that Raku shows too but that's mostly the author's shitty writing to delay the series until Chitoge wins. In all honesty, Onodera should have won by now. Raku was about to confess before the series started but again, harem trope bullshit stood in the way. <br><br>In all honesty, I'm sick of this series, we know how it's going to end, so just Komi, fucking end it now so I can close this stupid book and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Stereotypical tsundere twin tails always wins <br>Well, there's always Saekano...<br> first girl always wins <br>Nothing inherently wrong with that<br> people not liking how they made Chitoge so shitty of a tsundere in the beginning <br>Oh come on, that's ancient history. And if people are so concerned about development/progression to the point of exasperation when it doesn't happen in Nisekoi, why discount Chitoge's character growth? That just sounds inconsistent to me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128196943 <br> kosako </br>  <br>Several reasons. Get ready for some tl;dr.<br><br>1. It's so fucking predictable. It's always the first girl introduced that ends up winning in the end so all this bullshit drama is completely unnecessary and pads out this sorry excuse of a story.<br><br>2. Because modern tsunderes are all the fucking same. They start off as complete abusive and psychotic bitches that everyone fucking hates and finally when they start warming up dumbasses in the fanbase start liking her while smart people remember what an absolute fucking bitch they were. It's pathetic.<br><br>3. People who like tsunderes are absolute retarded faggots. Their excuse for liking tsunderes is "It feels like taming a lion." No it fucking doesn't. The MC ending up with a tsundere means that he got pussy-whipped.<br><br>4. Because modern tsunderes are all fucking horrible. We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night. Tsundere initially meant someone who's initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time (i.e. Rin). This change of behavior is permanent, and that's where the classic tsundere type is different form the modern tsundere). Today's tsunderes are those that switch between hostile (and sometimes even violent) and lovestruck personalities over and over again to the point of being schizophrenic (i.e. Shitoge). Guys don't find that attractive IRL. We find it fucking crazy and steer clear of that shit. Classic tsunderes I'm cool with. Modern tsunderes are complete psychobitches. <br><br>5. Because modern tsunderes win all the fucking time and I'm God damn sick of it.<br><br>There. Those are my reasons. Yes this is tl;dr, I don't give a shit. I'm mad. Fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw you will read a chapter where kosaki gets rejected and suffers in this lifetime <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br> Oh come on, that's ancient history. <br>People don't forget faggot. And IRL, first impressions are key to forming a relationship. If you meet a girl and here first instinct is to act like a total bitch to you, then you fucking walk away and find someone else. Chitoge is a fucking bitch.</br></br>  ONODERA IS GOING TO LOSE HAHAHA  <br>That'll likely not happen, I doubt it'll get that far.<br>We'll probably end with Raku realizing his feelings and confessing to Chitoge and that'll be the end. If anything, we'll see the reactions and everyone will be happy for them. The end, happily ever after.  It's stupid. </br></br>  <br> I've never interacted with anyone in real life ever: The Post </br>  <br> several reasons <br>Did you really type all of that just now? You basically say the same thing in reasons 2 and 4. 1 and 5 too. 3 is generalization. And does it really matter what she did in the past if it didn't have lasting negative consequences for anyone? MC likes her and cares about her, he isn't playing the fake love game anymore. She gets along with everyone. No one remembers or cares if she used to DK except fans like you.<br><br><br> And IRL, first impressions are key to forming a relationship <br>I think you missed the part in this manga where their relationship began as a reluctant arrangement for ceasefire between two mobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That never happened.</br>  <br>Well then enlighten me smartass. Have you ever met and formed a relationship with an IRL modern tsundere?</br>  I'm a Chitogefag but even I can feel the sorrow that will be the chapter where Onodera gets eliminated from the run.  <br>Yes I did type all that. Bare with me, I'm an angry drunk. I'm just fucking sick of tsunderes winning all the time.</br>  I dropped this shit 5 months ago<br><br>If there is any chance Tsugumi wins the bowl i'm reading it again<br><br>Should i?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lel, get fucked kosaki fag</br>  <br>Honestly I don't care who Raku ends up with. I just fucking hate Shitoge.</br>  <br> We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night.  <br><br>Stopped reading there gr8 b8 m8</br></br></br>  <br> IRL modern tsundere <br><br>I've formed a relationship with somebody that has grown on me, yes.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm just fucking sick of tsunderes winning all the time <br>Take a break from anime then and start reading manga. Good ones. There aren't many modern tsunderes, or any tsunderes for that matter, if you know which kinds to read. And go easy on the drink.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it, why not? I've had Vagabond on my backlog for a while now so I think I'll just read that. Sorry if I came off like an asshole.</br>  <br> Take a break from anime then and start reading manga. <br>But Nisekoi IS a manga...</br></br>  <br> Good ones. <br>C'mon Ralph, you're not THAT stupid.</br></br>  <br>Post a pic then faggot.</br>  <br>Name 10 good tsunderes then.</br>   mfw I read this chapter. <br><br>It's really ending, huh? Onodera is going to lose and we're gonna get some kind of bullshit ending like in the one shot. They killed of Yui in a graceless manner and it's only a matter of time before Marika is too sick to go to the hospital.<br><br>This is too much. I can't take it.</br></br></br></br>  I don't care who wins as long as it's not Onodera.<br><br>I absolutely hate these perfect girls who have a personality of being cute and being in love with the protagonist. Add whatever to it, tsun, kuu, dan, fuck, just give them anything that makes me think they have a life outside of being in love with the protagonist.</br></br>  <br>There are zero good tsunderes</br>  <br> They killed of Yui in a graceless manner <br>She's a chinese mafia boss responsible for countless murders and human trafficking.<br>I say she hasn't suffered enough</br></br></br>  Im ok with Chitoge winning, Onodera's mine    <br>Raku's father is the head of the Yakuza.<br>Chitoge's father/mother is the head of the Mafia.<br>Tsugumi has literally killed people.<br>Marika's Dad is the head of the police and she uses the police as her personal army.<br><br>The only ones who aren't blameless are the Onoderas. That's why they're perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>stay mad that your shitty waifu lost</br>  <br>Onodera sisters are great for fapping to<br>That's the best I can say, they're like Snake from Gatari</br></br>  <br> Implying Mamadera hasn't pulled some nasty shit behind the scenes to keep her business afloat amidst all the competition. <br><br>Yakuza bosses are one thing but local business owners can be cutthroat as hell, especially in food service.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The only ones who aren't blameless are the Onoderas <br><br> Implying their bakery isn't a front for money laundering <br>Why do you think her mother had her daughter spend the summer with a yakuza and mafia kid when she was little? Normal parents wouldn't allow that</br></br></br></br>  <br> Marika's Dad is the head of the police and she uses the police as her personal army. <br>Not to mention he's corrupt as shit since he hasn't bothered arresting anyone</br></br>  <br>That means the only blameless girl is Ruri</br>  <br>Good. Neutral party only reading for ShuuxRuri here, but having the manga end with a paring that could have been accomplished the first chapter had Raku not been a coward is a boring ending.</br>  <br>even more of a violent cunt than Chitoge. At least Chitoge is cute.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>This would be funny if I didn't want to cry. I can't believe he's actually resolving things. Onodera is gonna get BTFO and the chapter is going to be horrible.<br><br>I can already see Onodera trying to look touch and then crying into Ruri's shoulder.<br><br>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This is not a good feel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How would you even launder money while running a bakery?</br>  <br> I can already see Onodera trying to look touch and then crying into Ruri's shoulder. <br>I'm a Chitogefag but, I just can't handle girls crying. Onodera is a cute girl and her losing scene will break my heart as much as yours.  It won't happen for at least another two years though </br></br>  <br>Shit, I meant to write tough, but good enough.<br><br> Spoiler <br>That just makes it worse. It's like knowing you're going to be executed, but have no idea when. It's that slow wait to death. Ugh.<br><br>It's gonna be as horrible as Hanekawa crying.<br><br>At least this won't be animated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this won't be animated <br>Don't count on that, Nice Koi is a cashcow. Sure, SHAFT's got Gatari and Madoka, but they have no expectations to live up to with Koi. It's a low-risk investment, and it sold decently enough, right?</br></br>  <br>Onodera didn't do a shit. She deserves losing.</br>  <br>She had so many fucking chances. She deserves it at this point.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how much it sold, but more than likely not as much as S1.<br><br><br>She told him that she wanted to kiss.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Kosaki haters use logic </br>  <br> He hasn't read the manga </br>  <br><br>Reminder that Raku falling asleep mid conversation is the worst plot protection Komi has done<br>She should've won right then and there but the arc had to make Chitoge less of a shit</br></br></br>  <br>It was about Onodera deserving to lose</br>  <br>Komi basically committed a war crime with that bullshit.</br>  <br>T-that's actually pretty accurate.</br>  <br>"eliminated"</br>  <br>But you will still read it.<br>  you know you will and you can't refute me  </br></br>   double arts gets canceled <br> people eat up this generic shit <br><br>fuck this gay earth</br></br></br>  Why am I even reading this shit anymore. It was so obvious that Chitoge is going to win. Poor girl doesn't deserve the rejection.  <br>Hey otter.</br>  <br> Tohsaka Rin <br><br>No wonder you hate Chitoge. You just have serious shit tastes.<br><br>Thank God many more anime and manga will fuck over your tastes. I just hope you don't post so much because people like you cry so hard every time and it's actually annoying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> crying <br>It'll probably look like pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck.<br>Fuck.<br><br>I didn't want to see this.<br><br><br>Fucdk<br>asfla;sfja</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Marika is going to win... right?<br><br>She is definitely the promised girl.</br></br>  <br>I finally found the proper face for this picture.<br><br> mfw </br></br></br>  Don't forget that Chitoge told Raku she has someone she likes. <br><br>It feels like she did it weeks ago thanks to the break last week, but in-universe it was like 2/3 days ago.</br></br>  I want more Paula Mccoy  Holy fuck there's some real shit happening in Nisekoi.<br><br>Can Komi troll his way back to status quo on this one?</br></br>  <br>Best Girl will be kill. <br><br>You may screencap this.</br></br></br>  <br>Reading shit like this makes me glad I'm an unlovable miscreant.</br>  <br>Where were you when we finally got freed of Tsugumifags?</br>  <br>Let us come together and pray.</br>  <br>It's worse than that, this isn't about cash this is about revenge. This is punishment. This is what you'll be reading in hell for eternity.</br>  <br>What you are even doing here? Tsugushit is 100% irrelevant now.</br>  <br>Double arts would have ended poorly after 80 chapters, anyway, man. It's best to just let go.</br>  <br> the way his characters are all likeable and fun <br> Raku <br> likeable <br><br> the way he frames and presents the story <br> best characters like Shoe and Ruri barely get any time <br> they'll never fuck </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> first girl always wins <br><br>Except in Kangoku Gakuen, but that's only because the author deliberately shits on manga tropes.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't.<br><br>It updates never.</br></br></br>  <br> progression <br> in my nisekoi <br>What the fuck is happening?</br></br></br>  <br> onodera is confessing <br> one-shot situation is happening <br> "onodera, i have to go to her" <br> raku resuces chitoge <br> "raku, i..." <br> "IM SORRY EVERYONE BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO BE A MAN WITH MY FEELINGS YET IVE ABUSED YOUR LOVE I MUST DEVELOP INTO THE KIND OF PERSON WHO ISNT SO FLIPPANT AND CRUEL TO GIRLS" <br> raku leaves for college, onodera goes back to america, sister goes to china, cancer dies, and the onoderas stay in shitsville to make cookies <br><br>Please, pretend like anything else will be the ending. I fucking dare you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are getting rid of yet another irrelevant worst grill.</br>  Raku will get knocked out and get selective amnesia, forgetting all progression these past few chapters -- I'm calling it now  <br><br> it's always the first girl introduced <br><br>I'll give you this, it's even worse with all this tug of war status quo bullshit.<br><br> Their excuse for liking tsunderes is "It feels like taming a lion." <br><br>Hahaha what? I like tsunderes because when they get affectionate it's cuter and feels like it means more than the girls who are just constantly affectionate toward MC.<br><br>Seriously though, what really matters with Nisekoi is: Chitoge is cute, Onodera is cute, Yui is cute, Haru is cute, Ruri is cute, Marika is SHIT, and Tsugumi is  best girl .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just can't deal with this anymore.</br>   people acting like Raku is picking Chitoge in the next chapter <br> implying we're not going to have 50+ more chapters of this flip flop indecisive bullshit so that you can all pretend like the main girl won't win </br>  <br> Marika is SHIT <br><br>Opinion discarded. Let's see who this homosexual likes then.<br><br> Tsuguturd <br><br>I fucking knew it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Chitoge wins Rakubowl <br> Tsugumi wins by proxy <br><br>Goooood. Gooooood.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsugumi wins by proxy <br><br>Tsugutumors are this delusional and desperate.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsugu-who?</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  I just got off the phone with Komi, he says Onodera will win.  <br>I just got off the phone with Y-san, he says that's not gonna happen.</br>  God these threads have turned to shit. Is this anything like when Kirino won?  <br> God these threads have turned to shit. <br><br>Been here since the start of Nisekoi. Nothing has changed.<br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cat btfo <br>Never fails to bring me joy.</br></br>  <br>I just got off the phone with /a/non, he says he dropped this shit and that we'll see him next week.</br>  Does that mean I can start reading this now?  So, wait, plot is happening?<br><br>Is Raku going to carsurf through a firefight, soon?</br></br>  <br>With Yuri friendzoned it's only Onoderpa, Shitoge and Marika left. Things should be getting interesting.</br>  <br>Marika's going to lose next.  Serves that bitch right for having the worst attitude among the key girls.  She's going to get sick, and at the end of that arc, Raku will say something, then she's going to  live . Next will be Kosaki. It's going to be Chitoge end. Let's just hope Kosaki will be able to properly confess her feelings.</br>  <br>She will, and they'll go out for a while but she'll notice he likes Chitoge some way or another and push him in her direction.<br>It's harem writing 101.</br></br>  Reminder that Chitoge is not a Tsundere anymore. At least not as the shitty one she used to be the first 50 chapters.  <br>I don't think feet should work like that.</br>  <br>Raku is more of a tsundere than she is.</br>  Ruri x Shuu chapter when?  <br> Marika's going to lose next. <br>She never had a chance.</br></br>  <br>Naturally, she's had much of her tsundere arc.<br><br>He has absorbed all the tsun that has emanated off of her.</br></br></br>  Who hyped?  Say, those flashing backgrounds in the OP. Looks kinda like foreshadowing don't you think?<br><br>Never read the LN so, yeah; Parallel world that combines with earth eventually?<br><br>And uh... GATE thread, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Either that or it's just a cool effect. Also, a reminder that the MC is the hero of /a/.</br>  <br> Itami takes the girls on a shopping trip across the gate later on </br>  <br>OP  is foreshadowing Italica arc which start today with the apperance of Itami harem girls and the trip in Japan. </br>  <br> I'm know that trip is going to be at least 3 episodes, I'm curious how cut up Rory's battle scenes are going to be </br>  <br> last time on Gate </br>  <br>just a flashy poleaxe swinging around and yankees dropping everywhere without any real apparent reason</br>  <br>When will best girl mage show up? Picked up the anime for her and have been disappointed so far.</br>  <br>yeah, I kinda learned not to underestimate these things after I got mind blown by the foreshadowing in Barakamon's OP. <br><br>I'm only updated in the manga, but somehow I get the feeling this is going to end up like Mars/Mundus Magicus bullshit in Negima.</br></br></br>  <br>today</br>  <br> yeah, I kinda learned not to underestimate these things after I got mind blown by the foreshadowing in Barakamon's OP. <br><br>what happened?</br></br></br>  Enjoying the anime designs, which I believe are closer to the LN's? <br><br>If only the threads didn't turn to shit every time.</br></br>  So I was asked quite a while ago to scan the last four volumes of the light novel, seeing as there aren't any proper scans.<br>Just got around to it. Currently scanning (at a very leisurely pace) Gate 4 (part 1)<br><br>Scanning the pages in order, so I'll post them as I get to them.</br></br></br>    <br>I actually scanned these at 1600 DPI.<br>Scaled them down by 25%, just to upload here.</br></br>  Is there a reason why Lelei and Rory were able to use magic in Japan? I thought magic was based on magic particles floating around in the special region or something.    <br>That's the last of the color illustrations (pretty few, no?)<br>I actually don't have many other illustrations scanned yet—only one more after this. So you'll have to wait for my slow ass to scan the rest of the book (though I might just skip to the illustrations just for you guys)</br></br>  <br>And—Guess I'll just do the others.</br>  <br> Charging like a bunch of idiots <br>Why did they still do this?</br></br>  Bike, bike, as fast as you can<br>You can't get caught by the Magic God, man.<br><br>Chapter 2, 3/16 parts translated by js06:<br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_2</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's a LOT of collateral damage</br>  Last thread <br> GcUKb19e </br>  ,126<br> “(Wow… We’re on a bike together. I’m riding a bike with a boy! Eh? Eh? What’s going on here? This isn’t a drama and it isn’t a movie. O-oh, no. If I’d known this was going to happen, I’d definitely have worn a white dress. Ahh…)” <br> “Um, Misaka-san?” <br> “Ah!!!???” <br> Mikoto had been speaking her strange ramblings aloud, but she rebooted a moment later. <br> “Ny-nyothing!! And what is that thing!? Is it alive or is it a stuffed animal with a robot skeleton inside!?” <br> “It’s probably alive. But getting caught by it is a really bad idea!!” <br> Even if the anti-crime orientation was underway, they were lucky it was a weekday. <br> Eighty percent of Academy City’s residents were some kind of student. <br> Even if the city streets were their stage, the odds were much lower that anyone else would be caught up in all this as the High Priest pursued them. <br> Mikoto tried to understand the situation using the severely inadequate information available to her. <br> First, she looked behind them. <br> “So that’s the enemy.” <br> “Right.” <br> “He’s trying to harm us.” <br>“&gt;I think that’s pretty obvious!”<br> “Then what exactly are we going to do!? If we do nothing, he’ll harm us, but if we keep running around, there’s a chance some unrelated people will get caught in the middle!!” <br> “!!” <br> (Yeah, that’s right, dammit. We have to do something!!) <br>Cute.<br><br> They could achieve supersonic speeds with their own body, so what would happen if someone set up piano wire and escaped using countless sharp turns? It might not apply to all Saints, but at least a few of them would self-destruct by decapitating themselves or flattening themselves against a wall. The Saints pushed themselves and pushed themselves further to draw out their strength, so using their physical bodies to their fullest was a way of triggering their own self-destruction. It almost made one suspect that the greatest threat to a Saint was their own strength and not some external enemy. <br>Kamachi nerfing Saints?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't need to nerf them when everything else is way above already.</br>  <br>Meant to quote . No idea how that happened.<br><br><br>What do you mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like stating that for all their abilities they're still "human" and susceptible to damage. Or i guess "mortal" would be more accurate.</br>  <br>The way Kamachi puts it, he makes it sound as if Saint's durability isn't equally proportional to their super speed and super strength.</br>  <br>Cleaned illustration scans when</br>   yfw touma lay awake at night wondering how he could have let those people involved in his encounter with High Priest get killed   <br>Outside of not destroying their own bodies with their movements, have any shown to be particularly resilient to damage outside of a high stamina? I recall most dodging attacks rather than taking them head on.</br>  Been out of the loop for awhile. Did Mikoto receive character development?  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Ahahahahahahah  Let's see to the end of this novel to find out. </br>  <br> Ny-nyothing!! <br>Heh.<br><br><br>No, her hair is about the same length as always.<br> inb4 BTFO, etc </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> starting this shit again </br>  <br>You mean did she stopped receiving character development? The answer is no.</br>  For you, there'll be no more crying~  Another tree-like arm of mud grew behind the mummy.<br><br>It broke out through the asphalt and grabbed the building.<br><br>He did not use it for defense.<br><br>“Ah.”<br><br>Just as Mikoto tried to say something, the twenty-story building was swung down like a tree branch. <br><br>When an explosive noise crossed a certain line, it actually brought silence.<br><br>It was like an intense roar blowing out the small flames crackling here and there. It was like a swollen star losing to its own gravity, exploding, and forming a black hole.<br><br>Existence that brought worry and hesitation would lead to nothingness when it grew too large.<br><br>This was the realm of impermanence.<br><br>It was the Buddhist path to enlightenment that the High Priest had walked.<br><br>“…Hm.”<br><br>A nearby crosswalk continuously emitted a cuckoo’s cry to warn the visually impaired.<br><br>An airship flew slowly through the blue sky and the large screen on its belly played some news about the Arrowhead Comet that only approached once every 1700 years.<br><br>As he swung down an entire building with his giant mud arm, the High Priest finally came to a stop.<br><br>He had caused a frightening amount of destruction, but he hardly considered that worth focusing on at this point.<br><br>His eyes were on the building itself.<br><br>He had swung it down with such great force, but it had not crumbled to pieces or split in two. The building’s structure remained entirely intact.<br><br>Of course, that was not due to the strength of the reinforced concrete.<br><br>This seemingly mysterious phenomenon had a legitimate explanation.<br><br>“Quite the interesting trick. Is that magnetism?”<br><br>“Shut…up.”<br><br>He thought he heard a voice from beyond the building.<br><br>“If you hadn’t done this, I wouldn’t have had to go to all this trouble. If I hadn’t done anything, who knows what would have happened to everyone inside the building.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>“Hah hah!! I see, I see. So you are here to save the people! That would mean you did more than catch it with magnetism. You must have added in a variety of tricks to make sure the people inside weren’t smashed to-…”<br><br>He did not have time to finish speaking.<br><br>He thought he heard someone kicking off the ground and Tokiwadai’s Ace jumped on top of the side wall of the building that was tilted on its side like a club.<br><br>She could not have circled around the building while supporting it.<br><br>Which meant…<br><br>(Was that voice a fake? Did she vibrate a thin metal panel like with a telephone? Even if she had supported it from below, shards of glass would have rained down on her.)<br><br>Something snapped from Mikoto’s arm like a whip.<br><br>It was a vibrating collection of iron sand. She first used it to sever the base of the giant arm supporting the building and then she sent it after the High Priest himself.<br><br>But…<br><br>“Watch out there. That’s dangerous.”<br><br>He sounded entirely unconcerned.<br><br>At the same time, the ground split open again and another giant arm burst out.<br><br>It pulled up another building and responded to the iron sand sword.<br><br>He did it all as casually as someone grabbing a chair or fire extinguisher when a suspicious person entered the school. That was all it took for him to use a building full of dozens or even hundreds of people like a disposable tool.<br><br>“This guy!!” roared Mikoto after she unintentionally slammed her whip-like iron sand sword into the building.<br><br>The High Priest did not seem to care.<br><br>“Now then, young lady. There are a number of ways to save people.”<br><br>“Kh.”<br><br>“The people inside this building will die without pain or fear, not knowing what happened to them. Isn’t that one form of salvation?”<br><br>As he spoke, the High Priest grabbed more and more buildings and threw them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even Mikoto could hold back all of this. She focused her powers on saving lives by pulling water pipes and rebar from the buildings as cushions that were meant to be broken through, but it was unclear how long she could keep it up. She tried to stop and support the buildings while fighting to prevent the “contents” from being crushed, but more and more buildings were piled on top.<br><br>She could not say just how many people would be crushed inside if she made a single mistake.<br><br>(Not good! If this keeps up, I’ll be crushed underneath it all!!)<br><br>“Dammit!!”<br><br>Mikoto suddenly swung her iron sand sword, but not to attack the High Priest.<br><br>She cut into the ground below his feet and sent him falling into the subway tunnel below.<br><br>“Ho?”<br><br>The mummy actually laughed.<br><br>He sank down with the calm of an old man delightedly and intentionally falling for the pitfall his first grandchild had made.<br><br>The dozen or so seconds this gave Mikoto allowed her to somehow use her magnetism to set down the pile of buildings. <br><br><br>Nice feats here. So how strong do you guys think Mikoto's magnetism is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This guy!! <br>js06, I hope the original phrase wasn't こいつ.

Is Zouken on meth now? He looks even worse.</br></br>  <br>He set the bar way to high for nyang and nephy.

Second is her in dere mode.</br></br>  <br> So how strong do you guys think Mikoto's magnetism is? <br><br>She's a level 5 doing level 5 things. If anything's surprising its her capacity to multitask to that degree. The more Kamachi writes about her the more embarrassing Nagai's anime adaption looks in retrospect.</br></br></br>  I want to get off from Mr. High Priest wild chase.  <br>I chuckled.</br>  <br> Othinus is comparable to Sakura </br>  <br>Nagai Space is a sin.</br>  <br> thinking she can beat an enemy that touma is running from <br><br>To be fair, she stands a better chance than him against any foe that doesn't rely entirely on an ability.</br></br></br>  <br>Misaki is Xavier</br>  <br>The fact that Saints and people on their level can exchange blows at all with their level of strength and not be instantly killed would point towards Saints having durability to match up with the rest of their capabilities.</br>  Mikoto in action is always good, but I dread the inevitable shitpostings from you-know-who.  <br>Rape worms when?</br>  <br>She is.

Could Accel accurately chart a course to the nearest black hole and try that?</br>  <br>Come on, anon. Let's not start that. We're trying to have a decent thread for once this week.</br>  <br>So it's retarded to think she deserves to die for what she did? Okay, waifushit.</br>  <br> "(Friction doesn’t work, busting his head open with a sign doesn’t work, Anti-Skill’s bullets and shells don’t work, and strapping him to a helicopter rotor and slamming him into the ground at over 1000 rpm doesn’t do a thing!! It all seems so surreal, but I guess a Magic God really is a Magic God. Even a Saint or member of God’s Right Seat tries to protect themselves from an attack coming their way. Even the #1 deflects the attacks. But this guy doesn’t do anything to defend himself! So how am I supposed to reach his level!?) <br><br><br>OKAY.

I'm a huge Accelfag but I don't see him being able to much of anything against this guy anymore than Mikoto</br>  <br> several people probably dead <br> comedy <br>it is pretty funny though</br></br></br>  <br>I was under the impression quite a number of people were dead.</br>  <br>  vectors of magic <br>  vectors of divinity <br>High Priest got no chances here</br></br></br>  So... Why Touma can't be just mediator but without bullshit mikotofishes swimming around.  <br> Touma doing all dem bike stunts <br> High priest fucking around <br> Misaka going magneto <br>Wow<br>just<br>Wow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was always under the impression he CAN deflect or learn to deflect anything, but if it's bullshit enough, he has to learn it, but if said bullshit can one shot him, it's over regardless</br>  <br> infinte power <br> immune to any kind of physical damage <br> Accelerator can't do anything to him, nigger takes a shit on logic.</br></br></br>  <br>When has anyone every tried to negotiate with Touma in good faith? He's wised up to that shit by now, I believe.</br>  <br> Check Google <br> There are no mutants with vector powers <br>Seriously, Marvel?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>A twenty-story building and a few more building stacked on top of that? That level of magnetic field strength should easily be Saints tier Mikoto's body may not be Saint tier, but her abilities sure are. In a way, she's is like Asuka from Mondaiji. Great ability, but her body is a weakness for being human.</br></br></br>  <br>Touma seems use to all of this</br>  <br>Misaka really needs to get her awakened wings already. Come on Kamachi, make it happen.</br>  <br><br> (? Oh, I get it. They were all chasing after Tsuchimikado and me, so were they all gathered to one side of the building? That means they might not all be dead yet!!)  <br><br>Touma has seen so much shit that a few dozen deaths don't even phase him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  check 4chan <br>  there are no espers with scalar powers <br>Seriously, Kamachi?</br></br></br>  <br> scalar  <br> Working against black-winged Accelerator </br></br>  <br>Well Uiharu controls temperature sort of. If my Grade 12 science isn't failing me that's a scalar</br>  <br>Guessing this is where her character arc that has started at the end of this novel will lead to.</br>  <br>I bet he saves Nuit Mode Mikoto for last volume</br>  <br><br>So much suffering.</br></br>  <br>Yeah this seems to confirm Mikoto is stronger than previously assumed. She's still not enough to deal with a Magic God. I agree with </br>  <br>Temperature = Speed of Molecules = Vector</br>  <br> Speed <br> Vector </br></br>  <br>Yeah I think we'll be seeing more Mikoto soon and she'll go through something that will give her her wings</br>  Anyone else just waiting until the translation is finished?  <br>How is speed not a vector?</br>  <br>Hard to wait when people drop exciting excerpts in these threads.</br>  <br> "Meanwhile, Kamijou held a thick wire in his hand. <br><br> He had borrowed it from the side of a crushed armored vehicle. As soon as he landed, he threw the end toward the High Priest so it would loosely wrap around the mummy’s neck. <br><br>Savage as fuck, i guess nt9 wasnt just for naught.</br></br></br></br></br>   Uho hoi <br> The people inside this building will die without pain or fear, not knowing what happened to them. Isn’t that one form of salvation?  <br> Uho hoi <br>I wonder how I describe my feeling for this charactor.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mikoto STRONK. This novel is shaping up to be great already.</br></br></br>  <br>She is likely the Accelerator of NT for the 2nd half of the series. As in one of the big character arcs.</br>  <br>She was always strong. Just run some numbers. Billion volts contain enough energy to destroy hundred B-52 at once.</br>  <br>Agreed. I think she'll shift away from Touma, though.</br>  <br> go through something that will give her her wings <br>Yes please. I'd throw all of my money at Kamachi to make this happen.</br></br>  <br>There's going to be a hell of a shitstorm when we reach THAT scene.<br> &gt;BTFO BTFO ship has sunk etc <br><br>Though if I read the spoilers and screenshots right, that part is actually something we've been waiting for a long time. A wake up call.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at it this way:<br>To be approached for negotiation is to be considered a threat. Otherwise, you would've already been coerced.<br><br>Touma's already realized that someone getting him to accept power will never be just because. They would've just dumped it on him.</br></br></br></br>  Just for fucks, Kamachi should give Mikoto electric spider legs.  <br>That scene is literally nothing. All it's going to do is motivate Mikoto to get stronger than she already is. Her personality will never let her give up.</br>  <br>  mfw instead of this mikoto will die </br>    <br>Reminder that vectors are whatever Accel wants them to be and that anything involving movement on a molecular level counts.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's why I said it's a wake up call. Now she knows exactly what Toums is up against, she's had a taste of the enemy's power, and she'll try to improve. Granted she probably won't get anywhere until Crowley greenlights it but still.</br>  <br>Reminder the question wasn't about Accel but if any espers had scalar powers</br>  <br>We all know that status quo end is inevitable. No girl is going to end up with him. Point side, Mikoto's ship hasn't sunk yet at all in NT13 if I'm reading spoilers right. Touma didn't reject her or sunk any flags that would prevent Mikoto from chasing after him. Misaka had a wake up call in seeing how she wasn't able to be useful in the way she wanted to (against a Magic God no less). So she realized the distance between Touma and herself in that regard. This basically should open up some plot for her to grow stronger so she can provide greater help beyond what she has done for him already.</br>  <br> electric spider legs. <br>Why? What would that even look like any ways?</br></br>  <br> tfw peaceful touma at rest ending will never happen </br>  <br>I do think the ship's over but I don't hate Mikoto nor am I going spam BTFO BTFO TSUNSHITS BTFO because I'm not a hater. However, I do think this opens up Mikoto for good development even if she doesn't get her ship. I think it will bring her into the plot rather than having her as a one sided love interest</br>  <br><br>Imagine a daddy long legs. With legs protruding from the back made of electricity.</br></br>  <br>She has long since realized that Touma doesn't return her romantic feelings, she just doesn't give a fuck. All she wants to do is help him in any way she can. That's why she's probably going to get stronger(hopefully wings) or some other enhancement of her power.<br><br> You don’t need a good reason to save a friend. If you want to save them, then save them. …I know someone who kept saying those stupid things even when he was driven to the brink of death, and he really did save over 10,000 people in the end. And that idiot that saved so many people is trying to save someone today like always. I know I can’t stop him. No matter how much I don’t want him to do anything dangerous, seeing him off with a push to the back is the sign of a good woman! </br></br></br>  <br> die <br>I don't think Kamachi is suicidal, anon.<br><br><br>But electric wings that crackles and produces biribiribiri sound is much cooler.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  scalar powers </br>  <br>When will Misaka ever be inform about magic? I swear to God she needs to fucking know already.</br>  <br><br> Touma dies <br> his friends and family decide to send him off beautifully <br> lay his body on a coracle and heap it high with flowers <br> Index and Mikoto push it out to the river with tears streaming down their faces <br> Touma peacefully floats down the river <br> coracle suddenly sinks <br> Touma comes back to life because MAGIC <br> almost dies again anyway because drowning <br> fruit cola </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> electric wings <br>but kazakiri already exist</br></br>  <br>I find it kind of hilarious how adding friction to the air is supposed to stop mechs in their tracks, Accelerator's author is worse at science than Kamachi</br>  <br>Wait... She doesn't know? She was literally told x told about it twice and fought magicians and even Magic God.</br>  <br>Iron sand wings that crackle with electricity?</br>  <br>That's not allowed. Level 5s have the most exposure to magic, but all of them are going to remain quite ignorant about it. They represent SCIENCE, so mixing magic is something Kamachi won't do.</br>  <br>She's been informed, she's just really stupid about these things.</br>  <br>How it isn't supposed to work like that?</br>  <br>but anon if she knew anything about magic she wouldn't try to fight HP and we would be deprived of this scene.</br>   people talking about Mikoto getting wings <br><br>We already saw her angel mode, she gets swordlimbs. Wings are Accel/Kakine's thing,</br></br>  <br>the moth stuff looked better than shit.</br>  <br>Well think about it, if it was he ground it'd be fine but making the air have friction is only going to make the air molecules not slide over things, so sure they stick to the mech instead of slipping past it but it's not reasonably going to be enough mass or force to stop it especially within a half meter or so I would imagine</br>  <br>  Accel/Kakine <br>  implying they will be relevant again </br></br>  <br>Add four more limbs and have crawling on the ground and she's a spider.</br>  <br>Kakine, sure. But Accelerator will always be relevant</br>  What if Mikoto awakens into a giant headcrab?  <br> implying Kakineball won't come back and try to roll over 15cm Othinus like the boulder trap in Indiana Jones </br>  <br> yfw accel has only been relevant one time in the last seven volumes </br>  <br><br> spider <br> headcrab </br></br></br>  <br>I have imagined Misaka's wings might be similar to Hyouka's electric wings. Since Hyouka is an amalgamation of AIM, she should be drawing powers from countless Espers. Her electric wings might be a result of an accelerated wing form of an Electromaster.</br>  <br>It's so stupid, though. Can't we have a story where the characters win by their wits rather than brute force power ups? Mikoto did well against the magic god if you look at it through the lens of preventing a much larger body count of innocent bystanders. I've never had a personal beef with her for not being able or willing to kill her opponents. But for some people that's the entire measure of a character's worth.</br>  Can a magic god survive Touma exploding into dragons? I feel like this should happen.  <br>well iirc she can only go angel mode by putting LO in a coma so it is probably a electromaster/sisters thing.</br>  <br> NT6, NT7 (well sort of), NT10 <br>I count two and a half</br></br>  <br><br>Oh anon. What is your fascination with electric and spider legs? Just curious cause spiders are seriously creepy  and I'm scared of them. </br></br>  <br>Othinus effortlessly beat invisible thing, so probably.</br>   we will never see the full extent of these dragons and no they are shit tier   <br>You can't really outwit magic god.</br>  <br>As fun as his stint in NT10 was it was pointless. Every level five turned the job down before he started and mikoto went any way. but as guess it still counts with NT6. He only had one scene in NT7 didn't he? Just beating up fake heroes.</br>  <br> Night sky, stars, and space are reflected of her body <br><br>I always love that sort of thing. You generally see that sort of thing from cosmic beings, which is always cool and a show of being powerful.</br></br></br>  <br>Does she not get any props for being the go to character when there's a science mystery to crack? I bet most magic side characters wouldn't understand anything about AIM diffusion fields or quantum theory.</br>  <br>Crowley, and ollerus did.</br>  <br>Does it matter? Magic God &gt; Dragons.</br>  <br>The air surrounds every last inch of it, though. It's like being bound to the ground with ropes; you wouldn't have enough free movement to create the force necessary to break them.</br>  <br> I bet most magic side characters wouldn't understand anything about AIM diffusion fields or quantum theory. <br>Nor a number of Science side characters, for that matter.</br></br>  <br>Without it we would t have had a scene from the Will, which I think was the point.</br>  <br>It takes another Magic God/Magic God candidate to do that.</br>  <br><br>If you've ever seen an electroball, I kind of imagine Mikoto's awakening to look similar. The body (the ball) and the wisps that attach to any near surface ( in this case the ground ). WIth that in mind, it would sort of look like a spider.</br></br>  <br> a mortal outwitting a immortal <br><br>Nice try anon, but that isn't going to happen</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the will scene was in NT6</br>  <br>Put it this way, stuff entering the atmosphere from space is in the same situation, but it'll make it a lot farther than half a meter before burning up, there is simply not enough air there to stop it that quickly.</br>  Reminder that Fiamma&gt;Magic Gods. Fiamma could also beat anti-Touma since he isn't a magic god.  <br>  ollerus <br>He was actually failure from day one</br></br>  <br> You generally see that sort of thing from cosmic beings <br><br>Well, yeah, that's what she was turning into.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the literal description of Nuit in the Thelemic belief system. Plus OT volume 3 had a reference to loli Mikoto aspiring to create a body of stars of her very own.</br>  <br>Fiamma is the new Stiyl so no.</br>  <br>What if there were more dragons? Like 7 more?</br>  Who would win? A magic god? Or a billion fire ants?  <br>There was one in NT10, which "reminder that Lo and Worst's feelings for Accel are fake" anon ignores (or he's just trolling)</br>  <br>We never saw the full extent of them though.<br>Why is kamachi such a bad writer?</br></br>  <br>No way. Fiamma is world tier at most. Magic Gods are universal and are from a higher dimension to beyond the beyond.</br>  <br>That leaves only asspulls and DBZ level bullshit to bring closure to any real conflict. I hope you guys seriously aren't hoping for this. My standards are a bit higher than that.</br>  <br>Fiamma is this guy who keeps upgrading his top PC but doesn't play anything except five years old games.</br>  <br><br><br>Rather than actually compressing the air, her ability is changing that actual frictional coefficient, so that they could theoretically have an unlimited friction value. Ie, all kinetic energy is turned into waste energy very quickly regardless of what kind of material is invovled.</br></br></br>  <br>Magic Gods are world tier too. Thats the point.</br>  <br>I know. That's in part what makes it so cool.<br><br><br>Foreshadowing or not, I don't think FC Mikoto is going to happen again. Nuit probably won't be realized either. The best I hope for is Mikoto getting her awakened wings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To outwit magic god you need to know how magic works or at least their mentality. Mikoto lacks both.</br>  <br>But she said it was only being applied to the air, and the mech was already moving, so to stop it that quickly even if you're going to say "infinite waste energy" the area around it would have burst into flames rather than simply stopping in one spot in front of her.</br>  <br>Only if they limit themselves to fit into the world. They have to nerf themselves from infinity to a ridiculous number to barely just fit into the world.</br>    <br>Billion fire ants or a guy who can create billion explosions? Seems fair battle to me.</br>  <br>I'd love to see Othinus in a pit of rape worms</br>  <br>Wait, you're talking about this part from Chapter 11?<br><br>She negated the ground's friction with the mech at that exact moment to make it spin, making its momentum scatter.</br></br></br>  <br>They can't operate on more than world basis. High Priest said this. Only one world and nothing more to change.</br>  <br>Mortal=/=omniscient anon, a lack of permanent danger makes one lapse of thinking things through.</br>  <br>what does FC stand for again</br>  <br>How would you outwit magic god?</br>  <br>Not that, I'd have to check for it but there was a part where she just stuck her hand out and it stopped moving and she claimed it was because of the friction</br>  <br>Not him, but to be fair Touma has outwitted him a couple times this chapter alone, it doesn't amount to anything and the High Priest is fucking around, but he still didn't see it coming</br>  <br>It isn't about Mikoto. It's about the cast working together to come up with a solution to a problem. Why can't we have this instead of a lame power up?</br>  <br>This, it is exactly how crowley got them and probably why othinus didn't remove the fairy stake early on.</br>  <br>Found it.<br><br>How much would this mech need to accelerate to bypass 1 meter of max-friction air?</br></br></br>  <br>Forced Connection. It's what happened to Mikoto in Railgun in the Level 6 attempt arc.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? They can do whatever they want at full power. Literal reality warp on universal scale.</br>  <br>We don't even know if it's possible without Exterior, anyway. If Mikoto absolutely needed a power up, Heaven Canceller, Kiyama Harumi and Will of the Misaka Network are the only ones who could facilitate one. Crowley doesn't want her in danger and she won't consort with a Kihara for strength.</br>  <br>I dont know about accelerating, but it was already moving at a decent pace since he was trying to attack her, I don't know the actual numbers but I do know that she's basically trying to say 1 meter cubed of air has enough force to stop the mech which sounds rather far fetched to me.</br>  <br> turns a battle against a magic god into reverse Road Runner comedy <br><br>What the fuck, Kamachi?<br>Are you fucking with me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I think more people need to realize this.</br>  <br>Kamachi is a shit writer don't expect anything form her.</br>  <br>It's great. I love his writing.</br>  <br>I never noticed this the first time, but:<br><br> Mikoto imagining herself in black pantyhose <br><br>Holy fuck my dick is diamonds.</br></br></br></br></br>   Misaka being absolutely shat on and being surprised about it <br><br>Oh god her fucking hubris, this is why I feared her involvement with stuff after not getting the talk in NT2. She probably still thought Accelerator is the biggest deal.up to this point.<br><br>Can't wait for the wake up call so we can finally move on from this shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> black pantyhose <br> dat girly dress shoes <br>Woah. I didn't even noticed myself. Mikoto is so pure.</br></br></br>  It was fun while it lasted. Thread is going to shit!  <br> Puts up a decent show against a Magic God <br> absolutely shat  <br>Bait too strong.</br></br></br>  <br>Please THK, just go back to bed. This thread doesn't need you.</br>  <br>I can't do it anymore, man. You win.</br>  Well shit, we made it to 200 posts before it happened. I reckon that's a record.  <br> decent show <br> barely prevented some people from dying while a bunch still did <br> HP isn't even trying <br> Even is she could mount an attack it wouldn't matter <br>there is no decent show against the gods.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We did it bros. Discussion died down anyway. See you guys in the next thread.</br>  <br><br><br>I'm serious, it's simply jarring to see the "science character acting like hot shit before getting shot down by magician" so far into the story. There really was no reason for Misaka to not have been present for the magic 101 class in NT2 since she was going to be in Hawaii anway, a lot of stuff would have worked better with her being well informed.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Birdway with brown hair</br>  <br> barely prevented some people from dying while a bunch still did <br>You're not even trying anymore. Mikoto practically saved those people in the buildings High Priest throw at her.<br><br>Geez, I know how you operate. I really should stop replying to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know what it is I just didn't know what that particular abbreviation stood for</br>  <br><br>I'm out too. Backlog keeps beckoning me. It's about time I answer it.</br></br>  <br> I really should stop replying to you <br>You really should. Remember UnLucky?</br></br>  <br>She accomplished more than anyone at that meeting would have. Apparently saving lives isn't important. Accel and Mugino would have been just as ineffective, but wouldn't have given a fuck about bystanders.</br>  <br>Did any of her attacks have an effect on him? If not she didn't do well, she only lives because he chose to keep fucking with her.</br>  <br> Accel and Mugino would have been just as ineffective, but wouldn't have given a fuck about bystanders. <br>Did you forget accel protecting everyone in his fight with kakine? He would have tried and considering all his bullshit he might have done better. Mugino has been on a nice streak but either way she probably couldn't save anyone.</br></br>  <br>Accelerator would care but Mugino wouldn't and couldn't save them even if she did</br>  <br><br>At this point even lives don't really matter anymore, the High Priest can fix all the damage he's done if he feels like it. Magic gods are only good for chatting, not being a threat.</br></br>   Replying multiple times <br> Downplaying at any conceivable angle <br> Being unreasonable while fully knowing the enemy is a Magic God <br>The sudden shift in discussion is so noticeable.</br></br></br>  <br> Accel doesn't give a fuck about bystanders <br>That's why you'll always be a second class villain</br></br>   was for    actually engaging it in conversation <br>When will you tards learn to NOT REPLY?</br>  <br>I guess Mikoto should just kill herself since she's not capable of feats 99% of the rest of the cast also aren't capable of.<br><br><br>Regardless of your personal feelings, I bet Touma has a fuck ton of respect for Mikoto after watching her do all that. She may feel like she came up short, but she was proactive enough to prevent a worst case scenario. Your standards are way too fucking high.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd hardly call crowley mortal at this point</br>  <br> I bet Touma has a lot of respect for her <br>I mean, all he did was say "I told you so" and grab her so I doubt it, it's probably about the same as normal</br></br>  In an hour I'll come back to this thread and ctrl+F "delusional" + "Mikotofags" to get a dozen hits.  <br>This. I'd bet 98% of Mikoto shitposting is just for the guaranteed replies</br>  <br>pull you head out of mikoto's ass. I merely commented on you saying accel wouldn't care about innocent bystanders and couldn't do any better despite having a far more dynamic power.</br>  <br>Can't help it Mikotofags are THAT stupid.</br>  <br>Except Accelerator would care and would do better if only marginally so you're wrong regardless</br>  Man I haven't used this in a while.  I'm just wondering why Touma is running.<br>He knows running won't do anything, he also knows he has no way to fight back.<br>The only way for him to defeat a Magic God is with a frank discussion. Touma should just talk him to death. Actually, that might be the best solution. <br>I think Touma could be able to convince the Magic Gods to kill themselves. <br><br>But I guess it wouldn't make a for a good NT. Oh well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reread his post and try again</br>  <br>Oops I misread your comment ignore</br>  <br>The point is nobody did well against HP, including mikoto. You're going to claim her preventing deaths is a plus but at the same time HP probably would be chucking building if she kept running like touma said instead of trying to fight him. She had the best intentions but it ended up with the same results she said just running would have, more people got dragged into it.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br> probably would be chucking building <br>probably wouldn't be</br></br>  <br><br>Had he kept a cool head, he would have realized that accepting the deal on the condition of keeping the world as it is was a totally valid idea. It's like his brain turned off after heard "perfect world"</br></br>  <br>He's avoiding answering is what it comes down to basically, sure he can only discuss with them but he doesn't have any options currently available that he likes so he's putting off giving an answer. I doubt he could convince them to kill themselves or that he would do it, but if spoilers are to be believed his running around wildly does work out for him eventually</br>  <br>I wonder how touma is suppose to know what problems are natural coincidences and what is caused by magic gods existing. Minor reality warping could keep it from being the magic god puppet show. Although considering what he said using their powers at all even to fix things might cause other problems because they would be putting there power into the world again.</br>  <br> It's about the cast working together to come up with a solution to a problem. <br><br>That's what's happening right now, except its pretty much all Touma. Mikoto doesn't know what the fuck is going on and can't offer much in terms of raw power OR wits because she just doesn't know how to apply them. Sure, she handled the building situation well, but that situation wouldn't have happened in the first place if she listened to Touma. <br><br>She's been fighting with her head dunked in AC kool-aid for a long time now and that just doesn't cut it anymore. She either needs to pull it out and learn so she can compensate, or get a big powerup so her blind flailing will start working again.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does everyone being happy immediately amount to everyone being puppets/fishes/prisoners? Does he think people suffering or having memories of having suffered makes everything "real"? Is he just determined to think happiness that isn't brought by his fist is bad?  <br>Purple is my way of life.</br>  Alright folks, settle down. Let's all take a break with...<br><br>B/a/thtime with Laura!<br>*fanfare*<br><br>Please join me in welcoming our dear Archbishop, the lovely Laura Stuart!<br>(applause, cheers and whoops)<br>(a bathtub is wheeled in full of steaming water and Laura is inside it, waving merrily)<br><br>And how are you this evening, Laura?<br> Very tolerable, thank you! Oh what a crowd we have tonight! You are all wonderful people. <br>(more cheers)<br>Haha, is wonderful the first word that came to your mind?<br> Actually no. "Easily manipulated" is more like it. <br>(laughter)<br><br>Your cheek is impeccable as always. Now, what have you brought in today?<br> WELL, I've recently purchased a 17th century Bavarian treasure on the market. <br>(oohs)<br>On the market, you say?

I was never on the rocker to begin with.<br> No doubt. <br>So tell us more about your new bathtub. What about it attracted you?<br> It has this very elaborate floral pattern around the side. Painted in fine brush strokes, every leaf and wisp on the flower stalks and vines. The gold rim and clawed feet are standard fare, of course, but painted designs left intact are rather hard to come by. <br>And why is that?<br> Colors fade, surfaces get chipped from bumps and scrapes. I have tubs I never bathe in because if I got inside them, they would in all likelihood fall apart. I keep them intact with magic. But this one is sturdy and with minimal damage. Best bargain we ever made! <br><br>Am I right in assuming that you've used it already?<br> Quite. The interior was somewhat narrow for my taste... but I felt regal, I really did. It was a grand experience. <br>"Was"?<br> One of my boys accidentally tripped over it this past weekend. <br>(groans from the crowd)<br>Goodness. Nothing hurt, I hope?<br> A sizable piece on the rim, chipped! Thankfully the crack didn't reach the flowers. <br>I meant your employee...<br>(laughter)<br> Oh, him? I had him sent to the Tower. <br>(laughter mixed with some groans)<br>Wow. That's a bit harsh, isn't it?<br> Not at all. A few hours hanging from his ankles won't hurt him. <br>(laughter)<br> And might I remind you that this was, after all, a Bavarian treasure. <br>From the sixteenth century. I quite understand.<br> SEVENTEENTH, dear. <br>(laughter and cheers)<br><br>Haha... we'll be right back after the commercial, folks! Stay tuned, we'll be right back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically people should create their happiness by themselves not by some phony god blessing.</br>  <br>Suicide</br>  <br>Shot</br>  <br/>  <br>He drowns in Laura's bathtub.</br>  <br>The TouMAN is gritty as fuck now.

They get off to Cure Sword. <br>This is amazingly true.</br></br>    <br>Mai is way hotter than Honoka.</br>  <br>Giggling like a loon at this.</br>    <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/PZYirKZe6Ns  [ ]<br>obligatory</br></br></br>  <br>Okay what is the common factor between this trio? Something to do with janken?</br>  []Kid<br>[]Squid</br>  <br>How many dicks taken.</br>      <br>I like how Sharuru got kicked out.</br>  Oh good, another image basically explaining Yes.  <br>Class presidents?</br>  <br>correct</br>  <br><br>What the heck happened to my image?</br></br>  I want to witness this unfolding.  <br> everyone is crazy except me </br>  <br> everyone is way more attractive than me </br>  <br>Everyone is from an entertaining show but me.</br>  <br><br> Mana <br> Doki <br> More attractive than anyone/entertaining than Yes! 5 <br>Shit taste detected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mana is very sexy and sexual<br><br>Karen is just Proto Reika</br></br></br>  <br>Doki is bad because it crashed and burned from being entertaining. Yes was just boring.</br>  <br/>  <br>Cure Heart is sexy not Mana and even then Karen is still better looking.<br><br><br>Doki is bad because it had a shit ending and focused too much on the worst character in the show. Yes! 5 wasn't boring that was GoGo!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're probably too busy doing the Gopri movie right now.</br></br>  <br>I get the two mixed up. Which had the best character AKA Miss Pic Related?</br>  Erika is the only one I need.  <br>GoGo! Which sucks because it's so boring compared to other seasons and on top of that it barely focused on the plot which wouldn't be a problem except Smile! also barely focused on the plot but that series is actually entertaining/good.</br>  <br>Nah. GoGo is great.</br>  <br>That's a lot of opinions stated as fact in that run-on sentence that continues going on for a lot longer than one would expect based on normal grammar conventions which we typically try to adhere to on this website even though its pretty clear that you're not making a whole lot of effort to do so or to keep the quality standards of your posts above any sort of standard deviation of post quality while the rest of us are over here using real punctuation in our shitposts.</br>  <br>I won't say anything about Smile, but Gogo was all about collecting randomly appearing things and taking care of the Kings. There was plenty of plot with that, plus the deal with Coco and Nuts becoming kings themselves, plus Syrup and his double-crossing. Then there were the villains who were in a corporation again with Bumbee trying to find his way and Anachondy or whoever falling for the big bad and what effects taht had on their organization. It had oodles of plot.</br>  <br>Smile is cool because even though the plot resets half way through the individual episodes hold up due to the strong personalities and characterization on both the Cure side and the Bad End crew.</br>  Stop arguing and post NICE pics instead!  <br>Okay.</br>  <br>Okay. Who would you rather be in this situation?</br>  <br>Honestly I don't know why anyone is expecting plot in these shows. GoGo and Smile were both good as plotless precure shows. GoGo had at least a couple of episodes that would just be just later redone in Smile, usually not as well executed. <br><br>GoGo was actually more entertaining than Yes5 itself in my opinion. But it had a 10 episode period where I did want to give up. Oh well, better than Max Heart's 45 episode period of that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No! My favorite season is better than your favorite season!</br></br>  <br>The one holding the lovely Haru, of course!</br>   the person who wrote the lost magical frog, santa, first onpu's dad episode, onpu's mom episode, seki-sensei's boyfriend, nishizawa bonding, momoko goes to the tv station and the hana's adventure episodes also wrote this <br>Do all of these make up for the one single episode that is distinctly shit?<br><br>The girl isn't even mean about people who don't follow the rules, she just asks them to remember next time and people talk shit behind her back about her wanting them to follow the rules.<br><br>what the hell does a fucking baby know about rules or morality<br>fuck you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up and Praise the Sun already.</br>  <br>What exactly is so great about it?<br><br><br>The only opinions in there are that GoGo! sucks and that Smile! is good. Which, ya know, are obviously opinions. Not to mention that wasn't a run-on sentence. That was two separate sentences with one of them being longer than the other.<br><br><br>Most of that isn't plot though? The plot is about them finding the rulers and then getting to the Cure Rose Garden and finding the rulers didn't happen often because there were only four of them and so there was a lot of padding.<br><br><br>This is true but I don't know what it has to do with my post.<br><br><br>Haruka. I want to be held by Minami.<br><br><br>Honestly I gave up on expecting plot after the disaster that was Dokidoki! Precure. What I do expect though is for the episodes that don't relate to the plot to be halfway entertaining which most of GoGo! wasn't for me. I thought the plot episodes were really good but a lot of the time I was bored by everything else and had to force myself to keep going with GoGo! which is weird because I've never had to do that with anything else. Thank Blue that I'm not even bothering with the first two seasons since from what I hear those are awful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Is that Shibe forming on her left elbow? </br></br>  Hime or Erika?  <br>Not even a question.</br>  <br> Thank Blue that I'm not even bothering with the first two seasons since from what I hear those are awful. <br>You know, I was going to spend some time writing a serious response, but you can take your delusions and preconceptions and hate right out the door with you.</br></br>  <br><br>What the FUCK are these?

But everything else is true..</br>  <br><br>That's right. Antidepressants are for Rinfags.</br></br>  everyone knows hibiki is da bes cure  <br><br><br>Futari wa and Maxheart weren't bad per se. If anything, I'd say Splash Star was inherently awful for a multitude of reasons but I think to get the entire Precure experience you need to watch them all at some point or another. When I decided to start Precure I chose to work my way through airing order even though I knew I wouldn't like the first three seasons very much simply because they weren't the bright, FUN magical girl shows I'm used to watching. And yeah, there were a ton of times where I just wanted the shit to end but they all had good points (some more than others) and now that I'm to the more FUN seasons, I think I appreciate them more than if I'd just skipped right to them. <br><br> Almost done with GoGo. ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  free software <br>Are you so poor?</br></br>  <br>those last 18 episodes tho</br>  <br>I don't pay other people to flip switches in my house for me. Why would I pay them to do so a bit faster in my computer?</br>  <br>Splash Star was the last one I watched and I thought it was ballin as hell.</br>  <br><br>I wont deny that it picked up towards the end but (imo) Saki and Mai were the most boring protagonists I've ever laid eyes on and the entire thing with Kaoru and Michiru was so shoehorned in that I just couldn't help but roll my eyes. The one thing I truly enjoyed about SS was the DBZ like finale. It was pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>See I heard Splash Star was better than both Futari Wa seasons both here and on Tumblr so I decided to watch that instead. What exactly makes you say it's awful?</br>  <br><br>Obviously theres a huge difference in taste here but if you liked Splash Star that much then honestly you might enjoy the first two seasons as well.</br></br>  <br>Seen them all. <br><br><br>Agreed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree that Mai was nothing special, but Saki just seemed like a better Nagisa to me.</br>    <br><br>My biggest complaint was that Saki and Mai were pretty much carbon copies of Nagisa and Honoka and as such, the season followed a very predictable formula. Thats not to say that Precure as a whole isn't predictable, because it is, but its extra noticeable going from Futari wa's two seasons straight to SS that its almost the same story but with slightly different characters. Plus, Saki and Mai were pretty boring in and of themselves. But I'm the type of person who loves huge casts, the more characters there are the more fun I'm likely to have so only having two or three girls interacting for 50+ episodes gets boring really fast for me. All I know is that when I finally got to Yes! I was so relieved to not only have five main characters but also girls who could transform by themselves, because that also got kind of old.</br></br>  <br>Nagisa=Hibiki&gt;Saki<br>mind you i'm still very fond of saki<br><br><br>Not him but Splash Star starts out as a watered down version of the original, which compounds which such wonderfully entertaining episodes as 'oh shit i spilled stuff on your book'. but it gets much better after a while.<br> tumblr </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily Minamin!!  <br>Ah. Obviously I haven't seen the first two seasons but I thought Saki and Mai were pretty good on their own. What exactly makes them boring for you outside of their statuses as 'carbon copies of Nagisa and Honoka?'<br><br><br>When would you say it got better? It was the first one I watched after I finished Suite and Heartcatch (which were my first two seasons that I watched after I got into the franchise during Smile!) but I thought it was pretty good starting with episode 8 or so.<br><br>Also Tumblr is still better than the livejournal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never seen anyone justify the "carbon copy" argument, and it's just not true in Saki's case. The personalities are completely opposite. The archetypes are similar. That's about the end of it.</br>  <br>For me, when Dorodoron shows up. Absolutely adore him, did not expect he would have that voice when i watched the 2nd ED before I started the show. the Ms. Shitatare arc is a bit of a dip for me, although I do like a lot of her monsters, especially the summer festival water balloon one. Then Kintolesky shows up and it's smooth sailing.<br><br>people use livejournal?</br></br></br>  <br>Dorodoron shows up pretty late (more than 1/4h of a way through the show) though. Why would you say it doesn't pick up until then/what kept you watching up until that point?</br>  <br><br>Well, the thing I liked about Nagisa was that she was what I'd call realistically genki. Her general mood was upbeat but there were times where she'd be pissy or sad which was a good balance for Honoka's constant state of pleasantness. Saki didn't really have an off switch and Mai was the same constant state of pleasantness as Honoka so for me it was just TOO MUCH positive energy between only two girls for 48 episodes. Like, its the same scenario episode after episode, a little argument or clash in personalities would have been refreshing but even when Saki ruined Mai's sketchbook there were no noteworthy reactions from either of them. I dunno', maybe if I'd watched something between Max Heart and SS I'd feel differently but as it is, I'd definitely say its my least favorite season by a long shot.</br></br>  <br><br>Funnily enough, for me it was Shitatare's appearance that marked the somewhat enjoyable portion of SS for me. She was fun and it seemed like the story/animation got a little bit more kooky at that point.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't call it that late, considering he shows up in ep 14 in a 49 ep show.<br>Despite my statement of SS being a watered down version of the original, in many ways it felt like a step up from season 2, which is loaded with QUALITY. Also I'm a bit of a completionist.<br><br>To each their own I suppose, her arc isn't a DRASTIC decrease in enjoyment for me.<br><br>I have a depressing lack of Dorodoron in my folder.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To me, SS was a bit too predictable (exactly 7 episodes per general) in structure, and from what I heard here I was expecting a lot more from a certain two characters than what was actually delivered. Most of the action felt really floaty, even though I loved the idea of using spirit power to fly and make shields and other cool stuff. I disagree about Saki and Mai though, they become their own unique characters within the first 10 episodes.</br>  <br>? But most series have a lot of positive energy from all the girls. What makes the Splash Star group so different?<br><br><br>Is Max Heart really that bad? I hear it's even more of the Nagisa show than Futari Wa was and I'm not too big on Nagisa.<br><br><br>Yeah Splash Star is pretty predictable but so are a lot of the other seasons. I can see why you'd be disappointed in the twins though if they aren't the kind of characters you find appealing. I suffered the same disappointment in regards to Setsuna.<br><br>Speaking of which I still need to finish Fresh since I stopped after Northa's debut episode. Does CureCom have any batches for the later episodes yet?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Max Heart really that bad? I hear it's even more of the Nagisa show than Futari Wa was and I'm not too big on Nagisa. <br>It's basically the first season but with a third girl but still the same ratio of Nagisa to Honoka as before.</br></br>  <br> It's basically the first season but with a third girl but still the same ratio of Nagisa to Honoka as before. <br>I'm watching Max Heart right now and Honoka's role is reduced a lot.<br>I still haven't seen any Honoka centric episode, but I can't even count the episodes focused on Nagisa.<br>Even Hikari feels a secondary character compared with Nagisa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to badmouth MH too much, because it certainly has it's moments, but fuck it:<br>the fights were less fun, often drawn poorly in comparison<br>Shiny Luminous feels like an excuse to add more stock footage<br>repeat episodes from last season<br>nagisa forgets shit she learned last season<br>plots of epsiodes staggeringly more boring than last season<br>Less super-heroics, due to everyone being put to sleep/heroines are warped to different dimension during fights (a malady that plagues SS, Y5, and other later seasons)<br>A significant amount of time pretending to focus on a plot that doesn't go anywhere until the last 5 episodes.<br><br>Nagisa taking up too much time doesn't even remotely bother me. I have watched far too much Dragonball to be bothered by that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Max Heart really that bad? <br>No. I liked it better than FW. Hikari added something to the group dynamic that I didn't realize was missing before, but was very obvious when going back to FW.</br></br>    <br>One part I found funny but also thoughtful was that there was one fight in particular where Hikari is running around in a forest while Black and White are fighting, and then they defeat the enemy on their own without her help at all. She realizes that she's actually not that needed to fight, and thought I don't remember what came of it, that there was attention drawn to the fact was nice.</br>  <br>i don't remember that at all, I would really like to see that one again if it exists</br>  <br>I'm not sure if that's good or bad but the way people talk makes it sound bad.<br><br><br>That makes me want to watch the first two seasons even less. And since those are the only ones I haven't finished other than Fresh that's not exactly a good thing.<br><br><br>What exactly did she add to the dynamic?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'll now proceed to pleasure myself with this racket. </br>  <br>i really like the first season, and at least don't regret watching the second, it is not without merit. I didn't intend to push you off of it.<br><br>nigga she gettin high</br></br></br>  <br>The first season is good, a bit outdated, but that's all.<br>It has a lot of nice details, White and Black are the most badass cures when it came to fighting and has one of the more believable friendship of all Precure.<br>I wouldn't recommend Max Heart to anyone though.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't find it, but it definitely happened. In rewatching some episodes though, I remembered just how awesome FW and MH were. The transformations and attacks felt so powerful and real, especially Yukana's amazing performance as Honoka.</br>  I am gundam  <br>I want to molest this Hibiki.</br>  Oh this poor lovely cat.

I would just take her transforming device and throw it in the river. <br>Apparently you are an idiot.<br><br>The villains tried to target their transformation devices, and you apparently don't remember how that worked out for them.

They didn't seem very close.<br>Also the fact that Yuri never mentions her mother when she talks about what is important for her.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should watch Naiso. Not that he turns into a saint or anything, but some progress.</br>    <br> progress after 200+ episodes and only in an OVA series made after <br>That's not development at all. I keep telling myself that he's just a kid, but everybody else is relatively well adjusted and kind and when they are cruel to someone because they don't know any better they go and fix what they did. Kotake has talked shit the entire series after someone else starts ripping on someone without ever going out of his way to say sorry. Furthermore, there would not be this issue if he wasn't a little shit in the first place</br></br>    <br>Tomboys have the most charming charmpits.</br>  <br>Because Michiru and Kaoru actually became Cures.</br>  who curvycure here    Anyone got the link to Scarlet's first fight?

It's good to be cute, too.</br>      I hope next year's precure is themed on fighting crime.<br>The cures could have police and detective themed costumes and the villains would do petty crimes with their MOTW and always trying to pull a score.<br><br>World threatening villains are so blazé now.</br></br></br>    <br>No, we should have  idol Precures. </br>  How do you think they're going to kill Shut off? It's gotta be nearing that point, Dyspear doesn't even seem to care about him enough to throw him into a death match like she did Close. Unless he switches sides for his waifu   <br> World threatening villains are so blazé now. <br>Precure is also for little girls who are not yet jaded about such things.<br><br>That said, I think crime-fighting might be cool.<br><br><br>I think Lock will kill off Shut.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   Unless he switches sides for his waifu <br>This is what I want to see.<br>It would be great if when he switch sides, he changed the outfit and is shown as beautiful bishounen.<br> I also want Towa to fall in love with him. </br></br></br></br>   Shut switches side for his waifu after Towa purify him <br> Lock promptly kills him </br>  <br>I kind of like Shut now similar how I warmed up to Close before they got rid of him.

And the spoiler too. </br></br></br>  <br> purify <br>I don't know if "BAAARNINGU" counts as purification.<br><br>And secondly, Shut's ass belongs to Mermaid</br></br></br></br>  <br> And secondly, Shut's ass belongs to Mermaid <br>Of course. Her maids do everything for her.</br></br>  <br>Is he even going to die any soon? Right now Lock is on the horse. However if it should be him, then I guess he will somehow try to save Twilight from being Towa, so he will either steal that fancy lock or he will get buff from Lock.</br>  <br>One of things that I will never forgive Toei is putting Twilight's dark maids offscreen</br>  <br> putting Twilight's dark maids offscreen <br>Damn I just realized this, now I'm mad too.</br></br>  Perky peachy Muse butt  <br> implying moero moero gandam is not the purest purification </br>  <br>Lock seems more like this season's Bel to me, with some sort of ulterior motive to the boss. He's just been dicking about up until this point, after all. And h was stated to be the strongest of the three generals back at the begining too, so it'd be weird for him to go next.<br><br>But it would be pretty funny if they actually DO kill him off first and it just leaves Shut as some sort of left over non-entity that everyone neglects and forgets about.</br></br></br>     no retirement match <br>literally a shit tier anime megumi kudo</br>  <br><br>What if they are Precure but don't have any powers, and they're just chuuni as fuck.

"Curiosity" may not be the best translation for 気になる. We are trapped between two languages which use different ways to express something.<br>- The sound effect is Mu Mu Mu, but at first it doesn't make sense that Haruka try to calm them by saying Mu Mu Mu.

I felt like there were a million children's puns going right over my head while watching this, so after a while I just said "fuck it" and trusted most of the original translations.

Kotake x Doremi is the obvious good ship they've been pushing from day one with his cute nickname for her. They're kids, rememeber. He very obviously likes her, but either fails at expressing it or Dojimi is too dense to notice things at times that he does. And she very obviously likes him too.

It's kinda mean and will turn off many people from art.<br>The books are mostly worthless and full of really terrible advice, other than the PEOPLE ARE 8 HEADS TALL and written in a needlessly complicated bloaty style that will confuse most readers and beginners.<br><br>The best thing to recommend to total beginners is preston blair books.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At this point I can never tell if something is legitimate trickery or just people trivializing something they don't like by calling it a meme. Same with SS</br>  <br>They call that a chin?</br>  <br>Recommending loomis started as a meme on the conceptart.org forums to troll newbies.<br>Those forums were super elitist and full of people trying to sabotage the other members with wrong advice.<br>Then people who lurked started reading the troll advice as legit recommendations and the whole thing became selfsustaining.<br>Recommending loomis was always bullshit.<br>There's some correct things in those books but there's far better books for beginners that wont needlessly confuse them and fill their heads with endlessly complicated methods for things that are supposed to be way easier if you learn the proper methods.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that small ass <br> ideal <br><br>Top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br> shoulders wider than hips <br>disgusting</br></br>  <br>Don't listen to this retard there's nothing wrong with Loomis, his books aren't my favorite but they aren't bad.<br><br>It's a meme but it's not a trick.

Don't pull shit outta your ass.</br></br></br>  <br><br> they fell for the loomis meme <br>So how much progress have you art skills made? <br>Loomis is a great way to ruin your foundations and having to relearn everything once you get serious.</br></br></br></br>  <br> loomis teaches construction <br> a great way to ruin your foundations <br><br>LMAO keep parroting what wannabe artists say.

It's like giving a kid legos. You have to learn about shapes, perspective, volumes and proportions before you start constructing.<br>Blair is not about learning a "style" it's foundations training for absolute beginners.<br><br>But I already see you are struggling with your remorse for having slavishly tried to ape loomis for years and still being shit because you tried to learn a "style" instead of tools.</br></br></br></br>   tfw actually work in the industry as a freelance artist <br><br>Listening to non-artists argue over how to learn art gives me the same feeling as dragging my teeth across a chalkboard.</br></br>  <br>If you think loomis is anything other than stylized you are a huge fucking retard.<br>Loomis is the worst kind of stylized and it is even mirrored in his wrong explanations of perspective and anatomy.<br>He's wrong on most things he tries to explain.</br></br></br>  <br> Style <br> Loomis <br><br> implying I don't learn from multiple source <br><br>It's okay anon. You can drop your pretentious act. I know you've avoided Loomis for years so you can do your stylized shit. Time to wake up and get some real education.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know what you mean.<br>I study fine arts in florence and if you started bringing up loomis people would fucking laugh you out of the university.<br>Those books are basically snake oil.</br></br></br>  <br> let's pretend I'm actually an artist </br>     mfw filthy pig disgusting gaijins argue over disgusting gaijin shit <br>Nakamura or bust.</br>  <br> making up stories <br><br>LMAO you're a shit artist if you don't know how to extract knowledge from a book.

Gonna take up your rec. Loomis isn't bad btw but perhaps just not as good as later material.</br>  <br>Dems some hips</br>  <br> I'm terribly sorry you actually learned something from a book so I'm gonna recommend you a book that you can't read </br>  <br>Yeah, but what can i do? been in the trenches for 5 years already.<br>Besides, my town isn't THAT bad.</br></br>  So, ignoring all the shitposting. What the fuck does one actually start with?  <br>There you go.<br>http://www.amazon.com/Struttura-Man<wbr>uale-Anatomia-Artistica-Volume/dp/8<wbr>873056113<br><br>I guess if you are semi-advanced already you might even syphon out some knowledge without speaking italian.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Certainly not from an advice from 4chan poster.</br>  <br>Practice.</br>  <br>imageboards can be a golden mine son.</br>  <br>Well my initial point was that at my university the loomis books would be laughed at because they are really poor in quality and then even make some terrible mistakes into habits.<br><br>I'm sure there's an american equivalent to the pozzi books too.<br><br>I'm convinced that loomis started as a meme of people giving bad advice on purpose to keep their competition in the dark about real anatomical construction.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This Italianfag seems to know something about this and he's on /a/ so I don't see your point.<br><br><br>I meant basics.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really need to learn this if I want to be a good artist?<br><br>Just curious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think a decent approach is to redraw from artists whom you enjoy</br>  <br> I really need to learn this if I want to be a good artist? <br>I'd recommend it. If you are a absolute newcommer I'd also advice you to start with preston blair. His books are made for children and they are great at teaching the absolute basics of construction figures out of simple shapes.<br>I got a blair book when I was a kid because I wanted to draw mickey mouse (or to be more on point Paperinik, because he was cool as shit).<br>If your brain is able to understand thinking in volumetric shapes learning anatomy properly will come as a natural urge.<br><br>The advice I give all newcommers is that THINKING in 3D shapes is the most important part. You have to be able to visualize what you want to draw as volumes before you draw it. Understanding Depth and Space are the most important aspects of learning to draw.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Loomis is shit <br> Loomis is actually a good book about construction <br><br>What? Stand your ground you retarded ass faggot. One person makes sense, and you do a fucking 180. Is that what they teach in your university?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also have a thing for glasses<br><br><br>http://www.ctrlpaint.com/library/ - Watch the videos in order from chapters 2-7, then 18 and 19 for extra credit. It will give you enough of a cursory education to figure out what it is you want to pursue. <br><br>Right now you literally don't know what you don't know, so you can't ask the right questions or search for the right learning material. No one can say what will work best for you, but you can decide for yourself after watching the videos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love Raita's prototypes  So to learn art you have to snake around the psychopaths throwing spears at you, trying to keep you out. You just have to look at existing art and make it up as you go? Makes sense  <br>Real life is also a good place to learn from.</br>  <br> real life  <br>Who needs it?</br></br>  <br>Where did you get that from my post? Loomis is a shit book about construction because it teaches wrong basics.<br>No anime reaction image will change that fact.<br><br>The images I'm posting are from struttura uomo by neri pozza.<br><br>Loomis is a trap for beginners because it teaches them wrong methods of constructing while being overly complicated at the same time.<br>Spend that brain matter on learning some proper methods instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128196670 <br>You keep saying Loomis is wrong but can you elaborate your statement further on why?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128196670 <br><br> wrong methods of constructing <br><br>Like what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Once you can draw "realistic" figures, you can stylize them more effectively.</br>  <br> The advice I give all newcommers is that THINKING in 3D shapes is the most important part. You have to be able to visualize what you want to draw as volumes before you draw it. Understanding Depth and Space are the most important aspects of learning to draw. <br><br>Which is basically Loomis. I'm convinced you didn't read Loomis and just jumped in the bandwagon saying its a meme. Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br><br>this. do not practice drawing "anime" style. teaches you a lot of bad habits.</br></br>  <br><br> You keep saying Loomis is wrong but can you elaborate your statement further on why? <br>Yes. Loomis basically teaches you cartoon anatomy parading around as realistic anatomy.<br>That's why I keep recommending preston blair over him.<br>Preston blair also teaches cartoon construction but with no pretenses about being "realistic".<br>Look up any anatomy chart by loomis like that flat assed "perfect woman" shape that is being posted here.<br>It's full of glarring anatomical flaws. If you recommend this shit to a beginner he will start adapting those flaws and need to spend years relearning proper anatomy instead.<br>Loomis is a trap to learn stiff, impractical anatomy while you harmlessly learn construction.<br><br>Construction is stacking shapes on top of each other and placing them in a three dimensional space.<br>You don't need to learn loomis flawed 50s comic book anatomy to do that.<br><br>Loomis is snake oil. It looks "legit" to amateurs and beginners, but it's just a step better than those learn to draw manga books.<br><br>His proportions are off, his anatomy is wrong and the books are full of text that tries to make it appear legit.<br><br>The only people who cling to loomis are people looking for shortcuts.<br>There are no shortcuts in art.<br>You learn construction, then you can at least construct mickey mouse and then you learn proper anatomy.<br>It's hard work and much practice and no snake oil books from the 50s are going to change that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Which is basically Loomis. <br>No, which is basically a foundation of learning to draw.<br>Loomis just took it and created all his impractical books full of flawed anatomy around it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because then you actually know what you're idealizing. You can find features that you yourself find attractive and make sure to retain them. It also makes you git gud rather than relying on simple tricks to make your drawings look okay like a hack. Akio Watanabe is a good example of an artist that stylizes heavily but obviously has a ton of real anatomical knowledge.</br>  <br> Akio Watanabe is a good example of an artist that stylizes heavily but obviously has a ton of real anatomical knowledge. <br>Most animators have tons of real anatomical knowledge.<br>That is a foundation of being able to draw something that is attractive in the first place.<br>You need to know proper anatomy to know what parts to simplify to create a desired result.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The only people who cling to loomis are people looking for shortcuts. <br><br>??? Speak for yourself faggot. Now I see why you don't like Loomis, you want a shortcut.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for saving me the time of writing that all out. I think another problem is in the fact that people think stylization is synonymous with cartoony art when even da Vinci and Michelangelo's art was considered romantically stylized. <br><br>Loomis's art is just stylized in his fucked up 50's era sense of beauty. You should see how he draws black people, /pol/ and tumblr would have a field day.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks good, I'll try it.</br>  <br> ??? Speak for yourself faggot. Now I see why you don't like Loomis, you want a shortcut. <br>Loomis literally teaches you that women's shoulders are broader than their hips.<br>All his books are spiked with flaws and traps like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. But Watanabe in particular is a good example of applying that knowledge to an anime style.</br>  <br> You should see how he draws black people, /pol/ and tumblr would have a field day. <br><br>He's just racist like a lot of people back then. Same thing happen when he draw a 'chinamen' too.</br></br></br>   not a Raita thread <br><br>What went wrong?</br></br>  <br> taking everything an art instruction book shows as gospel <br>If you actually drew you would realize how retarded you sound</br></br>  <br> ideal proportion - female </br>  <br>But you are the one who refuses to understand why recommending an instruction book full of blatant misinformation and flaws to beginners is a bad idea.</br>  <br>/ic/.</br>    <br>raita needs to draw a anatomy guide book.<br>I'd buy that</br></br>  <br>http://sotymr01.tumblr.com/<br><br>I'd argue just getting an actual animator's tumblr would be a much better way of showcasing the argument. Following them is the only reason I use tumblr.</br></br></br>  <br> blatant misinformation <br>You fucking nigger.<br><br>I swear to Allah, you fags are the fucking worst. The type that just recently began taking art seriously, read up a little bit and suddenly you think you fucking know everything there is to know on the subject. What he's teaching isn't the abso-fucking-lute way to do it, he's teaching you the concepts and showing you how he understood it at the time. You would fucking know this if you actually did more than thumb through the .pdf and actually read what he wrote on the matter as a whole.<br><br>Everything that you read in his books details literally every aspect you need to become familiar with in order to be a half decent artist. All this bulls hit you're spewing about snake oil is fucking retarded, regardless of what book you read or how you go about learning, the concepts and practices you learn are the exact same fucking thing regardless where you hear it from.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The point still stands there are better books, far better books.<br>So why recommend the flawed one instead of a good book? You make no sense and you sound like you are full of deep regret.</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck are the shoulders so wide and hips so slim? That's a fucking man.</br>  <br>beauty standars were different back then.</br>  <br>That's not a thing of beauty standards, it's blatantly wrong.<br>Women have wider hips than they have shoulders because of their biological anatomy.</br></br>  <br>Because the books are good and you sound like someone who spent all of two months on /ic/ and suddenly think you can teach despite not knowing what the hell you're even going on about</br>  <br> Women have wider hips than they have shoulders because of their biological anatomy. <br>Source? Even some medical textbook depicted some female figure having shoulder a bit wider than hip(not always).</br></br>  <br>Not all people are the same.

Anyone with semi-serviceable eyesight can tell Loomis is shit and that his heavy stylization to fit the 50's warped perception of beauty is extremely outdated nearly 70 years later.

There is literally zero incentive to continue being this wrong.<br><br><br>It's not always the case but they are generally pretty close, just google nude woman front view. You won't find an single example of a woman with hips as small as what Loomis draws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We are talking PERFECT idealized anatomy here, aren't we?<br>Even the ancient romans gave women wider hips than shoulders because that's what the majority of women tend to have.<br>Because wide hips are seen as feminine.<br>Giving a woman tiny hips and hulking shoulders is bullshit except for when it's a concious design choice to show her as manly.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm no artist, and I have no formal education in the ways of illustrating the human body, but my dick knows good art when I see it, and you can't argue with my dick.

I don't particularly think that makes him asexual rather than just unaware of these kinds of things.

How is anybody supposed to enjoy something this rushed? It completely takes away any chance at getting invested in the characters.</br>  <br>The fucking grinder, god that was horrible.

You'll see the same recurring characters every week, so those are the ones they want you to get invested in.</br>  <br>Which is all well and good, but you still have to properly tell the story of an episode. You can't just ignore it for the sake of the larger arc</br>  <br>Its a homage/anniversary thing for the author, the japanese probably already knew the story or at least will be interested to see how it went in the originals.</br>  <br>You got a chuckle out of me anon.</br>  nice girl  <br>I don't think it's that weird. It's normal for the introduction of a side character to be a single episode. This episode was the introduction of the paper bag guy.</br>  <br><br>Clearly the point of this episode was uniting the shotacon, trapfag, and lolicon communities against the true and most degenerate menace: daughteru fags</br></br>  me on the right  <br>im the bear</br>  So headache guy is a 2cool4school prodigy that gets 100 in all his test, a genius detective and also a martial artist that can kick around landwhales much larger than him (plus a kakkoii sugoi ikemen that makes kobayashi's boypussy go tanoshii and start lubricating itself). Anything else?<br><br>The police should just have him choke on pills, give him a gun and send him to solve every case, he'd probably do it for more pills. They can fire the siscon and the other one that looks like he's about to shit himself, it's not like they do anything at all.</br></br>  <br>me mixed with concrete down the hall</br>  <br>If the loli could see the aura of paperbag man before , how could she get tricked?</br>  <br>You shouldn't feel that threatened by him. He actually injured himself for being too skinny and fucked up his hips for doing a retarded spinning kick. <br><br>In an unrelated note, as a straight guy who isn't attracted to Kobayashi I am going a bit GAR for him</br></br></br>  Shadow Man is probably going to be back as an ally since he's on the spread. The semen demon in the corner is Black Lizard, she's a crime lord and Akechi's female archnemesis at least in the novels. The guy in the far back is the Fiend with Twenty Faces who is also Akechi's arch nemesis.  <br>Will japan ever get tired of superhuman teenage edgelord chuunibyou wish fulfillment characters?<br><br> They can fire the siscon and the other one that looks like he's about to shit himself, it's not like they do anything at all. <br>hey that's not true. They interfere with kobayashi doing their jobs for them. So at least that's something</br></br></br></br>  That's hardly a mystery at all. Where's the part that supposed to have watchers to think along with the detective?  <br> Superhuman <br> dislocates his hip with one kick </br></br>  <br> mystery <br>Its not.</br></br>  <br>I just want to see more of the coroner lady. She was cute.</br>  <br>what is it then</br>  <br>Maybe the aura she can see is the lolicon aura</br>  <br>It's not that kind of show<br><br>It was apparent from early in the first episode that this was going to lean more on strangeness than mystery solving<br><br>Go watch CSI or something</br></br></br></br></br>  see this what do  <br> YOU CANT USE THAT, IT REDUCES YOUR LIFESPAN BY X YEARS <br>if a weakness or injury is just mentioned but has no actual plot consequences, it's not a weakness at all.</br></br>  <br>Han-solo wasn't shredded.</br>  <br>oh shit you're right</br>  <br>We should also get the Fiend next episode since they showed this during the ending</br>  ;_;7  <br>It does have actual plot consequences.

Seems like a confusing translation  <br>The hero we need but don't deserve.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> Akechi's arch nemesis is Bayonetta </br>  <br> those hips <br>That's a female body if I ever saw one. You can fake breasts, be short and have feminine legs, but you can't reproduce the curve of a woman's shapely hips.  Shit trap. </br></br>    <br>Yea I got confused when he disguised himself as the mom and I remembered him saying that line.</br>  <br>Help him up and compliment his looks ofc</br>  <br>Shouldn't you be in Gakkou Gurashi?</br>  <br>Is the woman inspired on that one that Sherlock Holmes crushed on? Does Akechi give a fuck about her outside of the rival thing?</br>  <br>he specifically said the word for little girl, the translators were dumb.</br>  <br>But I have relatively womanly hips, it's just random chance</br>  <br>Do they usually watch the episode through before translating? I guess I can see how they could think girl is enough if they haven't seen where the plot is going, but after watching it there is zero reason not to add "young" there</br>  <br>Black Lizard is kind of like Batman and Cat Woman. Both rivals but they really want to fuck each other and they find excitement in outwitting or fighting the other.</br>  <br> man is a master thief and can disguise himself as nearly anything <br> practically dedicates his life to worship of little girls <br> but he'll never be able to be one <br>this is like /a/'s worst nightmare</br></br></br></br>  <br>but he could disguise himself as a little boy and have his very own mujaki no rakuen-esque adventure</br>  <br>Of course he can't. Can't change his height.</br>  <br>Shadow Man is the light side of /a/<br>Fatty is the dark side<br>it's like poetry</br></br></br>  <br>Then he's a lying little shit</br>  <br>can we have a middle ground?

The thing is, I don't really get what are they trying to do with him. He's a genius so he's the brain of the team, that's fine, but he's also the muscle? What's the point of having the police guys, if he can take down the criminals by himself then?<br><br>Plus the whole thing felt out of character. He's the calm and collected guy that thinks before doing anything, and that gives no fucks at all, and didn't care about this particular case either, but then he suddenly rushes to kick the fatass for no reason at all, and when there was no need to, and when the siscon told him to not do it. If he's so smart, how come he didn't saw himself getting hurt? He acts like everything is a pain in the ass so much, one would assume he would do anything to avoid getting hurt, and then goes and gets himself hurt.<br><br>If anything I think I feel threatened by this show writing. I probably should stop caring about the plot and just enjoy the boypussy. That's what everyone's been doing right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He knew Chair-sensei was lusting for his  wide, soft hips , and is shown to be quick on the uptake of people's feelings, so I'm of the suspicion that he knows exactly what he's doing, kissing his poor blueballed friend on the cheek, handing him his underwear in public and keeping the dress like he just wants to see how long it takes before the guy snaps and does something about all the cockteasing. That sounds about as tanoshii as anything else Kobayashi admittedly adores. There's no way that crazy little fuck doesn't have a huge list of dirty fetishes  and I want to know them all. </br>  <br>So did Kobayashi put on pantsu or did they just not wear underwear?</br>  <br>yes they're literally the same person. Although the Fiend from Daughter of Twenty Faces isn't like his novel version. The Fiend is supposed to be arrogant and kind of an asshole while they made him sort of a gentleman character in Daughter of the Twenty Faces. I think the Ranpo Kitan version should be more accurate.</br>  <br> kissing his poor blueballed friend on the cheek <br>I think that was a whisper, the angle made it looked like he was kissing him.</br></br>  <br>Kiss them<br>Or did you mean the underwear</br></br>  <br>I like gentlemen thieves but I'm looking forward to him still.</br>  <br>maybe he puts on an indifferent front but he actually does care about justice, so he wanted to hurt the guy? it's not really that hard anon</br>  <br>fap</br>  <br>Replace with frilly/lace panties.</br>  <br> he suddenly rushes to kick the fatass for no reason at all <br>he was protecting his fuccboi</br></br>  <br>I knew it was coming and I still lost it.</br>  <br>I would get it if the fuccboi was under his feet completely on his mercy, but he's in different room altogether.</br>  <br>I seriously don't get how you could lose a fight to a man that fat. Just dodge his slow ass hits and fuck him up while he's taking 3 years to recover.</br>  <br> What's the point of having the police guys, if he can take down the criminals by himself then? <br>I thought from the first episode that maybe they were those two incompetent guys in detective shows that serve as a foil and that inform of cases, like in Sherlock Holmes, but from those two chapters I'm not sure. Maybe they are going to have another role further in the season.<br> Plus the whole thing felt out of character. He's the calm and collected guy that thinks before doing anything, and that gives no fucks at all, and didn't care about this particular case either, but then he suddenly rushes to kick the fatass for no reason at all, and when there was no need to, and when the siscon told him to not do it. If he's so smart, how come he didn't saw himself getting hurt? He acts like everything is a pain in the ass so much, one would assume he would do anything to avoid getting hurt, and then goes and gets himself hurt. <br>I don't see him like that. The guy spends most of his time being a coach potato playing games that are stimulating or sleeping. He probably spends the rest of his time working or exercising a little. Keep in mind that he is drugged all the fucking day, so him working this way, as a low capacity rechargeable battery is pretty logical. That gives me the thought now that he is so dead most of the time that he doesn't have the time to clean, leading to the shoes autismo.<br> I probably should stop caring about the plot and just enjoy the boypussy. That's what everyone's been doing right? <br>Not me. I just genuinely enjoy the show. It baited me with some good plot points in the first episode for things getting serious at the end (especially with the friend of Akechi), and for now, while it is introducing the characters, it uses the contrast between their views to create a grotesquely funny and entertaining story due to their reactions to each murder. Kage Otoko going all poignant after what happened this episode was hilarious</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of his arch enemies went to him for help, and when he got there Shadow Man was a crying broken wreck. Shit got personal</br>  <br>He saw him handcuffed and was enraged by the possibility that someone other than him felt up kobayashi</br>  <br>Weight makes quite a difference, especially if he's a muscle fat construction worker</br>  <br>Muscle fat is different, he just look like he packs in the rest of the dead girls that couldn't fit on his wall.</br>  <br>I think maybe he caught on to the situation with Sherlock speed and had an actual sympathetic moment for Shadow Bro's suffering and had a berserk moment. Of course, it was also probably fueled a lot by his pain meds, which can make a person put a way worse toll on their body than they normally would if they weren't high at the time. Maybe we're about to see past his chuuni outer shell to an actual character with more depth than the pills let him show, or something.<br><br>But that's just my hunch. I'm here for the boypussy.</br></br></br>  <br>Shadow man was also skinny as hell and had terrible posture.

I can't fap after seeing Shadow Man's tears.  This episode was a fucking masterpiece of storytelling and y'all know it.  <br>Pretty obvious if you ask me</br>  <br>It's the saddest shit I've seen all year and it was barely even focused on. The only thing he loved was crushed in an instant and he couldn't even hurt the one responsible.<br><br>I'm going to get really drunk and cry for Shadow Man and his loli.</br></br></br>   anon says that he likes some traps and he's straight <br> lgbt defense force appears <br> b-but anon, you can't like traps and be straight at the same time.

All the other characters seem far much more interesting then him design wise.  if Shadow Man had more power, he could have protected his loli<br><br>He needed more power</br></br>  <br>Kobayashi being insane and showing empathy and compassion while straight out condemning and foiling the culprit is the best.<br><br>You're just insecure about your sexuality.</br></br></br>  Gay.   heal a loli <br> brutally kill her later <br>No, I won't deal with it.</br></br>  <br>if only there was right to bear something that would allow weak people to defend themselves</br>  Fat pedos = bad people<br>Skeleton pedos = good people<br><br>Learn the difference, it could save your lolis</br></br></br>  <br>Admittedly, it is a bad trap.</br>  <br>Keep in mind that skeletons are weak and can't harm anyone.

According to the guy who made FLCL people in Japan watch it as this weird thing because most of the references are lost on them, so they see it as an Americanized version of "Weird Japanese Thing"</br></br>  <br>No I remember them showing his Dick</br>  <br> To be a man you must have Honour, Honour and a peeeenis. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=f31<wbr>1XTtqPgc</wbr>  [ ]<br>Real nice kids show.

Also South Park is funnier</br>  I wish someone would sub newer episodes.  <br><br><br><br><br>Well, It looks like 2005 Shin-chan to me according to this</br></br></br></br></br>  Are you excited for the live action Attack on Titan movie /a/?  <br>yeah sure</br>  <br>Can't be worst than .</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>I know hollywood does it too, but I can't stand everyone being cast by japanese actors when they are canon white. That fucking armin goddamn.</br>  <br>No. Why are they wasting money on a shitty live action version when they haven't even made a second season? <br>Is there not enough of the manga for a second season yet?</br></br>  <br>There's plenty. They could probably make 3 seasons by now.</br>  no, everyone will be 3dpd  <br>Kinda of</br>  <br>Right, then there is no excuse for live action version of it. Do the manga. Then do the show. Then give us a live action version no wonder nothing ever pans out well in the industry they are so fucking spastic.</br>  <br>Oh sure, let's just ship over a dozen German actors who speak fluent Japanese!</br>  <br>They made the movie because they know people will pay for it. It'll make money for the studio, and that's what they want.</br>  <br>No, the green screen scenes stand out to much and break any immersion I might be able to get.</br>  <br>no, live action movies are shit but especially this since its fanfic tier garbage.</br>  <br>More like Shipping Faggotry the movie.</br>  <br>No.<br><br>It'll take everything shit about the anime, and then layer 3DPD and filters over it. The only benefit being the fact there won't be any shitty still/recycled frames .</br></br></br>  <br>No I don't want to see Gook on Titan.</br>  <br>No. LA is rarely ever good, regardless of franchise.</br>  How much of a budget does this have? Because I'd imagine the titans and 3DMG will cost a ton to CG in or else it will look terrible.   Marvel studios will buy the rights and it will help usher in a new age of live action Anime and Manga     We're all going to watch this because live-action titans are fucking nightmare fuel   This board needs more Lina.  <br> series ends with the slayers party fucking off and not bothering going after the rest of Ruby's fragments <br> literally has access to the most powerful spell in existence <br> was assisted by that wind dragon in aqualord  <br> sister is top tier yet doesn't even get a cameo <br> we never get to know why Xellos and his boss allows Lina to live and do all that shit instead of just astral gibbing them in their sleep nor their future plans <br><br>It was a fun ride, but god damn did it end on a shitty note.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The day you see Lina's sister make a full appearance is the day the writer has run out of ideas.</br>  <br> tfw faithful to LNs reboot never <br><br>It's the single thing in anime I want the most.</br></br></br>  <br>The writer already gave up on the series and went full non-canon with Pokota, so I don't see why he can't bring her out just to milk some cash. No one wanted that little toy fuck. <br><br>To begin with, Slayer's humor is dated, and isn't something that ages well as you grow older or get more jaded with anime. It's still great mind you, but if a newfag has already watched tons of comedy series he's not going to go wow over Slayers like so many people did back in the day, just like how everyone bought into Big 3 and the like in 2005. <br><br>But honestly, just the fact that the LN won't ever continue is sad enough. It's no different than ZnT as it is right now.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw no lina inverse hero   <br> tfw shitty flying fire lady instead of Lina </br>  <br><br><br>Why do you guys care about Lina's sister?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I can never see the appeal of Dota 2. Dota 1 had the charm of WC3's silly cartoon art, and everything looking so goofy made parody characters fun.<br><br>Dota 2 on the other hand made everyone look real try hard and kewl. It's ironic that though League is so shit and casual, it actually carries the spirit of the art direction of WC3 and thereby in extension, Dota 1, so despite being the oldest and having the most garbage customization it still holds an edge since the art is 'comfy' so to speak and has a range. <br><br>Srs Bizness art direction should be reserved for when you go balls out in immersion, not when you base a game on 3 lanes and retarded npcs charging at every interval. Even Dynasty Warriors understands this, or why else would they have guys using a fucking canoe as a weapon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For me, it's because she represents an untapped potential ally in the fight against Ruby fragments and whatever evil is out to doom the world. Mazoku are by nature beings that want to return everything to nothing, so regardless if Lina was a selfish bitch or not she should still be going on her knees and making up with her sister, because if she already feels she doesn't have what it takes to get rid of the rest of the ruby fragments then she should at least recognize she might be used again like with Hellmaster.
