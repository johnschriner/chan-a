Seriously, they look like the perfect gateway to corrupting young children to our cause.</br>  <br>Why does anime Papi have the best faces?</br>  <br> Shes like 32 bro <br>I have never felt this kind of anger before.</br></br>  <br>That face just makes her look extra retarded, for some reason.</br>  I always thought Rickert was a girl.  <br>nice reading comprehension</br>  <br> I always thought Rickert was a girl. <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>in the early chapters he looked pretty girlish m8</br>  <br>Isn't berserk a harem now?</br>  Wow, it's finally out<br>Colour me amazed<br><br> I wish Rickert had told people the truth about Griffith, but I understand why he didn't. Nearly everyone is a blind Griffith worshipper now, so it would just be taken as false propaganda. <br>Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that.</br></br></br></br>    What if Guts dies &amp; Little Witch takes over?    <br>Shierke magical girl spinoff when?</br>  <br> magical girls <br> in my fate vs man manga </br></br>  <br>When  they get off the boat </br>  <br> in <br>That's not what a spinoff is.</br></br>  <br>He will be soon enough.</br>  <br>The only spinoff Berserk should have is a prequel about SK.</br>  <br> mahou shoujo witch piloting a corpse mecha </br>  <br>Are supporters supposed to tease you with their lewd soles like that ? Bitch.</br>  <br>I don't know, but bare soles are highly arousing.</br>  So yeah, we monthly now<br> but for how long? </br>  <br>Until idolmaster 4 and dark souls 3</br>  Is Guts a good person?  <br> Was a mercenary (out of need, not love of fighting) <br> fought to save his home country in the '100 years war' <br> left the band so the leader would recognize him as his friend <br> saves leader later because he likes him <br> is standoffish so people won't want to hang around him because of his curse <br> all he wants to do is save his gf <br>Yeah, Guts is a good person</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Was it Void who was reincarnated before Griffith? He is the oldest member so it would make sense.  <br>But he almost let vengeance consume him, to the point he was willing to let innocents die or even kill innocents.</br>  Why cant miura release at least 50 pages per chapter? Hes doing things monthly and he has the story planned out right? 20 pages is too short.  <br><br>Does it really matters, man, like whatever</br></br>  Silat Hype.<br>The true hero comes to save the boy..!</br>  <br>Silat a bro</br>  <br>Until the end!</br>  <br>We don't know</br>  <br>Sorry to ask, but what is this from?</br>  Can someone explain to me how Ganishka is kill?<br><br>I read it twice and the manga doesn't really explain it at all. Griffith flew into the trees, and then suddenly Ganishka flaskback, then Skull Knight arrived, trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? then suddenly Vatican sprout out of the trees, fairlytale creatures came out and Griffith became the 2nd coming of Jesus?</br></br>  <br> trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? <br><br>Neither.</br></br></br>  <br>Then what the fuck is he doing? I thought he's against the Godhand, why is he sprouting Vatican out of Ganishka?</br>  Is noname a virgin?  <br><br>Twice reborn and then cut with a sword that reaches deeper still, anon.<br><br>Skull Knight is bringing the God Hand closer to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does "twice reborn" means?</br>  <br><br>You have been reading Berserk right?</br></br>  <br>It means he was reborn once as an apostle and again as Shiva.</br>  <br><br>Ok I get that Skullknight tried to strike Griffith with his Behelit sword, but Griffith went Aizen and "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka.<br><br>But then where did the Vatican city come from? What is the extent of Skullknight's Behelit sword power? Would Vatican city sprout up if Griffith just killed Ganishka straight up without Skullknight's Behelit sword strike? What happened to Skullknight afterward? Did he just "well I dun goofed" and leave? <br><br>I'm glad that it finally ended the worst, drawn out arc in Berserk, but there are several things that doesn't make sense</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka. <br><br>No, Griffith is still dancing to Skullies tune here.</br></br></br>  Wait I don't understand. He got sad because Theresia hated him or because he fucked up her life? Between the weird character development of Gutts and the 0/10 literally worst translation i have ever read in my entire life it's getting kinda difficul to understand his character  <br>Falconia was the former capital of Midland that was buried beneath the earth which Griffith raised up using his god powers. <br>No idea.<br>Probably.<br>He fucked off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Skullomania's end game? What is his tune?<br><br>He can warp space and teleport anywhere he want, why can't he just murder all apostles in their sleep? Maybe not Griffith per say, because it has been shown that Griffith is omnipotent but Zodd, the Hunter, Lancer, Crystal Dragons etc stood no chance against Skull'O. <br><br>Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand, then I can't see any way Miura can come up with an acceptable way of Guts beating Griffith. Guts need to at least get Ascension and become Godhand himself, because no amount of Berserker armor power ups would help him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand <br><br>It's not only Griffith, all the other God Hand can do the same kind of thing. Void does it during the Eclipse when Skully breaks in.<br><br>Skull Knight outright states that he's planning on creating a portal to the "vortex" and trap the God Hand there. Right now I think he might be waiting on Elf Island for Guts to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no reason why the dragonslayer wouldn't hurt the godhand if it hit them<br><br>Hitting them is the hard part, though</br></br></br>  PLEASE I NEED HELP WHERE THE FUCK CAN I GET THE DARKHORSE SCANS THIS SHIT IS KILLING ME  I don't understand how he managed to survive the heartbeats from the sea god <br>I really thought he at least would go blind after that</br>  Who or what is he?  <br>casca's son?</br>  <br><br>Wise magical negros apostle form</br></br>  <br>he's their son that griffith stole when he raped casca</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  can someone tell me why did he raped casca? <br>was it really just him being butthurt that she loved guts and not him?</br>  <br>Femto is devoid of humanity and compassion as is typical of all apostles.<br><br>All what's left in him was his bitterness and hurt over what Guts did to him. So he decided to punish Guts in the cruelest ways imaginable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The reincarnated Soul of their son. It and Griffith (Femto) are connected. As long as one lives the other cannot die. To kill Griffith Guts will have to murder his only child.<br><br>The fetus demon thing that Casca gave birth to was used as the vessel to bring Femto into the physical world. However when Femto manifested and took control of the body he forced the thing's soul out. This is it's new form.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A qt</br></br>  <br>Narrative. <br>But yeah, I think he was being possessive in order to destroy Guts. Something that not much people seem to notice about the rape is how "caring" Femto was. He kissed, licked and stimulated the way you'd do someone you want to give pleasure as well.<br>And to have the girl you love enjoying herself in an despicable act despite being so fucked up was enough not only to break Guts, but to break Casca as well.<br>Femto just killed two birds with one stone</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was one of the nicest moments in the manga so far.</br>  <br>You sure about that big boy?</br>  <br>What are you implying?</br>  <br> farnese <br>I really hope she gets hatefucked by a hundred apostles when guts has to choose if he wants to become a god hand</br></br>  <br>Almost and did are different things, Anon-kun.</br>  <br> Guts will never be your dad </br>  <br>You can use google, you know?<br> Witch Hunter </br></br>  <br>LOL Casca had the brand of sacrifice so i'm pretty sure she was suffering a lot</br>  <br>The brand wasn't bleeding and her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels.</br>  <br> Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that. <br>I always thought she was a smartass.</br></br>  <br> her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels. <br><br>You've been reading too much hentai anon. Arousal during rape is normal physical response. Doesn't mean she enjoyed it at all</br></br></br>  <br>she hasn't acted like she actually hates guts in like a hundred chapters, she just does retard comic relief stuff.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, probably silat and his outcast cloned friends are the only one who understand what griffith is.</br></br>  will rickert ever go through puberty?<br><br>where does he get his HRT prescription from?</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>A bit of both, actually</br>  <br> her body <br>You're not reading enough</br></br>  So I'm re-reading after stopping when they initially got on the boat. I currently just finished the volume where Griffith is reborn. <br><br>This time however, I read the excluded chapter 83. <br><br>Is there any good, well thought out speculation on what "Fear God(ch.83)" wants with humanity? Griffith just asked for wings. I want some exposition. If it's a reflection of humanity, then what the is it doing projecting more fear on humanity. It leads me to think Guts is either a character that's being guided by some opposing force.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*shit I'm pretty drunk<br><br>disregard that "either"</br></br></br>  <br> that awful quality </br>  <br>Schierke wants the dick so hard is unreal. I wish Guts would pound that loli ass already.</br>   a retarded homosexual actually thought that Rickert was a girl and he probably thought that Griffith was a girl too   Best girl  <br>Ooohhh! Mr. Silatt and his Pillar Men has finally arrived. I wish they did this pose after saving the Femto Slapper.</br>  <br>Could Dio take any of those three on?</br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  <br>holy shit this <br> <br>it's blatant how bad the manga is now</br></br></br>  <br>I'd kill myself.</br>  <br>Silly anon, the boat ride never ends.</br>  who's Miura favorite idol and why?  <br>Even good people make mistakes, the fact we are saying "almost" and not "did" shows that he is strong enough to remember that he still has morals. If Guts was a mindless killer, like when he is in the Berserk armour, things would be very different.</br>  <br><br> mahou shoujo bersekah magica </br></br>  <br>For all we know they may still get hurt from being hit with weapons such as draonslayer. I mean why bother using that portal redirect thing or even fight back if they didn't have to worry. I think actually landing a blow is suppose to be the difficult part.</br>  <br>Chihaya, because "look at Casca".</br>  <br> I mean why bother using that portal redirect thing or even fight back if they didn't have to worry. I think actually landing a blow is suppose to be the difficult part. <br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong but they've only ever pulled that out for Skully.<br><br>Slan herself manifested in that troll den and took a dragonslayer through her troll-intestine torso, that might have just been a remote astral body thing similar to what the dread emps was pulling though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right the only time we have seen that is when Void and Femto redirected Skull Knights attack. <br>Yeah I'm not too sure how the whole ordeal with Slan worked out. I just want to see Guts kill a god hand and the others god hands reactions, shit would be cash.</br></br>  <br>i get the impression she literally has no soul</br>  <br> To kill Griffith Guts will have to murder his only child. <br>Oh, the suffering. This sounds like something Miura would do.</br></br>  So when guts got into the boat, miura told in an enterview that the stroy was about 60-65% complete.<br><br>how much has it advanced since then? 5%? 10%?</br></br>  <br>1%.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Shit this literally sounds 100% dead on</br>  <br><br>There's no real way to know who would win. DIO could probably avoid them indefinitely using The World, but there's nothing to guarantee that his Stand could actually hurt them in any meaningful capacity. <br><br>If both parties have to fight unaware of the others abilities, my money is on Pillar Men because DIO is arrogant as Hell and his underestimating of them would probably lead to his partial consumption into a panicked time stop only to find out he can't move away from them now that they've started to eat him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>God Hand = once every 216 years, besides there are already five of them (5 fingers in a hand...).<br><br>Not only that, but being a God Hand is not enough to kill one, Guts has to surpass them. <br>Guts will kill God himself, he will fucking trash him barehanded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is not a shonen, Guts will kill Griffith, if even that, and call it a millenium until Griffith is reborn to kill him for good.</br>  <br>How and why would Griffith come back to life ?</br>  <br>And why would Guts be still alive by then ?</br>  <br>It happened to Void. Because causality.</br>  <br>Can you remind me where it's explained ?</br>  <br>because Zodd is Gut's father</br>  <br>Yes he can stop time and The World is faster and stronger than any of them, they could absorb him but they would have to touch him to do that and they will never be able to.</br>  <br>In </br>  <br>His name is motherfacking Rickert m8</br>    <br>Wait, if Skull Knight killed Void how come he's still there ? <br>I'm missing something I think.</br></br>  I'm wondering why Guts goes so far for Casca.<br>If she was my girl, I would have left her already.</br>  <br>Because if she dies, Griffith becomes even more powerful.<br>At least that'd be my reasoning. Guts legitimately loves her, and also subconsciously keeps her as a wound Griffith inflicted.</br></br>  You guys excited for Third Aerial Girls Squadron this winter?<br><br>Studio: Musashino Animation <br>Director: Seiichii Kinoshita (Jiggly Jiggly Heaven and Exodus!)<br>Writer: Shimeji Maitake<br>Aria: Kyouko Suzuki<br>Catherine: Shuzuka Itou<br>Tatiana: Hiroko Tokiwa<br>Christine: Ayano Makise<br>Noa: Eri Asagami<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8X_<wbr>L0Ce2crM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will the OVA be decently animated?</br>   Sweden looks like she's ben designed by Mizuryu Kei. <br>Why am I not surprised ?<br><br>So they are releasing an OAV ?

Black is probably the chillest.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>  <br>Once again, FLAT is justice.</br>  <br><br> liking joke characters </br></br>  <br> loli <br>Anta full baka.</br></br>  <br>Please, she'd break you before can break her.</br>  <br> joke <br>Pink was no joke man, she was very cute and probably the second best girl for MC if it weren't for Masuzu.<br><br><br>Speak for yourself, I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Joke characters tend to be better than serious ones in shows like this.</br>  <br>Orange</br>  <br> liking retards </br>  <br>How does it feel knowing that Hollanda will never win a World Cup?</br>  <br>Best girl never wins.</br>  <br> neverlands <br> orangefag <br><br>How fitting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The proper term is comic relief character. Those types are usually fun and Pink being second best to Orange can be said to be a testament to that. Pink even supports Orange, so you which team is the team to side with.</br>  <br> Netherlands <br> best girl <br>Bullshit. They start off well and fall apart after a few screw ups, even degenerating into infighting. They're a good team no doubt but far from the true best,  Germany .</br></br></br>  <br> Enemy of my enemy is my friend. <br>But then again i don't like white either, fuck that bitch. I heard pink got better in last volume and try to find a way to stop MC's anti-love thing.</br></br>  <br> white </br>  <br><br>Oh fuck i mean silver.</br></br>  <br>you know*<br><br><br>More Silver than White.<br><br>Thing is though, Pink and Orange gets along well so they are not enemies.<br><br>Last volume that had spoilers I remember reading was volume 8. That was Pink's volume and in that was her first time being a serious heroine. She realized her position and in the end went to support Orange to be together with the MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If team Orange doesn't win, I'll riot.</br>  <br>Here, have a Molotov cocktail and some bike chains. It's going to be a harem end because Eita is JUST that chuuni. /a/ is going to shrug and say "it was always shit" but everyone will be smoldering inside.</br>  <br>Those with good taste.</br>  <br><br>Left, right is okay too though, I like silver hair.</br></br>  I want to cum all over Masuzu's delicious tummy.  <br>Was it ever satisfactorily explained in canon why she doesn't wear pantsu? It's been so long I forget.<br><br> inb4 she's a slut, whore, etc </br></br></br>  <br>She just likes FREEDOM.</br>  <br> going commando <br>I get it.</br></br>  <br><br>these<br><br>why is she so perfect</br></br></br></br>    <br>right</br>    Silver = Pink &gt; Black &gt; shit &gt; Orange  anyone who likes orange should be euthanized    <br>Orange is such a fucking shitty bitch. Worst girl.</br>  <br>This /a/non knows.</br>    That boy who has a crush on MC    Avoid the crazy.  <br>Always left.</br>    Silver is made for good hard breeding<br><br>Orange is too dainty, she'd BWEAK</br></br>  <br>Chiwa. She is one of the few childhood friends who deserves to win over the bitch heroine.</br>    <br> that fucking scene </br>  <br>I concur.</br>    <br><br>I hate to break it to you...but all dem bitches be krazy!</br></br>  <br> boy </br>      <br>Why the fuck can't we just have regular traps lusting for MC cock instead of reverse traps. Makes me sick.</br>    <br>Can you make a webm of this scene? </br>    <br>Left, because she's not a blackmailing cunt</br>  I like Silver and Orange individually. I wish only one existed and not the other. Orange deserves to have her wish fulfilled by being with her childhood love and watching Silver defrost is magical. <br><br>Fuck the author for making me choose one or the other.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't have that video in my com right now. Also it might take sometime to re-download so don't expect anything.</br></br>    <br>Ok.</br>  <br><br>Or...<br><br>Send me a download link (Preferably Mega , Mediafire) and I'll make whatever webm you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that's gay.</br>  <br>This is what I found<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!kgdw1B7B!vR0n-<wbr>oBBV-3Q4sZqs3VxtXDGtYlhxTblZsTB_DRy<wbr>acE</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Pink, please</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon. Will see what I can do.</br></br>  I'm still baffled as to how Silver can have fans.  <br>She bullies worst girl. That's enough reason to like her.</br>  Who /bestFriend/ here?<br>Nobody?<br>eh, it's not like I'm gay, but if dating pink would make my bro happy, I'd marry pink.</br></br>    <br>I think most of her "fans" like her unironically.</br>  <br><br><br>Alright, I'm not sure if you want the whole thing or not but here you go.</br></br></br>  <br>That's perfect. Cheers.</br>  I'd take silver and orange.<br>The other two can join in.<br>I guess I'll have them all.</br></br>  Here, have the fixed version  <br>This. I think many would agree except the filthy orangefags.</br>  <br>neither, as i am not a lolicon or a masochist</br>  <br>I would rather have Pink win than Shitwa.</br>  <br>Ai-chan kawaii!</br>  <br> ever picking retardation <br>Right until the end of times.</br></br>  <br>Osananajimifags have the smallest comfort zone.</br>  <br>fool you smash both</br>        the people who would pick left are the same people who would pick Eriri<br><br>prove me wrong</br></br>   picking left ever   <br>I bet you think Hinagiku is a joke character too.<br>Look at this guy. Look at him and laugh.</br></br>  <br>Jojo is garbage.</br>  <br><br>That's true. Both Eririfags and Orangefags are a minority.</br></br>  <br> Pretentious and cancerous Jojofag <br>The worst type. It's not enough she's a huge cunt on top of that.</br></br>      <br> Nyaruko </br>  Left is literally a kid, mentally and physically  <br>PINK<br>I<br>N<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is why NTR exists </br>  <br>I haven't seen this show. I don't even know what show it is.<br><br>Right is the CLEARLY superior choice.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the connection other than that they have twintails. Both are best girls anyways.</br>  <br> both are childhood friends <br> both are losers <br> both are worst girl </br></br></br>  <br>Left. If I had a childhood friend like Orange growing up, things would be a lot different around here.</br>  <br> Liking a cockblocker bitch <br>How can orangefags like her?</br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> Both are bitches </br></br>  <br>What a fucking bitch</br>  Pink. The Aunt's game literally proves she has 100% compatibility with the MC.  <br>Cockblocker tier:<br><br>1) Silver<br>2) Pink<br>3) Orange<br>4) Black</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> losers <br> He doesn't know that Orange is more likely to win than Silver <br>Animefag pls. Nice shit taste by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe.</br>  <br><br>Cool lie.</br></br>  <br>Nice delusion</br>  <br>F unny, that is one of my thoughts exactly when I wonder why Silverfags exists. Getting in Orange's way when she wasn't interested in the MC and was only using him for selfish reasons via blackmail. Silver is seriously 3DPD. At least with Orange she is mostly a kid mentally. Silver has ill-will and is vindictive when she abuses, schemes, and bullish.</br>  <br><br><br> Cockblocker tier: <br> 1) Silver <br>Even if it's a lie, she is supposed to be MC's girlfriend <br><br> He doesn't know that Orange is more likely to win than Silver <br>[citation needed]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show was a waste of a good OP  <br><br>Such a cute little butt.<br><br>Too bad that ram it too hard and she will be paralyzed from waist down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So? It's a fake relationship and she wasn't interested in the MC then. If she wasn't such a sadistic bitch, she should had told Orange that it was a fake relationship in the first place. But no, she enjoyed messing with Orange despite the fact she can tell that Orange likes the MC.</br>  <br>The strong always wins</br>  <br>Nice excuse that has nothing to do with the point at hand.</br>  <br>Your point? She has the right to stop the horny childhood friend who tries to seduce her boyfriend everytime because to the eyes of an outsider, they are going out.<br><br>However, orange has no right to stop the MC from flirting with anybody else and by doing so, she is just showing how hipocrite is she</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Ranka lost to Sheryl.</br>  <br> Orange is more likely to win than Silver </br>  <br>Why do you blame Silver?<br>It's MC's fault the he didn't tell the Orange his relationship was fake</br></br>  <br>Anyone playing the waiting game has no excuse.</br>  <br>They both occupy a distant third position in popularity lagging far behind the gold and silver medals.</br>  <br> Your point? <br> It's a fake relationship and she wasn't interested in the MC then. If she wasn't such a sadistic bitch, she should had told Orange that it was a fake relationship in the first place. <br>It's right there, you god damn retard. Silver is most selfish, she enjoys having it her way and causing others to suffer. It it's not even about keeping up with the bullshit relationship, but she got a kick out of fucking with Orange. <br><br>If you are going to cite rights, then by all rights Orange has the most right to be jealous and try one-up the other girls for knowing the MC the longest and for having better reasons to feel the way she feels than anyone else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ISSE NO~</br>  <br> she got a kick out of fucking with Orange <br>To be fair Orange made it REALLY easy for her. She's so gullible in the earliest episodes that it's painful to watch. You'd think she would realize that Silver is playing with her and tell her to fuck off, but no.</br></br>  <br>GAARISHU LAVA</br>  <br>Are you new to harem? Girls have their own rules and shit amongst themselves. Silver is a girl and she knows about Orange's feelings. So she is the one who purposely cockblock that hardest and most maliciously so. MC is your usual dense harem MC. He's not in the right to not tell, but the (poor) excuse for him exists in that he was getting blackmailed and stuck to go along with it for now.<br><br><br>Well, she is an innocent and naive girl. That's part of her character. But she grows a bit more later and starts to become highly competitive to the point she can have some weight in her banters against Silver.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SJW strike again </br>  <br> But she grows a bit more later  <br>And that's all thanks to Silver, if it wasn't for her Orange would continue to be dumb and naive kid</br></br>  <br> taking haremshit seriously in the first place <br>Your sanity isn't coming back anytime soon.</br></br>  <br> an innocent and naive girl <br>There's being naive, and then there's "dumb enough to think swinging a guitar around while screeching like an ape is the first step towards becoming a proper lady". It was like a crueler Kill Me Baby, but I wasn't laughing.</br></br>  <br>This might be bullshit, but I'll believe it. I won't riot when Orange wins.</br>  <br> It was like a crueler Kill Me Baby <br>Why is Yasuna so based while Orange is so shit?</br></br>  <br> If you are going to cite rights, then by all rights Orange has the most right to be jealous and try one-up the other girls for knowing the MC the longest and for having better reasons to feel the way she feels than anyone else. <br><br> I'm his osananajimi, so you need to ask for my permission if you want to date him <br><br>No wonder there are people who like orange, they are mentally challenged like her</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange <br> winning <br>Just like people believing Eriri can win.</br></br></br>  <br>No relationship squabbles in KMB.</br>  <br>Hint : anyone using the word "deserve" should be completely ignored</br>  <br>Both</br>  <br> but the (poor) excuse for him exists in that he was getting blackmailed and stuck to go along with it for now <br>Silver doesn't monitor him 24/7, he could have just told Orange it's a fake relationship so she wouldn't feel depressed about it<br>There's no excuse</br></br></br>  <br> Implying I would know what the fuck that is <br><br><br>If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. She'll mature as she grow older, it's only natural. The one thing Silver did was made Orange developed into an astringent character, that's all.<br><br><br>You realize her being a baka coincides with her innocent and naive, right? She's like Aika from Shomin Sample, but a less of a baka. <br><br><br> Straw man <br> Implying it is about permission <br>You sound mentally challenged when you can't understand rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. <br>And why's that?</br></br>  <br>MC's future is driven and motivated for Orange's sake. Per LN writing, you know how that will go.</br>  <br> You sound mentally challenged when you can't understand rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts. <br><br>Are you really an orangefag? Because she's the one not respecting those "rules" you just said by trying to fuck someone who has a girlfriend (and she didn't know the girlfriend is fake)<br><br>Also<br> gets called mentally challenged <br> NO, YOU  <br><br>Refrain from accessing this board if you are underaged</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts <br>You ever hear the phrase, "All's fair in love and war?" There are no rules in love. MC even tries to go for harem end, which if anything is disrespectful toward everyone.</br></br>  <br>Still haven't watched this because the color palette makes me nauseous.</br>  <br> If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. <br> Completely forgetting that she knew the MC for years and yet the MC became a beta faggot who didn't believe in love. <br><br>It's thanks to Silver that the MC started to change</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never seen so many white people in one place before.</br>  <br>If he let SIlver fuck around with Orange and didn't even tell her his relationship was fake, I don't think his future is that much driven and motivated for Orange's sake</br>  <br>He sees her like a little sister</br>   she's bitch because she's smarter and not naive <br>Orangefags logic</br>  he was gonna become a doctor and fix her frail vagina bones so she could marry a nice boy, while he himself becomes a misanthropic bastard like Dr. House  <br>It is though. He wants to become a doctor and stay by her side to treat her. <br><br><br>Shit happens in the future, dude. In the LN, she doesn't see her as a little sister anymore after Orange's advancements towards him. So, yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She made advancements because of sSilver. If it weren't for her, she would had mantained the status quo</br>  <br><br>Orange's faction in Japan have strong reasons behind their Orange end prediction. Unless the author does an asspul like Haganai's author, the ending should follow a general LN path so Orange end is most likely.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyone who has been following the story closely should be able to see it. Silver's arc isn't about needing the MC. Overcoming her family issues and deal with no-love will be the resolution for her character. By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Silver isn't a bitch because I like her <br>Silverfag in denial.</br></br>   Orangefags still post <br>EL OH EL</br>  <br>The one voiced by Yukari Tamura.</br>  <br> Any ending where my favourite girl doesn't win is an asspull </br>  <br> deal with no-love will be the resolution for her character <br> By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up <br>I didn't think it was possible to be this overoptimistic.</br></br></br>  <br> Orange's faction in Japan <br>Stopped reading here</br></br>  Where can I read the LNs? Are they on Nyaa? I don't need translations.  <br>Even the MC called her a bitch.</br>  <br> It is though. He wants to become a doctor and stay by her side to treat her. <br>Just because he wants in it now doesn't mean he won't change in the future. The fact he lets Silver do all that shit proves he isn't that determined to devote his life to Orange</br></br>  <br> like Haganai's author <br>Reading comprehension.<br><br><br>Just wait and see, bro.<br><br><br> Implying they don't know more than you </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think harem MC opinion holds any worth.</br>  Holy shit. Silverfags defense force stepping out of the woods.  <br>You must be new here</br>  <br>Silver always had more fans than orange though</br>  <br>Why would you think she would do the same later in the future when she feels the time is proper?<br><br><br>Explain. Even now in the latest volume he is still determined to treat Orange. So why wouldn't be stay the course if Silver was never around?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying I would know what the fuck that is <br>I bet you don't know what JoJo is either.<br> If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem <br> thinking like that orange dumbass <br>Black and Pink would happen and occupy a niche Silver didn't take.<br> She'll mature as she grow older <br>She didn't mature one bit after all these years, if anything it's very unnatural. She won't grow if left just with MC.<br> her being a baka coincides with her innocent and naive <br>She's a retard. Black is innoceny and naive yet very sharp to what's going on around. Orange is a fucktard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in at nipland. Silver cunt is most hated here. Silverfags are just overly vocal and combative, just like their gil.</br>  <br>I blame Euro kids.</br>  <br> By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up <br>Already went there and author said no.</br></br>  <br>On /a/? Not while the show was airing, at least. Thankfully people are starting to see sense.<br><br><br>So where can I read these? I just searched Nyaa but they weren't there. I'm a little tired of relying on the LNfags' word and want to read the novels to see for myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br>Popularity rolls this way :<br><br>definite #1 - Silver / Megumi<br>solid #2 - Pink / Utaha<br>faraway #3 - Orange/Eriri<br>barely exist - the rest</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Explain.</br>  <br>There were always more Silverfags and Pinkfags than Orangefags.<br><br>The Blackfags were nearly nonexistent.</br></br></br>  <br>Silver tried to support Eita and Orange hooking up. Eita went fuck this shit.</br>  <br> Why would you think she would do the same later in the future when she feels the time is proper? <br>The problem doesn't lie on her but on the MC. He's an anti-love and he only considers Chiwa as a little sister (family). She didn't manage to change the MC during all these years, what makes you think she would have been able to do so in a couple years later?<br><br> Trusting on what a fanbase says as facts <br>There's also a Masuzu faction in Japan and they are convinced she is the one who will win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is wrong. Japan : Silver &gt; Orange &gt;&gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black<br>/a/: Orange =&gt; Silver &gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black</br></br>  <br>Said no one ever.</br>  <br> /a/: Orange =&gt; Silver &gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black <br>No. You're just wrong.<br><br>Silver = Pink &gt; Black &gt; shit &gt; Orange</br></br></br></br>   yfw the Orangefag who keeps saying "wait and see" is only pretending to have read the novels and pulling things out of his ass about post-anime developments <br>It has happened before after all, see Onani Master Kurosawa's novelization. Squirrelfags' lies were exposed and it was glorious.</br>  <br> pink is 3rd <br>Orangefags go full retard</br></br>  <br><br> This is what Silverfags wants people to believe <br>Orange and Pink have always been more liked and popular. Don't make me link those two threads asking /a/ how they feel about Silver.</br></br></br>  <br> /a/: Orange =&gt; Silver &gt; Pink &gt;&gt;&gt; Black <br>It's poll time then<br>http://strawpoll.me/5051268/r</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128703808 <br> I'm not a jojofag </br>  <br>Spoilers or bullshit. Far as I know, the only girl that supported Orange was Pink. And Silver came around again in volume 9 to open her the girlfriend route again. Eita decided he can't pick either one so he went into no-love/harem end route. Now the girls have to try and do something about that.</br>  <br> So why wouldn't he stay the course if Silver was never around? <br>Because literally anything could happen<br>He could have met the other girl, change his views as he grows loder etc. My point is that saying "if silver wasn't around MC would hook up with the orange" is just completely wrong</br></br></br>  <br> Proxypoll <br>Nah.<br><br><br> those two threads asking /a/ </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> replying to a cancerous tripshit <br>Report and hide.</br></br>  <br>Go check the archives or  animesuki<br/> </br>  <br> Proxy pull <br>You fucked up.</br></br>  <br>Whether they like it or not, this is closest to the truth.

Maybe at first because he will see her as a sister, but that can easily go away (like it did in the novel). The real obstacle is MC's no love mentality. But that mentality he he holds to is fake. He's just trying to trick himself, but in reality "love" is known to him.</br>  <br>I can ask you the same thing. For that matter, this is fucking LN fiction we are talking about here. The general premise and overall plot is made to have either one win. You have to be retard to see other kind of relationships in this rom-con for Orange.<br><br><br> Fanfic. <br><br><br><br>Are you pretending to be retarded? Those kinds of interactions are a given in their routine. But when we are going to talk about when she confess for real with a serious atmosphere, things are going to be different. After some time when Orange is tired of waiting for MC to get it, she will surely make a similar or near exact confession to the one she gave to him in the LN. <br><br><br>See top above.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that can easily go away like it did in the novel <br>Again, you can't apply future events to a "what would happen in the past"</br></br>  <br>Past? You guys are basically talking ab out a WHAT IF route.

It was Orange who got EIta feeling something beyond a sister by her own actions. Orange did reacted to Silver's own actions in trying to win the MC over, but still I can definitely imagine Orange taking it upon herself to get the ball going after some time.

How do you say<br><br>To carry something? Does 持っている work?<br><br>Where should i put x?<br><br>Ill go get x.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, the guide says that kanji, vocab, and grammr should be learned at the same time, but I'm a little confused. In Anki, vocab decks use kanji for the words. In order to be able to read those, you'd need to be able to read the kanji. So wouldn't you have to know a fair amount of kanji before you can do vocab? Or am I misunderstanding?  <br>You can learn kanji when they come up in vocab words, you know.</br>  <br>運ぶ means to carry something, especially something heavy.<br><br>Where should I put X?<br>Xをどこに置きましょう？<br><br>I'll go get X.<br>Xを取って来ます。</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends. If you mean carry something somewhere it's 運ぶ, but you can't use it for objects that are too small or light like a pen. If you mean simply standing there holding the thing 持つ works.</br>  <br>Im a bit confused about to put. Could you also use 出す for a verb as to put something?</br>  <br>置く literally means put something somewhere. I don't know why you'd want to use anything else. I've never heard 出す used that way.</br>  <br>出す　is for pulling things out, like ちんこを出す</br>  <br>Yeah, that's true.</br>  <br>Oh ok, im just nervous, in japan, when i said x はどこに置くか？ I got a confused look. Is it because i didn't conjugate it into 置きましょう？<br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. けいたいをだ出した</br>  <br>x はどこに置くか? Would be interpreted as "Where are you going to put that?" You should have used 置こう / 置きましょう, or even 置くべき (should put).</br>  Today's hard. Really really hard physically. I don't want to read as much as I normally do tonight after work. Someone call me some names or post cute dekichan please.  <br>So when the verb is in volational form or べき it makes it question personal.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It's just that when you use the non-past form, it doesn't make sense as a question when you are the subject.<br><br>If you were the subject of x はどこに置くか, it would mean you were asking "Where will I put this?" not "Where should I put this?" and that is why you got a weird look. The listener can't tell you where you're GOING to put it, only where he/she wants it put.<br><br>If the listener of x はどこに置くか is the subject, then the question is "Where are you going to put it?" which makes a lot more sense, so they are more likely to interpret it that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  Putting か at the end of a non-polite sentence can be pretty rude, and か is usually used with yes or no sentences in casual speech. Most of the other things suggested so far are pretty unnatural<br><br>You want something like どこに置けばいいですか？ or in casual speech even just どこがいい？</br></br>  <br>Hmmm, i thought you could be more relaxed with that rule, but i guess not.</br>  <br> I got to study being more polite.</br>  <br><br>Would something like ほうがいいかな sound dumb as well?</br></br>  wow my reading improved a lot. Don't give up at beginner reading hell. You can do it!  <br>ほう implies a comparison between two things, so yes.</br>  <br>I started Yotsuba today. I'm reading it fairly slowly and referencing translations after each page to see if my guesses are at least somewhat accurate. It makes me feel really dumb at times when I'm completely wrong or don't really understand a line (especially when it's adults talking), but it's still a major step up from the incomprehensible scribbles it was before I started Japanese.</br>  <br> referencing translations after each page to see if my guesses are at least somewhat accurate <br>Don't do this, man.</br></br>  <br><br>Why not?</br></br>  <br>By translations, I mean the Yotsuba reading pack, a translated version of Yotsuba (just as a general idea of what the line was about if I was completely stumped), and sometimes checking the archive to see if anyone else was confused about a line in particular. I'm mostly just using it as "training wheels" so to speak and plan to stop using it after the first volume or so. Are the translations really that wrong? Or is there something wrong with checking the translation on lines that stump you?</br>  <br> guesses are at least somewhat accurate <br>If you're just guessing and have no faith in its accuracy then you should probably study some more before you read. Especially if you're doing it after each page, seriously. <br><br>Because you're basically doing the equivalent of learning from anime subs. You're enforcing in your mind someone else's specific english rendition of the text as what is correct instead of understanding the japanese on its own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I used to do this. It's great at first when you're but don't get used to only doing it. The translation isn't always there. Try going a couple of pages without it for reference. Don't listen to the haters, its great to get started.<br><br><br>I prefer Hanahira as my first reading material, since you have a text hooker you spend little to no time referencing vocab you don't know so you can focus on reading more.

Doing this significantly slowed me down and i was exhausted after 10 sentances. What i did to fix this was i signed up for LingQ, self-refered myself several times, and read "who was she". until i got used to reading. When i went back to Hanahira i was blazing through it compared to my old speed.<br><br>its really situational, but it's what got me through the beginner reading wall.

People here generally don't know or have experience with doing such and so they lash out when people ask such questions. <br><br>For speaking practice one of the best ways of getting corrections is to look for a conversation partner/tutor. If you live in an urban area you may be fortunate enough to find people advertising Japanese tutoring by natives at a per hour rate. With a bit of preparation these sorts of encounters could be used to get a whole heap of answers to questions which come to mind during study, and to get speaking practice with someone who will stop you and provide actual corrections. <br><br>italki and mylanguageexchange are decent online resources but it's a bit of a gamble. Shadowing audio from text is also a powerful tool for getting your mouth used to making Japanese sound like Japanese and can be like a wading pool of sorts to build confidence before speaking with natives/unscripted. There are plenty of websites with text/audio for basic conversations, etc. Jpod101 is great for this as their audio lessons come with a transcript with vocab and grammar points.

Proper sleep is regular times in regular intervals. Last time I overslept 15 hours my retention hit rock bottom and I completely forgot everything I learned in previous 2 days.</br></br>  <br>My sleeping habits are all fine, thanks for your concern though.<br><br><br>So far I only used anki for hiragana and katakana to speed up the learning process so I can work quicker through my book lessons which don't require any kanji.<br>I'm sure all the study-assist tools work with kanji.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure why you need anki for kana since you can learn in in a day anyway. But anki works wonders for kanji, sure.</br>  <br> in a day anyway <br><br>Took me 4 days just for hiragana. Thankfully my book lessons are a bid more forgiving and write a lot in romaji.</br></br></br>  Is anyone actually doing things the AJATT way or using Kanjidamage for kanji?<br><br>They both do a good job of hyping you up but the guide on the DJT site doesn't speak very highly of Kanjidamage.</br></br>  ちゃんとパンツはいてるか  <br>There's nothing wrong with AJATT. It's just another way of saying that immersion is the quickest way to get better at a language.</br>  <br> I don't know anything about it, but here's my opinion <br>This is the primary reason why this thread is shit<br><br><br>http://www.nisshinkyo.org/search/te<wbr>rms.php?lng=2<br>First, search for schools in the area you want to go. All accredited ones will be listed. Find ones with a good N1/EJU pass rate.<br><br>They also have the nationality breakdown for each school. Try to find a school with decent diversity, or at least a lot of westerners. What you don't want is a school with a 99% chinese student body, where you'll be the 1 faggot in the class who doesn't know the Kanji.<br><br>Next, check the school out. Some of them are really nice, with dorms, student events and trips, etc. Others are just like 1 office building and make you find cheap housing nearby. And I'm sure some are little more than fronts for people to get into the country with student visas.<br><br>Finally, be prepared to work hard. N1 in 2 years is possible but only if you study seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.nisshinkyo.org/search/co<wbr>llege.php?lng=2&amp;id=209<br><br>This is the school I was looking into the most, I dunno if the pass rates are good but it certainly isn't diverse. Looks like I've got some more school searching to do.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>How much does that stuff even cost?<br><br> 2 year course <br>My travel visa only lasts a year. And I don't want to spend that year studying in a school. What are my alternatives for such a situation?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>漢字コルヌコピア<br>-2500 kanji cards<br>-2748 total unique kanji<br>-10,000 vocab cards<br>-9650 unique words<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/9<wbr>x9c7b8x5b1np5c/%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E<wbr>3%82%B3%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8C%E3%82%B3%<wbr>E3%83%94%E3%82%A2.apkg<br>Starting on DoJG Intermediate documentation and deck from this point on. <br>Unsure of time frame. <br><br>Happy studies. <br>じゃね。</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My lesson for today, understanding and being able to tell the time in Japanese.<br><br>This sums up my thoughts so far.</br></br>  <br>The prices vary, the one I was looking at was I think around $11200USD for 2 years.

There's a reason Carol didn't try to fuck with Fine's stuff till Fine was dead for good.</br>  <br>But would Fine have a relic in this fight? I assumed she would wear Nehushtan again, but even then, being that outnumbered by scheming dolls puts her behind where I see it.<br>And isn't shenshou jing only good against other relics? It was never 'strong', it just negated other relics.</br></br>  <br>She could just pull out a strong relic out of her ass that fits the situation. She has lived forever and probably knows the location of all the relics and their effects so it wouldn't be that far off.<br><br>We only know of a few relic shards and the only complete relic was destroyed in S1. What if she brought a complete relic like Durandal or something?</br></br></br>  What do you figure are the chances of Garry surviving this season?  <br>The gears broke all of Fine's best shit, Carol has broken the gears. The hierarchy is clear. Alchemy rules, relics drool!</br>  <br>Low. Best we can hope for in terms of season 4 recruits in Elfnein or Fine coming back.</br>    <br>Carol and elfnein have a 99% chance of surviving.<br><br>The 4 autoscorers not so much.<br>It depends, maybe carol will keep them around as helpers and shit but odds are the geahs will break down the autoscorers and Carol will join the good side after suffering a complete defeat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Fine returns with a new Solomon's Cane and begins a Noise vs AlcaNoise war </br></br></br>  <br>u wot mate</br>  <br>Hibiki: Always goes for open hands+Rinshan Kaihou<br>Miku: Literally Toki, complete with charging Hibiki via copious thigh touching<br>Tsubasa: Characters, honors<br>Chris: Cheap, fast hands<br>Maria: Beginner's Luck<br>Kirika: Can feel the power in an opponent's hand and cut it out, dragons because dragons are cool dess<br>Shirabe: Dots</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Any of the geahs <br> Sitting down to play games <br><br>They're much better suited to hot blooded action instead of little girl's games</br></br></br></br>  <br> DO THAT AT HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM<wbr>MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Jesus christ my sides are on the moon</br></br></br>  <br>They haven't killed any named characters except Fine and Mamu so far, though. Kanade doesn't really count as that was effectively a flashback.<br><br>Killing the dolls, who are clearly sentient and not just mindless monsters, would be quite a step.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Only 1 person has died from combat and that was <br>Kanade, <br><br> So the dolls are gonna get befriended or something<br> I hope ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why not hotblooded little girl's games?</br></br>  <br>Seeing as Fine wasn't able to activate either of the two complete relics we have seen, except for help from geah's gathering phonic gain and Biki being Biki, it's safe to assume that she can't easily harness some 'out of her ass that fits the situation' relic.<br>I also doubt that she knows of other relics because she would have gathered them only to steal them later, like the other two.<br>If she brought Durandal and Nehushtan, or had access to other crazy relics, it would be a fight I'd have to see to believe.</br></br></br>  Which Geah the sexiest?  <br>It's just as likely that Carol will die like Fine did at the end of the first season. She's not a real little girl. She's allowed to die.</br>  <br> little girl's games </br>  <br>I like Sword's and Hibiki's body types best.</br>  Maria figma looks so out of place next to the others  <br>Maria. She was almost Eve of the new world, after all. Probably explains why she sucks at everything else. She's meant solely for childrearing.</br>  <br> Did you replace the coke with carbon dust? </br>  <br>Maria is almost 30, though. She gets point subtracted for being old.</br>  <br> Kanade <br><br>Maria, though Biki and Kirika are a close second.</br></br></br>    <br>Just Sayaka being a shit like usual.</br>  <br> 21 <br> almost 30 </br></br>  <br>Who is the Sayaka of Symphogear?</br>  <br>Nana looses her voice ep 7 because project ignite's modification literally set the gear on fire and burn her alive.Her agonizing screams are then used to activate whatever carol needs to destroy the world.</br>  <br>She had trouble activating them before but now she has 6 gear users + Miku who was shown to be capable of handling a gear so activating one would probably be a lot easier. Hibiki also mastered her ability of being able to somehow control swan songs with that S2CA triburst attack thing so maybe they could channel all that phonic gain on a dormant relic to awaken it.<br><br>She could also improve her own original theory of how the geahs work or just find new shards of the same relic for them to use, the possibilities are endless because anything can happen in symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Chris &gt; Biki = Fine &gt; Kirika = Maria &gt; *</br></br>  <br>Hibiki, if this season goes a certain way.</br>  Left or right?  <br>Please stop posting pages when I know I can't save Nanoha.</br>  <br>Don't reply to age-bait kun.

SHE CAN GROW A DICK.</br>  <br><br>You are now imagining Berserker Hibiki holding a doll head in one outstretched hand with a mechanical spinal column swinging down from it</br></br>  <br>She gets better. Pretty quickly too.</br>  <br>Elfnein has a barbie body anon, she wasnt equipped with unnecessary bodyparts and im sure the other 4 autoscorers are the same way</br>  <br><br> This triggers me SO much, I want a CHRISSSSSS figma, But all they have is a nendro and that shitty 1/7 bunny </br></br>  <br> The White Devil being stopped by a mere stabbing <br>She's fine anon.

It only wiped out Hibiki's relic cancer. Hibiki constantly using Gungnir given by Maria could have slowly restarted the Gungnir in her heart. <br><br>This would cause quite a problem to carol and the autoscorers as you can't break a relic that is already broken. Unless they try to kill Hibiki.</br></br>  <br>Chris is a slut, a SLUT.</br>  <br>If Hibiki actually blamed Miku for what happened I think these threads would meltdown and never recover.</br>  <br> Heart ahoge </br>  <br>No one gives a shit about faceless males or females really.</br>  So does this mean we'll get Berserk Tsubasa?  <br>this fucked me up</br>  <br><br>Really?<br><br>Because Hibiki won't shut up about saving people<br><br>Do they not count as people?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miku is clearly the only person Hibiki actually cares about.</br>  <br> IGNITE just means fusing with the geah <br>More geah cancer incoming</br></br>  Alright, S2 hater here. Has this season redeemed the series yet? Has Hibiki stopped sulking around? Is the plot going anyway? Has the other characters gotten good development?  <br>No they don't and never have.</br>  <br>Watch it yourself or fuck off.</br>  <br> Has Hibiki stopped sulking around? <br>She stopped for a while but now she's back at it again.</br></br>  <br>Shit's fucked yo, they've destroyed every gear except Igalima and Shul Shagana.</br>  <br>Heresy</br>  <br><br>Her and berserk Chris would be amazing<br><br>Can you even imagine the pool of rage and angst they have to draw from?<br><br><br><br>We can rebuild them<br><br>We have the technology<br><br> They'll just be insane genocide machines is all </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then she got over it just in time to get blown the fuck out.</br>  <br><br>Damn, those are some really perky tits</br></br>  <br><br>Seriously? What heresy are they doing to Hibiki? What happened to determination to fist?</br></br>  <br><br>She's dead you fucking idiot</br></br>  <br>Determination to fist wasn't enough against the power of plot.</br>  <br>She was falling, thus the lumps of fat were elevated.</br>  <br>Turns out determination doesn't stop blades.</br>  <br>She found her determination and had maybe one of her best moments in the series since that time she punched the hell out of Chris in s1.<br><br>And then things took an unfortunate turn.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What if Carol revives Bikki as a autoscorer/alchemical zombie and makes her fight the other girls?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I hope they're not going to do something stupid like introduce a completely new gear that we haven't known about until now for the sole purpose of bringing her back.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I could dig it</br></br>  <br>She fell victim to a certain mechanical rusemistress.</br>  <br><br>If only, she had the gear on just long enough to survive that fall.<br><br>Her dying would be a pretty neat twist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki might mess up a lot, but she would never willing hurt miku.</br>  <br>Just fucking watch it, it's great.</br>  <br>Hibiki &gt; Chris = Maria &gt; Kirika = Tsubasa &gt; Miku &gt; Shirabe</br>  <br>No, wait. I just realized they could just bring back Fine and her Nehushtan Armor to bring Hibiki back to life. Which would be stupid in its own way.</br>  <br>Fine is dead and Nehushtan was destroyed. Try again!</br>  <br>No. People were saying the same thing for S2 when it was airing. I won't fall for the same ruse again.</br>  <br/>  <br>Not gonna happen, Deinslef and alchemy are the two big things this season.</br>  <br><br>Both are dust nerd</br></br>   Carol needs the Symphogear's power in some way to power the Chateau de Tiffauges <br> Either corrupted or under her control <br> Lets a clone of herself with implanted memories and a demonic relic run away <br> Orders the dolls to fight the Symphogirls with their gears activated so they can damage the gear but not the inner relic <br> Relic can still be used but no Fine to repair them <br> Elfnein conveniently proposes to repair and enhance them with the demon relic she carries <br> BAD END <br><br>This is pretty convoluted but Carol sure is smart compared to fucking Ver.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why are you even here then</br>  <br>Fine could just reincarnates into Hibiki's body, uses a hidden fragment of the Nehushtan Armor to regenerate Hibiki's body while defending it from harm, and then relinquish control in a teary farewell.</br>    <br>To sort out what's hype and what's genuine within these threads to see if S3 is good or not.</br>  <br>Whose eyes are those?</br>  <br>If you didn't notice, last thread we had some guests.</br>  <br>He has to be a faggot somewhere and today he chose this thread.</br>  <br><br> Hibiki and Kanade after they've been revived with alchemy </br></br>  <br>Thus far it's shaping up to be better than S1 and S2 with stakes far higher and the power definitely in the enemy's favour.<br><br>Also Black Gungnir made a reappearance.<br><br>Convinced yet?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you do it without knowing how great is S3 so far?</br>  <br>Tsubasa  and Shirabe. </br>  <br><br>I hate that I want this</br></br>  <br>Fine will never reincarnate again.</br>  <br>They fixed her soul via alchemy, checkmate.</br>  <br>I was there for all of the S1 and S2 threads. They were constantly hyping S2 and saying how good each episode was despite how it was not. S1 had roughly equal parts hype as well as legitimate criticism. Basically, if all I see in these threads are posts that are constantly reposting the same images and praises over and over again, I know I should avoid S3.<br><br><br>That depends, did she accomplish anything worthwhile with it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Biki will be comatose for 4+ episodes until symphogear miracle magic brings her back.</br>  <br>That's not how alchemy works!</br>  <br> this is fucked up <br> NOISE used to turn people to ash <br> crowds of people being killed in an instant </br></br></br>  <br>Great: Chris, Maria<br>Better: Bikki, Tsubasa<br>Best: Shirabe, Kirika,</br></br></br>  <br>It works however Symphogear wants it to work. If Fine can somehow reincarnate through genetic manipulation, then alchemy can repair the soul.</br>  <br> That depends, did she accomplish anything worthwhile with it? <br>She saved the lives of Hibiki, Miku, and the Stroganettes, as well as  accidentally  preventing Gungnir from being broken by Garie  just for Hibiki to get it broken later that episode </br></br>  So when is she going to get pregnant with his child?  <br>Swords don't get pregnant anon. They do the impregnating</br>  Remember guys  <br>Hibiki a shit, Maria a best</br>  <br>So, did she win that battle, or did she took a beating and lost the battle but ultimately managed to save their lives?</br>  <br>Now, we are Japanese we are about in confusion in Abe's bill<br>And not be forbidden to question the attitude like that is evil battle itself absolutely rejected<br><br>The first place people prefer the dispute<br>In the past, such as samurai Miyamoto is an ancestor of our Musashi also as sublime the fight itself<br>And I have devoted my life<br>It is a fight is a fight for life of people<br>Now economic warfare, also information war probably have become important<br>Nevertheless elements armed occupied the tactics of the Diet Affairs countries large<br>As a matter of course.

Which isn't exactly something to be ashamed of, since the Dolls are at this point shown to be more powerful than any of the Geahs. Hell, Chris and Tsubasa both lost to Boss Mook Noise. <br><br> The backlash from using Gungnir without LiNKER caused it to shatter and deactivate before Garie could break the pendant, at which point Garie decided the fight didn't need to go on and she retreated. </br></br></br>  <br>She certainly accomplished more than Hibiki. That makes it a victory.</br>  <br>Yeah..., which was basically all she did for the first half of S2. She was nigh useless what few battles she was in and yet still somehow managed to accomplished her primary goal through the power of contrived plot.</br>  <br> Hibiki dies and Project Iginite causes her to revive as Bersk-Hibiki <br><br> The rest of the season is spent on everyone being angst as they try to kill Hibiki again </br></br></br>  <br>It was nice how she used Tsubasa'ss experience fighting the Alca-Noise and avoided all the Symphogear destroying bits.</br>  <br>You seem upset anon. Maybe you should avoid these threads so you don't get agitated when I post.</br>  <br>They're hardly going to have her out of the picture for that long in the season that's supposed to be all about her development.</br>  <br>Well, shit. I had typed this  before reading your post. That is some contrived plot victory there.</br>  <br>Nice blog, subscribed! Now fuck off because no one cares.</br>  <br>Yes, I'm very angry right now, so please go watch anime instead of asking us what we think like a brainless moron. It takes less than an hour to watch the first 3 episodes.</br>  <br> still no Listen to my Bait! </br>  <br>If you can't respond to some of the legitimate concerns people have for the season, then perhaps it isn't really as good as it's hyped up to be. If all you can respond with is 'watch the show' and not tell me why it's good without resorting to 'it just is', then maybe it's really not that good to begin with.</br>  <br> most likely would have lost to Garie <br> not she would of gotten destroyed  <br><br>Tsubasa couldn't even scratch the green doll who is way stronger than Maria running on 0 Linker. Hibiki was the only one they even recognized as an opponent due to her raw power. <br><br> Wow it took two of you to kill me </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh right, there was once a time when the Noise were actually somewhat threatening.</br>  <br>It's not good so fuck off. Posting blog shit and asking us to decide for you if something is worth watching is against the rules.</br>  <br>You sound like you belong better at reddit or some shithole like it</br>  <br> S2 hater <br><br>But Symphogear G was when the show went from an extremely uneven series to legitimately good.</br></br></br>    <br>"Good" is a subjective word to use to describe something. All people can do here and tell you why THEY think Symphogear is good FOR THEM. Asking people to pick out the thing they like about the show and apply it towards your tastes is pretty unfair. "Watch the show" is a perfectly legitimate response to your complaints. If you can't find something "good" for you then Symphogear is not for you. However, it doesn't make the show automatically bad. It's just a show you don't like and you don't HAVE to like. But you can't force people to dislike it too.</br>    <br><br>So what kind of porn does Genjuro fap to?</br></br>  <br><br>Security camera footage of his niece</br></br>  <br>None because it's not an action movie.</br>  <br><br>Clearly sir you are not watching the right porn</br></br>  <br><br> UNCLE! </br></br>  G was a step down and GX has been on par with S1 so far.<br><br>But nothing will ever beat the hype and insanity of Mikugeah.</br></br>  <br>Fine Anon here you go.</br>  <br><br>Not the anon that requested this, but this is amazing. Thanks.</br></br>  I just started watching S2 and i just saw maria use Gungnir. How is marie's character and when the obligatory redemption/recruitment go comes is she useful next to the other geahs?  <br>That would be true if I'm asking one person. But when there's entire group of people and not many of them can adequately say why they think this season is good, then maybe it's safe to say the chances of me enjoying the show has gotten much lower. Yes, I do agree what one likes depends on the person, but when I'm asking them why they like it and they can't respond, then their recommendation to just watch the show sounds less sincere. After all, if a group of people can't say why it's good, then maybe it just isn't and not worth the time invested. No one is telling them to dislike it, I just want to know why they do like it.</br>   beef   <br> is she useful next to the other geahs? </br>  <br>What's the point of asking that? Just watch the fucking show and find out.</br>  <br><br>I like the Noise just standing there waiting for the useless side character to finish talking</br></br>  <br> sincere <br>Nobody here is trying to convince you to watch the show. You're just treating people like your personal reviewers to help you make your decision. <br><br> great songs <br> cute girls <br> insane action <br> thrilling pacing <br> deepest lore <br> lesbians <br> self-conscious without being pretentious highbrow self-parody <br> nana <br> /m/ pandering <br>There, those are some of the main reasons people like it. Do you feel like you're prepared to decide whether you like the show now? No don't answer, I don't give a fuck. Just watch the show and come back after you have or go away and don't come back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great action, great music, drama, interesting villains just to name a few. But honestly, you keep asking people to pander to you but if you use your brain, you'd realize that if this season wasn't good nobody would be here. Or in /a/ style, everybody would be talking about how shitty it is.</br>  <br> commie </br>  Considering how useful Ogawa is on the field, why the fuck isn't he down there more often      <br> Ninja <br><br>How do you know he isn't?</br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki <br> sulking around <br> S2 </br></br></br>  <br>Can't do shit to Noise.</br>  <br>Garie is commanding them and she only cares about getting Bikkie to sing, though she did seem intent on killing a friend to force her hand.</br>  <br><br>Why is Hibiki so shit?</br></br>  <br>Backup.</br>  <br><br>Anyone else surprised Gary didn't just grab Miku and start ripping her clothes off?<br><br>Seems like the easiest way to get Biki berserk</br></br></br></br>  <br>Could you spell out bait like the other images, no rush.</br>  <br>You're shit.</br>  <br>She doesn’t know a lot about Bikkie’s private life, otherwise beef-chan wouldn’t have been able to fool her that easily.</br>    <br>Does Beef-chan have beef roasties?</br>  <br><br>Somebody draw this.</br></br>  <br> not watching everything </br>  what was the deal between Garie and Carol disagreeing<br>I thought carol's plan was damaging the phonic gain'd gears so that the relic is intact but they're forced to repair/taint them with the cursed relic elf9 brought<br>but then Carol is like "silence them and destroy their songs" while apparently Garie wanted them to sing first<br>it seemed to make sense but that 20 seconds scene makes everything weird again, like I'm playing MGS4 for the first time</br></br></br>  <br><br> beef-chan <br>Please, yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Beef-chan and the stroganettes</br>  It sucks that hibiki always get shat on<br> loli geah calls her a hypocrite for wanting to help others so they won't suffer <br>Is this truly retardation or is just mindgames at this point? its really hard to tell sometimes</br></br>  <br>She does have udders after all.</br>  <br>Just seems like they can't do anything to the gears when they're inactive.<br>So Hibiki not being able to sing and Maria dropping transformation before Garie got to strike means that they couldn't attack the gear at that time.<br><br>The little argument was just Carol thinking Garie was screwing around and not attacking the gears properly.</br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck Carol in the butt  <br> beouf <br><br>It's bœuf.</br></br></br>  <br>DONT</br>  <br><br>Get in line.</br></br>    <br><br>You made me do it asshole.<br><br>We need this with Chris or Shirabe's twintails.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We need it with Carol's braid.</br>  <br>Do homunculi even have butts?</br>    <br><br>Probably, since it's a copy of a human body it probably needs sustenance and thus a digestive system.<br>Or maybe they're semen powered.</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Miku looks like a sexual deviant</br>  <br>Who is that seaman demon?</br>  <br>Adding another cutie to my adoption list.</br>  <br><br>loli get</br></br>  <br>Even if you kill a user you can find another one.<br>However if you destroy the relic then you pretty much win.<br><br>So yeah, Carol doesn't want them to die, she wants to humiliate them by destrying their gears, their hopes and dreams and then finally she'll destroy them by using their memories to power the autoscores.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria.<br><br> After the dead fluffy rooster, that is. </br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Offer her an egg in these trying times, and then actually wake up because my subconscious realizes I'm an unfunny faggot memeslinger.</br>  <br>I was far too concerned with Miku to give a shit about that.</br>  <br>It needed to happen.<br><br>If only it weren't necessary somehow.</br></br></br>  <br>Happy valhalla alternate universe spinoff ala Gundam Boyfriends/Nanoha Innocent when?</br>  <br>You can always hug a charcoal</br>  <br>Stop posting in your sleep and wake up, Bikki, you're worrying Miku.</br>  MALK when?  <br> not an action movie <br><br>Every scene starring The Cook.</br></br></br>  Th-they'll still need him for the LiNKER, right?<br>Right?</br>   Zerkiki kills Genjuro   Daily reminder that hotblooded Symphoguys never  <br>Good.</br>  Chocolate Geahs when?  <br>Hopefully never.</br>  Im sure this is going to happen this season  ;_;   Who tops?  <br><br>They alternate.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe  spins them around all night .</br>  <br>Shirabe  only wishes she could overpower the absolute dom that is Kirika dess </br>  <br>Shirabe  is a power bottom. </br>  Shirabe  thinks Kirika is smarter than her.   <br>No just that she has more common sense.</br>  <br>Shirabe  easily misjudges people. </br>  When?  <br>With luck, it'll be the killing blow against Yellow.

It sounds like yaoi and I get annoyed when people try to apply it to cute gay girls. A lot of female yuri mangaka also do yaoi and I dislike the majority of them for bringing their yaoi garbage into yuri. I call myself a yuri fan but I rarely ever see anything I like. DMJii is an awesome couple though and neither of them are seme/uke or any of the bullshit.</br>  <br><br>I just don't like that stupid fixed role bullshit. It's forcing outdated male/female role concepts onto gay couples. As if relationships were impossible without one playing the dominant male part and one the submissive female part.</br></br>  <br>Top/bottom =/= male/female gender roles. Go back to tumblr please.</br>  <br>In hetero relationships the dominant part is usually associated with the male and the submissive part with the female.

In order to beat her when she fusionned with a relic in the first season, they had to use three full power symphogears and a relic. And even after that, the Nehustan armor still had enough power to allow her to take a part of the Moon and pull it towards the Earth.<br><br>Symphogears are Finè's lowest, her plan relied on using relics to outdo them. Wich ended up not working because of teamwork and phonic gains.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Garie and Carol disagreeing <br>Wait, when did that happen?</br></br>  <br>'disagreeing' is an exaggeration. Garie failed her mission of disabling the Gungnir, Carol drew attention to it. Didn't even criticise her.</br>  <br>They didn't really disagree, Carol just lightly admonished Garie for appearing to be having fun on the job. Garie explained herself in her flippant way and Carol dropped it.</br>  Just how fucking big is Symphogear in nipland? this is a huge lot of people  <br><br>Yeah, it just felt like your usual "I'm surrounded by incompetent people who can never get a simple job done."<br><br>Your typical villain stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear isn't big, but Nana is huge.</br>  <br>I imagine the fanbase is just more willing to spend than most other anime considering how much they spend on CDs and all that.

The playerbase votes with their wallet and accepts it, causing Konami to make mad bucks. Why would they do anything else?</br></br>  <br>The OCG also doesn't deal with this shit and KoJ still gets mad amounts of money for cards, the TCG just does things to get even more money and not give two shits about the game unlike KoJ.</br>  <br><br>The fuck does he need all that draw power for<br>What does he want</br></br></br>  Haven't been in the threads for two weeks. Anything interesting happen besides the Crow thing?  <br>Ancient Leaf means he's only playing Tags and he's planning on Tributing his partner's monsters, or drawing into Storm Forth.</br>  <br>People need to stop thinking big multinationals are their friends, if people want a change they need to actually make a stand and adjust their buying patterns.

They don't have the problem of people not buying the new pack unless it contains the next meta deck. Also, Japanese players had to deal with the DT stuff, like Trishula being ridiculously expensive.<br><br>Western players have nobody but themselves to blame for the powercreep, when sets like JOTL and CROS fail hard because they don't have broken cards.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128684010 <br>Fuck you :v</br>  <br> Prophecy <br>I bet you prefer whore bitches cardfus from archetypes than things that really matter like Red-Eyes</br></br>  <br> No more Speed Spells in Riding Duels <br> all those faggots saying "If you want Speed Spells go watch 5Ds" <br> nobody likes Action Cards <br> Action Cards in Riding Duels <br><br>HAHA FAGGOTS ENJOY YOUR "MUH NO SPEED SPELLS" NOW<br><br> B-But there's no speed spells cuz you can't print them, r-right? <br><br>LOLNOPE<br><br>I WISH I COULD COLLECT EVERY MOMENT THESE THREADS WERE BTFO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So when are we all gonna duel to find out the Kingu among us?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128684010 <br>He only summoned his kawaii cardfu once<br>shit/10</br></br>  <br>What the fuck does that even say<br><br>I can't believe someone actually got paid to make this and now it will be mass produced</br></br></br>  <br>You don't put Action Cards in your Main deck, moron.

They are normal duels, except they ride bikes. There's nothing to explain.</br>  <br><br>There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds. But the writers duped us and instead of using Speed Spells, they chose Action Cards.<br><br>Slimy fucks</br></br></br></br>  <br> reading <br> in a fucking public location <br><br>This makes absolutely no sense<br><br>How did you get to the library? Your car? Where do you sleep at night?

At least Angel Baton led to skilly as fuck plays</br></br>  <br> reading comprehension <br><br>I was talking about the title of the card, asshole</br></br></br>  Greydles are fucking stupid<br>That is all</br>  <br>NTR-V<br>T<br>R<br>V</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w4w<wbr>q5_5dUhE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Masked Hero players are angry virgins </br></br>  <br>So is your mom.</br>  <br>What's wrong with being a waifufag anon? I literally made a deck with mine and the Red-Eyes cards in CORE set thanks that they are Lv 7, but after this I have to search another alternative, if you don't like it, don't buy it, I for sure am not gonna waste money for Konami and their rarity fetish, so I just stick with other ideas.</br>  <br>Does anyone have videos of duels where people are losing or do lose and throw a fit?<br><br>Neckbeards getting mad at a card game would be hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>When the opening of the season replaced the Action Duel thing with the Riding Duel, I had hope that we would get a break from them. I don't know about you guys but it kinda kills tension for me most of the time when a guy can always get a card that bails him out just by reaching offscreen and pulling one. At least resources have to be used with situational stuff. I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum. I just wanted a break from Action Duels.</br>  <br> I was talking about the title of the card, asshole <br> What the fuck does that even say <br><br>No, i'm pretty sure you just didnt make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br> OP 4 will never be done by Nona Reeves <br><br>Kill me.</br></br></br>   tfw I read the script now and Gongenzaka has Pendulum <br>Now I can expect something for Yuzu right?</br>  <br>She still has her generic Pendulums.</br>  <br>They've both had Pendulum since the Championship.</br>  <br> Now I can expect something for Yuzu right? <br>No. Gon is working for Reiji who gave everyone Pendulums. Yuzu won't have Melodious Pendulums for now at least.</br></br>  <br>The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot.<br><br>I think you are just being retarded and reeling me in with this b8</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji probably just walked into her room and handed her new Pendulums. He does whatever the fuck he wants.</br>  <br> I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum <br>Why? They don't even treat Pendulums like they are half Spell Cards in the anime.</br></br>  Tadaima  <br>There are no Kingus among us, we'd all scrub out against each other and just draw constantly.</br>  <br> Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise <br><br>Not really. Speed Spells work just like regular spells just that they a little more restricted. <br>Speed Spell and Speed Counters were great because contrary to their name they slowed the game down and both player had to built up their counters before doing the big plays. Meanwhile Arc-V duels don't last longer than three turns for the most part</br></br></br></br>  <br>All could have been resolved if he was there instead.<br><br>I bet Chojiro could bring Sora's EGAO back.</br></br></br>  <br> I just dropped by to say hello and hope you ENJOY your stay at LDS' very own Maiami Medical Function </br>  <br> The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot. <br>Oh, so I was right the first time then<br> Why cant I read the low rez blurry scan? <br>The English version of the card isnt even out retard, all we have is CAC version and the shitty scans Konami just put up</br></br></br></br>  <br>jokes on you, i dont local/tourny i just enjoy spellcaster decks. and i dont see how that "wrecked" me in anyway only thing i wrecked was your mom last night faggot.</br>  <br>Activating a Pendulum in the Pendulum Scale counts as activating a Spell Card.</br>  <br>That would be Serena's room he's going to walk into, not Yuzu's. And Serena won't be using those Pendulums for a long while, just like Shun-niichan.</br>  <br>This really looks legit</br>  <br>Pendulums become Spell Cards in the Scale Zone, it's like this in the anime too. Spell Destruction can easily ruin Pendulums.</br>  <br>there are very few videos but they are in the pits of youtube....</br>  <br><br>They could've easily made an exception rule for pendulums.</br></br>   Gogenzaka getting sent into a labor camp <br>He's probably going to befriend everybody there just like he did in prison, won't he.<br><br>It'll be hilarious if Gongenzaka is actually the one to end up uniting the Commons against the Tops.</br></br></br>  If I was Dan Green I'd learn whatever I could about competitive YGO, then enter tournaments under a pseudonym. Then once I sit down to games I'd mindbreak them by detailing every play I make in full Yami voice.  <br>Serena probably wont ever use them honestly, she's too prideful to Fusion. Besides what would her Pendulums even be, Moonlight Silver Crane and Moonlight Brown Raccoon?</br>  <br> just like Shun-niichan. <br><br>R-Ruri?</br></br></br>  Recently I was watching Monster Musume because I wanted to start watching ecchi anime, and after the third episode, I just though about how a Yu-Gi-Oh! harem ecchi anime would be and what monsters would appear, big points if Dark Magician Girl is just support Ms. Smith tier instead of one of the girls. Whaddya think?  <br>I say you should leave this place before you get your ass kicked and carded.</br>  <br>They'd be broken then. It'd be a lot harder to get rid of them and you'd almost certainly have to use certain monster effects to get rid of the Pendulums as opposed to the actual monsters on the field.</br>  <br>More like Yuya will make her pendulums though the magic pendant to give as a gift to her after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ and then finally Pendulum. And Yuya goes in reverse gaining Pendulum first then XYZ/Pendulum then Synchro/Pendulum and then finally Fusion/Pendulum.</br>  <br>Are you Shun or Sora? If you are Shun you can be part of that show with 4 Ruris. If you are Sora leave please I don't want fusion scum near me.</br>  <br>If every episode is a beach episode then sure, I'm down...maybe cute date episodes too.</br>  <br> after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ <br>Not too long ago you guys were sure as sure she'd learn XYZ during the championship arc. Maybe its time to accept Standard people learning multiple summoning methods (besides Pendulum) will mainly be reserved for Yuya and Reiji</br></br>  <br>Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it. Everyone else has their reasons for their specific summoning methods. <br><br>And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means.</br></br></br>  I have a feeling that Masumi and Yaiba will be sent to Synchro as back up at some point.<br><br> And Masumi will Xyz Summon Gem-Knight Pearl </br></br>  <br>I doubt that will happen, but boy it will be popular.<br><br> cute date episodes too. <br>I ship Yosenju Kamamitachi (3) with Harpie Girl and Harpie Dancer so if something like this happen it will be perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rock up to your local <br> agree to duel some guy <br> you both sit down <br> IT'S TIME TO DUEL <br> wait what the fu- <br> I PLACE ONE CARD FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it <br>He seems to be more the Advanced summon guy than anything, he even did it with Yosenju<br><br> And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means. <br>We can be pretty sure Rin hasnt, and hopefully Ruri hasnt or Shun will cry</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ooh, and Yaiba could pull out Invoker.</br>  <br>We have to find out if she Synchro summons when it is her turn in the tournament. If she does then it is a good likelihood of her learning all summoning methods. The irony is that the timing would fit since right now soon there will be a Synchro booster set, followed by a XYZ booster set and if the pattern follows a Fusion booster set announced soon after that.</br>  <br> other guy spends 5 minutes playing solitaire <br> declares his attack <br> mirror force <br> starts raging <br> MIND CRUSH <br> silence all around <br> Dan just gets up and struts off proud of himself </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  High Speed Ruris.  <br>As a big Ecchi fan, that will be the best thing ever. Besides the classic ones, I think that they can put monsters that don't have anime or manga appearances based on<br> Level <br> Rank <br> Summon Method <br> Extra Deck <br> Ritual <br>And I think that Rituals will be either the most bullied for being non-Extra Deck or the most difficult to date because of their non-Extra Deck, but they will be the most worthwhile in both cases.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, Sawatari is a lot like Yuya honestly, I could see him slowly starting to incorporate the other summoning methods.</br>  <br>Konami needs to release his archetype first though.</br>  <br>Multiple summoning methods is portrayed as a really highly skilled thing, Yuyas only able to do it because DRAGONS. I love Shingo, but I dont think he has the skill for it</br>  <br>At this point anything is possible. We really haven't seen much of the Underworld Troupe, besides that it's Pendulum. Hell, it could just be a pure Pendulum deck with a Pendulum boss.</br>  <br>not just dragons anon don't forget Yuzu</br>  <br>Before being stuck with troupe, he did study and incorporate new strategies (monarch deck, pendulum strategy with Yosenju), so him picking up stuff is not impossible.<br>With the scale 1-8 pendulums, 2500 Ace and ENTERTAINMENT DUEL focus, he is pretty much trying to be Yuya, so he could copy that too</br></br>  <br>Hiiiii</br>  <br>Sawatari has skill, he's just dumb and arrogant, like Serena. He clearly knows how decks and cards work outside of his first appearance/duel which he fucked up, everything after that he's been pretty on point and look at his deck now. <br><br> Pendulum <br> 2500 Ace <br> Entertainment Dueling <br> Bugging Yuya in the Manzai and trying to be his friend <br><br>He's trying to emulate Yuya, after seeing Gon Pendulum Synchro, I'd imagine he'd want to get even stronger himself and prove that he's not a weakling and holding people back. He's going to have that one amazing moment in Academia where he just goes off, but still fails in the end due to keikaku by Yuri or Dennis or some shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   &gt; Black Stone of Legend is a secret rare <br>YAMEROOOOOO</br>  <br>yuya a cute!</br>  <br><br>I want Sawatari to step his game up so badly, but even after repeatedly getting BTFO he thinks he's good, so he'll never git gud ;____;</br></br>  <br>What if he actually did lose on purpose though? We'll never know, like why do kids love cinnamon toast crunch?</br>  <br>But we still don't know what all of his new Underworld Troupe deck is like.</br>  <br> World where you can summon (by a big price) your monster and be with you <br> Level and Rank are usually rivals unless they have the same numbers, also numbers don't have any effect whatsoever <br> Normal/Non-Effect monsters and Effect monsters don't get along very well <br> There are multiple copies monsters in the worlds, but you can only summon 1 monster, and it have to be one that you opened in a booster (there are exceptions) <br> Monsters that you summon in real life depends on this: <br> Any Main Deck monster other than Pendulum and Ritual: they can get along very well with you and be bros <br> Ritual: the most hardest to summon because you have to Tribute something (though not necesarily lifes as a Hungry Burger was summoned using 6 burger found in the trash), and still will appreciate/support you/love you forever because you sacrifice something for them, depending on the genre/type/attribute they could be the best ones for anything, even better than Xyz in many cases, but you need to develop your relationship with them <br> Fusion: usually the more easier in some cases but not so worthy, because they were summoned using more than 1 monster, they almost always have some different personalities, but if you learn to deal with it, they are like the Main deck ones <br> Synchro: the most interesting ones as you can bring any Synchro monster with different monster and anything can happen, if you bring a Tempest Magician with an Effect Veiler she can get some breast complex <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br> Pendulum: literally newcomers and people need to wait for more information. <br> fuck my autism </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we do, we know they're funky and sassy</br>  <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br>I sense some butthurt</br></br>  <br>Ritual master race reporting in.</br>  <br>Are ritual Red-Eyes better than Xyz spam the whole field?</br>  <br> XYZ spam <br> in front of Lord of the Red <br>That would be fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Uhh isn't Flare Metal dragon not destroyed by card effects while it has Xyz?? Also Return of Red-Eyes still summons a Red-Eyes even when destroyed</br>  <br> not using both <br><br>I love having Lord of the Red, Flare Metal, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, and Azure Eyes Silver Dragon all on the field. I hope Red-Eyes get their own Synchro.</br></br></br>  How can I ENJOY the card game when my favorites archetypes are expensive, Konami-kun?<br><br>I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid. There is any other good cards on Clash of Rebellions which may become Secret Rare too on TCG?<br><br>Also, I miss Future Fusion/Dragon's Mirror combo to summon 2 FGDs.</br></br></br></br>  So when will Academia ruin the Friendship Cup? Before Yugo beats Yuya or when Dennis reveals he is a traitor like Jack?  <br>Archfiend Black Skull Dragon seems too slow with Red-Eyes fusion and has no protection</br>  <br> draw red-eyes fusion <br> use it to summon ABSD right away <br>It's pretty fast. And it's a pet deck, who cares if it doesn't have protection on it. It's meant for  fun .</br></br></br>  <br>I really love the design of the Xyz Red-Eyes.</br>  <br><br>But what I'm saying i that the anime doesn't treat them as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>Was that confirmed or are you just saying that?</br>  <br>When I mean slow I mean you can't summon/special summon anything else but yeah your right this deck is meant for fun</br>  <br>I'm going off the fact that no cards that have been used so far that target, negate, or destroy S/T's have been used on Pendulums<br><br>Also, even though the character point out "So Pendulum cards go to the Extra Deck" no one has made a remark like "So Pendulum card are half Monster half Spell?"</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sawatari couldn't have used Cricket Close in his first duel with Yuya if the Pendulums weren't treated as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure it does</br>  <br>Ah you're right, my apologies then.</br>   TCG will never make mill viable   <br> What is BA <br>Hot garbage that somehow still manages to live<br> What is Diamond killing any and all mill decks <br>The reason why BA is hot garbage</br></br></br></br>  So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right?  <br>So, if I have an Herald of Ultimateness, will he be like, my most perfect attorney?</br>   Stratos still banned for 10+ seasons in murrica, while its not in Japan <br><br>Someone please do jihad on konami or murrica</br></br>  <br> he summons HoU <br> he always get in trouble because he is your typical bad luck brian "law version" <br> tfw he can be declared not guilty in every courtroom but he tries to be lawful till the end even if he sucks at it. <br>I actually love this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of Monarch's biggest issues is ratios between themselves and fodder. Looks like he focused solely on monarchs and tributing his partners' monsters in a tag duel like a real scumbag.</br>  <br>Someone needs to fire Tewart</br>  <br>Do you not know what mill is?</br>  <br><br>No he didn't. He did exactly what he would have done had he not realized that. It's just to make Gon   and his butthurt fans   feel better about losing. Otherwise he'd go on and cry the next episodes about how he failed to avenge Yuya</br></br>  <br> I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid <br> Trying to be hipster for a deck that was used in the original anime <br>Anon please</br></br></br>  <br> So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right? <br>Gonfags are so delusional. They dont even understand the character they keep defending if they think that's something he'd ever do</br></br>  <br>KoA's evil truly knows no bounds.</br>  <br><br>It's not real Gonfags. It's just buttmad Crowhaters pretending to be Gonfags. You'll notice that every character wins will suddenly have an obnoxious "fanbase" that wanted to see their character win. Heck I bet even fucking Shinji will suddenly have a rabbid and butthurt fanbase when Crow wins against him next round</br></br>  Who will card ENJOY? I bet its that traitor Jack or Bennis  <br>Of Black Stone in Japanese? Like 200 yen. A playset of Ultra Flare Metal Dragons is about 900 yen. Although it'll be like $10 and $40 respectively for Burgerland.</br>  <br>  Crow <br>You mean Tsukikage?</br></br>  Reminder this will play at the last episode at the very last scene of Arc-V<br>https://<span>youtu.be/DRSxtqO9ajc  [ ]</br>  <br>I can see it now<br><br> HE HAS NO RELEVANCE WHY DID HE WIN <br> WHY IS HE EVEN A LANCER? <br> HE'S A FUCKING BODYGUARD NOT A FIGHTER <br> ninjas riding motorcycles <br> SHINJI WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT <br> WHO EVEN USES NINJAS ANYMORE? THAT WAS SO ZEXAL <br> I HOPE HE GETS CARDED </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean after Shinji beats Tsukikage and Crow and Shinji face off in round 2</br></br>  <br>I was talking about the stone. $10 bucks sound reasonable.</br>  <br> Implying it won't be Passionate Duelist Arc-V version because you know Yugi is going to be tied up in all this shit </br>  <br>Me, I misread and thought you were talking about if Tsukikage won</br>  <br><br> Enjoy is now a permanent member of the cast <br> yfw </br></br></br>  <br>Nah I prefer worst ED to be played instead</br>  <br>Nah he was just happy he lost to someone with purpose and someone with guts to make sacrifices (aka Crow losing LP on purpose) to make better gains.</br>  <br><br>On the other hand Yuya shouldn't have been able to use misdirection wing if Pendulum cards count as Spell and trap cards. <br><br>Speaking of misdirection wing I wonder when Yuya will use it again. It's one of his most powerful cards and Reiji needed serious bullshit to get past that</br></br></br></br>  Have me, Shun  YUZUUUU I AM COMING JUST FOR YOU  <br>I'd wait to see if it's a bust Secret. Although Kinka-Byo is fucking $7 and the Critias cards did get stupidly high.<br><br>I hate importing OCG singles because it's always scalped. I'd rather just buy boxes from AmiAmi if they had any. CORE sold like lightning compared to DOCS.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, but that ending is so bad</br>  <br><br>I love how there's people who act like Gon lost on purpose when he did nothing of the sorts while the entire episode revolved around how Crow wasn't even paying attention to the duel implying he would have had a much easier time winning had he played serious from the start. (Shinji points out that Crow made a rushed start, implying his opening move wasn't his usual playstyle, Crow kept looking at the audience every 5 seconds and he even points out himself how he should have put his monsters in defense position)<br><br>Gon had absolutely no way of winning this duel at all.</br></br></br></br>  Ending of Arc-V will involve  Yuzu dumping Yuya's ass for irrelevant Masumi   I thought Gon vs Crow was gonna be a two parter.<br>Looks like we'll get Shota NTR instead</br>  <br><br>Was it confirmed that it's bracket system? Or are pairs randomly determined after evety round?</br></br>  <br>INSIDE YUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>It's probably random pairs, look at the reactions of Yuya, Yuzu and Dennis, no one knows who is vsing who.</br>  <br>Shut up Masumifag, go back to Tumblr writing shipping fanfics.</br>  <br>Considering what Dennis said about all technological forms of communication being scrambled across dimensions, do you think Best Dad and company are watching the Friendship Cup from Standard with Mieru's Crystal Apple Uranai Baba-style?</br>  <br>But we get unrestricted RotA in place, which helps more decks out.</br>  What happened to mono?  <br>mono is kill</br>  <br>Too busy playing fighting games and getting aids to sub children's card games.</br>  <br><br>YGO EP066 Status: <br>Script/Timing - In Progress<br>QC - <br>Uploading -<br>(65 is on the backburner to be finished after 66)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will never be ready for this episode, holy shit.  <br>Protip: It never gets better.</br>  <br/>  <br>No, definitely. The remaining five episodes are all very good, but 59 is the high point of 5D's, for sure.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the quality of the series.  ;_; </br>  <br> Something in heaven was killed. <br><br>Jesus christ who the fuck named these decks? It's as fucked up as crazy Aki's deck names.</br></br></br>  <br>Well on the other hand consider Lucciano's decks. I tend to think he and Sora could have been great friends.</br>  So I believe long ago I told this thread that Majespecters would be the next level degenerate scum. Look how they turned out.  <br> I played my first Majespector opponent during the day the update was launch and I was sincerely surprised at how utterly ass devastated the guy I dueled was when I beat them with my Jack Atlas deck<br><br>I've never built a deck before and to see it do so well is rather uplifting</br></br></br>  <br>My  dick! </br>   Still no Abyss, Belial or King Calamity on devpro <br>I can't kingu to this</br>  So /a/, what old card would you like to see new support. I vote for my nigga here  <br>Lmao isn't devpro supposed to be faster at updating than percy?</br>  God, I just want to see Yuya and Yugo duel each other already. Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon vs Clear Wing Synchro Dragon is just too hype.  <br>I just want them to go D R A G O N S on each other</br>  <br>Seiyaryu. My cardfu back in the day.</br>  <br>I want to see new Magnet Warrior support</br>  <br>Thunder Dragon</br>  <br>You could always play...ARG format pff. <br> people were actually ok with losing 3 bubbleman to get fucking stratos. </br></br>  Anyways as badass as Gon's new synchro looks I hope it does more than get HUGE though maybe his deck will become more pendulum focused since that was a pretty high power combo for anime. 5k!!!!!  <br> Lmao <br><br> ... <br> pff. </br></br></br></br>  Shun is shorter than Reiji, what a manlet.  <br>I actually want Tsukikage to win now.</br>  <br>How tall is Reiji, exactly?</br>  <br>pshh...nothin personnel...kid</br>  <br>He's not winning. Did you forget the scene in the OP? It's the only one bar Reji confronting Leo and Yugo vs Yuya that hasn't happened yet.</br>  <br>It's happened. Tsukikage was protecting Reira from Security.</br>  <br>If the scenes in the OP are anything to go by, Yuya, Yugo, Yuzu, and Crow will advance, while Gongenzaka, Serena, Tsukikage and Sawatari will drop out.</br>  <br>Not stated, I'd say 1.78 at most.<br>Have a Marco sensei.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for my LDS rocket.</br>  <br>Waiting forever.</br>  <br>Can he ever catch a break from his winning streak?</br>  <br> Serena will lose </br>  <br>you know mad chimera did shoot a rocket at Blaze falcon in sora vs shun 1</br>  Why can't you be more like /dng/, /a/?  <br><br><br>How about you fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Tag Force 4 was a special game.</br>  <br>EGAO World hatsudo</br>  <br>She'll have to lose eventually if we make it to the end of the tournament. The only question is who defeats her. I'd like to see her duel Yuzu, but Bennis will probably take her out.</br>  <br>Is it bad to get an erection from the names of decks?</br>  <br>nigga those Aki deck's names IIRC</br>  <br>Explains why I have a throbbing erection, then.</br>  <br>You're likely right. Fusion nuts seem to be into keeping a clean win record and always going back to defeat who beat them before. Hmm, I kinda want this because they could show us what card Dennis planed on using on her before he noticed the obelisk force.</br>  Tell me /a/ what cards do you want to see cameo's of? Mine would be pic related.  <br>Fucking hate that fucking card.</br>  why did they choose to put the worst elements of 5d's into arc-v?    I can't for them to leave Synchro Dimension and we never see Crow again until he lays the finishing blow upon the final boss because Konami thinks everyone loves Crow.  Not enough fanservice.   return 1 BW <br> increase ATK until next draw <br>holy shit this card so good</br></br>  <br>You cannot attack though, so meh?</br>  <br> still no shirtless Yuuya </br>    <br> le Gale recycler <br>Its difficult to actually lv3 Synchro in Blackwings though.</br></br>  <br>Have meido Yuya.</br>  <br>Acceptable replacement</br>  <br>Oh right cannot attack, only good for first turn then</br>  <br> Look at thumbnail <br> "Why are her legs so short?" <br> That was from her knees down, didn't realize the middle area was her thighs and butt </br></br></br>  <br>There is also the bride Yuya.</br>  <br>So Shun would be about Yusei's height of 1.75?<br> tfw 1.76 <br>I-I'm 1.78 in shoes, so maybe I can wear a scarf and go full Reiji</br></br></br>  So does this mean Monosubs won't ever release 65 or what  <br>66 is taking priority. He'll probably release both around the same time.</br>  tfw it actually 3 different lv 3 BW synchro  <br> One can become a tuner <br> one can recover cards from graveyard <br> one minuses to deal 300 damage <br>One of these doesn't belong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>300 damage anon. That 3/40 of their life points!</br>  <br><br>All three can become tuners I believe. We don't know what the secondary eff of the third one is</br></br>  <br>How about now?</br>  <br> Just topdecking a free Neo Tachyon, Dark Knight, or Giant Red Hand <br>Man thank god for that you have to draw it part or this card would be fucking retarded</br></br>  <br>This picture is a best picture.</br>  <br>Yuya would be wearing a EGAO in these situations. You can see all their personalities in their faces. So why is Yuya Y[uke]ya?</br>  <br>I've heard something about it having new support in one of the new Legendary Yugi's Decks that will come out soon.</br>   Ultra and Secret <br>Jesus, what are you doing KoA?</br>  <br>Are you surprised?</br>  <br>Why are you still playing TCG? You almost deserve to pay those unholy price tags for pieces of cardboard.</br>  <br>So in other words the duel was scripted. Real nice deduction. Even though Crow was distracted they gave Gon garbage for a hand, Crow two set up turns and a really weak Synchro that was deliberately shit as possible so Crow wins. So no shit Crow won, what a skilled duelist.</br>  <br>It'll be like $8 at best if people actually decide to play the deck, which they won't.<br><br>The set already has enough holos that people don't want to pull.</br></br></br>  <br> The set already has enough holos that people don't want to pull. <br> posts the dracoknight synchro <br>Have you not looked at Majespecter Dracoknights or what.</br></br></br>  <br>Not much but Luster P seems like the more useful card, and Ignister will probably just go up in price closer to the TCG release of DOCS.<br><br>Probably should have posted Tell or something, but I just remember literally every OCG CORE box opening I saw getting one or two of Ignister.</br></br></br>  <br>This only really happened with Crow vs Gon and Sora vs Shun. Both weren't exactly unexpected reactions considering Sorafags and Crow haters.<br>That's two duels.</br></br>  <br><br>Except Gon's hand wasn't really weak. Infact his hand was better than most of his duels.<br><br>If he had summoned any of his other Synchro monsters he still would've lost</br></br></br></br>  Anyone got a Red Demon's deck?  <br>But Crow could have found an Action Card that inflicted 4000 damage to Gon. Gon had no chance of winning.</br>  I wonder what archetypes the Tops duelists are going to run.<br><br>They'd have to be overpowered anime-only archetypes to make Crow not look like a faggot for whining about Tops while playing fucking BLACKWINGS.</br></br>  <br>Nobody actually buys cards anymore, they just use DN or Pro. At least anybody intelligent.</br>  <br>Who is he getting married to?</br>  <br>Someone crude and strong.</br>  <br>It really was, wasted two cards on Magnets, then the crappy shitty Pendulums reduced it further then no Souls either though they're a fairly large part of Gon's deck. Then the Synchro which had a restriction just so Gon couldn't take advantage of the misplay. I would have laughed hard if Soul buster Gauntlet showed up. Or any Soul really.</br>  <br>Crow?</br>  <br>Literally the only card in Gon's entire deck that would have saved him was the Glove</br>  <br>Shingo is the DSP of cardgames, except Shingo is funny.</br>  <br>That's probably why he decided to use Flutist as a random LV3 instead of the better Glove. Also not giving Flutist it's proper effect so it was straight up bad. What I'm saying is that a random Kabuto play would be better since that only wastes one card. But it was blatantly scripted like it was said before so Gon would have lost anyway.</br>  <br>Sawatari isn't running around like this constantly.<br><br> WHY WONT MY TRAP PLAY, I ACTIVATED CALL OF THE HAUNTED, BUT I HAVE NO MONSTERS IN THE GRAVEYARD, WHY CANT I TAKE IT FROM YOURS, THIS IS STUPID <br> Draw Phase: WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE, I DONT GET IT, THIS GAME ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH <br><br>etc. you get the point, Sawatari is dumb, but he's not that dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My deck maybe Xyz, but she is my ace.</br>    <br>I wouldn't call Sawatari dumb, he's just overconfident.</br>  <br>Yes, but he does blame Yuya for his own stupidity.</br>  <br>Nekroz.</br>  <br>I like how everyone ignores that Gon's cards were scripted so badly. Usually when someone makes a misplay they get punished for it but nah Gon can't do anything because his Synchro has a specific restriction. Then there's the Pendulums with insulting effects. Then there's blatant Magnet garbage which is obvious Raikiri bait. Then there's Gon not taking the first turn because he botches bike riding even though Crow's apparently distracted and shouldn't have made it to the first corner first then.<br>As a Samurai player this episode was really disappointing.</br></br>  <br>He only blamed Yuya for things after their first duel. Since their 2nd, he thinks of Yuya as one of his 'Sawatari Generation' disciples in an affectionate way.</br>  <br>Well, he must've forgotten that when they entered the Synchro Dimension. Because, he is reason security learned about Action Duels, and Pendulum Summoning. If Crow hadn't came along, they would've been sent to the facility.</br>  <br>Look I agree that Gon deserved the win more but there's not much you can do about plot armor sadly. Gon's cards were deliberately terrible especially the Synchro but blame the duel writing for that not Crow.</br>    Don't worry guys we probably won't have to deal with Crow's shit after this arc right. Right guys. He's not going to become a permanent cast member is he?      <br>Not likely. If they're really going to bring someone from Synchro along (since they were looking for strong people to join them), maybe Shinji?</br>    <br>fuck you, its going to be ENJOY guy he's pretty cool.</br>  <br>Enjoy is gonna die man.</br>  <br>Why is this a thing? I didn't get the impression Yuri and Serena were close.</br>  <br>He's old and old guys rarely get to help save the world in shonen so it's sadly inevitable. He's much more likable than expected. Why can't we have him instead of the boring thing that is Crow? I mean when he gets carded I'm going to be sad, if Crow gets carded my reaction will be one of happiness.</br>  <br>We know next to diddly shit about Yuri at the moment, and the other three pairs are close, so there's going to be something involving them for sure. The question is is there already a bond there (that was suppressed somehow) or will it form after they meet?</br>  <br>Because BUY BLACKWINGS</br>  <br>I want to  hug  shota Yuri.</br>  <br>The flashback of him as a kid is going to break some hearts, I can tell. A kid becoming THAT fucked up in the future can't not be a sad story.</br>  <br>My guess is they were, or would've been close, but Leo showed up and kept Serena locked up in academia</br>  <br>it'll be badass if he takes on more than 2 assholes from the DA.</br>  <br>They showed a few episodes of Tokumatsu. He's already likable<br>They showed more of Crow and I still don't like him. I guess he's a good person for raising the kids but still he just isn't interesting and I don't care really.</br></br>  Anon-kun, are you ready for bed?  <br>Always.</br>  <br>Eh Sora vs Shun was a bigger outrage Probably because the show still had hype then. Crow winning caused anger but at least the thread was moving. Now it's near dead. Crow brutally murdered the hype. Though to be fair to him it was already massively declining.</br>    <br>It's good that the thread is slowing down, but it's far from dead. If you think this is dead, you should have seen earlier on in the show's run where we had threads lasting for upwards of two days.</br>  <br>WELL THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY</br>  <br>we already knew that Crow would win, even if we said Gon was going to deep down we all knew who'd win. the point reminds that Crow killed the fun anything crow touches with his manlet hands turns to shit.</br>  <br>Has anyone translated the names of Tag Force Special decks? The wiki doesn't have any</br>  <br>The english patch translates them if you want to try that.</br>  <br>Aporia's decks<br> The Current Despair <br> Just Despair <br> Inevitable Despair <br> The Hope Beyond Despair </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any interesting deck names?</br>  <br>Yeah this really. I had a tiny sliver of hope that Gon would win and something unpredictable would happen but no Crow won and it was just as meh as I thought it would be. It doesn't help that the new SHS Synchro that I was hyped for was really underpowered and blatantly designed so Crow would win.</br>  <br>It turns out Placido, like his namesake, is really into music<br> Wisel Overture <br> Wisel Prelude <br> Wisel Symphony <br> Wisel Armageddon <br><br> Wisel Concerto <br> Wisel Rhapsody <br> Wisel Divertimento <br> Wisel Requiem </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, not terribly funny but Meiru's is Happy Blue Unfortune<br> It's Necloths. </br></br>   yfw Ruri's eye color is   Galaxy   <br>Tried looking up the names in some Japanese wiki and I'm laughing at Sora's decks:<br> The Way I Use Scissors <br> Scissors Mischief <br> Scissors Mischief (the meaning is a bit meaner) <br> Seriousness of Scissors <br>I miss you so much, Sora...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i just hope Crow doesnt become part of the main cast we all know whos going to be replaced pic related and it hurts me so.<br><br>even she is disgusted.</br></br></br>  <br>Haha, Sora sure likes his Scissors. Any more, gems? What are Sawatari's decks called?</br>  I I had to come up with Tag Force style decknames, here's what I'd call Shun's<br> Falcon's Revenge <br> Falcon's Resistance <br> Falcon's Rebellion <br> Falcon's Revolution </br></br></br></br>  <br>Or<br><br> Must find Ruri <br> Found a Ruri, but not Ruri <br> Found a Second Ruri, still not Ruri <br> Ruri~ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I Am the Chosen One <br> Ice Emperor (Sawatari would fit SO well at Hyoutei) <br> Moebius Empire <br> Yosenju Phantom <br><br><br>His deck names are<br> Falcon Hunting <br> Eagle Hunting <br> Hawk Hunting </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are Yuya and Yuzu's decks called?</br>  <br>Glove only works on direct attacks so it wouldn't save him from that last attack, and frankly, someone having a shitty hand makes for a more realistic duel.<br><br>So many duels would have different results if the characters played their best pieces right away.</br></br></br>  <br>this is pretty much it for Shun.</br>  <br> Let's Have Fun Together Deck <br> Entertainment Deck, First Act <br> Entertainment Deck, Second Act <br> Entertainment Deck, Encore <br><br> Super Melodious Live <br> Melodious' Etude <br> Divine Melody Melodious Polyphony <br> Melodious Superb Song Symphony </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How the fuck is it not likely. What the fuck do you think all that Kizunaing with Yuya is for?</br></br>  <br>Thank you based anon.<br>One last request, what are Reiji and Gon's decks called?</br></br>  <br> shitty hand makes for a more realistic duel. <br>Proper duels don't have plot armor cards to save you.<br>But yes I forgot that Glove only works on direct attacks. Ah well, guess there's nothing else he could use instead other than good old Soulbang Cannon for a draw or give Flutist the proper effect since it's one of the key cards used in real life. Besides the new cards Gon used were awful beyond belief. It would have been better if he never used Pendulums because he might get two Samurais that aren't shit. Bad duel was bad.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh cry some more. Gon has never been much of a wombo combo king in the anime. <br>You can't even think of a strategy how Gon would have won with your would be hand</br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that the butthurt fags are not true Gonfags, just some Crowhaters who pretend to be Gonfags<br>If Gon lost to Dennis, no one would have given a shit<br>If Gon lost to Shun, no one would have given a shit<br>If Gon lost to fucking Tsukikage no one would have given a shit<br>But God forbid Crow defeats someone</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, I don't want Crow to win and I don't like Gon, Gons deck is cool at least though.</br>  <br>I'm not going to completely change his hand. Obviously he couldn't win with the cards he was given outside of Flutist's real effect. I'm faulting the writer for giving Gon trash cards in the first place. It's like  says. It's scripted. But his regular strategy of protecting a Samurai with Souls was gone. <br>But I'm done with this. Crow will lose eventually.</br></br>  <br><br>  It's scripted <br><br>Just stop. You just sound like an absolute retard who think that there are actual people playing card games in the anime. EVERY DUEL IS SCRIPTED</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem isn't that Gon lost or that Crow is a faggot, it's how Gon lost. Duels are scripted yes, but it felt like Gon's cards and the duel itself was tailored made to make him lose, which usually is not the case, most of the time even with Jack/Yuya there is a clear case of their hands and cards putting up a fight or leading to a good duel. <br><br>In Gon's case there was nothing he could have done regardless of any strategy, and that's what was bad about the duel. Yuya could have beat Jack if he hadn't over-extended and Fused/Xyz'd right off the bat, Gon did not have this, his hand was tailored made to lose.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the point retard discussing potential plays is pointless other than to waste time. I'm not mad that Gon lost. I'm mad that he lost in an unsatsifying way.</br>  <br><br>Gon didn't need to play his magnets first and could've just blocked the first attack with the card he used anyway and used his magnets for synchro summons<br>He could have used one magnet to summon flutist in the first turn and synchro summon right off the bat and play more agressively. <br><br>But Gon always stall for his first turn. That's what he's done in every duel so far so I find it pretty funny that people are getting mad at it just now just because he played against Crow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reiji's are just called<br> D <br> DD <br> DDD <br><br>Gon-chan<br> Steadfast Duel, Legion Volume <br> Steadfast Duel, Introductory Manual <br> Steadfast Duel, Practical Assessment Volume <br> Steadfast Duel, Advanced Volume <br>(not 100% sure about "Legion", but Google isn't giving me anything else and I can't figure out if it's a reference to something specific)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, Gon is a faggot that is gonna get himself and others carded because he refuses to do anything. <br><br>Hell he refused to fucking do anything against Jobelisk after seeing people get fucking carded, he just stalled and was like "Here Shun, you do it."</br></br></br>  <br>Not the anon you're replying to, but "all that Kizunaing"? Maybe it felt like there was a lot of Crow if you're watching weekly, but I recently caught up and binge watched the past ~20 episodes and it didn't seem like there was that much of focus on Crow.</br>  <br>Because other than Trumpeter which was just used as a Tuner with no effect and Flutist used as a random LV3 with no effect, everything else was new. So they gave Gon a bunch of really bad new cards tailor made so he could lose. That's probably where it's coming from. Though yes people hate Crow and it doesn't help the matter.</br>  <br><br>He used the magnets against Security. He did the exact same opening move. But nobody bitched there</br></br>  <br>Wait what. As soon as he saw "Yuzu" in danger he went to help. He gave Shun Pendulums because his deck is built for taking on multiple opponents at once. Easier than him playing something for sure. The writers are also massive Shunfags.</br>  <br><br>If Gon hadn't played anything people would cry how the writers make Gon play like a retard just to make Crow win<br>If Gon had Synchro summoned in the first turn and Crow blew up his monsters people would cry about how Gon should've saved it because it was obvious that it was gonna get blown up<br>If Gon uses a literally previously established opening move he used in duels before people are still gonna bitch BECAUSE FUCK CROW FUCK LOGIC REEEEE</br></br></br></br>  <br>And he'd lost there too and I'd have bitched, but big poppa Shun came to save the day.</br>  <br>The Magnets were ok. Even if they were only Raikiri bait and just put Gon down two cards. Everything else on the other hand especially the Synchro is trash.</br>  <br>This thread is filled with dishonor</br>  <br><br>That's even the worst thing. Gon didn't do anything at all. He was just there to get BTFO, demonstrate the Goyo effs and have Shun save his ass without putting up a fight or retaliating himself. It was just unnecessary and the sole purpose of this was to wank Shun's cock some more</br></br>  Crow a shit, Gon a shit. They should've drawn and both got sent off.  <br>what does happen if a draw occurres? Do they restart the duel with like 1000lp?</br>  <br>They probably just draw, and someone gets a free bye, or yeah, they'd just restart the duel.</br>  <br>Nobody other than Shun did anything there. It was plain Shun wanking.</br>  <br>Mitchio and Tepei sort of did something. Sawatari just got fucked from the start like all of his duels pretty much.<br><br>Serena is the only one with a real excuse though since their decks were tailored made to counter hers, just like Shun's is tailored made to counter any special summons.</br></br></br>  <br>So why don't people hate Shun again? He receives more favorism than Crow ever did. Is it muh Ruri?</br>  <br>I think because Shun is more of a joke half the time with his Ruri.wav. That and people actually tend to like his duels, Sora/Shun was one of the best duels YGO has had. <br><br>They do get pissy at him though too. I've seen quite a few people call him Crow 2.0 and BUY RAIDRAPTORS.</br></br></br>  <br>People started getting annoyed with him with the Shun vs Dennis match where he had a 3000 LP handicap just to shill him. then in the Secruity match where the preview talked about his overwhelming strength and nobody did much except provide fodders for him.<br>If the Shunfaggotry continues then more people are either going to like it because Shun is so cool or start disliking Shun.</br></br>  <br>MFW I dueled my brother.</br>  Holy shit are you faggots still bitching about Gon losing? Everyone not named Yuya is gonna fucking lose.  <br>And Shun, and Serena, and Reiji, and Reira, and  Jack </br>  <br>Who are those people above Futoshi and Yuya?</br>  Is Jack the Synchro Shun?  <br>Above futsoshi looks like Idol-chan</br>  <br>Shun is the Xyz Jack, and Reiji is the Standard Jack, now we just need Fusion Jack.</br>  So I decided to watch 5Ds and cant inderstand why you fags hate everything after episode 64, I mean they have a fucking riding duel IN SPACE and the loser gets killed by a black hole. What the fuck  <br>Because some plot points were dropped after the sex cult thing, and some characters were shoved to the side for no reason or just completely shit on, like Sherry.</br>  <br>If this is true, then that would make Rin Jack's sister.</br>  <br>Jack is a traitor for a reason, he left his poor little sister behind in the commons, but Yugo doesn't understand and just sees him as the cool older brother that became Kingu.</br>  <br>I didn't mind it except for the stupid amount of filler and how Z-ONE was actually a Yusei cosplayer.</br>  <br> Fusion Jack <br>That sounds like a Trap Card.</br></br>  <br>Does it now? I don't have King in my name for nothing.</br>  <br>Shun will be protected because the writers suck him off hard. The tourney will be interrupted before he loses.<br>Serena is going to get captured and become irrelevant so who cares if she loses or wins.<br>Reira may have infant immortality.<br>Reiji probably won't even duel this arc until the end and won't lose until he faces his father.<br>Jack will probably job to Synchro using Yuya.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Serena is going to get captured and become irrelevant so who cares if she loses or wins. <br><br>I care.</br></br></br>  <br> Serena is going to get captured and become irrelevant so who cares if she loses or wins. <br>It's sad because it's true.</br></br>  <br> he left his poor little sister behind in the commons <br><br>Disgusting. Jack deserves to get carded for abandoning his imouto.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Don't worry Snack Butler to the rescue.</br></br></br>  <br>It's sad all Ruris will get to be damsels in distress eventually.</br>  In a couple of hours. <br>And then another long 7-day wait.<br>Will this suffering ever end?</br></br>   Will this suffering ever end? <br>No ones forcing you to watch this pile of shit.</br>  <br>  no robot angels were harmed in the making of this episode. <br>Blatant lies.</br></br>  <br> Will the butthurt ever end? <br>The post.</br></br>  <br>Time to get sp00ky</br>  Overlord has the best opening this season. Prove me wrong.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jMo<wbr>VmSV4yA8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>best ed too</br>  <br>I just caught up with the anime after getting some time, but compared to the LNs it's quite lacking.<br><br>Those certain scenes were great though, but as far as an actual anime goes it's at least as bad as Mahouka and Vanadis was, actually probably worse.<br><br>Is it weird of me to think that to properly get everything right they would need to like, slow the pace down even more? As it is they are cutting away dialogue or exposition at every turn just to make it in time but I also understand that lots and lots of talking would bore casuals even if they come complete with diagrams or flash backs during monologues and what not. Ah fuck it there's no point wondering about what could have been when this is clearly a cheap commercial where the budget is focused on certain scenes and being an outlet for So-Based to draw some more shit. Guess I'm happy with that.<br><br>Wonder how BDs will work though, it doesn't seem like they are censoring much, what would it even offer to make people buy it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Auto-tune, so by default, it's garbage</br>  <br>I haven't watched much this season, but I remember when the first PV trailer came out I thought it was absolute shit due to how it was horribly out of place with the animation and the song started without the proper build up.<br><br>It's great in the OP though.</br></br></br>  <br>The LN's have way too much text talking about ''this skill and that skill and that item'' but ultimately its useless since Momonga is the only one who is aware of it.</br>  <br>Welcome to LN adaptations, they can't just put all the monologuing in or it'd take up an entire episode.</br>  <br> Getting to about a 700000 views in about 3 weeks. <br>How?</br></br>  <br>people like a good power fantasy see<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Bd<wbr>b1V0Io_g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Yeesh, and that's just the preview?</br>  <br>I hope the opening is gonna be dope too</br>  Is it time for<br><br> KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEEEEEEEEE? </br></br>  <br>SAGASHITEEEEEEEE</br>  <br>Why is it useless? There's tons of context to it that change how you would interpret the scene itself. This is proven by how many shitters there are in these threads since the anime started asking for explanations.<br><br><br>Yes I know this isn't my first LN, however I can safely say that compared to other adaptations Overlord seems the least capable of being self contained when cutting away content. I think the best examples of this are SAO and Raildex, where even though I know there's a shit ton of things I missed out since I've read the LNs first, it's not all that awkward for whatever reasons.<br><br>Might just be how Overlord was written I dunno. Not saying it's bad, just saying as a stand alone anime instead of being a highlight reel it's awfully jarring. I'd be completely lost if I didn't read the LN and get misconceptions everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it actually looks creepy</br></br>  <br>With my soul</br>  <br> reads shitty shounen lns <br> complains about adaptations <br>nigga</br></br></br>  <br> Why is it useless? There's tons of context to it that change how you would interpret the scene itself. <br><br>Nah from what I read its mostly useless shit noone cares about. (muh skills muh stats).<br><br> This is proven by how many shitters there are in these threads since the anime started asking for explanations. <br><br>They ask about things not yet explained, understandable since its still early. <br><br><br>All in all I believe the anime is really good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't feel like that at all when I watched, neither did my friends who had never even heard of Overlord.</br>  <br> I'd be completely lost if I didn't read the LN and get misconceptions everywhere. <br><br>literally everything is explained<br><br>what the hell is your problem?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I pointed out adaptations that I thought were self contained, and coincidentally, they were the ones that sold very well. Probably because being self contained allows an adaptation to reach a new audience. I mean your very picture is an example of that which I missed.<br><br><br>We'll just have to agree to disagree then, cause if I'm going to be honest I flat out disagree with your post but I'm not gonna bother going back through vol 1 line by line for this. Feel free to BTFO of me though if you are inclined to start quoting lines for each scene though.<br><br><br>I don't see how that's possible when you cut half the text in quotation marks out, not even counting the text not in quotations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were you raped by a skeleton when you were young?</br>  <br> I don't see how that's possible when you cut half the text in quotation marks out, not even counting the text not in quotations. <br><br>because anime is about pictures, not text</br></br></br>  <br>I did wear a skeleton costume when I was a little kid.</br>  while re-reading vol 1 of the LN I noticed that Ainz defined a minor potion as an item that "only" restores 50 HP... but that cannot be as his total HP is 60 and even his strongest level 100 physical class servants cap at 100 HP. so what am iI missing? did the author retconned his shit?  <br>You do know I was referring to dialogue right? The characters talk when that happens.</br>  <br>The 60 is not 60 hp. It's more like 60% of the normal soft-cap so to speak.</br>  <br>ah ok thanks, that makes sense</br>  <br> kid inside skeleton as opposed to skeleton inside kid <br>Beat them at their own game, eh? That's sheer genius.</br></br>  <br>Yeah we don't know exact numbers anon, nor how the stat chart really works. But you can see how fucked up Ainz's mana bar is when it literally goes off the section.</br>  <br>Is Overlord any good?</br>  <br>What happens if the skeleton inside your body tries to kill you?</br>  <br>I think it's called 'bone cancer'.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  <br>there's something else that baffles me: I used to think that the battle maids were the strongest NPC group after the guardians, Sebas and Pandora's actor but then in volume 4 we learn of the existence of cocytus' level 100 servants who are supposedly stronger. so how many damn level 100 NPC are in Nazarick? also, as we know that Ainz can conjure level 80+ monsters, is it safe to say that battle maids are useless power wise?</br>  <br>AOTD</br>  <br>Too spooky for me.</br>  <br>I don't know where you get level 100 from, cause I've never read anywhere that Nazarick has level 100 nameless npcs other than possibly the Avatara.<br><br>However, there are plenty of level 90 npcs, like the dragons Aura and Mare ride. Demiurge's 7th floor supposedly has a level 90 that is stronger than the weaker floor guardians giving you a glimpse of how RP-mode Nazarick actually is when it doesn't involve the 8th floor.<br><br>If you read the first vol you should know that the battle maids are merely there to stall time on the 9th floor along with Sebas while the players of AOG revive at the 10th floor in order to make their last stand in a Final Boss fashion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Choose your destiny.    <br><br>Whoa, that's too spooky anon.</br></br>  What qualifies as a non human?

It's not will continue?  Kadokawa owns the IP. They give the green light to a new season. KyoAni draws the animu that you know and love. Kadokawa gets money from LN sales (boosted by anime) and merchandising (they own those guys), KyoAni gets BD sales. Thing is that the LN already does really well, so there's no point in an anime induced booster shot. Plus, Tanigawa, the writer, is already rolling in cash and is currently on an extended hiatus. A great schism, one that didn't show signs of closing until KyoAni adapted Kadokawa's Amagi, appeared and we saw KyoAni getting into publishing themselves with Tamako, Free!, Kyoukai no Kanata, and Chuuni, trying to find their own Haruhi that they can tap into any time they want.<br>Shit's political, yo.</br>  <br>You're wrong.</br>  <br>Kadokawa is run by faggots</br>  Its dead.
