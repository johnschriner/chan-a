[ 夜空に浮かぶ星達は一人ぼっちの寂しさと巡り合う喜びを繰り返して長い時の<wbr>中をすれ違っていきます 今日の予報は流星雨。星空を見上げていると、今はまだ出会えていないどこか<wbr>のだれかの事をふと思ってしまいます その誰かも同じようにこの星空を見上げていて星達は空からそんな私達の姿を<wbr>見守っていてくれるはずです  "The stars flying in the broad night skies are crossing paths within the long passage of time after feeling lonely and joy again and again. Today's prediction is meteor shower. If you look up to the skies, you will remember of someone from somewhere you haven't yet meet. That person shall also look up into the starry skies, and the stars will watch over us from the cosmos."  Gainax, you sucked most of the time. But this show is a great parting present. See you again someday.      </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>    shitty city   stars      Yeah I know, I guess after that kiss I wanted something romantic in the epilogue.     Just because you can't see them, doesn't mean they are not there.     It's dealing with personal time, not universe time.   I like how Itsuki got stuck in a shock pose for a few minutes after the kissu. This show was amazing.   Does this look like the face of mercy?   Nice.    Kaori?    wait what    Just disgusting   So this show is like K-on except with sluts? Is that correct?    Zero to 'I want your dick' in three episodes.   Tsundere.      onomatopoeia in an animation    I thought only Jojo did that.      Lot's of anime has it but only SHAFT would give it it's own shadow.     his only "special ability" is being good at lying and manipulating people   How does he manages to keep his job?  Answered your own question there, champ. Plus, Ganbaru has usage for a liar.   Meme isn't really all that powerful. He just happens to be on a similar level to Ganbaru in terms of awareness and understanding. He's not really AS capable as she is, but he's really close in terms of how he perceives shit.  Do people seriously dislike Hanekawa? Are these Sengoku fans? Only reason I can see this being a thing         Best Girl   There are lots of anons who call her boring because some of her conversations in Bake and Nise are kind of boring.   Kagerou class best class    boats     If the anime was airing that would be true but we're back to average 50 posters from last year.    Same as and     And you think most of those bother playing RNG browser garbage in moon language? This is not /jp/.    You must be new to kancolle threads.   I miss Eruerufu   Don't we all.   I miss Shokoshoko.  guys I just reached this part in tsukihime and is this a Gunbuster reference?  It's obviously a Gurren Lagann reference  Why would Arc folding her arms below her breasts have anything to do with Gunbuster?   folding your arms is a Gunbuster reference  Amazing.     Gunbuster invented folding your arms.    How is there no smug thread? Did you all get tired of the permaboner Shinoa gives you? I know i nearly wore my dick out beating off to that smug smile.  Kingu soon    Have you forgotten that a lot of the current shenanigans in Synchro have been done before with Yusei and co?  Not really, it was mostly just Yusei when 5D's was doing it. The basic format might be similar, but with a pretty big difference in how things actually play out and who's involved with what since the cast is much bigger.  And whatever the point of Friendship Cup is going to be, it's not going to be the same as Fortune Cup since Reiji already did the job of bringing the Lancers together.        I don't see why Arc-V and 5D's shouldn't be directly connected. GX and DM were direct sequels, while 5D's was in a somewhat vague defined future of the two. ZeXal was the odd one out with absolutely no connections to past series at all because BUY XYZ and Arc-V appears to try to fix the fuck up that is ZeXal by explaining how it's existence is agreeable with the rest of the series.  Also a thing I've noticed from the very start is that in Arc-V they use the same duel discs that Yliaster uses and who knows what's up with that         I knew he was going to be in the series ahead of time and it didn't alleviate any of the annoyance I experienced. I had hopes that he would be a side character that appears from time to time up until Dark Signer kicked those hopes around the block.   You have a point. I guess I can only hope we get Rua and Ruka and some Aki shenanigans. Otherwise, Konami has already failed me this arc.      Maybe standard is the original universe all the other Yugiveses broke off from by some unseen force.    It's the one where Jack tries to get a job I think   Come on lets have a thread dedicated to this, I'll eliminate the easy ones by posting screenshots from One Piece   Oh, sorry    like i already said, its probably because of perspective. i know you cant read, but that doesnt mean you need to act like such a dipshit :)      :)    mypainisgreaterthanyours.jpg     threesome date starts with 8man and Yukino staring into each other's eyes again, later 8man ditches Yui to go talk to Yukino   Yui gives 8man her chocolates and Yukino didn't. 8man stops her from giving up on the 8bowl   friendship end flags raised by threesome date and 8man's refusal to show romantic feelings for anyone     8man flirts with Iroha after mixing saliva   So basically flags were raised for every single ending. To top it all off he ended the volume on a cliffhanger instead of wrapping things up like he usually does. Why does Watari do this to us? Does he want us to suffer? Is this how he makes money, through our tears?          Yo nigga, I don't even like Yui but that Yuimama is fucking smokin'    I think the animator want makes Yui as tragic as possible and cut anything that makes her chance for win really hopeless so Anime only viewer really FEEL sympathy about her situation. They do that to saving screentime to be able animate every important scene and still manage convey the feel from these scene. Not only that they do give justice to Yukino as main heroine in anime compared what Watari in LN.  Believe me. If they show 8man's real reaction and his monologue about Yui from LN in anime. It's hard to imagining how Yukino end unfold because Author pretty much shat on Yukino as damsel distress in recent novel when she still lacking romance progression at same time.      Real talk  Now that the girls are going to be genuine about their feelings who will this work out. They have to see each other in club all the time, how is it going to work without imploding and hurt feelings? How is 8man going to deal with the fact that real life girls are in love with him and are open about their affection? Does he "Eh!! Nandatte!?" out of there?      Yui-mom has pinkish-orange hair also   Confirmed not dyed.     I've gone through some shit. I need a pick-me-up.  What's your antidepressant, /a/? I don't care if it's niche or mainstream, moeshit or something deep, waifu pandering or bromance, strings of dumb puns or clever comedy, what's the show(s) you keep going back to when you need to feel good?     Does Lum count as yandere?  Also why doesn't Ataru just politely ask her to stop electrocuting him when she "displays her love"?     That ending was pretty cute but when put side by side with Urusei Yatsura's first opening, I can't help but get irritated by how little movement there is in it.   Why are Urusei Yatsura OPs and EDs so based?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5<wbr>gi9PH7j0</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ifn<wbr>oD0tCzD8</wbr>  [ ]     Still the best girl.    They were up until "rock the planet!"     On the subject of Lum's cooking, she doesn't really seem to understand that not everybody has the palate for spicy foods. That and Ataru is a dick about it which just encourages her to make more.   Fucking fight me.      What's the first thing that comes through your mind?     Cute little girls.    the loli thread is here     Thanks!  But I already had that thread open.      why does she have a poop on the pillow next to her   OMG dudes have you seen the newest episode of Gurren Lagann? Kamina is so EPIC and GAR!!  The archive is down so I can't go grab pics from there and change the filename so it looks like I've been here since 2004 this time. You win this time, true oldfags. I'll be back next thread though.   NOW I'VE LOST IT  Guys, I think there's something wrong with Mecahazawa but I can't put my finger on it.   You guys don't actually do this, do you?    You do what now?   ITT we post a character without actually posting them.  I'll start with something easy.     Ranma?    You're waifu.    It still hurts     Shiro    </blockquote>]
