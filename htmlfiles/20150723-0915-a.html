[ this show is boring as fuck. already on episode 18, the pacing is fucking horrendous, don't care about any of the characters, a lot of what's happening is really boring, does this get any better?  Gurren Lagann, not so good.  I liked how he kept telling that slut to fuck off. <br><br>I forgot what episode i was on though.</br></br>  <br>it's a shit show, death note is much better</br>  Might not be for you, then<br>Maybe you'd like K-On or something</br>  <br>The manga is much better than the anime, you should probably have read that instead.<br><br>But really you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  Weren't they making an HBO show of this?  <br>If so Dr.Tenma will fuck every person he saves while searching for Johann.</br>  <br>explain to me what's so good about this show. The melodrama is cringeworthy as fuck though that should be expected with all weaboo trash, the plot is fucking contrived as fuck, why is tenma the only doctor that can perform surgery without killing anyone, how did a fucking 10 year old poison 3 adults with candy. this show is fucking laughable i have much better taste than you</br>  <br>Congratulations, you have shit taste. Watch Aldnoah Zero or Samurai Flamenco instead.</br>  <br> how did a fucking 10 year old poison 3 adults with candy <br>Johann was awake at this point I'm pretty sure, so he could have just poisoned it and then offered it to them.</br></br>  <br><br> Del Toro as director <br><br>I have faith</br></br></br></br>  <br> monster as source material <br>now it's gone</br></br>  <br>I bet 5 autism bucks that Dr.Tenma will not look like a hobo like in OP's pic but will just get generic action hero scruff.</br>  <br>nah it's fucking garbage. try bebop or miyazaki for some quality anime</br>  <br> the guy who made one good movie in his life <br>I don't</br></br>  It doesn't get much better if it bores you at this point. Dropped it at episode 20 or so and read the manga instead. The pacing was better but the Story in general wasn't really captivating, would take 20th century boys over monster any day of the week.  <br>The pacing just gets worse from here. It's shit. I don't understand its popularity.<br>Even past the fact that it is boring because of how slow it is, the scenario isn't all that great, nor the ost, nor the designs, nor the characters.<br>20th century boy and pluto are better choices.</br></br></br>  <br> comparing SamFlam to Aldnoah zero </br>  <br>I quite like the ost i'll give them that, nothing else hooks me in</br>  <br>you're a fucking pleb, anime's not for you</br>  <br>Try Sword Art Online out OP I think it'd suit you better</br>  <br>No it really doesn't. I tried my best to watch it, hoping there was exceptional twist hidden at the end or something to justify everyone's dickriding, and ended up dropping it around ep 37 where the MC does the most retarded thing imaginable.<br><br>I somehow picked it up months later and watched it to the end - suprise suprise, nothing. It's utter garbage meant for new-age edginess and quasi-philosophical quasi-intellectual teenagers. That, or it's the longest running 2deep4you joke in anime.<br><br>Here's to the 24 hours of my life I'm never getting back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Johan has a cynical yet very accurate understanding of a person's nature, so he assumed the Director would steal something from him while he lay comatose (just to satisfy his egomania) and guessed it would eb the candy. After discerning that it is just a matter of putting some medical material on it in a large enough quantity to kill a grown man. I believe it was muscle relaxer or something, he uses it multiple times in the series.</br>  Naoki Urasawa's characters are all nonsensical and illogical. You have to suspend disbelief because if you try to make sense of it you'll find too many holes.  <br><br>The manga is garbage, never watched the anime.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, good idea. General public definitely won't think of it as Hannibal rip-off.<br> Del Toro <br>Fuck that hack, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>hannibal's much better than monster and even that isn't great</br>  <br>Most 'bad' western TV shows would be AOTS anime. That Dexter season with the Trinity Killer would probably be dickrode for life as the best anime ever made.</br>  I like the source material but the direction of the adaptation is horrid. <br>Everything is so drawn out it's unbelievable.</br>  <br> I'd rather have Dexter season 7 anime without Isaak dying so anticlimactically. </br>  <br>I don't think even got past episode 5 of Monster, I was expecting a cool premise and amazing characters and I got some boring fucking drama, you could find a better plot in soap opera.<br><br> Docutah Tenma you must make this hard choice between the Mayor and this child. Btw, you're the only half decent doctor in this hospital choose wisely because there's no other fucking doctors here. </br></br></br>  <br> isn't great <br>That's understatement of the century. Hannibal is fucking garbage.<br>I'd say it's one of the worst shows I've ever seen.</br></br></br>  <br>I gave up at the start of Season 5 where he kills a man for no reason and that was never explained nor did he feel guilty. I did see the ending of season 7 where he drives into a Tornado and becomes a lumberjack?</br>  <br> lumberjack <br>That's 8 not 7.<br>7 was generally shit just like 8, but it had one of the hypest antagonists on the show ever second only to Trinity and maybe Doakes.<br><br>Too bad he was killed of because the actor had to play in some mediocre capeshit instead and scheduling conflicts ensued.<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TLQH<wbr>u7PiymE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hannibal at the start was fairly decent even if MC had magic autistic detective powers. It only got retarded when Hannibal tries to frame him and he get's put in that mental hospital.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone really beats Doakes, he got so close the writers writ themselves into a corner and had to kill him off. It was so bullshit how they made that chick kill him by blowing up that shed instead of Dexter because he's a good serial killer who dindu nuffin.</br>  <br> Hannibal at the start was fairly decent <br>No, it wasn't. It was bland CSI-like garbage with retarded-looking "artsy" murders which were retarded from the fucking start.<br>Oh, and characters repeating words signifying plot points as unsubtly as possible is really goddamn dumb.<br>If I'll hear that Dutch faggot saying the word "friend' in his shit accent I'll bleed from my ears.<br><br>Hannibal is fucking shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the 'artsy' murders, no matter how retarded, were pretty fun. It wasn't a 100% realistic show anyway so having weird,impossible murders was a breath of fresh air from normal CSI shit. It's only when the plot started to take them seriously and when you got episodes like that furry suit one that it became shit. <br><br>But,I'm not a massive TV buff and I watch what's entertaining until I get bored so I suppose it's objectively shit but still enjoyable if you turn your brain off.</br></br></br>  <br> furry suit <br>Literally the only two good episodes in the entire show as long as you treat them as something that belongs in a slasher flick than in a cop drama.<br>Yes, it's stupid from real-life standpoint but this was pretty fucking tense which is not something you can say about actual horror movies nowadays.<br>The rest of the murders are just boring edgy shit with no substance other than trying to be outlandish as possible..</br></br></br></br>  I stopped around episode ~30 a while ago. I dunno, I liked it, but it bored me at the same time.<br><br>Also, why is this the only anime without rule 34, but with fucking huge noses instead? Is the size of the nose reverse-proportional to how sexy the character is to japanese folk?</br></br>  <br>It's one of those manga/anime that are average with a not so common plot but probably for their uniqueness get a really loud fan base, the which overrates the hell out of it and in the end make it worse for the viewer. Just look in this same thread the retards with clever counter arguments:<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck off to /tv/ faggots  <br>You might enjoy Attack on Titan</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qhP<wbr>Gbr51jfc</wbr>  [ ]<br>And slowly, you come to realize<br>It's all as it should be<br>Your taste only can be shit so much<br><br>If you're game enough<br>You could place your trust in me<br><br>For the love of life<br>There's a trade off<br>We could lose it all<br>But we'll go down fighting<br><br>And what of the children?<br>Surely they can't be blamed for our mistakes?<br><br>And slowly I've come to realize<br>It's all as it should be<br><br>That hiding space<br>A lonely place<br><br>How can the right thing be so wrong?<br>I've found mistakes<br>Where they don't belong<br><br>For the love of life<br>We'll defeat this<br>They may tear us down<br>But we'll go down fighting<br><br>Won't we?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then how the fuck did he organiz that butchery between the orphans and the directors in kinderheim 511 ?</br>  can someone wrap up the ending so I don't have to sit through this shit?  serial experiments lain? More like serial experiments LAME shitsux  <br> Monster Thread <br> Posts Lain <br><br>Are DEEP anime really that indistinguishable?</br></br></br></br>  Stop watching the anime like a bitch.  <br>babbies first "good" anime<br><br>it's a 5, get some taste</br></br></br>  No I am serious why is there literally no porn of Eva Heinemann?  <br>start watching it again when you are not underaged anymore and have aquired some taste</br>  People who criticize Monsters pacing early on have to be retarded. So many things happen so quickly, your dumb ADHD ass just gets bored with the lack of explosions and wants a smart way to express that. <br><br>The manga is better anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>it's not that nothing happens it's that everything that happens is so fucking contrived. Characters don't behave the way they are portrayed in monster so why am i watching it. They are as another user explained 'illogical and nonsensical' and on top of that the plot moves at a snail's pace which center entire epsiodes around fucking bit characters who just die in the end, leaving me wondering whether the show is going anywhere. I'm halfway through now and the premise does not interest me. I thought the idea of an omen style child of pure evil would interest me, but not when dragged over a length of 24 hours and filled with meticolous details of the lives's of arbitrary characters</br></br>    <br>agreed. This is the most childish pseudo intellectual nonsense i've ever seen. Anyone that likes it to pretend they have 'taste' is pathetic</br>  <br>fucking retard</br>  I found Monster very boring and dull and I tend to like pretty much all the shit /a/ says is boring DEEPshit. But this is the first show I've seen that I would actually stick that label to.   watching before reading   <br> Eva <br> not trap Johan <br>You have shit taste, amigo</br></br></br>  <br>No stop with the fucking jokes already this really bugs me. Like, I don't even plan to fap to it anymore. I'd just like to see something. Anything.</br>  <br>go watch more Naruto</br>  <br>You ever read Lord of the Flies ? My guess is they did that to themselves, he just gave them a little push.</br>  <br>why is he so fucking op. Most of this stuff is unrealistic af, i've lost the ability to suspend my disbelief. Also was there any possible reason of setting this in Germany and not japan especiallly if the dub is in fucking japanese whent hey don't even make use of the setting that much. This show is probably around a 3 or 4 out of 10</br>  <br>Nope. There's an episode in which the doctor guy and the boy travel with a retired couple in a car towards their destination. And then  nothing. The whole episode consists of them traveling while listening to the old people talk about themselves. <br><br>Johans story being so anti-climatic was the biggest flaw. Le monster in the book monster has no home monster is walking monster SHUT THE FUCK UP I DONT CARE</br></br></br>  <br> why is he so fucking op <br>he's not. The good part of the show is when you still think he's an OP sociopath. Then they couldn't think of any end goal for him so they turned him into a confused adult baby.</br></br>  <br><br>This sounds fucking shit why do people dickride it so hard. Because it's 'western'?</br></br>  <br>Because it's "deep"</br>  Sweaty, unwashed tits  I remember the smell of the under boob of my first wife in the mornings.<br><br>Fucking delicious.<br><br>That semen demen resembles her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>dayum since when did Eruna had big hoo hoos?<br><br> Mikagura Gakuin Kumikyoku thread? </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>RRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!</wbr></wbr></br></br>  Brilliantly engineered stern section.  <br>pls leave</br>  <br>What a preposterous poop deck.</br>  Spacious upper hull.  <br>I want you to take yourself and Moby Dick back into the ocean.</br>  Animeonly fag here<br><br>How wide is the gap between the anime and the manga?<br>Should I go ahead and catch up or just finish the anime and start reading afterwards?<br><br>  Also Shokugeki thread </br></br></br></br></br>  MC has black hair, not red.<br>That should give you an idea.</br>  <br>That's from the one-shot.<br>His hair is red</br></br>  <br> MC has black hair </br>  spoiler megumi marries the don guy  Spoiler<br>Alice x Mad dog OTP</br>  <br>finish the anime first</br>  <br> MC has black hair, not red. <br><br>Fucking really dude?<br><br><br> How wide is the gap between the anime and the manga? <br><br>They're about to dive into the Autumn Festival arc, which is a massive tournament arc that covers almost half of the chapters of the manga. Your call, but if I know one thing about shounen anime, it's that they love to draw out a tournament arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Autumn Festival <br><br>I meant Autumn Election, mixed it up with the Moon Banquet Festival.</br></br></br>  <br> Hair is black <br> Souma's a college-age student <br> Erina main girl <br> Erina falls for the dish <br>How else will the main series be different from the oneshot?</br></br></br></br></br>  I just read what was probably 1 or 2 episodes worth <br><br>up to the point where he tried that brown guys curry</br></br>  Why is Alice so perfect?  <br>his name is currynigger, get it right</br>  <br><br>Erina looks far better in this one.

First off, the hair looks stupid, I don't care if it's supposed to be a delinquent's pompadour because it's not done right. It's fucking wilting, okay, and he's already a spineless faggot so it definitely is not helping his image. And is he trying to pull a fast one on the readers? Because his gear and pencil stache and look is saying "hey look at me, I'm a bad boy," but his words and actions are those of a goddamn pussy. He may as well be an errand boy for a REAL man, like Souma. Hell knows why he's still here with that pussy-ass attitude, he was probably as big of a wimp BEFORE he came to Tootsuki and got wrung out. Souma should have challenged him to a Shokugeki and blown him out the window when he was burning through those second-years after Stagiare. A fucking useless character, who KNOWS he's useless, and stuck with the second most useless character on the show (Meat) who exists to blush and act like the whore she is. Fuck the Don, he isn't even a Don, FUCK the Don. Fucking pussy cunt.</br>  <br> Don <br> Bad boy </br></br>  <br> Souma <br> Real man <br>He is asexual and retarded</br></br></br>  <br>I do have to wonder what sex ed with Joichiro would be like.</br>  Will Erina develop a tsundere crush when she get to know that Soma is Joichiro´s son?  <br> He is asexual <br>And yet he has more prime pussy lined up for him than a Vegas pimp squad.<br> retarded <br>Can't cook if you're touched in the head.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Can't cook if you're touched in the head. <br>Now that's a Chopped episode I'd love to see: 4 retards in their kitchen.

Like "it's coming along" or "I'll have it next weekend"  Who is the best umi?  <br>Shovel.</br>  <br>I got distracted like a dumbass and couldn't finish it by last week like I said I would, but there's very little work left, I can get it done by tomorrow.</br>  <br>Hooray! Thanks anon</br>  <br>Thank you based anon</br>  <br>  What the flying FUCK is the point of bandaging your hair like that? <br>It was cut so the bandage holds it in place until it reattaches, obviously.</br></br>  <br>Yes, his whole gag is that he's spineless but dresses like a badass. Why the hell did you write a wall of text about a joke?</br>  <br>He wants to be a meme</br>  <br>trying too hard anon.</br>  <br> Should I go ahead and catch up or just finish the anime and start reading afterwards? <br>I marathoned all of the TLed manga after watching episode 15. It's worth it, while the anime has been a really good adaptation so far the manga is still superior. As for the gap, probably enough material for another cour after S2 ends, maybe 2 depending on where they end it exactly. Plus the manga has much better visual design than the anime</br></br>  The other Isobe Isobee Monogatari crossover is done and over at http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd. Will upload to Batoto when my connection stops fucking up. Sorry it took so long, don't know how to clean these things and only had Photoshop. And with this, everything recent is done, since Casanova apparently decided they would do the recipe omakes.<br><br><br>Add in this and everything official will be translated  except the recipe book ;_; </br></br></br>  Just caught up with the manga.<br><br>Tadokoro Megumi is waifu numero uno.<br><br>Falling shortly behind would be Nikumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina&gt;All</br>  <br>The anime does a better job with Erina, she looks like much less of a bitch compared to the camga</br>  <br> camga <br>Are you ok anon? And I personally like her bitchy look, although she also looks cute when she goes soft</br></br>  At any point in the manga is Erina not a bitch to Soma? Even from an animeonlyfag point of view the author is clearly going to to get them together but she has zero chemistry with Soma, Megumi makes more sense.  <br> better chemistry with Megumi. <br><br>No, it's boring.</br></br></br>  <br>She is a lot more dere after the autumn election</br>  I would read the manga but I don't want to fall into the trap of waiting week by week just for a sliver of a plot progression. I already did it with  SnK  and  One Piece  and now I deeply regret it; the chapter by chapter wait is too painful. I might have considered doing it with Shokugeki no Souma if the manga was close at all to finishing, but from what I hear it's only about half way or something.  <br><br>i wouldnt even call it halfway, they're still in the first year<br><br>and it's actually getting really popular so the authors might drag it a bit longer</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>I was under the imppression that erina was joichiro's daughter who was adopted because of her god ter taste</br>  <br>Why doesn't SnS have a cute mascot like Happy/Kon/Chopper?</br>  <br>erina is their cute mascot</br>  <br>Wouldn't watching the anime be a week to week wait too unless you're one of those marathon guys.</br>  <br> erina <br> cute </br></br>  <br>I only like marathoning manga. With anime, I can watch weekly or marathon it.</br>  <br>mascots are cancer</br>  <br> and it's actually getting really popular so the authors might drag it a bit longer <br>God I hope not. I hate it when they drag it out for the sales, and/or never end it.</br></br>  <br>Meat is best for Souma but we get no character development from her</br>  what the fuck is the point of karaage arc  <br>To use useless meat before it spoils.</br>  <br><br>Leonora &gt; all</br></br>  <br>Bit of a breather between hotel arc and long as fuck tournament arc.</br>  <br>It's simple fun and we meet another elite 10, starting the nigga events later on.</br>  Doesn't Erina's character CD get released today? Will someone upload it?    <br>Yes, hopefully.</br>  <br>Thanks for your work, based anon.<br>Are you translating the whole volume 1 or just the first chapter?</br></br>  <br>Lighthearted arc before the autumn election</br>  <br> Meat is best for Souma but we get no character development from her </br>  <br><br>She hasn't shown up or gotten any chapters since she got beat in the cook off?<br><br>If so, I'll likely never read the manga then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank God, the last thing we need is more meatfags.</br>  <br>There was the karaage arc in the manga but in the anime they skipped it</br>  <br>She joins the side cast. She still has no development in her romance because her feelings are typical "guy said something nice to me." There is some growth in her cooking. But fuck meatfags.</br>  <br>Souma has no concept of personal space and touches her hands, also keeps using Nikumi which he finds cute.<br>Poor girl can't help but being tsundere about that.</br></br>  Why are Jobbers so best girls?  <br>Because Alice is edgy Mary Sue and Takumi is faggot. Fuck off with your shit taste.</br>  <br>Why do people like Takumi so much? How can they shit on Meat for being a weak tsundere and then praise Takumi for the same shit?</br>  <br><br>Because Takumi has an actual character in addition to being a tsundere.</br></br>  <br>Because albino qt.</br>  <br>Takumi isn't disgusting.</br>  Gonna post the recipes from the recipe book in a couple of hours.  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>That'd be amazing.

I´ll do the rest later.</br>    <br> meg umi</br>  <br>No, mad shit is trash. Alice deserves better genes.</br>    Have you worshipped Ojou sama today?  <br>He's half-something, so that isn't too bad.<br>Compared to everyone being japanese or a fucking indian, he's basically tied with the Isami brothers for best genes.</br></br>  <br> 3D shit </br>  <br>But anon, Ryou is best boy.</br>  <br> Casanova apparently decided they would do the recipe omakes <br>What took them so long?

Please.</br>  <br>why do nips insist on dressing up as characters from anime and manga, when all the anime and manga characters worth dressing up as are white? even worse, they shit all over white people who dress up as their characters, even though they're the only ones representing the source material properly</br>  <br> Did they wait until the raws were posted on here? <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>pig disgusting</br>  <br>That beats japanese and indians, especially in the pleasuring a woman department.</br>  <br>Because white cosplayers are hideous most of the time.</br>  <br>Your husbando is literally Giganigga-tier.<br> only two characters who didn't make it into top-10 of popularity poll </br></br>  <br>What character?</br>  So how would Giganigga make sense if there's no Karage arc?  Look at this form  <br>If gigganigga was a bishounen he would have been one of fujos favorites.</br>  <br> when all the anime and manga characters worth dressing up as are white <br> implying <br>What about cosplays for all-Japanese casts, dingus? There's literally no visual difference between Asians and whites in anime anyway besides hair/eye color.<br><br><br>Fucking jeez. They said they wanted to use their own TL but I hope they don't pull a UTW.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 femininity</br>  <br>Giganigga's plot exposition will be replaced by expanding on Nao's character.</br>  <br>How is the anime pacing going to work out? Can they actually finish Autumn Election in time? Or will they come up with filler for the rest of the season to not start it yet?</br>  <br>Why even look at other girls</br>  <br>They'll wrap up the prelims and call it a day, I guess.<br>Cue second season.</br></br>  <br>They won't finish the Autumn Elections this season. They will only adapt the preliminaries.</br>  <br>it doesn't matter if the characters are stated to be of japanese descent, they are all shown to be white characters. thinking they're actually japanese despite being drawn as white, just because the author says so, is as retarded as believing hestia is an oppai loli just because they said so, when in reality she's just a genki shortstack.</br>  <br>Hestia is an oppai loli faglord.</br>  <br>Yes, and anons here would hate him like they hate Hayama.</br>  <br>Hestia makes me diamonds</br>  <br> it doesn't matter if the characters are stated to be of japanese descent, they are all shown to be white characters <br> this projection <br>Buddy, I've seen different takes on a certain character from both Asian and white cosplayers (good ones) and they both worked in different ways. Get off your high onahole.</br></br></br>  <br> those childbearing hips <br>Muh dick</br></br>  <br>Don't stare too long~</br>  <br> is as retarded as believing hestia is an oppai loli </br>  why are you faggots replying to obvious bait, you should be better than that. the oppai loli comment gave it away  <br><br>Since when have white people been noseless bug-eyed people with natural green hair?</br></br>  <br>I want to stare until she gets pregnant</br>  <br>I just wanted to post Hestia.</br>  <br>When's Volume 14 tankobon coming out? I could do with more Erina sketches.</br>  <br>August 4th.</br>  Posting best dish  <br> they don't pull a UTW. <br>I'm insufficiently familiar with translator drama to get this reference. What do you think they'll do with the omake?</br></br>  <br> implying peanut butter squid isn't the best dish </br>  <br> I'm allergic to both parts of that dish </br>  <br>I don't like peanut butter, but I'd hate to live without squid. Every time I order chinese I have squid tempura with honey and lemon dip for the starter. Shit is delicious. I'd make some myself but I don't have a deep fryer</br>  <br>I wish it was as simple as just being unable to eat squid.  Mild seafood allergy with a severe shellfish allergy. </br>  So back in the day, Gin was #1 and Joichiro was #2. Joichiro's cooking present-day makes Buddhist monks forsake their vows; has Gin kept up with his cooking or has he been behind the director's desk too long and lost his edge?  <br>Dojima doesn't even have his own restaurant, he works for other people instead of working for himself.</br>  <br>That sucks. My only allergy is alcohol, but it doesn't bother me at all.</br>    <br>I want to see more of this Takumi.</br>  <br>I am only allergic to kiwi fruit, and only in raw form (I can eat it in yogurt just fine). <br><br> <br> Mad Takumi is best Takumi </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of depressing, his level of talent and ability just being dropped like that.

I assume that the author didn't want to end their rivalry prematurely either, as it would inevitably had ended with Souma slapping some Italian ass.</br></br>  SHOKUGEKI NO  DSP !<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CKc<wbr>9cd1ffRI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Which is funny because Shinomiya himself had stopped improving.<br><br>I think people get pretty lost when they graduate because they already think they are so good and get offers to work everywhere and they end up losing their edge.<br><br>Jun is the only exception I can think of, even Shinomiya was lost before meeting Souma.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like I said, it makes sense to write it how the author did, but imagine the hype if Takumi pulled out that smooth Italian cooking and wrecked the guy.

Author made Kurokiba and Curry so they would be above Souma. Why can't MC and his rival start at the same level and grow simultaneously, sometimes let MC win, sometimes let rival win. But no, rivalry only last as long as rival is stronger - and when he is finally beaten, he either becomes friendly/joke character or eternal loser trying to catch up with MC (see Vegeta).</br>  <br> 15 minutes to cook an omelette <br><br>Sasuga DSP-san.</br></br></br>  <br> no milk when making an omelette <br>WHAT ARE YOU DOING DSP</br></br>  <br>He does use milk.

The OVA ended with season 2 for me.</br>  <br> The OVA ended with season 2 for me. <br>You could be right, it is just an end of an era for some of us. I myself refuse to let go of my waifu, and accept she will never be relevant again.</br></br>  <br>sooner than expected.</br>  <br>I was a member of the RFFC back in the day, but there's no hope for the Tenchi franchise with Kajishima at the helm. He just doesn't give a fuck about the original cast, and I suspect he particularly dislikes Ryoko.<br>Look at how she's been treated in everything he's written since the 90s. She's become a joke character with almost no screentime.</br></br>  <br>Japanese are afraid of tomboys. Pretty much every main girl for the last couple of decades has been some ultra generic bitch.</br>  <br>I think Ryoko was the most popular character when the first OVA were released in the mid-90s, even in Japan. However, her popularity declined as they watered down the franchise and made the characters into caricatures. When there is any kind of focus on the original cast, it's usually on Sasami/Tsunami, followed by Washu and Aeka. Most of the focus seems to be on the terrible new characters Kajishima wants to force into the show.<br>The only thing he's made in the past 15 years that was half-decent was Isekai, as some of the characters were actually endearing and well designed. I don't see the point of setting everything in the Tenchiverse, though.</br></br>  Let lay this age old question to rest.<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4990159</br></br>  <br> http://strawpoll.me/4990159/r <br><br><br>Fucking Washu is hacking the poll again!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, that third OVA was brutal. Sure, it flat out tells you what's going on in the series, but god damn it was bad. Might as well read the Tenchi Wiki, or better yet just pay closer attention during the earlier OVAs.</br>  <br>Representing.</br>    <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br> best girl <br><br>No one knows who she is...</br></br></br>  <br>Superior lifeform</br>  <br>Were her tits that big before?</br>  <br>Best waifu</br>  <br>That's your problem, not mine.</br>  <br>Anon, she’s not in the strawpoll, how does that makes you feel?</br>  <br> anybody caring about Kiyone Masaki <br>Kiyone Makibi is the one in the poll, fool.</br></br>  <br> denial is a powerful allied  <br><br>Keep posting Kiyone Makibi, I'm really just trolling but you have to accept the fact that shes no canon.</br></br></br>  <br>When and what?</br>  <br> she was made by the three people who made the original OVA story line <br> appeared in the novel that the OVA was based on <br> appeared before Noike and Kiyone Misaki <br> SHE'S NOT CANON </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was an obsessive Tenchi fan in my youth. I bought, downloaded, watched and read everything I could come across that was related to the OVA or Universe.<br>But I couldn't actually finish the third OVA. It was so fucking bad.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to Masaki Kajishima. You will be surprised by the answer.</br>  <br> Masaki 'real women don't act like they do in my anime' Kajishima <br> Masaki 'My self insert is being ignored for these hot women, better dumb them down.' Kajishima </br></br>  <br>Ironically I was going to add a note next to Kiyone's name in the poll that reads (Yes, shes canon). I should had done that.</br>    She will always be the voice to mai waifu.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD9<wbr>cMvxkOHY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>"Why is Galaxy Police Officer MAKIBI Kiyone not in the original OVA series or the Okuda manga?"<br><br>Because Kajishima-sensei didn’t make her up; she was invented by HASEGAWA Naoko-sensei for her spinoff novels and didn’t see the screen until after OAV 1 was completed (first showing up in anime for the Mihoshi Special). The Okuda manga is based on the OVA series, so it doesn’t include her either.<br><br><br>Please just.... LET IT GO</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except she's canon. Kajishima is just a giant man child and couldn't handle all the women having a better personality then his self insert. Watch this video, pleb. <br/></br>  <br>Nah, she can do angry Ryouko but she can't do sexy Ryouko.<br><br>Superior Ryouko's singing makes me diamonds.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Achika and Kiyone were introduced to the lore first, making them canon. </br></br>    <br>Burchard could do sexy Ryoko, but she couldn't do emotional Ryoko.</br>  <br>I don't care about this "canon" bullshit.<br>Kiyone is the best girl out of the damn thing.<br>Kiyone was in Ryo-ohki manga, and computer game.<br>Kiyone appeared in almost any possible spin-off, except for the latest ones, where it's actually a relief.<br>Nothing else matters.</br></br></br></br></br>    Fuck, wonder if I should rewatch Universe. I don't think I've watched it since the 90s.  <br> not finding Petrea's faintly raspy voice sexy. <br>Where I do respect, and appreciate your taste in all things related Ryo(u)ko. I wont hesitate to fuck up your face for undermining her original dubbed VA.</br></br>  Best non-canon girl  <br> irrelevant logic </br>  <br>Universe is a great watch. I watched it first before the 1st season of the OVA. It is wacky star trekking space hijacks. With a hot, and sexy bounty hunter to boot.</br>  <br>A few months ago Kajishima released a doujin.<br>Only a few pages and no dialogue, it's mostly just a preview for what he has planned.<br>He just has to get it greenlit and produced, which is likely as Ai! Tenchi Muyo was successful in it's purpose, which was to gauge the interest in the franchise, and results were positive.</br></br></br>  <br>Never liked her. Too much of a Mary Sue.</br>    <br>I remember first watching that movie on sci-fi one Saturday morning in the mid 90s. God bless you sci-fi, and your Japanimation Weekends.</br>  <br>Goddamn, Mihoshi.<br>Also count the carrots.</br></br>  <br> Best non-canon girl <br><br>Now, this is an entire new debate we can have...</br></br></br>  <br>And here comes the new info.</br>  <br>True, but she was still quite attractive. Her role was not that major to be anything other than a thorn in Ryoko's hot sexy butt.</br>  <br>I wonder what the purpose of all the shitty spinoffs is. I could get Universe, as they wanted to capitalize on the success of the show, by making a TV series. But all the other shitty shows? Shin, GXP, Ai, Pretty Sammy? What the fuck.<br><br>Why does this fuck keep making paper thin caricatures based on a show that was carried entirely by its cast? There's a reason this stood out among the plethora of other OVAs with a similar premise, and he just keeps shitting all over its legacy.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn Ryoko's got a flat butt. Thank god she got an ass in Ai Tenchi.</br>    Nagi was meant to be in Tenchi in Tokyo, but her voice actress didn't want to voice her again.  <br><br><br> mfw you will never see 90's animation in Tenchi Muyo again </br></br></br>  <br>And Rea joins the cabal of women that rule the universe.</br>  <br> dem hot bath scenes </br>  <br>Take your negro preferences elsewhere.</br>  <br>The new shit looks so ugly.</br>  <br> Ai Tenchi Muyo <br> any good <br>Look upon these abominations, and weep.</br></br></br>    <br>Seems like fan art from pixiv...</br>  <br><br>Hey, she had a great ass in Ai, and wasn't afraid to show it.</br></br>  <br>she's always been pretty stacked, even flaunts them in front of ayeka</br>  <br>Might as well be. I gave Ai a try just for the sake of seeing my waifu again, and dropped it after the first 5min episode when none of the original main girls were in it.</br>  <br> Shin, GXP, Ai, Pretty Sammy? <br>Shin was a manga series that picked up where OVA 2 left off. It makes complete sense to make a manga when you're not about to get the funding for more OVAs.<br>GXP I can't explain, but I enjoyed it.<br>With Ai, they were given money to make it.<br>And Pretty Sammy was jumping on the Mahou Shoujo bandwagon expanding on a concept from Universe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dat story arc <br> dat concept art <br> dat short running time <br><br>Tenchi Muyo is dead</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the Japan hairspray supply went scarce for Ryoko.</br>  <br>I like Washu, save for the fact he got rid of her crab hair.<br>Sasami and Ayeka are alright too. A bit more sexualized, but no major change.</br></br>  <br>it wasn't anything to write home about<br><br>her original designs are superior in every way<br><br>as with everyone else in Ai, it was just shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no love for Beni the Oni </br>  <br>To be fair, it was just promotion animations for tourism. All the episodes were funded simply to help bring in tourist to Takahashi.</br>  <br> no major change <br>It was all shit.</br></br>  <br>Some may say that TenchiMuyo is the Call of Duty of Japanese animation.</br>   Ai has Ryoko and Ayeka reading yuri <br> before it cuts away, they look at each other <br>Think they remember what they did in Universe?</br></br>  <br>they remembered they used to be relevant</br>  <br>I'm going to Japan next years is not helping Takahashi at all.</br>  <br>You made me feel sad after I thought about it.</br>    <br>So you are the one multi voting for Washu!</br>    Sad to see how the style just devolves over time.  Wish there was something new to talk about instead of feeling like this is a circle jerk of nostalgic faggots pining for something new, and relevant.  <br>The Anime Ryokos look nothing like the way Ryoko looked in Ranma 1/2.</br>  Name a few good animation studios that can do honor to Kajishima's original art.  <br> Shin was a manga series that picked up where OVA 2 left off. <br>No, Shin Tenchi Muyo is what people now refer to as Tenchi in Tokyo.</br></br>  <br>Toei.</br>  <br>Anything new on "New Paradise War"?</br>  <br>What studios that are still around and not bought out, bankrupt, or shut down?<br><br>That is rough.</br></br></br>  DUDE CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!  <br>What an amazing trick</br>  <br><br>The eyes, hair, and jaw line in all of the incarnations except Ai were close to the original. My biggest problem was how the art direction in Ai completely revamped the original designs, and ruined any sense of attachment to the original characters.</br></br>  <br>At least they kept their personalities.</br>  <br>I think we have a Ryoko, and Washu fag fighting with proxies.</br>  <br>Technically yes, but I was too put of by the overall design of the show. It felt and looked way to fucking generic.</br>  <br>Kajishima's original art looks like shit. Not sure if it always looked like shit, but I'm guessing the art was adapted by someone for the original OVAs, and that they didn't rely on Kajishima's style entirely.</br>  <br> put off* <br><br>In addition, it is just a bit depressing that there is still no good translations of the lite novels. To me that would be the only new thing left to read that has anything to do with Tenchi Muyo.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm guessing there's a Washufag using a proxy, while the Ryoko votes are real.</br>  <br>The company that did the Tenchi OVAs for Kajishima was contacted by Toho to do a Godzilla anime.</br>  <br>I voted for Ryoko, but we only have 14 unique posters in this thread.</br>  <br>Ok?</br>  <br>mah nigga, best girl</br>  <br>You can vote without posting. Lurkers usually far outnumber posters.</br>  <br>You would probably know more than me.</br>    <br>Ryoko with lip stick is gorgeous, but kind of off putting because it seems too out of character for her.</br>  <br>I really don't know. I was hoping to see news about New Paradise because I heard that War on Geminar gained some attention, but after Tenchi Ai all news about TenchiMuyo went cold.</br>  <br>There's only like 3 of us that know that Washu is best girl regardless of what deluded Ryokofags think, but proxyfag is not me.<br><br>Also<br> Ayeka <br> having votes <br>Shit pole.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ryokofag here<br> Mihoshi that low <br>Fucking bullshit</br></br>      <br>Mihoshifags are sound asleep</br>  <br> deluded Ryokofags <br>Hey, fuck you buddy.</br></br>    <br>More like generic cunts.</br>  <br>Well they should wake up</br>  Butt?  <br>SHA-WING!</br>  I think Ai Ryoko looks okay  I am almost finished downloading the torrent for this. Had trouble finding it and I think it is recent, no peer except one had 100%. Took me months to get to 95%.        Harem fags get the fuck out, it's Ryoko only or bust.  <br><br>And I thought it couldn't get any worse than Tenchi in Tokyo. TiT would have been better if they had simply come up with new characters.<br><br><br>ayyy lmao</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel you dawg, but harem end is canon.<br><br> Ryoko is still head wife. </br></br></br>  <br>Ryouko a best</br>  <br>Between the harem end and OVA 3, Universe became the superior version of Tenchi.</br>      <br>Tenchi stuck his dick into a cat/rabbit hybrid thing, that also transforms into a space ship.<br><br> I so fucking jelly. </br></br></br>      <br>Lum was pretty much Proto-Ryoko.</br>      <br>Or was Ryoko 90's Lum?</br>    <br>derp</br>    <br>Yes? What would be y2k's Lum/Ryoko? Quality waifu I mean.</br>                 Tenchi's OVA/Universe animators were contacted to make a Godzilla anime. <br> they did this image. </br>  My Ryoko folder is expanding.<br><br>Gracious</br></br>          <br>You can't post that here! This is a Christian image board!</br>  Just rewatched the OVA on BD. Is it just THORA or were those transfers kind of shitty? I'm sure new ones would look really good, but the lines were so soft.        <br>Heh. I made that probably a decade ago. Just copied the picture in the opening, but still.</br>    <br>Film grain and all. You don't see that kind of detail in digitally produced animation. It reminds me that someone drew, and painted all those cell frames by hand. I adore it.</br>    <br>I will now fap to it, again.</br>     Ai sets up a scenario with Ryoko and Tentacles <br> no doujins have been made for it. </br>      <br>Looks like those tentacles are about to get pwnt.</br>  <br><br>That's what I'm talking about, the lines were still extremely soft when normally film transfers should be really soft. I attribute it to Tenchi being an earlier BD, but check out something like Shin Cutey Honey where the grain is more visible with a better overall image.</br></br>    <br>Most likely the encoders ran a DNR filter or two to take down the grain, which blurs the lines.<br>But THORA is usually good about not doing that.<br>It's possible the the studio who released the BD may have done their own DNR.</br></br></br>    <br>Do you have a screen cap? I don't have any BDs to compare anything other than a few caps I've saved in my folder.</br>          <br><br>I'll just take from the OP, since that's usually where the best quality is.</br></br>      After that disgrace called Ai Tenchi Muyo, I want the franchise to just RIP.    <br>It was better then Sailor Moon Crystal.</br>  <br><br><br>Tenchi IS still recoverable despite Ayyyy, but yeah, SMC is a much larger blight.</br></br></br>  <br>Hold that thought until OVA 4.</br>  <br>Not even doujin makers watched Ai.</br>  <br>First off<br><br> OVA series <br> Season <br><br>Second, a Tenchi thread on /a/? Pinch me, I must be dreaming</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see what you mean. It looks like someone used blur in photoshop to soften them lines. That sucks.</br>  <br>We have exactly one a fortnight</br>  <br> Tenchi thread on /a/?

Aikan Muyo anyone?<br><br> Ryoko forever waifu after that one, even if completely non-canon it's exactly how'd she'd be. </br></br>  I heard that GXP's officially canon LNs are far superior (and without NB, I believe that), so wouldn't it be nice if we got a new anime after OVA 4?  <br>'real' harem endings are just as bad as 'MC doesn't make a choice at all' endings.</br>  <br>People still remember that?<br>Wonder what happened to Happosai.

My mom walked in while I was watching a/the beach episode with some kind of swimsuit contest and made me change the channel.<br><br>I went right back watching it and feeling weird in my pants as soon as she left the room.<br><br>Watching Ryoko was like..../ss/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ryoko made many a young boy into a man.</br>  <br> man <br><br>You mean perverts...</br></br></br>  <br>That's not a ranking, it's a watching order.</br>  <br>Tumblr would say those two things are exactly the same. <br><br>Do ho ho.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasami was my first crush. I was about the same age as her at the time it was broadcast on Toonami.</br>  <br>  I was about the same age as her <br>700?</br></br>  <br> my face when seeing my beloved ryoko's new design </br>  <br>Asobi ni Iku Yo<br>And it was EXCELLENT</br></br>  <br>Best and only taste worth noting</br>  I was kinda sad when it turned out airi the gmilf was a red herring before introducing noike. having an older looking final harem member would have been cool.  <br> having an older looking final harem member would have been cool. <br>Agreed. At least there's Flora and Yayoi.</br></br>  <br>Relax my brother of ebony skin tone, it is not canon.</br>  Fact: Tenchi in Tokyo was the greatest deconstruction of harem ever created. Anyone who doesn't like it doesn't understand what it was actually about.  <br>I get it now, but I'm still not going to rewatch it.</br>  <br>Fact: Tenchi in Tokyo was just garbage. Anyone that actually likes it have shit tastes.</br>  <br>I had to go into the vault for this one, friend.</br>      <br>Which one is the 3rd OVA again? There's so much Tenchi OVAs out there.</br>  <br>Ryo-Ohki, the sub-par one. Introduces members of Tenchi's family and the last member of the harem.</br>  <br>Most of /a/ wasn't born when that was a meme.</br>  <br>And that's why most of /a/ doesn't appreciate the genius that is Tenchi in Tokyo.</br>  <br>Apologist please.</br>  <br>Plebeian please.<br><br>Tenchi in Tokyo was not about Tenchi at all, and that's what made it better than all the other Tenchi media. It was about Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and Kiyone and how fucking weird they are without plot expediency always covering up their bullshit.<br><br>And the episodes that are mostly just about Tenchi? They show how fucking boring of a character he is. Those episodes lambast him as the hollow, worthless character that he is. Yoshihiro Takamoto completely deconstructs Tenchi Muyo and shows us how ugly, uninspiring all the characters and settings are. It's 26 episodes of "fuck you, harem cliche'" that manchildren cannot properly appreciate.<br><br>THAT is why Tenchi in Tokyo is an achievement in anime and THAT is why you people, the people who consume the rest of the garbage Tenchi medium, hate it. Because it exposes you. It makes you think. It shows how shallow your tastes are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is pretty stale pasta.</br>  <br>You seem to be under the impression that all of the alternate universe shit is Kajishima's doing.<br><br>Anything not connected to the main OVA universe (e.g. Tenchi TV, TiT, Pretty Sammy TV, the movies etc.) was AIC being greedy fuckers who kept producing cash-in spinoffs, instead of funding a continuation of Kajishima's canon, even though there was material available.</br></br></br>  <br>Could be worse, could end like the manga did.<br><br> Build up the second to last volume where Kagato Disciple shows up and clones Kagato. <br> Turns out to be imperfect so it's just a doll. <br> She also decides to clone Tenchi's Mother <br> Could turn into a huge battle <br> All but the last two issues are Tenchi with an Oedipus complex.  <br> Disciple and Kagato clone get one shot by magical energy. <br> NOTHING CHANGED <br>Glad I never met the artist at a con, I'd have thrown my chair at him for that horrible ending.<br>Also, imagine if /a/ existed during the Toonami run. Because Tenchi Muyo trail blazed some new ideas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tenchi being on Toonami was one of the first instances of having something that wasn't a pure action series being broadcast. Having those pure slice of life episodes are a complete shift from your Gundams or Dragon Balls.</br></br>  <br>I'd love a GXP adaption of the novels, without Nabeshin's self-advertisment brand of directing.<br><br><br>She looked so damn pretty in the first OAV episode.<br><br><br>I was generally ok with the redesigns, but dropped it over it being yet another reboot that seemed flanderize the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was actually better when Mihoshifags were sound asleep.</br>  <br> Mitsuki Rara <br><br>who<br><br>Either way, you are me, except I would have Mihoshi and Washu as a combo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She, like the rest of her species, does S&amp;M to the male during their wedding night.</br>  High quality  <br><br> http://strawpoll.me/4990159 <br>Kiyone needs more love!<br> or at least a promotion </br></br></br></br>  OOOOHOHOHOHO! RYOKO PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY  <br>Well don't worry, Seina gets to be treated by her (whether he wants to or not)!<br><br>Her and Lady Seto (speaking of, GXP's dub is even worse than the 1994 OVA dub) get to have their turns on him, even though he's already married to 9 other women</br></br></br>  <br>Well at least she doesn't whip the shit out of them like a certain dyed hair skank</br>        <br>Shit, I forgot that one isn't SFW.</br>  <br>Muh Dick. God Washu is amazing. Always instantly diamonds.</br>   Sasami is pure     Check this shit out    <br>That's a hell of a geneology. Lets introduce some sex linked dominant/recessive traits and start predicting whether or not a descendant can produce light hawk wings.</br>  <br>I change my vote</br>  <br>Pretty much i think the real reason was just lazy design so they set it up so they could make as many look alikes as possible.</br>  <br><br>I wonder if Juraians are less inbred than their human subspecies.</br></br>  <br><br>How was the new brown girl?</br></br>  <br>Never, I hope. I love Tenchi Muyo! too much to want it dragged through the mud any further by Kajishima. OVA3 and the second cour of GXP were a travesty. Isekai was a return to form, but I couldn't give a fuck about an all new cast. It hurt me deeply to see Ryoko relegated to third string status.</br>  <br>NB is in it but he's not the same thank god. Kajishima has said he wants it to get an anime but I doubt it will.<br><br><br> It was about Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and Kiyone and how fucking weird they are without plot expediency always covering up their bullshit. <br><br>Nigga please. It changed all the sarcasm, back-biting and vindictiveness of the girls into physical violence played off as comedy routines. Tenchi in Tokyo is garbage for trash people.<br><br><br>OVA3 wasn't even that bad and the blame should be placed on the studios for cutting his episode allotment and making him wait so long he gave up on trying to finish it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Second cour of GXP <br> travesty <br><br>It had the god mecha and Seina actually being badass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cour2 was pretty much the only decent part of it.</br>  <br>When did this happen?</br>  <br>Back when anime could have nipples<br>What happened?</br></br>  <br>Blu-Ray sales.</br>  <br>Every time she spoke was sexy Ryoko.</br>  <br>Japanese version of Parernt/Teacher Associations (PTA) cracking down on media and asking for censorship. <br><br>Godless Japan was best Japan. Moralfags have almost ruined it.</br></br></br>  Zero Ryoko....<br>Why are we not including her to the harem again?</br>   Comiket just around the corner <br> New canon Masaki doujin <br><br>Hyped</br></br></br>  <br> Zero Ryoko.... <br> Why are we not including her to the harem again? <br>She is IN Ryoko now. The real Ryoko allowed her to fuse because it benefits her to gain more emotions.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I raised you Minagi</br></br>  <br>GXP has flesh colored nipples, which suck. Even the dog-cat people have colored ones.<br><br><br>No, Ryoko was always a cyborg anon. It's just that she was separated from her more emotional form.</br></br></br></br>       No one translating the material on Ex <br> No one translating GXP LN which is now at 12 books <br> Not even translating Paradise Wars and its 1 volume at the moment <br><br>What the flying fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, Ryoko was always a cyborg anon. It's just that she was separated from her more emotional form. <br> That was a lie by Washu. </br></br>  <br>LN translations have never really been a thing, anon. Not in any large sense. <br><br>It's a shit ton more work than just subbing a show. I'd love for those to get translated, but we'd have to probably get professionals to do it.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe being biased but it feels like every time I turn around there's a new harem LN or WN getting translated.</br>  <br>Damn, that outfit was so sexy, I wish Ryoko wore it more often in the show.</br>  <br>Probably for shows with more current and active fanbases, sadly. <br><br>If only we had the resources and talent we have now back then.</br></br></br>   mfw the thread still lives and has become depressing   Last bump before imminent thread death.  It's kinda sad seeing people shit on the series because of various spin-offs when the creator wants to do something else but frequently gets cockblocked.  <br>What if I told you that there's a ton of untranslated material and canon porn?</br>  <br><br> accept </br></br>  <br>What if I told you I already knew those things exist, but that doesn't help the fact they are not available because of lack of mass appeal.</br>  <br> except <br>English is hard anon.</br></br>  <br><br>Did you check the poll?</br></br>    Man I love anything an all tenchi related, except Tokyo. so i'll eat this shit up    <br>I made the poll, and yes I meant except. No one like Noike.</br>  <br>Tenchi stuck his dick in EVERYTHING</br>  <br>wait is that seina marrying ryoko and aayekas daughters?</br>  <br>You wouldn't?</br>  <br> &gt;They turned Mihoshi into a bumbling retard and stripped out her competent <br><br><br>Even in the OVA Mihoshi was a clown.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's Seina's and Kiriko's son.</br>  <br>Remember that report she gave that was so huge they had to shrink it down by a lot?<br><br>Besides, the reason why she acts this way is because  she killed herself, but was brought back to life. Now her brain is messed up, or at least was, because now she can have her hair down without losing her memory again </br></br></br>        <br> Yamada <br><br>Seina loves the pussy...literally.</br></br></br>        <br> there are people shocked by this <br> like the signs weren't there long before </br></br>      <br> Black hair <br><br>Is this a retcon? Because black hair suits her.<br><br>I'd like to think that human hair color is dominate in whatever the fuck Airi's species is/Juraians and humans</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mihoshi looks serious and less hyper-girly now.<br><br>Is her brain fixed again?</br></br></br>  <br>What subseries/episode is this from?</br>  <br> fixed <br>Dumb mihoshi best mihoshi</br></br>  <br>What a fucking abortion</br>  <br>Its a hentai, loosely connected to the main continuity. Spaceship Agga Ruter. It has nothing to do with Tenchi Muyo though.</br>   tenchi muyo ai <br><br><br>out of everything of that abortion i truly hoped it made that little town get more tourism bux.</br></br></br>  <br> Is her brain fixed again? <br>Her brain is fixed ever since that doujin explaining the upgraded bath house. The only question is if it was ever going to be a plotpoint or was it dropped.<br><br>To be honest, I believe Mihoshi's medical condition was only ever going to be plot relevant BEFORE there was literal gods coming and going as they please. But now we know with Isekai that they openly discussed resurrections, a mere medical problem just seemed trivial.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no seeded torrents <br>I'll never watch it again.</br></br>  <br>I think anon meant the time she was going into a suicidal spiral that led to an accident to put her mind going into a vegetable state when Tenchi did not love her enough. Everyone loves bubbly Mihoshi.</br>  <br> Spaceship Agga Ruter <br>keep searching nigga. Dont give up.</br></br>  <br> Tenchi <br><br>It wasn't Tenchi, it was some other humanoid being.</br></br></br>    <br> It has nothing to do with Tenchi Muyo though. <br>Actually it takes place 700 years before Tenchi. And a couple elements like the bioweapon genetics &amp; the tech behond zero carry over.</br></br>  <br><br>what is bakabt</br></br>      <br>Kajishima wins again. It must annoy him that other people demand loli characters. And yet he just age them up before sexualising them.</br>  <br>aic took them to the cleaners. that turd won't do anything to boost tourism dollars.</br>    <br>nah, just a phase she went through</br>  <br>Ryoko is always perfection.<br><br> Except Ai Ryoko. </br></br></br>  <br> It must annoy him that other people demand loli characters. <br>That it does.</br></br>  <br> kingdom of amalur all over again  <br><br>poor japanese rhode island.</br></br></br>  <br> poor japanese rhode island. <br>The silly thing is they could have simply done something canon instead of introducing new characters no one gave a shit about. The OVA universe already have plenty of elements that promote the town, there was no reason to make any changes.</br></br>    <br>maybe it was a test in the waters thing? Not hurt the original stuff and also try out see if people want the new archetypes in this day and age?</br>  <br>What am I looking at?</br>  <br>Ryoko and her shoulder-pads. Same old Ryoko. Kajishima knows what Ryoko is like and despite this being a new image, I can tell it is the same character. <br><br>And is that ALL THREE gems on her neck? She disguised two of them as snake eyes. clever.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, who the fuck is this?</br>  <br>If i had seen the original series and never heard of ai and somebody told me this was Ryoko i'd never believe them.

Theresia is a fighter with a dark past and Jill calls on her fairy friends to help those in need.<br><br>Hopefully Miura won't see this and get any ideas, otherwise we'll have six months of this spinoff miniseries before another eight month hiatus.</br></br>  Which death was the most painful one?<br>This one really hit me in the  wrong  spot.</br>  <br><br>ACTUAL story:<br><br>Theresia's city got invaded hard. She's an angry refugee now.<br><br>Jill's experiences made her the defacto leader of her village, and she led them to safety. Her father is older, and meaker, and Jill is taller and more assertive. <br><br>We'll see both very soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a dumb boy</br>  <br>Worst translation ever</br>  And then Jill becomes an idol.  <br><br>For some reason contemplating one's last words is extremely surreal to me, and this was easily the death that lingered longest as I was reading.</br></br>  <br><br> Knowing that Miura would ruin modern Jill because he wants to make these perfect little idol girls of his fantasies instead of dynamic real characters who go through real hardships. </br></br>  <br>I like<br> I'm glad to see you cry <br>much more</br></br></br>  <br>Judeau, giving his all for his waifu right to the bitter end.</br>  <br><br>Way too small to be her. She's older than that.</br></br>  <br>  i drew fanart of this exact situation once  </br>  <br>It's inaccurate, though. Hawk scans are rife with mistakes and intentional meddling.<br><br>That said, there are a few lines I like more, too. Like when Wyald is about to hit Guts with a tree, he says "Now let's see you fly...like a hawk!" in the Hawks scan. I felt that was a much better line for that character than the official translation, which you can see here.</br></br></br>  <br>ACTUAL ACTUAL story<br>Theresia got raped by trolls. Jill was murdered by an unicorn.</br></br>  <br>Because it's old bait. Pretty bad, too.</br>  <br> Jill was murdered by an unicorn. <br>Raped, then murdered. Unicorns love deflowering virgins. It probably figured out that she was impure after the first few minutes and decided to gore her to death instead.<br><br>Thanks again, creepy guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like<br> wannabe waifu </br></br>  <br>Nah I think it would have gone like in this doujin.</br>  <br>There i can think of like 2 or 3 lines in the heat of action that come across way better.

Especially Lost Children.  <br>Gods work anon<br> I love you </br></br>  <br> I'm surprised that none of the post-eclipse stuff has ever been adapted into an OVA. Especially Lost Children. <br><br>OVAs were big from 84-91, with fewer coming out in the 90's and even less in the 00's. Berserku started in 89, and didn't get mainstream popular until the tv show in 98. Berserku just came out at the wrong time. If it was a 70's manga, it would have gotten at least a few OVAs, like Debruman.</br></br></br>  <br>Please do. <br><br><br>I feel bad for them.  ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Thought there might have been chance in late 90s/ early 00s, before or around when TV series became the big thing.</br>  <br><br>Man those should be the actual character names, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>left</br>  <br><br>It could have been possible. Like, instead of a full adaption of the Golden Age storyline, we got instead a few one hour OVAs which adapted smaller parts of the storyline.</br></br>  <br>It's all so fucked up when you realize Casca desired it more than anything and Griffith subconsciously wanted it as well.<br>W-wil Miura find a way?</br></br>  <br>Post Eclipse Nightmare<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gPC<wbr>Nvzcxvgs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>C-can you s-samefag harder?</br>  <br>I'm not samefagging, anon.</br>  <br>Actually, I feel that TV series suited the Golden Age best - but there's something about Lost Children, and maybe the earliest chapters along with Conviction, that would have made their discovery in the store and subsequent blind viewing at home very memorable.</br>  <br>its called dark souls</br>  <br> That salty as fuck Locust <br><br>Why is Rickert so based? Locust spent an entire chapter trying to intimidate/mind break Rickert, and he responded by slapping Griffith and walking away like a boss.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If I had my way, I'd do Black Swordsman arc in a 3 part OVA, at 45 minutes each in 1998 instead of Golden Age tv show.</br></br>  <br>I kinda hated Farnese back then but I still prefer her over her current self. She's not insane anymore but just completely bland and uninteresting. At least she was something special back then.</br>  Best Berserk  amv <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YEF<wbr>6D32HNMI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Just fucking figured it out. 청년단 means band of falcon.<br><br>Page 7:<br>Rickert: ...Anyways, this village is amazing. There are tons of huge buildings, water and sewage are properly managed, and the roads are very well-made. And to top it off, they even have things like these...<br>Erica: The baths are huge too! There's even running water in the bathrooms~<br>Rickert: If this city is the one from legends,<br>Rickert: The technology here would be much more advanced than other places.. (not sure what he's saying here but I think he's trying to infer that the person who made this town is a role model)<br>Slut 1: Not really.<br>Slut 1: The fact that you fixed such an advanced machine proves how good you are.<br><br>Page 8:<br>Slut 1: If you're that skilled, you can find a job anywhere.<br>Slut 1: After all, this city is practically made for engineers to immerse themselves in.<br>Slut 2: Besides, I heard you were in Sir Griffith's old band, the one who was invited here, am I right?<br>Ricket: Yeah (you fucking penis-breath whore)<br>Slut 2: A man who can work and also has connections! How about it? You and me!<br>Slut 3: No, me!<br>Slut 2: Oho? Are you getting mad and worrying for your brother?<br>Slut 3: Little girls should just go play in the bath~<br>Rickert: ..However<br>Rickert: Staying in this town...<br>Slut 1: ..Did something happen?<br>Rickert: ....<br><br>Page 9:<br>Slut 2: You hit...<br>Slut 1: You did what?<br>Slut 3: Sir Griffith..!?<br>Rickert: I.. I....<br>Slut 1: It's not something you can tell others, is it?<br>Slut 2: But isn't that a little.. y'know..<br>Slut 3: Even if they were acquaintances.<br>Slut 2: That conversation..<br>Slut 3: I'll just forget about it.<br>Slut 1: Is it something to worry about?<br>Slut 1: Men will be men.. Comrades who eat and sleep together will occasionally fight.<br>Rickert: Because we're comrades..<br><br>Basically slut 1 is trying to justify Rickert's actions against Griffith as something that normally happens between men, without knowing Rickert's true reasons for slapping his shit in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm glad to see you cry <br>Never realized Judeau was such a sick fuck.</br></br>  <br>Do I continue? The more I translate the more I realize that this entire chapter is just filler garbage.</br>  <br>does anyone know which prostitute is which<br><br>i know their names are lucie, pepe, and foucet, but idk who is who</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's up to you anon, there's no rush since it is just filler garbage but I for one would appreciate it.</br></br>  <br>Oh gosh...

The series has had so few updates in years new readers will have no god damn idea what's happening.</br></br>  <br>hell Yeah! I wish there was more fast, special attacks available in dark souls, like the dark wood grain ring, but for offensive. I wonder if a skill tree like system would ruin dark souls..</br>  <br><br>You better continue anon or god helps me i will...  Do nothing  </br></br>  <br>So the one posted above is basically the new chapter? Now we have to wait until next month in order to get the story going???</br>  <br><br>Yes. Welcome to Berserk.</br></br>  <br>He's comic relief  until he dies just like chichi </br>  <br>still autist</br>  <br> Those sluts thinking they have a chance wth Rickert, bitch-slapper of God Hands. </br>  <br> call someone else a moron <br> use a cum dumper girl image reaction </br></br>  <br> Gattsu <br>???</br></br>  Can gattsu kill Griffith without sacrificing the whole world?  <br>Lucie is the blonde, wavy haired one. Foucet is the rather plain, black haired one. Pepe is the smug one who nearly got hauled off by the HICKs to the happy fungeon.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> Gattsu <br><br>Guts. Stop reading the shitty Hawk scans.</br></br></br>  So are the new chapters gonna be 20 pages long ?<br>Really?<br>Only 20 pages per month?</br></br>  <br>At least it's something, better than nothing for 6 <br>months...</br></br>  <br>So then what was that thing on the leaked paged about 100 pages?</br>  <br><br> per month <br><br>Anon...</br></br></br></br>  Does Miura even give a shit anymore?  how was the new chapter anyway? I can't read moon  <br> Pepe is the smug one <br><br>how did he know</br></br></br>  <br>But its confirmed for monthly release from now on</br>   have Berserk on Backlog for 2 years <br> everyone keeps talking about how great it is <br> get into Dark Souls/Bloodborne <br> apparently Berserk everywhere <br> just finished reading entire manga + anime <br> mfw <br>I couldn't imagine the agony of waiting for that hiatus to end. Hunter x Hunter has it bad enough. But at least Berserk's art didn't turn into scribbles.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the point of posting that /v/ pic?</br>  <br>Don't insult my /v/ pics</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Aw shit.<br>Just found a fuckton of redraws for the DH scans, so no more annoying white lines in the middle of the spreads.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!uc8UzTwI!T2kt<wbr>Hl5jliz5vkPI1mjnzA<br><br>Enjoy, fuckers.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have you fucked your oni-chan yet?</br></br>  I've gotten this far, and want to ask: are the human soldiers ever shown putting up any kind of decent fight against even trash mobs like these?<br><br>The Berserk world even seems to have entered the pike-and-shot era - y'know, like in Warhammer. It would be pretty cool to see one pitched battle in which the coalition holds any ground on their own against the Kushan demons.</br></br>  <br>The Dark Souls OST honestly. Sakuraba's music is heavily uninspired as of late but listening while reading is quite fitting. For dramatic fights anyways. <br><br>Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin's theme makes me think of Casca's rape and Skull Knight. Skull Knight is so cool. Legitimately surprised me when he actually appeared multiple times and helped people out.</br></br></br>  <br> trash mobs <br>Pretty sure those are elite tropes with superhuman strength.</br></br>  Think of reading the manga again. Cant remember if 3rd of 4th time but anyways, which chapter should I start with? Thinking of skipping the "flashback" arcs.  <br>Dude you have to keep in mind that they have never ever laid eyes upon demons before, and suddenly there is a horde of them invading.<br>Noone thought it to be possible, they are probably all in shock seeing their enemies, unable to put up much of a fight due to moral.<br>Moral is extremly important in battles, keep reading, they put up a better fight in the later volumes.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are those weapons even</br>  <br>Yes</br>  For some reason I stopped reading Berserk last year around the part where Guts meets Farnese and Serpico. Now I want to pick it up again but I've pretty much forgotten most of the lore. What do  <br>bullshit</br>  <br>Yes. Griffith's human soldiers are competent and good at killing monsters.</br>  <br>What would you call them, relative to the other beasts?<br><br><br>Yes, it's to be expected in that situation. But I'd like to see what they could do when prepared for what's coming. <br><br><br>Alright, very good then. I assumed Miura would try to emphasize the hopelessness of the fight by continuing to make the regular soldiers fucking useless, but I'll take your word for it and expect some show of competence on humanity's part. <br><br><br>demonic duck cocks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>reread all of it</br>  <br>reread it, you lazy fuck.</br>  <br> expect some show of competence on humanity's part.  <br>Volumes 33-34.</br></br>  I wonder if Rakshas transforms next episode.  <br>I hope you read the DH version.</br>  <br>only band of the hawk humans can stand their ground</br>  <br> beeing a newfag <br>We all know its gonna be monthly for 2 or 3 months and then we will get hiatus again.  And about the upcoming chapters before a new hiatus? still on boat. </br></br>  <br>Nice.<br><br>Actually, I'm asking if they're able to mount some organized resistance on their own. It's not just that Griffith-sama comes to save them with apostles, right?<br><br><br>That's what I've got.<br><br><br>Well shit. I suppose that's enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it. And technically Berserk was biweekly.</br>  <br> It's not just that Griffith-sama comes to save them with apostles, right? <br>No, but this is a huge spoiler.</br></br>  So apart from femto, what is the purpose of the other godhands?<br><br>I mean what do they usually do? <br><br>Do they give a fuck about the world at all?</br></br></br></br>  <br>a little of both</br>  <br>They're similar to the chaos gods from warhammer.</br>  <br>Wasn't one of them spreading plagues?<br><br>Void is super big on causality, maybe he fights time travelers.</br></br></br>  someone explain falconia<br>I'm still trying to understand</br>  <br>Agents of chaos?<br>We honestly know next to nothing about them.<br>We know about the 'idea of suffering' or whatever it was called but the god hands exact role is unclear.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll get there myself, then. <br><br><br>Exactly what I wanted. Very good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>real life shitposters</br>  are there any people that actually hate Berserk?  <br>They are the executors of Idea's will. <br><br><br>When the worlds merged a fantasy city from old legends (the fabled Gaiseric city) appeared along with other fantasy creatures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Gaiseric's sunken city risen from the ground.</br>  <br>I do.</br>  Fucking rickert. It's been a while but rereading 337 is satisfying as fuck.  <br>Why?</br>  <br>it's too good.<br>the thought of me or the author dying before it's finished scares me, adn that makes me mad.</br></br>  I don't even remember some relatively important characters, who the hell is Jill?<br><br>I better just read Berserk again</br></br>  I don't want them to get off the boat. What will I joke about when they do?  <br>Well anon, I dont know if you believe in an afterlife or ghosts, but I take comfort in the possibility that if I die I can come back to haunt Miura and find out the ending myself.</br>  Who /boughtall37volumes/ here?  <br>Is there a way to do that without going broke?</br>  <br><br>Hope that they pull a HxH and sell the entire series for a reduced price.</br></br>  <br>My love for you is like a truck, berserker!</br>  <br>Of course, seems a bit harsh to not pay for it after so long reading it<br><br>By having a fucking job</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's the little kid in the fake elf arc. I forgot what it's called. <br><br> Doesn't really matter because she's dead. Stupid Jill, screams and shouts won't save you </br></br></br></br>  <br>Jets Comics or Dark Horse?</br>  <br>Dark horse as I don't into moon and it was the only one I could get hold of easily<br><br>I didn't fuck up did I?</br></br></br>  I get that fujos ship everything, but I dont see how anyone can ship Guts and Griffith. Even that splash fight by the well didn't give off homolust. Why is the writing so good?  <br><br>I agree about the writing. It's pretty rare to find a good manga with a grimdark theme that is not cringe-inducing.</br></br>  <br>Jerome (that random knight who fell in love with the prostitute) decapitated two of Mozgus' executioner angels IIRC. Also the new Band of the Hawk in general is pretty competent.</br>  <br>Having a water fight with your naked effeminate friend isn't gay though.</br>  <br>Where is the best place to buy them?</br>  <br>I don't like some smaller parts. I still think that all this troll rape was unnecessary. I love Ganishka, though.</br>  <br> the new Band of the Hawk <br><br>They're all Apostles, though. Maybe not Rakshas, but still.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Nah, there are a bunch of normal humans in it like Mule. They're actually good at killing trash mobs, it's only op shit like trolls/cockatrice that they need the apostles to save their asses.</br>  <br>Apostles are just a small part of Griffith's army.</br>  How is Serpico so good at fighting? I get that he trained with nobles and is good at using the terrain, but that doesn't really explain how he's stood toe to toe with Guts multiple times without getting destroyed.  <br>Working on it<br>never done this before<br>thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't he's just clever and uses strategy so he didn't get fucked instantly</br>  <br>Big dick Rickert is the man.</br>  hetfags BTFO yet again  ITT Overhated anime.<br><br>I'll start with the obvious.</br></br>  <br>Your're favorite anime.</br>  You're favourite  <br>I'm with you, OP; SAO is an unrivaled masterpiece</br>  Pupa<br>Green Green<br>Master of Martial Hearts<br>Mars of Destruction<br>Eiken<br>Mahou Sensou</br></br></br></br></br>  Shit thread so im just gonna start posting memes    <br> Your're favorite anime. <br> Your're <br><br>Your are?

I think the anime was needed to give her more life</br>  <br>But I've only watched the anime and I also hate her.</br>  <br>ha typical animefags mindset</br>  *sigh* As a Kanto person, I have to wait till Sunday.  <br><br>This is literally the first anime I've seen in years, I think the last one I watched was Nichijou</br></br>  <br>Nice floor.<br><br>Is it comfy?</br></br></br>  UMR HAI UMR HAI UMA JANAIYO UMARU  <br> implying <br>Bomber is literally the best.</br></br>  <br>What kind of creature is that?</br>  Am I only one who dont hate her?  <br>She's exactly like me and I hate myself.</br>  <br>I think she's super cute in both forms</br>  <br><br>ID on the doujins?</br></br>  <br> implying you're attractive, smart, popular, a great athlete and talented musician </br>  <br>How can anime characters be this retarded to drop the icre cream all the fucking time?</br>  <br>She's a brat but she's a loveable brat. I'd play games with her.</br>  <br>I wish this was a little longer webm and had the tsun moment after.</br>  That fucking OP is stuck in my head.  <br>Only on the most surface level.<br><br>It's like when you pull some tasty looking food out of the fridge only to find that it's gone all rotten and mouldy.<br><br>The only course of action is to put it in the trash.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, the staff behind Himouto is real good</br>  The first member of Umaru's yuri harem has almost arrived.  I'm guessing the people who don't hate her have never had to deal with a cuntish younger sibling.<br><br>In fact they probably are the cuntish younger sibling.</br></br>  <br> Nichijou <br>no wonder you're such a faggot</br></br>  <br>le edgy contrarian face</br>  <br>Only child desperately projecting in an attempt to connect with others detected.</br>  <br>If i had to project my sibling relationship to Himouto, than i am Bomber and she is Kirie.

She looks so cute.  Umaruun or Shubaphyyn?  Ebina a melon.   Friends <br><br>Thank the fucking gods she isn't actually a /u/shit.

Not that it helps much.</br></br></br>  Kirie is literally /a/non-kun when he wants to ask out a girl and some lucky day gets asked out himself.

For something that's twenty-five minutes long it only feels like ten, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.   Derp <br> Oh noes <br>Just, why?<br><br>At least Sylphyn is next episode. No amount of retarded translating can fuck that up for me.</br></br></br></br>  good episode.<br>new girl improved it.</br>  What are you guys on? Kirie is cute. If anything the first episode was lacking, especially for a first episode. It just painted Umaru in a bad light.  <br>This is some Ghibli shit</br>  <br> Just, why? <br>You can blame that on CR's normie translation. Better subs come in several days late if you're that desperate for quality.</br></br>  This was a good episode and I liked it.<br>I wonder just how fucked up chibi Umaru is though I thought she was supposed to be just like Umaru, but she passes as a younger sister?</br>  <br>You forget Sylphy wants to be UMR's wife.<br><br><br>I can definitely see more people dropping it as the show shifts in tone.<br><br><br>Kirie's retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   normie <br>is this a new epic maymay<br>you should go back to tumblr, they will embrace your uniqueness</br></br>  This show is pretty great.

I can really see how anyone can confuse her with a little sister.</br>  <br>She's   funny </br>  It felt like the TSF stuff didn't come this soon after Kirie's introduction in the manga. Am I just remembering incorrectly or are they moving stuff around to introduce the other girls sooner?<br><br> Not that I'm complaining, Sylphyn best girl. </br></br>  <br> Meaning scissoring rape tier. <br>Really? even if she doesn't win, that's a good reason for me to watch this.</br></br>  Looks like I misjudged the show. This is literally /v/: the 60fps animation. Still will watch it for Onii-sans love story though. I hope there will be one.  <br> doesn't like the OP <br><br>It's one of the best of the season, I never skip it. So catchy and unique compared to the others.

Better than Ebina shy boob fest.<br><br> Kirie reminded me when I died a social death in high school. I once joked about the school madonna being my girlfriend, and my "bestfriend" told her out of jealousy. The madonna yelled at my face for about 10 minutes at the school gate. Just for one silly joke I died a horrible death. Noone would talk to me and rumors would be told right in front of my face. My Umaru was this fat lard who loved gaming a bit too much, and I decided to fail graduation even when I was the top of my class because I've never had a friend stick with me on hard times.

Filthy crossboarder.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to smash her face in</br>     Episode 4 <br> Umaru and her Rival <br>It begins.</br></br>  <br>The better translation in that context would be Teacher or Sifu if for localized meme subs anyway.</br>  <br>Same reason that I always need to know how much yen converts to in Norwegian krone.</br>  <br>That's what Japan does, they have shit taste you know.</br>  <br><br><br> blue <br> 2015 </br></br></br></br>      I love her voice.  <br>It'd be nice if later on they'd cover some of the stuff they've skipped in the earlier episodes.</br>  <br>G REEN <br>I S<br>M Y<br>P EPPER</br></br></br></br>  umuru watns COLA  <br>I like that her eyes are drooly smiley faces</br>  <br> Puzzle and Waifus <br> normie game <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Next level art<br>Made by Pierrot</br></br>  Not even yuri can save a series with such an unlikable protagonists and one-note jokes.  So how's the hentai for this?<br><br> I want doujins of deformed Umaru to be exact. </br></br>  <br>Oh no... it's you!<br>Away, away!</br></br>  Who's ready for episode 3 of this season's obligatory battle academy harem LN adaptation? Airing in about 3 hours.   obligatory battle academy harem LN adaptation <br>Why do I have to be reminded about these</br>  Red a shit. A SHIT  Reminder that Misora is buttfuck material. (Like all tsun qts honestly.)  <br> whos ready to drop this series after the three episode rule <br><br>Man I didnt have any expectations for this show but I atleast though they'd play the traitor thing<br> out with some cool self-sacrificing backstory which resulted in the MC being shunned as his<br> actions were misunderstood. MC-kun would then be forced to walk his fated path alone <br>bearing the burden of his past, shunned by those around him.<br><br>Instead we just got some shitty "lol nope he just dropped out his team", seriously fuck this show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah the reason is pretty stupid but MC being based as fuck lets me get past this easily</br>  <br>Honestly what do you expect from light novels</br>  <br>Mind break dere transformation when?</br>  <br>Still better than Classroom Crisis.</br>  How long till it airs?  <br>The whole traitor thing is an excuse to have the MC be rejected by everyone and thus, a better self insert for the target audience</br>  This show makes me miss World Break, this is too pale in comparison.  <br>I dropped that. Is it still Ted Talks: The Anime?</br>  <br>Now I REMEMBER</br>  it's time for THK weekly thread  <br>How can a OP mc be rejected. He rejected them is more logical. How is OP mc needed other, They need him instead. He seens the strongest warrior in the dangerous teritory. You're not making any sense. Your hatred blinded you.</br>  5 mins<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  Blonde &gt; Black &gt; Red<br>No opinion on the other girls yet.<br>Normally I like tsunderes, but Red hasn't really shown any sort of unique personality or reasons to like her yet. Hopefully all of the girls will get better, her included, because so far none of them are really memorable.</br></br>  <br>Is there a stream?</br>  <br>What are you even saying? I don't even hate this, but it's a fact what the target audience for this kind of thing is and how it panders to them<br>It's been done in other similar shows before<br>You have an OP harem lead, who is rejected by everyone for being apparently useless or something (in this case, a traitor), but the truth is different, and MC-kun doesn't deserve the hate.</br></br></br>  <br>neetball</br>    <br>Many thanks!</br>          Why is the music for this series so unfitting?      <br>  enermius <br>So lists me all harem title that has similar setting like this one. Mr harem expertise?</br></br>    <br>  enermous <br>  have <br>Fck touchscreen.</br></br></br>        what a nerd    <br>Best fucking girl.</br>  red a shit     MC just whored her out all day   <br>But there was none like this during the spring</br>  I lost my shit at that ice cream man. That was just great.  <br>Such a pimp</br>        <br>My heart.</br>        muh shitty drama  <br>looks like the tip of a cock entering her mouth from below the screen</br>      <br>There is no battle yet? Not even an ecchi scene? Are we watching playing vn the animation now ?</br>  <br>Not enough budget for that much action. The opening scene of the first episode already drained a lot.</br>  Misora a shit. A SHIT.  <br>No u</br>  friendly reminder that target audience for this show is<br>kids going through puberty and not little girls that /a/ is generally occupied by.</br>  <br>Aw this post reeks so much of an anal devastation.</br>  <br>Muh obingo swordsman.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437584 <br>Senketsu has released the softsub for this series.</br>   that ice cream man <br>A true bro.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437584 <br><br> ayy lmao <br> 3DPD <br> movieshit <br><br><br><br><br>Fuck off summerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's actually shit &gt; every girl in the story</br>  <br>It's still Funi subs</br>  I quite like the red tsundere but the last part ruined a real comfy episode.  Why does she want to use the sword so badly?  <br>How fucking autistic are you to be bothered by a japanese girl low note crying?<br> Le comfy <br>You already know what to fix. You are living. Work hard to fix that by killing yourself</br></br></br>  <br>What is it with harems and them ruining episodes with shitty drama.</br>  <br>Damn, dude. Calm down. I just could have done without that part, that is all.<br><br>Not sure what provoked that aggressive response.</br></br></br>  <br> Honestly what do you expect from generic battle harem light novels <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Hyperbolistic claims bring about hyperbolistic responses</br>  Mangafags spoilers please. Why did red get so mad at being told to switch classes? Guessing it was something like muh sister was this type and died now I have to be this type.  <br>Yeah I was actually somewhat enjoying it until the end. MUH DRAMA. MUH SWORD. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY DEEP CHARACTER.<br><br>Misora a shit and just when I thought she got better this episode. Typical woman expecting everyone to just read her mind and know all her problems.</br></br></br>  Red made poor ice-cream man cry, unforgivable  <br><br><br>That was just too much. Ice-cream man and the ice-cream didn't deserve that ;_;</br></br></br>  MC's bro is going to get the blonde. Thats nice.  Hey.<br><br>HEY!<br><br>I like red.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I really liked her this episode up until the retarded last part.<br><br>Same with the blonde who I really didnt like before. She was cute as fuck this ep.</br></br></br>  Yuri a slut  Holy goooddd the red haired bitch again holy shiiiit she makes me so angry. How can a human being be such a fucking bitch <br> OH MY GOD I HAVE MY PROBLEMS  <br> OH MY GOD YOU DON'T KNOW MY PROBLEMS <br> OH MY GOD I HATE YOU <br>Well, looks like YOU DON'T HAVE A GOD YOU GODLESS PIECE OF SHIT FUCK OFFFFFFF</br></br></br></br>  Someone make a icecream webm  <br/>  <br>THK pls.</br>  <br>TLK pls.</br>    <br>Most touching moment of the series.<br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Despite typping like a faggot, he makes a fair point</br>  <br>What's technical name for that shitty effect?</br>  <br>Slow motion + motion blur.</br>  <br>I just say the Matrix.</br>  <br>I'm ready for more of best girl.</br>  <br>I thought she was going to turn out to be Claire 2.0 but she's surprisingly not that big of a bitch.</br>  <br>Yeah. As much of a shitty tsundere she is, she's leagues better than Claire.</br>  <br>I just made ice cream to honor his great service in the line of duty.<br><br>;_;7</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh piss off, THK. You already said that last time and the week before that. Claire and MIsora are both cute and good. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br> Claire is cute and good </br>  <br> Claire is cute and good </br>  <br><br>Fuck off THK.</br></br>  Blue &gt; Yellow &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Red  where is the narcissist girl? I like her the best.  <br><br>Stop samefagging. Your hate was always worthless and can never argue, THK. Claire is easily top 3 cutest and is a adorable tsundere that develops by warming up to the MC. She's also docile at times and easily succumbs to pressure, so she is more bark than her bite, and that makes her cuter considering the fact she behaves like a small animal who clings to the MC out of ownership that is affectionate and not overbearing.</br></br>  <br>Red &gt; Blue &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yellow</br>  Is she autistic?  Misora is the only reason I'm watching this crap show.  <br><br>I only posted b8 pic, but I'm not gonna bother with screenshoot because you'll just say "nice shoop"</br></br>  <br>Why is she so cute?<br><br><br>Mein nigga.</br></br></br></br>  Daily THK lore thread?  <br>What does THK stand for?</br>  So if I hate the red bitch I'm THK now?  <br>Turbo homosexuals konspiracy.</br>  How do I get into JoJo?  <br>Almost all cultures have had some form of contraception</br>  <br><br> Retconned <br><br>Do you have even a vague idea of what that means?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can only think of romans having the &lt;3 plant which they wiped out, then abstinence until condoms were invented</br>  <br>Well there you have it. <br><br><br>Part 5 manga explicitly states it's a mystery as to why and how Giorno's mom survived her encounter, so the same could be said of the other three. Hell, it's not even clear how Giorno got that picture of Dio he has, or if Dio was aware of the fact he'd knocked some women up.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thank you. I can't believe how many plebs on this fucking thread don't understand how Rolling Stone is why Bruno survived. No wonder they don't like Part 5. They didn't even understand the fucking ending.</br></br>   [HorribleSubs] Ore Monogatari!! - 16 [720p].mkv <br>haha time for NTR</br>  <br>This show is garbage, you need to be retarded to actually enjoy It.</br>  <br><br>Go fuck yourself cancer this shit shouldn't have threads here.<br/></br></br>  <br> m-monogatari, please, you're going to make Takeo dirty <br>Not at all. Unlike some other "monogatari" protagonist, Taleo is clearly in a relationship with someone, not in the middle of a harem of girls.</br></br>  <br>I really enjoy it only there is not much to talk about but its very good.</br>  <br> SAIJOU IS SO FUCKING CUTE </br>  The results from last season are in, and it turns out you're favourite anime is shit.<br><br>Also nobody likes Ninja Slayer.</br></br>  <br>They upload raws (rarely) and download subs.</br>  <br>really? I use Leopard Raws sometimes and don't see a notable difference.</br>  <br>You might want to invest in eye surgery.</br>  <br>point is they care.</br>  Overall downloads means nothing, change in weekly downloads between consecutive episodes and between the first and last episodes is what matters.<br><br> Not that it matters, Danmachi wrecked the shit out of everything by both metrics </br></br>  Mountainous seams are over.  <br>Don't bully the tengu.</br>  <br>I have an urge to rape everytime I see her</br>  So, S3 never? How did it do, sales-wise? Be it BDs or goodies.  I did my part   <br> How did it do, sales-wise <br>Absolutely average.</br></br>  <br>This picture will probably be better if it's F/8 instead of F/2</br></blockquote>]
