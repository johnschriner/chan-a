What is this anime ever about.  <br>We need figures. One good thing about an anime adaptation. You get figures produced.</br>  <br> figures <br>I would take a Nendo or two just for adorable Skeleton and Crazytits.</br></br>  What's she gonna use it for? I'm not really using it, but...  <br>http://bato.to/read/_/314789/overlo<wbr>rd_ch5_by_ak-scanlations/20</wbr></br>  <br>this and i would buy best maid too</br>  <br>inb4 Pleiades collection babyyyy</br>  <br>It was worse in the manga version.

All the way till 5 years old.” </br></br></br>  <br> square <br>are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Yeah the descriptions were awesome, i thought the studio would do them justice<br><br>They just CGI'd the manga DK and it looked plastic as fuck<br><br>They could at least improve the textures</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you even tell from that? But square milk jugs save space when putting a bunch of them in a crate.</br>  Is it bad that I dropped overlord first episode in because of the whole stupid dive MMO plot?   wasting a 5th and 9th level spell slot on 3HD City Guard instead of using Color Spray to down both. <br><br>Ains can not into Wizard powergaming. I guess it doesn't really matter when you can craft Pearls of Power.</br></br>  <br>Unless you absolutely despise that sort of story and can't enjoy it whatsoever, yes. Should have watched the first episode entirely before making a decision at the minimum.</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>"wasting"<br><br>He could probably cast that spell all day without his mana going down</br></br></br>  <br>Considering how overused it is recently, I wouldn't call you stupid for doing so.<br><br>However it seems like it may simply serve as a launching point. Whether where it ends up going is actually any good remains to be seen. It's honestly moving kind of slow.</br></br></br>  <br>FAKE<br>TITS</br></br>  <br>Or he could just retreat to his Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion and rest.</br>  <br>I did watch the first episode in it's entirety before making the decision to drop it due to the dive MMO. <br><br><br>Eh, I might read the manga and decide if I wanna go further with the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lowest level Maid <br> could still fuck up anyone she sees <br>a true Sniper with an actual gun is an OCP for a medieval culture</br></br></br>  <br>You should consider reading 2 volumes of the novel and decide after that. The manga really doesn't do justice to overlord.</br>  <br>Wow, Funi's 720p is even worse than I thought.</br>  <br><br><br>He's level 100. He doesn't even need to waste a spell slot when a wack from the Skeltal Staff would autohit on a 1.</br></br></br>   all these people saying they dropped it because it's another "mmo anime" <br>it's getting to the point where i cant figure out who's baiting and who is just taking second hand information to heart</br>  <br><br>He's got what, like fifteen minutes of straight casting 9th/10th level spells until he runs out of mana for the day? Might as well just cast Ray of Enfeeblement a few times and whack them with his staff.</br></br>   What will madhouse do to vomit-chan when she vomits? <br>I may discover my new fetish</br>  <br> Using the motherfucking guild staff to whack shit <br><br>Are you crazy?</br></br></br>  <br> hoarding almost 800 spells and not having room for a ass ripping attack <br>The fuck's wrong with you? Grasp Heart is hardly a waste.</br></br>  <br>No, just boneheaded</br>  Episode 3 saved this series for me.  <br>That's a good thing. Flat is best for vampire loli.</br>  <br>I'd give her my D that's for sure</br>  <br>First he had to use his good instant death spell because he didn't know how NPCs worked. Some random knight could be a level 100 warrior for all he knew.<br><br>Then he picked a level 5 spell, which I agree was still too high, but Ainz is obviously risk averse.</br></br></br>  <br>He had no way of figuring out how strong they were excepting by trying to see what killed them.</br>  <br>No, I don't want our souls to let go.</br>  Grasp Heart is a Save or Die, and a Save and suck.<br>you fail the save and instantly die, but you pass and you take massive damage and are stunned.<br>there's a reason that it's Ainz favorite spell.</br></br>  <br>I want to commit a cirme.</br>  Didn't albedo have a sister?<br><br>I'm talking about the "real"most powerful guardian.<br>The Secret guardian and the MC's personal bodyguard<br><br>You know the one all the other guardians are terrified of</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck this is amazing.<br>This is literally the greatest power fantasy that I've ever experienced.<br>WORSHIP ME</br></br>  <br>Albedo a cute.<br><br>I'm an animefag but want more, is the manga or light novel better?</br></br></br>  <br> sullying the guild staff </br>  <br> rocks a sexy practical armor <br>That's Anime original, her actual armour is extremely bulky and completely conceals her figure.<br><br><br>This studio really keeps letting us down with the adaptation. I mean where was the fear in the faces of the sisters and villages. They were suppose to be literally cowering, while pissing themselves. There faces barely had any expressions.</br></br></br></br></br>  I heard something about martial users what are those?   Albedo's sexy armor that's completely covering her <br>That was nice. REALLY nice.</br>  <br>Guilds only have 700 character levels to make their guardians with, so everybody's pretty much accounted for.</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>But people are not terrified of her because she is strong, but because she was made as a horror. Like, horror movie-kind horror.<br>Momonga says he freaked out first time he saw her.</br></br></br>  <br>Mang, the LN made my imagination go full throttle.<br>I didn't sleep for 2 days just because I enjoyed it that much.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, except Finger of Death is a Fort save. Most SoD or SoS spells are Fort saves which is bad as Fort is usually the highest save a monster will have. Leave the damage dealing to the gish and dumb meatshield.</br>  <br>Basically melee skills.</br>    <br>If you enjoy the anime you will likely enjoy the LNs too. They're very close to the anime but LNs have some more details.</br>  <br>Yeah basically <br>you'll see next episode I'm sure.</br></br>  <br>Rubedo and Nigredo are different characters</br>  <br>MC's personal bodyguard?<br>I don't remember that</br></br>  <br>They're supposedly something that didn't exist in the game. If you're reading 'The New Gate', you can liken it to the 'Arts' from the series. Also martial arts don't use mana they use something else. Ainz is curious about them but they're pointlessly weak.</br>  That knight scene was more brutal than I was expecting from this kind of anime  <br>What kind of anime were you expecting?</br>  <br>Not genuine.</br>  <br>She has 2 sisters, the one with sensory magic that's kept in the prison area on the ice level and the other which hasn't properly been introduced only mentioned. Neither are the most powerful or anything like that. <br>MC doesn't have a personal bodyguard, he has the Guardians and the Maids (Unless you count NPCs he created but PA isn't really a combatant).</br></br>  <br>Most anime kind of cut away at the critical moments, you know? But I guess these guys are hardcore.</br>  <br>Turns out nips hate money Jews<br>Who knew</br></br>  <br>It was toned down compared to the LN, it was done from the Knights perspective and they were seriously scared shitless (The gore and the fact they couldn't even hurt it wasn't the only scary things, everyone killed with the sword becomes a zombie and starts attacking as well). The studio sucks at expressions as well either that or they're trying to make it teen-friendly.</br>  <br><br> Sucks  that she's  dead  hopefully they  bring  her  back .</br></br>  <br>Don't tax evade anon.</br>  <br>Isn't rubedo supposed to be the strongest?</br>  <br><br>Thanks guys, reading the prologue now. Going to try the first part of vol1 ch1 tonight before bed. Cant wait to get off.</br></br>  <br><br>So he is building a country full of these guys?<br>Or at least a country where these techniques are actively taught?</br></br></br>  <br>nah. Albedo is a bit too rapey. But once Aura Bella Fiora, the reverse trap dark elf girl, grows up,she would be worth siring an heir with.</br>  <br>Read volume 1 of the light novels after seeing the first 2 episodes. Thia shit is fucking golden.</br>  <br><br>Well the author certainly gave her death. It's a pity I really liked her rivalry with Albedo. Anyone know if she was brought back after all?</br></br>  <br>She's already 76 though.<br><br>When does puberty happen</br></br></br>  <br>chair forever.</br>  <br>She's 7-8 in relative human terms so maybe another 30-40 years.</br>  <br>Martial Arts did not exist in the game, they only exist in the new world, Nazarick residents have no idea what they are or how they work. Ainz ordered some people to capture martial art users and wants them studied/researched. He wants to see if the arts can increase Nazaricks strength. But basically the arts and their users are too weak by Nazarick standards to have any real value.</br>  <br>Clarify I have no fucking idea what that means.</br>  Reminder that in Japan, Bitch = Slut so in universe canonically Albedo would probably have been polishing everyone's spears.  I heard there's a regular demon lord in this world.<br>If he were to be compared to the Guardians what level would he be? And does he swear loyalty to the overlord?</br>  <br><br> she dislikes humans </br></br>  <br>you wouldnt need to remind anyone if they stopped watching horribly translated funi rips</br>  <br>So what you read part way through volume three then just stopped? Finish it off then you'll have your answer.<br> Ainz can freely revive people (via consumable item (which he has a hundred or more of)) and Nazarick members (Nazarick revival system, cost shitloads of gold). There's also probably revival magic as well.  </br></br>  <br>humans are nothing more than skeletons in hiding</br>  <br>Ainz sits on her, how can you not understand that?</br>  <br><br>You caught me, I literally just finished that chapter before I posted &gt;&gt;  I'll finish the volume tonite.</br></br>   You will never slay these monsters and their eldritch master.     <br> Ainz sits on her, how can you not understand that? <br>Dude how can I? There was no context unless it's a new thing which just means I've been neglecting /a/ a little too much.</br></br>  <br>Who the heck is Rubedo? She's never even mentioned from vol 1-5.</br>  <br>The majority of Nazarick residents dislike/hate/despise or otherwise look down on humans. There's probably multiple factors that contributed to it; their races (except for elf twins none are human or demi-human), Guild rule that only heteromorphic races can join, evil alignment, character setting and finally the fact that while it was still a game humans/demi-humans are probably the main groups that attacked the guild (and died doing so). Anyway they have every right to look down on them, in-game human/demi-humans had inferior stats to heteromorphic races and the guild was a top-tier guild that had one of the best players as a member (Touch Me is a world class player).</br>  <br>in Vol 7 I think</br>  <br> Touch Me is a world class player <br>That name never fails to crack me up. It's as juvenile as a Gnome named Parts with the Private title.</br></br>  <br>Becoming a chair normally results in being sat on. Get up to date with the latest LN translations. Also lurk more, fanart of the exact scene has been posted multiple times.<br><br><br>She did though, although it was brief and her name wasn't said she was only referred to. Re-read Albedo's conversation with her sister in volume three.</br></br></br></br>  Animefag here, did Ainz develop one of the guardians?  <br>Yes, but he hasn't been introduced yet.</br>  <br>Pandora's Actor, the Doppelnazi</br>  <br>Touch Me has a wife daughter and is a collage prof. on top of being the world champion for the Melee classes and all around good guy.</br>  does papa bones ever meet a worthy foe?  How competent is the TL for the Overlord manga? Because /ak/'s editing sure as hell isn't any good.  <br>At the end of this season. Then it'll be a while again.</br>  I wouldn't because she hates lower life forms and will obliterate my ass for just looking at her  <br>  Successful in life <br>  OP as fuck in game <br>Can he be more based ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  Is there an epub or pdf version floating around for volumes 3-5? Did a cursory Google search and didn't find any results.  <br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Pandora%27s_Actor<br><br><br>Yes.  Shalltear <br>Aside from that there are yet to be encountered (as of the translated volumes) strong characters (dragon lords and stuff) and the chance of meeting other players or NPCs in future.<br><br><br>It's fine. But if you haven't read the LN first then start with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Is there a group that's still taking the subs and muxing them into rips that aren't Funi garbage?  What race was Touch Me? I know he was Inhuman but was he an elf or something?  <br>I'm guessing you're referring to Spinel, Albedo's little sister? Where did the name Rubedo come from?</br>  <br><br>that name gets funnier the more i see it</br></br>  <br> pointlessly weak <br> bitch is over 50 levels lower than you <br> you are as strong as Kid Captain in melee <br> Kid Captain can tank crazy mode Shalltear no problem despite being vastly outleveled <br> Skill can tank any physical hit you dish out so long as she uses her block skill first <br><br>It's amazing. Martial Arts is the one thing that will allow Certain Death and future Brain to fuck with Nazarick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here; https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br><br>Does someone want to make an OP template, so we can reduce the repeated questions every thread?<br><br><br>My mistake. Just look at the wiki, moonfags have been working on it<br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Rubedo</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I didn't even think to check Mega actually. Knew I should have instead of /r/'ing.</br>  <br>Source on the college prof part.</br>  <br>The Demon God they'll talk about later is on par or weaker than a level 7 summoned angel. Which means it's leagues below Ainz level. Of course this all assumes Nigan knows what the hell he's talking about.</br>  <br>That's super dangerous, to ever trust Nigan's words. That retard thinks a WC item is worth less than his dumb angel.</br>  <br>I don't think its ever said what race he is. Some assume it's the same race as Sebas, namely a dragonoid.</br>    <br>your hours late ;_;</br>  <br> thatsthejoke.gif </br>  <br>must have been one of this threads as I can no longer find it.<br>that said World Break: Attacks target by slashing the space. This skill is superior to the 10th Rank Magic, "Reality Slash".</br></br>  so we all agree that this is aots right  <br>No, it's a poorly done adaptation that does not do the source material justice. Of coarse it could be much worse (See the Manga), but it could still be many times better as well.</br>  Is that Planescape: the Anime?  <br>whats wrong with it? for a guy that hasn't read the source material i thought it was pretty damn well done.</br>  <br>If you truly enjoy it, I strongly suggest you just read the LN. Then you'll understand the disappointment.</br>  <br>No since Ains never updates his journal</br>  <br><br><br>dont listen to LNfag, they will shit anime any adaptation because normalfag cant into moonrunes</br></br></br>  Anyone made a webm of Papa Bones appearing in the portal and squashing hearts?  <br>I don't see where he says it's more valuable, just that it was his "sure kill" trump card that few people knew about. Of course I would still be very careful about taking Nigan's assessment too seriously.<br><br>Also I was wrong here .<br>The Dominion of Authority can cast up to7th level magic, I don't know what level summon it is.</br></br></br></br>  Audio Drama Tracks 9 &amp; 10 released<br>Get it from Imoutlicious's blog (Can't like cause of link spam filter)</br>  <br>About half the novel is translated so far, so it's not like you can't read it yourself.</br>  <br> What can change the nature of a man? <br> Becoming a lich apparently. </br></br>  <br>It's mentioned when he brings up the 3 most important treasures of the Theocracy.<br><br> 1. The relic of the 8 greed kings <br> 2. The magic tool of the dragon king/lord <br> 3. The crystal left behind by the 6 gods <br><br>That he doesn't include the WC item despite knowing it's name either means the robe belonged to the 8 kings, but would make the author a poor writer because there's no need to imply they may be separate items, or that Nigan is an idiot which is the most likely outcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THAT'S A NICE HEAD YOU HAVE ON YOUR SHOULDERS  <br>Narberal can cast 7th level spells and she's 63</br>  <br>Where does he   Keep his phylactery  </br>  <br>She can cast up to the 8th tier though, so that angel is definitely not her level.</br>  <br>maybe he outgrew the need for a phylactery when he ranked up to overlord from Elder Lich</br>  Any webm for the death knight butchering scene ?  <br>I was trying to set an upper limit, so less than 60 and more than 40</br>  <br>So is anyone else trapped in game?<br>Baka Tsuki isn't showing any sign yet.</br></br>  <br>When did she cast 8th tier magic? I don't think she used any vs the dragons.</br>    <br>She flat out says so to Khajit I believe when she mocks him.</br>  <br>  In Web Novel Version, 7 magic caster class level is needed to master 1 rank magic. <br>so 49 caster levels if that carries over to the novel</br></br>    <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>He keeps the phylactery outside of his Doom Fort. It is located in an obvious location and an ordinary item, say a horseshoe.

While we do know Bewitching Calamity is ridiculously powerful, maybe those three other items are just in another league. Heck, maybe those three are apart of the "Twenty".</br>  <br>Those people probably playing SAO III instead of Yggdrasil.</br>  <br>[ayy] but they wait for thursday's bs11 raw so it'll always be slightly behind, usually fri/sat.</br>  <br>The guild didn't allow neets.

You did it right this time.</br>  <br> Leave the damage dealing to the gish and dumb meatshield. <br>Were there even prestige classes in the game?</br></br>  <br>This?

The guy who left the group just pointed the obvious thing.<br><br>Also this is not the first time, FwPA got owned really hard by 7seas when they posted sumaries instead of translations. The second one was time ago when some anon do their job with better quality in 3 hours and they took 3 months for a single chapter. <br><br><br>NO, NEVER.

Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>Okay, but don't blame us when your legs fall off</br>  <br>Are the tripfags that translated those still around? Back then, we could only have monster girl threads on /d/.</br>  <br>Wild Horses.<br>Duh.</br></br>  <br> /jay pee/ has better threads though, but the guys are total assholes. </br>  God damn I thought I was watching this for cute monster girls.<br><br>Why do Smith's day off clothes have to be the best?</br></br>   Darling's eyes are two white circles 90% of the time in the anime <br><br>I could have sworn he only made that face 50% in the manga.</br></br>   FLUFFY CLOACA   <br>Nope, Monster Musume threads needs another division between mangafags and secondaries. So with this the retarded secondaries get BTFO from here and let them stay on Jitsu threads.</br>  <br> not Wyld Stallyns </br>  <br>If a true oldfag is anywhere as fucking insufferable as you I'll take the fucking secondaries any day.</br>  <br>A Horse With No Name came immediately to mind, but  is better.</br>  <br> 1019x569 </br>  <br>At this rate, one or both sides will be driven away to live with their retarded ancestors on /jp/</br>  <br>I'd get fit for Polt. As long as I get to fondle her 6 nipples</br>  <br> 10 nipples is too many. </br>  <br>Keep crying secondary, go back to your GATE thread.</br>  <br>Well, it says she can smell when you've had a sufficient workout, I would hope that she wouldn't push you too hard beyond what you're capable of handling. <br><br><br> Rub her belly like a dog <br> She kicks her leg and gets turned on at the same time </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure you can handle it, anon?</br>  <br>That's retarded though. Especially considering we're all fucking secondaries anyway, except TF and maybe a few others, since we're all only reading the English adaptations and not the original manga.</br>  <br>Really? I feel like he has that face more in the manga than in the anime. I was actually kinda weirded out by how serious he looked so much of the time.</br>  <br><br>I will die trying. I think.</br></br>  You guys have been busy. Finally caught up the three or four threads since I went to bed 10 hours ago. Pleased with the amount of posting though.

You're right. Maybe just how they're represented in the anime is throwing me off. Doesn't translate well into animation.</br>  <br>Step 1: hit alt-I in MPC-HC<br><br>That's it.</br></br></br>  <br> Same pasta of the last thread <br><br>C´mon, can you do a better job than that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I walk about 15kms a day on average at work, I had to do 12 hours one knight and managed to do 20kms, my legs and feet were fucking sore. I think a 42km walk would kill me. I don't know if Polt actually walks on her "walks", but a 42km walk isn't really something you can do in a couple hours.</br></br>  I'm going to post about my opinion of Miia being best girl, and you can't stop me.  Even /jp/ is better than this. <br><br> inb4 gtfo2/jp/ or some varient </br></br>  <br> Not having any argument  <br> Better complain about an ESL <br><br>SECONDARY DETECTED.</br></br></br></br>  Thanks Cerea, now I have a centaur fetish  <br>Suzu a qt</br>  <br/>  <br> you will never become a cripple trying to keep up with Polt everyday <br> she will never take you out on her "walks" anyways while rolling you in your wheelchair because she still wants to spend time with you </br></br>  <br> still no chapter 6 </br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/732543/9f77d0<wbr>22d4/<br><br>This should break you of that pretty quickly.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Y'know, I was never fond of the kimono pic for some reason. Always seemed a bit off.<br><br>Then again, it could be related to that god-awful tattoo...</br></br></br>  <br>since the beginning, retard<br><br>even check the archive and the filename for the thread<br><br>kindly stop, while I agree secondaries should read the source material too, acting like a fucking autistic sperglord about it will get you fucking nowhere</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More papi please</br>  <br>Soon. They were type setting when I left.</br>  <br>Didn't even need to trample.

After all, she's the only one with real legs. Surely it's going to drive MC nuts eventually, especially if there's a bathing/shower seen or something with her.</br></br>  <br><br>At this point, I'm starting to think this is just shitposting from a dude who wants both /jp/ and /a/ threads gone.</br></br>  <br> centaur men fucking for longer than a few seconds at best <br><br>It's like this person doesn't know anything about horses.</br></br></br>  <br> Samepasta  <br> Samefagging trying to fit <br><br> a few post before the thread dies, there is your contribution retard, now fuck off secondary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it looks fine.</br>  <br>She'd never let you cripple yourself. As a fitness expert, she'd consider herself a terrible spotter if she allowed her 'training partner' to cripple himself just so he could keep at her pace.</br>  <br>Thanks for the update Hound.</br>  There is a severe lack of best monster girl here.

You are right on some points, she is capable with vegetarian dishes and her love for her master is top quality, but Rachnera has qualities I think are just above Cerea<br><br>Rachnera may act cold and distant, but it is only due to her previous encounters with human beings. She was feared by her previous host family and she made a mistake and accidentally injured her previous hosts that haunts her. She was then sold off to a money grubbing pervert that treated her like a low-class worker. In several chapters we have seen that Rachnera wants to love and be loved, she yerns to be wanted and accepted by the people around her, but her ghosts of the past hold her back. You can really see Rachnera;s loving side in chapters that focus on her. You can clearly see Rachnera is most in tune with her emotions, she is the only one who has never harmed Kimihito...ever!<br><br>Rachnera may be a capable cook, it has never bee shown if she can or not. I agree that Cerea can make veggie dishes, but lets not count out Rachnera's potential cooking ability just yet. <br><br>Rachnera's figure is also similar to Cerea's. As a large Monster girl, her breasts can rival Cerea's and unlike Cerea where reproduction must occur quite a bit always from her human half (thus being unable to do anything like kiss and grope her breasts when having intercourse with Cerea), Rachnera's Reproductive organs are on the human half. Additionally, her cuddle potential is right up there with Miia as top quality.<br><br>all of them have their good points, but Rachnera's alluring body, cuddle potential, hidden yet deeply caring nature and overall usage (thread, fishing, hammocks ect) makes her the top percentage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever it was, it sure as hell looks better than what Smith drew.<br><br>Now that is the stuff of nightmares.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw tablet died as I was trying to draw <br><br>Have a really shitty representation of what I was going to draw</br></br></br>  <br>She got pretty flustered when her chuuni antics got out of hand.</br>  <br>Alright, that got me to crack a cackle.</br>  <br><br>I am pretty sure Miia drew the best waifu.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but it would be very cute.

And will there ever going to be s2?</br></br>  bad sales, nope.  <br>Buy the discs</br>    <br>we can dream</br>  <br><br><br>At least it had best illustration of best girls.</br></br></br>  Surprisingly entertaining  dess dess   An Etotama thread !  I didn't really get it but at the same time I felt that I didn't really need to.  <br>I want to plow the snake girl.</br>  I enjoyed it, but being NEET I can't afford the discs, and the sales were awful, so there's pretty much no chance at S2.<br><br>Cow and sheep a best</br></br>  <br>AOTS but sales were awful so S2 never.</br>  <br>Main girl wasn't busty, so sales were doomed.</br>  <br>More like 11s have shit taste and don't buy non-ecchi comedy.</br>  <br>If she had 3 cup larger tits, it would have generated at least twice the sales still.</br>  Reminder that there will be a Nya-Tan Nendo.  <br>Etotama is an unknown franchise that nobody in Nippon really knows about, and the sales strategy of releasing the BDs so early ensured that Etotama was going to be a flop sales-wise right from the beginning. Anybody with half a brain knew this was going to happen, because it was mentioned right in the first Etotama-thread. <br><br> Anonymous Fri 10 Apr 2015 06:30:45 &gt;No.123806754  <br> &gt;***,908位/***,868位 (***,138 pt) [*2予約] 15/04/15 えとたま 壱 [Blu-ray] <br> &gt;release next week <br><br> Rip sales </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Full BD dance when  <br>Tomorrow at the earliest, as the last volume is being released now. Then wait for some kind anon or 2chaner to rip it from the BD and upload it on youtube or NicoNico.</br>  <br>There's a Nya-tan dakimakura too.<br>Also some t-shirts of laboratory Rat.</br></br>  <br> will there ever going to be s2 <br>Haha  ;_; </br></br>  <br>I want to commit a crime</br>  <br>No, you need to buy the BDs anon!</br>  <br>Anons are really smart sometimes.</br>    The bests.  You'll never lay on hands on these ETM goods.  Only twenty people remembers Etotama.  <br>Fun show, nice CG.<br><br>God awful sales, S2 never.</br></br></br>  Dumb ass cat    <br>21, but I'm a lurker.<br>23 if you count the people I watched it with.<br><br>That's still not a lot.<br>I want to eat at an eto shin café.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Add one more to that.</br>    <br>I'm sure a max of 50 people remember. That's counting lurkers and people that will just pass by or miss the thread.<br><br>Any news on manga translations?</br></br></br>  Etotama and Pleiades made last season bearable  4me    I miss the cgi of this show.  <br>The cgi was very well done.</br>  <br>AOTS for me</br>  <br>There are a bunch of reasons why Etotama failed, but a big one was that the only way to know what sort of show Etotama was was to watch it. The description and first episode seemed like generic battle harem bullshit.</br>  <br>Fuckin' loved it. Need more. OVAs weren't enough to satisfy me.</br>  <br>Oh god, all my yes.</br>  <br> actually has good CG <br> legitimately entertaining <br> no sales <br>God I fucking hate the Elevens' taste so much.</br></br></br></br>  <br> doujins never <br>I never been this furious in all my life, I would kill my family and go find a job for it.</br></br>  I liked it. I don't know what else to say.   Show flops <br> Years later Etotama's status in Japan changes into "fun anime, probably the first to incorporate actually good CG for a 1-cour series" <br> Sparks discussion on why the show flopped so hard <br> Interest begins to rise <br> Anime now a "vintage anime" 20 years in the future <br> People start collecting the rare merch and the limited BDs slowly running out <br><br> "Woah anon-kun, is that all the BDs for Etotama?" <br> "Yeah, it's highly revered as the benchmark for 3D at its time, probably a huge stepping stone for the 3D anime we have today" <br> "those are super rare, man, that's cool" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was okay. Good girls, fun CG fights, but still felt like wasted potential.  Had Etotama been made into a fighting game what would each character's big-kanji special finishing moves be? Aside from Nya-tan, Mo-tan, and Chu-tan that is.  <br>I fucking wish.</br>  It's great fun, I like it. Make me want to commit a crime most of the time aswell.  <br>Good tastes.</br>  <br><br>BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY</br></br>  Rabbit?

It is kind of scary to be honest.<br><br>Q: Does Madoka like her back?<br>Urobuchi: Madoka never loved Homura. From the beginning is was just Homura's obsession. It's that kind of tragedy of never being cared for that makes you evil. In this case, Homura is evil because no one has ever loved her or ever will.<br><br>Q: That sounds horrible! (laughs)<br>Urobuchi: Some people deserve loneliness. I think Homura is one of those people. (laughs)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kyubey a shit.

As ther series goes on, strange things will happen but quickly the show would revert back to max cozy. Evantually like always homu would find the truth of this fake reality. It is actually a labyrinth to seal her god tier powers away in a harmless state called moemura, along with the other magicas. Sort of like the fake city from rebellion but on a much larger universal scale. As the world falls apart and all hope is lost the last ep finnaly reveals madoka magica s2, with a new evil that the magicas and devil homu mast put aside their differences to face. Just imagine a hidamari tier cozy sol turning all dark at the end.

You can get either of those second-hand for cheaper than $50 now. It'd probably cost more for both games than it would a console to play them on.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit wait, Geji-Nee in C;H? The same one from R;N? I vaguely remember reading something about Geji-Nee, but it didn't seem all that important.</br></br>  <br>Are you unable to read the picutere?<br>Silverfish-sis -&gt; Geji-nee.<br><br>It was all planned from the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Silverfish-sis", as seen in that anon's screencap, is a mistranslation of "Geji-nee".</br>  <br>Onoe naked in fetal position is something I need more of.<br><br><br>I wonder, how long will it take for Chaos;Child to get as much attention as Steins;Gate?<br>Or will it be forgotten like Chaos;Head?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some threads ago someone hint about di-swords' form factor.<br>Could they assume another form that is not a sword?<br>As I know, without having played C;C, is a result of an accelerated biorythm, usually originated from really bad situations and a sword is a form to hurt</br></br></br>  <br><br> It was all planned from the start. <br><br>For what purpose? Or does C;C explain it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you think smelled like an ARG?</br>  <br>Well, Rimi's Di-Swords look like an angel's wings.<br><br>So there might be some variation but it will always form a sword.<br><br> For what purpose? <br> To make money for 5pb. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaos;Head anime is still loved by casuals who know no different, and was pretty big for a while after it aired. Hopefully, Noah's official release will revive its brief popularity, thus shining light on C;C.</br>  <br><br>I wasn't aware that they could have other forms in the first place. Is that a fact or just speculation?</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but it's speculation, every Di-Sword we have seen thus far was, well, a sword.<br><br>With the exception of Rimi's, whose sword look like an angel's wings, as described by Taku.<br><br>He describes each sword in detail, and you can guess a lot of the character by the description of the sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just speculation.<br>If one can violently change biorythm by other means than torture, mental stress, trauma.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I figured that much. If Di-Swords are direct projections of the subconscious, then they'd reflect the wielder. I just wasn't really sure how much I could pull from the sword designs. Take Taku's for example, it could mean anything from being 1 dimensional and focused to not having any embellishments. Designed for a single purpose maybe?</br></br>  <br>It's unimportant now. Just a misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Imagine a Gigalomaniac, who is sexually aroused to the max, about to fuck his girlfriend, unable to find a condom.<br>In his excited and aroused state of mind, he sees something at the edge of his vision.<br>He tries to grab it, and pulls out a  Dirac-Condom .</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what I should think about his straight and long Di-Sword.<br>I really have no idea what it could possibly mean, yet I'd like to think that it's the simplicity that makes it the best.<br>Maybe I can agree on your "single purpose" statement.</br></br></br>  Time travel exists, in that time dilation exists due to excess of gravity. Unfortunately you can't go back (from our current understanding of physics) but only forward from the present, you just age at a slower rate in the form of seconds to minutes.  <br> not   Dira-Condom </br>  <br><br>It's a sad limitation. What about light from stars and that sort of thing? Aren't they reaching us from the past?</br></br>  <br>Di-Sword is short for Dirac-Sword.<br>So, it should be  Di-Condom. </br></br>  <br><br>You're speaking of the Doppler effect. It's a good read, I suggest checking out the wiki page for if. It's technically not a form of time travel, just radial perspective as we move from the relative source.</br></br>  Anime onlyfag here. Hated Chaos;Head but loved Steins;Gate. Should I watch Robotic;Notes and wait for Chaos;Child anime?  <br>Chaos;Head anime was horseshit. Read the VN.</br>  <br>You should forget everything you know about Chaos;Head, then read the VN, hell read the VN either way.</br>  <br><br>You mean this?</br></br>  <br>Animeonlyfag reporting in.<br><br>R;N started off pretty good but it slipped up near the end. It won't be nearly as good as S;G but it might still be entertaining for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed here, Chaos;Head's VN was a wild ride.</br>    <br><br>I thought the Doppler effect was related to sound? Or is it for anything wave based?</br></br>  <br><br>Please for your own sake read the VN. The anime adaptation of C;H is awful. The R;N anime was mediocre. Not great, but it ties some things together for Sci;Adv later on in the future so it's good to know about.</br></br>  <br>I think he means the name of a book</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppl<wbr>er_effect<br><br>Pretty sure it's this.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> giant Upa <br>Mayuri must be behind this.</br></br>  I fucking swear S;G fans have got to be even more autistic than any long running shounen. Fact  <br>How?<br>Purely talking about on 4chan of course, almost all anime fans anywhere else are autismo maximi.</br></br>  <br>how mad do you have to be to post this</br>  <br>Welcome to the sciADV thread, shiposter-kun!<br>Now get the fuck out</br></br>   I'd get infected if it meant living in bliss forever, who wouldn't?     <br>Shit, meant to quote </br>  <br><br>At least this roleplaying feels nostalgic</br></br>  I don't even like Rimi, but that goofy-ass smile she has here melts my heart.  <br>He knew what an IBM 5100 was used for before really anyone else did I think<br>But other than that his predictions were wrong, unless, by telling us what was going to happen he prevented the events he said were going to take place.<br>Who knows, its probably all bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>I love Rimi, she is the best girl.</br>  <br>Yeah, definitely watch Robotics;Notes. Just don't expect anything as amazing as Steins;Gate, but in the end you should enjoy it anyway.</br>  <br>Would you fuck Rimi? If so, how? This is a very important question pertaining to how much you really love her.</br>  <br> fucking your waifu <br>This has to be a trick question.</br></br>  <br>Of course the only way to fuck Rimi is to   give her a good tender hand holding.  </br>  I watched this anime and never knew the john titor thing was real. But this makes this post even more mind boggling   <br>I don't seem to get it, nothing of it will happen, what do you mean by that?</br>  <br>I just googled John titor, its a real thing. What the hell; I never realized those were real things. Welp, fuck. I thought you were just sitting me</br>  <br>The whole idea behind SciADV is taking real unexplained events/theories/tales and weaving them into a story.</br>   timeline stuff   <br><br> Not knowing about John Titor <br> Not knowing about the IBN5100 <br> Not knowing about C/SERN <br> Not knowing about Lifters <br><br>What have you been doing with your life?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you're from @channel.</br>     making signs for Japanese city level in a game <br> typing random shit into google translate <br> start using anime references <br> "Did you mean: El Psy Kongoo ? <br><br>THIS IS THE WILL OF STEINS GATE!</br></br></br></br></br>  As expected of the Committee.

All it depends on is how willing a reader is willing to accept magical delusion swords as a plot point.</br>  <br><br>No kidding. Limited to particles though.<br><br><br><br>Because the anime adaptation is shit. When people talk about C;H here, they're talking about the VN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I meant the majority of discussions I've seen involving ranking have had C;H &gt; S;G. If you look at it from a self-insert point of view, it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>Anime was legitimate trash. Most adaptations almost never capture enough of the source material to live up to it, but the C;H anime takes that to another level. It removes entire scenes that are important to the plot, and then goes and adds anime original scenes that go against the tone of the entire VN. On top of that, the animation and art quality are fucking trash.<br><br>The VN is great, but most people on MAL only watch the anime and write off the entire series based on that.</br></br></br>    <br>It hurts to live</br>  <br><br>Dear god, I didn't think the animation could be that fucking hideous. This is a delusion right? I'm dreaming right?</br></br>  <br>There was no animation of C;H. It doesn't exist.

You'll have more info on Noah in a week or two."<br>Nothing we don't already know.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's "Noah might be getting localized, but it could be something else."</br>  <br>Actually he suggested it could be something other than Noah.</br>  <br><br>I don't believe for a second that the localisation isn't Noah, but in a hypothetical scenario where Noah is just getting a fantranslation for its PSP port, and the official localisation is Elite, I wouldn't know how to feel.</br></br>  <br>What if it's neither? What if they were hoping to release Noah with PQube but PQube decided on a newer game like Robotics;Notes and put the Noah translation on the backburner for a future release?</br>  <br>What warp are you talking about?</br>  <br>Then I would know how to feel. Disappointed.</br>  <br>What if it was Zero?</br>  <br>Zero is getting localized eventually. I want to finally read C;H if it's possible.</br>  <br>Guess we'll just have to wait and see. I'd like to see Noah as well but you know how companies are, we're probably a minority.</br>  For something I read only once at least three years ago, I'm surprised at how much I can still remember of C;H.

Just saying what the company thinks.</br>  <br>I played Steins;Gate because I heard it was a good time travelling story. Branched out from there.</br>  <br>Originally it was just a VN on a list, then it was the concepts, now it's the world.</br>  <br><br> sci;adv stories <br> I only played Steins;Gate and have no idea what other titles are. </br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you watched the FUNimation localization of Steins;Gate.</br>  <br>fbxfag here, I go to UAF, the HAARP system is just a research station.

Stayed for paranoid time travel.<br>Unfortunately after I watched the C;H anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Well if you want the truth, that's nothing, you should see the extinct living samples we keep pulling out of the permafrost cavern to the east of the installation. I'd be more worried about a biological entity to be honest.</br>  <br> V 1.15 <br>Daru pls stop naming things</br></br>  <br>The only good part about Darling were the SoL labmems shenanigans. They could've skipped the romance for all it added to the game.</br>  <br>God damn it. I always get sad when people say they watched the Chaos;Head anime.</br>  <br>I had no draw. I watched the Glass Reflection review of S;G back in 2013 while I was searching for a new show to watch, and his immeanse praise of it convinced me to try it. After I really loved the show, then came to a sciADV thread where I announced that I'd just finished S;G, and you anons told me about how much better the VN was, its connection to C;H, and had me read that too. Now I'm one of those anons in a sciADV thread who tells people to go read the VNs after they come here announcing that they've finished S;G.</br>  <br>Yeah, I should have played the vn.<br>At first I thought ithe anime was was OK for noid shit.<br>Well now I own almost all Phantasm collection</br></br></br>  <br>Thought that was someone doing a S;G side material thing. I plan on flashing it up sometime if I ever git gud at photoshop</br>  <br> extinct living samples <br>That's a non-sensical oxymoron if there ever was one. Presuming you mean biological samples from creatures now extinct, what's the most interesting sample you've found?</br></br>    <br>I don't care if it's milking or not, I for one can't wait for that new delicious Okabe suffering.</br>  Why does Suzuha have the best body?  <br>I'm on chapter 9 of the original Steins;Gate VN. Would not recommend playing it over a lot of hours in sits. Game is super fucking long - I have drained away half of my last two days on it. I had to spend an additional 2 hours getting my flags up for the true ending, as well. I didn't realize you had to respond to a message a certain way all the way back in Chapter 4, so it took me awhile. The whole achievements thing is funny - is it a jap thing to replay and try to get all the achievements on this shit? I cannot imagine doing all that disgusting repetitive savescumming.</br>  <br> Fat weeb makes a fit child <br>...what does this mean for a skinny weeb like me..</br></br>  <br>I'm on the second chapther ;-;</br>  <br>means the fat weeb was famous as fuck and had money so he was able to get a qt 10/10 cosplayer gf</br>   a cute scientist like Kurisu could be browsing 4chan reading this RIGHT NOW   <br>It's a good game and it's worth the time. I just grew really bored of it because I was probably reading 100+ pages in a single sit. It got very tedious for me because there is a ton of character development that I already knew about. Mayuri does cute things. Daru is a pervert. Kurisu is a tsundere. It really drills that into your mind, but maybe that's a good thing for the chapters when you start to get to the endings you can choose between. You may want to start looking at a guide to make sure you are clicking the right options beginning on Chapter 4.<br><br>I was so dumb that I didn't even realize you could make choices in it until half the game was over. You'll probably derive a lot more enjoyment than I did it if you play for like 2-3 hours per day.</br></br></br>  <br>@channel&gt;4chan</br>  <br>They really fucked her hair color in the anime, didn't they?</br>  <br>Is there a story behind that?</br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Ue9yojxHxV  <br>Not sure. There didn't seem to be anything notably good about the art or animation in the anime from what I remember, so maybe it just had a low budget. I'm sure its hard to compete with the value of the art in the VN.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=n_w<wbr>Ya79TUVs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>What's your anons thoughts on the OP of the VN?</br></br>  <br>presumably because it was easier to animate than huke's style</br>  Me drinking Dr pepper like it's water, I eventually saw /v/ and /a/ posting Kurisu with Dr Pepper and caught my attention as the "Dr pepper anime" and stayed for motherfuckin time traveling  <br>that's not the OP<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Snz<wbr>mfmivXk0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> the Dr Pepper anime <br><br>Man, you must have been dissapointed. Memes are really the worst.</br></br></br>  <br> dissapointed <br>Hell naw nigga I LOVED it and reading the thread now, seems I should look into the VN</br></br>  <br><br>Please do. Much stronger character development in there. The anime adaptation was fair, but it can't match the VN medium.</br></br>  Why doesn't Kurisu know how to wear a jacket?<br><br>Why don't they ever bring it up in the VN?</br></br>  <br><br>Thought they mention how she modified her old school uniform in the VN? Or am I thinking of Babel of the Grieved Maze?</br></br>  <br>If Okabe didn't suffer panic attack for at least 5 times, I'd be sorely disappointed.<br> Does the mental suffering that he experienced in the movie counts as PTSD? </br></br>  <br>Her outfit is a modification of the very school uniform in that picture.<br><br><br>Barely. It was much larger in the Holy Day afterstory, he has visceral nightmares and can't look at Nae without feeling like shit.</br></br></br></br>  How much of the anime soundtrack is taken from the visual novel?  <br>I know about that, but it still doesn't explain the retarded way of wearing the jacket.</br>  <br>why would she wear a jacket normally in the middle of summer?</br>  <br>Why would you wear a jacket at all in the middle of summer? She must get sweaty.</br>  <br>What kind of jacket is that? Doesn't even hang by the shoulders</br>  <br> she must get sweaty <br><br>You just answered your own question</br></br></br>  <br> tfw no qt Japanese neuroscientist pure Christian waifu <br><br>Why<br><br>Even<br><br>Fucking<br><br>Live</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BRS manage to do it well.<br>But then again, it's CGshit, so there's that.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying Cristina enjoys getting sweaty?</br>  <br>Does the Pope shit in the woods?<br><br>She's a pervert. Of course she does.</br></br></br>  Oh. I got the full lyrics to Singularity.<br>Guess I can sub that OP video now.</br>  <br>She's also a filthy fujoshi. Are there any limits to her perversion?</br>  new gate soon, then what.  <br>I mean it's not like she'd brainwash Ruka into being her sex slave.<br><br>... :l</br></br></br>  <br>Can you upload a low quality song like with Vanitas?</br>  <br>I don't have the CD yet, just the lyrics sheet. If I had the CD I could've just done a proper rip.</br>  <br>God, just imagine how kinky the sex would be</br>  <br> Ruka <br> emote <br>Fuck off, you pleb scum.</br></br></br>  <br> then what <br>More milking, what else?<br>   yfw a Gamma worldline fandisc </br></br></br>  So, what happens once Okabe leaves a world line? Do events play out from then on normally in a separate reality, or does Okabe leaping kill/repeat that line? It's hard to imagine the reality he leaves once he gets into the time leaping process if this isn't the case.<br><br>My understanding of it was that every single time Okabe went to the past in his world line, then the world line he was in would be rewritten but would still be linearly planned out as to keep pace with all the other realities that are playing out in the future (present). I feel like it's more complicated than that, though</br></br>  <br>No. That's pretty much what happens. World Lines are deconstructed and rebuilt, there is only one at a time.</br>  <br>Alright, that brings me a lot of clarity then.</br>  <br>The act of time leaping changes the world-line. In the VN before they actually use the time leap machine, they thought that it would function similar to how the d-mail changes the past. However, because a person's "consciousness" leaps along with their memories, they don't experience the the worldline change. When Luka uses the time leap machine in her route, Okabe experiences it the same way he experiences a d-mail change</br>  There, done with the game-size version of Singularity at least. I'll probably put up a video with a maybe revised version tomorrow since it got done pretty fast.<br> The 4th line is totally referring to Noah's climax. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qft<wbr>iIuQPS3U</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> 思いがけない雨に濡れ　逃げ込んだまま<br>Soaked by the unforseen rain, I continued to flee<br>衝動も悦楽さえも　あばたに描くだけ<br>My pleasures and urges became nothing but pockmarks<br><br>奇跡のはじまり　ありがちシチュエーション<br>The birth of a miracle, an everyday situation<br>戯曲は大詰め　そして　光に包まれる───<br>The play entered its finale, and all was engulfed in light...<br><br>恋をして　<br>Meet with love...<br>キスをして<br>Lock your lips...<br>二人の道はカオスに　重なるから<br>For the path those two tread is shrouded in chaos<br>silent night　いつの日か　本当の空へ<br>Silent Night, so that one day we might reach that True Sky<br>木漏れ日が瞳を射すなら　偽りの祈りを捧げる<br>If the sunlight is reflected in those eyes, then clasp your hands and send out your false prayers<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, based steiner</br>  <br>Thanks as always.<br><br>Which line was giving you trouble before?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice work Stiner</br>  <br>It was the English part.

It's a shitty adaptation.</br>  <br>I bought it<br>Never heard of it before</br></br>  <br>don't forget</br>  AR Kurisu for steins;gate 5th anniversary http://steinsgate.jp/5th/event.html<wbr>#collabo2</wbr>  steins gate 0 is coming out<br>hype</br>  <br><br>We'll never get this over here will we?</br></br>  <br> AR Maho for next month <br>Yay.  Meh, it's just a fucking AR. </br></br>  <br>I suppose you'd prefer a wAIfu?</br>  <br>who wouldn't?</br>  <br>nah nigga it's dumb fanservice SoL for japanophiles</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> vn <br> &gt; <br> &gt; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> vn <br> &gt;&gt; <br> &gt;&gt;&gt; <br> &gt;&gt; <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;/anywherebuthere/ </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>end your life</br>  <br/>  <br>after steins gate 0</br>  <br>In another timeline,he would be alive<br>So the hype will continue</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> In another timeline,he would be alive <br>There is only one world, one world line.<br>He will be dead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Only if Steins;Gate wills it.</br></br>  So this little gem just aired last week. Any first impressions?<br>I honestly think its great so far.</br>  SLUT  It could do with some advertisment, maybe a show about high-school girls doing cute things that references it every episode?  KyoAni can't do anything that isn't Key shit. it will flop  The first episode was good but It was no Eva.  <br>It's so good that I watched the same episode 8 times. I'll never get tired of this. Never.</br>    Best girl coming through  <br>trips confirms best girl<br>i'd  give her a love letter expressing my deepest feelings </br></br>  Endless Eight is only 43 pages long guys. Don't worry.  <br>It had potential but the production values are terrible. The script makes no sense, the camerawork is awful, and just look at these special effects.</br>  is it just me or does this anime look like its gonna be shit?  CLAMP is at it again. Apparently this gay shit is coming next year. Got a leaked screenshot of the main protag  <br>This shit can fund itself at least 10 seasons straight.</br>  still hoping for that season 3 that will most likely never come  Wait, is this supposed to be the first episode? What was with that QUALITY episode last week?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7c8<wbr>L63uUFcI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xpN<wbr>Xwp39ee4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I'm sure Aya Hirano will have a promising career with this. Is there any VA more perfect and pure than Aya Hirano?</br>  <br>Daisuke Ono</br>  Do you think moot will ever leave this place?  <br>Only if he gets v&amp;</br>  <br>This. And Koizumi is a great protag but tha first episode was confusing as fuck. I hope they'll explai the setting more in later episodes.</br>  <br>Holy fuck was this hard to shit through. Shit is going to flop bad.</br>  timeskip = lazy writing<br><br>prove me wrong narutofags</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed It, actually. This character is kinda interesting.</br>  <br>Mai pure Waifu. Gonna pick up`the bass so I can be in her band.</br>  <br>Why? Its universe is amazing and interesting</br>  May Mikuru's seiyuu live forever a healthy life.  <br>God I hope not. Only one episode in and I want to drop it already.</br>  What drugs does kyoAni use when making Haruhi?  Does Gonzo still exist?  i dont know, guys. I have a feeling like it'll stick.<br>by the way who enjoyed that zabuza episode on toonami last week? Naruto is getting fucking insane</br>   That monologue <br> That sountrack <br> That opening <br>AOTY</br></br></br>  The ED was pretty catchy. I kinda want to learn how to do the dance, but I guess it's not like there'll ever be anyone I can dance with.  4006 days to go.  <br>I loved the ED. I hope there will be more dancing EDs in the future!</br>  zomg  <br> zomg  <br>back to 9gag.</br></br>  Best girl. So friendly and harmless.  <br>Yeah, maybe they'll repeat the "loop" like three times during the 24 minutes of the episode or some shit.</br>  <br>God she was adorable. I hope she becomes part of the main group; she wasn't in the ED.</br>  slice of life bullshit  <br>Maybe she will become interested in the MC?<br>I foresee a confession after school.</br></br>  <br>What was MC's name again? I don't recall anyone mention it during the episode.</br>  <br> hard to shit through <br>You watch anime while you shit?</br></br>  <br>Arent you watching the glorious Witchblade?<br>Dat mom is so hot.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/d-RtHYihP5s  [ ]</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EsB<wbr>eKqvROZs</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I kinda hope not; I don't want this to be turning into some show that's just about a ton of girls all going after the same gay.</br>  Did anyone else pick up Death Note? First episode is pretty promising. I think protag's got the right idea.  <br>Im right there with you. I just hope it doesn't snowball into some really weird insane clump of twists. Keep it it fun and cool like ep 1 and the rest of the season should be amazing</br>  I hope subs for Gun-dou Musashi come soon, it looks like it's got potential.  <br><br> liking an edgy bored teenager  <br>Heh. I hope this kind of MC doesn't become a thing from now on.</br></br></br>  I want gaiafags to leave.  Oruta madaaaaaa  I don't know about this series. I've read the LN and their really isn't any high point for them to finish on unless they start cramming multiple volumes in one novel.  <br>eat a dick</br>  This show looks cute. Anybody given it a look yet?  <br> THREEEEEEEE! </br>  New scans for [Contemporary Popular Manga] are out. Anyone read this yet?  <br> Tokyopop <br>shitsux, wtf are you doing?</br></br>  <br> You failed the test </br>  <br> Sorry, I guess? I'm thickheaded so I suppose I didn't properly guess your intention. </br>  I really liked Tsukihime. Here's hoping this Type Moon adaptation is good!  <br>Are you from the future?</br>  <br>I bet it will be an historic adaptation</br>  guys, remember when candlejack was a meme? oh those were the da  <br>That shit has nothing to do with /a/, not even remotely.</br>    new berserk chapter is coming out soon boys. I wounder what its gonna be aboat  <br>Boards used to be more friendly.</br>  Hey there.

I just wipe it off and be on my way.</br></br>  need more loving fox moms  As usual, no mention of her, when most other boards would have posted her right away. I'd be disappointed, if I wasn't used to it.  <br>Could it be leftover precum from not ejaculating semen after edging?It's not retrograde ejaculation is it?</br>  <br><br>i dunno but better out than in.</br></br>     how hard  would you?  <br> Her begging for her sister to forgive her while her sister's boyfriend rapes her <br>That is the only scene I jerked off to in the Asagi anime but I must've done it at least four or five times that night</br></br>  <br><br> gently at first <br><br> then once her brain learns to accept the pleasure the body was receiving, dick her hard and long throughout the night <br><br> with lots of kissing and  lewd hand holding complete with fingerlocking </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pissed again,no grayish matter.

Even the sisters are great, but it can't topped this.</br>    Would have been right around the end of 2002. I found bootleg VCDs in my dads closet while looking for some PC games. She my first and no one can take that from me, I love her dearly to this day.  <br>Not enough hentai where the girls' minds are just turned completely inside out by the villain through intense brainwashing. <br><br> Any recommendations? </br></br></br>  <br>arigato anon</br>  <br>the rest of the boys do fuck with the local girls and sensei in the end.</br>  <br><br>Also helps that Kagami designs are pure sex. And that the story is about breaking strong career military women and not dumb teenagers like most hypnosis hentai.</br></br>  <br><br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/835241/4d6f40<wbr>94df/<br><br>V-Vindication?</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Literally everything by lilith ever except yuzuminatsu, which ironically is their best work</br>  <br>I don't play H-games, but I fapped like a trillion times to the doujin adaptation. How much better is the original?</br>  <br><br>Shocku desu.</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>That as well. I'm glad they adapted the bad end where they become the villain's happy cumdump maids, because the dumbest thing to do in fetish porn is punish the character giving the audience what they want.</br>  <br><br>It's all about the follow through. Like netorare where the story actually sees some kind of real conclusion to that relationship, or a strong glimpse of the future.</br></br>  <br>Murasaki.</br>  <br>I have a shitty hipster computer, but I too have fapped rigorously to the adaptation and hope the sequels get adapted as well.</br>  <br>Also, Asagi. Like, seriously, why hasn't that happened yet?</br>  Is /a/ feeling horny lately?  <br>maybe</br>  <br>/a/ is always horny.</br>  <br>Eating out a girl is a practiced art.</br>  <br>I can't imagine how they made five episodes of this. Is there anyone else besides her and the main guy that fucks?</br>    <br><br>I love disgustingly erotic stuff like this, can't wait.</br></br>  <br>source?</br>  <br>I was going through some stuff in my hentai folder that I hadn't checked out in a while and completely forgot about, and I dunno how I forgot this. Goddamn I would let this woman milk me all day every day. The train scene was 12/10.</br>  <br>The translator guys on /h/ just posted an incompletely-edited but readable version of the whole nudist beach series in magazine raws. <br><br>http://imgur.com/a/QgIkP<br><br>Real panda version when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>source?</br></br>    Soon    <br>But the magazine raws for the last part aren't out yet. They must have gotten it leaked or someone actually bought VIP access from mikocon.</br>  <br>This took way too long.<br><br>Also, no Mika? What happened to the /a/ I used to know?</br></br></br>  This teacher  <br>diamonds</br>  I'd go for Touched by Angels ending.  <br>I'm with you anon.

It's always been "otaku pandering" and despite what some people believe "moe" is not a new thing.</br></br></br>  <br>When Keit-Ai aired.</br>  Mid 80's to late 90's. That is when anime came to murrica and started to become popular. If you were lucky in the 80's you could find it on TV. In the 90's we only had Saturday anime on sci fi or if you went to suncoast to buy a VHS tape.  <br>he's probably Best Coast.</br>  <br> you went to suncoast to buy a VHS tape <br><br>I'm amazed by the number of people who's pre-Toonami anime experience in the 90s was getting their parents to drive them to a Suncoast. The closest one to me was 2 hours away, and it's how I kept up with Tenchi, Eva, and DBZ in those days. That shit was like finding a treasure. <br><br>Something about how readily available anime is online sort of makes it less special. Finding it was half the experience for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that the Monogatari series would be better if Kyoani were in charge instead of Shaft.  Literally any show would be better off if it was done by KyoAni. I know hating this studio is a cool thing to do on /a/ right now, but the fact is that KA is pretty much in the tier of their own when it comes to quality productions.  <br>Bakemonogatari was a good watch but the other Monogatari series are so boring I could never get through them. I don't care about Shaft's presentation. It never fit Monogatari the way it for SZS. If KyoAni animated Monogatari it might be worth siting through because at least the animation quality would be decent.</br>  <br> We will never get pre-'10s Madhouse ever again  <br><br>why even live</br></br></br>  <br>Thank god it wasn't. <br>I'd hate to see KyoAni resort to that level of blatant fanservice. Amagi was bad enough, and that was admittedly nothing in comparison.</br></br>  <br> premise == quality <br>k m8</br></br>  Top 10 Waifus, go.
