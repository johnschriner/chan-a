[ Does anyone read KissXSis? Or am I the only one?

I think it's just a coincidence. In Miki's flashback there were adults, but they all ended up dead.

You get the gist of the characters, plot, and setting, and then can move on to reading the original source to fill in all the details that couldn't be adapted.

I was blown away by the reveal. Can't wait for the next episode.  What a faggot  <br>At least say manpower and care instead of budget. They get the money for each show from the different production commitees, so it's not like the budget allocated for Laplace or MonMusu will have any influence on how GG turns out.</br>  <br>There you go!</br>  <br> /a/ is or has ever been about serious discussion <br>You're just mad that people have started your precious series without reading the manga aren't you?</br></br>  <br>You already posted this.</br>  <br>Just because you are on /a/ doesn't entitle you to be an asshole for no reason. Let people enjoy the episode how they wish and stop shitting on people for no reason.<br><br>Just because you spoiled yourself, doesn't mean everyone else is wrong for being surprised.</br></br></br>  <br> MAL forums <br> ever <br>Delete your post</br></br></br>  Am i the only one that noticed that everyone that the opening shows during the second "Shitai" part is a "corpse" already?  <br>Still no examples, huh? And background characters don't matter, for starters.</br>  <br>Now you're just shitposting</br>  Ep 1 was poorly executed, and they're already fucked it up by showing Mii in the first episode and a fucking dog. Meh.  <br>Stop shitposting no one has to do anything. Don't be as cancerous as those retards in LN thread screeching for people to reach their shitty source material.</br>  <br>I don't care about people watching the series, I just don't want the threads to be flooded by blogging faggots.<br>There only difference about these people and  is that the faggots here enjoy the suffering.</br></br>  <br>The description tells you that it's girls living at school after a zombie apocalypse.</br>  <br>First day posting here? I and 99% of the board were spoiled weeks (if not months) ago on what this series is really about.<br><br>If you would like to keep posting on /a/, I suggest acting like less of a defensive faggot in the future.</br></br></br>  <br> I posted it again </br>  They already improved it vastly from the manga by making it regular steel wire instead of fucking barbed wire on the barricade.  <br>there were background characters? all I saw were four girls and a dog.</br>  Thread is aids. See you guys after it's done airing.  <br>Look I love both GG and MonMusu  Hell, I even ordered five volumes of each one today  but it's kind of obvious they'd take MonMusu as a priority. MonMusu is pretty popular in Japan and it has pretty good manga sales, so Lerche of course will try to make a good job with it since they were given the oportunity to handle a popular serialization. Meanwhile, GG is unknown and it has shit manga sales, do you think they'll make an effort when they have three shows in one season?</br>  <br>No, I just avoid spoilers because I like to go into a show surprised. I suggest you do it too, it's much more fun.</br>  <br>Shhh! Don't let Yuki hear you!</br>  <br>That isn't elitism it's just shitposting and it's been happening with most adaptations lately. I've read the manga since we were getting small dumps of it and I have no idea why people can't just let others discuss the anime.</br>  <br>Literally all first episode threads are like that. The shitposters die out around episode 3 or later, exceptions being KyoAni shows and whatever's popular.</br>  <br> Just because you are on /a/ doesn't entitle you to be an asshole for no reason. <br><br>Nah, I can be an asshole wherever I want.</br></br></br>  <br> Thread is aids <br>That's nothing new around this time.</br></br>  <br>Seriously, fuck off</br>  <br>It's funny how many things are considered blogging now</br>  <br>Hi people of 4chan. Someone PMed me this thread and you being overy criticized of my post gives me a chance to tell you one thing.<br>We don't care about your opinions. You are all deranged people who sh*ts on anime while claiming to liking it.<br>I hope police will arrest every one of you so that not only other anime communities but the whole internet population will breathe a sgih of relief.<br>Please don't bring our comments to this place again.

People should just stop being so triggered about being secondaries.</br>  <br>That's the point of pasta.</br>  <br>Because they're doing something differently than I did, it must be wrong! How dare they watch the anime first.</br>  So the proper way to watch this is thinking of it as a new experience rather than an adaptation right? I'm just hoping they nail certain scenes if they do show them.  <br>Just wait a few weeks.</br>  <br> and the point of calling it out is that newfags don't reply to it </br>  <br>Go look at the description on Wikipedia.</br>  <br>That's true, i didn't notice it. Pretty cool what they did with lyrics double meanings and stuff.</br>  DAIZ YOU FUCKER.  <br>What did he do now</br>  <br><br> I started watching this even if it looked like moeshit <br> Oh wow this is turning so dark i like it <br> Favorite episode </br></br></br></br>  <br>The dog was included there too, so does that mean it doesn't actually exist?</br>  <br> It dies in a flashback in the manga,  not sure about the anime.</br>  They would make her take off the hat at school yet she keeps it on. <br><br>Immersion lost, I can't continue this anime knowing such inconsistencies exist in a world I'm supposed to take seriously.</br></br>  <br> ´The dog became a zombie before the series started and was killed by Megu-nee. </br>  <br>Blogging is when you talk about your personal life.<br>Even if you consider that blogging, talking about your reaction to an episodein a few words isn't wrong (or "blogging") at all.<br>Because of people acting like this "blogging" has become an epic meme</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this dog is real since everybody is interacting with him.</br>  <br> even if it looked like moeshit <br> implying I didn't read the description in the season chart <br>Just because I knew something was going to happen doesn't make the reveal any less surprising.</br></br></br>  <br/>   Been reading the manga since it started getting translated <br> Still felt the twist <br>I think the music box music really added to it.

I only wish I read the manga before the anime started, I can see from this thread alone that thread quality has gone down compared to last night.<br><br>I only got one question about Chapter 30:<br> Did more time pass than I thought when the girls did their graduation ceremony (I thought it was still the summer), or was there no timeskip and they only did so early because they know they're escaping the school for good? It's probably the latter, but I want a confirmation just in case. </br></br></br>  You guys know that spoiling shows is against the rules, right?<br>I'm reporting everyone here.</br>  <br>Yeah, there are far too many differences already between the anime and manga for it to matter anymore.<br><br>Also, what's that about them meeting a group of highschoolers? I read all 35 chapters</br></br></br>  <br><br>Reporting rarely works these days, mods usually focus on deleting porn or blatant spam (like those "Hi I'm Anon etc." posts in that Sore ga Seiyuu thread), shitposts tend to stick around.</br></br>  <br>i had a very higurashi feel when it first started but did not see that end coming.</br>  <br>Narutaru doesn't get enough love on /a/.

It was still a lot better than expected but it dragged on for too long, I think what makes the first chapter of the manga so good is that they drop the bomb at you pretty soon and out of nowhere but in the anime it makes you expect it.<br>Also they missed Yuki's comment about the Baseball team being"pretty lively" and that was one of the best "fucked up on retrospective" parts.<br>Still it was pretty good and can't wait for more, just hope they do the library and meeting the real Megu-nee right.</br></br>  <br>That grave marker wasn't there earlier.</br>  <br>Holy shit I wish I could be as badarse as you. It's also unbelievable reading the manga prevented you from seeing any hints.</br>  <br>They look like generic background character blobs.

Nobody eats fucking hardtack unless they'd be starving otherwise.</br>  <br>It's hit or miss really. I successfully reported a spoonfeeder the other day.</br>  ITT: Shows that did it better.  <br>Many people  Myself included  belived that it took place before the apocalypse had happened rather than it being like it was</br>    <br>Wrong, Madoka's twist was shit.</br>    <br><br>Get out</br></br>  <br>The constant hints and nudges sold that out pretty quickly though.</br>  <br>It tastes like hopes and dreams.  It gets destroyed and dissolved once you eat it. </br>  <br>Do we even have real raws? I only saw korean scanlations and I can't do shit with those.</br>  <br>My eyes are real, though. I've seen them on a CAT-scan/x-ray thing.</br>  <br>Railwars uses even tree-cars so it's really not comparable to anything</br>  <br>yes it was.</br>  <br> tfw Hazard doesn't play for your team </br>  <br>How are we supposed to know what it's sold as? It's better to go into anime blind.<br>I didn't have any expectation either way so I can't even say I was shocked. I just took it as it happened.</br></br>  <br>VNs that did it better.</br>  The smugest.  <br>But nobody here talked about the TWIST because it happens in first chapter.<br><br>GG is about suffering, not twists.</br></br></br>  somebody fetch moot and ask him why the fuck 4chan is so slow today  <br> mouse cursor </br>  Will we get a new OP/ED next week?  <br>This. The twists are M. Night tier. And not early M. Night either. It's all about alternating between CGDCT and cute girls suffering.</br>  What the fuck. This is getting animated? Wow. Was the first episode good? This has great potential.  <br>At least it isn't funi.</br>  <br>Le pace and skillful diving man wouldn't even be able to outmaneuver the zombies in this show.</br>  <br> moot <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> i only read le superior manga <br> haha i know what happens in this series and you dont </br></br>  <br>No.  Lerche would play it in reverse. </br>  <br>Asuka's husbando.</br>  <br>I hope not. OP might prove to be the best of the season.</br>  <br> Fuck, didn't see that shit </br>    <br>At most, just visual changes. It would be kind of unsettling if the OP started to have imagery more fitting of the show as it went on but kept the song.</br>  <br>I hope it's the same song but every building in it is ruined and all the characters that have been revealed be dead shown as zombies or just not there anymore</br>  <br>Are we going to do this every thread and every episode now?</br>  God damn they got me, I knew the show was about zombies but I was expecting some shit at the very end where they wake up the next day and the school is empty then they look outside and there's zombies. The only thing I noticed was the barricade which I thought was just them storing the desks and the fact that nobody cared about Mii-Kun just walking into random classes.  <br>What about you watch it.</br>  <br> &gt;Wanting to reproduce with a mental patient and a part zombie <br>This sounds liek a bad doujinshi.<br><br>Hell i think ive read a doujin about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It would be kind of unsettling if the OP started to have imagery more fitting of the show as it went on but kept the song. <br>That sounds like it would be fun.</br></br>  <br>You don't need to squint, it isn't that small.</br>  <br>dat text on the blackboard</br>  <br>If they don't do justice to the chapter where Megu-nee discovered everything i swear to God i'll bitch about it for days</br>  What book is this?  <br>I don't want to. I don't want to set myself to disappointment. Did you like it?</br>  <br>That fucking font holy shit.</br>  What's Rii going to do once she finds out her sister is a bear?  <br>The Stand</br>  <br>THE STANDard.</br>  <br>The stand. It's about a virus that kill almost everyone in the world.</br>  <br>Die.</br>  <br>The Standard by Steppen King.</br>  Okay I wasn't expecting that, the show is really fun aswell   Japanese have retarded work culture <br> main character is a bumbling idiot who embarrasses herself constantly <br>I don't see the fun.</br></br>  <br>I didn't expect the dubbing work to be that shit. I mean they don't have enough mics and seats? What if more people need to talk than the mics they have? Causing unnecessery stress on the workers whiles paying them shit, wow what a great industry.</br>   .wav <br>Heh</br>  <br> expecting 5min eps  <br> get 24 mins instead </br></br>  It's okay, but Wakaba Girl is certainly the better SoL show that barely anyone notices this season.<br><br><br>Give it three episode, I will as well.</br></br></br>    I like the ED, specifically because of the cardboard animation.  Why are lolis so good at basketball  They practice.  tiny flexible bodies   yfw this is nominated for a Grammy   <br>Is it already out?</br>  <br><br>Since last week, anon.</br></br>  This makes me happy.  <br>It makes everyone happy.</br>  <br><br>Could we submit this to the Recording Academy?</br></br>  <br>I hate to ask but what is this?</br>  <br>Instrumental covers of anime tracks made by /a/nons over the course of a year.</br>  <br>MP3 - https://mega.co.nz/#!zJNF0AyB!UXJxp<wbr>kBovjS7N0QmyytAb9TBZ-DysosVweWeflam<wbr>k2A<br>FLAC - https://mega.co.nz/#F!qVEylRZI!rr1L<wbr>md4U2KkqlKgp43Er-w<br>MF Mirror [MP3] - http://www.mediafire.com/?1t9nxjqym<wbr>sebs<br>YouTube: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dq6<wbr>yF7Kh4DY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br> That surf sounding K-On <br><br>My sides.

Ignore buttmad fags!</br></br>  <br>It sounds like ass, but that's half the appeal.</br>  <br><br>I just think it's spectacular. Kudos to all the anons involved.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the dude's playing was too off sync the mixer had to cut and paste all over the place, hence the clipping.</br>  It's not something really good, there're many differents problems but well... I applaud the initiative. There're some good stuff to here and I'd like to hear a second session with some improvement.  it sounds not the best, but i love it.<br><br>is that weird?</br></br>  <br>Its cause you have a connection with the sad bastards that made it, I feel it too anon.</br>  <br>Yes.

If anything the amount of stupid shit that 4chan users have been behind probably outweighs anything that reddit or tumblr have organized.<br><br>If enough anons want something done, it gets done somehow.</br></br></br>  A lot of the parts individually would be really good alone, but things fuck up when put together. It is fucking funny though. Glad that this happened.   Sora ni Hikaru <br>It's... beautiful. Except for that one off-tune violin segment.</br>  <br>Have been absent for some time but I have to say that this is completely awesome.<br><br>I'll try and keep up and maybe I can join the second CD. Keep up the good work everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>that colors was kind of amazing.</br>  This version of Wasteland is almost spot-on. I was almost convinced that the regular track was put on there to trick me.  These instruments must have cost a lot of money, why are you all so bad at playing them?

At least I still have it to draw dicks in MS paint from time to time.</br></br>  It's shit.<br>But I like listening to it 'cause it's by people from /a/. It's like a child's drawing of you.</br>  This is brilliant I love you faggots  <br>Buddy of mine bought a cintiq for like 2k or some shit. Literally forced himself to git gud to justify the price. He's now working for clients like Epic Games. He hates his job lol.</br>  My sister can play the recorder just as well as you guys can. She's 12.  <br>Considering that we put anonymity above all means that anything that anons do has enjoyment and fun as its end goal, /a/nons actually wanted to do this for the sake of doing it for their hobby. Anonymous will be acknowledged for this as a whole not as an individual so you can't brag and attention whore like on reddit and tumblr, having an actual identity ruins a lot of shit.</br>  <br> Implying /a/ is not 12 years old girls <br><br>What is the problem here?</br></br></br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>yeah i bet she plays dick better than us too</br>  <br> this entire album </br>  <br>But can she rap on a kazoo?</br>  <br>That Nisemono track is pretty damn good.</br>  <br>Exactly, when it comes to other sites, there will always be drama because some asshole will try too hard or be a bitch to other people, finally making them quit.<br><br> Much like Hibikek </br></br></br>  Bravo- much regret missing out on this, but I couldn't be assed to get valve oil for my ufo. Maybe one day there'll be a round 2.  <br>there is a round two going on right now, and we need a ufo, feel free to drop in at https://titanpad.com/orchestra</br>  <br>Better than my friends sister who got an expensive tablet and ruined her artistic abilities by listening to tumblrs advice. She tried to get into artschool and they declined her because she only drew tumblrnose bullshit.</br>  <br>But anon, Round 2 has already begun.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/?jk35argxj<wbr>0lp662/</wbr></br></br></br>   Sis puella magica <br>Y'all niggas did very good on that one. I tip my fedora-longcoat hybrid to you.</br>  <br>Ouch.</br>  <br>What's up with tumblr and those disgusting red nose ? Does they think it's cute or pretty ?</br>  <br><br><br>Well shit, thanks for the info. Time to warm up the ufo I guess</br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr is probably the worst place to follow advice from aside from DA. You're better off being told your shit than being in a hugbox. Did she ever attend any life drawing classes or ateliers after that to get better?</br>  <br>What songs did you guys pick this time?</br>  Helps that I'm mostly tone deaf, I can enjoy this without getting ticked off like other anons at any off notes.  <br>God this flute at the beginning... I will not even to listen if all musics are like this.</br>  <br>we dunno yet, but we have arrangers working on shit already</br>  <br>How about  Space Lion <br> for moot </br></br>  <br>It began as an artistic quirk by some artist to make themselves stand out, and to be fair it was pretty subtle, just makes their nose seem more buttonish and cute. However everyone on tumblr wants their artwork to be quirky and unique, so they took it and ran it into the ground by turning it into something to make the character seem less idealized and average by making it bigger, or something.<br><br><br>From what I could tell she never drew any landscapes or still life. Just people, and her drawings weren't bad, they just seemed like the typical "tumblr style" sort of thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/gi3gjkHk</br>  <br> Not ending with "The end of Evangelion" </br>  <br><br><br>What so all 5 people can show up?</br></br></br>  <br> nose <br> cute <br>Truly the epitome of delusion.</br></br></br>  <br>That's for vol 2, anon, a guy is arranging tumbling down.</br>  <br>Noice.</br>  Someone post the orchestr/a/ site with all the sheet music and shit  <br> "H-hey so uh... what anime do you like?" <br> "Oh um...

Are you actually a little girl? Did you get mad that we called you brother instead of sister?</br>  <br>You may call us names as much as you want, brother.<br>That will not kill the eternal bond between us.</br></br>  <br>A lot has to do with your average 4chan poster having a lot more free time than some shitty normie.</br>  <br><br>Stop that stuff about being siblings!

We have tons ground we haven't covered yet, if our requests list is any indication. <br><br>Stay hopeful, anon.

He wanted to do painting, but all of his skill was in architecture.</br>  <br>The person who rejected him recommended he apply for architecture instead.</br>  How did you guys feel about naruto gaiden?  It was entertaining  fuck off  gateway manga of the worst kind  it was a fun ride  looks like Naruto is a damsel in distress this time<br>also Momo a trap</br>  <br>It made shipperfags upset and destroyed their fantasies.<br>It also made me like Sarada a fair bit.<br>Shame about the shitty villain and the story not actually being abot connections regardless blood like it was set up nor being a proper setup to the Bolt film.</br></br></br>  So sakura was the mother right?  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>unfortunately, it was pretty expected, but still</br>  <br>Nice, I've been calling it since the beginning but I was just replied with shitposting and with "sakura fag in denial" or something.</br>    <br>b-but we have new news, anon-kun, look here </br>  <br>Someone has to do it</br>  <br>But we can have threads about "armpit pussy" and countless of fate threads. If people want to discuss one of the most popular manga/anime ever created then just let them be. And there was new material to talk about which was gaiden. Even moot himself said naruto is fine.</br>  Hinata hasn't appeared, it's shit  <br>I was calling red herring at the beginning, though with the DNA evidence a combination of Occam's Razor and whishful thinking had me legit think Karin was the mother, especially with the connection/inheritance thing.<br> Still doesn't change the fact that Sasuke didn't give enough of a shit to be there at the birth, see them even once in 12 years or even kiss his wife. </br></br>  Why does naruto trigger /a/?<br><br>Its harmless</br></br>  <br>Because it's popular, but having hundreds of fate threads are fine.</br>  <br>They believe Naruto brings normies to /a/</br>  <br>She never concerned herself with Uhiha fucking shits. Why would she be involved at all?<br>Sending a bento via Bolt to Naruto was itself a bit of a bonus cameo.</br></br>  <br>She knew not to mess with Uchiha shits, Tobirama is proud of her.</br>  <br> Its <br><br>It clearly isn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Think about it. Just how? How?</br>  <br>shit</br>  <br>Actually, cancel that.<br><br>Normies find here anyway through just about any place on the interwebs. FROM ANYWHERE. They're bound to find here anyway and these people think one series makes any difference? Either major case autism or total bullshit on their part.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not them so I have no clue.</br>  <br>It's funny because you find the same normies in Bleach and One Piece threads.</br>  <br>Bleach still gets threads?</br>  <br><br>was worth it for Dadruto and Sarada and I would read more of that if it didn't come with the stupid villains and the queen of cuck</br></br>  <br>Sakura being the mother wasn't even the issue.<br>The issue was how Sasuke, an asexual who always treated Sakura like a piece of shit on the bottom of his shoe, was able to procreate. Turkey baster is still the only thing that comes to mind.<br>Also Sakura still acts like a dog who hasn't been given it's treat yet.</br></br></br>  Who is hyped here?  <br>Was completely pointless with an asspull villain and overall went nowhere. The only major revelation was Kabuto still being alive, but even that felt like dues ex machina shit.</br>  <br><br><br>She's just not relevant, like in the other 700 chapters of the manga</br></br></br>  <br>The problem was had Kishimoto actually made Sakura not the mother, she would have been a better character, since for once she would have something selfless.</br>  <br>Not with that shitty animation. Seriously fuck the anime. My only hope lies in the Storm4 animation of that fight.</br>  <br>She's not involved in the Gaiden's story. If you seriously think she was irrelevant for the main manga, well you are plain wrong.</br>  <br>Hinata hasn't appeared most of the time in Naruto.</br>  <br>Based on what we've seen from each its gonna be ridiculous how far the game will outclass the anime, never mind the fact that we might get Kaguya in it before in the anime.</br>  <br>Besides doing her damn job as a medic the only good/selfless thing she did was push Hinata and Naruto in the Last, when she was written far more competently by someone else.</br>  <br> He fell for the ruse cruise. </br>  It was pretty horrible. <br>Also, what was the deal with Salad's paternity test showing that Karin was the mother but then Sakura was apparently the mother all along?</br>  <br>Anime brings normies to /a/</br>  <br>It's objectively bad.<br>It's like Twilight being discussed on /lit/ or Sucker Punch being discussed on /tv/.</br></br>  The fact that Oorochimaru is just allowed to open up a fucking orphanage that Naruto is cool with and even supports absolutely baffles me.<br>It was a clusterfuck of terrible writing, but that just topped the cake for me.</br>  <br>Even her becoming a medic was to fulfill her own desire to be not be useless. That is not an example of her being selfless.</br>  <br>Sakura either went after Sasuke while preggers or chased him down earlier, got pregnant, then the two split, but in either case she was wandering around 9 months pregnant in the middle of the wilderness.<br>Karin, who has moved on from the Sauce by the look of things/ust wants him to be happy found Sakura and helped her deliver her baby. As thanks Sakura gave the umbilicar cord to her. Suigetsu, presuming it was from Karin, tested it against Sarada.<br><br>Then once home Sakura made sure to make the whole thing hush-hush, and proceeded to keep silent about the woman who likely saved her own and her baby's life and plastered her face over hers to manufacture a family photo with Sausage.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the manga has been over for almost a year and the anime is still moving at a snails pace and churning out filler </br>  <br> becomes a medic <br> all she does is bitch and moan about not being a frontline fighter but support who has to hand back and heal people <br>Fucking cunt dig her own damn hole.</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru is running a science lab with Konoha keeping an eye on him. Given how he's too difficult to properly kill or contain, I can see some mutually beneficial arrangement coming in place.<br>Kabuto was the one who opened an orphanage, and he had his mind raped straight by Itachi, which seems to be good enough for Naruto. Yeah, that's pretty damn retarded.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Momoshiki: <br><br> 透明な羽衣をかぶっているモモシキ。手のうらには輪廻眼らしきものあるよ<wbr>うだ。</wbr> <br><br> Momoshiki wears a transparent robe of feathers**. In the palms of the hands, there seems to be something like a Rinnegan.  <br><br> **Important note: 羽衣 (angel's raiment, robe of feathers) is given as a 'Hagoromo' in furigana. The same as in the The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter that Kaguya was inspired from (the Hagoromo she was given that wiped away her memories of the Earth when she was taken by the celestial moon people), and the derived name of Ootsutsuki Hagoromo. <br><br> Kinshiki: <br><br> 体格が大きいキンシキ。フード隠された顔には、巨大な角のようなものが生<wbr>えている。</wbr> <br><br> Kinshiki has a large physique. Under the hood that conceals his face, there seems to be something like a huge horn that's growing. <br><br> Boruto: モモシキとキンシキ？負ける気がしねェ！！ <br><br> Momoshiki and Kinshiki? I don't feel like I'll lose!! <br><br> 新たな敵…モモシキとキンシキ登場！！ <br><br> The new enemies...Momoshiki and Kinshiki have appeared!! <br><br> ボルトの前に立ちはだかる新たな敵の名は、モモシキとキンシキ！原作者・<wbr>岸本斉史先生のラス画を特別公開。 果たして、どんな敵なのか…！？</wbr> <br><br> The names of the enemies who are blocking the way in front of Boruto are Momoshiki and Kinshiki! It's a special release of the sketch from the author: Masashi Kishimoto. What kind of enemy did you expect...!? <br><br><br> Boruto: Momoshiki and Kinshiki? I don't feel like I'll lose!! <br><br>Even Bort knows these two are complete and utter jobbers. Can't even intimidate a fucking 12 year-old.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was fun. Terrible, but fun. It was nice to see that the two worst characters made best girl.</br>  <br>Bad memories. Most of the old Narutards have moved onto shit like SnK.</br>  <br>It was fun until the ending, it felt like it just shat on everything by giving half-assed responses with things like Sakura being the mother and all the clones.</br>  <br> dat chibi Bort and Sunflower <br>Looks like someone finally remembered she exists.</br></br>  <br>And shit like Raildex. But no one will here will admit that that is just as bad as Naruto.</br>  <br>Anime's shit. SP devoted their budget to animating the Bort movie. Storm 4 is our only hope now.</br>  This would be the best story behind Sarada  <br>shit shit SHIT</br>  <br>Karin would have certainly made a better mother. That's for damn sure.</br>   Naruto:"He is different from my old self...." <br> Sasuke:"Ok...you'll be my student." <br> Boruto:"It's different from my father's lame era" <br> Sarada:"I'll become Hokage!" <br> Mitsuki:"But I appreciate that you respect my parent/s too".(I'm not really sure about this one). <br><br>Who wants to bet it's either Sister Snake or Netori?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Obito und Madara look like fookin retards  <br>Toneri doomed himself to solitude, the portal between Earth and the moon was destroyed.</br>  <br>Karin had a lot of potential before forgiving Sauce and cementing herself as an obsessive joke character.</br>  <br>Sasuke has issues, but he was never been an asexual and he has never treated Sakura like that. He treated Karin like that.</br>  <br> implying he didn't TnJ him into coming back and then act as his wingman until he got hitched <br><br><br>One of the things I liked about the Gaiden is how she actually matured. She's infinitely better than Pink Shit now. At least Karin grew up.<br><br><br> Their faces remind me of that one retarded kid from South Park. The evil one with the speech impediment. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke's average conversation to Sakura.<br><br> You're annoying <br> You're weak <br> Why do you even like me? <br> Yeah...Sorry <br><br>He treats her like a dog, tries to kill her, and worst of all he even questions why she keeps coming back for more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still doesn't change the fact that Sasuke didn't give enough of a shit to be there at the birth <br><br>He was. Read the Viz translation. Sasuke was with Sakura when Sarada was born.</br></br></br>  <br>Assblastedly hilarious. The reactions were gold.</br>  <br>He's a sadist and she's a masochist. It's a match made in heaven.</br>  <br>I'm not even sure you can call him a sadist when he makes it clear that he doesn't want to be around her.</br>  <br>There were some fun times.</br>  <br> Implying Sarada would be better with to moms </br>  <br>Sasuke consistently acts in a way that broadcasts the fact that he has essentially no sex drive, and is annoyed by the advances of all his fangirls.<br>He ridiculed Kakashi by likening him to Sakura, and told her that her feelings for him are a baseless love fantasy.<br>He acted disturbed when Karin kept coming onto him, but did hand-pick her for her skills and mastered his black flame thingie to save her ass. He pretty much tolerates her so long as she could pull her weight, see him getting rid of her when she got taken hostage.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura will always be Sasuke's abused, but loyal pet dog that he never plays with.</br>  <br> Salad gets two tacos <br> Burrito gets two wieners <br>pottery</br></br></br>  <br>At least one of them would be a sane women who doesn't destroy their house when she's upset.</br>  <br>She was silent because she sneaked in Sasuke's dangerous secret mission that Sarada couldn't know. At least from what I understood it, she was stressed over this.</br>  <br>Didn't she once took a knife to the gut for an old lady she had just met?</br>  <br> implying the best outcome wouldn't be pic related </br>  <br>Regardless of how it ended, the threads were absolutely hilarious.</br>  <br>?</br>  <br> but in either case she was wandering around 9 months pregnant in the middle of the wilderness <br> gee I miss Sasuke <br> which is why I better leave the village and go out into the wilderness with no escort or means of calling for help if something should happen risking the life of my unborn child who could literally fall out of my cooch at any moment <br> what a responsible mother I am <br>I'd call this impossibly retarded, but no, it's actually perfectly in-character for Pink to act this way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Chiyo also a foreign dignitary and the only one who could defeat that akatsuki member (his name escapes me). Besides that's a mild inconvenience, considering that she could easily heal herself from it.</br>  <br>I like Madara, but Obito does look retarded. In that particular picture his head is all lop-sided.</br>  <br>The one with the glasses. <br><br><br>Honestly, the movie seems pretty straightforward and probably won't have any fun twists or turns like the Gaiden. This may have been our last chance to laugh with/at Nurudu. <br><br>And that kinda makes me sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the movie seems pretty straightforward and probably won't have any fun twists or turns like the Gaiden <br> doesn't know about Cakegate </br></br>  <br>I barely recall anything about the show. Aren't the only retarded kids in it Timmy and Jimmy?</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> look this woman helped me to deliver my baby and saved my life which I endangered due to my own stupidity <br> I'm going to not tell my daughter anything about her and I'm going to tape my face over her's in the only photo I have of Sasuke. </br></br></br>  <br>Chiyo wasn't just some old lady, was Sasori's grandma and also the only reason Sakura survived against most of his tricks.</br>  <br>It was meh at best and shit at worst, but what really made it fun for me was how /a/ reacted to it</br>  <br>I only remember him because he'd always have this gag with a big fat one named Mimsy.</br>  <br>And join the family that produced this asshole?</br>  <br>Is Kishi trying to make Sakura the most hated woman in manga?</br>  <br>sarada's gonna fight the girl.</br>  <br>see<br><br> doesn't even share his fries with his dad <br>Worse than Hitler.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aside from all arguements about him having no sex drive, lets stick to the only way he does show affection, which is apparently that forehead poke thing. <br><br>In the last chapter of Gaiden, he showed that he apparently felt something for Salad by giving her the poke, and Sakura just stood there like a dog that was begging for affection. Sasuke looks her dead in the face and turns away without even saying anything. If that doesn't prove he doesn't give a shit about Sakura, I don't know what does</br></br></br>  <br>Boruto is in his tryhard phase where he thinks that being edgy is cool.</br>  <br>That's not really a twist, just a low point to show off the big problem that will get resolved. Straightforward.<br>Shame the fist-bump scene got spoiled.</br></br>  <br> sarada's gonna fight the girl. <br>Sarada is not going to be part of the rescue mission. Its just the Five Kages+Sasuke+Bort</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sure and Boruto is really Sakura's and Naruto's son.<br><br>Please fuck off with your shipping.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do most kids even know the identity of the person who delivered them?</br>  <br> baby's first tsundere </br>  <br> girl </br>  <br>I dunno, Sarada seems so far to be the best behaved next gen kid and her only problem with Pink is that she hugs too hard</br>  <br>Kishi said he was surprised by Sakura's unpopularity and that a little girl once told him she hated Sakura. His response was to try and draw Sakura prettier. <br>Kishi view of females is shallow and it shows through Sakura.</br></br>  <br> Shame the fist-bump scene got spoiled <br> implying he's not a ghost </br></br>  <br> Implying women aren't shallow 99% of the time </br>  <br>Holy shit karin was kinda mature and cool in gaiden</br>  <br>I know the name of the nurse who delivered me since they also named me.<br><br>And besides that Karin essentially saved Sakura and Sarada's life.</br></br></br>  I just remembered that Karen was an Uzumaki. What the hell was the point of that? She wasn't connected to Naruto in any significant way.<br><br> Salad was an Uchiha/Haruno that looked like an Uzumaki </br></br>  <br>Tsundere would actually have to imply that Sasuke gives a shit about her. He doesn't. He's just disinterested.</br>  <br> being this defensive <br>SShit pls</br></br>  <br>We know Sasuke can smile and yet I don't remember him smiling during that family dinner or portrait. It felt like he was only there for Sarada's sake.</br>  <br>I'm still a little sore about that to be honest. Kishi's trying to build them up as rivals but Salad's gonna get shafted in the movie and her dream of being Hokage will never be taken seriously.<br><br>That and I'd like to see some teamwork between these two. Who knows - maybe Kishi will surprise us by bringing his full suite of SN POTTERY instead of just Bort and his two daddies?</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't surprised by her unpopluarity (he's known about it for a while). He was just surprised by the level of dislike that she got.<br><br>He's been aware of the fact that she's shit for a while.</br></br></br>  <br> Naruto <br> Dying </br></br>  <br>He does, though. You're just so salty to acknowledge it.</br>  <br>I don't deny the tsun, but when has Sasuke ever acted dere towards Sakura?</br>  <br> and her only problem with Pink is that she hugs too hard <br> implying she's not trying to kill her </br></br>  <br>I can't wait for edgy Himawari when hormones kick in. Hinata obviously sucks as a mother.</br>  <br> Guy attempts to kill girl multiple times. <br> tells her to fuck off multiple times <br> h-he's just a tsundere <br><br>This is how SxSfags think a relationship should be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and that a little girl once told him she hated Sakura </br>  <br>Sakurahaters ruined the threads, don't bother to reason with them. They are still mad Naruto got cucked.</br>  <br> Salad was an Uchiha/Haruno that looked like an Uzumaki <br><br>She looks like an Uchiha.</br></br></br>  <br> holy shit you actually don't remember that time when i mistook you for naruto and shit talked orphans evne tho you're one and then you call me annoying <br> i was just pretending to be retarded, you're REALLY annoying <br> sakura then creamed herself and sasuke gave her the P </br></br></br>  <br> he dies <br> Bort begins his quest to find the 7 Ninja Balls to bring him back <br> it never ends </br></br></br>  <br>The real reason she looks like Karin is that Kishi just made a female Sauce without remembering that that's exactly the same thing he did with Karin.<br>Then when people asked about it, he welcomed the new plot idea to his bosom.</br></br>  <br>Actually all they seem to care about is sex. You should have seen how quickly they disowned Salad as soon as the DNA test showed up.</br>   if Shizune actually bothered to say "Oh, your mother just gave birth outside of the village and was helped by a common friend of her and Sasuke", none of this shit would have happened <br><br>Konoha ninjas are kinda stupid.</br></br>  <br> Bort didn't get a Byakugan because now only the villains get Byakugans </br>  <br>Sakurafags still mad that their self-insert is a pathetic excuse for a person.<br><br>Tell me does the fact that Naruto married a girl who is more attractive than Sakura and porked her before Sakura got together with Sasuke still rile you up? Or the fact that Sakura is homeless and forever alone, with Sasuke not giving a shit about her?</br></br></br>  <br>Other than glasses Sarada looks like Sasuke+Sakura.</br>  <br>Everyone in the Gaiden had a go with the Idiot Ball.</br>  <br>Does Sakura even have fans that aren't just using Sakura as a self-insert?</br>  <br> I'm still a little sore about that to be honest. <br>I'm not. We already got the Gaiden full of Sarada's shit<br> Kishi's trying to build them up as rivals but Salad's gonna get shafted in the movie <br>Because Kishi is either:<br>a) a hack<br>b) cant break his own formula<br>The Gaiden and the movie should've been about the new gen kids doing shit, with the adults making a cameo or two, not the shit we got in the gaiden, with "muh team 7" taking the lead and Sarada (and chocho) tagging along<br> her dream of being Hokage will never be taken seriously. <br>We will never see anyone else as Hokage, Naruto will be the last one. Sarada "I want to be hokage" shit is just something to contrast Bort edgy character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Momo is a faggot but I kinda like Kin.<br> inb4 barafag </br></br>  <br>calm the fuck down, silly shipper, you have mistaken /a/ for tumblr</br>  <br> They are still mad Naruto got cucked <br> this is what SSfags actually believe </br></br>  <br>Hamura was a good man.</br>  <br> this projecting </br>  <br>SScunts still buttmad that Hinata was the heroine of the movie and got a passionate kissing scene whereas their self-insert couldn't even get so much as a poke after decades.</br>  <br>At least they're not trying to marry her this time. <br><br>Her husband, on the other hand...</br></br></br>  <br>Hate? <br><br>More like feel incredibly bad for.</br></br></br>  <br>And until he shows up to be Bort's spirit animal like Hagoromo did with Naruto, only the villains will get Byakugans. Hell, even if he does show up, he'll just show up with a Tenseigan.</br>  <br>Don't be blaming muh waifu! <br><br>This is all on the girl who could even remember if Sauce wore glasses or not. Also, it would have been rude for Shizune to talk about it behind pink's back...muh waifu has class and doesn't do stuff like that.</br></br></br>  <br> We will never see anyone else as Hokage, Naruto will be the last one. <br>So much this. I can't see a legit part III happening.</br></br>  <br>Sasuke is too much of an asshole to openly show affection to anyone, even everything he said about Naruto in 698 &amp; 699 was an internal monologue.<br><br>For fucks sake it took the most adorable character in the Naruto universe to get him to hug.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want you and your kind to get the fuck out from here. Shippers are the cancer of this fanbase.</br>  <br>exactly, we don't get normies because people who give a shit about bleach are so scarce<br>It's nice</br></br>  <br>Actually, they're pretty butthurt they can't use Nurudu as the useless third wheel pathetically pining for Sakura anymore.<br><br>They are truly pathetic people. Which is why you should stop arguing with them.</br></br></br>  <br> I can't see a legit part III happening <br> he doesn't know that Nurudu prints money <br>It'll be the next DBZ. Just watch.</br></br></br>  <br> claims that someone else is a shipper <br> is the only one trying to argue for his ship <br><br>SxSfag who do you think you're fooling?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he didn't get it because neither Naruto nor Sasuke have it.</br>  <br>OP is next DB<br>Naruto will be the next Saint Seiya with multiple spin-off by different authors.</br></br>  <br>I could see SP doing some form of continuation or Last-era story but not Kishi himself.</br>  <br> Naruto Super </br>  <br> Not even a word about ships <br> Y-you're just like me! I can't be the only one this pathetic <br>Whatever makes you happy.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind a little filler if they decide to animate the Gaiden. Just so we can see what everyone else is doing amidst the Uchiha Maury-tier drama.</br>  <br>Kishi pls.</br>  <br> Naruto will be the next Saint Seiya with multiple spin-off by different authors. <br>Also Kurumada (Saint Seiya author) and Kishimoto seem to have a hard-on for "muh paralulz!!"<br>I actually would like that, anyone that could write better than Kishi (which is not hard) should be in charge of this series, so much wasted potential.</br></br></br>  <br> this level of projection <br>The only person whose been talking about ships is you picking out one post of many while trying to defend SxSfaggotry.<br><br>I'm legitimately laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto isn't as popular as it used to be. Sure they're going to make tons of films but my point is that we ain't gonna see Sarada's Susanoo etc.</br>  <br>Sure, calling you and your kind out for being cancerous is defending that ship. Makes sense.</br>  <br><br><br>Even if there is a part III, it still would not end with anyone other than Naruto in the Hokage seat.</br></br></br>  <br> this projecting <br><br>Anon you're just embarrassing yourself now.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta hand it to Kishi unlike Toriyama he really knows how to kill his own series.<br><br>That war arc tired the fuck out of everyone.</br></br></br>  <br> ain't gonna see Sarada's Susanoo <br>Good, she really should not get beyond the eventual three tomoe sharingan and instead get something of her own (please no medic jobbing).</br></br>  <br> (please no medic jobbing) <br> implying Pink Shit 2.0 will be anything other than a healslut </br></br>  <br>Anyone defending Sakura is shipping cancer because no one likes Sakura except shipperfags. <br>Everyone else doesn't give a fuck if people shit on characters.</br></br>  <br> Miko Susanoo. <br>UCHIHAS UP IN FLAMES<br>GOD BLESS TOBIRAMA.</br></br></br>  <br>You know, as a kid I always wanted to see a character who could into Chidori and Rasengan. <br><br>I just never thought that it'd be Nurudu's fucking son who does it.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about I never defended that shit? You're the one who tried to defend it.</br>  <br>Yeah, the War Arc caused a huge drop in popularity for Naruto, and rightfully so, it was incredibly bad.</br>  <br> I always wanted to see a character who could into Chidori and Rasengan <br> what is Kakashi </br></br>  <br>It's much to late for that, it was over the minute she went hulk smash.</br>  <br>At least it was as bad Bleach.<br>Naruto never really dropped from the top tier in the ranking</br></br>  <br>I really don't know what he was thinking with the whole war thing.<br>It didn't address anything that's wrong with war besides 'people on our side (good guys) died'. He could feasibly have pulled something interesting, with the war being waged between nations with actual people on both sides, with small fights fit for ninjas, with a series of timeskips to show off the attrition of it all. <br>Or something other than three years of killing plant people clones and zombies of previously interesting characters brought back from the dead, all of which happened over the course of like two days in-manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Madara was our beacon in the storm but even he couldn't hold back the tide of sewage that was about to be dumped on everyone and everything.</br>  <br>Are you mentally handicapped? I didn't even mention Sakura. I just want you to find a better place for discussing ships (tumblr).</br>  <br>She doesn't look like Karin. She looks like her dad with glasses because Kishi faps to sasuce.</br>  <br>No thanks. I'm having too much fun trashing Sakura and her shitty ships right here.</br>  <br>Then your reading comprehension is shit. The only one defending the SxS shit was you.</br>  <br>It depends on how long this shit runs and if Bort is going to stay as the official SasuNaru kid.</br>  <br>I think he meant at the same time. As in combined.</br>  <br> Kishi faps to sasuce. <br><br> Boruto is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke <br> Sarada is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura <br><br>Kishi really loves that edgy bastard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>true cancer of naruto threads.</br></br>  <br>The war arc was just pointless and unnecessary. The War arc and Uchiha shit killed the manga, and I find that shit funny.</br>  <br>Before we found out her hair was red, everyone thought Karin was a female version of Sasuke.</br>  <br> Boruto is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke <br>He isn't, he's just a copy of Naruto, he has nothing of Sasuke in him</br></br>  <br>Ignore them. It's impossible to argue with that kind of people.</br>  <br> Himawari isn't a combination of Sauce so she's forever fodder </br>   focuses on kids <br> Chuunin Exams <br> fewer characters to give screentime <br> no Uchiha DARKNESS <br> Salad <br> Dadruto <br> Metal fucking Lee <br> a new technique and a chance for Sauce to not be a complete piece of shit <br> theme by KANA BOON <br> good director <br> co-written by Gaara Hiden author <br><br> retarded ayylien bullshit <br> Rinnegan <br> somewhat unlikable protagonist  <br> high chance of everyone but Bort and his two daddies getting shafted <br> Kishi's most heavily involved project <br> including head writer <br><br>Is there hope, /a/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It stinks</br>  <br>Yes, because the Naruto series is such a masterpiece it deserves only the most refined and in depth discussion.</br>  <br>Is this baby's first time on a Naruto thread on /a/? Is baby unhappy that no one likes their shitty ship and characters?</br>  Who on gods green earth decided it was a good idea to trust Kabuto with children?<br><br>There wasn't even sorry no jutsu involved</br></br>  <br>Wel, Hinata is proto-female sasuke.</br>  <br>Kishi doesn't fap to Sasuke, he faps to his doujins of him and Sasuke.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy fucking shit,it sure is summer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Sakura represents the view kishi has of women, he must think they are shallow bitches.<br><br>I wonder if kishi actually likes Sakura himself.</br></br></br>  <br>He has chidori and Sasuke's headband.</br>  <br> She doesn't look like Karin <br><br><br> drawing up Salad <br> design gets approved <br> start drawing panels for the manga <br> wait a second <br> this kid looks just like Karin <br> fuck <br> o-oh well m-maybe nobody will notice <br> chapter 700 comes out <br> holy shit this kid looks just like Karin <br> maybe Karin's the real mom <br> Sauce isn't even around <br> fuck <br> wait a second <br> this gives me an idea for a spinoff <br> Naruto Gaiden happens <br>Pretty much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is there hope, /a/? <br>No<br><br> He has chidori <br>He isnt, he has a lightning based rasengan<br> Sasuke's headband <br>Only at the end of the movie, during the final confrontation.<br>Personality wise he is nothing like Sasuke, he has nothing of him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He has admitted that she was a terrible human being, and she also is worst girl.</br>  <br> I wonder if kishi actually likes Sakura himself. <br><br>If he didn't he wouldn't have had one of the two relevant next gen kids be a combination of her and sauce.</br></br></br>  <br> Sarada is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura <br>The shame will never wash off.</br></br>  <br>It's okay, he's been brainwashed.</br>  <br>He said he liked her a number of times. Because he's his most realistic character.<br><br>You're taking out of context what he said about the fail confession.</br></br></br>  <br> He isnt <br> learns a Chidori thing from Sauce <br> later on combines it with Rasengan to kill fusion Momo and Kin </br></br></br>  <br>He's said that he's liked her a number of times, but he has also admitted that she was shit a number of times too.</br>  <br>Blue kid keeps confusing me because he looks increadibly Gaara. Is he the child of an existing couple like everyone else or is he new?</br>  I miss best character. thankfully Kishi didnt revive him as to rape his character into oblivion.<br><br> Dont give me that bullshit like Kabuto couldnt reach Jirayia for Edo Tensei. Hiruzen seald Hashirama and Tobirama in the Reaper Death Seal, which was supposed to make sure they never appeared again. Hell Hiruzen and Minato also got absorbed by the Reaper Death Seal.....yet ALL FOUR OF THEM came back. </br></br>  For fucks sake i really wanted ninja storm 4 to be the last, definitve game, but now you just know they'll make more using material from the gaiden manga and movies. FFFFFF.  <br> but now you just know they'll make more using material from the gaiden manga and movies <br> what is DLC </br></br>  <br>where in the fuck do you see a chidori in that gif? do you remember what a chidori looks like?</br>  <br>It would be nice to think they'd just add shit with DLC, but they won't.</br>  <br>Is Ninja Storm more popular than the series itself?</br>  <br>Kishimoto actually made both a good character and a riveting plot, but jobbed both of them as he's wont to do.<br><br>Any news on Sarada's moveset?</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know who his parents are. Considering it's a Kishi-tier mystery, it'll be something retardedly obvious like Kabuto/Orochimaru/Toneri. <br><br>I mean, for fuck sakes the kid has pale skin, white hair, yellow eyes and can stretch his body. He's also the perfect Orochimaru pottery to neo Team 7, who are basically the next generation of Sannin.</br></br></br>  <br>No, but it's better. The best thing about Naruto is the characterts,the plot is shit, but the characters and jutsus make for a fun fitan game.</br>  <br>Obito didn't want Kabuto to become that powerful, so he probably retrieved Jiraiya and Konan's corpses for... medical curiosity.</br>  <br> I wonder if kishi actually likes Sakura himself. <br>He left her hanging and made her daughter look more like Karin then her. He always trashes her after giving her a moment to shine.<br>If anything, he loves to use her as a punching bag and the butt of the joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Kishi really missed his calling just being a character designer.</br>  <br> what are Chidori variants <br>Bort probably doesn't learn the vanilla version because no Sharingan. <br><br>Think, stupid. It's not his special move because the sky's blue and he's wearing his black/magenta outfit and not his POTTERY one. Obviously he'll use the combined version against the big bad for the finale.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked cho cho.</br>  <br>Remember when he took all of Naruto's hard earned money and spent it all on ninja prostitutes?<br> <br>Or when he only started giving a shit about his "godson" when he seduced him with his female form?<br><br>Or how he spent 3 years with him and never told him shit about the parents who loved him and died to save him?<br><br>Or how he threw him into a ravine and hoped he didn't die?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's acting "real", he likes her character.</br>  <br> Any news on Sarada's moveset? <br>Nigga, she punches things. Probably a clone of Sakura with some minor Sharingan tech and maybe a Katon or two. <br><br><br>Actually, characters from both The Last and Boruto are pre-order incentives so there's a good chance the movies will be released as DLC packs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 doujins of trap momoxmitsukixbolt </br>  <br>To be fair the actual universe is pretty nice too<br><br>I mean you give me an mmo<br>Where I can make my own ninja<br>Where I can pick his clan and his fighting style and his jutsu<br>Where I burn through the ranks from a child soldier to a legitimate spy/sassin in the middle of a centuries long blood feud between all the villages<br><br>I will eat that shit up<br>Of course I guess it would be a bit stale having my powers be fairly generic and similar to everyone else s instead of being able to gradually turn my body into a string puppet or vomit paper tags</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Obito didn't want Kabuto to become that powerful <br>But he let him revive fucking Madara, thus ruining the whole ruse they'd created for some retarded reason?</br></br>  <br> what are Chidori variants <br>Something we never saw? Its easier to suppose that he's using a new technique.<br>In any case, a technique doesnt mean anything. He still doesnt have anything of Sasuke in him, he is 100% a Naruto clone</br></br></br>  <br>Well shit, better make sure I pre order on steam when this goes up.</br>  <br> He always trashes her after giving her a moment to shine. <br>To be fair he does tend to do that with a lot of characters. Hinata always has something uplifting/good about her character shining through, then it gets fucked lest it become inevitable that she makes some progress with Naruto in the main manga.<br>Supporting cast tend to get introduced with a bit of fanfare and something that might even be interesting, then they get starved for development as Kishi makes a new supporting character to get to the next plot point.</br></br></br>  <br>He called her character the epitome of human weakness. He is well aware of the fact that she's shit, in fact she was mean to be that way.<br><br>Hence why none of the other female characters are as shit as she is.</br></br></br>  <br>That is a cool idea but the problem is, everyone just ends up using the same OP moveset just like they do in DB Xenoverse.</br>  <br> Or how he spent 3 years with him and never told him shit about the parents who loved him and died to save him? <br>Well he couldn't even remember Kushina's name in shippuden. <br><br>Also I believe jiraiya was looking into orochimaru and the akatsuki while nardo was being bullied by the village so kishi will probably try to spin that as jiraiya trying to protect naruto by keeping an eye on orochimaru and his cronies. In the end it was just dumb to make him naruto's godfather, kishi should have just left that out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If not even the girls who read his manga liked Sakura, then his 'real' portrayal was shit.</br>  <br>I hope we get to see the skinnier version. I like me some slim chocolate.</br>  <br>I agree, when do you go back to school?</br>  <br>That's different other characters get pushed to the sidelines because they're irrelevant side characters. Sakura gets pushed the sidelines violently because she's shit.</br>  <br>Friendly reminder that Sauce is going to be the most successful teacher in Nurudu.</br>  <br> so there's a good chance the movies will be released as DLC packs <br>Revolution didn't come out that much before The Last yet there was no such tie-in. To my knowledge the studio hasn't done an expansion like that before, they tend to just make up new costumes, sell it for £10 and call it a day.</br></br>  <br>So he pulled a Sasuke before that was even a thing?<br><br>At least Sarada didn't have to seduce Sasuke to get him to pay attention to her.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get both. I like chubby characters but I have a feeling cho cho'd be pretty hot slim.</br>   post yfw Kishimoto starts a new manga like Mario   hello there. this breads seems good enough to ask...<br>one of the guys, i know, is insisting that i should watch shippuuden but i hate waiting one week for each episode. since manga is finished i'd like to ask how far is the anime compared to manga and what's the estimated number of episodes left<br>i googled a bit but all such questions are few months old so yeah</br></br>  <br> Something we never saw? <br> what is literally everything Sasuke was doing up until MS </br></br>  <br> Naruto, the mmo <br>It's a cool idea but imagine the community.</br></br>  <br>Not really, Boruto was already a genius and had the access to the knowledge of high level jutsu. He's not teaching him from scratch.</br>  <br>Narutards really are cancer.<br><br>Just checking the filenames and you can see that it is the same samefags spamming their shit threads,</br></br></br>  <br> Gets his hand on a kid that's a fucking prodigy <br> Kid turns out to be pretty badass <br> "Yep, I am the best teacher, me the sauce" <br> "D-dad is that you?" <br> *Teleports* </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have some more Boruto x Mitsuki instead</br>  <br> implying <br>He probably wanted Sakura to be likable and then made up some bullshit about weakness when people started hating her guts.<br><br><br>Fatty's on the box so you're getting both. She'll probably slim up in her battle against Mitsuki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is supposed to be the female protagonist, not just a side-character. Yet, she is never given the same importance that Naruto and Sasuke have. Kishi had her constantly wanting to be on their level, but it never happened. She also never had her own character arc.</br>  <br>It couldnt be any worse than DBXenoverse with all the edgy Saiyians and Namekians</br>  <br> Salad doing the Obito laugh </br>  <br>He said that she was the epitome of human weakness before her popularity took a nose dive. Face it she was meant to be shit, he just wanted her to be liked regardless of that shit. In a way it worked but not in the way he hoped.</br>  <br> At least Sarada didn't have to seduce Sasuke to get him to pay attention to her. <br>Don't be an idiot, Jiraiya gave way more attention to naruto than sauce ever did and will do to Salad.</br></br>    <br>I hear he finished that. Was it any good?</br>  <br>So based.</br>  <br>And the Gohans.<br><br>All the fucking GOHANs</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, so he made a throwing chidori?<br>My second point still stands, 100% Naruto clone</br></br>  <br>It's over.</br>  <br> Probably a clone of Sakura with some minor Sharingan tech and maybe a Katon or two. <br>Anon pls. This is the last step to confirm how much of a jobber she is.</br></br>  <br> 100% Naruto clone <br> doesn't act anything like his father </br></br>  <br><br>Didn't they announce Naruto Online last year?</br></br>  <br>Depends on what you prefer I guess, edgy saiyans or edgy uchihas. I was mostly thinking the game would have a community of people that actually think the manga is good.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br>I'd prefer a single-play RPG, something in the style of Jade Empire, just with more customisation and a more refined system.</br>  <br> What is chidori nagashi? </br>  <br> or edgy uchihas <br> all the countless Mary Sue nothin personnel kid Uchiha OCs it would no doubt create </br></br>  <br>bump for spoonfeeding</br>  <br>Sakura could have been redeemed if she had her own character arc and goals and motivations outside m-muh Team 7. Also could have shown her family and relationships with other characters like Ino or Lee to make her more likable.</br>  <br>Its a one shot.</br>  No coolest guy, no Madara, no Ninja Hitler, barely any homolust.<br>3/10, because shipping wars</br>  <br>He neither acts like Sasuke</br>  <br> I just realized there are people who love the sharingan and think its awesome <br> Oh it's got even more powers that's so cool! <br><br> I actually liked it back when it just copied powers and enhanced reaction speed. Mega man uchiha would be the coolest guy </br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody ever said he did. If anything he's more reminiscent of Neji with a duller edge.</br>  <br>Kamui was cool. Imbalanced as all hell, but cool</br>  <br>I can see it<br> Himawari: SHE WAS THE COOLEST GAL. </br></br>  <br> I actually liked it back when it just copied powers and enhanced reaction speed <br>I liked it up to MS because every one was unique with its own design. But then shit got stupid with Susanoo and Rinnegan and everyone just sorta lost sight (unintentional) of the plot.</br></br>  <br><br>The anime is fucking trash and absolutely unwatchable. Read the manga or wait a few years for a reboot without fillers.<br><br>Right now the Anime really has turned into a clusterfuck of fillers.<br><br>A few years ago there was a ballance in it at least. Two cannon arcs, one filler arc, two cannon arcs and so on. But now it is literally random pre time skip filler episodes inbetween fights EVERY FUCKING MONTH so there is absolutely no way to watch the anime without this stupid interruptions. <br><br>Manga ended on volume 72, the anime is in the end of volume 69 right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is /a/ so obsessed with Sakura? She's almost all that's talked about in these threads. Are you guys really this mad about a single character?     Burrito movie filler 1 hour special <br> The Thing That Was Inherited  <br> it's about Nurudu teaching Konohamaru the Rasengan <br> who then most likely teaches it to Boruto </br></br></br>  <br>  If they hate her enough no one will know of the huge boner they had for her in middle school. </br>  <br>For a lot of us she was our first experience of how shit women are.</br>  <br>i was expecting some fillers but not this many...<br>anyway: thx for the info</br></br>  <br>This sounds about right.<br><br>So she actually caused you pain in your life? Some people act like she killed their puppy or something.</br></br></br>  <br> changing stages is a game mechanic <br>mite b cool <br><br>So that's why they've incorporated the new elemental system.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fun to talk about characters you hate and despise, it's just venting.</br>  <br> barely any homolust <br>That was weird, you'd expect a roadtrip between Naruto and Sasuke to have more of it. Instead Naruto is too concerned about Sarada not thinking her dad is the coolest guy and Sasuke is too concerned about killing Shin and saving his kid's babysitter to give a shit about each other.<br><br>Let's just hope it stays that way for "Bort has two dads, The Movie"</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've said this before, I'll say it again: she is like Wesley Crusher/Neelix or Jar Jar Binks, but with malicious selfish bitchiness instead of retarded self-important antics or being a bland wonderchild.</br>  <br> 1 hour of Rasengan <br>Jesus, at least give the supporting cast a chance.<br><br>I want to see Sarada trying to find modest clothing in her house<br>Shikadai getting his shit pushed in at Shogi<br>Inojin being confused about the mind control stuff<br>Chou trying to jew food and snacks from her mom</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So she actually caused you pain in your life? <br>No, but for me it just kinda clicked one day that she was a terrible human being.</br></br>  Why didn't Kishi take the whole "Karin is Salads mom" shit all the way? Salad could have easily been an experiment made by Oro and it would have made more sense why everyone was staying hush hush about it. Now everyone just looks like a fucking retard over "hur misunderstandings" bullshit.  <br>But Sakura isn't malicious at all. And Naruto is no better, but you don't see people hating on him constantly. <br><br>In what way is she a terrible human being?</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you get it?<br>Only Indra is the homosexual.</br></br>  <br>It's not set in the movie's time period, anon. It's a flashback episode. <br><br>Still, after Hyuuga Loli Power Hour for The Last I'm willing to give it a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure its the same one, but I play a Naruto MMO by the name of Unlimited Ninja. Its absolute shit and pay to win as hell. I mean, you can get ahead by not paying money, but you get ahead by paying, and if someone gets ahead by those means, then you basically just lose to everyone forever. <br><br> I only play it because shitty anime MMOs are one of my guilty pleasures </br></br></br>  <br>Schadenfreude. It's fun to joke about her and see how hated she is.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127842493 <br> naruto is as bad as pedophile circlejerking: the thread <br>yeah no</br></br>  <br>Because he doesn't want some forgotten joke character to be related to his new Uchiha waifu.</br>  <br>what if sakura was replaced with jar jar binks?</br>  <br>Anon, if you don't understand now you probably never will. <br><br><br>Too risky. SS is the biggest hetero ship in Japan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone was busy fapping to Hinata or Ino. I can't remember Sakura ever being popular with male readers, except NSfags but they were always a joke.</br>  <br>Then why did he make Sakura the mom?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127842563 <br>said the pedophile</br>  <br>I guess I just can't bring myself to hate a character so much. Then again, I never disliked Sakura in the first place so whatever.</br>  <br>Meesa wanta forehead poka too!</br>  <br> Neelix <br>I actually like him in later seasons, when he's comedic relief. He didn't deserve that qt though.</br></br>  <br> Hinata or Ino <br>my nigga, but you have to admit there are some really really good tsunade, sakura, anko and temari doujins</br></br>  <br>Because she's a more relevant forgotten joke character than Karin.</br>  <br>Sakura is extremely popular for fapping anon. She's extremely attractive.</br>  <br>Kishi has failed to actually gain any proper taste or consistency writing arcs</br>  <br> but you have to admit there are some really really good tsunade, sakura, anko and temari doujins <br>The Temari and Shizune ones are the best. The rest are eh. Sakura and Tsunade are usually shit.</br></br>    <br>Kishi is a hack. Simple as that.</br>  <br> She's extremely attractive <br> no tits <br> no ass <br> fivehead <br> looks like a boy <br> shit design </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anko <br>Man, don't remind me about that travesty.</br></br>  <br> Sakura and Tsunade are usually shit. <br>nah all the new stuff is shit, the old ones were gold. Theses "lol xD I make the boobs as big as her whole upper body"-doujins are the worst.</br></br>  <br>  dum-bass <br><br>that's some quality typesetting there</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I hate to break it to you, but Kishi actually likes Sakura. <br><br>The number of doujins she has speak for itself.</br></br></br>  <br> The number of doujins she has speak for itself <br> quality = quantity <br>I'm in a fucking nurutu thread but even I can smell your shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>The sakura ones are all her being a cum slut.<br>And i love it</br></br>  <br>He's wearing naruto's jacket and sasuke's headband, wow.</br>  <br>doujins when?</br>  <br>I'm still butthurt that my Shizune doujin has her henge into Sakura for half of it</br>  <br>Well, self-centered and obsessive to a flaw and endangering to people around her would be a more precise way of putting it.<br>She is a badly written character with a horrible personality that the author for whatever reason want you to like, hates you for not liking and which he will continue pushing in your face, exploring whole new aspects of how fucking shit they are in the process, hoping at some point you'll warm up to them.<br>I've mentioned Wesley and Jar Jar but the closest a character gets to Sakura's function in the manga in any media I've ever enjoyed is Neelix, at least to me. Those two got dialled down/removed at least whereas Pinkshit and Neelix had very stupid and untalented people writing them, so there was nothing for it but for them to keep on shoving the character in people's face.<br><br> Naruto is no better <br>How so, precisely? He certainly has faults (with some good reasons behind them most of the time), but he does grow as a character and by the Gaiden is a based as fuck father and authority figure.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did that get an official translation yet?</br>  <br>If it's any consolation prize he had more fun when it was Shizune. <br><br><br>Hopefully never. Nurudu should probably just stop getting doujins. They're all terrible nowadays.</br></br></br></br>  Wait, is the new season over?<br><br>  T_T  </br></br>  <br> that nostalgia fap <br>she still looked hot tough  because even sakura was drawn pretty good </br></br>  <br>The following things cannot all simultaneously be true. Which are the false statements?<br><br>  Kishi is being honest when he says he likes Sakura <br>  Kishi voluntarily wrote all the Sakura crowning moments, including the fake-fession <br>  Kishi has an understanding of human beings that is not completely batshit insane </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After watching how the Ashura reincarnations still consider their Indra counterparts the most important people in their lives. I really doubt that.</br>  I don't think I'll ever get over how retarded Borts SS hair looks. I've seen fanart children that look better then him.  <br>It's over. All that's left is the movie. <br><br>Unless that special announcement on the 7th is another series. Then it'll never end.</br></br></br>  <br>I never found her attractive except for in The Last, but even then I still found other female characters more attractive.<br>All the doujin's of her are inflation, ahegao, or gang rape trash.</br></br>  <br>You don't need to be so mad anon, just because a lot of people fap to Sakura doesn't mean you have to.<br><br>Naruto is just as obsessive and selfish as her. He could have saved everyone a load of trouble if he just accepted that Sasuke was evil as fuck but he was just as obsessed with him as Sakura was. Sakura saved shitloads of people during the war(including Naruto) and is one of the strongest ninja in the world. She even opened a clinic for kids in Konoha so that no kids would turn out crazy anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Believe it or not, I actually like the banana peel. A lot of thought went into it.</br>  <br>It takes time getting used to it, because he pretty much is Naruto with a different hairstyle.</br>  <br>Anon, there is a great disconnect between show and tell when it comes to Sakura. Kishi can tell us whatever he wants about her, but when he actually shows her, she's an abhorrent human being. <br><br>Now will you just shut up? Nobody wants to discuss Pink.</br></br></br>  <br> The number of doujins she has speak for itself. <br>Most of her doujins are sunahara wataru level garbage. Nothing to be proud of.</br></br>  <br>He likes Sakura and actually doesn't understand why people dislike her. He said that if she had given up on Sasuke she would have been a weak woman.</br>  <br>True</br>  <br>The third one obviously.</br>  <br> He said that if she had given up on Sasuke she would have been a weak woman <br>Kind of. He said she'd be a terrible person if she abandoned the Sauce and jumped on Nurudu's dick after he became famous. He has a very low opinion of groupies apparently. Can't blame him. Parasites.</br></br>  <br>You're discussing her right now.<br><br>In your opinion. The number of people fapping to them says otherwise though.</br></br></br>  <br>meanwhile we have 774</br>  <br> &gt; Kishi voluntarily wrote all the Sakura crowning moments, including the fake-fession <br> &gt; Kishi has an understanding of human beings that is not completely batshit insane <br>These 2 go hand in hand. Anyone who understands humans and human relationships would know Sakura is insane in the brain for clinging to a dude that tried to kill her more than once. Kishi still tries to present her as a sane person thus he obviously does not understand how humans work.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Kishi hates any of his characters, but he is emotionally retarded and thinks people only hate Sakura because she wasn't pretty enough.</br>    <br> a lot of discount foods went into it </br>  <br> clinging to a dude that tried to kill her more than once <br><br>Doesn't Naruto do the exact same thing?</br></br></br>  <br>This here is the Mangastream version, but i dont have anything official.<br>Are there crunchyroll scans of chapter 687?</br></br>  <br><br> Naruto can destroy entire countries <br> Couple of plebs think they can kidnap him </br></br></br>  <br><br>I miss the pale lavender eyes he had in his first anime character design. He looks TOO much like Naruto now.</br></br>  <br>It's not, you're just blinded by hatred of a character and cannot discuss objectively.</br>  <br>i think banana peel is some kinda related to kurama since there are 9 of these</br>  <br>The only thing I liked him in was when Tuvok used a holodeck version of him to live out his most violent, homicidal side.<br>Having a scene like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nVd<wbr>H1GomPTk</wbr>  [ ] to in some way acknowledge what a cunt Sakura is, just once could have been a welcome change of pace. But nope, she's an insufferable, traitorous cunt whom everyone constantly loves and praises because the author wants you to like her and isn't good enough to improve her to a state where she can be liked.<br><br>Come to think of it, one episode where Voyager is stuck in some pocket universe and Neelix helps out with scavanging and a little bit with diplomacy, does so competently and within his place, was pretty good. Largely because it took a step back looked at the character and assessed what they can and should do in a productive manner. <br>Likewise I am okay with Sakura in the Last too, because she is more of a support character, her contribution is a mix of healing and fighting instead of being butthurt over not hogging the limelight and she does things for the benefit of people other than herself, almost like a decent human being.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, that means Hinata was the sole participant of the ramenb owl?</br>  <br>Which is looking pretty good by all accounts. NH doesn't get enough smut. Not that it needs it.</br>  <br>They do.<br><br>Sasuke has to lead a mission to rescue his ass.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The animation was terrible last episode....I don't know how they are dropping the ball this hard at such a crucial point in the series</br></br>  The Gaiden was pointless.  <br>He does, Sakura haters are just completely delusional.</br>  <br> another rabbit goddess <br>Just the villain we needed right ?</br></br>  <br>It served to set give Sarada some backstory and give insight into the new Uchiha family(Sasuke, Sarada, Sakura)</br>  <br>Most of Sakura's doujins are humiliation or rape fetishes which implies people get off on her being used and tossed aside like a cum dumpster.<br>The people fapping to doujins generally don't give a fuck about the characters or the series in the first place.</br></br>  <br> Doesn't Naruto do the exact same thing? <br>He doesn't, he wants to save Sasuke. If you can't see how that's different from wanting his fucking babies than you're an idiot.</br></br>  <br>naruto has some sort of nip honoru complex thing going on about maintaining his stupid promise, and he says repeatedly he feels like a kindred spirit to Dr. Snakes.<br><br>meanwhile, over 15 years and 700 chapters, pink shit's attraction is never even close to explained as beyond anything but a one-sided crush that escalated to the point of insanity.</br></br></br>  <br>Meh. It hardly matters.<br><br><br> 9 tails like Kushina <br> blonde like dad and granddad <br> looks like Hinata's part 1 hair if it was spiked  <br>The headband kinda fucks up the last part by making everything too high, but it's actually my favorite hair design of all the new characters. Some thought actually went into it if you can believe that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His hair is too weirdly clustered together for my liking. Also that flat ahoge is completely out of place and stupid looking.</br>  <br><br>Sakura wants to save Sasuke for the same reasons as Naruto, she just happens to love him as well.</br></br>  <br>Naruto has the excuse that they are soul brothers and he actually effected Sasuke on some level. Naruto doesn't want to start a family with him, just set him on the right path.<br>Sakura's motivations were more selfish. Read her confessions. She always made it more about herself</br></br>  <br>Lavender eyes get in the way of making Boruto and Sarada's eye fucking look their dads'.<br><br>And guess which option would Kishi rather pick between making Boruto resemble Hinata just a little bit or making sure he can wank more to SN?</br></br></br>  Is it ok to the sunflower yet?  <br>You're gonna hate this but they probably put most of it into the movie tie-in special.<br><br><br>Pointless, yet fun. There were better ways to give Salad her dream, though. A dream that she'll ultimately never reach because as far as we know we've finally reached the end of the road.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto still considers Sasuke his BFF and by far one of the most important people in his life.<br><br>He doens't give a shit about the promise.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura wanted to abandon her family and village just to run away with Sasuke. Naruto wanted to stop Sasuke from doing bad shit.<br>Huge difference.</br></br>  <br> she just happens to love him as well <br>For no good reason. At least Nurudu was an orphan with a fucked up social life so you can kinda see him obsessing over what he considers to be his first and for the longest time only friend.</br></br>  Why doesn't Sasuke get as much hate as Sakura does? He's done way more stupid shit than she ever did.  <br> Also that flat ahoge is completely out of place and stupid looking <br>It's a leaf, you moron. But yeah, the headband doesn't really help. Those things have always looked stupid.</br></br>  <br><br>Excuses. You just hate Sakura and give Naruto a free pass for doing the exact same shit.<br><br>Because he's edgy and fags on /a/ eat it up.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The final arc of the series <br> Invest no money into the animation for it </br></br></br>  <br>He's a relevant character and his stupidity is actually important to the plot.</br>  <br>In my case, it is Sasuke hate by proxy.<br><br>The worst aspect of Naruto has always been his gay obsession with "rescuing" his "best friend" Sasuke, a person that not only did not ask for his help and would, and in fact, tried to, kill him multiple times while cackling like a maniac. he emasculated himself before the Raikage, rudely blew off Gaara when he suggested he might be beyond saving, and threatened Sai with violence when he called him a traitor. Naruto also acted like Danzo was a villain, not for committing treason twice, but when he removed the stay of execution for Sasuke, standard procedure for defectors such as Sasuke.<br><br>Then we have Sakura. Who takes all of the above and runs with it. Sakura doesn't even get the "honor" of being recognized as an equal (Greatest honor a self-centered sociopath can bestow) and is the biggest doormat ever written. Bulma had the balls to call out Vegeta, saiyan or not.<br><br>As much as it disgusts me to admit, even the retard man-child and nagging wet-blanket sitcom couple NS would has more chemistry. Sakura canonically let her husband vanish for 12 consecutive years -- and didn't even complain once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh God will you just go away. Nobody here but you likes Pink. You keep fishing for replies and the people here are too stupid not to take the hook.</br>  <br> she just happens to love him as well. <br>And that's the whole problem. It's creepy.<br><br>Also you can't love someone you haven't seen in 3 years. Science says so, look it up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But... he does. Haven't you ever heard of the "yeah sorry" meme?</br>  <br>Hey, look. It's Obito.</br>  <br>Because Sasuke's retardation is funny, Sakura is annoying<br><br>Also this anon is spot on</br></br></br>  <br> For no good reason. <br><br>Even sauce said that, but the then sasusaku club president Kakashi came up with some bullshit.<br><br> You need a reason to hate <br> You don't need a reason to love </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata loved Naruto for years and he pretty much never even talked to her.<br><br>I have yet to see a good argument as to why Sakura is shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>Nobody really liked Naruto except Hinata wanted him.<br><br>Sasuke had Ino, Sakura, Orochimaru, Naruto and Karin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this. Without the Sauce obsession Sakura's kind of decent. Every terrible thing she's done involves him in one way or another.<br><br>Just look at her in The Last.</br></br></br>  <br> He could have saved everyone a load of trouble if he just accepted that Sasuke was evil as fuck but he was just as obsessed with him as Sakura was. <br>The difference is that people, his mentor and Sasuke himself included, call him out on this stupid obsession with the first 'friend' he made and he is very much aware of it himself. His worst scenes are those regarding Sasuke, but he has scenes entirely removed from that huge flaw. Despite it he can be a likeable character.<br>Besides the bit in The Last sakura almost never has truly selfless moments, nothing in the last few years comes to mind, and definitely nothing in the really important character- and story-defining parts.<br><br> Sakura saved shitloads of people during the war(including Naruto) <br>That's her damned job, not to mention she was granted the opportunity to become Tsunade's apprentice out of author favoritism and THEN she kept getting butthurt at not being a frontline fighter. <br>Saving nameless, faceless fodder does not unmake her as a massive cunt.<br><br> is one of the strongest ninja in the world <br>Tsunade doesn't really qualify at her peak to be featured in that group, and Sakura never suprassed her in the way Naruto and Sasuke did their sannin masters. What the fuck makes you think she's that strong?<br><br> She even opened a clinic for kids in Konoha so that no kids would turn out crazy anymore. <br>As I said above and in another post, she tends to get less shit when Kishi's not writing her. Then after the orphan hospital thing (is it even canon?) she is written by Kishi again and she is insecure, can't handle a 12 year old asking perfectly reasonable questions, has no control of her rage and chimps out like her old self.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He does. He's been an edgelord meme for the entirety of part 2.<br>Sakura just doesn't have any quirks to joke about so people are just left to criticizing her.</br></br>  I only fapped to 5 Sakura doujins, one of them being Shizune as Sakura, two other one being Crimson Comics ones and the 2 other ones being a NarukoxSakuraxHinata threesome  with some futa <br>all the other Sakura doujins are crap</br>  <br>Brotip: they are butthurt she never wanted Naruto's dick. That's the only real problem.</br>  <br> I have yet to see a good argument as to why Sakura is shit. <br>Then check the archives. Every time you do this you get the same replies and then just plug your ears and shake your head. Just fuck off. <br><br><br>Kishi seems to like that hair style a lot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lavender eyes get in the way of making Boruto and Sarada's eye fucking look their dads'. <br>Yeah, but it was the only physical feature he had from Hinata, and honestly it looked better on him then the blue.<br><br><br>Himawari already has one. Here brother doesn't need one too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why doesn't Sasuke get as much hate as Sakura does? <br>he does</br></br>  <br>Sakura's a woman, Sasuke's characterization is a lot more unintentionally funny, that's it.</br>  <br>If the movie were canon the ramenb owl would have been more interesting, same conclusion, but interesting nothing the less. Jealous Hinata would have been awesome.</br>  <br>Brotherly love will always trump one-sided romantic love.</br>  <br> Himawari already has one <br>You've got it backwards. She has one because he has one. That's why she has it prepped up with beads. <br><br>She wants to be just like nii-chan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I rather like Himawari making an effort with hairpins to mimic her brother's ahoge.<br>The rest is fairly generic.</br></br>  <br>Those were just pointless fodder characters.</br>  <br>But Sakura's love canonically was not one sided.</br>  <br>You can love someone you haven't seen in years, but it's retarded to love someone you were never that close with to begin with.</br>  <br> Hinata loved Naruto for years and he pretty much never even talked to her. <br>Hinata admired naruto's character and sought him out because he had what she thought she lacked in her character. She was never shown to have a creepy obsession with someone who tried to murder her because he looked cool.</br></br>  <br> Brotip: they are butthurt she never wanted Naruto's dick. <br>There's no single NSfag in this thread, you dellusional sakurafag, stop spreading this lie.</br></br>  <br> implying I care about Sakura  <br> Implying you need to be a NSfag to not wish Sakura was after his dick as a self insert harem mc losers of /a/ like <br><br>She ruined your fantasies by never giving a fuck and you hate it.</br></br></br></br>  less shipping talk, more best waifu talk<br>Shizune, Orochimaru and Madara best waifu<br>also NaruHina a shit<br> ShotarutoLolinata the best </br></br></br>  <br> She was never shown to have a creepy obsession with someone who tried to murder her because he looked cool. <br><br>To be fair, she would have ended up in Sakura's same situation if Naruto had gone full edge.<br><br> But the slap and TNJ <br>She would have failed miserably because brotherly homolust would have been the only thing capable of "saving" Naruto from darkness.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto was a good influence on Hinata. He never talked down to her nor did he try to kill her. Even though they didn't interact much it was obvious that Naruto was a role model and inspiration for Hinata.<br>People give Sakura shit because Sasuke was apathetic to her at best and violent towards her at worst. <br>Don't pretend they are on the same level.</br></br></br>  <br>It is like a brother and sister relationship<br>Except the sister wants incest.</br></br>  <br> Why doesn't Sasuke get as much hate as Sakura does? <br>Sasuke is so shit and retarded that he passed the barrier between awful retard and hilarious retard while Sakura keeps banging her head against that wall, another thing she'll never overcome.<br>Also there's the fact that for some reason she has people shit enough to like her show up from time to time whereas Sasuke being shite is far more widely accepted a fact.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura surpassed Tsunade when she first activated her seal, Hashirama said as much, not to mention Sakura was only 16 at the time, when it took far longer for Tsunade to do the same thing. She also punched Kaguya right in the head, allowing for her defeat by Naruto and Sasuke. She's part of the new three way deadlock.</br>  <br> Sasuke's characterization is a lot more unintentionally funny <br>Fucking this. /a/ has a love-hate relationship with the edgy bastard because he's just so goddamn hilarious.<br><br>Remember this little gem? Exactly.</br></br></br></br>  I'll never be able to find a naruto thread that doesn't turn to shit. It's impossible.  <br>But Naruto was the one hyperventilating because of Sasuke. Sasuke thought he was creepy.</br>  <br>It's only when the Sakurafag shows up and the shipfaggotry reaches critical mass.</br>  <br> Shizune <br>My nigga<br><br> ShotarutoLolinata <br>Is that the only picture of them you have?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I sometimes think Kishimoto just doesnt show casual, relaxing interactions with the characters that much and pretty much offpanels them<br>an exception would be probably the RtN manga special, which had Naruto doing some casual stuff with his (male) peers</br></br>  OnionsxSarada doujin when?<br>Multiply Uchihas</br>  <br> Sakurafag excuses <br>Everyone here always preferred NH and thinks all Sakura ships were shit. Why is that so hard for you to swallow?</br></br>  <br>it's my favorite and easiest to find one</br>  <br>Even the big one?</br>  <br>Are you stupid? Literally no one in this thread made that point, most people here are NHfags, they dont care about who sakura wants to fuck</br>  <br> and thinks all Sakura ships were shit <br>I dunno. I liked the idea of her being the lesbians with Ino.</br></br>  <br>I recall hearing that this was bullshit because she shouldn't have been able to touch Kaguya for some reason.</br>  <br> /a/ is a hivemind <br><br>All Sakura ships are shit, but so is Naruhina.</br></br></br>  <br> You can love someone you haven't seen in years <br>You can't. Like I said science proves it. Old feelings can quickly come back should the 2 parties involved meet again provided neither changed much.</br></br>  <br>Especially the big one.</br>  <br>I'm not so sure. There was an entire chapter of Sasuke smiling and monologuing about how he always reciprocated Naruto's bro love. <br>And all Sakura gets in the end of the gaiden is a blank faced Sasuke who looks like he's only there for Sarada's sake before he jets again.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like an excuse made by a butthurt Sakura hater.</br>  <br>Naruto also grew up isolated and so attaches onto anyone who show him even a remote amount of care.</br>  <br> And all Sakura gets in the end of the gaiden is a blank faced Sasuke who looks like he's only there for Sarada's sake before he jets again <br>God, that was so funny. I can't believe SShits think he's going to give her a big ol' romantic smooch in the Boruto movie.</br></br>  <br> Sakura surpassed Tsunade when she first activated her seal, Hashirama said as much <br>Like that other anon mentioned, show v. tell. It's easy to make Hashirama say that in a throwaway line, but from what we see of them actually do stuff, Sakura is still far, far out of Tsunade's league.<br><br> She also punched Kaguya right in the head, allowing for her defeat by Naruto and Sasuke <br> She's part of the new three way deadlock. <br>For one thing, author favoritism granting her a moment, so muh team 7 can stay relevant. For another you might want to look up 'deadlock' in a dictionary.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Getting a cheap-shot in on a bitch who can see 359 degrees around her is bullshit, yes.</br>  <br>Why does Sakura punching Kaguya from the one spot she isn't capable of defending triggers more people than Obito teleporting from the dead and handing Kakashi an intangible perfect Susanoo powered by friendship?</br>  <br>We could leave that to Sanagi Torajirou or TYPE.90</br>  <br>Shizune just wants uchihas to get the fuck out and die, anon.</br>  <br> gets punched <br> is so fat he can't live in the orphanage </br></br>  <br>Who said it does? Both are equally stupid. One is just really funny. <br><br>Christ, why do Sakurafags always have such a persecution complex? Just because most of the manga is shit doesn't excuse her own behavior from being criticized.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke smirks as he walks away from her and Sarada, he's either embarrassed to show any public displays of affection or he's just messing with Sakura. You're reaching hard.<br><br> I-It's just author favoritism!! <br>Give it a rest. <br> You might want to look up 'deadlock' in a dictionary <br>I'm just saying what it is. The chapter where they summon their boss summons is called "A New Three-Way Deadlock. She's a member of the new Sannin, deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based Shizune.</br>  <br>That's just Kishi being a fag who will always favor the SN relationship over any other one while he's the one doing the writing.<br><br>Just be thankful SP convinced him to let them make The Last, otherwise Naruto's most romantic moment towards his future wife in the last chapters would have been standing behind her in one panel at Neji's funeral.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even really follow naruto that hard, but holy fuck you are delusional if you can twist the obvious into whatever the fuck you're thinking.</br>  Why can't you guys just ignore the Sakurafag?  <br><br>Forgot to mention: what I said was that she never surpassed Tsunade the way Naruto and Sasuke did Jiraiya and Orochimaru.<br>I don't think she surpassed Tsunade at all, but that's debatable. Surpassing however is what Naruto did with Sage mode and the Rasengan or how Sasuke used the boons granted to him by Orochimaru but incorporated them to the stuff he normally did - both master what their mentor had to teach them, make it their own thing to go with the other things they do and take it all to a higher level. It's very basic learning stuff.<br><br>Sakura never did anything of the sort. She had Tsunade's moveset grafted onto her and that's all she does, not incorporating it into what she had before, for there is nothing to her beyond that. She never really takes her own twist on the stuff she learned, just repeats, possibly at a somewhat earlier age after being given intensive training by the world's foremost expert in that technique.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sarada Gaiden, you mean?</br>  <br> abandons family for 12 years <br> that guy is reaching for implying he could treat Sakura better. <br><br>Jesus Chirst can Sasuke really do no wrong with you people? Sasuke could have tried to rape Sarada and the fans would still jump to his defense.<br><br>Naruto would too in-universe with a speech, probably. Uchihas love more deeply than anyone, after all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you'd have a point if Sakura wasn't always one of the most hated characters long before the ships became canon. Why would that change now that the manga has ended?<br>The people using Sakura as their self-insert are constantly searching for a scapegoat as to why she is hated rather than just accepting it.</br></br>  <br>SSfags are already in damage control mode, blaming SP beforehand because "they will revert character progression" and "SP is jelous of sasuke popularity, they are going to shaft him!"<br>They literally think Kishimoto writing in the gaiden was good because it gave them a little bit of fanservice to them, delusional fucks</br></br>  Terrible. Was a Sasuke Gaiden<br><br>LOL, wonder of Nazirama would let salad become hokage</br></br>  <br>No, he's implying that Sasuke doesn't love Sakura, when he obviously does.</br>  <br> not incorporating it into what she had before <br>Probably because she didn't have anything before. She apparently had an affinity for genjutsu that went nowhere.</br></br>    <br> Sasuke smirks as he walks away from her and Sarada, he's either embarrassed to show any public displays of affection <br>Smirking is very common in people who are embarrassed, unlike blushing.<br> or he's just messing with Sakura <br>Now this is a sauce I can get behind. I'd read a manga about sauce not giving Sakura the time of day as he smirks with satisfaction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that Family is where Naruto draws the line when it comes to Uchiha bullshit.<br>Now post the image, you which one I am talking about</br></br>  <br>Nah, Kishi is actually writing this movie. Which explains why Sasuke seems to be a more important character than Naruto according to the trailers.</br>  <br>The hat is probably a bomb set to trigger if Uchiha chakra ever comes into contact with it.<br><br><br>Kishi says he loves Sakura, but doesn't show it. Just let it go, and fuck off back to tumblr with the rest of your kind.</br></br></br></br>  <br> LOL </br>  <br>Well Kurama said he was rusty</br>  <br>I've never been to tumblr in my entire life anon. I don't even know what they talk about there.</br>  <br> Nurudu drunk with Hanabi <br>She later tried to seduce and rape him, didn't she?</br></br>  <br> Sasuke could have tried to rape Sarada <br>Everyone would love it, Sarada included, and you know it</br></br>  <br>Kishi is CO-writting this movie, and in any case I was saying the damage control of the SSfags is hilarious, as they are already blaming the studio for something they dont know</br>  Friendly reminder that Sakura is still and always shall be a kissless virgin.  <br>how pray tell did she acquire the sauce sauce?</br>  <br>What did she do that no one else could? Literally nothing</br>  <br> &gt;I-It's just author favoritism!! <br> &gt;Give it a rest. <br>Look, I'll give you the benefit of doubt and presume you aren't just baiting. If you are, well done, whatever.<br>Nothing we see of her capabilities shows her being capable of doing what she does. We are never shown her working out what she needs to do either, regardless of her inability to do it. Remember the deduction ninja spiderman did against Neji to figure out where the blind spot is? Sakura's got a good head on her shoulders, she could have been shown watching the fight, making a quick assessment and working it out. That would have taken three, four panels spread across, say, two chapters and it would have made sense, even without the obvious fact that Kaguya could have seen her approaching her blind spot and the fact that she did not have the ability to exploit the weakness she discovered.<br>We were not shown any of this, simply a big ol' panel of the 'teamork'. Why? Because if she was shown actually doing something for once it would have been about Sakura, not about muh Team 7, which is blatantly what Kishi cares about. She is put in that situation so that she can be the third wheel to a complete team. That is to say it's contrived, poorly explained/shown and is a product of the author favouring an idea, but bullshitting his way there.<br><br> boss summons <br>Sasuke has his subjugated, it calls him -sama. Naruto is on equal, friendly terms with his. Sakura calls hers -sama.<br>Do you need a more succinct way of putting things? Look up the meaning of deadlock. She is nowhere, nowhere near the other two's level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kishi is CO-writting this movie <br>He's the lead. Gaara Hiden author is co. Hopefully he can filter out any retarded decision Kishi makes, but that seems unlikely.<br><br><br>I wouldn't mind a doujin where Sauce and Bort tag team her during training. It'd be a good bonding experience for them. Some real father-daughter time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was mentioned in The Last to dispel the genjutsu. Which was bullshit because genjutsu other than Tsukuyomi are broken by just lending chakra, but oh well.</br>  <br> She later tried to seduce and rape him, didn't she? <br> Implying anyone would ever consider it rape when it's hanabi </br></br>  <br>This is actually painful to read. This is disgustingly pathetic, but at least you don't try to hide it that this is pretty much the main reason why Sakura is disliked.</br>  <br>I'm glad she made it into Storm. It makes no sense whatsoever but the world desperately needs more Hanabi.</br>  Following on from another thread about the days of old, I'm curious if there are any other fuckers on /a/ older than 35.<br><br>I have the terrible suspicion that there are very few and I should just pack this shit in and go back to reading the Financial Times or something.</br></br>  <br>I'm older that 40 and I still watch shit. It all comes down to interest. If it interests me, I'll watch it, otherwise fuck it. That goes for everything, not just anime.</br>  <br>Sorry friend, my teen years were great, my late thirties are turning out to be just as good but with a bigger budget.</br>  lmao kill your self old man go maw a lawn or something lol  <br>Lucky you, all my life has been hell exept the parts where I was drunk or sleeping<br>those became hell later, with a retroactive effect.<br>and I'm not even joking, I'm a fucking mess</br></br></br>  <br>I've all the manga volumes, but never watched the OVAs. <br><br>Am I making a mistake?</br></br></br>  Is she NTR incarnate? Who is she going to cuck her husband with? Calm?  <br>You people still exist?</br>  <br>Cuck of the year.</br>  <br> implying he watch whilst she gets ravaged by 12 filthy terrans </br>  <br>Someone who actually loves her and also an idiot.</br>  <br><br> cuck <br><br>We use NTR in here, crossboarding faggots.<br><br> B-b-buh NTR is a verb, you can't say "someone is a NTR" <br><br>Then say NTR'd faggot(or NTR'd cunt, depends on the gender) like how /a/ has always said, faggot. You would know of this if you weren't new.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oagariyo!  <br>No episode this week.<br>Some live action show about it instead.<br>Next week new OP and ED</br></br></br>  <br>Special recap episode?<br><br>I want the new OP/ED, badly.</br></br></br>  Color page for new chapter.  <br> Takumi a cute. I want to marry Takumi. </br>  <br>Tsukasa needs to get his shit together.</br>  <br/>  <br>I think he's taking it easy. There's more than meets the eye, when it comes to this fella. Its safe to say he'd emerge tops, come the end of the festival.<br><br>Come to think of it, I wonder why he was seen tagging with Rindou &amp; Momo.</br></br></br>  <br> eating ice cream in a cone with a spoon <br>No one does this outside of Japan except Obama.</br></br>  <br>What the actual fuck? Fucking weeb. This nip thinks he's Souma.</br>  <br>TAKUMI BEST GIRL</br>  <br>The  boypussy  is ripe for the taking.</br>  <br>Why is Sword always sleeping?</br>  <br>Isami a best.</br>  <br><br>A lot of people do it in italy.<br>And i understood why after 10 seconds watching my father eating an ice cream.</br></br></br>  Supposedly, what if all of Souma, Megumi, Akira, Alice and Ryou are expelled due to not being able to rebound until the end of the festival? Will they part ways? Somehow band together and start a restaurant?  <br>Technically, he IS Souma.</br>  <br>Megumi will not be expelled anon.</br>  <br>The manga will end. Then maybe Tosh could release his stash of SnS porn at Comiket.</br>  <br>I think Megumi will be fine considering she wasn't registered for the booth. That being said, I wonder how it'll work if the Shiomi Seminar is in the red considering it's their booth and not the students'. Souma's fucked though.</br>  <br><br>Megumi will voluntarily leave the school if her Souma-kun gets expelled.<br><br> Then they get married &amp; start their own restaurant together.<br><br>And have 2 kids.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice and Ryou would probably join a Danish cooking school and appear in the international competition which is bound to happen at some point.</br>  <br>Really? When I went to holiday in Rome I got a cone with a smaller cone on top of the gelato but maybe that was just because I was a filthy tourist. Although now I'm wondering if you were supposed to use the smaller cone as a spoon.</br>  <br>I feel like Soma and Akira would make a great Goku-Vegeta team. Or Goku-Piccolo, whichever works.</br>  <br>TAKUMI IS THE CUTEST</br>  <br>Tosh sure knows how to satiate the Fujoshits.</br>  <br><br>Some do that too, people usually prefer not to lick it, in my family we really don't give a fuck besides my mother, and it doesn't help that we live near one of the most famous town for artisan gelato.</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA  <br> artisan gelato. <br>Tell me more, Anon. Are we talking wacky flavours here or just great quality?</br></br>  <br> yfw Takumi and Gigannigga becomes the new MCs. </br>  <br><br>Great quality, if not the best and also some recipes that are now worldwide appreciated.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartu<wbr>fo</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Christ, he looks so fucking dead</br>  <br>Thats a terrible hairstyle</br>  Isami is /a/'s favourite side character right?  <br>That looks delicious, I can see how it got famous. Thanks for the info, Italynon.</br>  <br><br>Happy to inform, there are also many other recipes that are still unknown outside of pizzo, like the ice-cream cannolo with frozen ricotta and others.</br></br>  will ryou ever make mayonegg?  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  LINE stickers.    <br>Poor guy needs someone else to be at the front of his shop.

I don't know why everyone acts like her meekness is something unrealistic in that situation. I like her, anyways.</br>  <br>Because she isn't the only one in the academy.<br>Yuki seems to be the same, she reeks of farm girl.</br></br>  <br>It's something she should be over by now since you know, she had 2 different arcs where the main focus was to get her to stop letting people walk all over her.</br>  <br>She's been there for 3 years though.</br>  <br>how do i get this</br>  <br><br><br>I get your point, but inferiority complexes can be hard to shake. Just ask r9k. Hopefully Erina becomes friends with her and helps her to improve.</br></br></br>  <br>No that's Hisako.</br>  <br>I feel like in recent arcs she's really stepped out from Soma's shadow. During the preliminaries and her match with Kurokiba she fought on her own and even after the top eight's meeting with the elite 10 she was actually a little pissed off with how Kuga talked down to them. I don't think she's as much of a doormat anymore, heck even in this festival she's helping Soma because that's what she wants to do not because she can't do it on her own or because Soma pressured her into it.</br>  <br>He's best boy.</br>  I kinda wanna make Eggs Benedict and never tried before. My question is, where does the sauce really go? After watching tutorial videos, some served it without the bun top and just glazed the sauce right there, you see here Erina put the sauce over the whole entire thing and people eat it with a fork and knife or do you put the sauce in the middle, and apply the bun on top and eat it like a sandwich with your hands?  <br>She's main-er than Isami, she had an arc and all.</br>  <br>That would be  Buttbros </br>  <br>Here's the tankobon recipe.</br>  <br>Hey thanks. Is this version moe as well?<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/p1mGDiEbni4  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>He thinks it makes him look cool.</br>  <br>Erina is being nice to her because she doesn't know how bad her grades are.</br>  <br>Isami's time is coming.</br>  <br>I hope he receives a powerup and then stuck in the eternal thin mode. I am usually not a fan of bishies, but Thinsami is too good.  Plus he looks like Mindfuck from MHA who is my fav character. </br>  <br> and even after the top eight's meeting with the elite 10 she was actually a little pissed off with how Kuga talked down to them. <br>That's giving her a bit too much credit.</br></br>  <br>I don't think so. Erina would most likely know about little things like that given her stature. I think they're gonna have a nice  platonic  friendship.</br>  <br>I doubt Erina will know everyone's grades, or even if she cares to know anyone else's grades besides Hisako and Souma's.<br><br>Just as long as she doesn't get delusions of grandeur about winning the Soumabowl I can like Megumi</br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br> he doesn't know the manga like the back of his hand <br>C A S U A L</br></br>  <br><br> Erina is friendly to Megumi despite the fact Megumi is friends with Soma <br><br>Erina has shown to be petty in the past but I'm surprised she didn't put that against her. <br><br>I want them to be friends so bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are people acting like Erina hasn't been becoming more open and friendly?<br><br>She's already started dropping her tsun act around Souma and even asks him for things.<br><br>Just wait until the joichiro reveal</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, when Megoo starts talking about and praising Souma she gets testy.<br><br>They're cute as friends though, and let's face it, Erina needs more friends.</br></br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tart<wbr>ufo</wbr> <br>I hate you anon.</br></br>  Erina asking Megumi and Hisako on how they'd get a boy to like them and denying the information is for her own person use so she can seduce Souma when?   first she drops the tsun act casually <br> then she's going to be taste testing his dishes for free <br> she will start giving him advice as if it was manually breathing air <br> today's gloating will be tomorrow's casual conversation with him <br> and she will still deny she doesn't want to deal with him <br><br>What will be the straw that will break Erina?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does "The quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach" even apply to a cooking manga?</br>  <br>I think people have a bad opinion of Erina and expect her to talk bad to people if they are friends of Souma or in general bc of her "ojou-sama" and overconfident attitude.<br><br>If anything, she has shown to be pretty polite and talk with people if she can, which might be difficult for her at first bc of how she was raised. Not only the chapters with Megumi but before too, she didn't say anything to anyone if they talk to Souma or they are friends with him. Take for example Isshiki and Hishoko. She got surprised she and Souma seem to be good friends but she was never rude to her about it and questioned it. She just accepted it.<br><br>I never understood why some readers call her a bitch so much. Yes, she can be rude. Yes, failing Souma was unfair and with no professionalism. There are no excuses for this. But there is room for development with her flaws and instead of focusing in these aspects, some just go around calling her a bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We already have "The quickest way to becoming a good chef is by having a kanojo" <br><br>We can't have that many shortcuts anon</br></br></br>  <br>She's already started giving him advice anon<br><br>just 3 more steps until she's Mrs. Yukihira</br></br></br>  <br>I want the boys to stop being foodsexual already.</br>  <br>We had this discussion in the last thread and I said pretty much the same thing as this.<br><br>Erina's pompous attitude is stemmed from her being praised from the time she was still suckling her mother, and people started holding her to a certain standard.<br><br>Her attitude is simply what she perceives that standard to be and how she should uphold it.<br><br>Look at how she's friendly with Megumi and the way she acts when she's alone or with Hishoko, that's her true self, not the mask that she dons in public because people expect her to act a certain way.<br><br>I expect Souma to say something along these lines to her and she'll realise she's just been conforming to societies expectations of her and start showing her true self to everyone.<br><br>And of course  she'll fall head over heels for souma, become Mrs.Yukihira, and have 2 beautiful children who have the God's tongue and Asura genes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon, I wasn't in the last thread so I got to write my opinion here. Glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks that way about her.<br><br>Yes, everything you said is pretty much what is about her. I can't blame her. She got raised like this. It's not really her fault that from a young age she didn't grow up like the kids her age rather than someone very important who needs to be responsible and serious most of the time. Expecations and "musts" can make anyone be arrogant and look down at other people. Ofc her raising doesn't excuse her failing Souma or not wanting him to take part in the Autumn Selection.<br><br>She is friendly with all the girls she has interacted so far: Alice, Hishoko, Megumi. Yes, she has a rivalry with Alice and they tease each other a lot, but that's how they are.<br><br> I expect Souma to say something along these lines to her and she'll realise she's just been conforming to societies expectations of her and start showing her true self to everyone. <br><br>I hope so. They are both main characters, and if someone has the guts to say something like this to her, its him.<br><br>  I can already see it.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her being so averse to Souma is her coping mechanism for being in denial about actually liking him<br><br>It's really typical tsundere behaviour but it's cute seeing Erina going through the trials and tribulations of her Tsun phase before she becomes Dere</br></br></br>  <br> I can see the ending <br>Keima, pls</br></br>  <br>I don't know about typical tsundere behaviour bc I usually dislike this type, but if she ends up being more dere to him later on through character development, I will be fine.<br><br><br>Who is Keima?</br></br></br></br>  <br>ITADAKU YO!!</br>  <br>You mean how bad her grades were. Megumi's grades have definitely improved since the start of the year. She's no longer on the cusp of failure gradewise.<br><br><br>I can't see Megumi leaving of her own volition at the moment. She went carrying the dreams of her mom and the men of her hometown. She doesn't want to let them down.</br></br></br></br>  Spoilers for those who missed them.<br><br> Day 1, stalls in the red are Souma and Shiomi Seminar <br> Erina gets mad because they're all members from the Autumn Election <br> Megumi apologizes, Erina says "I wasn't yelling at Tadokoro-san..." <br> Shiomi Seminar failing is Alice's fault <br> dinner with leftover hujiaobing <br><br> Uptown Area <br> Fourth Seat in 1st place, Erina in 2nd place, Third in 3rd, Nene in 4th, Autism in 5th, Fifth in 6th, Isshiki in 7th (?) <br> Where's Second Seat and Eizan?

Enjoy your special seasoning, asswipe.</br>  <br><br>can you explain why cream doesn't go with carbonara</br></br>  <br>OH FUCK YES</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>And I'd punch you in the fucking face. Why do food people get so asspained about food? This is why I cook my own shit. Haven't gone to a restaurant in maybe 4 years</br>  New OP/ED this week?  <br>I want to do  body maintenance  with this cutie</br>  <br>People who scream 'BUT THOSE DON'T GO TOGETHER HURR DURR' piss me the fuck off. Let me eat what I want, bitch. You're not the one paying, why do you give a shit?</br>  <br>Next week maybe. This week is live action recap.</br>  <br>Probably the other, this week is recap.</br>  <br><br><br>Carbonara sauce is made out of beaten eggs, grated pecorino romano cheese and black pepper.<br><br>Mixing it creates a creamy sauce (more so if you put in more yolks over the whites) and pouring it over newly cooked pasta and sauted Italian bacon (guanciale) creates a very rich, flavorful and delicious dish. The heat from the noodles and bacon will cook the egg but not enough to turn it to scrambled. Throw in some chopped parsley for a kick.<br><br>Tossing cream is a big no-no since not only will the cream take away the taste, it pretty much takes away the flavor, richness, texture and the like that gives it its identity as carbonara. That and why pour cream when you already have the egg/cheese batter cream set on it? <br><br>I know, I know, cooking is a very open craft. Experiment is key in this field but at the same time, there's a line in dishes where you just stop. Carbonara doesn't need cream, not even mushrooms or peas and onions for the same reason you don't put ketchup on steak. It's hard to describe it (elitism? autism? I dunno) but that's just how it is. Ultimately, the Americanized carbonara is not even carbonara. It resembles an Aflredo more than anything.<br><br>Personally, I don't give a fuck how one wants to eat his pasta. I won't go in fits of rage over someone reaching for the box of cream when he says "Lets make carbonara!" but that won't stop me from telling them that's not carbonara and let them have their way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because you're in his restaurant, where he makes a living off of making food he wants people to eat? if you're telling him to make food he doesn't really want to make just cause you pay him for it, that opens up a whole can of worms argument just by association. gamestop won't start carrying anime rape games just cause you want to pay for it, for example. having the demand and the ability to pay for it doesn't equate to justification, especially when you're relying someone else's establishment to provide that for you. they are the one that gets to run their business the way they want, because they're the one that chose to run it that way. every business is designed to only cater to a certain appeal, and if you fall outside that appeal then you should either go somewhere else or make it yourself instead of demanding that they change their modus operandi just to cater to you.<br><br>that said, there's no excuse for jizzing in food.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like you bring your car to the mechanic and the mechanic doesn't like your paint job so he fucks up your engine. Is that warranted?</br>   this carbonara talk <br><br>For the record, you guys should try out how the legit carbonara is made. Changed my life. Shit is delicious.</br></br>  <br>PR.</br>  What the fuck? I just googled about this whole cream carbonara debate shit and this is apparently a thing? I thought steak on ketchup was the most autistic thing in the cooking rage scale.  <br> Fritatta <br> Heavy <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>His scrambled eggs are fantastic and super easy too.</br>  <br>a better analogy would be bringing your 20 year old toyota corolla to a mechanic and asking for hydraulics, and he does it but puts grape jelly in them instead of hydraulic fluid because you are a giant tool for asking for hydraulics from an old school mopar shop and that's not the kind of thing hydraulics should even go on anyways.<br><br>he's still a dillhole for putting grape jelly in there, but you're also still a tool for demanding it from him of all places.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck, this particular drawing makes him look like a male Erina.</br>  <br>He is a male Erina, Anon.</br>  <br> steak on ketchup <br>Nigga you don't like ketchup on your steak?</br></br>  <br>His smaller eyes and longer mouth make him stand out to me in your pic.</br>  <br>You're not marinating your steak right if you need to mask it with ketchup.</br>  <br>Bigger nose, sharper chin.<br><br>I mean it's the same author and he's only got so many bullets in that gun. Some characters are going to look similar to other ones if you ignore something as important to character design as their hair.</br></br></br>  <br>this. ketchup has a shitton of umami that enhances the flavor of the steak</br>  <br> marinating steak </br>  <br> marinating <br>Properly cooked steak needs only salt and pepper.</br></br>  <br> marinating your steak <br>uh what? that's just as bad. at MOST you should just lightly use a rub, but even that is pushing it. putting too much external flavor on a steak ruins the natural taste of the meat. I might get it if the cut of meat was shit and you needed to disguise it, but good cuts of meat have the best flavor all on their own.</br></br>  <br><br> le steak connoisseurs <br><br>Tell me about your epic bacon too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Souma technically marinate a steak with onions, or would that be a different process?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Shopping this made me confused when I saw Takumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Parma Ham&gt;Canadian Bacon&gt;Bacon</br>  <br>i like it in lemon though</br>  The way Hisako acts around Erina+Souma is weird to me. It almost feels like she completely forgot that Erina hates the shit out of him. Is there any reason for this other than her trying to set the two of them up?  <br>Yep, it was the eyes.</br>  <br>Just because Erina hates him doesn't mean Hishoko has to</br>  <br>She wants the people she cares about to be on good terms?</br>  <br>Right but she at least remembers that Erina doesn't like him right?</br>  <br><br>Sure, if it's a good enough quality, and you don't like to have fun with your steaks.<br>I'm assuming you've never tried a little bit of Worcestershire and chopped garlic soak with it.</br></br></br>  <br>a bit of lemon with some pepper is okay depending on the cut I guess, but I associate that more with freshly caught freshwater fish than I do with steak.</br>  <br>Now that she likes Souma in a non-romantic way understands Erina doesn't actually hate him.</br>  <br>Takumi now looks like a genki tomboy, and Erina looks bitchier than before.</br>  <br> Erina doesn't actually hate him <br>This. She's at worst mildly annoyed. She doesn't actually want to kick him out.<br><br>She even helps him on occasion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, Erina doesn't look at good as I thought she would with blue eyes.<br><br>Maybe it's because she isn't blonde.</br></br></br>  Why are people still of the notion that Erina hates Souma?<br><br>Have you even been reading this shit?<br><br>Erina has started seeing him as a competent chef more and more, even if she doesn't want to admit.<br><br>She sits next to him in some classes, asks him for manga, and even advises him from time to time.<br><br>Stop drinking whatever your drinking that's making you interpret the story incorrectly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Takumi doesn't look nearly as good as a girl as I thought, it's probably the breasts.</br>  <br>Science has gone too far.</br>  <br><br>What's up with that right shoulder on the vest?</br></br>  <br>Can you do the same for Takumi's body?</br>  <br>What's weird is somehow their hair looks different and I can't figure out why and in fact I'm pretty sure they're exactly the same.</br>  <br>Have a no boob genderbend.</br>  <br> you shouldn't put ketchup on your steak you fucking plebian! <br> what do you mean you don't marinade steaks? fuck off you pretentious twats! </br></br>  <br>Just for you:<br><br> If you're making typical American bacon, stop buying that cheap ass bargain bacon that has almost no meat on it. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>SCIENCE</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not bad</br>  <br>Tosh, can you see this masterpiece?</br>  <br>that's actually... pretty damn good, fuck.</br>  <br><br>flat takumiko</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  can we all agree that erina has a disgusting manjaw  <br>Takumi is always best girl though.</br>  <br>So that's why Takumi was always so interested in Soma.</br>  Are there more png sprites from the 3DS game apart from Erina and Takumi?  <br>I wonder if Takumi feminine enough to crossdress and pass as a girl?</br>  This pose remind me of those poses couples do and shit.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yeah.<br><br>http://www.cs.furyu.jp/soma/charact<wbr>er/index.php</wbr></br></br></br>    <br> Souma and 4 people he most commonly shipped with </br>  <br>LOSE SOME WEIGHT, NEEEEERD</br>  <br> shipping with frenchfag <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Isn't Meat more common than Shino?</br>  <br><br>Meat is more popular as a subject of rape and shit than shipping fodder nowadays, sadly.<br><br>Shinomiya has the fujo-factor.

If you were looking for something else other than some shallow show, you were the problem.<br>But I agree, Choco Fino was pretty great.</br></br>  <br>Since I apparently cannot find anything indicating that Onihime VS has an animated adaptation, what is the source of your .webm?</br>  What's her name, /a/?  momo kyun sword<br><br>episode 1 was shit, but then brown fino showed up in episode 2 and everything became better</br></br>  <br>Peach Tits and Friends  aka Momokyun Sword. </br>  <br> episode 1 was shit <br>Bugger off, m8.</br></br>  <br>Raul is one lucky son of a gun, that's gonna be his wife one day.</br>  <br>Guillotine Gorilla</br>  <br>It is Best Girl.</br>  <br>Wasn't a very successful show, probably never.</br>  <br>Lambchops Do Asphyxia.</br>  <br>She's a miracle of the universe.<br>Her smile, her laugh, her everything. Perfection.</br></br>  There's something about her laughing that makes me think her VA had too much fun recording it.      <br>Fino a miracle!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127676759 <br>That's what I hear.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127676759 <br>It would be criminal if she didn't.</br>  <br> Ah! Good morning, Raul <br>I am so jelly.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127676759 <br>I have no idea why the fuck she wouldn't.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127676759 <br>Of course! She had no competition<br> All anal <br>No competition</br></br></br>  <br>I would go to that little store every day if Fino was there.</br>    I am insanely jelly of Raul. Now that I think about it, any other fantasy anime with a contemporary setting like this one? I enjoyed this a lot because of that.        <br>Please no...</br>  <br>Fucking suits always keeping the man down.</br>  <br>I NEED more Tadokoro Asuza roles.</br>  Lam-chan a shit.  <br> I understand the basic gist of suits is to be at the top of the competition, and that a normal tactic for that is to get rid of the competition. Well, look no further for a shadow operative <br>Silly hero morals holding Raul down.</br></br>  I want to impregnate Fino  <br>Demonspawn is not okay.</br>  <br>Fino would impregnate you, silly.</br>  <br>A big evil demon lord created a miracle like Fino. <br>Do not judge a book by the cover.</br></br>  <br>No you a shit.</br>  <br>That other anon is correct. That washboard a shit and she isn't even canon so double shit.</br>  <br>You mean she was so perfect she made it into canon.</br>  The Manager has  inverted nipples  on official art, so does that make it canon?  <br>Of course, anon. Those are the important facts that any anime staff and the author(s) discuss during their meetings.</br>  <br>Besides her being hot as fuck, she really was a breath of fresh air as a heroine. When Raul walked in on her naked or whatever, she didn't inmediately freak out and hit him, she let him exain the situation and actually fucking understood him and smiled like the semen demon she is.</br>  Is Fino waifu material?  <br>Of course, demon king is best waifu.</br>  <br>Very.</br>  <br>What's it say?</br>  <br>I prefer her as a daughter.</br>  <br>Daughter, sister, wife, friend.</br>  <br>The picture? <br>Yoroshikune, nice to meet you etc.</br></br>  <br>Nice to meet you.</br>  <br>She does in the OVA as well.<br>Man, this show was fun and the girls were too good.</br></br>  <br><br> Trips confirm </br></br>  <br> WITNESSED </br>  <br>that's like the only point of the whole show</br>  <br>No, she is too lewd.</br>  It was a good show.  <br><br> Satan trips </br></br>  <br>Fino please don't tempt me like that!</br>  Do I watch it again for the nipples?  Why can't someone at least translate the mango ;_;    <br>Fino a cute.</br>  <br>Does the manga has at least a good ending?</br>    <br>The manga doesn't end, it just gets cancelled after volume 4. The LN has 10 volumes, but I don't have the last 2 yet.</br>   wake up <br> thread still here </br>  "You've done well to make it this far into my dungeon, Hero."<br><br>Wat do, /a/?</br></br>  HAHAHAHAHA  I want a Fino x Onihime crossover.  <br>That show was meh, I don't know why /a/ clings to it so much.<br><br>Fino wasn't even good waifu material.</br></br></br>  <br>Fino is daughter material mate.</br>  <br> heir of the Demon Lord <br> fun to be around <br> teases and doesn't mind being teased <br> smoking hot <br> not good waifu material <br>u wot m8<br><br>It was a fun show for what it was.

Click it.</br></br>  <br>Can't you just fuck off with your number-faggotry?</br>  <br> http fapservice dot com slash yuushibu-fanservice-compilation/ </br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>Wow.</br>  <br> Reasonably good MC <br> Perfect girl <br> No real haremshit, just OTP <br> Based imouto <br> Ecchi <br> Surprise sakuga <br>I need more of this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It had an interesting setting in general too.</br>  Fino is really cute.  <br>An LN starting with an interesting setting with magic in a mundane real world type environment that allows for funny hijinx and then doesn't devolve into some bullshit evil conspiracy chosen one adventure shit is a rare treat. Too many LN tease you with their unique hook only to let you down by becoming generic shit. This one stuck to it's guns, and that's something worth noting.</br>  How could there be such a good girl in such an awful show.  Anyone familiar with this series? Really similar feel and setting.<br><br>Raws:<br><br> http://manhua.dmzj.com/dbxdmwdr/ </br></br></br></br>    <br>The show was shit, but the Fino was amazing.<br><br>Especially since she was main girl. Such a rare combo.</br></br></br>  <br>ALL A nal  was the best girl of the show and she won the MC.<br><br>Sorry Fino, tsunderes are the superior beings.</br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> Those shiny boils all over her body <br><br>I hate this, why did they do that?</br></br></br>  <br>I can normally tolerate these but they look like extra nipples here.<br><br>Getting a bit nauseated now, actually.</br></br></br>  <br>How does this manage to hide her nipples?</br>  <br>Demon magic.</br>    <br>to annoy autists like you.</br>  <br>damnit issei keep ur dress breaker in ur own series<br><br>also im glad to see a general approval of this series, it was quite enjoyable and fino had so many moments where she accidently became one of the cutest characters ive ever seen<br>(english not first language)</br></br></br></br>  <br> (english not first language) <br>I was about to come down on your hard, but you saved yourself.<br><br>Mind your capital letters and punctuation, and please don't become one of those people who tries to correct native speakers.<br><br> What's your mother tongue? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I knew a girl in highschool everyone called All Anal.  <br>How many dicks do you have to take up your ass to earn that name?</br>  fino was fucking excellent, nothing has been good since  <br>It was less the number of dicks, and more that she would insist she only took it up the ass. Christians can be weird sometimes.</br>    <br>Based webm.</br>  <br>Any visual novels with similar plots that are good?<br><br>Any visual novels with similar plots that are translated?</br></br></br>  <br>I never heard of this Fino until now, but boy is my dick in orbit right now.</br>  Has anyone read the LN? Was curious to see how good it is.  Is there as much ZR as it looks? I don't think my penis would handle if it does.  <br>very different from the anime. there's actually a translation project going on now, though the guy might be dropping it soon hopefully he found an editor.</br>  <br>Shit on her chest because she isn't the Fino I'm looking for.</br>  <br>Lamchop de Axekiller</br>    <br> Fino 2.webm <br>That's All Anal.</br></br>  <br>This is Fino's work attire. She's really prominent in the show and they wear their uniform really often. You make the decision.</br>  Bump  <br>Fino means tasty on my mother tongue.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, I got a little confused. Should have named it Yusibu.webm instead.</br></br>  Rest In Fino thread.    <br>It's ok, Fino will keep spinning.</br>  Fino was great, the show was fair.  <br>Fino's legs are ripped.</br>  <br>As expected from the daughter of a demon lord.</br>  <br>The show was also great you geek. Fight me!</br>    I never finished this anime, I just sort of dropped it about halfway in.<br><br>I really should fix that.</br></br>        <br>At least one of us did</br>  <br> imgur <br> that quality </br></br>  <br>watching this due to the thread OP Good Job</br>  <br>Why is Fino so cute?</br>  What a fag  <br>Goddamit Raul!</br>  <br>At least he learns.</br>  <br> cute <br> shortstacks <br> looks good in any clothing <br> Gyahahaha! <br> ore-sama <br> kinda lacking on common sense <br> but listens instead of just getting mad about it <br> pretty innocent for a demon <br>And a myriad of other reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's that wizard in the stall?</br>  <br>It's different than the anime.<br><br>It's also an LN. That should tell you all you need to know.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Half of cast in anime is original, LN had some slut that stole Raul's first kiss and made Fino sad. There is manga adaptation of LN which has one chapter translated.<br>There is also manga adaptation of anime, which it seems it had better ending than anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know about that kiss stealing slut and that there are less cast members. The anime has a better cast and uses them for humor as opposed to cheap romantic conflict so it's leagues better. If the anime had a conclusive ending or a fucking kiss it would have been perfect, but that's against the law for LN adaptations.</br>  <br> I thought it was against the law for LN adaptations to not be shit. </br>      I normally dislike bakas, but Fino is a miracle of the universe.  <br>Apparently Raul is a baller in the LNs.</br>  <br>It is. That's why they changed so much of the source and made this one good.</br>  <br>Why is she pouring perfectly good liquid on herself like that?</br>  She needs it to cure those inverted nipples.  <br> cure those inverted nipples <br>I hope you're just fishing for replies.</br></br>    <br>But they're cute.</br>  <br><br>... This image is really lewd even though objectively it shouldn't be.</br></br>  <br>wait who was the kiss stealing slut and what volume ?</br>  math sure is deadly  Remember the threads?  <br>The threads were comfy. We rarely had shit posters. <br><br>This was airing along with a hell of a lot of popular shows.</br></br></br>   No VN spinoff <br> No Ramses the Architect route ever </br>  <br>Holy jesus.<br> What did she do that was so bad? Is it all from siding with the bad dudes in the final episodes? </br></br>  <br>I remember the anti All-A alliance (aka as A4) we had. Good times.</br>  <br>Fuck off Lam-chan.</br>  <br>She was a bitch to Raul throughout whole anime.</br>  <br>She was a bitch to everyone.</br>  <br>I've seen many tsunderes get a pass for it. What denied her that?</br>  Why, The show was boring and wasted potential.  <br>Go be cancer somewhere else, Lefag.</br>  <br>this<br/></br>  <br>hahahahaa</br>  anyone have the LN illustrations? Can't find the raws.    How could she hide those here?  <br>She had a glass of milk afterwards.</br>  <br>Magic.</br>  <br>I believe it's because her breasts are made of the finest quality.</br>  <br> Fino <br> Finest <br>All makes sense now</br></br></br>  <br>Got the last 2; here is how the novels end:</br>  <br>Raul turns into a faceless rapist for the purest demon queen ever. ;_;</br>  <br>So what is the plot even about after they go save fino from the demon world? From what I heard that part is similar to the anime. The manager is still the person who killed the demon lord etc.</br>  <br>Rescuing Fino is volume 9.<br>This is the plot of volume 10:</br></br>  <br>Oh so the ending to the anime was basically the ending to the novel? I figured there was anotherp lot line they'd use.</br>  <br>I'm not fluent in Japanese, but the details of the quest for the little girl seem different.</br>  <br>Hot damn I love Fino. S2 when</br>  <br>So that is Fino right?</br>  <br>That's my opinion.</br>  <br> Light Novel finished  <br> No translation <br>Find a good reason to live.  Profit: you probably can, but not too many </br></br></br>  <br>there is a translation anon. the guy is (or was) looking for an editor to continue.</br>  <br>I only remember like 1 volume, though.  I sure hope they continue </br>  I just started watching this series!<br><br>I'm actually watching it and Chaika at the same time--what a freakin' contrast between two magic-dominated postwar worlds.<br><br>I kinda wish someone would make AMVs of the two ladies in the convenience store with audio from Kevin Smith's "Clerks"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, you know, you could like, learn moon or something</br>  <br> chinese raws <br>Woah nigga you expect me to read that?</br></br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/there<wbr>s-a-demon-lord-on-the-floor-r14671</wbr></br>  So did the anime manage to pack 10 vols into one season, or what since the ending was the same? I'd love to see what they omitted.  <br>That season had Yuushibu and Outbreak Company. Those were 2 of the only LN adaptations I truly enjoyed.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=5<wbr>90006</wbr></br>  <br>While thank you for the torrent, let me rephrase. I'd love to be able to read what they omitted.</br>  <br>People always shit on annoying tsunderes. There's a small and very vocal fanbase of shit eaters who actually like that horrible archetype, but given that the main girl in this series is fucking perfect the shiteaters' voices got drowned out.</br>  <br>I can read moon. I promise you that you're not missing much by not being able to read LNs.</br>  <br> There's a small and very vocal fanbase of shit eaters <br>I'm pretty sure it was just a single anon who was blind and deaf, and some how clicked and hit random keys until some post coincidentally seemed like someone liked her.</br></br>  <br>why is Fino's hair so long?</br>  <br>All-Anal looks like an even bigger piece of shit in the LN</br>  <br>I was referring to tsundere lovers in general. Though it'd be nice to believe that no one on /a/ actually has taste that shit and it's all one big misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Ponytails can give the impression of a shorter hair. Also, magic.</br>  <br> It's out in Good language actually.  I wanted to buy it at one point and read it, but I guess I'll just buy used now.</br>  <br>how did actually end?</br>  She wins right?   thread dedicated to Fino still up <br>I love you you glorious motherfuckers.<br><br><br>She won our hearts and that's all that matters..  Of course she wins anon what the fuck! </br></br></br></br>  <br>kanojo! kanojo! kanojo!<br>ugh need to find that scene</br></br>    <br> ugh <br>Don't fag up the thread, faggot</br></br>  <br>there's spoiler up there somewhere. If it had closure I'm okay with it</br>  Rauleh!~  <br>   It's out in Good language actually. <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br>I made typo. Daijoubu daijoubu.</br>  <br>Those are some aggressive ass fangs.<br><br>Also somebody pointing out Fino being a shortstack, I had to look up her height again, because lol anime proportions.<br><br>Fino is 148cm or 4' 10". Holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's truly a miracle of the universe; being so little but still packing that much punch with a fine chest, a plump butt and meaty thighs. Her personality is just the icing on the cake.</br>  <br><br>whose shorter Fino or Hestia ?</br></br>  <br>It never says hestia's height to my knowledge, She's low in the 4' range though. Lili is only slightly shorter. And bell is Tiny.</br>  why can't my job be that fun and interesting?  <br>The same reason everything is better in anime: you're 3DPD and not 2D master race.</br>  BIG FAT DEMON TATS  <br>A half-demon whose demon powers are cancelled out by his hero father's powers who was raised by his mother to become demon lord but has to rely on bullshitting the demon princes and princesses into believing he's tough shit to get them to follow him</br>  <br>What? I thought Fino's father was a typical evil demon lord. Didn't he kill manager's brother or something?</br>  <br>This  you damn pig.</br>  i miss fino    <br> raised by his mother <br> his Hero father <br><br>Different story anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a response to the Fino comment I thought he was talking about Fino's father. What story is that then? It sounds interesting.</br>  <br>I heard she married MC I'm the novels.</br>  <br><br>i was waiting for this picture to be posted. it is the best picture posted currently on the internet.</br></br>  <br><br>shut up faggot.</br></br>  <br>Did some ESLfag get their feelings hurt?</br>  <br><br>no, some ledditnigger tried to fit in.</br></br>  <br> ledditnigger <br>Keep spouting buzzwords, you mouth breathing retard.</br></br>  <br>What series is this?</br>  <br>Wow. This series really is very like yuyushibu. I wonder which came first.</br>  <br>Yuusha ni Narenakatta came out in 2012. Floor maou came out last year.</br>  <br>But Outbreak Company was fucking terrible.</br>  <br>But that's fucking wrong.</br>  <br>Any more info on this? Sorry But all the girls look the same how should I know this is Fino?</br>  <br>Fino's finos are nipped.</br>  fino a cute  bump  <br>It's pretty damn close. I wonder if anyone said anything in japan about how it's basically a clone of the base idea.</br>  <br>You could say the same thing for Yuusha ni Narenakatta to Maou-sama.</br>  <br>Which maou? there's quite a few.</br>  <br> Hataraku <br><br>Though on that note, how many Maou base series have been introduced since then?</br></br></br>  <br>Just maou titled? <br>Maou no Hajimekata<br>Maoyuu Maou Yuusha<br>Hataraku Maou-sama!<br>Kinda-Sorta <br>Kyou kara Ma no Tsuku Jiyuugyou!<br>As I mentioned it's a couple</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can't believe that this thread is still going.  I'd hire her  <br>Fino love is eternal</br>  Fino makes me very funny down there  <br> I'll do whatever you want so please hire me <br>I'd hire her as well, Fino would be a good tier workmate.</br></br>   hurr durr durr the show was shit <br><br>It was fucking fun, that's all that matters.</br></br>  <br>I know right?<br>Not that I have a problem with that, Fino is pure sex. The show was almost complete trash but kinda saved by the fact that all the girls were 10/10.</br></br>  <br>It was fun but you have to admit the conflict in the story didn't even make sense.<br><br>" We want to be a Hero so we'll make the good daughter of the Demon King bad "<br><br>Why didn't Raul just report the Hero wannabes and tell the public they're the idiots who wants to ruin the peace.<br><br>It makes you wonder what the hell the author was smoking while writing the LN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all the girls were 10/10 <br> All A </br></br>  <br>Whoever wins we win.</br>       wake up a day and a half later <br><br>This thread is still here? I can see some parts of /a/ still have very fine taste. Good show sirs/madams</br></br>  <br>Everyone looks so different in the LN.</br>  <br><br>its even the same VA</br></br>  <br>The love never stops.</br>  <br>It's not.</br>  <br>There's no reason to believe that their government is a democracy. And the autocracy might support war.</br>  <br> &gt;All A <br>She really wasn't that bad. <br>I want to be protected by this smile.</br></br></br>  <br>worst girl</br>  Just curious; are there any cute vanilla Fino doujins?  <br> All A <br>She was pretty good.</br></br>  <br> We never get to see her wiggle her ears </br>    <br>How the fuck do I not remember this? I need to rewatch.</br>  <br>Would marry.</br>  <br> Those glorious tits every time I look at the catalog <br>My dick thanks you, OP.</br></br>  <br>Get in line.</br>  <br>Glorious Ore-sama tits. Would worship every morning if a thread like this was on every morning.</br>  <br>You're fucking terrible and that's a fucking fact.</br>  This shit was a masterpiece and even the original characters were fantastic.  What a nice show this was. Plus, this one got uncensored towards the middle of the TV airing on AT-X. Pretty unusual.  <br>The line starts and ends with me, son.</br>    <br>Wasn't only Fino, All A, and the manager the only ones actually in the LN? And why did this how get so little doujins. That komori doujin was like the best one.</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/724649/f3ef03<wbr>e2ee/ best one.</wbr></br>  <br>Kinbou Sokai is a god. I love his brown elf maid doujin.</br>  <br>Fino a tiny.</br>  <br>High density moe.</br>  <br>Her hips seem off though. I remember her having pretty big hips. She's still amazing though. Why are short girls with huge breasts so awesome?</br>  <br>Fino/Hestia symmetrical docking when?</br>  <br>She looks like a cute housewife.</br>  <br>Fino a fun size.</br>  <br> tfw someone saved a webm you made </br>  <br>This is not Fino, this is Fono.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Hestia is like 8 inches shorter minimum then Fino.Not that it's a bad thing. <br><br>I thought Aldra was super flat. When did that happen?</br></br></br>    <br>Fino is 4'8, Hestia is 4'2</br>  <br>Not exactly super flat and her weird belts held her back but you know how inconsistent 2D breasts can be.</br>  <br>Also QB characters have like 20 different character designs sometimes. I guess it's hard to keep track. I've only seen like one episode of the series and then just pics posted here.</br>  <br>Anon, do you think your weak opinion will gain more weight if you use strong words?</br>  <br>It already happened.</br>  <br>all anal a shit</br>  <br> Queen Aldra was an average size oppai loli <br> her true form was revealed when she was defeated, a young woman. <br> then she became a priest. <br> she lost her memories in a desert somehow. <br> someone found her and now she's her waifu. <br> until echidna awakened her powers <br> then rebellion happened. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>      Was the animation really that good?

FUCK</br></br></br></br>  How canonical was the manga? I hope we see some of Akko's pre-witch school friends back home who have probably become samurai or ninja.  Shiny Chariot dies in LWA3.  Main characters to be made into male characters and anime to be renamed Little Sorcerer Academia:Mustachioed Sorcerers doing Magical things!<br><br>The adventures of three students at a school for young wizards. Casting spells and solving mysteries, they actually spend most of their time trying to get dates for the Wizards Ball (usually resulting in magic related disaster!)</br></br>  Trigger should stop doing original anime and just adapt shit, they are garbage at writing stories.  <br> Fuck no, fuck Persona.

FUCK </br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're yurifags and you know it.</br>  <br>Yes really; there were also more magic guns and explosions in the original draft.

First we get tons of delays, which are not quite so bad considering they were to improve the final product, and now a large portion of the backers aren't even getting a download. I had to watch it illegally even though I contributed my $20.  Pics of their new original?  <br> the true source of the Shiny Rod's powers was alluded to in the climax of the second episode <br>spiral energy?</br></br>  <br> stop liking what i don't like <br><br>k, bud. go back to your moeshit</br></br></br>  <br>Calm down Adachi-san</br>  <br> 2015 <br> not playing the games </br></br>  <br> more LWA <br>What I learned after episode 2 was once is enough. Kind of like every other thing Trigger have worked on. And a show about bridges? BRIDGES?<br><br>I feel bad for trash talking considering what people contributed and that Trigger worked on stuff for the western fans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Search your spam folder.<br><br><br>They didn't allow pictures to be taken. All I can do is describe black uniforms, serious-ish designs, main guy had short hair and looked like Doujima without the beard, main girl had shortish blond hair with stylish spikes, one of the guys looked like Kanji.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> 13 year old 'humor' <br> stupid shitty image macros <br>You really aren't making yourselves look good here.

Which is fine, but someone not liking it, doesn't make it bad.<br><br>The persona series is popular for a reason, the game play and story are interesting to many people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   the show is actually nothing like Persona other than the character designs   <br>This is probably a dumb question, but any preliminary images of #2?</br>  <br>Check the promotions folder if you're a member of the botnet</br>  <br>Naruto is popular, that's a dumb fucking argument from a dumb fucking kid<br><br>The story is generic action anime where a highschool kid fights monsters in their free time SOOOOOO ORIGINAL, letting virginal 12 year olds easily self insert into the pathetically written super cool popular guy who screws all the girls. It's fucking lame, and the gameplay is trash, nice autobattle shit you stupid fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they didn't allow any pictures because it hasn't been announced in Japan yet.</br>  <br>Yes.YESSS.</br>  <br> the sound mixing <br>Does that mean the soundtrack was incomplete in the version we got to see?<br>Because that's the impression I got watching it, very few scenes had music in them and it was underwhelming compared to the first's.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you are gonna to say how Purseowner ruined your precious Shit Megagay Tennis?</br>  <br>Might be cool. More LWA is always good.</br>  <br><br>Naruto started out OK and turned to shit very fast.<br><br>Your description of the story just proves you never played the game. I gave it a chance, and I didn't like the game much as an SMT fan, but I know what you spouted is complete fucking horseshit.<br><br>Did Persona 4 touch you in a no no place?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I'd like to hear from Yoshinari is that Trigger is disbanding. too bad it won't happen soon</br>  <br>wow you're cool</br>  I liked LWA1 and 2, but I think that they should put the IP on hold for a bit.<br>Despite the hate KLK often gets here, that's imho the path they should continue on, focusing more on polishing their writing.</br>  <br>LWA 3 won't happen before 2017. Trigger has 2 originals in the future; one is a short anime for USP and another is a longer show that's the Person-like thing they've described it.</br>  <br> Did Persona 4 touch you in a no no place? <br>Go back to whatever shitty forum you crawled out of. And yes, what you said made it extremely obvious you haven't been here long<br><br><br>SMT is also complete fucking shit. The weebs on /v/ have made discussing good Japanese games impossible because they constantly harp on about god awful shit like Senran, Zero Escape, Nier/Drakengard, Persona etc. /v/ is a containment board because of people like that, who have garbage taste and tons of time on their hands to spam their bile</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshinari said that he liked the idea of all the action so he may use that in the future. </br>  <br>Then tell me what is a good japanese videogame, Dork Souls?</br>  <br>So why did they saddle Diana with that kid instead of furthering her relationship with Akko if they already went that far?</br>  I really wish they'd go more westaboo with their designs, I'm sick of the generic anniemay style they chose for KLK.<br><br>Also, where the fuck is Sucy Manbavaran from? Everyone else's nationality has been clearly stated.</br></br>  <br> 7 characters, main guy looked like Doujima, main girl had shortish blond hair with some spikes <br>Guys MC?  dropped </br></br>  <br> he doesn't like cookie cutter anime-esque shit so he must like dark shit! <br>Dark Souls is an awful game and has easily one of the worst fanbases in videogames. I'm so fucking sick of seeing faggots posting Dick Shit fucking everywhere and feeling like they should make a new fucking thread about how they killed one of the shitty early game bosses.<br><br>Fucking hell I'm just so sick of people and their fucking faggotry. Why do 99% of people have to be annoying fucking shits with no taste and no intelligence?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the Personaish thing sounds a bit like a departure from their "signature style", which could be a good but also dangerous thing.<br>After the brainfart that Ninja Slayer turned out being, let's hope for no more missteps.</br></br>  <br>  The weebs on /v/ <br/></br>  <br>Because they wanted to push the Akko x Lotte and Akko x Amanda ships too.</br>  <br>You sound like you hate games in general. Have you tried /v/? I hear they share your sensibilities.</br>  <br>It has 2 MCs, a guy and a girl.</br>  <br>So what fucking games do you even like.</br>  <br> Fucking hell I'm just so sick of people and their fucking faggotry. Why do 99% of people have to be annoying fucking shits with no taste and no intelligence? <br>Coming in theaters near you, the tragic story of how people dared to oppress Anon. See how he was tortured and broken on /a/. Rated R.</br></br>  <br>You did not answer my question</br>  <br>Anon, I think it might be time to step away from the Internet for today.</br>   all the /v/ cancer in this thread <br>Holy shit seems like the Trigger shitposter were right.</br>  <br><br/></br>  I wish Trigger was better with storytelling. They obviously have talented animators but their stories are so dumb and boring.  <br>Pretty sure it's just that one fucker.</br>  <br>Games which aren't dogshit. Think Bayonetta 2, DMC<br><br>Those are examples of good Japanese games, and there are a whole lot more.<br><br>But nah, let's hype about a bunch of fucking shit every single fucking day. And don't give me the 'but it's past it's release date!' shit, Shitsona is well past the release and faggots still post shitty threads about it, ditto to Dark Souls<br><br><br>Sick fucking reaction image brah! Fucking #sick!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people play different games <br>No shit man. Now stop this.</br>   Shiny Chariot's character and backstory will be expanded <br>Neat, Ursula-sensai a cute.</br>  <br> implying it matters what trigger does <br> implying /a/ isn't going to watch it either way </br></br>  <br>Didn't a new DMC just come release Shouldn't there be plenty of discussion?

Seeing all those young couples fall in love, experiencing something you'll never have. No wonder they're mostly drunk after work  <br>She smokes, so she deserves it.</br>  <br>Haven't seen season 2, does Sensei get any love?</br>  The life of a highschool teenager who isn't the MC.  <br>This, the best friend will never be happy.</br>  I know from experience. It's a living hell. Hopefully one of them will win someday. Onegai Teacher doesn't count.  <br>I think he means the noname masses that contribute nothing to the series other than to make the rooms look not so empty</br>  <br>Wasn't there a Sensei pregnant end in the VN they released back in season 1?</br>    <br> He doesn't smoke </br>  <br>pls no bully<br><br>Kids are the fucking worst.</br></br></br>  <br>I know and they put up with them all day. That's why they deserve better.</br>  <br>Those too, but he got it right. MC's best friend, doomed to never score.</br>  <br>Hey, I hate smoking, but fuck you. I would convince her to quit.</br>  <br> I willingly got myself addicted to incredibly expensive poison because I thought it would make me look cool in highschool </br>  Your shitty depressing life, obviously.  Smokers are totally cool kids, as long as you don't have to smell them.  If Christmas Cakes really are so lonely, why don't they become providers for poor young boys? They can even turn them into househusbandos that prepare a hot meal and a warm bath for them when they get back from work.  <br>Wait really? Pls I need this</br>  <br>They have no homemaking skills. Why do you think they're still single.</br>  <br> They have no homemaking skills. <br>But that's my point, why not date a less affluent boy and turn him into the homemaker while she remains an office lady?</br></br>  <br>Because nobody wants to date an unfeminine old hag.</br>  <br> He doesn't want to be the loving and loyal househusband to a hardworking business woman who comes home from work exhausted and craving cuddles and a massage <br><br>WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST FUCKING SAY YOU LITTLE SHIT U FOOKIN WOT M8 I'LL FITE U IRL M 1V1 ME I'LL FOOKIN' REK UR CHEEKY KUNT I SWER ON ME MUMS LYFE</br></br></br>  <br>Posting before you're 18 is against the rules.</br>  <br>The boys.

They kiss but Junichi decides to wait until he becomes a man worthy of Sensei's love before he actually gives her Tender Loving Care.</br>  <br>I wasn't defending smoking though.</br>  <br>She gets a couple of scenes, one with her and 8man on a bridge where he says something that makes her blush. It's adorable.</br>  <br><br>He's right tho.</br></br>  <br>About it being incredibly expensive poison, yeah.</br>  Remember that old ladies were lolis once upon a time.  <br>Here.

Junichi wants to tap that and they haven't had sex just yet. Hell, once get graduates he'll probably wake up to this for the rest of his life. <br><br>Then again the whole route is just a fan made fantasy so it never happens.<br><br><br>Same thing should have happened to Hibiki and some of the others.

Unfortunately smoking is a deal breaker for me, the taste of a smoker's mouth and the smell makes me shudder.<br><br>I'm hardly going to be pious about the financial aspect, regardless of earned or not,when I blow my money on Figma and computer parts</br></br></br>  <br>That's after 30. This is why no sane guy dates christmas cakes - they see men only as walking bags of money and sperm.</br>  <br>Nips hate assertive women, and they also can't self-insert as assertive men. This is why anime will forever contain only highschool bullshit.</br>  <br>Because the market is aiming towards men that want little girls right now.<br>Nips want cakes winning as bad as American television wants cousins fucking eachother outside of Game of Thrones.</br></br>  <br>This is pretty true, I've been fortunate enough to only ever date people I was friends with first so I already enjoyed their company. But the amount of people that have no redeeming factor besides appealing to each other's sexuality is astounding.<br><br>Which this mismatch of actually having simillar hobbies or interests is more prominent in heterosexuality. Ergo they only connect on an emotional or sexual level.</br></br></br>  <br> hurr nips <br><br>Dude, japanese women are a mix of polish women golddigging and french women ego. Sure, japanese men's attitude does not help, but it's not their own fault either.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually 25 is the age limit for Japanese women to marry, after that they go and buy a cat</br>  <br>I wonder how many nip girls over 25 suddenly start watching shows for girls. What's the term I'm looking for? Otome shows?<br>The gushy love shows that follow a girl around that is constantly hit on by some alpha guy, but she doesn't believe someone like him would come after her?<br> I love those shows. </br></br></br>   CC in aanime is always hot <br>This doesn't add up somehow</br>    <br> Wait for idealized men for 30 years <br> Can't cope with feels anymore <br> Think about adjusting standards to sane levels <br> Nope.exe <br> Play games featuring said idealized men <br><br>I know I shouldn't laugh, but damn my sides hurt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nips hate assertive women <br>But they are the best</br></br>  <br> ghost blowjob never </br>  <br>Another man.</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>The term is fushoji.</br>  Where's my videogame about dating christmas cakes?  <br>It is not funny when you realize that you are doing the same.</br>  <br>That gif isn't her laughing anon, it's her having a coughing attack</br>  <br>At this point I'll settle for the original game being translated sometime this decade.

And all the other shit?<br>Fuck, the porn was great, but Kazuto is an unbearable faggot, like most other harem protags  blablabla he's alpha, because many girls etc., someone always says this, but screw you, he's just a copypasta MC who gives porn </br></br></br>   what's the deal with people who aren't dumb contrarian Americunts having ideals and morals? <br>I dunno op it seems pretty gay to me</br>  <br>Kazuto's just a betafag who girls love because he white knights for them.</br>  <br> betafag <br>Kek.<br> white knight <br>Maybe but he probably just wants to stick his dick in them (and eventually does).</br></br></br></br>  Kazuto more like Fagguto.  <br>He is a porn MC.<br>His sole purpose is fucking things. Which is fine when it comes to fapping, but I consider him especially obnoxious and annyong plotwise, compared to other porn MCs.</br></br>  <br>He's way better in the sequel.</br>  Way to cherry pick, there's plenty of sadistic rape fantasies too.  No beta would snag the best Lu Bu.  <br>Is this how genius strategist looks like?</br>  <br>/u/ not welcomed here. Fuck off.</br>  Xun Yu/Keifa is my favorite in the anime, is she any good in the game? Never played it.  Translation never?  <br>My thought exactly. Maybe he's OP who made anime thread from time to time and yet the responds were from VN fans. So he's getting butthurt.</br>  <br>MC is male you dumbass. It's mostly him getting it on.<br><br><br>Translation being done for Shin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MC is male you dumbass <br>NO shit nigger, now cry me a river about 'pure love' being ruined by MC being male.</br></br>  <br>Only thing good about the games are better graphics.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Well the MC's interactions with some of the girls like Sei and Sui has been humourous. There were some pretty hot scenes in the game. And I liked the romantic moments between Kazuto and people like Renfa (who I swear the makers are trying to make it the canon couple at times).<br><br>So, what are you on about?</br></br></br>  Anyone else like baka?  <br>inb4: Chinese history is just a ruse and Zhuge was actually a little girl.</br>  <br>Nah, he's alpha because he flirts with the girls. A lot. He rarely spills his spaghetti when he talks to them too. It's why he's considered a playboy by all of them.</br>  Lu Bu a shit and a traitor.  Can we all agree that Cow Cow is the best?</blockquote>]
