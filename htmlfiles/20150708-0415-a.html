Is Hata involved in this somehow? <br><br>He starts new mangoh soon btw.</br></br></br>  <br>Hata is the one in charge of the illustrations and the character design IIRC.</br>  <br><br>Oh god I hope it's not as shitty as Locodol.</br></br>        <br> eva reference <br>This has Hata's touch, confirmed</br></br>  Nagi + Hina = this character<br/>  <br>They actually play the song.<br><br>I wonder how much this is going to sell considering this series has same main scriptwriter with Shirobako despite being made in Gonzo.</br></br></br>  <br> Locodol <br> shitty </br></br>  <br> they actually play Cruel Angel's Thesis <br>pink haired girl confirmed hina + nagi xDDDD</br></br>  <br>Can anyone who understands moon translate the names of that paper?</br>  Subs in 6h15min  Is this character based on real life seiyuu?  <br>IIRC she's the one who voiced Goku all this time.

Which one of the three is the least disappointing?<br><br>I've avoided these three ever since I started watching anime. Any advice before I start? Which episodes to skip etc.</br></br>  Read the manga and find out for yourself.  Naruto dies <br>luffy dies <br>bleach dies</br></br>  I think it's pretty obvious which one is the best. Also if you do some googling you'll find out which episodes are fillers. Don't be stupid.  bleach &gt; naruto &gt; one piece   The least disappointing <br><br>One Piece. On account of it being the only one I didn't drop</br></br>  <br> I've avoided these three ever since I started watching anime. <br>Why?<br> Which episodes to skip <br>Why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not even hardcore bleachfag would eat this.</br>  <br>8/8<br>that one can reel in all 3 of the fanbases<br>well done m8</br></br></br>  <br> bleach dies <br>I kek'd</br></br>  <br>I read the Bleach manga. It was  pretty good . Is the anime basically the same story?<br><br>Should I read the Naruto/One Piece manga?<br><br><br>I'm not talking about skipping filler but skipping episodes deemed shit.<br><br><br>I'm the kind of person that likes cute girls doing cute stuff or shows with a whole lotta comedy. (dragonball) I thought these three were 2edgy4mytaste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  One piece is the only one I still read I dropped Naruto and Bleach many years ago  <br>pls die because it's<br>one piece &gt; naruto &gt; bleach</br></br>  <br> Skipping episodes </br>  <br>avoid bleach unless you're fucking nuts<br>go into naruto with low expectations<br>avoid one piece for another 15 years, it's absolutely dogshit weekly and absolutely god tier in bulk</br></br></br>  <br> *Tip's fedora </br>  <br> naruto <br> higher than anything </br></br>  <br>It'll take him atleast 15 years to catch up anyway.<br><br>I might be alone in this but I'd say One Piece anime &gt; manga atleast for the first like 500 episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>Does one piece have<br><br> romance  and/or  plot  ?</br></br></br>  OP &gt; Naruto &gt; Bleach  <br>I picked up One Piece last summer and marathoned the 700 or so chapters in a week. I had a blast, it was really fun.<br><br>I couldn't be bothered to follow it weekly for long though, I'll probably do another marathon soon since the Dressrosa arc seems to be finished now.</br></br></br>  <br>  yes, but 99% of it is unrequited, and yes, but it moves at the pace of a thousand year old diamondback terrapin </br>  <br> Bleach <br> So bad that even Japan agrees <br> Not last <br>Also, avoid their anime adaptations specially the Naruto one  It is so fucking slow that Kaguya first appereance is going to be in a video game </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'll start with reading the One Piece manga first and then switch over to the anime<br><br> thanks /a/ </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how bleachfags believe their shit is above nurutu's shit.</br>  <br>Honestly, they are both diffrent kind of shit</br>  <br>Avoid the anime, it's really not worth it.</br>  <br>Naruto is very good actually, except the shinobi war and Bleach was good before they entered hueco mundo</br>  <br>Be careful anon, a bleachfag might show and start posting long wall of text on how bleach is actually deep.</br>   watching any of these <br><br>Read them instead. Long ass shounenshit isn't suited for anime for the most part. Budgets get stretched too thin, and then there's all that filler to avoid. It's also way faster to read them. Especially Bleach. <br><br>Wan Piss is the best of the three. The other two have their moments, but are much weaker in my opinion. <br><br>If you have an aversion to manga, just skip them and watch something else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll skip all anime then, I guess.<br><br>I don't mind reading manga as long at there's something going on.</br></br></br></br>  Atleast naruto and bleach ended  <br>Shit,Shit and Shit</br>  <br><br>One Piece seriously<br>The one true successor of Dragonball and the only manga that does ADVENTURES right</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't about defending Bleach. This is about knowing how truly awful Naruto is.</br>  <br> I'll start with reading the One Piece manga first and then switch over to the anime <br>this is really the opposite of what you should do. Watching the anime after enie's lobby/thriller bark is pure masochism</br></br>  <br>They are both 2/10 shonenshit.</br>  <br>not even fan of this shit but <br>OP&gt;Naruto&gt;Bleach<br>MC development: Naruto&gt;Luffy&gt;Ichigo</br></br></br>  <br>bleach ended? what the fuck man</br>  <br>One Piece is more planned out. It was clear since the beginning that Blackbeard is going to be the final villain.<br><br>Meanwhile in Naruto Kishimoto couldn't decide who was the final villain<br><br> It's Pain <br> No wait it's Obito <br> No it's Madara <br> Now it's Black tetsuo <br> Kaguya, obviousluy! <br> Wait, it's Sasuke, of course! <br><br>I'm not going to bring Bleach into this because it doesn't even have a plot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I've avoided these three ever since I started watching anime. <br>I think you should keep that up.</br></br>  <br>lol the final villain is dragon retard</br>  Why are their opening so good?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8e8<wbr>s5eOrw2E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cXe<wbr>b9cb6k0I</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tIP<wbr>p1Zhg2gU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not skipping the berserk episode where casca got raped <br> wanting to watch guts heart being broken <br><br>you sick fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not posting best One Piece opening <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  At it's good points Bleach. For consistency of okness with obvious exceptions One Piece. Old Naruto was actually a good series but most of shippuden is pretty bad    <br>Forgot how much I loved Bleach openings<br><br> I miss good Bleach anime so much </br></br></br>  <br> One Piece is more planned out. <br>I wouldn't say planned out, but Oda knows at least what he ending suppose to look like.<br> It was clear since the beginning that Blackbeard is going to be the final villain. <br>No it was not you idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even after dressrosa arc?</br>  <br> &gt;wanting to watch guts heart being broken <br>Yeah, after all it wasn't as satisfying as seeing his  sphincter  broken.<br>7/10 NTR.</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto and Bleach are filled to the brim with fillers.<br>One Piece actually makes you feel like you're along for the adventure with all that happens even if it has a shit ton of episodes.<br>For all these shows you can easily google websites that tell you to watch the episodes that as important to the main plot as told in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br> that flashback of kid Narutu scenes <br>Not gonna lie that's quite touching</br></br>  <br>Shit Shit Shit</br>  obligatory  <br> From kid that no ones care to the last hope of the world </br>  <br>they all burn out 500 chapters in or so.<br><br>Naruto and Bleach have OK animation, while One Piece is pretty poor. So read that one.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on which versions you are talking about<br><br>If you mean anime it's<br>Naruto &gt; One Piece &gt; Bleach<br><br>If you mean manga it's<br><br>Naruto &gt; One Piece &gt; Bleach</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its simply no longer true</br>  One Piece &gt; Bleach &gt;&gt; Naruto<br><br>One Piece is good when you read a shitload at a time, so read arcs, not chapters. It's a lighthearted adventure, so go with low expectations.<br>Bleach is Kubo's weakest work, it's quite clear he wants to design clothes, not being a mangaka. I liked Zombie Powder way more, too bad it was cancelled.<br>Naruto is shit. If you want anything from this series, play the games and that's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It pains me to say it, but One Piece. Naruto had the most interesting world and loveable characters, but Kishimoto can't write for shit.<br>One Piece has the better adventures.<br>And Bleach is pure shit without a single redeeming quality.</br></br></br>  madera &gt; YWCH &gt; Blackbeard  <br>That brings up something<br><br>Don't watch the One Piece anime. Just read it. If you watch the anime you'll have to deal with<br><br> Fuck long openings <br> Fuck long recaps <br> Literally one page of a chapter stretched thin for 10 minutes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would like another update to this</br>  Post your perfect western soundtracks for big 3 animu  <br> Bleach <br> Above anything </br></br>  <br>Bleach<br>Taylor Swift - Blank Space</br></br>  From viewing the /a/ threads Bleach and OP are the only ones that look interesting, I've downloaded Bleach and waiting for a decent OP batch.  <br>okay</br>  <br>Bleach may have been shit, but that opening reminded me how much I enjoyed watching it. Fuck that was fun.</br>  <br> One Piece <br> 2edgy4mytaste <br> it's basically dragonball (not Z) with pirates </br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Bleach,if you don't mind the complete lack of plot and character development<br>Naruto flunked after the timeskip.<br>One piece is like trapped into purgatory and forced to watch the same shit over and over again.</br></br></br>  Read the manga.<br><br>One Piece is the least disappointing. You either like it or you don't.</br></br>  <br> it's basically dragonball (not Z) with pirates <br><br>Anon since we have 4th gear we can't say that anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Only one of those has a best ending so get on it.</br>  <br><br>As a Bleachfag, I would say One Piece looks like it's going to be the least disappointing.</br></br>  <br>10/10</br>    One Piece<br>^Overall Best<br><br>Bleach<br>^Fun to speculate on<br><br>Naruto<br>^Just avoid and spare yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Naruto was shit, so I have to agree with him.</br></br>  <br>Nobody should get into Naruto just for the ending. You have to suffer through most of the manga being shit to get there, which is really only something a person who's been with the series for a long time would do.</br>  <br>Bleach is worse.</br>  <br>Only one of those has a ending at all.<br>Bleach still has all the final fight to show.<br>One Piece will end by the time your children and grand childrend catch up.</br></br></br>  One piece is fun throughout except for the first two arcs you'll read after catching up to weekly pace. <br><br>Naruto is quite shitty but has a shabby charm to it plus it's a finished work, you can read through it and be done.<br><br>Bleach can be so retarded it's amazingly entertaining at times, but the rest of the way it's just boring as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is abig guy<br><br> ^Fun to speculate on <br>Bleach is a deep a paper. only retard that try to justiface the time that they spend on it write long "speculation" essays.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just because one of the the only four decent female characters in this managed to get her ideal endgame, doesn't make the rest of the shit good.</br></br>  <br><br><br> As someone who has subjected themselves to all 3 of them <br><br>One Piece &gt; Early Bleach &gt; pre-ShippudenNaruto &gt; Current Bleach &gt; Shippuden</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to venture a guess that english is not your first language.</br>  <br> I've avoided these three ever since I started watching anime. <br>congratulations, youve been memed.<br>theyre all great and pretty much universally liked for a reason.</br></br></br>  Naruto is good till the second arc of Part 2.<br>Bleach is good till mexico<br>One Piece is good till the timeskip</br></br>  <br>I agrer with this.</br>  <br>Something about that Naruto Opening is really fucking catchy. I think its the rhythm that sets in when Madara is moving towards the filthy beasts.</br>  <br> Naruto is good till the second arc of Part 2 <br>More like during Chuunin exams (maybe during Sasuke retrieval arc?)<br> Bleach is good till mexico <br>Only during SS arc</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch Bleach, the anime-exclusive filler is actually some of the most interesting shit. If you're still interested by the end, it's easy to roll through the manga because Kubo likes large frames with very little in them.<br><br>Read One Piece. Anime is decent but there's a lot to cover either way so I recommend the manga.<br><br>Naruto is up to you, I read it all the way through as sort of a "well i Have 5 minutes" thing every week, but Naruto is easily worse than the other two, excluding everything leading up to/including the Rescue Sasuke arc, which was actually decent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rukia a shit <br><br> Nemu a best </br></br></br>  <br>I forgot I had that image selected. Oh well, 10/10 a best too.</br>  Bleach is definitely the worst of the three. Unfortunate, because its first Soul Society arc was great.<br><br>Naruto has significantly more interesting characters, as well as better worldbuilding IMO. Ichigo in particular is horrendously boring compared to Naruto. Anime for both has abysmal pacing, as to be expected from popular shonen. Bleach lacks the very annoying edgy Uchiha Darkness which drives an unfortunately large amount of the plot in Naruto.<br><br>Skip all filler, which Bleach and Naruto both have an overabundance of.<br><br>One Piece seems to take itself less seriously than the other two, which is a major advantage. The overall theme of adventure and fun doesn't change much, unlike the others. I'm less familiar with OP but most seem to think it's significantly better than the other two.<br><br>Still, they're still all very popular shonen, with all the problems that come with that, so don't necessarily assume any of them are actually good or worth watching. If I were you I think I wouldn't bother with any of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part I of Naruto was pretty ok. After that the author completely lost his balls. Part II is almost complete preachy shit from start to finish. That's not even getting into the unintentional homo subtext.</br>   reading or watching shonen  <br><br> Who I'm asking? I like shonens. </br></br>  <br> qt3.14 chinese battle ninja <br> weapons expert <br> voiced by Nanoha <br> one of the few sane characters in the series <br> relegated to tool status <br> possibly forever alone status <br> never even did anything noteworthy <br><br>10/10 deserved better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?

If she was a yandere, Hibiki wouldn't be able to run around hugging/holding everyone and anyone's hands like she does.<br>If anything, Hibiki has more potential to be a yandere, what's with her going berserk on the noise just because they made her missed their date.</br></br>  Symphogear is getting another live in feb next year<br><br>Just got announced on the nico stream</br></br>  <br>I think that Miku does feel fairly possessive of Hibiki, but Mikugeah was a result of Ver amplifying those feelings out of control with Senshou Jing. <br><br>Hibiki is actually a lot more emotionally dependent on Miku than the other way around, but I don't see her as a yandere since she has that whole "love you and everyone"personality.<br><br><br>Nana wills it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Two day Symphogear Live announced for 2016, Feb. 27, 28  <br>With  traces of black lipstick </br>  you wouldn't a dess would you?  <br> Iguchi Yuka's face when she is demoted to not appearing in the show </br>    <br>Nana wills it.</br>  <br>No surprises here.</br>  <br>S4 or movie confirmed</br>  <br>Yes, perfect.</br>  <br>The two days part is pretty surprising to me.</br>  <br> 2016 <br> two days <br> motherfucking Budoukan <br>Those are all pretty pleasant surprises to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Two days?

Is there a timeskip since season 2?  <br>maybe they'll have a medley or best of or something and Kanade's VA is also there</br>   Why are these threads suddenly awful? They weren't so bad for the first two seasons.   <br>By the time of the radio show, they have just done the recording up to ep4, though, so it's possible that she will get to sing in later episodes but doesn't know about it.</br>  Site is back. Still no ep2 previews though.  <br>6 months I think</br>  <br> Symphogear threads weren't so bad during G <br>Clearly misremembering things.<br>Also metashit is not Symphogear related, so talk about the show and related material or fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they are informed of these kinds of things in advance. The songs involve contracts with the recording labels too, so it's not something you can just dump on the VA as you please.</br>  <br>It was stated in the episode that 3 months passed between space shuttle and London.</br>  Was that song the blue bitch and the other bitch singing together at the concert the opening theme?  <br>Then it means she was outright lying about the not singing part.</br>  <br> bitch <br>Fuck you faggot. How about asking a question normally?</br></br>  <br>3 months between G's epilogue and space shuttle, and then they skipped another 3 months.<br>It was winter in G, but now it's summer.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they're just being coy and secretive since it's required of them. Hikasa was playing around with the idea that she'll get a gear in the future and Iguchi stopped her jokingly even though the website already spoiled it.</br>  <br>Damn son I'm sorry. <br><br>Was that song the blue  bitch  idol and the other  bitch  idol singing together at the concert the opening theme?</br></br></br>    <br><br>Fuck off retard.</br></br>  I just finished watching the first symphogear.<br><br>Why was everyone terrified when the Boss enemies plan was to blow up the moon, but then in the last episode the good guys blow up the moon?</br></br>  <br>Don't you see the different between a small fragment of moon and the whole one, anon?</br>  <br>I actually have no idea if you actually mean the season 1 concert or if you're just too dense to realize that the episode 1 concert is never the opening theme or just a retard who started watching with the third season.</br>  <br>Are you fucking serious m80?</br>  <br><br>Fuck off and get out.</br></br>  <br>Fine wanted to drive humanity into a state of chaos and take that opportunity to seize power and rule the world.

I was just asking a harmless question.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, if i was lets say in america, and i just saw part of the moon break off and then explode, i'd probably be in a bit of chaos. not to mention a good chunk of the moons gravity is gone, so smaller tides and changed ecosystems aplenty. <br><br><br>its called a joke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's clear you haven't even watched the previous seasons or even been in any threads pre-release, you fucking retard.</br>  <br> Mature <br><br>They look the same to me. Maybe what you're sensing as maturity are just lesbians in sexual afterglow.</br></br></br>  <br>If the whole moon exploded the curse of Baal would be lifted and suddenly everybody would be speaking the same tongue. Not to mention that the psychological and gravitational impact would be in a completely different scale compared to just the fragment. Finally, the good guys only blew up the moon fragment because the alternative would be letting it fall on Earth, which would be much more disastrous.</br>  <br>People aren't telling you off because of that, they're telling you off for not knowing the answer to the question in the first place.<br>If you were just watching season 1 there would be no reason for you to ask this.<br>If you just started watching season 3 then you should already know it isn't.<br>If you started with season 3 without watching the previous ones then you're just being plain stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SYMPHOGEAR 天(Season 10) confirmed.</br>  <br><br><br>Right on the mark with that one. The current Yu-Gi-Oh anime director works on Symphogear so I thought I'd take a look at the new season. The first episode was pretty great but I wanted to know if the idol performance was the opening theme or not. Guess it isn't.<br><br>Again, sorry for triggering you and not devoting my time to your pre-release threads. I'll make sure to keep an eye out on every Symphogear thread from here on out to stay in the loop. I don't want to be a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A quick google search gives you the answer on what is the OP or ED of each season.<br>For future reason, duets are never an OP in Symphogear.<br> calls Symphogear "waifu shit" <br> watches Arc-V <br>Hahahaha.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Watching the first episode of the third season before watching the rest <br><br>Good job spoiling the plot of the first 2 seasons for yourself, you fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>You brought this on yourself by acting the retard, m8.</br>  <br>L O N D O N</br>  <br>how is it even possible to be this retarded, holy shit</br>  Why are they so gay? Don't they know to at least keep that degeneracy in the bedroom?  <br>Guess you read my post wrong. Wasn't calling Symphogear waifushit. I was calling the two faggots who replied to me getting triggered from me calling the two idols bitches, waifushits.<br><br><br>Thanks. Again, I'll be sure to be kept in the loop by following these threads from here on out..<br><br><br><br>I'm sorry guys. I just wanted to know the opening theme.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What an idiot.</br>  <br>It would be better for everyone involved if you'd just go now, seriously</br>  <br>Well you'll just have to wait until next Friday. <br><br>You could pass the time until then watching the first two seasons so you're not a complete fuckup.</br></br></br>  These threads are going to be filled with newfags and retards who haven't read the Keywords.  <br>What</br>  <br>You better don't start following these threads until you watched season 1 and 2. Seeing crazy unexpected things happen is the charm of Symphogear.</br>  <br> uncensored hand holding and pinching <br>This is going to be a lewd season, I can't wait.</br></br>  <br>Not trying to defend his idiocy but that's kind of retarded for calling him a retard just because he watched the first episode of the new season first. Apparently from his posts, he didn't even know there were previous seasons in the first place. Most people who join into new animes usually see an episode and then start from the beginning if they are interested.</br>  <br>Anime ja nai a cute</br>  <br> Forgetting the 6-way handholding that happened last season <br>If they add Carol and Elfnein we could have an 8-way uncensored hand holding.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about this one idiot who picked S3 up because the Arc-V director's working on it. There's bound to be more like him in time.</br>  <br>But I wanted to talk about Symphogear with you guys.<br><br><br><br>Okay newfriends. How long exactly would it take me to binge watch the first two seasons?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So how do they top S3E1 in S4E1?</br>  Anybody have the rating of the 1st episode of GX on Nico?  <br>Orgy</br>  <br>He is not the first one to pop-up in these threads.</br>  Is her voice this bad in the manga? Alraedy considering dropping this shit  <br> Is her voice this bad in the manga? </br>  <br>PICKED UP</br>  Calm down you fucking shits.

It's the "darkest" route so people think it's deeper and has more meaning.<br>2. It's thematically and tonally different from the other two routes, making it stand out more, so people think this means it's better.<br>3. Shirou's development is a lot more radical and noticeable in HF, so people think this makes it the best arc for characterization.<br>4. It addresses the Sakura plotline, so Sakurafags consider it the only valid route. <br>5. It's the closest thing we get to an Ilya route, so the Ilyafags consider it the best.<br>6. Kirei features heavily in it, so the gay shippers like it the most.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best is obviously relative to what you think<br><br>If you like F/SN for its story, themes, and character development then you go with UBW since it's the best written one of the three.<br><br>If you want the best fights then go with HF.<br><br>If you want the best love story then go with Fate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  UBW is better though.

The adaptation will decide it.  <br>This please. At least incorporate it into the Saber Alter showdown somehow.</br>  <br>I remember my main draw for this series was Shirou fighting Archer. When I saw the scene with Archer being demolished by Berserker in UBW I had no idea what was going on anymore. That's when Gilgamesh killed Caster and became the old but new Archer</br>  Rider's seiyuu posted this few minutes ago. Do you think it's a kind of clue?  Rider doesn't die.  <br>It's a clue for her 3 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>Rider isn't a good character.</br>  <br> Do you think it's a kind of clue? <br><br>Aniplex gave me this horrendously overpriced box of a popular chinese cartoon in which I star for only 5 minutes. Now I'm going to sit on my couch which happens to be purple and enjoy my 5 minutes of screentime.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone has to look after the baby.</br>  <br>UBW is the best route</br>  <br>Obviously.</br>  <br>Because the others are worse</br>  <br>But she bragged for her purple couch, and use #iamRider hashtag, why is that?</br>  <br> If you want the best love story then go with Fate. <br>Is this a joke</br></br>  <br>Because she is Rider, and is in FSN [UBW].<br><br>The Anime Expo panel the other day confirmed they are literally still in the planning staging for HF, and for people to not expect it for at least a year.</br></br></br>  <br>HF has great moments but UBW is better overall.</br>  It is dark and edgy.<br><br>This makes it acceptable as mature anime for mature adults in /a/.</br></br>  <br> 'I' <br><br>Multiple movies fucking CONFIRMED</br></br></br>  <br>Don't want to burst your bubble, but that's the UBW box.</br>  <br> I know, it's a meme </br>  How do you improve Heaven's Feel?  <br>Make Sakura more interesting.</br>  <br>More Illya.

Better start learning French, I guess.  What can Ufotable add to the HF movies without ruining the pacing?<br><br>Any anime original ideas that they could put in?</br></br>  <br>Because once you clear that train wreck, you get the best possible ending ever.</br>  <br>30 minutes of Kirei explaining Fate/Zero</br>  <br>That's because it hasn't been released yet, one of the downsides of it being cheaper is that there's a delay because of reverse importation<br><br><br>$60, with free shipping<br><br><br>More Ilya bonding moments, especially if they're following the True ending</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Epilogue stuff, showing things Rider's summoning like in the HF manga, probably altering scenes with different perspectives, like when Rin and Shirou are patrolling then it goes to and interlude of Zouken and Assassin watching them. That would probably be made into one scene. Things like that.</br>  <br>Is that the uncensored version? I don't remember something so obscene.</br>   like two branches that grow together   <br>They aren't gonna really add anything I doubt. Miura's craziest idea, which he didn't even bother to mention to anyone outside of TM Ace, was a six hour movie. Even if they do multiple films, I doubt the added run time is gonna surpass that.</br>  <br>it isn't</br>  <br> sakura tree <br> branches <br>like potery</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not going to lie and pretend like Heaven's Feel isn't my favorite just to fit in on /a/. It's my favorite, and I love it. But I think Unlimited Blade Works feels like the "most legit"(yes, I'm aware all routes and bad ends are canon timelines). It's the only one I would have given an anime adaption. <br><br>Now for why it's MY personal favorite.<br><br>It is exactly what you’re thinking and I’m not at all being sarcastic when I say this. I love Heaven’s Feel because it’s gritty. It starts off with a bleak atmosphere that gradually becomes incredibly tense, and I love that. Shirou, later in the story, is falling apart mentally and later physically due to the weight of Archer’s interference and the usage of his powers only exacerbates the issue. And I love that. The sense of style in Heaven’s Feel is off the chain too. I enjoy Dark Sakura’s pimped out turtleneck. I enjoy protagonists losing their arms and having to bind replacements in bandages. I enjoy Medusa featuring prominently, because that’s my waifu and I’m not ashamed of saying that. And I enjoy True Assassin. His design is awesome. Also the fights in Heaven’s Feel are fucking amazing, and I don’t care what you say, Shirou versus Kirei and Kirei versus T.Assassin were incredible. NLBW was incredible. Saber versus Shirou and Medusa was incredible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, I should specify. UBW is the only one I would have given an anime adaption.<br><br>Heaven's Feel is what I'm referring to in the second line and the subsequent paragraph.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You've got an interesting opinion.</br></br>  <br> bad ends are canon timelines <br>Except they aren't.</br></br>  <br>because its the darkest and most mature/serious/adult route, while fate was shoujo and ubw was shounen</br>  <br> You've got an interesting opinion. <br>Like this nigga didn't just hit it out of the goddamn park</br></br>  <br>Nobody cares.</br>  <br>They are though. If it's got the TM logo on it, it's a timeline somewhere.</br>  <br>In addition to this, I like that Shirou forfeits his ideals for the sake of making sure a girl he knows is happy. (I do not like Sakura in general. Both as a character and as a general, well, person I suppose you could say. But the general idea of a damsel that she presented was the important part of the narrative. Her role. )<br><br>It tears the ideology introduced in Fate and explored thoroughly in UBW. UBW presents an idea, "Here is this concept. An ideal. There are of course cons to this, but here are the pros of following it thoroughly. Here is why it is beautiful."<br><br>But HF says "Fuck that." by exploring "One's ideal when confronted with reality". We're made to understand that Shirou's ideal shouldn't work early on. Archer's existence is proof that it can work, even if the end result is different than expected or desired. But Heaven's Feel reinforces that Shirou's ideals are fantasy that CAN NOT function in a realistic crisis. One on a scale which he was never PUT IN during the course of Unlimited Blade Works. He was forced to prioritize and decide what was more important to him, and I think, THAT is beautiful.</br></br></br></br></br>  Coincidentally I'm playing HF right now. I used to think Rider only had Straight faced sprites but, I noticed in a few scenes when she was talking about Sakura it looked like she had a tiny smile. Really cute.  <br>Because it has Rider.</br>  <br> I love Heaven’s Feel because it’s gritty. It starts off with a bleak atmosphere that gradually becomes incredibly tense, <br>It's the Tsukihime atmosphere.</br></br>  <br>It's a shame that almost the entirety of Rider's characterization revolves around Sakura.</br>  <br>I need more Rider in my life</br>  <br>It IS.<br><br><br>It really is. <br>She's so best.<br>And Sakura is so worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be a perfect ending  for me .</br>  <br><br>Her backstory in HA was fucking great though</br></br>  is prisma really Illya's route?  <br>She is so sweet.</br>   dub <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gDF<wbr>WHD9cm-E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  It's because HF is in many ways the climax of the story.<br>Consider that Fate is the introductory route. It's basically a lot of exposition to make Shirou (and the reader) familiar with the terminology and circumstances surrounding the HGW. It's also the route in which Shirou is the least effective in combat.<br><br>Unlimited Blade Works takes the same situation and puts a different spin on it. Servants that didn't make it to the spotlight in the first route shine, the atmosphere is rather different and Shirou's character arc takes center stage. Shirou's powers are finally fully explained and he's a more active combatant. <br><br>Heaven's Feel takes all the world building from previous routes and shows what happens behind the stage. It reveals the true objective of the HGW and why in many ways it was a sham. The tone is darker, as mentioned, but it fits with the fact that HF basically deconstructs the former two routes. Everything gets torn apart and put upside down; Shirou's ideals, the HGW itself, Sakura's role in the story, etc. It's also the route where Shirou's feats are arguably the most impressive, and it's also the route that ends the story - all these crazy battles close the story, and therefore leave a lasting impression about the game as a whole.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also the route where Shirou's feats are arguably the most impressive <br><br>Shirou's biggest achievement in HF was taking one life off Berserker. Shirou's biggest achievement in UBW is beating Gilgamesh, the guy who took 12 lives off Berserker.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, Shirou was only able to take that one life off because Berserker was distracted by Ilya.<br><br>Meanwhile in UBW you've got Gil saying and doing shit like this.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou's biggest achievement in HF was taking one life off Berserker <br> one life off Berserker <br>People still believe that "Dark Berserker didn't have his skin and didn't have God Hand" fanfiction?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Shirou's biggest achievement in HF was taking one life off Berserker.  <br><br>Being able to cut a Servant like Berserker to a one fifth of his body is more of an accomplishment than most characters in this game, servants and humans alike, are able to boast.<br>Also, don't forget things like Bad End 38. Shirou successfully beat Black Saber 1v1, even if it did take his life to do so. Being able to stand toe to toe with someone like Black Saber, without an ovewhelming advantage like he had against GIl, is pretty freaking impressive IMO.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people hate sakura?  <br>I like the part where Rin vow to change Shirou in UBW yet he admit that he won't change from his path while Sakura doesn't even try in HF.</br>  <br> within our lifetimes we won't see the kotomine vs shirou manly fistfight for their ideals. <br>god damn it.</br></br>  <br>Saber wanted to test Shirou's skill if I remember correctly. She could have Excaliblasted him if she really wanted to, and the whole thing still ended with Shirou dead.<br><br>Really you take SLH and HF Shirou is impressive, but not too impressive considering what we've previously seen from him.</br></br></br>  Can Shirou project Shichika?<br> Assuming they met somewhere </br>  <br> Shirou successfully beat Black Saber 1v1 <br>In a fair duel of pure swordsmanship skill, not an actual fight to the death, and borrowing Archer's secret technique.</br></br>  <br>Rin doesn't want to change his ideals, she wants to make him smile and like himself.<br><br>She succeeds.</br></br></br>  <br> she wants to make him smile and like himself. <br> She succeeds. <br>Too bad she succeeded after he became Archer and was summoned as her 17 yo self's servant.</br></br></br>  <br>Come to think of it, how much actual fighting did HF Shirou really do? There's the Berserker stuff and the Kirei fight, but I don't remember much else.<br><br>UBW has a couple of bouts with Kuzuki, takes on Archer at least twice (once in the church, where he deflects his sword spam), and then takes on Gilgamesh.<br><br>I don't want to seem stupid, it's just the UBW stuff is fresher in my mind from the anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Shirou that's with her now is happy, and they're gonna have a good future together.</br>  <br> HF It's my favorite, and I love it. But I think Unlimited Blade Works feels like the "most legit" <br><br>This. <br>A part Fate, that is for Saber fan, UBW and HF face two sides of the personality of Shirou. The first is an optimistic story and Shirou can confirm his ideals. The second, however, is more crude ( or edgy) and destroys them, but in order to understand Shirou dilemma, you must first see UBW.<br><br>They are two different possibilities both valid. It's not that just because HF is more dark, pessimistic and cynical as story, it's automatically better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a while. Then she dies, he becomes Archer, his best firend betrays him and he dies surrounded by people who hated him.</br>  <br> was a six hour movie. <br><br>Based Miura, you're not so bad after all.</br></br></br>  <br>That's really not how this stuff works. UBW Shirou doesn't become Archer. Nasu even hammered in that he /surpasses/ Archer.<br><br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope. <br> Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait. <br> The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance. <br> (To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)" <br><br> He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Saber wanted to test Shirou's skill if I remember correctly. She could have Excaliblasted him if she really wanted to, and the whole thing still ended with Shirou dead. <br><br>Not exactly true. Shirou kept pressuring her into a battle of swordsmanship and didn't give her the time to charge the attack. That's the whole point of Crane Wings, consecutive strikes from all directions. Usually you wouldn't be able to defend against all three sets of swords and get hit, but Saber was enough of a beast to even beat that. It's that Shirou was willing to be reckless enough to give his life to win that let him give a wound that should have been fatal to Saber. <br><br> In a fair duel of pure swordsmanship skill <br><br>And how is besting Saber in a battle of swordsmanship of all things is not an achievement? <br><br>  borrowing Archer's secret technique. <br><br>True, HF is indeed the route where has the most shortcuts, but it doesn't change the fact that Shirou did do those things. Even in UBW, he's constantly influenced from Archer's experience. The only route where he's hardly influenced by anything is Fate, and it's the route where he's the least impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh god her eyes...</br>  Which was more impressive, Shirou defeating Berserker or Gilgamesh?  <br>I just remembered UBW Shirou has his chase with Rin too, which led to him actually going up against Rider for a little bit, and he took on Caster's skeletons that one time at the school as well.<br><br>Am I just blanking here, or did HF Shirou really not get into a lot of fights himself?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Berserker IMO.<br>Shirou has an unfair advantage against Gil.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance. <br>Yeah, nothing of this actually happened in the ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh, because Gil killed Berserker.</br>  <br>It got truncated, but those are Nasu's notes for how he wanted the scene.<br><br>Point being, that's what's going on.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou has an unfair advantage against Gil. <br>More like Gil has an unfair advantage against everyone but Shirou and Archer.</br></br>  <br> It got truncated, but those are Nasu's notes for how he wanted the scene. <br>Why the fuck didn't they go with what Nasu wrote?</br></br>  <br>They kind of did. You see the footprints in the sand and Shirou in the distance. It's just they weren't super specific. Nasu might not have been pleased with how it was handled, because he made the note in his blog like, an hour after it aired.</br>  <br> it got truncated <br><br>Sure it did</br></br></br>  <br>He would have an advantage over them too, if adult Gil was not a fool that spams random weapons. His child version would choose magic weapons that Shirou can not parry.</br>  <br>What? Who animated that bottom scene?</br>  <br>Well it did.<br><br>Episode 25 is supposed to be expanded on the BDs though.</br></br></br>  <br>DEEN. A fair bit of UBW actually did make it into the 06 series, the school fight and Rider showing up, as well as an altered Caster arc.</br>  When the panel finally started the MC, wearing Shirou's jacket, came out to introduce himself and then stated that the panel would start with the concert by Ayano Mashiro which was a blast.<br><br>Once that was finished we began with the dub of episode 3. The dub itself was fine (and proving that the shit mixing for the trailer hurt more than helped). Mela Lee picks up where she left off as Rin as did Stephanie Sheh as Ilya. Bryce was okay for Shirou, but that's my bias for Sam Regal there. I found it funny that it took so long for him to actually speak in that episode as we only got reaction grunts for a few minutes. Archer is... okay. Not quite as off putting in the trailer, so it could be that the trailer lines were for the first episode and he settled a bit but I still prefer Liam. I found myself wishing that his voice was just a bit deeper but we'll see how it goes as he gets more screen time.<br><br>When this completed the MC returned to introduce the guests, and when Kawasumi Ayako came out she said her line in English, "I ask of you fans, are you my Master?" which was pretty sweet. I'm sure the guy who I waited in line for this panel fangasmed as he stated there that's what he hoped for.<br><br>As the guests were being introduced they had brought out four director's chairs for them to sit but had five guests. For character designer Sudo Tomonori they brought out a table and regular chair and put him to work to create an original illustration for the convention and Producer Kondo Hikaru stated that this was the first time Sudo did this in front of a lot of people. Sudo though got into a zone and was not hearing questions going his way as he worked and Kondo joked that Sudo was trying to make a deadline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> His child version would choose magic weapons that Shirou can not parry. <br> Implying he has time to choose <br> Implying Shirou would not choose Anti-Magic weapons, even faster. </br></br></br>  Rin &gt; Sakura &gt; Saber<br>fuck Saber</br>  <br>Questions were thankfully screened before the panel and much of it was for the production process as we saw stills and animatics as they progressed towards the final result which was pretty cool. A question of Heaven's Feel was answered that they were still hard at work on it and were even talking about it constantly at the convention.<br><br>Kawasumi Ayako talked about how important the role was for her now after voicing Saber for 8-9 years now. And then we got the two clips above and she was a little bit embarrassed for the Excalibur one as she said she never did it in front of a crowd. She also mentioned that when had done it in the studio she normally has her legs outstretched to put more power into it but it was hard as she was wearing a kimono for the panel.<br><br>It was then that Aniplex Producer Iwakami Atsuhiro said that he had brought out a letter written by Nasu for the fans at AX and Kawasumi read it out loud with the translation on screen behind her. It was a nice touch by the sound engineers as they played New Dawn for the reading in which Nasu expressed gratitude for the fan's enthusiasm, that its been 7 years since he attended AX and that they were still hard at work. This all ended up with Kawasumi reading another variation (from Nasu) about "Are you my Master?"<br><br>With this completed the guests left with some parting remarks and Kawasumi remarking that she had walked about AX (and when she mentioned that I was sure that I had seen her the day before among the crowds) and was surprised in a good way with how passionate the fans are.<br><br>With the guests leaving it was time for the Aimer concert to which they were to introduce her starting with clips from episode 20 (to which they botched it by started halfway though the clip before restarting) with Archer vs Shirou, seguing into Last Stardust to which she came out to sing an acoustic version of that. She then did a cover of a kalafina song before ending with Brave Shine.<br><br>Overall the panel was a blast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> More like Gil has an unfair advantage against everyone but plot armor. <br><br>Reminder that a warrior Berkser like Heracles can not parry all the Gilgamesh weapons. But Shirou can...</br></br></br>  <br> Mela Lee picks up where she left off as Rin <br><br>That's not very encouraging.</br></br></br>  <br>Saber&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sakura</br>  Sorry, you suck because you are just a side servant.  <br><br>Sorry, brah, but no.<br>Sakura is a woman.<br>Saber is a lump of feces.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Berserker doesn't have a swordspam that eliminates the majority of the incoming NPs, and he was protecting Illya the whole time.</br>  <br>NTRing rapists aren't sweet.</br>  <br>even Sakura is more interesting than Saber. At least she has fucking feelings other than<br> muh honor <br> muh duty <br> muh kingdom <br> muh I dun wanna be king <br>Fuck.Saber.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is literally a lump of worms and curses.</br>  <br><br>No, she's a woman, like Rin, Rider and most other VN heroines. <br>Zouken is literally a lump of worms.<br>Angra Mainyu is a lump of curses.<br>Saber is a lump of shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Rinfags are the worst.  <br>Wrong Rin.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter what the best route is. Best girl doesn't even get one.</br>  <br>I just hate tsunderes, remind me of 3DPD by being bitchy as fuck.</br>  <br>Sounds nothing like Rin.</br>  <br>Because Shirou is a Chad.<br>Bitches love their Chads.</br></br>  <br> Nasu expressed gratitude for the fan's enthusiasm, that its been 7 years since he attended AX <br><br>Wait, Nasu's actually been to America?</br></br></br>  <br>"Fuck! [Tohsaka Rin is] the worst Japanese in the world." -- Lord El-Melloi II, greatest living instructor of the London Clock Tower.</br>  <br>Based Waver.</br>  <br>He's just a mad weeb who's pissed she doesn't wanna play vidya with him.</br>  <br><br>Well the Rin we see in the epilogue is closer or right at the dere future Rin we saw in Hollow. In that scene, our present Rin and the future Rin argue about what kind of woman Shirou needs to be saved, with the present Rin saying that he needed a firm hand and such, basically almost like she was becoming his mother in a sense. They go back and forth arguing there cases, then the future Rin says this:<br><br> "But you know, miss, I don't 'stick with him through thick and thin.' I protect him when he struggles, lend him a hand when it really counts, and only see the best in him." <br><br> "So I'll tell you this. I don't just want to be happy together. No matter what anyone says, no matter who they are, I'm the one that will make him the happiest." <br><br>Which completely shuts the current Rin down. The funniest thing? Our Rin thought that Rin was Sakura at first.<br><br>Sakura, despite how she seems, is actually semi-firm with Shirou. Her method of working with him is just to love and support him. Some seem to think Sakura completely supports his idealogy and broken mindset, but it more just like the dere Rin described her relationship with Shirou, she supports him and only tries to see the best in him. Like in the scenes where they are talking about magecraft, she says he may lack the talent, but he has an honest stalwart faith that is admirable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  rdr &gt; cstr &gt; sbr  <br>Based El-Melloi</br>  <br><br>by whom? first it isn't even considered to be the best route in FSN mostly. second it is indeed not the best route in FSN.<br><br>Rin &gt; Saber &gt; Sakura but<br>Fate &gt; UBW &gt; HF</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Brsrkr&gt;tr sssssn&gt;rchr&gt;lncr&gt;fk sssssn</br>  <br>That is a very weird opinion. I'm not dissing it, but it's weird.<br><br>Like, if you really love Saber, I could see someone preferring Fate to the other routes, but you like Rin the most? What do you see in the Fate route that's superior?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Quite a lot actually. It and Sakura get at least as much fanart nowadays than everyone else. And it gets plenty of Japanese fanfiction too. The reaction to the route is much more positive than it was in 2004, both in the west and east. <br><br>Nasu mentions in Sakura's dictionary entry that she is one of the staffs favorites. With Aotsuki, Koyama, BLACK, OKSG, and more prominent members loving her.<br><br>That, and over the years, Sakura has gotten more and more fans and climbs up the complete character poll each time it's shown. Being in the top ten of every character in the company constantly (in an international poll no less) is impressive. She hasn't unseated Rin or Saber, but people that still harp about her being unpopular kind of miss the point. And that is with much less exposure than Rin or Saber get.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>just personal feelings. the Fate route is the most coherent and substantial one to me, though I'm not a Saberfag. I suspected Rin to fuck me over until the end because she got her special intro with the summoning of Archer, her dissapointment because she preferred Saber, those "vague" excuses why she wants to stay around. Tohsakas actions towards the end blew me away. though it's not the route centered around her I liked her best in this one. UBW seemed a little bit too forced with Archer and this whole Hero of Justice thing, I expected him to be an awesome Heroic Spirit but from the whole cast of servants he probably was the most lame one, in the end it was pretty much the nice but nothing special Tohsaka love route. HF was a little bit too much, I didn't like Sakura from the beginning but at least she has some development in character in this one, also Rider has a major role which is a plus to me.</br></br>  <br>Cut half of it and officially make it the Illya route.</br>  <br> Prisma </br>  <br><br> I suspected Rin to fuck me over until the end <br><br>You..wut?<br><br>You expected that the girl who sacrificed her father's heirloom, knowing how much of a daddy's girl she ends up being, to screw you over? Really?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I didn't like Sakura from the beginning <br>sorry, I meant "in the beginning". after HF and FHA she got a major push in my personal ranking</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, okay. I mean it's not an uncommon opinion to actually think Archer is the best servant. I guess it really hinges on your opinion of Shirou though. UBW as a whole does, I guess.<br><br>I'm not sure though if Fate really works as being the most coherent though. A lot of the servants actually kind of get screwed over in it, and die off screen or hardly get to do anything. I think that only happens once in UBW. It happens a lot in HF though due to The Shadow, but HF focuses on stuff outside the servants.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I honestly did. I thought she was scheming like a little devil and that the final fight would be against her (probably around 70% completion, when Gil wasn't introduced), also Issei's trash talk did his part. and I got my shit fucked up by Illya several times so I pretty much was like "magi will fuck you over as soon as they can"</br></br>  <br>Rin will fuck Shirou, but she will not fuck him over.</br>  <br><br>I felt like a fucking piece of shit when pic related happened</br></br>  <br>Just a flesh wound.</br>  <br><br>At the beginning, Saber cuts off Archer's arm and it gets stuck to Shirou before he dies. Saber then proceeds to go out for food as Shirou can't cook that night, where she gets ambushed and corrupted. From there I think we can just jump to the final fight, really.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's about how the UBW movie was paced. Literally everything before day 14 in the movie happens in a span of 24 hours.</br>  <br>Why didn't Rin just stab Kirei?</br>  <br><br>because she wanted to rescue Illya in a rush and Kirei got her by suprise if I remember right</br></br>  <br> basically almost like she was becoming his mother in a sense </br>  <br>Rin has something like only a 20% chance to win against Kirei due to him smack talking her when they fight. I wish I could find where Nasu answered this.</br>  <br><br>This seems kind of stupid, by all rights, the entire game should be "Dark and edgy" with lolis having their eyes cut out and heart ripped, children being made into living mummies, girls getting their heads punched off, a guy being vivsected and tortured by a little girl who plans to use his head as a plaything.<br><br>Like, HF is far from having the only extreme supernatural violence, gore, or suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate route had a scene where we saw decomposing children<br><br>That anon is clearly smoking something</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, the basement scene and the Ilya scene are kind of isolated cases, and both the DEEN anime and the Ufotable anime danced around them a fair bit.<br><br>There's a reason HF is getting the movie. You can't show a lot of that shit on TV.</br></br></br>  <br>Rider was the first person to be done with Shirou's hero shit. She came back after Sakura ordered her to go watch over Shriou while she's keeled over on the floor and putting herself closer to death by using Rider. Then after Shirou comes back and is still insisting on fighting and possibly turning on Sakura if he has to even though she's dying, spent the past eleven years of her life living in shit, and all she want is for him to come home safe and be with her. The Rider basically says, "I don't fuck with you." and is going to kill the next person who fucks with Sakura. Also, the second time she asks her to protect Shirou if he doesn't say he'll be for Sakura until the end She peaces the fuck out of there.<br><br>Rider was the OG Sakurafag.</br></br></br>  <br>What a terrible character trait.</br>  <br>Poor Sakura, being paired with the worst Servant.</br>  <br>Rider is is willing to kill for her waifu. Can you say the same?</br>  <br>Rider is also willing to NTR her waifu.</br>  <br><br>The best part of that scene was that the truth behind that was, she used to love humans, and broke down over time. The dialogue she had with Avenger about the boundary between human and monster was interesting.<br><br>And the reason she was able to be summoned in human form was because she honestly found a kindred spirit with a human, and became a heroic spirit, when she was originally a spirit of nature, opposed to humans. <br><br>She loved (yes it says "ai" not "suki") Sakura was because she still held out hope despite everything and tried to love the world regardless. <br><br>You really get a good range of why she is the way she is with that scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would've loved a scene like that in HF. I would've liked Caster's in UBW also.</br>   Want to rewatch UBW pretty fucking bad <br> BDs are just a couple months away with new content and no retarded dimming <br><br>Literally three months to the day.</br></br></br>  <br>Rider showing her protective nee-san qualities. Although she describes herself as a younger sister type character in Hollow.</br>  <br>because mapo tofu</br>  <br><br>It wouldn't make sense for it to happen in HF. That scene had Medusa almost going Gorgon because she was clearing Fuyuki's streets of the Avenger corpses and enjoying the bloodbath a little too much. There was a cool scene where she imitates Dio by crushing a few with steamrollers in a frenzy, so it might be a good slap for those people who think she is a weak servant.<br><br>But still, it only fit in the time loop narrative of Hollow(with Rider remembering why she was so loyal to Sakura and disappearing in the end to repeat the loop).</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is a weak servant though.</br>  <br> If you want the best love story then go with Fate. <br><br>Consider suicide, faggot.</br></br></br>  What would you do if the HF Movie(s) end with HF Normal and  in the epilogue show LE.   <br> with Saber Alter. </br>  <br> What would you do if the HF Movie(s) end with HF Normal <br><br>I legit think it would be pretty cool. I at least wouldn't mind seeing it animated, but I doubt it'll happen.<br><br> in the epilogue show LE. <br><br>That'd just kind off as a bit out of place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course he does, he goes to E3 every fucking year.</br>  <br> LE <br>I'd expect it after the Fate adaptation<br> heh never <br>Nasu will probably just write another revamped LE saber novel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I personally disliked some of it. Sakura, The Shadow or as I call it "The Anti-Servant plot device", and more I disliked. I say the best scenes are at the last 20 or so minutes but come on.<br><br>Heaven's Feel could have been better. Just get rid of Sakura &amp; make it an Ilya route.</br></br></br>  <br>Remove Worms, add Cups.</br>  <br>The Shadow is really fucking bullshit. I get that the servants weren't really supposed to be the man focus of HF, but that thing is a walking plot device to remove them from the story.</br>  <br>Shirou did.</br>  <br>HF is litterally the worst route to adapt</br>  <br>People believe that a Berserker lacking sight &amp; after receiving an Excaliblast &amp; other injuries from Saber Alter is weaker than normal.</br>  <br><br>one house or depending on car payment for blue ray disks fuck off give me a cheaper digital download version only shit</br></br>  <br>Heaven's Feel is a ritual related to the Holy Grail anyways. The title of the route is more related to Ilya than Sakura (kinda like how UBW is more related to Shirou &amp; Archer than Rin). Sakura's route should have been named "Educated Prostitute Worms".</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Berserker lost 3 lives before he fought Shirou.<br> One(?) before he was retreating with Illya from the Shadow and ZOuken <br> One from Saber Alter <br> and one more when he was ebing taken into the pit, if he didn't lose two from their first encounter with the Shadow <br><br><br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess you're not a real Type-Moon fan, are you.</br>  <br>I didn't keep track. Also, I'm unsure how many lives were lost to Shadow. Ripping off his skin is bound to cause some damage but I don't know.</br>  <br> being a fan of meme-moon <br>call me when their are not 3 sabers that look all the same,or when their are not 3 archers that are all shirou,basically call me when they get original designs and stop copying and reusing old ones and simply changing name.</br></br>  <br>I dunno anon, I like "Educated Prostitutes feat. Worms" better.</br>  <br>You know what? I will do that.</br>  You bang rider and sakura at the same time. That is all i need.  <br>Does it mention the part about how Sakura's mute? She can't talk. Maybe it's because of the penis in her mouth.</br>  F/SN Sakurafag rankings<br><br>Rider=Shirou&gt;&gt;Taiga&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rin</br></br>  <br>No, that's F/HA not FS/N.</br>  <br> 3 sabers <br><br>We already have 6 (4, if you don't count lily&amp;alter) of them.</br></br></br>  <br>liar anon you wont QQ meme moon will ride the meme train and never create orignal meme content every</br>  <br>That's in HA, not FSN. And it's actually just an illusion, so Rider is in fact cuckolding Sakura.</br>  I stopped caring after I saw 3 does it even if here is more matter anymore. Those whom care about their waifu whom is saber are clearly are swallow and only care about outwards appearance or else they would shit all day about X slut looks like my waifu whom is pure.  Does Ufotable do events for other holidays? I remember seeing a New Years card.  Are there plans to adapt HA? I need more Bazett and manjew  <br>Ufotable have way too much on their plate right now.</br>  <br>Really far away</br>  <br><br>Why even live</br></br>  I can't get over "routes". Routes are awful. I need canon. Even if you say one route is regarding canon, there's still other routes sitting there. That bothers me.  <br>This is a visual novel anon. Alternate routes are extremely common.</br>      <br>Reading Tsuikihime right now and j started it becuase of scenes in heavens feel like that rabbit one. The insanity scenes and atmosphere are great</br>    <br>Seeing obvious bait has now oddly become an enjoyable thing for me, since there's a chance of new Noble Baitasms like pic related popping out.</br>  Sakura a QT  <br><br>Called it! <br>Are you NLBW anon or Excalibait anon?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Divine bait, flawless and firm.<br>Our hooks rip the threads<br>our ruse split the board<br>our anonymity reaching the local news<br>two great shitposters, shared butthurt</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now I remember how much team purple annoyed me in this route, MUH SENPAI, MUH SAKURA. Just one note annoyances, especially with how fun Saber,Shirou and Rin interactions were. With these two, it feels like walking on eggshells. Are they better in Hollow?</br>  <br>Yeah. I still prefer the Shirou/Rin/Saber trio though</br>  <br>I felt the exact opposite. I love Sakura and Rider, but hated Rin's dumb rooftop scene where her ans Shirou would get really flustered.</br>  <br>Rider is still pretty much "muh sakura" but less cold. Everyone in shirou's house is down to fuck and I guess that creates tension in potential romantic situations.</br>  <br> Just one note annoyances, especially with how fun Saber,Shirou and Rin interactions were. <br>You mean girls shouldn't fight and baka shirou?</br></br>  <br>Does it really count if it's a dream? Plus it basically said that Dream Sakura was cool with it.</br>  <br>Why does Rider keep trying to fuck that archer girl in HA? Seems weird how suddenly shes a lesbian all of a sudden.</br>  <br>Dream Sakura is likely superior to the actual one.</br>  <br>Does shichika hard counter any servant that uses a weapon?</br>    <br> all of a sudden </br>  <br>Rider is just a lewd mare</br>  <br>Shichika is a Noble Phantasm with the ability to "destroying other Noble Phantasms"</br>  <br><br>Will Gay Bulge be the Master Bait?</br></br>  <br>The "bait, on" pic is already two days old, it's a repost. I use different filenames. And Excalibait is a different guy, I guess he did Baitllerophon and Rule Baiter as well. I just did Baet Bolg, prototype Bait Aias, NLBW and this.</br>  <br>There is already one of those.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, I didn't notice the "or" and assumed "and", thus talking about different guy. My bad. But well, at least it's been clarified.</br></br>  <br>Now we juat need baitgarach</br>  <br>I unironically love DEEN for this</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>I have a feeling Kane is extremely lewd</br>  <br>Just re-read it, after all the hype /a/ was giving it I thought I may had missed some parts. Still the same shit I read on my first time, horrible pacing, the dark atmosphere was bland, Sakura is still fucking annoying, the Illya scenes are cute but it's too short. The ending was cool but it doesn't make up for the beginning or middle.<br>Can anyone explain when did Shirou have the ability to copy NP abilities from a weapon that doesn't have it? Or was that just an asspull.</br></br>  <br><br>I knew I should have attached carlos.jpg</br></br>  <br>Since Fate, when he projects Caliburn</br>  <br> an anyone explain when did Shirou have the ability to copy NP abilities <br><br>There's a huge event that explains all of that, several times. A very obvious explanation.</br></br></br>  <br>Rock=/=Caliburn<br><br>The rock wasn't wielded by Berserker in life nor did it have any strong significance. Also NP abilities=/= the sword moving on its own.</br></br></br>  <br>you talking about NLBW, thats not an ability of the weapon, but a skill of the user, similar to assassins tsubame gaeshi<br><br>if you remember shirous specific brand of magic, when he trraces a weapon he doesnt just trace the weapon and its abilities but the experience that the used might have, this shit is explained multiple times in every route</br></br></br>  <br>He's a tip. You know which scene you question is about, so go read it again, figure it out for yourself, and fuck off.</br>  <br> Because it's gritty <br><br>Have to agree. We spend the entire VN hearing about how horrible the war is, but outside of the bad ends and a handfull of scenes the Holy Grail War isn't actually that dark in the routes, it could be a Shonen.<br><br>Heaven's Feel is the only route that truly gets the grim situation and the bleak atmosphere of the War right.</br></br></br></br></br>  it's shit. a little better than fate, but still pure shit.  <br>You do know that the Rock-axe never had that ability done with it, It just doesn't make sense.</br>  <br><br>He is one of those bad Ilya fans (I like you guys, but some of your less intelligent brethren pick on Sakura a bit too much) who didn't really pay much attention to things.<br><br>Ironically, he would probably call the doll body an ass pull despite his favoritest favorite Ilya having a 20 minute long explanation about mages using spare bodies with a demonstration on moving the consciousness to boot.</br></br></br></br>  I would like to see the wonderroute where noone dies that leads up to hollow ataraxia.  <br>I dunno anon, Tsukihime's atmosphere is much better than HF.</br>  can a person like the routes for purely different reasons, because i do  <br>Yes, someone can also hate all of the routes.</br>  <br>i would assume that because berserker wields it he can trace the users experience and specific abilities, he doesnt actually need to see it being used, and either way, he was taking the Axe-sword and shit from archer</br>  <br>Okay then it was an asspull for that specific moment, he could now access not the swords experience which is what he always did but the user.</br>  Why do you like what you like about fate?  Where was Gilgamesh in Heaven's Feel?  <br>Telling Sakura to kill herself</br>  <br>Doing fuck all inside Kirei's basement and being eaten by a Highschooler.</br>  <br>He got eaten by a pile of worms like the retarded faggot he is.</br>  <br>I like chuuni bullshit and cute blondes with cute flaws like eating a lot</br>  <br>I remember stitching this in paint like a year ago</br>  It gets good in the Taiga route.  <br> Bait Aias <br>Why is no one calling it Roe Aias?

Because I've done it before </br>  <br>Story time?</br>  <br>The only reason I even like NTR is because all these fat old fucks knows how to fuck a girl into a crazy mess. Vanilla sex is good and all but I need some rough hardcore sex from time to time</br>  <br>There really isn't much of a story, though. I just got a girl to cheat on her boyfriend with me.</br>  <br>But anon, I love fat 40 year old oyajis fucking 20 year old college sluts.<br><br><br>NTR a best fetish, worst fetish belongs to either scat, bdsm, futa, yuri, yaoi, vore, or furfags</br></br></br></br>  <br> I know some of you can relate since you are similar to that disgusting old man. <br>Not really, but it's mostly because of, especially when you see what that "lovely couple" relationship truly is.</br></br>  <br><br>Why do you hate fun?</br></br>  <br>It's a fetish that exists in a mad world.</br>  <br>yet is the only genre that gives me big dicks making women crazy.<br>Vanilla is too boring.</br></br>  The minute you realize the characters in an NTR flick brought it upon themselves with their logic is the instant you can enjoy NTR. Don't emotionally invest yourself, laugh at MC.<br><br>Give it a shot with Otome Dori.</br></br>  <br>Worst fetishists are furries. Worst fetish is scat or necro (undead don't count as necro).</br>  <br> I love fat 40 year old oyajis <br>I'm glad im not the only one</br></br>  Feeling bad about NTR is fine but hating on it like a fanboy never fails to make me laugh. It's either you're a beta herbivore human or you have the perception of reality and fiction overlapping each other.  <br> Why do you hate fun? <br>I don't, I like NTR BECAUSE I like fun.<br> And because I'm a sadist </br></br></br>    <br>I'll never get why this angers people. <br>Probably not American enough.</br></br>  I maintain that while types A and C have their charm, so to speak, type B is an abomination, an insult against the human species.<br><br>However, sharing/wife swapping &gt; all types of NTR.</br></br>  <br>What about a fat 40 year old dicking a girl without a man?</br>  <br>Eh, I sort of agree with your opinion on B but only when it involves magic rapedrugs or hypnosis, and only because it's boring. I tend to treat 'muh responsibility/honor' or 'if I do this, you'll leave me alone right?' as comedy and just enjoy the ride.<br><br> sharing <br><br>Mah nigga. Now I feel like rewatching Aisai Nikki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But anon, I love fat 40 year old oyajis fucking 20 year old college sluts. <br> not 20 years old college guys fucking 40 year old babaas <br>Step it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Not NTR.</br>  <br> OP here <br>Now that's something I can get behind.</br></br>  <br>So i can read the first part of Cast Aoi, just not the second part?</br>  <br> caring about other people's fetish <br>Why do you even read NTR if it triggers you?</br></br>    <br>I never get you people. Are you self-inserting as the cuck-beta MC or something(always self-insert as the girl if you must)? Are you just new to h-manga and doujinshi? Have you somehow managed to stay "pure" after a long time? Because vanilla gets fucking boring after a while, and I have found myself in circles going back and forth quite a lot the past few years. These days, I mostly just open the front page of the panda and go from there following what my dick tells me.</br>  <br> make him my concubine, make him my thing! <br><br>The best.</br></br></br>  <br>That one was great.<br> get that boipussy </br></br>  <br> oh shit new yunioshi <br> oh shit brown tomboy wife <br> it's NTR <br><br>hello darkness, my old sexfriend</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Truly an epic for the ages.</br>  <br>Trash for Trash</br>    <br>Can't blame them for auto-inserting as a beta. I just use them for laughs.</br>  <br> Wani <br>Hope you saved it.</br></br>    <br>Alright i need a name, love me some boipussy</br>  <br>Epilogue.</br>  <br>If only there was a way to find it again.<br><br>Oh look, took me 5 seconds</br></br></br>  <br>You realize when you divide fetishes into acceptable and unacceptable you're not better than normies that would ban anything abnormal?<br>You don't like it? Steer clear of it but don't try to stop it just because it's not your cup of tea.</br></br>  <br>It's boring either way, it always involves the exact same formulaic development, and the same lines. <br>Not to mention that it's a huge insult to the character herself, as it shows that she's not even a character, just a cliche-spouting device.</br></br>  The only NTR I find acceptable is with hot people. No fat disgusting fucks allowed.  <br>Same here. It's difficult to find that, though. Ugly weebs need to self-insert.</br>  <br>Some like it for the humiliation aspect but to me it's just gross. Then again hot men are rare in hentai doujins so there's also that. You have to compromise for average.</br>  <br>But i like the fat fucks ;_;<br>Also doesn't help that i have a scent fetish and they probably smell the best</br></br>  <br> Some like it for the humiliation aspect <br>Exactly, that's why I have no problem with it. <br> stuck up cocky bitch/extremely pure maiden gangbanged by a bunch of fat fucks/hot guys <br>Too many favorites come to mind.</br></br></br></br>  In NTR there are two types of characters.<br><br>The diligent nice guy who works hard and is socially competent, but also pretty beta in that after his wife is raped or turned cockthirsty or wtv still stays with her.<br><br>The other guy/ guys that are normally very physically unattractive shitty people who only care about getting their dicks wet.<br><br>People who like NTR self-insert as the other guy cause IRL they're unattractive shitty people. People who don't like NTR normally inadvertently empathize with the lead who works hard.<br><br>The only NTR manga I read that I could say left me not hating it was one where the girl chose to go with the shithead but wound up in a piss poor apartment, pregnant with god knows whose kid, while her previous lover abandoned her as soon as she got cockthirsty and found a new hotness for himself.<br><br>Oh, girls also like NTR, since the girl is technically really desirable and is generally active with more than one guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Only reason why NTR is popular is because of ahegao. deny this and I will fuck you in the ass  Korean scans.<br><br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>461441</wbr></br></br>  “The image is the omake at the end of volume 26 that will be out on the 17th.

Fatima comes in to inform her about the slaves sales and has a little quarrel with subordinate number 1.<br><br>We cut to Masrur “playing” with the other kids. They want to know why the strenght and the red hair. Masrur replies that he’s “a Fanalis”. Sinbad is as unresponsive as always when Fatima comes to fetch him. <br><br>At Remano, Ja’far has met Rashid, but the king of Balbadd tells the kid that Mariadel Company’s activities (slavery) are legal in Reim and it’s also very important company for Reim. Reim’s economy depends on slavery for their prosperity and Rashid taking action to rescue Sinbad could end in a diplomatic conflict between Balbadd and Reim (remember that Titus omake). Basically: he cannot help Sinbad.<br><br>Poor Ja’far despairs: “He brought all of us together, he gave me a place to stay he showed me the world can be a bright place. And now, it doesn’t matter how much I’ve grown, it´s still the same: I can’t help the people who matter to me!!!” <br><br>However, Rashi also tells Ja’far not to give up yet. Even if he’s in Reim as Rashid Saluja, king of Balbadd, he’s also allowed to have “his free time” and can meet with Ja’far as a private person. He’s not saying anything else for the moment but “maybe they could have tea together again some other time”. Rashid leaves it at that and Ja’far realizes it’s a hint and decides to stay at Remano for the moment.<br><br>When Ja’far leaves, Rashid also makes a brief comment about being looking for “that kid” with no luck finding him . Apparently, all the Mariadel problem made him think what could have happened to “that kid” (most likely Alibaba).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>To end the chapter, we find out Maader has assigned Sinbad to Fatima (as a vice-leader or something like that).
