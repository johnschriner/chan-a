Or will it ruin parts 4, 5 and 6 for me in some way?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so the translations in that are shit and not worth reading basically?</br></br>  <br>Duwang has the general idea/sentiments of the translation down but with horrible grammar and phrasing. It's good for memes I guess, but stick to Part 4 "The invincible trio" scans</br>  <br>Don't skip parts</br>  <br> Wants more JoJo <br> Hasn,t read it <br><br>Dude, that's the opposite of a problem.

She loves high heels, even for males.</br>  <br>He already did stuff with those colors in [C]<br>"Good evening. Are you feeling well? As you can see right now, the ending theme of TV series [C] mostly uses three colors, and does that on purpose. These three colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, and these colors were chosen to represent Kimimaro, Mashu and the Financial District, respectively. They were deduced by the color of worn clothes and overall visual impression. Basically, cyan = Kimimaro, magenta = Mashu, and yellow = the Financial District. This is why the cube that is the central point of the ending visuals stays cyan for the whole time and without changing its color to magenta, for example.<br><br>Moreover, cyan, magenta and yellow become black if you mix them together. This is, in a word, the future. The future, a mental phenomenon that cannot be observed, stays covered in darkness to us who can only live in the present (This is why the words about “bright future” have such a great impact. Because the future is usually dark, and one is relieved when there is hope about it). However, as the future is always the result of your own actions, like when cyan=Kimimaro, cyan=Mashu and yellow=District are mixed together, everyone should not hesitate and mix other colors together. As this theme will get developed in more detail soon, I thought I should take the risk and tell you about it now."</br></br></br></br>  <br>ｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ</br>  Blood or bond?  <br>Blood.</br>  <br>That girl on the right better not be an attempt at Tohka...</br>  <br> Both.</br>  The first single Seiten Galaxy Cross was leaked ahead of release date on Nyaa.<br>Here's the full song<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/wfjtczrnqa.fla<wbr>c</wbr></br></br>      <br>I want to make love to anons like Miku and Bikkie do with each other, cute lovely playful consensual sometimes wild vanilla things.</br>  <br>Gay as fuck</br>  <br> intentionally shit on people for years  <br> wahh why do they say mean things  <br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br>   people complaining first few episodes are slice of life and not constant punching <br><br>why are people watching this if they havent seen DBZ?</br></br>  <br>apart from that SSJ3 transition.

Were you all excited for the translation of Rance 5D and Rance 6 that are coming out next month? Because neither is happening now. Both translators are now working for Mangagamer, all fan translations have been dropped, and the main translator, Maria, has confirmed that she was never planning to release a translation in the first place. Enjoy the official translation of Beat Blades Haruka sometime next year!  Anything after Sengoku Rance wasn't fun  Maria sounds like a real cunt, but Mangagamer is still ok in my book.  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  <br> Were you all excited for the translation of Rance 5D and Rance 6 that are coming out next month? <br>No, because I learnt Japanese.<br><br>All the Rance games aside from SR are dogshit anyway.

Why did he follow the strategy Archer told Rin when they first met?
