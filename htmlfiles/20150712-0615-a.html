I thought maybe it just hadn't fully replenished from last time, but again today it's the same amount. I took a look at my stats and noticed my mod power seemed lower, and after comparing it to a comment I had made back in February confirmed that it is now 3 less than what it used to be.</br>  I don't like Okina that much but I respect her for the incredible amount of constant reativity she puts in all her stories, especially those longer than just a couple of chapters.  <br> her <br>Stop the memes please</br></br>    One page a week <br><br>Why are /western/ so fucking lazy? <br><br>Anyways, MILF with small breasts/big ass?

So it really comes down to style which is personal taste. I don't give a shit about tracing, only the end product.

The only things i do that could affect my sleep could be:<br>Lack of sleep, cant sleep in peace if i do, sleeping late and waking up late, etc.</br></br>  <br><br>Typically being aware you're in a dream but not awake enough to become conscious. Bonus: if you wake up during lucid dreaming you can be in sleep paralysis and start experiencing hallucinations!</br></br>  <br>Google Search 'ehentai reader android'</br>  <br>Should i be worried about them? Its not the first time it happens, the last 3 times were wet dreams too but it happens once every 2~5 months.<br>They don't sound that bad.</br></br>  <br>Good luck.<br>I'm still looking for a good one for regular manga.</br></br>  <br><br>No. Lucid dreaming is something you have to work at to get better. Typically involves having a dream diary and trying to recall your dreams immediately upon waking. And sleep paralysis tends to happen most if you sleep on your back. Wet dreams are something else.</br></br>  <br> no YnD in an anal thread <br>http://exhentai.org/g/255822/4a46a9<wbr>fbf3/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I see, thanks for the explanation, i will try to search more about them since this is interesting and something that started to happen with more frequency.</br>  Get onboard Pop9's wild ride /a/.  <br>ComicRack is the best comic reader there is.</br>  <br>http://g.e-hentai.org/tools.php?act<wbr>=track_expunge</wbr></br>  <br>Thank you moral guardians.</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll check it out.<br>I've been using Mango, which has some nice features but which has some bugs and gets an update about once every year.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks again anon.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/826878/7be285<wbr>60f9/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/823007/7cd48d<wbr>beff/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/822910/80ffd3<wbr>bdae/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821292/b8c318<wbr>da9c/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/820046/155be9<wbr>3e5d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821320/281c83<wbr>3a1b/<br><br>Fuck these niggers.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>and this is why we have the panda</br>  <br> anyhoo <br> not anywho </br></br>  <br>They'ren't talking about persons, the're talking about Hoos!</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/831775/8c3a68<wbr>d782/</wbr>  <br>nalvas, fresh off the press<br>http://exhentai.org/g/831787/5fd8d7<wbr>cb4e/<br><br>BIG TITS EDITION</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> anal <br>http://exhentai.org/g/830382/a6a867<wbr>16c7/</wbr></br></br>  Can you do better job at editing than this?<br><br>http://exhentai.org/s/be03c2bb79/83<wbr>1795-1</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Is there any need to turn them into a general?</br></br>  <br> Is there any need to turn them into a general? <br>There isn't, but the threads steadily going downhill as we approached the anime airing was more or less expected.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You are all so mean</br></br></br>  <br>The second the anime aired.</br>   people getting triggered by the word edition   Why is every single window in the school broken anyway? Who broke them, because there's no reason for the zombies to have done it.  <br>Shovel broke them for fun</br>  <br>The seriousness of their situation was so thick the windows shattered.</br>  <br>Maybe they were tired with opening and closing the windows</br>  <br> shovel unpolished  <br>atleast that dog isn't dead. And no, I will not believe your fake spoilers that.</br></br>  <br>Not all of the windows are broken. Just most. <br><br>Standard apocalypse shenanigans.</br></br></br>  I have to ask, when she is day dreaming and thinks shes in class does she just sit down in the broken glass and blood and sit there for hours at time pretending shes in class? And the other girls just let her do this?  <br>They broke it to easily throw zombies out in their clearing operations.</br>  <br>The other girls probably pick her up sooner or later with some reason.</br>  <br>She's happy like that. Why would you make people sad?</br>  <br>I doubt they know how to handle somebody who went insane.</br>  <br>The health risks of sitting in broken glass and other peoples blood is fucking mind boggling, I certainly wouldn't let her even if she is insane</br>  <br>Rii and Kurumi let her be, because Yuki's delusional cheerfulness helps them cope with the fact that they're in a zombie apocalypse.</br>  <br><br>It's for their own sanity as well. Yuki loving her school life is what makes their grueling daily struggle bearable.</br></br>  Manga people, how often does it update? I just finished reading all the way up to the current chapter.  <br>Yeah I get it. I quite wondered too, why they didn't clean the classroom atleast. However I can imagine that she will think that they are not there when they clean the blood.</br>  <br>Huh never thought of it like that, you might be on to something, still dangerous tho</br>  <br>They cleaned their living quarters. Classrooms really don't have any use to them, so I don't see why you'd take the time to clean those unused space up.</br>  <br>https://rkeg.wordpress.com/2015/07/<wbr>09/re-gakkou-gurashi/</wbr></br>  <br>I just want the raws</br>  <br>Only in chink and gook.

She is probably laying in weeks old splattered blood.  <br>Monthly</br>  <br>You got a problem with that? The smell of blood is a good way to remind yourself that you are still alive.</br>  Yuki's delusions work in a way that still lets her be well aware of any dangers in her surroundings. I'm sure she cleaned her own chair and desk at least over the pretense that it was dusty or whatever.

There's no connection here.<br><br><br>You are not Annie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First quote was meant for </br>  <br>Looks like normal crystallization, she wanted to save her life and information.</br>  <br><br>or maybe Eren crystallized Annie himself accidentally with his subconscious because he wanted to protect her? <br>He has accidentally used a bunch of his powers <br><br>in the anime, he might've been thinking about protecting her from ragetard version of himself in the back of his mind. he paused for abit just like how he paused right after seeing the female titan use Annie's stance<br><br>and in the manga, he might've been thinking about protecting her from the pissed the fuck off corpsmen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She obviously did it herself.</br>  <br>This pic is kinda disturbing if you haven't seen the anime.</br>  <br><br><br>you guys think she was able to do that after getting dumpstered?<br><br>Reiner in ch.70 after losing to MT was unconscious <br>Eren was unconscious multiple times after getting beaten<br><br><br>look how destroyed she was in the anime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How long until they start harvesting Eren's spinal fluid to cure Titans back into people?  <br>I still see no problem with it, crystallizing doesn't seem like a huge deal for shifters, look at how many times Annie did it, and Reiner has his crystals on all the time.</br>  why did we get the POV of a wall titan breaking out right before Eren became the mega ragetard right after this   <br>Seems to be fucking Eren up though, it must take some practice to get good at it.</br>  <br>Obviously. Eren only just learned to utilize his powers while Annie has been trained since early childhood.</br>  So Eren might make new blades with crystals, making it possible to hurt Reiner and taking away the problem with the normal blades losing its edge after just a couple cuts.<br>Do you think he could possibly also pull a Kars with arm blades or blades in other body parts while in human form? That sure would come in hand, specially because everyone wants to capture him</br>  <br>she didn't have the energy and she could've been unconscious <br><br>look at pic related<br><br>I think if she was conscious, she didn't have the energy to crystallize herself so she took Eren's energy <br>or maybe Eren did everything himself accidentally <br>or the First King intervened<br><br>in the manga and the anime, both times Eren is focused on her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If anything, the First King might have controlled Eren in chapter 50.</br></br>  <br>She was more than conscious, read the manga.</br>  <br><br>And please stop using the anime as evidence for plot related topics, unless it's supplementary filler. The anime changed this chapter a lot, in the manga it was even more evident that Annie crystallized herself by her own will.</br></br>    <br/>  <br>What's up with Eren's shark teeth? The anime really butchered this scene.</br>  I hope Hounori keeps drawing Shingeki stuff, I really miss Spoof.  <br><br><br>look at and your own pic<br><br>Do you think it was a complete coincidence that the crystal fit perfectly in his hand and that she did it as soon as he touched her?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>has Isayama called that part of the anime not canon or something?</br>  <br>Why would you consider the anime canon over the manga?</br>  <br>Because its better</br>  <br>He didn't say anything about that part, but it's one of the few parts where anime filler contradicts the manga, and the source material is always more canon than spinoffs and adaptations. You can use spinoffs and adaptations, but not to debate the validity of the source material.</br>  <br><br>how does it look more evident that she did it herself in the manga? Just because she was awake?<br>why didn't she crystallize sooner?<br><br>in <br>the looks she's giving looks like she's saying "I'm going to fail you father"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They literally had to make him as edgy as possible</br>  <br>Even in the anime Eren was fighting against it, trying to pull away</br>  Pardon the intrusion, but does anyone know where I can read chapter 71? I don't live in the U.S., so can't access Crunchyroll, and all the other usual sites either don't have it or are 404.  <br>but the anime isn't canon remember<br><br>in the manga he helps her make the perfect sized crystal for his hand</br></br></br>  <br>and by he I mean the First King</br>  <br> why didn't she crystallize sooner? <br><br>Because she had a chance to escape before that so why would she. She crystallized once it was clear she was about to be captured, it wouldn't have made sense for her to do it any sooner than when she did. There is no logic to the idea that Eren did it, he didn't even have the ability to crystallize prior to recent chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>How about this?<br> http://mangatown.com/manga/shingeki<wbr>_no_kyojin/c071/45.html</wbr> </br></br>  <br>Google-kun</br>  <br>there's reasons logical reasons why I think Annie didn't do it in the manga<br> she was low on energy <br> emotionally unstable <br> dazed <br><br>and I think Eren did it because<br> he was touching her <br> he has the power of the first king that might be able to do this <br> he can crystallize stuff too <br> he might still have feelings for her (she's PTFO towards Reiner and Bert after finding out they're titans but not to her) <br> he has accidentally used his powers before <br> he subsconciously uses his powers  <br><br>the anime has so much more evidence that he helped her crystallized and a bunch of other points</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just get a 404 Not Found.</br>  <br> Eren <br> Reiss <br>Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Annie and the First King are on the same side at all.

Better than nothing.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Eren/Reiner, Bert/Armin, Annie/Mikasa for final shonen showdown. Screencap this.</br>  <br><br>Retarded as this OP may be, Eren -does- look like the first king here.<br><br>His hair, the blue eyes, the sharp teeth. He looks like alot like the original titan.<br><br>I think Isayama may have tipped them off to something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren beating Reiner and Mikasa beating Annie will be easy, but how will Armin beat Bert?</br>  <br>You're not the first assuming this, retard.</br>  <br>crying and yelling at him<br>Bertolt is a soft nigga</br></br>  <br>with jokes</br>  <br>Eren/Reiner, Bert/Mikasa, Annie/Armin.</br>  <br>With his super mind powers.</br>  <br>hey it worked here against that bearded titan</br>  <br> Bert/Mikasa <br>No connection between them and it would be boring as fuck to see her just run up on him and slice him out of the titan. Bert is easily stronger than Reiner or Annie, he can't be taken down with swords, but with tactic. Armin is already the humble crybaby out of EMA and he already fucked with Bert once, so he'll do it again.</br></br>  <br>why didn't the bearded titan eat him here? was Armin that annoying?</br>  I actually think Ymir will be the one to take down Bert. <br>Bert'll use his Colossal blowing off steam power, and only the healing ability of Ymir's titan form will allow her to get close enough to climb up the Colossal and rip Bert from its neck.</br>  <br>Also Annie/Mikasa is an obvious one.</br>  <br>Because about 5 seconds later Eren turned into a titan and killed it. Armin's mind just went dead after seeing Eren get eaten and he didn't see Eren's titan form emerge and start killing things.</br>  <br> No connection between them <br>Both are autistic?</br></br>    <br>That makes way more sense than my theory that Armin made all the titans skip over him because he made him think he was a mindless titan just like them somehow</br>  <br>An explosion would kill Ymir. Just drop this fanwanky shit for once, Ymir isn't even strong enough for the CT to care.</br>  Is the 2nd movie out? I wanna see the new scenes  <br>This adds up to those spoilers with Kichiro Moto.</br>  <br>yeah, anime fucked it up for tension's sake</br>  Isayama forgot to draw Keith's beard.  <br/>  <br>Bert and Mikasa have a lot of things in common. I would argue personality and role wise, they're a lot more similar than Annie/Mikasa and Bert/Armin.</br>  <br>The Colossal's steam power isn't an explosion though. I'm talking about the thing he used to keep the soldiers away from him on the wall, not the explosion he used to take Eren out. <br>And it'd fit, because Ymir's titan body would be running hot as well, and have healing powers, and is specially suited for climbing up things.</br></br>  <br> while everyone looking tense Mikasa just stares calmly at Eren's butt </br>  <br>I think it will be either her or Armin. I think Armin is one of the most likely candidates to use the serum they got from Kenny.</br>  <br>BFF confirmed?</br>  <br>He can explode, just drop it. Only Reiner is able to survive this, it even wiped out Eren who is a 15 meter titan, not a 3 meter one.</br>  <br>That's impossible perspective wise.</br>  <br>So Eren is going to steal Reiner's armor technique?</br>  <br>Ymir's not a 3 meter titan, and I never said he couldn't explode. <br><br>Sounds like you're letting your Ymir hate get in the way of actually thinking things through. I blame the shippers who have turned hating Ymir into a meme in these threads.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both taciturns and tend to stare at things, but a fight between them wouldn't be interesting. Mikasa is good at slashing things and Bert can't be killed with just that. Unless he dies in human form, but that would be anticlimactic.</br>  <br>Ymir saved his life, if she wanted to kill him she would have done so long ago.</br>  <br>I don't hate Ymir though. It still doesn't mean she's strong enough to take down the colossal, just think about what you're saying. She was good at threatening him when he couldn't even transform in the forest, but on a real fight she can't beat that. Actually he wouldn't even have to use the exploding ability to defeat her in the first place.</br>  <br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Shingeki<wbr>-no-Kyojin/Chapter-071?id=235193</wbr></br>  <br>Can the CT even move around? Is he stable enough? The fact that Reiner had to go against MT instead of Bert kind of makes me suspect that the CT can't take another shifter one-on-one due to balancing issues. The CT's most dangerous attack is his steam but a shifter that can regenerate can withstand that, plus his steam attack would run out eventually as Hanji suggested, after it runs out a fast titan like Ymir could climb up his body and rip him out of the nape of his neck.</br>  <br>Wasn't it mentioned somewhere that CT can't even stand without support? He always looked more like a defensive type of titan to me and also rather slow. Everyone could just easily run away from him, if they wanted to.</br>  <br> Can the CT even move around? <br>Isayama drew him moving around so probably yes. He doesn't have to move around yo beat Ymir though.<br><br> The CT's most dangerous attack is his steam <br>No, that's the explosion. Are you seriously, unironically suggesting Ymir's titan is stronger than the colossal titan? See what this page  is saying again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he wouldn't even have to use the exploding ability to defeat her <br>Why not? Eren was a hair's breadth away from killing him in Trost, in his human form at that. I imagine Ymir in Titan form could deal with him just fine were it not for the explosion.</br></br>  <br> Wasn't it mentioned somewhere that CT can't even stand without support? <br>Nope, that was a theory. He appeared standing in a bunch of Isayama's drawings.<br><br> Everyone could just easily run away from him <br>Easily, even. He's slow as fuck, but if someone manages to go up to his nape he could always just do the explosion thing and bail out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't have to move around yo beat Ymir though. <br>If he can't move around he can only throw punches that could easily be dodged, especially by a smaller titan with quick movements. But if he can move around then it's a different story, however I think that he's slow due to his size and the shape of his body. <br><br><br> No, that's the explosion <br>It's a steam attack, the only way he can explode is if he falls and that would also mean that Bert has to leave his titan body. The explosion can also be dodged, it's only dangerous if the enemy can't see it coming, but with Bert's size who wouldn't?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the steam attack just Bert leaving his titan? That's what he did both times it happened.</br>  <br> Eren was a hair's breadth away from killing him in Trost, in his human form at that <br>That was just shitty writing from Isayama's side. The steam gave Hanji enough burns to make her pass out and she wasn't even as close as Eren was. For some miraculous reason, Eren didn't even get a scratch.</br></br>  MT, reiner, bert when?  <br>No, he can stay in it if he wants to, but it has a time limit until all his meat burns off from it.</br>  <br>Because he's a shifter?</br>  <br>He didn't know he was a shifter back then, shouldn't the burning still happen until he decided to heal it? Like how he hit his head when Keith meddled with the belt.</br>  MT<br>Grisha<br>RT<br>AT<br>FT<br>DT<br>CT<br>Rod Titan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the only way he can explode is if he falls and that would also mean that Bert has to leave his titan body <br>If that's the only case he can do it, then Ymir might have a chance. I think he exploded when he fell because he fell to save Reiner and thus exploded when he reached them, but I could be wrong.</br></br>  <br>You forgot Frieda.</br>    <br>We didn't see enough of her tbh.</br>    <br>Rod wasn't a shifter, he was a mindless colossal titan</br>  <br>BRA can control their healing consciously, but Eren (and Ymir) have only shown involuntary healing so far.</br>  <br> Jeanin20years.jpg </br>  <br>I think they can all control it, but Eren couldn't heal before he knew he was a shifter. His head trauma was proof of that. He should have got burned.</br>  <br>He didn't know he was a shifter when his arm and leg grew back. So far he used pretty much all of his powers without knowing how to use them prior, why should healing be different?</br>  <br>same way he beat him last time.  "we fucked your waifu bert. WE FUCKED YOUR WAIFU </br>  <br> He didn't know he was a shifter when his arm and leg grew back <br>He did though, he even transformed before he regenerated his limbs. I think he would have known if he saw steam coming out of his wounds, the cadets got hurt very often because of their training.</br></br>  <br>He also didn't know how to shift yet unconsciously he knew that he had to injure himself.</br>    Next BSM will have a SnK cover. Please be drawn by Isayama  <br>You think that Bert would even listen to Armin now? If Bert gets a hold of Armin, he's done for.</br>  <br>What if it is Chuugakkou to go with the  anime announcement ?</br>  <br>That is better than nothing.. Thanks!<br><br><br>Hey, this one actually worked! Thanks! .. Though I've already read it off the other thread now, I'll save that site for next month.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren has more of a reason to want to kill Bert than Bert has to kill Armin. If Bert tries anything funny, he'd die by Eren's hands.</br>  <br>Eren doesn't want to kill BR anymore. He said it himself.</br>  <br>nah, Armin has caught the bloodlust now. No one is safe.</br>  <br>What do you think he would do if they killed Armin? Stand still?</br>  <br>Definitely not, but it's not like Armin will die anyway.</br>  <br>It could be a live action cover. The movie is coming out next month.</br>  <br>What makes you think that? I think he will be the only one to die out of the main trio.</br>  <br>Just a hunch.</br>  <br> Erwin uses hair products and is very picky about it, only uses Gorilla Snot. <br> All recruits thought Eren ad Armin were fags for each other. <br> There is no technology to print the logos of the militia, so they have a group of chinks embroidering on clandestine basements.. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm more wondering if it was the first King that made him go apeshit in the forest, seeing that smile of Eren in the neck.</br>  There better be some doujins of Keith raping Eren soon.  <br>We don't even have MTBR doujins yet.</br>  <br>Keith raping Grisha in front of Carla. And   Carla raping Keith then  </br>  <br>If Armin dies then who will be Eren and Mikasa's servant boy?</br>  <br>Yeah, it could be a live action cover. That reminds me the first part of the live action movie is premiering this Tuesday in L.A.</br>  <br>Suffering.</br>  In the end, did we see Annie smile in the second recap movie?  <br>I'm surprised Bert drawfags haven't delivered on this yet. They draw for everything else.</br>  Is Armin canonically a pervert?  <br>There are some pics.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>he enjoyed crossdressing as Historia tho</br>  <br>In fanart, maybe.</br>  <br>I hope they catch up when they return in the manga, we don't know enough about MT yet.</br>  <br>I don't see why their would be. MT is most attractive Shingeki and Berp looks like he has down syndrome.</br>  <br>Eren and Historia got kidnapped by Rod Reiss, the true King. Meanwhile, the survey corps made a plan to wash their name and succeeded, turning the power around and making the current ruler fall from his throne. Rod Reiss reveal that the royal family are the heir of the first king, who put everyone between walls made from titans a long time ago. He wants Historia to get the power to control the titans. This power is currently held by Eren, who got it from his father by eating him. His father stole it from one of the members of the Royal family (the black haired chick). Historia becomes half-crazy and Eren get an inferiority conplex, but in the end, Historia refuses to eat Eren and Rod decide to transform into a titan himself. To protect everyone, Eren had to eat a chemical that gave him the armor power. Rod-Titan attacked the wall but got defeated by the survey corps, and finished by Historia, who as the one true heir became Queen. Two months then pass and Eren became good enough to create structure from his armor, leading to the invention of a "guillotine" who kills titans with no man power. He then learned from Keith (the instructor) that his father was from outside the wall, just like the other titans. He now aims to fill up the hole in wall Maria and get to his father's basement.</br>  <br>Don't start. All shingeki's are beautiful in their own way.</br>  <br>Also they figured out the Titans are people who have been transformed, and can be changed back under certain conditions<br>so if you didn't figure that out in the first few chapters then I guess that might be a surprise</br></br>  <br>Wasn't this before the kidnapping ?<br>I mean just after they went through Connie's hometown</br></br>  Was that guy who emerged from Gorilla Warfare supposed to be someone we already know? He was shown like it was some big reveal.  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>He looks very similar to Grisha.<br>His titan form has pointy ears, just like titan forms of Eren and Grisha.<br>Now when we know that Grisha is outsider as well it makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br> Since when were you under the impression that I was dead? <br>Isayama's writing is not THAT bad.</br></br>  <br>Nothing says that he's Grisha, but his relative? That's entirely possible.<br>Grisha's titan form looked differently as well.</br></br>  <br><br> disgusting EM <br>Someone remind me why Spoof is considered to be any good.</br></br></br>  <br> Erwin uses hair products <br>Of course.</br></br>  <br>Some of the other portrayals of the characters are pretty good, but the EMshit is annoying. Mikasa doesn't even act like that toward Eren. I know it's supposed to be a parody of the characters, but if you're going to change a characters personality at least do it for comedic reasons, not for shipperfag delusions.</br>  <br> Mikasa doesn't even act like that toward Eren <br><br>If only she did, at least she wouldn't that much of a pathetic beta.</br></br></br>  <br>That would make her much more annoying though. I rather her get actual character development than cling to Eren any more than she does now.</br>  <br>Maybe she'll get some development from her Asian heritage since she didn't get all that much from the Ackerman subplot.</br>  <br>My bet is that after the Ackerman plot, the Asian bloodline will be explained in 5 pages as "superior Asian blood makes for great warrior spirit"</br>  <br>That's what I'm hoping too. Levi had a closer connection to the Ackerman plot since Kenny was his uncle, but Mikasa's sure to get the spotlight once the Asian clan is brought back into the story.</br>  <br>I don't think we're fully done with the Ackerman subplot. Once the circumstances of Levi's Ackerwakening are revealed it might finally connect to Mikasa.</br>  <br>It's the only thing that panders to BRfags.</br>  <br>How would it connect to Mikasa?</br>  <br>Along with the game, smartpass and Chuugakkou?</br>  <br>We'll probably be seeing the mark that Mikasa's mother gave her popping up again to identify someone we didn't expect as Asian and with all the super powers that Asians undoubtedly have.<br><br>Meanwhile, the basement is filled with test tubes of Eren clones because he's an experiment his father created to safely take advantage of the memories of the First King. Grisha himself couldn't, after all.</br></br></br>  <br>You might be right, anon. I honestly forgot about the awakening aspect of the Ackerman powers in wake of all the Reiss, first king, and Grisha info. It's too bad Isayama didn't show Kenny's awakening moment in his backstory, but Levi's awakening moment might be shown later on if and when he talks to Mikasa about Ackerbusiness. Or was Levi's awakening moment when he beat that thug in the fight and Kenny left? I've seen speculation that Levi's awakening moment was when he went on a killing spree against the titans in ACWNR after Farlan and Isabel's death, but his awakening moment likely wouldn't be in a spinoff and he was already strong enough to be the top dog in the underground and catch Erwin's attention before that.</br>  <br>4koma too.<br><br> It was kind of cute how Armin pointing out Reiner’s relationship with Bertholdt made him flustered. Because of the increased BL levels, are Armin and Jean being aimed for too? Seems dangerous… </br></br></br>  <br>Don't those cater more to BA than BR?</br>  <br>The side material tends to cater to both.</br>  <br> I've seen speculation that Levi's awakening moment was when he went on a killing spree against the titans in ACWNR after Farlan and Isabel's death, <br>Is kinda tricky here. Manga and OVA showed him in control of his mind, while only the VN described the moment like a mass murder and he didn't have recollection of how he did it.</br></br>  <br>It mostly caters to BA, but occasionally also a little BR</br>  <br>It's both, but the homo implications are usually from Reiner's side.</br>  <br>mangacap</br>  <br>I go with the VN version when it comes to ACWNR since that is the original (and arguably the best version) of it. Can ACWNR even be considered canon anymore since in this chapter Keith shut Erwin down on the long range formation, but on the expedition in ACWNR they use Erwin's long range formation and he's still a squad leader then?</br>  <br>Not really. BRfags just take it out of context. Most things seriously pander to BA and sometimes joke about Reiner.</br>  <br>Something along the lines of:<br>1. Someone with more info appears/there's something about the Ackermans in the basement.<br>2. Mikasa has a flashback revealing what Levi told her about his powers during their conversation in chapter 63 after the chapter cuts to Eren and Historia. <br>3.This connects to #1, which then leads to <br>4. another reveal or plot twist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope is not a mistranslation but Isayama subtly debunking the spin-off so nobody feel hurt.</br>   <br> Or was Levi's awakening moment when he beat that thug in the fight and Kenny left? <br>This is probably what did it. How else could a small boy kill an adult thug? <br><br>I think we're done with the Ackerman thing the moment Kenny died. The LM connection revealed without much fanfare, so I think the focus will continue on Mikasa's Asian side.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I meant, but it's still pandering. Spoof has pretty much everything pandering to BR, in Chuugakkou the whole school told Reiner to cut the shit and admit he's gay, chibi specials have YH and Armin thinking they're gay. Smartpass not so much, but the shippy stuff in smartpass is more realistic since they're not parodies. The game just shows them as good bros and goes crazy with the powerups and line picks, but nothing really shippy.</br>  <br>What other info could we get though? We already know the history of the Ackerman line.</br>  <br>So, anons nailed when they said the Ackerman thing would be dealt with indifference<br> I'm Ackerman <br> Me too <br> Need to scrub the bathroom <br> Need to see Eren </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the increased BL levels </br>  <br>We don't know much about their powers.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Even I expected more.</br>  <br> Armin and Jean <br> not EAr <br>This is completely OOC.</br></br></br>   july 11 <br> chapter still not out </br>    So I've been thinking. What if Grisha, MT, and Ymir are all siblings? Possibly children of the first king. I say this because all of their titan forms have extremely long arms and pointy ears. Just like the first king. It's kind of hard to tell if Grisha's titan form has long arms because of angles, but they look somewhat elongated. We also know that Grisha is totally from outside the walls. Maybe, Grisha and Ymir (who knows about MT) were turned into mindless titans and were forced to wander outside the walls for years and years. Then, Grisha ate someone and changed back and was found. This would explain how he has no idea what 3DMG or the SL are. Then, some time later, Ymir found BRM and ate Marcel. At this point, she regained her mind and slipped into the walls. Possibly when Bert and Reiner destroyed them.  Carla a cute femEren  <br>It's saying that Reiner could go after Armin and Jean, not that JA is possible.</br>  <br>It means that Reiner would assault them. In the ass. Like he does to Bert.</br>  <br>What the fuck does manlet have to do with Marco?</br>  <br>That would be shit writing in my opinion. Half the cast is already related somehow to each other by coincidence, we don't need more of that. It's really possible though.</br>  <br><br>This is even worse because he only has the hots for Kurista. Anyways nobody except /a/'s Jean wants to buttfuck the Janbo.</br></br>  <br> How else could a small boy kill a adult thug? <br>Gee, we've never seen something like this in the series, have we? I don't think he killed him though. <br>Plus the awakening could have happened before the fight.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently the anime team disagrees.</br>  <br>JUST</br>  <br>Everyone knows the anime team is shit. Even Isayama despises them.</br>  <br>Homo jokes about Reiner are nothing new. Even Isayama does it.</br>  <br>He only hates them because he knows they are making a superior product out of his material.</br>  <br>Isayama is the one that gives them the filler ideas, the only ones that hate the anime are Arminfags because some EAr scenes were removed and replaced with EM.</br>  <br>The blue box is Scouting Legion. Marco's death made Jean join SL.</br>  <br>Oh, thanks for clarifying.</br>  <br>Kimd of how Isayama monitored the ending of the animu? <br>The EM scenes are exactly why Isayama hates them and it's why he spends time excessively pandering to EArfags.</br></br>  <br>He didn't fully agree with the ending, Araki convinced him that it'll be "cooler" but it was a total fuckup</br>  <br>I'm starting to consider it more and more likely. Both Grisha and Ymir also have eyes unlike any of the other titans. You can't really tell on MT because of all dat fur, but they look like they might be similar to theirs.</br>  <br>I don't think they're related by birth, but they're probably all from the same time period. I think that Ymir was a princess/queen that was forced into her position. MT came along and turned her civilization into titans, which is where she knows him from. Grisha was a research scientist working for whomever MT is working for. MT is an Ackerman, and his giant monkey form is an example of what happens when an Ackerman becomes a titan.</br>  <br>Not eve Araki handled that, Araki said in an interview that the ending scene was outsourced.</br>  <br>The anime team even was embarrassed about the last two episodes.</br>  <br>Or maybe she'll finally learn how to make children.</br>    <br>Why are they sexualizing fifth graders?</br>  <br>Junge junge junge bist du blöd....</br>  <br>They don't need to sexualize them they're already sexy.</br>  For the the weirdest thing about illya in OP is how she has abs and a foirm stomach with that age  <br>Shut up Jared.</br>  Doffy is fucking dead Edition<br>The strings inside his body dissolved with the birdcage and law knows that, that's why he who is exhausted let's the marine's take doffy with him, because doffy won't even live long enough to reach impel down. But we all know that either Crocodile, Moria or Kaidou will attack the marine ship and see doffy dying. <br>Also Sanji a best  Secret Dellinger a whore thread </br></br>  <br>Terrible way to start a thread. Doffy isn't going to die, haven't all the chaarcters in the past that survived taught you anything? <br><br> inb4 Whitebeard &amp; Ace </br></br></br>  How does one join CP0?  <br>Most other villains have only been left beaten up, not with their organs ripped apart</br>  <br>Pell took a fucking nuke in his head</br>  <br>Yeah it's not like Spandams entire spine was destroyed or Lucci was beaten to oblivion or an entire tower mast of Thriller Bark fell on Moria or Akainu and Blackbeard surviving Whitebeards quake punches</br>  <br>You have to join CP9 first and work your way up eg CP9 -&gt; CP8 -&gt; CP7 -&gt; ... -&gt;CP0<br><br><br><br>And Ace died from a magmafisting fucking up his ORGANS. And what did law fuck up again? Yes, exactly the organs.</br></br></br></br></br>  The austistic bullshit from yesterday again?  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>Is lucci a good boy?</br>  <br>I will be dissapointed in Oda if Doffy lives.<br>A master story teller like him has to know its time for a villain to actually die. <br><br>One Piece needs this villain death. The other OP villain's kinda had decent reasons for not dying, but there is 0 good reason for Doflamingo to survive this arc. It will be terrible if he ends up like Croc. I like that outcome for him but not for Doffy. If Doffy lives it will weaken my opinion of this series, <br><br>  He is absolutely going to live because that is just how OP goes, but I still have a sliver of hope.   Problem is they can't have Luffy kill any main villains because its totally against his character.<br><br>Let someone who can come off as semi naughty kill that bastard. Law can't let him live after their past. Or Cavendish finishes him, because killing Doffy will make him super famous again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's going to live so Kaidou can fuck him up.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't seem like Kaidou is a guy who let's a failure live. Isn't that why doffy's afraid of him?</br>  <br><br>Pretty much.</br></br>  <br> A master story teller like him has to know its time for a villain to actually die. <br>Icameheretolaughatyou.jpg</br></br>  <br>See I disagree and am fine with villains not dying because I still feel that sense of danger, it doesn't deprive me of my joy from the story and it also means character arcs can continue and develop.</br>  <br> I still feel that sense of danger <br>so how afraid are you of arlong  the third strongest rev  my boi?</br></br>  <br>Arlong didn't die but he's going to be in jail forever. Doflamingo will be the same.</br>  <br>I'm with you for the most part.<br><br>But not every last villain. And the other villains had some redeemable qualities. <br><br>Doflamingo shouldn't get any more development. I like him as an antagonist. But the best thing that could happen in his plot is that he dies.<br><br>They made him too much of a threat to be some defeated in the shadows type. <br><br>The only version of Doflamingo living that I could feel alright with, is that he is heavily crippled and can't fight anyone at all anymore. Ahd he is like desperate to live being protected from the Tenryuubito, and Kaido by his endlessly loyal crew</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Arlong isn't the new Shichibukai </br>  <br>I want Doflamingo to return, because he'll come back with a new mindset just like Crocodile and Moria. He'll be a tsundere ally for Luffy in the future hopefully.</br>  <br> He'll be a tsundere ally for Luffy in the future hopefully. <br>That wouldn't make 0 sense. Crocodile was a bad guy and turned good, but Doffy was like 10 times worse. He was everything that Luffy could possibly hate. Those two working together would be the dumbest thing possible.</br></br>  <br> Law can't let him live after their past <br>His objective was the same as Corazon's, basically stopping him from doing bad stuff. He lost his shichibukai seat, his throne, his influence on the WG and his ideals. This objective has been accomplished. There was never any need for Law to kill him.<br> b-b-b-but he talked about pulling the trigger <br>Metaphors. Moreover it's not like you can defeat someone like Doffy if you don't have an intention to kill. Also Law did say he wasn't doing this for revenge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy really loved his crew though, he's an asshole but he's not 100% evil</br>  <br>Crocodile's not good though?</br>  <br>Speedreader confirmed.<br><br>Doffy absolutely despises the celestial dragons and you know Luffy will fight them and the World Government one day.</br></br></br>  <br> Also Law did say he wasn't doing this for revenge. <br> I'LL FINISH WHAT CORAZON COULDN'T!!! <br> he wasn't oing it for revenge <br>M8 of course he wanted to stop doffy, because doffy's evil, but you can't act like there was no personal grudge involved.<br><br><br>As long as they were useful that is. He didn't say anything about those that lost besides that they at least tried. He didn't feel bad or wanted to take revenge for them.<br><br><br>He is better than alabasta crocodile; you know like not wanting to fuck a whole country anymore and shit.<br><br><br>You are the only speedreader here, you expect everyone to work with luffy, but who says that luffy would accept him and who says that doffy who is getting almost killed by the "traitor" law and luffy would go like a dog to them to help 'em? Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is this Fujitora who is about to go after Law or Luffy or is this Fujitora saying "I don't care Sakazuki, I made my point about the Shichibukai so suck it"?<br><br>Or both?</br></br>  <br> but who says that luffy would accept him and who says that doffy who is getting almost killed by the "traitor" law and luffy would go like a dog to them to help 'em? Are you retarded? <br><br>This proves right here that you're the speedreader, Luffy doesn't hold huge grudges against anyone except Akainu and perhaps Blackbeard.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Arlong got 4kids Bellemere'd <br><br>poetic justice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how Doffy was any worse than Crocodile. They were both pretty bad. Well sure Crocodile never did slavery or killed half his blood family (at least not that we know of) but he almost made an entire country die of thirst for his own convenience and was a cunt to his crew, even those who were loyal to him, when they failed. He didn't trust anyone, he had a level of cynicism when it comes to people Doffy didn't have (and Doffy was the guy who said "people are cruel, deep down, they all want to see blood"). Doffy didn't care how many times you failed in your mission as long as you remained loyal to him. Better, he'll try to get you out of the pinch you put yourself in. No matter how disavantageous it is for himself.<br> inb4 Bellamy <br>Bellamy isn't an executive.</br></br></br>  <br>he will stay on dressrosa and help them rebuild i guess</br>  <br>Doflamingo doesn't despise the Celestial Dragons, he's despised by them. He considers himself one of them, and hates his father for getting him kicked out of heaven.</br>  <br>We can't tell due to its vagueness. We'll have to see, but I personally think it'lll end with neither; the SHs will escape and Fujitora will end up being allowed back in. Perhaps he'll do something greater.</br>  <br>yeah and doffy held a 15 year long grudge against law and even asked him to work for him again or die right before the fight, you spead reader. There is no way that doffy would be like <br>"lol xD raw remember when you wanted to kill me, let's forget that and attack the tenryuubito, ok? "<br><br><br>just read the alabasta arc and then the dressrosa arc. Doflamingo did like twice as many "bad" things as crocboy did alone in his arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He held a grudge against Crocodile when they met again at Impel Down. He doesn't hold grudges easily, and never for his own accord, but when a villain is bad enough he'll absolutely stay angry at them. Hell, even when he met Bellamy he was ready to fight.</br>  <br>Not the same guy, but he definitely was still angry at Crocodile for destroying Vivi's country until Ivankov convinced Luffy to let Croc out. Isn't that a grudge?<br><br><br>I personally feel that Doffy should die for the main reason that he fucked with way too many influential people turning them into toys and getting away with it. He's also involved in the underworld, so assassination when someone isn't useful anymore should be the norm. So I would be a little bit disappointed if he lived, even more so if he ended up joining Luffy in the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he still has unresolved connections to the tenryuubito. He was meant to have some secret about them that wasn't revealed.</br>  <br> I personally feel that Doffy should die for the main reason that he fucked with way too many influential people turning them into toys and getting away with it <br><br>Oh yeah, forgot to mention that it seems like part of the anger will be redirected to Law and Luffy for screwing up the business, so that might be his "saving grace". If he doesn't die from the organ damage.</br></br></br>  <br> He was meant to have some secret about them that wasn't revealed. <br>yes and doffy dies now, that secret could be revealed at another point and luffy/law could make the connection between doffy's speech and the secret they found out about. It's not that hard.</br></br>  <br>There is absolutely no way he's joining Luffy, and honestly his chances of ever being big again are low as he's been crushed totally, but there's not much difference between him dying and spending his life in Impel Down.</br>  <br>Yeah but if Doffy does it it's just like more of the same.<br><br>And Doffy's only goal is destroying everything and he did way more fucking heinous stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> Better, he'll try to get you out of the pinch you put yourself in. No matter how disavantageous it is for himself. <br><br>Dofflamingo straight-up demanded from one crewmember to kill herself when it was advantageous to him. He shat on Bellamy just to make Luffy madder (yeah, how did that worked for you, Doffy?). He methodically exploided Baby 5's terminally low sense of self-worth for decades. Every time Doffy could actually get something from throwing one of his subordinates under the bus, he did so. The chief executives even admitted the fact, that everybody is fodder to Doffy, but though that they are special themselves, a delusion for which Law laughed at Trebol.</br></br></br>  <br> but there's not much difference between him dying and spending his life in Impel Down. <br>I think that's a huge difference. His death especially would be the first person luffy killed (although it would actually be law's kill).<br><br><br>yeah doffy's "I'll destroy the world that the tenryuubito made" will never equal luffy's goals of being free even if both have the tenryuubito as "enemys", because doffy's goal is just way more malicious that luffy's could ever get.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He could have killed Jora to sink the Sunny but didn't</br>  <br>He did try to though. Law just stopped the string.</br>  <br>that doesn't "out do" anything the guy said here </br>  <br> 恨み=urami, here translated as sour grapes <br> resentment, grudge, umbrage <br>You free to speculate he didn't mean what he said but don't act like he didn't say it.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Luffy will ever kill anyone in the series. Maybe, just maybe, he will go mad with rage over Ace when he fights Akainu and kills him in some sort of black out state.<br><br>Luffy thinks getting beat up is punishment enough for anything. <br><br>The question is will Zoro ever kill anyone. Nami already has.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda can't even write men hurting women, so there's no way he'll have the Strawhats outright murder anybody.</br>  <br> You free to speculate he didn't mean what he said but don't act like he didn't say it. <br>What are you even on about, your page proves that the personal grudge is related, but not the only reason why law wanted to fuck doffy.<br><br><br> Nami already has. <br>who did she kill?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also he could turn it so, that Law is considered to be the killer and not luffy.</br>  <br>I disagree about the difference. This is the New World. Even though you don't need to set a predecent where every villain needs to die, but if only to illustrate how dangerous this part of the sea is, someone as powerful and well connected as Doflamingo should be brought down in a more significant way than just "being brought down to justice", especially if you don't plan on using him ever again in a major role.<br><br>I mean, it's kind of odd when you talk about the New World like it's a slaughterhouse where Blackbeard is killing a fleet of pirates and here you have a guy who basically represents that and he jsut gets arrested and we barely hear from him in the rest of the series. I kind of want the chaos that would come with his death. I just want a major death dammit.<br><br><br>Or they could put him in an asylum to be consistent with the Joker-theme and have Law or Luffy visit him some day in need of info. But I don't think that is what OP is about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro killed the original Mr 7. <br>Luffy killed Bellamy.<br><br>Nami killed the Sickle-Sickle fruit guy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy killed Bellamy. <br>We don't know that.<br><br> Nami killed the Sickle-Sickle fruit guy. <br>That's anime and not even canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nami killed the Sickle-Sickle fruit guy. <br> fillershit <br>anon pls, but I give you Zoro, he probably really killed already</br></br></br>  <br> Bellamy as an argument <br>Opinion discarded. The guy was never part of the family, moreover his nature that prompted him to abandon a good situation to become a pirate, Bellamy's idealism (yes, idealism, as incredible as that sounds), reminded Doflamingo of his father. Of course he'd constantly shit on Bellamy.</br></br>  <br><br>Some anon brought it up, I knew it was non-canon.<br>Zoro was confirmed to actually kill Mr 7 though after he said he'd only accept his conditions if he made him their boss.</br></br></br>  So she's meeting Garp &amp; Sengoku.<br>What will come of that?</br>  <br> Bellamy's idealism (yes, idealism, as incredible as that sounds), reminded Doflamingo of his father. <br>0/10 headcanon</br></br>  <br>I forgot to mention the original text isn't as subtle as Mangastream makes it out to be. Law plainly says "it's not a grudge" (urami ja ne) not "it's far from merely being a grudge".</br>  <br>It's probably safe to assume that he was directly responsible for the deaths of fodder soldiers in Impel Down and especially Marineford.</br>  <br>Probably a celebration old people party now that Tsuru's prey has finally been captured.</br>  <br> Law plainly says "it's not a grudge" (urami ja ne) not "it's far from merely being a grudge". <br>yeah and later on he can't speaking about corazon. He obviously hates doffy for corazon's death to besides taking over corazon's way of thinking.</br></br>  <br> A master story teller like him has to know its time for a villain to actually die.  <br>Why? Death =/= more interesting story. A master storyteller doesn't have to follow any sort of 'made-up' rule like that to make their story successful. Especially if there's no reason for the character to die, and Oda can potentially use him later in the story. And you know he calls back on old characters a lot and doesnt like to waste them. There are some authors that kill off characters like flies so why can't there be the opposite? He said so himself. He thinks having your dream crushed after spending so many years working for it is worse than death itself. That's just the type of story you're reading. There are other ways to feel a sense of danger than having deaths. <br><br>And personally, I like the way he uses death very sparingly. It just makes the moment that much more impactful when someone actually dies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure about that? Seems to me that she's going to see the Doflamingo crew's arrest, since she's been chasing them for a long time.</br>  <br>What else would you call his admiration for pirates and Doflamingo ?<br>And it is a fact that both Bellamy and Homing abandoned a good situation to live the life they wanted.<br>Just look at Doflamingo's face in 4th panel of pic related and tell me this isn't the face of absolute, utter contempt.</br></br></br>  <br> yeah and later on he can't speaking about corazon <br>literally what.<br> he obviously hates doffy for corazon's death to besides taking over corazon's way of thinking <br>We were discussing whether he was doing this for revenge or not, not whether he hated Doffy or not. Of course he does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In b4 she washes away Doffy's evil.</br>  <br>I think you are reading a bit too much in this. The following may be true<br> And it is a fact that both Bellamy and Homing abandoned a good situation to live the life they wanted. <br>But there is no direct connection that doffy concludes between bellamy and his father. <br><br><br> We were discussing whether he was doing this for revenge or not <br>You will probably call me a liar, but I don't care. I remember Law literally saying "for Corazon" when attacking Doffy. I just don't remember which chapter it was. And if you even admit that he hates doffy, how can you even think that no personal grudge is involved in this? Law even told luffy about Corazon dying and all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doffy's evil washed away <br> Immediately starts regretting killing his father and brother <br> Actually cares about the horrible things he's done <br> Remains arrested and left to rot in jail <br><br>Truly a fate worse than death.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course it's interpretation, since it was never explicit. But it makes sense and I believe it to be true. You're free not to. But It's not like there is any other explanation for Doflamingo constantly shitting on Bellamy. Unless of course, you think Doflamingo is a crazy, irrational human being and does it for the evulz, lol.<br> how can you even think that no personal grudge is involved in this? Law even told luffy about Corazon dying and all <br>There is a difference between having a grudge and acting on it. That was the point I was trying to make. Sorry if it was confusing.</br></br></br>   the transmission of fujitora was broadcast over 3 islands <br> world government just told the cp to clean up the mess <br>So those 3 islands and dressrosa are about to get mass murdered by all 0-8 CP's right?</br></br>  <br> But It's not like there is any other explanation for Doflamingo constantly shitting on Bellamy. <br>Doflamingo literally says that Bellamy's goal are not equal to his own goals. That's reason enough for him shitting on bellamy.<br><br><br>no, because everyone already got the news from those three islands. There is nothing the WG can do now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo shits on Bellamy because he's a sycophantic fuckup that isn't worthy of his respect. There is very little to connect him to Homming.</br>  <br> Seriously threatened people just because they laughed at Pica's voice.  <br> For a guy that's so entitled, he just laughs and waves off Baby5 when she threatens to kill him. Not to mention he kills off anyone that tries to take advantage of her. <br> Seized his attacks on the Strawhats/Law a couple of times to ensure the safety of his family (ex. Jora, Baby5/Buffalo). If he really didn't care about them he wouldn't have given a shit. He basically sacrificed his potential success for them. For example, he probably could've gotten Caesar back at that Green Bit bridge if Law wasn't holding Jora hostage.  <br> Trebol and Diamante fucked up big time. Every toy turned back into humans and someone else got hold of the Mera no mi. These are pretty huge fucking deals but Doffy doesnt reprimand them even A LITTLE bit. He just says 'yeah mistakes happen' and shit like that.  <br> he looked genuinely upset when he found out Vergo died.  <br>Just the fact that he puts the success of his plans on the line for his family and forgives them so easily when his shit gets so utterly fucked up, shows that he cares about them at least a little bit. Honestly his soft spot for his family might have been his downfall and the one trait that stripped him of the title of Ultimate Villan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>100 % agreed</br>  <br> he looked genuinely upset when he found out Vergo died. <br>This is probably the only good thing you wrote. Everything else was BEFORE they became useless. Look at the post you quoted. He doesn't care about them after they get completly defeated.</br></br>  <br><br> world government just told the cp to clean up the mess <br><br>Think that was a reference to the Doflamingo quits the Shichibukai-situation.</br></br></br></br>  Doffy's kill count is that of one 5 year old kid  <br>I don't think that most 5 year olds killed their own brothers</br>  <br>nah bruh fujitora found him</br>  <br> He doesn't care about them after they get completly defeated. <br>How do you even know that? He hasn't seen anyone get defeated except maybe Trebol but he was dealing with Law and Luffy at the time. Maybe some of the rage he felt when fighting Luffy included his rage for his broken kingdom and his family? Does he specifically say 'I don't care about these shits anymore'? There's only one instance where it shows his reaction to a family's death, and it was a negative one, not an indifferent one. <br><br>Also, if someone fucked up as bad as Trebol and Diamante, most 'heartless' villains would've probably deemed them useless. The fact that he didn't and forgave them like it was nothing shows that he doesn't really care about how successful they are in their jobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in a shirt with a bear on it <br> picture of Warlord Kuma <br>I still find it funny</br></br></br>  <br>You know I like how Oda showed random people suffering.<br><br>The main point of Doflamingo's characters is that he really, really fucking hates humans, and the more innocent the person is, the more likely is to experience his wrath.<br><br>He's pretty much a psychopathic misanthrope.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DEEPEST<br><br>LORE</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but he didn't even comment Trebol blowing himself up and he was going to kill them all with the bird cage</br>  <br>I think he said he wants to quit and this is Akainu firing him.</br>  <br>You just described the average 4chan user, except they're too autistic to be menacing</br>  <br>I think you completly misunderstood Doflamingo's character. H eeven literally said, that he doesn't care about his people losing/being defeated. Suggesting he doesn't care about them afterwards.</br>  <br>wasn't he part of the draft in the first place to replace all the admirals who bailed after the whitebeard war?</br>  Reminder that post TS all we've seen her do is read newspapers.  <br>And eat pizza.</br>  <br> all the admirals who bailed <br>One quit, one was promoted.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't care about his people losing/being defeated. Suggesting he doesn't care about them afterwards. <br>I think YOU misunderstood that line there. When he said he doesn't care about his people losing/being defeated, Meaning he won't get angry at them if they fail. He only cares (or gets angry) at his people if they betray him.</br></br>  <br><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN</br></br>  IMA SUGU NI MOTTO HANDS UP  <br>yes and he showed to be indifferent about those that lost an get left behind. Are we ven reading the same manga? Did you see him mention anyone of those that lost on dressrosa? Are you suggesting he didn't knew when he fought gear 4 luffy that he is the only one left?</br>  <br><br>I know that he held a grudge against Crocodile, but it still wasn't a lasting grudge.</br></br>  How are Law/Luffy gonna get to Zou?  <br>Why is the only reason you're implying that he doesn't care about his family is because he doesn't 'comment' about their defeats while he's in the middle of a motherfucking fight?<br><br>When Luffy and Law first reached him, his executives were all still up. Then he's been dealing with them ever since. What do you expect him to do? All of a sudden think 'oh shit they're all defeated !' right at the moment they get defeated and comment about it in the middle of a fight? The country is fucking huge. Zoro and them didn't know how Luffy/Doffy's fight was going until the birdcage finally disappeared so how do you expect Luffy/Doffy to know how the others are doing too? I don't get how this point is your ultimatum 'evidence' that Doffy doesn't give a shit about his crew. <br><br>Unless you're taking Law's words as fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey Riku can we get a boat?<br>'Kay</br></br>  <br>Allies</br>  <br>Well Doffy was in the cage too when he was shrinking it. He was probably gonna end himself too if that's the case.</br>  <br>Actually it was. On his own luffy wouldn't have helped croc, but because invankov suggested it and he had to save ace which was practically forcing him, he forgave croc. It's not like he would sail around and suddenly arlong would shout from his cell, pls help me, I'm sorry and luffy would do it. That's not how it works.<br><br><br> Doffy to know how the others are doing too? <br>I bet he knew that his birdcage was slowing down. I bet he knew when he was punched into the middle of the city that neither trebol, diamante nor pica is fighting anywhere as that was the last fighting ground. I bet he knew when violet confronted him that he is all alone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy couldn't get anywhere in the New World without Nami. Of course, he has a lot of friends now that realistically could give him a lift</br>  <br>"Hey Barto, can we get on your boat?<br>"Hai Sempai!"</br></br>  <br>His response would be less comprehensible than that. Hopefully someone else does the steering</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127918980 <br>you should stay on reddit</br>  <br> I bet he knew when violet confronted him that he is all alone. <br>And? He was pretty raging at that point. Like I said, how do you know he wasn't mad at Luffy and co. for destroying his plans AND his family? He doesn't really talk about where his emotions are stemming from at that moment. He even commented to Viola that he 'doesn't care' (meaning he's NOT ANGRY) if his members got defeated.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127918980 <br> reddit <br><br>no, get out</br></br></br>  Soon.  <br> Like I said, how do you know he wasn't mad at Luffy and co. for destroying his plans AND his family? <br>because he outright told luffy and law beforehand what's making him mad. And him not saying anything about them directly proves that there are no reason for him to get madder/mention it.</br></br>  <br> He even commented to Viola that he 'doesn't care' (meaning he's NOT ANGRY) if his members got defeated. <br>Fuck I should clarify this because you didn't really understand what he was getting at there. <br> he 'doesn't care' if his members fail, meaning he's NOT ANGRY AT THEM for getting defeated. </br></br></br>  <br>He can just stop it before it kills him.</br>  <br>So far this is just about all we have to go on.<br>I can't gleam anything from this.</br></br>  <br>"Hey Barto, can we get on you boat"<br>"SEMPARAGERRUGUGHGHARYU" [TL Note: he is saying Sempai, it would be my honor"</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127918980 <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>THE KONG IS DONG</br>  <br>It's just a Shinto-style building on Wano</br>  <br>I don't know about King Kong but I would really like to see someone with a Gorilla Zoan.</br>  Any idea why the new pirate alliance (Kidd, Apoo, Basil) are targeting Shanks?<br><br>I always liked the theory that Shanks was "guarding" Raftel and therefore One Piece/Pirate King title until Roger's will returned.<br><br>Chinajo seems to hint that something is "holding back" the Pirate King.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Law and Luffy beforehand <br>If you're talking about the very beginning of the fight when Law and Luffy first get there, then like I mentioned, his execs were still up and fighting then. The only time he would've known he was alone was when, like you said, Viola confronted him and the whole country was basically chanting Lucy's name.</br></br>  Who will be new sichibukai now that there's a job opening? I hope it's Enel.  <br> building <br>...Oh.</br></br>  <br>I think the system may actually legit collapse.<br><br>Doffy is gone and so is Law.<br>Two shichibukai losses in quick succession isn't an easy thing to recover from.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah and he refrained from being pissed off about anyone for fucking up his crew.<br><br><br>actually there are three spots: <br>The seventh who we don't know yet<br>Doffy's<br>Law's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Enel <br> Lowering himself to becoming a pirate <br><br>Who even knows if there will be a Seven Warlords after this</br></br></br></br>  <br> Any idea why the new pirate alliance (Kidd, Apoo, Basil) are targeting Shanks? <br>Because there can only be one Yonkou with red hair, missing their left arm and have a scar over their left eye.</br></br>  <br> Enel <br> ever working for someone else, even if it's just officially </br></br>  <br>The Shikibukai system will get outed and replace by only one man: awakened Foxy.</br>  <br> replace by only one man: Buggy, our lord and savior <br><br>Fixed that for you</br></br></br>  <br> Any idea why the new pirate alliance (Kidd, Apoo, Basil) are targeting Shanks? <br>Why not? As far as they know all Yonkous are equal,save for Kaido who is literally named the strongest creature in the world.</br></br>   Doflamingo literally says that Bellamy's goal are not equal to his own goals <br>Oh yeah, because he shits in the same fashion on Baby5, Señor Pink, hell, on his entire family, who doesn't have the same goal. I forgot about that for some reason. My apologies.<br><br><br> he a munster reeeeeeeee <br>Just because he's a piece of shit doesn't mean he's irrational. What he did thus far makes plenty of sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> awakened Foxy can stop time </br>  <br> shanks defeats Kid <br> "You name's Eustass "Captain" Kid right?" <br> "Y-yeah, so what?" <br> "My name's Shanks.

I never said any of them were irrational. Doffy shits on Bellamy because Bellamy sucks.</br>  <br> yeah and he refrained from being pissed off about anyone for fucking up his crew. <br>What the fuck are you talking about anymore? Do you not read my replies? Are you now talking about when he's confronting Viola again? He was fucking pissed off. That's all we know, and that's all we have to know. This doesn't tell us jack shit what he was pissed off about. He could've been pissed off about a lot of fucking things. He was having a pretty shitty day. He doesn't have to fucking list shit off for you so you check off a list and be like 'oh okay he's mad about that and that and that'. <br><br>Holy shit man. I'm gonna stop since your reasonings don't really do it for me, and you're going in fucking circles at this point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eustass Shanks don't you mean?</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br> treating a literally retarded fanboy as Bellamy like the retarded fuckup he is means Doflamingo's a monster </br>  <br> Baby5, Señor Pink, hell, on his entire family, who doesn't have the same goal. <br>there goal is simply to make doffy suceed even if the whole world dies. It doesn't matter. Bellamy just wants to be a pirate and part of the crew of that one cool guy.<br><br><br> What the fuck are you talking about anymore? Do you not read my replies? Are you now talking about when he's confronting Viola again? He was fucking pissed off. That's all we know, and that's all we have to know.

He doesn't have to fucking list shit off for you so you check off a list and be like 'oh okay he's mad about that and that and that'. <br>no you are simply retarded. Doffy shows over and over again that he only cares about himself in the end, thus ignoring the fate of the people who fought for him. He didn't even care if they are alive or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be Eustass Shanks - Kid is the first name. <br><br>Just like Monkey D. Luffy, Monkey D. Dragon, Monkey D. Garp etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> on his entire family, who doesn't have the same goal <br>Uh, why wouldn't they?</br></br>  <br><br>It would still trigger me</br></br>  <br>Doffy just doesn't like Bellamy. Why is that so hard to digest. Honestly Bellamy would've been a pretty fucking useful lackey to have, seeing how loyal he is to Doffy. But Doffy just kept trying to get rid of him every chance he got. For whatever reason, he didn't like him from the beginning and never considered him part of the family.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127918980 <br> straight up linking to reddit threads <br><br>bury yourself in shame</br></br></br>  <br> would've been a pretty fucking useful lackey to have <br>Bellamy pls</br></br>  <br>My bad, I read sycophantic as psychopathic, so I thought you were talking about Doflamingo. Well that still wouldn't be exactly wrong, but I thought you meant to say it was stupid to try to read into a character who isn't rational by any means.</br>  <br> Honestly Bellamy would've been a pretty fucking useful lackey to have <br>Meh</br></br>  <br> Doffy shows over and over again that he only cares about himself in the end <br>and i've seen evidence showing otherwise so whatever man. you could think what you think about his character and i'll think what I think. doesn't even matter anyway.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127918980 <br> reddit <br>Get the fuck out right now and never come back.</br></br>  <br> and i've seen evidence showing otherwise so whatever man. you could think what you think about his character and i'll think what I think. doesn't even matter anyway. <br>well it does, if you misunderstand what's happening and you're still posting and trying to argue about things you didn't understand in the first place.</br></br>  <br>That nigga is already gorilla</br>  <br><br>Not strength-wise, but I mean Doffy could've asked him to do whatever shit and Bellamy would've followed his orders. 'Useful' as in he could be used. <br><br>Doffy doesn't really take in everyone that's ready to be at his disposal. He's got some criteria and Bellamy just didn't fit, regardless of his strength.</br></br></br></br>  Have somebody points out that Oda keeps true with his word on how Killer eats with mask on?  <br>Because they don't know about it. That much was confirmed by Corazon, only the executives know. They're following Doffy because they like him and because they need a job. They're pretty much the same as Bellamy. Except Doffy likes them.<br><br><br>There is always a reason why someone doesn't like someone else. You don't just keep shitting on someone and play with them just because. There is obviously a deeper, daddy issues related reason. Though Doflamingo might not realize this himself.<br>  But Doffy just kept trying to get rid of him every chance he got <br>He's purposefully playing with him by giving him hope and then crushing them. He is the one who allowed him to come back, he is the one who offered him to sport his flag. If he wanted him out, he would have done it long ago. He's just having too much fun bullying the avatar of his father.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im more interested in seeing Kid get absolutely shitrekt by Shanks.</br>  <br> There is obviously a deeper, daddy issues related reason. <br>that's literally your headcanon, doffy clearly wouldn't act with his dad the way he did with bellamy.</br></br>  I'm a little suprised he made no reference to Luffy/Law beating Dofla.<br>He must have just expected it given what he knows of Luffy.<br><br>Luffy's bounty's gonna be fucking huge after this.</br></br></br>  <br>Vergo and Doffy fucked him up good</br>  <br> obviously daddy-issue related <br>Homming and Bellamy are not very alike at all. Doffy hates Bellamy because he's a dick-riding faggot who can't do anything properly. He's not this old friend that's along for the ride, he's a starry-eyed fanboy who doesn't deserve Doffy's respect, and also frequently fails. It's no more complicated than that.</br></br>  <br>I'm not misunderstanding anything. You and I just have different interpretations of a character. You have your reasons that I don't really find as concrete facts about anything. And you don't think my reasons are valid either. Whatever, it happens. I think he cares about his family at least a little bit in his own way and you don't. <br><br>When I said it doesn't even matter anyway, I meant, I don't really fucking care what you think about him honestly. I don't even know I continued that argument as long as I did.</br></br></br>  <br>They all, maybe but Baby5, just want to make Doffy happy and do anything that would please him.</br>  <br> because he's a dick-riding faggot who can't do anything properly <br>You just described Homing.<br> he's a starry-eyed fanboy who doesn't deserve Doffy's respect, and also frequently fails <br>You just described Gladius and the high executives.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think he cares about his family at least a little bit in his own way and you don't. <br>and that is wrong, I said in the very beginning that he does as as long as they are useful for HIM. When he knew that they lost he just didn't care anymore. It's always about HIM and not them. If you have no reading comprehension and you're trying to dicuss without reading the beginning of the discussion, you really shouldn't post here.</br></br>  <br><br>Well even Baby 5 did when Doffy 'needed' her.</br></br>  <br>Law also played him like a fool. <br><br>Smoker is too weak for the new world, pretty everyone these days is capable of wreaking his shit.</br></br></br>  <br> You just described Homing. <br>I'm not the anon you are arguing with, but Homing actually did what he wanted: leaving the tenryuubito.<br><br> You just described Gladius and the high executives. <br> frequently fails <br>yeah no, dressrosa was most likely the very first "war" that the doffy family lost.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When the fuck has Doffy's father ever been a dick-riding faggot? He was a kindhearted idealist. And Doffy treats the executives better because they have been his friends for a long time, and likely fuck up less frequently</br>  <br>But Jora wasn't useful when she was taken hostage on the Sunny. She was a hindrance. And so was Trebol for most of the fight on the king's palace.</br>  <br>Over 9000 milliseconds in  gimp .</br>  <br>Yeah, but she didn't do it for Doffy like all the others, she did it because she needed to be useful to Doffy. And he just happened to be the one who she always came back. She probably had 'betrayed' him a few times before the family got her back (Lao G sees through this and comes to 'rescue' her)</br>  <br> But Jora wasn't useful when she was taken hostage on the Sunny. <br>Jora wasn't completly defeated, so he knew he could still use her later on and he did when she used the dwarf to fix sugar.<br><br> And so was Trebol for most of the fight on the king's palace. <br>No Trebol go tfucked, but wasn't "defeated/passed out" and he actually tried later on to be useful, by blowing himself up for doffy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Homing actually did what he wanted: leaving the tenryuubito <br>Oh please. He wanted to live a nice cosy life away from the holy land and the tenryubito. Sure he succeeded in the later, but what good was it if he failed the former ?<br><br> ever been a dick-riding faggot? He was a kindhearted idealist <br>Same difference.  Nah just joking. <br>Bellamy was an idealist too. He idealized pirates and the pirate life while Homing idealized humans and the life outside the holy land. And they both threw away their birthright to live an affluent life for their dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sure he succeeded in the later, but what good was it if he failed the former ? <br>he stayed true to himself, didn't he? Unlike Bellamy who just gave up at one point and let himself get fucked.<br><br><br> And they both threw away their birthright to live an affluent life for their dream. <br>And that is practically meaningless as Doffy did not care about that. He didn't look at bellamy and saw his past. That simply was NEVER the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jora wasn't completly defeated, so he knew he could still use her later on and he did when she used the dwarf to fix sugar <br>You're just reaching. When Doffy saw Jora being taken hostage, do you seriously think he thought to himself "oh, she wasn't defeated' ?<br>You have a curious conception of defeat. She failed at doing her job, yet Doffy still held her dear enough to save her. There is no other interpretation of that scene.</br></br></br>  <br> She failed at doing her job, yet Doffy still held her dear enough to save her <br>and that's why he attacked the ship on which she was?</br></br>  <br>You are working waaaaaay too hard to draw parallels between those characters. Is this some sort of Freudian obsession you have? Everything has to stem from daddy issues? Bellamy was a misanthropic asshole who had a huge hard-on for doflamingo. There is nothing similar between Homing believing that the Tenryuubito were wrong and Bellamy looking up to a local celebrity. Doflamingo had plenty of better reasons to be displeased with Bellamy than some extremely tenuous connection to his dead dad.</br>  <br> he stayed true to himself, didn't he? <br>And Bellamy didn't ? Are you serious ? That was the whole point of his choosing to fight Luffy: staying true to his principles. He choose to be loyal to Doffy, so he'd stick with it, no matter what happens.<br>Fucking speedreader.<br><br> He didn't look at bellamy and saw his past <br>Yes he did, in fact, he knew before he even saw his face </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why he let the Sunny go when Law threatened to kill her.<br>Obviously he would have saved Caesar and her both, had he managed to destroy the ship.</br></br>  <br> And Bellamy didn't? <br>No he did not you speedreader. He literally asks luffy to be killed right there. Afterwards he fought luffy to die by his hands and not to help doffy, he even says that you retarded mach 20 reader.<br><br> Yes he did, in fact, he knew before he even saw his face  <br> looks like he doesn't give a fuck about bellamy <br> I SWEAR GUYS HE REMEMBERS HIS FATHER <br>Are you mentally challenged?<br><br><br> That's why he let the Sunny go when Law threatened to kill her. <br>while she was still conscious and not rekt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Almost everyone in OP threads was convinced that Luffy was going to attack Big Mom and that Kid was going to attack Kaidou.<br>How does it feel to be proven wrong? Losers.</br></br>  <br>Anon can you call me a mach 20 speed reader too?</br>  <br> he does as as long as they are useful for HIM <br> It's always about HIM and not them <br> . When he knew that they lost he just didn't care anymore. <br>Holy fucking shit. I know what you're fucking saying. And I've been saying I don't fucking agree with the above points. In the end you're saying he only cares about himself right? And I'm saying I don't agree with that point.<br> It's always about HIM and not them. <br> It's always about HIM and not them. <br> It's always about HIM and not them. <br> It's always about HIM and not them. <br>Let me make it clear for you since you need everything fucking spoonfed to you like a braindead retard holy fuck.<br>I think he fucking cares about his family at least a little bit while you don't think so, REGARDLESS IF THEIR EXISTENCE HELPS HIM ACHIEVE HIS GOALS OR NOT . <br><br>We've seen him sacrifice the success of a fight(and retrieval of Caesar, pretty goddamn important) in order to protect his family members who HAVE OBVIOUSLY FAILED IN THEIR JOB<br> When he knew that they lost he just didn't care anymore. <br>We've seen his response to his families failures like I fucking mentioned 10 times. He forgave them like it was nothing. He didn't deem them useless afterwards or anything. Failure from his inner family doesn't make him think any less of them. We've seen how he treats his subordinates that are not part of his 'family', like Bellamy. When Bellamy lost in the Colosseum, Doffy sent Dellinger to kill him.<br><br>There just seems to be differences in how he treats his main family okay? Holy shit but seriously whatever. Think what you think and I'll think what I think. But don't fucking shit on my interpretations when your reasons for yours aren't that much better than mine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>are you retarded? At no point did he care if his dressrosa excecutives are still alive or not.</br>  <br>You go girl.</br>  <br> Because they don't know about it. <br>They don't know Doffy wants to be pirate king?</br></br>  <br>fucking shit.</br>  <br>Virgo? Monet? Jora? Baby 5/Buffalo?</br>  <br> changing the subject <br>We were talking about whether Doflamingo knew about Bellamy's past. He did. You were wrong.<br> I SWEAR GUYS HE REMEMBERS HIS FATHER <br>Oh please, it's subtler than that, just saying he despises people who throw away good situations for their dreams. Isn't it logical for a guy who's entire character is being buttravaged because he lost his status ? Because of this exact kind of idealistic people too ?<br><br> No he did not you speedreader. He literally asks luffy to be killed right there. Afterwards he fought luffy to die by his hands and not to help doffy, he even says that you retarded mach 20 reader <br>It doesn't matter what his intentions were, he still remained loyal to Doflamingo, technically. Bellamy's been playing with technicalities in pretty much the same way when he got Luffy out of the coloseum. "I won't show you the way, but I'm getting out, so if you follow me, you might be able to get out too".<br>Sure you might interpret that as betrayal but to Bellamy it isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're pretty much the same as Bellamy <br>Bellamy didn't share 20+ years with Doffy and helped him achieving his goals. Bellamy isn't a friend of Doffy.Bellamy is just a retarded fanboy that keeps coming back after Dofla keeps slapping his shit.</br></br>  <br> Virgo? Monet? Jora? Baby 5/Buffalo? <br>DRESSROSA<br><br><br> We were talking about whether Doflamingo knew about Bellamy's past. <br>what? We weren't are you retarded? We were discussing bellamy = doffy's dad, which is fucking wrong.<br><br> It doesn't matter what his intentions were, he still remained loyal to Doflamingo, technically.  <br> Says why he is truly fighting luffy <br> no he is trying to remain loyal <br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mangafox <br><br>First reddit and now mangafox, One Piece fags really are growing more cancerous.</br></br></br>    <br> It doesn't matter what his intentions were, he still remained loyal to Doflamingo, technically.  <br> Says why he is truly fighting luffy <br> no he is trying to remain loyal <br>You probably haven't read enough chinese comics. Appearances are key. While he did it so Luffy would kill him, he still wanted it to look like he remained loyal to Doflamingo to the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br> DRESSROSA <br>Why does this fucking matter? Just because we're in a different arc, the dynamics between Doffy and his family suddenly changes? And the Jora incident happened in Dressrosa. So there's your example if it even makes a fucking difference.</br></br>  <br>He meant the Dressrosa executives.</br>  <br>I meant that Doffy never looked at bellamy and saw his own past eg his father.<br><br><br> While he did it so Luffy would kill him, he still wanted it to look like he remained loyal to Doflamingo to the end. <br>yeah for luffy, so that luffy would kill him and not to actually help doffy.<br><br><br> And the Jora incident happened in Dressrosa. <br>as I said in teh beginning he only cared about her because hse still was useful for him. And she actually was, see Sugar, but he proved over and over again that as soon as someone passes out. He doesn't care about them in the least thus proving that him caring about them is all about their usefullness for him and nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I wasn't aware there were Punk Hazard executives or that they were treated differently from the rest.</br>  <br>Jora would have been way more useful dead in that situation.</br>  <br>There was a difference. He ordered Vergo and Monet to kill themselfs.That's why he spoke to them and showed affection. After they died he mentioned them ones and didn't really care anymore. Also he didn't care about anyone of his family inside the birdcage.</br>  <br>  I wasn't aware there were Punk Hazard executives <br>Really?</br></br>  <br> ra would have been way more useful dead in that situation. <br>literally for you. Why would I let a excecutive die if I'm not sure that I can kill the enemys?</br></br>  <br>  but he proved over and over again that as soon as someone passes out. He doesn't care about them in the least thus proving that him caring about them is all about their usefullness for him and nothing else <br>At no point were we shown Doffy learning about the fate of his executives.</br></br>  <br> as I said in teh beginning he only cared about her because hse still was useful for him. And she actually was, see Sugar, but he proved over and over again that as soon as someone passes out. He doesn't care about them in the least thus proving that him caring about them is all about their usefullness for him and nothing else. <br> proved <br> proving <br>And I've already given my points why I don't anything of that is 'proven'. But whatever man I'm done. Being called a retard by a retard isn't gonna faze me anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one living on Punk Hazard was Monet. The rest weren't stationed in Dressrosa. And Caesar isn't an executive.<br>You're like these retards who think the colosseum fighters live on Dressrosa.</br></br>  <br>you don't think he could've taken out law? you actually think he was scared that Sanji, Chopper, Brook, and Nami would've beaten him?</br>  <br>Wait, what?<br><br>How the hell you can go from spaghetti through holes to who attack who?</br></br></br>  <br>Sanji, Chopper, Brook, and Nami would've beaten him?<br>Scratch that. Sanji wasn't even there at the time.</br></br>  <br>When the enemies are a bunch of kids, when Sanji was insta parasyted, and the strongest out of them was a fruit user on a ship ? <br>All he had to do was slice the ship in two.</br></br>  <br>he was</br>  <br>Nice headcanon.</br>  <br>Oh, my bad. Well either way, doffy could've rekted them easily.</br>  <br> At no point were we shown Doffy learning about the fate of his executives. <br>Trebol "died" in front of him. At the worst he did when Gear 4 luffy was hyped by the colloseum guy.<br><br><br>retard.<br><br><br><br> you don't think he could've taken out law? <br>No, but Law could room his own ass away, so going for the kill and meaninglessly letting jora die isn't the right choice.<br><br><br>I said that he mentioned them ones retard. You have no reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, and then he would have the most important man for his plans back - Caesar. Still he didn't.</br>  <br>Obviously his mentioning them means he cares. What the fuck is wrong with you ? Why else would he mention them, and why would he need to mention them more than once ?</br>  <br> No, but Law could room his own ass away, so going for the kill and meaninglessly letting jora die isn't the right choice. <br>Doflamingo was going after Caesar on the Sunny. Law wasn't using Jora to protect himself, he was using it to let the Sunny team get away with Caesar. The smart thing for Doffy to do would've been to go after the Sunny regardless if Law was going to kill Jora on the bridge or not.</br></br>  <br>You're ridiculous. If you can't admit that you're wrong, at least stop posting.</br>  <br>doffy didn't choose it, the crew coup de bursted away before he reacted to law taking jora hostage. Reread it.<br><br><br>You don't even have any arguments.<br><br><br> Obviously his mentioning them means he cares. <br>reread . He cared only enough to list them to the things that got fucked up, nothing else, no personal grudge, nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the crew coup de bursted away before he reacted to law taking jora hostage.  <br>He could've easily chased after them. I'm pretty sure Coup de burst doesn't blast them off to distances farther than the difference between Dressrosa and Punkhazard. And we know how fast Doffy can travel with his strings. He did choose not to chase after them because of Jora.</br></br>  <br> Edition <br>Cancerous as always.</br></br>    <br>It is always funny to see how a single word can trigger you autists</br>  <br> the crew coup de bursted away before he reacted to law taking jora hostage. Reread it. <br>Nope</br></br>  <br>law stayed behind, so obviously he couldn't. They literally fuck off and next page is about him law discussing shit, because he went after them he would time to do that and law could room his own ass or Doffy's away. Law literally is biggest hindrace anyone can have just area wise, Because he can switch shit all the time.<br><br><br>yeah that's why he didn't care about trebol.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see him saying anything that suggests that he puts jora's life above ceasar's capture. As you can see they suddenly blasted away before he even could answer jora.</br>  <br><br>That picture literally shows them bursting away before Doffy does anything.</br></br>  <br> he can't makes SMILES anymore <br> doesn't have a marine spy anymore <br> Lost a Logia user (probably spent alot of money on that) <br> lost his slave labor <br> everyones realized he's a Tyrant <br><br>He treats his family as useful tools<br>He views their deaths as insults to him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He views their deaths as insults to him <br>this is actually pretty accurate. He is listing everything that he used and can't use anymore. That's really like he's counting tools.</br></br>  <br> I don't see him saying anything that suggests that he puts jora's life above ceasar's capture. <br>Are you serious? Why do you need everything to be stated outright for you? You really can't tell by his expression and the way he hesitates that Jora's life is important to him? Or at least to the point of him stopping from going after Caesar? What's the point of reading comics if you need every last detail spelled out for you. You're supposed to look at the pictures while you read in this medium bud.</br></br>  <br>yet he saved trebol from law early in the fight</br>  <br> That picture literally shows them bursting away before Doffy does anything. <br>Yeah because he hesitates the moment he sees Jora was taken hostage.</br></br>  <br> You really can't tell by his expression and the way he hesitates that Jora's life is important to him? Or at least to the point of him stopping from going after Caesar? <br> You're supposed to look at the pictures while you read in this medium bud. <br>Yes and the picture literally proves that they blasted away before doffy could decide what he'll do.<br><br><br>As I said as long as there is a change that the'll be useful, he cares, but as soon as they are down, they practically don't exist anymore for him to consider helping 'em.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yeah that's why he didn't care about trebol.  <br>Law tries to distract Doffy from Luffy by attacking trebol. And Doffy falls for it. He tries to save him even though he's in the middle of a fight against Luffy. Now that I think about it, Law is a pretty heartless bastard to keep using this to his advantage.</br></br>  <br> Yes and the picture literally proves that they blasted away before doffy could decide what he'll do. <br/></br>  <br> Law tries to distract Doffy from Luffy by attacking trebol. And Doffy falls for it. He tries to save him even though he's in the middle of a fight against Luffy. <br>I meant that's why he didn't care about trebol when he "died" (I know he's alive and all).<br><br><br>whcih does not imply that he DECIDED to put jora's life above the capture of ceasar. Before he could decide they blasted away, so saying that he cared more about Jora than ceasar is simply wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> whcih does not imply that he DECIDED to put jora's life above the capture of ceasar. <br>The fact that he hesitates even a little bit shows that he cares somewhat about her well-being. Jora even has time to tell Doffy to just sacrifice her before Sunny bursts off. And he could've still went after them after they coup de bursted off, but he chose to stay and talk with Law until he got Jora back.</br></br>  <br> And he could've still went after them after they coup de bursted off <br>this is simply wrong, because none of us knows how fast the coup the burst is in relation to doffy. We don't know how long he would need to catchup and this scenario you are completly ignoring law, who could simply threw jora into teh water and room doffy's ass for a little while, so the strawhats could fuck off either way. Losing Jora like that woudl be the dumbest mistake he could have made.<br><br> Jora even has time to tell Doffy to just sacrifice her before Sunny bursts off. <br>Now you are suggesting that Doffy knows what the Coup de Burst is, but I don't think so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I meant that's why he didn't care about trebol when he "died" (I know he's alive and all). <br>Why are you ignoring his emotions to Virgo and Monet's death? People could say the same thing to you and say "And that's why he cared about Virgo and Monet". You just keep repeating examples that have counter-examples to 'prove' a point. People have examples why they think Doffy cares about them and you have your examples of why you don't think so. Just let it go man. Your points aren't any more 'valid' than mine or anyone else you're arguing with regarding this subject.</br></br>  <br> Why are you ignoring his emotions to Virgo and Monet's death? <br>Ordering someone to die and speaking with them because of that is a whole other thing than not giving a fuck about your people falling in battle.</br></br>  <br> Now you are suggesting that Doffy knows what the Coup de Burst is, but I don't think so. <br>No I didn't suggest that. I just said that he was hesitating for a bit there. <br> Losing Jora like that woudl be the dumbest mistake he could have made. <br>Not really. Sunny bursted off more into the sea. If Doffy went after them right away, I don't see how Law could've gone after Doffy, unless he could constantly find things in the air to room switch with all the way through. Doffy travels fast with his strings. It didn't take him long to get from Dressrosa to Punk Hazard. The Coup de Burst probably doesn't blast them off long distances, and after the initial burst they'd be going at normal sail boat speed which isn't all that fast. Doffy could've easily caught up with them if he went after them right away.</br></br></br></br>  I'm sure Doffy does care about his subordinates but only to a certain point a his convenience. What he defines as care/love can mean something else to other characters. E.g. he did care about Vergo and Monet, but in the end, his fights with Law and Fluffy barely touched upon their death, rather than having a great part of the fight fueled by his feelings due to their deaths.  <br> Not really. Sunny bursted off more into the sea. If Doffy went after them right away, I don't see how Law could've gone after Doffy, unless he could constantly find things in the air to room switch with all the way through.

The Coup de Burst probably doesn't blast them off long distances, and after the initial burst they'd be going at normal sail boat speed which isn't all that fast. Doffy could've easily caught up with them if he went after them right away. <br> assumptions: the post <br>Law was like the ship right in front of him. So bypassing law would be the first thing he would have to do.</br></br></br>  <br>For the last time, he's saying "Fine by me," as in I don't want to come back to the Marines.<br><br>He's not going after the two at all. How do people not see this? Mangapanda really dropped the ball this week.</br></br></br>  <br>Law shambled himself on the bridge before the Sunny burst off. Law didn't leave with the Sunny.</br>  where the fuck is everyone reading the manga?  <br>This is just the fans going with Oda and trying to give Doflamingo bad qualities. We had no reason shown on the story to doubt Doflamingo's care for his crew. On the contrary.</br>  <br>We buy it because we love and support our mangaka Oda-sensei.</br>  <br><br>He said where, not why.</br></br>  <br>I'm tired.</br>  <br> Oda <br>you mean Law. just because the protagonist of the story states something about a character that doesn't mean it's the way the author wants to portray said character. Law can think of Doffy in one way, and it's common for readers to take the protagonists words as 'fact'. But we've seen that characters in one piece are somewhat ambiguous when it comes to strictly 'good and bad' even if that person is on the protagonists side or against. Law hates Doffy and may be wrong about the fact the he 'only' takes in people that are convenient to him. Cause we've seen that's not the case with people like Bellamy, who would've been a pretty 'convenient' lackey. But Doffy didn't give a shit about him. Bellamy and Doffy's relationship is a perfect example of what this guy  sees. And also what Law might think too. <br><br>My point is. There are obvious differences on how Doffy treats his 'Family' vs everyone else. He just seems to care about his family a bit more than others in his own psychotic way. Whether it stems from their 'convenience' or not, he still shows more emotion towards them than anyone else, including his other 'convenient' subordinates.</br></br></br></br>  Where will he go now?<br><br>My immediate guess is with Barto but I'm not sure.<br>The marines might even take him as a member of Doffy's crew.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why he could still stall doffy of doffy decided to go for the sunny.<br><br><br> We had no reason shown on the story to doubt Doflamingo's care for his crew. <br>the whole situation after the birdcage was used, shows that he gave no fucks about their lives.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll go with Law, for fucks sake. North Blue's pride ? Fucker upper of Doffy's plans ? Bigger bounty ? A fucking D. like Luffy ? Luffy's fucking friend/ally ? It's not that fucking hard, people. Goodness me.</br>  A friend of mine is a huge fan of anime, has a massive wall of DVDs, watches it online, all that. I found out yesterday, after a blank look to something I was talking about, that he had never heard of One Piece. One of the god damn big three. He also prefers dubs, in case you wish to judge further.  <br>So who will take his place? A VA?</br>    <br> Two years ago <br><br>In real time. In One Piece it was probably a week ago. Remember the last time we saw all the super novas they were all up to their own activity and I think that was about when Law and Luffy were on Punk Hazard?</br></br></br>  <br> Bellamy on Law's crew <br><br>I could accept that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No it was pre-TS so 2 years ago.</br></br>  <br>Shanks will lose to Kid's alliance one way or another. <br>It's a plot device that will conveniently remove the need for Luffy to ever fight Shanks. <br>Same reason why both Whitebeard and Ace had to get axed.</br></br></br>  <br> Pre-TS <br><br>Oh, okay. Hopefully we get some resolution from what everyone was doing.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a plot device that will conveniently remove the need for Luffy to ever fight Shanks. <br>I agree that there is one, but it ain't Kidd's little posse.</br></br>  <br><br> same reason why <br><br>WB just wanted to make Ace the king, and Ace didn't give a shit.<br><br>Pretty sure Ace would ask WB to help Luffy if they had both lived.<br><br>Also with what Luffy did in the war, I doubt he'd ever have to fight them if they both survived, they'd be his allies.<br><br>I agree regarding Shanks though, might happen - I reckon he won't get defeated by the Alliance, but weakened before BB turns up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Urouge is probably healing from fighting one of the Yonkou's crews or something anyway - unless he got completely rekt and has been healing for 2 fucking years I can't see how it was from the old ladies.</br></br>  <br>You're the only one who will end up getting judged here, you neckbeard. No one fucking cares about your friend. If he doesn't like the arbitrary "big 3" then who are you to challenge his taste. He likes dubs? Who the fuck cares; if he enjoys it more then that's fine. As long as he is not an elitist sperg like I presume you to be, who must absolutely push his " correct opinion" on anyone different, then why bother with shallow criticism and most of all why shitpost here about it?!</br>  <br>Of course you would. It's the logical choice. With a little alterations to the tattoo's, he would fit right in. Would be funny too with his personality and the Heart Pirates shenanigans. It's the perfect place for him.<br><br><br>Ace wanted to make Whitebeard the King. He even says this to Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious to know who the old ladies were, if Drake ever got Kaido to head to that winter island, what that giant floating rock was that sucked up Capone, etc.</br>  <br> You're the only one who will end up getting judged here, you neckbeard. No one fucking cares about your friend. If he doesn't like the arbitrary "big 3" then who are you to challenge his taste. He likes dubs? Who the fuck cares; if he enjoys it more then that's fine. As long as he is not an elitist sperg like I presume you to be, who must absolutely push his " correct opinion" on anyone different, then why bother with shallow criticism and most of all why shitpost here about it?! </br>  <br>Either Drake beat Scotch and asked him to bring to Kaido or Kaido came there after Drake beat Scotch. And a lot of it might jut be unexplained and written off as New World's crazy happenings.<br><br>Although, someone did post a picture of a Moon painting that Enel found that looked like it had suction cups or whatever and so who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Judging by his expression in the last chapter, it might be possible that he was going up against Kaidou. Hence why he was shocked to hear about the events at Dressrosa and how they impact Kaidou. (Sure, some might argue that it might also hint that he is working with him, but there's no basis for it so far).</br>  <br>I'm sure we'll find all that out in time.<br><br>Oda loves putting little nuggets in to be fleshed out later.</br></br></br>  <br>What the hell are you talking about? Urouge doesn't know about Doffy's defeat. He isn't even reading the newspaper, fuck off with your headcanon.</br>  <br>You might want to rethink your entire post, anon. Urouge was all alone up there, as far as he knew and we know that Sky Islands only get some information of the Blue Sea from people who visit them. So Urouge will probably get an update but right now, he knows jack shit.</br>  <br>Why do they have to be little nuggets.<br><br>Why can't they just be like chicken wings or something huh?</br></br></br>  <br>"The information and images leaked to the 3 neighboring islands spread from island to island filled with real danger it blew through the world in the blink of an eye...a certain town...a certain sky"<br>From the chapter.<br><br>I'd say it's a fair bet he now knows.<br>There's those newspaper birds flying about everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Definitely with Law's crew. He'll get a tattoo makeover to cover up his old Doflamingo mark, just like Law did.</br>  <br><br>Yeah I know - but he didn't give a shit about being the king himself.</br></br>  <br>And that's why Oda doesn't show us how urouge would react if he knew it right? Because he already knows it, amirite?</br>  <br>Calm your tits, bro.<br><br>I'm just saying I think there's very good odds he's about to find out in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>I know that, I was saying that Ace wouldn't ask WB to help Luffy because Ace didn't want to make Luffy the King.</br>  <br>Yes but one of his subordinates came to him with some "shocking news" to warrant his facial expression. Now, as a person with a functioning brain, I can interpret the juxtaposing of this event next to all other supernovas finding out about Law and Luffy's feats, meant to signify that he too received the news and is this reacting to it. Sure it's not 100% given overtly, but it's definitely implied.<br><br>Now, was it that hard anon? Can you try to at least apply your brain a bit next time before you "open your mouth"?<br><br> Also, are you implying that island is miniscule and has no contact with the rest of the world? Surely you be jesting, if so. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think there's very good odds he's about to find out in my opinion. <br>that's a whole other point, of course he'll knew at some point, but he certainly doesn't do that now.<br><br><br> Yes but one of his subordinates came to him with some "shocking news" <br>nice headcanon see </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that's a whole other point, of course he'll knew at some point, but he certainly doesn't do that now. <br>2 minutes after he's shown in that chapter or later that day at the absolute latest</br></br>  <br> Kidd's little posse. <br>Kid entered the new world 2 years ago without conveniently being trained by roger's first mate or having external help whatsoever,unlike strawpleb.Nigga lost a hand and has assumably survived countless death battles.Also he's still alive despite the fact that he keeps attacking the yonko's subordinates and raise havok.This also applies to the other two.He at least have a legitimate chance to defeat shanks</br></br>  <br>the "shocking news" was that someone else was on the remote sky island besides Urouge and his crew you fuckbrain. Urouge was shocked because nobody should've been able to come to see them.</br>  <br>What was that about having a functioning brain and interpreting juxtapositions ? There's someone up there but we have literally no fucking idea who and what they're doing there.</br>  <br> 2 minutes after he's shown in that chapter or later that day at the absolute latest <br>and that's your headcanon, The only thing we know is that someone went to urouge. Nothing else. We don't know when he will come down to the blues sea and hear it.</br></br>  <br>it's called reading between the lines autist</br>  <br>I'm fairly sure that all they're doing is based on chance.<br> Magic Tarot Cards, tell me if we will die if we go after Shanks <br> Nope, he's actually a pretty chill gu- <br> HE'S THE WEAKEST! AFTER HIM! </br></br></br></br>  <br> and that's your headcanon, <br>No it isn't.<br> We don't know when he will come down to the blues sea and hear it. <br>News birds can fly, dipshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uroge was all alone up there <br>"We are recovering". Not I! Fucking speed readers can't even read the page that they are referencing!</br></br>  <br> News birds can fly, dipshit. <br>yes, but skypia confirmed that none of blue seas go there you piece of shit</br></br>  <br>Ah, yes, as in interpreting<br> Someone's here on the solitary cloud Island <br>to being<br> Some random fucker went all the way up, 10,000m to the goddamn sky, possibly risking death to deliver a fucking newspaper or a tid bit that likely doesn't even matter because Urouge is on the fucking sky, trying to recover from wounds. <br><br>But hey, I'm autistic, what do I know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All alone with his crew until the 'someone' turned up next to them.</br></br>  <br>Are you joking or are you being serious ? I honestly can't tell if you're taking the piss or just being retarded.</br>  They had newspapers on the sky island nami was sent on by kuma too, so...  <br>Shanks is probably laying around on a remote island and drinks himself to death every day.<br>Except from muh haki and muh sparring with mihawk we haven't seen anything that indicates he's trying to expand his influence in the new world.<br>He has to get down or lay down eventually anyway.<br>Everyone with half a brain would go after Shanks instead of Kaido or BB or even Big Mom</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you assume "solitary" means devoid of all contact. It's not fucking skypia. If Uroge can reach this small haven (which it isn't even shown how small it is, just solitary; for all we know it could be pretty large), why can't anyone else? I.e. the fucking news, either via den den or birds or even a messenger.</br>  <br>I would say that island is the exception, since they are scientists attempting to research weather. There's obviously someone who knows they are up there from the government or media.</br>  <br> Sanji being known and called by his epithet <br>Thats pretty neat</br></br>  <br><br>I agree regarding the birds, but I find the whole thing regarding the birds interesting.<br><br>On the Blue Sea they are trained to know the routes etc., but with NW and Sky Islands in the mix it's pretty interesting.<br><br>Either someone has discovered all these areas and sky islands AND trained/sent the birds along the routes, or<br><br> tfw the birds have CoO </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that Urouge was shocked that someone else was there suggests that in this context "solitary" means that there was no one on that sky island. Why would messenger birds fly up to an island that has no inhabitants? or at least where Urouge is supposed to be at the moment?</br>  <br>She's with Sengoku, no mention of Garp</br>  <br><br><br>I don't get why nobody wants to see Shanks v Luffy<br>It will be friendly rivalry match like Shanks v Mihawk for best swordsman<br>Shanks is "the gatekeeper" to One Piece, Luffy must defeat him.<br>It'll be breddi gud to see the hat back with its owner</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did we really see Whitebeard expanding his influence before the War ? During the War, we got see just how many allies and people he actually had but before that he was just an Old fucker on a single ship just like Shanks. And he was drinking himself to death too, almost literally. <br><br>I agree that he has to go down but I am certain that it will be against Luffy. Shanks will maintain his position just like Mihawk will remain at the top for Zoro. I base this on nothing but my gut feeling but that's all I really need.</br></br></br>  <br> the fucking news, either via den den or birds or even a messenger. <br>the thing is you retard that we did not see him getting the news and nothing suggest that he is getting it right now.</br></br>  So CP9 were the jobbers of the C9 organization? I thought CP9 were the elites  <br> Whitebeard expanding his influence <br><br>Kek. Anyway, he didn't have to. He had already built everything in the past. At this point he was just an old king enjoying his life drinking too much sake.</br></br></br>  <br>you CP organizaton? I thought CP1-9 don't really have rankings, but CP0 are the elites that work directly under the orders of the Celestial Dragons.</br>  <br>Even Kuma could recognise Sanji. It's only idiots like Luffy and Oz and gag moments that make it seem like Sanji's poster is completely different.</br>  <br>these fucking newspapers makes no sense , how they could already write an article on law / luffy when the fight has just ended.And if Oda skip 1/2 days , why caesar is still on sunny ?</br>  <br> He had already built everything in the past <br>And when did we find this out ? During the War. Why should Shanks be any different ? For all we know, the guy could have Elbaf and Oz's Island rooting for him. We don't know. Just like we didn't know much about Whitebeard in the beginning except for this title. And that a lot of people even on his ship couldn't handle Shank's haki.</br></br>  <br>They get the news, they print the news. Simple as that. I don't think it's a daily thing because we've seen ''Extras'' being thrown around here and there. Three Islands combined Mass production of news could probably get around pretty quickly.</br>  <br> And if Oda skip 1/2 days , why caesar is still on sunny ? <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Cover story</br>  <br>I'm not the same anon you were speaking to, so that response to me is pointless.<br><br> A lot of people even on his ship couldn't handle shank's haki <br><br>They were fodder.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant being known by name as a pirate, not the bounty gag. One guy said Black Leg to another and expected him to know who it was, thats pretty cool for Sanji. He has a reputation</br>  <br>You replied to me with what you thought and I replied back. Not really ''pointless''.</br>  <br>A threesome like the good old times</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>fuck off fujoshit</br>  This is the best One Piece flashback.  <br> implying Tsuru's washing won't make him purely evil instead </br>  <br>Agreed. It actually felt nice inside.</br>  <br> Hey Sabo can you give us a ride on your boat? <br> 'Kay <br>FTFY. Actually makes sense for Luffy and Law to get healed on their way to Zou.</br></br></br>  <br>to this day, i still dont get it.<br><br><br>What is that thing on nolands head?</br></br></br></br>  <br>the most forgettable you mean</br>  <br>a chestnut</br>  <br>Solo journey to find his true self. Why the fuck does everyone have to join someone's crew?</br>  Has Luffy really only been in the New World for three days? I'm confused.<br> muh lawlu theories </br>  <br>You say forgettable only because it is not related to any Strawhat</br>  <br>but why? Who the fuck has a chestnut on his fucking head?</br>  <br> rivalry match like Shanks v Mihawk for best swordsman <br>Nowhere it was stated that they were fighting for that title. It's obvious Shanks is a hand to hand fighting guy with a side of swordsman. Mihawk is the strongest swordsman.</br></br>  <br>Something like that, yes.</br>  <br>Just thinking how Luffy rang that bell after all those motherfucking years, after all that time, brings joy to my heart.<br><br>It makes me wonder how much the people of the Void Century have suffered. How they probably want justice too. I wonder if Joy Boy is the Void Century's Noland.</br></br></br>  <br>One Piece characters maybe?</br>  <br>idk, given monet and vergo, maybe marineford marked the start of people actually dying, or he could die offscreen</br>  <br>Next time Crocodile appears, I want to see Luffy thanking him for every time he saved his and Ace's ass much to everyone else's shock</br>  <br> Jinbe dies <br> Croc joins Straw Hats instead <br>How mad will you be?</br></br></br>  <br> Jinbe shits on luffy and joins the future pirateking crocodile <br>FTFY</br></br>  Why are they arresting Doffy? For all the government cares, he was just dealing with some pirates that were wrecking his shit. By the way, are him and Law still shichibukais?  <br>nigga, wat</br>  <br>SOU YUME O UTATTE</br>  <br>Uh.</br>  <br> By the way, are him and Law still shichibukais? <br>Not after this arc ends<br><br> For all the government cares, he was just dealing with some pirates that were wrecking his shit. <br>All those toys that turned to human again can prove his evil deeds, so the marine HAVE to capture him anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hi guys, been having a 2 year break from OP manga. Has the fisherman island arc ended yet? I wanna see some marine action etc</br>  <br>Meant to post this.</br>  <br> fisherman island </br>  <br>hair</br>  <br>The WG sure didn't care when he took over the country</br>  <br> Losing 2 shichis in one arc again <br><br>This shit is gonna get disbanded</br></br></br>  <br> fishman island <br>were already done with dressosa and that took 2 years</br></br>  <br>sea stones don't stop devil fruit powers it just makes the user paralysed</br>  <br>What? pls explain in normal terms i dont understand. has the arlong arc ended yet if it has is the current arc worth reading</br>  <br>King Riku and his soldiers were killing and setting fire to the entire country. Doflamingo saved everyone in the Public's eyes. Seriously, have you even read this arc ?</br>  Would you guys rather have Jimbei's fishman karate and his skill to talk to fish <br><br>Or some devil shit power?</br></br>  <br>No fuck off</br>  <br>Yes, because doffy was a hero and was blackmailing them and no one knew. Unlike now, the world knows about it now.</br>  <br>The fact that a fucking pirate took over a country should bother the WG enough, "hero" or not</br>    <br> a fucking pirate took over a country should bother the WG enough <br>not if that "fucking pirate" could reveal stuff to the world that would get you rekt</br></br>  <br>dressrosa was long but worth it<br><br> in punkhazard luffy and law started an alliance <br><br> in dressrosa we witness gear 4 <br><br> sanji is still gone </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dont care, still fapped to both pics</br>  <br>It probably did bother them but what the fuck could they do ? You saw all the people shitting themselves when Doffy 'resigned' from the Shichibukai. They were begging for him to stay. He was a bloody hero. No one had shit on him and Doffy had shit on the WG. <br><br>You're the same guy that was saying the WG let Crocodile take over Arabasta or whatever the fuck, yesterday, aren't you ?</br></br></br>  <br>my nigga</br>  <br>Oh okay thanks! Will read.</br>  <br> Secret Dellinger a whore thread <br>That's no secret though.</br></br>  Is Oda a hack?  <br>Only if Tokyo Ghoul is more mature than One Piece.</br>  <br>Not mad at all. It would be even better if Ivankov turned Crocodile back into a woman first.</br>  <br>I know why it's like this.<br><br>This is the mangareader version. Here it's like he is going after the two.</br></br></br>  <br>NANI!!?</br>  <br>dont worry when oda dies kubo has been selected as his heir</br>  <br>I kek'd</br>    <br> tfw a ugly fish can grow a better mustache than you </br>  <br>Why do you want a mustache anon ? Are you planned for a reconversion in the german porn industry ?</br>  <br>*planning</br>  <br>I'd look manly as fuck like the pirate king Roger or Mister Satan. <br><br>Fuck man.</br></br></br>  <br>"The old man was killed!? By Doflamingo!?<br><br>"...This is an old story... I can't be bitter about it."<br><br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought you were about to say Pirate King Satan there.</br></br>  <br>Drake's father. Doffy killed him in Law's flashback.<br>And stop reading Shitpanda.</br></br>  <br> Pirate King Satan <br>Someone need to photoshop this.</br></br>  <br>I'm so fucking good.</br>  <br>Do some people really not know that mangastream exists ?

It's no wonder Sengoku and Tsuru kept such a close eye on the Donquixote crew.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sometimes yes but less often than shitpanda, this week's mangastream chapter was pretty much flawless.</br></br>  <br>bullshit, it is a million times better than shitpanda even though they are still shit</br>  <br><br>Jesus christ, it's like the only thing they understood was "Straw hat" and "Law" and went by ear.</br></br>  <br><br>No it is not.

Which translation made more sense for the chapter as a whole ? What makes more sense for Fujitora to do now considering his morals and his past doings ?</br>  <br><br>I prefer it sounding like brain damaged japs speaking engrish than niggas.</br></br>    <br>I'm not talking about this chapter but in general. Is mangareader always this inaccurate?<br>Which one does generally speaking bring the better translations? stream, fox or panda</br></br>  <br>The nigga shit is more a problem with their Bleach translations than One Piece. If anything the last chapter sound like brits with all the "bloody" going on</br>  <br>The world will probably end before one piece...</br>  <br>mangareader does not translate, they just upload the shitpanda releases</br>  <br>I really don't want for Oda to have yet ANOTHER rouge Admiral. And Fujitora has been shown to be closer to the Marines' way of doing things than Aokiji was, so I can only see him rejoin them after Akainu gets yelled at by Kong or someone. I even think that Fujitora is infiltrating from the Revolutionaries, then he couldn't let himself lose that position.</br>  <br>Why would it die? Mangapanda's happy doing it for free, and sites like readmanga are willing to pay people for exclusivity if their translation is faster than anyone elses.</br>  <br><br> last chapter sound like brits <br><br>Picked the fuck up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I tried. Not very hard, mind you, but I tried.</br>  <br>British niggas will always make more sense than brain damaged japs though.</br>  What will be happen in chapter 800?<br> Kaido reveal <br> Big Mom reveal <br> Strawhat Reunion <br> Start Wano arc <br> all of the above <br> other? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I even think that Fujitora is infiltrating from the Revolutionaries <br>As far as baseless theories go I love this one   and Green Bull is Kaido's man . Kizaru is more loyal to the Tenryuubito, and with Aokiji AWOL Akainu doesn't have anyone loyal in his corner</br></br>  <br>It depends of the translators waltzing in and out of scanlation teams. But more often than not it's mangastream. Right now, it is mangastream.<br>Also see </br></br>  <br>Damn son, you need some help.</br>  <br>Vegapunk first appearance</br>  <br>We got the Kaido tease this chapter, thats usually enough for Oda for 100 chapters. I'm betting Blackbeard and his crew appear</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I really hope that Vegapunk doesn't disappoint. I think he's going to be quirky and random and that will make me hate him, the best would be if he's a NEET who only cares about robots and science, being pretty much an autist otaku.</br>  <br>People like you are the reason for half the shitposting that occurs in the thread.<br>Just read the translation that actually gives you the right information, dumbass.</br></br>  <br> Sir Crocodile <br> Working for anyone other than himself <br><br>Breh, do you even?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the absolute madman </br></br>  <br>Kizaru definitely has some secret. His backstory should be interesting to read, I hope we get to see it.</br>  <br>I'm sure I will be disappointed</br>  <br>i recognize that meme! nice ;)</br>  <br>He'll either be the sub-villain that never gets that much spotlight, or some twist will happen and he'll become much more prominent.</br>  <br>Why can't Kizaru just be a smug arsehole, who enjoys the privileges his rank grant him?</br>  Post yfw, in one of the final arcs, fucking everybody shows up.  <br>I'd drop this shit fast. Why would I want to see 10000 Namis?</br>    <br>This.<br>I hope he never changes.</br></br>  <br> final arc <br> everyone shows up <br> it progresses at a snails pace because of that </br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for the final arc, when everyone is getting their final battle to fulfill their dream. Each character should get around 5 chapters for the battle, plus 1 for the realization of the dream and closure as a character. This is Oda, and I expect anything but a rushed end to the manga.</br>  <br>Captain Morgan will be there, he'll be about to kill Luffy but then Helmeppo kicks his ass.</br>  <br> Marineford 2.0 <br><br> Marines <br> Yonkou <br> Shichibukai <br> All supernovas <br> Every allied crew <br> All the folks the SH have helped over the years <br><br>Battle Royale.<br>Believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Morgan will be Buggy 2.0. He started his career from Kuro and he will end up being the next Hero of the Marines.</br>   people actually want all the characters to show up in the final arc   Does the Cipher Pol hierachy go from 0 to 9 or is 0 completely seperate with the rest of CP going from 9 to 1, 9 being highest in hierachy?<br><br>And friendly reminder that there's literally no way the guy meeting with Urouge is Enel just for the fact that Enel's reintroduction is going to have to be massive.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Talking about the ending and Helmeppo, do you guys think OP will have an open ending? As in Corby becomes an Admiral, Luffy is the king and Corby ends up hunting Luffy like how it was with Roger and Garp and everyone on the crew having their dreams fulfilled, <br>Or do you think Oda won't leave anything open and will finish it just like how he wants it and won't let anything open for the readers to speculate.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hush, no pessimism, only hype now. Don't make me post the "Men's dreams never end page" again.<br><br><br>Sure, he'll be the final boss</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, Enel is just an overrated character, he's not coming bak and if he is he would get rekt by Urouge.</br>  <br>Woman please you won't post anything.<br><br>I dare you to post that page.</br></br></br>  <br> no way the guy meeting with Urouge is Enel <br>They don't have to be mutually exclusive though ? It could be Enel but just not revealed to be Enel until his re-introduction. It's completely possible.</br></br>  <br> lawlu kiss <br> law cries <br> momonosuke is kill <br> luffy and sabo catch up  <br> party like it's third impact </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so he'll kill Luffy? Maybe Zoro too? <br> tfw it could have just ended after the sixth chapter </br></br>  <br>Luffy will die at the end, that's for sure.</br>  <br>Isn't the first ending you mentioned the closed ending ? Everything happens and all loose ends are tied. The open ending would be if some people's dreams haven't been completed or if they were still sailing on or something.</br>  <br> so he'll kill Luffy and Zoro ? <br>No, he wouldn't. Buggy never killed anyone, he just got the fame. Same with Morgan.</br></br>  Sakazuki looks fucking weird with a white jacket, but I love it.  <br>The dream lives.<br>Kuro, Wapol, Gin, Chimney, Porche, Mr.4, Genzo. All in one huge battle royale.

Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.<br><br>I personally don't think it's as bad as everyone here is bitching about it, but then again I've been used to English dubs of anime for forever. The only things I really don't like are JYB as Jonathan (his presence was inevitable really but I did NOT expect them to cast him as any Jojo, much less the very first one, and his performance doesn't seem that great to make up for it either) and Papenbrook as Caesar (admittedly because his roles are all from shows/characters I really don't like, and we haven't even heard anything from him yet so he could prove me wrong, but I doubt it).</br></br></br>  Plot armor aside, how the FUCK did Jotaro survive any of DIO's attacks? Specifically, the scene right after "I feel like singing!" when DIO punches Jotaro into the ground. The World and Star Platinum are essentially the same stand, in strength and abilities, and when Jotaro Oraora'd DIO directly, it left him with holes in his body. And DIO could punch a whole directly through Kakyoin, penetrating the human body.<br><br>So when The World repeatedly punched Jotaro, how did he only get broken bones, which still wouldn't have been easy to shake off? Did DIO hold back for the sake of Road Roller use?</br></br>    <br>Still had magazines under his shirt to absorb blows, also had Star Platinum actively guarding him</br>  <br>It showed Star Platinum breaking his fall, but The World even broke Star Platinum's guard while he was kicking him.</br>  When is the final JoJo BD going to come out?  <br>Looking back<br> 3 punches to break bones <br> kick in the face <br> final time stop <br>So yeah, Dio was probably just trying to break some bones so Jotaro couldn't escape the road roller da</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>newfags also forget that hamon existed for a whopping two years before stands were introduced, hell, i don't even think there was a break between the end of battle tendency and the beginning of stardust crusaders.<br><br>can't find the individual chapter release date but the first SC volume was released 2 months after battle tendency's final volume release</br></br></br>  <br> David wastes all their budget getting licensed songs for the EDs <br> implying <br>The song they licensed don't cost that much</br></br></br>  <br>What if Araki wants a Queen song for part 4?

Wasn't Build Me Up Buttercup on his list?</br>  I just finished Part 4 and want to move on to Part 5, but apparently the re scanlation stopped because of Viz acquiring something or whatever. So, is Part 5's bad translation worth my time? If it isn't can I skip it and just wait for colored JoJo or something?  <br>We don't know about Walk Like An Egyptian, but both Roundabout and Last Train Home were his suggestions. <br><br>That thing about Build Me Up Buttercup is something someone here made up and parroted long enough that some others started believing it despite there being no source.</br></br></br>  <br>oh man this would be great for the ED, it even sounds vaguely Bowieish</br>  <br>There are some cool fights that shine through the bad translation, and Part 5 isn't THAT long. It's at the edge of skippable, but don't skip it.<br><br>Just be ready to reread it when they finish the new scanlation in 2020</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll read it. Thanks.</br>  Who are the worst?<br><br> JosephFags  or  Dio-have-all-joestar-standFags ?</br></br>  <br> GayPriestfags </br>  <br>The latter.</br>  <br>Hotpantsfags</br>  Which jojo would win a no-powers fight? My money's on either Jonathan, Jotaro or Josuke  <br>I was one of the second until I came here and realized that Araki just can't write consistency for shit</br>  <br>Jotaro sent an adult flying with just his fists. In kid form.<br>He would absolutely trash everyone.</br></br>  <br>i dont understand joseph fags i mean sure have a favourite jojo and all but .....</br>  <br>When you say "no powers fight," do you mean just a straight-up brawl or are outside resources allowed as well? I feel like Giorno being the head of a huge crime organization would have at least some advantages in some way.<br><br><br>Joseph's as valid a choice of favorite jojo as any other. I don't thin there's much to "understand." I personally don't get why Josuke is so disproportionately popular  but then again I didn't think Part 4 was all it was cracked up to be either.  Which is not to say I dislike him or anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but jospeh hid a tommy gun in his jacket</br>  So I just got to the Wekapipo and magenta Magenta fight and I have a couple observations: <br> If Gyro's so practiced at Spin and has been doing the Golden Rotation for at least a while, why does he still need a reference to do it? Is practicing not enough to memorize it? <br> The fact that there's no Golden Ratio in their hands or faces or anything would suggest that their proportions aren't "beautiful" which amuses me a lot for some reason </br></br>  drama time<br>sort jojos from best to worse<br><br>johnny&gt;(young)joseph&gt;jo2uke&gt;josuke&gt;<wbr>jolyne&gt;jotaro&gt;joseph&gt;jonathan&gt;giorn<wbr>o</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>   reading crossover madoka/jojo fanfiction <br><br>god damn it why is there literally no good jojo-related literature besides purple haze which was too damn short and had a shitty translation<br><br>it's all DIO slash, why</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Was an animeonly for a while <br> Loved Joseph to death <br> Read the manga <br> tfw Johnyfag now </br></br></br></br></br>  Is Josuke an incel?  <br>Are you me in the ireneverse?</br>  <br>I feel you. I deeply feel you. Your feeling I can feel deeply. <br><br>My craving for literature in general is serious and I like Jojo enough to want more of it.</br></br></br>  <br> reading fanfiction <br>There's your problem.<br>Fanfiction is only acceptable if it has a porn comic attached to it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>you guys are both me<br>but to be fair johnny is basically a well written realistic joseph</br></br></br>  <br>What was your issue with the PHF translation? It seemed fine to me.</br>  <br>Nah, Harry Potter has plenty of well written fanfiction. It's less than 0.01%, but it exists. Naruto has one or two decent fics that try to fix the shit that's the source material, but everything else has only shitty fanfiction.<br><br>I expected jojo to have more fans because the manga is creative as shit and I hoped some of that creativity went into good writers. But nope.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not wrong or anything, but the author didn't take the liberties a translator needs to take in order to translate a japanese light novel. It's dry as fuck, and has a ton of narration cliches.<br><br>The story itself was pretty good, though. I liked the stands.</br></br></br>  <br> Nah, Harry Potter <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying HP is good by itself, I'm just saying that good fanfiction of it does exist. I'd rather we not talk about it and make this jojo thread even more off-topic, though, so let's agree to disagree.</br>  <br>I mean, take Jotaros Ravioli:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD-<wbr>ZWzssjBQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>Your next post will be "Why was this written, it's really, really weird."</br></br></br>  <br>What? But the only things they have in common are being sluts and having deeply homoerotic rivalry-friendships with Zeppelis. Other than that they're pretty fucking different. Unless I'm missing something.</br>  <br><br>He's one of the most well written Jojos, probably because their was only one other person traveling with him in the longest part, giving Araki room to write him well.</br></br>  <br>Imagine a decent writer looked at Joseph and designed to adapt him to a realistic western world with a new backstory.</br>  <br> THIS ENTIRE POST <br>Holy fuck anon go to /b/ for a couple years and aquamate before you start posting on 4chan.</br></br>  <br>The word is acclimate, as you'd know if you read literature of every kind instead of being an elitist without reason.<br><br>To be honest I don't give a shit about the off-topic, I just don't think people can reason with the unreasonable, and I don't want to waste my time. As I'm doing right now, so I'll just ignore any further replies.</br></br></br>  <br>Is "realistic" just a new buzzword that means "things I like"?<br><br>How the fuck can you look at anything of SBR and think it's "realistic" in any way?</br></br></br>  <br>The characters are pretty realistic, the setting is obviously fantasy.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I just realized I wrote "realistic western world", my bad. You know what I mean now.</br>  Shows that deserve a second season but will never get one.  Air Gear  <br>I don't know... Noucome flopped hard and apparently the Nips didn't like it anyway. If anything, Oreshura is the one that deserves a second season, if only because its end was so open.</br>  Consider this: Haremshits don't deserve shit  <br>this</br>  <br>Not OP, but I liked Noucome for the comedy. If it weren't a harem I'd like it just as much if not more.</br>  It has more than enough of source material to back it up, and Yen Press is licensing the LNs, so there might be interest..?  Tsuritama  <br>Getting the obvious out of the way.</br>    Gantz  <br>diomedea should just make more ika musume</br>      Darker than Black  <br>Nah, S2 was already worse than S1.</br>    <br>so boring<br><br>shokugeki is everything koufuku should've been</br></br></br>  <br> It didn't even get 12 episodes. </br>  one of Dogakobo's more finer works  <br>Shokugeki is about making food, koufuku is about enjoying food, 2 different subjects.</br>  <br>I was bored, period.</br>  <br>Why must you tease me so.<br>No more best girl.</br></br>  <br>This, the comedy was pretty fun.<br><br><br>Makes you wonder if the Sequel is gonna get an anime.</br></br></br></br>  aesthetica of a rogue hero, anyone?  Twintails certainly deserves one with a better studio and Tatsuya Katou on music to keep up with the source material. Aika was just amazing in this scene.    I know it flopped horribly, but I still want one  <br>It had little to no budget but it was fun.</br>      <br>After that ending, I really don't see how a second season could be anything but shit</br>  <br>I don't know why they did it. Should have just followed the manga. Rest of the series was good though/ Liked the soundtrack a lot</br>   S2 never <br><br>I've come to peace with this. Like coming to peace with the death of a father, or a diagnosis of a terminal illness.</br></br>  <br>well</br>  <br>Fucking this</br>  <br>But... Code Geass had a second season<br><br><br>And thats just a OVA between the two seasons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and it even sold around 4k-5k band</br>  Claymore.  Twintails and Mondaiji      <br>Came here to post this</br>    This and Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita  <br>Let me remind you : if this gets sequel, she won't be in it.</br>  <br>THIS. the next arc after after anime really good. also that crazy Izayoi flashback</br>  <br>Fair enough. Switch second season for sequel.</br>  <br>But the LNfags said she came back in the latest novel during its airing.</br>  <br>Will never happen ;_;</br>  I loved Kawaisou  Accel World  Oda Nobuna no Yabou    <br>I need to re-watch this now that I actually know some basic Sengoku Jidai history.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br>Can't even remember what happened.<br><br>I should just watch S1 again; there's my S2.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This so much. I want it badly</br>  Well, not a second season since it had one, but we'll never see an adaptation of the rest of this.  Shinketsui no Tsunami wa Iori<br><br>probably my 10/10 for 2013, a shame it didn't sell well</br></br>  <br>It makes me so sad. That damn show was it's AOTY.<br><br>That said, we all know that pic related won't either.</br></br></br>  The harem aspect was underwhelming and totally unnecessary, but the comedy was still great.<br>Also would you let yourself get sodomized for Chocolat's entertainment? <br>[spoiler ERABE [/spoiler]</br></br>  <br> we all know that pic related won't <br><br>There is a God after all.</br></br></br>  Just finished season 2 of Knights of Sidonia and absolutely loved it. Hoping for a season 3, but in the meantime I will be reading the manga from beginning to end.  I would like to hear more opinions on the anime/manga  the anime isnt really all that great once you read the manga.<br><br>Niheis art is just so fucking awesome, and the CGI is just meh.<br><br>Even the action-scenes are so much more dynamic in still-frames than in the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No S3. Flopped in Japan.</br>  <br>Well, at least we got some baller figs out of it<br>That's all I care about</br></br>  <br>Nihei's pacing is quite terrible. Anime fixed that at certain level.<br><br>The anime just lacks of horror stuffs and Imperialism Japan style uniforms.</br></br></br>  <br> 5k for a CG show <br> flopped <br>Pls anon.</br></br></br>  Who wants to buy this?  <br>I liked the manga more, but the anime is good as well. I think the haremshit is kind of overdone (more obvious in the anime) and it doesn't really add anything to the story or to the characters. With the latest developments in the manga I hope there won't be as much time for that sort of shit.</br>    Best blowfish.  <br>Did they fuck?<br>You know, the MC and the tranny.</br></br>  Why the Lightining sisters dont use magic and gunblades?  <br>...<br>fuck.</br></br>  <br> yfw tsumugi is literally a dick <br><br> Fuck why does she look sexy  , fucking warframe did this </br></br></br>  <br>Because itlooks like shes wearing a fancy dress.</br>  <br>Can she self destruct and destroy Sidonia when she reaches critical butthurt mass?</br>  <br>I am up to chapter 54 and MC and Izana didn't fuck as far as I can see</br>  <br>because.....fuck...she is my fetish now</br>    <br>Of course.</br>  <br>spoiler alert that is how the series ends</br>  S1 was superior in every single way, S2 dropped the ball but the last couple of episodes were a joy to watch.<br><br>That beautiful setting wasted on romance shenanigans, My heart bleeds.</br></br>  <br>Soo.... no?<br><br><br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; </br></br></br></br>  <br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; <br>I want summer to go and stay go</br></br>  <br>I feel with what the did in S1 and S2 they could easily wrap it up with a final season S3 <br><br><br>I'm so fucking mad about that...I just imagine it is some harem mushy stuff, but still..</br></br></br></br>  <br> he thinks summer is real <br>Confirmed new as fuck</br></br>  <br>10k first season. Why do you think they got an original ending plug in S2?</br>  <br>You are for a ride on who fucks whom.</br>  <br><br>for MANY DAYS</br></br>  <br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; <br>Confirmed new as fuck.</br></br>  <br>I didn't make that post, retard.<br>I see you haven't yet grasped the concept of anonymity.<br>Don't worry, you'll get there.</br></br></br>  Would just weaponizing the EnaJiro instead of using her to make Smoogy prevent the story from flopping like it did?  <br>Pretty much this. I still liked it though, but it could have been so much better, shit.</br>  <br>I doubt it's capable of that, in the end the incredible sturdiness of Gauna comes from their true bodies, not the placenta. If it all came down to placenta Sidonia could chuck those planet-destroying missiles at every Gauna they run across and give 0 fucks.</br>  <br>Moshi moshi?</br>    <br>I would totally watch that version of the show.<br>All space explosions all the time.<br>Probably be a shit manga though.</br></br></br>    <br>Best daki.</br>   tfw no penis waifu     <br> mfw </br>  <br>Nah, all space explosions wouldn't work for too long, I think showing the way people live when their entire civilization is on a spaceship has quite a bit of potential. My issues with the haremshit is that it doesn't fit the themes/motifs, doesn't advance the story and doesn't even really build up the characters. It's there just to be there. For instance I think the romance when Hoshijiro and Nagate were stranded fit very well with what Sidonia is about, but a lot of the other shit doesn't take advantage of the setting at all and just dilutes it in the end. There needs to be some counterbalance to the explosions and that could be SoL, but it should've been done much better.</br>    <br>Where the booze at nigga?</br>  <br>That's sound reasoning.<br>I think showing the Sidonia settling into colonization after the Gauna threat is eliminated or at least pushed back could be an interesting and setting appropriate counterbalance. But maybe I just want to see how long until the colonies would degenerate into Borderlands death worlds.</br></br>  <br>Choo choo!</br>  <br>Just got to that chapter...I vomited</br>  <br>yup..abandon ship</br>  <br>aaannnddd suddenly I don't want a S3...</br>  <br>The chapter that Smoogy is  kill  ?</br>  <br>nope...pic related</br>  TFW doing it with Tsumugi would sound like this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9ON<wbr>7KuzCl_s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>How much advanced is the story in the manga compared to the anime? I want to start reading it but I don't know if better wait until there's more content.</br>  <br> but I don't know if better wait until there's more content. <br>you've got 75 chapters worth of content</br></br>  <br>read it, but skip chapter 63</br>  <br>Yeah, but I don't want to leave the story at the same point as the anime while waiting for new chapters<br><br><br>Now I'll have to read it to check that chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But then you wouldn't get the most out of chapter 66.</br>  <br> Smoogy is kill <br>That happens? The day is saved!</br></br>  <br>Did I miss something in chapter 66?</br>  <br>Anime is like 2/3 of the way through the current content.<br><br><br>Could be interesting as a spinoff, but a lot of the Sidonia atmosphere hangs on the desperation that inherently comes with the fact that they're always one successful Gauna attack away from being completely wiped out IMO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're lying and you know it. The chimera scene and the scene of Kagate award ceremony lead up to (the possible) season three where Ochai plan is implement and kagate is raise onto a bigger heroic status to raise moral for the incoming war against the giant Gauna colony. Hihei liked the adaption and the studio enjoyed animating SOK. <br><br>A season three is entirely possible.</br></br></br>  <br> MANY DAYS </br>  <br>Do everyone get laid?</br>  <br>Just the MC.<br><br>not any girls, not any monsters, no... just the MC.</br></br></br>  <br> Kagate <br> Ochai <br> Hihei <br> SOK <br>what the fuck am I reading</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sidonia of Kishi, of course.

Any reason for the joint formation flight? No air friction in space. Love it tho  <br> Any reason for the joint formation flight? <br>Not explained in the manga but 2 theories floating around:<br><br>1. Some kind of Hyggs particles resonance that allows for bigger acceleration.<br>2. Guardians can't use their engines at full power alone because of stability / control issues.<br><br>These are just general ideas. Explanations with more details in archive of both /a/ and /m/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks neat. A lot of the people calling the manga hard sci-fi either don't read/watch much sci-fi or haven't thought about it too hard. It speculates about things not commonly considered but Nihei is not trying to make something as plausible as Planetes.</br>  <br>Someone mentioned the center of gravity being at the center of the circle or some shit. I know jack shit about physics.</br>  <br> no director's cut <br><br>That's wrong, both season last episode are director's cut</br></br></br>  S3 was shit. They've managed to go from a good fresh mecha to a cancer sol harem cancer. CG got worse too.   netflix <br><br>Also the show was shit<br><br> CG <br> muh space harem </br></br></br></br></br>  Needs more Samari  <br> S3 was shit.  <br>Thank you kind time traveler for revealing this.</br></br>  <br>Hasn't it sold worse than S1 though?</br>  best girl  <br>How come they couldn't give her that much more reasonable chest in the show?</br>  <br>Much worse.</br>  Why is she so  beautiful? <br><br><br>It still seems to be selling decently enough, though. It's not bad enough to rule out a third season.</br></br></br>  <br><br> fuck the clone of your crush who rejected you 100 year ago <br><br>I'm not sure I've read up to this (last I read was collecting the robot off the planet), but does he finally know that he's a clone by this stage or did some mutual attraction develop between them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He seems aware that penis-chan is 'that girl I was into but got eaten, then a alien clone of her was found and finally mutated into a large combat space penis, who is also attracted to me'. Not sure if Tsugimi knows most of how she came to be, at least seems to know what the feelings are.</br></br>  <br> but does he finally know that he's a clone <br>She tells him right before that he's a genetically modified clone of Hiroki and that they (Kobayashi, Hiroki, Lala and Ochiai) go way back. Exactly how much she tells him isn't clear since it's just a few pages in the manga. Nagate says she "told him everything" but that's hardly reliable.</br></br>  <br><br>Arrive at desto as a group I guess?<br><br>They should be traveling huge distances, grouped together they won't land as spread out, or at least if there's an engine fail don't get stranded. Working together won't increase the speed unless there's some combo magic with the magic particles.</br></br></br></br>  <br> then a alien clone of her was found and finally mutated into a large combat space penis <br>Tsumugi isn't a Hoshijiro clone. She is the daughter of a Hoshijiro clone.</br></br>  <br> finally mutated into a large combat space penis <br>But that's completely wrong. Tsumugi isn't mutated EnaJiro, she's actually EnaJiro's daughter, as in somebody intentionally impregnated the Gauna-made clone of Hoshijiro and the child was a chimera, namely Tsumugi.</br></br>  <br><br>Guess I'll have to read up and find out why he'd even fuck her at this point, considering the sizable harem he already has, that's already tried to make moves on him.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So after the events of S2, there's now 2 EnaJiro's in Ochiai's lab? Not sure why but I just assumed he fucked it and then it mutated because space magic.</br></br></br>  <br>There's one in Ochiai's possession (at least until he takes over Kanata's body) and one with Toha.</br>  <br>None of the harem members really made a move as direct and straightforward as Kobayashi though. Nagate is dense as fuck, subtlety won't work.</br>  DIRECTOR's cut when???  <br>EnaJiro (first one) is in Ochiai's possession, BeniJiro (from Benisuzume) is locked up in a crate at Toha according to the manga.</br>  Can anyone point me towards the MT ftp? That whole revival project appears to be dead, but I'd like to DL KoS.  <br><br>Ignore me, found it and it's been revamped well.</br></br>  <br>If BeniJiro dies in that box, will she become the Box Ghost?</br>  <br>Wait, she doesn't have the cowtitumors from the show.</br>  <br>haha agreed he probably thinks that is the way you act around people you "like"</br>  And if you don't like?  <br>constantly apologizing for absolutely no reason probably</br>  <br>Not sure if her art appeal is suppose to be a trap, even tough she is technically a girl now, or just vaguely tomboyish even with the cow tumors that are sometimes there sometimes not</br>  <br>Ain't Izanas that big in the manga?</br>  <br>Netflix</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>only sometimes</br>  <br>Nice.</br>   We will never see Brozana again   <br>Hey, she's bro as fuck in the manga. Always has been.</br>  <br>doesn't count</br>  <br>Why doesn't it count?</br>  <br>You know why.</br>  <br>If I did I wouldn't be asking.</br>  Reminder that Izana is the only person Tanikaze cares about as much as rice balls.  Have you not been paying attention?  <br><br> Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br> Hoshijiro likes him because he rescued her and drank her piss. <br> Yuhata just likes him because he's famous. <br> Kobayashi loved his "grandfather" <br> Samari likes his skills and is a drunk <br> Izana cared about him since the beginning like a bro and later as a girl. <br><br>To sum up, everyone is a bitch except Izana, best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Glad the truth is finally being seen.  <br> Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br>You really should change this part of the pasta.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br>It's likely more than that at this point in the manga.</br></br>  <br>best grill</br>  <br> You will never see the sights of Sidonia with Riceball-chan </br>  Why is the first opening so good?  <br>Because Medieval Scape Hitler Boner.</br>  Just caught up to 75.<br><br>Captains personality changes a bit after fucking Nagate, and holy shit the volume of resources and time to produce things is out of whack. They shit out so many ships and pilots it's not funny. Pacing really feels fast after about c60.</br></br>  <br>*Space<br> What the fuck am I that drunk alreadyu </br></br>  <br>You can feel Nihei's grip on what makes Sidonia cool slip. As it gets more generic /m/ and more moe space penis, it gets less interesting.</br>  <br>Because Angela:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aoE<wbr>vKKAhSqQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>nice</br>  <br><br>Nagate isn't that fucking stupid, jesus. He's dense but not an idiot. He had no trouble acknowledging he liked Hoshijiro.<br><br>If you think the scene came out of nowhere that's the fault of Nihei's writing, not Nagate's emotional intelligence.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think that might be true.<br><br>The creepy mystery and exploration filters out, in favour of redshirts dying to gauna, new tech at impossible rates etc. Ochiai was a bit wasted.
