Please spoil me if there's NTR shit.     <br> I hope there is not anon. </br>    This is just painful to read<br> tfw no cutie tomboy friend ;_; </br>  <br>What is this? A new and promising manga that has just started and is being scanlated properly?<br><br> I must be dreaming.  don't wake me up </br></br></br>  <br>You had to ruin it with your /r9k/ bullshit</br>  Last one I got. Hoping we would get more of this.  <br> properly <br> 640x958 <br>What year are you from?</br></br></br>  <br> 10 chapters   10 pages </br>  <br>Sorry anon. Not having a tomboy friend hit me hard.<br><br>Here is an upscaled version<br><br>We just can't have good things can't we?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Good Translation and typesetting is all I need, really. I don't get the need for a big size, a good reader can zoom it perfectly fine, and I read on my Laptop anyway.<br><br><br><br> I knew 10 chapters at once was too much, damn it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm failry certain this artist did the porn doujin about the bully girl and the tall boyfriend.  <br> Yeah sorry. <br>That phrase will never be the same to me.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you check it?</br>  <br>Thank you anon, you made my day.</br>  My fucking google search leads me to some korean sites  <br>much obliged kind anon.</br>  <br>It should give you the title at least.<br><br> It's Tomo-chan ha Onna no ko! by the way. </br></br></br>  <br>Try using the other images anon, it worked for me.</br>  Why are people encouraging the use of google reverse image instead of giving source? Should be trying to stop people from using the botnet not encouraging it.  <br> being this much of a douche <br>You know you read the entire thing thanks to OP.</br></br>  <br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/t<wbr>omochan/0011.html</wbr></br>  <br>/g/ pls, our elitism is more important than the escalating botnet.</br>    <br><br> You had ten pages, the first one did the same to me but what happens to all the others?<br> This kind of thing is the reason why giving sauce is not the answer<br><br><br><br> No. In this board we frown upon spoon feeding, take your Skynet fobia to /tv/ or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Giving fish and teaching to fish etc.</br>  Well, at least from this cover everyone's in a pair.  <br>Get Chrome or an add on, right click any picture and click number 10 down. Always.</br>  <br>Because if you dont learn how to find sources on your own you'll continue to be a blight in your family tree.</br>  <br>because "sauce" ruined nearly EVERY thread on 4chan in its early days and triggered an OCD-based crackdown that effects us to this day.<br><br>Just hit the fucking arrow man.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127348591 <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127348573 <br>I understand not wanting to shit the board up with casuals but there is so much content out there that even me who has 8tb of anime 400gb of doujins almost every translated VN etc still needs source sometimes.<br><br><br>People wouldn't ask for sauce if people gave it in the first place. don't have much problem with not giving source for animated material but manga/doujin is another story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tomboy <br> big tits <br><br>They blew it.</br></br></br>  <br>I always try to put the source in the filename.</br>  <br>Finding the source is so fucking easy, faggot.</br>  <br>If google doesn't help you, I will.<br>So that is not an excuse.<br><br>People should be capable of finding their own resources. We don't have a sticky explaining how to torrent anime either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're the minority</br>  Wow, I hope this manga get this intense.  <br>Look faggot, if you can google it and it gives you the title (in any language), i'm not giving you the source. Deal with it.</br>  <br>This. <br><br>Ever since we've received built in image searching there is no excuse to shit up a board with cries for a source without trying it first. If it really doesn't work then ask and remind anon that image search brings nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>I love this artist</br>  <br> reverse trap/tomboy with fang in spats going dere dere <br>I needed this. Thanks OP.</br></br>  So I'm gonna be That Guy and ask<br>are people going to translate the entire thing?<br><br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/t<wbr>omochan/<br>This really is the greatest thing ever</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>When will she be like this?</br>  So what is this manga called?  <br>Using Google and giving source are both equally heinous crimes, but until Startpage start offering image search there's not a lot of choice.</br>  <br>Boku no Pico.</br>  <br> Yeah, sorry </br>  <br>The answer to your question is literally two posts above yours</br>   the big breasts make him realize she's a she   <br>Do you have more?</br>  http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>1774701</wbr>  <br> 84 pages <br><br>Sweet.</br></br></br>   the joy of sharing something you like with your kindred spirits <br>I found the second greatest thing. Thanks /a/.</br>  <br> implying that's not the best thing ever <br>Is your dick broken or something?</br></br>  <br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/t<wbr>omochan/0001.html</wbr></br>  Man, I like this artist.  <br>Nobody ask for a link, just the name of the thing.</br>  WAIRUDO NO KIMI<br><br> if you know this, s2 never </br></br>  <br>What a fucking faggot</br>  Are these two siblings?   how about you stop wearing a skirt? <br>Oh god, man, the words you say.</br>   she takes off spats <br> he is so disgusted he can't even look at her <br>Good taste my boy.</br></br>  <br>Never stop believing.<br> ;_; </br></br>  <br> WAIRUDO <br>That's immediately what came to mind when I read that part.<br><br><br> that face </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least show that you put some amount of effort into finding it yourself and being independent and not completely reliant on people to do things for you and if you really cannot find it, some anons will definitely help you.<br><br>The reluctance to give sauce is just a barrier to entry and an encouragement to not be a lazy asshole. It will be better for you if you try to find it yourself anyway. It isn't /a/ being elitist, but more like /a/ actually caring about the health of the community.<br><br>I mean, some people are assholes on both ends as well since you can easily just complain<br> I only got korean and chinese websites <br>without having actually done the searching and take advantage of the people that offer help, but I don't see that very often.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, google it. It's not difficult.</br>  <br>Right? She's got fangs, busty and incredibly cool (strong) to other girls. It's like Riko if she's in a highschool and had a bigger bust, also she's with a Nagi who's even denser.<br><br>Fuck, man, this manga is so good.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently, my dick doesn't have shit taste.</br>  <br>What?</br>  I hope there's no rape~  <br>If you take big boobs out of tomboys all that is left is just a boy anon.<br>A BOY</br></br>  Karate senpai a cute  <br>A boy that we can impregnate. Perfect.</br>  <br>Fluffy</br>  <br>That's the whole point of tomboys.<br>Boys with vaginas.</br></br>  <br>I like Tomo, but aren't tomboys technically just girls who's interested in boyish activities? Tomboy doesn't necessitate any girl-ish physique.</br>  <br>NTR incoming</br>  <br>Are you stupid? if someone doesn't understand korean or jap or any other language what is he gonna get from a google search?</br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>I hate that blonde already. I don't even now nipponese.</br>  <br>What the heck?</br>  <br> People wouldn't ask for sauce if people gave it in the first place. <br><br>This is provably wrong. There are more than a few instances where the sauce is in the same post, thread, or filename. Or can't even do something like search based on character names.</br></br></br>  <br> Royal <br>Are you still translating that manga about cock-hungry middle school girls?</br></br>    <br>Google translate, my friend. Or try the other pages.</br>  <br> provably </br>  <br>If you get the Korean title, you can go to the Korean wikipedia, enter that title and then switch to either English or, if that doesn't work, to Japanese and then work with that.<br>Most databases have the Japanese title as well so you should find it with that.<br><br>Don't be such a useless retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a fucking homosexual<br><br> thinks tomboys aren't mainly personality and bodytype second <br> he doesn't like busty tomboy onee-sans </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he isn't just living in the database.</br></br>  <br>A tanned, flat chested tomboy with an athletic physique and short black hair is gods gift to man.</br>  <br>Tomboy isn't a body archetype like loli. They don't all have to have short hair or be ultra muscular. It is a personality thing.<br><br>There are really girly-looking tomboy characters too you know.</br></br></br>  <br>When did I say that a tomboy is a bodytype?<br>I just said that a tomboy with big tits is garbage.</br></br>  <br>You implied it.<br><br>You are not a very smart man if you don't understand your own implications.</br></br></br>  <br>And if there isn't the Korean wiki page? and if I can't fucking tell what the name is because it's spelt in 3 ways in Korean and I don't understand it? <br><br><br> google translate  <br>You can't be serious.<br><br>I'm all in for not giving source for anime and vn but manga is not the same. This is not being elitist, this is being a cunt for no reason, especially with this retarded idea of not giving the source if you can find it another language.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>he has his own girl though. </br></br></br>  <br> tomboy with big tits is garbage <br>Bullshit.<br><br>It isn't perfect, but it definitely isn't garbage.</br></br></br></br>  Just don't reply to him, it only ruins the thread about a potentially great manga.  <br>No, you just made that up because either you don't know how to read or you don't have a point.</br>  Under 15 y/o tomboys = <br>Around 15-19 tomboys = Big boobs but not gigantic<br>Above 19 tomboys = HUGE BOOBS HUGE I SAID<br> implying this isn't the best </br></br></br>  <br>Shit nigga, same artist? <br><br>Out of three doujin he make, two are so fucking sweet. That reverse bully and incest one are fucking good.</br></br></br>  <br>If you can't reasonably figure out the title, and provide a screenshot of your 2 google searches (thumbnail and full image) then there'll be plenty of people willing to help you.<br>In the case of this manga, there were English results so that falls flat.</br></br>  <br>Reminds me a series on sadpanda.

I've seen so many people praise KyoAni as the pinnacle of anime. Though content wise these have been adapting series with mediocre writing. Animation wise they look appealing but it isn't considered good animation because it mostly backgrounds, shot with massive amounts of light everywhere. And it's known that KyoAni have below average production values. Now they do have a few gems such as Haruhi, Disappearance Movie, Full Metal Panic especially Fumoffu, and Hyouka which can be subjective because the story is really boring depending on the person. However they do adapt a lot of mediocre series that have terrible writing in it.<br><br>Now I'm not saying KyoAni is a bad Studio because they are far from it, but why do some people think they are the best Studio? If you look at their content it says otherwise.</br></br>  Because plebs like digital filters and over-animated turd.  <br>Just imagine how would look Yahari's last episode of KyoAni had animated it.</br>  <br>Shit?<br>Yahari season 2 is already better animated than anything KyoAni ever made.</br></br>  Because Clannad and Haruhi  <br>Kyani is a good studio, not my favourite but still. <br>Like comedy show.</br></br>  <br>No it is not. Kyoani doesn't have one thing, creativity.</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  <br>Yahari have sakuga animators.<br>KyoAni doesn't.</br></br>  <br> why do some people think they are the best Studio <br>It's not. Ufotable is.</br></br>  <br> over-animated </br>  <br>Why are the eyes so suck before 2008 ?</br>  <br>Look at this and tell me it isn't over-animated.</br>  <br> Why Do Some People Like Things I Don't Like: The Thread </br>  <br> Ufotable <br>Ufotable is easily the most over-rated studio, yes.</br></br>  They are the Nintendo of /a/.  <br>go back to your cancer thread yaharifag</br>  Oh boy another studio war thread. <br>Can't wait for all the "lol kyoanus moeshit" shitpost.</br>  Why are half the posts in this thread, including the OP, written like it was an ESL at the keyboard?  <br>how were they allowed to get away with that 2005 face</br>  <br><br> animation in an animated medium is bad </br></br>  Nichijou is conveniently missing from your image and argument, so that's why you don't know.  <br>Because Key.</br>  <br>Keyshit designs.</br>  <br>This should be the norm, instead shitty studios skip frames and put shitty in between animation and people think it's actually acceptable.</br>  <br>You're over-retarded</br>  <br>Its Key shit, what do you expect? They fixed the faces by now, but overall still same shit.<br><br>Charlotte by PA Works this season is another revival of that cancer. Thanks God KyoAni stopped whoring themself to them.<br><br>Also, if you think thats ugly - see Higurashi.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's distracting from the most important element of any storytelling medium, the story.</br>  <br>It isn't over-animated.</br>  <br>The only bad thing I see is some poor movement of the characters relative to the background early on when she starts running.</br>  <br> over-animated <br>god damn you're retarded</br></br>  <br>It's not the work of the animators to fix shitty scripts</br>  <br>What about Full Metal Panic though? It's in 2003 and still has good animated eyes.</br>  They're not even the best modern studio.  <br>Why are you even watching anime in the first place? Read the LNs or manga if you don't like pictures moving, faggot.</br>  <br>Holy shit, you're too much of a pleb for LN adaptations about high schoolers playing instruments. I didn't think this was possible.</br>  <br>I wonder where they took the photo shoots for this scene.</br>  <br>That's like saying literature would be better as powerpoint slides of the plot and themes in bulletpoints because prose is distracting.</br>  <br>meh, $hinbo's gimmicky animation style gets old quite fast</br>  <br> before 2008 <br>K-On! eyes aren't better. Only good eyes KyoAni ever produced are Hyouka and now Euphonium.</br></br>  <br> anime <br> storytelling medium <br><br>Top b8</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't dislike animation.<br>I hate when it's done poorly and unbalanced.</br></br>  <br> I'm not trying shitpost or anything <br>Yes you are.</br></br>  <br>Because they didn't have a style that made money back then. Keyshit gave them money so they keep doing that even in other anime (see haruhi 2006) after that k-on was the one who made money so they kept doing that kind of designs after that (see harui 2009 or hyouka) <br>Amagi and Hibike are dfiferent though.</br></br>  <br>They did.<br>KyoAni traces photo.</br></br>  <br>Then you must love KyoAni, they rarely do it poorly and always retain the same quality all around their series.</br>  <br>Literally everything is better than am I kawaii uguu. Fucking Aku no Hana's faces were still better than that.</br>  <br>Its Uji, the small town Kyoto Animation itself is located. If you paid attention Hibike school is "KitaUJI", its located in same time.<br><br>Thats one of main reasons KyoAni picked about this novel in the first place - since its written by local about the area they work and live.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how that one would look with one of those 60fps interpolators.</br>  <br>Some people say that KyoAni anime have bad writing. I disagree, they're only simple, and being simple doesn't make something bad. <br>Yesterday I was watching Sora no Woto and started to think about what would be if it had a more simple writing, without those events, like Kanata's fever in episode 3 to deliver exposition. Regularly anime writing have plenty of well know events and situations, but KyoAni have the capacity to make these things more subtle, hence the accusations about nothing happening towards some shows.</br></br>  <br>I thought Tamako did pretty well in that department.</br>  <br> Euphonium <br>Too bad they fucked up on the cheeks with that pinkish dot shit. Looks like they have cancer.</br></br>  <br> shit isn't just flapping mouths, slow pans behind the heads and detail shots of the face <br> has more than once scene and 3 shots per minute <br> over-animated <br><br>Over-animated sounds like an oxymoron anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  HARUHI S3<br>FULL METAL PANIC S3<br><br>NEVER<br>EVER!<br><br>NEVER <br>EVER!<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>Thanks for your attention.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> done poorly <br>That was quite well done, though.<br><br><br>I think I would have some sort of seizure trying to watch it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the animation professors I had back in college was ex-Disney, he was a 2D animator who worked on a lot of their films for years and years. He started there in the early '80s when Bluth still worked at Disney, and he hated Bluth. He distinctly remembers Don Bluth having a group of friends/followers in a sort of clique in the animation department, who were very haughty and unpleasant to everybody else. The group also liked to 'outdo' each other with their animation, trying to trump each other with intricacy and stuff. The whole group left with Bluth when he did.<br><br>My prof still wanted to give him a chance and went to see Secret Of NIMH in theaters when it came out, but he walked out after about ten minutes. His reason: "The damn crow wouldn't stop moving". He always stressed how there was a time and place for certain animation and how animators needed to know when to NOT animate, and Bluth's over-animation of everything drove him crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>There is some videos when you see where Kyoani took their photos. <br>There is one for Hibike.</br></br>  <br>You're like that guy who calls people tryhards if they put any amount of effort into something.</br>  <br>Complaining about "moeshit" in Kyoani anime is old, the new hotness is shitposting about "forced drama" and "forced animation".</br>  <br>Good old MS Paint VNs.</br>  <br>Your teacher tastes in animation don't mean shit in the grand scheme of things.</br>  <br>Buy a book faggot. Story shouldn't be the only reason to watch something animated. Unless you are idiot.</br>  KyoAni's animation is like Micheal Bay's movie.<br>KyoAni is trying too hard to make everything look pretty and fluid.<br>But when you made everything special, nothing is special.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2TH<wbr>Vvshvq0Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  The only thing I would call "forced animation" or "over-animation" were some of Nichijou's gags.  <br>Ufotable is like Michael bay, all filters and action.<br>Kyoani is like Nolan, all filters and PRETENTIOUS storytelling.</br></br>  <br> But when you made everything special, nothing is special. <br>The struggle is real... <br>So the right thing to do is only do well one and another scene and let everything else look sakuga?</br></br></br>  <br>Nichijou has a lot visual gags... so why would you want to make them worse?</br>  <br>Sounds like he felt slighted somehow and had to make up something to complain about.</br>  <br> let everything else look sakuga <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>I agree with Ufotable-Bay. I don't agree with KyoAni-Nolan - Nolan's pretentiousness (which is pretty minor compared to a lot of other filmmakers, to be honest) is in his plots' sense of self-importance, not really his style, and KyoAni's plots don't really pretend to be important.</br>  <br>Gee, it's almost like the point of most of the gags in Nichijou was to make simple, mundane things be so over-the-top that it was ridiculous</br>  <br> KyoAni <br> Pretentious storytelling <br><br>What? Was K-On, Amagi or Nichijou too complex for your little brain that you need to call them pretentious?</br></br></br></br>  <br> pretentious <br>Outside of perhaps Hyouka, I don't see how anything done recently by KyoAni could be labelled pretentious.</br></br>  <br>KyoAni`s difference from other studios is - they love what they do. Animation, characters, stories they do.<br><br>Others just forced to slave work on whatever given to them not giving a fucks and if possible pushing it all on north korean slaves.<br><br>So no, from begining, KyoAni is the antipod to the "hollywood" like Tokyo anime industry.<br><br>They are rural, indie "we do what we want!" studio. Also success made them grow to one of biggest studios in industry.<br><br>Madhouse can make 1 anime they like in X years, doing shit rest of time (not to forget 7 years of hand drawn animation!!). KyoAni can do it every season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember everyone. <br><br><br>Inability to handle even minor amounts of sensory stimulation is a common trait of autism. It's why so many autists have to keep the walls of their rooms completely blank.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani <br> Pretentious storytelling <br>You w0t</br></br></br>  They are consistent in terms of quality.<br>And they have cute girls.<br>Not my personal favorite but if it has the Kyoani name I'll most likely watch it.</br></br>  <br>But Hyouka was pretty straighforward</br>  <br>I personally think it's the expressions that moves my heart. It's subtle, yet it can makes me feel how exactly the character feels currently. <br><br>Even in K-ON, for example, when they first go to the stage, you can feel how the audiences below are very silent and although the HTT girls are smiling, it's apparent that all of them looks pretty nervous.<br><br>They don't need to make the girls saying/monologuing "I-I-I'm nervous, doushio?" on the stage. You can FEEL it from the atmosphere and their subtle expressions (although they are keeping their smiles).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one I'd call pretentious is Hibike, but even that is more melodramatic than anything.</br>  <br> we do what we want <br> Nothing but LN adaptations and slice of life the two biggest trends in the market right now <br><br>Yeah, sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The people who like a majority of Kyoto Animation shows probably had little to no friends growing up. Now there's this animation studio with high production values releasing highschool sol content that these lonely people can self insert into. They are compensating for their own bad memories and history by watching others live what they perceive as an ideal fantasy.</br>  <br>I totally agree. Here's another example.</br>  <br>yeah I know, but similarly to how Hachiman's struggles are labelled as pretentious by some, I wouldn't be surprised if they would apply the same logic to Oreki's.</br>  Why is Nichijou left out.<br><br><br><br> over-animated <br> It's distracting from the most important element of any storytelling medium, the story. <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it pretentious?</br>  <br> they love what they do <br>More like they loved getting paid.</br></br>  <br>Nice projection buddy</br>  <br>The waifu animators at KyoAni hated making FMP.<br><br>They make no FMP or similar shows no more and do animate their cute daugtherus instead. Living a life and not giving a fucks (should have felt good telling Key and Kadokawa to fuck off).</br></br></br>  <br>Pretentious animation </br>  <br>Just having more drama than usual, and I found most of the drama unbelievable or way too exaggerated.</br>  <br>Animator Expo is for animators to jerk off to their animation skill so it's okay here.</br>  <br>They were doing that before the trends kicked in.</br>  <br>How can animation be pretentious?</br>  <br>So how close was I to perfectly describing your life?</br>  <br>KyoAni did great disservice to anime, but proving VN adaptations can be popular.<br><br>Thankfully they moved on from that shit, but neverless that did great harm and effects of it continue until now.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch Ping Pong, Tatami Galaxy, Mononoke, House of Dead Leaves etc.</br>  <br>I don't see what is pretentious about Hibike.<br><br>I agree with the melodrama to some extent, and to be honest I'm mildly disappointed about the last few episodes too. The first ~8 episodes did a very good job of showing a rather somber highschool life. Of course, that isn't to suggest there wasn't any drama, but most of it was handled pretty well without any unnecessary reactions by any of the cast.<br><br>A good example would be in episode 8 with Hazuki. Instead of this blowing up into a large issue, they were still able to get the impact of her exchange with Shu1 across to the viewer. I thought that perhaps Midori's reaction in ep 9 was a bit farfetched, but even that was cooled down by something around the lines of Kumiko and Midori realizing that Hazuki would rather bottle up her emotions and allow them to dissipate than drag others into the conflict.<br><br>The drama I didn't like was between Kaori and Ribbons. The way Kaori is handled is rather good, but Ribbons escalates the conflict into something much more dramatic than it needed to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's almost as if it was an exposition for animation.</br></br>  <br> Nichijou <br> Over-animated <br>That's still lightyears behind golden era. If anything, the quality in Nichijou should be status quo today since technology makes it possible to cut a fuckload of corners in production but since the industry is a rat race with dozens of studios constantly working on shit that's why we get flounder mouthflaps in 95% of anime released annually.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe with the SoL fad, but Haruhi aired alongside stuff like ZnT and Shana</br>  <br>Just because it's different doesn't mean it's pretentious. Animation can't pretend to be anything other than animation.</br>  <br>The drama is more unbelievable than Chuunibyou?<br><br> Actually Hibike was one of my favorite KyoAni. Well, the atmosphere is pretty exhausting but I can relate since I've felt how it feels being a freshman in a competitive strict school, with everyone's interactions feel pretty distant.  </br></br></br>  <br> House of Dead Leaves </br>  <br>Animation can "pretend" to be "artistic", when it goes for specific visual style over the others that can do it just as well for no purpose.<br><br>The definition of abstract, absurd, distorted and psychodelic is pretentious.</br></br></br>  <br> House of Dead Leaves <br>That would be the weirdest animation style mash-up of all time.</br></br>  <br>If anything proving LN adaptions to be an avenue caused a billion times more damage than VN adaptions. VNs are at least a completely product or end on a note which has a "safe" stopping point for a season, while LNs are a fucking mess because they go on forever and nobody has a damned clue where to end the season at so you get horrifically bad pacing and cliffhanger endings up the ass.</br>  <br>The drama in the first season was handled pretty well even if it kinda came out of nowhere.<br><br>The least we talk about S2 the better...</br></br></br>  <br>B-but KyoAni made Haruhi, Lucky Star, Clannad, K-On, and Chuunibyou.T-they are best studio for giving us best girls and animus. Y u so med about god-tier animus in history? Just look at them.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was kind of stretching the word pretentious but it is mostly melodrama.<br>The only drama I had a problem with is Kumiko's recent problems with playing a music piece and Reina's entire character, who comes off as a complete Mary Sue at times.<br><br><br>I thought the whole depression thing and trying to run away from problems was pretty believable, though the last couple episodes in the first season felt a lot of different than the rest of the episodes before it and I didn't like it.<br>I don't remember anything from Ren though, honestly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> when it goes for specific visual style over the others that can do it just as well for no purpose <br><br>The purpose is to differentiate itself from other animated works. If you try to read into it deeper than this, then it's you who's being pretentious, not the animation.</br></br></br>  I'm <br><br><br>Ah, I agree about Ribbon, though. How she just cry loudly after the selection feels exaggerrated.</br></br></br>  <br> Animation can "pretend" to be "artistic", when it goes for specific visual style over the others that can do it just as well for no purpose. <br>But anon, if multiple visual styles would do just as well, you will always be picking a specific one over the others.</br></br>  <br> Bitch and moan when anime adaption takes liberties with the manga's artstyle <br> Call an adaption pretentious because it actually does faithfully adapts the source material's artstyle <br>What the fuck do you want</br></br></br>  <br>They make "cute girls" that appeal to those who like Kyoani.</br>  <br>LN adaptations were done successfully way before KyoAni. They were done forever, also now market share of them is greatly increased.<br><br>VNs are not a complete product - its in 99% shitty mess of mastrubatory (and i dont mean erotic), and 1% just things that could have been decent books if were done by proper writers instead of hacks that have no idea about story composition and litterature principes.<br><br>LNs on other hand, were actually big improvement for anime at first - since majority anime being manga adaptations, and manga due format being quite limited in terms of storytelling and depth. LNs were just better suited for longer, more intricate stories and settings.<br><br>So the problem is not LNs themselves, but the fact that Kadokawa and Bunco instead of adapting LNs with good stories, churn out generic "boy gets into magic academy and runs into girl" shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The purpose is to differentiate itself from other animated works. <br>Thats the definition of pretentious.<br> characterized by assumption of dignity or importance, especially when exaggerated or undeserved: </br></br></br>  <br> Good <br> LNs <br><br>No such thing</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nolan makes actual good movies though.</br></br>  <br>Sure is massive LN bias in here</br>  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br></br>  <br>LNs are ruining the industry.</br>  <br>meant </br>  <br>I wonder how does it feel for the author.<br>Deko, Touka, and Sleepy-chan are anime originals.<br>Satone is the real character that she wrote.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how something like that is necessarily pretentious. There are a lot of experimental shorts with good layers of depth. Obviously that doesn't suggest all of it would have a worthwhile message, but I don't see how it is at all a bad thing for there to be an outlet for young talent to express themselves.<br><br>Something pretentious in anime would be like Ergo Proxy. There is a lot of focus on atmosphere, symbols, etc, but very little actual depth, or any coherent message.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, the father problem also wasn't in the novel.</br>  <br>I don't think differentiating itself equals that. You're the one who's making that connection.</br>  <br>Baccano<br>Bungaku Shōjo<br>Dirty Pair<br>Full Metal Panic!<br>Haruhi Suzumiya<br>Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere<br>Humanity Has Declined<br>Kino's Journey<br>The Legend of the Legendary Heroes<br>Spice and Wolf<br>Slayers<br>Toradora!<br>Welcome to the N.H.K.<br><br>Just to name a few.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sleepy-chan was added in later LNs. So the writer did like the changes.<br><br>VNs and LNs both can be bad or good. It's just that doing an LN is easier. The thing is that the Nips can't write for shit whatever the medium might be. They don't have any literary value in their whole history. I sometimes wish Italians were in charge of anime.</br></br></br>  <br>This doesn't even look good. When she's turning the corner the background animation doesn't even match up. The framing itself doesn't even look good, which isn't animation, but it looks like they just tried to shove as much stupid shit in the frame as possible.</br>  <br>How do you know if Japs have good literature or not if you've never read a Japanese book? Western literature is more notable because Western culture is the dominant culture of the modern world. LN and VN's are aimed otaku and suffer from bad translations most of the time, so you can't generalize it like that.</br>  <br>NHK is a novel, isn't it?</br>  <br><br>these are the people who post on /a/</br></br>  <br>I took Lit 101 and 201, Foreign Lit and Lit history back in college to get through IT. We got some of the presumably best Nip books and they were shit. Like worse than African and Muslim literature shit.</br>  <br>I`d love proper novel adaptations, LNs mostly cant compare to real books at all - but those are really rare.<br><br>Each medium - original, manga, LN`s, brings well needed and good stuff to anime industry.<br><br>VNs and video game adaptations are commercial cancer though. Then again - it does not mean others are except from it: shitload of generic LNs, weak manga and shallow originals proves it.<br><br>Hardest for anime by far is proper novel adaptations (though thats hard for normal movies as well). That much has to do with episodic nature of anime and hardship of executing or omiting narration and descriptions of which is there a lot. Good studio still can do that, making their shows quite nuanced and turning all the depth of the book into visual details and storytelling (rather than just retelling its words).<br><br>LNs are lot easier, since they are lot easier written and dialogue heavy, plus created for more episodic and shorter format.<br><br>Manga is very limited by publishing format - weekly, monthly, bimonthly and limited dialogue/exposition/description: litterally dictating the format of its stories. No matter the talent, storytelling quality drops when you have to pace it through regular chapters and cliffhangers.<br><br>Original shows one one side are breth of fresh air and experiment - on other mostly lack in storytelling and depth of world: since once again, format dictates content and production focus shifts.<br><br>Some studios tried to break out of that cycle by making OAVs or long 45 minute episodes of multiple-movies instead of regular TV shows: but thats exceptions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> VNs and LNs both can be bad or good. <br>Name a good VN and its adaptation. You cant. If you think you can, means your brain had rotten and you`ve become zombie that never read an actual book and thinks badly written otaku shit is acceptable.</br></br>  <br>Is that the Animator Expo with Bahi JD and Hiroyuki Okiura?</br>  <br>http://global.britannica.com/art/Ja<wbr>panese-literature<br><br> Both in quantity and quality, Japanese literature ranks as one of the major literatures of the world, comparable in age, richness, and volume to English literature, though its course of development has been quite dissimilar. The surviving works comprise a literary tradition extending from the 7th century ad to the present; during all this time there was never a “dark age” devoid of literary production. <br><br>Sounds like bullshit to me, faggot.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>You presumably got some Mishima or Kawabata, and if you dislike either of them, you're taste is shit.</br>  <br>Fate Stay Night.</br>  Because this  <br>Yeah, it's the last one he listed.<br><br><br><br><br>I have to agree with this. The problem isn't the medium itself but the way it is used to appeal to the Otaku market makes the majority of adaptations schlockfests. <br><br>If anything, novels are the format that can most successfully be adapted into anime, as the setting and details are all listed for you in the text. <br><br>LoGH is a good example of how well the two mediums can work with eachother (I know LoGH isn't a LN but it's the same sort of idea).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>White Album 2</br></br>  <br>If you want someone to take a bate, least be less obvious.<br><br>Overrated overdramatic (like all VNs) generic soap opera, only rated high by its cancer fans since they dont watch actual television to realize its no difference in anything from what Japanese housewives watch.</br></br></br>  I don't get why people get offended by the term "over-animated". Sure it's a term designed to bait, but there is an actual essence behind the term. Fluid animation is not the be-all end-all of animation, and increasing the number of keyframes in an animation doesn't always make it look better. Although one of the huge uses of limited animation is cost-savings, it can still be used for artistic intentions, and some choppy but stylistic animation can look better than "fluid" animation. I myself am not a fan of the over fluid animation you typically see in amateur shorts since they move the character and camera around so much just to prove that they can fluidly animate that it becomes distracting and hard to follow the motions.  Somebody call the sakuga experts.  <br> especially Fumoffu <br>Opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>All we need are more actual novel adaptations like Tatami Galaxy and LoGH. LN's have always been the realm of otaku pandering shit.</br>  <br> 作画 <br>It just means the frame is animated, fucking tryhards. Throwing in a romanised term like that is pretty pointless. Why stop at 作画 when you could be pretending to know shit and start throwing around terms like 映画撮影、画題、画像処理、etc. etc. etc?</br></br>  <br>Hibike is an actual award winning novel and it's shit. Nips can't into prose.</br>  <br> http://global.britannica.com/art/J<wbr>apanese-literature</wbr> <br>You know that shit doesn't discredit any literature of any civilization right? Even Moors literature is highly regarded according to Britannica. And that was the shittiest Arab works.</br></br>  <br>Why not call it 'forced animation'?</br>  <br>Forced animation is a meme.<br>Over animating is a real thing.</br></br>  <br>So is Twilight. <br><br>Also, the adaptation probably doesn't do the source material justice since KyoAni added unnecessary yuri-pandering shit that wasn't in the actual novel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Raging unadulterated fanboyism that goes back to the days of Haruhi and extremely limited experience with shit beyond the late night anime scene are my best bets. IMO they do the same kind of played out moe school romance anime that pretty much any other studio does except maybe slightly flashier.</br></br>  <br> You know that shit doesn't discredit any literature of any civilization right? <br><br>Exactly, retard. Each civilization has their own merits when it comes to literature. You cannot judge something you aren't familiar with. Japanese literature isn't popular due to it's main characteristics:<br><br> Japanese literature can be difficult to read and understand, because in many ways the written Japanese reflects certain peculiarities of the spoken language. Statements are often ambiguous, omitting as unnecessary the particles of speech which would normally identify words as the subject or object of a sentence, or using colloquial verb forms from a specific region or social class. Special language used to depict gender, age, social status, or regional origins is often the only clue as to who is speaking or being spoken about in a sentence. In many cases the significance of a simple sentence can only be understood by someone who is familiar with the cultural or historical background of the work. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The background image slides around a lot and the blur goes into overdrive around 0:08 I noticed when she turns the corner. They're probably having a hard time lining the photos up exactly or are using the same photo only trying to do some trickery to make it look like it covers more area than it actually does. It's a bit hard to tell exactly because it's really blurry. The actual character animation part isn't half bad though but again a lot of the frame is just so damn blurry it kind of ruins it.</br></br>  <br><br>I noticed nobody ever really complains when people are sucking their dicks in threads and putting down other studios, but try to ask the questions nobody ever wants to ask about Kyoani that threatens to not paint them in an overwhelmingly positive light and it's full on indignation time. The old classic Kyoani fanboy double standard.</br></br>  <br>i call it artificial animation</br>  <br> 2003 was the only good one until Sento <br><br>What went wrong in between</br></br></br>  <br>Because they actually spend the time and effort to do good animation. Unlike most studios (SHAFT) that send their shit out to Worst Korea or China to animate. KyoAni makes sure they have few if any animation mistakes. <br><br>also 9/10 times their anime has very good plot and memorable characters. That's why most of their anime sells extremely well.</br></br></br>  <br>The novels also had Yuri-bait. KyoAni added more het-bait too. And the author on Twitter was pleased so take that as you may.<br><br>But anon you can and should judge everything. I can say for a fact that Italian and Even subsaharian Africans had better 'novels' or prose in general than the Nips and Gooks. The Chinese on the other hand have some notable exceptions.</br></br></br>  <br>So they have the worst fanbase and are universally hated by anyone with taste?</br>  <br><br>Japanese writing nowadays is so bad it's almost it's own in joke. I think it's more they can't into believable character drama than anything. It's always so overwrought and trying to make the biggest deals out of the smallest of every day problems.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure you got banned from animesuki for a reason, Kaioshin.</br>  <br> I can say for a fact that Italian and Even subsaharian Africans had better 'novels' or prose in general than the Nips and Gooks <br><br>So I should take your completely subjective opinion on something as a fact instead of an actual source saying Japanese literature is on par with English literature in age, richness and volume? Yeah, no. You're trying way too hard to look like you know what you're actually talking about.</br></br></br>  <br> So is Twilight. <br>This logic. Yeah but what kinds of awards did it win is the more important question.</br></br>  <br>You can continue to be the biggest weeb and suck the nip dick. I mean I'm not a literary major but I know that Britannica doesn't say anything bad about any culture. They even had Punic culture as a beacon of the midetreannan. Most people consider French and Italian prose as the best that humanity ever provided before the 'siècle du lumiere' for a reason anon.</br>  <br><br>Just curious, how much of Japanese language do you know?</br></br>  <br>It won no awards. It's plebian trash</br>  One of them is not like the others.<br><br><br> protip: its the one stolen from gonzo </br></br></br>  <br> You can continue to be the biggest weeb and suck the nip dick. <br><br>I believe that's called being rational. You can't discredit the literature of an entire culture just because it's not as widely known as Western literature due to Japan's isolationism. <br><br> I mean I'm not a literary major but I know that Britannica doesn't say anything bad about any culture <br><br>Why would they? They're impartial to it. It says Japanese literature is ONE OF THE major literatures in the world in the description.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop reminding people of destroyed dreams, anon.</br>  <br> so suck <br><br>fuck off brazilian piece of shit</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Haroohee</br>  <br>And you say this by having read how many Japanese novels, in Japanese? And I'm not talking about LN trash written for 15 year olds.</br>  <br> now they do have gems such as FMP <br>Do people honestly believe FMP was a good show?</br></br>  I am actually thinking about giving KyoAni another chance. What I mainly dislike are their post 2011 shows, I dropped most of them. While I like the vibe and style of Hyouka I found Chitanda too annoying and Kyoukai no Kanata just ended up bad. I might like Amagi because it seems pretty funny from what I've seen.<br><br>Currently my opinion of them is that they have gotten too stale and that they sometimes overdo things so that they look "kitschy".</br></br>  <br> They even had Punic culture as a beacon of the midetreannan <br><br>Are you implying it wasn't? Kill yourself, retard. You're starting to sound like a dumb stormfag now.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>It's the animator expo with Okiura and like ten other big names, none of which were Bahi JD.</br>  <br>They had nice mosaics that I was fortunate enough to see but in the grand scheme of things Libanese and Italians were the major influences on the midetreannan in that age.<br><br>They are impartial to everything and say everything is good. When everything is good nothing is.<br><br>I don't speak a single word of Italian, Arabic or Nip. but I can appreciate Arabic and Italian works. Meanwhile the Nip works are literal shit. The best thing I've read was a 11 century fiction that many people say was a plagiarism of a forgotten Chinese novel.</br></br></br></br></br>  KnK  and Free! (but dropped that shit)  was an absolute snoozefest.<br><br>People overrate FMP because "muh old animu".</br></br>  I am hurting for a new series to enter English WSJ. All that's left today is Black Clover. I really don't feel right giving it its own thread, but I'm not about to poison one of the other ones.<br><br>And you. You're in a Black Clover thread now. Why? Why did you come here? Are you a masochist?<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia <br>Shokugeki no Soma <br>World Trigger </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No news on other series?</br>  How does this even make SENSE?<br><br>The sword came from his grimoire, right? So why is an anti-magic sword just sitting here? I know it's a Magi(tm) dungeon but this is STUPID.<br><br><br>None that I've heard, but then again I don't really know where to look.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I am hurting for a new series to enter English WSJ. <br>Bleach pls</br></br>  It's tragic because he killed her, and she's cute.<br><br><br>WSJ (Weekly Shounen Jump), not WSJD (Weekly Shounen Jump Dump).<br><br>Regardless, I don't read Bleach and I'm not about to start again.</br></br></br></br></br>  Zabuza, no!  <br> I don't read Bleach and I'm not about to start again. <br>do it, you won't regret it fag, I assure you</br></br>  Even worse! SHE tried to kill HIM!<br><br>BETRAYAL! How can he ever trust again? How will he ever know FRIENDSHIP?</br></br>  Your boobs are falling right of your dress!<br><br><br>No, I really just don't like the series. I dropped it around the Soul Society arc and while some things sounded like stand out, fairly badass moments, what I liked about the series was MAINLY Rukia/Ichigo nonsense buddy buddy bullshit, which apparently gets severely downplayed the further you go on and the dumber the plot becomes.<br><br>Also Ichigo is everything and that's retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>    Here's the only good thing about this chapter, I guess: this other noble isn't actually a secret bitch, she's really just nice and oblivious.    <br>Genius reasoning there.</br>     Those without magic are weak. <br>That's really on the nose. Does it even make sense as a thing he would say? Everyone in his murder-class had magic, so why is he mumbling something like this? I mean, yes, it's because<br> Asta <br>but Asta kicked his ass a few seconds ago so why would he be saying this? In the first place, I got the impression having 0 magic ability was unheard of pre-Asta so why would he care about<br><br>I mean he's just doing it so Asta can show up and<br><br>man fuck this manga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    This looks really stupid.  <br>Just read it as the strong are the ones with the most magic. Stop hurting yourself aniki.</br>    I forgot to mention that this blatant deus ex machina is horrible.<br><br> My magic is too fast for your sword! <br> Oh no, he's right <br>-new, faster sword happens to be behind some wall-<br> I'M FAST NOW <br><br>I'm losing my mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I am hurting for a new series to enter English WSJ. <br><br>The dance manga.</br></br></br>  no<br><br>Is his sword powered by friendship?<br><br>Oh my god</br></br></br></br>  <br>Noelle please die and be free.</br>  <br>looks like her nipples were seared off there</br>  Bravo.<br><br>Bravo.<br><br>A round of applause for brainless mangaka.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ichigo pls no</br>  <br>You can't be serious.</br>  <br>HE MIGHT HAVE FRIENDS BUT HE'S MUH RIVAL</br>  <br><br>It's so damn bad it gets funny. Holy shit i'm laughing so hard.</br></br>  I now know what a deer in the headlights feels like.<br><br>I know I shouldn't be looking, but the eyes are drawn in; I have to see what horrible, depraved depths it can reach.</br></br>  Asta/Juno OTP  <br>Can't wait for this series to be lauded as the first shounen with a canon gay MC.</br>   going from Folie a Deux to Black Clover <br><br>Just look at this shit.<br>I'm not even mad, just really bummed.</br></br></br>  <br>Urgh friend powered attack, the only thing that stopped me from dropping this where the bloody tits. Also MC stupid faces are fucking annoying.</br>  <br>Please let the sword be powered by something other than "friends". I need my curveballs.</br>  <br>It's powered by how shit this manga is. That's why it powered up once it sensed the power of friendship incoming.</br>  Young Adult Rin is too cute.<br><br> So is her HF epilogue appearance </br></br>  <br>I can't believe we actually got London shenanigans, it's like Ufo read our threads.</br>  <br>You have Extra Rin for that.</br>  <br><br> Tohsaka Sakura <br> passive <br>She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The sad fact of Rin as a Mage is that she simply doesn't have the mentality to achieve the goal of all Magi - she's far, far too human. Her dad was similar, although he at least knew he needed to detach himself from the human experience to stand a chance, however shit he was at it. Rin will probably die having recreated a perfect copy of one of Zelretch's relics or something, an achievement in its own right, but she won't be able to properly communicate what went into its making, let alone use it to reach the Maelstrom of Origins. She'll leave her work, the mounted progress of the Tohsaka lineage, to an heir who is not guaranteed to be a prodigy like her, and with the steady decline of Magecraft, may even be of inferior overall talent.<br><br>The only way to reach Akasha in this day and age is to throw away your useless humanity and surpass mortal perception. Only monsters willing to embody an ideal - throwing away everything in pursuit of a single transcendent theory - like Araya, Kurogiri, Roa, and Nrvnqsr have what it takes.<br><br>So the rest of Rin's life probably isn't all that interesting.<br><br><br><br>There is this, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The real master of the Matous and school's queen bee.

Why din't Rohan just write in Kira, "I can't kill anybody".?  <br>What the hell happened to the BGs in this chapter?</br>  [guitar song]  <br>What about them?<br><br>What's the consensus on Karera? Enemy or ally? How long will she live?</br></br></br>  <br>JOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>JO!</br></br></br>  Can Rohan write "I have a stand" in someone and give them stand powers?  Kujo Josefumi has stupid hair.  <br> those hentai protagonists in the background </br>  Who is the undisputed best character in Jojo and why is it Buccellati?  Man, Johnny must've slept around a lot because nearly every male character looks like him.  so the new Kakyoin Dies will be Rohan Dies right?    <br>I don't think you believe that yourself.

She might even be able to control the hair like Yukako.</br></br></br>  <br>either way, josuke can remove hair with bubbles as well</br>  <br>If you're going for  real  spoilers, I guess.<br><br>I prefer this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, a hair stand can't really be much of a match for S&amp;W either way. All I'm saying is that it could be a far better ability than it initially seems, and it's also always handy to have a humanoid form for your stand.</br>  <br> shit stands can't be a threat </br>    <br>Best husbando/waifu.</br>  <br>No. That's like Gappy stealing someone's Stand with Soft &amp; Wet.

Just looks like some 4th tier casual vidya site like dorkly</br>  <br>are we supposed to care? there are 100 left and they really should have just translated the color scans</br>  <br>If your stand is your soul you already have it, you just aren't able to manifest it</br>  <br><br>What the actual fuck<br> I never knew that Joel tweeted my fucking video and later deleted it, what the fuck is going on?<br>Pic related , if you dont believe i made the video(all the images are fucked up because i organized my folder after the video sorry).</br> </br></br></br>  What the fuck happened to Bucciarati after he got "Killed" by King Crimson? He was dead but he wasn't?  Guise<br><br>Why didn't DIO just punch through Jotaro's spine while he was frozen after his 2 seconds passed like he did with Kakyoin?</br></br>  <br>Bruno was supposed to die there but Giorno's healing brought back his soul into his dead body slowly deteriorating.</br>  <br>He did,Jotaro had manga armor.</br>  <br>Because good guys don't die, faggot</br>  <br>He was too slow and full of himself.</br>    <br> jojo died for me after the worst part <br>I understand,but don't worry the next ones are better</br></br>  <br> JoJo died for me after i'm too pleb to read the manga </br>  <br>True but if Jotaro died then there would be no one else from stopping Dio and he would take over the world.</br>   part which could benefit the most from clear action during fights gets the least color <br> part 6 which has the clearest artstyle and straightforward fights gets fully colored </br>  <br>I'd let her roll my stones.</br>  <br>It's all fully colored, retard. All of the parts are being translated by different people, i'm just guessing the guy who did part 6 isn't a lazy cunt</br>    4 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 8<br><br>I haven't read non-shit Vento Aureo scanlations so that's the main reason 5 is rated so low for me. <br>I also don't get the hate on part 3 besides Autism: The JoJo, enlighten me, /jojo/.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah sorry, that's what I meant. I think the people translating the color scans of part 5 translated 6, though.</br>  <br> 1&gt;7 <br> 6&gt;7 <br> 3&gt;7 </br></br></br>  <br>King Crimson had the opposite effect of Golden Experience on Bruno and instead of injecting him with life and accelerating his consciousness when it punched him, it slowed it down.</br>  <br> 3 above anything </br>  <br>  Part 8 last </br>  <br>Likely she'll be an ally but one that doesn't show up much beyond this arc.</br>  <br> 7 so low <br> 8 at the end <br> 3 so high <br> 1 above the rim of the trashcan </br></br></br></br>  <br>7 would be better if Johnny wasn't so shitty compared to Gyro.<br><br>Yeah. Punch ghost people out to fight DIO and his minions. Plus Star Platinum is one of my favorite stands. I don't get the hate.<br><br>Gappy is putting me to sleep. I can only deal with Alzheimer's Sailor running around doing fuck-all for so long.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> monster of the week handled horribly with terrible pacing  <br> Jotaro's fights being the worst of the bunch,literally just resolves things by ORAORAing harder <br> DIO turning completely retarded and the final fight being absolute horseshit <br>It's by far the worst jojo part. In every other part fights are handled way better and the MC isn't a talking brick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him and he has shit taste in almost everything but Araki really, REALLY can't do mystery, the pacing is terrible and there's a new mystery every chapter, with no resolutions and he'll probably change his mind about the original solution so it'll make no sense.<br>Also MC is kinda boring. It's not as bad as part 5, but that at least had cool fights instead of constant joestar family techniques.</br></br>  <br> I also don't get the hate on part 3 <br>It's mostly about the uninteresting monster of the week enemies and stands. The main cast is also inferior compared to those of the subsequent parts.<br><br>Besides, older readers are probably already sick and tired of all the MUDAMUDA and ORAORA, since it's pretty much the first thing that gets you into JJBA.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 1 <br> anywhere near Trashcan <br>Puh leaze</br></br></br>  If Karera had Harvest she could rob the entire Morioh in 2 days  <br> johnny  <br> shitty </br></br>  <br> thinking part 1 is anywhere near as good as any of the other parts.  <br>Its redeeming factor is Dio throws a dog to its fiery death.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Well, dicks.</br>  <br>rip in pieces harvest, you were so interesting araki had to kill you</br>  <br>Part 1 is only above 3 honestly. It had nothing especially bad but nothing especially interesting either.</br>  <br> not liking Johnny "I will fucking murder anyone who disagrees with my path of righteousness" Joestar <br><br> thinking Gappy isn't one of the best Jojos <br><br>what the fuck is up with you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This has to be the most retarded post I've read recently about part 8.</br>  <br> awesome introduction <br> Jojo and Dio's boyhood <br> Mansion Fight <br> Zeppeli's death <br> Bait and switch ending <br> Jonathan is general </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please explain why, unless you're too retarded of course.</br>  <br>Gay Priest used Whitesnake as another body more than he ever actually used the stand power.</br>  <br> Oh man dio sure is a cunt <br> Look at Dio continuing to be an absolute cunt <br> Why don't we make him a cunt vampire <br> Hey that dude punched a frog <br> oh no hes dead <br> yay dios dead <br> oh wait hes a head <br> end <br><br>also Jonathan is the worst fucking most bland ass jojo of them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 is rated low because all Jotaro fights equal up to "i'm just gonna punch harder until it gets punched." So most of the good fights are carried by the rest of the cast. Even Dio's World's amazing fights gets soured by this in that jotaro just punches his way through rather than figuring out a way to win like every other jojo. <br><br>It breaks from the theme of other Joestars who always use their mind while jotaro uses just brute force. Even his Stands Stats are better that every other stand including the world from the start.<br><br> Jotaro vs Kakyoin <br>Just punches through emerald splash then punches more<br><br> Jotaro vs Dark Blue Moon <br>Just suddenly develops star finger and instakills enemy when trapped<br><br> Jotaro vs forever <br>Literally just does the same thing as last time<br><br> Jotaro vs Rubber Soul <br>Literally the only fight jotaro doesn't just power through. He actually used strats tactics to win like a joestar. <br><br> Jotaro vs Wheel of Fortune <br>so-so, still sorta powerhoused, but did use a little joestar trickery.<br><br> Jotaro vs enya <br>sucks up a stand that literally covers the entire town in fog somehow with only the lung capacity of a human.<br><br> Jotaro vs the sun <br>OHKO<br><br> Jotaro vs both anubis <br>Punch to win<br><br> Jotaro vs Alessi <br>7 year old physically beats up man with a stand, an axe, and beefy arms, even though Jotaro was a kind and gentle boy when he was 7.<br><br> Jotaro vs DIO <br>Punches Dio in the leg and makes him explode without being able to recover somehow.<br><br><br>Giorno is guilty of this level of asspull too, which is why he is normally rated low. But all other joestars use the enviroment, circumstance, and their minds to outsmart the enemy with the tools they have. Thats what makes their fights great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oh no, too many mysteries in a mystery setting <br> I can't handle monthly issues so that means the pacing is terrible <br> it also means we'll never see the resolution of the mysteries either, even though we're still years from the actual end of it <br> why can't we go back to shonen battles instead? </br></br></br></br>  <br> also Jonathan is the worst fucking most bland ass jojo of them all. <br><br>Puh leaze</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just use Whitensake to tell him where the spikes were during Heavy Weather</br>  <br>You should've put 1 real one and kept the animefags guessing</br>  <br>Sometimes I feel like you guys just pull random numbers out of a hat or something when making those dumb ranking lists.</br>  <br> Giorno is guilty of this level of asspull too, which is why he is normally rated low <br>Giorno is Joseph with Cars as his stand, it's hardly his fault.</br></br>  <br> I can't handle monthly issues so that means the pacing is terrible <br>Why doesn't Araki just use The World and finish jojo while time is stopped?</br></br>  I just want Komachi to meet Iroha and see the results.<br>If there's one person that can actually help push a girl to victory, it's Komachi.<br><br> Can't kill the fucking cunt now, so maybe next time. </br></br></br>  ALL HAIL IROHA!

The guy will definitely swallow it." <br> "You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now." <br> Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad. <br> "I wouldn't be happy with it..." <br> "Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai..." <br><br>I thought that was said by 8man if weren't for the Yui-senpai at the beginning<br><br> I just want Komachi to meet Iroha and see the results. <br><br>Iroha has done everything Komachi ddid (even the 8man imitation). There's no way they can be on good terms</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just make a new thread and bump it a few times.</br>  Translations for 8man and Iroha's whole 'younger girls' and 'remembers her birthday' scene.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  what is this face trying to convey?  <br>Mods ban multiple Yahari threads</br>  <br>Already tried, I need to try again?</br>  <br><br>I don't think Spyro is pathetic enough to drop something just because his favorite girl might lose.</br></br>  <br>She's missing the "points".</br>  <br>  what is this face trying to convey? <br>She wants a big dock</br></br>  <br> MAX Coffee <br> 130 yen a can <br> Over the budget <br>Iroha confirmed for poorfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not saying he doesn't have romantic interest in Yui. Only that we don't know either way and that one line isn't anything to go by.<br><br>It's seems clear to me that the author has deliberately tried to avoid spilling the beans on Hachiman's romantic feelings. All he gives is the vaguest hints that have to be interpreted and poured over to see. And such hints have come for all the girls in recent volumes.<br><br>It's fun for the waifu wars to act like we know what Hachiman feels. But it's naive to think we've really been given the truth on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to kill this fucken cunt </br>    <br>I seriously hope not, because even he should know that the next volume will focus on Yukino's growth.</br>  <br>You think wrong.</br>  I wonder if Toradora threads were like this when the novels were coming out along with the show.<br><br>I wonder how the show and the novels would be received today.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I didn't mean to jump to conclusions. It's just that particular scene I was expecting a little more from in the LN version. In the anime his voice strained a bit, and I thought maybe the no blushing was FEEL screwing Yui again, but it really turned out to not give anything strong to work with after all.<br><br><br>I was referring to the lines in order. Showing a desire to talk to someone you spend practically every day with doesn't imply romance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She already said that during the scene when they meet with Orimoto</br>  <br><br>Think about it, Komachi knows she could take care of her onii-chan if things went wrong. She also knows that he can rely on her and that she understands him.<br>Really, Komachi might ship them together like mad.</br></br></br>  <br>Toradora threads were probably worse than this. The Taiga tripfag was cancer.</br>  I bet komachi would be so turned off and intimidated by Iroha because they are pretty similar that komachi would be forced to jump into action and start attracting 8man to prevent her from being with komachi. She's okay with yukinon and yui because they aregullible and she knows she can easily deceive them while she dips into that sweet 8inch behind their backs   If there's one person that can actually help push a girl to victory, it's Komachi. <br> Haruno has Komachi's number and may very well have talked to her off-screen <br>Yup, the Haruno end is inevitable.</br></br>  <br><br>And she didnt even lose, he just doesnt like to know that yukino is just an inmature autistic little girl.</br></br>  <br> She rated 8man's date in points. </br>  いろはす～   「先輩、おっそーい」 <br> "Seniors, so yummy!?" <br><br>Bing translation is so funny.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, so much for not reading side material</br></br>  <br> umbrella <br> in snow <br><br>Komachi way r u doin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the better assumption is that he does have feelings of love for all three girls, and its just a matter of which one he decides is the one he loves most.<br><br>Otherwise yes, waifu eats are ultimately pointless, but you should know by now that's not going to stop anything</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>He's slowly translating it. He added another subsection for Ch 1 Today (ends right before the Iroha request scene)</br></br></br>  <br>He's just discouraged, that doesn't mean he won't do it.</br>  <br>It's scary how she managed to understand perfectly 8man and his way of thinking in just 3/4 months</br>  <br>If Iroha and Komachi met they would both realize at that moment that 8man is a gigantic siscon</br>  <br>No automated translator can get that right, because it's writen in such a way that only a human can notice the true translation.</br>  <br>How dense can you possibly be to ignore the constant romantic hints throughout the series and say there's nothing to go by? Your way of thinking is useless and contributes nothing.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>If komachi sees herself in Iroha, then she'll love her because like somebody else said it already, komachi knows that komachi can take good care of 8man.</br>  <br>  It's just that particular scene I was expecting a little more from in the LN version. <br><br>LN scene :<br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br> “By the way…” <br><br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br><br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br><br>Now try to compared it with anime scene.<br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Orimoto scene was part of the Christmas event (it even appeared in the anime)<br><br><br>Do you know what happens when the snow on your robes melts?</br></br></br></br>   “…I’ll be honest with you.” <br><br> The tone of her voice was deeper than the one she used earlier to talk. Because my head was held in place, I could only move my eyes to look at Hiratsuka-sensei and she had a slightly sad smile. <br><br> “It really doesn’t have to be you. Someday, Yukinoshita will change and she might even meet someone that can understand her. There might be someone who can take the extra step for her. The same could be said of Yuigahama as well.” <br><br> Just when would that be? It seemed like something so far into the future that it wasn’t realistic at all, yet at the same time, it seemed so close that I felt it was awfully real. <br><br> “I’m sure you guys feel that your time now is everything. But that’s not true at all. It’ll eventually make sense to you. After all, that’s how the world is made.” <br><br> Those words were probably correct. Someday, somewhere, someone would definitely step over the line for her. When I thought about that unsteady truth, I recalled the slight pain inside me and I twisted my body to brush it off. <br><br>So Hachiman hates the thought of someone getting close to Yukino and he does eventually step over the line with her, but what was that pain inside him?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least he's trying to keep his promise, but there's no way he'd be calm when asking a girl out, just because it's yui doesn't mean anything special.</br>  <br>Cant wait to see the monologues where he has to reject a girl<br><br>I can already somewhat envision how he'd reject Iroha.<br><br>A Yui rejection scene would be incredibly hard for him but it might also involve Yui also realizing where his feelings lie <br><br>No fucking idea how'd he reject Yukino (once she gets past moeblob stage and reaches her final form). Maybe something like Yuki fell out of love or something (unlikely) or they mutually agree it'd never work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe. I don't see this reaching some anguished moment for Hachiman like in a lot of other harem series where the protagonist goes "I like them all, why can't I decide?!" He's going to pick one and then whether he ever had romantic interest in the other girls will be minimized or ignored.<br><br>It's more like the "romantic interest" from Hachiman is so vague and unclear, that for whichever girl wins we will be able to dismiss the moments for the other girls as fans overthinking it. If Iroha wins for instance, people are going to point to the 'indirect kiss' as some pivotal moment that shows it. If she doesn't, then it will have never mattered as much as people thought. The same goes for Yukino's moment on the water ride. And this and other scenes for Yui would be the same way.<br><br>But yeah, trying to stop the waifu wars is an exercise in futility.<br><br>I feel like rather than trying to figure what Hachiman feels, when the author clearly doesn't want to give it away. It's much more enjoyable to see how the girls themselves make their feelings clear along with the other more significant drama in the story and just wait for Wataru to tell us about Hachiman's romantic inclinations clearly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;“I’m sure you guys feel that your time now is everything. But that’s not true at all. It’ll eventually make sense to you. After all, that’s how the world is made.” <br>Foreshadowing</br></br>  <br> he does eventually step over the line with her <br>Are you even reading what you post?</br></br>  <br>Wait, when did this occur? I dont remember reading the part where he felt pain at the idea that someone could get close to Yuki<br><br>Is this new?</br></br></br>  Here's a list of all interesting Iroha Videos on Nico<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother to.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW</br></br>  <br> I can already somewhat envision how he'd reject Iroha. <br>Really nigga?</br></br>  <br> No fucking idea how'd he reject Yukino (once she gets past moeblob stage and reaches her final form) <br>Something like he doesn't want to risk having her going back to being a helpless girl.<br>Or just straight up 'I have feelings for somebody else.'</br></br></br>  <br>It's special because he did in at Valentine day of all time and with Valentine mood. Like this anon explain here .</br>  <br>The more important element of that first quote is that he's actually thinking "man, why do I want to talk to her so badly"<br><br>I just can't see that coming from nothing but friendship</br></br></br>  <br>Him stepping over the line was him asking her what Yukino's career path is.<br><br> “This is the first time you’ve asked me something like that, isn’t it?” <br> “Really?” <br> I knew that, but I pretended not to. <br> For all this time, there were plenty of opportunities to ask personal things like that, but I had drawn a line that I swore not to step over. It’s because I thought I wouldn’t be forgiven if I did. <br><br>It may seem petty but for Hachiman its a big deal. Similar to how its a big deal when he asks Yui if she had free time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Back to my previous point. <br><br>I don't think there is a love triangle at the end of volume 11. Both girls signaled to eachother to be genuine and follow their feelings.</br></br>  How long until we return to decent, peaceful threads?  <br>It's from the bridge scene with sensei in Vol9.<br><br><br>He has his own view of what is stepping over the line with Yukino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't v-day when he did it. He just saw a moment that gave him the proper mood to ask her out and keep his promise.</br>  <br><br>Never.<br><br>It's all shitposting and waifu wars from now until the finish line.</br></br></br></br>   No fucking idea how'd he reject Yukino <br><br>He can do it. With a smile, he'll say "Don't you remember, we can't be friends right?".</br></br>  The lack of yukinofags and yuifags is strange lately<br><br>Would this be an iroha general thread in the future?</br></br>  <br>Yes it's different, but it's not different enough to mean anything especially significant. 8man being embarrassed because he has no idea how to ask a girl out is nothing we didn't know about.<br><br>I was expecting more than just some embarrassment out of that scene, since it's basically the only scene 8man has alone with Yui in the entire volume. (Unless FEEL cut entire Yui scenes like they did Iroha)</br></br></br>  <br>Last thread was relatively peaceful until burgerland started coming home.</br>  <br>No, Valentines Day is aquarium date<br><br>Remember, the chocolate event was a pre Vday event</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Yukinoshitters got BTFO. They can't be as smug and stuck-up as they used to be anymore.</br>  <br>Say it ain't so, anon. S2 has been the worst thing to happen to this fanbase since the blogshit in early S1 threads.</br>  <br>Nah, we'll have our weekly threads on saturdays once these BTB finally die.<br>Also, I can't blame them because the Iroha spoilers that we got so far are amazing.</br></br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>  <br>That seems something like Yukino would say (since shes always the one who says that they cant be). I get your point though<br><br>Though if you take that line by itself, one could spin it so that Yukino means that they cant be friends, but it doesnt say that they cant be bf/gf. <br><br>Semantics</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The "step over" he was talking about was the obvious problem she has with the family. Like he always said, he doesn't want any of it. Remember, it was Haruno who made a request to him to ask Yukino's career path.</br></br>  <br> "Don't you remember, we can't be friends right?". <br>"I don't recall asking you to be my friend.</br></br>  <br> He just saw a moment that gave him the proper mood to ask her out <br><br>And this is the stressing point we're discussing, Anon-kun. It would make more sense if he read the mood, reminded about the date promise and brushed it off for later.</br></br></br>  <br> general thread <br><br>Stop that. These threads will hopefully be dead by next week, LN translation and BD releases notwithstanding.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was Yukino so sad to give in to Yui on that one? All Yui was saying she wants to be friends.</br>  What's wrong with him?  <br>There's no point on brushing it off later, he was well aware of the elephant in the room that kept growing with the incoming v-day.<br>The next scene inside the club room confirms that.</br></br>  <br>Yui was saying many things, none of which Yukino had any say in. Yukino was very reluctant to give in at that moment, probably because she realizes her dependence on both Yui and 8man.</br>  <br> Missing the entire point <br><br>We're asking about his motivation during "that" scene which some people saw it like more than just "want to fill dat promise soon".</br></br></br>  <br><br> Liking a poorfag </br></br>  <br>Too much alpha. His life and decisions depend on his status.</br>  <br>Because she wanted the 8dick and gave up on him too for the sake of the forced friendship</br>  <br> of the elephant in the room that kept growing with the incoming v-day <br>I'm stupid but what was it if not the date? Yukino's dependence?</br></br>  <br>I'm still talking about 8man's motivation during that scene, Anon. There was no elephant in his inner monologue during that exact scene (before entering the room)</br>  <br> Liking a basket case </br>  <br>Conflicted. She doesn't want Yui giving up, she doesn't want to give up, and her usual recurring thought she could mess this up again.<br><br><br>Nothing. It was the whole world around him that was wrong.</br></br></br></br>  I just realized something - Iroha is what Komachi would be without the 8man.  <br>That both girls have the hots for him......<br><br>Yuki's dependence was fully revealed until the 2nd half of Vol 11</br></br></br>  <br> Choosing someone based on their wealth <br>You don't even deserve to look at her.</br></br>  <br> he was well aware of the elephant in the room that kept growing with the incoming v-day. <br>The next scene inside the club room confirms that.<br><br>But this scene below show he is just start aware elephant in club room yet.<br> She shot a glance to the door of the club. After that, she had trouble bringing out her voice. And unlike earlier, her expression sank. <br><br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br><br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again? I just wasn’t confident in any of those. <br><br> Unable to exchange any more words, I glanced at her face, my back still slumped and my eyes downcast. The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> liking a girl because of money </br>  <br>I'm rich and I can understand haruno, i'm the oldest daughter too.<br><br>I would be happier with a normie life</br></br></br>   かたや雪ノ下はなぜか上から目線でふっとやや高圧的な微笑みを浮かべた。<wbr>二人の姿にちよっと気圧された様子の一色が若干言葉を濁らせる。</wbr> <br><br>Iroha doesn't have any feeling for 8man they said.<br><br>(currently reading chapter 1, right where Iroha asking for 8man sweet reference.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino and Yui fags are already coming out for the day, and a few more hours from now they'll be the bulk of the thread until Irohafags start walking up again.</br>  <br>Yahallo~!</br>  <br>I disagree, it's not uncommon at all for 8man to do a "wait, why did I do that" retrospective monologue. Him hanging back to talk to Yui would be a new development for him, but it would be a friendship development regardless.<br><br>You guys need to remember 8man is still a pretty big autist in terms of general friendship, not just romance.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thankfully, she has an equally rich and more sane sister  who will win the 8man bowl .</br></br>  <br>Thanks, I know exactly what that quote says.</br>  <br>Yurpoor Irohafag, I bet your glad you have free medical care for all that butthurt, huh?</br>  <br><br>8man is not dense, anons. He doesn't need to remind himself all the time that he knows that Yui likes him and that he made a promise for a date.<br>This issue has been growing since volume 10.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet it was the first time someone honestly asked her to become friends</br>  <br>I'm just here mostly just reading the thread. Don't want to disturb Irohafags having fun.</br>  OST FUCKING WHEN<br>I NEED THOSE FEEL PIANO TRACKS</br>  <br>It probably was, but at least the second time she tells him exactly why they couldn't be friends.</br>  I hate how we kept being led on with 8man's hitting on Iroha all the time. We all know she has approx. 0 chance of winning. Why does 8man hit on her? Is it an automatic reflex because she resembles Komachi?  <br> he knows that Yui likes him <br><br>That would be out of character for him. He always denying/rejecting the idea of girls have any feelings on him and act based on that knowledge. He has trauma regarding "too confident" attitude, remember? Also, honey toast scene confirmed it.</br></br></br>  <br> Don't want to disturb Irohafags having fun. <br>In what way would your posts disturb anyone, especially us?<br><br>Unless you're the denialfag or something, of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Icequeen Yukino was just an illusion </br>  <br>Come on, anon. He knew about it for some time, but denial is denial.<br>The problem just got bigger to the point of him not being able to ignore it anymore.</br></br>  <br>I know he is not dense anon <br>but in that scene show he just START aware elephant within club room after seeing Yui reaction to his invitation.<br>Before that he is in valentine mood and invite her by himself.<br><br>If he totally aware elephant in club room before that scene, Why would he invite Yui in first place where it could make thing even worse?</br></br></br></br></br>  Dont see why people keep latching onto a few scenes from Ch 1; yes its great that Yui got development on her friend but lets not blow it up.<br><br>Yuki's scenes are yet to come and this is the end of Yui's until double date.</br></br>  <br><br>He knew since the fireworks festival.</br></br>  <br>*on her front</br>  Now that's beautiful.  <br>He knew Yui likes him since forever, just that his cynical mind kept telling him that it was out of kindness, even post Vol. 4. <br><br>He only started considering the romantic possibility recently since around the events in Vol. 9-10 or so, though.</br></br></br>  <br>The Yui/Yukino rejection is easy.<br> "Sorry, but you're not my type." <br><br>A blunt final rejection would be pretty fitting for the series, since it's about being direct and sincere about your feelings, rather than hiding behind excuses and pretense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Yukino even realizes that wearing those thigh high socks of her is fucking lewd as hell. God damn it.</br>  <br>So when he does get the idea that Yuki likes him? Vol 11?</br>  <br>Indeed she is. Best girl by a mile.</br>  Anyone have the picture explaining the meaning behind yesterday's episode?  <br>'Elephant in the room' is always in the back of his mind whenever he's close to Yui, simply because he knows about what she feels and what she wants.<br><br> If he totally aware elephant in club room before that scene, Why would he invite Yui in first place where it could make thing even worse? <br>Because that's the right thing to do, volume 11 literally ended with him saying that hurting people it's ok if it's genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why she didn't accept his friendship. At this point they are friends though.</br>  <br> Sorry, but you're not my type <br>Really faggot</br></br>  <br>Denial is the key term here. He knows on a subconscious level, but because he's trying to avoid misunderstandings like his middle school days, he refuses to believe the evidence in front of him<br><br><br>It's not "latching onto a few scenes" it's discussing new lines for the scene spoiled last thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>vol2</br></br>    <br>Hachiman doesn't have a type, he used that as an excuse to not say that he ends up liking anyone that was nice to him</br>  Before someone starts spouting genuine this, not genuine that, let's make it clear what genuine means for 8man.<br><br>It's difficult to define what is genuine, but it's easier to identify what's not genuine for him<br> Hayama's clique: Tobe likes Ebina, but Ebina doesn't want to be in any kind of relationship <br> Hayama and Miura are against Tobe confessing his love because he would get rejected and therefore the group would fell apart. <br> The Service club starts acting like them. The girls harbor feelings for 8man but they are afraid of getting rejected or the club disappearing because of their actions.  <br><br>Genuine is about the feelings. It doesn't necessary need to be connected with telling or not telling lies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man's a siscon, he loves playful younger girls like Komachi. Iroha is very clearly his type, the club members aren't.</br>  <br>I can see it too. "You're a wonderful girl but (Y) is just too important to me."</br>  <br>Because end goal is him asking her again to be girlfriend<br><br>I mean dude already felt passion and heart beating faster when asking her to be his friend. <br><br> I felt my heart beat a little faster. It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond. <br><br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion <br><br>Wonder what Try#3 will entail</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hikki is a genius of wisdom, but it comes with a critical flaw -- he has trouble seeing the good side of things. It was mentioned he could actually become a cult leader -- even though it was a joke, it's probably true. If he ever decided to become a bad guy he could easily manipulate people.<br><br>And you know what? I also note the people around him don't bother trying to set him straight on this.</br></br>  <br> 'Elephant in the room' is always in the back of his mind whenever he's close to Yui, simply because he knows about what she feels and what she wants. <br><br>[citation needed]<br><br>or Source: from Your ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  So wait, the end result of EP 13 is that if there is a love triangle and there is a winner there will be no hard feelings and everyone can be friends. I had the impression that if someone were to win 8man before that then it would wreck everything.  <br> genius of wisdom <br>Slight hyperbole there.</br></br>  <br> Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making. So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it. <br>isn't that almost the same shit 8man said when they were helping Yui with the cookies?</br></br>  <br>He already is a cult leader. The club is the cult.<br><br>Both Yui and Yukino are basically broken and look to him for guidance.</br></br></br>  <br>That completely contradicts him doing it because of the "valentine mood" though. Wanting to let her down is one thing, but trying to do it specifically because of valentines day would be adding insult to injury.</br>  <br>It is, I thought that too during translation</br>  <br>Yes he and Iroha make the argument that it is the thought that counts. Cept Iroha branches off into budgets and money with hers while Hachiman's was about how Yui's cooking skills are awful</br>  <br>That would be the stupidest, lamest most non-genuine way, and a hack writeup for WW</br>  <br>Toradora threads were in few ways. The threads were more active because the show was insanely popular for one. Also there was some hilarious drama with the sub groups for the anime. Started being subbed by gg and then Koda and company said "fuck this show" so their translator started a side project just for Toradora called qq, but he was slow and people were pissed, and somewhere around that time people split off of gg to make coalguys too, which was amusing. Only shit with the novels was anons that read them saying shit like "you guys are going to freak out next episode". They didn't really post translations because people would get mad about spoilers.</br>  Why doesn't 8man just go to the clubroom one day and just straight up tell the girls that he doesn't love them romantically, he isn't currently interested in a relationship, and that they should stop it. There, no heart break from either of them.  <br> They didn't really post translations because people would get mad about spoilers. <br>That's unlike /a/ now</br></br>  <br>Everyone comes to him for guidance, even people not in the club.<br><br>He lacks charisma though. He just needs to lift.</br></br></br>  <br> 8man's a siscon <br>Have you ever considered that they're having a healthy sibling relationship? Also the talk with Hayama pretty much confirmed that he doesn't have any specific types. The only 'type' he prefer are girls can take care of a dead weight</br></br>  <br> The only 'type' he prefer are girls can take care of a dead weight <br>Basically Komachi.</br></br>  <br>Didn't he just say it in his genuine speech at the end of vol. 11 that he thinks (to be genuine) he doesn't want lies and deceptions to / from people who are important to him? Telling lies may not be all there is, but it seems to be a part of 8man's definition of "genuine", whatever that is.</br>  <br>This. <br>He's almost 3rd year, he needs to study and decide about the future, yet they force drama onto him. <br>All he needs now is sweet romcom.</br></br></br>  Can't they just do a threesome and have everything solved happily?  <br>The first and third lines are Hayama. Hayama is saying 8man doesn't know what his type is, and/or that the "much quieter and louder girls" (an obvious hint at Yukino/Yui) he's liked in the past weren't his type.</br>  <br>Indeed, brother. And we both know just who has been providing that sweet romcom for some time now.</br>  <br>Iroha is Komachi</br>  <br>If you mean, 8man, Komachi and Iroha, then yes, that would fix everything and more.</br>  <br>Because if he *is* actually looking for a relationship, that wouldn't be genuine.</br>  <br>I'm sure there would be more to it than that, but that would be the gist of it. Iroha has plenty of romance flags, but 8man cares enough about Y+Y to struggle and endure pain to keep them in his life.</br>  <br> He likes her as a sister <br> His preferred type is basically her sister <br> So he's a siscon! <br>Really faggot?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the happiest ending out there.</br>    <br>Komachi deserves better than 8man.</br>  <br> Have you ever considered that they're having a healthy sibling relationship? <br>Anon this is a Taiwanese textbook visualization production we're talking about. The protagonist has gone as far as saying he'd marry Komachi if she weren't his sibling, that having an imouto is better than being married, and has been called siscon by other members of the cast.<br><br>Komachi and Iroha by extension is very much his type.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br><br>T-thanks Watari, now I got a 2D poorfag fetish</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The protagonist has gone as far as saying he'd marry Komachi if she weren't his sibling <br>He said he'd prefer to stay with Komachi rather than be married.<br><br>That's because she takes care of him and doesn't really judge him for his actions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this a new kind of denialfag? Holy shit this is tiresome.</br>  <br> poorfag <br> smiling all the time <br> still able to make 8man have fun at the date <br>It's impossible to dislike Iroha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Precisely.<br><br>And really, are there even any major parallels between Komachi and Iroha other than "younger"?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha by extension is very much his type <br>She doesn't want a dead weight to take care of.</br></br>  <br>Aside from also being sly, no.</br>  <br>attitude, banter etc etc</br>  <br>I wouldn't pay 130 yen for a canned beverage either.<br><br>8man is like some fag who buys red bull.</br></br></br>  <br>Check the OP.</br>    <br>Actually, 8man thought a few times that Iroha is pretty much like Komachi, just that Komachi is more sly when it comes to interacting with him. There should be more similarities than just "being younger".</br>  <br>M-my heart</br>  <br> implying she would only buy one can. </br>  <br>More like this Komachi/Iroha thing is today's flavor of delusion from Irohafags.<br><br>You are now reminded that if anything, 8man putting them in the same category means imoutozoning, not victory.</br></br></br>  <br>Similar personality, gets along with 8man really well without drama, younger, talks scoring points, off the top of my head.<br><br>And of course there's the fact that 8man likens her to Komachi very frequently.</br></br></br>  <br> That's because she takes care of him and doesn't really judge him for his actions. <br>[CITATION FUCKING NEEDED]</br></br>  <br>More like <br> Wakes up at 4am smiling thinking about the date <br> Buy Anna Sui, pink yarn ball while smiling thinking about the date </br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br><br>Please anons. I didn't want to like Iroha this much.</br></br>  <br><br>8man loves girls like his sister.<br><br>Read the karaoke scene during yui's birthday in the LN. He literally said it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha's so imoutozoned that 8man lusts over her lips multiple times in each volume.</br>  <br>You're triggering my autism</br>  <br> 8man loves girls like his sister </br>    <br>Stupid sexy Tobe.</br>  <br>Also, on the same episode<br> Foreboding </br></br>  So I didn't pick this up until recently and then I just marathoned both seasons. This leaves me a bit confused by the threads. It sounds as if the anime is pretty much caught up to the LNs? What volumes did it actually cover?  「……シスコン？」<br>「…… Feet? 」<br>「ばっかちげぇよ」<br>"All bark poop!"<br><br>Ha ha ha, now I'm reading bing translation just for entertainment. This is way too funny,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the karaoke chapter.</br>  <br>He doesn't think of Iroha as non-blood-related Komachi only, so no imouto-zone here.<br> Isshiki had a sly part to her that would skillfully use her immaturity and innocence to her advantage. That was a part that resembled my little sister, Hikigaya Komachi. However, her cuteness and charm was lacking. Therefore, I could conclude that Isshiki Iroha was an example of an absolutely uncute Komachi. <br><br> As far as outer appearances and scheming were concerned, Yukinoshita Haruno came to mind. But she fell absolutely short of her. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha could be said to be an inferior Haruno-san. <br><br> That fluffy aura of hers. That resembled closely to Meguri-senpai, but fundamentally, they were different creatures. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha was a phony Meguri. <br><br> That desire to be pampered was probably very similar to Sagami. But unlike Sagami, she was much more skillful. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha was something like a super amplified Sagami. <br><br> I also thought that how she made a character for herself and behaved in a way to preserve that was very similar to Orimoto Kaori. Therefore, Isshiki Iroha was a different type of Orimoto. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm reading bing translation just for entertainment <br>You didn't before?</br></br>  <br>I don't get it, he gets her a Pan-san every year.</br>  Iroha really was a mistake. Watari should have left the romcom elements of the series die on the vine after he decided to make this a more serious story.  <br> 「……シスコン？」 <br> 「…… Feet? 」 </br></br>  <br>I provided you evidence, why would I look one for you?</br>  <br>He said like his sister, not his sister.</br>  <br>Yes, S2 ends at the same point as volume 11.</br>  <br>Because<br/></br>  <br>So is the iroha date thing something they just didn't adapt to the anime or something?</br>  <br> smiling all the time </br>  <br><br>Lol, i mean <br><br>I didnt say that 8man would fuck her sister, I said that he said during the karaoke party that he likes girls like her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well I was just using the english text to mark the progression (I'm not that fluent in moon so wall of runes confuses me).</br>  <br>Iroha date is a side story.</br>  <br>10.5 was a side volume, so it probably wouldn't have been included in the main run anyway</br>  <br>Fuuck that, why would you do that?<br>I know it's not literally smiling all the time, but those faces are painful to look at.</br></br>  Why is yui after the 8dick?  <br> 1 hour earlier to the date she stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pray for an OVA<br>The S1 OVA was a side volume too? or it was original</br></br>  <br>Don't you dare convincing me jumping ships</br>  <br>Yes, as was the bonus episode</br>    <br>My heart.</br>  <br>this scene reminds me that we can never see her in anime form any more (except for the OVA).<br>sad Iroha, sly Iroha, disgusted Iroha, devilish Iroha, surprised Iroha, dejected Iroha, heartbroken Iroha, confident Iroha, genuine Iroha...<br><br>Wow, she had a lot of expression in just few episodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Original, later adapted by WW.<br> still no webm for this scene </br></br>  If Iroha is poor<br>If the cunt is rich<br><br>that explain why she goes after him at the begining</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha will always be "just kinda there" tier for me but even I think this writefaggotry is cute as hell.</br>  <br> I wonder how it would look if someone took it off <br>Thus, Yukinon became the moeblob she is now.</br></br>  I've never played a Persona game in my life but holy shit was this show good.<br> Actually good humor <br> Great characters <br> Rocking soundtrack <br> Teddy <br> A great MC <br> Great detective story <br> One of the best english dubs i've heard <br> Nanako <br> Adachi <br>Is there any other anime like this?<br>I already ordered Persona 3 and 4 so i'm asking for anime recommendations</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Play the Atelier games and watch the 1 anime they made of one of the games, Atelier Escha and Logy<br><br>comfy / cute</br></br>  <br>Persona 4 is the blandest Persona and the most neckbeard targeting of the  4  games.</br>  <br><br>Ignore anyone who tells you to watch, or play anything that has to do with Persona 3 it's shit.
