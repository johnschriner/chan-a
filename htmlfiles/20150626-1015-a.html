[ which sento would you sento?  Is that from the OVA?   If the fairies represent each element, what does Sento represent?  Motherhood, health and fertility?       all dem clothing switches  Sento is FAT in the good way      The heart.     Why choose this ripoff when you can go for the real deal? It'll also be free of social retardation.    Heart, you dolt.     anal pounding    Where's the goddamn raws at?   Why does Snail have child bearing hips? What is this sorcery?    Nevermind, found it.    The one that is not Sento   Sento the BEST Amagi Brilliant Park   Yes.   KyoAni lost its way.  RIP    Facebook filename     I like where this is going.    All the creatures in this show have the same rape face, man.   And I love it, doujins when?      Wrestling anime by Kyoani when?   I wouldn't Sento any Sento.  I'd force her and Kanye to fuck and watch them carefully with my fingers Gendo-style.      One shitty wrestling anime is enough for one decade.     FIRE  ALL, BUT FIRE IS BEST      Where? Can't find shit on nyaa even searching for 甘城ブリリアントパーク     nosub tv   Has Kyoani ever created a more sexual character than Sento?  Oh fuck, totally forgot more OVA's were coming   Her name is Muse.    WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN PINK MAYOI RUNS WILD ON YOU?!     she is love       Wait, I know that there were little specials/shorts in every BD release, but I didn't hear about any full length OVA eps.   9 pages of doujins     I'd any Sento.   Jesus Christ those Sento's   Conversely, not having any Sento's makes her head look really big when wearing that outfit       sento is  T H I C K H I C K           Just. Pure. Sex.          The fuck is going on in this episode?        Just ask them both for double paizuri.   This episode just reiterated the fact that Sento is thick and sexy.    It'll also be free of social retardation.    implying social retardation doesn't make me fully erect       Maximum overlewd.    Everything.     I know Sento likes Kanie but do the fairies?    [Ohys-Raws] Amagi Brilliant Park - 14 OVA (BD 1280x720 x264 AACx3).mp4    Lewd Koboli when   That fucking thigh...     princess Muse   perfect      this fucking episode   KyoAni found a way. This better get a second season eventually. You can tell they had a blast making it.  Also, what was wrong with Muse's head?       slept wrong      we didn't see pic related  I know it's asking for too much, but I feel somewhat cheated.   Is vivid going to sub this?  Is Ashe in this?   I like how Kanye is hitting tirami in the back    MY DICK     couldnt even put up a picture wiwth her in the foreground     But that's lewd anon.    they wouldn't let a man pro-wrestle a woman would they?       you fucking idiot you're supposed to mention the new episode is out    when did kyoani become so lewd   Seriously, Sento is the most lewd character I've seen in years.     not having the fairies tag team avchan and then molest her after putting her in submission   you had one job kyoani        She's the combination of innocence but also lewdness      her voice is also pure sex    Pure heart, lewd body    No Sento in accountant outfit.  you WHAT.       implying ashe would be up for that     Do they combine into Captain Sento?    Her meeting outfit is close enough.    no group saying they're doing subs   Sento Claus would be my choice.   yup, a deadly combination for my heart, she's so incredible it makes me cry   Did they announce season 2 with the OVA?   Nope, just another OVA someday.    PresSento    You son of a bitch.    kek    Anyone?    I think I saw her in it somewhere    mfw they just keep making OVAs season 2 is made up of OVAs     source?  better than nothing I suppose     subs   air     season 2 is made up of OVAs  Sounds like SYD     Not enough ass. The manga was better regarding that. I can't say nothing bad about her Sentos though.    I just. Absolute perfection. Best girl combined with best element.     source?   google.ca       .ca    what is it about Sento that makes her so much more pretty than the other kyoani girls?   The fact that she  doesn't behave like a FUCKING ANNOYING CUNT  is a big plus I reckon    The fact that she always makes this slightly pained and reserved face? She always comes across as someone who is really trying.    There's more to her than just incompetence and/or anger.     her   pure heart     She has  9 pages of Doujins     Kyaa~    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Afx<wbr>itIDRK7c</wbr>  [ ]     I like that they give her a subtle smile instead of a big goofy smile.     pure    she was talking about pornokun    she actually is      ...oh right, I'm supposed to be mad about this.   ...Kyaa~      Subs fucking when   anyone has that muse stitch?   Who is this Sento Demon?   I'd take seasonal OVAs, even inconsistent once/twice a year OVAs over a season 2. Keep the anime alive forever. 5 years down the line I still want there to be amagi OVA being made      blood  THAT'S NOT PG    ¢o    please let her fullfill her wishes    that outfit makes me have dirty thoughts     that navel  I need to hunch over.          Why is it always that most fun shows don't get a second season? I still can't get over Seto no Hanayome and now this.    My dick.   Why was Kanye not in his office helping Latifa out?    fuck I didn't want to fap today goddamn you kyoani      I didn't want to fap today  what is wrong with you    I am amazed by how really close KyoAni copied Nakajima's art into the anime.   what did you expect their almost as godly as Ufotable     pure heart   tried to check porn and also monapis          She was being innocently curious    i know that i am asking for too much, but a pantyhose version would kill my dick       Latfia in a ponytail   Sento with her hair down.   This is what happens when great things are achieved,anons.         Miku Kadowaki is one of Kyoani's best character designer   Was Sento the only one in the Kanyebowl?   I'm curious, where did this, "fairies and navels," thing begin?    I want this callendar.    Kanye is the only other contestant. If he could clone himself but in girl form he would choose his clone.   SENTO U KAISHI    i still have two of them.  interested?     Of course.  How did you get them in the first place?        those butt fangs     tfw S2 never   so in the end who was the worse themepark manager? John Hammond or 50 cent?      give me your @      yeoldfakeacc@gmail.com    Who /watchingitraw/ here?  Meme subs when?    I haven't seen this show why is she crying?      because you haven't seen this show    Her group of friends all end up working together on a professional anime production. They've wanted that since the end of high school.    Thinkin' of dreams.   I'd Sento any Sento at any Sento fucking Sento   Tears of happiness. All 5 friends had finally got to work together on the same project.    ...so salama then?    So this is what it's like when two autist like each other but can't tell the other.     Tough choice between Air and Water, both look so sexy with Sento's looks.    SUBS WHEN? U B S  W H E N ?            I was really hoping for a suffering ending.    <br/>    I'm happy it got a happy ending.    How many times I wonder has this happened because I had no social capabilites.     My boner isn't.      Boners are never happy anon    Not trying to go to much into RL. But I know exactly two times where I found out that the other girl also liked me but I was too autistic to make a move.    how can so much sex be in one picture    i came just by watching this    Probably never if you're ugly.     implying        someone should have probably asked vivid before this came out    this is my fetish     this the best girl   what is this? A slut for ants?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073  yours does not have thighighs    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073   Girl's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.      Wrong.  She's second-best.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073    All of them.    this will never be subbed   you will never actually know what the episode is about unless you watch it raw     I don't think sento would get along with sento or sento     not learning moon    Who Tiramie here?  I miss this show.    learning mongolian for malaysian rotoscope toons     kyoani being kyoani     I want to fuck Nonaka Ai's voice     The result of what happens when Kyoani has a lot of free time    Macaron's daughter will never get animated  Why live   how long till kyoani just goes fuck it and adapts this uncensored   I think they should just go 'fuck it' and make S2 and stop trying for artsy fartsy.    But isn't this a hentai doujin unless I'm mistaken?    it's by the author and illustrationist     That moment when Kyoani starts making hentai     What's the context of this?    Officially canon   Kyoani found a way.  Too bad Hibike is shit.     Why not? Do you steer with your dick?    Because Zuka-chan finally stopped fucking up her auditions and got herself a VA role    Was it for an eroge?     I think they should just go 'fuck it' and make S2 and stop trying for artsy fartsy.  They don't have enough story. Right now there is enough for 6 episodes or so. And there isn't any plot on Chris Tucker yet. The latest book involved the waterpark.     Man, I really need to get around to reading the LN's.   according to nyaa comments DDY is subbing the ova         Kobori didn't make an appearance, did she?      She showed up but I don't think she got any lines.      somehow her midriff feels more erotic than the fairies?    its over  our dicks are finished     I think I know who directed this episode.   Dammit.  Now I'm really wishing for a S2.       Fire Sento  OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD       Didn't notice that the other Fairies swapped outfits too, will have to dump that is well.    Those are some nice  airbags        I wanted drawfags to draw Sento in the Elementario outfits    mfw KyoAni did it themselves   A way was absolutely found. Too bad they're not all detailed like  but muh dick remains satisfied.          So these outfits are magically made to form fit and not get stretched?   My dick.    I can't tell whose more aroused in that picture       Salama excited that she's wearing Muse's clothing     once again worst girl ruins everything   oh my god        Water Koboldi     You trying to ruse me?    And here's the last thing I'm posting unless something else lewd crops up later in the episode (haven't finished watching it yet) Figured I didn't need to post this one since  is much higher quality art wise, but I felt bad about not completing the set.        Yooooooooo.        Why is it always that most fun shows don't get a second season?   There's a real danger the comedy won't be as funny as the first time.     Salama as Muse   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dOi<wbr>QYt7eqbI</wbr>  [ ]    how is this legal   I can't tell who is who in this picture       Seconds later, I see this. Kyoani finds a way.  You're a bit late to the party m8.              that shop      Salama showing Kobori Muse's erongenous zones   and her favorite spots to lick      Goddess of sex having such tiny nipples.     Jasas chrost.  Those sentos are out of control.  Her hips stretched the shit out of the fairies outfits.      no bully it took me less than 5 minutes    I am Sento, the fairy of semen     How hard would you Sento?   Oh lawd Lawd jesus If there's no season 2, we fucking riot brehs         are we going to need new names       Id rather my waifu.    Tell those Hibikeks you are not flavor of the season Sento.      Who is this dairy fairy?      Can't be.    I want to drink that bath water.     koboli actually displaying cleavage    Will based [Mori] save us?  This is classic Fumoffu of lewdness  pls tell me the clock was still buried under the cicadas  Mori only does specials    Read the guide: http://buyfag.moe  Rock was right.  you have no taste, Revvy. Take that hawaiian shirt back.     tfw no kumiko figure   The wait begins.   It's inevitable, just have patience. At the very least, everything under the sun gets a nendoroid, if you're into that shit.     wait for wonfes. That's when most of the latest season figures are announced.  Please let there be an Auska figure too    Finally got around to buy some acrylic risers for my display cabinet  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848  Oh fuck off already.    Who pissed on her towel?    Around 30 acrylic risers..    corner looks fucked up for the one in the cabinet pretty shitty riser for your fancy ass cabinet imo    I've beard the naked body is exclusive, but that seems like a strange decision. He doesn't seem to come with anything else except this stupid Shinkawa face.   Oh well, I'll buy at least 2 regardless       soon     How much did you pay?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848   Not the Tokyoshitmode shills again. Can we get you banned?     I just hope (with Orange Rouge and everything) that there will be Kekkai Sensen scales.    But I'd take Kumiko too.       That's the protective film which I haven't bothered to take off, they're all clear.    Where did you buy them?    What's wrong with that site?    Oh that's much better then Have fun setting up your displays     They removed the commercial spam reporting option, but it's worth a try anyway.    Overpriced. Shills come here every once in a while and people got tired of hearing about that site.     Can you post pics of your display when you're done adding them?    Who is this? I don't know kanji or the character, but that little arcade cabinet is way too much.   £176 in total including shipping. The 3 tier riser were £12.49, single riser was £2.96 and the book holders were £5.49.   Site called displaysense, I previously bought my display cabinet from them.   I plan on doing so, but I'm currently dreading setting up all the Nendoroid Petits I have.          That particular figure seems like it's decently priced. Considering it's a retailer for Aniplex, you bypass the need to pay BiJ or N-Y their profit + proxy service.    Character from a dead manga. High score girl.     I agree that the Aniplex exclusives are the only thing worth ordering from there.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848   Ok.  Either way, how likely is that NY will open pre-orders for her again? Never used them before.      Etotama figs at Wonfes please.   What are the chances of a complete Etotama nendoroid line?  Don't answer.      High Score Girl. A story set in the early 90s about a boy and a shy, cute and very angry girl who's pretty good at video games. Notorious because all the games and consoles appearing in the story are real.  SNK then sued Square/Enix because apparently somebody forgot to ask them to use Fatal Fury, etc. This caused the manga to stay in an eternal hiatus. In the end it was dumb move because it's pretty much free advertising for SNK Playmore and all the games shown get praise from the main character.  Now this is intriguing because it's hinting the manga might return soon.        Fuck, it's dead? I only have the first two volumes but I figured I'd buy the rest once it's finished because it was really enjoyable. Was it just not popular enough?      __ 0%   Pretty mode nendos of some of the girls would nice though.       Where did you buy them?    Thank SNK.    Thanks for answering my question before I asked it. I couldn't connect to the server for whatever reason.    2nd response.    Buying male figures   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848  No one cares, shill.    That's a super-movable nendoroid, right? Is it true that those are really brittle?     lovelive     Yes and yes   Stop posting this every thread.      Post figures of death anons. I need to find one looking all badass and deadly.   Brittle implies they break, which they don't, but they're pretty poorly designed. The joints fall apart constantly when you're posing them.    Seriously? Why would they even do that? Alright, /a/ might not have that much problems with it, but I thought that other boards were rather prone to get targeted by shilling.     The only choice      That's annoying, I wish they'd stop with those.    Anybody pre-ordering this?   I guess it's just encompassed by the 'rule violation' option. Either that or the new administration plan to sell-out to shills.     Ask /m/ or /toy/  I think most mecha designs are ugly as fuck      Not bad. Looks like it'll be hard to find, and no doubt expensive, but cool. I like jojo, so good suggestion anon. Ill see if i can find a used one on mfc.   I got an email from GSC saying my paypal payment has failed, I called paypal and they told me that there wasn't any transaction from GSC and that I should just place another order. I gave up trying to explain what a pre-order was and how I can't just place a new order. I have sent GSC a request to try again or do a manual payment. Is there anything else I should do?    not wanting to fuck a takemikazuchi    Kirarin when   I don't know. They act like it's some cool feature that increases poseability but then they give you far fewer parts to pose with so it works out about the same in the end. It's just a nendo that looks worse and falls apart.  HMO Miku is the only one I like, and that's because she comes with a shitload of accessories.      Not him, but they just always look either boring as fuck, or ridiculous to me.    Yes /toy/ have TF generals, I just wondering if Buyfag likes TF MP or not    She never even made it to the PS4  ;_;      Probably before I get my KWSM    If there's a god, never.    I like how this one actually has a sense of volume to it and looks decent in both forms as opposed to those shitty ones that look really awkward when transformed. Not too big on these so I don't know, maybe there's better ones out there.  Price tag is a little hefty for my tastes though.      Don't be like that, anon.       My ears hurt just from looking at pictures of her. Whoever thought up her character should be executed for crimes against humanity.      Yeah, I want her too    There's probably some sculptor out there who has a fetish for giantesses and motherly women who don't act their age, and a manager who will okay that piece.  I don't see any sculptor being okayed to make a modest christmas cake idol unless it's part of a set like Phat's Takane.       TOM and the rest of the M.A.G buy it   all the other anime related boards get purged   crunchy account needed to post    posting anime screenshots or manga pages will get you banned    nyaa and co. will trigger the spam filter   stream shilling everywhere    you can't post in threads about series that aren't licensed in your country   this site is brought to you by aniplex, thank you for supporting the industry :^)            That'd probably make buyfag better though.    290k, 100k, 140k  Fuck, Japan loves their red-headed dolls.    Any buyfag supporting licensed garbage might as well kill itself.     hurrr Takane is a granny  I want this meme to stop. If someone is a christmas cake from the old cast it's Piyo-chan and maybe Azusa, at least if you have some retarded arbitrary definition where everyone over 20 is too old for you.      Japan loves their red-headed dolls  And yet I can't find a good one of Kurisu     Takane is fucking 18.    Takane is not a granny but you cant tell me that the phat takane figure doesnt look like a granny. Its the only figure from their im@s line that i find really disappointing. Well yayoi's face looks retarded but i heard its fine in person but i dont own it so i cant say.     Always trust your dick.   Yeah I thought it was pretty obvious when people said that they were talking about the figure, not Takane herself, but I guess not.    Where did you get that from and why is it so blurry? Is it legit from an artist who does sculpts for figures or just a personal work?    So we should only buy bootleg things? Or did you mean to say something else, but just said it in a retarded way.  It doesn't matter her actual age, the only thing that matters is who will buy the figure and what impression that figure gives on the buyer.       you cant tell me that the phat takane figure doesnt look like a granny  I don't think she looks like a granny. I always just thought she looked refined. I never even thought granny until it came up in these threads.     People would just buy more shit from series they have never heard about, leading to more autistic arguments, killing these threads once and for all. Also no buying from filthy resellers anymore, only valid partner shops allowed who faithfully contribute to your local economy.      not recognizing the filename  it's from the premier source of figure sculpts called  pixiv     I just want Phat to make Azusa and Ritsuko already, is that too much to ask?   People call her granny in other threads too, not just here where it might be only in regards to the figure.    It's the shawl. Nobody under the age of 60 wears a god damn shawl these days. Not one like that, anyway.    I wear shawls, I think they're comfy.  Fuck am I an old woman?      There's a difference between a shawl and a jizz blanket, anon.    cancelled 1st AmiAmi order this month   feel like utter scum     I meant localized.    I would rather have more Ranko figures first. Perhaps one with her being darknessed from behind by her tomodachi     I'd love Ranko or Kaede figures but I will always want my 765 girls first.       Girlfriend  As long as her name is Amico.     you can cancel up to 4/5 before getting banned.    those red heads have nothing on this rozen slut    that's just delusional, I saw her in YAJ for around 290-310K    Well that's a 1/1 doll; of course there's no comparison.   Do I buy the Houki?      £176 fot a bit of plastic     we made that crap in DT for pennies        I ordered something by accident once, and I couldn't bring myself to cancel it.   Her nose is too big, yuck I don't think she looks that different compared to my grandma's dolls.   That's a SD, if you want vanishing noses you need to look at DDs.     There will never be a doll that properly captures the Rozen's faces.     I know, my point is that you could get some doll who resembles her for far less.     oh god. Could you imagine that fuck'in thing walking around?     If its exclusive that really would suck.      Bought a PS4   Forgot about my preorders on amiami   Oops might get banned       is that shit still an exclusive      go in fetal position and cry, you dun goofed      choosing ps4 over figures  I hope you will.     you probably would get used to it. certainly prettier than many pets people keep around.    Walking around, demanding tea, attacking your shins ...    I have cancelled 5 orders, after the last one I got a warning.    cute!    It actually takes a lot to get banned. People here just try to scare you.    several Revy figures   a Roberta one   a Balalaika one   no Sawyer one  Life is suffering.       Thanks, it's not like I wanted to sleep today anyway.    I'll just wait for GSC's reply that my order has been cancelled and that my account is banned for non payment.   A gal I know cancelled 22 orders at amiami, but then again she had over 10K points at the same store   use your credit card (If they accept them)    Pretty sure that Commercial/Spam just gets reported like any other rule violation now. I don't think it actually changes anything in terms of moderation, rule violations are rule violations.    I got banned for posting a youtube's link to a figure review (which wasn't even mine)   Alleyne by Megahouse.   Boy this site just gets worse and worse.    Still not as goos as the OS one    Based off of this art.    I was going to try that next if Paypal didn't work, I'm pretty sure they accept them.    I'm getting bored of my ps4    The post was still got deleted. Results matter.    Is blush like this really that hard to do with a pad printer? How come we always get like three blush lines on each cheek instead.   So, I could get banned if I post a Mandarake or Amiami link?  Has anyone here cancelled "all future orders" spanning over multiple months, before?  Curious as i've been out of work for awhile, made pre-orders before I was redundant, and am in a situation whedre a bunch of those orders are coming up, mounting into the 100,000's of yen in total, something obviously an unemployed person can't afford.  I mean, obviously I can just not pay, but has anyone cancelled a large amount like that and not been banned?        once it's finished  Truly the worst kind of fan. Leaving the publication with a shrinking number of copies and untimely death.    <br/>  Does Fukuoka Manda still undervalue?   Nowa is better.  Please more Nowa.     I actually think she looks nice.   Wo is here   It's not even like they posted a referral link Saying that a store has an item e to no benefit to themselves is hardly even shilling, especially when the shop in question is an official retailer, resulting in a far cheaper price than any other forwarder you guys paying forty extra dollars for. It's no different than the mentions of something going up on AmiAmi.      I canceled almost all my orders with Amiami before. It was around 10 orders. I'm not sure how much you plan to cancel but they were fine with mine.    Take a proper picture, not one with your shit cellphone    Worst elf.  Call me when they make some more Echidna.      people who buy your figure on ebay with a 1 feedback account and ask for no tracking shipping, and then don't pay when you refuse.   people who buy your $3 item on ebay, and then buy your $300 item on ebay and send you a fake payment received email.  Not sure if this is better or worse than having to deal with teenage girls on mfc.     I don't really like the streamlining, gives me the feeling that they just delete stuff that has enough reports without even looking at it anymore.    I'd say worse because at least you don't have to deal with eBay's shitty fees on MFC.     using ebay  I found your problem.     Blue elfs are better    This is not true you goddamn idiot. When will people realize that it's not the same for everyone?  There are three main influences that decide whether or not you get banned, and those are as follows: how much you've spent on their store, the mood of whoever reads your sorry e-mail/sees that you've ignored your payment notices, and lastly how often your dumb ass has made a stupid order that you had to cancel.      sorry elves    So if i've spent 10k USD in the past year, I should be fine?    I guess so, just send them an email explaining your situation.    Echidna also comes in that flavour.    If this is your first cancellation, then yes, you will most likely be fine.    Shit man, I basically only buy manga when I'm in Japan and was planning on buying whatever had come out since last time when next I went. I just didn't feel like typing out the entire situation like I'm fucking blogging.    I've gone through 3 accounts so I'm an experienced canceler, pal.     send you a fake payment received email.  What the fuck? people do that?     Why don't you apply for a loan, I got 4k the past month, and I'm buying like crazy .     Taking out a loan to buy Chinese plastic  Don't do this.     Talk about being an unresponsible moron.    thats not a slope that's a steep cliff    Keep it up, anon. You're the pride of the thread, sacrificing your future for the sake of PVC.    RIP       Shit cellphone is fine. Just take it in direct sunlight.     If it gives you any comfort, they were probably already doing that if such was the case.   Anyone ordering this?   Shitty fees don't matter, because Ebay is a global marketplace and you can charge well over those shitty fees. I get that 1000 free listings ad like every month.     FunnyKnights  Literally who?    I got all these for 60 at a local dvd store Did I do good?    There's worse. Some faggot in a previous thread didn't go to the dentist because he wasn't sure if a figure is going to get delayed. That's like pants on head retarded.    So which would you rather give up to obtain PVC? Your teeth or your credit rating?    kongou is my waifu, but I will not be ordering it. Funnyknights havent made much, and what they have made certainly isnt worth 14k. If it were 8k I would jump on it. Also  that mouth  I dont have much hope for Phat's Kongou either. Please wonfes give me an actual good Kongou.      Neither because I'm not a retard.    My exwife already ruined my credit score but I have enough PVC to fill a large mausoleum.    Excel is good shit     my waifu   nor getting everything fir the shrine  My waifu is rikka and I got every damn bad qc, stupid pose, dumb face, and low quality figure that existed of her and spent stupid amounts of money regardless of quality. If she's your waifu, she's worth it      I disagree. I've got some mediocre figures that have grown on me over time, but if it's just plain terrible I wouldn't buy it.    ill wait till it bins. Not gonna waste the money. Thats $120 I could save for an actual good release.     have a waifu   buy even the stuff that shits on her image and name just because   You're worse than shit as a husbando.       Like you're mom.     My waifu is rikka    kongou is my waifu      WTF is wrong with you guys? Why the hell are you wasting money on such cheap chinese made statues of lewd anime girls. Are you mental or something?   Quality over quantity. Why buy things that look like shit you don't even like?   I preordered a thing.   I have taken my first step into a larger (and more terrifying) world.     Oh you troll them hard, kid    What does the World Taekwondo Federation have to do with buyfagging?

Also maybe a new hammock.       implying you wouldn't hire a native British bean farmer to feed the coffee directly to her   You cuck.      ...why British? Is British coffee really good or something?

It couldn't be gayer.   Isn't he backwards?    It just looks awkward like every other EL art. LM art is at least in character. Anything to please the Landwhales I suppose.    NO, NO NO NO  hetshit = leave      Make show about alternate world Yuki Nagato   Make every other character in the show more interesting   Haven't bothered to watch the past 3 episodes, should I just drop it? Anyone else dropped it already?   Asakura is fantastic, at least.       GOATsakura was always best, it just took an SoL series for the slowplebs to realize it  At least watch the onsen episode.   If you like the other characters, keep watching up until episode 10. The show becomes more about them than Yuki, and it's pretty fun.  After that it's full Yuki tedium though.       I watched up to like episode 9 or something. It's OKAY thanks to Asakura being amazing, Haruhi being a delicious bitch, Tsuruya and Mikuru being cuties, etc.   Even Koizumi is more interesting than Yuki and he hardly has any scenes.      It's worth watching for Asakura, and then it gets actually good when Yuki gets hit by a car.   And I don't mean just her personality changing, the show feels different in other aspects too. Does anyone have episode director info? I usually use ANN for it but it doesn't have it yet, and AniDB is weird incomplete.        It's worth watching for Asakura   More like, Asakura makes the show tolerable when Haruhi, Mikuru and Tsuruya are missing; they are the show's real stars.    gets good when Yuki gets hit by a car.  Well, this is very subjective and debatable. But I agree to an extent; the episodes have a Haruhi S2 feel to them.         Haven't bothered to watch the past 3 episodes  I want to believe you're just trolling, since that's when things finally start focusing on Yuki's character more.   Dragon Ball Super twitter updated!  There’s 10 days remaining until Dragon Ball Super‘s July 5th debut! Until then, we’ll be counting down with daily content! For today, we’ve got… a nearly complete promotional poster! We’ve hung it up next to Kai (S)    its gonna be shit   definitely    I don't give a shit what it's about just seeing dragon ball animated makes me fucking happy    Gohan will be an irrelevant useless character  I want to believe he'll do something cool for more than 3 seconds but I won't set up myself to be disappointed   if cell absorb gohan ssj2 , what happen ?   So much this.    WHERE DID YOU GET THIS!?     Yamcha's hair   Can't it go back to being spiky again?      Not even Toriyama knows who the black kid is in the front   Looking kinda fat there, alternate universe Beers.    Gohan will be an irrelevant useless character  As he should.     GT confirmed canon.    Super Saiyan loli Bulla and Pan when?    Whoa I didn't knew Mr. Popo had a child...    At least he's actually in the marketing this time   So, what is the synopsis or plot of this?   Chichi and Bulma aged like shit. Krillin won big time with an immortal wife.    No bullshit SOL filler tier shit look it up the first episode is straight up Goten and Trunks looking for a present for fucking Videl.   So, Toriyama was upset at how Toei depicted Goku as a goody-two-shoes instead of a battle crazed asshole. I wonder if he'll be using Super rectify that.   BotG and RoF stretched out for 2 seasons.    Holy shit, Future Trunks is coming back?   Why is Roshi still alive  He isn't really a turtle right?    With BotG being retconned, will we still have loli Mai? This is important.   it's the new eyecatch during the epilogue episodes    I believe he found something in his youth that either made him immortal or just really expanded his life.    mfw people still like this shit.    We need more loli Mai, RoF disappointed me with the lack of her.    Yeah, I read that chapter of the adaptation.  Is this really a thing? Are they actually retconning the two new movies? Seems like a fucking waste. BoG was the best thing in the franchise in decades.      He's inmortal.    OMG! So bra is a canon character!? &gt;dies!    fat Beerus   grill Whis     Literally eternal life   I don't think they're retconning it. Just retelling it   She's in the manga you retard           being this casual   it literally is a major plot point in the DB   the summer is real       When he was younger he drank some mystic water from Fortunteller Baba that made him age slowly. But he can die in actualy battle.    And here are older    It's like no one has a brain in these threads it's hilarious. DB thread = the most plebiest of plebs, where's my popcorn.     Nigga never read the manga.   watched bra from the GT series.    Thought they never had a daughter.

I'm out before this thread is closed.     rinse and repeat!      it literally is a major plot point in the DB  It is?  I think he just brings it up like once or something       I never knew casual until I read Dragon Ball threads but boy do I keep getting proven wrong.  I wonder if anybody still thinks Bardock is a brilliant scientist who created the whole Fake Moon thing      It's so cool that Steven Seagal made a cameo on DBZ   What's the funniest anime you've watched? Pic related for me. Or D-Frag.  Boku no Pico   Easy   I would have to say season 1 of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.  But, I think the single funniest episode of anime is episode 9 of Lucky Star. Both the main segment and Lucky Channel are hilarious.  Gintama and Noucome also have some funny episodes.        Gintama   some funny Episodes    some   More like all of them       Cromartie High School or Daily Lives of Highschool Boys  gekkan shoujo followed by barakamon   Yeah sure if you like family guy tier epic references.   While I usually have a hard time ranking comedies, I can be certain to say this is the anime I find to be the funnierestest I've watched so far.   Nichibros is first for me, but sabagebu! Is a very close 2nd. Third would prob be nichijou.   Milky Holmes.    D-Frag.  I just can't understand why people thought that "yelling MC, the show" was entertaining.     pic related and sexy commando   Galaxy Angel   Fuck off idiot, who the fuck do you think you even are? Waltzing into this thread, pushing your beliefs and taste upon others? You're slime. Bottom of the barrel. Purposeless. You're nothing but something to be walked on. When did you get such a fucking ego, thinking that you're at all important? I swear, I eat kids like you for fucking breakfast. Please, trot on out of this thread, for your own good. Your presence here disgusts me, since all you look for is some sort of purpose, some attention. Well, here's your attention, punk. Negative attention. Never before have I seen somebody as desperate as you for attention, yet here you are, posting shitty comic stills and talking out of your ass in the most provocative of terms you can muster. It's not working faggot.   Nichijou  And the manga is even better.       Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei     All of these, plus Tesagure.        Cromartie High Usami-chan episodes of Gag Manga Biyori Detroit Metal City    DMC for first, Nichijou is more enjoyable but a close second in terms of humor.     And FMP Fumoffu     yondemasu azazel-san or Nichibros   Azazel.   Seconding Gag Manga Biyori, DMC, and D-Frag. Korean Zombie Desk Car was also quite entertaining.   Mistudomoe (season 1) is the most hilarious show I've seen in recent memory.  Season 2 is good but not as funny as S1    Love Lab.   Thanks for reminding me to check if the specials have been subbed yet.    ... Nope.       Patrician.    Neptune    While it had funny moments, it can't be taken as a comedy anime.    angel beats and baka to test had me in stitches    Then what the fuck did I watch last week?    reported     kissanime.com   Never used it, it's good enough to use and not a honeypot? All I know is KAT and Nyaa don't have anything past 3 (1 batch is on Nyaa from a amautuer group, but I'm not downloading 3Gb for an hour of ova content poorly subbed)      I take it back, it's a streaming site that uses youtube. Bleh, I'll just watch them on youtube if the quality is fine.    Sabagebu, yep.  Danna ga is up there too.     The interactions between Hiramaru and Yoshida from Bakuman always had me laughing   It doesn't use YouTube, it uses a near carbon-copy of YouTube's player.  you can tell since it uses only flash, unlike HTML5 like youtube's player      &gt;unlike HTML5 like youtube's player And even THEN you can switch from Flash/YouTube to basic HTML5 playback.      The fourth one has been up on Nyaa for over a week now.    Ah, I see it now. The important thing is there are 6, and it's still not all there.    By the looks of it, the last two should be up by mid-August, at least from Anime Koi   Squid Girl / Shinryaku! Ika Musume      why the fuck don't you guys just stream the episodes if you wanna watch it so bad. If quality is an issue then I can only assume you're autistic       Speaking of this, is there going to be an OVA this summer?     Speaking of this will the second season will ever be released on DVD? (the dubs already exists but are not released on DVD)       If quality is an issue then I can only assume you're autistic   Yep, only autistic people have quality standards. If you're pro-streaming, what sites do you use for things like the Sabagebu specials? Kissanime had shit-looking plain subtitles that have badly worded sentences, they didn't sub the OP or ED (which already have available subs and since the video is hardcoded there is no excuse not to add them), the quality is poor (acceptable, compared to most), and I like to keep what I watch because if it's any good I'll rewatch it in the future. Streaming is just as illegal as torrenting (100%) so I might as well get something to keep out of it (higher quality perfect files I can view offline).      There is episode 6. Where to you think Kissanime gets it from?    Funniest? Hard to choose, I seen so many and love them all, but I go for Haganai, watched it over 10 times, still enjoying it like the first time.    Did they just take it from the 3Gb amatuer release? That would explain the mistakes in the subs, at least. I'm watching the kissanime version for now, but I would never download/store/collect something this flawed. I'll wait for a good release.  Pic related and Panty and Stocking are both the "funniest" anime to me, not that they're the "best" or highest quality comedy. I prefer Nichijou and such, but not for purely comedy reasons.     Pic related   ctrl+f   no Bobobo-bo   you fucks and your shitpleb tastes...   also this         It's a shame this chan doesn't let us have big or audio webm, there's an amazing 7mb sena webm I love to post on "double4"chan.    I liked bobobo.... when I was a kid watching Cartoon Network.  Does it really hold up? I'm all for random humor the way Nichijou does it, but from what I remember Bobobo is mostly characters screaming and random shit happening for no reason.      I watched the first two or three episodes of Haganai and just feel very middling about it, does it get better as it goes?  I want to like it really badly but it's kind of a bore as of now.      Japan is generally fucking awful at comedy.    Not who you replied to, but I love it. It's a kind of parody, especially later on in the 2nd season. It subverts a lot of the shit that goes on, and the MC isn't nearly as clueless as he lets on as you'll find near the end of season 2. If you didn't really like it, it doesn't change too much once the "full group" gets together, outside of new bit characters.  Even though 4chan hates dubs, the dub was pretty good too.       D-Frag   Funny   that show is literally the same joke for 12 episodes  -Somebody says something outlandish -Main character shouts -rinse and repeat  the girls are cute though.              characters screaming and random shit happening for no reason.  what else could you possibly ask for?   btw this was unexpectedly funny, drama/ romance aside        I actually like dubs if they're decent enough so I might give it a go dubbed and see if I like it better.    Just use whatever they have instead of pomf now   Probably Danshi Koukousei  And I really liked Jinsei, sue me     Keep watching, is not only funny but the thing that amaze me the most is how well written the characters are, and of course, you gotta see the plot twist in the end of season 1, it really will change your whole perspective of the series.    Yeah, the characters sound right to me at least. The MC has a boring voice, but he's supposed to be extremely boring so it fits perfectly. The cute girls get cute voices, and the annoying bitch nun gets an annoying bitch voice. The only thing I really didn't like was that Rika kept that thing anime loves where a wacky character speaks in third person and constantly says their own name, anything that isn't Cowboy Bebop annoys me when a character does it.   Probably Ranma 1/2   I watched it when I as much younger, I don't know if now I watch it again it would be still that funny   Some of the recent shows are D-frag, Yuru Yuri, Hayate No Gotoku       Simple:  Fumoffu!      The season 1 plot twist didn't really shock me (the one that was foreshadowed the whole season? Or am I thinking of something else?).  The season 2 (NEXT) twist on the roof got me though, I had to rewatch every episode to notice all the shit MC-kun does on purpose because of it.     I don't know if I could pick a funniest. but Cromartie is the one that has made me laugh out loud the most in recent memory   Hell yeah, SYD rules.    the girls are cute though   more like funabori should have her own spinoff cause she's the cutest one        After all these years Guru guru is still a masterpiece of the comedy anime, then again Cromartie, Girls High, Nichibros, Milky Holmes and Sabagebu are also great.    Is there a reason/joke that he has those weird cat-like lip curls? They never mentioned it, it bothered me more than the purple hair, which they constantly joked with.  Cromartie is great, I've always loved that cool faggot Freddie Mercury, so when I found out there was an anime with him I watched it immediately.     I rate my comedy based on the number of funny faces.   that goldfish episode in fumoffu was fucking hilarious   This, but then again I am a flaming faggot.  Galaxy Angel, through the 5 or so seasons they did every slap stick comedy premise known to man.   Both plot twist were amazing for me.  I was talking about how Yozora planned everything and the original purpose of the neighbor club and all her point of view of the situation, she had already give up on life at that point when she see Kodaka after 10 years, man, I had to watch the whole season again.      is it worth it to watch this if fate/stay night is the only type moon thing I am familiar with?   Detroit metal city   If it's on a streaming site there's a downloadable version available you fucking retard. These people just don't want to torrent the shit subs that the streaming sites have used for OVAs 5 and 6.    Yes, I agree. Nothing can surpass the glory of superior American humor.   Bazinga!     Azazel-san, Sunred, Cromartie and for somehow Binbougami-ga all made me laugh, even though I usually find comedy anime really dry.   streamfags, dubfags and epic anniemay recommendations  Is this Reddit?      No, this is Patrick.  Like if you got that reference      And they still managed to make every girl is best girl in a good way.    have an upboat   This cracked me up as a kid. I probably wouldn't be able to enjoy it as much now   Well you'll miss about half of the jokes but you can always just rewatch it after you've watched Tsukihime.    no this is 4chan  you seem confused anon     Beelzebub, I dont think many people have watched it.  I couldn't help laughing like a retard through most of nichibros   eat a shoe, nerd    This, hands down.     kissanime  I'll rather kill myself, thanks.      I can only assume you're autistic  You're on /a/. You should consider the default state of everyone posting here to be autistic.      watched Tsukihime  I'm very confused. Do you mean "read"?      azazel-san  good to see someone finally posted this.       watched Tsukihime.   Nice joke anon.       Then watch Etotama, it will be the best anime ever made for you.    Are you a paedophile?    Ah, I see what you mean. I guess I just sort of assumed that stuff because that scene didn't really shock me, things like the way that character acted (past and present) and details like the bizarre poster design for the club just made me figure it out early. I had no clue on the season 2 one though, either way Haganai absolutely has good twists, and plenty of reasons to rewatch.   If we ever get S3 (even though it's supposed to be terrible and have a horrible mean twist) I'll love watching it. Does anyone know if the books finished yet, or at least passed the point of another season's worth of finished content?     poorly disguised rec thread   ...why would it be a honeypot?     Eh, I'm drunk. Give me a break.     If you're deadset on never getting into Tsukihime (the VN, don't fuck with the adaptation) then you might as well watch it now. The characters you don't know aren't that hard to understand, and usually the two sets of characters are separated enough/    M-MASA SAN~    no Rapeman  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s3F<wbr>3RvWX2g4</wbr>  [ ]    that's mean anon, his is face is burned.    Dubs have been getting better and better, and now that we're getting some dubs same day as the Jap dub, there's no reason to ignore them. Hate all you want, your secret club of exclusive hardcore anime lovers isn't here. Go learn Japanese if you want to be the ultimate weeaboo, you're like someone who loves cars and criticizes everything the car companies put out but you only use a manual transmission.    It's dangerous to shitpost alone, take this.     defending dubs  back to Reddit with you     you can tell he isn't trolling and is just summer because of his tabs.  what a sad day      I didn't know anything about it, but I know I never see it mentioned on /a/. That means it's either shit or a honeypot.    The only good dubs are pic related and Cromartie.     blindly hating dubs  back to 2ch with you. Oh wait, you don't understand Japanese, you fucking pleb weeaboo.     I think with the 11 volume it will be enough material for a second season, if it include CONNECT too, we can only hope, maybe 2016 is the year.    Original will always be better than the imitation, retard. Specially considering how awful Amerifat voice actors tend to be compared to the rest of the world.    Baccano!, Fate/Zero, Cowboy Bebop, and a few dozen other really good ones would like to talk with you.   Hell, all comedy is much better when you understand the language and can catch all of the puns and understand the way things are said. Joke books suck because you can't tell emotion or delivery from text, and subbed is better because you can hear gibberish, but it isn't as good as simply knowing what is being said.  Some dubs (mainly old ones) are shit, but newer ones are usually fine.        You're right, the original Japanese is better than your shitty read-along subbed shit.   Subs are just Dubs that the producers were too lazy to finish.      You can't be this stupid.    this entire thread  I want to fucking die    why don't you just  check'em     These monkeys are you guys, who can't accept that we have dual audio files now and don't have to sub VHS tapes. Times have changed, dubs get better and better every year as directors and actors get more experience and more actors enter the scene. There's no reason to cling to the ways of the past, you won't be punished for enjoying a dubbed anime.    pic related   Working!! 2   GSNK   Kokkuri-san   Cromartie   And a few more I can't name right now because my mind gets clogged when I try to name my favorites.         I don't give a shit about dub because I know moon runes, but saying that about subs is pretty stupid.   The thread was going so good, what happen?   I hate to say this, but summer happened.    Are you fucking joking? The probability of any given dub being a good dub has been steadily decreasing for years now. The last good dub I can think of was Redline, and it was only on par with the Japanese version, not better.    The thread was a rec thread from the beginning.    If you know moon runes you can experience the original material, you don't have to bother with subs or dubs.   Most of us have to choose, and I remember almost 20 years back when I had to pay a friend to borrow a VHS tape, and if it sucks, too bad. Back then we had a reason to be adamant about subs only, but dubbing has gotten better and if we don't like a specific dub we can go back to the subs as a safety net. Less and less dubs are "bad" now, they might not usually be as good as the unaltered Jap dubs, but subs aren't as good either.       Fate/Zero dub   good  Kill yourself      People say this every year, and every year it's proven wrong. Traffic doesn't increase in the summer, moot said so and the statistics say so. There's no way we lose a ton of good people that get replaced by "summer fags", it's just that this place is always shit. the 8th chansite is better.    I used subs for a ton of time in order to understand better Japanese, it worked, I wouldn't be able to do that with dubs.   but subs aren't as good either.  Indeed, I went to a point where I could see little things that were missing in the subs.       Mah nigga    recommendation thread   131 replies  What the fuck, /a/?      Traffic doesn't increase in the summer  Didn't you consider the possibility some anons go away from the site in the fear of summerfags or another motives while the summerfags enter?     What was bad about it? Every character fit pretty damn well, and characters like Rider that need emotion to come through in their voices work perfectly. I watched Fate/Zero subbed when it was new and dubbed later on, the dub is just as good if not better.  Go ahead, point out the characters that suck, I've provided a cast image so you can recall.      Relax, it's summer :^)    didn't you consider I already mentioned that in my post? I said    There's no way we lose a ton of good people that get replaced by "summer fags", it's just that this place is always shit        shilling for cripplekike after he tried to flood his site with redditors   Really desperate that your /a/ is dying, huh?       Traffic doesn't increase in the summer  Who ever said that the site being flooded by summerfags means the traffic would increase?     Yeah, but do you have anything to back that up?    I'm sure subs are better as a learning tool, but this isn't about learning Japanese, it's about watching entertaining shit. If you watch dubs you don't have to bother learning in the first place, even though I fully agree the best route is learning Japanese if you're a big enough weeaboo.       There's no way we lose a ton of good people  I think is more like the good people are in other threads while in the most popular show ones the summerfags are shitposting like crazy.    Plastic nee-san probably Or kill me baby     :^)  You can fuck off with your epic memes, too.     Do you have anything that says otherwise? I don't remember an anon ever mentioning "it's fall/winter, I'm back since the newfags have left".  After all, if the newfags simply get better over the summer and learn how to act, the number would RISE when the oldfags returned, right? If we got a boost in the summer but we didn't notice because the same number of people took a break, the number would rise significantly when they came back.       I think is more like the good people are in other threads while in the most popular show ones the summerfags are shitposting like crazy.  It's just going to get worse. Last year, Naruto threads would get saged to hell. Now that it's allowed, it's the cancer is freely allowed to flow in.     Fuck you nigger. Post dank maymays or fuck off    our /a/ is great, we have plenty of traffic and 8/a/ threads can have large webm with audio, it makes OP/ED threads amazing since we can simply post the OP/ED as a part of the post.  At least we still HAVE our cripple, moot is dead as far as 4chan is concerned.      The current anime of the season is a dub. http://a.uguu.se/labusm.webm      I don't remember an anon ever mentioning "it's fall/winter, I'm back since the newfags have left".  Stopped reading there. You're on /a/, blogging is on encouraged. Go back to your shitty cancerchan.      It can't be helped at this point, luckily the shows I like are always unpopular so the same 20~30 anons are the ones watching them.    You're lucky, but in the end, that's just avoiding the problem. At some point, /a/ might fall to the cancer if it's ignored.    You wouldn't need to shill for that shithole here if this was true.  Everyone is abandoning cripplekike's reddit frankestein. The number of active users speak for themselves.      /a/ fell to the cancer the moment moot became a jew and sided with that feminist Anita chick. A lot of the good posters went to 8/a/ instead of 4/a/.    This. Who the fuck would go to their /a/ if there are better alternatives in case /a/ dies?   Fucking /v/ and their retarded free speech gamergate problems. You were told to fuck off back then when you tried to involve /a/. Why do you continue this bullshit?        I'd rather browse fucking Reddit than go to your little shithole, only because of you shills.    The number of active users looks fine to me, I post in threads in 8/a/ every day. If anything it's better because you have more than a minute before a thread is bumped too far off of the front page to recover. Hey, it's even partnered with 2ch to be the official worldwide chansite, so I'd say it's doing just fine.    Does cripplekike pays you to shill here? Top lel. Every board is suffering a massive drop in UID's after he was revealed to be bending over to redditors to no one's surprise.   ITT we post a character without actually posting them.  I'll start with something easy.    uhh The main bitch in monogatari?     this one's easy    main bitch    easiest one of entire thread     Monogatari girls.    that could be from any fucking anime be more especific    What the fuck did I just watch  In the very first PV there were some cuts that weren't in the anime. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tLI<wbr>ppl9GlX4</wbr>  [ ]  Particularly, Ito's scenes and Strange Juice near the end. Game cutscene?      BUY  THE GAME      Good old brown Rabura.     there will never be a new episode of punchline for the rest of your life      tfw no more AOTS next week    Reminder that you should get a PS4/Vita http://punchline-game.jp/  Also https://www.cs-reporters.com/vr/pun<wbr>chline/</wbr>       mc has chance for perfect ending   decides to die instead      I'm going to buy a Vita if the game comes out in English. Punch Line will make me cross the line.     Will there be English subtitles?    He should've got the harem end     triple zeros  ZERO ESCAPE 3  CONFIRMED       They didn't explain the cat.  So wait, the real Yuuta a.k.a Pine decided not to return to his real body and died, leaving Guriko alive right? Then the ghost Yuuta went back 25 years in the past and did the whole Fax thing right? Then he went back and possessed himself to start the whole time looping thing so the future would be peaceful did I understand that correctly? Does this mean that the premise of the peaceful future is the time loop? Also who was cat?   He's a cuck.    Or Tsubouchi.   There has to be a second season.     The fuck was the point of the cat?  The cat was the superior officer right? Being possessed. But then he talks like it's Tsubouchi Qmay.   What the hell?       Yes.  And the cat was a cat.       There has to be a second season.  There'll never be a second season, you're supposed to play the game if you want the rest.      triple zeros     But it's in Japanese. ;_;       Americans       well who was possessing cat?    THE CUTEST    The time lines are split into infinite realities. Every bad end was a different time line.  Yuuta chose the happy ending in the show, but didn't get the true end.     WILL THE GAME HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES?  ANSWER ME, /a/.     your mom    I'm a britbong.    Yes, we get the short end of the stick      Localization and dub   I wish        Not knowing moon already       We can't get all our answers, anon    I'm European, tho.    I'm not liking the 3d models.      I just want subs. ;_;   It wouldn't even take them long to implement it in the Japanese version.      Me neither. Though didn't they say that they wouldn't be the final ones? Hopefully?    Not even in VR? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bmH<wbr>w0gW05Wc</wbr>  [ ]     In that case you'll never get it and will have to rely on the off chance that Xseed or Atlus brings it to murrika. Then you have to pray doubly hard none of the localization team finds anything problematic.    I hope you're not a Britbong calling yourself European, although technically correct due to geography, we never call ourselves European.    I'd like something similar to Danganronpa: Another Episode    The coronel was Qmay all along (notice him wanting to find Muhi). You need to remember Guriko liked to Qmay and thus, he didn't know Ws were completed (That's why he wanted the bear)    Nope, I'm Finnish.    We Euros got the SK franchise, and SV is way lewder than Punchline   Smiles were not protected. I didn't ask for this.  GOAT anime. I think so.  I'm glad it's over.   How did the smelly NEET even end up in that position?    They were happy   Reminder that Ito hasn't changed her panties in at least 10 days  Ten days    Fucking loved this show from start to finish. This is how I remembered good animu. Sadly it will do shit because Japan always has shit taste.   Okay, it was a fucking 10/10 on fire season 2 when?     Buy the game.   Meh 6/10 had some nice moments. Maybe the VN will be better   She's just has a lot of panties that are similar    Same here but I give it a 5/10.    I said season 2. who the fuck cares about shitty games, I want animation ANIMATION     How long did she wear the ones she gave as an offering?     Ichikawa: Flight Unit, who is well-known for their quality when it comes to 3D characters, is being tasked with those. However, the character models we have now are not the final versions. We plan to make better ones, so please look forward to them.     no yuuta harem end   2/10, would suggest it on MAL     Derischas    It will have a harem end in the game    They aren't animated yet    It won't be a VN, so it will be better for sure  can fly around the apartment and peek pantsu on your own      So tgeres still one thing I still dont get. Why does out of body Ubafying cause the asteroid to drop? Was there ever any explanation for this?    You should rewatch the whole thing if you didn't understand one of the most basic plot points.    the asteroid dropped because the asteroid dropped    No, when Yuta was a spirit, temporal physics don't apply to him so when he sees panties twice he gets unconscious and time jumps when the asteroid hit Earth    It doesn't, that was explained in the first fucking episode.  Yuta passes out, isn't able to save things, earth dies.      I'm I the only one who thinks girl Yuta is cute. Also what happened to the penis?    mfw also finished endless 8 today   One of those time loop days I guess     No penis. Only girls here.    The fuck are you smoking? The only one who has a dick is Guriko in Pine's body.    He wanted yuri-end, he's a fucking yurifag cancer.   Damn, it was weird as fuck seeing Churiko in her own body again, I could only imagine Yuuta. They should've made her breast bigger.   You're not watching. Fuck off    Watch/rewatch Madoka, Steins;Gate, and Space Dandy episode 10 while you're at it    BEST SHOW EVER!!!   btw what happened i didnt understand anything  New-neo-/a/      Not marathoning Endless 8  pleb     no overly long exposition spoonfeeding you the ending  Pretty unexpected, that's a surprisingly good finale for Uchikoshi. Maybe he's getting better at writing. Would be cool if he stops reusing time loop plot in every work, though.     It wouldn't be an Uchikoshi story without time shenanigans. That's only thing why I buy his stuff   That was fucking sick  The first few eps were pretty slow but it definitely made up for it, can't wait to rewatch     Rewatching makes the context different. It feels great.   Would you fuck mikatan in yuuta's body, or rather hers. Y/N?  So what was that exorcism at the end?   No, you thieving gaijin    Ya    Rabura is a trained exorcist, has been since the beginning. Qmay is an actual ghost, the evil spirit of a dead man. So she used whatever she knew and it worked for once.    Rabura is from a family of exorcists.      Qmay is an actual ghost, the evil spirit of a dead man  wait, when this was said exactly? wasn't his bearmigration possible only with technology?      It's explained in episode 7. It doesn't actually cause the asteroid to drop. Ghost Yuuta just passes out and wakes up after Guriko's keikaku succeeded   so anyone have any idea on what to do for the TRUE end  obvious shit would be to deal with that THE LIVING PLOT DEVICE bear    Damn it, I'm going to have to stop being lazy and learn japanese to read the true ending aren't I? I know the kana, and some words and grammar. But I keep slacking every time when it comes to grinding vocab and kanji.   Yeah, what did Qmay want to do with that bear    Qmay died in November, that was said in episode 3. So he spent a month living in people like Ito's teacher who he had a deal with.   So what was the punchline?   Teraoka told him that Muhi's ability was the key to becoming a W. Teraoka lied because he didn't like him but Qmay didn't know that.    some thing to regenerate the body of their old leader    Ah yeah, I forgot about that.   Anyone else think this was a pretty shit ending to an otherwise good show?  So is Pine in an infinite loop? Does she have to go back and keep reliving all this pain over and over again?  What a hard life.     No    Punchline is you sat through a shit show for 12 weeks.    No, it was pretty good. everything that doesn't go for the easiest happy everafter ending today is godsent    that you actually have to buy the game to get the real end    Why didn't you look at her punchline? now is too late   How to get true end is too predictable You can keep everything the same except you use muhi to make Pink become a W so the body doesn't die from yubafying    It's a different version of him each time, so it doesn't really matter    Too hard to explain; here a pic    W are immortal though. Living forever isn't good.    I felt it was a nice ending for a mediocre show, actually. Made sitting through the boring episodes in the middle worthwhile.    True end 1: pure love kinda yuri end with Yuuta and Mika   True end 2: shit goes south so Yuuta takes back his old body, uses the power of W to kick everyone's ass, and then achieves harem end.     Maybe I'm being paranoid, but does anyone else think pic related is suspicious? If aliens or something show up in the game, consider them called.   How do they even become W and why did they refuse to become W? Okay, they didn't want the world to end, but why not become a W if it's a straight-up power-up? Mikatan was dying and couldn't uberfy, so why not became a W and have her body healed?    Aliens appearing wouldn't be surprising.    AYE...   Is Teraoka X Mikatan considered yuri or hetero?   It's considered fuck you.    Yuri romance, het sex.    It would be region free, either way is fine.    *fuck /u/    it's considered never happening in a million years...    Futa    Good enough, I'll take it   She cut her hair. Maiden with a broken heart confirmed.     my actions has cost countless lives   I am going to atone for it by going on this peaceful hike through the countryside   The fuck Japan, why do you always do this shit?      RIP gay braid ;_;    Her life is ruined. She will have to become a fag if he wants to have sex with men.    I think Guriko is gonna try something to help the past yuta    I'm pretty sure a hike will do his mind good after literally a life of drugging and brainwashing and living in a crazy cult.   Fuck, that was great and that one anon wanting the silly dance got it too.   Guriko just didn't want to be alone ;_;   I just finished it. It was okay but the ending was a little weak in my opinion. With 999 and VLR the final twists are revealed at the end, things fall apart (or more accurately, are put in place) and there is an emotional climax. I think that Punch Line blew its load a little to early. All the twists were already revealed and the finale only served to move the plot towards the end, rather than have a revelationary aspect. It was too focused an the "action" part of the conflict. Also there was less tension in the climax than I think 999 had with the final sudoku puzzle. With the sudoku puzzle I felt that it tied everything together in a meaningful way that had a deep emotional payoff. Meanwhile, Punch Line ends with a mecha fight. Cool in its own right, but not having the same depth that I felt in this guys other works.
