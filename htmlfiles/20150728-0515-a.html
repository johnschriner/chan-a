I'm surprised Vega Tale is still even alive. What's the point of his existence anymore? He might as well be Yamcha at this point</br>  Cell can.  Yamcha can.  <br><br> Yamcha is actually a Saiyan <br> all the times he's been defeated has actually made him the potentially strongest Saiyan but he's never figured out how to train properly </br></br></br>  <br>I know, it's almost like DBZ is an anime.</br>  <br>That's why I said sudden you smartass , theres like 8 DBZ or DBZ related threads up right now.</br>  Who is Whis?  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explain yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Careful if you say things like that its gonna be time.</br></br>    <br>Just saying that even yaharifags contain themselves.</br>  <br>Even Narutofags contain themselves. But the rules are selectively enforced, so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>there should just be a faggy dbz general, or have the fucking mods make a damn sticky about this issue.</br>  <br>It's not bothering anyone though. Those threads just die in a few hours, really no different from the bait and shitposting we already had. <br><br>You know that you can just block them if they annoy you right?</br></br></br>  <br>and people can create generals as well.</br>  <br>Its not really annoying or anything , it just makes a lot of clutter of dead threads in the catalog , making a general would be a great since it provides more discussion and less clutter.</br>  <br>/a/ would sadden me if I didnt see at least 3 DB threads</br>  <br>There are people who gets annoyed when they see 10 different threads about the same topic.</br>  <br>Vegitto is like SSJ 4 transformation. It's already above SSJ 3 but far below SSJ 4. Vegitto transformation is not ki consuming like other SSJ transformation the same reason why SSJ 4 is more of permanent transformation and rarely have limited time. So they can be at that state in very-very long time or near permanent as long as they're not unconscious.</br>  <br>They can suck a boner</br>  <br>You should go somewhere else. /a/ isn't for you.</br>  <br>Wah, this thread isn't about softcore porn and moeblobs, I better throw a tantrum, that'll show em</br>  <br>Ok, quote the part of my post where I said that. Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Maybe you should because there always three up moeblob</br>  <br>Logic says that since Goku has the knowledge to perform the transformation then so should Vegito.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  That lightsaber move is cool as tits.  He Cant even die. He can literally just leave crumb size pieces of his body somewhere and regenerate from that in a few seconds. Punches don't work, energy blasts blast through him and he is like "whatever". Even the biggest spirit bomb in the series almost failed.  <br>The problem with Buu is that he was literally just a retreading of Cell.<br><br> he can regenerate! <br> he knows our attacks! <br> he absorbs people! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Cell was clearly getting hurt and tired as he fought. Buu on the other hand is complete bullshit since nothing even damages him unless it literally destroys every cell in his body all at once.</br>   Buu on the other hand is complete bullshit since nothing even damages him unless it literally destroys every cell in his body all at once. <br><br>Just like Cell. And my point wasn't really about power it was more how buu wass cell: pink edition.</br></br>    <br>Buu is more like an improved Cell. Cell cant absorb people as he pleases, he had a powerlevel cap which he hit absorbing the androids, while Boo absorb powers are limitless. And Cell actually can take blows unlike Buu which ends up absorbing the blows too with his elastic body.<br><br>Anyways the real enemies in DB are the saiyans, if they could stop beeing self centered assholes and protect the earth as they should they could have avoided the births of Cell and Boo to begin with. Maybe even Freeza, without the Namek battle, eventually Vegeta could have achieved SS to slap Freeza's shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Buu can actually reform from atomic particles. No cells needed. If Buu is even made of cells like a normal thing.</br>  <br> Could Vegito reach Super Saiyan 3 <br>In my country, it was translated that he's Super Saiyan 10</br></br>  Demonbane is the strongest DBZ character. Demonbane is the strongest everything.<br><br>Demonbane is love, Demonbane is life</br></br>  <br>Dandy already defeated Demonbane in an infinite number of universes.</br>  <br>How exactly?</br>  <br>Because Dandy exists in a Universe of every possibility, and in the universes Dandy loses to demonbane his mind just changes universes.</br>  No because Vegeta cant  <br> Saiyains being anything more than a proud warrior race.  <br><br>The mere thought is blasphemous.</br></br></br>    <br>Vegeta is weak anyway he cannot goes SSJ3 when trunks and gotenks can. So in multiplier coefficient vegeta is much weaker than gotenks and trunks.</br>  <br>Why goku is combine with vegeta. goten and trunks are muchstronger. They can go ssj 3 while vegeta only can reach SSJ 2 at most.</br>  <br><br><br>This thread got real Brazilian real quick.</br></br></br>  <br>Right back at you african nigger faggot.</br>  <br><br>Are you coming onto me?</br></br>  <br>Are you a racist white pig?</br>  <br><br>I'll be whatever you want me to be</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Good for you then Now you can go back to your cage.</br>  <br>Only if you come in here with me and throw away the key.<br><br>The suns coming up but that don't mean the fun's gotta stop.</br></br></br>  <br>Source? That's too fucking powerful. <br><br>I don't give a fuck, that must be Beerus level</br></br></br>  <br>  implying SSJ 3 fusion is strong <br>Just look how weak is gotenks.</br></br>  <br>Gogeta can probably defeat beerus too. He is not yet face any goku fusion related until now.</br>  <br>Neither kid had reached SSJ3 alone, and they were the dance fusion. Potara is stronger, Vegeta and Goku are stronger, and Goku has already mastered SSJ3.<br><br>Doesn't compare.</br></br></br>  <br>  asumption <br>It's just your asumption without proof. IN FACT There is no difference betwen going SSJ 3 in fusion or in normal state.</br></br>  <br>Post the assumption in my post.<br><br>Dance fusion drains Ki, hence the time limit. Potara multiplies both users energy while creating greater endurance. The Kais imply they could stay in SSJ3 indefinitely as Vegito, they'd just be shaving a few years off their life due to the immense pressure. That's far stronger than only keeping up the form for a few minutes.</br></br></br>  <br> Post the assumption in my post. <br>All your post is assumption!<br> The Kais imply they could stay in SSJ3 indefinitely as Vegito <br>Source and Wat?<br><br>Vegitto power level is just in your fanfic. Actually pottara user is infact is weak. looked how weak is kaioshin even with pottara earring. Pottara power in your post is just merely fanfiction because in fact the power is not strong. look how buu can dispell pottara earring and goku has not yet won again buu even under veggito. The earring is overrated because none of the user yet proved to be powerful. And the power of the earring is in fact is weak because it can EASILLY dispelled by buu power.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>one advantage cell has it that he has the hax sayian ability of getting stronger every time you almost die. and since he can regenerate from a single cell, its a pretty OP ability for the most part.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because there's a new Dragon Ball anime out?</br>  <br>  cannot use genki dama again <br>I don't think vegitto is a best move since he cannot use his strongest attack and the strongest attack in all dbz warrior. There is no attack that known can kill buu ultra regeneration and many other main villains regeneration except genki dama.</br></br>  <br>Probably, but at this point it would be better to go Super Cyan since both halves know it and it's most likely stronger than SSJ3</br>  <br>Trunks and Goten can't go SSJ3, but Gotenks can.</br>  <br>You can't be that stupid</br>  <br>There is no single proof that both goten or trunks cannot go ssj 3. and there is no proof that the fusion can change your level even 1 level higher than the state of the fusioner.</br>  Can two fused people fuse? Like, can Gogeta and Gotenks fuse to make Gogetanks?  <br>  stupid answer <br>You cannot be that idiot. fuck off newfag.</br></br>  Whose idea was it to design the most powerful being in the known universe as a flaming gay man?  <br>it cannot. fusion also cannot be done when they're not in sync both power level and dance. The height also will be a problem sync it will make the dance harder.</br>  <br> implying vegito wont reach SSJG at some point in super </br>  <br>  sync <br> since it will make the dance harder to be synchronized. </br></br>  Bernkastel can easily destroy DBZ for fun  <br>Everything you said is so off that I simply feel sorry for you to be that retarded. Go educate yourself, summer fag</br>  <br> cannot bring any proof <br>Go away idiot newfag. Your idiocy in this thread has made me cry. Go cry a river somewhere and bring your BULLSHIT! fanfic with you.</br></br>  <br>  crying because nobody believe his fanfic theory </br>  <br><br>Because we're not allowed to make Naruto threads.</br></br>  <br> He had a powerlevel cap which he hit absorbing the androids <br>Super Perfect Cell says otherwise.</br></br>  So I just started DB: Super and decided to also watch the movies that came out before it, regardless of whether they'll be canon or not.<br><br>Finished Battle of Gods but am having trouble finding a torrent for Resurrection F. Am I missing something? I thought it has been out for a while now.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about all that, but  Vegeta is undefeated against Goku .</br>    so bog isn't canon anymore because super overrides it right?  <br> actually pottara user is infact is weak. looked how weak is kaioshin even with pottara earring.  <br>Two weak gods fuse and are still weak. What a suprise<br> look how buu can dispell pottara earring <br>Buu had no idea that they would defuse inside of him. He ate them as last thing he could do against Vegito.<br> and goku has not yet won again buu even under veggito <br>He did not want to kill Buu as Piccolo, Gohan and kids were still inside of him<br> The earring is overrated because none of the user yet proved to be powerful. <br>I don't even, are you that stupid?<br> and the power of the earring is in fact is weak because it can EASILLY dispelled by buu power. <br>And again, you are wrong. By eating someone way stronger than Buu, you mean easilly? He ate Veggito only becouse he had to rescue z fighters inside of Buu, nothing else.<br><br>I know that this is bait, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup. It's weird also because super takes place 6 month yes some years in the future where BoG takes place videl has not gave birth to pan.</br>  <br>BoG was never canon in the first place. Super actually has a right to that claim (with the manga by AT even if he isn't drawing it). RoF is next on the list of shit to be 'retconned' (while not being canon to begin with).</br>    <br><br><br>Are you both stupid?<br><br>Videl has not given birth to Pan yet. Not in Battle of Gods, nor in Super.<br><br>Let's say she got pregnant after Z (after the fight with Boo she and Gohan got sexytime). Less than 9 months have passed until Resurrection of Frieza since Pan is not born.<br><br>That epilogue from DBZ is years down the line. I think 3 or 4 years after Z?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, up until Super both new movies were canon. It's just that they eventually decided a new series would bring better profits and now we have Super.</br>  <br>  assumption <br> IN FACT he cannot defeat buu. <br>  IN FACT the earring is dispelled instantlyinside boo's body. he doesn't even try <br>  IN FACT kaioshiin pwer level is thousands times stronger than frieza <br>  IN FACT kibito has superior skill in speed and healing ability than Goku  <br>And yet he still a weakling!<br>Are you idiot?<br>Bringing you masturbation fanfic theories won't bring you far, idiot newfag.<br><br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SSJ3 is easy for fusions.</br>  <br>You're dumb. BoG was written by another in a Toei film set in the anime continuity. AT's rewrite was only ever advisory in nature. This is the real deal. RoF had some room for arugment, BoG didn't. Super is a clear case (not the anime though).<br><br><br>And you're dumber. What are you prattling on about, boy? None of that addresses the most important question of all.  When will Vegeta beat Goku again for 3-0 ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>and shit for everyone else</br>  <br>AT completely rewrote most of it to serve his own intentions, so what the original writer did hardly matters. The only thing left over was god of destruction vs super saiyan god. Unless you think Super isn't canon because AT is still using that writer's ideas.</br>  <br>The Super manga is an abridged adaptation of the anime story, so it's not canon if that's what you're implying.</br>  <br><br>You won. Your stuppidy is overhelming. It's like talking to wall.</br></br>  <br> most <br>Not his story. Not his characters. Not even his final say.<br><br> Super <br>Entirely his take on things (as already noted). He can do with it as he pleases (as seen in the manga thus far).<br><br><br> blue hair Bulma <br> five finger Pickle Man <br>Anime-continuity is not canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only 3 of those are Dragon ball threads, the others are just using DB picture.</br>  <br>The epilogue is 10 years after Buu. Pan is 4 years old and Uub is 10 years old during it.</br>  <br>I honestly think Toriyama is a faggot<br><br> Magna with 99% shredded men fighting each other as their clothes gets destroyed through every battle. <br> Zero relevant female characters <br> Always a fucking gay guy added, in every. fucking. arc. <br> Whis is the most powerful being in the universe by leaps and bounds <br> Cant write female characters to save his fucking life. <br><br>I love Dragon Ball but hes fucking gay man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The writer wanted beerus to be a completely evil lizard-man and the character designer wanted SSG to be like a sort of mix between SS3 and SS4. AT got his way on both fronts. In the end, it was a collaborative effort, but AT's push was far greater than anyone else.<br><br>Then nothing about it is canon. I don't think AT has anything to do with the manga. He's writing the scripts for the anime, and it's likely the manga writer gets the same scripts and does his more abridged version.</br></br></br>  <br>  cannot into math <br>Are you stupid?<br>It's stated that BoG film takes place several YEARS after kid buu defeat. it takes more than 3 years after the even of super to be precise. so in three years the baby should have been born.</br></br></br>  <br>Explain carefully why, in the movie, Beerus wakes up from a 40 year long nap, dreaming about a Super Sayain God, and immediately undertakes a trip to locate it, going first to King Kai's world, then Earth.<br><br>While in Super, he spends the first episode already awake, out in space, eating space cuisine made by space chefs, and then blowing up half their planet.<br><br>The facts don't add up mate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stuppidy <br>Right back at you, stupid newfag.</br></br>  <br> Toriyama called Battle of Gods a continuation of the manga <br> Called Resurrection F a sequel to Battle of Gods <br> Gave tbe idea for the cartoon of Dragon Ball Super, upon which the comic is an adaptation <br> You're still tryung to say that the movies are non canon and that Toyotaro's comic is canon <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good you admit defeat. Forcing your masturbation theory with your delusion fact won't get you anywhere and going nowhere.</br>  <br>But Whis and Beerus are canon now, and they are stronger than Vegetto</br>  <br>It's retconned by super and become non canon or filler now.</br>  <br>Sounds like the first episode of super takes place after he wakes up, but before her gets to Earth / King Kai's place. Maybe he got hungry on the way?</br>  <br>If he is already full why in the heck he still feeling hungry on earth like a starvation person and being edgy revengefull bitch because of food.</br>  <br>It's completely different and disconnected from the movie.</br>  <br>He's really REALLY hungry? I mean, the Buu saga did happen. Let's not pretend Toriyama is Shaskespear or some shit.</br>  <br>Retards don't know how to use a catalog. Dragon Ball needs to be purged and blacklisted on the same level as Narutards</br>  <br><br>The dialog in movies told otherwise and whis transformation skill said to be the fastes on universe. I think beerus has no time changing his mind in faster teleportation skill than goku's instant transmission. The speed literally instant. he logic doesn't add up. You're day dreaming.</br></br>  <br> AT gets say in another guy's script <br>Not his story. Super is.<br><br> in the end it wasn't AT's story <br>Good chat.<br><br><br>BoG didn't happen.<br><br><br> AT said <br>AT says a lot of things. Know what he never says? That something is canon. BoG wasn't his story. He has now made it his own with Super.<br><br> tbe <br> tryung <br>You what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With Potara, probably. The difference in heights would prove an obstacle to the fusion dance though</br>  <br>The fact that he jumped into it half-way does not negate that he made it his own while still using the base elements. He's still currently using those elements and has based the entire start of the series around them, so it's sort of silly to harp on that. It was completely canon until Super and would have remained so had they continued doing movies.</br>  <br>but then theyd be weak so no reason do that</br>  <br>The dvd/bluray for RoF doesn't drop until October. There won't be any good encodes or subs for the movie until then. However, the movie premieres English dubbed in US theaters next week.</br>  <br>Really- really hungry but stop eating before get full? when he is act like a spoiled god that want his wish granted even the wish is illogical and forced other to believe his delusion and dream. he literally forcefull against stupid things but choosing to become desireless on his needs and hobby on eating.</br>  <br> does not negate that <br>It was another person's story (and remains theirs)? Super is AT's take (and canon).<br><br> canon until <br>It was never canon. Super has taken that movie trash and made it canon trash. Rejoice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's neither here or there, Anon was asking whether it was possible, which it is.</br>  <br>You have a silly definition of canon then. The movies were canon as according to AT half-writing one and fully writing the next. The anime is now canon due to his writing superseding the movies.. That's it.</br>  <br>no its never shown possible and FACT is that its weak so cant be done... stop your fanfic newfag</br>  <br>I think it's interesting that with the inclusionary SJW enviornment we have in America nowadays, Toriyama managed to drop tons of gay characters all over his manga, and it never felt forced, and it was never treated like a special thing. It's kind of hard to find in other shows, all portrayals of homo characters are either yuribait or fujoshi bait in Japan, or sjw pandering in America.</br>  <br> It was another person's story (and remains theirs)? Super is AT's take (and canon). <br><br>AT has a less active role in Super than in the movies though, which is why we're getting filler characters in Super. <br><br>He just made the plot outline for Super, while with the movies he was either tweaking the final script itself (BoGs) or actually writing the script (RoF).<br><br><br> AT says a lot of things. Know what he never says? That something is canon.  <br>He said that he saw it like making a new story for the manga, that's the closest thing you can get to "canon".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In rof has much more filler than super now. Jaco and some random shits. Super is retconning the 2 movies tho</br>  <br>Potara can fuse a dead man and a living one together with no complications, so two fusion beings fusing probably wouldn't be an obstacle</br>  <br>wat please speaketh gooder enrigsh my brothser</br>  <br>It's not half writing if his name is nowhere credited as the writer. You're deluding. Nips has admitted at as not thewriter of bog since long ago an some interviews.</br>  <br>I'm using small phone with jumpy touchscreen, gay faggot.</br>  <br><br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>Probably yeah. But he was stronger than the strongest SuperBoo (with gotenks and gohan absorbed) without even being a supersaiyan. (well if you go by the manga just being a regular super saiyan). No need to even go SSJ2.</br>  <br>Vegitto is in fact weak and has no kill number. Only masturbated fans think otherwise.</br>  <br> the anime is now canon <br>Anime-only scum, please.<br><br><br> he didn't call anything canon <br>This is true. Thus, we default to his authentic works. Like Super (not BoG, DBO, etc.).<br><br><br>Get good, nerd.<br><br><br>That sounds like anime talk.<br><br> SSJ2 <br> J <br>There's no "J" in Super Saiyan, friend. You're speaking English, so let's not pretend you're referring to "Saiya-Jin" (unnecessary to denote them as people anyway). As for boat talk, it ain't "S.S." and boats aren't exactly common in the show (much less those of the sunken variety). No excuses, weeb.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He mostly CANNOT become SS because pottara fusion mostly has the same power like mystic transformation. It's logical because mysic is suprem kai technique the owner of all those pottara rings.</br>  <br>Vegito appearance like mystic appearance. He cannot go any further.</br>  <br> It's logical because mysic is suprem kai technique the owner of all those pottara rings. <br>It's not though. The unlock potential comes from the witch that fused with Supreme Kai, it's not a Supreme Kai specific ability.</br></br>  <br> every single interview basically talks about how much AT changed and contributed <br> they didn't call him the writer so he did shit and all that was made up <br><br><br>AT is writing for the anime. The manga is an adaptation of it and has nothing to do with AT, so, yes, the anime is canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fused people in pottara skill and everything become one. No separated skill, read more. It has been more than 75 million years after he fused.</br>  Went to /a/ to read anons bickering about power levels, I am now satisfied.  <br>Git gud newfag and read more interview. Or googling.</br>  <br>I cant googling because I aming english worse</br>  <br>Potentially, he could get to SSGSSJ given his two parts reached that level.<br><br>As for who's the canonically strongest character, we dont really know since they never stated how Vegetto would fare against Bills and Whiss. Whiss said that if Goku and Vegeta teamed up they could take on Bills in SSJGSS so Vegetto in that level could hypotetically beat him but we dont know.<br><br>Top 5 would be Bills, Whiss,Vegetto, Goku and Vegeta but we dont know the proper order. There's also Champa and his assistant who may be about as strong as Bills and Whiss.</br></br></br></br></br>  of course he can  <br>Vegitto only last very2 short time frame to be even judged has good endurance and power. There is high chance vegitto power is like ssj3. A mere transformation that last no long or mistyc.vegitto cannot use genkidama he is much weaker in terms of skill and technique. Goku with genkidama is factually stronger because the skill can kill ultra regenerative beings.</br>  <br>How would Vegetto get to SSG? I'm sorry I haven't watched Resurrection F so I'm not sure if they found away around the requirement of 5 other saiyans. With Vegeta and Goku combined, they would be short 1. <br><br>If they wanted to fight Bills or Whiss, they'd have to pick either SSGSSJ Goku or SSJ Vegetto. Who's stronger?<br><br>I can't help myself I love these threads!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegitto cannot use genki dama the only skill that is matter. He is shit though.</br>  <br> bah </br>  <br>lrn2 english<br><br> here is high chance vegitto power is like ssj3 <br>A mere fusion ssj is stronger than ssj3 Goku and Vegetto is stated to be way more powerful than conventional fusion. It also has been stated in databooks that Potara's power increase is exponential so it's at least as strong as GokuxVegeta. SSJ3 only multiplies your base power by 400, Vegeta has much more than that.<br><br> Goku with genkidama is factually stronger  <br>No, he really isnt.<br><br><br> How would Vegetto get to SSG? <br>Both fusees can get there.<br><br> I'm sorry I haven't watched Resurrection F so I'm not sure if they found away around the requirement of 5 other saiyans.  <br>Its shown in BoG that Goku can transform in SSG on his own., you only need the ritual once.<br>And Vegeta can also do it.<br><br> either SSGSSJ Goku or SSJ Vegetto. Who's stronger? <br>As I said, they havent said so.<br><br><br>lrn2 english</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not knowing genki dama.

How pleb you can be newfag.</br>  <br>Super is hardly going to change anything important from the movies.</br>  <br>Goku himself felt that he wouldn't be able to match a supressed Bills even if he fused with Vegeta. and although potara fusion is stronger it's fair to assume it's not that big of a difference to matter.</br>  <br>No you pleb newfag all guid books has more than often contain contradicting information and false information. And a lot of them is not writen or even be touched by toriyama, pleb.</br>  <br> contradictive material <br>YOu mean like the original manga?<br><br><br> Goku himself felt that he wouldn't be able to match a supressed Bills even if he fused with Vegeta. <br>He didnt say so. Also, there's a huge difference between potara and fusion.<br><br><br>  more than often contain contradicting information and false information <br>If that's enough to diss them, then the original manga is not canon I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retconning is still retconning how small it is. Hypotheticaly talking if the difference is not a lot.</br>  <br>Yea right.

If it had been done like Season 1, sighs would have been summed in 3 to 4 episodes, not a full 6. The only good thing about sighs was a slight indication of Itsuki's mysterious past.<br><br>The movie redeems the failures of Season 2, but it was too much too late. Everyone moved to Madoka.<br><br>...the only good thing si that Madoka has not had new content since 2013, while a mediocre series keeps Haruhi 'current'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Personal opinion: Endless Eight is ok, it gives an small glimpse of what Nagato felt during all the bucles.</br>  <br>The problem is, Endless Eight is what will put laymen off the anime.<br><br>I think thats my chief problem/concern with Haruhi in its current form. When Haruhi Season 1 came out, it garnered attention for attraction not only anime fans and moe fans, but also non-anime fans who liked the show. But as season 2 went on, and with it, Haruhichan, it sort of cemented the series's ties with otaku culture, which ostracized it. The yukichans eries isn't that different from your typical boring slice-of-life anime.<br><br>The series needs something vitalizing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From what i see the second season did a purge of undesirables fans.</br>  <br>And from what I see the second season made the series a lot less interesting to other fans. You say they're undesirable, I say its what made the series relatable.<br><br>Its like something was lost when KyoAni pulled off the stunt that was Endless Eight.</br></br></br>  <br>And whos call was to animate endless eight, Tanigawa's? or KyoAni. if its tanigawa's <br>but if is KyoAni's, i dont know what they were thinking.</br></br>  Are you making me dump my Haruhisky folder again??  <br>Well, in answer to your question:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tqy<wbr>8x-zKuKw&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=SG</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>        <br> Audio cuts at 2:29 <br>Not sure but i guess was KyoAni's fault?</br></br>    I wonder how /a/ reacted to endless 8. Was it known before that the arc would be done like that or was it a total surprise?  <br>It's kadokawa being a jew.<br>Even when kyokana's author ever asked about endless eight, their reaction was like "I don't want to talk about that shit anymore".</br></br>    <br>I'm more curious with /a/ reacted to 2006 order.</br>  <br>Normaly it would have been just 2 EP, the beginning and the final.

Looking forward to next week's "greeting". Hopefully we'll see Meliodas wreck a Commandment.  <br>His ability is finally revealed too. Seems pretty sick, now we knew what he tried to do back during thr Bezle fight</br>    <br>Disaster: finally explained in the story, and it seems we were pretty much right on point on what it was.</br>    <br>I wonder if he can open Bans wound and kill him.</br>  <br>Me neither, he killed someone by throwing a flower at him</br>    <br> Hopefully we'll see Meliodas wreck a Commandment. <br>It's just a "greeting", though.<br><br>I'm thinking they do something like what Gilthunder did when he threw a spear towards Bernia and Meliodas ends up reflecting it.<br><br><br>You're way too impatient, man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  For use in Internet debates       this thread will be full of King bullying <br><br>King did nothing wrong.</br></br>    <br>People don't usually start commenting until the dump is finished. It 'disrupts the flow' or something like that.</br>      <br>Eh. I think you'll have to blame the crazy King fans for that, then. I mean, the cliche King is going through currently doesn't help, but yeah. I think people are just shitting on the overtly sensitive Kingfags. Really can't stomach all the shitflinging and rationalization going on in recent threads.</br>      <br>To think this is all that was needed to completely eliminate Fraudrin and not have the collateral damage which wiped out an entire kingdom.</br>      <br>Well, you know, Meliodas went crazy at Liz' death, so he probably wouldn't have been able to concentrate enough to do that. It took, what, hundreds of tries for him to pass the test? I'm assuming.</br>  Last page  <br><br>Whats with this? Did the full counter do something?</br></br>  <br>Watch King sprout wings in his next fight. Calling it now.</br>  <br>I'm assuming King is experiencing its effects here<br><br>And also assuming that, whatever happened, is causing him to grow his wings. Considering Disaster can be used to trigger biological functions, maybe Meliodas amplified Disaster and used it to trigger the beginnings of a transformation in King to turn him into a proper fairy king?</br></br></br>  <br>To be honest, I consider King as someone who favours asses.</br>  <br>I bet King is an assfag.</br>  <br>So Kings power up will include him getting his wings back or brand new ones.entirely.</br>  Why is King acting like such an edgy faggot in this chapter? He knew the captain for decades already and he even told Ban that he was suspecting that Meliodas might be a demon.<br><br> Fuck that shota fuccboi, he deserves all te suffering he gets</br></br>  <br>I wonder if he even had wings to begin with? Maybe he just failed to sprout any for whatever reason.</br>  <br>Well the thing is Meliodias has told them absolutely nothing about himself and what his motives are. The fact that he is a demon and wont tell them anything its not hard to imagine they'd be slightly annoyed.</br>  <br>Nah. It's still an unreasonable reaction given the circumstances. Meliodas hasn't done anything suspicious, after all. He's only shown knowledge of the Demon Clan and that he possesses the same power as them, yet King has acted so confrontational. Even worse is that the Druids implicitly trust Meliodas and are willing to grant him his full power back after he gave it all away to them.</br>  <br>It´s part Meliodas fault too, he just should tell them everything. For example, if he told Merlin Galan power (and the others demons too) she wouldn´t have become stone.</br>  <br>King knows all that. It's not like he tries to prevent Mel getting his power back. He just pissed off at him for being all secret.<br><br><br> Galan <br><br>To be fair that was way too sudden.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol he might be a butterfly where he's in the caterpillar stage right now.</br>  <br> after he gave it all away to them <br>It was stolen from him. That said im wondering what Merlin did to steal his power to begin with? Instead of just sealing the demons 3000 years before should of just stripped them all of power and killed them off.</br></br>  <br>King looks like the guy from Akagi on this page.</br>  <br>Considering this page here, though<br><br>it's not so much that King is angry at Meliodas for keeping secrets, but suspicious of his intentions.</br></br></br>  Awww yiss  Meliodas is at fault in this situation as well but it's certain that he has something that seriously prevents him from just telling everything to everyone.<br>King is a huge fucking hypocrite though. His pompous attitude, his usage of power, everything deserved the treatment Mel gave to him. Wonder what Mel could do with that ball of darkness but it probably could've been pretty dangerous. Maybe he will "greet" commandments by summoning a larger version.</br>  <br>I think its a <br> you are missing 100 hp <br> disaster happens, you are now missing 10x the previous amount of hp <br>and since king wasnt missing any hp, he took no damage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, right, I forgot this happened right after the Sins were escaping from Liones.<br><br>Could be because he's alone, whereas the Ten Commandments were all together.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that's some nice information and a good question.</br>   Meliodas full countered Disaster, a power which can magnify and accelerate growth <br> King's wings were weak and small and he probably can't use his power on himself naturally but thanks to Mel they will finally start to develop </br>  <br>Sprouting wings is probably be a sign of maturation. I think we know how King will get his power up.</br>  Pic related could be a great shop for Bait.jpg, saying something like "The thread was entirely annihilated by anon, who lost himself in bait"  <br>Greaaaaat, all they needed was they finding him out.</br>  <br> Estarossa still doesn't gives a fuck </br>  <br> implying even multiple Commandments combined can pose a threat to him now <br> especially when Mel finally started mastering his own power </br></br>  <br><br>Well if we mix what you both said, melodois may have used disaster on King, yet instead of spurring wing growth it just spur "growth" blatantly. King might get to age at an abnormal rate now if thats true he might even have a human life span.</br></br>  <br>You think so? His expression actually seems to be the one that changed the most</br>  <br>there are 12 commandments, they are all around 10% of their full power. He could wreck a single commandment at 100% so im sure he can beat a single commandment at 120%.</br>  <br>We all still believe Meliodas was probably the strongest one of them all, right? Yeah. Zeldris is pretty careful, so even if all 10 Commandments might be able to take him out, they'll probably suffer casualties in the process that Zeldris may deem unacceptable.<br><br><br> King might get to age at an abnormal rate now if thats true he might even have a human life span. <br>The fairy king's lifespan seems to be even longer than that of an ordinary fairy's, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> putting the druid in risk <br> making his exhausted friends have to face the mid-bosses alone <br>That was not a nice move, they should have given him in doses.</br></br></br>  Looks like Meliodas never was able to control his power up to this point.<br>But now, when he learned to manage his emotions, he will start developing dark matter techniques like this ball.<br>Wonder if he will experiment with his power a bit in the next chapter.</br></br>  <br>This makes me think king isnt a front liner but more of a debuffer support where merlin is a buffer support.</br>  <br> We all still believe Meliodas was probably the strongest one of them all, right? <br>Meliodas bears the most complex demon mark, just like his brothers, which means only they potentially can stood up against him. Shame about Galan, he will probably get destroyed soon.</br></br>  <br>Shit I'm really a sucker for things like this</br>  Pic of the former fairy king from the game.  <br> Looks like Meliodas never was able to control his power up to this point. <br>What are you talking about?<br><br>If we use the holes he's made he's made as a way to measure how much of his demon power he's able to control, he's made even larger holes than the one he made around Galan. The one at Edinburgh was much, much larger. And the one at Danafor seems to be his largest crater.</br></br></br></br>   Galan decides to jump to the fairy land to correct his mistake <br> gets launched by Mel back to Commandments unabara banchou-style </br>  <br>Oh, is this the DS game? Has this been discussed yet? What's the gameplay like?</br>  <br><br>King or Queen?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much everyone could be seen as a debufer then.<br>Ban<br> steals their strength stamina everything else <br><br>Gowther<br> Makes them see whats not really there, can link people together to formulate plans <br><br>King<br> Use disaster to amplify any damage his teammates have done <br><br>Merlin<br> straight up buffs <br><br>Only diana, the sun and Melodais dont fall into this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's it, he can only create "holes". He was unable to even consciously control his power without failing into the state of rage. Now he has a full control over it and instead of just nuking everything can probably use it in more graceful and less dangerous to his allies forms.</br>  <br>I recall there were different terms for king or queen in Japanese? So king, yeah, but the monarch of the fairy clan is probably just called 'fairy king' regardless of their actual gender.<br><br><br> He was unable to even consciously control his power without failing into the state of rage. <br>Huh? Except for Danafor, he didn't fall into a 'state of rage' in the incidents with Galan or at Edinburgh.<br><br> Now he has a full control over it <br>Are you referring to this?<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CNt<wbr>oChC2ahU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Like this, but we know that Nakaba supervised it so the character designs are canon at the very least.</br></br></br>  <br>With Galan he barely managed to control his power. He was mumbling that he "must" control it and in the end still caused the damage to his allies.<br>His inability to control it was also the reason Merlin took it from him as he could lost it just because some girl got hurt helping them.</br></br>  <br> only 3 fairy kings ever <br> he knows them <br>how old is he?</br></br></br>  <br>With Diane he got all the ass he needs and more.<br> And even more. </br></br>  <br>It's obvious that he's older than great war.<br>Lifespan of simple demons might be 1000 years but Mel and his brothers are certainly different and probably the children of demon lord himself so they have insane lifespan if not outright immortal.</br></br>  <br> Fairy KING <br><br>No Oberon or Titania.Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> and in the end still caused the damage to his allies. <br>But he didn't cause any damage to his allies.<br><br>Are you sure you're explaining yourself properly? Because I think it's obvious that Meliodas has trouble controlling his emotions when Elizabeth/Liz is harmed, after all, but otherwise he's shown that he's been able to control it without causing anyone else harm in the fight against Galan.<br><br>I don't even understand what you're referring to when you say he has 'full control' over it now. Are you referring to what he did this chapter or to what he did in the previous chapters when he finally passed the test and could stop his emotions from overtaking him?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Literal power levels   <br>I rather want the ass level of each girl.</br>  <br>Didn't he slice Ban in half when he lost control after being free from that crystal.</br>  <br>Even if thats true i given his ability that really shouldn't matter, if his magic was reflected back at him he should be able to use it on himself.</br>   King takes no damage from the Counter but feels it later <br> his ability is supposed to amplify diseases/weaknesses that previously exists <br><br>Wings probably got ripped out when he was a kid.</br></br></br>  <br>How does that fit into the discussion, though? That was a rather radical situation, don't you think? Meliodas was mindless and acting on instinct after all.<br><br>When he's conscious and in a normal state, he's able to control his power. When he's grieving over Liz/Elizabeth, he gets "lost in his rage". When he's going berserk, it's because he's not mentally prepared to control his powers.</br></br></br>  <br>This disturbingly makes even sense considering it is established that humans rip off wings off of fairies.</br>  <br>While I don't agree on King not being able to use his own power on himself, I have to comment on the fact that there is significance in Meliodas reflecting it. Remember, Meliodas' Full Counter amplifies the strength of whatever power he reflects.<br><br><br>Well, I think that's just an offensive application of Disaster. Merlin describes King's power as giving him control over "life and death". So apart from worsening conditions and turning poison deadlier, it's probably capable of reinforcement as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even a loli but I am now aroused. Short and sweet, thick and petite</br>  King not having wings, just like his sister, is NOT a fucking secret in this universe. He was about to tell to a fucking Knight apprentice why he didn't have wings. <br>Meliodas was simply strawmanning because he likes to at all mysterious.</br>  <br>You're misremembering, anon. He wasn't going to tell Jericho. He was stumbling over what to say because it seemed to be something shameful for him, being the fairy king and without wings.<br><br>Meliodas brought it up to illustrate that it was not something he wanted to talk about. Just like how King doesn't like his lack of wings being mentioned, Meliodas is reluctant to talk about his past with the Demon Clan.<br><br>Yeesh, use your head a little.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I remember King was about to make an excuse for not telling her.</br>  <br>  Full Counter amplifies the strength of whatever power he reflects. <br>I'd actually be annoying if Melodias full counter is what caused them to sprout and King couldn't do that himself because his powers weren't strong enough to cause it to grow. I'd actually be more annoyed if this was "all according to plan" by Melodias</br></br>  <br>Those few doujins that exist don't properly appreciate Diane ass.<br>That needs to change.</br></br>  <br> He knew the captain for decades already <br>You have to remember that decades don't mean quite as much to the likes of King, Diane, and Meliodas as they do to humans.</br></br>  <br>it was centuries, he spent human generations with Diana and she stayed a 4 year old that entire time, so imagine going from 4 year old to 14. Thats how long he knew captian</br>  <br>Didn't King join the sins after Diane did, by which time she already look like an adult? That's why he was using the fat form in the first place.</br>   King dislikes Melly's link with darkness mcedge <br> They fight <br> They get over it <br><br>It's just so ... predictable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No wings? Maybe it's special for fairy kings, like they start out with no wings but work their way into getting them. And only fairies born without wings can become the king. Although Elaine didn't have any either so maybe it's blood-related.</br>  <br>At least it wasn't as bad as Ban's beef with Meliodas, that was some bad timing. But inner conflict in a group is a common shounen trope. Questioning motives, different paths, opposite morals, whatever.</br>  <br>Still untranslated stuff:<br>http://imgur.com/a/i1xHC<br>http://imgur.com/a/85CBs<br>http://imgur.com/a/km4JJ<br>http://imgur.com/a/4OkeW<br>http://imgur.com/a/SxTCF<br>http://imgur.com/a/emQv9</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want something unexpected to happen, something that'll get my adrenaline pumping, my imagination soaring, my fingers shitposting.</br>  <br>Well we see Melodois taking King away so even if the sins didnt exist back then they knew each other.</br>  <br> female Gowther x King <br><br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think King recognized Meliodas as one of the guards taking him away, only the readers noticed he was there. I'm pretty sure they only got to know each other once the sins were formed, ~16 years ago.</br>  <br>Which chapter was that again?</br>  <br>It still was an awesome fight.<br>Why can't you enjoy this?</br></br>  <br>Because I'm tired of shitty writing. Yes, yes, manga is not the place to look for great writing, I know, but I just wish sometimes maybe.</br>  <br>Nakaba loves his /ss/</br>  <br> Well the past 10 or so chapters have been pretty boring with barely anything happening, i know they have been necessary andd but the pacing could have been better. Everytime i read a chapter nowadays it feels like nothing happened.</br>  <br>What's so shitty about it?<br>It is not enough to be unexpected, it also have to make sense.<br>Killing someone off wouldn't really make sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, people didn't enjoy the suffering loops?</br>   King raises some good points about how suspicious Mel is <br> they still give him back his demon powers <br>"Wise" druids.</br></br>  <br>Or maybe they know the answers and therefor know his suspicions are null</br>  <br>Fucking demon sympathizers, I tell you.</br>  Does this mean Fairies have only been around for 1000years?  Note that king never answered that he is truly the fairy king :^)  <br>At least a 1000 years. Maybe the first king was an elder when Meliodas met him.</br>  <br>Is this a flashback? Why is the dude who broke Helbram there?</br>  <br>Mel never answered that he was on their side either</br>  Why is it even called the Fairy King when he is obviously no Monarch but instead chosen by the fairies?   Mel hit when it really hurt King to shut him up <br>He may seem like an easygoing person but he knows how to press on people when it's needed.</br>  <br>Their chosen by the tree</br>  Didn't fairies have smaller wings but taller bodies the higher their standing was? Maybe it was the other way around before Kings reign and something turned the fairy hierarchy upside down  <br>They're. Fuck me</br>  <br>3000+.<br>Nakaba said a fairy lifespan reaches from 1000-1500 years.<br>Elaine was 1000 and King is 1300.</br></br></br>  <br> YFW Helbram was the legit King but some circumstances made it Harlequin. </br>  <br>Well that's making it painfully obvious King is going to get Wings even more than mentioning it</br>  <br>And the fairy king has a longer lifespan than the average fairy.</br>  <br>Jesus Mel who knew you were such a DARKNESS edgelord deep down.</br>  <br> Emotion Displayed: Bag </br>  <br><br> Th-that's because <br> Not going to tell <br>He was going to tell her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Are you literally autistic?</br>  Still wondering what Threader and Spagetti-Os are up to, and how Arthur's Blade Mode practice is going  <br>Not that anon, but you seem to be autistic, he was going to tell her, but he was ashamed of the reason, nothing else.</br>  <br>He was stuttering because he tried to think of a lie</br>  <br>Literally nothing indicates that, when you would be talking about something you're ashamed off, you would act just like king.</br>  <br> I am serious though, not being able to recognize emotions/intentions is one of the main symptoms of autism, you might need to check that out .</br>  <br>see <br><br> if I call someone autist, people might think that at the least I'm not an autist <br>yeah no</br></br></br></br>  <br>  10% <br>No they aren't. It's just their magic that is exhausted.</br></br>  <br>Meliodas magic is probably exhausted too and he cant get a quick battery charge through human souls</br>  Did any fairy ever show concern about their wings? It seems like they dont actually give a fuck about them and its more like human eyecolor, not really something that matters or you can influence  How the fuck do you full counter something thats apparently instant without projectile  The fucking cave would be perfect for ban to train<br>BUT HE ISNT THERE<br>fuck he is going to stay the jobber isnt he</br></br>  <br>I'm sure Ban will think of something. He's one of the more popular characters, I doubt he'll stay where he is.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be so sure about that.<br>King is really popular and has been on the suffering train since ever. Meanwhile Ban has always been the biggest jobber.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and King is also the only other one besides the Main character to beat an those demon golems, and he did it with his own power, not a redirected attack times five.<br>Besides suffering is good, it builds character and only makes the happy end better</br></br>  <br>He still has to get his treasure back and we never saw him properly use snatch</br>  <br>Except King has always been shown a the most capable Sin. What I meant is that Nakaba has been consistent about him suffering and Ban being a jobber.</br>  King will grow wings that give him enough power to allow ban to snatch the holy tree  <br>Does King have lace-up slits on the sides of his pants? What a slut</br>  <br>Everyone has them. They changed outfits to go into the cave and everyone is wearing the same pants</br>  <br>How many pages could Kubo wring from 10 reactions?</br>  <br>A chapter</br>  <br> Biggest jobber <br>That's Diane and Ban had not his Treasure.</br></br>  <br>How it was in the chapter was pretty Kubo-like. If he really wanted to stretch it he could get like two pages.</br>  <br>Diane lost to Galan a commandment.<br>Ban lost to fucking Janko.</br></br>   to seal Mel with his leftover of power small ember was enough till he awakened his power <br> his true power cannot be sealed for long in the ember which is 100 times larger </br>  <br>What are you even shitposting about?</br>  King is such a little bitch  NnT threads are really dead, even boku no pico academia has faster threads  <br> Hello darkness, my old friend. </br>  I would have expected Oberon to be one of King's predecessors.  <br>Hero threads are full of circlejerking.<br>I would really prefer less activity over seeing 300 posts of BASED DEKU and I WANT TO FUCK THE FROG.</br></br>  <br>More like they went back to normal since the anime ended<br> boku no pico academia has faster threads <br>Its also nonstop deku and frog wank</br></br></br>  <br>That certainly adds a bit of tragedy.Basically says Elaine and Helbram were guaranteed to die long before King who'd be left behind them.</br>  <br>No he just didn't instantly heal to a power we still never got explained. He probably would have won in a serious battle.</br>  <br><br>Who cares?</br></br>  <br>Because Hero Academy is fun to read atm while NNT hasn't been for a while.</br>  <br>Obviously you, because you answered.</br>  <br> Hero Academy is fun to read <br>nah, it has even more cliches than nnt does. Watching paint dry is more exciting than bnha</br></br>  <br>But they are done in a fun and entertaining way<br>Meanwhile NNT is just generic fantasy shit</br></br>  <br> But they are done in a fun and entertaining way <br>Sure if you've never read a comic book or other superhero mango's</br></br>  <br><br>Whether one is more interesting than the other or not is subjetive, isn't it?<br>Either way, slower threads for shonen series are a blessing in disguise.</br></br></br>  <br>That OAD is the the one for the short stories right?<br><br> Just a greeting <br>Mel going to scare them off?

Nakaba just didn't let him do it yet.</br>  <br>The size difference really hasn't been a problem for them.</br>  <br>Wasn't what he just got back his magic?</br>   Hey Meliodas we are in some deep shit this time and everything about you seems to be super fucking relevant to this situation so why don't you stop being a bitch and tells us what exactly is the deal with you and the other demon faggots so we can know what the fuck is going on and with what we are dealing with? <br> W-Well I won't tell because you won't tell why you don't have wings even if it is completely unrelated to what is happening right now and would clearly help no one unlike all the shit I'm keeping to myself </br>  SO<br>HOW WILL THE REST OF THE SINS CATCH UP TO MELIODAS?</br>  <br>We all know already that mel is completly dense and king is a dramaking.<br><br> hurr durr I call you out now and not directly when hendrickson went demon mode and made the other demons fuck us <br> hurr tell me about a specific detail of your past even if it has nothing to do with me or anyone else <br><br>Both of them need help.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened with Ban again after he went tree-trunk?  <br> not being a loli <br>Why are you on /a/?<br>We're all lolis.</br></br></br>  <br>Meliodas found a good way to shut King up without telling him anything.<br>Being wingless is probably a huge problem to King and Mel punched him where it really hurts.</br></br>  REMOVE DEMON<br>REMOVE</br>  <br>Some kind of secret demon weakness so they can lower the Commandments to their level or some blessing of the goddesses to bring them up temporarily.</br>  <br>He became temporarily irrelevant.</br>  <br><br>Are you both actually retarded or just betas?</br></br>  <br>kill yourself faggot</br>  <br>You don't even have to answer my question I already know what you are.</br>  <br> blessing of the goddesses to bring them up temporarily. <br>But the goddesses are the real villains<br>They just have to deal with the demons right now because they are being active</br></br></br>  <br>They don't need to catch up to him. He's the same as Akira from Kongou Bancho, in a league of his own. They can, however, match to other Commandments.<br>King will grow his fairy wings and master true spear.<br>Diane will probably receive some hidden earth clan techniques.<br>Gowther will most likely completely remove all his limiters and go full mindfuck mode.<br>Ban don't need to become stronger. As long as his opponent is unable to permanently destroy his he can sap all his power for himself.<br>Escanor will just say "boom".<br>Merlin probably has some powerful magic she can't simply use.<br><br>Also Misfits will probably fight a Commandment in 3 vs 1 or even 4 vs 1 along with Hendy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Why are you so retarded?</br>  <br>Nope. Ban was talking to demons when he used the horn.</br>  <br>why are you?</br>  <br>Proper foreshadowing isn't what I'd call shitty writing. On the contrary. And if you didn't get excited or madly entertained, when Spaghetti Master sliced the princess, or when he revealed his keikaku prowess, then you may as well drop the series and cut your losses, because this just isn't for you.</br>  <br>I'm literally a genius.</br>  <br>Nah, Gowther will become a real boy or something.<br><br>And Ban's opponents can permanently destroy him. Also, you forgot about how badly he did against Ash Demon Hendy. He did so bad, HORK of all people had to save Meliodas.<br><br>You overestimate Escanor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Banfags this defensive <br>I could also make hundreds of excuses about Dianes losses, but I don't because I doesn't matter what could have happened. <br>Ban is the King of jobber in NnT because he is an idiot who thinks that his immortality guarantees him always the victory.<br>His fight against Gerhard is the best example.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You overestimate Escanor. <br><br>Escanor a perfection.</br></br></br>  I want escanor to burn mel's faggot demon ass  <br><br><br>Who the fuck is Escanor?<br><br>Is this some new epic meme?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who the fuck is Escanor? <br>Is this some new epic meme?</br></br>  <br>He's the 7th deadly sin who hasn't been in the main storyline yet.</br>  <br>No, because she is MY waifu.</br>  <br>I'm serious.</br>  <br>Not the same anon. but this is a bad example.

Yukipasta Yui buns  <br>I want to make this Yuigahama a Yuigamama.</br>  <br>Side bun yukinon is almost as cute as the genuine article.</br>  Maybe Yui should just kill herself and solve 90% of the problems.  <br>That would just be running from the problem and not solve anything.<br>Perhaps you should do it Anon.</br></br>  Imagine Yui and Yukino's feelings when they attend the wedding between 8man and Iroha.<br><br>It's only a matter of time.</br></br>  <br>Why would he take responsibility for Zaimokuza's mistake?</br>  Doesn't matter who ends up with who, I just want this guy to be happy<br><br>Although I prefer Yukino, but she has to grow too. Maybe rejection will facilitate that?</br></br>  What would Yui and Yukino think if they saw 8man playing with Keika? Would they tell Komachi she may have been replaced? Would they get jealous? <br><br>Would they imagine having him care for their own children?</br></br>   no Iroha to look down on me   <br>Not sure how being rejected again will help her grow.<br>Only reason rejection helped HIkki grow was because he was rejected over and over until it didn't even phase him anymore.</br></br>  <br> you will never smell her fluids </br>  <br>Rejection didn't really help him grow though. Just because he was going through some major growing pains before doesn't mean he wasn't still completely stunted by all the rejections.</br>    Couldn't say thanks for the Irohasu thread in time. <br>But yeah, thanks, brothers.<br><br><br><br>Stop it you, I can't do it right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not getting what you want gives people a backbone, there's a reason why spoiled brats exist. Although she doesn't seem like a spoiled brat in terms of physical needs, she isn't well versed in relationships. Might also pass the genuine lesson from Hiratsuka where being in a relationship with someone means you're ready to hurt/get hurt. There's a lot of things that can only be realized through rejection.<br><br>But then again I'm not saying that I don't want Yukino to end up with 8man, I just want both of them to grow which is exactly what the major premise of the story. I would be really happy if all the little things the novel showed be brought up again such as <br> the picture she bought from the Christmas trip show up again in their living room once 8man and her settle down and have a family  <br> having 8man's third question result in not being friends but lovers.  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei and 8man would be head over heels for him. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei <br> Drinks <br> Smokes <br> Ancient anime references <br> Punches <br>Do you really want this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's not what 8man found alluring in sensei.</br>  <br>She probably can't handle drinks and with her condition smoking is the worst she can do.<br>She does tend to go on rants about the things she likes but not as intense as Hiratsuka does.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but that's the point.</br>  <br>Was it really necessary to continue these threads under a trick like that? Let's just let them die. It's time to move on to new series and new discussions. Really now at this point there's nothing left to discuss about the series. At least the Irohafags are honest about only wanting to waifu worship.</br>  <br>This will happen if 8man rejects Yukino, what will make her realize she is actually Sensei from the past, then they'll battle it out to see who is the real Yukino</br>  <br>We have important things to talk about such as...<br><br>How would Yukino initiate sex? Would she bluntly state her need to have children or would she beat around the bush (like she often does) and imply it only to shyly reject the idea once 8man catches on?<br><br>This is important information dammit!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious how she'll act by the end of the series.</br>  <br>Is that before or after she goes super Yukinon when Hachiman dies?</br>  <br>She would keep teasing him until he's unable to resist. She wouldn't be the first to initiate early on in the relationship.</br>  <br>I think it'll be 90% hormones when she does it, but it'll start with her working a jab at 8man's sexual prowess into her banter and escalate to a "yeah, well prove it" moment when she gets right in 8man's face. Then finally realizes what the hell she's doing and that she really, really wants to pin him down and take a ride on the 8 inches, and from there it's just a matter of who caves first.<br><br>I'm wondering how Yui would work it now too. I think the shy hint-dropping would be more up her alley, though I can see her just showing up in the bedroom in new lingerie and letting nature take its course too.</br></br></br>  Rank the following Yaharis by order of intelligence (currently in random order): Yukino, Yui, Iroha, Hachiman, Saki, Komachi, Sensei, Yumiko, Cunt, Tobe, Zaimokuza, Saika  <br>I'm also quite curious about what their family interactions would be like<br><br> The hikigaya family goes to the beach <br> 8man unconsciously stares at girls <br> "Hachiman, what are you looking at?" <br> "N-nothing really" <br> "Is that so? Hey, have you heard? There were news yesterday that a wife killed her husband" <br>"R-really? why?"<br>"She had believed he had been cheating on him, shows that people shouldn't underestimate a woman's jealousy huh.."<br>"I-I suppose.."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn.

Yui<br>  + She is the only known girl in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is cunt ranked so highly?</br>  <br>Not him but he's perceptive as fuck</br>  <br>Not only is he book smart but he can also apply that intelligence in the real world. We have also seen that he is as attentive if not more attentive that 8man, which demonstrates how he is able to read behind people's intentions.</br>  Rather just let the thread die now and wait for TL.  <br>I remind  Spyro. </br>  <br>Yuckyno a shit.</br>  <br>You mean a cute.</br>  <br>You mean Yukino a best. Don't make Spyro cut you, shitposter.</br>  <br><br>No, I meant Yuckyno a shit. A SHIT.</br></br>  <br>I remind them.</br>  <br>All I see is cute.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're 3 hours too late to start this. Unkindly fuck off with your spam.</br></br></br></br>  Delete meme threads  <br>That picture is horrible, it's so uncharacteristic of her. Komachi would be a better fit.</br>  <br>Fuck off cuckinofag</br>  Ignore it, you guys.  <br>She's channeling Kamakura.</br>  <br> Uses "cuck" after he is bored with Yucky <br>And there are Yuifags and Irohafags who dares say THK isn't the worstshitposter in Yahari threads who forces these memes of his.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the only competition THK ever had was KONOKON and I haven't seen his ESLfaggotry in ages so no, nobody says THK isn't the worst single poster here.</br>  <br>Both cuck and yuck are fitting for Yukinoshitters though.</br>   4h <br> 86 / 34 / 22 <br>Is this a new low?</br></br>   You'll never be Pan-san for Yukino <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>   That THK-forcing Yuckynofag is here <br><br>Ignore and move on.</br></br>  <br> cuck  <br>Iroha is the only one still actively going after Hayama aside from Yumiko.<br>Yukino didn't even bother to try to be friends with him again after they made up.</br></br></br>  <br> 4:1 ratio <br>average was about 5 at the peak of S2's run so not really, no.</br></br>  <br>The thing is, some of them deny what THK does.<br><br><br> Both cuck and yuck are fitting <br>Point in case of his obsession.<br> Yukinoshitters <br>And then there's this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  IR<br>O<br>HA</br></br>  <br> The thing is, some of them deny what THK does. <br>Of course, not everyone is braindead.</br></br>  <br><br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>Nice first experiences that totally happened during elementary school.<br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>More like didn't bother to stand up for her so she decided to do it herself by becoming better than everyone else.<br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>She was cold towards Yui during this part because Yui was being a slut talking about how embarrassing it is to be a virgin while Yukino says placing importance on losing it is completely stupid.<br>Even 8man comments on how Yui saying that it's for the sake of "femininity" just makes her sound like a slut. <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br>She gave those exact same chocolates to Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I will remind everyone.</br>  <br>So THK got online almost an hour ago? I gotta remember this to build a schedule of his lurking hours.</br>  <br> obsession <br><br>Yuckynofags are pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br> Redirecting to your trollpasta <br>Has this ever work? It's so full of bullshit and biased.</br></br>  <br>Hmm. That fag going to sleep 18-19 hours from now seems about right unless he forces himself to stay up.</br>  いろはす～  <br>So flat.</br>  <br>Flat is justice</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>someone's sad he didn't have the hugbox he wanted last thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And curves are love. 8man needs both to lead a fulfilling life.</br>  <br>So you're saying that he should pick the girl with the mixt of curves and flatness.<br><br><br>He must have missed it, we had a good time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Flat is perflat.</br>  <br> he will never pick both <br>8man why</br></br>  <br>Why would he take an inferior example of either when he can have a perfect example of each?<br><br><br>Because the world is still too full of biggotry and fear to accept a true 3P end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Iroha is already in her love triangle with Tobe and Zaimokuza, 8man doesn't have time for a slut like her</br>  <br><br>top lel, YY a shit, Iroha out does both of them by far.<br>Yui a dumb<br>Yukino a autist<br><br>Iroha is best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You could at least put forth a little effort.</br>  <br>Balance is the key, you know.<br>Picking double YY is everything but balance, with all the drama and stupidity that they bring.</br></br>  <br> flower pattern </br>  <br>You'll only get a response of the same level of effort you put in, if my response seem like blatant shitposting then it's obvious yours are as well.</br>  <br>Do you want me to feed you some replies?<br>I remember you being left alone in the Iroha thread, you poor soul.</br></br>  <br>Man, I be 8man never washed that shoulder again.</br>  <br>You sure got him anon</br>  <br>Considering that sexualizing the girls brings him PTSD it's probably the first thing he did. I think Hachiman will be fully healed once he can entertain the thought of having a girlfriend without getting triggered by his past.</br>  <br>You were the one that got pissed off weren't you<br>Nice to see that you still are</br></br>  <br>All me</br>  <br> balance <br> for a girl like Iroha <br>she's probably gonna dump 8man after she sees another alpha, she's a one night stand for him at best</br></br></br>  <br> implying Iroha wouldn't make the perfect wife when Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother and Yui would drive 8man to suicide since it's likely their chilren would get killed by a easily preventable accident since she's stupid </br>  <br>If anyone's going to drive him crazy it's Iroha and her manipulative ways.</br>  <br> Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother <br>not after muh character development<br> Yui would drive 8man to suicide since it's likely their chilren would get killed by a easily preventable accident since she's stupid <br>Yui will kill 8man through diabetes and he'll never get to father children because she's too sweet and cute<br> Iroha wouldn't make the perfect wife <br>right, then she'll be coming home later and later after meeting a publishing editor<br>sluts never change anon, let that be a life lesson to you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino<br> Divorce after a couple months of marriage because she bitches about everything <br>Yui<br> Boring marriage (Yui too dumb) <br> 8man ends up either in the hospital trying to save the suicidal dog or child from the truck or NTR her with a coworker </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll drive him crazy from all the teasing and get him to fuck her rough.<br><br><br>Yukino wll take after her bitch mother, this is a 100% guarantee<br><br>Yui is retarded and would downgrade 8man's genetic stock.<br><br> right, then she'll be coming home later and later after meeting a publishing editor <br>sluts never change anon, let that be a life lesson to you<br><br>Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother <br> not after muh character development <br>So for you a Yukino character development is a complete change in her character? You might as well say you like her because of her japanese beauty traits</br></br></br>  <br> Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman <br>So do the other two girls, and they're the only ones we've seen putting any effort into it.</br></br>  <br>The other girls only want 8man to reach his genuine-ty, what Iroha wants is genuine for herself.<br>If anything, Yui is the biggest transgressor against genuine since she wanted to keep the status quo and I have no idea whats up with Yukino but going back to the destinyland she wants something neither 8man or Haruno have which probably alludes more to independence than something genuine.<br><br>Only Iroha and 8man share the same goal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Still better than ending up with Iroha. She may want genuine but once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train</br></br>  <br> Still better than... <br><br>At least put some effort into defending your waifu</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> thinking 8man wouldn't like Yukino's bitchiness <br>he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional<br> the only reason they're going to divorce is because he's been accidentally fucking other girls behind her back </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was never a waifufaggot like you, it's just clear to me that unloyal girls aren't worth anyone's time</br>  <br> once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train <br><br>how nice you ignored the efforts 8man is spending on Iroha. Helping her win the election, helping her organizing Chrismas event, caring bags, boxes and other things (this is important), remembering birthday etc.<br><br>Traditional and cliche course, but from other (and Iroha) perspectives it's obvious that he is hitting on her (and winning scores also).<br><br>Meanwhile Yukipasta is too busy copy other, and Yui still wet-dreaming about "someday dates"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm a Yukinofag <br>Yes, I meant that once she reaches final form she won't be bitchy anymore to 8man, it's barely a complete change in character</br></br>  You know, I think it's strange how Irohafag arguments against Yui and Yukino as relationship partners never amount to more than meme-tier nonesense like "Copypastanon" and "Yui a dumb"<br><br>It's almost as if they don't have any real ground to stand on or something.</br></br>  <br>She will drive him mad, alright. Just not the way you were hoping for.</br>  <br> he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional <br>It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? That's the number 1 reason of a divorce<br><br><br>Oh okay, so you are just a shitposter/hater</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> efforts 8man spending on Iroha <br>so the next guy who sees a cute girl and flirts with her she'll fall for? <br> boxes and other things (this is important) <br>you're saying that a for a girl like Iroha, a guy helping her out will win her heart too. If you don't think that's sluttiness then your waifu goggles are on too tight.<br><br>At least the other girls won't whore themselves out, loyalty is miles better than being a slut.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dragging out that poorly written copypasta again?<br><br>I mean the concept is amusing sure, but it's worse than that time I tried to actually read 50 Shades of Grey.</br></br></br>  <br> if he isn't a cancerous waifufaggot he's a shitposter/hater <br>You believe whatever you want, friend.</br></br>  <br>Let it flow.</br>  <br>The truth my dear friend, is that Yuifags and Yukinofags have nothing going on for their generic waifus which leads them to lash against each others and other girls</br>  <br> But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? <br>Did you even read the fucking LN? 8man was never tired of her banter. Sure he complained about it but he legitimately enjoys his interaction with her. You have literally no basis for the argument of that he'll leave her if he's bitchy.</br></br>  <br> Implying you aren't a shitposter <br>It's like you don't even read what you post</br></br>  <br>I'm still not hearing any arguments. I'm gonna assume you ran out of them.</br>  This fucking thread.  <br>Why are Yukinofags and Yuifags such slutloving fucks?<br>Give me a proper post and you'll receive a proper reply.</br></br>  yukino with cat ears is too much  <br>Yes, I read the LN. And if your reading comprehension wasn't this low, you would realize I said<br> It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. <br><br>They don't spend all the day together and banter, they just do it when classes are over and they are in the clubroom. Another different story is when you live 24/7 with someone with whom your only interaction is just insults</br></br></br></br>  <br>Before asking for arguments, present yours instead of this low quality bait</br>  <br>The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse.<br>And I was just judging the girls based on how I saw them, if you that triggers you I don't give a fuck</br></br>  <br> I can't present any arguments so I'll just call the other girls sluts based on no actual fact <br>Nice one</br></br>  Just posting the best girl  <br>Yukino offers 8man an intellectual equal and a mental sparring partner to keep him on his toes.<br><br>Yui provides him with emotional support and validation that he's sorely in need of along with gentle pushes to become a progressively better person.<br><br>Iroha is cute, manipulative, and claims she wants something genuine.<br><br>And last but not least, 8man actually cares about his relationships with Yukino and Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yui is dumb and wouldn't be able to hold a stimulating conversation with 8man. <br><br> Yukino's feeling are not genuine, she has redistributed her feelings for hayama to 8man (being her white knight and a person she can rely on). Furthermore, she is confusing love with dependency. <br><br> Iroha is still unproven in being genuine. <br><br>That's why he should get together with Saki or just date one of Orimoto's cute friends (Orimoto will be 8man's wingwoman).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think Yukino will be 24/7 bitchy with him? You're lying if you think that every interaction with him is just her 100% insulting him.<br><br>You're also projecting too hard, just because you won't be able to take bitchiness doesn't mean 8man can't. He has taken it and given it back, you have no proof he will leave her if she acts like she does.<br><br>Not to mention if he enters a marriage with her won't he be prepared to face that? Assuming he would be dating her after high school ends, that leaves several years where he would experience it. I'm 100% sure 8man can deal with it, no matter how far you want to project yourself onto him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse. <br> Didn't even present an argument about not being a shitposter <br>Yes, you are a shitposter, and a very retarded one if you are saying all waifufags are shitposters</br></br></br>  <br>Are we reading the same LN?<br> Everytime they talk Yukino throws some insults to him or mocks his family name <br> 8man tries to get back at in his inner monologue but he's too beta to speak his mind <br><br>Apart from the drama dialogues and unfunny cat jokes, she has always talked to him with one-sided insults</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like you beat out Cap Cunt nowadays.</br>  The funny thing is, not once have I talked bad about the YY girls until today and I was proud of that fact.<br>Guess we should let these threads die.</br>  <br>He stopped the cuntkilling after 4 months. These threads should also stop, there's nothing to discuss and 28 IPs after 6 hours is just lame</br>  I didn't see any new Yahari figs in the Wonfes threads yesterday, I thought this series was popular!  <br> Considering that sexualizing the girls brings him PTSD <br>That's only new 8man, he has no problem sexualizing Yukino and Yui in the past.<br>Up until the camping trip he kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind.</br></br></br>  <br>You just won't stop, huh?<br><br>Fine, here's your reply, seeing as this is your second attempt this thread.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet she gets disappointed when he doesn't fight back, it's not like she insults him out of malice.<br>Rather she's pretty similar to Haruno in this regard, just like how Haruno likes etasiing and scaring Yukino, Yukino likes to tease Hachiman but she likes it when he at least bites back.</br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> Putting in any effort <br>Don't skip your meds friend, take it from a guy with ADHD.</br></br></br>  <br> girl a draw <br> boy it a call <br>Let we keep do why happening this?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha <br> loyal <br><br> not a filthy slut who chase after two guys at the same time <br><br>Irohafags sure are delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying that isn't the only reason because we love him</br>  <br> Yui is a two-timing slut chasing after 8man and cookie guy <br> Yukino is Hayama's sloppy seconds <br> Iroha is an innocent kouhai who is going after the cool senpai which is usual of cute kouhais, besides if you arent a dense MC you would know this is just a masquerade of her own, extending her slyness even further </br></br></br>    Please don't war about waifus<br>Why can't we just appreciate our 8.8/8 male model Hikigaya-kun? He's leading on three girls at the same time and is going to  reject  them all because he's just that alpha.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/oallemjcap.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>This Ikemen</br>  Hello faggots, anyone have the link of 8man and Saika doujin? No sadpanda  <br>Does Iroha still admire Hayama? Yes.<br>Does she still has a shallow crush on him? Quite likely.<br>Has a more serious interest on 8man? Yes.<br>Going after him harder and harder as time passes? Yes.<br>Does she lie about all of those? No.<br><br>Iroha is the most honest one out of the girls, both Yui and Yukino are full of shit. It's almost as if she's  genuine. <br>Besides, Iroha is precisely his type, whether you like it or not.<br>No wonder 8man has no complaints about her and is busy lusting over her, trying not to fall for it while having to deal with double YY bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Yui’s pretty nice too, but she’s kinda air-headed, ya know?” <br><br> Oh, yeah. She was pretty air-headed. But for someone as idiotic as him to say that was pretty much the pot calling the kettle black. <br><br> “Also, it’s obvious she’s popular, so there’s lots of competition.” <br><br> … <br><br> Well, yeah, I guess <br><br> Nice girls are popular. It’s scary how unpopular and clueless guys are so attracted to them. They reeled you in hook, line and sinker. You ended up blue in the face like Grander Musashi. <br><br> That’s why I won’t get surprised I won’t tremble I won’t get taken off guard I won’t be shocked I won’t tremble I won’t get surprised. What the hell? I was trembling like a leaf. <br><br> Indifferent to my quiet sighing, Tobe went on <br><br>Meh, 8man is such a hypocrite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being genuine and having "something genuine" aren't the same thing.<br><br>8man gave an abstract definition of an idealistic relationship. Just because a person is honest with themselves doesn't mean they'll be able to understand and be understood by others.</br></br></br>  <br>If she was genuine she wouldn't use Hayama as a pretense to get with 8man and actually go after him genuinely. She's his type but he's lusted after the other girls as well. <br><br>And in the end, no matter what you say, he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't genuine, not yet at least.<br>None of the girls are genuine yet except for Miura.</br></br>  <br> And in the end, no matter what you say <br>Welp.<br> he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning <br>Is this going to become a meme?<br><br>Didn't know WW posted here, I'm sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is precisely his type <br>Kek<br><br>Come back when your waifu gets the beauty description like Yukino does.</br></br></br></br>  <br> miura <br> implying <br>if anything it'd be Dayone who is genuine - genuinely gives no fucks.<br>Something is hilarious? laugh at it<br>Something sounds good? preach it<br><br>She's honestly too good for 8man. Glad she isn't part of the 8bowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No wonder 8man has no complaints about her <br>Because he doesn't care about her enough to complain about her? <br>And if you think she's more genuine than the other girls then you're delusional</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is much further from genuine than Y+Y, and there's no more damning scene than the cooking class. Almost immediately after 8man inadvertently sideswipes her with his "but I don't hate it" what does she do but run off to Hayama. She's not remotely ready to be honest with her feelings nor do we see any signs that she struggles with the fact that she should be like Y+Y are.<br><br><br> Is this going to become a meme? <br>If calling out things you hate that are blindingly evident is a meme, then yes. It'll probably be the biggest meme since Batman.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I disagree with it so it's a meme <br>Deep down you know it's true, don't be delusional</br></br>  <br>That isn't a type either.<br>8man's real type is someone who will take care of him and let him do what he wants.<br><br>Komachi fills this roll because his mom is always sleeping or working.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari's definition of genuine doesn't make any difference when double YY are still fake to the core.<br><br>Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else.<br>8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him.<br><br><br><br>Ayy, we're back at volume 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who is this cookie guy you are talking about?</br>  <br>A joke.</br>  <br>Hayama, the answer is always Hayama.<br>Yui wanted cookie man and was trying hard to fit in his group<br>Yukino gave him choco and did who knows what else with him.<br>Iroha wanted him too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> double YY are still fake to the core <br>please justify this claim<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>didn't he say himself that he wants to understand, not be understood?<br> Ayy, we're back at volume 8. <br>and you still aren't out of your delusion, are you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari's definition of genuine doesn't make any difference when double YY are still fake to the core. <br>Yui and Yukino are in the middle of something called character development. If you're really so shortsighted as to think things won't change then I suggest you read/watch a few more stories to get a better understanding of how literature differs from reality.<br><br> Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else. <br>How would you know? Like I said just because someone is honest with themselves doesn't mean they will suddenly be understood by others or understand others.<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>I'm going to need to know why you think that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason why you waifufaggots like Iroha is because you're all self inserting and want an aggressive slutty girl to make the first move <br><br> inb4 Iroha has no emotional baggage <br><br>Relationships are all about overcoming those, what do you expect? Happily ever after?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to need to know why you think that. <br>Because she lied to him to get him to do something, which apparently means she understands him.</br></br>    <br><br>Iroha is a fox.</br></br>  <br> "Hikki, here, to thank you for that time." <br><br> And with that said, Yuigahama took something gently out from her bag. A beautiful wrapping that contained cookies was held reverently by both her hands. <br><br>It was just confirmed recently that cookie man is Hikki all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,  Totsuka is the little fox. </br>  I was better off lurking.  <br>A relationship with literally no emotional difficulties is destined to crash really hard in any story<br>8man and Iroha's relationship is no different</br></br>  <br>I am sincerely biting just becasue there is nothing else to fuel these threads: and look, it has even spawned some conversation relating to the current psyche the girls have right now. Maybe it wasn't that bad to contribute to the shitposting a little.</br>  <br>Well, they're right that she understands how 8man thinks, but that's hardly unusual. both Hayama and Haruno have a pretty good grasp of that too, as does Yukino when she's not busy building more pedestals to put him on. Yui understands him too, just on an emotional level instead of an intellectual one.<br><br>The reason Irohafags shout so much about Iroha understanding 8man is because she weaponizes it to get her date. Whether that's anything to actually be proud of is a completely different story though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, me too. I was totally biting all those times just to makes the threads go longer. I in no way responded for any other purpose.</br>  <br>My brother in arms.<br>We are the real batmans, sacrificing our integrity for the sake of discussion.</br></br>  <br>and they call her the most genuine when she uses Hayama as a front to get closer to 8man<br><br> inb4 3rd grade hikigaya certificate <br><br>that's only because she understood his tendency of being a shut in, but let's be honest. who doesn't out of the three? that line gets way too much credit than what it actually entails.</br></br></br></br></br>  This shit is almost as bad as Haganai threads back then, almost.<br>But it's still a disaster.</br>   we were supposed to be discussing about best guy <br> instead we go back to waifu wars <br>I hope cute coffee fearing 8man will change your minds</br></br>  <br><br><br> disagrees with what is being discussed <br> can't find any arguments against them <br> resorts to posting 3D reaction images straight of funnyjunk instead of just ignoring it <br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called out on bait <br> continues to bait <br>We get it, you really like the b2b threads</br></br></br>  <br> Sees irrefutable arguments <br> Calls it bait <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yet you keep responding and bumping the thread<br>Again, just because you disagree with it doesn't give you an excuse to shitpost</br></br>  <br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>8man is a qt when having a crush.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he no longer batman.</br>  <br>Batman can feel emotion<br>but he still does what he as to do, like when he told Yukino do fix her shit herself</br></br>  I don't keep up with these thread so sorry for asking, but has Volume 11 been completely translated yet and If so, where can I find it, since spyro only did chapter 1?  <br>Spyro's been busy with work or some shit. That or Yen Press kidnapped him.</br>  <br>Spyro is dead buddy<br>some anons translated the Iroha spoonfeeding scene, I can't spoonfeed the link to you because I didn't read it<br>they also translated the final scene which I'm too lazy to find</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, that's unfortunate, thanks for the answer.</br></br>  <br> translated the final scene <br><br>http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br></br>  Anybody got the scans of the BD special volume n ?  <br> kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind. <br>I'm interested in Yukino's lack of reaction to this, she didn't get mad, she didn't blush, she just kind of stared back.<br>Second time he does it she doesn't pay his staring any mind.<br>Third time she just casually covers herself up.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people still think 甘すぎだな means the same thing as just 甘すぎ?  Where I can read the raws of the last chapters?  <br>We don't. And I tried talking about his final line "甘すぎだな " on the Iroha thread but there was no interest.<br> I still think he meant "too naive", and not "too sweet". </br></br>  <br>Come back when 8man actually sexualizes Yukino in a recent volume.<br><br><br>8man lied about that. He likes spoiling Komachi, just like he likes spoiling Iroha.<br><br> says Komachi takes care of him <br> yet his "big brother instinct" is always as a caretaker <br><br>8man's central conflict as a character is that he actually wants to be a good person, but he's so jaded/self-conscious that he pretends to be a lazy asshole instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What did sensei imply by this?  <br>That it's fine for them to go at it raw.</br>  <br>Surely they're too smart to try something so risky.</br>  <br>The reason the discussion died is that, as the biggest flag in the series so far, it's been shitposted the hardest. It's also pretty ambiguous.<br><br>That said the statement is too significant for it just to be talking about the chocolate. There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition.<br><br>That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes, he just didn't have time to do it in volume 11 because he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner.</br>  <br>He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis but he doesn't sexualize Yukino anymore since he seems completly focused on her beauty instead to think of anything like that.</br>  <br>What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? I ask you to reconsider this, my man, for this type of thinking is what lead to British men avoiding helping young children in distress in fear of being accused of being a paedo.<br><br>If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes <br>My dad works for Yen Press.<br><br> he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner. <br>The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I was using the term in a more generalized sense to include those.<br><br><br> The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic. <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>nigga you can't actually be that dumb.<br><br> Holy shit i got a number captcha. Did I go back in time by accident or something? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That's pretty much what I stated on that thread. He had no reason to just walk up to Iroha and praise her while she's doing her thing.<br><br>Even less reasons to say "too sweet" in the end if he's just done licking the remaining choco and when he loves sweet tasting stuff.<br> There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition. <br>I like this. Iroha herself asked him if he disliked the sweetness, but we know that she wasn't talking about the damned choco taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That was 100% onii-chan instincts. Everything else not so much, but his initial approach was very obviously just him playing the kind older brother.</br></br>  <br> What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? <br>You're ignoring this senpai is 8man, who avoids social interactions like the plague and vehemently denies any kind of positive relationship with Iroha whatsoever.<br><br>You're also ignoring the additional connotations to the compliment he went in with ("You're amazing") which Watari specifically created within the story.<br><br>Iroha immediately rejected him for a reason you know.<br><br> If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic. <br>If it were Komachi he'd say "I love you".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis <br><br>I don't think so. Most of time 8man just bothered by her Yuis than sexualizing her because he knew how dangerous it is to him(possible make him out of control) and tries his best to avoid it.<br><br>Just like in this scene. <br><br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he only avoids them because he has been alone, Iroha is something different than just an acquaintance, she's like a second little sister to him -- and 8man is deep down is an amiable man whom if close to will definitely respond with some warmth as he does with double YY.</br>  <br>This general has deprived the ability for me to distinguish whether this is satire or not</br>  <br>That's because you've finally realized that there's legitimate arguments to be made for practically any argument about a character or relationship due to how consistently unclear or ambiguous the author is.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing in this<br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! <br>That's not sexualized.  What the fuck dude, really? <br>You're blaming WW for being ambiguous even though you are literally retarded to not think that it's not sexualization</br></br></br></br>  <br>That means he still thinks of her Yuis as sexual and fears them as such.<br><br>This is what looking at someone's chest non-sexually looks like.<br> Stop it! Don’t squish Yukinon anymore! She already has to deal with the blowing wind that runs across the open fields of Kanto, namely, her chest! If you’re going to keep pressing her together like that, at least do it in an upwards-like manner! </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you believe in your opinions very strongly.<br><br>I however choose to understand that there are many different perspectives to be had on any topic and that any one of them could be correct.<br><br>There are times when you can analyze something further to gain a better understanding of it but in cases like this the knowledge gained is all but entirely irrelevant so it's simply not worth it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> legitimate arguments <br> posts 8man sexualizing Yui and say it's not him sexualizing Yui </br></br>  <br>Let's say that they are, Iroha still recognized it as 8man making a pass at her, and it was still significant enough that 8man was thinking about his rejection after the encounter. <br><br>Maybe now that Iroha is aware that 8man has an imouto he dotes on, she drew the connection between that and how he treats her. So when he compliments her, he calls them "sweet nothings", IE she recognizes that 8man's being non-genuine by being affectionate to her like an imouto, and she's telling him that she sees through it.<br><br>Here 8man fails to tsukkomi her rejection for the first time, and just sighs, and she shoves the spoon in his mouth. Maybe she thought he felt the rejection and did it to give him a pat on the back.<br><br>Then there's the chocolate conversation which is significant but I still am not really sure what she's referring to. If anything now it's even more unclear because she could be confirming 8man's feelings toward her, or she could be asking 8man to confirm his feelings toward her. It's really hard to say.<br><br>In any case the scene actually draws a huge parallel between 8man and Iroha, because it turns the tables and says that 8man's (intentionally or not) flirting with Iroha with Komachi as a pretense, whereas the usual interpretation is that Iroha flirts with 8man with Hayama as a pretense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant<br>That doesn't mean you should even remotely entertain retards like this </br></br>  <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>Sexual desires are precisely what sets apart platonic and romantic love.</br></br>  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br>Interesting. What is your reasoning behind this statement.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand. Why did they make eye contact after sensei said that?</br>  <br>And yet there is still so much more to them than just sexual desire. It's almost as if romantic relationships aren't defined solely by that one factor.</br>  <br>They considered for a moment what they would do if they didn't have to fear the repercussions of their actions.<br><br>Really though it's probably just to reaffirm that they understood that sensei was talking about the service club's problems.</br></br></br>  IROHA OR DEATH !  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br> this i know btw </br></br>  <br> Iroha accuses 8man of being "sly" on multiple occasions <br><br> Iroha learns 8man has an imouto <br> immediately suspects he's a siscon <br> later gets 8man to declare being a siscon <br> this shows Iroha understands the nature behind how he treats her <br><br> 8man nonchalantly walks up to Iroha and calls her amazing for being able to cook <br> Iroha rejects 8man and calls his compliment "sweet nothings" -- In other words, Iroha rejects 8man for being non-genuine. <br> 8man sighs <br> Iroha shoves the spoon in his mouth to get his attention <br> Asks him if he likes sweetness <br> Asks him if he likes her sweetness/the kind in their relationship <br> 8man answers favorably to both <br> "Thanks for the reference" then immediately drops the conversation to talk to Hayama <br><br>I think I finally understand what happened there. Iroha called 8man out on being non-genuine, then makes him confirm his feelings, then gives him a taste of his own medicine (by pretending their flirting was a reference for Hayama) to show him how he's being "sly" to her.<br><br>Basically the conversation was Iroha saying that she's interested in 8man, but he needs to get his act together first. This is also consistent with how she encouraged him to be a publishing editor in 10.5. She likes him but doesn't want to enable a manchild. 8man's "甘すぎだな" shows that he was contemplating the exchange that took place, showing that she managed to get through to him at least on some level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not up for a philosophical debate<br>I'm just here to shitpost like everyone else</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't try to communicate such ideas unless you wanted them heard.</br>  <br>Scene was different in the LN.<br> “I see, then let me scold you properly.

If she does any more and I suffer even more body injuries, I’ll become used goods and I’ll have to have you take responsibility and take me for a husband. But wait, that’s actually my goal all along… <br> While I was restless about various things, Yukinoshita looked perfectly calm. <br> “I don’t mind since I’ve never been scolded before.” <br> “Yukinoshita, being scolded isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It just means that someone’s looking out for you.” <br> Yukinoshita’s shoulders dropped slightly from Ms. Shiratsuka’s words. She lowered her head and looked downwards. I hadn’t the slightest idea if something had caught her eyes or not. <br> Ms. Hiratsuka gently patted Yukinoshita’s shoulder. <br> “I’m looking over you, so don’t worry and make all the blunders you want.” <br> We got off the taxi that drove us back and Ms. Hiratsuka began walking in the opposite direction of the hotel. <br> “I’m going to go buy some sake for a good drinking session. See you. Be careful on your way back.” <br> Is that really okay? <br> Ms. Hiratsuka waved her hands and we responded in the same fashion. Yukinoshita and I began walking towards the inn. We were both silent but I felt this was completely natural for the both of us. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yahari Ore no OVERANALYSIS Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru  <br>Yahari is the Monogatari of this generation.</br>  <br>The people that had no idea what happened in this show left ages ago so now we're stuck with faggots that analyze everything.

Why do they like talking about those things so much?” <br> W-What kind of conversation could that be… It wasn’t of any interest to me, but it felt like she’d get angry at me if I asked about it so I kept it to myself. Instead, times like this were where I should say something to ensure my well-being. <br> “Well, you should consider getting into it yourself if you’re going to get asked about it. Not a bad thing, right?” <br> “You talk like it has nothing to do with you. In the first place, during the Culture Festival, you…” <br> The stare that looked down on me turned into a sharp glare that pierced at me halfway through. <br> “M-Me…? No, wait. I’m not at fault here.” <br> I hadn’t a clue what she was referring to, but for now, I made sure to be insistent about it. When I did, Yukinoshita pressed against her temples and closed her eyes. She opened her mouth in resignation. <br> “…It’s nothing.

So I'll go first. <br><br>I'm an Irohafag because I generally prefer younger girls, especially the fun flirty type that like to tease you. I literally can't into serious relationship but having someone to mess around with is pretty fun. I understand that people can fall into situations where until a certain point they can't choose between one person or the other. All those poorfag Iroha theories just sort of make me like her more, it contributes to her character in a way. I like the sweater she wears under her blazer and its long sleeves. I like the colors of her eyes and hair. I'm an absolute sucker for her VA.

He assumes the worst possible outcome in any given situation. His most proficient magic was related to time and its manipulation to change outcomes.

The antihero doesn't get to see the world saved because he doesn't want to. He just wants to hurt the bad guys.</br>  <br>SIX BILLION PEOPLE</br>  <br>The series would have been better if there are other's that know how to bend the rules like him</br>  <br>That's more like the only magus with a combat sense rather than common sense.<br>Magecraft isn't made for fighting to begin with, so why should magi have combat sense, exactly? This is like demanding a scientist know exactly how to turn their chemicals into high explosives and where to place them to bring down architecture.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that what scientists are doing today?</br>  <br>The level to which Gilgamesh would completely wreck his shit forever is a big reason why not. The power levels in the show fluctuate like its fucking DBZ. Tohsaka goes toe to toe with fucking caster. For a prolonged period of time. Guns have a pretty finite power level so he's tied to the same fate as homura where he uses guns and bombs while Gilgamesh is fucking opening the earth's womb and drawing out the concept of 'sword' and cutting time and space or some shit.<br><br>I mean he basically is homura vs god madoka at that point so I guess we could see some cool power stealing shit but it wouldn't be fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea the part about scientists breaking down buildings makes sense, i'm not joking</br>  <br>And in every route ,in every series, lancer dies a shitty death</br>  <br>There are weapons scientists, but if you think a geologist or a neurologist would make a good one then you have no idea what science fields even do.</br>  <br>The powerlevels in F/SN and Zero are very consistent, Nasu and Uro just know that being more powerful doesn't mean you're going to win.</br>  <br>Got me there man :c lancer is my favorite class. <br>I don't know the show is fucking retarded and at the end of the day its the power of friendship that wins it all and nothing matters.</br></br>  <br>You're actually retarded if you think the "power of friendship" has any role in F/SN and Zero.<br><br>The only Fate work Nasu's written where that shit shows up is CCC.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought CCC was the power of love.<br>Not, like, "I l-like you senpai" love but "I want to ride your dick" love.</br></br>  <br>I thought "i love you senpai" and "i want to ride your dick" aren't mutually exclusive?</br>  <br>A human being has the most powerful noble phantasm in Stay which is powered by mana given to him by his friend/love interest. The noble phantasm being a plane of existence where he is basically a god.<br><br>And we are comparing this to where he was earlier in the series making sticks slightly harder.</br></br></br>  <br> Unlimited Blade Works <br> "the most powerful noble phantasm" <br> "where he is basically a god" <br>You don't actually know anything about this story, do you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reality marble in which he can copy all other weapons and their abilities as long as he has seen them. Just about every other class' offensive noble phantasm is based upon their weapons so he technically has access to that too. <br><br>So he just copies rule breaker, makes a hundred copies and fires them around just doing whatever the fuck he wants because that's what Unlimited Blade Works does.</br></br></br>  <br>Creating a hundred copies of Rule Breaker would be functionally useless, Rule Breaker has to be personally stabbed into someone. It doesn't work at range.<br>Beyond that, it doesn't kill servants, merely sever the connection to their master. Almost all servants can still fight on after that, Berserkers excluded.<br>Beyond that, effectively all servants can deal with a barrage of 100 copies of the same extremely shitty weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>I love kiri2gu but it's better when he dies. It also makes F/SN much more tragic in retrospect, considering how Shirou tries to follow in his footsteps.</br>  <br> common sense <br><br> fucked up in Fate due to Fuyuki fire <br> most likely fucked up in Prisma resulting in adoption <br> still fucks up in Miyuverse by going mind of steel again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rule Breaker is not nearly that 1 dimensional. Rule Breaker ACTUALLY negates magical contracts with objects and people and noble spirits it comes into contact with. It causes magical bindings and contracts to 'betray' the other party of the contract. <br><br>So you could theoretically use it to break the connection with Gilgamesh's treasures and the Gate of Babylon, for an example.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't work on NPs</br>  <br>He was trying to be morally gray and never realised he was stuck in a black and white setting. That' no common sense.</br>  <br>Archer and Gilgamesh endings are pure friendship. Yes, even as a girl.<br><br><br>This may surprise you but UBW is actually pretty shit by Reality Marble standards and is mid tier as an NP.<br><br>Its also not powered by friendship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW is actually pretty shit by Reality Marble standards <br>I don't actualy think you can realy compare RMs.<br>I mean how do you compare it to Lair of the Beast King for example?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying that its raw combat potential is seemingly lower than most of the other ones we've seen before.<br><br>Its obviously got its niches where its way better than some of them and such, but its still not the best of them.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's bullshit.<br>  Of course, there are limits. No matter how low the rank, it is impossible for Rule Breaker to affect a Noble Phantasm. <br><br>It only works on magecraft, which most heroes don't use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the raw combat potential of a World filled with Chaos?<br>What is the raw combat potential of Sacchin's RM?<br> Remember it only drains ambivalent mana , not the odd </br></br></br>  <br> What is the raw combat potential of a World filled with Chaos? <br><br>Considering that the description of it is nearly exactly the same as the description of EA's attack? Probably huge, not to mention what we know of it non-speculatively is insane.<br><br> What is the raw combat potential of Sacchin's RM? <br><br>Not to sure, never played Melty Blood so I've not seen much of her.<br><br>Caster in Extra/CCC and Iskander both have pretty strong ones as well, and unlike UBW aren't said by Nasu to be pretty useless versus most servants so it can be assumed they're well above it on the tier list.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Caster in Extra/CCC <br>What?<br> Considering that the description of it is nearly exactly the same as the description of EA's attack? Probably huge, not to mention what we know of it non-speculatively is insane. <br>I mean he's basicaly unkillable but that's because he constantly deploys it in his own body.<br>The only 3 "offensive" moves he has are<br> spitting out parts of himself that become some sort of animal, he can't controll what comes out <br> Absorbing people if they are trapped <br> turning into the 999th Beast <br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iskander  <br>That's a noble phantasm that functions like a reality marble, not truly a reality marble.</br></br>  <br>Correct me if i am wrong but isn't Nrvnrsqr's beasts are a sort of RM(what i mean is that he basically has his RM on at all times to summon beasts and shit). <br>And Sacchin's RM, from what i've gathered, pretty much drains mana from everyone inside of it at a fast rate but don't take my word for it, could just be one of her abilities.<br><br>And i never played with Caster in Extra but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a non-conventional reality marble. It's a world egg that can be deployed. We have reality marble subspecies, so not everything literally has to be internal world --&gt; external world.</br>  <br>Meant Alice, not Tamamo. Should have been more clear.<br><br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively <br><br>True, its hard to determine his exact power level, but I still feel its a safe bet its higher up there than UBW.<br><br><br>Its an irregular RM, but it still is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice is a cheater and Archer still defeats her, so how could the queen's glass game be above UBW?</br>  <br>Because you use the Vorpal Blade to counter the Jabberwocky aspect of it. It'd be impossible for him to normally defeat her by his own power.</br>  <br> but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP. <br>You heared wrong.<br>She's one of the weakest servants seen so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger what<br><br>Tamamo is a fucking monster, she's mid-high tier in Extra and an utter beast in CCC</br></br></br>  <br>She's literaly the weakest out of the 3 low tier servants you can chose from.</br>  <br>CCC involves her getting her Origin form and then being boosted by the Mooncell due to being an aspect of a Solar goddess. Normally shed not be nearly that strong as a Servant.<br><br>You're right though, even normally she's a very respectably powerful Caster.</br></br></br>  <br> Nero <br> Archer <br> low-tier <br><br>Now I KNOW you're messing about. They're both mid-tier at worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>As a real heroic (or monstrous) spirit, Tamamo is unfathomably powerful.<br>But Hakuno didn't summon her that way, and got the mortal Tamamo, who is amusingly pathetic, but tries really hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As a real heroic (or monstrous) spirit, Tamamo is unfathomably powerful. <br>Only in the monstrous form.</br></br>  <br>Tamamo is mid-tier at worst as a servant even in Extra where she is at her weakest in canon.</br>  <br> being able to defeat Lu Bu, Shuwen, Gawain and a gimped Arc <br> low-tier </br></br>  <br>You are aware that this is literaly stated to only be possible because of Hakuno, right?</br>  <br> Artificially boosted by Aoko </br>  <br> fighting for utopia <br> pessimist </br></br>  <br>Sorry but please reread F/Z or even watch the anime if you don't realise that Kerry is a pessimist</br>  <br> getting your true stats restored after having them all reduced to E rank by a shit master <br> "artificially boosted" <br><br><br>Hell if anything its doubly impressive she probably beat most of them while still somewhat weakened</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> true stats, could literally give her EX strength if you wanted to gimp her. <br><br>I imagine you if stopped at her real stats, the later game would probably suck.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope you're just shit at comprehension.</br>  <br>It's not like enemy masters were complete retards though.<br><br><br>They mostly say "oh i got closer to my true power, nice". They only really say "wow you got my stats higher than they actually were" once you get them too high, around EX or so. And i only got them that high when i was messing around with cheat engine to see stats-damage relation(and it appears that pretty much every stat boosts your melee and skill damage, even luck; fucking Caladbolg went from 3k or so to 7k after i boosted luck or agility, don't remember, each stat increases damage by different amount though but it still increases) so you'd need some grinding or focusing only on one stat. <br>I actually beat the game without super charging my servants or anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her true stats are pretty much the recommended build for her.<br><br>Small amount of phys stuff for early game, then just pump mana absurdly high.</br></br></br>  <br> Only character with common sense  <br> Not mentioning Waver or Kayneth <br><br>Heck, even Tokiomi was less of an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaynet <br> I'm just gonna walk straight into the base/workshop of one of the 3 founding families of the grail war <br> Tokiomi <br> that Zouken fellow sure seems trustworthy, as does Kotomine <br><br>I think Rin probably has the most "common" sense unless it's about social situations</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to Uro, Tokiomi felt like Sakura could take care of herself, trials of a magus and all that.</br>  <br>At least Kayneth wasn't a self destructive fool. <br><br>Matous and Tohsakas were friends for ages. It'd be like doubting your own brother. <br>Kirei always acted like a nice guy, nothing to be afraid of. <br><br>Kayneth's "problem" isn't even a common sense problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Precisely because of that, it was nothing better than a godsend for the Matō house to hope to have Sakura as their adopted daughter. He had obtained the way to have both his beloved daughters inherit first-class magecraft, unconstrained by their bloodline’s consequence, and carve out their own lives </br>  <br> Kayneth's "problem" isn't even a common sense problem. <br>Remember how Rin constantly drills it into your head that attacking a magus in his workshop is basicaly suicide?<br>Remember how we actualy hear of entire enforcer and executioner squads getting wiped out while attacking someone's workshop in HA?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not Bizzare that Shirou never thinks about it because he is just plain fucking stupid and autistic in every way.<br>Why don't Fate/meme stop making their cancerous battle shounen moe/ecchi/SoL comedy video game threads and just fuck off so we can discuss a good show like Fate/Zero in peace and pretend the dumb low-budget sequel never happened?</br></br>    <br>Except that Kayneth was literally convinced that he was strong enough to murder Kerry. <br>Arrogance =/= Lack of common sense.</br></br>  <br><br>The problem was that he called the Matous shameful heretics of a failing bloodline in the prologue. <br><br>Which means he either gave her over with full knowledge of the fact he irresponsibly had another daughter, and that this was a bailout arrangement for him, making him both a bad parent and a terrible human being, or he really did change his mind about them, which would just make him an incompetent parent.<br><br>Either way he isn't a stellar parent, because getting power and being forced into a role isn't a choice no matter what he spins this with. He had her without acknowledging that only one child could get the crest and gambled on her being mediocre enough in potential that she gets under the radar, making no precautions if that didn't occur.<br><br>It's death or a terrible family who could ruin your genes and make life absolutely shit for you. The thing that keeps him from the terrible human being part is him wanting what's best for them in his own way. Doesn't save him from being incompetent though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you literally arguing that Shirou isn't a dumb, autistic fuck? End your life</br>  <br>I honestly agree with Kerry's ideals. It's just there would be no way to regulate 7 billion people on the planet. Plus until technology evolved to the point machines would take over regulating humanity Kerry would still have to rely on good old fashion humans to trust to follow your ideal and not succumb to the darkness or be an idiot to fuck up the system.</br>  <br>Tokiomi's logic is entirely that of a magus. From a human perspective, he's scum. From the perspective of magi, he's doing the right thing.</br>  <br><br>They weren't friends, they were business partners. People misinterpret the non-interference pact. Just like they had with the Einzberns, it was an agreement that basically meant they kept the winner as one of the three houses, and nothing more. A treatise between noble families, not an agreement amongst friends.</br></br>  <br> Edge: the show <br> good <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It isn't even logical from a magus standpoint. He wanted to protect her from other magi using her as materials, but gave her to the first guy who claimed he wanted her as his heir, even when he knew the family was a hair's away from extinction with rotten blood, no promising heirs to train her, and their place being exceptionally low in mage society. The only thing they have to offer is their knowledge. He was expecting a four year old to revitalize a dead house.<br><br>It would be like taking your perfect specimen child and making them have a kid with a guy with every genetic defect on the book. He just didn't even bother trying to find anyone more suitable after she was born, because he was stuck on maintaining the grail being with one of the three families. It's nonsensical if you look at it objectively.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Atleast try to pretend that you've read F/Z.<br>Tokiomi thought he was doing the best thing for Sakura</br></br>  <br><br>Parents do the wrong thing with the right intentions all the time. You can love your kids but have terrible judgement based on how you were raised. Those aren't mutually exclusive.</br></br>  <br>The best thing for sakura as a magus and as a parent (who is a magus). If he was willing to abandon the path as a magus, they probably all could have lived a happy little life without any interference. That idea would obviously never cross his mind.</br>  <br> abandon the path as a magus <br>Sure, and if Kerry just decided to kill himself he wouldn't have had to worry about anything anymore either! <br>Great plan.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh no it's literaly spelled out that neither Rin nor Sakura realy have the possibility to not learn magecraft because their talent/potential is just too big.<br> Now that he thought back, for Tokiomi, this was the best gift that his father gave him as the previous head of the family. <br><br> Tōsaka Tokiomi decided to enter the way of magecraft through his own will, and decided not to be swayed by fate. <br><br> It was indeed this preparation that gave Tokiomi an iron will. What supported him through the days of merciless, strict practices ever since then was indeed this proud overconfidence of ‘this is the way of life I chose for myself’. <br><br> If only he would be able to pass the treasure that he got from his father onto his daughter – Tokiomi thought sadly. <br><br> However, that was already impossible to be achieved. <br><br> For Rin and Sakura, there were no choices for them in the first place. <br><br> One of them has all elements, having five multiple elements as her alignment. The other has no elemental alignments, having Imaginary Numbers only. Both sisters have a rare potential that can be equated to miracles. This had surpassed the limits of so-called natural talents or inborn skill; it is almost like a curse. <br><br> A magical nature would equally gather magical powers to it. Prominent people who are far outside the rules inevitably ‘gather’ equally extraordinary experiences. This can not be controlled by the person’s own will. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he gave up his position as a Second Owner, disassociated himself from the Association, and simply went to live in the countryside so that his family could live in peace, that would be an accomplishable situation, especially in an area like Asia where the Association lacks influence.<br><br>Tokiomi is such a typical magus that he would never for a second think about giving up his path for his family because his family is a means to continue his path as a magus and his lineage's toil to reach the root.</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly he went off the wrong path. He could have been a good doctor or researcher. You can't save the world with destructive force only. I guess it couldn't be helped given what he had experienced. At least he realized at the end and was able to redeem himself.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>True Assassin has more common sense then he does.</br>  <br>And that's with them being in the limelight of the Association, with visitors coming regularly and such. Someone like Ciel remained completely hidden despite her insane potential until Roa took over. If Tokiomi went and became a simple salaryman living in a suburb somewhere, it would reduce the likelihood of such a situation.</br>  <br><br>No, he had to adopt her out, but that was the situation after the fact of her being special at birth. He knew only one child could get a crest, and any child as strong as she was without a family's protection could be taken by the Association as material via Sealing Designation (which is dumb either way).<br><br>The imprtant part is that he didn't review proper family planning, nor bothered to take the time after she was born to make prep for that inevitability, and just called it "fate". That was his warped mentality. He loved her as his daughter but made really bad decisions.<br><br>Like Kerry did with letting the Einzberns experiment on Ilya before she was born in her mother's womb. <br><br>Good parenting is rare in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for </br>  <br><br>Are you incapable of reading?<br>The text basicaly says that having such enormous potential draws things like Roa-possesion towards you.<br>Similiar to what Aoko said in the prologue of Tsukihime.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's too bad that despite that being the case, these special people have kids as carelessly as horny teenagers on prom night.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Why couldn't Tokiomi just let Sakura live a normal life? Just let her be a regular girl there isn't anything bad or evil about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh what?<br>Rin and Sakura are the "special" people.<br>Tokiomi is utterly mediocre<br>Also having more than 1 child is rather common among magi.<br>Sakura just had bad luck.<br><br> Why couldn't Tokiomi just let Sakura live a normal life?  <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's more philosophy than a hardcore rule. Due to her nature, she cannot simply be the "second useless child of a magus family meant to be married off as a bargaining chip" like Sola-Ui. So long as she is part of a magus family, she will always be at risk, whether someone happens upon her while visiting the Second Owner or someone connects the dots that "Rin = super, so sister = ?". In this hypothetical situation where Tokiomi acts as a human rather than a magus to protect his family from all suffering and abandons his path as a magus, hiding themselves away would be fairly safe. There's always the chance of a freak accident, but warding away such things would be within his ability to some extent.</br>  <br>He can't protect them from "all suffering"<br>That's impossible even for normal people and as a magus the road they have to go is full of suffering.<br>And the whole thing is that they need to be taught magecraft to defend themselves throughout their lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Rin and Waver are the most sane master in F/Z &amp; SN</br>  <br><br>No, Tokiomi didn't just have bad luck, he conveniently didn't know his wife's cootch spits out superbabies, even when the 500 year old mummy next door knew since the beginning. How Zouken knew and he didn't is baffling. Then again, Zouken also knew the grail was cursed and the Einzberns didn't, guess he is the only family head with a brain, unfortunately.<br><br>Even then, when you understand that your child can have such detrimental shit happen to them if they do become that special, what stops you from just stopping at one kid and being satisfied? Rin was perfect to fit bring the heir, and he got his student. He had no need for another daughter beyond just fucking his wife without thinking of the consequences.<br><br>And like another guy said, what stopped him from actually doing his work after she was born in finding a family? That can't be refuted, because not only was him cutting all ties a dubious action at best given her real family is in the same city, but there can't seriously be no takers for super kid to be their heir, that he was desperate for an adoptive family, he even had the Edelfelt family as a possibility despite their estranged history. And yet she goes to the worst proposition ever.<br><br>You can't give him the excuse of no choices. You also have to admit he made terrible judgements of both character and logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they were to live as normal people without using it, it would be much harder for anyone to sense. Even though he's shit, it's not like Rin or Kotomine once sensed him at all despite how often he uses it, so it's not like they can sense stuff over an entire city or anything. They would have to run into a very specific situation for anyone to realize they were special.</br>  <br>*Even though Shirou is shit</br>  <br> Even though he's shit, it's not like Rin or Kotomine once sensed him at all despite how often he uses it <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br> doctor and researcher <br>he was a researcher in Miyu's universe in prisma Illya, and still fucked up in the end, and even maybe killed by shirou</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but you can't discuss F/Z without mentioning F/SN because it's just a prequel. everything fate related is based from F/SN and you can't deny it</br>  <br><br>There's kind of a difference between using one pseudo circuit and having 27 "normal" circuits and Rin/Sakura's 1200 circuits  40 main circuits and 30 subcircuits each </br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with that post?</br>  <br>But the fact that a person can using it daily within his home and constantly within the same school building as Rin without once being suspected means it isn't particularly easy to sense at long or short ranges even with active usage. Rin and Sakura have large capacities, but if they were to never use them in an area completely devoid of any magical connections, it wouldn't bring about any suspicion unless somebody were to actively be next to them.<br><br>My original point is that from a magus standpoint, giving her away makes sense, even if the recipient is of dubious credibility, but that it isn't entirely out of the possibility that an OOC decision by Tokiomi could have let them lead normal lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean it's kinda stated that you can't keep people with such massive potential away from the supernatural.<br>As an example I could bring up Ciel who was never found and got Roa-ed</br></br>  <br>That's less of a rule and more of a like attracts like sentiment that often applies. It's not like Rin and Sakura just existing is going to make them supernaturally attract the supernatural, but that them being like that would make it more likely. For every Ceil that's fucked over, there should be plenty that die in obscurity. it's also a testament that Ciel lasted sixteen years without anyone finding her that it's not easy as easy as having a radar that just finds magical potential.</br>  <br>It should be noted how amazing a master Hakuno is. He/she'd be able to win a Grail war with Avenger.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128614808 <br>If you were thinking of watching the anime, his death isn't even in Zero. The nigga survives Zero, then you start UBW and he's already dead for a reason they don't explain and then you have to look the shit up and come to find out that in the VN he dies in-between due to some weird "Grail affected his body shit." I was like "Whatever man I'm just rolling with it."</br>  <br> his death isn't even in Zero <br>It's the very last scene.</br></br>  <br>Shhh...he's just sleeping.</br>  <br>you realize that Shirou has sub-circuits also and all that gets counted normally is main ones, right?<br><br>Saying Rin has 1200 circuits is absurd. She has 40.</br></br></br>  <br> you realize that Shirou has sub-circuits also <br>Eh no.<br>Please point me to a single instance where it's mentioned that Shirou has subcircuits.<br><br> Pseudo-nerves within the body of a magus. <br> Magic circuits are responsible for converting life force into magical energy, and for connecting to the underlying grand sorcery formula. <br> Because the number of magic circuits a person has is fixed at birth, magi lineages do what they can to improve themselves and create an heir with even one more magic circuit. <br> Once the magic circuits have been opened for the first time, the practitioner can switch them on and off at will. <br> Each practitioner visualizes the flipping of this switch in their own particular way. For Shirou, the image is that of a gun's firing hammer, while for Rin it is stabbing a heart with a knife. <br> This image tends to be related to how the circuits were opened for the very first time, so there even those who can only open their circuits through sexual arousal or self-harm. <br> By the way, Shirou's number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27. <br> Rin, on the other hand, has 40 main circuits, while her sub-circuits are 30 each. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an idiot to a tragicomic extreme. If he had even the least bit of common sense, he could have used it to figure out his entire plan was shit even a decade before entering the Grailbowl.</br>  I never understood the shit storm about Kiritsugu. He did everything he could to obtain the grail to save the world from violence. What if you knew that when you kill 7 people the world is guaranteed peace for eternity wouldn't you do it ?<br><br> inb4 edgemaster </br></br>  Does anyone have that one picture of female Gilgamesh without a shirt staring directly at the viewer? It was in a dimly lit room.  <br>Kayneth was such a fucking idiot.<br> summon a Servant so shit the only halfway realistic way to win is to keep a low profile and engage in hit-n-run tactics while hoping Lady Luck smiles on you <br> fucking draw everyone to his position and let him show off his entire skill set <br> waste a command seal on making him attack Saber despite the situation calling for a retreat <br> after revealing everything worth knowing about your team's capabilities, turtle up in the most high-profile hotel with no plan on how to proceed or even an idea of what the enemy combatants can do, showing your hand and gaining absolutely nothing for it but still act cocky <br> walk in blind and alone into the lair of a man known as the Magus Killer and promptly get your shit pushed in <br>And so on. Every time he does anything it just makes everything worse, and just about every single time it would have been easy to see in advance that his chosen course of action was moronic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the shitposting about Kerry comes because of the people claiming he was a genious and the best protagonist ever being more complex and deeper than Shirou.<br><br>He wanted a childish desire imposible to accomplish and he was willling to do anything for it. He was both dumb and idealist, but that's not bad.<br>I personally like Kirigitsugu, but trying to argue with Zerofags is impossible thus the arguments against Kerry are always exagerated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the motherfucker never realized that some things are worth trading the world for</br>  <br>Well it was idealistic desire but who knew that the "omnipotent wish granting device" would go "yeah, no that's not possible".</br>  <br>1. Enter the Holy Grail War<br>2. Win<br>3. Come before the Holy Grail<br>4. Make the Holy Grail to produce a result you cannot describe, in a way you cannot conceive, by presenting a wish you cannot put into words even after thinking about it for ten years<br>5. ????<br><br>His plan was shit from the very start. It was majorly flawed even if there wasn't the detail of the Holy Grail interpreting every wish as a command to kill all humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He could have saved more, but he was committed to the ideal "I'll never take a chance again after that Shirley thing. If it ever comes down to people being in danger, I'll immediately kill the smaller number of people in favor of the larger group"<br><br>Even the end of the story showed you why that logic is fucked, with the boat analogy. He killed the smallest amount of people, but because he will never take a chance he ended up killing the majority.<br><br>If he was willing to make some compromises he would have saved the majority in that situation, or if he had some people skills at least. His answer will always eliminate the smaller number though, he's not the only guy with logic in this series. No matter how innocent the smaller number and no matter how much of a non chance the death may be if he tries to save both, he won't take chances.<br><br>He'd kill every member of his family, if it meant he saved five people in the process. That's what kind of man Emiya Kiritsugu is here.<br><br>If someone was being held hostage by two people, he might just kill the hostage off the bat in order to effectively save the two people that are holding him up so they don't die in a police shoot out. As they might have to give themselves up now. Can't be helped, that was the smaller number after all. Yet with his track record they would still die as well, and we would still act like this made sense.<br><br>Hero of Justice these days feels like it goes hand in hand with "Killer who hides behind justice to exonerate himself most of the time, killing those that fall through the cracks himself in the name of altruism". Fate has mostly proven that a hero is one that kills those that get in the way for the majority in a sense. Doesn't matter who or why they were, but in the name of the majority its all it takes.<br><br>I'd take someone who just kills the bad guys, or tries to save everyone without compromise over that. Even if you failed on the second one, you tried to save everyone at least.<br><br>That's Batman</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please point to a single instance where any other magi is said to have sub circuits, especially Sakura who you've previously claimed has an equal number of circuits as Rin.<br><br><br>...oh, you can't? Because sub-circuits are never mentioned aside from a single time in any Nasuverse material and Rin is the only one who has ever had hers listed? And even then, only once to demonstrate that hers are particularly developed, implying other magi such as Shirou have a smaller number of them?<br><br>Well fuck its almost like sub-circuits should be assumed to be a regular part of any magi's circuitry that go unmentioned due to being unimportant.<br><br> B-b-b-but Rin has an amazing amount of magic power!!!! Of course she's unique and special and has sub-circuits nobody else has!!!!!! So I'm right to count them all the same as regular circuits when I say she has 1200!!! <br><br>Literally more than a years worth of her mana stored up in a Gem is equal to a single A offensive rank spell, and her maximum output is stated to be 1000.<br><br>Shirou can manage 270 before damaging his in the process.<br><br>If she actually had fucking 1200 circuits, 1160 of which are unique sub-circuits only she possesses, then her circuits would have to be an order of magnitude worse than his which makes no fucking sense since they're explicitly said to be high quality while his are trash.<br><br>The only logical conclusion based on the information we have is that sub-circuits are a vital part of any magi's circuitry and that they're not mentioned for anyone because they have no importance whatsoever to the story.<br><br>Ergo, Shirou has them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device if I had a plan how to execute my wishes I wouldn't need that shit in the first place.</br>  <br> Even the end of the story showed you why that logic is fucked, with the boat analogy. He killed the smallest amount of people, but because he will never take a chance he ended up killing the majority. <br>The boat analogy as Angra proposed it doesn't even work.<br>I mean holy fuck you don't change the thought experiment in the middle of it.</br></br></br>  <br> especially Sakura who you've previously claimed has an equal number of circuits as Rin. <br>It's directly stated in F/SN that Rin and Sakura have the same number of circuits<br> Shirou can manage 270 before damaging his in the process. <br>Where do you get that from?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device if I had a plan how to execute my wishes I wouldn't need that shit in the first place. <br><br><br>Its possible to formulate a plan to achieve fucking anything, but it doesn't mean its at all possible - for example, I could plan to kill a Rhino by having it be struck by lightning and slain instantly, but I can't summon the lightning.<br><br><br>Kiritsugu couldn't even conceive of the lightning. <br><br>Lighting as a concept doesn't fucking EXIST for Kiritsugu.<br><br>He wanted the rhino dead and fought in a death battle tournament in order to get the grail to kill it for him anyway, he had a dream but not the ability to even conceive of how it could be made to happen.<br><br>He charged blindly into it fueled by desperation and idealism, his plan was fucking awful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CCC has no power of friendship<br><br>Though it does have "Power of Origin"<br><br>Friendship alone gets you killed every time in that game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure,but his desire was extremely childish, and his inability of realizing if it was an unsustainable ideal made him look like a manchild. An extremely well-armed, emotionally dead, willing to do anything for his wish manchild.</br>  <br> It's directly stated in F/SN that Rin and Sakura have the same number of circuits <br><br>You know what scene that was? I actually tried to find the info on her before saying that so I'm surprised there's a canon source.<br><br>Source on Shirou:<br> By the way, Shirou's number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27. <br><br>And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged right after he opens them in F/SN for the first time properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> holding a gun while smoking <br><br>doesn't get any more edgy that this faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I'd consider the Gilgamesh and Archer endings power of friendship and the Saber and Caster endings power of love.</br>  <br> And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged right after he opens them in F/SN for the first time properly. <br>Eh no.<br>pic related<br>10times the capacity != 10 magical units</br></br></br></br>  <br> You know what scene that was? I actually tried to find the info on her before saying that so I'm surprised there's a canon source. <br><br>It was the scene with the gemsword and shadow giants  I think </br></br></br>  <br> but "I want to ride your dick" love. <br><br>Main love interest is noted to be entirely chaste, and its an innocent type of high school love between two fake humans who just recently became human, so they're still pretty childish in this manner you might say.<br><br>Its the main villain that's "I want to ride your dick" instead; despite the game acknowledging that lust and sexuality is indeed part of love and isn't evil, its simply part of it, it also shows that taken to an extreme will bring you nothing but folly. Main villain took her lusts too far and ended up losing to the innocent love between two fake humans, despite proudly trying to say that her love was the only real love.<br><br>The real lost to the fake, as her love was shown to be nothing but selfish and foolish in a way, while the pseudo humans love was selfless and for each other. Even Andersen admits defeat before this sappy type of stupid love story, then he calls his master a fucking idiot for picking a fight with the one person she never had a chance of beating even if she could beat everyone else on the planet.<br><br>Fetish and sexuality are themes in the game still; the game makes sure to weave them hand in hand with an innocent sort of love, as they aren't different things, rather that's all definitely part of love. Even if they're taboo in a way, they're certainly not evil, as everyone has such things. Goes as far as to list out the fetishes of everyone in the game. Its not like Disney where it just ends on a kiss and says that's as far as anything would go, rather throughout the plot it talks about different forms of love and meaning. Some loves are shown to be warped, yet the game does not decry them as wrong entirely either, even if they are cast down as it goes along.<br><br>MC does almost mount Nero during her route though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tamamo has nine selves, nine personas, one for each tail.<br><br>MC summoned the weakest self, the self that only relfects her ideal of serving others and loving humans, along with Tamamo being willing to take a few debuffs in order to be summoned to begin with.<br><br>If you summoned one of her more malicious selves, its noted it could get bad. Though if you summoned that she might just kill her master off the bat at worst. After all there are peronas within her like her bitterness and anger for the way she was killed.<br><br>Though her real form is one of the strongest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posting a picture from the gilgamesh vs shirou fight in UBW and trying to pass it off as if its from the scene i mentioned <br><br>poor form, anon<br><br><br>Cheers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was recently confirmed that Tokiomi knew about the wormrape, but didn't care as long as it meant her magic improved.<br><br> &gt;TMF: Do Tokiomi knew what was suffered Sakura after it was adopted by the Mato? <br> U: What is important is not to Tokiomi parentage but magical progress in his family. So it is aware of having literally threw his daughter. One can imagine that Tokiomi says that through his beloved daughter, he will arrive to have higher thaumaturgic powers. <br><br>[Outside interview]<br> Tokiomi knew what was going to undergo Sakura but for him, it would allow it to become a real magician. As long as it increases the potential thaumaturgical of his family, he had no problem with Sakura treatments in Mato. However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused. He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. Unconsciously, even if he would never have said, the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br> By against Aoi knew nothing. <br><br>Translated from a French interview</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also confirmed that he'd fucking hate Shirou as a son in law.<br><br> TMF: One last question Fate / Zero before moving on. How would he have reacted Tokiomi learning his relationship with Rin in Unlimited Blade Works and Sakura in Heaven's Feel? [Laughs] <br> U: It is not impossible that he would have been green with rage because it would penalize her magical power quest. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like there's gotta be something lost in translation here. Like Tokiomi knew she'd be filled with worms but not that it'd be done via rape instead of a surgical procedure or something.<br><br>Because holy shit he is literally the worst person in the fourth war - Kotomine included - if he knew what happened to Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br>TMF : Est-ce que Tokiomi savait ce que subissait Sakura après qu’elle a été adopté par les MATŌ ?<br>U : Ce qui est important pour Tokiomi n’est pas la filiation mais la progression magique dans sa famille. Donc il est conscient d’avoir jeté littéralement sa fille. On peut imaginer que Tokiomi se dit que, à travers sa fille chérie, il arrivera à avoir des pouvoirs thaumaturgiques supérieurs.<br><br>[Hors interview]<br>Tokiomi savait ce qu’allait subir Sakura mais pour lui, cela allait lui permettre de devenir une vraie mage. Tant que cela permet d’augmenter le potentiel thaumaturgique de sa famille, il n’avait aucun problème avec les traitements de Sakura chez les MATŌ. Cependant, s’il avait su le sort de Sakura, n’être qu’une matrice pour Zōken, il aurait refusé. Il s’imaginait aussi que si les choses allaient trop loin, Sakura pourrait d’elle-même stopper Zōken. Inconsciemment, même s’il ne l’aurait jamais dit, le combat entre Sakura et Rin à la fin d’Heaven’s Feel était pour lui la meilleure chose qui puisse arriver aux TŌSAKA.<br>Aoi par contre ne savait rien.<br>[/Hors interview]<br><br>TMF : Est-ce que Gil a un Gate of Babylon dans son Gate of Babylon ? Est-ce que ça fait une récurrence infini ?<br>U : Non, mais d’autres puissances peuvent peut-être s’en dégager, parce qu’à la base, c’était une arme qui était freiné. Mais le mieux, ça serait de poser la question directement à Nasu.<br>TMF : Mais il n’est pas là…</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not omnipotent. It's just very potent. He knows the principle behind how it works, because he knows the war is a ritual to aggregate mana into the Lesser Grail, and if he had any questions he could just consult the people who originally designed it, since he's been living with them for the last decade.<br><br>However, the problem wasn't whether or not it had the power, the problem was his wish, which really just amounted to a vaguely defined desire for the world to be a nice place. He couldn't say what he wanted and he couldn't say how he wanted it. Maybe the Grail would have been more helpful if it wasn't tainted by concentrated evil, but he still would have relied on an unknown variable to formulate his wish for him, to do something unknown, to remake the world into something unknown. It's just a bunch of question marks as soon as he reaches the Holy Grail. And he had at least a decade to think this part through.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're right.<br><br>"However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused" sounds a lot like it means he didn't know she'd be filled with the worms since half the point of them was to put one next to her heart to function as her main body and the other reason was to prepare her as a grail vessel, which may be the 'matrix' shit it mentions.</br></br></br>  <br> Cependant, s’il avait su le sort de Sakura, n’être qu’une matrice pour Zōken, il aurait refusé. <br><br>Yeah, translation provided above for this line seems accurate based on what I recall of high school French.<br><br>I think this anon has a point here possibly also<br>  <br><br>Without knowing the original Japanese response I can't really say what he meant by the 'matrix' line since I don't recall that exact phrasing being used before. <br><br>It could refer to her being raped by the worms until they were a part of her instead of them being passed on via surgery, or just the part of him using her as a vessel for himself/the grail.<br><br>Either way he's still a fucking cunt for sending her to a household he knew was gonna fill her with worms one way or another just so she'd know some magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, that's just saying if he knew she was just breeding stock, he would have refused.<br><br>He didn't care about the rape if it meant her potential increased, but he cared if she was just a means to an end to raise up someone else, y'know.<br><br>Tokiomi wanted it to be his own loin fruit that reached the end or fought against each other. Not for her to be used to give birth to someone else who would be power in a sense. It was something like that.<br><br>I can probably find original anon's summary<br><br>Original anon that translated a summary of it confirmed that much; the one I posted is just the google translate version to make it easier for people. Since it seemed like the Google translate got it close enough to be readable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> For the fate stuff, the most interesting parts is that Tokiomi knew the kind of treatment Sakura got, but he didn't give a shit, although he would have refused to give Sakura away if he knew Zouken was just using her as a womb and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. Also the Sakura Vs Rin is the best thing to ever happen to the Tohsaka family. <br> There is no gate of bayblon inside the gate of babylon. <br> Kiri views Taiga as a sister, but she's in love with him. <br> He didn't answer whether Waver will join Ionioi Hetairoi after he dies, it's a question of Waver's immortality he says. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers then for the clarification</br>  <br><br>Give me a source</br></br>  <br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it references her becoming a spare body for Zouken and being remade into a bootleg Grail vessel instead of being brought up as a magus. That she was treated as a system he could fiddle around with instead of as a pupil.</br>  <br> and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. <br><br>Its a realization in itself how stupid Tokiomi is if this counted as a plan.<br><br>She was an eight year old with no magic or understand of spells other than what Zouken himself taught her, he was a hundreds of years old vampire type being with plenty of magic and intelligence when it comes to surviving, and the first time he uses you for "training" you can no longer turn against him at all or else you're liable to be eaten alive from the inside out. He can kill you with a thought by the time you've reached the area of "Hey, I don't know about this sort of thing". Even if he doesn't have his familiars inside of you yet, I'm pretty sure he could overpower an eight year old and throw her in the pit pretty easily. No matter what she loses in that situation pretty easily.<br><br>She had no magic or power, and he expected her to somehow do something here as a powerless eight year old against this wormpire?<br><br>He's stupid<br><br>Teach her some magic first if you want this to actually be a plan, but for now that's just fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If this is from 2013 how comes that it has never been mentioned here or at BL?</br>  <br>Zouken at this point is patheticaly weak and uses nearly all of his magical energy to keep himself alive.</br>  <br>Even Rin couldn't kill him when she was trying, despite her getting the chance to fight him twice.<br><br>When it comes to survival, he's an existence that surpasses servants as a roach. He can beat up or capture an eight year old just fine.<br><br>Guy almost killed Shirou pretty easily in the story as well. Even without a servant for either of them, Shirou was right about to die and he knew it. He was able to surprise Zouken by almost summoning Saber, which created a slight stall effect despite it not working, and then Rider bailed his ass out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See this is yet another reason I think that this guy  may be onto something<br><br>It really does sound like he only knew she'd be treated like shit and have worms shoved in her, not that she'd be raped by them in the process, made essentially a slave, and used solely to carry Zouken's main body worm/prepped for breeding/turned into a grail vessel.<br><br><br>There's a lot of interviews even with Nasu that have never been translated or even found by the Western community due to them being in disparate magazines and various fansites only, I can believe one minor French one with Uro slipped through the cracks.<br><br>But yeah, it does seem somewhat suspicious.<br><br><br>But if Tokiomi actually knew what he was doing to Sakura he still should have known there'd be no way for her to EVER fight back, unless he was just so arrogant he assumed she'd come up with something even he couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> See this is yet another reason <br><br>I'd just say Tokiomi really is that stupid<br><br>He has that kind of track record here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I just really wanna believe that even he couldn't be that much of a callous, arrogant, massive retard.</br>  <br>But given certain circumstances you can only save one, or none. When both isn't a option, it's clear that you have to make a choice or just lose everything all together. There's is no "try to save everyone", that's the same as trying to pick both when it isn't possible. You can only hope for a miracle or take action.</br>  <br> over 7 billion people in the world  <br> your evil for thinning the herd <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey there Grail-kun</br>  <br>Fuck off, Gil.</br>  <br>I tend not to have too much faith in the guy. He has this sort of luck where he caused basically every problem in F/SN. Giving his daughter away leading to HF, summoning Gilgamesh leading to humanity almost dying, having Kotomine as his student and causing him to be corrupted, giving Zouken power by honoring that old thing they had between families when he would have basically passed with no harm if he hadn't given him such an ace since it was noted Zouken was plum fuck out of options before that point and he wasn't going to get a magus potential child out of nowhere except in this sort of situation, etc.<br><br>Not to mention in the two worlds we've seen where Tokiomi was still alive when Rin and Sakura were still around later on in life, they're a bit fed up with the guy. At best he's that embarrassing sort of father, and at worst they really tend to avoid him. Even if those are a bit jokeish scenarios.<br><br>Non joke scenarios though its noted if he was alive when Rin reached adulthood she really wouldn't be happy. She would have either abandoned magushood entirely and run away from home, or become a cold witch dead on the inside.<br><br>He's a guy that tended to fuck up things, and had a coldness about him that few fans tended to get, even if he still had fatherly feelings.<br><br> In the eyes of young Rin, her father Tokiomi was a great magus who must be respected and loved, but as for the coldheartedness that accompanied the ideal, that was a negative aspect of his personality that she failed to understand. <br> If Tokiomi had survived until the time when Rin could have really understood her father’s personality, it would certainly have deeply affected the development of her own personality. Whether she would oppose that inhumanity and leave the path of thaumaturgy, or whether she would become a “perfect and coldhearted” witch like her father – no matter which one, this parallel world, for Rin, would certainly be one far away from happiness. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's is no "try to save everyone" <br><br>Batman would pick that choice, he'd find a way.<br><br>A good version of Shirou would also pick that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but there's also a quote by the Butcher that Rin got her kindness from Tokiomi can't quote because I'm on mobile</br>  <br>Its this coldness and inhumanity people tend not to get, thinking he must really not be good. For him the ideals of a magus are above everything.<br><br>Part of him in this logic would say Sakura would be glad to be raped a lot if it meant she had a chance to be a real magus, to have a chance to reach the root and earn glory for all magi ever.<br><br>He thinks with the glory of mages ideal above all else, his humanity or family self is a very distant second.<br><br>For him, the most unhappy thing for his daughter would be to not live as a magus if she had the potential. To have such potential and let it go to waste, she'd be miserable, she'd much more go through some shit and be able to use it instead. If she almost died a thousand times or was tortured in order to become a magus, he thought she might prefer that due to his inhumanity.<br><br>After all being a magus is the ultimate glory, and to try to reach the root is the only thing we should strive for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeuchi: He was a character whose image changed 180 degrees from what I hat thought in the early stages. However, now he has become a character who can't be pictured any other way <br> Urobuchi: Since Rin inherited her kindness from her father, I was given some hesitation about killing off his character, and so I ventured to put him in the position of the bad guy. However, by personal standard, he's a traditional person without a single thing wrong about him. <br><br><br>I think he means she originally inherited it from him, so he made him more of a prick so it'd be easier to have him killed off the way he did - but he was still the perfect example of a traditional magi even then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's sort of right in that after all the shit she's been through, she still likes the practice of magic. If she had been brought up in the mindset of reaching the root, she'd probably be more typical.</br>  <br><br> you can't thin the herd and make life better for everyone  <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;summon a Servant so shit the only halfway realistic way to win is to keep a low profile and engage in hit-n-run tactics while hoping Lady Luck smiles on you <br>He isn't shit though. He isn't the most skilled Knight in the round table for nothing.</br></br>  <br>He's the Rorschach of the Fate Universe, only rabid utilitarian instead of rabid deontologist.</br>  <br> Diarmuid <br> Knight of the Round Table <br><br>I think you may have misread</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, shit I thought you meant the other K man. Why most of the 4th war masters have similar names?</br>  <br> Common sense <br> Tries to achieve an impossible dream </br></br>  <br> There's is no "try to save everyone" <br>This guy tried. He was going to save literally every person to ever live and die in any universe. Even that ginger chucklefuck limits himself to one universe when he talks about everyone. He had a plan and everything. All he needed to do was win the Grailbowl and then let Shakespeare work his magic, and then everything would have been unimaginably fine for fucking everyone. If only some Catholic harlot saint and her aberration boyfriend hadn't gotten involved.</br></br>  <br>She still could have been a magus like that either way.<br><br>Its just that the main kid gets the crest, and they're usually not going to waste much time training the other one, but they will still train the other one in the spare time.<br><br>Like with Aoko and her sister perhaps<br><br>Tokiomi wanted Sakura to be one with a crest, like it would be a waste any other way since she needed to be a magus head. This kind of potential can't be wasted by getting somewhat less training to him, but she's just kind of learning magic for her own reasons rather than due to some grand potential, because she wants to get gud at any sort of hobby she takes on. For her its like learning cooking or archery, its just another sort of skill she's decided to take upon a bit.<br><br>She didn't even end up with a crest in the Matou family, it died with Zouken.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's gotta be a limit unless you are god or some omnipotent being capable of bending the odds to your will. You can only believe in your ideals so much that they blind and drown you. Being overly idealistic can be a weakness too.</br>  <br>The grail is a clump of mana that isn't even capable of performing an actual miracle, and as a source of energy isn't even on the level of a single planet. <br><br>Beyond that, his idea of 'saving everyone' was literally destroying the concept of evil which is akin to stripping mankind of its freewill permanently to impose your own on it.<br><br>He sought to make slaves of us all because he thought he knew best, wouldn't have achieved jack fucking shit even if he'd won, and Jeanne did nothing wrong by stopping him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> capable of bending the odds to your will. <br>Funny thing about that, Marik here always has the odds in his favor. His Revelation skill means he's able to divine the course of action that comes with the highest chance of success in carrying out his agenda. It basically tells him the optimal way to reach his goal, though it doesn't guarantee success.</br></br>  <br>As long as the Grail could get Shakespeare to the Root and let him fiddle around with it, it would have been sufficient.</br>  <br> EotMF <br> EotMT <br> Revelations <br>What a fucking min-maxer</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's actually not much of a people person and quite a bit less idealistic than the outline of his plan would suggest. He wanted to save everyone, and he knew of a realistic way to do it. He thought people were assholes who didn't deserve saving, but he knew of a way to make it impossible for them to be assholes and was going to see it happen. He really doesn't have much faith in others.</br>  <br>He was winning the 3rd war before the Nazis ruined it and stole the Grail.</br>   people actually think the Grail can grant any wish <br>A beautiful lie.</br>  <br> She didn't even end up with a crest in the Matou family <br>On the other hand, she did end up with effectively inexhaustible mana and the ability to bind spirits to her will. Although that did come at a hefty cost. You win some, you lose some.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck are people's issues? Its fucking easy to like both Zero and /Stay Night. <br><br>What the hell is with all the line drawing, even among fans of the same series?<br><br>Jesus Christo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget his True Name Discernment and Almighty Key. Even if he didn't get summoned with Command Seals for every Servant, he's still better off than all of them.</br>  <br>I hope you're proud of yourself, you useless shitter</br>  <br>You are the reason we can't have nice things.</br>  <br><br><br><br> You are the reason we can't have nice things. <br>LITERALY!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> accepting human suffering <br> not dedicating everything to eradicating evil completely <br> even when you, and you alone, have the knowledge and the means to do something about it all <br>You make for a poor seigi no mikata.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kirei <br> Kerry <br> Kariya <br> Kayneth <br>I just call them by nicknames most of the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I disagree<br>I saw I saw Fate/Zero before Fate/Stay Night and I did not like Fate/Stay Night at all<br> inb4 secondary fag </br></br></br>  <br>That may be correct, but it's not right.</br>  <br>Even so Diarmuid isnt shit. Just keep him away from Saber.</br>  <br><br><br>Stay mad.</br></br></br>  <br> I have the right to impose my sense of morality permanently and forcibly upon all mankind while crippling its ability to feel, think, and desire in order to enslave it to my vision of how it should behave <br><br><br>Protecting the innocent and fighting evil are noble goals, but his methods were not justified by the potential results.</br></br></br></br>   Batman   <br>He's pretty low tier by the standards of Zero and Stay Night</br>  <br>Wasn't he basically  Shirou Alter ?<br>I never understood that much avenger's  influence over the people he posesses. </br></br>  <br> Deermud vs Berserkalot <br>He's less skilled and has worse parameters, and his spears are not getting through the armor.<br> Deermud vs Gil <br>Hopeless.<br> Deermud vs Alex <br>Good luck with not being stomped to death.<br> Deermud vs Bluebeard <br>Wow, he's actually got a shot if he can sneak up and get a clean shot at the book.<br> Deermud vs Hassan <br>1v1 he's got the upper hand, and 1v108 he just might still stand a chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>More like an Imposter Shirou. The original is nowhere in the equation, unlike Alter/blackened Servants</br>  <br>None really. The personality he shows is supposed to be 100% false, rather all of it being just a negativity Shirou himself possesses.</br>  <br>If it was truly wrong, he would have known as soon as he'd succeeded and all evil had been purged from his existence, and then he could have fixed it. Can't hurt to at least try his way out first.</br>  <br>He's pretty low tier by the standards of just about every Grailbowl that have been shown. He's not particularly versatile and he doesn't stand out for his strength, so he's way down the food chain.</br>  <br>You're assuming a lot of things go exactly as you'd want them to in order for him to be able to reverse it.</br>  <br>I just realized Gae Buidhe's unhealable wounds could have been really useful against Cthulhu yet he's the only one who didn't participate in that fight. Amazing. It's a been a while. but didn't Gae Dearg land a hit on his Book and nothing really happened? I guess he could still beat Caster by stabbing him.<br><br>He also loses hard to every Stay Night servant as well. Deermud a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the opposite, he's quite weak but versatile. He can apparently shut down NPs with the red spear and fight guerrilla warfare style with the yellow one. Like all heroes, he just has bad matchups.</br>  <br> He also loses hard to every Stay Night servant as well. Deermud a shit. <br><br>He could possibly handle Medea and Archer at close range. I'd still say the odds weren't in his favour unless he gets the element of surprise though, and his sense of honour would probably mean he'd never take that option.<br><br>He'd also near definitely wreck Shirou!Saber considering she's a lot weaker than she is in Zero, soon as she's contracted to Rin/Sakura or gets Avalon she'd be able to handle him easily though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but didn't Gae Dearg land a hit on his Book and nothing really happened? <br>It temporarily cut off Gilles' connection to the tome, or temporarily disabled it. Can't remember which way it was. It was restored just a few moments later, though. He could probably destroy it completely if he got in a better hit or just kept shredding it into smaller pieces with his spear. He sucks, though.</br></br>  <br>I usually mix up Kariya and Kayneth since they're are both equally retarded.</br>  <br>He didn't know Kiritsugu was the cause you dummy.<br><br>Besides, Shirou had a new self after the fire. He doesn't care about his past before it because he technically doesn't have one.</br></br></br>  Official Fate/Stay Night and Zero power rankings, assuming optimal conditions for each servant as given in canon (e.g. Saber with Rin as master, but no Archer Herakles)<br><br>1.

But it's ok, his ideals are in good hands.  <br> He can apparently shut down NPs with the red spear <br>He shuts down mana flow, so he cut Lancelot's connection to the plane. It does nothing against Excalibur, except dispel the enchantment with which Saber conceals her blade.<br> and fight guerrilla warfare style with the yellow one. <br>That's pretty much the only way of fighting he's good for, and even then the spear's no good against armor or anyone who fights at range. And he's not even the best Lancer who can cause unhealable wounds; that would be Cu.<br><br>At best he can pull off a single tactic in one of two very similar ways, neither of which stands out as great and they might not even work half the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Saber gives Excalibur a rough 50/50 chance of overcoming it and says she would be overwhelmed otherwise. People underestimate a giant swarm of Servants by thinking they're on the level of Medea's boner soldiers.</br>  <br>Berserkalot is a bit faster than Cu.<br>Lancelot has A+ agility while under Rin Cu is only an A.</br></br>  <br>Don't you mean<br> The entire town's bitch and Cu's bitch <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Agility has always seemed to be more dexterity than pure speed while still somehow accounting for speed.</br>  <br>when</br>  <br>Agility isn't speed you fucking retard.</br>  <br>How is that better? He's 5th Hassan without the kill move and his main ability jobs due to Conservation of Ninjutsu. Kojiro can actually fight off other Servants. The many Hassans might be really really good at killing Masters if used properly, but this is specifically Servant fights.</br>  <br>Diarmuid has great compatibility against Lancelot, and his spears go through armor. <br>Alex's greatest strength is his army. Diarmuid is an army-killer.<br>Diarmuid again, is an army killer against Hassan.<br>Everyone else is a bit harder to deal with and may require Diarmuid asking for a double-team with other Servants, mainly Saber.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Kojirou has A+ agility yet Cu is still called the fastest heroic spirit during F/SN</br>  <br>Pre-registering ends tomorrow, so they're "end of July" should be correct. Definitely within the week.</br>  <br>To be versatile means to be competent in several different things, or to be capable of several different things.

I need to re-read his myths. <br><br>Haven't since secondary school and its starting to show.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still not sure how this pudgy Nipponese teenager turned into Marik Ishtar.</br>  <br>If Cu could kill 5000 per day and still survive, then they would have been. Saber never once thinks about trying to tank her way through them, and even without BC, would stand a similar chance of making it through with Instinct instead.<br><br>When she uses it on Archer, it's nearly instant. Rin and Shirou take slightly longer. While it is only a brief few seconds, it shows that it gets less effective with range. Certainly everything within 100 feet is fucked, but it's hard to say if it retains that effectiveness for 500 feet or 1000.<br><br>The Moon Cell is built to act like the regular world in a way, so it's going to be set up so Servants can use their abilities properly. It wants a fair fight as possible, so it isn't going to try to impede upon them by making their abilities unusable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean he sometimes kills more than 1 person per day but the general idea is 1 per day</br>  <br> If Cu could kill 5000 per day and still survive, then they would have been. <br>Faulty logic</br></br>    <br> If Cu could kill 5000 per day and still survive, then they would have been <br>Please learn how to argue.</br></br>  <br>That goes with the second part of the statement. If Cu could slaughter them, so could Saber. If they're of the same caliber, Saber would also be able to slaughter them. Saber shows no intention or ability to be able to slaughter them and believes they would overwhelm her, so Cu should similarly not be able to slaughter them.</br>  <br>Please point me to the legends where King Arthur slaughters entire armies</br>  <br>Cu has never been shown to have a type-advantage against armies. That would be silly if Cu could easily slaughter IH while Saber has no idea if she can win. The fact that Cu and Saber are around the same level of strength would mean Saber should be able to replicate a similar feat without much issue. The fact that she can't means Cu shouldn't be able to as well.</br>  <br> Cu has never been shown to have a type-advantage against armies. <br>Read the Ulster Cycle.<br>In F/SN he never went up against armies</br></br></br>  <br>this has got to be one of the most retarded things i've ever read</br>  <br>The universe<br> Prove me wrong </br></br>  <br>Armies are different from monsters. Kill enough monsters, you're good at killing monsters. Though they have differing strengths, the qualities that make a monster are still similar. The same cannot apply to armies whose body can be made up of entirely different qualities depending on the soldiers available. Him adapting to it and being able to kill a bunch of people he wouldn't be able to kill if they weren't considered an army makes little sense.</br>  <br><br>Where is this from?</br></br>  <br>She's a failure of an idoru.</br>  <br>The heavens feel vita opening.</br>  <br> Saves the most autistic possible kid denying fate from having a good MC. </br>  <br>I know she's a bully and a slut for blasphemous dragon dick, bringing shame to all of Christianity and to God, but I still love her.</br>  <br>It was either him or the plain Jane wallflower girl here.</br>  <br> blasphemous dragon dick <br>Siegfried is christian.<br>The Nibelungenlied is early medieval even though it's based on far older texts</br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Bluebeard.</br>  <br>The homunculus Sieg is a soulless aberration born from witchcraft.

And then you had Angry Manjew fucking around to show the worst possible outcome of his wish.</br>  <br><br><br>Gram<br> A sword that appears in the “Völsunga Saga” of Norse mythology. It is wielded by the hero Sigurd. The incident where Sigurd’s father Sigmund pulled Gram from the trunk of a tree later became the model for Caliburn, the sword in the stone. After Sigurd reforged Gram from the shattered pieces, it is said to have become a demonic sword capable even of killing a dragon. <br>Balmung<br> A cursed holy blade which had accomplished the feat of dragon slaying. <br> It also possesses the attributes of its origin, the demonic blade Gram, and will change attributes between holy sword and demonic sword depending on who wields it. The blue jewel of the hilt stores and preserves magic energy (true Ether) from the age of gods, and upon releasing it, emanates a twilight aura. Those with the blood of dragons take additional damage.  <br><br>So we have a sword that's shattered and reforged into a dragon killing sword, and a dragon killing sword that came from Gram.<br>I'm talking about Type-Moon, not mythology.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him, but <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_<wbr>%28mythology%29<br> Gram was forged by Volund; Sigmund received it in the hall of the Völsung after pulling it out of the tree Barnstokkr where Odin placed it. The sword was destroyed in battle when Sigmund struck the spear of an enemy dressed in a black hooded cloak. Before he died, Sigmund instructed his wife to keep the pieces so that it might be reforged for their unborn son (Sigurd). The sword was eventually reforged by Regin for Sigurd's use. <br> In the Nibelungenlied (ca. 13th century), Siegfried says that the name of this sword is Balmung </br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>But that anon was saying that Gram was also named Balmung in the Volsung saga<br><br>Dude Sigurd and Siegfried are different figures in the Nasuverse.<br>It fucking talks about both in the same article as different people</br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't in-universe context, dude.

The reason Rin is able to fight on equal footing is because Sakura can only use so much of the Grails infinite mana at a time, the same capacity as Rin, and Rin can tap into a more finite source of mana, the mana in the air of the room, an infinite amount of times because of the Jewel Sword.</br></br>  <br>So who is &gt; Sigurd according to you?</br>  <br><br>Different guy, but I'd consider Beowulf to be the better known Scandinavian hero, if only because his story became popular in england.</br></br>  <br>Sigfried is german, Sigurd is norse.</br>  <br>But Sigurd was said to be the greatest northern hero.<br> Also his father was the King of Frankland which is also germanic </br></br>  <br> And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged <br><br>Its later established that even though they can't handle the most mundane amount of energy for anything normal, they literally cannot do any other magic and will go retarded if he tries, but they will not break when it comes to casting swords.<br><br>Suddenly they will become a thousand times more efficient than ever before, but only when he realizes the one thing they can actually do.<br><br>When he's trying to use them for strengthening or projection on their own before he starts to realize how this works he can't get the energy across, especially when it comes to strengthening. However at a certain key scene he realizes how his circuits work, and in that moment all twenty seven of them light up at full power and accomplish things that would logically be far beyond them no matter how many he has. He notes there that he realized how his circuits work, and they will not break doing this one thing, compared to anything he's done before they can be used far far better in this one thing.<br><br>Ten units of prana is most likely when he was doing strengthening training with Tohsaka and couldn't understand how his circuits work as the mana couldn't flow with that thing.<br><br>When trying to do mundane things with magic he can never do it, but when it comes to casting swords or worlds of swords, his circuits will suddenly because more productive than anything before, the energy will flow more correctly and his other circuits might get in on this.

The only thing those two have in common is their love for being uninvolved with the outside world and trapping themselves in their very own one but I guess that's exactly why he picked her.</br>  <br>Blossom Sensei in CCC seems to be the best<br><br>Since her meals are the highest level healing items in the game, and can be traded for a gem that's worth a few hundred thousand monies.<br><br>Elizabeth seems to be the worst cook in Fate, since even Gilgamesh acknowledges that her bad cooking basically surpasses what's possible for humanity and even his GoB cannot overcome it in some ways. He has nothing that can make it taste good, the closest he can get is giving you an item that will forever null your sense of taste in order to help you out here.<br><br>Even he's confused by how her cooking can create large ether chunks in such a way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its noted Archer is far better than Shirou in terms of cooking, this is said in Ataraxia.<br><br>Also he shows a bit of this power in CCC. He's able to make some real Italian or something, and Shirou can't do that much.<br><br>Shirou can mainly just do Japanese meals, a bit of Western, and that's mainly it. He's at the level of a housewife, his food power hasn't reached that high just yet. He admits both Sakura and Rin are currently better in F/SN and Ataraxia.<br><br>He's gotta go off and train.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was that Shirou was the best when it came to Japanese, Rin was the best when it came to Chinese, and Sakura was the best at western.</br>  <br>Yes, they each have a style and forte.<br><br>However he admits Tohsaka is probably better in F/SN, and admits Sakura has recently surpassed him a bit as he feels an odd mix as her teacher in Ataraxia.<br><br>He's not out of this battle just yet, but he's gotta start training all over again. They have a mini cooking battle in HF, but due to the situation it kind of ends poorly or is not concluded properly.<br><br>We see them have it out a bit more with cooking in Ataraxia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's probably 90% Shirou being a typically humble Japanese guy.</br>  <br> Tohsaka goes toe to toe with fucking caster. For a prolonged period of time. <br>Why would a Caster know physical combat skills?</br></br>  <br>Just sharing some info about great Fate characters duking it out in mortal combat.</br>  <br> Why would a Caster know physical combat skills? <br><br>That strategy worked because it was Medea in particular, and because she baited her into thinking it was an honorable magus battle before rushing her. If she just tried doing that at the start of the battle she'd probably be dead.<br><br>Depending on the Caster in question, Tohsaka would be super fucked with that same strategy if she tried it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's another Caster who could kick Tohsaka's face in<br><br>He'd beat her in terms of magic as well</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NnD<wbr>HQ50tTsA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Easily one of the strongest attacks in the game.</br></br></br>    <br>Why is Rider kissing Astolfo?</br>  Honestly speaking, I like Kerry for his methods of killing, he doesn't care about anything, he just wants to get the job done. Even if it means cold bloodedly killing magicians without the honor of using magic to do so, he seldom uses magic, because he can see something others cannot see. That weapons are just enough to kill most magicians if used right. <br>Although his death is stupid and weak at the same time, i think he's one of the characters that will keep the series interesting.<br>Now it's just muh magic battles with Fate series. <br>But he's dead, nothing can be done about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Julius was probably a far more effective killer than him in some ways.<br><br>It was his own servant that sort of ruined things for him, when the master kept killing dozens of people behind the scenes.<br><br>Not to mention one of the main guys in Fate/Strange being a far more competent version of Kiritsugu.<br><br>If you think its just magic battles and everything is dead, you're really not reading the different series at all and are just complaining about shit.<br><br>There was another master in Apocrypha who had about the same methods as Kerry but his style is very different.<br><br>There's one in almost every series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Astolfo's sex appeal is just that foolproof.</br>  <br>There's not even really magic battles to begin with.<br><br>I'm not sure if to date there's been one legit magic battle where people were just throwing spells at each other.<br><br>All the mages are the abnormal types in a grail war, or the "I can't do anything, except this thing" type.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The battles are a sideshow. They don't even matter. The other characters are way more interesting.</br>  <br>Rei and Caster could be one, but i guess she got rekt</br>  <br>why</br>  <br> the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br><br>Rin manages to kill Sakura there. That means she'll never forgive herself.<br><br>Sakura actually does manage to make herself believe she killed her sister and goes off the deep end enough to attempt suicide right there.<br><br>How the fuck is this good for his daughters?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Einzberns are completely rational.<br> take their art and strategy to their logical conclusions <br> fail  <br> realize they're out of options instead of going insane and retrying the same shit <br> hire mercenary instead <br> fail <br> final contingency plan is hybridization to shake things up <br> fails <br> give up on grail </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;give up on grail <br><br> Really seek a grail in America when you lose the one in Japan, fuck that up as well. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget these geniuses thought it was a good fucking idea to summon something akin to Satan. Honestly the smartest thing they ever did was summon Hercules and they still fucked it up by giving him the Berserker class because they all got scared he'd kill them super dead Because of how they treated IIya. So rather than have a good servant and maybe treat their representative better they chose the option that cost them to lose. Berseker dies easily in every route. God I hope at least in the UBW's timeframe they got wiped out.</br></br>  <br> It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device <br>Even Gil knew it was bullshit; the Grail doesnt grant wishes.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh is one of the people that confirms the grail can grant wishes, and it can be used to grant wishes.<br><br>It just turns out that this isn't its true or intended purpose, but it can do it.<br><br>Its more like "This much raw mana could basically do anything if given direction", but that can be used to create a wish.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Angya Manyu is quite literally a wish by humanity, even if no one actively asked for it. That's his entire nature.<br><br> Q: I thought that the Lesser Grail collected "All of the World’s Evil (Angra Mainyu)"when it was defeated during the Third Holy Grail War, but then how was the Greater Grail corrupted by "All of the World’s Evil (Angra Mainyu)"? Is it because energy flows from the Lesser Grail to the Greater Grail when the two are linked? <br> A: It’s because Avenger himself is "a Heroic Spirit born into existence according to people’s wishes". Other Heroic Spirits are recognized as true heroes, but Avenger represents the belief that "heroes" are lies and fabrications. The enshrinement of humanity’s selfish desires turned Avenger into a Heroic Spirit, creating a direct connection to the wish-granting function of the Holy Grail. The Greater Grail, "activated 3 times without granting anyone's wishes", turned into its present state as there was still a chance to grant somebody’s wish. <br> As a result, Avenger was born into this world in order to grant everybody’s desire for an existence like "All of the World's Evil (Angra Mainyu)". <br><br>Its not by his nature that he did the things he did, it was by humanity that he was born and wished for.<br><br>That is technically a wish granted</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Provided your wish isn't complicated.</br>  <br>It can be complicated, but you have to understand all the ins and outs of the process yourself<br><br>Just look at Apocrypha</br></br></br>  <br>Hiring Kerry and Summoning Berserker were actually both decently solid plans on paper.<br><br>Kerry was absolutely renowned for being absolutely ruthless and highly effective against proper magi, which is essentially what the HGW was a contest between. Kerry himself wanted the Grail at all costs so they had a mutual interest in obtaining it and on top of that they have an artifact that could someone supposedly one of the strongest servants available - King Arthur. Kerry pretty much did win too, it's just that he didn't expect the Grail to betray everything he lived for right at the very end.<br><br>Berserker on the other hand, despite dying in every route fairly easily really is bullshit overpowered. I guess you can say the same for almost every 5th War servant though, so eh. Still, on paper they had a very well renowned hero as well, absolute loyalty through the berserker class and a master with enough mana to actually take take advantage of the class without burning up instantly. It was a pretty good bet to win the war with the previous wars in mind, but there's simply too much other bullshit going on in the 5th war.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's why we have gilgamesh.</br>  <br>Now what if... we gave Lancelot to Kiritsugu instead of Arturia.</br>  <br>He'll get rekt, berserkers needs alot of mana man. Kerry is a sub par magician.</br>  <br>Summon Lancelot as a Saber then. ANd keep Irysviel as a mana source. Kerry being able to get that nigga whatever weapon he wants would be broke as fuck.</br>  <br>He'll probably just rob a museum and give him some priceless weaponry</br>  <br> Is also Bizarre that Shirou never thinks about it <br><br>Because FSN VN frames Kirei and Gilgamesh when those were Kiritsugu and Saber.</br></br></br>  <br>Kek, and then we come to the conclusion Kirei did nothing wrong</br>  Yeah I have no interest in continuing this series.<br><br>Finished f/z today, and its just all retarded, that grail war did nothing but kill characters after you grew attached, and still the outcome was fucking pointless. there will be another grail war? thats fucking stupid.</br></br>  <br> being attached to characters  <br>Biggest kek</br></br>  <br>eyes watered at the part with waver and alexander. Much better death than alexanders real life death, bastard got sick, wasnt even finished conquering yet.</br>  <br>Honestly, if they needed him dead they should have just given him fucking cancer.<br>Would have worked with all those cigarettes.</br></br>  <br>He basically had grail cancer.</br>  <br>Kerry summoned the wrong Arthur though.</br>  <br>That's like the worst cancer right?</br>  <br><br>If there is anything that you should have learned by the posts in this thread, it's that he is warped as a father.<br><br>After all, even in the comedic alternate future he has, he turns his youngest daughter into a giant robot and basically goes Gendo and tells his oldest to just "get in the robot" and defeat his enemies, regardless of their wishes.<br><br>Not exactly the type of dad who listens to his daughters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not entirely. Sakura tries to save his ego by saying she still has much to learn from him, but he admits she is flat better at Japanese now, was always better at Western, is the only one of them that bakes sweets, and is trying to learn Chinese from Rin.<br><br>Rin herself admits Sakura has the aesthetics of cooking down better than herself because Sakura makes attentive choices that suit the person she prepares food for. She has the skill and the love down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what's really bizarre?  JoJo's Adventure. </br>  <br>This is a dumb argument.<br>Overall in his lifetime he has saved at least tens of thousands of people.<br>Even if his actions led to thousands of deaths he still saved more people than he's killed.<br>He is therefore a good person.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Nah, they don't have the catalyst for that. Besides, some of Lancelot's shit were stories from other knights.</br>  <br> Kerry <br> common sense <br>Good one</br></br></br>  <br>I can think of a few ones who'd be competent in fisticuffs.</br>  <br>Rick is the best.</br>  <br>That guy's just as much an idiot as the dickgirl. Seriously, Manaka had to go as far as committing mass murder in a Satanic ritual before he went to set shit straight.</br>    <br>But nobody understands Manaka until she shows her crazy. She sort of like the opposite of female Saber being so "perfect" that she seems inhuman and makes people resent her, so "perfect" to the point where she seems human when she is really a monster.</br>  <br>Caster and Rider both figured it out. I think Lancer and Archer are wise to it as well. Assassin I'm not sure about.</br>  <br>Because she's showing it to them. Around her family, she acts like the perfect daughter.</br>  <br>They should have studied programming language; it would have spared them a lot of trouble.</br>  <br>I'm not sure Ayaka was approached because of the Einzbern's ambitions.</br>  <br>He's famously not a great judge of character.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but what if?<br>And Kirei summoned Arturia instead. If you rearranged all of the Zero hero summons how would things play out?</br></br></br>  <br>Assassin knows what she's like, but her own personal issues made her idolize Manaka.</br>  <br>She a qt, though. I'd forgive her shit taste in idols.</br>  <br> Manaka <br> shit idol <br>Canonically A-rank both in singing and appearance, and EX-rank charisma.</br></br></br>  <br>Are the raw out for Fate/strange fake vol.2?<br>Also what are the change between the old and new first volume?</br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3925163178<wbr>?lp=5028&amp;mo_device=1&amp;is_jingpost=0&amp;<wbr>pn=0&amp;</wbr></wbr>  So does this pick up/get any better or should I just drop this shit?  no you just need better taste   maybe I can take care of the finances part for you   <br>You just have shit taste OP</br>  Drop it. It's a fucking snorefest.  Look, some people just don't like Hyouka. I think it might be Kyoanus' greatest show but a lot of people find it boring and I understand why.<br>A lot of what kept me through it was that I liked the characters.</br>  <br> I think it might be Kyoanus' greatest show <br> the only thing that kept me through it were the characters <br>You are a faggot for not enjoying the godly visual storytelling.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was a given.</br>  MC is a gary stu faggot. drop it  <br><br>I get annoyed by the dumbshit catchphrases the characters have.<br><br>I-I'M CURIOUS!<br><br>nobody gives a fuck chitanda, just finger your asshole and be on your way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you like Nichijou</br>  <br><br>Never watched that shit.</br></br>   mfw tried so hard to enjoy this anime  <br> love KyoAni <br>   mc is hot as fuck  <br> it was just so fucking boring  <br> tried watching three times </br></br></br></br>  Its literally fall asleep: the anime  <br>A few years ago I watched and dropped it. This month I tried rewatching it, and I fucking loved it.</br>  Most people on /a/ are autists so they can't pick up on the character's personalities and moods being conveyed via body language. Things need to be outright stated or else it's boring.  <br>The only thing that separates him from anyone else in this show is his ability to think and observe. He's not a fucking genius, he's just not retarded. anyone can come to the same conclusions as him if they observe and think long enough, and that's pretty much the whole fucking point of his character. He's the only one who bothers to sit and think for longer than a few seconds.<br>Now go look up what a gray stu is you fucking faggot.<br><br><br>Eh, I liked it. <br>It's cute, and she hradly even says it later on in the show.<br>Same deal with Mirai in KnK. Her catchphrase is established as part of her character, she uses it a lot early on, but sparsely in the later parts of the show.<br>Just get over it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stay mad with your wish fulfillment crap. he's a total gary stu. glad he gets ntr'd</br>  <br> he's a total gary stu. glad he gets ntr'd <br>ITT: things that aren't true</br></br>  <br>Depends how much you dislike it. Should probably drop.<br><br><br>Not really the problem with this show. The problem was more the "mysteries" being lame, and that it's fundamentally a show about a boring person.</br></br></br></br>  It never picks up OP. Never ever. Its so dull. This show is torture, and I can't even begin to fathom what it is that people like about it, 'cause the characters sure as hell aren't interesting and it has no plot whatsoever.  Why do people like Hyouka so much? I didn't care about anything that was happening because it felt like it had no bearing or significance and I didn't like any of the characters: it felt like their personalities just had no chemistry, and like there was nothing to play off of and no believable reason for any of them to hang out with each other. The cringe-inducing dialogue didn't help either. I had to roll my eyes every time they started talking about the nature of high school life in the same "droll" way. The rest of the conversations are dominated by the mysteries, which were very mundane, which is fine, but never satisfying. The abstract visuals are also weirdly grating. They're obvious in their meaning, and it comes off as pretentious, like they're not done out of a specific style or to give the scene a certain interpretation, but rather as over elaborate garnishes placed over something otherwise uninteresting. What am I missing here?  <br>Because it's obvious you tard.</br>  Alright, well I think I'm dropping this since it doesn't do anything for me. Perhaps another time.<br><br>What should I watch next /a/? Darker Than Black? Desert Punk? Something else entirely?</br></br>  Do you find it difficult at all to go back and rewatch regular "Z" after watching Dragon Ball Kai?  <br><br>what's the kai version of OP image?</br></br>  Hah  <br>No, I find Kai impossible to stomach and only did so for my little cousin. Granny goku is a disgrace to my childhood</br>  <br>I hate how instead of redrawing it in 16:9 they just cropped it.</br>  <br> anything but the manga </br>  Beef Suturoganoffu did this  <br>It's more suffering if even Elf9 believes she's doing the right thing. Then we get to watch Carol laugh in her face.</br>  <br>How the hell should I know? I just said Carol seems more like dying material than Elfnine. Maybe Fine sees an opportunity to meet God again using Carol's Chateau du Typhoid and latches onto it and then we get custodians out of a sudden.</br>  <br>One on one deito is always romantic. Stop pretending you know Japanese.</br>  <br>That seems like the moment Hibiki or Miku or whatever it is that Carol's plan hadn't counted on will show up and interrupt her you're-not-even-real monologue.</br>  <br>You don't want to hear the Symphogear dub, featuring our lovable cast Harmony, Skyler, and  Chrissie ?</br>  Let's talk about Serial Experiments Lain  Anyone still have any idea what's the track in the background, title/link? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SuY<wbr>nbIhKGUs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's on none of the official soundtrack CDs.</br></br>  <br>No clue. That's the only Cyberia track that isn't on BOOTLEG.</br>  Does anyone have news on Despera? I've been waiting for that shit for years.  <br>Abe was the writer for NieA_7 too.<br><br>Muh waifu. She's like a Proto-Haruhi Suzumiya.<br><br>I like to recommend NieA_7 : its not the best animated, there's not much story and its not that interesting, but, it explores the idea of the 'extraordinary becoming the ordinary".<br><br>After watching NieA_7, its good to see two shows that explroed its themes better - District 9 (aliens being victims of prejudice) and Haruhi Suzumiya (the extraordinary becoming the ordinary)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Konaka avoided the question in a recent intereview, responding that he "didn't know" when the interviewer mentioned that work for Despera was still going. You probably already know that Nakamura died and that they got a new director to help work on it.</br>  I miss pre-2007 /a/. What happened to us, /a/?  <br> Doesn't know who moot is <br> Newfag </br></br>    <br>see: web-activism and the rise of anonymous<br><br>4chan (and youtube) basically ruined the internet forever</br></br></br>  <br> We grew up </br>  The textboards got updated and killed all the scripts. I believe all the shitposters are really bots that vacbob's competent coding displaced up here.  He did nothing wrong.    For a lot of the episodes, you could pause at any time and have a bitchin' looking desktop wallpaper  minus the horrid CGI bits . Those fucking clothes looked so damn good.  I was really disappointed in this version. I love the book and so does my brother whom I watched it with (he read it multiple times).<br><br>First of all villefort was butched in being some hardliner. In the book he is actually the most decent person, only because the count of monte cristo sees himself as an agent of providence and his view on law is different than that of villefort he gets brought down. Not because he is some butthurt dude who gives the highest sentences. He is there to show the difference between natural law as the count loves it (the count says so in italy when the prisoners get publicly executed by being hit on the head) and his "artificial" law.<br><br>Which bring be to the next point. In the book he sees him finding the treasure as an act of the god/the devil. He states the devil took him to the highest peak (like he did with jesus) and promised him anything if he would pledge himself to him. He wanted to be providence, but that wasnt possible so he wanted to be an agent. He also gave people good and bad things. His old shipmaster was helped while his enemies were brought down. Calais (or w/e his neighbour was called) first was rewarded but due his greed ended up being punished. In the anime he as put down as being possessed by a spirit of vengeance. While you would expect him to get supernatural powers in return for his soul he for most part didnt get any use out of it (only to look menacing, which wasnt the idea of him at all). They could have improved this</br></br></br></br>  You won't see me coming<br>You won't see me coming<br> 'til I strike! </br></br>  <br>To expand on the spirit. The closest thing in the book was the insane guy in the cell next to him. He taught him everything from natural sciences to high class manners and swordfighting. However by deducting who screwed him over he also made edmund vengeful. <br><br>The spirit should have done something similar, give him knowledge of the universe and beyond in return for draining all love from him. Making him livid and unable to care about anyone.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
