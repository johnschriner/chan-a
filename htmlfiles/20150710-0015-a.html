Three sizes maybe?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand it myself</br>  OK first episode was great, picked up.<br><br>Man, you really can't judge an anime by it's introduction.</br></br>  <br>Women can get pregnant in a variety of ways.<br>One common way is through unprotected vaginal intercourse, during which a man ejaculates sperm into the vagina. The sperm can then travel up through the cervix, into the uterus, and, if an egg is present, the sperm may fertilize it.<br>It is also possible — but less likely — for women to become pregnant through any kind of sex play in which semen, or ejaculate, comes in contact with the vulva. The sperm can travel through the moisture on the vulva into the vagina.<br>Another way for a woman to get pregnant is through alternative insemination. During alternative insemination, sperm are inserted into a woman’s vagina or uterus using a syringe or other device. The sperm may come from a woman’s male partner, or from a donor. When a sperm donor is used, the procedure is sometimes called donor insemination. Alternative insemination is an option for single women, women who have women partners, or for couples who are dealing with infertility.<br>A woman who is dealing with infertility may also get pregnant through other fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization. To do this, a woman’s eggs are taken out of her body and combined with sperm. Then, one or more of the fertilized eggs are implanted back into the uterus.</br></br></br></br></br>   Talks about ignorance <br> Uses the word "docking" <br>Japan, JAPAN<br>GOOGLE IT FIRST JAPAN</br></br></br>    <br>They aren't actually using the word docking you sperg, they are simply using a random word as a vague euphemism for sex that the necklaces don't pick up on, and then for the sub someone translated it as 'docking'</br>  <br>So the pres is actually a closet pervert?</br>  So when are those things gonna get removed from their necks.

They hold hands and look longingly into each others eyes. Then the man beats her over the head with a six inch turkey sub and smears vanilla pudding all over her. Nine months later a baby is born.</br></br>  <br> men are natural born rapists <br>Then how could anyone punish me for following my instincts?</br></br>  <br> Face it, men are natural born rapists <br><br>You should probably see what the point of the argument is before throwing in your two cents, retard</br></br></br>  <br>Ok I am really fucking confused and all the plot summerys are super short. I get that they can't talk dirty, but can they have sex? What the fuck is going on!</br>  <br>Out of men that reported rape is the key thing.<br>Men generally dont report rape from females and i recall a recent study showed that men aare theoretically victims of sexual assault more than women. <br>It basically went:<br> Standard questionaires ask if you've been raped/molested and whatnot<br>The testers got the idea to simply ask if they did X y or Z without implying it was rape or molestation. The numbers of males that answered yes has a HUGE spike since society has alot of double standards. <br>Eg if you get drunk and have sex with a woman you'd never sleep with normally you weren't raped if you're a guy while the other way around it totally counts as rape. Or Being taken advantage of by an older woman when you're underage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>America is behind everything, they're slowly killing Japan's population by avoiding reproduction.</br>  <br><br>I doubt the numbers of women molesting or raping men is even close to that of men who raped other men.</br></br>  <br>A man with nipples?</br>  <br>Nice anwser asshole, no really what the fuck is going on</br>  Jesus Christ this show has the worst fanbase of the season  wow, this thread turned out awful.<br>anyway, how feasible is it to wear pantsu like a mask?</br>  <br>Try it with your own underwear</br>  <br> wow, this thread turned out awful. </br>  OK, I downloaded this thanks to OP and this shit is fucking awesome.  <br>can you tell me what the deal is with this anime then, I get that they can't talk dirty, but can they have sex? What the fuck is going on!</br>  What kind of disgusting girl has a pregnancy fetish?  <br> realism <br> mattering at all <br><br>Why would Yuzuki N Dash intentionally draw poorly for the sake of realism? I expected more from such an artist. I mean it's not like his/her doujins are of poor art quality, far from it. Also that picture looks extremely "realistic", if you catch my drift.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All of them, eventually.</br>  <br>Tthink about it this way, there is a thing called linguistic determinism, it basically says that the origin of the meaning of of things is tie to language so for example if someone could control the shit you say then it isn't about censorship alone but also about how it can affect not just language itself but the perception of reality of the affected members, it is actually a pretty interesting concepts that is a completely overkill in this scenario but I actually think it applies pretty well. Though a better use of it could be MGS V</br>    <br>Oh I see, the kids could have sex and become aroused but because words are controlled their urges are controlled. So the MC girl is trying to liberate language so that people can have control over their words, thoughts, and bodies. Like a Ecchi MSG V, thank you</br>    <br>ohhhh hohohoho</br>  <br>No, I just said I am overthinking completely the concept, but is interesting nevertheless. For example there is an interesting moment in aGoT when Danny ask Sir Jorah friendzone about the Dothraki word for thank you, and Sir friendzone says that there isn't one.<br><br>So you are left with the idea that the Dothraki people don't have a way to express gratitude to other people but since it is impossible for the to express gratitude to other people, does that mean that they don't feel the need to express gratitude? If you can't express some shit in words does that means that you are unable to be familiar or understand what does words represent? That is the basic concept in a tl;dr way of linguistic determinism</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Where is this uncensored?<br><br>This show is next level without censors</br></br>  is this show good?  <br>no</br>  <br>No. <br> I'd show her how babies are conceived </br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xat<wbr>1GVnl8-k</wbr>  [ ]  This was an amazing thread.

Yeeeep.

Unfortunately, you free rum raisin has reportedly been stolen.

Doga is so good. But I have high hopes. The OVA was quality. Different, but quality.</br>  <br><br>Me and my fucking typos. Ugh.</br></br>  <br>But no one would steal rum raisin ice cream except for Kyouko.<br>I'm starting to realize that Kyouko probably acquired a taste for run raisin ice cream just so that no body would want to steal her snacks. Whereas on the other hand Ayano had to worry about getting her snacks stolen all the time.</br></br>  <br>That would be very crafty...<br>Kyouko also seems like the type who would enjoy alcohol.</br></br>  So are they really making an announcement? Is it going to happen? Yuru Yuri for Fall 2015?  <br>it happens to the best of us anon.</br>  I feel like my time with Yuru's has changed my life.<br>I'm not sure if it's for the better yet, but I think so.</br>  <br>I trust in the quality.<br>Who is the new production company?</br></br>  <br>its for the better anon!</br>  <br>b-but i have tried to contribute every once in a while</br>  <br> Fall <br>What?</br></br>  <br>it's pretty soon anon</br>  <br>It's TYO, right?<br><br><br>Ok, that's too soon.

Like the colors and everything.</br>  <br>vlc's screencap<br>and yeah i actually do wear glasses. <br><br>i don't know how it got like that. it looks fine to me though. it's not like they're unusable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there people out there who wouldn't download this even on dial up speeds?</br>  <br>well apparently it isn't worth it because the color is off and my eyes are shit. lol</br>  <br> i actually do wear glasses. <br>Same here but I think you should change your settings a bit.</br></br>  <br>i'll go back and take a look at em. but i don't watch on my laptop anymore because i have my pc. plus streaming is more convenient. <br> inb4 streamfag <br>fuck you i don't want to wait 30 minutes to download a 2 minute Teekyuu episode</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I have sanic speed internet and a hard drive I just download everything and keep what I like.

Why would BT translate V.7 when people are still working on V.5 and 6? Whats the point? Ive been asking this question but no one told me an answer yet.  <br>i was using this image</br>  <br>Whatever nerd, as long as i am getting my overlord doses i dont care.</br>  <br>That doesn't make sense in context in the picture. Use a pic of him sitting alone at the table.</br>  <br>It is him and his friends</br>  <br>no clue. But I ain't reading it till 5 and 6 are done.</br>  <br>Yes, now we need an amulet and an unlimited number of LN chapters.<br><br>Maruyama pls.</br></br></br>  <br>EXACTLY, like wtf its like jumping from goblet of fire to deathly hallows. <br><br><br>faggot, enjoy skipping two whole volumes of plot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Generating chapters..... finalizing in 5...4...3...2...1....</br>  <br>Does that make Shalltear Marika?</br>  <br>Don't toy with our emotions anon.</br>  <br>Probably. I'm fine with that, though, because it means Tsugumi is Narberal</br>  <br>Not Aura? Or would Aura be Paula?</br>    <br><br>Generating chapters in 5 minutes.</br></br>  <br>Yeah yeah. Some of us came up with that joke.</br>  <br>fufufufufu SUFFERING AWAITS<br><br>But honestly at this current pace you might as well learn japanese. If you know how to read korean I can provide you up to Vol.8. I also heard eng ver of vol 5 is completely translated and just needs editing. But they're arent gonna release the whole volume, expected releasing at the same pace as now. Which means you can expect V.6 final chapter to be released around next year.</br></br></br>  <br>Because we essentially have two "groups" doing Overlord translations. First, there's Skythewood's group and the Volume 7 translator is doing it independently. I'm not complaining, given that we'll probably finish Volume 7 just as Skythewood's group catches up. Then both groups can focus on 8 and 9.</br>  <br>Don't read much do you?</br>   give that character deletion item to a shitty level 1 alt <br> delete some high level guy <br> butthurt ensues <br>Japs can't into XAXAXAXAXAXAXA</br></br></br>    <br>It's not supposed to be a current picture but one from the past.</br>  is there somthing wrong with my mpchc player? <br><br>Everytime the show pans its fps drops</br></br>  <br>It's a one-time use item.

That outburst in Vol 2 <br><br>I feel for you Momonga</br></br>  This shit coloration is funi's fault right?

For both parties involved.</br>  <br>looks like Solution Epsilon(Shoggoth/Ubbo-Sathla) having a meal.</br>  <br>What happens when you try to shag a shoggoth.</br>  <br>not that big of a deal since vol 7 is almost stand alone.</br>  <br>They are getting  slimely </br>  <br>What game is that?</br>  <br>They're socializing.</br>  <br>Hence it makes sense to split the effort, 5-6 being their own "arc", 7 and 8 being stand alones and 9 seems to be a start on something bit longer, hopefully at least.</br>  <br>New Sexy Beach coming out</br>  <br>Meaning I can jump to vol.7 amd I wont be spoiled or hindered by anything that I dont know in V.5&amp;6?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> skipping volumes </br>  <br> doing this ever <br>Whatever man.</br></br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br><br>I'll probably end up waiting for it even though its gonna take months. I hope the Animu fullfills my dose of overlord every week.</br></br>  <br>Importantest question of the day:<br><br>How does he have sex?</br></br></br>  Saturday can't come soon enough.<br>Volume 5 tl never.<br><br> post skeleton .</br></br></br>  <br>Well that's easy to explain anon. All he has to do i</br>  Does the author ever mention wha type of world class item Albiedo has?  <br>Boners<br><br><br>World Class Tits</br></br></br></br>  <br>He  bones  her.</br>  <br>Nobody knows what the fuck the wand does, or what the spider necklace does either.</br>  <br>No. Hell I don't even know what is her second one beside the wand she carries.</br>    Does this make you all sad too?  <br>Spider necklace confirmed to be world class?</br>  <br>That it does.</br>  <br>this was sad, but the LN version of this is absolutely heart wrenching.</br>  <br>Simple, as he just need to do is insert it.</br>  <br>Nope. All that is known is that is a stick.</br>  <br>Unless she's got one stuck up her cooter. Her dress and the necklace are the only two other things she's wearing. I suppose she could be wearing world-class panties.</br>  So why do I see shitposting and people saying Albedo is not best girl? I can understand if another girl somehow out does her (although I doubt that other girl would for me as Albedo is 100% waifu material) but I've seen some posts implying she is a shit.  <br> Walking through empty halls reminiscing about all the things his guild has built all around him <br><br>This is a true nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>Enlighten us</br>  <br>He has every right to be mad. Conquer the world Ainz, that will teach them.</br>  <br> designed to be a slut <br> probably sucker her Creator's virtual dick <br> probably designed to overthrow all of Ainzs' friends <br> Can't even tell what Ainz is thinking like Pandora's Actor <br>Narberal is better m8</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Has all the right to be mad <br> Guild rule #1 was to be a proper member of society </br></br>  <br> Albedo is the one that killed the other 40 members </br>  <br>Irrational anger is to be expected when things are drawing to a close.</br>  <br>His friends abandoned him anon. Fuck'em, acquire world.</br>  I really, really liked the OP song. It was cheesy, had a hint of devilry to it, and that sequence at the end with Momonga raising the guild flag with everyone beyind him really got to me.<br><br> OST when? </br></br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br> abandoned <br>It's like you completely ignored the guy who showed up at the end. It'd be a dick move to generalize, but assuming the Japanese mentality is the same a hundred years in the future, they will do jobs &gt; hobby erytiem</br></br>  <br>You'd make a terrible Sith you know.</br>  You know that part in the intro that shows Ainz back with all the technicolor shit going past? Can someone make a webm of that? I wouldn't be able to loop it right.  <br>B-but  Revan  is my self-insert!</br>  <br><br>So no real reason then?<br><br>Because the designed to be a slut was one line that was switched to loving waifu and as no 18+ abilities were available in the game she could not have sucked his dick.<br><br>Also yandere best dere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All, they were summoned to protect the little girl<br><br>I cant wait to see their leader sacrifice himself fighting a ogre so she can get away and then  beating him into submission </br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, I'm Revan</br>  <br>Eh, Reven is more a grey side user. If that's the term.</br>  <br><br>Uses the magic time wand in vol.8 <br> After Ainz gets insta assinated over and over until his ring revive runs out, she uses the want to go back one hour. Wand can only be used 12 times though. Everything you read so far is bullshit </br></br></br>  <br>I was only joking  considering how butchered his character was </br>  <br>Those colors, fucking private server scums.</br>  <br>Are they planning on fixing it down the road or is that the quality we're stuck with?</br>  <br> Funi <br> Fixing anything <br><br>The first thing you should think of when you hear Funimation is Satan's asshole</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes gladly,  ___________________________________<wbr>_____________<br>___________________________________<wbr>_____________________________<br>____________________________Read the fucking novel_________________<br>___________________________________<wbr>__________________________</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></wbr> </br></br>  <br>This man speaks wisdom</br>  <br>So no fix then. Great. Interesting description of funi though.</br>  <br>There's always AU.</br>  <br>Oh it will get fixed alright  in the blu-rays </br>  <br>PREACH IT</br>  <br>Thats assuming it makes it to blu-ray, they still have few series they licensed and never brought to disc.</br>  <br>Thanks for the enlightmen anon.</br>  <br>that wand is True Nought, Ginnungagap which is a large area Destroyer</br>  Damn the LN are good, usually I can't get into the LNs but Overlord is a damn interesting series.  <br><br><br><br>What does that even mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The skeleton self-inserts into Albedo.</br></br>  <br>Like... he wears her body like a suit?</br>  <br>Apparently, by volume 9 it goes full crack territory. Some argue it's volume 7. Translations soon  ;_; </br>  <br>Yes, at least for that episode. The blighttown-tier framerate was bad even by Funi standards so the next episodes might be better.</br>  <br>He helps her get in touch with the skeleton inside.</br>  <br>I kind of prefer how Ains stays full spookyskelly to the manga's SD skulls. It somehow improves the comedy moments.</br>     I've come across people complaining about how dark the novels get. <br>Me: What? What did they expect a novel about an amoral Lich to be about?</br>    <br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginnu<wbr>ngagap</wbr> <br>With that and Gungnir+Dainsleif in Symphogear GX, Norse mythology is doing pretty well this season.</br></br>  <br>Did people really expect a novel about a lich to be happiness and sunshine?</br>  <br>Really? I'm looking forward to it.</br>  What happened? the last threads all had great OP pics but this one was shit  <br>But it is happiness and sunshine.  For Nazarick. </br>  <br>Why not, and perhaps some kittens and rainbows as well.</br>  <br>Skeleton kittens and the rainbows are prismatic death rays.</br>  <br>Obviously. Nothing bad ever happens in Nazirack.</br>  <br><br>Does this look like the face of mercy you motherfucker?</br></br>    <br>There is nothing wrong with forniphilia.</br>  <br>Hey that sounds good to me. But seriously, I almost want to use the Nazarith concept for a ttrpg however to many of the people in my group are watching the anime.</br>  <br>I wish I were a kid again,  I used to love bugs .</br>  <br>What volume is that from and what's going on there?</br>  <br> Nazarith </br>  <br>Nothing bad at all. This is a peacefull place. It's inhabitants kind.</br>  <br> Nazirack <br><br><br> Nazarith <br><br>Are you two high?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dammit this should not be arousing. It should be horrifying.</br>  <br>Yeah I realized I mistyped it, I hear it and it sounds like the biblical location Nazareth. Sadly been doing that typo all day.</br>  <br><br>An ally of justice will right his wrongs!!<br><br>  r-right? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Sure thing buddy,</br>  <br>He has 206 boners.</br>  <br>Maybe Albedo can rub his red core or something.</br>  <br>We all know where she can stick that thing.</br>  <br>Bro... Fuckin RO man.. I wonder if any of my old buddies from CocoRO or CookieRO are around on 4chan.<br><br>I tried getting back into it a few weeks back but it's just different now..</br></br></br>  Are there PDFs of any of the volumes out? I've been looking but I can't find any.  <br>Yeah, I'm current reading the third volume.</br>  <br>You should know what this is.<br> I hated these two. </br></br>  <br><br>most humans are shit tier in this setting so prob not.</br></br>    <br>Nazarick is only great if your a resident, or if you're invited. I think   Toile   is the only human of the New World that actually willingly enjoys being in Nazarick.</br>  <br>I'm also played on CookieRO too. It's kinda nostalgic to remember that server name again.</br>  post dark elf fuccbois    <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>    <br>YUUUUUUUUFFFAAAAAAA. MC is dead to me, picking a sader over a knight, what a piece of shit.</br>  <br>  Being named   Toilet <br>What shitty luck.</br></br>  <br> making shield boomerang the coolest looking ability <br>Yeah fuck that</br></br>  <br>MaoYuu manga artist?</br>  <br>Yeah, this one too </br>  whose subbin this  I fucking love pauldrons.  <br>You called?</br>  <br>Use [AU].</br>  <br>I co-lead a guild in Guild Wars II that had like 500 members at our peak. I was without my computer for a month and by the time I got back the guild had basically disbanded save for a few members. This made me feel an unexpected amount of sadness. As pathetic as it sounds, the guild was my main reason for playing for the time that I did, and I had some really good times.</br>  <br> I was without my computer for a month and by the time I got back the guild had basically disbanded save for a few members. <br><br>Did you at least tell them you weren't going to have a computer and left someone else in charge?</br></br></br>  <br>those pansies, GW2 lets you be in multiple guilds at the same time</br>  <br>Yeah I left the other leaders to keep the guild together but they all started playing League of Legends 24/7. I was pretty pissed to say the least.</br>  <br>What would their babies even look like?</br>  <br>Needless to say I've held a pretty sizable grudge against League of Legends these past few months.</br>  <br> last panel <br> "tree fiddy" </br></br>  <br>I think a lot of people can relate to this, hell I understand as well I was in a guild on WoW for eight years and lived through the guild shrinking from 130+ down to six, before guildmaster gave up and disbanded the guild.</br>  <br>Manga looks neat, might pick it up after I read the rest of volume 4.<br><br>How far have they translated?</br></br></br>  <br>ch 7</br>  <br>  spooky  </br>  <br>source?</br>   watch episode 1 <br>So how long does it take for a dark turn and just forgets the initial plot?</br>  <br>About however long it takes for Ainz to start choking and hugging people.</br>    do the guardians know momonga isn't 'from' their world? When he asks sebastian what he thinks of him his answer makes it sounds like he was aware that Yggdrasil was closing   <br>They are aware of their existence and what not</br>  <br>Read the LN and find out.</br>  <br>Yeah. It kinda remind me to my old time as guild master on AuraKingdom. Pic related.<br>I really missed those time when I and my guild members having fun in-game. I wonder if all of them focused on their IRL or move on to the other online games.</br></br>  <br>Don't trust any bastard who has '^o^' in their bulletin.</br>  <br>Its a bad feeling watching your guild die slowly, worse when you're a founding member.</br>  How do you cope knowing that you will never touch Albedo's torpedos?  The skeletons seem fun but it doesn't seem interesting enough to bother hunting down and reading the source material  <br>By stroking my dick to her images.</br>  <br>How subtle.</br>  <br> hunting down <br>The LN is among the first results on google you tard...</br></br>  <br><br> only one person has logged in since whenever the last update was <br><br>It hurts, I mean it's unreasonable to expect a guild to stay active for 7+ years, especially after the leader got hacked twice. But it still hurts.<br><br> Sorry for blogshit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not hunting down the material. I'm hunting down the motivation to read said material.<br><br>and I lack the motivation to hunt down the motivation to read the material in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, but that's a quantifiable level of effort<br><br><br>pls don't pretend to be me you little cunt</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm usually the same, but this is has actually been worth the read.</br>  <br>You shitposting like this is more effort than that</br>  <br>please don't poke holes in my excuses</br>      <br> Brain slouching like a faggot <br>No wonder he got rekt</br></br>    <br>Doom time!</br>  <br>Gazef  ;_; </br>  <br> Who wants a hug? </br>  <br>He got rekt because is a dex build fag</br>    <br>Having seen her original "country" fall, and for having lived for so long I surely hope she won't have a sudden bad end. Right?</br>  <br>Man, I hope Demiurge's clown-bro gets some art some time. You just know that guy's up to hijinks.</br>  <br>Seven.<br><br> Workers, basically Adventurer mercs, invade Nazarick. Things go poorly. One of Shaltear's minibosses gets a hold of the one guy. The King of Terror, a giant bipedal cockroach, summons a swarm of roaches to deal with/devour the intruder. This guy probably got off the luckiest. </br></br></br>  So, is this the first "Stuck in an MMO" show that /a/ may potentially like?  <br>Read the LN you secondary shitter</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Can't speak for /a/ as a whole..</br>  <br>This isn't a MMO, you fucking moron</br>  <br>No. Read the LN you secondary shitter.</br>  Volume 3 is going to spark the most discussion from anime-only people, mark my words.  <br>I take it back. The people who died before him got off luckiest. They were just forced into gladiatorial combat to gauge their strength.<br><br>Hopeless, but quick.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not quite..he has the abilities from the MMO but he isn't 'in' an MMO</br></br>  <br>The LN has nothing to do with the fucking question, you fucking retard.</br>  <br>The hug is going to piss people off the most. Hell even now some people regret Ainz expressing his emotions.</br>  <br>That's a good thing at least but hopefully they can eat spoilers easily since most readers won't bother using spoiler tags anymore for stuff that has happened in 1st-4th volumes.</br>  <br>Heck its already in the OP. Its not exactly abig spoiler already.</br>  <br>Since you got trips, I will explain it very slowly to you.<br><br>The first episode did not explain what occurred. Momonga is not "trapped in an MMO." He is trapped in a new world with his body from the MMO.<br><br>This is is different because, as opposed to the level clearing monotonous nature of SAO, the story is more open-ended. <br><br>You would know this if you read the LN and thus were not a secondary. These threads, which have been appearing for months, predicted people like you arriving since the very beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it's like Log Horizon's situation? Because I thought at the very beginning of the show he said it was a "Dive MMO." Or is that just something later to be spoiled/anime only?</br>  <br>Nah, Log Horizon still has a lot of MMO features.</br>  <br><br>I feel that Overlord integrates MMO elements quite nicely into the fantasy world.</br></br>  <br>So you are just being an autistic fuck, the other anon basically just ask if this series was popular, which has fucking nothing to do with having read the LN or not</br>  <br>Fuck off newfag, he asked the typical "stuck in MMO" bullshit that is automatic cancer in these threads. Stop being a shitty secondary or shut your mouth before you know the basic plot.</br>  <br>He's just mad that you described it as "Stuck in MMO", like many others before you (By the way, it's not).<br><br>Regarding popularity, it's pretty well received.</br></br></br>  <br>That's all I was asking, I haven't been on /a/ in a few days and was just wondering the situation when I saw this thread.</br>  <br> So why do I see shitposting and people saying Albedo is not best girl? <br><br> Enlighten us <br><br>Because those people have read ahead to the most current light novel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ likes skeletons. spooky skeletons as MC is a plus.</br>  So how do you guys go about reading the LNs anyway. Do you read it on your computer? your phone? a tablet?  You LNfags are so easy to piss off. <br><br>You're even dumber than the Monster musume threads, at least they can put up a fight, but you just wholeheartedly keep replying to shitters as if they actually want an answer and not your reaction.</br></br>    But are the LN translations even decent?  <br>pdf's on computer but I prefer my kindle and but having e-ink displays isn't that common. Some people can't read longer periods from computer screen but I never found that to be a problem.</br>  <br>Well it's just glimpse and probably they don't really register its significance yet. Well they'll catch on at least after the hug.</br>  <br>Wondering as well. If possible could someone pass me a link to the PDF's? I'd like to be able to read something while I'm off work for a month due to knee surgery.</br>  <br>They are in orthodox english. Which is more than can be said for most translations.</br>  <br>https://drive.google.com/folderview<wbr>?id=0ByPeaKaqUsGFQVAxUEM2bUI0R0E<br><br>BTW, Volume 4 is completely translated on SkyTheWood's website if you wanna skip past that</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>See <br><br>azw3/epub obviously being the e-reader formats.</br></br></br>  <br> His friends abandoned him anon. <br><br>They never abandoned him. They already said their good byes back when they left the game server in its waning days before server closure. Furthermore, the guild was founded with the prime directive that everyone must be a proper functioning member of society. Neets are not a proper member of society. Unsociable hateful people are not proper members of society. AutismBux and Forever_on_Welfare_Bux are not properly functioning members of society. So, it is expressly clear that the members of Ainz Oool Gown placed real life ahead of a dying Yggdrasil game that had to close down.</br></br></br>  <br>And when they figure out the significance of her armour</br>  <br>The drive doesn't even have full 4th volume uploaded into it so might as well drop linking that until the group manages to re-establish management into it.</br>      <br>It's like Log Horizon, if Log Horizon did not have the game features built in, and rather that having other player you may know, instead you are left with only npcs who you do not know on a personal level, but now have personalities.</br>  <br><br>Best I can find out using the wiki it would be because she is yandere as shit now and wants to kill all the other guild members. This again does not make her a shit.</br></br>  My understanding of overlord when compared to SAO or log horizon is as follows: <br><br>SAO involves being trapped in an MMO literally and they're really just laying in a bed in the real world.<br>Log horizon involves reality becoming the MMO with all the funky physics and abilities that would come with being a MMO.<br>Overlord involves reality becoming a fantasy world that happens to have the magic and look of the MMO (at least inside the guild dungeon, outside world might be completely new to Ainz. <br><br>Not sure if I'm correct or not</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think shes turned yandere to protect Ainz and ensure his authority, Wouldn't want any guildies coming back and causing dissension in the ranks.</br>  Should I read the LN?  <br>the world they are in now doesn't even have magic originally but instead has martial arts or and some inherent born special abilities all the magic you see was introduced by players that arrived in the past making it what the world is now</br>  <br>Yes go now start reading.</br>  <br>With magic or race change. Next time check the archive though, it's been answer plenty of times.<br><br>Or rather I think we need one of those FAQ images to stop people asking the same damn questions every thread.</br></br></br>  <br>So I just finished reading volume 3. Does anything else happen of that scale ever again?</br>  <br>Volume 1 is somewhat sketchy unless you read the one 4chan edited one that Anons sometimes link to. Rest is fine with the exception of Volume 7 which has tons of unnecessary TL Notes right inside the text, along with retarded weeaboo speak.<br> Note. Danna (旦那) means master here. </br></br>  <br><br>yeah sure thing faggot</br></br>  <br>I'd say 6th volume finale and 9th volume will rival if not trump that. Wel maybe not in finale length but in build-up and payoff.</br>   MMORPG shit <br>2 minutes in and already want to drop</br>  <br> Spoilers? </br>  <br>If anyone will join our lord spook and enjoy her undeath as his loyal servant it will be her.</br>   frames <br> per <br> second </br></br>  Definitely wasn't expecting a big spoopy skeleton to have that voice  <br>More like frame per second amirite?</br>  <br>His internal voice is that of his human self, he still has a spoopy skellington voice.</br>  <br>Shit, I wasn't the only one who thought that was strange.</br>  <br>based funimation</br>  <br>I realize that, but it was interesting at first<br><br>I like the premise of this, I might even stop being a anime only fag</br></br></br>  <br><br>Eh, I liked the show.<br><br>Then again I only played Ragnarok through one promotion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>6th  volume iirc is about Demiurge making a deal with the Yandere Princess and kidnapping Kingdom citizens, which he uses for theatrics and Ainz parading against him as Momon to show his superiority as hero the humanity needs (over the all-female Blue Rose team .<br>And  about Nazarick seizing the underground of Kingdom (and partially Empire's) by the balls and all the nobles connected to it, this is where Sebas plays a bigger role with the Kingdom's "male heroes". <br>The whole of 5th volume is a buildup for these scenarios so it's bit slower but pays off nicely I hear.<br><br>And  not much is known about 9th volume apart from Kingdom venturing to "subjugate" Ainz who has declared Nazarick's Independence and himself as something like Sorcerer King .<br>You can fantasize how well that went for the Kingdom.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The raw is perfectly fine, go a couple thread back and download the sub and just put it on the raw.</br>  <br> Ultima Online <br> RO <br> vanilla WoW <br>Watching the first episode of Overlord made me feel something real fierce.</br></br></br></br>   you will never experience getting into MMORPGs because you have no real life friends to start with and are too autistic to find in game friends out of nowhere   <br>This shit gave me such a huge migraine when I initially watched it. How lazy does funimation have to be to put this out?</br>  <br>Someone posted an .ass file with the sub's, just grab the raw and add the subs in.</br>  MC looks like the baddest of bad guys. Is he going to be? I don't think I can bear him being a faggot throughout the whole thing.  <br>I've already watched the episode, I'm just bitching about how shitty Funimation is.</br>  <br>I used to play world of warcraft.<br><br>I never really got too much into it except for the time I decided to play a resto druid on a 1.12.1 classic server back during cataclysm. <br>I kept my sub up, but I really fucking hated what they did to warriors that xpac.<br><br>I ended up as the class leader for a 40 man raid guild and was in the guild for several months, we were pretty active and got along well.<br>I had to take a week off to take care of real life things and told the gm, the co-gm, and all the other class leaders.<br><br>I came back after the week and a new druid that wasn't even in the guild had been promoted to class leader and I had been demoted.<br>I was told by the druids(who didn't seem to like the guy) that the rl didn't remember me telling him and refused to listen to anyone else(dude was a massive pothead, probably got high and forgot).<br>They also told me that the rl had been trying to recruit some marshall warrior or something and that the only way he would join was for his friend to get an officer position.<br>His friend was the druid.<br><br>After that happened I decided to take another week off since I was pretty pissed and they refused to do anything about it.<br>I came back after a week to get back to raiding and the entire guild had collapsed due to infighting caused by the druid and the warrior. <br><br>Never really been able to get back into wow or pretty much any other mmo after that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking more in line with like, is Nazarick ever close to losing a member or something of that sort in later volumes.</br>  <br>Seriously read the LN you'll be glad you did.</br>  <br>I am though. I just finished volume 3 and I'll finish up 4 tomorrow.

I havent really dropped it, but I haven't really read it since albedo[ spoiler] crushed the crazy rapier chick to death.[/spoiler] it was fairly unknown just before I quit, at any rate.<br>It any better?<br>Is there an actual good anime now or something?</br></br>  So, do they every show him out of the game or is it skellington all the time?  <br>It isn't a game anon.</br>  <br>Basically him being a skeleton is his new reality, the game shuts down, and he finds that he exists in a completely new world.</br>  is he living in the  database?   <br>What are you talking about he   can get a BONEr dohohohoh  </br>  Let this be a warning to all VR fans, dive games are dangerous, and you will either have your brain hijacked by some mad scientist programmer, or the game beomes your new reality. You have been warned.  <br> Can't into spoilers. <br> Is remembering events that never even happened. <br> Ask if the anime is good when there's only one episode out. <br>How much of a filthy casualfag can you be?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No the servers were shut down, and magi happens, now he is in a completely new world where his body happens is the same as the avatar he had in the game.</br>     how is it possible ainz is so dense he can't figure out where they're getting the human skin from<br>is this a running gag or does he find out later and do something stupid</br>   Just reading the manga, this is really good, why didn't you niggers ever mention this until the anime came out before?<br><br>It was all bullshit with you fags with MUH FEELS for deaf girl and MUH SHIELD BRO before that. I like this more than those shits. You disappoint me /a/, you're supposed to be the main source for the latest and greatest. Where people go to for deep material that isn't average pandering trash. <br><br>Regardless,<br><br> My face when Overlord shows up and starts REK'ing shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  so whats wrong with japs and not localizing their shits to western audience like am i the only who spend abit of my time asking myself this question. if they really worried about sales and fanbase they could literally hire a guy to google search and see how many people give a shit  <br>There was weekly threads up for every new chapter, retard</br>  <br> deaf girl <br>Who?</br></br>  <br><br>Because they can't charge $20 an episode over here.</br></br>  <br>Its his insistence on being vague and not stating shit clearly that keeps leading to the fucked up situations he finds himself in. I cant blame him though, if I suddenly started life as a skeleton lich, my brain would probably fucked for a bit as well.</br>  <br> overlord <br> not average pandering trash </br></br>  <br>i got into the whole overlord after founding mushoku, at one point i was bored beyond belief and looking up thread, goin to jp and shits, found ln thread and thinking maybe reading would be a great way to waste time right.</br>  <br>Because they don't care about the west, just like the west doesn't care about the east</br>  <br>No indication of that so far, some internal dynamics and discors is explored later on and when WN was still a thing author did a "future sneakpeek" about one of the Guardians almost getting one shot.<br><br>No idea if that will ever even carry over since the WN is canned and it's "relevance" for future is more or less using same characters but no need to use events or same ties.<br><br>Well one of the Pleiades got wounded and pulled out but I dont think you can count that as proper loss.<br><br>But yeah the series is just about starting at 9th volume and none of the "outer" factions have been really thrown in yet. Not eeven the real end scenario is on the horizon as of yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>alright maybe not shits in general, but books, they could just set up a website for western audience and charges money for every release.</br>   No time for sex <br>This isn't realistic at all.</br>  <br> west doesnt care about east vice versa <br>nigger, US and japan are one of the world strongest economic partner</br></br>  <br>The primary fanbase is always the japanese. They dont give a fuck about the west unless the show does well in the east.</br>  <br>Means jack shit. Companies aren't going to go out of their way to try and tailor shit for a completely different culture, when it isn't ensured they will be rolling in money from doing so</br>  <br>it's because protags have to be dense as fuck or else they can't be relatable to the idiots who read this stuff</br>  <br>Yet the that means jackshit as far as localization goes. Bigger amount of shit and soccer moms and cod kids doesnt mean more niche catering or that much more audience. <br><br>Even less when they're obscure and have limited fanbase and no non-jp will ever pay jp bd prices. Like Kodansha said, decade old cult following of Nihei's work has to get lot bigger before they even consider translating his lesser knlwn works or redoing Blame with the new jp version.</br></br></br>  <br>Idiot</br>  <br>Yeah it panders with the skeleton inside me</br>  <br> all organs are protected by the skeleton <br>You are the one inside the skeleton.</br></br>  <br>chinese cartoon still a fucking industry. sure translating a few books wont make the dough rollin in like jew wet dream fantasy. and im pretty sure theres a shitton of hipster otaku outthere who would buy these obscure shits</br>  <br>NO0000OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br>There are already western companies for this shit, but, it's too obscure and niche over here for the japs to give a fuck. Go complain to our companies instead<br><br>Also, westerners are also widely known to be heavy pirates</br></br></br>   That explosion when Ainz and Shalltear collide <br><br>Is the OP directed by Michael Bay or something?</br></br>  <br>Western localization companies are not likely to pick up a show that only appeals to a niche within a niche. Why do you think a large portion of funi's library is filled with harem moe shit? Its because that's what is driving the niche anime market in the west.</br>  <br>They clearly ran out of ideas when they had to reference 4-6 volumes and not just give proper glimpses of the cour like they gave with the Momon/Nabe one.</br>  <br>I would rather kill myself.</br>  <br>I think that they wanted to introduce the other guardians, but there wasn't enough scenes in the first 3 volumes.</br>  <br>Forever cockblocked by his own anatomy</br>  <br>Hopefully it was just that.

I stopped reading the series at that point, seeing vol 5 is nowhere.  <br> Lizards won </br>  <br> Noice, mc group ought to get fucked once in a while, like that shalltear getting mindfucked </br>  Was Kai better than the original DBZ? And when I say better, I mean was it better that they took out the filler and what not?  <br>Bump</br>  It is far better. None of the filler was good for anything other than laughing at its ridiculousness. Also, in the English version at least, the voice acting and script are much better.  <br>I would say it's better. My only question is will Funi bring the Buu saga over state side with a dub. I honestly can't think they would be dumb enough not to do that.</br>  <br>It's good except for Frieza's new faggoty ass English gentleman voice.</br>  <br>Except it fits Frieza perfectly. In the original Jap version and manga Frieza is presented as a businessman who speaks in a polite manner. The Kai dub fits his character perfectly</br>  <br>liked it way better than his original english voice</br>  <br><br>Confirmed for underaged faggots.</br></br>  <br>Linda Young is a bad voice actress. Every time Frieza laughs in the original english dub it is the most grating thing in the whole show. <br>Ryusei Nakao is the only true Frieza, and Kai dub comes the closest to his voice.<br>Take your fucking rose colored glasses off.</br></br></br>  <br>Except they didn't get rid of all the filler.<br><br>Kai was just Toei cashing in on them dbz bucks. It wasn't a tribute to the series, it wasn't even re-animated. And lets not forget about the music fiasco and the time it took to get the buu arc.<br><br>Kai was useless. If anybody wanted to experience dbz without filler they would've read the manga by now. If they had -re-animated it well, then it would have worthwhile because some DBZ eps are full of quality issues.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for latinamericans, with the dub cast changed, was shit, and all the censor thanks to fucking nick toons kai was shit for us fuck you united states</br>  <br> I honestly can't think they would be dumb enough not to do that. <br>You'd be surprised at how stupid funi is. They are probably focusing much more on the movies. I mean they haven't licensed DBS yet or even brought over the specials and OVA's. <br><br>who knows, they suck. Their best attempt at releasing dbz on dvd in the us was the dragonbox sets - which were a limited run and no longer available.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. The filler was never detrimental to DBZ. It was way worse in Dragon Ball.<br><br>Also the original music is classic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Frieza's voice is fine. Kid Gohan's on the other hand, makes me want to rip my ears off like Piccolo did in that one DBZ movie.</br></br>  Soundtrack was shit tier. You can't watch DBZ without Falcouner in the background<br><br>The voice actors were shit tier<br><br>They removed a lot of decent parts. The endearing part of DBZ is all the detail and excessively long fights. Kai is strictly for faggots too impatient to watch the real thing</br></br></br></br>  they made mr popo blue for kai, so its shit  <br> If anybody wanted to experience dbz without filler they would've read the manga by now <br> wanted to experience a tv show by reading a manga <br>This read the manga meme is so forced that you faggots don't even make sense anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>is this bait? Or are you really this stupid that you can't use google?</br>  <br>You... do know that Dragonball didn't start as a tv show right?</br>  Only reason I watched Kai was to hear the English voice actors deliver remixed dialogue. Otherwise, I wouldn't care about it.  <br>That's a shame because the original dub was really inaccurate. People think 17 and 18 weren't originally human because of it.</br>  <br><br>Don't worry. I made my marathons of watching the original in subtitles as well.</br></br>  <br> Except they didn't get rid of all the filler. <br>True, but obviously they got rid of the vast, vast majority of it. <br><br> Kai was useless. If anybody wanted to experience dbz without filler they would've read the manga by now. <br>Kai is better than the original solely on account of the metric ton of filler removed, never minding that it looks better. <br><br>I've read the manga a few times, and when I feel like watching a scene, I pick Kai. There's also a generation of children who hadn't seen DBZ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't watch DBZ without Falcouner in the background <br>Faulconer's music was shitty and didn't fit the intended atmosphere/feeling for the scene 90% of the time. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xeb<wbr>yKpo6A9s</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gUu<wbr>zYvTItNk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>And listen to that inner dialog that shouldn't be there. God damn the Funi dub was so fucking terrible in retrospect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>jesus christ<br>that american dub sounds so fucking forced, I can't believe some people like this shit</br></br>  <br><br><br>I think it was easily the worse thing they did on the dub. <br><br>The scene was handled at a disrespectful level. People defend the Dub, but I don't think anyone of those same people would defend that scenen specifically</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the american dub <br><br>No. No more.</br></br></br>  <br>There are probably exceptions, but I think most people defending the dub haven't given the original (or the manga) a fair shot. <br><br>Maybe I'm being charitable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The real thing doesn't have filler.</br></br>  <br>You're responding to an obvious /v/ retard. Don't bother.</br>  <br>Getting rid of the "stretched out bits" was fine.<br><br>Getting rid of unique, anime original materiial was not (under the pretense that it's world- or character-building).</br></br></br>   they left in that song with the fucking slide whistle <br><br>Good, I actually like that song</br></br>  <br>Not even nostalgia goggles can excuse that shit</br>  <br>Funny enough, my brother that was a huge dub fag, though he didn't care for Spirit Vs. Spirit, he didn't like the dub's alternative</br>  people just say "the filler got removed", but they actually edited the fights themselves making them faster paced instead of staring matches  <br> but they actually edited the fights themselves making them faster paced instead of staring matches <br>Yea. The filler got removed.</br></br>  The pacing is way better. I don't give a shit about filler. DBZ has an absurd amount of padding.<br><br>The TV version up until the end of Namek could look pretty bad at times from what I recall, so definitely stick with BDs. Censorship is unfortunate.<br><br>Music is up to you. Yamamoto was nice for being different, but it wasn't all that spectacular. Sumitomo is the most boring of the 3 IMO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that *is* the fiiller.<br><br>The original anime was literally on the heels of the anime at that point and they had to do everything they could to stall for time as a hiatus wasn't an option for such a popular show.</br></br></br>  <br>posting superior version <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HDO<wbr>h3WPNOck</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>You do know that reading a comic rather than watching a tv show is different,right?<br>Why are you trying so much to force anons to "read the manga"?<br>Do you think that you provide justice upon the original material by doing so?<br>You do know that watching anime and reading manga is just a hobby,right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Do you think that you provide justice upon the original material by doing so? <br><br>Yes. Because most of the stigma with Dragonball comes from it's terrible adaptation. <br><br> You do know that watching anime and reading manga is just a hobby,right? <br><br>That was never the issue, if someone wants to actually experience what makes Dragonball great, they should read the manga. <br><br>This doesn't apply to all anime. In fact, the Jojo anime fixes inconsistencies and added "filler" scenes to fix unanswered questions. <br><br>Dragonball is filled with the opposite. Toei trailed so close to the manga that the anime is so saturated with filler scenes that they couldn't even remove them all in Kai. <br><br>I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make, reading what the series is adapted from isn't a bad thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My biggest complain with Kai is that the soundtrack they used was boring.<br><br>It was awfully generic, it didn't have the same punch that Kukuchi's soundtrack did.</br></br></br>  <br>Hahahaha Cell's voice. What the fuck. <br><br>Espanol retards seriously believe they had a good dub.</br></br></br>  <br>It's such a shame that the manga, the only way to really enjoy Dragon Ball, will never get the recognition it deserves. But to be fair, Kikuchi's sountrack was spot on. The one thing I like from both anime adaptations.</br>  <br>Keeping the reverbiness in Cell's voice when he stopped being a bug monster was a mistake, but the rest of the voices more than make up for it<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XvC<wbr>YAs88e7M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> haven't licensed DBS yet <br>Toei hasn't opened up negotiations yet.<br><br> specials and OVAs <br>"YO Son Goku" is harder to acquire due to its production.<br><br>Apparently PTETSS was going to be dubbed but time ran out and Namco Bandai just went with it subbed.<br><br>Episode of Bardock I have no idea but why would you want that shit special dubbed anyway?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  the original had some good filler but it there was really too much<br><br>kai cuts off most of the filler including the good filler so its kind of boring</br></br>  <br> everything i don't like is a meme </br>  <br>Even Kai wasted huge amounts of time compared to the manga and my favorite fight super gotenks vs buu wasn't nearly as good.

Still, the best version by far is DBZ Abridged.</br>  <br>Here is your reply.</br>  <br>I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that a fan-made satirical/comedic re-dub outshines the original in almost every way.</br>  <br>The English dub is so angsty and filled with unneccesary dialogue.<br><br>That Japanese version though, damn... Perfection.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really. The longer abridge goes on the shittier it gets. I guess that makes it faithful to the source material.</br></br>  <br>Without the inner dialouge there is no context.</br>  <br>The context in the Japanese version is the entirety of Gohan's character since the beginning. When Gohan gets angry he snaps and his power shoots through the roof. And this time it was enough to bring him to a whole new level. The inner monologue makes it seem like he's trying to reach that level on his own and that goes against the entire set up of the fight. Goku had Gohan fight because he knew if he got angry enough he'd reach a new level that he couldn't reach with training alone. If he could he would have had them keep training.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Without Gohan's intermonologe how are you supposed to get what was going on at 8 year old?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>I liked the filler.</br></br>  Prepare for Cow and Horse Doujin.<br><br>Also best ending song this year:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=amX<wbr>iceqtTto</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>When?</br>  That fucking ending has been stuck in my head all day.  <br> Is it NTR?

I will never read this, cause FUCK Ken Akamatsu. He fucked everyone on Negima and doesn't deserve any money from anyone. Ten years I bought Negima and he just fucked me.  <br> how it managed to survive from the depths of flopping hard as a titanium dildo <br>Is it selling badly in Japan?

I read 20 chapters over 6 hours yesterday to catch up and now I'm jonesing for more<br><br>This story's pace is quick, but even as quick as it is it's still too slow</br></br></br>  <br>He ended the series into a break wall over a childish argument from the publisher and tacked on the ending and left out plot points that were known in the 6th volume and finally showed up in the last one only to never be talked about or answered. It was literally a tacked on ending.</br>  <br>you have to know how to forgive and give him another chance. people make mistakes.</br>  <br>It has been three years anon<br><br>I usually get over shitty non-endings in a week or so, you're not doing yourself any favors letting your anger fester</br></br></br>  <br>They were trying to steal his creator's rights from him, weren't they?

Zero?   <br>who know.</br>  <br>The options are<br><br>1) he fucks up somehow and misses it despite Kirie allowing him time to train<br>2) Kitty isn't there, she forgot about her promise after 300 years of hardship<br>3) Kitty is now Evangeline, the dark mage and no longer wants to be Touta's friend- how this would play out I don't know, maybe she attacks him out of spite<br><br>It being a happy meeting seems impossible, that would be too easy for the plot and we need Touta's motivation to find out what happened to Evangeline during those long centuries and make her happy, since it is pretty much his fault she fell in love with Nagi- a man she could never have</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps She isn´t so bad and rumors about her it is exaggerated</br>  I think Eva will do a pactio with him.<br><br>She knows he wants to get stronger</br></br>  <br> 1 <br>He's an idiot so it's possible<br> 2 <br>Not gonna happen.<br> 3 <br>Eh, not sure if I want that route with dark Evangeline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did you let her suffer, Touta?  <br>kirie wants to be the only loli in tota's life</br>  <br> He's an idiot so it's possible <br><br>Personally I think 2 and 3 are more likely, 3 especially<br><br>Touta is a moron, but now that he knows the kind of time difference between the two of them and the odds he's playing with he has a real goal instead of "I want to be strong and beat this strong guy up". Motivation helps, and having number 3 happen (since he only knows Kitty and Yukihime, he has no idea about Evangeline the dark mage) would motivate him further onto a real goal like fixing Evangeline's never-ending loneliness in the universe</br></br></br></br></br>  This is a guess but. (idea, followed by reason, followed by potential holes in reasoning)<br>During that time period she's mentioning? Is pretty much when she meets Nagi. So there is no telling she'll be able to make it either.. Considering that she gets swept up in a lot of insanity and eventually locked into mahora.<br>I think so at least.. She's 500-700years old supposidly. The witch did not find her directly after she was transformed/created. Then we don't know how long she was being forcably trained before meeting tota. (but we know it has to have been a lot because she did not have the "head start" power up Tota does, but is clearly of similiar if not higher strength. Presumably this was around when she made the darkness curse thingy that Tota and Negi use as well. (during the training, finishing , or during that 200-300years span she met tota)<br><br>Of ocurse she did talk about being a 66 year old crone. I'm unsure if she's talking about since her original birth or not. But if she did then the time table doesn't remotely line up (She doesn't meet Nagi till around 500-600years old). But at the same time she got some insane power ups during that time period.<br><br>I do think tota will miss it, regardless of what point in life it is. Because of how she acted when she met Nagi. The ultra lonely, can't stand the lonliness thing.. If she had waited thatl ong for tota. (hell even if she met him,) being alone with only one true friend you only meet every hudnreds of years.. That'll wear on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because mentally neither Kirie or Eva are actually lolis, while Ikkuu is actually a shota<br><br>UQ Holder, where girls are reverse traps, boys are traps, lolis are hags and grown men are little boys</br></br></br>  <br>Fund this please. Supplement with character development x3 please.<br>I want to see the buttblasted of those who have always complained about uq &lt;&lt;&lt; negima.<br>Damn, the tears are gonna be so delicious,</br></br></br>  <br>She said she was 16 when they first met, 18 in the first part of chapter 85 and 26 in the second part, having been taken to the Lifemaker's castle when she was 9 and having become a vampire when she was 10<br><br>She will be 353 at her next meeting with Touta, and quite a bit more of an old, bitter crone than she would have been at 66</br></br></br>  <br>Eva is best girl. I want to marry Eva-chan.</br>  <br>Eva-chan love shota.

I hope they will use resets to allow everyone to read their books, or the first-come-first-served is a bluff.<br><br>Okay, so, here is the translation of the Chinese timeline. It seems to be an unofficial one placing Eva’s age at exactly 700 and working backwards from there.<br><br>1386 (0 years old) – Eva born<br><br>1396 (10 years old) – Eva’s tenth birthday, was transformed into a vampire by magic<br><br>1402 (16 years?) – has been caught by Dana and brought into the Rift castle under house arrest<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta for the first time, Eva lets Touta see her attempt to kill the sleeping Dana<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta a second time, drinks her fill of Touta’s blood<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta the third time, explains the purpose of his internal training [magic duality]<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta the fourth time, shows him a street performance, helps him train<br><br>– (N days) Meets Touta the fifth time, he peers into her past memories as she sleeps, Touta confesses<br><br>1404 (18 years?) – (2 years) Meets Touta the sixth time, Eva puppeteers dolls for Touta to spar with, wants to say farewell but her time is up<br><br>1412 (26 years?) – (8 years) Meets Touta the seventh time, Eva prepares afternoon tea, lets Touta stroke her head in farewell<br><br>[[1452 (66 years old confirmed in manga) — doesn’t manage to see Touta]]<br><br>1492 (106 years old) – Eva takes Karin away from her village [I guess she gets let out occasionally?]<br><br>[[1739 (353 years old) – probably manages to see Touta after his find the box test?]]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you gotta give Akamatsu credit<br>He turned Touta from a shitty protag from a character with a well made background</br></br>  <br> a retard shounen protagonist <br>had no interest in fighting.<br>reads book is interested in many things.<br>Face it the only thing what seems to make him<br>a a retard shounen protagonist was his carefreeness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He's an idiot so it's possible <br>he is not a idiot.just a simple 14 year old from the country.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it was planned<br><br>Even in the earliest chapters Touta strangely couldn't use magic despite being of the Springfield family, then he revealed Magia Erebea and now we know he has Magic Cancel also- essentially it's like the thing where Ichigo from Bleach is "half-human half-quincy half-hollow half-shinigami"- but where all of those were tacked on as Kubo needed, Touta started out with all of these retarded powers clusterfucked into him and it turns out that creating a Frankenstein-Werewolf-Mummy doesn't actually work as well in reality as you though it did in your head. Touta required real training to harness the conflicting elements of his powers, he couldn't just bullshit his way to the top because he has a bunch of broken skills because those skills end up canceling each other out<br><br>Touta only won early fights because of his immortality and underlying blood traits, once he fought an opponent with real skill who was determined to kill him he got his shit kicked in<br><br>Akamatsu is quite clearly taking the "shounen retard protagonist who wins for no good reason" trope and using it to build a more nuanced character who understands that you can't kill Fate or the Lifemaker just by hitting them really hard, even if you believe in yourself and your friends- you need real skill and actual powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In all the early fights Touta would just run in, get his shit pushed in and then win because "I am berserking". That's pretty standard for "retard shounen protagonist".<br><br>It isn't really being carefree when your first instinct is always "I hit it with muh sword", that's just dumb.</br></br></br>  <br> 14 year old <br><br>2 year old.</br></br></br>  <br> Magic cancel <br>Magic cancel şs a passive ability<br>That was not magic cancel, if he had it it would be avaible from start</br></br></br>  <br> "I want to be strong and beat this strong guy up" <br>That´s just fake.<br>Tota is not a moron idiot or something.<br>he has lost his memory 2 years ago and is basically just 4 years old.He just lacks<br>expierince.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who's ready to be healed in two hours?  <br> 21:30 #gakkougurashi → 22:30 </br>  <br>They use the chat all the time and I think yucie still uses it sometimes too.</br>  <br>no, his note is still more accurate than shitty anichart</br>  <br><br> another generic moe SoL shit  <br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you a fucking retard?
