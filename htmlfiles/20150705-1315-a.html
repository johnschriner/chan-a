This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed? The LoGH remake news got a sticky.</br>  <br>It was</br>  <br> stickying an old series getting licensed </br>  <br>Everybody saw LoGH already, who the fuck cares where it's licensed?</br>  <br>Quite the oblivious faggot you are.</br>  LWA made me realize how much anime costs to make.

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple. We need some other rules.  :^) </br>  <br>I'm no doctor but you might have legit autism Anon</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Do you really not see that you just answered your own question?</br>  They sure put up a fun show.  <br>A lot of TTGL's episodes made /a/ go nuts.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're not getting it. Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre.

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it.

When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy.

You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

There's nothing wrong with liking mlp. I watched it along with every other show back way when with my sister.</br>  hihi  <br>And my stream had constant buffering, so I just ended up downloading the fucking thing despite paying for it.</br>  <br>what do you think little witch butt smells like?</br>  <br>Cute girls + cute things + magic = "INDUSTRY SAVED" AMOUNTS OF MONEY</br>  <br>LWA2 kickstarter started late in the evening USA time and was completely funded in under 3 hours.<br><br>Tumblr/leddit/jewtube didn't even fucking know it existed until after it was already fully funded (in no small part by /a/).<br><br>So fuck your shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't have to be the case though the show does air in japan, animators love other animation and they will throw nods into shows they like in their own work</br>  <br>Or moe</br>  Sucy is for _____  <br> funded in under five hours <br> crammed <br>I think we donated pretty fucking willingly there.</br></br></br>  <br>futa</br>  <br>Are you saying that stickying money begging threads is not cramming something down one's throat?

They would have that unmistakable sweaty, musky butt smell; but each rear would have its own unique characteristic that makes them all worth sniffing.</br>  <br>That's because they already have Precure (for the bigfriends) and Kamen Rider (for lonely housewives).

At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it. <br><br>Well, aside from the endorsements (from Hideo Kojima etc), it started out with some well-known people as well, as Studio Kinema Citrus is mostly ex Production IG staff. <br><br>Wikipedia is telling me that Kinema Citrus also did Yuyushiki and Black Bullet, so I'm starting to understand the whole "artistic differences" spat with Creative Intelligence Arts, which was big on the whole "anti-moe" thing. <br><br>Anyway:<br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/2<wbr>2/under-the-dog-getting-an-anime-ki<wbr>ckstarter-back-on-track/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm enjoying it.</br>  <br>Tell me some more how much you don't care.</br>  <br> i can't find myself </br>  <br>I feel kinda sad that the artist had to draw in the shadows for Sucy.

There are some shots where the animation doesn't always seem quite finished, but I wouldn't want to be presumptuous enough to assume I can tell whether or not they are intentionally that way...</br></br>  I really loved it, even more than the first one. This should be a series, too bad it's impossible.  <br>Why aren't all those kids dead?</br>  <br>It's not shooting by itself now is it?</br>  <br>They weren't really trying to hurt them and their power was nerfed anyway because they weren't near the Sorcerer's Stone.</br>  <br>Semi-auto = 1 trigger pull, 1 shot.

Semi-auto is a weird workaround to divide automatics into burst-fire and not.</br>  <br> gets put up deserves nothing but contempt until it can prove itself otherwise. <br>Which Trigger did with the first LWA. Without it, I wouldn't had backed them two years ago. Imagine trying to justify backing LWA if Trigger only work up to that point was Inferno Cop.</br></br>  Was it worth the weight?  <br>I see, that makes sense.</br>  Thank you all backers in this thread.<br><br>I wasnt able to this time due to funds but enjoyed it thanks to your efforts! <br>i'll make sure to contribute for the next one if it gets a kickstarter again.</br></br></br>   Akko - Harry Potter <br> Lotte - Ron <br> Sucy - Hermoine <br> Amanda - Cho <br> Constanze -  <br> Jasminka -  <br> Diana - Draco  <br> Hanna and Barbara - The Draco fat twins <br><br>everything is better as little girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>semi auto reloads semi automatically<br>you pull the trigger and it shoots, you pull again and it has reloaded and shoots one bullet again<br><br>full auto means the reloading cycle will work and therefor the gun will shoot until you let the trigger go or it runs out of ammo<br><br>no auto means you have to manually reload after every shot, bolt action etc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  That was really fucking good, based Trigger.

It isn't like we're digging through a decade or two of previous works.<br><br>I also got to argue that making a game is harder*. The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

So, let's get this straight. She did absolutely nothing, right?  <br>not <br> you're gonna swallow that load </br></br>  <br>She was adorable. That's good enough for me.  But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  <br>A common mexican name.</br>  If I'm a backer, where can I watch this without torrenting?<br><br>Haven't gotten any emails nor am I seeing anything on the Kickstarter site.</br></br>  <br>ok premise if they had a tv show</br>  Holy shit Akko almost made this unbearable to watch.

However, if you asked me whose tongue I want to suck, I would definitely pick Sucy.</br></br>  <br>All. Butt sniffing is my biggest fetish, so I wouldn't pass up the chance to sniff all the witch butts.<br><br>Also, that's nicely done.</br></br></br>  <br>Delicious Akko panties. <br>Hopefully she forgot to shower or take her panties off for at least a month.</br></br>  <br><br>If you want to see some of the last remnants of good Western animation, I recommend the stuff by GOBELINS. <br><br>Here is one of my favoritues: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WIm<wbr>OE0Pwk3M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure?</br>  <br> implying she wears panties at all </br>  Is there any reason for the 01 at the end of the title?<br><br>Isn't it going to be just this?<br><br> Is episode 2 the inferno cop one? </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A month? Isn't that a little too much?</br></br>  <br>That makes it way more fun to sniff, and lick, and bury my face in.</br>  <br>Just watched the first episode of LWA 1 I am hooked!!</br>   Hey kid, wanna /ll/?   <br><br>Is there a second episode of LWA 1?</br></br>  I can't believe the little brats still threw tomatoes at Akko and her friends after they saved their lives.  I want to bury my face in Sucy's butt though her dress. Then after I get my fill of sniffing her clothed butt, I wanna slip her dress up and bury my face in her bottom directly.  <br>No.<br>I will clean her orally.</br></br>  <br>That ass too fat.<br> I like it. </br></br>  I WANT TO SNIFF AND LICK ALL OF THEIR BUTTHOLES<br><br>I WANT TO WORSHIP ALL OF THE CUTE WITCH BUTTS</br></br>  That was great! The animation shone, great job trigger!  <br>i dun know, I am searching for it now.</br>  <br>Fuck you Trigger. <br><br>I just want a glimpse of Akko's panties, but no, we get "the void".</br></br></br>  <br>Akko goes nopan so she can let her stuff air out.</br>  <br>You simply don't understand.</br>  <br>Very late reply, but Kiki was very sexual.</br>  <br>and the plot was good too! SHINY!!! ARCA!!!</br>  <br>That has to be an edit.<br>Don't tease my penis like that.</br></br>  <br>she was adorable</br>  <br>That image was Trigger backpedaling. When you watch the first episode it becomes clear that the dresses are not designed that way.</br>  <br>It's not. You can actually see her bare butt in the episode if you happen to pause it at just the right moment.</br>  <br>Exactly when?</br>  <br>Sensory overload. <br>The wand represents my penis.</br></br>  I just naturally assumed that their school uniforms have some sort of censorship enchantment on them to prevent upskirts and panty shots  <br>A Little Witch Academia without "The Void" it's simply not Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>33:55<br><br>It's near the start of the parade, when Akko is dancing with the brooms.</br></br></br>  <br>That image is fanart.</br>      <br>Literally everyone leaves to go jerk off to Akko's ass. <br><br>Wasn't it from the trigger art book?</br></br></br>  Will Akko ever find out Ursula-sensei is her beloved Shiny Chariot?  Will they have sex?   <br>Akko is a lewd girl that likes to flaunt her booty around.</br>  <br>I bet the third movie will be about Shiny Chariot's backstory and Akko and Diana will finally see eye-to-eye in something.</br>  does anyone have a pic of the scene where Amanda does the broom dance and you can can briefly see her ass? Also, I hope this is popular enough to get made into a series    Was there color turn arounds for all the characters?<br>I need references badly.</br>  Is it me or is Diana kinda obsessed with Akko?  <br>if you look carefully, it becomes obvious that she is wearing panties</br>  <br>its you</br>  <br>Excuse the quality face.</br>  It begins.  <br>that's the real loli</br>  ??  <br>what chapter is the top part</br>  Her twin?<br>Umaru amnesia?</br>  <br>Wait, no. No way. Is the author going to pull a shitty switched siblings plot?</br>  <br>Im getting separated at birth vibe.</br>  Please don't ruin the comfy with a shitty plot twist.  <br>it's not really a plot twist. There were signs since the beginning</br>  <br>You can't ruin what's been ruined by shitty imouto to begin with.</br>  <br>the chapter before the bottom</br>  <br><br>It'll turn out that he and Umaru are therefore not blood-related and we'll get a Usagi Drop ending.</br></br>  <br><br>you are lying.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't understand the significance of this.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck, time to read from beginning then. Which chapter is this?</br>  <br><br>I was just joking guys. The new imouto looks way too young to be her</br></br>  <br>Not really, that actually possible </br>    <br>not that there was another imouto but something dark was going on behind the scenes</br>  <br>troll?</br>  <br>I really don't know how to feel about this. This will either be really, really shitty or it will make it into a classic.</br>  <br>wow so does that mean we're going to get more of boss lady</br>  inb4 forgotten past.  <br>taihei is best girl. All the other girls are shit compared to him<br> likes to clean <br> likes to cook <br> always worrying about you <br> spoils you silly <br>I just want taihei to be my onii san and play video games with him everyday</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>some "serious" plot in a comedy manga just means that it is going to end soon.</br></br>  <br>Hayate said hello.</br>  <br>With the anime starting now? This is not ending soon.</br>    <br>nigga plox i just started reading this and i didn't signup for drama, i would read shoujo if i want some drama.</br>  WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY COMFY UMARU  what is this creature  <br><br>calm down faggots, there hasn't been any drama yet. We don't even know if this is bad. It could be just a new character</br></br>  <br>She probably is</br>  <br> white hair loli <br>that''s nice</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing<br> Taihei and Umaru ran away from home/ were kicked out <br> Note it's possible both aren't actually blood related. He could've just visited her a lot. Which would explain why Taihei's interactions with grown-up Umaru don't realyl feel mother/son like <br> Parent's had a new child. She was left behind <br> Now stays with Bosslady and sent Alex to check out her "sister" <br>Of course, Umaru being the perfect girl she is will probably befriend her easily.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   mfw they flip the script on everyone and our favorite himouto is actually a alien sent to captivate onii chans all around the world <br>plot twist of the century <br>AOTY</br></br>  <br>oii-chan is best onii-chan, there is no better onii-chan than onii-chan</br>  <br>Go to bed, Umaru.</br>  <br>could be step siblings, explaining why taihei has those flashbacks of mothers like shes dead.</br>  <br>funny that you used a picture of one of the gag mangas that has the most drama besides gintama</br>  I haven't the most recent two chapters but does anyone else feel it's been getting a little boring lately? The group of 4 girls just isn't as fun as bratty imouto/oniichan antics.  <br>Possible. Hopefully it won't go Usagi Dorp on us because it's obvious that Umaru doesn't see Onii-chan as a romantic interest and more obviously vice versa</br>  <br>definitely needs more oniichan</br>   Going from a total clumsy wuss to holy shit I can't even describe her <br><br>Why is she so perfect?<br>Just how hard is she going to befriend Carol?</br></br></br>   befriend <br><br>It's called befisting.</br></br>  destroying mt Everest.  <br>She will friend the shit out of her.</br>  Posting GOAT logo.

This will be my first time watching Sympho along with /a/, should be a wild ride.<br><br>And for the love of god let GX get some figures and statues, not just the 20th recolour of bunny Chris.</br></br>  This episode was so great.  Is this likely to be the last season?  <br>Hitch your hopes and dreams to Nana</br>  <br>Depends on sales and how the merch sells.</br>  <br>Well yeah, we can't really go anywhere after that besides introducing more threats. The original three can't really go much further in terms of characterisation, and it's been said this season will have FIS development. After that there's not much left.</br>  <br>1st season was supposed to be a standalone.<br>2nd season was supposed to be last season.<br><br>Iirc the writer got kinda angry when they told him to write this season.</br></br></br></br>  All we saw of her in the first episode was her running and pantsu flashes.  <br>Kaneko loves this shit</br>  <br> Iirc the writer got kinda angry when they told him to write this season. <br><br>Source? If anything the animators were mad at him because he got way to into it and the shit he wrote was too hard to animate. This is the writers baby.</br></br></br>    The new song is great and really fits hibiki  <br>She, uh, really enjoys punching things, huh?</br>  <br>I'm glad the fanservice in this serie is sneak frames and poses instead of going BOING BOING BOING LOOK LOOK *sound effects* like in most anime.</br>  <br>all the fanservice is there <br><br>but the determination to fist is so strong you ignore it and get hyped up that hibiki is being a badass</br></br></br>  <br>You're kidding right</br>  <br>Zenbu is another case.</br>  <br>Moe blob and pure sex goddess.</br>  BIKI STRONK  I want to marry Kirika!  I want to marry Shirabe. Also as much as I love this episode, I couldn't stand the new enemies, and it's not Symphogear without the swarm of Noises.  <br>I absolutely love the flamenco dancing enemy.</br>  <br> what are the custodians </br>  <br>Dat Kirika side boob.</br>  <br>I like Kirika more, she's cuter and has small breasts instead of being completely flat</br>  Watched the first episode of Symphogear GX and really liked it, even though it's my first time watching the series. Is the rest of the series as musically involved as this episode was?  <br>Flamenco?!</br>  Miku will be turned into a puppet screencap this post.  <br> First time watching the series <br>Are you the kind of retard that skips to S3 instead of watching from the start?</br></br>  <br>More like this kinda flamenco. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xqx<wbr>JMCQxb_Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Absolutely.

In general, though, the series is made to sell music so there's lots of it anyway.</br>  <br>It's fine, now he can go back and marathon the rest in time for episode 2 of GX.</br>  <br> Skipping to S3 is fine <br>I cant take it, /a/ is too retarded for me these days</br></br>  <br> this bait again </br>  <br>I want to see cool tricks from the coin doll next episode. She's probably fighting Chris.</br>  <br>Is chris going to shoot down all the coins?</br>  Senpai has extreme surfing skills.  <br>I imagine there'll be plenty of shooting down happening on both sides.

That said, the last three episodes are still probably the most hype you can get in Symphogear. It was like a non-stop roller-coaster.<br><br>Season 2's high points are episodes 1 and 10, the first episode was perfect, which is probably why they are more or less repeating the pacing with GX's episode one. Episode 10 is a full load of Hibiki getting hot blooded (literally) and Mikugear rampaging with a side order of Chris kicking her ass.<br><br>You can't love Symphogear without loving QUALITY.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku, Hibiki and Maria  <br>Quite an odd combination.</br></br>  <br>So do people actually watch the fight scenes with the subtitles turned on?

Since the Noise aren't a thing anymore why doesn't Genjuro take a bigger role in the field? The only reason he didn't take an active role in fights before was because he wasn't immune to the Noise, but besides that he's pretty much the strongest guy there.  Is Maria so useless because she never had a training montage? Will she get one this season?  <br>Like  Tsubasas   sword </br>  How did you get yourself to stop rewatching the first episode?  <br> &gt;moonlights behind you <br><br>Man there's something wrong with me. I always laugh at this dumb shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Fish.<br><br>But good fish. Ones that smell good. Whichever ones those would be.</br></br></br>  <br>spaghetti</br>  <br>His quote on the official site is him expressing the exact same sentiment. He's probably going to job to the dolls at some point.</br>  <br>spaghetti</br>  <br>Genjuro's quote on the GX website is<br> Since the opponents are not the Noise, it should be my turn to fight them! <br>Make of that what you will.</br></br></br>  <br>Masturbate, oh wait</br>  <br> implying <br>I think I'll be rewatching this shit till the day I die.</br></br>  <br>The lives of thousands of soldiers and civilians.</br>  <br>He's head of operations.</br>  <br>For now he didn't act because he can't fly or crap jet fire.<br><br>Maybe we will get some fight with him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Noise occur sort of naturally, I think. Just the Staff of Solomon was a tool to summon and control them. Either way, Genjuro is better off commanding his extremely powerful Symphogears.</br></br>    <br>he might be strong but he can't fly. and he's still (sorta) limited by the laws of physics.</br>  <br><br>I'm fine with him fighting and losing for whatever reason (like how he jobbed in the first season), but I'd be pissed at this season if he didn't at least try taking an active role in battles.<br><br>So this season is still looking good to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunpowder</br>  <br>I hope him and Ogawa take on one of the dolls.</br>  <br>The Noise appeared "naturally" because they sometimes leaked out of Solomon's treasury by themselves.<br>You know, the one they nuked last season.</br></br>  <br>Napalm.<br><br>Like Kirika.</br></br></br>  <br>well whether or not the noise are dead is unknown, plus they were man made creations in the first place.<br>but who knows how large the treasury really was, and if the explosion would kill them even if they phased out of reality or whatever it was they did.<br>there's also a chance there's some rogue noise who slipped out before hand and are just running around.<br><br><br>basically there's plenty they could do if they wanted to add noise back in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nuked <br>They just put Solomon's cane back in.<br>There's no reason to think the noise won't leak out like they did before.</br></br></br>  <br>They were nuked by Nephilim blowing itself up inside the treasury</br>  <br> They just put Solomon's cane back in. <br>And left the violently exploding Nephilim in there.</br></br>  <br> forgetting about the giant monster that was about to go nuclear and blew up so hard you could see it in a different dimension. </br>  <br>  implying she wasn't thinking about   Kanade  the whole time</br>  <br><br><br>They said themselves that there's too many noise in there to ever get rid of.</br></br></br>  <br>to be fair that was before they had an exploding relic monster.</br>  <br>Not them, but noise from now on will only attack very very rarely as described in s1.<br>Unless someone of them picks up the cane and starts using it.</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa`s graduation day <br> everyone cries because she's literally the reason why everyone enrolled in that school <br> Tsubasa thinks "i wish kanade was here" instead of feeling bad because she's leaving her juniors behind </br></br></br>  Will we have Grape kun this season?  <br>Grape-kun will live on forever in our hearts</br>  <br> Tsubasa hears Kanade's voice in her head, congratulating her for growing up so strong. <br> Tsubasa starts to cry onstage. Everyone thinks its because she is sad to leave. <br> it's actually because Kanade will never see Tsubasa realize her dreams as an adult. </br></br></br>  <br>Even if he won't everyone will still remember him. Even Nana remembers Grape-kun.<br>Also, what is this, Yukine for ants?</br></br>  <br> Unless someone of them picks up the cane and starts using it. <br>Grape-kun is back motherfuckers.</br></br>  <br> jackie chan <br> not drunken master <br>You had one job.</br></br></br>  I want to see the dolls frenching Genjuro.  <br>If I was any better with Gimp, I'd have it so Hanabusa's gun was firing at Anime-chan.</br>  <br>Even if Tsubasa obtains a harem of 77 unique best girls Kanade will never disappear from her heart as her waifu.</br>    <br>I hope they don't, I don't want the manliest man in the world die.</br>  <br><br>He would be too manly to die to it, he'd punch her in the gut while she's half way through and come out of it gasping for life or some shit.</br></br>  <br> he's too much for them <br> they explode </br></br>  <br> Symphogear movie <br>Can you imagine the size of the hype? I think some peoples' heads would literally explode.</br></br>  <br>He'll progress from Akuma to Gen</br>  <br> Tsubasa is Nana <br> Kanade is her dad </br></br>  <br>I bet it would be like Nanoha all over again.</br>   punched a mountain   <br>I don't think Kanade punishes Tsubasa for being weak.</br>  <br> nipples in the transformations </br>  <br>It would be SRW/Gunbuster tier on scale.</br>  <br><br>Thinking about it, I'm surprised they aren't already working on one. Maybe it's because the whole series is about selling singles, if they did a movie it would need new or reworked songs.<br><br>Imagine S1 remade like Nanoha's 1st Movie?</br></br></br></br>  Notice how everyone is wearing the color of their symphogears? Do you think we'll see more Shenshoujing and Nehushtan?  <br>I'd rather they just make something new.</br>  <br> S1  <br> WITH BUDGET </br></br>  <br>What are those things on her chest</br>  <br> surfing on rockets <br> punching through mountains </br></br>  <br>If they changed the designs I'd be mad.</br>  <br> See every trilogy ever. <br>Like the Indiana Jones trilogy.<br>And the Star Wars trilogy.<br>And the Hitchhikers Guide trilogy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They'd change a lot more than that for a Nanoha style remake movie.</br>  <br><br>fake padding<br><br>also i wonder if Ranpha will show up this season, since we already have Sheryl and the Frontier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>B:81</br>  <br>Tsubasa is not Chihaya-level flat.</br>  <br>Phonic gain.</br>  why is blue always flat?  <br>Aside from some outfit tweaks, the change in character design between the original and movie remakes wasn't very big.</br>  <br> that pic <br>I laughed harder than I should have.</br></br>  <br>fooneek gayn is scary.</br>    <br><br>spooky</br></br>  After one episode.

I actually made a thread on /a/ asking her name, but it got deleted. Last I heard, she was going to be in the show.</br>  <br>No clue, since I can't read moon.<br>But if that is her, I have the first four LNs here and she doesn't appear on a single illustration. So I doubt we'll see her in the anime.<br><br>I believe her first appearance is, just like the cover says, in volume 8. Didn't see her on the other samples at all.</br></br></br></br>  I'll just go ahead and post everything I have.    what the fuck is this about?    <br>If no fun SJWs ran the world and 4chan fought back.</br>    <br>Who do you think runs 4chan?</br>  <br>Picked<br><br><br><br><br><br>UP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>juice</br>    OPs picture is erotic.          <br>yes please</br>                                    Neetball, right?

I feel bad for the EOPs, pun based shows like this are difficult to translate at the best of times, having Funi shit is like shooting yourselves in the kneecaps first.</br>  <br>They announced that they're doing it.<br>Now we have to be patient.</br></br>  <br>What's it supposed to be?</br>  <br>Use polite speech while talking to your senior.</br>  Guess I'll wait then.  <br>MC talked in an overly familiar manner, gorilla man chastised him for not using polite speech with someone older than him.<br><br>Funi inserted "hell" for no reason as a "swear" word, and the whole fucking point of the show is that swear words are banned. It's like the stupidest choice ever.</br></br></br>  <br>If he was swearing he would be in jail, you retard.</br>  <br>Is this considered forbidden as well? What was the original?</br>  <br><br>Best. ****ing. Girl.</br></br>  <br>Are you deaf?</br>  <br>Anal was fine there. It was a pun revolving around shiri, the nip word for ass.</br>  <br>It wasn't really okay as it is not something he would say.</br>   the entire school coming <br>My fucking sides</br>  <br> like shooting yourselves in the kneecaps first. <br>Anything but raws is. EOPs are wasting their time.</br></br>  <br>Even though Funi made him say "ass" here.</br>  Best dad.  <br>You can use "anal" without it being a lewd word, dude. Shiri &gt; anal is fine if you're trying to preserve the meaning of the pun.<br><br><br>Yeah, they fuck it all up 2 seconds later, but what are you gonna do? Wait for fansubs? In this day and age? Enjoy waiting 2 weeks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not using raws is like shooting yourself in the head. Using funi is like kneecapping yourself beforehand, so you suffer even more in your final moments.</br>  <br>This "can" is enough for it to be a banned word. It is suppose to catch on words anyway, not context.</br>  <br> but what are you gonna do? Wait for fansubs? In this day and age? Enjoy waiting 2 weeks. <br>For this I actually will. Funi are ruining the whole viewing experience. I'll just avoid the threads so I don't get spoiled.</br></br>  What does it mean  <br>  No. She's not in the line up of characters. In fact from what I hear, she's introduced MUCH later. <br>Well fuck. That was the reason I was thinking of watching it.</br></br>  <br>That wouldn't make any sense, as there are tons of sentence fragments that can potentially sound lewd.<br><br>It's got to be running off brainwaves, are people going to go to jail every time they say ÈÄÄ„Åè?</br></br></br>  <br>my cake?</br>  What does she mean by "docking"?  <br>Her dirty jokes are so bad, or basically she already spouting very lewd words here, not even jokes anymore.</br>  <br>What part of the fucking anime did you not get?</br>  <br>I'm assuming you don't even have Rikaichan installed or something, ÈÄÄ„Åè doesn't mean butt or anything lewd, it means "to retreat". The system has only activated thus far when someone intentionally said a lewd word. "Peacock" would be fine, "cock" wouldn't. Unless you were talking about a rooster, I guess.<br><br>Or maybe it is just anything that sounds naughty, which would be hilarious, because it'd cripple Japan's vocabulary pool even further.</br></br></br>  <br>"melding" according to funi</br>  <br>IKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</br>  This reminds me of Noucome, an anime that looks shitty as fuck at first impressions but actually ends up being the best comedy of the season. Based JC Staff delivers  <br>Where are you going? You're not making any sense.</br>  Censored on Funi.  fello fello fello  <br> those fingerlike toes <br>burn it.</br></br>  <br>And this.<br><br>Everything else remained censored, RIP.</br></br></br>  <br>Can confirm, waiting for Hiryuu it is. I need my lewd handgestures.</br>  <br>That was the only one uncensored unfortunately.</br>  <br> Hiryuu <br><br>I hope you enjoy being 5 weeks behind.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>O-oh. Disregard  then.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. What I don't understand is, why AT-X left sex at this scene, but censored every fig sign which means the same thing in Japan.</br>  <br>This actually kind of show that better watching it raw.</br>  <br>Probably because it's in English.</br>  <br>English words I guess.<br><br><br>My chinese pornflicks tell me raw is always feels better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> is always feels better <br><br>Anon in charge of grammar.</br></br></br>  <br>AT-X has age warning on it like DxD and Okusama, so it should be uncensored if there is anything to censore.</br>  This is the stupidest show I've watched all day.  <br>Isn't it great?</br>  <br>AOTS</br>  Finally an anime about australia  Fucking Christ, Funi.<br>I may actually have to wait for better subs with this one.</br>  So what is this show like?<br><br>Funny/comedy basically?</br></br>  <br>I honestly liked the script, it didn't feel like Funi at all.</br>  <br>Solid AOTS contender. Comedy AOTY contender too. Provided you watch it raw or with good subs.</br>  OHOHOHO  <br>Funi snatched up anything and everything this season, there shit at uploading stuff, fuck, Gangsta isn't even on there yet and I downloaded it with hardcoded subs days ago.</br>  I wouldn't be surprised if those at the helm of the nation are the most immoral of all.  <br>Literally 12 year old humor.</br>  <br>Anon</br>   anime about how censorship is bad <br> awearwrods are censored <br><br>The fucking irony</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had those porncards when I was 12, looks like I was really missing out.</br>  <br>It's because you don't know any better.</br>  <br>Her name is Annie Braun.</br>  <br>Do you?</br>  <br>Tbh I think the censorship fits the atmosphere of the show better.</br>  <br>I know enough to tell when something is wrong but I don't know enough to be able to watch it raw. It's a bad situation to be in.</br>  <br><br>Very weird that they censored some things and uncensord other (or only these two) things.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait what? Did it air in twice? what happened here?</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Why is one censored an the other isnt? Which one actually aired in japan?</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>He probably mean the censored part.</br>  <br>Both versions aired in Japan but only AT-X aired it uncensored.</br>  <br>It aired in two TV channels? Weird</br>  <br>Are you new or something?</br>  <br>Things air in different stations throughout Japan, so some might censor things while other will not, like that one short show with the titty sucking and condom throwing this season.</br>  <br>you don't know anything do you?</br>  <br>It's not weird at all.</br>  <br> that one short show with the titty sucking and condom throwing this season <br>Which one?</br></br>  <br>Thats awful I dont need even more shit to worry about<br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>So they can't even talk about poop? Do they have toilets?</br>    Next week should have some serious lewd.<br>Let's see how they handle that.</br>  <br>That line was actually just "dick". Funi made it about shit for no reason.</br>  What phase like lets blaze it or any other drug refrences?  This show basically SYD without tact.  <br>Japan is a country without degenerates, so there were no drug references.<br><br>Asia is the only place that does things right when it comes to substance abuse. Harsh jail sentences for even minimal offenses.</br></br></br>  <br>So (not the same anon) can AT-X show everything? Or do they have a restriction too, like everything but hentai?</br>  So which TV stations censor and which ones dont     all this newfaggotry <br><br>I'm out, good day.</br></br>  <br>Dont come back</br>  What's the fourth guys.<br><br><br>This show is fucking hilarous, One of the best we'll get this season for sure.<br><br>I hope they get more supporting members, I can see it getting stale between them two.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>navel maybe?</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>The fuck</br>  <br>What?</br>  What the hell is going on?  <br>Lelouch likes it.

Kill yourself</br>  <br><br><br>Because<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's as if people didn't ask for explanation when they read stupid shit</br>  <br>Navel is the one that came to mind but, as it was said previously, boobs is probably what she meant. Or at least, it makes the most sense.</br>    <br>Muh dick.</br>  <br> first time downloading a torrent <br><br>Good job, anon. Now lurk more.</br></br></br>  <br>What? No, I was just mentioning it. Suck my dick anon.</br>  <br>Maybe it's not his fault, anon. It could be a medical issue, like working for Funi.</br>  <br>Please kill yourself.</br>  <br>If he can breath without help he should also be able to notice funi messing up every 2nd scene.</br>  <br>really sad they never sub op/ed. there seems to be a lot of wordplay in the ed and also it's just awesome.</br>  Do we have an episode count yet? Being JC staff tget do everything episode length wise.  <br>Going by the ED that seems very likely. It's pretty obvious she's the shadow character. Rather perverted.</br>  <br> Rather <br>Well based from  , she seems really lewd.</br></br>  <br>I wonder why only she has a special choker. I figured it was because she's probably rich, but you'd figure there would be other people at the school with them. Since it seems like she's about to rape him on multiple occasions I can only hope someone picks up the LN like Fafnir inspired someone.</br>  <br>Truly best girl.</br>  <br>I thought that maybe her choker doesn't function.</br>  sjwsubs when?  <br> Lelouch thinks girls pee from their vaginas. <br>I'm not surprised about this though, you're always ignorant</br></br>  <br> penetrating their urethra </br>  <br><br>that sounds pretty painful tbh</br></br>  <br>I don't understand how that gesture is lewd.</br>  Comedy of the Season right here.<br><br>I just hope that we get non-funishit subs soon.</br></br>  <br>No doubt.<br><br>Sure is a hole though.</br></br></br>  <br>Jerking off motion</br>  How many years ago those bubbles was thing on the west? I already forgot  <br>Easily, very easily, eight years.</br>  Is that log thing a parody of something?<br><br>It remembers me of these 2 scenes:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rWS<wbr>A4ZPR2SQ&amp;t=5m14s</wbr>  [ ]<br>and<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=R0O<wbr>On_bWTj4&amp;t=8m54s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So she's best grill right?<br><br>Can we expect Comiket doujins?</br></br></br></br>  How do you guys list what you're watched?  <br>I don't. What's the point? I already have a 700+ list of things I have yet to watch. If an opportunity to discuss an anime I've watched presents itself, I'll recognize that I've watched it, but the only reason I can think to keep track of old anime would be e-peen, which makes no sense to me.</br>  <br>Because this is a thread filled with people talking about video games and how they've watched such a small amount of anime that they can "remember it all". By the way, if you actually claim you can remember all of the hundreds of series of anime you've seen, you're either lying or are on the spectrum.</br>  <br> friends <br>Clearly you don't belong here.</br></br>  <br> One post with 5 replies <br> &gt;this is a thread filled with people talking about video games <br> Bunch of angry nonsense  <br><br>Tsuntsun I see.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keeping track of what you've seen is handy at times. Especially for series that have lots of spin-offs or sequel seasons with slightly different names, or loads of OVAs/specials, and so on. <br><br>This is what MAL is useful for, because it lists all different types of media as separate entries, even if they are the same series. So OVAs, different seasons, and specials all have their own entry for the same title. This is very handy for long running OVA series that are released several months apart while the main series is ongoing.</br></br></br>  Advanced screening starting in 2 minutes. <br><br>Hopefully we'll get some pre-warning about how Lerche is handling episode one on twitter from people who went to see it.</br></br>  They're also autographing shovels, apparently.  <br>Any particular tags I should be watching?</br>  <br>Just search „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ„Åê„Çâ„Åó on twitter in half an hour or so, I'd say. <br><br>There also might be something on 2ch (http://mastiff.2ch.net/test/read.c<wbr>gi/anime/1435789845/l50), but twitter is the likelier bet.</wbr></br></br></br>  Short silver-haired girl in stockings is so lewd. I'm in love.<br>I haven't read the manga but I hope  she gets gored to death while screaming and crying. </br>  <br> It almost happens on multiple occasions </br>  <br> That may even be better. I just want to see her crying and in pain, so it happening multiple times will only make my dick harder. </br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br>Read it now.</br>  <br>I'm going to Japan at the end of next week, so I've been holding off on picking up any new manga until I can buy some volumes while I'm over there.</br>  <br> Zombie apocalypse in a grimdark world <br>God damn. If the lolis dies without HEALING, I'll drop.</br></br>  <br>If you're going to buy it anyway, why not just read it now?</br>  <br>They aren't loli.</br>  <br>Please Jesus can we just not for once?</br>  <br>Because reading off paper volumes that you bought in a shop is so much more satisfying.</br>  <br>You're gonna get spoilered super fucking bad if you don't read the manga and wander into these threads. It's kind of inevitable.<br><br>It actually only takes about a night to catch up to the current chapter and is a fucking fantastic read, so yeah. Same goes for any other lurkers wondering if they could watch the anime and not get spoilered; basically you'd probably have to stay out of the threads altogether.</br></br></br>  Is this yuri?  <br>No. It's full-blown zombie apocalypse.</br>  It's over. Impressions are rolling in on Twitter now. So far all I've been able to glean is that it's heart pounding.  https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%81<wbr>%8C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%93%E3%81%86%E3%8<wbr>1%90%E3%82%89%E3%81%97&amp;src=typd&amp;ver<wbr>tical=default&amp;f=tweets<br><br>Twitter's getting excited</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  https://twitter.com/Tamashari/statu<wbr>s/617238353855934464<br><br>Uh oh.</br></br></wbr>  I really hope I'm google translating some of these tweets wrong.  So is this some Madoka wanabe?  <br>This is the dumbest thing I've heard all day.</br>  <br>The actual mangaka wrote the screenplay for this though, so changes from the original were totally his call to better fit things; I bet he had a goal of having the anime end on Graduation at all costs.<br><br>Besides some of the early chapters weren't exactly good in my honest opinion; it kind of dragged for a bit while waiting for the "fucking duh" moment of Miki joining.</br></br></br>  Cute<br><br><br>How so?</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is cute!</br>  <br> tfw you'll never have a megu-nee tulpa </br>  <br>Believe, anon!</br>  <br>That doesn't say that Miki is with the group from the beginning, does it?</br>  <br>Megu isn't dead. Miki starts out with them. That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible.</br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible. <br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br>That's what I gathered.<br><br><br>Now that I don't believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku's with the group since the beginning. <br> The reveal at the end of the episode hit harder than the manga's. </br></br>  <br>Well, if you want to see her suffer, you're  in luck. </br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Explain why she's not in any promo art then.</br></br>  Just read the latest chapter.<br> Rii rescued her little sister in a swarm full of zombies, who survive months just by hiding  <br><br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  Twitter's responses seem for the most part very positive. Even with some changes to the manga's plot, the anime is looking like it'll be good.  <br>No shit it's bullshit. Think harder.</br>  <br>It's the teddy bear anon, she's just delusional. Why do you think Yuki is the only one to react while Kurumi and Miki look on worryingly?</br>  <br>Maybe don't skim through it so quickly next time.</br>   Finally get a loli <br> I-It's just a bear! <br>Fuck that shit. I won't believe it until it's 100% confirmed.</br></br>  <br>I'm much more worried that she got fucking bitten in the process and was expecting to see a mark revealed anytime. What does she even do about zombies again? I don't even remember if she uses the flares a lot or had some noise maker, basically only Miki and Kurumi can actually hold their own alone so I assume full and well that Rii's fucked.</br>  <br>Please don't start.</br>  <br>Is this moe/yuri shit?</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>She hoses down zombies early on to save Kurumi, and she uses the glowsticks constantly.</br>  <br>Yes, better leave now.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks anon, I'll stay far away from this garbage.</br>  <br>Start what? I'm not calling the rest of them lolis like the shitposter.

Her sister might have never even existed for all we know and she's going schizo or something inventing things; I don't see how she could have gone all this time and totally forget she even fucking existed until just a second ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not liking your chances. Chapter 36 spoiler.</br>  <br>ha ha holy shit</br>  <br>He used kana for "yuru" which suggests he doesn't mean "loose".</br>  <br>I'm always having a hard time reading between the lines, but damn can't believe she fucking snapped despite being the most rational one.</br>  <br>Fuckin google translating shit wrong</br>  <br>Why bother if you're just going to use google translate. It's completely wrong.</br>  <br>She snapped during the helicopter chapter</br>  What will it take to fix Rii?  <br>I'm trying to get some sense of what they're saying.</br>  <br>When she has to choose between saving either the teddy bear or one of her friends.</br>  <br> Miki starts out with them.  <br>Acceptable, although cutting off her life in the store and later rescue is a shame, i guess it's done to reach a decent halting point in 1 cour.<br> Megu isn't dead.  <br>That doesn't make much sense, if you have to cut stuff (see above) why do something like this that would add pieces? Unless it's going completely off-rails.<br> That one girl no one knew is the MC.  <br>Now that has to be fucking bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Where'd you get that?</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is the "girl no one knew" supposed to be? Kei? If so then basically I think we are going to see a condensed prologue (and basically a retcon from the author, in a tacit admitting that it took way too fucking long for Miki to officially join).</br>  <br><br>It's just obvious bait lads<br><br>Also, if Miki is with the group from the beginning, what happens with Kei? She has a character design for the anime and everything.</br></br></br></br>  https://twitter.com/mosaicwav/statu<wbr>s/617247520314396673<br><br>What staff role does MOSAIC.WAV have? I'm pretty sure they're not doing the OP or ED.</br></br></wbr>  <br>General OST, no?</br>  <br>You can't make a whole OST out of akibapop.</br>  So can someone who actually knows Japanese summarize for us  I have this thing where I go crazy for cute girls that seem normal on the outside but are actually partially insane on the inside.<br><br>I just want to hold her and tell her it's all going to be okay. <br><br>So what's really going to happen is that somehow she and the teddy bear gets separated, and so she goes out of her way to try and get the teddy bear back, which will result in bad things happening.</br></br></br></br>  Is there a thread on 2chan/futaba about this?  <br>Maybe the anime switches it up chronologically and starts after they save Miki, though her rescue is revisited in a flashback?</br>  <br>Maybe, all it is is that the bait and switch had to be extended from, what, eighteen pages to almost an entire episode, so maybe they just included Miki in the bait part just for the first episode.</br>  <br>You only just now come around to Rii for this and not fucking Yuki? <br><br>I kind of laughed when Miki chucked the pistol because I bet she thought at some point, "oh god, what if Yuki got her hands on this".</br></br></br>  My hunch is that the anime will end in the chapter where they left their school behind.  <br>First ep is probably all bait, then the ending it's revealed what's going on, then real shit starts 2nd ep.</br>  <br>How are they going to fit 30 chapters of a monthly manga into 12/13 episodes, especially considering episode one is just chapter one?</br>  <br>I bet she wished she didn't toss it now, with what's happened in the recent two chapters. Could have really made a difference, even if it was simply used for intimidation.</br>  is there a WEG about this?  <br>Skip some unimportant parts and revamp the pacing, it's not that hard to do in anime.</br>  <br>They'll ride off into the sunset / ominous desolate landscape in the camper, I'm like 90% sure of that. <br><br>I'm also wondering if they'll combine the initial field trip and radio-chan seeing that if Miki is not longer at the mall then that part would be kind of useless now. That also also address something that's bugged me in that they never turned on the radio for the mall field trip but did later after graduation; it's not really a plot hole, but just a bit contrived-feeling; without the mall trip happening so early on that can be fixed too.</br></br></br>    <br>It's not going to be a 1:1 adaptation, they've already announced they're going to "change" stuff and the author is working on the screenplay. They'll change, add and drop a lot of stuff so they can make it to that scene. Sadly, this makes it feel like they're not really planning on a S2, even if they sell decently.<br><br>Also, Miki is in every promotional art, even though they don't go to the mall until a lot of shit happens, meaning she'll probably appear a lot faster, if not from the beggining. That's already a sign of fast pacing.</br></br></br>  <br> You only just now come around to Rii for this and not fucking Yuki? <br>Yuki isn't physically attractive to me. On top of that, her crazy is the pantsu on head variant, whereas with Yuuri you can watch her slowly descend into her madness and I find it really attract ive, both her looks, personality and the entire process of her going insane.</br></br>  <br>I don't see something like this selling decently, so having an end at the end of the season would be good.</br>  Fuck, I really wish I could read this over for the first time again.  <br>I know it's kind of cynical but I hope it doesn't get really popular. I get's just popular enough for faster translations and a respectable amount of fanart.</br>  <br>I don't mind it being popular, so long as it's not popular in the west.</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>She's the Mami of the group.<br>Seems rational and mature, but it's mainly a facade put up for her friends which will lead into her snapping after one event too far.</br></br>  <br>What'd be particularly wrong about that? I mean, even with the zombies and focusing on drama, the fact that the character designs are the same sort of thing you'd see in moe SoL shows like Gochiusa and Kinmoza are huge limiting factors to Western popularity.</br>  <br>My hands were trembling bad the whole time for the couple chapters after Kurumi got her special gift from Megu-ne. I can't remember the last time any media got me that panicked; I really thought she wouldn't make it and was about to cry. I'm still beyond spooked at her current condition.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Right. It'll get brushed off and swept under the rug without a second glance by a lot because it must be "pandering moeshit"</br>  <br>Like the Hidamari art style was a barrier to Madoka being popular in the west?</br>  <br>I guess you're right. I hadn't thought of that. It probably was a limiting factor, but with these sort of things, once it goes beyond a certain point, it becomes self-sustaining and that factor stops being limiting in the same capacity.</br>  <br>until they know it has zombies so its going to turn in the walking dead 2.0</br>  <br>I can see it appealing to /co/ or /v/ types, maybe worse (.. edgy bronies or something), looking for some bridging excuse to get into moe designs without completely leaving their comfort zones. With this they can explain to their faggot friends "l-look I don't read it for the girls, you see it's really a brutal zombie story" etc. <br><br>Maybe I'm projecting/fearmongering too hard or something; hopefully I'm wrong. Realistically though I see the chances of this being actually done really well as an anime (as in feels like the manga) as less than 10%; it'll probably sell between 2-6k, 8k max etc but it doesn't matter as we'll still have the manga, of which I think the char designs are 10x better than the anime's anyway so it's no big deal.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been nervous ever since that happened. I don't know how she can be saved, or if she'll suddenly start twitching like the helicopter pilot, or if she'll get colder and look more and more like a corpse as time goes on, or what. I don't think any other story has made me feel so apprehensive. I want new chapters to hurry up and come out but at the same time I hope they're never released.</br>  <br>I think the heli pilot at least showed that apparently, you're fine as long as you keep re-dosing the medicine whenever symptoms come back bad. <br><br>Apparently it's hard to do it yourself though once your body starts to lose control, so, it might depends on whether anyone's close by her when it acts up again on whether she can re-dose to stave it off. Fuck, that brings up so many terrible possibilities, now I wish I hadn't thought of it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Higurashi all over again. Remember when people called it "Killer Lolis"?<br><br>This shit will be "zombie lolis xD" all over the internet if it gets popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, but imagine the journey during all of that. First, she'll get a little twitch or two every day, and she might brush it off as stress or that her muscles are fatigued. But over the course of a few days, it gets worse and worse, and she realizes what's going on. When someone notices and tries to say something about it, she'll brush it off with a laugh and change the subject. And then, a day or two later, it gets to the point where it can't be ignored. She spills water when trying to drink, has difficulty picking up food with a spoon, and then she almost breaks down because she can't do basic everyday functions and her body isn't hers any more. Someone gets the idea to reuse the medicine, and the twitch goes away. But that's not the end of the ride. With every dose, the medicine's effectiveness wears off. The time it takes for symptoms to show up decreases, and its intensity increases. Soon, it never completely goes away.<br><br>And then they have to abandon the RV with all of the medicine onboard in an incident.</br></br></br>    Why did Yuyushiki change it's name?  <br>And add a fourth main character.</br>  <br>and a shovel</br>  <br>And most importantly, twintails.</br>  <br>And even more importantly a  dog that fucking dies </br>  <br>Speaking of, I didn't see anyone on twitter mention the dog.</br>  <br>The dog doesn't come in till later, unless they do a flashback early.</br>  <br>I thought the dog would be there from the start, since it did have a significant presence in the artwork and the trailer. Even has its own character page.</br>  <br>It's probably just to fool people into thinking it's some slice of life. That dog only lasts for 3-5 pages in the manga.</br>  <br> bear plush with mustache in the promo </br>  So, official conclusion is, its shit with anime orignal plot?  <br>Could someone translate some of the comments?</br>  <br>What's wrong, don't you like cute harmless bears?</br>  <br>It sounds like it's going with an anime original plot, but not in a bad way.</br>  <br>But certainly not in a good way, either.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It could end up even better than the manga.</br>  So, it's shit right?<br><br>Damn.<br><br>Why couldnt they just follow the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why you're saying this so authoritatively.<br><br>Granted it's probably shit, but it's not certain.</br></br></br>   „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ„Åê„Çâ„Åó„Åå„Å©„Çì„Å™ÂÜÖÂÆπ„Åã„ÇíÊäΩË±°ÁöÑ„Å´‰æã„Åà„Çã„Å™„Çâ„ÄÅ„ÅäËä±Áïë„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´ÁÅ´ÁÇéÊîæ<wbr>Â∞ÑÂô®„ÅåÁΩÆ„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÇ„ÇãÊÑü„Åò</wbr> <br><br>wwwww</br></br>  <br>I've looked through a couple dozen but pretty much no one's talking about the actual content of the episode. It's either hype for GG! by mangafags, people buying GG! volumes, people listing their seasonal animus, other people saying the characters are kawaii, etc. <br>Just one guy was commenting about the episode and he said it was gud. Another guy said that the only problem with the screening concerned seating arrangements and bad organization in the theater.</br></br>  What's the deal with this?<br><br>https://www.evernote.com/shard/s577<wbr>/sh/492c9cee-25e1-46db-89ec-12b4acc<wbr>36522/46ad5a60b0971771a8aa5ed04afbd<wbr>7fa</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> wearing stocking suspender at school <br>What the hell?

At least we know that one person said it's good.</br>  <br>Looks like a summary of episode one.<br><br> ‚Äª spoilers. And I have read the original is the school Gurashi one episode for people who could not come to the prior screenings in rural areas. Ikansen snow is a lot scene running down the hallway, there may be a place where it is ambiguous place and wrong. Since the main are reading series might be some place you do not know where you're saying is people who do not read only book. (Example of the beard of flies were stuffed animals, etc.) <br><br><br> start from the scene where snow is sleeping peacefully in the futon. You have a beard of flies were stuffed example  <br>Taromaru is cause licking the snow. And it tries to wake everyone, but there are only snow in the bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of snow where snow trimmed the dressed. Snow running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. OP after Megu not the encounter. Megu downlink 's not not. To school life part of then it had arrived. Morning by adding the Me-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of one Volume eat the rice it has been modified to the scene. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Me-kun is not liked by Taromaru. Lee is scold Taromaru. Then introduced a scene that the original four volumes Nomi kun eat rice deliciously. Snow I impersonation eat deliciously. Snow toward the classroom for day duty. It can be stopped by to not Megu here. Shadow thin and is Ru dis. Character and conversation in the entourage two people and classroom ‚ë† of image. ‚ë° teacher also appeared.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Junior Nomi-kun comes to classroom lesson started, but it should but sleep in the beginning as class one volume is in class. Snow but say'm no good to come because in class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Me kun visited because gone is Taromaru. To Yukiwami kun says while walking to be "tense Me kun. Do will be nervous from entering the senior," but it is immediately denied. Looking Taromaru from here. Yukigami say tension has come undone and in-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Although if they closed the window could not be sure it was intentional sound effects) cries of Taromaru here. Voice I going to hear direction. <br><br> Here A part end. After Al CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Here from the B part <br>to chase the Taromaru but Taromaru is to enter the barricade front of the classroom with dexterity, but go towards the dead end (barricade of desks). Me-kun is also tries to enter the classroom is stopped and is said to be in class on snow. Confused look of Me-kun. Me kun enters the classroom from the greeting. However Taromaru the grabbed is not Taromaru getaway. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taromaru is directed to the roof. Go to the roof and walnut and joined a good capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel is walnut there are Lee again Taromaru and nephew foot race. But I get angry in Taromaru to Taromaru entered the rooftop garden. Angry to other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life part knowledge of the downlink. <br>Because you Taro capture, scene change school life part. Put lead in Taromaru. The contents of the combined content and 19 pages of from here on page 11. Snow to the classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Also Me kun became worried to act alone and decided to go after the snow. Descended of also "I like school recently." Snow will arrive in the classroom and the character we and Taromaru conversation about ‚ë†. While here in the real over-kun is coming, but the disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of here with snow roughness of pages 22-23 is Itemi kun in the classroom is the classroom door. Snow that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall together with the actual over-kun, also wind blows. I close the window because the window is left open. So snow of the face is made up ed rush. <br>ED after the next notice<br><br>Notice next time <br>Taromaru times ish. # 2 Memories</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   https://twitter.com/hail_st/status<wbr>/617279675769860096</wbr> <br> Gold Moza for novelty school Gurashi from one episode and I was bought enough to advance if promoted to not only despair gradually increasing despair </br>  <br>Contents of the episode.

From what I read here, it seem to have ended in a good tone without the darkness that's gonna come.</br>   EVERYTHING <br> IS <br> FINE </br></br>  <br>I feel like my soul's being judged.</br>  <br> know nothing about this anime/manga <br> see the opening <br> look like healing anime <br> start learning more about it <br> start seeing page like this  <br> get scared, check wikipedia <br> &gt;Yuki seeks out fun school activities every day whilst Kurumi and Y≈´ri protect her, because in reality, they are the sole survivors of their school after a zombie outbreak overruns the city. <br>What the hell is that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well  says the reveal's at the end of the episode.</br>  <br>They look like frog's eyes.</br>  <br>Wait, Mikis with them from the start?<br>That's fucking stupid.</br></br>  <br>clearly not something for you, you fucking newfag.</br>   WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU   <br><br>With the extra characters they showed, I figured there was a high chance of anime original stuff.<br><br>They could still incorporate Miki's background into the story well. so all is not lost</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it'll still be good.<br><br><br>Damn, that hurts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if Miki's with them from the start her snapping at yuki for being delusional sounds like it would be out of place.<br><br>The anime is starting to scare me, i really hope they don't screw the story up.<br><br><br>Like i said in the previous post, i hope they make good of it being like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> While here in the real over-kun is coming, but the disturbing bgm.  <br> Snow that conversation alone. <br>Going by this, the reveal is indeed in the last minutes of the first episode. The second line probably means "Yuki is talking alone/to herself".</br></br></br>  <br> You couldn't guess the significance without having read the mango <br>That's why it's a good, subtle hint.</br></br>  <br>It hurts to watch.</br>  <br>I hope the next few episodes are a "one week earlier..." type of thing, so we can see when it was just the three of them and see Mii-kun's rescue.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br> Lerche <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br> Makes it look like shovel is walking around in a normal school with a shovel <br>That's way too cute, shovel moe best moe.<br><br>That zoom in on megu-nee looks like a reminiscence ;_;<br><br><br>That could work, but how the hell are they planning to do this while wasting an entire episode on SOL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's all over the first episode: </br>  Rii-chan is my waifu  <br>This is way too upbeat. They must be changing it later on.</br>  <br>You know, this really does not sound like just a generic moe SoL OP. It sounds almost too cutesy to the point of feeling artificial.</br>  <br>No, I don't think so. Think of Woto's ED. It's there for the contrast.</br>  <br>Shovel is my waifu!</br>  <br>Get ready for the storm of people calling her their waifu over the next few months.</br>  <br>The real ruse is that full show will be happy sol without zombies to make mangafags really mad.</br>  <br> Aijou Yuujou <br><br>But yeah, it'll probably change.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind this as much as you'd might think. Since I like the manga so much, I'd scrutinize the anime if it skipped over something or didn't do a scene as well as in the manga. But if it went full cutesy SOL, we'd get to see how their lives would have been like without the zombie apocalypse, which in turn make the manga that much more upsetting.</br>  <br>I got used to it a long time ago, there's already two of us in here.<br>Plus i don't care because they're all just seasonal waifu fags who move on to a new waifu once the shows done.<br><br><br>I would be fucking furious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I would be fucking furious. <br>But then you're waifu wouldn't become a walking corpse.</br></br>  <br>She also wouldn't be the same girl i fell for, would she?<br><br>  At least thats what my time travel movies tell me.  </br></br></br>  <br>He'd also get NTR'd by the track and field senpai that shovel had a crush on.</br>  <br>I'll bash that kids head in.<br>In secret of course.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't seem like it'd be too hard. Looks like a girl.</br>  <br>He honest to god looks like he belongs in Free! the clothing and all.</br>    There's something wrong with me, i cant stop watching the OP   and I'm enjoying it.    <br>If you've downloaded it and are playing it on MPC, hit ctrl + down arrow. Fun times.</br>  W-Will they all die at the end?  <br>Fake op. they'll change it at ep3 with Magia.</br>  <br>If they go for that sort of ending its likely that yukis gonna be the only one to survive.<br>;_;</br></br>  <br> yfw this is the actual OP for ep2 onwards </br>  <br> implying they're not already except Yuki </br>  <br>Oh my fucking christ.</br>  <br> they all die at the end besides Yuki and she gets saved and cherishes the graduation book <br><br>Oh god</br></br></br>  <br> anons react to the GG anime.png </br>  <br><br>pls no</br></br>  <br>I really want a happy end, but I can't see it happening.</br>  <br>Jesus anon don't make me think about that sort of shit ;_;<br><br><br>Haha, that's kinda accurate considering the dogs there for like 5 minutes and then's gone.<br>In the manga anyway, who knows about the anime.<br><br><br>Zombie stories VERY rarely have happy endings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just have to believe in the power of friendship, love, and the shovel.</br>  <br>Did they confirm the outbreak was worldwide or only in Japan? If it's only in Japan maybe there's a chance.</br>  <br>The happiest end I can see is one of them surviving.</br>  <br> Start from the scene that Yuki is sleeping peacefully in the futon. Taroumaru bring stuffed toy with a beard and cause licking Yuki. Although tries to wake everyone, there are only Yuki to bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of Yuki where Yuki has established a dressed. Yuki is running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. Encounter with the OP after Megu-nee. "It's not Megu-nee" scene. Then follow arrived for the school life club. It has been modified to the scene to eat rice morning by adding the Mii-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of first volume. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Mii-kun is not liked by Taroumaru. Rii-san is scold Taroumaru. Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. Yuki toward the classroom for day duty. Here it can be stopped by to Megu-nee. Shadow is thin (and censored?). Conversation ‚ë† of character of image and its entourage two people and the classroom. ‚ë° teacher also appeared. <br> Start of classes, as beginning one Volume and even though it is sleep in class, such should be in class junior of Mii-kun comes to the classroom. Yuki can say as no good to come because during class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Mii-kun visited because gone is Taroumaru. Yuki to Mii-kun "Mii-kun are tense. We'll got to nervous from entering the senior" says while walking, but is immediately denied. Looking Taroumaru from here. Yuki say that unraveling tensions in Mii-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Or it is closed windows could not be confirmed, but it was a deliberate sound effect) Here Taroumaru barking of. Headed in the direction in which voice is heard. Here A part end. After there is CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br></br>  <br><br>I'd say more the assault alarm thing is a hint than a kitchen knife next to cooking stuff, that isn't normal school life stuff.<br><br> Running past happy cardboard cutout students. <br> Every week <br>No. No no no.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not believing in the shovel <br>There are people who do that?<br>What filthy people.<br><br><br>They're teenage girls stuck in a school for 4/5ths of the manga, we know jack shit about whats going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who do that? <br>Shovel's going to go zombie someday (probably while they're at the university or on the way to the Randall Corp. building). I have faith in Cat Hat growing to become the competent leader of cute schoolgirls that I know she can be, because god knows Shovel won't be around for too long, crazy's too crazy, and garter's more of a follower than a leader.</br></br>  <br>Realistically these zombies wouldn't be too much of a threat in countries that have a well-armed military and are spacious, like the US and Russia. And honestly with all the "Zombie Hunting Permit" and "Zombie First Response Team" bumper stickers I've been seeing recently this seems like every redneck's wet dream.</br>  <br> Shovel's going to go zombie someday <br>M-meanie ;_;<br>You just have to believe in the shovel anon, even with her dying breath she'll save everyone!</br></br></br>  <br> every redneck's wet dream. <br>Everyone with a gun's wet dream, really. World War Z (the book)'s a pretty interesting read on how the fuck a zombie outbreak would occur, or at least a somewhat believable take on how one would happen.</br></br>  The last time they'll see her it'll be like this scene. Her back will be turned towards them as she faces off a horde of zombies. They'll shout her name in desperation, as if shouting could save her. In response, she'll turn her head and give one last soft, small smile that tells them she's accepted her fate. She'll thank them, tell them that she loves them, but that they have to go. She'll turn forward, close her eyes and take a deep breath, unaffected by the voices crying out her name, then quietly say, "goodbye," and run off to her death.  <br>Anon, please.<br>As if we haven't had enough of these today ;_; <br>What makes it even worse is the fact that something like this is extremely likely and something shovel would do.</br></br></br>  <br>And later, like with Garter's friend we will see her as a zombie in the background.</br>  <br>But zombies don't detect her anymore. She won't die to zombies.</br>  <br> Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. <br>Is he saying that this scene is in the first episode? That's got me worried. That means they aren't planning to do it later. It was an important scene, too, since it happened after 4 chapters of shit hitting the fan and it finally showed them being able to relax a little bit.</br></br>  So /a/, are you prepared for the inevitable zombie apocalypse caused by scientists experimenting with fungi? What weapons do you have? How many supplies do you stockpile? Do you have any military/survival experience?  <br> While chasing Taroumaru he go towards the barricades of the desk but then turn to classroom before the barricade. Mii-kun also tries to enter the classroom, but is stopped and is said to be during class to Yuki. Confused look of Mii-kun. Mii-kun to enter the classroom from the greeting. However Taroumaru escape without being grabbed. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taroumaru is directed to the roof. There are Kurumi and Rii-san, Kurumi is joined to said capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel, again Taroumaru distant foot race. But Taroumaru is I get angry in that entered the rooftop garden. Angry also other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life club knowledge part. Because it Tarou capture, scene change to school life club. <br> Put lead in Taroumaru. From here the contents on page 11 to page 19 combined content. Yuki is to classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Mii-kun became worried to act alone was also to be chasing after Yuki. "I like school recently" part. Yuki to be arrive in the classroom and conversation to the characters of ‚ë† about Taroumaru. Between here Mii-kun is coming, but as disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of where Yuki roughness of pages 22-23 is at classroom and Mii-kun is a at classroom door. Yuki that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall with Mii-kun, the wind blows. While the wind raging since windows and close the window because it left open has broken windows. So face of Yuki becomes up ed rush. <br><br> ED after the next episode notice <br><br> Taroumaru ish times. <br> #2 Memories <br><br>So I've tried to make that Japanese paste about the contents of the episode more understandable (still using google translator). Though I guess nobody cares anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about that. I dunno then. Maybe other survivors will get her, but I get the feeling the author won't do that.</br>  <br>Maybe the anime is supposed to be a prologue for the manga, just like FTWD.</br>  <br>Well actually it would work as we saw with the scene with Miki they react to her if she does something sudden like the shout.</br>  <br>Thanks anyway anon, now it's time to panic</br>  <br> western art </br>  <br>Sounds quite a bit different. Why couldn't they have just followed the manga? There's absolutely nothing wrong with the manga's plot in the initial chapters.</br>  <br>They just want to make the twist at the end of the episode and without filler that was impossible.</br>  <br>They're gonna fuck it all up. The more I think about it, the less hope I have. Damnit, someone sound the alarm.</br>  <br>The twist is literally the most important part of the opening episode. They'll put more budget and talent into it. Don't worry.</br>   not a faithful adaptation <br><br>All hope is lose.</br></br>  <br>sausga Lerche</br>  <br>Who knows, the author might opt to have a complete surprise happy end.<br>Given the overall tone and context, I doubt there'll be a BAD END for the sake of it. Somehow even with all the suffering going on, the story is in essence about how people who understand each other and stick together can manage to make it through hardships, even if there's no guarantee of beating any and all obstacles.<br><br><br>Yeah but the author is in charge of series composition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop thinking if you're just spiralling down into forced negative thoughts.</br></br>  While the adaptions unfaithfulness is scaring me I think its best to wait till episode 1 is out to judge it.<br><br>I just hope so much they don't fuck up.</br></br>  <br> have a complete surprise happy end. <br>The ultimate bait and switch, the whole manga was a story Yuki was writing.</br></br>  <br>Now we don't know what's going to happen. No one is safe.</br>  <br>Doing that without giving any hints pretty much sucks though</br>  <br>I don't deny that.</br>  They have the manga writer, of course they aren't going to follow the source material.  <br>They haven't done that much worldbuild8mg. I kind of wish they would, kind of wish they wouldn' t. I love worldbuilding, but I can also see how the story can be better told if things like that are kept mysterious.</br>  <br>I'm the same. Part of me wants to know more about the virus and what's happening in the world but I also want that the manga stays with 4 girls trying their best to survive.</br>  <br> the whole manga is actually Yukis dream, while she is stuck in an even worse reality </br>  <br> Yuki killed her friends and is in an asylum trying to come up with an excuse for why they died </br>  <br> The whole last chapter is Yuki waking up every few pages, every time in a different reality, sometimes a good one, sometimes not, and ends with her waking up for real and we don't know if the reality is good or not. </br>  <br><br><br>Anons stop, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br> but I get the feeling the author won't do that. <br> other survivors try to murder/rape them for their shit <br> Shovel offers herself in return for the safety of her friends <br> Shovel goes full zombie as her friends leave and... </br></br></br></br>  The entire series was actually  Miki's  delusion after she snapped and made up a scenario where she was rescued and found friends.  <br> it's actually Yuki remembering all the time he passed with her friends just before he gets eaten by zombies </br>  <br>That would be awesome, but I wonder if she's actually infectious already...<br><br> Unholy forbidden love </br></br></br>  <br>I'm sold.</br>  <br>I'd love me some of that unholy forbidden love.</br>  <br>It would make sense if she was trying to commit suicide via drugs, which would be ambiguous and a pretty fitting ending.</br>  <br> Yuki, who is scared, alone, infected, and without any supplies makes her way back to the school and finds a gun <br> Yuki then... </br></br>  <br>Please this OP only apply in episode 1 only.<br>I can't stand this amount of illusion  ;_; </br></br>  <br>That would be pretty good, i'm a sucker for ambiguous ending.</br>  <br> Yuki has reverted to insanity <br> From the perspective of the other characters she is holding a gun <br> "Say cheese" </br></br></br>  Might someone translate this shovel?  <br>What would make you think this?</br>  <br>the handle says gaku gurashi.<br>fuck me if I can decipher the writing on the actual shovel but I think its just autographs</br></br>  and also  <br> tfw you'll never own a shovel signed by shovel herself </br>  <br>there seem to be some words in some autograph</br>  <br><br><br><br>I want my shovel signed!</br></br></br></br>  <br>those are just names</br>  <br>yeah just names</br>  <br>Taroumaru...<br>LOVE...<br>*sob*...<br>Miki<br><br>SHOVEL<br>LOVE<br><br>School live club<br>is "the best"<br><br>I love everyone so much ‚âß‚àá‚â¶<br>[heart]Yuki[/heart]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She snapped before that.<br><br>She was always the most responsible one and tried to be the strongest of mind. First sign of trouble in paradise is when she flips out at Miki for suggesting Yuki shouldn't be playing around. Shit really starts going downhill when  Kurumi is bitten  and after that it's just a matter of time.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't see anything weird. It's just Yuki hugging a little girl, probably because she's afraid.</br>  <br>Why would you hire the original writer if you weren't planning on changing or adding new shit?</br>    <br>It would probably be another Madoka sort of deal.</br>  so apparently in ep1 we get happy 23 mins plus shaky last minute.  <br>I'm going to screenshot the comments on nyaa, just so we can see what the reaction might have been.</br>  <br> yfw it's Yucky Tuna all over again </br>  <br>it hurts</br>  <br>To think this is all happening in Yuki's head</br>  Yuki and Miki are loli.  healing anime of the season  BTW I've just remembered that aside from the designer who's working on character designes they also have another designer who's doing „Åã„Çå„Çâ„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥. „Åã„Çå„Çâ„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥ translates as "their design". At first I was confused about who do their mean by "them" but then I've remembered that Yuki and co. don't have a name for zombie, right? So I guess it's a nice touch that they actually have a different designer for "them" (who's also a character designer for Carnival Phantasm).  <br> the people in the background of Yuki's shot are paper cutouts <br>They aren't even suffering yet and I can't take it.</br></br>  <br>That sounds perfectly fine, I'm not sure why people are worried.<br><br>My only concern is how Kei will be included if Miki is already there.</br></br></br>  <br>You ruined half the fun of the manga which is reading it completely blind. Just read the manga before you get spoiled.</br>  Next chapter scanlation when?  <br>It'd be cool if "them" is the government soldiers or something</br>  <br>Ask deel.</br>  <br><br>I already downloaded it on my own, but someone should put it on nyaa.</br></br>  <br>Will this be the Aijou Yuujou of our generation?</br>  <br>The Yuuki Yuuna of 2015.</br>  But Yucky Tunda didn't have a diabetes OP/ED like this or Aijou Yuujou.  <br>Brilliant</br>  <br><br>Meant to quote.</br></br>  <br>You know the only reason they posted the OP before the show aired was because it will inevitably change for episode 2, right?</br>  Can someone post the OP on /wsg/?  <br>This is fantastic, the Megu-nee shot especially.</br>  <br>So misleading. I love it.</br>  <br>I hope they don't change the OP throughout the show and have all the PV's look all happy and such just for added misleading</br>  We have to wait four more days.  <br>Holy fucking shit, I can't stop laughing. They are totally going for catching the anime-only audience completely, entirely off-guard.</br>  Have you guys properly read the spoilers? It's pretty much just an extended version of the first episode that ends with the exact same destroyed classroom shot.  <br>My body is ready to be healed, if that's the case. The adorable SoL shenanigans in Yuki's head are enough to prevent suicide. Just ask Shovel and CrayCray.</br>  <br>The only significant change is Miki being there, right? Unless we've mistaken that as well</br>  Let's take some hints from the OP<br><br>Does this mean field trip is confirmed?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Why else would Garters be there in the first place?</br>  <br>It's cute how they think they'll fool the watchers when the vast majority already knows what happens. Especially when they can get spoiled by simply googling the title.<br><br>But they are trying at least, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Most people don't know about the psychological thing.</br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>They won't be expecting the twist at the end of the episode, or at least not the twist they were expecting.</br>  <br>How come? Again, if you google the title you'll see it's nothing like the OP and Lerche is trying to bait the few fools going in blind. It could have worked if this was an original project but this is an adaptation.</br>  <br>Lyrics could be worth looking at if you fancy typing it all out<br><br><br>People would just call it the Madoka of Zombie films.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This kind of bait and switch is obviously not gonna work on people who browse anime discussion forums. But there are many "casuals" who picks up shows based on poster alone, and not to mention japs who don't know about the show and just happened to watch it when it's broadcasting on TV.</br>  Maon Kurosaki songs are pretty chuuni so the ED should be fitting:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ffN<wbr>4ayEkKcc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Good thing I read the manga</br>  <br>I lost it at the 'genki desu' note.</br>  <br>desu note you say?</br>    I want to heal Mii-kun with my dick.  <br> RIFE ON ZA GAKKOU </br>  <br>I wlll never despair.</br>  <br>It hilarious that it starts with a 3 second cheesy terror intro before going full cute girls mode.</br>  <br>Most of the guys who pick this up are there for the "twist" and just that. They must have read it in other forums, but never bothered to go inside the source. They may seem to be prepared for it, but no, they're not. It's like expecting to get shot.<br><br> After that, they either stick to it or drop it.</br></br></br>  <br>More like wonderful.</br>  <br>Especially since it seems to air at 23:30 which is pretty early for anime I think.</br>  <br>who is this semen demon.</br>  <br>A little early, but stuff like KinMoza S1 was 10pm. It just depends on the intended audience.</br>  <br>Her name is Love.</br>  <br>Holy fuck there's a boy there.</br>  <br>No it isn't.</br>  <br>dont worry hes dead</br>  WATASHITACHI<br><br> Shit's stuck in my head now. </br></br>  <br> TANOSHINDERU </br>  <br>Bless you.</br>  Miki doesn't get enough love, I say.  <br>I thought she was the most loved Gurashi along with Shovel.</br>  <br>She's the most canon sexualized gurashi.</br>  <br>No one likes Shovel.</br>  <br>u wot m8</br>  <br>I give her more than enough love.</br>  <br>That's just wrong.</br>  <br>GA KOKONI IMASU</br>  <br>Shovel is a ho.</br>  <br>Ssh, you'll make Shovelfags mad</br>    <br>She's a zo.</br>  <br>THE ERA OF BLUE BACKGROUNDS ENDED LONG AGO GRANDPA</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I just call it retro and get on with life.</br>  <br><br>How is this even possible?</br></br>  Shovel is not really going to die is she?  <br>How is what possible?</br>  <br>Dead as a door nail.</br>  <br>No, she won't because has already been dead for a while.</br>  <br>YOU FOOL</br>  <br><br>Stop that!</br></br>  <br>Only if you stop instigating me to do it.</br>  <br>Oh I get it. You can only do it twice.</br>  <br>You got me.</br>  <br>At least you admit your defeat honorably.</br>    <br>Fuck, having flashbacks of that chapter now.</br>  There are no subs yet? I want my loli suffering  <br>It hasn't even aired yet</br>  <br> subs <br>more like dubs</br></br>  <br>Nigga, it airs on thursday.<br><br>Nice quints though</br></br></br>  <br>that get won't make it come faster, anon. just be patient.</br>  Even the animation staff likes her the most.  <br>That's just coincidence</br>  <br>I asked DDY if they were going to sub the OP before the first episode comes out, and they said no. All they'll do is use it as reference to translate the OP before the first episode hits to release the first episode faster, and they weren't even sure they'd do that.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Look at all this dubs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Goddamn it</br>   Steppen King   <br>Their eyes scare me</br>  <br>Maybe if someone else asks them, they'll feel more inclined to do it?</br>  <br>typo</br>  <br>Contact the sluts. They'll get them to do it<br>I mean, you saw how long they were fapping before Okusama's subs were released</br></br>  <br>  Steppen King <br>At least she knows her literature</br></br>  <br>Someone tell them on twitter or something so they can fix it before final release.</br>  <br> implying this isnt done on purpose </br>  <br>Why would it be?</br>  <br>Copyright, if you put someone's name in a product and sold it you can get sued</br>  <br>So I should start to put my name on some things!</br>  <br>A relative of the famous musician, Steppen Wolf?</br>  <br>Booooorn to be wiiiiild!</br>  That cup is cute as fuck.  <br>Indeed.</br>  <br>Yuki's</br>  <br>It's like when Yuki asked her to pose for her cup portrait she just got annoyed at having her face drawn on her cup at all.</br>  <br>half empty</br>   That chapter where Kurumi visits her house <br>I know I'm barely in the thick of it but dear god that fucked me up more than it should</br>  <br>You laughed too hard too?</br>  <br>Was I supposed to? Am I too delicate of a flower?</br>  <br>If you haven't been spoiled yet you should get out. You're in for one hell of a ride.</br>  <br>You are.</br>  <br>Oh no I've been spoiled hell and back and I read most of it a while back but my memories fuzzy after an accident<br>I'm walking through it again to jab my memory</br></br>  <br>Don't walk.</br>  <br>It's a steady jog!</br>  <br>uh... yeah</br>  <br>Oh, that was a joke, wasn't it?<br>See, accident. Data's all gone</br></br>  <br>Data was the worst thing about New Generation.</br>  <br>HEY!<br> Never watched past the original Star Trek so I have no idea </br></br>  <br>Okay Troi was the worst to be honest.</br>  <br> OK I lied, I never watched Star Trek </br>  <br>How can you not watch Star Trek?

I like them  Tired forced meme fetish.  <br>  recognize that girl in the corner <br>  there were like 4 more futabu animations after the first 2 <br><br>holy shit how the fuck did this get past me.</br></br></br></br>    <br>To be fair I didnt hear about it until like last week myself</br>  <br>delicious</br>  I prefer pale white, blondes girls.  <br> Futabu Mix is animated by Queen Bee <br><br>Just why. Why can't that animation studio fuck off and die?</br></br></br>  <br>Life aint fair.<br><br><br>two different OVAs, the first was named Futabu! and the second "Futabu!!" yes just another exclamation mark, so you probably just skipped it over thinking it was the same thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Plus some are called futa club on sukibei</br>  <br>I like them, especially if they have huge  dicks </br>  <br>Small dicks need more love.</br>  <br>The new ova sucked balls.</br>  <br>Not brown enough.</br>  How about brown boys?  <br>Why not both?<br> pic related </br></br>    I prefer mine a little roughed up.  <br/>     tfw you like brown animu girls and 2D black girls equally but you'll never get both in one show, never get an animu with an episode about kawaii black hair problems, and you'll never have cutesy love shit where a generic dense MC falls for a girl with an afro   <br>Best female protag other from Kamille</br>  The only thing better than a brown girl is two brown girls.  <br>Best Futabu.<br><br><br>Excellent taste.</br></br></br></br>  why was the animation so shitty in this one?  <br>It was pretty good by Queen Bee standards.</br>  Brown elf girls are even better.  More Futabu manga &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Futabu anime.  <br>i prefer the blue one though.</br>  Best  Disgusting meme  <br>Just don't expect the same quality of animation from Futabu Mix, if you end up downloading that.<br><br>Different studio, and the worst one at that.</br></br></br>  <br>They are second only to tomboys in my opinion.</br>  <br>Enjoy your QueenB</br>  <br>Tomboy beats everything.</br>  <br>kerry pls</br>  <br>Best futabu right there</br>  <br>thankfully they overlap alot of the time, bonus points if /fit/</br>  <br>But he's a slut.</br>  <br> Don't want to fap today <br> This picture <br>W-Well, I mean, my hand just fell onto my lap, and it is Laura so it's fine</br></br></br>  <br><br>Absolutely degenerate.<br>Go white or go home.</br></br></br>  <br>  tfw no RATE doujins will ever get animated <br>  tfw no Futanarun either <br>  or Alice in Sexland </br></br></br>  <br>I'm in love with da coco</br>  <br> You will never watch Kyouko masturbate in various locations while listening to her monologue about how perverted she is. </br>  <br>All the robo shit was stupid and unnecessary.<br><br>I came for futa dicks, not robocop strap-ons and fuckhuge ugly metal onaholes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Agreed, that stuff is a boner-killer.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, tripfag.</br>  <br><br> Didn't enjoy Akane finally being able to fuck a futa. </br></br>  The best part of that OVA is when the National Anthem starts playing when the futabu members are reading the email from the American Nigger at the end.  <br>But she didn't, it was fake.<br><br>I would've rather cliched miracle drugs more that some ugly fucking strap-on tentacle.</br></br></br>  <br>These would be incredible if the art wasn't so shit.</br>  It's pretty good   japanese for some reason love phimosis  <br>this seriously intrigues me, how the fuck is phimosis hot at all</br>  <br>That dress fold looks weird...shitty art amirite?</br>  <br>the artist has actually improved alot over the last 2 or 3 years</br>  <br>Scene with the Tan Tomboy was good.</br>  Perfect on pure maidens.<br><br> Except Yukikaze.

I thought Phimosis was having the head unable to escape the confines of the foreskin?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's a false phimosis which makes it convenient for the woman to peel back and then get at that smegma bounty.</br></br>  <br> smegma bounty. <br>oh god</br></br>  <br>Yes there's a difference; having enough skin to leave the head fully or partially covered doesn't mean it CAN'T be unsheathed.</br>  <br>If I had that reaction image of Captain Haddock projectile vomiting over the gunwale I'd have posted it in this response.</br>  <br>Huh.

Is he doing the LA food truck scene are doing?</br>  <br>It's weird, because he, just like everyone else, had to register a place for his shop. If he can just move it around to other places and mess with other people's spots at will, it's pretty fucked up.</br>  <br>He could go in between sections where nobody set up shop. Like next to a park or something. His spot I don't thing anyone cares about. Nobody wanted it.</br>  <br>If he does that  I hope he fucking loses against Yugi anyway </br>  <br>I'm sorry, anon. All is fair in Capitalism.</br>  <br>why is chibi Erina so cute</br>    <br>Takumi looks pretty weird for some reason.</br>  <br>Well, they set up zones. With restrictions on what you can do in each zone, and pricing restrictions too. There's definitely rules here. I don't think he can move out of his zone at will.</br>  <br>I want to pinch his cheeks.</br>  If Souma has a plan, he really should have told Megumi.

It's just for archive purposes.</br>  <br>She's the only confident one.</br>  i think this series is one of the most genuinely enjoyable to read. the characters are all likeable, the shonen aspects aren't that prominent, the adaptation is faithful, idk. this is one of the few series that makes me happy to be reading it.  <br>This is lacking all the details of the original but damn, I will never be over Shinomiya in the uniform. Based Tosh. Could've put him in his usual chef's outfit, as he still kept Souma, Nikumi, and Alice in what they usually wear.</br>  <br> implying he doesn't already have a shit ton of doujins waiting to be released </br>  <br>Fuck this filter. It looks ugly.</br>  <br> confident SnS girls <br>Hnnnnngh. That moment when Hisako made an honest connection with Soma was the best.</br></br>  <br> I want to marry Takumi. </br>  <br>This would look better as a new Takumi's hairstyle instead of weird haircut he got.</br>  i want to see Eishi cook. i want his cold perfection to be demonstrated.  <br>the only genuine smile there is Isshiki's anyway.</br>  <br>inviting the fate fanbase is a bad idea friend</br>  <br>We'll have a joint Cooking Manga Thread.

Fuck, Soma is such a Gary Stu in such a charismatic way.  <br> he woukd have hit around 800 servings <br><br>No anon. He would not. Souma ran himself ragged in just a half hour. He wouldn't be able to maintain the pace for 2 hours. Moreover, he was only able to pull in those numbers by scraping off some of Erina's extras.<br><br>Had she been on the other side of the hall, he would have been boned with his late start.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He should rub it in her face.<br><br> hey thanks for the help Erina I'm so glad you're always looking out for me ;^) </br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't he kind of do that at the Election and the Festival?</br>   decide to try one of the recipes from SnS <br> everything is going well <br> mom see me cooking <br> "wow anon, that looks good. did you get the recipe from the internet?" <br> "yeah, mom. the internet." <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people are inviting the  animefags with OP pic  to begin with, even if it's just a veil.

Logh would be only level 3-4 as well due to so many people watching it for instant hipster cred these days.</br>  <br>OPs pic is incorrect.</br>        <br/>    What is wrong with people?  <br> Tier 5 <br> Texnolyze <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br/>      <br><br>That is some pro-tier mod trolling, I love it</br></br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br/>  <br><br> mfw these sensitive crybabies can't do anything about it because social justice is pretty much non existent in Japan  <br><br>To call an anime, tv show, video game, movie, etc. sexist, racist, or problematic is stupid enough to begin with, but there is not a weak female character in Kill la Kill that couldn't hold her own. The ones complaining about sexism are either your run of the mill beta white knights or women and girls triggered that they will never have an ass like Ryuko's.</br></br></br></br>      <br> KO NI CHI ****ING WA </br>  <br>The only one who made me laugh even though I always defend Shinji.</br>  That's just sad  Anon goes to japan.

No one outside of Gundam fandom is even aware it exists and even inside said fandom it's like it's not even there sometimes.</br>  <br>That's cute.</br>      <br> your a otaku <br>This guy better be really fucking good at Japanese</br></br>   more than one hour later <br> this shit hasn't been deleted yet </br>   100+ posts   <br> 129 posts <br>Where the fuck are the mods?<br><br>Also, why the fuck is Kaicho wa Maid-sama even on there?</br></br></br></br>  Holy shit just fucking delete this thread<br><br>Check my goddamn dubs</br></br>  <br>Probably because no rules are being broken except by you, you dolt</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Do you really think you can call those popular when even the majority of /a/ hasn't seen them?</br>      <br>This thread is not anime, therefore it does not belong here. Sorry newfriend, but this is /b/ material.</br>  <br><br><br><br> thread isn't breaking any rules <br> spergs come out of the woodwork to shitpost because they dislike a thread's topic  <br><br>Now that's what I call pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Every single person i know that watches anime on regular basis in irl and the internet has seen it, so yes.</br>  <br>see<br><br><br>Sorry friend not anime!!</br></br></br></br>  <br> being retarded <br>Glad I'm not you.</br></br>  <br>Anime related images are being posted, and if you think these threads are a new phenomena, you are the newfriend.</br>     facebook <br> reddit <br> youtube comments <br><br>What the fuck is going on in here</br></br></br></br>  <br>My post was no worse than any other post in this thread.<br><br><br>Fuck off back to /b/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First day?

This thread is neither so you're gonna need to go.</br>  <br> if you think these threads are a new phenomena, you are the newfriend. <br>The same threads that are posted on /b/ aren't posted on /a/ kid.</br></br>  <br><br> OP image is anime related <br> reasonable assumption to make would be that the OP wanted a YLYL: anime version  <br><br>And you mean to tell me that isn't anime/manga related? Fuck off and read the rules.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Summer.</br>      <br>Nice doubles dude!!<br><br><br>see<br><br><br>Sorry but you gotta go!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because the OP says a couple of words doesn't make the thread related to /b/ ylyl threads, but good job being retarded.</br>  <br>&lt;It's /b/ material<br> /b/ deletes it </br></br>  <br/>  <br>Facebook posts and other people's opinions are not anime.</br>  <br> thinking that the only rules are the written ones </br>  <br>/a/ sometimes has metathreads.<br>The OP of this thread posted shit but he's probably long gone, please don't make this thread even worse than it currently is.</br></br>  <br><br>Might as well banepost at this rate</br></br>  YLYL threads not allowed<br><br>Sage</br></br>  <br>Point me to the rule that says anime and manga related doesn't cut it, please</br>  And to think an anon told me summer was just a myth.<br><br>Wow.</br></br>  Elves are for  Precure thread   Today is a good day.   armpits <br> thighs <br> navels <br> now shoulder blades <br><br>Has Precure gone too far?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GoPlebs </br>  <br><br>Oh man<br><br>can you imagine an Ainu Precure? <br><br>I'm amazed they didn't already think of one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     yuri <br> precure </br>  Can someone explain the point of this scene? I honestly don't get it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FKP<wbr>YbviBWZE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> he said Rei fans are sadistic (as opposed to the Asuka fan's masochism <br><br>Actually, he supposed Asuka fan's are masochistic only because Rei's fan's are sadistic. He never asserts Asuka's fans of this as fact, unlike Rei's.<br><br> Now you're coming up with just angry retorts. <br>No, Anno forgot to include Rei. I prefer you like Rei, I like Asuka.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka fans go on about how everything's a jab at Rei fans <br>When has that ever happened? It's Rei fans with their persecution complex that see the Rebuilds as some elaborate vendetta against the girl they hold dear. When it's a shit character study in general due to it's time limitations and other stupid decisions.<br><br>And how is it obvious? Can you answer this? </br></br></br></br>  Asuka fan's being the better  <br> Now maybe as a result of aggressive merchandising and pandering <br>Not true. Ever since '96 Kawoshin was always the most popular Eva ship, with the most doujinshi/merchandise covering it. Remember that Comiket started out as a fujoshi con, and still mostly was one in the 90s.<br>Regardless, Rei always had more merchandise and doujinshi than Asuka; she was always the one being the most fetishized of the two with the most otaku clammering after her. There's official statements stated by Anno and Ikuhara confirming this.</br></br></br>  <br> the only obvious jab in the entire franchise </br>  What's the saddest moment in anime?  <br>You can hide them.</br>  <br>Like I said up here <br>Her death really was a punch in the gut for anyone that was expecting any sort of good ending for the series</br></br>    <br>Happy Pino please?</br>  <br>The entirety of Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever watched.</br>  How does /a/ feel about feet?  <br>Is this a fetish show?</br>  <br><br>Her left foot looks awful here.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>This man is right. Footfags are no better than furries, and we are better off without them.<br> Also, Lelouche is a footfag. I'm surprised no one here's calling blood against them when the worst tripfag here is one of them. </br></br>  <br> the worst tripfag here <br>That's not Bear.</br></br>    rape hentai. shrek, donkey, and farquat journey to the castle, rape the forest nymphs along the way, and then rape the princess in the finale.     GOOSH GOOSH   <br>and then he would relax in the swamp</br>  If dubs, this is my swamp.  Hibike Euphonium Season 2 Confirmed<br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/655<wbr>17</wbr></br></br>  Continues to ship Yuuko/Natsuki and Mizore/Nozomi as this pointless argument proceeds.  <br>Yeah, the point of that scene was definitely about Reina planning to kill Kumiko if she was interested in Taki, nothing to do with Kumiko giving an initially out-of-character response about her crush that she then changes to something more like her.</br>    <br>This is not an "I was not expecting that answer" face.</br>  <br> wanting to improve yourself for your crush <br> this is clearly obsession </br></br></blockquote>]
