[ More detail summary for Saekano Vol 8 -- https://magnavalon.wordpress.com/20<wbr>15/07/20/saekano-volume-8-a-new-beg<wbr>inning/<br>Let's start WaifuFag war</br></wbr></wbr>  Megumi a shit.  <br>Really? Any proof to call her 'shit' ?</br>  Eriri a shit.  <br>Well it depends on your perspective who is shit anon-san</br>  <br><br>Eriri is the last boss.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and I hope Boring-chan win when she meet last boss</br>  <br>Do you mean Utaha will crush both of them?</br>  Utaha a shit.  <br><br>Utaha is only a side character now.</br></br>  <br>Character got MC's first kiss, is not side character</br>  <br><br>That was her last act before being doomed to irrelevancy. Read volume 8.</br></br>  Let's do this again. Prove that Megumi is not the best girl. <br><br>Hint:  you can't </br></br>  <br> “…..Yes, it’s alright, Senpai. I will make you forget that woman’s words.” <br> “Sawamura-senpai is the worst… Abandoning Tomoya-senpai like that… She deserves a death penalty.” <br> “A proper punishment is necessary… And so this time, I, Izumi Hashima, shall destroy Eriri Spencer Sawamura… Eri Kashiwagi.” <br> “Nope, everyone who stands in Senpai’s way is my enemy.” <br><br>Based Izumi. REMOVE ERIRI.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  10/10 main heroine    <br>Megumi a shit.</br>  Reminder that Megumi has no romantic feelings for Tomoya. <br>Reminder that the author favors girls who share a past with the MC.</br>  When does the anime stop at ?  <br> Eriri* a shit <br><br>Fix'd for truth.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 4.</br>  <br> still saying this after everything that has happened in volume 7 and 8 </br>  <br>Izumi a besto.</br>  <br>Reminder Megumi is his attempt to redo Setsuna.</br>  <br><br>They are nothing alike. From what I remember Setsuna was super manipulative.</br></br>  <br><br>Setsuna was a bitch.</br></br>   “…….Sorry Aki-kun, this game is shit after all. Can I give up?” <br><br>my sides</br></br>  Why is Shinji considered a "pussy whining faggot who can't do anything" when Asuka is far more annoying than him? I went into this show expecting him to be insufferable but the character bitching and moaning all the time is the red-head. Fuck she isn't even all that good a pilot for all the shitalking she does. Does she get likable after character development or remain this one note bitch?  I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities for me to find them relatable. Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, and Rei are all so exaggerated or poorly-rounded that I don't give a shit about them or their problems.  All Eva characters  besides one  have been deliberately designed to be unappealing with very obvious irredeemable flaws.<br>You're retarded if you consider any of them your waifu.</br>  Because Asuka is a girl so she's acting as she's supposed to while Shinji is a guy so he must be tough and put that tsundere bitch back to her place  <br> I find a lot of the characters to lack a sufficient amount of human qualities <br>Full retard.</br></br>  <br>Why does it always have to be either being obsessed with the characters or hating them?<br><br>Most Eva's characters are actually very nice. Yes, even Asuka. They all have good and bad moments.<br>It's only that, as the series progresses towards the end, the bad ones become more apparent, but this is also very much because of the situation they're in.<br><br>The fights become harder and have a more psychological impact, especially on the pilots. Towards the end, everyone is on edge and too busy with himself and his own problems, which is why (I think) so many finish the show thinking they are all horrible people.<br><br>But really, if you think Shinji or Asuka is either 100% bitch or 100% nice, then you didn't pay any attention to the show. They have their bad moments and some good ones, just like real people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop making sense, you're derailing a potential asuka rei kaworu waifu war thread.</br>  <br> lack a sufficient amount <br> this means 100% </br></br>  <br>This. I am very baffled by people who can find them likable or sympathetic.</br>  <br> lack a sufficient amount <br> for me to find them relatable <br> Shinji, Asuka, Misato, Gendo, Ritsuko, and Rei are all so exaggerated or poorly-rounded that I don't give a shit about them or their problems. <br><br>He said they were exaggerated. How?<br>Just because their each characters' actions originate from mostly one character trait (Shinji = Avoidant; Asuka = Narcisstic; etc.) doesn't mean they're too exaggerated to be relatable.<br><br>Since this thread is aimed at Asuka I will point out some nice things she did:<br>-Finding a place to eat that takes Rei's veganism and Misato's low budget into consideration.<br>-Admiring Shinji's ability to play the cello<br>-Her concern for Shinji in the hospital (which she tried to hide)<br><br>These are some very minor and mostly superficial elements, but they still show that Asuka tries to be nice once in a while.<br><br> But he said "for me"! It's all relative and it's just his opinion! <br>Yes, and this is mine. While watching the show I found enough reason to see why people like Asuka. You don't have to share the same problems as a character to find them relatable and given Asuka's history, I found her character very realstic and relatable and I saw "a sufficient amount of human qualities".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, and this is mine. <br>Cool. Then we both have our impressions of the show that work for us.</br></br>  <br>The thing is, if all it takes to avoid having others criticize your opinion is to write<br> well, duh that's just my opinion, you can have yours. <br>Then there is no point in ever posting here, because you don't engage in any discussion, but only post your own opinion and tell people who disagree to fuck off.<br><br>My opinion doesn't have to be right, but if others disagree I try to point out why I have this certain opinion that I do and, thus we engage in discussion.<br>I try to give reason why I have mine and you should give reason why you have yours. Maybe you can convince someone of yours or he can convince you of his, but even if we don't the very least we try to understand the reasons why the other person has his specific opinion.<br><br>Not every discussion has to end in war.<br>But this doesn't mean we shouldn't try to justify the opinions we have. That's why we post here and not on some shitty blog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing is, if all it takes to avoid having others criticize your opinion is to write <br>I'm not avoiding having anyone respond to my post, I just don't have any interest in engaging in a conversation I have had a few times before and has been fruitless each time. I was giving the OP my opinion. You're welcome to give yours and he can judge the merits of each.</br></br>  <br>Nice or not, the baffling part is the fact that Shinji gets all the flack for his flaws while Asuka who is far worse doesn't. At least Shinji does his job well and actively tries to be decent and helpful even though his life sucks.</br>  <br>I guess that makes somewhat sense, but it is still lazy. Reasonably lazy, but lazy nonetheless.<br><br><br>But that's mostly the fans isn't it? I'd say by this point it is basically a fact that girls get less harsh treatment, just because they're girls, which of course isn't how it should be, but unfortunatelly how it is.<br>And yes, Shinji is far more bearable than Asuka.<br><br>If I was a character in the NGE universe, I'd porbably dislike Asuka as a person and be friends with Shinji, but I still think she is a well written character and even someone you can like if you know her circumstances (which you won't, unless you are a spectator who watches the show).<br><br>But since I am not a person within that universe and because I am just a spectator, I can see that Asuka isn't just a bitch. She is bitchy, but also far more than that.<br><br>Don't worry, I don't like the fact that people always shit on Shinji, either, but this doesn't mean I have to like people shitting on Asuka. If people shat on Rei (without justification), I'd probably try to defend her, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Eventually she starts struggling with the fact that she can't be the perfect, sexy EVA pilot that she wants to be and pretty much shuts down because of the realization. She gets fucked up, anon, don't worry.  <br>I liked her because I thought she was funny. I honestly couldn't take anything that came out of her mouth seriously. She was full of shit and I found that entertaining.</br>  <br>Rei gets shat on more than Shinji though.<br><br>There's been like three-four threads this week where she gets shat on, mostly by Kaworu fans and Asuka fans.<br><br>Where were you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reifags shit on other characters the most.</br>  <br>Not that anon but Rei Ayanami was the most popular character since NGE started, Anno even got angry with the audience because he intended to make a creepy child, not a sex doll. Lately her popularity has decreased among the fanbase but she's still the sex fantasy of thousand of geeks around the world.<br><br>Shinji doesn't sell</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously not there. Anon, I can only do so much.</br>  <br>See <br><br><br>You're here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she has fire. He is a wet fart.</br>  <br>But none of them insult Rei.</br>  <br>They do.</br>  <br>It's obviously an attack on Rei if it belittles the character as a mere sex fantasy and claim that it's only point is to be a creepy child.<br><br>IMO you just lost my sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to /a/. People will shit on you're waifu relentlessly here. They do it to everyone. If you don't like that, fuck off.</br>  <br>Not talking to you cockknob.</br>  <br>Reifags to it to other characters all the time.</br>  <br> lying </br>  <br>Who do you think is always starting the bitchfights with Asukfags on how they only like their waifu for fanservice? <br>Give me a fucking break. You do it because of insecurity and jealously, Reifag.<br>You do the same to Kaworufags too.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I've grown up, when I rewatched it, I found that their personalities make a lot more sense than I originally gave them credit for, especially Shinji.<br>I had the unrealistic expectation that as the 'MC' he should rise to any and all occasions. But the reality is that very few people if put in a position that dire would ever stand up to it, especially at the Shinji's age.<br>Same for Asuka and Rei.<br>Though their backgrounds are all very different, they're just kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop shitting on others first then things will improve.</br>  <br>Nah. I've been around /a/ since 2004 and since then as now it's always been Asuka fans that are the most belligerent, both passive-aggressively and directly. <br><br>Rei fans usually attack in defense.</br></br></br>  <br>So you admit, Reifags shit on others too.</br>  <br><br>You're the ones that shit on other characters first.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if you're not talking to me or not, my point still stands. People will have different opinions here, yes, some will even hate you're waifu. Don't cry like a baby just because this isn't your persona Reifag tumblr hugbox.</br>  <br><br>see <br><br> Who do you think is always starting the bitchfights with Asukfags on how they only like their waifu for fanservice?  <br><br>That line in particular has been the operating attack from Asuka fans towards Rei fans (and Kaworu fans) since the early 2000's on english-speaking websites.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Playing the innocent victim </br>  <br>Asukafags mostly. Kaworufans too. If we also look at evangelion, they're the characters with the objectively most fanservice, so you don't really have to be a rei fan to call them out.</br>  <br> the objectively most fanservice <br>That would be Misato. <br>And doesn't Rei show up naked the most out of the entire show?</br></br></br>  <br>That's what you just did. Everyone who has been on /a/ for more than a few days know you're the worst, just in the last weeks there's dozens of threads concerning why Rei a shit.<br><br>For those who has been here longer, they'd also know that the above is nothing new.</br></br></br>  Closer and closer to the most perverted Slime, are you ready for Suu? <br><br>Compilation Video:<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14376<wbr>57676</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Part of the fun of Suu's character is seeing her learn and developing her own unique personality. Shes come far from mimicking others</br>  I still want a chapter that shows where she came from. From past works from the author it seems that slimes are wild monster girls, and girl slimes evolve from small slimes.  <br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>post the full thing in the op next time</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>Faggot, I'm the same OP as the previous 2 threads I didn't post that playlist because there os other one with subs but incomplete.</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>So perhaps maybe Suu could accidentally create herself a sister?</br>  <br> she came from space </br>  when do the episodes air, and when do the translations usually come through?  <br>I wonder if her job actually paid her better she wouldn't such a giant work evading and lazy woman. <br><br>When she wants to get shit done she can, but she's usually trying to be the opposite of that.</br></br></br>  <br>Tuesday morning. Subs can usually be found later in the day</br>      So tell me /a/, which girl got the deal design-wise in the anime so far?<br><br>I'd say horsepussy, she looks qt as fuck now.</br></br>  <br>Looks so fucking adorable.</br>  <br>Probably not. Because her lazyness goes outside of her job. As shown by her dirty appartment</br>  <br><br>Bird.<br><br>Horse was already qt as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*got the best deal<br><br>Typing on your phone can be troublesome.</br></br></br>  Is Ms. Smith secretly a monstergirl?  <br>fan theories say shes a succubus</br>  <br>READ<br>THE <br>MANGA<br>FAGGOT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>She's a  semendemon girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. Possibly. Probably. Yes.</br>  <br>Only a theory so far.</br>  <br><br>It's no secret man is the greatest monster of them all.</br></br>  <br>Yes, the worst monster of all.<br>A Human.<br>Subspecies: Asian</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't that Doppel giving smith an excuse to be able to torture the pig guy for the whole mess?</br>    <br> You will never love Smith enough to break in an clean her appartment. </br>  <br>It's totally ending with Lala antics.</br>  <br>What ever is in that box I WANt it.</br>  <br>No.Sweetie Witch Mako-chan, obviously.</br>  <br> Cleaned so well that she no longer has a sink. </br>  <br>Cerea was always the qtest of the girls in the manga. But I think Papi's voice is also very cute.</br>  <br>I hope that makes her a bit more popular so she might get more screentime.</br>  <br>and a few cabinets are gone too</br>  <br>Papi's voice is very cute. It sounds so familiar for some reason, but I can't place it.</br>    <br>Ari Ozawa?Does the name tell you something?</br>   next episode has best girl introduction <br><br>hell yes</br></br>    <br>Episode 5 should be hype.<br>Suu Rape, Mero and Mon debut.</br></br>  Anyone have the YT link for the shorts w/ sub titles?  I know I'm late but what the fuck, CR?  <br>Wouldn't be surprised if MON was rearranged. Even in the manga, it's positioning was strange.</br>  Suu a sweetheart.  <br> At what point did you began to consider that Suu wants to make the harem end reality so that everyone can remain happily together? </br>  <br>Fool! The slime only wants two things. That is 1. RAPE and 2. Fluid.</br>  <br>Suu and Papi are sweethearts who value friendship over everything else.<br><br> Miia is a slut who has no interest in anything but MC dick. </br></br></br>  <br>So Papi's bird legs in an artistic manner also are supposed to be like stockings?</br>  Is it just me or does Rachnee never get much "screentime" she's always in the background, never the focus  <br> Miia is a slut <br>I know this combination of words trigger some Miia-fags<br> Don't start shit now </br></br></br>  <br>Just as Rachnee is a good mom</br>    <br> that spoiler  <br>Son last night was one of the worse threads I've seen in a long time. Lets not wake all the hate up again.</br></br>  <br>It reflects her personality.</br>  <br>Such is the fate of best girl</br>  <br>Well she's not wrong.</br>  <br>And Rachnee's legs with it's deep black color are like black leather pants fitting towards that white top or the black bra like clothing.</br>  <br>And then she was raped</br>  <br>Her time will come, for she is destined to win</br>    <br>At least we got that nice coffee chapter.</br>  <br>why are you posting two pokemons? </br>        <br>Hey, Polt!<br> Let's go for a walk. </br></br>  <br/>    <br><br/></br>    If I say that it's not the fur, nose, tail and ears that got me on Polt, but her great ASS  personality, will anyone believe me?  cerea probably smells so bad and shits everywhere. disgusting  <br><br>I like to believe these aren't edits.</br></br>  <br>LIKE A BARN</br>    <br> cloaca snake </br>  <br>No...</br>  <br>Nah.She takes frequent baths.</br>  <br><br> STILL having no idea how horse asses work </br></br>  <br><br>Do we have to go through this ever thread? Do you want that guy to post IT. Come on.</br></br>  <br>There was an entire thread and a half dedicated to the structure and biology of horse anuses.<br><br>They are actually marvels of evolution that keep the horse rather clean.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to feed some carrots to Cerea.</br>  <br>You mean worse than usual?</br>  <br>I just want Smith is shoot me full of tranquillzers and takes advantage of me while im strung out.

Guess people are picking up or at least following the magazines more. <br><br>I usually don't bother checking until the third volume though.</br></br></br></br></br>   No sales <br>Guess who's getting sold off in marriage!</br>  <br> Loli/Shota <br> not /ss/ <br><br>C'mon anon, use your imagination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aoi?</br>  <br>Translation?</br>  Is MPT better than HorribleSubs or is also shit?<br> I know HS is cancer from Funi and CR, just want to know if I should download MPT instead of HS. </br>  <br> Alvin R Zero </br>  <br> HS <br>Get doki instead and ignore the epic memers that are complaining about doki and want people to use funishit</br></br>  <br> use your imagination <br> implying /ss/ is using your imagination. <br>There is something about loli and shota sex that makes my kokoro go doki doki, /ss/ is small time compared to that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it's shit, better wait for doki</br>  <br><br>What's wrong with MPT then?</br></br>  I feel sad for her...  <br>For a moment there I thought Haruka was asking Akane for a date and Shuu intervened and has a sibling spat. Then I realize that's not Haruka but another prince</br>    How can Aoi be so cool?  Don't cheat on your gf shoe  <br>no problem</br>  <br>That is some respectable taste, but I was more going for the role reversal angle that she makes herself more mature while you get smaller.</br>  Superman has nightmares about his strength going out of control and hurting everyone<br>Akane has real life experience with her powers going out of control and showing her embarrassing side to the public<br>Therefore Akane &gt; Superman</br></br>  <br>MPT seems okay but they took the fonts and everything from doki, the only original thing they do is the TL.<br><br>If you cant wait and must have it now then I guess you could watch MPT but if you want something better and can wait for mondays every week then wait for doki.</br></br></br>  <br>Wonder what would happen if she did go berserk</br>  <br>WHAT'S NEXT PAGE DUDE</br>  <br>Is that in one of the tanks, or is it not published yet?</br>    <br>The translation is the most important part, I guess he just wanted it to look relatively nice and has no skill in it himself, same as encoding</br>  <br>I think it's the newly released Volume 3?</br>  <br>Volume 3 isn't out until around this time next month though.</br>  <br>But i'm a little girl, she can't turn me into a boy.</br>  <br>That's vol 2. Volume 3 will have the Shuu/Kanade/Akane flashback that we only have magazine scans for at the moment.

She's never sure if people befriends her on their own will or she Geassed them into befriending them without her own knowing. <br><br>At here Aoi seemed to believe her siblings actually likes her (rather than being Geassed into liking her), and gave out some sentimental tears.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128558499 <br>Everyone.</br>  <br> Heart pupils <br>lewd</br></br>  Literally perfect  <br>Still mad as fuck that they give the view to minor character but not to me.</br>  <br>Chapter 2 was hers. I think the anime skipped it due to the heavy incest hinting.</br>  <br>The anime isn't really going through in chronological order. The episode with loli Akane were chapters 2 and 7 and this week's episode were from ch. 12 and 6.<br><br>It seems they like to pair up chapters with recurring characters like Hana, loli Akane or the fan club president.</br></br></br>  <br>Should be animated in Ep 5C.</br>  <br>Oops, didn't watch the preview sorry.<br>So I guess next episode will be mostly Haruka and Misaki's.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think it is just pairing up the chapters so they flow a bit better. In the manga it jumps around between people a lot so I guess this just groups them up so that each one gets a decent amount. <br><br>What's the chapters/titles of the next episode? The one with Haruka explaining his shitposting of Akane online and what else?</br></br></br>  <br>Aoi episode when?</br>  Holy shit, that deleted post.  <br>Sounds about right, also looks like we'll get to see the 'beach' episode  and akane's reaction to being filmed in her swimsuit <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Which one, there were loads that went</br>  <br>Until she said it's underwear, I thought maybe Akane went commando.<br>Fuck it, I am just gonna assume that Akane did and her dyke friend lied.</br></br>  <br> 'beach' episode </br>    <br>Thanks, now I remember. Eight Misakis is a good one if I am remembering the right chapter. Gives you a good idea of what she actually wants and shit.<br><br><br>Probably someone samefagging and having all his posts removed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pic related. I thought it was a thread derailment, so it was just a same person samefagging, after all.</br>  <br>Ah, I saw them go but wasn't sure which one in particular you meant</br>  Thread about humble poet like me?<br><br>Thank you /a/.</br></br>  <br>That would be the bank robbery if i remembered correctly. Not sure when the anime's gonna show it.</br>  <br>No, department store hostage-taking and robbery.</br>  <br>And it'll probably include the one about her second power too. It'll come eventually I guess.<br><br>I wonder if any of the others will find any second powers at some point.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if it just has something to do with them maturing, because Kanade  didn't used to be able to materialise something when she didn't have enough money for it, now it just takes material from things she's already made  so Kanade or Shuu would probably be next in line for secondary powers</br>  <br>Kill yourself faggot.</br>  <br>She probably materialised it, symbolic of her mental erection</br>  <br>Yeah, it's just that happened a long time ago. Same with when Aoi found out hers. So it might just be too late, or maybe their one power will just get better.</br>  <br>Maybe maturing as in using the powers a lot, so for Akane applying gravity manipulation on something particularly large, Shuu trying to go to the moon, or shit like that.</br>  <br>That's got me thinking about how Shuu's power actually works. Whether he just imagines a place and it puts him in a safe location of if he has to gauge the distance in any way. Since he knows all these islands I'd guess distance, but then being able to teleport directly into his seat is improbable.</br>  <br>Maybe a bit of both? So he can move however far in whichever direction along the surface of the earth, and if he knows the place well enough, teleport exactly there</br>  It's a good thing this is a light and happy 4koma, because imagine Teru getting into a schoolyard scuffle with his powers on the fritz  <br>What kind of an idiot would fight a prince with superpowers?</br>  <br>An angry six year old</br>  <br>I would.</br>    That stupid cat was the best part of the episode.  <br>Cats smart as fuck, he knows what chest is best</br>  <br>Indeed, a cat that can appreciate DFC is a cat welcome in my house.</br>    Powers that each of the voice actors want, from here: http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/dande/sp<wbr>ecial/interview01.html<br><br><br>Akane: I'm doing muscle training to improve my stamina, if I could get rid of the muscle pain, that would be the best... I'd like that kind of power.<br><br>Aoi: There are lots of things I can think of, but being able to just open a door to wherever you want to go is definitely the best! It's economical too.<br><br>Shuu: I'd like to teleport the most. It'd make the commute easy and I'd be able to travel cheap.<br><br>Kanade: I'd like Shuu-chan's teleportation. Being able to move around in an instant would really cut down on wasted time, I'm so jealous!<br><br>Haruka: Whilst I was thinking about what power would be best, it'd definitely be lots of next, I could predict whether it would rain with a smug face.<br><br>Misaki: Misaki-chan's cloning would be good. It'd be convenient when you're busy, but deciding who does what would cause a fight every time.<br><br>Hikari: I'd like to be able to be invisible. I could surprise everyone!<br><br>Teru: Teleportation like Shuu! I'd like to travel the world and it would save me when I oversleep.<br><br>Shiori: An ability that let you materialise what you wanted. It'd be useful for surprising people too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Law of the anime</br>  <br>Nobody wants Aoi's power? They're all thinking too small-scale. Or maybe they just didn't want to spoil anything.</br>  <br>He wouldn't use his powers unless his sister was in danger. The contract prevents him from unleashing Jackal for such trivial matters.</br>  <br><br> randomly lose control of our powers </br></br>  <br>What do you think that seal on his hand is for?</br>    <br>He's already been shown to be bad at regulating his power anyway (see pulling bits of the building he climbed) so even if the seal was to help with that, he may well still accidentally use them</br>  Why doesn't Borscht sleep on Shiori's chest too? Is her slope also bigger than Akane's?  <br>She doesn't have a slope at all yet</br>  <br>That shitty fanart. Didn't do justice to me at all. Why did they let minor character to get a view, while I got no view at all?<br><br>Still fucking mad.</br></br></br>  Y/N?  <br>y</br>  <br>N</br>  <br>M?</br>   most /fa/ among other siblings <br> cutest school uniform <br> perfect ability for waifuing <br>Vote for Misaki</br></br></br>  <br>Aoi power is only good when you a ant to rule over something.

Most useful for mundane everyday life.</br></br>  <br>She's afraid of strangers in the first place, and since the cameras mean she'd be seen by strangers...</br>  <br>ah ok</br>  <br>Maybe she associates "camera" with niggers</br>  <br>you could have at least removed the white from between her legs</br>  <br>Really it's just the head and face which are off</br>  <br>Who isn't afraid of cameras?</br>  <br>It's good, but all the time saved would just mean more time spent on here</br>  Borscht is a god among cats, I also want to rest my head on Akane's gentle slope.        <br> This warrants further investigation. </br>  Peek from below.<br>Peek from below.<br>Peek from below.</br></br>  <br><br><br>mfw laughing at the fags who said there was no yuri in this</br></br></br>  <br>There wasn't even subtext, but whatever floats your boat m8</br>  <br> girl get nosebleed by seeing akane <br> not gay <br><br>k m8</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please go back to wherever you came from</br></br>      <br><br>totally not gay!!</br></br>            <br>Akane's face here looks comfy as fuck.</br>  Jojolion 45 photo raws:<br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/390490144<wbr>1?fr=frs</wbr> <br>Text translation<br> https://mangahelpers.com/t/kewl021<wbr>0/releases/41553</wbr> <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>The twins came to Morioh to use the wall eyes to merge, discuss.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Blue haired Koichi or blonde Koichi, which do you prefer?    <br>Thats just the parts Joseph has been in, still good tho</br>    <br>I want to fuck smokey.</br>   GA <br> GA GA GA <br> GA <br> GA GA GA <br> GATCHAMAAA~AAAN  thread<br>Episode 4 "2:6:2" aka "The Episode Where Shit Gets Realer Than Real" in ~10 hours</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They already spoil what happens in the episode summary.<br><br>Tsubasa becomes some national hero because she protected everyone's favorite fap fodder and Crowd dispenser. <br><br>Flame of Life = apparently Rui?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lay off the space weed.</br>  Tsubasa x Rui confirmed.  <br>Joe looks so much better when he's not in his garbage man outfit.</br>  <br>I'll punch my screen if that couple does happen.

Starts at 3:00/27:00 JST.  <br>They could just record that line and save some budget for all those shiny transformations</br>  <br> Tumblr. </br>  <br>Yes, yes, but before that?</br>  <br>That's a bit creepy. They were inserting references of things that were going to happen two years later that happened to be when the sequel aired.</br>  <br>Ask them, they were the ones that found the image.</br>  <br>Eh, too lazy.</br>  <br>Hey, Joe makes the garbage man outfit look good.</br>  <br>Stop being lazy.<br> http://tsubasamisudachi.tumblr.com/<wbr>ask</wbr> </br></br>  <br>T-too shy!</br>  GERURURURU  <br>He'll go to jail like Umeda.</br>  <br>They will be. But won't happen until episode 7.</br>  remember when Sugane was relevant? yeah me neither  <br>Most Gatchaman got their development in season 1 except for Hajime, so she's getting some this season. The only reason why Rui still features and gets fleshed out it's because he's the main heroine of the show.</br>  <br>It's over anon, Hajime, Tsubasa and Rui are the only Gatchaman with any relevance anymore.</br>  <br>Sugane will gain relevance again if he wears a dress and a wig.</br>  I'm sure there is a reason they decided to introduce a new character instead of focusing on the ones they already had  <br>It's Tiger &amp; Bunny all over again, great cast but they tend to focus on less interesting characters. But i'll take Hajime/Gel over Barnaby any day.</br>  <br>More yuri potential with Hajime is the only answer I can think of.</br>    <br>But Hajime is asexual anyway. Or aliensexual at most.</br>  <br>She likes stationary.</br>  <br> likes </br>  <br>You get my point.</br>  Are we sure it's delayed by one hour? I can't moon, but the official twitter didn't say anything about that  <br>She thinks Rui is handsome I haven't heard her talk about finding other characters attractive before</br>    <br>At least Tsubasa isn't annoying. I wish I could say the same for Gel though. I still might drop it if I don't get my fix of OD and Utsutsu</br>  <br><br>https://twitter.com/GATCHAMANCrowds<wbr>/status/624848994166910976<br> 本日は日本テレビにて27時よりと遅めの放送開始となります。 <br> 27時 <br><br>http://www.ntv.co.jp/program/detail<wbr>/21842309.html<br> 07月26日（日）3:00～3:30 <br> 3:00 </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>aaah, thank you, I was looking for a 26:55/ 27:00.<br>Saving the second link for the future!</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa <br> not annoying as fuck </br></br>  <br> Thought this was going to be a Gaogaigar thread </br>  <br>She thinks rui's beautiful and cute. She calls Utsutsu kawaii and wants to 'date' Katze.</br>  <br>Give her time to grow on you, most people didn't get Hajime at first either</br>  <br>I still don't like Hajime. At least Tsubasa fucks up. Hajime is never wrong about anything. Just let Berg take over her body or something, the show would improve tenfold.</br>  <br>Well the show seems to be setting up something terrible with Hajime.</br>  <br>No problem! If you go to http://www.ntv.co.jp/program/ by default it takes you to the current airing program and highlights it, but if you ctrl+F ガッチャマン クラウズ インサイト, you will always be able to find the current week's episode time slot. Confirm the date by looking at the top of the column (07/25). This only applies to broadcasts on Nippon TV.</br>  <br>I miss seeing Katse strut and prance around.</br>  <br>Thanks! Since you are so nice, do you know why the stream makes it look like it will air at 24:00? <br>I figured it out as I was typing, is it chinese time?</br></br>  <br>*24:57</br>  <br>It's obvious something will happen with Hajime and Berg Katze</br>  <br>One can only hope for some form of mind grape as Hajime enters an existential crisis questioning her own identity</br>  <br>I-I'm not nice. Yeah, I think it's Chinese/the streamer's time. If I recall correctly, China's timezone is the same as Japan's minus one hour (Japan 25:55 = China 24:55) and there's always lag when streaming, so that might explain the 2 minute difference. I'm not really sure, though.</br>  <br>I dunno, for a psychopathic murderous alien Katze seems relatively alright with her. I'm expecting something else to go horribly wrong first, like Hajime being seriously wrong for the first time.</br>  <br>That'd probably be too much to hope for. I doubt either Rui or Hajime will be seriously wrong this season.</br>  Any significant improvements in the BDs?<br> cthuko BDs when </br>  <br> Any significant improvements in the BDs? <br>No, there are touches here and there but nothing major.</br></br>  <br> cthuko BD <br>Isn't the AnimeNOW release done with cthuko's subs?</br></br>  Doyu or somewhere else?  <br>It is.</br>  <br>In a few years I'm sure they'll do the BDs.</br>  <br>What's the problem then?</br>  Did the streamer forgot?  <br>None, and I'm not that anon.</br>  <br> Stream <br>Where?</br></br>  Started.  FUCK<br><br>ALT STREAM WHERE</br></br>   stay up for stream <br> chink changed channel <br><br>might as well wait for HS</br></br></br>    So, no stream today?    <br>Pretty sure you don't remember shit then.</br>  <br> be serious med student studying for very important exam <br> schedule time off to eat and watch Gatchaman at the same time <br> wrong stream <br>This is exactly the kind of shit that pushes people to stab notes</br></br></br></br>    <br>I feel you, I really do. You should study for another hour or two and take a break later when the subs are out, the episode is already halfway through.</br>    <br>I like Utsutsu but that hand of life thing takes out any drama this show could have.</br>  <br>It's not Dragon Ball reviving everyone levels of bad yet.</br>  <br>Doesn't it shorten her own life span though?</br>  <br>I think so. It looks like she needed help, too.<br><br>It might be a little late for the warning but don't click the pictures if you don't want to be spoiled.</br></br></br>      <br>Supposedly using that and cloning herself both hurt her. But she does both all the damn time with no real consequences.</br>  <br>I thought those thumbnails with yotsuba were here to hide porn and jokes.</br>  <br><br>I think she can transfer life energy or something. She can use her own battery or someone else's, but it can't come from nowhere. If she pulls too hard on her own battery, she'll die.</br></br>  <br>That too.</br>  It's happening.  According to the comments the voice changed as well.   <br>Sugita</br>  <br>What is happening exactly? She's unlolying herslef? That's terrible. She's clearly evil.</br>  <br>Seriously? Oh man.</br>  <br>Was getting caught part of his plan?</br>  <br><br>Fucking finally.</br></br>  <br> she <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br><br><br>I FUCKING TOLD YOU FAGGOTS IT WAS A MAN</br></br></br>   best episode of the season <br> NO STREAM <br><br>fucking chinks</br></br></br>  <br>That's it, I riot.<br><br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br>  <br><br> mfw first straight alien </br></br>  <br><br>Your tears are delicious</br></br>  So ikemen it crashed my browser.

Terrible taste in wigs.</br></br></br>  <br> loli <br><br>anon I...</br></br></br>  <br>We were all fooled.<br> Except for that one Anon who's been screaming "it's a dude!!!" in every thread </br></br>  <br>So is confirmed male?<br><br>Lolifags BTFO</br></br></br>  <br> Terrible taste in wigs. <br>I like them.</br></br>  Hajime is a dude too.  <br>Because the character designer has a god tier fetish.</br>  <br>what if sugane is a dude too</br>  <br>We need some female characters, anon. Some. <br>Don't take Sugane away from us.</br></br>  <br>Dear god, those heeels.</br>   another trap hanakana character   <br>The adult form Gelsadra changed into for the sake of running for the Prime Minister elections. However on the inside nothing changed, to Tsubasa he's still as pure as a child.</br>  How can one gook toon be so gay  <br>Call the cops, he don't give a fuck.</br>  <br>Damn it, you made me laugh.</br>  I want to see sugita go Gerururururu  <br>Don't tell he/she is a genderbender...</br>  <br> Gelsadra <br> gay <br><br>He is the first heterosexual alien m8</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>See </br></br>  <br>poor ginoza</br>  <br>Oh...OK, thanks.</br>  ost when  <br>It's cool bro, Utsutsu functions as like, six female characters at any given time</br>  <br>Does S2 even have new songs? A lot of it is just shit from S1.</br>  Will they change the opening next episode in the parts where young gelsadra appears?  So did Tsubaka fuck up as badly as anons predicted last week or does the public trust them more after seeing Bane do what he did.  <br>I'm surprised they didn't already given that you got to see each Gatcha's transformed version in the OP the episode they were going to henshin</br>  <br>One of the greatest scientific discovery of the century!</br>  Looks like Rizumin surrendered after Tsubasa and Gel started kicking the red crowds around saying that he already accomplished what he went there for.  <br>It looks like everything is smiles and rainbows. The plot is going nowhere.</br>  <br>Who cares about that, Gelulu being a dude voiced by sugita is the most important thing right now.<br><br>Just like in the first season!</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the song where Tsubasa climbs up the building is new</br>  Next episode better be about Rhythm's life as a prison bitch.  <br>Remix when? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wO_<wbr>sId4JOAg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>wrong, CR subs and Cthuko TS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So is he going to rot in jail now? I don't know how Japan's penal system works but attempted murder on live television really can't be argued against. I mean it's not like he can claim self defense.</br>  <br>He's going to get busted out in two episodes anyway. Mark my words.</br>  <br>If the red crowds are really /b/ they shouldn't give a fuck about Bane anymore as they still have their powers.</br>  Why didn't Hajime ride senpai's senpai yet?<br>Are gatchamans supposed to be pure, or is she gay?</br>  <br>If they were /b/ they'd terrorize the public by spamming gore and CP on national TV and billboards, while mass ordering pizza to every government official</br>  BAKED/DEADFISH OR COMMIE WHEN  <br> inb4 Rizu's true goal was to force Gel into "time to turn everyone into tang' mode. </br>  Tsubasa: Rui-senpai, everything is going to be fine! We caught VAPE's leader<br>Rui: Why did you get in my way? I told you not to<br>Rui passes out<br>Tsubasa: I saved you and you say I got in the way...? Why would you say that<br>Hajime hums away</br></br></br></br>  This was really funny and anticlimactic.   Geruru is a boy <br><br>This changes nothing.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT, SERIOUSLY.<br>FUCK THIS SHOW.

You can't say we didn't warn you.</br>  Is it "Insight" or "In Sight"? There's no connection between the n and the s in the eyecatch.  Hajime says sometimes there's things more important than someone's life and Tsubasa says Hajime is a cold person for not caring about Rui's physical suffering.  I'd vote for Gelsadra but only when he's a little girl.  <br>Probably in sight because the crowds are now visible without amnesia effect?</br>  <br>I NEED MORE PONYTAIL UTSUTSU</br>   commie has won   Next episode: halo effect  That episode, holy shit.<br> the music during the fighting scene at the beginning <br> Rui being an edgelord <br> Hajime being a genki edgelord <br> Tsubasa being a SJW <br> Gelsadra being a boy and running for PM </br></br></br></br></br>  So will Tsubasa still let him sleep in the same room as her?  <br>ワロス</br>   Leave it to Sadra!    Gel ruined. <br> Millione host is being a sneaky fuck and hating based OD. <br> Berg Katze still being based as ever. <br>Gel getting PM will actually be hilarious to watch unfold.</br></br></br>  Hajime has been hanging out with Berg Katze too much. He's a bad influence.   tfw no more GERURURURRUU in a cute voice   <br>That's the least major problem.<br><br>The real one is Gel candidating to become the prime minister...</br></br></br>  <br>More like him becoming a walking catastrophe, because my gut instinct is telling me that it will end badly.</br>   Character is voiced by HanaKana AND Sugita <br>Gatchaman continues being based as fuck</br>  <br><br><br> tfw GERURURURRUU in a Sugita voice </br></br></br>  Hajime is the main reason i even watch this, seriously there's something so deliciously wrong with her.<br><br> Hosts a ancient evil alien in her boobs <br> Mind-reading alien can't properly read her <br> Says some deep shit about conflict without batting an eye </br></br></br></br>  <br> Sugita and Hanazawa in the same recording room <br><br>Sugita must be having the time of his life right now.</br></br></br>  Oh boy, this show is going to be a never stopping ride.  IT'S A BOY?????  Katze always find the right words.  <br>Sure, why not? D is the new V</br>  <br>I hope he manages to escape Hajime's bust.</br>  Hajime's suit has panties. Did we know this?  <br>Is an alien, it could be many things. So many things.</br>  <br> That Inuboku event <br>Sugita was really creepy in that video.</br></br>  Why is Hajime so smart and the others a bunch of idiots?  Hajime is so based.  Please shut up, Joe-san.  <br>Yea, what a tremendous faggot. He was annoying in the first season too.</br>  <br>Everything he said is right though.</br>   inb4 Hajime is a guy too   HOLY FUCK<br>Hajime asking ALL the hard hitting questions.<br>Tsubasa BTFO</br></br>  Why wouldn't people want to vote for that PM guy again? The guy is about as uncorrupted as you can get for a PM who actually put citizens first  <br>Will he ever get to fire bird-missiles?</br>  <br><br> Sugita <br> brown boy <br>And nothing of value was lost and something of value was gained.<br><br><br>Best girl indeed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but HEROES and LIFE <br>Goddammit. Just fucking listen to Hajime, you fucks. She clearly is the only member of the team to actually think shit through.</br></br>  <br> brown <br>Are you color blind?</br></br>  <br>Literally nothing he said was right. Even excluding his wrong wrong fucking myopic views about the crowds (they might be more dangerous than cars, but they are also a lot more useful. In fact, if a car is speeding your way you are done for, if someone is trying to kill you with crowds you can use your own fucking crowds), at least wait for your team mate to come out of a coma before you start praising the guy who put him in one. Jesus.</br>  <br>You're giving the general populace way too much credit. Most people are stupid and it's even worse in this situation because literally anyone can vote even fucking kids.</br>  <br>Who in their right mind would do something so foolish?</br>  Why is Karen the best girl to ever exist?  <br><br>Karen is a fine choice but I'd raise you one Kuzehashi-sensei</br></br>  <br>But sensei doesn't have this young form or beautiful blonde hair</br>    Why is Karen so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br>Karen is 2nd best. Period. End of story.</br>        <br>...that's it.</br>    Karen eats ass.

It's not GSC store exclusive I hope.  All these great figures and new nendos, but no decent new animu related figmas. Come on wonfest, you're killing me here!  What's everyones preorders?  <br>go fuck yourself with this bullshit again</br>  <br>Same as last thread.</br>  <br>Wait for it to really start.</br>  In this time before wonfes, i'd like to make a question for all buyfags.<br><br>What is your dream figure that will NEVER get made? And i'm not talking "anything my waifu", i'm talking about a very specific figure based on a illustration or moment from a show that you are 100% sure will never be made, but you'd buy it instantly if it was. As an example, for me it would be a figure based on this illustration.</br></br>  <br>Go fuck yourself.</br>  Hopefully we'll get a painted huke Saber Alter.  <br>I'd be surprised if we didn't to be honest</br>  I Hope there's MonMusu stuff  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> print this out on all the computers in a computer lab back in high school  <br> somehow don't get in trouble </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>This.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> get a boner watching rape and torture shit <br> this made me flaccid <br>thats so fucking disgusting pls kys</br></br></br>  <br>Help me in starting to dislike the mouth too, I don't want to splurge 200 bucks on her but I'm still fine with the crazy face.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128566046 <br> not wanting to watch tama's cute belly get drenched in cum <br>Fag.</br></br>  <br>The only explanation is that one of your school's higher-ups was into scat</br>  <br>Why does this even exist? It looks like shit and it's not relevant to Miku at all, I'm guessing it's based on some dumb illustration.<br><br>Why would you do that when there are tons of worthy Miku modules from the various Project Diva games?<br><br>Retards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your new is showing.</br>  <br>This is actually pretty creative bait, i commend you for the effort</br>  <br> it's not relevant to Miku at all <br><br>You're right.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get it if you don't want to splurge.<br><br> shitposting this early </br></br></br>  <br>Miku is worst girl anyway. More Luka and Rin figures please.</br>  <br>Is this bait? It has to be, I refuse to believe that someone in here could be this retarded.</br>  <br>Newshit please go</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>This brings back memories.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>holy shit I forgot all about this<br><br>man the early 2000s internet was the best. what ever happened to that spirit of fun and laughing at other peoples misfortune?<br><br>I miss the prank pulling 4chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, i want a Figma Black Hanekawa, in the cat PJ's. I REALLY want her in the bra and panties, but that seems too lewd for GSC, even though they've released lewd figma's before.</br></br>  <br> GK <br>Fuck I may as well.</br></br>  <br>That's the problem, I still want to and not even the mouth is making me want her less. The exclusive thing stings but on the other hand it means flat shipping, she's also not going to come out before April and I could safe up the money if I wanted to.<br>I'll have to wait for tomorrow for a few more pictures and if there are more potential pre-orders for next year that would fuck me over money wise.</br></br>  <br>What? I don't watch shit anime like Wixoss and it looks exactly like Miku.</br>  <br>Looks really good from behind but this face is a bit creepy. Hopefully he'll look better painted.</br>  <br>Then I would advice to just get it. Not all figs are perfect. May as well get it, especially if you're a wixoss fan. Unless they announce new figs its pretty much your only choice aside from nendroids and </br>  <br> shit anime like Wixoss <br>Don't be so salty Borutos only getting prize figs.</br></br>  Hey guys; just a quick question from a non-buyfag.<br>You guys do group orders for blind box type things? I really want to order picture related but I only want Kaede and not the others.<br>(source: amiami; around $30 for the set)</br></br>  <br>I'd treat them like TCG sets and just buy the bulk to guarantee kaede, unless otherwise stated or sold individually.</br>  <br>Check mfc.</br>  <br>check the myfigurecollection forum, they have a group buys section.<br><br>alternatively just sell the ones you don't want on ebay, it might take a while to get rid of them but you'll probably end up making a couple bucks in the end.</br></br></br>  Not really my thing but that's a good figure.  Nice.  <br>Is that some sort of harpie? Kinda sexy.</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I've done that before but for a set that I could at least give some of the others away to good homes. I just legitimately only care for her in this set and don't know anyone else that would want the rest (other then /jp but I stray from that place). Maybe the eBay route is the way to go.<br><br>Thanks guys.

That's a pain in the ass, too.</br>  <br> not having multiple figures of your waifu </br>  what do you do with your lewd figures?  <br>Pretty sure I preordered them together as a set from BiJ.</br>  <br><br>Unfortunately and surprisingly, nothing. <br><br>Give me suggestions of how to pose my Queen's Blade Revoltechs guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That Tama face doesn't go with that lewd body</br>  <br>Pose them  on top of a hot plate. </br>  <br>I can always build the cabinet without the doors, or keep the doors open for display. Closed cabinets make it easy to keep my figures safe and relatively free from dust and sunlight while still being easily accessible when its time to  fap vigorously .</br>  <br>Get a detolf dumbass.</br>  <br>This figure. Except good and without the stupid actual-feather wings. It's a garage kit that only one was made of. Even the kit never got released as far as I know.</br>  <br><br>I live in a first world country, we don't own hot plates here</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for the Max Factory one.<br>The face of the FuRyu looks weird</br></br>  <br>Somewhat. My displays have curtains, but nothing is stopping people from moving those.</br>  <br>Easier to draw and people don't mind it.</br>  <br>figures won't fade with as long as their not directly positioned in sunlight, you fucking retard. and regular cabinets don't do anything against dust either, as it would need to airtight. but as someone that faps to figures and then hides them away in a closed cabinet, it's no surprise you're so stupid.</br>  <br>he's talking about multiple cabinets. unless it's saber or miku I find that quite unlikely.</br>  <br>Then put it on the induction plate you elitist cunt.</br>      <br> Get a detolf <br><br> Detolf <br> Width: 16 3/4 " <br> Depth: 14 3/8 " <br> Height: 64 1/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 13 lb <br> $70 <br> have to drive to Ikea to pick up <br><br> Sterilite <br> Width: 25 5/8 " <br> Depth: 18 7/8 " <br> Height: 69 3/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 40 lb <br> $77 <br> free Amazon shipping <br><br>Yeah, I'll take the one with more space/$.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because noses are ugly. and sometimes they have no nose at all in the frontal perspective. praise non-euclidean geometry.</br>    Don't forget to preorder the 2015 figure of the year™!  <br> cabinets don't do anything against dust either <br>That's patently bullshit.<br> how circulation work <br>There is hardly any in a cabinet so little dust is deposited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason for a detolf is that it's a display case. To display them from all sides. With that fancy "glass" stuff instead of dead tree dust.</br>    <br>Why is the word year trademarked?</br>  <br>Truly sufferring</br>    <br> those bellies <br>Jesus fuck</br></br>  <br>Vivid Red<br><br>At this point, there is no hope.</br></br></br>  <br> no miyu </br>  <br>I was it lucky to get it used, but in excellent condition for pretty cheap, so I can't complain. But yeah, the Max Factory one does have a better face and better hair, I'd say.</br>  ARIA finally get a new season, please give me a good quality fig of Akari WF!<br>Or better a good quality of her adult self, PLEASE!</br>  <br>Not him but I cut apart a large box, put foil on the side facing out and put it in the window directly across from my figures. It works well and keeps the heat out. The other window I just put a throw blanket over since it doesn't get direct sunlight and you can't see it from the outside.</br>  So what will you ask for uncle WonFes this year? <br>Personally I hope that figure of Millia from Guilty Gear Xrd by Wing shows up.</br>  <br><br><br>who is this fine and classy lady?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger detected</br></br>  <br>I second this.<br><br>I believe they made Vivid blue and Vivid yellow, so why they didn't made the best one ?</br></br></br>  <br> Akatsuki  <br>YESSS</br></br>  <br>They're just building suspense...</br>  <br>Where is she from? Stockings with those shorts + boots + comfy hoodie makes her adorable</br>  <br>She is from Tokyo Ravens.</br>  Any news or hope of the ooyodo nendo this wonder guys?  <br>I didn't see any teasers of her on the gsc twitter, but there was a taihou nendo teased</br>  <br>I hope it's her, all this lack of info is making me nervous she's not being made.</br>    <br>Hate to reply to a frogposter but I'd die for a good Judeau. Even the GK appears on YA approximately once every ten years.</br>  <br>I want the dragon form of nowi way more than a normal scale of her.</br>  <br>Any Momoiro.</br>  <br>Were you unable to read the English on the cover and google it yourself?<br><br>Are you even able to read my reply? Because it's also in English.</br></br></br>  <br> NEVER <br><br>So, any Square Enix properties that aren't Play Arts Kai shit?<br> Final Fantasy <br> Parasite Eve <br> Drakengard <br> pic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got a spooky girl yesterday. I think she's my favorite Alter witch. I was silly for not pre-ordering her.  What's the word on this Mio?  <br>The English on the cover doesn't say the name of the LN, and your reply didn't say it either.<br>  東京レイブンズ </br></br>  <br>Can't say that makes me sad.<br>Their character designs are fairly bland most of the time.</br></br>  <br><br>The Volks witches are really good. I own all of them. If you're trying to decide between that or the Alter one pick the pose you like the most. They're both great.</br></br>  <br>They make scale figures as well as PAK but the quality is normally mediocre to really bad.</br>  Would anything happen to a figure if it was in a car for a few hours and it's like 80 degrees out? It's in a parking garage though so it's in the shade.  When the fuck does Wonfes begin?  <br>Tomorrow at 6pm.</br>  <br>In 30mins time.</br>  <br>It's 1am in Japan, Jesus anon let them sleep.</br>  I need this  <br>You missed it, it was yesterday.</br>  <br>We are two anon, I want her to join my Sol and my futur Ky</br>  <br>Her face feels off to me</br>  <br>A year from now</br>  <br>Depends on the type of figure anon</br>  <br>She physically suffers from her body.</br>  <br>I'm not a fan of titty monsters but she looks amazing.</br>  <br>She's not a whore though.</br>  <br>I agree with the other anon. I'm really happy with mine.</br>  <br>who knows?</br>  <br>I hate boatshit but I like this titty monster<br><br> Garage Kit <br><br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love her but it took me forever to get the strap on her shoulder</br>  <br>1/2</br>  <br>If they can work 16h a day I'm sure they can hurry up a bit, as well.</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>May the Lord have mercy upon your soul.</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off to mfc if you people want attention already</br></br>  <br><br> those potatoes <br><br> s2 never </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad I wasn't the only one. You really had to force it.</br></br>  <br>I mean proportion wise</br>  <br>Her massive tits are nice too.</br>  <br><br><br>there are so many awesome GK from abbyssal girls but they never pick them up, its as if they hated money</br></br></br>  <br>The name of the arc is clearly written in English.</br>  <br>But she could be easily bullied into the situation.</br>  would you an obaasan?  Anira will be expensive as hell  <br>I'll pay as long as she's under 26k</br>  <br><br>at least she'll be getting a mf scale soon.</br></br>  <br>you can't even fucking read katakana you blithering idiot<br>ヴ not ブ</br></br>  <br>Yeah she wasn't as bad as Lucchini but still so many of the witches have parts that are tough to put into place</br>  <br>I hope they dont actually go with that design, its the worst I've seen so far, not that its ugly, but lame as fuck</br>  <br> girls in armor  <br>That's my fetish</br></br>  <br>Any Vinland Saga, but especially the Thorkell vs. Thorfinn fight on the London Bridge.</br>  <br>Is the game really that popular? I tried it and it was pretty bland.<br>Or do people just like it for the art?</br></br>  <br>That is a lot of little toys.</br>  <br>It's one of the most popular mobage in Japan. Probably everyone have their reasons to play it</br>  <br>I like you.<br> also ridiculous tits </br></br>  <br>true and I need more scales of embarrassed girls</br>  <br> those thighs  <br> that armpit <br>Oh holy shit Tama</br></br></br>  <br> Lame as fuck <br> Giant girl with a fucking naval base around her <br> all the other Kancolle figs are the girl just standing there.

Can't ever have too much PVC ass.</br></br>  <br>why doesn't he wear his mask?</br>  Too soon for prototype right guys?  <br>Nah its a pretry common feature people like, just like boobs armpits give off pheromones</br>  Would you?  <br>No</br>  <br><br>Already did.</br></br>  <br>already did anon, it will keep me warm this winter</br>  <br>It's the body line and balance and how the body works and leads to other attractive parts, boos for example.</br>  <br>Too expensive, I could make one for half the price with a more accurate color</br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br>  <br><br>Go make your bootleg then.</br></br>  <br>It's actually quite complex.<br>Without his mask he's just Walter.<br>And Walter can compromise, unlike Rorschach.<br>It's the only instance he does so. That is: compromise.<br>Since in the whores son he sees hisself.<br><br>It's similar to the end when Dr. M instagibs him.<br>Rorschach doesn't die (or compromise, even in the face of Armageddon [sic]).<br>But Walter does.<br>He sees the purpose and need in Rorschachs demise, but Rorschach hisself cannot allow hisself to be killed.<br><br>Sorry for the /co/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I might make one someday.</br>  There will be more Pochacos announced at wonfes right?   mfw XXXL sized umaru cape is not available for sale so /a/ makes their own   <br><br><br>How are you suppose to go out in public with that?

Maybe more Ships?</br>  <br>This or a  Kanata figure <br><br>  ;_;  </br></br></br>  Made a thing, in case anyone is planning on following the #wf2015s tag via tweetdeck.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/QNvP2hjx<br>Stick it in a new Stylish script, remove the last } and the -moz line for Chrome.<br>Needs to be filtered by images only with small text size on one column, and it probably breaks some shit, but it works for this at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Winter wonfes last year</br>  <br>Is there an actual Fubuki nendoroid? No right? Must'ev just been her on the box art :/</br>  <br>Can you live knowing you have the inferior version?<br><br> You had to ask, so you shouldn't. </br></br></br>  <br>Are we there yet?</br>  <br>It was a teaser image, they did the same for hoppou and ooyodo. Hoppou's final model was shown on the 21st, I imagine Fubuki will come soon after wonfes as they didn't show any teasers on twitter</br>  <br> cure heart <br><br>gross</br></br></br>  Aquamarine is shit?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128579519 <br>are you stupid? it's a drawing.</br>  <br>just buy the whobuki 1/8</br>  <br>Works like a charm.<br><br>Thank you anon, this will be useful.</br></br></br>  <br>Is shit Aquamarine?</br>  <br>i can live with it</br>  <br>That one doesn't look that great &gt;.&lt;</br>  <br>I noticed before you posted.

Been waiting from far before the damn anime aired to her, nips better releaser her already.</br></br>  <br>How much is Sader worth these days?</br>  <br>I own it.<br>I really like it since its true to Shibafu's illustration and not Fubuki's generic anime design.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the answer</br>  <br>Neat. I didn't know tweetdeck was available on their website.</br>  what time does wonfes start  <br>True. Guess i'll look out for it.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>right now</br>  <br>I want to buy a fubuki nendo and if they make a naka nendo just to  scrap   them</br>  <br>It got delayed till February.</br>  <br><br>Some guy has working on a scale model kit from tank-kun</br></br>  How about now, are we there yet?  <br>This is wonfes</br>  Are you ready for WonFes /a/  has a release date for that yuuki yuna cu poche been made yet? and did GSC drop that kinmosa nendo or are they still going with it?  <br>I've seen these posted before, not sure if this is what you are talking about<br><br> I also have the .stl 3d printer files for tank-kun, but that's probably never going to come to fruition. <br><br>I just wish the Kanata figure didn't get cancelled. Goddamn 11s.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wonfes, the only time where rent/mortgage falls down to 2nd in financial priority.</br>  <br>I'll cut you fagot.<br>Sad it will be "Anime Version" and no Kai Ni.<br> A poi nendo would also have all my money </br></br></br>  <br>That guy's inner pillow is shit.</br>  Will they show Illya and Kuro at wonfes?    <br>Do you have the .stl files? Mind sharing them?<br>I may or may not have access to a 3D printer at the uni.</br></br>  <br>Is this availible in XXXXL?</br>  <br>No, and I have to pee so we better stop at the next gas station.</br>  <br>You know he's not looking at him. Look at the people behind him, there's some shit going on to his right.</br>  <br><br>I want a scary nendo.</br></br>    <br>  <br/></br>  <br>You just ruined that picture's magic.</br>  <br>yeah probably some guy who's even more spergy that him.</br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/m<wbr>ior9noj38j97up/Tank-kun+parts.rar<br><br>Good Luck anon</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Why hasn't there already been one is what I ask.</br>  You see this? This is how it should be. Fucking chibi little shit I swear to God. Would it kill them to keep her this way?  Hamster Umaru is best Umaru.  no but u dont understand!<br><br>the laziness adds EXTRA depth!</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, annoying piece of shit. I'll fucking kill you.</br>  just watch something else then faggot<br>you dont deserve umaru</br>  <br>No one deserves Umaru. Some people deserve a slow, painful death but no one deserves Umaru.</br>  But her hamster mode is the funniest and cutest thing ever this season  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565466 <br>We're going to have to dissect it and find out.</br>    <br>Funny how?</br>  <br> But her hamster mode is the shittiest most unholy piece of insufferable garbage ever this season </br>  <br>I like the faces and noises she's making in that mode<br><br>k</br></br></br>  <br>It's not cute this way and would not appeal to fat neckbears who self-insert.</br>  <br>What sort of creature is this</br>  <br>a squid</br>  Umaru is love<br>Umaru is life</br>  <br> I can't understand what a comedy is <br>Let me guess, you think "fun" is a buzzword as well?</br></br>  <br> It's not cute this way <br>Fat neckbear who self-inserts here, speak for yourself.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565832   <br>It wouldn't be as funny then I guess. Dead pan jokes wouldn't be funny if the person telling them was laughing right? It's the same deal.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565832 <br>So never then?</br>  <br>Nice bump la</br>   chibi <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/</br>  I think Umaru is funny tbh  When did /a/ turn into Mr Enter? Umaru is funny  <br>Edgy /v/ros shitposting about a cute character.</br>  <br> Muh hug box Moé SOL shoes <br>This is why the other boards think we're gay</br></br>  <br>Epic meme, /v/ro!</br>    <br>No that's because of JJBA and  it's time  theads.</br>  <br>No, it's because of the threads where we literally discuss sucking each other's dicks.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570369 <br> dafuk </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570369 <br>Ebin</br>  Best girl needs more love  <br>A yokai</br>  <br> not knowing the epic meme </br>  <br>Her voice makes me peenis weenis hard</br>  <br><br>It'd be even better and more realistic if they rotoscoped her off of a real woman.</br></br>  Doujins when?<br><br>Incest doujins when?</br></br>  All that junkfood she eats is going to make her take the worst shits.  I love this epic "I hate this chibi from this literally who anime so much!!!!" meme.    I wonder what her farts smell like.  I love this show but posting in these threads is a pain due to /v/.  UMR is best mode anyways.    <br>The fact that any rational person would beat it to death  with their dick  is part of its appeal.</br>  WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?  <br>your savior.</br>  <br> wrong filename <br>fuck off</br></br>   inb4 someone posts the webm   <br>too slow</br>  It it truly necessary to have 2-3 threads at any one time?  <br><br>How do you self-insert, &amp; what method do you use? You a writefag at all?</br></br>  <br><br>The hand-and-dick method.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow someone is so fucking edgy, please give some edge to me.</br></br>  Does she love her brother? She doesn't show interest in another guys and she seems to like her brother a lot. Is it going to end in incest? Please tell me it will.  <br>love this meme <br>#GotEm</br></br>  <br>Could you kill yourself, please? You are stupid, your opinion means nothing, and there is no hope for rehabilitation.</br>  <br><br>I think they have a pretty wholesome relationship m8.</br></br>  <br>so much this!</br>  I want to live the Umaru life.  manga spoiler<br> it ends with suicide </br>  <br>More of this.</br>  <br>ow the edge</br>   you will never   hang out with  Umaru  <br>I drank a 2 liter of coke and ate large amounts of food and sweets while watching anime last night.<br><br>I have horrible shits today and feel like garbage, the Umaru life is not worth it irl.</br></br></br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br>a potato</br>  <br>pedo pls go</br>  i can't tell if people are being ironic or actually freaking out about something so innocuous  <br>she sucks at COD anyway</br>  <br>It's mostly people from /v/ who are freaking out about her.</br>  has anyone made a webm of umaru slomo diving to onii-chan yet?  <br>It's dank meme like the Yahari cunt.</br>   brother living alone with little sister <br> no incest <br>And this is how you avoid bad anime.</br></br>  <br>What's it like being this much of a faggot?</br>  Can't we just enjoy the show?  so what does her chibi form suppose to represent? is hard to tell if its metaphorical since the transformation is real and even people are able to confuse her smaller size as an imouto.  <br>Are you fucking retarded?</br>  FAT PIG SLUT<br>A<br>T<br><br>P<br>I<br>G<br><br>S<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the hell is that thing, lieutenant?  <br> since the transformation is real and even people are able to confuse her smaller size as an imouto. <br>The transformation is real in the sense that it looks totally out of characters to outsiders and is incredibly immature and unrefined in comparison. <br>From that perspective you could easily suspect them to not be the same person from the sheer disconnect between the two images.</br></br></br>  Worst show of the season.<br>Worst fanbase of the season.</br>   arab name <br> wear hijab </br>  <br>Anyone know where Jordan's at? Usually he's pretty good with the webms.</br>  <br>This makes sense. Now I understand why /a/ is so mad. /a/ has become /v/.</br>  <br> I agree. At first I thought it was a visual metaphor but than Kirie thinks that chibi hamster is her sister. But you could also argue that because umarus dress and personality is wildly different from the umaru they know from school they just assume she can't be her and that she must be her sibling even if they physically see the exact same umaru.</br>  <br><br>The bigger question is how the hell Taihei didn't say anything to clear up the situation when he saw Kirie and Umaru hanging out together.</br></br>  <br>because he respect Umaru's decision of not ruining her mage for outsiders.</br>  Ebina is love.  <br><br>Yeah I guess he must have thought fast when he first saw them.</br></br>  <br>Ebola-chan &gt; Ebina-chan</br>  <br>he was too fearful for his life to think that far ahead</br>  <br>I think it started ironic, but newer people took it seriously. Like when we said KLK was saving anime. <br>If you act like a retard, then genuine retards will be attracted, I guess.</br></br>  <br>You will never be her onii-san.</br>  <br>I bet down there smells fishy.</br>  <br>Thank you for stating the absolute obvious, Mr. I've-been-here-for-two-years-so-I-k<wbr>now-what-I'm-talking-about.</wbr></br>  <br><br>Rude.</br></br>  <br>If nobody wanted an answer, nobody woulda asked the question.</br>  <br>KLK almost saved anime until they hacked off Satsuki's hair at the end.</br>  For the five other anons who care:<br><br> Producer Masao Maruyama announced at animation studio MAPPA's Otakon panel on Friday that the second Garo: Honoo no Kokuin television anime series is slated for this October. Unlike the first Garo anime, this series will be a jidaigeki (period drama) set in the Heian period. It will have a female protagonist. <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-24/2nd-garo-anime-to-prem<wbr>iere-in-october/.90850</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> It will have a female protagonist. <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  Anna is the biggets rapist ever, fucking tanukichi.<br><br> http://webm.host/82a62/vid.webm </br></br>  <br><br>He's bullshitting you.

The timing and posing are very similar.  <br>It made sense if the you actually paid attention to the movie itself and didn't simply marvel at the visuals or concentrate only on who Shinji wound up with at the end.</br>  <br>Depends on the studio and the budget. Production IG's Innocence is a good use of cgi</br>    What have you dropped so far this season? For me, it's been:<br><br>Million Doll<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat<br>Joukamachi no Dandelion<br>Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan<br>Himouto! Umaru-chan<br>Danchigai<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Gatchaman Crowds Insight<br><br>Pic unrelated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br><br>Really nigga</br></br></br>  <br>The only show i guess i could say i've dropped so far is Classroom Crisis.<br>I'm saying "i guess" because it's not like i disliked it (i'm a sucker for sci-fi, better if in the "hard" category) or the bait and switch put me off or whatever. It's just that i pretty much forgot its existence even before ep2 aired. Can't even put my finger on what made it so unremarkable, to be honest.</br></br>  <br>The show cannot combine the two genres of grimdark and moe slice of life. Anytime it attempts to shift from one tone to another the show because cheesy and downright laughable. Sora no Woto sometimes had this problem, but the execution was still much better compared to GG. GG has one of the highest cringe curves I've ever witnessed in anime, if you can get past that I guess it's enjoyable.</br>  Aquarion Logos<br>Classroom Crisis<br>Overlord<br><br>Only picked up four shows anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kamiyan <br>Picked up.</br></br>  Traitors.
