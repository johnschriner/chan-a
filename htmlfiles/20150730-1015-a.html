[  I wish for every molecule in Cell's body to spontaneously lose its gravitational force <br><br>Tell me why this wouldn't work and don't fucking say it's beyond his power, because he can create matter from nothing.

It couldn't affect him.  Goku wishes Buu into being good (and human, and back from the dead, all at the same time). That establishes that a single wish is more than sufficient to make a villain become good. There's no reason he couldn't have wished Cell into being a good guy, or any villain for that matter.  <br>Gravity ≠ Electromagnetic Force</br>  <br>Because then you wouldn't have a very interesting arc or fight now would you?</br>  <br>It wouldn't work because Goku and Vegeta want to have a fair fight against Cell and would stop anyone from making a wish like that.</br>  <br>Eh no.<br>Buu was just reincarnated. Goku's "wish" was just that, a wish. It had nothing directly to do with Uub's birth.</br></br>  <br> Goku wishes Buu into being good (and human, and back from the dead, all at the same time). <br>But he doesn't use the Dragonballs for that.<br>That was a present from the afterlife's masters for Goku's saving the universe.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't remember the plot of Dragon Ball but I'm still going to try to point out plot holes in it </br>  <br> Goku wishes Buu into being good <br>That's not what happened you idiot.</br></br>  <br>Why would you bother wishing for Cell's body to be destroyed in such a specific way?

It's like the author built up the whole Carne Village meeting just for this one scene.</br>  <br>Wow, Gazef and his loyalty. I can see why Ainz would want him despite him being a human.</br>  <br>I've been following all the threads, and I don't think that we had any ch 3 spoilers.</br>  <br>    as a collector <br>He really sees them as animals now doesn't he?</br></br>  <br>this is good</br>  Any hint for ch 2 and 3 summaries? Cant find them on wikia or archive. Can only find spoilers for ch 1 and 4 on archive.  <br>Gazef is a manly man.</br>  <br>Hell, I can't wait to read it whole...<br>Anyway thanks for  spoilers </br></br>  For some in the past thread.  <br><br><br>Summary TL here<br><br>i tried to translate 2 but its was too hard for name,lots of new names<br><br>it will be very weird for the summary<br><br><br>Well it seems he intent of making him his guardian</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>i fixed it up some here already:<br><br/></br></br>  <br>I like yours better</br>  <br>He's an idiot. Uniting the kingdom doesn't matter when a skeleton just nuked your entire army and their strongest warrior is going to die. The best adventurers can't even handle one death knight without much trouble, and Ainz has 500 of them just waiting to join the slaughter.</br>  <br>Goddamnit, all I can picture is Brain weeping into a handkerchief upon Gazef refusing assistance.</br>  <br>Many keks would be had if Ainz had just black holed Gazef. No body to take back.</br>  <br>No one gives a shit about your lazy edit.</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. In the end, Gazef fancied himself a martyr. There's loyalty and then there's stupidity.</br>  <br>Being smart isn't a requirement for manliness. Sometimes you just have to stick with your principles, even if it's a dumb move to make.</br>  <br>It's kinda bizarre how inhuman Ainz becomes.<br>Even if he doesn't have human feelings anymore, he should still have some damn common sense.<br>I suppose he probably still thinks of the whole thing as a game.</br></br></br>   not wanting to be resurrected <br> wanting your kingdom to be destroyed cause you want all the factions to get along (in death) </br>  <br>But the other one has the chair and a nicer albedo</br>  <br>don't understand the last scentence<br> does his death unite the nobles or does it just say that it "might" unite </br></br>  <br> black holing gazef <br><br>kek indeed</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I hope his principles keep him company wherever he's going.<br><br>Honestly, he didn't have to die. He could have struck a deal with Ainz. If his principles were so strong, why didn't he sacrifice himself for the Kingdom he claims to love so much and go with Ainz. Ainz did promise to leave the rest of the Kingdom army alone.</br></br></br>  <br> Narbel </br>  <br>I liked the idea of Touch Me in the wall better. <br><br>But Demiurge is nice.</br></br></br>  <br>He does have common sense, the common sense of a benevolent tyrant slighted by the barbarian hordes at his borders.</br>  <br>To be honest, I heard that the author held another poll.  They voted that Gazef dies, so the author is just trying to give him a good send off. </br>  <br>What did he do that didn't show common sense? His purpose on that battlefield was to show the consequences of fucking with Nazarick. And by god did he show that.<br><br>I highly doubt he thinks of anything as a game after the Chair incident, if he even did at one point.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing. For a guy like Ainz, the only things that truly touches him are displays that reminds him of his own humanity or reminds him of the good old days with his guild. Else his lich side just makes him completely cold blooded.</br>  <br><br> that albedo </br></br>  <br>No, I understand his decision narratively. It was either him or Raeven and honestly, Raeven seems better from a narrative standpoint than Gazef.</br>  <br>A mass murder is a bit weird for someone who used to be a salaryman just a while back</br>  <br> To be honest, I heard that the author held another poll.   They voted that Gazef dies, so the author is just trying to give him a good send off. <br>I am quite sure this part was just anons asking if it was a poll. It was not confirmed.</br></br>  Are the polls web based or does some form come with the actual novel that you fill and post back to the publisher?  <br> making it super clear I'm only going with you because my country will be safe. <br> demanding a duel I have no chance of winning, essentially signing my death warrant just so my country will be safe. <br><br>Both have the same effect of showing humanity but only one is a shitty decision.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really that difficult a progression when he clearly claimed to be indifferent to the first knights he personally killed in the story, eight volumes ago.</br>  <br> Aniz ask to inspect Gazef sword,he gave it despite protests from brain and climb<br><br>Aniz wanted his sword after this Duel because it somehow defy Aniz Game mechanics<br><br>Gazef told him no,it belongs to the kingdom.Aniz respect his wish and return the blade back to its master<br><br>Gazef pass climb a set of handbells for signalling the start of the duel<br><br>Gazef get ready,Brain told climb Gazef might be able to win because he is going to use a technique stronger than six fold slash of light<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>That's where you're probably getting confused. Ainz literally can't be anything other than an "evil" lich. His past as a salaryman is only important now because he has memories of what it was like to be among friends and people he thought of as family.<br><br>Plus he's nothing if not pragmatic. Honestly, was there a better way of sending the message he wanted to send to both the Kingdom and the Empire?</br></br></br>  I was looking for a manga or translated lightnovel similar to overlord and oly found stuff like mushoku tensei and a like, but the cover already reeks of harem shit. I actually liked the erfworld webcomic the most until now. Any recommendations on non shitty harem manga with OP mc in a gameworld/fantasyworld  <br>Going with him would be the wrong decision.<br><br>Ainz is already super paranoid of unloyalty and being betrayed.<br><br>If Gazef joined him right there, it would be good for a while and Ainz would be happy, but then he'd start to question Gazef's loyalty. What if he only accepted for the sake of his country and is waiting for a chance to strike? What if he'll stab me in the back when I need him the most? All of these (reasonable fears) will begin to sprout and take place in Ainz mind if Gazef accepts.<br><br>Logically then, Gazef must die so that Ainz understands the undying loyalty and love that humans are capable of.<br><br>Or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he think he will unite them,it doesnt say might in the raws<br><br>so got to wait till volume 10</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Brain's delusions are still in full force. How funny.</br>  <br>You're forgetting how paranoid Ainz is and how bad that would turn on. And also, that Gazef is one of the few 'true' loyal people in the novel.<br><br> <br>Brain, don't lie to kids. <br><br>Is Gazef wearing the Kingdom's treasures equipment?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would say that Ainz would probably stop being as evil if he had another player to reel him in. His guardians basically goad him on to become more and more evil. He just didn't have anyone to act as a chain to his humanity, where the people of the new world just aren't his people, while the inhabitants of Nazarick just don't give a shit about humans.</br>  <br>When you put it that way, you might be right. But wouldn't Ainz bring him back an an undead? Or was he literally planning on bringing a human into Nazarick?</br>  <br><br>I added some more, better? Any suggestions? I got spare time and adobe cs while reading the LN.</br></br>  Brain better start fucking powerlevelling himself and Climb  <br>It's kinda impossible to even imagine Gazef accepting the offer. It's utterly contrary to his entire persona.</br>  <br>Forgot picture</br>  <br>I assume he'll see the power difference and get-a-training.</br>  <br>Well yeah, that too. But in the case that he did accept and betray his entire personality that's what would happen.<br><br>Gazef must die to show he is loyal. No two ways about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, this pretty much. Another human player who wasn't a lich would probably knock some common sense back into him.</br>  <br>I like this one</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I thought he'd just park Gazef in Carne along with his other human "specimens."<br><br>Didn't really think Ainz viewed Gazef as a threat by any stretch, unless something's changed since their interactions in volume 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not common sense, but human morality. Like Ainz still has some thoughts as Suzuki, but they've begun to wane more and more.</br>  <br>Truly the overlord does not care about the needs of the flesh</br>  <br>All it's missing now is Demiurge standing in the fire saying "Truly magnificent Ainz-Sama!"</br>  <br><br><br>At this point it'd have to be someone who arrived after Ainz. I don't see any human who was also a human/demihuman in Yggdrasil taking kindly to him mass-murdering people with a bunch of heteromorphic races</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz doesn't view Gazef as a threat, but rather as a figure that he respects and wishes he could emulate. Gazef is basically a very noble existence in his eyes, something that's worth having.</br>  <br>Right, which is why I found that postulation about Ainz growing more paranoid towards Gazef in the "what if the latter accepted" situation a bit off.</br>  <br>How about this one?</br>  <br>Add Albedo stalking Ainz in the shadows in all the panels and the part of episode 4 where Albedo goes " Yabee, Ainz-sama is too cool!" at the end</br>  <br>This is getting too complicated.</br>  <br>remove the &gt;implying <br><br>it makes it too cheesy</br></br></br>  <br>There's already a few humans in Nazarek at this time. Tsuare and Lastborn. Also Enri is officially part of Nazarek's kingdom, as is the whole of Cairne village.<br><br>Ainz should have just told Gazef to go back to the kingdom and tell them that he will let them remain independent but under the rule of Nazarek. Then put Renner on the throne and send Demiurge to dick her behind the scenes and act as a representative of Nazarek.<br><br>That way the kingdom gets to love, pretend like they are independent and Ainz has someone on the inside who can take them out if need be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ok it seems the japanese raws are using english name for skills,it might sound funny,but you guys already brave through my shitty englando translations<br><br> The Bell Rings,Gazef charge forward but he was stop in his tracks,frozen like a statue<br><br>Then Aniz seems to cast Time Stasis,it is explain enemy do not take damage during time stasis.He cast a DoT spell "Delay Magic·True Death".it says he has to cast the spell just in time for its effect to take place after time resume<br><br>"sayonara,Gazef Stronoff,i don hate you at all"<br><br><br>Time returns back to normal,Gazef cold body collapse,cue crying from brain and climb.<br><br>Aniz told them he is dead and in respect to Gazef last stand,he will halt his Goat on chasing the routing army<br><br>he added the spell that he cast on Gazef will prevent low level res on working on him and also spread the message to the citizens of the kingdom to bend the kneel and receive his benevolent judgement<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait,  spoilers said Gazef attack hurt him.So they meant it hurt the goat? </br>  <br>Gazef<br><br>;_;<br><br>Holy army beating the fuck out of Lich scum when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gazef only hurt the goat,Aniz remains untouched </br>  <br>Shit, shit. Bad decisions all around. Shit.<br><br>RIP  Gazef , you were too good for the world Ainz is about to make his.</br></br></br>  <br>I blame Climb for this</br>  <br>Welp, can't say it was much of an heroic battle.</br>  <br>there is still epilogue about brain and climb but i will translate it tomorrow night</br>  <br><br> third panel <br> SAO clone <br> log horizon <br> Gate is better <br>I lost my shit like a sideless animal</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A spell that prevents  low-level resurrection?  How is that balanced?</br>  <br>If he didn't rang the bell<br>Gazef would have not fight</br></br>  <br> Spikes don't have green outline with implying coming out of each one of them </br>  <br>Probably because you can revive people with a spell of an equal level to the one he used.</br>  <br>Man, Ainz is too paranoid to play around and goes for the kill without delay</br>  does aniz die at the end? cause i hate the stupid side characters the only interesting characters are from nazerik  <br> high level shit beating low level shit isn't balanced </br>  <br><br>fucking wrekt</br></br>  <br>raw say its a tier 9 level spell<br><br>but the funny thing is,not enough information about the time stasis part. it seems to be just instant cast</br></br></br>   tfw no leaks in anime <br><br>Id murder someone just to watch another two episodes this week.<br><br>this is why i dont often watch new anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try asking again when you learn english.</br>  <br>English isn't my first language sorry.

It seems there is no translation after chapter 4.  <br>They put a new chapter every sunday.</br>  <br>Well, that's how D&amp;D Time Stop works which a lot of Yggdrasil spells seem to be based on.

Plus the game is first person so stuff like blind spots exist.<br><br>Outside of a few enemies I doubt the game even had full scale raid bosses and it was mostly guild vs guild since having your guild wipe against a boss would pretty much kill your ability to defend your treasury from another guild.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Slane theocracy <br>Ainz still not sending spy in Slane theocracy?<br>He suspect if the king or someone is from Yagdrassil?</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, 1 hp damage still count as hurt eh</br>  <br>Guadrdians are like bosses in Tibia<br>1v1 they are nothing spectacular unless you're unlucky  or shit  and get bursted <br>But they always spawn so much fucking shit thet they are impossible to solo</br></br></br>  <br> I'm surprised Albedo managed to restrain herself from outright praising and gushing over Momon/Ainz in public. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128767002 <br><br>Open mouth would be a little better.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128767002 <br>You could easily make the original into a Momon one.

C'mon, Tabula used all their resources once and he simply bought more resources for his friends and for him to keep building shit like nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>The guardians alone have exceed 700, there are level 40-60 maids and dozens of level 90 npc in various areas.</br>  <br>Fixed!</br>  Is everyone ready for the chibified mini-series in August?  <br>Fucking squidward built half the guild.</br>  <br>And also untranslated sebas tian</br>  <br><br>Considering highest level in new world was lvl. 85, the evil tree and dragon lords, Summoning 5 lvl 90's, is overpowered, especially against humans who are at most lvl. 30.</br></br>  <br>I guess it's OP since in the game you'd need to kill thousands of monsters, not people.</br>  <br>Ainz also added to do a lot of things. He helped with the maids, created a lot of golems, a lvl 100 npc, and the guild weapon is probably his design as well, as I can't picture Touch Me with the staff. <br><br>Ulbert is the other one who seemed to work a lot into the game.</br></br></br>  <br><br>For real?</br></br>  <br>Well you also gotta realize not all the levels players take is 100% optimized for combat. <br><br>A level 100 that takes 10+ or so levels on some non combat classes would be weaker than a monster of level 90 that's optimized for combat only.</br></br></br>  <br>They're baby Outer Gods, they're good enough.</br>  <br>but the player would use those non-combat skills to make lots of dosh and get really good equipment</br>  <br> which are what, around level 90? <br>The greatest warrior in the world is under level 30, how the fuck do you beat a level 90 monster? Have you seen papa bones curbstomped a level 40 angel with a small fire?</br></br>  <br>I want it now.</br>  <br>It was an insta-death spell that summoned an NPC with high stats. <br><br>Even if its lvl90, it could probably fight and kill some low-equipment lvl100 and fight in good terms with a mid lvl100. <br><br>In the games seems that stats and equipment are a lot more important than pure levels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Truly magnificent</br>  <br>No, Ainz is specifically said to be shit at programming so he just made a maid (that all guild members had to make, apparently) and Pandora.</br>  <br>No the spell was considered OP in the game, which is what would bait out the enemy players.<br>The new world doesn't matter<br><br>I don't see why that would be easier to do since the monsters were probably higher level there and less likely to die so quickly</br></br></br></br>  <br> he just made a maid <br>Who?

It's like that. <br><br>Mmm, long pig.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When the same threads keep popping up with the same content in the OP, it starts being being spam. Or general threads.

It's the hot new shitpost.</br>  What a bitch. How can anyone like this disgusting animal?  <br>I can't be on [s4s] 100% of the time. I do other NEET activities; like working out.</br>  <br><br>Was a pragmatic suggestion in universe. I wish they'd have explored the relation in the monster realm about slimes and other non-humans or non-demi-humans and how they're perceived. It seems like slimes are treated as no different than dumb animals there.</br></br>  I wonder what centaur tastes like.<br><br>Also I had a dream where harpies were treated like wild animals and people would hunt them for food and cook only the human torso part.<br><br>The problem is some poachers and really bad people would mix in actual human torsos in the harpy meat supply and no one could tell the difference. It was considered a good way to cover up a murder.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's so disappointing that you can't fondle her breasts and enter her at the same time. Even if I were okay with horsepussy, you have to chose between giving attention to her upper half or lower half as they're about four or five feet away from each other.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty fucked up mang.</br>  <br> It's not actually a meme I'm just covering up my embarrassing typo I hope you realize that </br>  <br> I did.

I just googled horse udders and immediately regretted it.<br><br>This scene is now creepy as shit to me.</br></br></br>   horse pussy <br> disgusting <br><br>Sorry, but have you seen a horse pussy?<br><br>It's probably the closest analog in the animal kingdom to a human vagina. Except it's way bigger, way deeper, and squeezes harder.<br><br>If a hot centauress was waving that shit around I'd make some bad fucking decisions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Careful man, being friendly is one thing, but /a/ hates other boards better ones like /tg/   </br>  <br> It's probably the closest analog in the animal kingdom to a human vagina <br>Nah, that's sheep.</br></br>   my dick when suu spoke   Does anyone else think this show would be better if the girls weren't monsters?<br><br>Like, it was just 4-5 girls living in a big house all dating Darling-kun with the intent of marrying him?</br></br>  Even more disgusting are humans. <br><br>They use the same slimy hole filled with tiny parasites to consume corpses AND show affection to their loved ones. <br><br>When they are happy (or trying to threaten someone) they open that rotten hole and bare a set of pointy objects meant for ripping and mincing.</br></br></br></br>  How flexible is she? <br><br>If she could curve her horse body in a v shape, then lean her human body backwards, a human might be able to make out with, fondle, and enter a centaur all at the same time. Just like they would with a human woman.</br></br>  <br><br>How does she wipe her ass when she shits?</br></br>  <br>It would be the same shit. Literally the same shit, nothing would be different other than HOW they hurt Darling.  It would have to take place somewhere like Saudi Arabia though, so the women would have to go outside accompanied by Darling or a male escort. </br>  is there a translation for the slime species screen yet?<br><br><br>No, go fuck yourself, there are literally a thousand shows like that already.</br></br></br>  <br> that baby horse <br>you have no one to blame but yourself.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, check the archive for previous threads. I saw one around 2PM pacific I think.</br>  <br>found it quick, thanks</br>  <br>Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but really hairy and with extremely long nipples. It's fucking nightmarish.<br><br>Cerea, I'm sorry.</br></br></br>  <br> Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but...with extremely long nipples. <br><br>What part of this sounds bad?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you doing this to flare my autism?</br>  <br>holy fuck, pink slime please</br>  <br>yes they are disgusting,but<br> lay eggs </br></br>  <br>puffy pussy</br>  <br> that thumb <br>Hang on. I don't understand her anatomy. <br>Are harpies part bird, or do they have bat wings, but with feathers?</br></br></br>  <br>More like pseudo-hands. She's got a thumb of sorts, and can grip things, but she doesn't have a proper hand.</br>  <br>Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now.</br>    <br><br>I feel like Centaur's Worries had a much less disgusting explanation for this.</br></br>  Cerea Worries crossover when?!  <br>How's a magic sphincter disgusting. People would pay money to have one genetically added</br>  <br>I more meant that the explanation itself was grossing me the fuck out, not the fact that it's a sphincter that works really well.</br>  <br>Maybe when CW becomes poplar<br>i.e. never</br></br>  <br>mmm, pulsating overlapping sphincter control</br>  <br> Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now. <br>In the end the decision was to let Papi grasp things. Having characters with no legs is one thing, but no hands is another matter that would cause difficulties.</br></br>  <br>she's a Deep One. gotta go Deep</br>  <br>  ;___;  </br>  How does Cereal wipe her ass?  <br>Much better now.</br>  <br>With a clean cloth, and a stick.</br>  <br>Hi, /co/  or possibly /v/. </br>  <br>Did you read/watch the manga/anime? Cerea said it herself.</br>    <br>dolphins are still better</br>  <br>I'm team Miia, but Cerea's not a bad choice. <br><br>Also, if the BR/DVD doesn't have that goddamn shedding scene (or if it doesn't magically appear in the next episode or as an extra or something) I'm petitioning another goddamn Fatman be dropped on those fucking Nips.</br></br></br>  <br>please enlighten a non-mangafag fellow anon, what is the shedding scene</br>  <br> Miia burns her hand while trying to cook a meal for darling. Because of this, she can't shed her skin on her own which is a very personal act for a Lamia, especially when you recall that stimulating the tip of her tail can make her orgasm. Darling helps her out and everything is going okay until he remembers he has to remove the skin near her vagoo. Miia becomes more embarrassed and uses her tail to keep Darling from seeing her sensitive spot. This leads to Darling accidentally fingering her, prompting a shocked Miia to involuntarily snap Darling's neck. </br>  <br>  Read the manga.  </br>  <br>So you'd never do anal?</br>  <br>I'd a Cerea ass.</br>  <br>rip darling. any chance you know what chapter it is?</br>  <br>On the contrary, I'd pound that flank like there's no tomorrow.</br>  <br>nvm found it</br>  <br>It's been a while, but it's one of the earlier ones, like right around or before they meet Suu.</br>  <br> that music that played when suu was introduced </br>  <br>Well that explains Wales</br>  <br>And New Zealand.</br>  <br> Nice! <br>Crab is too based.</br></br>  <br>They need that scene to explain Miia's shedded skin that she kept in the laying egg chapter though.<br>But who knows, maybe they'll skip that part too.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I bet her reactions to her first asspounding would be both delicious and cute.</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is that Mero would be best girl either way.</br>  Rachnee being drunk of caffeine is a confirmed biological fact right? Are spiders really supposed to get wasted on the stuff?  <br>Can you guys stop? There's way too much blood rushing to my dick right now.</br>  <br>what about shark grills</br>  <br>qt sharks are great.</br>  <br>All?</br>  <br>fag.</br>  <br>How much do I have to pay to get a finjob with her pelvic fins?</br>    <br>So Red, Green and Black Slimes are unfuckable?

Straight vanilla for me, while she repeatedly slams my balls with that winking clit.</br>  I haven't read the manga in ages. is there a werewolf yet?  <br>no.</br>  <br>well thats disappointing. someone get ahold of me when theres a cute wolf girl making awoos</br>  <br>There's a cute kobold girl if that tickles your fancy.</br>    <br>thats ok I guess.</br>  <br> mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas <br> Natural wonder of the world <br>Not that i have anything against horse pussy and Cerea,but the "wonder of the world part" obliterated my sides to oblivion.</br></br></br>  <br>Oldschool kobold. As in dog person. Speaking of that, how did the kobold transition from dog people to jew lizards?</br>  <br>You want disgusting? Lamia is over 7m long. 5.5-6 of those meters are constantly dragged through the streets. Those same 5.5-6m then coil around you in bed. A bath before sex might help, I guess, but she still has to drag that into your home. Or wrap around your neck when she wants to drag you somewhere.<br> But the streets of Japan are clean! <br>What about public restrooms? Even if she herself doesn't go in them(or like that MS Paint an anon drew illustrated, she simply lifts her tail tip all the way to the bowl to empty her cloaca), other people drag those same restroom germs onto the streets, where she picks them up. A Lamia waifu would be a germophobe's ultimate nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone liked lizards more I guess</br>    <br>Head over to Jitsu Wa Watashiwa</br>  <br> Birds shits, pee and lay eggs from the same hole. Ultra disgusting. <br>You can fuck her and have vaginal and anal sex pretty much at the same time. I find it cool.</br></br>  I find Cerea disgusting. Don't have problem with Rachnee, she's hot.    <br>That's why Suu is best.</br>  I love horse pussy.

I know that's the teletubbies custard machine.</br>  <br> prefer mating with humans. <br>more like prefrence to mating with bishies<br>if cerea mom had a son instead I'd imagine he would be pretty popular with them.</br></br></br>  <br>That's an idiotic theory and a crime to fictional anatomy. Why the hell would they have an asshole going through their spines?</br>  <br/>  Reminder: thank Crabman  <br>You wouldnt stick your hand inside dude, youd just softly run your fingers over them, making her gasp cutely as you do so.<br><br>God i fucking want mero so much.</br></br></br>  If she's more than 50% animal, you a furry!  <br>the only thing that I don't like about Mero isn't the fish legs, isn't the webbed hands, isn't anything else, it's just...<br>She's covered in mucous, right? And she survives deep underwater. That makes sense, some fish are like that.<br>But wouldn't she be very, very cold to the touch? Not only that, but you'd have to wash your hands just about every time you touched her. <br>She's great, but imagine embracing a freezing, wet body for love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>50% what? Mass?<br>Miia has 80% of a human and a 6m long tail</br></br>  <br>Overall surface area<br>Papi and Lala are literally the only non-furry main girls</br></br>  <br>at what point is 50%</br>  <br>As labelled 1 is the only non furry there</br>    <br>5 is not furry</br>  <br>So none of the monmusu girls are furry</br>  <br>5 is fully animal, so of course.</br>    <br>Why did I laugh so hard at this. It's not even remotely funny.</br>  <br>At that point it's bestiality not furry then.</br>  <br>Furry is the attraction to animal features. Most monster girls' features are more like accessories than attractive features. In the same way some people don't get turned on or off by legs, Spider Butt isn't necessarily attractive or unattractive. Polt and Horse are more arguable.</br>  <br>Because the joke is dangerously cheesy.</br>    <br> http://imgur.com/a/GEpNq <br><br>You're welcome</br></br></br>  Miia a cute.  <br><br>Furry is the attraction to animal heads and some animal features. MG fetishism is the attraction to human heads and monster/animal features. That's the big difference, you can have 2 identical designs except 1 has a dog head and 1 has a human face, and only the one wit the dog head is "furry".</br></br>  <br>Being attracted to half a horse if pretty fucking close to bestiality.</br>  Obligatory Lala post.  <br>Why isnt she covering her butt</br>  so guys, how does this end up happening?  <br>But this is not bestiality, or perhapsthe fanservice in the series doesn't affect you?</br>  <br>MG fetishism is more about attraction to human FEATURES than only head. At the very least the torso<br><br>If Cerea was a horse with a human head it would be just creepy</br></br></br>  <br>The bigger the are, the harder they fall.<br>She's like 2 meter tall. Imagine falling down with all the weight of a horse to pull you down.</br></br>  <br>because she probably isn't going to swim she might just lay in the sand and get warm.</br>  <br>no, i mean, with her centaur lower body, her human back shouldn't be on the floor</br>  <br>but how did she fall on her back when she has a horse body behind it?</br>  <br>RIP Satoru</br>  <br>some guy at mgqg did one of promestein</br>  <br><br>Yes, but these human features outside the face and maybe the torso are highly up to the viewer to decide. And I didn't mention the torso because furries also value the humanoid torso. The big differentiator between MG and Furry is the face, specifically the nose/mouth area. You can have weird ears, weird eyes, scales and shit, but as long as the nose and mouth are humanoid, they satisfy the MG fetishist, whereas the furfag will be attracted to NONHUMAN noses and mouths, specifically muzzles, beaks and snouts.</br></br>   Miia puts on a few pounds <br> Rachne spins a web over her bedroom door that says "Some Pig" </br>  <br>now im sad anon, thanks a lot.</br>  <br>Now that I checked, her more could also turn a lot of her human torso too.<br><br>Maybe centaurs just have a really versatile waist?</br></br></br>  So, what the fuck is going on here?    <br>so, Polt and Ninetei having a canine hose in a human face make them furry?</br>  <br> lying cheating whore </br>  But Papi has a normal vagina and are-hole, right? That part is human.  <br>Borderline, to be honest. They're like Mithra because they have animal noses on human facial structure. It's kind of a grey area but I get the feeling it's more for MG fetishists than furries.</br>  <br>what I don't get is why cerea is completely unaffected with the fact that her father isn't her biological father.</br>  <br> is there a censored and uncensored version of this show? <br>I too want to know that before downloading the first episode. Anyone?</br></br>  <br>It's the effort to turn the dangerous ones to safe ones. The most satisfying feel.</br>  How can anyone like the horse woman over bird lady?  <br>because his father must be either an asshole or barely present in her life</br>  <br>No, there's no uncensored TV airing. That's what the BDs are for.</br>  <br> "LOOK AT MY ASS, SENPAI! LOOK AT IT! NOTICE MEEE!!!" </br>  <br>I don't care about all these technicalities and percentages<br>I just want to scratch her ears and see her tail wag</br></br>  <br>There hasn't been any nipples, and Suu's bath scene had light streams, so I'd assume it's censored.</br>  <br>still thats got to be a major bomb shell of a revelation.</br>    <br>Some thing are very borderline. Like the bath scene in the first episode.<br>But no true "Full frontal nudity"</br></br>  <br>and she wants to take some walks.<br><br>are you ready for exercising, anon?</br></br></br>    <br>Who the fuck cares, honestly? Enjoy whatever you want, just don't be an autist about it.</br>  <br>there is a legit nip slip in episode 1 if you mess with the font</br>  <br>They're just doing a really shitty job at censoring certain scenes.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>I enjoy classifying things, so sue me.</br>      <br>they prefer relationships</br>  <br>bullshit</br>    <br>Did you miss every single one of the centaur girls looking displeased at their brute husbands? Maybe not relationships, but they sure don't like then, hence why they need a cute looking human to flare then up.</br>  <br>thats not a reltionship<br>thats a fling<br>cerea mom certainly didn't marry that guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Who knew Centaurs were such cucks</br>  <br>z-ton already did a thing with this long before monster musume did.</br>  <br>She can't do it, i think it's a tradition thing, going against it after lying about the deed being done like "normal" would probably put her proud family name in a bad spot or something.</br>  I am not in the loop, how is the mermaid related to NTR? I know there's a NTR mermaid in MGQ, but here?  <br> dicking around with a tiger shank <br>I will never be this brave.</br></br>  <br>She has a little mermaid fetish (the original where she dies). She's growing out of it but still keeps the core idea in her head.</br>  <br>This isn't even the worst I've got.</br>  <br>Fucking rednecks.</br>  <br><br>I hope that when we get to characters like Zombina, Tio or Polt, we get these for there subspecies.<br><br>Would love to see that multi breasted Kobold that was mentioned in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she has a tragedy fetish <br>I bet she would like madoka magica</br></br>  <br> Living Dead subspecies <br> Runner <br> Voodoo <br> Rage </br></br></br></br>  Does she shit while walking just like horses?  <br>It's not like you can flee once he pops up. That was probably the only right thing to do. Annoy him and try to keep your hands on his head to push him away until he goes away.</br>  <br>Best girl you say?<br>Bitch please.</br></br>  <br>It also sounds like she wants to use Cerea as proof that human-bred centaurs can be strong in order to help change centaur culture. So there's a chance she is still seeing her old teaser, just not openly.</br>  <br>Probably they all shit wherever, but it's against the law to mention it due to "cultural differences."</br>  <br>As she likes to point out, she is not a horse. Her behavior is mostly human.</br>  <br><br>Do you throw your shit at people like monkeys?</br></br>  Penguin musume fucking when?  <br>That isn't normal? How else do you fend off other people?</br>  <br>Ever since playing Dark Souls I cant not see the "well is that it?" pose whenever I see penguines. <br><br>It cracks me up</br></br></br>  <br>penguins arent monsters anon</br>  <br>he didn't even annoyed it, sharks enter a kind off ecstacy trance when petted like that.<br>The shark literally cum and the guy raped it</br></br>  <br> It's not like you can flee once he pops up <br>Read the bottom line below the website's link.<br>It's an aquarium/sea level that has sharks there on purpose.<br>Dat nigga went into shark-infested water on purpose.</br></br></br></br>    <br>You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?</br>  <br>Honestly, yeah.</br>    Is it possible that Mero's fascination with tragedy stems from a mindset in which she believes that she could never truly be happy considering human relations and her sheltered lifestyle and has instead romanticized her expectation as a coping mechanism? But hey I'm not a psychologyfag  <br>Very possible anon, thats one of the most common theories regarding her tragedy fetish.</br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? Penguin Musume is a pretty old.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/ZxnVVHO-POI  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She changed tough, the plays like she's happy to be "being taken away from her love" when the fish guys inform her that she needs to return home, but right after that she looks really sad. I think she just wanted everyone to think she was ok with it to not worry then.</br>  <br>probably, thats what happened to a bunch of anons if you want to see an example.</br>  <br>Oh I'm aware, it's just fun to speculate mentality. I'm curious to see where her arc is going.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/WJKDaIUYt6g  [ ]<br><br>Time to take a truck ride</br></br></br>  <br> It also sounds like she wants to use Cerea as proof that human-bred centaurs can be strong in order to help change centaur culture. So there's a chance she is still seeing her old teaser, just not openly. <br>The relevant manga page basically say the teaser program were literally a gigolo service in disguise. And that no one was willing to fuck their husbands.<br><br>But yeah, the mum was afraid that she had weakened her bloodline by mating with a human. But really, she had nothing to worry about; that human was already stronger than the designated centaur. She made the right choice.</br></br></br></br>  Both anime and manga are pretty fucking shitty.<br>but Papi is cute</br>  <br>So if you feel like speculating mentality lets try to talk about the other girls.</br>  <br>And another thing, the breeding program for race horses really isn't very healthy for the horse. This might be what was implying in the story, that the attempted genetic manipulation had lead to a weaker male gender. Much like how race horses are many times more difficult to take care of compared to farm horses.</br>  <br>Not really stronger, he just used the right tool for taking him out of the way. I mean, do you seriously think that buff as fuck centaur is weaker than the teaser?</br>  <br>how does he put on that tight diving suit with balls that huge?</br>  <br>I kind of want a chapter where Cerea meets her real dad. Maybe her mom moves into the area and decides to live with him?</br>  <br>Like who?</br>    <br>I like her a lot.</br>  <br>You would fuck a horse, of course?<br><br>Someone needs to do a Dr. Seuss style monster girl thing.</br></br></br>  <br>I was going to give an example but then I realized that we know most of the girls.<br><br>Rachs got the rough exterior due to her dangerous appearence and past experiences despite being the kindest amongst the group. <br><br>Centorea like Mero is more naive in a way (as seen from her initial appearence) but loyal and honorable and has this "loveable aunt" compared to the other girls. <br><br>Lala is chu2 to the point of almost getting darling killed, but we dont know if she's actually just bullshitting or this is some form of coverup for her supernatural shniz.<br><br>Suu 's mentality have evolved since her first appearence and probably will continue to as we know she has mind reading and an incredibly fast learning ability so she's among the smartest (yet also dumbest?) <br><br>And Papi is,<br><br>Papi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not really stronger, he just used the right tool for taking him out of the way. I mean, do you seriously think that buff as fuck centaur is weaker than the teaser? <br>At some point the breeding program went wrong and the males became weaker warriors. They might look big but with no actual combat ability. Selective breeding often cause that.</br></br>   Oh no a Slime is in the house What should we do? <br> Call Smith to help us out? <br> Nope, Let's take a bath </br></br>  <br>They kinda explained why alredy. Times changed and they aren't in need of fighting anymore, so they just end up being useless masses of muscle.</br>  I'll just leave this here.  <br><br>whould you look at that plot</br></br>  <br>This shit is borderline MLP faggotry.</br>  <br>Well for Rachnera you could argue that her sexually dominate nature is used to control her investment in partners and thus protect herself from any emotional backlash (because she often points out human negativity) because she regulates the familiarity. So say if Kimihito became an asshole she would simply write him off as merely a plaything to suit her sexual desire.<br><br>In Miia's situation we know that she's very possessive and fiercely jealous of any other woman taking darling. In lamia culture we see they practice group sex and freely share male partners for the overall benefit of the species. From this we can assume that lamias share pretty much everything and always put their society first. So perhaps Miia in her frustration in individually and desire to possess something unique (this case Kimihito) she can only respond by establishing a dominate pecking order in the household</br></br></br>  <br>This whole thread is borderline furry faggotry, yet you don't see anyone else complaining</br>    <br> her heart is in her left tit <br><br>What a  disgusting fucking create </br></br></br>  <br> not liking papi butt <br>fag</br></br>   Fluff   So would Cerea be tolerable if she had a front vagoo, or would the horse ass still be a deal breaker?  <br>Oh yeah i forgot Miia. <br><br>Good analysis. I wonder could you do mon and the other girls too?</br></br></br>  <br> birds <br> furry <br> snakes <br> furry <br> slimes <br> furry </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter. The neigh-sayers would still find some reason to shit on her.</br>  <br>Same way I squeeze my cock into your moms tight pussy:)</br>  I love Miia, her obsession for Darling arouses me.  <br>Yep, those are all furries. They have special snowflake names that nobody cares about so they can be hipster within their disgusting subsubculture.</br>  <br>Speaking from experience, from the sounds of it.<br><br>How is that so-called superior subculture of yours?</br></br></br>  <br>you're a pea brained poopy-pants and your mother left you and your alcoholic father for a better family</br>  <br> :3 </br>  <br> in heat year round <br>yes please</br></br>  <br>Guess it's not that superior...<br><br>Keep trying, though. Soon you can move out of the diapers and onto the Pull-Ups.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit, a lion</br>  <br>Haha I could try. Hmm....<br><br>Zombina is similar to Rachnera, a tough exterior but perhaps hiding a softer side. However where she differs is in her self image. She may see herself of little value, possibly self destructive, and enjoys high risk missions because the adrenaline makes her feel "Alive". I say this because of her attitude when her body is damaged (losing a hand) and when Kimihito demonstrates that he sees her as a person and nothing less, she's genuinely surprised.<br><br>In Tio's case I imagine her "flaw" was progressive as she grew older. When in adolescence she was free to be the girly girl that she was. But in maturity her size has her struggling with the fact that she can't dress/act the way she hopes. She doesn't want to be viewed as a giant, but as a normal woman.<br><br>Monako's shyness and social skills obviously correlate from her single eye. She hates eye contact and as a result is enable to form proper connections. What makes it worse is the fact that from a distance she looks normal, and every new encounter will be met with hesitation upon realization. So as a result she limits those awkward situations at every chance<br><br>And doppel......fuck give me a minute</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey hey hey, don't insult us diaper fetishists with people like them!</br>  <br>Doppel is an elder god with the sole purpose of fucking everything in the mortal plane of existence.<br><br>For some reason though she listens to Smith, guess that means Smith is what, Evil incarnate?

It's like if you were a devout Catholic and wanted to date that shy honors student who didn't have a thing for you at all, and then she randomly tried to give you a handjob under your desk in the middle of class or something while salivating.</br>  <br>This.

Fuck off from them.</br></br>  <br>I think it's more like her voice is featured too much in the ep and kind of plays out the novelty of it. Arai is fun as a side character since a hilariously weird voice gives such characters some well, character, that prevented them from being forgettable. Also she was most memorable going fucking nuts as Kuroko while she doesn't really hit the same extremes in this show since it's not the same character.</br>  <br>There's no easy way to say this... you have shit taste. With time and treatment, it may improve, but the more likely scenario is that you'll have shit taste for the rest of your life. I am so sorry.</br>  <br>Its obvious they did it on purpose<br>Maybe to prevent her from becoming a sexualized meme<br><br> implying you will still jack off to your obaa-san loli </br></br></br></br>  <br> prevent <br> that implication <br>If that's the case, then they did a horrible job.<br>By the way, please stop calling everything a meme or using a name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They really want people to stop sexualizing loli, and they are being successful at it.</br>  <br>Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays.<br>And I don't think that it makes sense to like Saotome for her loli traits, because after all the only thing she has is her size. I'll even go a bit further and say she isn't a loli at all. Tiny as fuck and amazing, but not a loli.</br></br>  <br>Or rather, scratch that, she's on her way to become a legal loli. How old is she anyway? Is there even a term for someone who isn't quite an adult but still looks like a loli? Legal loli or lolihag doesn't quite work in here.</br>  <br> Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays. <br>That's true, and your pic is related, since it shows nothing, as expected from anything "loli service". It is nothing.</br></br>  <br>This. Anna didn't know what a dick even was let alone have enough time to figure out how to stick it inside her. Though that doesn't change the fact that she is now a stalker, despite freaking the fuck out about being stalked herself just the previous episode</br>  <br>She's supposed to be a disgusting looking little runt midget so her voice is perfect.</br>  <br><br>I like you guys.<br>I know /a/ has lots of alpha males who wouldn't flustered AT ALL when a beautiful and "pure" girl suddenly aggressively wants their dicks.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably be horrified and pass out from the mental trauma it caused.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128749959 <br>In all honesty I wish this meme would die</br>  <br>Well, you and I are a pussy by /a/ 'standard', then.</br>  <br>never change, /a/</br>  <br>Lol fag</br>  <br><br>Nigga you got to remember, if they even try to do that shit, the bracelets they're wearing are going to trigger and they're both going to be locked in prison for the rest of their lives or some shit.</br></br>  nani sore  <br>Wrong hag dude</br>  <br>Except this is probably the only time this has ever been done where it makes sense. Congratulations on being retarded.</br>  <br>OP confirmed for shit taste</br>  Don't worry people, this will hit the gutter soon enough.  <br> dat shit taste on /a/ <br>Can't wait for summer to end.</br></br>  <br>He's not in love with Anna, he's in love with pure, kind-hearted, pre-conceived image he had of her.<br>All that situation did was made him question if she's really the same person he thought he was in love with.</br></br>  Voice fits fine for me, reminds me of that one tiny fashion nigga from The Incredibles.  <br> They gave an excuse! <br> It doesn't matter if it only applies when it's convenient to keep things static <br> YOU'RE THE IDIOT! NOT ME! <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  THE ONE QUESTION I NEED TO KNOW:<br><br> People that read the LN, does anyone actually fuck or is this the same old haremshit that goes nowhere ? </br></br>  Is the show worth picking up? Is the MC a cliché harem protagonist?  <br> He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life <br>No you idiot, he's the MC because he had the upbringing where he knows that's no the case.</br></br>  <br> I-I''ll just imply they're completely asocial losers who wouldn't react in a situation literally any teenage boy would react in! </br>  <br>How the fuck do those things even work? You can't draw lewd pictures, but you can strip naked, put your panties over someones head then lick them from head to toe?</br>   shitty VA <br><br>I think her voice is great <br><br>I tend too like VA eith uniwue voice like hers.<br><br>Kike Judo for example</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except this is probably the only time this has ever been done where it makes sense. <br> LN gives a surface level excuse <br> It only applies in specific instances where the plot could accidentally move forward and isn't actually reflective of the characters at all <br>Sorry, I was just caught off guard because I honestly never thought people were stupid enough to accept characterization done that poorly.<br><br><br>It's not haremshit, just love triangleshit that goes nowhere.<br><br><br> Is the MC a cliché harem protagonist? <br> Super valiant white knight who saves girls and is selfless so people can self insert and pat themselves on the back <br> Rejects sexual advances <br>What do you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to remember that Okuma's dad was arrested and he was socially ostracized because of his Dad's lewdness and dirty jokes, so he does have a reason to be opposed to sex.</br>  <br>He knows on a fundamental level that it isn't inherently evil.</br>  <br>they're just bracelet shaped plot devices / plot holes. they work however they need to. I find them pretty stupid.</br>  <br>This is what MALtard influx will do to a board. Reminds me of the whining about Shinji.</br>  <br> I find them pretty stupid. <br>A contrived plot device that only conveniently works when the author needs it to? Yeah, that's fucking retarded. At least it fits right in with the convenient characterization that only becomes an issue when the author needs it to.</br></br>  <br>Artists are under stricter surveillance, because they are capable of drawing lewd shit. Normally they can't check logs of PM unless you are either committing a crime(using dirty words) or missing. At least until new law passes.</br>  <br>LN fag here, he does change to his dad's ways. Just let him develop.</br>  <br> This is what MALtard influx will do to a board. <br> People who have a problem with LNshit writing and MCs are MALtards <br>Why are you LNfags the worst fanbase on this board, and you do you always pretend to have some sense of seniority or sense of belonging here?</br></br></br>   162 posts  <br><br>the fuck</br></br>  <br> the fuck <br>Actually there was a lack of fucking.</br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit and bring your friends with you if you can't see how stupid this thread is.</br>  <br> LNfags <br> Redirecting people to Reddit <br>You are all the worst plague that's ever happened to this board.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The character literally talks like a grandma from 18th century, so the voice fits perfectly.</br></br></br>  <br> The character literally talks like a grandma from 18th century <br> Implying any of these retards know enough moon to understand shit like そのようじゃ。まぁ、わしよくも知らぬが isn't how a normal high school girl talks <br>ESLfags that read LNs don't actually know any Japanese. We've been over this.</br></br></br>  <br> ESL <br>You mean EOP.</br></br>  <br>Excuse me, that's わしもよく<br><br><br>I know you ESL want to pretend you're smarter than people who call you idiots because you can half understand English in addition to your own ooga booga speak, but none of you know enough English or Japanese to actually understand what's going on in an LN yet you constantly feel the need to comment on it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't know what you're talking about. She has a great voice.</br>  Lab girl&gt;Anna&gt;Kajo&gt;granny voice<br><br>You know this to be true.</br></br>  I've always loved her characters, but the granny tone is hyped up way too high on this one.<br><br>Should've toned it down just a bit to preserve the youth while not comprimising the snarkiness.</br></br>  I bet you can't look at this picture without hearing her lewd scream inside your brain.  <br>Her voice is exactly like Japanese Meowth https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HDG<wbr>0C-p8fNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Rude. Why do you call me an idiot while agreeing with me?</br>  <br>Wow, those jelly donuts sure look good.</br>  <br> agreeing <br>But I didn't. EOPs aren't the problem, ESLs are.</br></br>  <br><br>Pro tip: The majority of people who watch anime are beta faggots and cucks. <br><br>Seriously. No real man would watch this garbage. Real men stick to manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even care about this series but reading your autismal rant has been quite entertaining. <br><br>I've got a bucket of lego somewhere around here if you feel the need to arrange a few thousand bricks by height, weight and colour. Sounds like you might need a distraction from all of these social interactions. <br><br>Stay safe, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump all anime in with LN haremshit adaptations.</br>  <br>10/10<br><br>This is the best thing I've read in a while. I'll be using this.</br></br></br>  <br>This exact situation happened to me when I was 15. Yes, I panicked and pushed her off. I thought she was teasing me. I had never seen anime or manga or anything like that, so it's not that I was somehow influenced. I had been bullied a lot as a kid and fucked with many times. I grew out of it in a year or two after interacting with females more and realizing that some of them might actually find me likeable or attractive, but keep in mind, these shows are about teenage boys in a very outwardly repressed culture -- even those from other shows, not just shimoneta. It's possible that you just lack empathy.</br>  <br> I was gay from a young age so you lack empathy </br>  <br>But it sure seemed like that in  Maybe you should have worded it better to avoid being mistaken for ESL yourself.<br>Furthermore, I'm pretty sure being EOP is a problem, because they wouldn't be able to understand those nuances, leading to the stupid threads like this one.</br></br>  <br> ESLfag tried to claim native speaker wrote English poorly <br>Try learning how articles work before commenting on other people's language skills. If you couldn't understand my point it's because you lack reading comprehension and didn't want to believe someone who actually understands the source material was insulting you.</br></br>  Porn of Fuwa where?  <br>She sounded better in the manga</br>  <br>I appreciate you trying to actually discuss the series anon.</br>  <br> writing off inconsistent characterization as "development" <br> discussing the series <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br> implying the prude fibers in the PMs are not activated by the lewd energies and report the activity while simply undressing yourself doesn't get a reaction </br>  <br>Why are you here then?</br>  <br>I didn't say I didn't want to discuss it, I said lapping up shit characterization and then screaming like an autist isn't discussing the series.</br>  <br>Who is inconsistent? <br>And even if anon was wrong, he made a much better attempt at contributing to the thread than all the "hahaha autism" responses. Not one single reply addressed his actual post.</br></br>  I just fucking hate the YAAAAA noise she does after every sentence  <br>Kajo is literally worst girl though. I'm not watching for her terrible jokes and sense of humor.</br>  <br>What did you want the little girl voice?</br>  <br>Since I have to go soon, I'm going to assume you're talking about Tanukichi since that's what they were talking about before.<br><br> Why did he let Anna rape him? <br>He was completely shocked when this happened, and people have been known to freeze up in situations where they have no idea what to do. Also he already likes Anna, so maybe he just lets it happen for a bit even though he thinks it's wrong. I don't think this is particularly character-breaking.<br><br> Why did he start to fall for Kajou? <br>I'm a filthy anime-only secondary, so I haven't seen any indication of this in the anime. But if it's in the LN, I don't think it's that out of place either. Tanukichi was raised to love dirty jokes, so it wouldn't be surprising at all if he got some guilty pleasure out of the time he spent with her (in a world without dirty jokes). Also Kajou herself is a charismatic person, full of confidence and conviction in what she believes is right.<br><br> Why does he still like Anna even though he knows that she likes dirty things now? <br>Again I don't know anything about this yet, but maybe because he had mega-crush on her for so many years? Like Nadeko from Monogatari said, pining endlessly after someone is the safe and easy thing to do.<br><br>These are not definitive reasons to why Tanukichi acts the way he does, but just possible explanations. Maybe you can come up with better ones. Characters in media often do not act 100% rationally or the way I would do in their situation, but if I can offer a reasonable explanation for some weird things they do, then I don't have a problem with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THREAD KURUKO  <br>Also keep in mind Anna is strong as fuck. She could break something if he tried to resist.</br>   I love voices like hers.   <br>That's the only reason I started watching. <br><br>Someone posted a webm of fly sex<br><br>The rest is history</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same except it was this</br>   you will never have a squeeky-voiced little girl to shave your lower hair and dress you up as a girl <br><br>If their lewd-restricting world can even have that, then truly ours is the inferior one.</br></br>  <br>that webm make me want to fuck the smug out of her</br>  <br>Hnnng</br>  <br>We would not get along too well OP.</br>  <br>Actually, insulting literally everything about the show and its viewers is what's really autistic. If it rustles your jimmies this much, fucking drop the show, don't visit the threads anymore and keep your gob shut.<br><br>Nip character development has always been like this, for the most part.<br>In this particular case, it has nothing to do with sudden personality shifts but has everything to do with you not getting the show. Which is saying something considering that a) this is light-hearted comedy and b) they're fucking blatant about it.<br>Okuma was ostracized all his life because of what his father did, pure Anna saved him. He hates pervydad and loves puritanna. Then the first time they're seemingly alone together, he gets to know pervyanna and now has to balance his slowly lessening hatred of H (this is wrong but feels so gooood) with his love for the puritanna.<br>Of course he'd freak out. As you notice, he doesn't actually shout "no, no, no", he's just mortified by what's happening.<br><br>tl;dr: learn to read between the lines or gtfo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I like Anna <br> oh she wants me? <br> well I only want her because she's pure <br> let's ignore that I started falling for the lewd terrorist <br> and also ignore that despite the shock of rape wearing off, I'll still like Anna despite knowing she's lewd, but won't make a move despite knowing she likes me <br>Don't pretend for a second that what the author is doing is ok characterization. It's horrible writing used to justify status quo maintenance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So how long until we get  Gorrilla x Okuma Crossdressing  doujins?  I don't get it.<br><br>You were all fine with this thing</br></br>  <br> gtfo <br>Jesus Christ where do you idiots come from?<br><br> I-I'm not autistic! <br>Ok.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complains about autists <br> posts literally the most autistic comment in the entire thread </br></br>  <br> I like Anna <br> Holy shit my stalker just broke into my house and tied me up <br> Holy shit it's Anna.

You shouldn't.<br><br><br> I don't know how to respond to any of this so you're autistic hahahahha </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quoting the anon who tried rationalizing the shitty writing is fine, but it doesn't make it any less stupid.<br> you're just taking it too seriously! <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  "I don't get it so it's terrible writing" isn't a compelling argument either  <br>please fuck off back to /v/</br>  <br><br> Using gtfo is ok <br>No you fucking faggots. Go back to whichever website you came from.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't get it <br>There's nothing to get. People have explicitly stated that they understand what the LN says, and how that differs from what it shows. Why do idiots think that stating "you just couldn't get this extremely shallow exposition or characterization" holds any weight as an argument? You're not shedding any insight on the characters or story, you're just saying that you took it all at face value and don't care to actually think about the writing.</br></br>  <br> whenever I see anything I don't like, don't agree with, a sentence, a verb, writting, anything ever created I'll tell people to go back to wherever </br>  <br>What if they're from /a/ n</br>  <br> I think using acronyms like I'm on Gaia or MAL is ok <br>Seriously, stop pretending you've been here for more than 20 minutes.</br></br>  assei nante buttobashite<br>sunao ni nacchae horehore iinda do?<br>jinsei ouka bonnou no fire<br>kokoro no sakebi dashitai yone zenbu<br>karada no shin kara icchaimasu<br><br>AHA~N!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thinks acronyms have something to do with how long anyone's been here <br><br>I'm sorry, are you actually retarded or just pretending to be?</br></br></br>  <br> Thinking acronyms are acceptable here <br>Just stop.</br></br>  <br> implying they aren't <br>Just stop.<br><br>Also I've seen trolls so much more better than you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to use some old /b/ trolling and botch the grammar to show off my oldfag cred <br>You're not impressing anyone, and acronyms will never be ok.</br></br>  <br>Some people just want to have sex after getting to know them better and maybe even after marriage anon. I know that people like you have no moral standards and would fuck a cow if it were to put its vagina on your dick but not everyone is like you.</br>  <br>Meh I though you were going to be at least vaguely original, but you're just spouting the same thing over and over again</br>  <br>Some of them are acceptable, like NTR (not really an acronym, though) or DFC, but GTFO should stay in /b/, like tbh in /sp/ and JUST in /tv/.</br>  <br> you're just a manwhore normalfag with no standards <br>No. When the girl who you're in love with suddenly wants to be with you, the response isn't "nani?!"<br><br>But you're right. I'm sure it was just the initial shock of her aggressiveness, and that next week he'll ask her out and they'll spend time together and foster a beautiful relationship, and he won't definitely ignore her feelings for him and drag out the same fucking non development home over and over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the ffff cutest anime character I have seen.</br>  Haha, this is a great thread. Here, I can see there are lots of /a/nons who are so alpha, they will have sex with every girl that they love and also love them back :^)  <br> would drop the sales <br>Then why there are lots of doujinshi where the MC fucks the girl?<br>Doujinshi consumed by otaku, right? It's mostly even produced by otaku too.<br>This anon is more correct. Or it will be heavily censored.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh Jesus, keep your no true scotsman bullshit to yourself already. I swear it's patently obvious you're the same basement-dwelling freak I've been arguing with for like three days in a row about the same bullshit topics and all you can do is just spew the same bullshit over and over again. How is it even possible to have so much bile stored up, what happened to mess your life up this bad? If literally everyone but you on this goddamn board doesn't belong here according to your views, don't you think by now you should go and find another board to stay on? Or, i don't know, maybe a whole nother website altogether?<br>You keep on bitching how nobody has any reply to you and how they just insult you and have done, yet  you do the exact same thing, insulting people if you have no actual comebacks.<br><br>I am honestly curious which small detail about my post you are going to lambast this time because you have no actual response. My writing, my grammar, my abbreviations, maybe the pic, or maybe you'll simply call me an autist again, thus proving everything I've said in this post so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like her and her voice.<br>Would be her slave.</br>  <br> Only alphas have sex with a girl they're in love with who loves them back <br>You can try to satirize it all you want, but that's not "hurt alphas" that's literal autism.</br></br>  <br>But I'm not him. I understand his point though (yet not share it entirely), emoticons should not be posted here, watermarked images, acronyms that aren't relevant to the board, links to kissanime, crunchyroll, sample images, etc. Of course, there are some exceptions, and most anons behave accordingly so I don't really care if some crossies feel lost when someone complains about this.</br>  <br> logical fallacies <br>You missed /v/ by a few clicks.</br></br>  <br>This anon gets it.</br>  <br><br>It would be like lolidom, but legal.</br></br>  <br>Oh yes, thank you for reminding me. You simply tell me to go back to /v/ again, the one thing I did not anticipate.<br><br>And because I'm sick and tired of your sorry ass, I'll give you what I believe to be the perfect insult for your fat ass:<br><br>You know you lowlife, I get the feeling you're the one who belongs on /v/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's it like living with autism?</br>  <br>Why do you ask me? You should have a wizard's lifespan of experience with it already.<br><br>Also, I am amazed at how quickly you're running out of insults. In this thread alone, you've called me autistic three times. Broken record, much?</br></br></br>   implying /a/ knows what being autistic actually entails   <br>Actually the dozen or so posts calling you autistic were different people. The fact that you accused me of being someone you argued with for three days means you're literally arguing in circles with different people and blowing a gasket over it. That's why I called you autistic.</br>  <br>It's a meme, you dip</br>   This is why I like manga threads.   <br>No, fuck that noise. "It's a meme" is not an acceptable excuse anymore.<br><br> that's not what slut means <br> It's a meme, you dip <br><br> that's not what pure means, either <br> It's a meme, you dip <br><br> that's not what being autistic means <br> It's a meme, you dip <br><br>You can't just call everything a meme and have done. Just as Muslims can't simply say "that's not Islam" about terrorists anymore. No, it's not just a meme, it's fundamental ignorance. Autism isn't a meme, it's an actual fucking condition and just because your meme-definition clashes with the actual definition doesn't mean you can simply say<br> It's a meme, you dip <br>and have done?<br><br> inb4 you mad? <br>Yes, I mad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, keep samefagging.</br>  <br>I was just shitposting, I'm sorry if I triggered you.<br><br>Some anons just force autism as an insult.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Autist anon, try to keep the samefagging more than a minute apart.</br></br>  Do people actually think she's attractive?<br><br>She's the ugliest character of the season, even worse than that mutant hamster child.</br></br>  <br>She had me from the moment she told MC to be her pet and collared him.

Just play with your Legos like a good boy.</br></br></br>  <br>P4 was a charmingly, stylishly executed game with borderline-autism (SMT main series being full autism) game mechanics. P4 anime was all of that, except actually none of that, plus dogshit.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/<wbr>611229178596233218<br><br>Too sexualised character to be taken seriously.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>It was charming and stylish, front to back. It also presented you with a world almost devoid of likable characters.<br><br>Take Yukiko for example, whose entire Social Link is about her finding out she's a gentle and compassionate classy lady who's nonetheless approachable. Yet for the entire game she acts like a haughty bitch who forces her almost-lethal cooking on people in a manner very similar to how Anna almost raped Okuma.<br>Add in all the homophobia surrounding Kanji, the whole misandrist humor (remember when Brosuke and MC were tossed into the river because they dared to compliment Yukiko and Chie and then King Moron puked into the river? Because I sure as fuck remember) and a lot of completely retarded Japanese story tropes and... yeah. <br><br>And with that mindset, I expected to still enjoy Persona Q...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>P3 FES is easily the best. I have high hopes for P5.</br>  <br>Why did you have to ruin /a/ by being so fucking gay?</br>  <br>Oh fucking hell. This is worse than tumblr. Now I know why I never jumped on the twitter bandwagon. They're even complaining about waifu-mentality like they know what they're talking about.</br>  <br>I still have FES lying around here. I've played through P3P like four times. Am I missing much by not playing FES?<br><br>I'm really excited about P5, too.

I don't know how you'll feel about it after playing p3p that many times, so I don't know if I'd recommend a play through.</br>  <br>I tell myself I'm not going to take the bait but I keep reading it and it keeps making me mad.</br>  <br>I was merely pretending, I'm sorry anon.</br>  <br> I'm not sure if he's overdoing the commas or just using correct grammar but I've already outed myself as a huge flaming faggot so I might as well call him out on it and see what happens <br>nice b8, m8, I r8 8/8.</br></br>  <br>Main problem was I started FES by playing The Answer because I thought fuck it, I know the original story, might as well just try what's new.<br><br>Then I spent about two hours staring at the Game Over screen. Yeesh.</br></br></br>  <br> homophobia <br> misandrist humor <br><br>could you please not</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure know how to argue.</br>  <br>Not him, but he was right. You have no idea how to use a comma.</br>  <br>Epic spongebob reaction image friend but /v/ is a couple boards over.</br>  <br>Must be hard posting on /a/ when people trigger your autism this often.</br>  <br>I'm fapping to maximum capacity</br>  <br> What's the point of this thing? <br>She does not know yet that she desires him?</br></br>   argument <br><br>All me.</br></br>      Look at this cutie  <br>So cute, pure, and innocent</br>  <br>I've said it once, I'll say it again: Binkan-chan is best girl and deserves more screentime.</br>  <br>Most boys will acts pretty awkwardly if something like that happened to them.</br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br> most teenage boys will act awkwardly when an attractive girl they have feelings for comes on to them <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>Yes, especially if you believe said attractive girl wasn't interesting in any such stuff. Normal boys don't react quite like THAT, but normal girls don't exactly jump you, tie you up, rip off your shirt and lick you all over.</br>  <br>I hate to shatter your bubble, but yes they get that aggressive when they're horny.</br>  <br>I have to agree with OP here, I mean Kuroko's voice would fit perfectly for this character but this time the voice actor is pushing it a bit too much and "that" voice just sounds silly, and not lady-like, like Kuroko.</br>  <br>Takes all kinds, I guess.</br>  <br>Probably because it's not meant to sound lady-like, Otome refers to herself as "washi", the "old woman"-first person pronoun. That has nothing to do with the VA, it's just her character. So, if the character actually talks like an old woman, a VA who's good at "cultured lady" and "old woman" would naturally go for "old woman". It's just the way the character is, you can like or dislike Otome, but her VA is actually a perfect fit.</br>  <br>Oh well, guess I can't argue with that.</br>  <br><br>they get playful but not aggressive, 3DPD whores always pretend to be horny and that they like something in bed, thats why ANNAs pureness is perfect and shes the best girl</br></br>  <br>But they do.

After living with his uncle and his aunt for some time, he finally moves to another city to live alone and goes to a new school. He's pretty much bored about everything, so he's really calm and serious. In his new school, he meets RandomGirl, and they become friends easily on the first day. RandomGirl is really cute and friendly, without a reason. After a month, they start dating.<br><br>After a week, on his way home, MC-kun is killed on the streets by RandomGirl, only to wake up on a strange house the next day. RandomGirl explains the situation; MC-kun was destined to die on an accident, but he was killed by RG instead. Why? There was a huge accident that took the life of 100 children some years ago, but God tried to give them another chance. They had until -1 year after the current events- to hunt and kill 1000 Monsters (I don't know how to name them) or else, they'll die again. RG's objective is to kill and raise a team of killers, to hunt these monsters and raise her points. One monster is 1 point, so she needs to kill 1000, and they become stronger every day. But there's a trick; if you kill other children that were on the accident, you gain 100 points. Now, all of these children are trying to kill each other. RG will raise a team to kill all of them and gain her own salvation; a selfish wish. With every person she kills before their original death, she wins a new zombie-ally, someone who's stronger than any normal human, at the cost of their life. She will hunt innocent lives of people like MC just to kill her old friends.<br><br>"You will help me take back my life, right? I'm your girlfriend after all!

He is an upstanding member of the community who has many credible character testimonies that will prove his content of character. <br><br>As for the destruction of public property. I hardly believe being "bitchkicked" into a highway counts as willful damage. Even in a situation where his life was in such danger, he refused to throw a punch against his assailant. If this doesn't show great character, I don't know what does. <br><br>In closing, my client is being falsely accused and it is within this court's best interests in the pursuit of justice to absolve my client of his charges and let him go free to continue to be an upstanding member of the community.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A woman over the age of 40 having a child has something like 3 times the chance of defect than first generation sibling incest.<br><br>While having a child so late is odd, I don't think many people would call it "human garbage".<br><br>So what you're saying is that it's bad because you find it yucky, yes?

It would be hard not to watch regardless of whether or not one is a lolicon.</br>  <br>Funny thing is, he could serve multiple life sentences.</br>  <br>It's also hard to get aroused when you're discussing life and death matters as well as having an existential crisis.</br>  Why do Beefags and Phoenixfags enjoy NTR?  <br>Where did you even get that from?</br>  <br>Because they know an incestuous relationship is immoral to begin with.</br>  <br>Both Bee and Phoenix have boyfriends.</br>  <br>You mean their made up boyfriends?</br>  <br> Taking a page out of a doujin as canon </br>  <br> It's soft NTR </br>  <br>nopan&gt;pan</br>  <br>I don't think it matters much considering there isn't even official art of their supposed boyfriends.</br>  <br><br>Even if they don't exist, Araragi has no way of knowing and still chases after his sisters.</br></br>  <br>the best pantsu are not pantsu.</br>  <br>Araragi's development was in Kizu, with more coming in Owari.</br>  <br>Kizu never.</br>  <br> normale Hanekawa  <br>borring and unappealing in every way<br> Black Hanekawa  <br>made for sex <br><br>Why are boys the best girls?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Posting some snake for the lads  <br>fuck off back to reddit</br>  <br> .gif <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br>How did they get away with that?</br>  <br> Normal Hanekawa is unappealing in every way <br>How do you even?<br>Do you even?<br>I don't think you even.<br><br>Hanekawa is 100% pure sex in every shade and tint.

When I turned around, I thought Hachikuji would be bra-less and in bloomers and got excited <br>To think there were anons arguing over Araragi being a lolicon or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty good.</br>  <br>How is Hachikuji is aware of pornography?</br>  How old is Yotsugi?<br>They never mention it. Some anon in the thread says she's over 100 but I don't know where he got that information.</br>  <br>She haunts the lost and masturbating.</br>  <br> To think there were anons arguing over Araragi being a lolicon or not. <br>it's just a hachikuji thing because she's well developed for her age. <br>his words.</br></br></br>  <br>She probably haunted more than one NEET or pervert.</br>  Reminder that this exists.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Restaurant in Australia I think.</br>    This thread needs some spice.  <br>that never happened.</br>  <br>yuh huhn... it mentally scarred her and now the site of men with ahoge make her want to take them home for "tea".</br>  <br>sight*<br>sigh, time for me to go to bed.</br></br>  <br><br>But do they sell anything with crab in it?

Like, anywhere? Pedophilia sure, but two minors?</br></br>  <br>no, as long as he's under 18 he can legally fug... 14 year olds I think? But about that it's only 16+. At least where I live. And if he's 17 he can fuck 13 year olds.</br>  <br>Underage sex is illegal in some countries.<br>The parents can even sue each other childs if they want claiming that one raped the other.</br></br>  araragi was sexually molested multiple times by by adult women who were born AT LEAST 5 years before him<br>he's the victim here and must have severe mental traumas</br>  <br>If he has mental scars from getting his dick bitten off that's his fault.</br>  <br>bet he would go full vampire to get it to grow back</br>  <br>His regeneration is more than enough already.</br>  <br>NisioIsin does.</br>  Would the toothbrushing scene count as statutory rape?  <br>Probably not, since it's Japan.

Monkey and bee best girls, prove me wrong.  <br>Her corpse is over 100 years old, but she's not exactly the child said corpse belonged to, but rather the "spirit" of the corpse. <br><br>It's based off the old Japanese superstition that any object that endures for 100 years becomes a kami/spirit and Yotsugi's handler whose name I forget pretty explicitly stated that they created Yotsugi by trying to artificially force a kami onto a 100 year old child's corpse</br></br></br>  <br>The first season is super dialogue heavy with like 6-8 scenes an episode. Second season was worth it just for fire sisters though.</br>  <br>The dialogue was much more interesting than the fan service of the next arcs though. The dialogue and cinematography was what kept me watching, now it's mostly just a chore.</br>  <br>He is a vampire. He has rights...

I don't remember if the corpse was over 100, but I do know that a tool used for over 100 years is supposed to gain its own soul.</br>  <br>I have a feeling someone is going to get pollinated.</br>  <br>And unlike a corpse, she can eat ice cream.</br>  <br> wanting waifu wars </br>  <br>He must get some fucking unbearable weebs visiting.</br>  <br>this also applies to 4chan you retard<br>two sides of the same coin</br></br>  <br><br>he didn't fuck yotsugi though<br>so necrophilia is irrelevant<br>unless you count looking up her skirt as a sexual intercourse<br>he only ever got to fuck hitagi and even that is only implied like once</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but did Yotsugi fuck him?<br><br>Maybe her and Snail took turns while he was sleeping.</br></br></br>  <br>And now we should call the witnesses aren't we?</br>  <br>He used his naked muscles to arouse my girlhood.</br>  <br>She's bland as fuck anon.</br>   It's been a while since a monogatari thread wasn't raided by Karen-chan   <br>Karenfags are still around, we just sort of dropped the fag part.</br>  <br>He did kiss her tho</br>  <br>He did fuck Karen after the toothbrush scene tho</br>  <br>Karen is my bitch</br>  <br><br>I was referring to that  Kaiki hater dude. </br></br>  <br>come at me</br>    <br><br> bland <br> a girl who trains a fledgling vampire with comic books and tropes from them <br> took one for the team to give him advice for a fight, getting cut in half <br> teases him about his class rep porn <br> talks him out of suicide with a rousing speech, lets him borrow her panties to cheer his ass up, with a brofist to become better friends in the next semester <br> bland  <br><br>And that was only Kizu, Shaft is just bad for taking out all the good Hanekawa jokes she has with Araragi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's more of just a slut in Kizu than anything positive though.</br></br>  <br>You're waifu a slut.</br>  <br><br>Kizu hasn't aired, she seems cool though. As it stands now, she's blannnd.</br></br>  <br> as it is now <br>I forgot that /a/ doesn't read anymore.</br></br>  <br>I don't trust fan translations.</br>  <br>I bet the rubber from her boots give a distinctive odor to her feet.</br>  <br>You can't really deny that she was bland for a good while, though, seeing as that was like her whole problem. She repressed herself so hard that all that was left was bland, pure whiteness and she did it so hard it spawned two separate aberrations</br>  <br>Only one aberration was spawned due to that.</br>  <br>Cat only stuck to her the way it did precisely because she was so bland and became her dark side as a way of venting all that backed up stress. Tiger was created wholesale thanks to her repressed envy</br>  <br>I'm hard now.</br>  <br><br>You can't really hate on Hanekawa though. If it wasn't for Black Hanekawa forcing the words out of Araragi's mouth he would've never found Shinobu and Route B would be the truth when Araragi got himself killed by something when he couldn't shift into vamp mode.</br></br>  <br>Nadeko still collecting boomerangs i see.</br>  <br>I bet she tried to throw her old one away.</br>  <br>I'm not the guy who originally hated on her and I actually really like her progression as a character, but you still can't deny that she was pretty damn bland for a good long while. To do so kinda spits in the face of how far she's come once she does start bantering and acting mischievous later on in the series.</br>  <br><br>Regardless of anything you can deny or can't deny. The striped hair Hanekawa is the worse hairstyle ever. It doesn't even make sense, considering the aberrations were her own emotions in the first place. It's not like she absorbed someone elses.</br></br>  <br>I don't like the look of it much myself, but it sorta makes sense. She had rejected them so utterly up until that point that they had become a separate entity and to accept that darker side of herself as a part of herself, she had to acknowledge that she will indeed change as a person.<br><br>The tiger stripes is just a physical manifestation of that spiritual change</br></br></br>  snaek is lewdest girl  <br>What a darling.</br>  <br><br>Snake is a selfish little shit.</br></br>  <br>And that's what I like about her.</br>  <br><br>Good on you then.<br><br>I personally like my girls mature in thought, but I'm also into loli. So Shinobu or Mayoi are literally the only choices.</br></br></br></br>  PV soon.  <br>PV when?</br>  <br>PV never.</br>    <br>She's that kinky</br>  <br>You're kinky.</br>  <br>She's always being a deviant girl</br>  <br>I mean, just look online.

Don't lie to these people!<br><br>This is the truth of the matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No jury would convict a cool guy like him.</br>  <br>Banana butt boy? is that you?<br><br>Why arent you in your room with the other people who believe conmen and liars?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yay, the idiot has arrived.</br></br>  <br>Banana but boy has been around for a while, he comes from cuck tumblr, since he obviously try to rationalise his fetish.<br><br>His yaoi boyfriend isn't dead because my emotions overrule logic!</br></br></br>  <br><br>But Kaiki isn't dead because he's alive in Hana.</br></br>  <br>Stop that. <br><br> I do think i'm gonna start calling people banana butt boy from now on though. </br></br></br>  <br><br>You should start using a name so people can block your posts though. You disrupt the people posting cute grills.</br></br>  <br>You special anon? I was telling him to stop responding to karen.</br>  <br>Hana is before s2.<br><br>Also logic would tell he is dead in the same way a conman and liar would...well continue to lie and try to get the trust of people? Its not rocket science.<br><br>Thats why he broke up hitagis parents for the same reason he stole those childrens money, for shits and giggles and that he wanted their money. It would be most probable that he stole as much money from them as possible since hitagi says he was responsible for breaking them up, but also tricked her into beliving he could cure her of the crab spirit.<br>Then he stole her money.<br>A conman and liar who steals from children and has done simular con jobs and is a pathalogical liar suddenly lies again to his benifit when reason would overtell no person would do said thing and thus its just a lie and fabrication and excuse to cover up his theft like all OTHER thefts he did?<br><br>NO FUCKING WAY!<br>Of course the only other way he could break them up is by indicatio of the makeup he uses. That he is a yaoi boy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why respond to butt boy then if he prefer his cuck homo fetish then?</br>  <br><br>Hana is in Season 3 actually, and it's the last story in Monogatari. It's the ending.</br></br>  <br>Keeps him distracted so people wont take him seriously. Even if the lack of reason on why anyone would want to be a cuck is beyond me there are people who seriously is into NTR shit like that.</br>  I'm sick of this faggot. Post some monkey.  What's with the lack of tall girls in anime? They pander to DFCfags, Cowtitsfags, lolifags etc yet tall girls are still a rarity nowdays.  Patience, anon. The amount of tall / "giant" girls has been steadily increasing over the past couple of years.  hassyaku-sama...<br><br>Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po Po.........</br></br>  KLOAH<br>WHEN</br>  <br>fucking manlets</br>  <br>This is now an elf thread.</br>  What went wrong?  <br>everything</br>  Everything.  <br>Everything</br>   another thread to shit on this show <br>Why?<br><br><br><br><br>Nothing went wrong</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So far there's really nothing wrong with it.<br><br>It should get better once Alisa's arc starts and we get to the actual story in this instead of just introducing the characters and shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br> seriously trying to defend this piece of shit </br></br>  CG shit  <br>Animation<br><br>I got actual headaches from watching the animation. Too much slow-mo and non-action. It feels like the studio is stretched too thin for its own good</br></br></br>  <br>It's a mediocre anime adaptation of a mediocre video game that Sony put together after they lost Monster Hunter.</br>  <br>Amazing memes, keep it up</br>  <br>Its entertaining and the MC seems decent, not like most dense, whiny, for the power of friendship MCs.<br><br>Why can't this other anon like it as well?</br></br></br>  Too much slow-mo.  Only one episode with the best girl<br> A good enough episode to make the show one of the AOTS<br>Fuck you OP</br> </br>  shit sauce material  <br>more please.</br>  Its a video game adaptation. What were you expecting?<br>Its better than UBW, at least.</br>  <br>Anything is better than a VN with porn.</br>  Shit source material, letting Hirao with his extremely liberal use of slow motion and cuhrazee camera direct, etc.<br><br>At least it means that he probably won't have anything to do with HF movies since they won't want to stretch him too thin. Thank god.</br></br>  <br> VN with porn <br>If ONLY they adapted the one with the porn...</br></br>  <br> Alisa will never lock you with her tights <br>Why live</br></br>  <br>shit artstyle, couldn't even watch episode 1</br>  <br>The slow motion shit is retarded but I liked it  when it wasn't full of QUALITY  during the action scenes.</br>  <br> I prefer rhinos, no details no shading and boring direction <br><br>You're the fucking cancer.<br>Let the guy actually be creative however he want, that make things interesting visually for once, holy shit. Are you a Bamco corporate fuck or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying UBW direction was good. <br><br>Anon you're a cancerous Fatefag if you believe the direction of UBW is better than God Eater. God Eater has a much superior direction than UBW has ever had. Fuck, even the music in God Eater is much better than the shit in UBW. UBW wished it had Hirao direct it. I'm also fucking glad he ain't going to direct Heaven Feels which is complete shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything.</br>  <br>Nothing.<br>This alone made the entire thing worth it to me so far</br></br>  <br> png </br>  <br> Sony <br>It was Bandai Namco. Sony had nothing to do with it</br></br>  <br> People aren't allowed to defend what they like because me and some other people have decided to call it shit, and since we're special snowflakes descendats of God who know the truth of everything, our word is absolute <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Now if only Hirao got a proper FUCKING schedule and staff<br>But yeah it still looks way better even in such a clusterfuck production. Only absolute retards get triggered over the slow-mo and miss everything else</br></br>  <br> Are you a Bamco corporate fuck or something? <br>No, I just don't like shitty action scenes like you fags.</br></br>  <br>Zenbu</br>  <br>Kek.<br><br>Nothing so far, the story seems promising and the different animation style is refreshing.</br></br></br>  <br>Eric's death wasn't humorous, everybody seems edgier, not enough Kanon or Gina</br>  <br>So you liked most of God Eater so far then, that's good anon.</br>  <br>Art style is great, plot is slower than watching paint dry.<br>Made me pick up the games though so it's at least good advertisement.</br></br>  <br> People are allowed to have their own opinion* <br>Sorry I didn't realize this was a Thoughtcrime Free Zone™<br><br> *as long as it is the same as mine </br></br></br></br>  <br>Even when he's not abusing slow-mo the action scenes aren't anything to get worked up about. Though I guess in that sense it's an accurate adaption since the game is just as boring.<br><br>Really, the artstyle is the only thing this show has going for it.</br></br></br>  <br>I always mix up God Eater and Soul Sacrifice. Regardless they are both mediocre.</br>  Does Slaine get bullied in jail?  Nah, he bullies himself enough. The question is will he get better or will he find a way to kill himself despite being under constant surveillance?  I'd go to jail just so I could bully him.<br>Slaine is one of the most fuckable characters I've ever seen.</br>  <br>I give him 1 year before he realizes it's never going to get better and ends it all.</br>  <br>This show had some really fuckable boys.</br>  Is Hyouka still strong? <br><br>The love for one of the best anime of the last 5 years hasn't gone down, has it?</br></br>  <br>Since everyone was calling it boring, I went into thinking it was a bunch of retards who didn't handle not being spoonfed.<br><br>I went into it expecting a substantive and thought-provoking show that didn't coddle its viewers, but I didn't get any of that. I got a genuinely boring show with nice animation and pretty art. <br><br>They were right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what other KyoAni show dedicates that much time towards it and handles it as seriously as it does in Hyouka other than Hibike.</br>  <br>Now that the reverse bait has been thrown, can the hater leave?</br>  <br>The entire plot of two seasons of Free?</br>  <br>Except that the whole point of the series was about Oreki developing from a lazy ass/insufferable edgelord to a functional human being with his own goals and motivations, and each arc/mystery helps developing him.</br>  I'm trying to watch the Psycho pass movie with te anon subs but....<br><br>THE FUCKING ENGRISH<br><br>SO GODAMN DISTRACTING<br><br>I tried reading the subs outloud to distract myself but it's just too fucking awful. Why did they even bother forcing the obviously monolingual japanese voice actors to speak english? Why not Japanese and pretend its another language? American movies do it all the time. It's obviooiusly inferior to having foreign characters speaking the actual language, but definitely is better than whatever the fuck this shit is. It's unlistenable it's so distractingly bad.<br><br>It's *kind of* close to the subs but is still incomprehensible, but still vaguely sounds like english. So I'll stop reading the subs for a moment because "oh its similar", but then a second later i realize again that its totally retarded shit and then miss details on what's happening.<br><br>WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!!??!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why is Yayoi so cute?  <br>No.</br>  <br>I think the engrish is just supposed to sound cool and they really only understand every other word.</br>  <br>I'm a native English speaker (Ontario here)<br><br>The English was so terrible, and the subtitles that went full 'let's just rewrite the dialogue so it kind of makes a bit more sense' didn't help because it made me have to focus even more on the already garbage Engrish to see if the subs were missing anything</br></br></br>  <br>I managed to resolve it with one command line.<br><br> sudo apt-get purge vlc | sudo apt-get install mpv</br></br></br>  This thread is full of ordinary posts so that anons can fully enjoy how cute the girls are.  <br>How many times have you beamed Joshiraku directly inside you brain, /a/?</br>  Don Doko Doko Doko  <br>I wish I was due for a rewatch.</br>    Why isn't there a second season ;_;<br><br>Also this show was too japanese for me</br></br></blockquote>]
