So they are covered. <br>Brown or green would work better than black, especially if temperature was a concern. But I can assume that stealth was a concern and that black is supposedly meant to be suitable for it. <br><br>What about it is really all that illogical? The flower? Out of what we have seen of the main cast hers is probably the most minimalistic and "logical" one yet. <br>Adlet's have all kinds of straps and leather and whatever attached to it that doesn't make much sense. <br>Nashetania looks like a cabaret dancer.

Pitou, Youpi, and the king all have personalities that change drastically in different ways and I found it interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The antagonists are all shit characters. On top of being unlikable and uninteresting their only traits are being OP and loving their King who is also dull as dirt <br><br>This is the main reason I couldn't stand this arc. The Chimera Ants themselves are shit characters and its even worse when they take up the majority of screentime.
