He just convinced Iroha to become one and tricked YY to not go to the election</br>  <br><br><br>I've read the LNs, so I know about the Yukino poetry and that 8man has admitted to Yui being "cute" a couple of times. <br><br>Another hint is Hayama-&gt;Orimoto when he tells her that 8man hangs around a higher class of ladies. But I don't think this included Iroha at that point.<br><br>So yeah, I'm still not sure about this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not physically, her appeal is in her personality basically. WW probably went out of his way to remove as many "main heroine traits" from her as possible, so that it'll be wrong as expected when she wins the romcom over archetypes such as ultra-popular genki and rich troubled kuudere who both had a fated encounter with the protagonist before the start of the story.</br>  <br>So Chihiro all over again?</br>  <br>Yes.<br> Hopefully </br></br>  <br>Probably. I never finished TWGOK though.</br>  <br>tbh, Iroha is a lot more interesting.</br>  <br>Nah, Keima really liked Chihiro and was very aware of it.</br>  <br>Chihiro end was expected though</br>  <br>I like that both TWGOK and Oregairu have GENUINE imoutos (even though Elsie wasn't related to Keima till the end).</br>  <br>She is getting many flags right now, so who knows.</br>  <br>8man is pretty close. He likes Iroha but is in denial about it.</br>  <br>Even if 8man liked any of the girls, there's no way he'd admit it, even to himself.</br>  <br> self insert this hard <br>as expected from WW.</br></br>  <br>Rough TL, from page 195 of volume 11, just after she gives him cookies.<br> "If I was my older self I'd already have fallen for her act." <br>Sounds awfully like denial to me. Not that he has fallen for her or anything, but rather that he already feels something.</br></br></br>  <br>That sounds awfully familiar.</br>  <br>meant to quote<br><br><br>fucking off by one error.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He said it also for Yui in Volume 5 and Sensei.</br>  <br>And I'll be waiting.</br>  <br>His older self would have fallen in love with any girl who gave him attention. <br>His nice girl monologue shows how he has changed and why he didn't fall in love with Yui once she started talking to him</br></br>  <br>He likes only SakiSaki</br>  Has Yuki ever been a recipient of the "fall for her" monologue? I dont think she has been  <br>Vol 1</br>  <br>First meeting with yukino<br><br> The sound of the second hand moving in the wall clock went by awfully slow, making it all the more audible. Come on, you’ve got to be kidding me. What’s with this sudden romantic comedy-like development? Things are getting ridiculously tense in here. I have no complaints regarding the situation. Unexpectedly, a bittersweet memory from junior high school came back to me.  <br><br> Never again will I have feelings such as those, and with much effort I was able to move on since then. In order to avoid getting involved in these romantic comedy-like situations, I have made it my upmost priority to be hated. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but for the sake of my own pride, I no longer need any feelings of good will and the like! </br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone compiled all the translated volumes? Spyro has done a nice job, but I see no download links anywhere.  <br>He really hasn't grown to accept nice girls though.<br><br>His latest development wasn't to accept Yui for being a nice girl, it was to say she wasn't a nice girl at all.<br><br>8man still has issues.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone  except Sagami  have that "fall for her" moment. Either its 8man common thought pattern or Watari dull writing skill.</br>  <br><br>Think she would be able to take in all 8 inches?</br></br>  <br>Sagami end confirmed?</br>  <br>There is a mediafire folder. Search the /a/rchives</br>  <br><br>Yes and no. That of Sensei and Yui were among the lines of "I'd have fallen for her" as in implying something like this "My older self would eventually fall for her"<br>That of Iroha as posted above is among the lines of "My older self would already have fallen for her". <br>They're similar indeed, but not quite.<br>That's why I said that he's already in denial about feeling at least something for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  This shitty drama poop serie is beyond retardation already dropped it what a fucking stupid shit God damn  <br><br><br>Ahh yeah I reread it; she gets the I wont fall into the romcom trap as well. <br><br>I didnt recall it because Yui/Iroha were recipients of that monologue on more than one occasion but Yuki apparantly got it just that once</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should have known, thanks.</br>  <br>I'm still fucking mad.</br>  <br>She doesn't even appear in the main story, poor girl.</br>  <br> he's already in denial about feeling at least something for her. <br><br>I love the way you're thinking.</br></br></br>  <br>No matter how many flags or how many times Hachiman perceive Yui; he'll still end up with Yukino. <br><br>Volume eleven Hachiman may have sought and perceive Yui favourably (of course, if spoilers is to go by anything) but otherwise volume twelve will set up a situation where Hachiman will accept Yukino. <br><br>Watari is a cocktease.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Yui's were based on "If I was anyone else I'd have fallen for her just now" So the implication there is the same, it's just that he's using a different "target" to push his feelings off on.</br>  <br>I doubt he'd do something that repetitive without it being intentional. His subtext is actually pretty solid.</br>  <br>I can't believe they didn't. Yui and Yukino were probably staring at him the whole time</br>  <br>They were talking about Iroha, bruh.</br>  What is Yukino's request? Is it for the D?  <br>To drop her mom from the train</br>  <br>I want 3rd Season of Anime</br>  <br>"We could share"</br>  <br>Everyone? Even Komachi?</br>  <br>Hiring Yui to do "the job"</br>  <br>Komachi is along the line of "I would rape her if we're not blood related".</br>  <br>"I would marry her if she wasn't my sister." The following line is he commenting sister is like a wife without all the hassle.<br><br>Komachi best sister ever.</br></br></br>  God Yukino was pathetic this ep  <br>People in Japan marry so they can become family. But sisters are family already.</br>  <br>I still don't know what is it her mom wants her to do or why is she living alone.</br>  <br>That's the reason why I want to protect her.</br>  <br>whensheseesthe8inches.png</br>  <br>This explains the disappearance of Iroha in the later half of vol. 11.</br>  <br>you aren't supposed to fuck your sister, though.<br><br>Except in hentai.</br></br></br>  <br>But didn't you like her because she was strong and independent? She's nothing like her former self.</br>  <br>She didn't know how 8man would react when she gives him the choco so it's understandable</br>  <br>Couples stop fucking when they marry though, except for the purpose of procreation. Japan is that fucked up.</br>  <br> strong and independent <br><br>Never existed.</br></br></br>  What are they talking about?<br><br> inb4 studying overseas. And Maruto come over to Watari's door bringing a lawyer. </br></br>  <br>Just like Chihiro disappeared entirely in the last arc.</br>  <br>She's probably thinks that the moment she gives it to him will reveal her feelings and she doesn't want that, because she wants to be independent and need no man. It doesn't work for her either way.</br>  <br>They didn't though. Also Chihiro all over again.</br>  The show is over and it's time for you fags to move on and stop posting in these threads  <br><br>Summer season hasn't started yet, nothing else to talk about.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I feel like on either side this is a pretty minor detail to be scrutinizing. Thematically there's some much bigger things to go over, like how 8man didn't blush even a single time during the entire sleepover/double date sequence, or when he reminded Yui of their date, or when Yui called him for said date.</br></br></br>  <br>Only apply for middle class families. The husband get so much stress (and tired from work) he doesn't have any motivation to fuck. I would become impotent too if I have to shoulder house loans, car loans, monthly living costs, child support etc. Just imagine you fucked at work and got fired at the result.</br>  <br>  wasnt even in the last episode <br>So that's why it felt so boring.</br></br>  <br>Ah, even still. I think Oregairu isn't the light novel to except any girl winning save for Yukino. It is not ground breaking despite it appearing different from the rest.</br>  <br> wrong as expected </br>  <br>Because in the volume 1 he said he didn't want a romantic comedy situation with Yukino. <br>If he falls for her, this is wrong as expected.</br></br>  <br>This is probably the biggest flag of the whole LN.</br>  <br> Because in the volume 1 he said he didn't want a romantic comedy situation with Yukino.  <br>You realize that's another romcom trope right?</br></br>  <br> if <br><br>he's already in love dense niggas</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, I forgot about that.</br>  <br>We'll know what was going on in 8man's head once the first part of vol 11 got translated. Also, not being bashful when inviting a girl on a date was very out of character of him. Because, in the LN he has been agonizing on how to invite a girl out.</br>  <br><br>What chapter of volume 5 was that? I'm trying to find it here but scrolling pages on an old book is not that easy.</br></br>  I'm glad this endless stream of pointless melodrama has come to an end.<br><br>S2 was absolutely revolting and boring in every aspect.</br></br>  <br>he fell out of love when he knows that she lies/dishonest about the car incident.</br>  <br>6</br>  <br>That wasn't 'love', that was admiration. Even he admits it to Haruno</br>  <br>8man blushing is an extremely touchy subject though, because it's a poor reflection of how he thinks and reacts in the LNs.<br><br> Also one could probably make an argument that since he blushed more around Yui in S1 that he's grown to accept her advances and simply no longer feels embarrassed by him, but I'm feeling too lazy to do it right now. <br> Okay I'll make one point in that direction. Since Watari seems to be trying to take this in a more serious direction, it feels appropriate that 8man's prime romantic candidate is the woman he is most comfortable being with, rather than using a more immature reaction like getting the most flustered with her as a measuring stick. <br><br><br>Chapter 6, though I'm pretty sure he's had one or two similar monologues about Yui prior to that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He thought she was something above the normal person but that brought him back to reality.</br>  <br>Train scene in Vol 5 Title of chap has Yuigahama in it. Ep 9 I think of the anime</br>  <br>8man isn't comfortable around anyone</br>  <br>8man spoke of Orimoto.</br>  <br>Yet anon, us Oregairufags still have to over analyze the ambiguity of genuine, the character motives, their words, their existence and why they want to form bonds that are not superficial.<br><br>Oregairu is a scholary novel, meant for academia, it is philosophical and deeply rooted in psyhology, it deserve my recognition. <br><br>Watari is a genius.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> first girl <br> fateful meeting before the story started <br> "that X-dere bitch! I swear I'll never develop a positive relationship with her!" <br><br> wrong as expected <br><br>Did you also think Chitoge had a bad start in the Rakubowl? Yukino doesn't have a chance in hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welp, disregard my second point. Too drunk to post</br>  <br>He wasnt comfortable with Yui early on; that changed since Vol 9 or so<br><br>He always felt more comfortable around Yukino even when he first met her. Not sure what he feels about Vol 11 moeblob Yuki though</br></br></br>  <br> it feels appropriate that 8man's prime romantic candidate is the woman he is most comfortable being with <br>But that one is still Iroha.</br></br>  <br> Iroha <br> Using her former crush as a facade <br>If she tries to confess he'll probably dismiss it exactly like Hayama did  Not genuine </br></br></br>  <br><br>Found it, thanks.<br><br>And I reiterate my original statement: They're similar indeed, but not quite.<br>Yui and Sensei ones implied "eventually" while Iroha one implied "already".<br>Even spyro translated the way I would, I just checked there too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Irohafags become insufferable after the anime happened? They never shitposted this much.  <br>You're moving the goalpost. 8man wouldn't accept a confession from anyone at this point in the story.</br>  <br>Lel I'm shitposting, not the one you're arguing</br>  <br> never shitposted this much </br>  <br><br>fuck off Irohass licker</br></br>  <br><br>They keep ascending to higher levels of shitposting. They're approaching shitposting nirvana.</br></br>  <br><br>You sure are calling out them shitposters by being the biggest shitposters in the thread.</br></br>  <br><br>  biggest shitposters in the thread <br><br>I could never possibly claim such a lofty title in this thread. We've had some real doozies.</br></br></br></br>  what show is the Yahari Oregairu of next season?<br>I need to shitpost in waifu wars</br>  <br>If only you're here when vol 10.5 got translated.</br>  <br> Why did Irohafags become insufferable after the anime happened? They never shitposted this much. </br>  <br><br>I need a break. I am honestly fatigued from waifu wars after S2 of Oregairu.</br></br>  <br>Yukino was so dere this season I loved it.</br>  <br>JWWW</br>  Ok... so is this show gona pull a oreimou on us and go 3p?  <br>I'll bite this time.<br> that one guy that always posts NTR doujins of Iroha <br> anons like this  and this  and this  every thread, all the time <br> denialfag targets Iroha all the time <br> Yukinofags and Yuifags tend to just call her irrelevant while Irohafags are trying to discuss something <br><br>You guys deserve the 'Iroha or death' spam sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  That reminds me, the first time I read volume 8 I found that the interaction between 8man and Iroha was pretty weird. I imagine 8man is some kind of edgy overlord that always get awkward talking to girl, especially for the girl he doesn't know before. So when he is casually talking to her, calling her out to do some works (sorting twitter account) or other stuff it is surprised me greatly. It's just like those two know each other for a long time they just hanging around like long term acquaintance. For Iroha it is understandable since she is often hanging around with boys (in football club), but come from 8man it's pretty rare. <br><br>I somehow reasoned that may be because she is a kouhai, somewhat look like his sister, and out of his strike zone so he didn't feel anything about her, but now when I recall it, might be it's because WW self insert him and his kouhai into the story so that 8man and Iroha relationship is just like him and his kouhai before (hence the casualness).</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is going on with that guy's back?</br>  <br>Shit in for a penny I guess<br><br>I think he's definitely getting more comfortable around people in general than he was way back at the beginning, but I feel that it's even more the case with Yui and Yukino, the various issues they're working through notwithstanding.<br><br><br>I'd say that if 8man's level of comfort with Yui is a positive thing for her, that would mean she leapfrogged Yukino at some point before going full dere, but moeblobnon has brought his feelings for her back to the fore and closed the distance.<br><br><br>He might be somewhat comfortable with Iroha, but the defensive monologue that's being touted is evidence against your argument<br><br><br>No, Yui's in v5c6 sates "-If I was any other guy, I probably would have started liking her." Present tense. And from much less overt appeals than Iroha, I feel I should add.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He spends his entire day shitposting on /a/, that's what's going on.</br>  <br>ust a typical yukinofag</br>  <br>lanklets when will they learn?</br>  <br>He's comfortable around Yukino because they can just sit there throwing insults at each other</br>   My youth romcom is wrong as expected <br> three major heroines <br> one is a popular genki girl with 10/10 looks who fell in love with the protag after he got run over to save her dog, also Minori issues <br> one is a rich intelligent kuudere with 10/10 looks who ran over the protagonist and started off with a really bad relationship with him, also family issues <br>  one is Chihiro <br><br>In retrospect, it's actually hilarious how obvious this is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> For Iroha it is understandable since she is often hanging around with boys (in football club), but come from 8man it's pretty rare. <br><br>And 8man has been around his harem since vol 1. And has been talking casually to two top-class girls in closed room. <br><br>Who would've thought?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda like marriage.</br>  <br> He might be somewhat comfortable with Iroha, but the defensive monologue that's being touted is evidence against your argument <br>He's made defensive remarks about everyone. That doesn't mean he was comfortable around them, even before he realized they wanted to get into his pants.</br></br>  <br> Going to decline because of Iroha <br> Actually can relate </br></br>  <br> Present tense. And from much less overt appeals than Iroha, I feel I should add. <br>Not really, his face got pretty close to Yui's just before that happened, if I recall correctly. That's him going denial after almost touching a girl's face while said girl started blushing.<br><br>Besides, "-If I was any other guy, I probably would have started liking her." would imply that he'd start to fall for her that moment.<br>Iroha's is still "already" as in he'd be in love already if he was his older self.<br>I'm not downplaying Yui or anything, it's painfully obvious that he cares for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I did miss the old banter. It did pop up again at aquarium date so that was nice</br>   mfw all this time I thought vol. 10.5 was the christmas present volume and thought I already read it <br> mfw it's something brand new <br><br>Holy shit I avoided these threads since the anime started due to the shitflinging but I can't believe I've missed out on this for so long.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes and with the exception of Iroha, his defensive thoughts have long since stopped. As well, I think that the only obvious conclusion for 8man's lowered defenses around Yui is that he really is more comfortable being with her, regardless of how that would actually bode for her ship.<br><br><br>Alright yeah, I think we can just call it point made for both sides since going further would mostly be us arguing the same basic point from different directions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But did you  enjoy   it?</br>  <br>Speaking about marriage, which girl is actually doing things the most for 8man's sake?</br>  8man likes Yukino<br>He likes Yui<br><br>He probably likes Iroha on some level but the other two hold higher importance to him</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is honestly the best waifu tier girl. She's nice and would take care of everything for you. The only downside is that she's not a great cook.</br>  <br>Yui, absolutely no contest. Iroha's might be doing a lot of "girlfriend" stuff but Yui's got a monopoly on "wife" stuff. Yukino's got practically nothing as far as I can tell, but I feel bad saying that so any Yukinofags lurking can feel free to prove me wrong.</br>  <br> Sits 5 metres away from her <br> Spends the whole club hour reading and not saying anything to her <br> The only time they talk, they insult each other <br> Comfortable </br></br></br></br>  <br> lowered defenses around Yui <br>It's like you didn't even read volume 11 or watch 12/13.</br></br>  <br>Well Yui has been more forward with Hachiman for a few volumes now; she's been trying to bridge him together with Yukino since Culture Festival (Help Yukinon whenever she's in trouble)<br><br>As for Hachiman, he probably goes out of his way to aid Yukinoshita the most. Makes sense because Yuki is the only character to have any drama and plot (thanks Watari). Iroha is 2nd behind and Yui doesnt really have much problems to him to deal with (typically Yui's problems also involve Yukino as well)_</br></br></br>  <br>Once Yukino goes into dere mode like she has in vol. 11, she's a pretty good waifu.</br>  <br>obviously Iro fucking ha. <br><br>She suggested the Service club photo, took it by 8man phone and even withdrew herself from the frame. Because she knew 8man cherished his club but just too tsundere to do shit.</br></br></br>  <br>8man liked Iroha's sweets the most.</br>  <br>It's just a bit of banter, mate</br>  <br>I'll laugh so hard if Iroha turns out to be the second coming of chihiro.</br>  <br> read the LN </br>  <br>Have you not read the LN or watched the anime? With Yukino, he literally says that the silence between them can be comfortable to him. he doesnt care about the banter either in later volumes<br><br>Vol 1:<br><br>She and I are certainly alike in some way. I found myself thinking that in spite of myself.<br><br> The silence in that moment somehow felt nice. <br> I felt my heart beat a little faster. It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond. <br> Then… <br> Then she and I…. <br> “Hey, Yukinoshita… <br><br>Vol 6<br> –Right. <br> She and I aren’t similar in the least. <br> Maybe that’s why. Maybe that’s why, whenever we exchange words like this, it always feels refreshing and pleasant. <br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. <br> So maybe. <br> So maybe she and I </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The take responsibility, become editor and date were good scenes, but service club photo was the exact moment I became Irohafag</br>  <br><br><br>except that Chihiro appeared very soon in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>She also had much more development throughout. Iroha winning would be more like the retarded Hagenai ending.</br>  <br> Iroha doesn't have development <br><br>Denialfags in charge of subtext.</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha <br> no development <br>You what.</br></br></br>  <br>When did I say she didn't have development? I said Chihiro had "more" development you faggot.</br>  <br><br>What makes you think that she is not  Tenri ?</br></br>  <br>8man's behavior around Yui now is markedly different to how it was earlier in the series. Most of his surprise at the way she acts in 11 seems to be because he was expecting very different reactions (refusal of his initial offer of a date, seeing Yukino with Yui when they meet, her insistence that the cookies are only a "thank you" gift)</br>  <br>Which is irrelevant. Iroha's still among the top 3 heroines in terms of development.</br>  <br> Sixth capture target <br> Soon </br></br>  <br><br>Iroha does have development, her problem is that it's not in the right direction. Her cliche romance flags mean nothing next to the service club's pursuit of "something genuine"</br></br>   yfw vol.12 will be adapted as a   movie   <br>Nigga ever since Iroha was properly introduced in volume 8, it's been nothing but chemistry and development.<br><br>We've had her compared to Taiga as in she keeps clinging to the MC and has ridiculously good chemistry with him. We've had her compared to Chihiro as in they got a lot of flags beforehand and disappeared during the last arc.<br><br>Who the fuck knows what Watari is thinking, volume 11 was very good for Irohafags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh? That's like he was expecting something from Yui.<br><br> I wonder what he was expecting? </br></br></br>  <br>He treats them both differently, but claiming he doesn't have defenses against them is ridiculous. He devised the chocolate-making event as a defensive barrier against them.</br>  <br>Well theres only 3 main heroines to begin with</br>  <br> Her cliche romance flags mean nothing next to the service club's pursuit of "something genuine" <br>You're under the assumption that something genuine means romance, and not a relationship where hurting each is ok as long as it's the true.</br></br>   ISHIKKI IROHA PLEASES RANDOM BOYS FOR MONEY <br> RANDOM BOYS </br>  <br> yeah, this scene and that one when she and Miura were cheering for Hayama (and 8man too) made me an Irohafags <br><br>  Isshiki watched the both of them in satisfaction on the side and then turned this way again. “…Senpai, do your best too, okaaaay!” <br><br>There isn't any girl in this series that can beat Iroha in term of personality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IROHA OR DEATH</br>  <br>Soon? She might have appeared at chapter 3 in the manga, but her arc started at chapter 28 (SEVEN months after the manga started). Before that she was just a mob character with little to no screentime.</br>  <br>On the contrary her "cliche" romance flags are nearly an accurate representation of what a normal, mundane romance would be like.<br><br>The pursuit of "something genuine" has never been inherently romantic and all the drama it creates only lowers the main heroines' chances in a series called "my youth romcom is wrong as expected".</br></br></br>  <br>I miss the day when we still have Saki.</br>  <br>She's a slut, not your waifu.</br>  <br>Fair point but that's one example when he was particularly fearful of the truth damaging their relationship, versus almost everything since "genuine" where the most resistance he's put up is trying for a moment to get away from her shoulder massage.</br>  <br>It took ~70% of the series before people like you were forced to acknowledge her as a main heroine in the first place.<br><br>Characters like Megu, Saki, Ebina, Miura, and Sensei have been much longer and are certainly not anywhere close to Iroha.</br></br></br>  Does anyone want some  puhaa ?  <br>IROHA<br> OR <br>DEATH</br></br></br>      <br>Yes, please.</br>  <br> having fun with random boys in her free times <br>IROHA A SLUT<br>A<br>SLUT</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw S3 was already confirmed </br>  <br>No, you're reading too much into what I said. something genuine only involves them being honest about their feelings, but because those feelings include mutual romantic desire, the presence of a fundamentally closer relationship than what he has with Iroha precludes almost any chance she has at winning.<br><br>Her only shot is if she gets serious in volume 12 and starts building something like that with 8man herself.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yes indeed, get in line nigga.</br>  <br>I R O H A<br>OR<br>D E A T H</br></br></br>  <br>Irohasu~</br>  <br>you do know that she was calling "sempai" in that pic, right?</br>  <br>Yeah but she still lags behind YxY in terms of overall importance. She has cute scenes here and there (for ship teasing) but the focal point of the series has always been the main trio</br>  <br>How many fucking satan posts did she get already?<br>God damn..</br></br>  Can't wait till vol 12 came out. I want to see everyone flipping their shit over an  open  ending.  <br><br>Enjoy your loose vagina<br><br><br>So?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait until this causes as much of a shitstorm as OreImo's ending did.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>Here's your reply.</br></br>  <br>I still think the ending is depend on what Watari is trying to convey with the story. So an Iroha end with genuine club relationship may portrait some ideal pretty well.</br>  <br>see where I responded here re: genuine and romance  and the title is essentially meaningless, particularly considering the massive change in direction Watari took the series on.<br><br>I just can't agree with you about the idea that going through a checklist of romcom tropes is closer to "normal" romance than really getting to know someone as 8man is doing with the service club girls and realizing along the way that there are mutual feelings that extend beyond friendship.</br></br></br>  <br> Both are normalfags <br> Both have a not genuine crush <br> Both get rejected <br> Both fall in love with the mc <br> Both lie about their crush <br> Both have umbrella scenes </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  <br>The only way for that to happen is if Iroha wins the 8bowl.</br>  <br>Reminder that Watari's novel main heroine is some copycat. Can't expect nothing less from the author. List of ideal he already copied before<br><br>+ Hanagai obviously<br>+ WA2<br>+ Toradora (?)<br>+ TWGOK<br><br>so what series' ending he going to copy here? Place your own bet!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that the only one 8man said he loved was Saki.  <br>That's specifically because it was a high likelihood situation for the girls to be expressing romantic feelings for him, which they tend not to do.<br><br>Granted I'm not going to write either one off completely. He cares about both club members to the point where he'd probably try to date either one just to give them an honest chance to see if anything works out, but it's still a really weird situation where he's not completely comfortable with either of them romantically. It was only recently that he finally stopped calling his promise to Yui irresponsible.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127306121 <br> Irohafags are cancer, they said <br>I don't know if you're a Yukinofag or Yuifag, but please get the fuck off those ships just in case because the idea of having you on the same ship as me is disgusting.</br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127306121 <br>Here's your reply.<br>You seem to be growing desperate, are you ok?</br></br>  <br>You're right that he's not completely comfortable, all I'm trying to say is that he is noticeably more comfortable than he was with them before.</br>  <br>I always bet on Tsukasa</br>  <br>Yukino is refereed to the most beautiful girl in school in S1, Yumiko even compared herself to her saying she looks better than her despite them never meeting.</br>  <br>I'd pinch her cheeks if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Me too, even if I am still fucking mad.<br><br> For less than a year, admittedly. I only recently got on a kick of romcom manga that brought Ichigo 100% into my sights. </br></br></br>  Iroha or Death, bretheren!<br><br>I'll sure as hell take responsibility for the Goddess. <br><br>Praise be with Irohallah.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127306121 <br>Honestly, you're much worse than any Irohafag.</br>  <br> Irohallah <br>Is this a falseflag? I'm confused.</br></br>  <br><br>The problem is that, no matter how you look at it, the "you need to suffer to be genuine" ideology is flawed, as it implies that genuine relationships are synonymous with suffering. This is only further reinforced by the fact that the one who taught that ideology to 8man is hopelessly alone.<br><br>8man's going to develop beyond Sensei's ideology, and that's when he'll be ready to hook up with Iroha without meeting "necessary amount of drama to be genuine" requisite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The author asked what people wanted as end girl and Tsukasa won in the poll.</br>  Haruno is a Goddess and not the Devil.<br><br>Haruno motives are flawed and her words have ambiguity and/or questionable but it doesn't make Haruno the villian of Oregairu. There shouldn't exist any antagonism directed at Haruno; she believe her method is efficient.<br><br>So, what is the difference between Hachiman telling Yukino to solve her own problems and Haruno saying the same words? It seem to me you anons convientely want to associate a character as the villian.<br><br>Every Oregairu character are cunts, not only Haruno.<br><br>Please treat Haruno kindly and do not dehumanize Haruno. She is still a human afterall.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  that's when he'll be ready to hook up with Iroha without meeting "necessary amount of drama to be genuine" requisite. <br><br>And Irohafags call others "denialfags".</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying that Iroha couldn't win without a drama/suffering arc?</br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>I already went into depth about that view of the club in the last thread here <br><br>If that was you I was talking to back there I'm even more eager to hear your response.</br></br></br>  Fuck this, I'm going to sleep.<br>Burgerland posting time is fucking cancer, especially on weekends.</br>  <br>And the whole dramashit will be for naught.</br>  <br>She's a Goddess disguised as the Devil to save the sister most dear to her.</br>  <br>Almost none of that post has anything to do with what I said. Give me the version the version that addresses the point and isn't full of inflammatory remarks.</br>  <br> For naught <br>Not him, but what? Hooking up with Iroha doesn't have anything to do with Yukino's problems, which are completely divorced. <br><br>Even if Yukino did GENUINELY love 8man, she can still resolve her problems with dependency, or at least start down the path to doing so after heartbreak.<br><br>Not that I think it'll happen mind you, but don't act like 8man hooking up with Yui or Iroha betrays Yukino's character arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's going to be the moral of the story though: You don't have to go through a grueling miserable process just to be close to someone. At least not always.</br>  <br>I thought it was that by existing you're hurting people so there can't be a friendship end.</br>  <br>It's not that edgy. The two closest characters in the series pretty much never hurt eachother.</br>  Shaaa  <br>I don't understand your logic</br>  <br> it can't be helped </br>  <br>Huh? What you were accusing is unrelated on what I was addressing.<br><br><br>That means spitting on his own narration though. The whole vol 11 is being used to address that romance subplot as well as reinforced that 8man doesn't want an easy way out. And you're not Watari to decide the moral end of the story anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those "inflammatory remarks" are me pointing out the flaws in your argumentative technique.<br><br>At any rate my key point remains the same. You argue that the club's search for "something genuine" is something harmful to them because it causes them to suffer. Counter to that, I point out that in spite of the pain they have gone through, the members of the club are all growing and improving themselves as people, and that a major part of that comes from the fact that their shared search for something genuine creates a deep, powerful relationship in which they are able to offer each other mutual support.</br></br></br>    <br> The whole vol 11 is being used to address that romance subplot as well as reinforced that 8man doesn't want an easy way out. <br><br>Exactly. This is why a Iroha end wouldn't make sense to me. All the buildup towards Vol. 12 has been towards to resolving the trio's final problems along with their realization of theirs romantic feelings for each other. For some outsider to come into this would just be stupid.</br></br></br>    <br>I just realized I really like the uniforms.</br>  <br>There is no easy way out, no matter what choice 8man makes.<br>Somebody is going to get hurt, it's simple like that.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, that has fuckall to do with my post.<br><br>You're wrongfully implying that more suffering =/= a deeper relationship, but that is just plain not the case. <br><br>I will actually correct something though: Sensei may not have been mistaken, however the message that 8man and most posters took from it is definitely wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  I just wonder can i go Haruno route in the new Yahari game.  <br>if you didn't get it, it might be you that's autistic since this is pretty simple</br>  <br>Yes, as a Yukino bad end</br>  Now that's alpha.  <br>Her mother loves her and is worried about her. She wants her to start thinking on her own. <br><br>Yukino is a clingy person with massive codependency issues.</br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br><br>Well as her mother it's likely she loves her, but it's a stretch to think she's "wants her to start thinking on her own." It's possible, but we really don't know. Yukimom could be a culprit in Yukino's issues. She was opposed to Yukino getting the apartment on her own after all.<br><br>It could be that she's basically given up on Yukino changing long ago and now just wants to direct her the way she thinks Yukino needs to go. Or maybe she actually prefers doll-Yukino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was wondering when the Hayama poster was going to show up.</br>  The main trio is going to suffer in some form. Iroha is irrelevant to the main storyline from this point on. Once they find whatever is genuine, things change. The current relationship that they have, the one Yui might wish to hold onto, wont be there. Yuki may leave, Yui may get heartbroken but this is what 8man wants<br><br>Yuki: needs to shed ther dependency problem but that means distancing herself from the source (Hachiman for the most part, Yui as well). Her ice queen persona isnt the real her nor is this moeblob; she needs to find her true self. Interacting with Hachi and Yui shed the first wall but she didnt reset back to square 1 (her real self); she was so fucked up that she's still 2 squares behind what she will become<br><br>Yui: Needs to deal with the fact that things are going to change and that she will get hurt in some way (she will lose either Hikki or Yukinon in the process). She wants to keep the the trio together but its just stagnation. <br><br><br>The truth whatever it is can be painful, despicable but also incredibly beautiful. Living in the moment is just short term satisifaction which is what Hachiman does not want (Youth is a lie, see Hayama's group for another parallel) <br><br>Fuck, the ending of Oregairu is going to make me sad. There will a good ending to it but I dont think it'll be a happy one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I never had a girlfriend.  <br>Nice. Do you have a blog I can subscribe to?</br>  <br><br>  that means distancing herself from the source <br><br>I dunno. I don't think isolating herself from her friends is the way to go for Yukino. That puts her back where she was when the series began. All alone. And she wasn't overcoming her problems then either.<br><br>She needs her friends, but in a healthy way. That means interacting with them because she needs to work out the right way to do so. And she is going to need the emotional support at least, which is perfectly fine and not a 'dependency problem'.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the problem here is that you're just saying "suffering" and expecting people to think "oh no this is terrible"<br><br>And are you trying to say I imply that more suffering does or does NOT equal a deeper relationship? Because if anything my point is technically closer to the former, but you miss my actual meaning<br><br>First of all, I will concede that life is tough, that sometimes you suffer and that yes rational people seek to minimize it. One of your many mistakes is not realizing that the net result of the Service Club is for those three characters to minimize their suffering.<br><br>You completely ignore the benefits they reap for their efforts: personal growth and two people that really, truly care for them. Their pain as they're going through right now is of almost no consequence given that the endgame of "something genuine" is to be emotionally healthy and fulfilled people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What the fuck is wrong with her pupils?</br>  <br><br>  things are going to change <br><br>Thinks might change, but that doesn't mean it's going to break. If what they have is really genuine, then it can survive things like one of them getting in a relationship with Hachiman or going separate ways after high school.</br></br></br></br>  How come Yukino seems to be really in love with 8man? Was she always kinda in love but it was hard to pick up on?  <br>Yeah that was a typo on my part. Suffering is part of progress, however not all progress is equal. You're wrong in suggesting that, just because the club members have suffered more, they've made more progress than Iroha.<br><br>It took an enormous amount of effort just for them to start to maybe admit their feelings for 8man. (Not even proper confessions, just implying implications and an awkward date.) To claim they have some kind of substantial lead on Iroha is silly.<br><br> One of your many mistakes is not realizing that the net result of the Service Club is for those three characters to minimize their suffering. <br>This is really up in the air right now. Yukino is a huge mess and Yui's big development was basically to go full Hayato/old 8man. 8man's probably going to be stressed way the fuck out as well. They ended on something resembling a positive note, but they haven't actually resolved anything whatsoever regarding their relationship, only expressed desire to.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The whole theme in vol 11 is how feelings eventually become impossible to ignore. That goes for Yukino's affections for Hachiman as well as for her personal issues.</br></br>  <br>when you've got a bitch in heat trying to steal yo man, you probably should start stepping up yo game</br>  <br>She became conscious of him during the festival, fell for him sometime before the whole StuCo election, tried to fall out of love when he took Iroha's request on his own, then fell hard for him when "genuine" happened.</br>  Sometimes, I wish this series was just about Yukino and Hachiman bullying the shit out of each other while actually competing over whatever requests that come to them. Everyone else will be recurring characters that stop by for hijinks.  <br>But Yui is a good girl</br>  <br>Dere mode? You mean Dependent mode? Relying on both Yui and 8man when dealing with her sister/problems.</br>    <br><br>8man should just tap her, that will get rid of her dependency problem and make her less in love with him.</br></br>  I want Iroha to cuck the other whores from 8man.  <br> Yui is the best <br> Triss is the best <br>fair enough to me<br> Keira is a shit though, Iroha is way better </br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who loves strong women, seeing the once proud Yukino turn into this is pretty saddening.</br>  <br>Thats the point</br>  <br>So her feelings have been vague and weak but now she can't ignore what they are? Did they build momentum?<br><br><br> tried to fall out of love <br>That did fuck all and probably made her fall harder. Trying to fall out of love only makes you think of the person more and more. I guess this is one of the many reasons genuine fucked her up.<br><br>When reading her memorandum it seems that she is really really invested in genuine. Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK THIS IS</br>  Is this how desperate Iroha fans are?  <br>There's nothing "up in the air" about the growth of the service club members. They're in a bad place right now but there is no way on god's green earth Watari is going to leave them as the mess they are. They will get their healing, and their emotional balance books will be firmly in the black at the end.<br><br>And now that we're getting back to Iroha again, I'll say as I and many others already have: the simple fact is that her relationship with 8man is superficial and empty compared to what he has with Yukino and Yui. He certainly has feelings for all three of them, but to presume that Iroha's flirty playfulness could ever hope to win in a fair fight over two girls who have actually touched 8man's heart is foolish on it's face.<br><br>Iroha is destined for heartbreak unless either both Yui and Yukino are removed from the equation, or she gets some major, major development as a serious character in volume 12 and sets down the path to having the kind of closeness the other two girls have to 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say her internal feelings towards Hachiman have built momentum. They've been pretty set in stone since the first genuine speech. It's just it's gotten harder and harder for her, Hachiman, and Yui to all ignore the romantic tensions in the service club.<br><br>  it seems that she is really really invested in genuine. Why? <br><br>Because it really struck a chord with her I think. It touched the 'real' Yukino somehow. And because she's in love with Hachiman and wants to make him happy. That's also likely a part of the 'real' Yukino. Yui has also invested a considerable amount of time thinking about 'genuine' but she's not the personality type as Yukino so her diary is a bit different.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're in a bad place right now but there is no way on god's green earth Watari is going to leave them as the mess they are. They will get their healing, and their emotional balance books will be firmly in the black at the end. <br> I'll say as I and many others already have: the simple fact is that her relationship with 8man is superficial and empty compared to what he has with Yukino and Yui.

Thought you committed suicide a while back ago.</br>  <br>She doesnt have much to latch onto as a whole given how she grew up but her relationship with hachiman is incredibly important to her (as is Yui but genuine was his request)<br><br>Part of it has to do with love but I think the concept of "genuine" hit her hard. I mean, she was always 2nd fiddle to Haruno, outsiders often thought she was a nobody (in terms of affluent outsiders mind you), guys who came closer to in the past only did so because a crush, girls used to get jelly with her etc<br><br>So her finding what is genuine will also help her find her true self I think. Thats the end goal for her</br></br></br></br></br>    Yukino voice a best    <br>Iroha is behind Yui and Yukino in terms of importance to the plot. Iroha may win who the fuck knows. But until the HYY situation is resolved, then she is irrelevant to the 8bowl.<br><br>She can only win if the other two lose for whatever reason</br></br></br>  <br>Putting words in my mouth.<br>Again.<br>And ignoring my argument.<br>One more time, Iroha has had development, but she has only ever affected 8man on a superficial level.<br><br>8man's relationship with the other two girls isn't about "muh dramatic misery" it's about them really, seriously caring about each other and wanting to get closer and know each other better. Right now we have no evidence whatsoever that something like that exists between 8man and Iroha, and until we do (as per my second caevat for the future of the story) your waifu only holds a weak station in 8man's heart, no matter how much you wish it were otherwise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh man she is beautiful.</br>  <br>shaa~</br>  <br><br> Character development Yukino </br></br>  <br>Who is she?</br>  <br>No, I don't want her character to develop</br>  <br>Haganai author... actually no, you don't have to go, because we know your editor forced that shitty "ending" on you.

You're effectively arguing for the cowards' way by implying that avoiding all pain and waiting for something good to fall in your lap is more fulfilling than reaching out and taking something with your own two hands.<br><br> Her romantic progress with 8man implies an equivalent level or emotional care. Just because she hasn't shown off the strength of their relationship through drama queening, doesn't their bond lacks strength. She and 8man get along so well for a reason. <br> source: my ass <br>8man has made active efforts to get to know Yukino and Yui better, and to stand by them through thick and thin, and they have done the same for him. Source: the Genuine and Aquarium speeches.<br><br>Iroha has learned of and offered to 8man nothing but the superficial trappings of a twee high school romance. She floats around him being cute and flirtatious, hitting all the high notes of cliche love story while making no efforts to be a part of his life beyond that.

It was pretty meh.<br><br>How's your backlog, faggots?</br></br>  Working on it.<br><br>Catching up this week with Wooser no Sono Higurashi Kakusei-hen and Symphogear G in anticipation of new seasons starting up. Enjoyed the first seasons of both. Finished catching up with season 1 and 2 of Working!!, which was cute. Yamada a best. <br><br>Also just started GJ-bu! only on episode 3 but it's pretty good so far.<br><br>Backlog work is never-ending, but it's nice to have plenty of shows to get into between seasons, or to work on an episode or two here and there when you're caught up with everythign airing and bored.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yamada a best <br>Sadly I don't have the expanded pic.<br><br>GJ-bu! is great too.<br><br>Somehow the next season is here and I barely worked in my goddamn backlog.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pretty shitty, I used to work on my backlog at work and now I finally caved in and got a mobile internet plan so mostly just shitpost on /a/ instead. <br><br>Anyway, trying to watch Ayakashi so I can finally watch Mononoke but it's really shit so I guess I'll give up and watch Texhnolyze instead, it's the last one of a bunch of shows that I had on my backlog the longest. Recently watched some other ones I put off for the longest time like Kino no Tabi(really disappointing) and Haibane Renmei(even better than expected), so might as well get it over and done with. <br><br>Oh, also watched Zettai Shonen recently, I never see people mention it but it's quite a curious show with a wonderful atmosphere that does some unexpected things. First part has one of the worst autistic MCs I've encountered to date, though. <br><br><br>Friendly reminder to drop GJ-bu before the last episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kino no Tabi(really disappointing) <br>Now that's an unpopular opinion. Maybe you were overhyped?</br></br>  Why are they speaking Chinese instead of American? Can't they learn to speak the language of the country they're living in?

Also, we use the Imperial measuring system which is pre-19th century whereas the metric system is a 19th century invention (1799 technically, but close enough).<br><br>Basically<br>America = Old Britain</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same reason why a british vampire that was trapped on the bottom of the ocean for a century and then ended up in egypt spoke fluent Japanese.</br>  <br>Because Japs hate subs</br>   This is where Archer learned his English from <br> I AM DE BONE OV MY SORD </br>  <br><br>As someone whose native language isn't english, I found British accent more difficult to understand at first.

Exactly how do you plan to live in a country in which you speak your native language to other people expecting them to understand? You either learn or get someone to translate for you.<br><br>I'm saying this because I know many people who aren't willing to learn english just to move out or even travel to an english speaking country. They'd rather travel to countries that speak the same language. And the few people that have actually moved out to other countries without knowing the language say they had to learn it, like it or not. It's just common sense. Americans and British have it easier because english has a lot of coverage.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being backwards is good <br><br>Never forget Amerika is Europ's Australia.</br></br></br>  <br>The bit about French and American people should have given you a hint about what people normally do.<br>People who natively speak a world language generally expect that they don't need to learn a second language ever. As described in , they may move to a place and simply limit their conversations to those people that know some English (or French/Spanish/whatever). Other popular ways are also to just stick to people of your origin from the beginning.<br>China-towns are not a thing of fiction, and the general concept isn't limited to Chinese.

And it's not only in my country's cities, there's other countries/cities that are just not that developed or famous to get a lot of immigrants thus they don't get their own communities. So yes, in that case the immigrants there do have to learn the language of said country/city or else they're fucked. Ironically, people often choose those cities because they have knowledge of those communities, thus they know they won't have to necessarily learn the language.<br><br>What you're talking about only works in famous cities with a lot of immigrants, but that's not the case everywhere else. Not every city has their token Chinese Town or Irish Towns. In this case, you either learn or learn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> do have to learn the language of said country/city or else they're fucked <br>I've met quite a few people who where "fucked".<br>Like, the parents didn't speak a single word of the native language. Anything that needed to be discussed with strangers was done through their children who'd grown up in this country and had thus learned the language (to varying degrees).</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I've seen both.<br>I have a friend who doesn't know shit about english, went to Miami and was comfortable there because there was a lot of spanish speaking people there. Likewise, a friend of a friend went to live to London with her daughter, and both had to learn the language, even though they knew other people that spoke spanish.<br><br>I guess it depends on the person. Is really annoying having to depend on someone to understand what's going on (I myself had to translate for someone and it was annoying for both of us). And is overall disadvantageous because you can't go out or buy stuff without having them always with you. I guess some people don't mind, like the ones you talk about, and others want to learn on their own.</br></br></br></br>  Whats wrong with shitting on school toilet?<br><br>Serieusly japan</br></br>  <br>I went to a boarding school, what now?</br>  <br>Send your poop home by mail.</br>   used to study in a school that had a shitton of bathrooms <br> during one day of exploring campus I find this bathroom that's very clean and even has a shower and stuff <br> hardly used cause it's at a building away from the usual student traffic <br> go here whenever I need to take a crap <br><br>Well, I only used it thrice in my entire school life there but it was a pretty nice bathroom.</br></br></br></br></br>  OP was shitting in school toilet.  I talk my way into using the staff bathroom and I blew that shit up. One of my teachers was pissed saying why didn't you just use the public bathroom. I said cause I didn't want to and they pissed him off even more.  Am I missing something or is this pretty generic? <br><br>Is Fate / Zero much better than / Stay Night? For the hype I saw around this, I've been pretty underwhelmed so far.</br></br>  <br> Is Fate / Zero much better than / Stay Night? <br> yes </br></br>  <br>So it's normal to be underwhelmed by Stay Night?</br>  <br>Did you watch the FSN anime by studio DEEN like your OP pic implies? Then yes. If you watched the UBW anime by Ufotable then no.</br>  <br>So what should I watch now to be blown away? Unlimited Bladeworks or Zero?</br>  <br>Uh, no. Zero is edgy stuff for pretentious teenagers who thought they know what's a great story is. Everyone in that show acted like retarded teenagers/manchildren who cannot come to terms with reality. The only remotely good characters in Zero are Waver, Rider and Kirei,<br>Stay Night while being flaw still delivers a much more meaningful story about ideals, maturity, growing up and chasing your dream instead of just being edgy for edgy sakes like Zero.</br></br>  <br>For the best experience read the FSN visual novel then watch Fate/Zero. If you don't want to read the VN, finish the current anime your watching and watch the Ufotable UBW anime.</br>  <br>Why should I not watch F/Z if I don't want to read the VN?</br>  <br><br> who cannot come to terms with reality <br><br>its funny because you and the retards like you are the ones who cant come to terms with reality<br><br>you parrot the same bullshit over and over about edginess like some pretentious retard and dare to use those same words in your defense<br><br>utterly ironic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's expected of you.</br>  <br>If you're intent on watching something then watch Zero then UBW. Alternatively, read the fucking VN.</br>  <br> Can't prove any those point are wrong. <br> Start shouting bullshit about anon posters. <br>Sasuga, Zerofag. Truly you have prove yourself to be the target audience of Zero.</br></br></br>  <br>You can watch it after the HF movies come out. Most people who watch F/Z then watch any FSN work come out disappointed because they expect FSN to be a sequel to F/Z, but FSN doesn't work as a sequel to it. F/Z is just a prequel to FSN designed to build off what you already know about FSN. If you really want to, you can watch F/Z after you finish the DEEN anime, but just understand that if you're expecting UBW to be a sequel to it, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.</br>  <br><br>So which is it? Zero or UBW? <br><br>Also, no, not going to read the VN. <br><br><br>Man, this series is confusing as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So which is it? Zero or UBW? <br>If you're going anime only, finish the current anime your watching, watch zero, then UBW if you don't want to read the VN or wait for the movies to come out. Just remember that UBW is not a sequel to Zero if you do that.</br></br>  Prisma Illya is the only good one.  <br>Watch Zero then UBW. That guy is just an apologist ignore him, they are the saddest people in the fanbase.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>what else would you expect from a show base on a meet and fuck porn game</br>  <br>Zero then UBW. Don't finish DEEN's, just look up a plot summary or alternatively read the fucking VN if you want to know what happens in Fate. Stop being new.</br>  I liked Zero a great deal more than UBW, but I suggest watching UBW before Zero. <br>It may sound retarded, but this way you'll watch a good anime and an even better one after that. <br>If you watch Zero and then UBW you might end up being a little disappointed with the latter.</br></br>  Have we finally come to the point where people admit how bad FSN is? Even Ufotable couldn't save it from the god awful VN tropes and shit pacing. Not even with Nozomu Abe doing god tier action.<br><br>The story and characters are fine but the plot is so retarded and could be saved with just some changes. Too bad it would make TM fanboys cry and complain till the end of times.</br></br>  <br>No, wait till the movies are out, then we can agree that F/SN is shit.</br>  <br> then watch Fate/Zero <br>Read the books first. The anime has some nice visuals on a few fights, but cuts most of the characterization that even makes Zero worthwhile.</br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero blows FSN out of water, but shounenfags and waifufags can't admit that.</br>  <br> but I suggest watching UBW before Zero. <br><br>No, because UBW is made as sequel to Zero. While Zero is made as stand alone. Speaking of the anime adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, no, not going to read the VN. <br><br>Then don't fucking bother at all if you're just going to be a secondary. If you want to watch something casually go watch some other series. If you're not interested in investing time and work into getting into this shit then it isn't for you.</br></br></br>  <br>No, you're right. Fate is the Archetype of chuuni harem fighting shonen. Fate/Zero is a fanfiction done by some edgelord which is somehow infinitely more entertaining.<br><br>Anyway, Nasu is a hack.</br></br></br>  <br> UBW is made as sequel to Zero. <br>Which was still dumb since it didn't do anything to actually link them. You would expect them to at least include something like Waver dismantling the Greater Grail after the war, since that shit is never actually addressed in-game/anime outside of Zero and HF.</br></br>  <br>I like Zero for the action<br><br>You're pretentious if you think shirou story is deep</br></br></br>  <br><br>F/SN is a harem.<br><br>F/Z has a proper story.<br><br>Idiots like  think that enjoying a proper story must mean that you're forcing yourself to be mature, which is actually the second stage of tryhard-maturity that comes after the first stage at which one indeed forces themselves to watch edgy things. As they realize how immature it is to force themselves to watch mature things out of tryhardness, they begin to force themselves to *not* enjoy things they perceive as being potentially "edgy" and start hating on anything that's not moe uguu cute girls harem, not realizing that this is merely the second stage of tryhardness.<br><br>For example, Fate/Zero is among my personal favorites of all time, along with Nichijou, because I genuinely enjoyed them a great fucking deal, for different reasons of course.<br><br>Other than that, F/SN idiots clench onto F/SN out of nostalgia and a ridiculous need to justify the "quality" of the retarded story behind their favorite harem game from when they were a horny teenager/young-adult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even so, it's how it's made and they would be confused by UBW without watching Fate/Zero first.</br>  <br>I'm not arguing that UFO clearly tried to play UBW off as a sequel, just that they did it poorly.</br>  Zero's anime shits over every F/SN anime. <br><br>F/SN's VN is better than Zero's LN and anime though.</br></br>  <br> UBW is still a critically acclaimed anime <br> The biggest complaints against it are poor pacing in the second half due to poor adaptive choices and that it isn't a sequel to Fate/Zero while the rest of the story and action is largely praised <br>Doesn't sound like people will admit FSN is bad anytime soon.</br></br></br>  My personal recommendation is to watch the F/Z anime and ignore everything else from the Fate franchise.<br><br>DEEN was obviously shit. UBW movie was also meh. Heard mediocre things about UBW anime but won't even bother because I know the story is shit in first place.<br>And I don't understand the idiots complaining about F/Z being edgy when Kerry is a fairly straightforward no-bullshit (if not "realistic") representation of a mindbroken utilitarian and the whole story is fairly coherent and all ties back to how he came to be how he is etc., whereas F/SN contains abundant amounts of pointless edgy suffering and pretentious heroism and "omg I was super-powerful all the time" and all kinds of cringe-worthy crap.</br></br></br>  <br> this isn't pasta </br>  <br><br> maturity <br> anime <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> F/SN kid suffering from cognitive dissonance <br>Nothing new here.<br><br><br>I have a ~50 year-old coworker who's married with children and Elfen Lied is one of his favorite shows. I don't think there's a problem with enjoying anime as a "mature" person.<br><br>I wouldn't exactly call myself mature, but if I'm immature it's not because I'm watching anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Fate/Zero is better. Fate/Zero's biggest flaw is that it's connected to Fate/Stay Night and can't get out of some of the stupid things related to that.<br><br>In many ways if you've watched the terrible Deen adaptation of Stay Night, it's rather cathartic in Zero where it feels like the story was like "Yeah, you thought those characters and those juvenile outlooks of life were dumb? So did we."</br></br></br>  <br> F/SN is a harem <br><br>Whatever you say buddy.</br></br></br>  Nigger I don't care what you say, that epilogue ending was the best thing to come out of the franchise in a decade.  <br>Dont listen to this guy he is just mad everyone on this board is trashing his shitty VN.</br>  <br>Read the thread he watched DEEN's fate route.</br>  <br> Everyone in that show acted like retarded teenagers/manchildren who cannot come to terms with reality. <br>Kirei is the worst offender. A grown-ass man still trying to find himself and acting all master manipulator troll on everyone.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he has a life and does not want to spend time reading an eroge</br>  <br>Read the fucking VN. This can not be repeated enough.</br>  Fate/Stay Night was written by a guy in high school.<br>Fate/Zero was written by an experienced writer.<br>It's pretty obvious. Even the spin-off is better written than Fate/Stay Night.</br></br>  The VN is pretty average too. Better than the adaptation sure, but not deserving of the hype it gets.  <br>Sadly UBW is probably the route least connected to Fate/Zero, so it doesn't work as a sequel to the prequel.<br><br>Fate route has the most direct connection, but it's also the basic route..</br></br></br>  <br> Shitty Jap writing for the sake of muh source material  <br>No</br></br>  <br>Then stick to Fate/Zero and shut up about Fate/Stay Night. If you're going to have an opinion about it, you damn well better have played the VN.</br>  <br> Even the spin-off is better written than Fate/Stay Night. <br>I love this MAYMAY :^)</br></br>  <br>Nothing FSN will blow you away<br>FSN has a large fanbase but nobody consider it a great VN, it's filled with flaws</br></br>  <br>Shame the experienced writer's only experience is based off shit written by high school losers. Urobuchi writes edge based on Naruto instead of edge based on Devilman, causing every one of his projects to come off as really immature.</br>  <br> nobody consider it a great VN <br>A lot of people do, actually.</br></br>  <br> FSN has a large fanbase but nobody consider it a great VN, it's filled with flaws <br>I wish people would admit this. All I see are people hailing it as some masterpiece while the more sane people are drowned out or avoid the threads entirely.</br></br>  <br> Lose 70 hours of my life playing a text based porn game. <br>How about no?</br></br>  <br>FSN 2006 is mediocre at best. Watch the most recent adaptation and F/Z, people who will say these aren't better are baiting.</br>  <br>How does Saber look so absolutely amazing in that suit?</br>  <br><br>Don't fucking lie to the guy. VN's also trash and just full of generic powerlevel bullshit. <br><br>OP, Fateshit is garbage. Some people have just been following it for years ever since the VN wasn't even completely translated. They already invested a lot of time on this shit and they can't accept how garbage this series really is. Blind fanboyism. Kind of like how evatards are. <br><br>The series also attracts a lot of narutofags and saofags. So you see, it has the most cancerous fanbase.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> literally a galgame <br>Anon, I...</br></br>  <br>She's a man, and also European.</br>  <br>People who never read another VN let alone a book maybe</br>  <br>Fate/Zero was Fate/Stay Night done right.</br>  <br> If you're not interested in investing time and work into getting into this shit then it isn't for you. <br>Is the Fateverse that much of a drudgery? I better earn a degree for reading all the materials, damn.</br></br>  <br>Probably.</br>  <br> harems can't have a proper story <br>Zero is just a ghetto version of Fate, and that's the most basic route in any VN ever. At least UBW and HF have personality.</br></br>  <br> At least UBW and HF have personality. <br>Its wrong to lie on the internet, anon.</br></br>  <br>He's right though. FSN might have an amazing premise but the writing is shit and Shirou is a fucking atrocious main character. It's biggest problem is that it suffers from the Japanese obsession of having it's main characters be school students, whereas the majority of characters in FZ are full adults which makes it more interesting since there isn't any tsundere bullshit or 'comedic' misunderstandings</br>  <br>To be fair VN standards aren't exactly high.</br>  <br> prisma <br> better written <br>Illya is boring generic friend loving girl in prisma. Her shitty drama was also a waste of time. Miyu is generic closed off loner. Kuro is pretty much the only character worth mentioning that isn't above the age of 13. <br>Only thing the show had going for it was friendship getting stomped by things like Bazette.</br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW  <br>UBW just finished you know, everybody can see your lie</br></br>  <br> Man, this series is confusing as fuck. <br><br>It's really not. You read all 3 routes of the VN and then watch Zero, how fucking hard is that?</br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero is glorified fanfiction based on a story that was already told perfectly in the source material.<br><br>As someone who needs to pay denbts, I was also very pissed off about the disgraceful nigger title given to Alexandros.</br></br></br>  <br> To be fair VN standards aren't exactly high. <br>Its standards are still high enough to realize FSN isn't a masterpiece or even close</br></br>  <br> &gt;harems can't have a proper story <br>I didn't say that. Surely there are exceptions proving the rule, like Monogatari.<br>F/SN might be an EDGE-case if you know what I mean.</br></br></br>  <br>You'd be surprised at how shitty the FSN fanbase is.</br>  <br>The spin-off in question is Prisma-Illya where the main characters aside from Rin and Rich girl are like 12. Literally magical girl with a flavoring of fate.</br>  FSN isn't a masterpiece and it has plenty of flaws, but it's still enjoyable.  <br> Hurrr durr <br>He was talking about Prisma faggot.</br></br>  <br> Literally magical girl <br>Literally nothing wrong.<br><br> Though I dropped Illya after one episode, and that as an actual pedo. It didn't seem very sincere at all. It was reeking of sick pedo/lolicon bait, as in the perverted kind. I only want to love. </br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS.</br>  <br> I didn't say that.  <br><br>See <br> F/SN is a harem. <br> F/Z has a proper story. <br><br>Also<br> start hating on anything that's not moe uguu cute girls harem <br>Literally have never watched nor read any route of Fate/Stay Night. I make this assesment because HF is like ten times edgier than Zero is, the difference is that it's handled more maturely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Unlimited Bait Works  <br> I'm not gonna read the source material which will let me understand basic things about the series because I'm too busy on /a/ :) <br> Why the fuck is this series so confusing!? <br><br>This is why I hate secondary's. If you haven't/don't/won't read the fucking source, all of your complaints are literally invalid. YOU ARE GARBAGE.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It was reeking of sick pedo/lolicon bait, as in the perverted kind.  <br>Really? I dropped it after three episodes because it felt too much like a shoujo anime.</br></br>  <br>I mean what would you rate above it? When the medium is 99% "pick a girl CYOA" stories even something mediocre tends to float towards the top.</br>    <br>The wiki is enough.</br>  <br>Nice trips dude.</br>  <br> READ THE TERRIBLE AND OUTDATED VN <br>How about no.</br></br>  <br>Based on my egs ranking I have 68 VNs ranked above it<br>On 423 rated</br></br>  <br> HF handled more maturely than F/Z <br>Oh really?<br><br><br>Well I'm not so sure. I was feeling kind of odd the day I watched it, so maybe my perception was twisted.

I avoided FSN for all these years now (not out of dislike for the premise or anything) and just recently finished all the routes of the VN. I wouldn't even say it is close to bad, it's more like slightly above average. it is very engaging and enjoyable and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it.<br><br>I haven't even watched the anime adaptations but I can see a mile away how they can't really adapt some things from VN to anime, especially because a lot of the things that makes FSN more engaging is Shirou's narration and the exposition that comes from that.</br></br></br>  <br>Better than FSN, duh.</br>  <br>Muramasa, Oretsuba, Baldr Sky, Cross Channel, Saihate no Ima, Asairo, Dies Irae, White Album 2, Himawari, Albatross</br>  <br>I'm not sure what to tell you.

Half the time I was watching Illya I was hoping some other character would show because I didn't care about Illya and miyu at all.</br>  <br>I liked it better because I feel like the story translates well to anime, and Nasu is honestly bad at writing prose, even though I liked the plot of UBW itself.</br>  <br>You're going to love 3rei</br>  <br>Don't be so quick to blame Nasu; Mirror Moon is a wonky-ass translation.</br>  This is the objectively best way to describe Fate/Stay Night.  <br> /r/ <br>Why mention that here?<br> MAL <br>I doubt that MAL's worth considering.<br> /u/ <br>After Madoka, anyone would be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't read it in Japanese yet, and of course FSN was translated by a highschooler who can't speak English, but I think it's still evident that Nasu is more verbose than he needs to be.</br>  <br>Nah, Fate Zero is pretty edgy, it has a lot of edge that serves no purpose to the story. And the characters are port parole of some pseudo-philosophy instead of being people. And there are cute girls in Fate Zero as well, they're just put there to satisfy a different kind of target audience: The sadistic lolicons.<br><br> harem <br><br>The most favored route (UBW) has only 2 at most girls who like the MC.<br><br>F/Z doesn't have a proper story because it doesn't tell any themes properly.

The biggest complaint about UBW (other than secondaries upset that it isn't a sequel to F/Z and MAL autists being even more cancerous than the ANN reviewers) is that the story just doesn't work as a stand alone product. It relies too much on the Fate route or Fate/Zero to work. It's sad to say, but the UBW adaptation is likely going to be remembered as a stepping stone for the HF adaptation actually being able to be a fantastic adaptation. UBW is really only enjoyable or TM fans.</br></br>  READ THE VISUAL NOVEL<br>READ THE ZERO LN<br>WATCH THE ZERO ANIME<br>WATCH THE UBW ANIME<br>ENJOY OTHER TYPE-MOON WORKS<br>WAIT FOR PORKSLOPE ANIME TO GET ANNOUNCED BEFORE HF SINCE IT'LL PROBABLY BE KIZU 2.0 NOW THAT PEOPLE WANT UFOTABLE MAKING THEIR ANIME AND NEVER ACTUALLY COME OUT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it has a lot of edge that serves no purpose to the story <br><br>So what do you call Gilgamesh sucking mana from orphans that look like they came out of Auschwitz?</br></br></br>  <br>Shitty outsiders are the only ones who post about how great Urobuhi is</br>  <br>In HF? Sure but not as much as F/Z. At least the edgy stuff in HF makes sense in terms of plot.<br><br>Caster's bullshit was not necessary and it was more edgy in the LN. <br>If you're going to have characters spout pseudo-philosophy left and right, you better have a fucking message.<br><br><br>At least that wasn't thrown in your face throughout the whole route. Caster's bullshit took over at least half of the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  VN readers go back to   Appropriate anime watch order (with no VNs):<br>Carnival Phantasm &gt; Prisma Ilya &gt; Fate Zero &gt; UBW &gt;  Tsukihime  &gt; DEEN/Stay Night</br>  <br> ignore everything else from the Fate franchise <br>You do know there are other Fate series even better than Zero and Stay Night, right?</br></br>  <br>Newfags go back to <br>Mongrels</br></br>  <br>You have to be the biggest retard to believe Shirou is a self insert.<br><br>Yeah, a character who can only associate being happy with saving people is a self insert... You're mentally distorted if you can self insert as Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's also really, really stupid outside of fight scenes.</br>  <br>Please, your average Fatefags who only read F/SN is gonna get slaughtered by those autistic /jp/sies. Only here can they maintain their air of superiority in their little hug circles.</br>  <br>r/anime is Reddit, not /r/ you baka</br>  <br>I guess we just have a different opinion, then. I hadn't seen anything Fate-related for quite awhile until the UBW anime came out and I didn't find anything in UBW hard to follow.</br>  <br>Typo &amp; yes I know that. I'm just wondering why Reddit would be mentioned here. Then I got  as a reply to explain things.</br>  <br>That's like /tv/ and /lit/ with /got/.</br>  <br> Watching the one based on in-jokes first <br> watching it at all without reading VNs <br> Being retarded </br></br></br>  <br>Self-insert is a buzzword anons use for any character they see as lesser than them, just like Gary stu gets used for any character who accomplishes anything without bleeding from his nipples or crying</br>  <br>/lit/ only talks about GOT to shitpost, dude. It's mostly /christianity/ and /phil/ now.</br>  <br> Slaughtered <br>More like all they'll do is list some non translated VNs like they always do with any translated VN EOP's praise just as they did with MLA and refuse to try and argue on the same ground as the people they're discussing the VN with because they don't want to reveal how shit their taste actually is, hence them choosing to hide behind a language barrier. People on /jp/ think Mahoyo is Nasu's best work anyway. Why the hell would you care about people with taste as shitty as theirs?</br></br>  <br>Considering you lack evidence for your arguments, that means you're talking out of your ass.</br>  Danmachi was better.  <br> I was only pretending to be retarded </br>  <br> Better than the alternative </br>  <br>Just like this retard  can't even provide any argument as to why his favorite VN are better than FSN?<br><br>I've seen morons do this over and over again in /a/. <br><br> This anime is bad because there are 10 anime that I just looked up that are better </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people said MLA was good <br>This is the last time I trust /jp/</br></br>  <br>Look at this filthy secondary.</br>  <br> Implying any of Nasu's work isn't that shit </br>  <br> characters are better crafted in Fate Zero <br><br>Yes the, "Hurr durr I was king of much of the Old world but I'm just going to read books and play vidya with this kid instead of coming up with actual tactics which is more akin to my character" is not good writing.<br><br>FSN Servants made more sense and were more like their mythological counter part (if you ignore Gil but he's the same shit in F/Z)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Asking for "arguments" is pretty fucking stupid, I didn't come here to start one anyways<br>I don't need to debate with someone who can't even verify my statement, I could say anything and you wouldn't be able to prove or disprove it so what is the point?<br>Learn japanese and see for yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br> dissing MLA <br>shit post</br></br>  <br> I didn't come here to start one anyways <br>You did. Do I have to quote you verbatim or am I just going to assume you're that retarded; you actually know what an argument means and you were just acting like a retard for fun.<br><br> I don't need to debate with someone who can't even verify my statement, I could say anything and you wouldn't be able to prove or disprove it so what is the point? <br><br>I doubt you even know Japanese.<br><br> Learn japanese and see for yourself <br>Typical /jp/ bullshit to avoid having people criticize their bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is the original Illya gonna make an appearance? Or am I going to have to live with Kuro? <br>Kuro is pretty much the closest you're going to get<br>If it makes you feel any better there's a lot less fanservice in 3rei compared to 2wei, especially if you ignore the side-chapters. Everything is a lot more serious. Kuro spends most of her screentime actually fighting and displaying the character development she got during 2wei.</br></br></br>  The only type moon show I liked was Carnival Phantasm.  <br> hey im going to fuck my servant <br><br>Is not good writing.<br><br> hurr im going to fall deeply in love with my master <br><br>Is not good writing.<br><br> hurr my semen gives mana most efficiently <br><br>Is not good writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> actually arguing any F/Z Servant is better written than their F/SN counterparts <br>Team COOORU automatically invalidates your entire post</br></br>  <br>And that's the only things that happened in the whole VN right</br>  <br>So you know nothing about writing. Glad to know.</br>  <br> If it makes you feel any better there's a lot less fanservice in 3rei compared to 2wei,  <br>Why would that make anyone feel any better?</br></br>  <br> hey im going to fuck my servant <br> hurr im going to fall deeply in love with my master <br>Makes more sense than Kiritsugu's edgy "hurr durr Imma cheat on my wife so I can betray her better".<br><br> hurr my semen gives mana most efficiently <br><br>What the fuck did you think Sakura getting rape and Kariya getting the worms were for?<br><br>You should read the F/Z LN, it states clearly why.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the only type moon show I liked was kara no kyoukai and I'm hoping for a mahou tsukai adaptation.</br>  <br>Not all of us have functioning nutbladders</br>  <br>And you can, without any doubt in your mind, say Fate/SN is good writing?<br><br>Can you really lie to yourself like that?</br></br></br>  <br> look at me I'm an expert on writing, I have an English degree and everything! </br>  <br> I'm just going to read books and play vidya with this kid instead of coming up with actual tactics  <br>Sounds like Alexander to me. Leave it to Alexander to use the oblique order for the nth battle while he fondles Hephaestion in his free time.</br></br>  <br>Are you more qualified than I am to say that it's good?</br>  <br> FSN Servants made more sense and were more like their mythological counter part  <br><br>Oh I'm laughing for real. Kawaii uguu Saber whose only personality is being a glutton is like King Arthur.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy but your only basis on bad writing is using it as a buzzword. Why do you think you have a say in anything?</br>  <br>You have yet to provide a single example of good writing in Fate/Zero<br>All you've done is imply sex = bad writing which is profoundly retarded, even though nobody is going to argue Fate route is well written, and even though all of that is completely removed in Realta Nua which has been the definitive version of the story since its release</br></br>  <br>Not even that anon but I never watched the F/Z anime but read the LN, How the hell they could forget that shit?</br>  Before Ufo fags like OP would get told read the VN and that would be the end of it.  <br> edgy stuff for teenagers <br> Kirei is a good character </br></br>  <br>Based on what you posted, yes.</br>  <br>It's not a masterpiece but it has its moments.<br>We all just need to calm down here.</br></br>  <br>We're talking about F/SN, not Carnival Phantasm</br>  <br>There are multiple components to making something well written. There are aspects of how FSN is written that are worse than other works, but FSN is also superior in other aspects of writing compared to those same works. You throwing out buzzwords and not being able to form a competent argument doesn't make FSN poorly written.</br>  <br>Saber kills Shirou if he doesn't feed her enough in Fate</br>  Fate animefags get told to read the VN, Fate VNfags get told to learn Japanese and read better VNs.  <br> There are aspects of how FSN is written that are worse than other works, but FSN is also superior in other aspects of writing compared to those same works <br><br>You sure said a whole lot of nothing<br>It's pretty funny you complain about buzzwords when you can write shit like this</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly if you are into anime, manga, and similar things you may as well just learn Japanese. Then you don't have deal with no translations, shitty subs, no scanlations, etc.</br>  <br> a lot of edge that serves no purpose to the story <br>Caster was a nuisance and a hint that there was something fucked up with the whole Grail. I'll give it to you that his arc was fairly dumb, but at least it had the characters cooperate, and had Saber show her power and nobility to the others.<br><br>The other characters were fairly good representations of people staying true to their personality/ideals, and there was a big mix of these. I don't know why you would call any of them a pseudo-philosophy. They were all straightforward yet well fleshed out no-bullshit ideologies/personalities.<br><br>I don't know what you mean with sadistic lolicons. Rin wrecked the psycho and saved a lot of children. Wormgirl (I'm afraid I forgot her name) had to suffer for the sake of conforming to F/SN, and she was put entirely in the background (hence I can't even remember her name).<br><br><br>Obviously I was really just referring to F/SN. Illya and Carnival and stuff wouldn't really count unless you really stretch it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The series also attracts a lot of narutofags and saofags <br>You're so wrong, young one. First off, Urobuchi is a disease. And everything attracts "narutofags" and "saofags" (incorrect buzzwords newfag) nowadays, nothing's safe. Also, If you didn't read any of Nasu's work thus you don't get the nasuverse, thenn you can't argument against it blah blah blah. <br><br>Fate series is old, people don't need to care about it if they didn't like it, unless they're either bandwagon or wannabe faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure there are issues with the VN. The pacing can be bad and the exposition is too repeated, especially in the first days. Also the way certain exposition is delivered is overused, like Rin or Kirei having to explain.<br><br>But its strength is heads and shoulders above F/Z's strenghts. Really the only good thing about F/Z is that it actually feels like a battle royale but Fate was always about the characters which F/Z falls short<br><br><br>He's saying that it's relative in certain aspects.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fate series is old, people don't need to care about it if they didn't like it, unless they're either bandwagon or wannabe faggots. <br>I would say one should generally care about a show if it's a genuine ~9/10, which F/Z is no matter what you say.</br></br>  <br>With reading comprehension that poor, you shouldn't be talking about the quality of written works at all.</br>  <br> He's saying that it's relative in certain aspects. <br>It's relative in every aspects, and that's a whole lot of nothing.<br>Anyone with a brain understand that much instinctively, it's fucking stupid to say something like this so bluntly.<br>I mean "it's better in some aspect and worse in other" basically, this is one of the most empty line I saw in a while<br><br><br>How about you grow a brain first?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> at least it had the characters cooperate, <br>Right, because that makes so much sense to have most of them cooperate when they're in a war.<br><br><br> I don't know why you would call any of them a pseudo-philosophy. <br><br>Because utilitarianism isn't saving 10 people over 5. It's about utility. If there's a doctor within a group and not in the other, that group has more utility.<br><br><br> I don't know what you mean with sadistic lolicons. <br>Do I have to remind you about all the children that were tortured/killed "on screen" besides Sakura?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the anime has about 5 minutes of god tier action and 10 fucking hours of people conversing in dark rooms<br><br>it had all the time in the world for characterization</br></br></br>  <br> It's relative in every aspects, and that's a whole lot of nothing. <br>Arguably the stupidest thing I've read this week. That sentence doesn't make any sense logically.<br><br>How can a relation which is something be nothing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Like what.<br><br>Disregarding the terrible dialogue, nonexistent pacing, lack of dramatic tension, what exactly does F/SN do well?<br><br>The only noteworthy is the elaborate universe and the billion rules that goes on in it, but times and times again characters break those rules make the whole world building completely pointless. You know what's similar to F/SN? Mahouka, it's the same overly verbose dialogue that says nothing at all, the same world building that sounds like it came out of a textbook, and the same story whose scenarios should be exciting but the execution made me not care about either at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> FSN gets hate because it's based off harem VN <br> Steins gets praised when it's harem VN as well <br><br>There is literally nothing wrong harems.<br> inb4 pandering <br><br>Every series panders, that's not an excuse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> makes so much sense to have most of them cooperate when they're in a war <br>Yes, because they're bound pretty much by contract to keep civilians as safe as possible.<br><br> utilitarianism <br>Which of Kerry's actions make you think he applied utilitarianism wrongly? You gave an example that didn't actually exist in the show.<br><br> all the children that were tortured/killed "on screen" <br>Do you even know the meaning of "lolicon"? Also, why do you say "on screen" when you mean off-screen? That's not how you use quotation marks. You just said one thing and meant the exact opposite.<br><br>Come on anon, you're not making any sort of sense. F/Z was a top-tier show. F/SN is comparatively shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How can a relation which is something be nothing? <br>I meant the line itself was a whole lot of nothing, that's why there was a comma</br></br>  <br>Maybe because S;G characters had substantially more personality to them.<br>F/SN is retarded enough to put the character who is supposed to be almost-strongest and most noble in an utterly humiliating position for the sake of male power fantasy. Talking about Saber. The way Worm was being tortured in a latex suite wasn't exactly very sensible either, not to mention her omg so loyal imouto antics. And then how the evil magician comes out to be a kawaii uguu elf who for some reason submitted herself to some weird psychopathic murderer because omg he's so manly. Rider not much better.<br><br>It's a big pile of crap I swear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, disclaimer: I haven't watched S;G yet. But from the impressions I've gotten, it probably doesn't pull off any feats of F/SN level idiocy.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with male power fantasies.</br>  <br>It's hard because nobody wants to read. People who want to watch braindead anime like current shounen or anime that aren't adaptations at all try to get into the more interesting stuff and are expecting to be fed all of the information without using their own brains.</br>  <br>I'd use my brain to learn Jap and read a better VN.</br>  <br> latex suite <br>What?</br></br>  <br>You are implying as if F/SN is anything like a real book, at best it's a cyoa gamebook.</br>  <br>Define "real book".</br>  <br> Humiliating position for the sake of male power fantasy <br>If you're talking about the relationship with Shirou, keep this in mind,<br>Saber is the same age as Shirou, never got to live a real life, never got to love anyone, so that relationship isn't too bad and has nothing to do with power fantasy.<br><br> Latex suit <br>Deen stay night isn't cannon so your statement is invalid<br><br> loyal imouto antics <br>You haven't read HF so you have no idea what your'e talking about.<br><br> kawaii uguu elf who for some reason submitted herself <br>You either didn't watch ubw, or you didn't pay attention to caster's story, because that's completely wrong.<br><br> Rider not much better <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127301581#p127311066">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cyoa books aren't books </br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #6<br><br>Don't give up now!

It's pretty nice, I think you'd like the design if you didn't see it before.

I didn't notice from the earlier WIP that she  maid  it in. I'm looking forward to the end result.</br>   Salmon will never draw her   <br>your waifu's really cute and so are you, kaedebro<br><br><br>e-eh, maybe next time, i guess?</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Tamamo dressed as your favorite shipgirl or abyssal girl. If you don't like Kancolle then anything is fine. I'd love to see more of her in her casual outfit as well.  <br>thank god</br>  Requesting Crona doing something comfy in the blue sweater outfit (bottom right). Anything else would be fine too.<br><br>Thanks!</br></br>  Requesting C.C. cosplaying as Tama.  Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune leading her hyakki yakou or wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.  I'd like to make a request for Makise Kurisu. Any theme you're interested in drawing would be fine with me whether it's comfy, cute, lewd, etc. If you could find a way to incorporate either a lab coat or Dr. Pepper, I'd be very happy.<br><br>Thanks again for taking time out of your day for this</br></br>  <br>It's cool, I know you're busy with your own thing. You should check it out though, the quality is really good, which is lucky considering it's her only figurine. The's hair is extremely nice though, given how it's modeled in layers with individual hairs waving through the air. The pipe is painted and detachable too, but due to the wonky finger it sometimes falls down, not that I mind much. My only real complain is the stand itself, since it angles her downward so she's practically looking at the floor, so I need to adjust and angle her properly so she looks forward.<br><br>It's pretty good though, it beats out the art book by a small margin. After looking through it, I've only seen a few pictures online but no full scans. It's unfortunate too, given how much extra content there is in there, including interviews with the two main VAs as well. Also a helpful timeline in there too, which is good for clarifying dates. I'm not sure how many fans have the official art book, but I'm glad I managed to get a copy. I wish she had more merch like other characters, but for the little bit she does have, it's all pretty high quality. I'm happy I could support her series and her creator like this, not to mention being able to see her fig every time I look to my side. I guess you could just call it dedication you could say, even if it's just money being spent. I mean, who wouldn't have merch of their waifu, right?</br></br></br>  <br> waifu has maid costume <br> still missed maid collage <br>Oh well maybe next time.</br></br></br>  Requesting my lovely wife, Yuzuko, getting a brain freeze from eating shaved ice. However anything would be fine.  <br>  that you scanny? </br>  Requesting my lovely flower being lovely as usual.  Requesting Rikka Takanashi in a wedding dress, or anything cute would be appreciated as well. Thank you drawfriends for putting up with all our shit to get us our waifus you truly are awesome.  <br>Many people buy figs. Many people haremfag, too. Not many people troll in the same way for four years, though, so that at least sets you apart. It's too late to patch it up, son.</br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit.

I hope it's worth the time and effort spent, it'd suck pretty badly if you got the wrong guy too, that'd be a lot of wasted time. <br><br>Oh yeah, and if I could make a suggestion? There's a lot of stuff you could call other anons, but I'd avoid "son" if I were you, makes you come off as being a bit condescending you know? Not good for your reputation, know what I mean?

Tasteful lewds are kinda borderline ok. <br>basic rule of thumb is - if the OR didn't request lewds in particular, steer clear.</br></br>  <br>Just don't be a piece of shit asking for your "waifu" to be fucked by a thousand horse dicks and nobody will care.</br>  <br>Some people like lewd, some people are neutral towards it and some despise it. You'd need to ask the specific requester. I dunno how many people here would like a thick load blown on their loved one.</br>  <br> head pats fix everything  <br><br>My African American male next of kin.</br></br></br>  <br> I hope to see you draw her smile someday <br><br>S-sorry. Take this for now. It's just a sketch but I hope it's not terrible.</br></br></br>    <br>Eyebrows</br>  <br>i dont mind as long as its cute.</br>  <br>thats pretty good nigga don't stutter<br><br> not OR </br></br></br>  <br> but I hope it's not terrible. <br><br>It's fucking  wonderful and I hope the OR appreciates it. Even for "just a sketch" you did very well. </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Not OR, but your art reminds me of how wonderful Bleach's girls are, despite everything else, almost makes me want to pick it back up, or at least keep an eye on it.</br>  <br>I want a picture of my waifu getting a head pat like this</br>  <br>OR here, it's great, thank you a lot! Hope you don't mind me asking, but  any chance of you drawing a dick inbetween her hands? It'd be really nice and I'd appreciate it tons. </br>  <br>Wow thanks, this is cute!</br>  <br><br>ah ok<br><br><br>o-ok<br><br><br>aight<br><br>yee<br><br>we all do anon<br><br>So basically, its perfectly fine to specifically request lewds, but you cant just show up out of nowhere with them.<br>Even if the OR said "anything with ____"?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cute. Please stay.</br></br>  <br>WHAT.</br>  <br>nice</br>  <br>Isn't that audere?</br>  <br><br>Better?</br></br>  <br>Is it?</br>  My King's face shines brightly and gallantly. Her noble aura inspires my complete and utter devotion. My sweet King is devoid of imperfection, from her golden mane all the way down to her sturdy legs, all are perfection in my eyes. The sight of my King is enough to give me a taste of paradise, her valiant emerald orbs displays true Nirvana. My heart is always at peace when the thoughts of my Lord engrave it. My soul is always tranquil when it seeks and craves for my Lord.There is no higher pleasure than my Lord to me.  <br>Shocking truth!</br>  <br>If they say "anything is fine" they are signing up for lewds too</br>  <br>"anything" usually doesn't cover lewd things. Some people have different opinions on lewd, some prefer things like that to not be posted in the thread, etc, etc. Unless the OR asks for lewd or you get their okay for it it's probably best to err on the safe side.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> &gt;Even if the OR said "anything with ____"? <br>Yes even then.</br></br>  <br>Was thinking the same exact thing.</br>  <br>Come on WoL, didn't you already get like 5 deliveries earlier this week?</br>  <br>Ehm, real OR here. That wasn't me. That was some other Anon. I swear.</br>  People don't actually really take that whole haremfag shit seriously right?  <br>So, normie, crossboarder scum, or retard that thinks waifu = favorite character. Which one of these pieces of shit best describes you?</br>  <br>If Sharkbro delivers these in the first thread we are going to have another disaster of a weekend aren't we?</br>  A little late in the bread, but oh well.<br>Requesting Shinjiro flipping through the channels on a tv, looking bored as hell; just coming out of the shower  no lewd please , or hiking somewhere pleasant.<br>Anything is also fine, thank you very much and I hope everyone remembers to take it easy.</br></br>  <br> Haremfag <br><br>You've been caught fucker.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does It matter though? In the end it really doesn't affect my deliveries. I thought you guys wanted drawings</br>  <br>he has EX Charisma<br><br>ok so tha--<br><br><br>ok 2/3 <br><br>no lewds unless specifically asked for, got it.<br> i mean if i really wanted to id just ask </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Answer the question, you sack of shit.</br>  Requesting RJ please!  <br>I can just not draw for you fags if you don't want me to. I just say, why does it matter in the end who I draw for or not?</br>  <br>That's silly, nobody would draw a thousand horse dicks. High hundreds, max.</br>  <br>Finally one of my blood brothers is back!, tonight we reach the Avalon beside our beautiful King, Cheers my Brother! I'm glad you're back</br>  <br>I'd hope for some weekend in the future, I hadn't imagined you'd do this so soon, are you trying to kill me? Between the twister and your lines illustrating her beautiful, happy face, the cute hand sign, this is the greatest high! I could sing! "Just a sketch" or no,t it's incredible! I love it, it's adorable, she's the cutest Thank you so very much Audere! have a fantastic week!</br>  <br>You already ruined your chances when you starting requesting other random kancolles. I was hoping you werent scum</br>    <br>  "it's just a sketch" <br>  actually better than most of us can do </br></br>  <br>Nice job!</br>  <br>If you're going to draw for haremfags then I don't want your shit</br>  <br>Holy balls</br>  <br>It doesn't. Just draw what you want, and ignore the shitposters</br>  <br> this is the greatest high! I could sing! <br>real cute.</br></br>  <br>I bet you're the type of cancer that bitches about not getting a delivery.</br>  <br><br>Simply stunning, I needed a minute to compose myself fully. The dazzling image of my King is truly awe inspiring. I have no way to express the level of gratitude I have for this and all the others made for the day such a pitiful existence like me was spawned. There could be no greater feeling than love right now, thank you greatly drawfriend.<br><br><br>I really did not expect a presences like mine to have any impact. I am sorry, I am a vile man unworthy of love.<br><br><br>My day just gets better and better, seeing new images of my Lord and King grants me the strength to try my grandest each and everyday. Thank you my comrade.<br><br><br>I have a backlog problem that I always wish to resolve but I have not as of yet. Still, I will make my presence known a bit more now, I missed and love you comrades.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most artists really don't care and just draw what they want. Only people really assblasted about that shit are those who barely get deliveries, so they shitpost about something</br>  <br>Everyone that requests 2hu is the same person too!</br>  <br> Thank you my comrade. <br>y-youre welcome!</br></br>  <br>Did you see that guy who keeps requesting those anime characters? What a haremfag</br>  <br>I like you. Keep being you.</br>  <br>I took the request about Mako's outfit out because I thought it was uninteresting or nobody wanted to draw it so I kind of gave up on that but I'm so happy you drew it. This is absolutely beautiful, thank you so much and I hope you have a wonderful day and week.</br>  <br><br>Ah, somehow I missed that. Sorry about that, but wow, that's really great - you made the movement come across well! I should probably have expected that you'd draw her in her uniform though, it is the outfit most shown in my reference after all, but it's very cute (if a little lewd, but that's pretty cute in it's own way too). Thanks ever so much!</br></br>   she hasn't been drawn yet <br> desperation kicks in <br>Where's the circle? Flockmod or stream or wherever</br></br>  <br>Who is she? I can offer a 2-minute sketch only at this point, if you want to.</br>  <br>Just draw and request what you want. If you're not a loud faggot that shitposts a lot, who cares?</br>  <br>Be patient, Anon.</br>  <br>I get deliveries consistently and constantly including from the circle</br>  <br>Hold out man, you never know when you can get hit with deliveries, it can happen to anyone.</br>  <br> it can happen to anyone in the circle <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br> all the new sudden kancolles the same weekend RJ was drawn. <br><br>yeah im sure it isnt the same person</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny when people get asked who's in this "circle" noone has an answer.</br>  <br>Have faith! So long as you keep HOPE alive and don't give into DESPAIR she'll definitely be drawn.</br>  <br>I miss the pity deliveries on Sunday.</br>  <br>Ace detective.</br>  Requesting waifus with dicks, balls optional  <br>Like who?</br>  <br>I used to be convinced that you're fucked once its sunday, but it seems like theres quite a few paper and pencil people who might still be working on it.</br>  Requesting her sunbathing, or lying in some grass, please. Or maybe in a sundress Thanks for stopping by!  <br>Who is she?</br>  <br> implying he knows </br>  <br>Excelent taste. I hope the anime gets some more seasons because Ranko gets some pretty cash scenes later on.</br>  Beginner drawfag here, if anyone is desperate enough to get a delivery I would be happy to try and give you one the best I can.  <br>cute as hell, thank you very much, her expression and pose with the legs makes it even better, I like it!</br>  <br>I wasnt to bully you, but I simply can't. Damn you.</br>  <br>It was just a bunch of random shit requested in the same format like "Requesting Kaga"</br>  Requesting Squid butt  <br>draw Urakaze in sport clothes please</br>  <br>You should just pick one you want to draw and hasn't been drawn yet drawfriend, pass around some hope.</br>  <br>you're a qt Hotaru-chan</br>  <br>Like who?</br>  <br>could you draw me Nanami pulling her hoodie over her head so she can take a nap?</br>  <br/>  <br>I was going to draw her in something more suitable but I wasn't sure if that was okay.<br>And sorry that its so lewd, I wasn't planning on that it just kinda happened.<br>Im glad you like it.</br></br></br>  <br>Except the second cour starts soon.</br>  <br>First time in these threads, I hope I did okay!</br>  <br>Its Sunday. Anything you are willing to draw is very appreciated. Good luck.</br>  <br>do you have any works?</br>  <br><br>Would you use your craft to depicture my Momo, please? I'd heartily appreciate it.</br></br>  <br>Bit shakey, but honestly not bad.<br>Approved</br></br>  <br>Who is ranko?</br>  <br>Please don't link for me.</br>  requesting mochi please  <br>While I enjoy futa of my waifu, that's hardly something I'd request on the WWD.</br>  <br>No, I don't I just want to try and see what I can do. Even if it is bad just something to keep hope in peoples eyes.</br>  <br>That's a nice first time honestly</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Thanks!</br></br>  <br> desperate deliverer <br>shit, that's a god-tier name</br></br>  <br>Not the OR, but it looks good! Saved to my ever-expanding Hibiki folder.</br>  <br>OR here, nice job. Lines are a little shaky, but it looks good for someone's first time in these threads.</br>  <br> tfw no miyukifag </br>  <br>Your love and devotion for your king is an inpiration to me. You have my respect even if we don't serve the same lord.<br> And you're welcome. </br></br>  <br>Why did you deliver for this faggot?</br>  <br>Calm down, choco!</br>  <br>If it's something you want, nothing should prevent you from asking here.</br>  <br>Like I said, random ass kancolles, in the same format</br>  <br>It is something I want, but I won't request that here, it just feels wrong.</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll definitely work on that<br><br><br>Because Kobori a qt.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people pick on Kobolifag? Serious question, I thought he drew here too or something  <br>Because no one cares about your drawfag circle and their drama.</br>  <br>If you yourself feel that you'd rather not request it here, okay. But if what's discouraging you is the anti-lewd crowd, don't let it.</br>  <br> drawing Misha <br>it's shit.</br></br>  <br>Kobori is a cute, leave her and her husbando alone</br>  <br>It's just Choco shitposting. Pay her no mind.</br>  <br>He re-requested after getting a delivery in the collage a few weeks ago.<br>People give him shit because his delivery was "a full painting", which is strange, since the same faggots are always preaching that all deliveries should be seen as equal.</br></br>  <br>just colored/shaded anon</br>  <br>RJ and Tenryuu are the only kancolle requesters I can think of and they are nothing alike.</br>  <br>choco is a whiny little cunt and enjoys shitposting.</br>  <br>Nobody says that, but you should be appreciative of every delivery.</br>  <br>Days such as these are wonderful, connecting with comrades like you makes me feel less of a hollow shell of a man. My Lord and you comrades will make me whole.<br><br><br>I am a sick and twisted individual but as long as I serve in the name of my King, I can take pride in that one thing.<br><br><br>Your liege is a magnificent one for she has someone like you in her service. Rejoice for all of us are brothers and sisters under the same beautiful sky.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I just don't feel too comfortable requesting something like that in public, so it's not just in here. Especially since your waifu is basically your identity</br>  <br>Except for MSPaint no effort scribbles.</br>  I haven't seen an Accelerator request<br>Is choco even here this weekend?</br>  <br>Get out ryoufag.</br>  <br>Nah, she's on a cruise.</br>  <br> no effort scribbles <br>Hey guys, remember the collage?</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he said thanks and all that jazz. I don't see the big deal anyway.</br>  <br>That's what's funny; she's away at the moment.</br>  <br>There is too many shitposting for her not to be here.</br>  <br>I missed you WoL.</br>  <br>So if someone does a painting for me all I have to do is say thanks and then I can rerequest</br>  kubo should draw my waifu  <br>That's exclusive to the circle</br>  <br>sure you can, you'll get shitposted to hell tho</br>  <br>Seriously, it was just choco making a shitty blacklist to shitpost the thread. She admitted it in stream</br>  <br>I told you I was new and not so good, I tried though, hope you like it friend.</br>  <br>This level of Charisma has to be a curse or the work of a devil. I would follow this man's king if he was the general of her army.</br>  <br>Link pics</br>  Is there a white list?  <br> She admitted it in stream <br>Proof?</br></br>  <br>Not too awful, gj</br>  <br>Choco has mentioned having favorites before.</br>  <br><br>Sorry im not the guy who screencaps everythign I see in streams</br></br>  <br>Sure you're making shit up to shitpost? Gotcha.</br>  <br>I dont see why that is so hard to believe, have you ever seen choco in a stream?</br>  <br>I saw it too.</br>  <br>Thanks I was shaking the whole time, I am pretty nervous.</br>  <br> tfw he rerequested after one of those actually came from the heart from an honest anon for once <br><br>good to know he was totally full of shit</br></br></br>  <br>Stop being so cute anon.  My heart can't take it </br>  <br>Who?</br>  Requesting something cute of my lovely Nepgear.    <br>She was looking at the list, doesn't mean she's the one who made it.<br> Because I know who made it. </br></br>  <br> who </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>guy who draws tewi a lot and despite being active on pixiv because of his bookmarks, hasn't uploaded anything in over a year.</br>  <br> defending your underage girlfriend </br>  <br>eh, you tried I guess?<br>Looks like dA to me</br></br>  <br>Good job, anon!</br>  <br>Looks pretty nice.</br>  <br>Yeah, I figured. That's why I saved it for Sunday.</br>  Requesting shitty 2 minute sketches of my waifu  <br>Very cute</br>  <br><br> clean lines <br> cute <br> traditional media <br> very solid facial proportions <br><br>It's actually really good.

Glad you like it.<br><br><br>Happy (belated) birthday, WoL!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recognize every single fucking one and the only one whose series I've actually seen is Sawyer's. <br><br>Fucking please. A lot of effort went into that, and it shows, and I'm not just saying this to make drawfag feel better. If you don't think that's a fairly quality delivery, you're a faggot.</br></br></br>    <br> all those card games <br>I like you.</br></br>  <br>Just fucking stop<br>Goddamn circle</br></br>  <br> but I couldn't even recognize them. <br>Literally the only one I couldn't recognize was the top right guy because I don't know who he is in the first place.</br></br>  <br>hey its not that bad at all DD!!</br>  <br> Goddamn circle <br>Wut?</br></br>  <br>Thank you so much for drawing my husbando anon, you captured his likeness and even have him smiling!

How many fucking sabers are we going to have?</br></br>  <br>Thanks for this anon! Sorry I couldn't thank you earlier. <br><br><br><br>Daijobu, I'll try three regardless. <br>  though they will probably a bit rushed  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody cares about your shit waifu and you are not a nice person, remember that anon.</br>  Requesting my dear husbando Kakyoin Noriaki, this week I'd like to make a wedding related request while it's still June! Something like him wearing a wedding tuxedo would be amazing, but if drawfriend has other ideas, anything is greatly appreciated. Thank you if you consider drawing him and good luck everyone, have a good rest of the weekend!  <br>cute~</br>  <br>If it's not choco it's certainly was Audere.</br>  <br>No, if it wasnt choco it was miki, someone who hates the thread equally as much</br>  requesting something of this adorable little girl, all skill levels are welcome.  <br> Audere <br><br>Are you even being real</br></br></br>  <br> &lt;3 </br>  <br><br> audere <br>What? Hes a shitposter too!?</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone in the circle is</br>  <br> attentinwhoring avatarfag <br> not a shitposter <br><br>He does great drawings but behave like total faggot sometimes so it would not be a suprise for me if here were among people responsible for that "le black list of memes XD", since I think it was not done only by one person.</br></br></br></br>  <br>most of the people in the 3four stream chat are, seriously they hang out in there after the stream has ended to jerk off, I bet they dont even care about the art unless it is their waifu</br>   <br> <br> <br>Thank you, I appreciate it.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback, I would offer to draw her but I have to leave soon.<br><br>Im very glad you like it and thank you. <br> I usually make/scan a delivery every weekend but this page wouldn't fit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> here were <br><br>He were* typo</br></br></br>  <br>t-thanks<br> I'ts too bad I suck at all of them. </br></br>  <br>Upload to the booru separately?</br>  <br>Who are the regulars?</br>  <br>I havent been there recently but here is a list<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126711235 </br></br>  <br>It's literally circlejerk central in there</br>  <br>Here is a headshot, sorry if it isn't amazing I tried my best, have a great rest of the day.</br>  Reminder that this circle shit is just someone samefagging in an attempt to get deliveries for himself<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127220<wbr>468/#127228285</wbr></br></br>  What is her secret of her youth?  <br>It is weird for Oda to use two really similar names like that, but otherwise thats retarded<br><br>There's also this one, that Devil Dias is related to Bart because of the same name and chest tattoos.</br></br></br>  <br>She was given immortality by the last Ope-Ope user</br>  <br>I think there was some more to it, but it was basically "Kuma has a son" and, not really to support why that son is Bartolomeo. Something about the marines blackmailing him for loyaly.</br>  <br> What is her secret of her youth? <br><br>Nice grammar, shitpiece fag.</br></br></br>  <br>That is not wrong grammar, sillypants.</br>  Why is Marco Best  Pineapple?   <br>OF COURSE!</br>  <br>I can see it happening. Either Doffy or Law just casually saying ''Yea, some annoying hag got the immortality last time'' and we cut to Chopper with a '?' above his head. Cue Sanji's group.</br>  So, when the strawhats were sent flying by Kuma, did Kizaru just kinda walk back home and leave Rayleigh alone? Surely he told the other marines where he was.  <br>Despite being nonsense it may be.<br>I mean, how did she become the ZOMG GREATEST DOCTAH EVA?<br>Clearly she had a great master, who teached her everything she know and then used the Opi Opi no Mi to make her immortal so she could keep curing people forever.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Garp says to just leave him be, and that they can't fight Whitebeard and Rayleigh at the same time. Doesn't explain how he continues to live there though</br>  <br>Yea but it probably would have been a terrible idea to fight the Dark King and the World's Strongest Man at the same time. And they probably just let him do his thing since he isn't doing Pirate stuff anymore. Unlikely but probable.</br>  <br>Maybe no one actually cares about Rayleigh except Kizaru?</br>  <br>Kizaru said Rayleigh's "crimes" would not be forgotten.</br>  Why is Sanji so bent on sacrifcing himself? He tries to get himself killed for the other Strawhats multiple times.  <br>True but they might still have been busy with, you know, the War. And who knows, Maybe Akainu never heard about Rayleigh being there because he wasn't Fleet Admiral back then. Maybe Kizaru just didn't give enough shits by the time Sakazuki got promoted. Maybe he was devastated by Garp's and Aokiji's absence that he decided to let Rayleigh go.</br>  <br>Guilt complex from Zeff eating his own leg for him</br>  Guys. I had a OP dream.<br><br>What if luffy's awakening is him being able to chew objects like gum? He could spit gum to make people stop moving faster than him, and king kong their assholes?</br></br>  <br>Thriller Bark is literally the only one I can remember of the top of my head. Care to list a few examples ?</br>  <br> Maybe he was devastated by Garp's and Aokiji's absence that he decided to let Rayleigh go. <br>It was probably this. They would need multiple admirals to take down Rayleigh, and in the time after the war they lost 3 with 2 left</br></br>  <br>That sounds incredibly retarded. But then again, that is what Luffy is so maybe.</br>  <br>I was saying he was emotionally devastated but uh, yea, that works too.</br>  <br>I had multiple in mind but I forgot them. Another time was against Kuma aswell, on Sabaody, where he tried to sacrifice himself to save the others before he was warped.<br><br>I know that hey are more, but they are smaller where it's only apparent in one line of dialogue or so. I'm just too retarded right now to name the exact parts.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, but man do I hope to see her again. She was entertaining as shit.<br><br>moving on to more serious issues... big mom getting finally interesting when?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, TB and Sabaody was kind of the same scenario. And he knew about what Zoro did and knew Zoro still hadn't recovered, so it was kind of a given. Hell, even Zoro told Usopp to just leave him and run. Even Luffy told everyone to run. Not to be a prick but I don't think those are a good example. <br><br>The other one I can remember is him being gunho about dying at Baratie but Luffy talked some sense in to him and it was only because of Zeff. Do tell if you remember more though.</br></br></br>  <br>In four weeks is what I predict.<br><br><br>I know, I know, it does not sound like much, but I think there are more examples. I think I will reread it in the future and pay more attention to details like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the same thing to be honest. But the more i thought about it, the more it seemed an idiot like him would do it. Like use armament haki to chew up swords and spit it out like gum. then gomu-gomu would make more sense to me.</br>  <br>When the treasure bomb explodes. That'll be one huge misunderstanding.</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Well, I think Gomu is rubber so I'm not sure why it wouldn't make sense to you from Chapter 1. And I can see him being like ''Gomu Luffy'', kinda like 'Mizu Luffy' but not against in all fights. Gear 4 is kind of a given to be in most, if not all, fights from now on. <br><br><br>You take your time bro. Ain't no rush on stuff like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You take your time bro. Ain't no rush on stuff like this. <br>I planned to reread it anyway.</br></br>  Why are they people saying one piece is as good as ever? Are they lying to themselves?  <br>Rayleigh probably wouldn't have had much trouble escaping since he's been avoiding capture for twenty years. After that he was with Luffy for like a year so they probably just assumed he abandoned that house.</br>  <br>Save the pages when you see them so you don't forget.</br>  <br>Now Sentomaru can go tell his uncle that Rayleigh stopped them at Sabaody. The Marines still won't do jack shit about it but hey, at least they would know.</br>  I never considered it before, but wherever and whenever this final war happens, Rayleigh will probably be there too.  <br>No, he will die previous to tht for dramatic effect. Did you guys never read or watch any other series ever? The mentor dies before the final showdown.</br>  <br>Nah, I think Rayleigh will actually be alive to see Luffy become the Pirate King. Admittedly, this can be before or after the War.</br>  <br>Shanks is more in that position than Rayleigh</br>    rereading Shabondy <br><br> yfw rayleight <br> yfw supernovaes <br> yfw luffy punch the celestial <br> yfw Kidd is impressed <br> yfw Law is amused <br> yfw kizaru solo <br> yfw Roger flashback <br> yfw when kumas everywhere <br> yfw crew disband <br> yfw only 20 chapters <br> yfw besto arc </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shanks is an idol, not a mentor.<br><br>Well, probably both will die, but who knows?<br><br><br>Yeah, and it also has the best scene in the anime aswell, Rayleigh's entrance against Kizaru.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could watch Shabondy episodes over again and never get bored of it. That's how good this arc was.</br>  <br>Invading homes at night of nubile boys to drain them of their sperm.</br>  Kaido is obviously going to have a gorilla zoan  <br>That person must exist and be running around, otherwise how would books catalogue the Ope Ope ultimate ability?<br>I wonder if the immortal character is strong.</br></br>  <br>Sucking dicks everyday.</br>  <br>She shows up whenever Oda does his "catching up with old friends and family" chapters and has a chance at going to Reverie since Dalton seems to consult her very often.</br>  <br> Bruh <br><br>So long as someone has it...and wrecks shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I can never watch Saboady without getting tears every goddamn time. I know they're all fine, I know they all become ultimate badasses but goddamn it hurts so much to see them separate like that.<br><br><br>They don't have to be alive. They could just tell some dude and do it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think Kong is Luffy from the future?!?!?</br>  <br>Idols have even higher mortality rates than mentors do, and Shanks actually has an arch-enemy who is quite likely to become the final villain</br>  <br>100% agree.</br>  I've finally read Part 4 and I have to say it was really fucking good. Seriously why was it so fucking good? I mean the fact it had lots of sol shenanigans was so good. Also it felt fresh that Main Villain wasn't a guy that wanted to take over the world but one that just wanted a peaceful life. Kira was a goddamn amazing Villain. I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain when you have a character like Kira who was clever, cunning, and intelligent as fuck. He felt more complex than Dio could ever be. The Stands were far more creative and dangerous than Part 3 too. Part 4 was so much better than Part 3.<br><br>I really want David Productions to animate the Italian Restaurant arc so bad now. Delicious animated Italian food.</br></br>  I'm on Volume 39 right now and struggling to finish it. I'm only reading it for Jotaro. Too much hype.  <br>Finished it recently as well, and enjoyed it immenselly. One thing that bothered me was why Josuke never tried using Crazy Diamond on Okuyasu's dad.</br>  <br>How come? <br><br>Also Josuke is so much better than Jotaro.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a break from the usual formula. Colorful characters of all sorts of shapes and sizes, expressive art, humor, and a lack of urgency gave it a much more relaxed tone.</br>  It's arguably the best part out of the first 6 parts of JoJo. I usually say that's the point where shit gets really "bizarre". Instead of just a straight up shonen gauntlet<br>You should give the Rohan related spinoffs a read as well when you're finished.</br>  I loved the fact that Part 4 had a alien.  <br>I'll finish part 4 first then come back if this thread is still active.</br>  <br>I just finished reading Part 4 yesterday and the more I think about it, the more I dislike it. A lot of things were introduced but were never fleshed out. Josuke was introduced as having enough potential to make Jotaro back off, but he really only shows up half the time. Many characters are introduced and just hang around not doing anything. The crew aren't concerned about Kira or the Arrow as much as they should, so this part didn't have a strong main plot.  I actually just want more Part 1 and 2. <br><br>That said, what I liked was that when Josuke had his cool moments, he had them with style.</br></br></br>  Woah. It's almost as if there's a reason people tell animeonlys that Part 4 is excellent and to read the manga.  <br>Yeah it was alright, a shame  Reimi was a mega slut though. </br>  <br>he wasn't an alien, just a mentally challenged kid with great fashion sense</br>  <br>I think it's because there's nothing to "heal" there. Crazy Diamond can heal someone of their injuries, but something like Dio's cells going haywire would be a whole different level. It says CD can't heal diseases, so it might fall under that, too.</br>  Part 4 is really good, it's my second favorite part after 7. It's the first part where it feels like Araki knew what he wanted to do with the series, and it gains a feel totally unique. Josuke's great too.    Araki never managed to work in Josuke going back in time and saving himself.<br><br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>if he was an alien then his ability wouldn't have a stand name</br>  <br>My negro of comparable tastes. I think mid and late Part 4 was Araki's best art style as well.</br>  <br><br><br>it was intentionally ambiguous</br></br></br>  Who the fuck is Josefumi really with those shit ass eyes?  <br>I know it was meant to be ambiguous, but he's clearly a stand user<br><br>if he's an alien then he's related to the arrow meteor</br></br></br>  IF IT DOESN'T HAVE MICKEY, THAT SHIT AIN'T DISNEY!  <br>Just another mystery to add to the pile that have been introduced and still not solved for this part.</br>  <br>damn, that looks pretty damn good</br>  <br>Someone needs to compile a list of mysteries Araki has introduced but hasn't solved and ones we actually know by now.</br>  <br>He's the other half. It's said outright, isn't it?</br>  <br>I liked how you had this gang set up the whole way through. Instead of the plot starting up and the story saying "here are your allies, go fuck shit up," most of the enemies in Part IV ended up joining the gang. You had this buildup where the core Josuke-Jotaro-Koichi grew into a big movement of a bunch of stand users who were all tangled up in Kira's web.<br><br> Yukako best girl </br></br></br>  <br>If he's the other half, why aren't Jo2uke's eyes bright/dark instead of dark/darker?</br>  <br>I just adore late part 7. People cry sameface a lot, and maybe they're right, but it doesn't diminish the gorgeous art.</br>  <br><br>Koichi is the best girl</br></br>  <br>The color went to the other half of the fusion, that being the corpse that was identified as Kira.</br>  <br>Anyone have a screenshot of Kira's eyes?<br><br>I think i remember them being white, but I assumed that was because he was dead.<br><br>Whatever, I'll just take your word for it, makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I liked more Golden Wind &amp; Stone Ocean though</br>  <br>Just finished the manga, and they're right, especially in covers, Johnny and Gyro had the exact same fucking face<br><br>it was hilarious when Steel compared Lucy and the first lady as if you couldn't do that with every fucking character that part, clearly hot pants was behind this</br></br></br>  <br> liking part 5 <br>holy shit how is this even possible<br>it had the most hardcore and menacing stands, but that and bruno were the only good parts</br></br></br>  <br><br> not liking Mista </br></br>  <br>oh yeah I forgot about him, he was cool too, couldn't save the part tho</br>  How would you react if David responded to the "WHERE'S PART 4 TEASER" bitching and moaning by filling the blu-ray release of the Egypt arc with awkwardly spliced in scenes of Dio describing the Bow and Arrow in great detail, shots of Dio's baby sons, an unassuming white haired black man standing in the corner of every scene, and an entire extra episode devoted to babby shit-hair in the snowstorm?  <br> an entire extra episode devoted to babby shit-hair in the snowstorm? <br>wait, what is that?</br></br>  <br>Did you read Part 4?</br>  <br>oh you mean josuke, carry on<br>I didn't understand because his hair is perfect</br></br>  <br>so what happened to the invinsible baby</br>  <br> an unassuming white haired black man standing in the corner of every scene <br> It's official now that Gay Priest will never have a cameo in the SDC adaption <br> No Gay Priest animu until at least 2020. </br></br></br>  <br>Joseph adopted it</br>  <br>that baby grew up to be giorno, giving him yet more bullshit powers that don't get used, and making him even more of a mary sue<br><br>just making shit up, honestly invisibility is kind of a terrible power, so we'll never know</br></br></br>    Just finished Part VI and damn, I love Foo Fighters.  <br>He can fucking transform into shoes, though. How is that ambiguous?</br>  <br> reading it for jotaro <br>Hes one of the worst jojos though</br></br>  Am I the only one who got discouraged every time he checked the list of chapters and their names?<br> [STAND] PART 16 <br>It would instantly make me stop reading for a while, except for DIO and pretty much every fight in Part 4.<br><br>I'm struggling to finish Bohemian Rhapsody now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aliens could have transformation powers, too</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying; he's an alien. There's no doubt about that.</br>  <br>this late part 7 is best, part 8 has darker outlines and the art generally seems rougher</br>  <br>Well, there's also a stand that made Kenshiro come alive and terrorize Tokyo. It could be either, honestly.</br>  Can someone fucking explain Underworld to me?  There was a screenshot of some jap's twitter with anime-styled part four art, anyone have it? I'm assuming it's not legit.  <br>It's because part 8 has Ultra Jump scans while every other part has tank scans, and the scan quality itself varies wildly from chapter to chapter too.</br>  <br><br>It brings back the memories of the land it activates on irrc. The whole plane scene was making it reality and crashing Jolyne and everyone else in it. Or my loose interpretation of it.</br></br>  <br><br>So you could say that Versace was crashing the plane with no survivors?</br></br>  <br><br>That and using a football team to further the insanity of his stand.</br></br>  <br>It's a ruse by Doc.</br>  <br>I get what you mean but what's tank scans? like scanning the volume instead of the weekly release? or some online source?<br><br><br>well kind of like how certain things that you have bring about memories of certain things, underworld can pretty much use anything and bring back memories in evokes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Could Underworld re-enact 9/11?</br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of, how did Hermes use Kiss to hide both her and Jolyne in the bodies of the passengers who survived? I thought her stand only seperated shit with stickers, and when taken off it smashed shit together, hurting the person.</br></br>  <br>you have to wait for part 7 something like part 1 and 2 again<br><br>but it's worf the wait.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and some idiots took it for truth and spread it all over the place  I saw three posts about it on reddit, all 3 i'm going to assume got the info from tumblr or facebook </br>  <br><br>She doubled the passenger and she and Joleyne hid in the hollow between the two doubles and Joleyne stitched the doubles together with string<br><br>I think</br></br></br></br>  <br> like scanning the volume instead of the weekly release? <br>Well, monthly in this case, but yeah. By tank I meant tankobon.</br></br>  <br>something about that seems really iffy to me<br><br>then again I hated all of DIO's shitty sons and that stupid arc so who knows</br></br></br>  What the fuck was so dangerous about the snails that Weather Report made?  <br>if you touched one you became one</br>  <br>i see, my apologies i have never heard the term tankobon.<br><br><br>yes, and if it's anything like bohemian rhapsody then the whole world will see it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or just by looking at the sky/anywhere.<br><br>Pucci took out his sight during the battle to combat this.</br></br></br>  <br><br>that would be pretty cool actually</br></br>  Why didn't Underworld just bring King Crimson back? Or even Dio?  <br>it brought back a football player but all he did was make a catch, doubt it can bring people back fully just projections. plus i don't think he even knows about them<br><br><br>you can only defend against it if you're blind, which makes it almost impossible to fight against weather.<br><br>if you're fighting him and touch a snail you become a snail, if you touch a rainbow you explode into snails, and if you get caught in a reflection of extra bright light snails start growing on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but what's wrong with being a snail?</br></br>  <br>well for starters there were tons of bugs eating people because of the ability, i doubt anyone wants to be eaten alive by insects.</br>  <br><br>I'd just use my stand to kill the bugs.</br></br>  <br> The rainbows even hypnotized the bugs <br>Whoa.</br></br>  <br>duh</br>  <br>you can't even figure out how an ability works by reading it in the manga, if you had a stand i'm sure you wouldn't get very far with it unless you were spoonfed. like the guy who had sky high</br>  <br><br>What if my Stand's ability was to kill all insects within a 10m radius of myself and it was an automatic Stand?</br></br>  <br>then your stand could get you a job, nice</br>  <br>kind of ironic that you said that, since sky high is kind of similar to that stand you just made up.</br>  <br><br>Do you think you could use Sky High's rods as dildos?<br><br>I mean, assuming they didn't suck your energy out.</br></br></br></br>  Which Stand would be most dangerous to have sex with?<br><br>What Stand would YOU want to fuck?</br></br>  <br>Purple Haze or the Hand<br>Spice Girl</br></br>  What would Jotaro think of Jonathan?  <br>tags<br>hermit purple:all the way through</br></br>  If C-Moon touched your dick, would it turn into a vagina?  Gay Priest is coming.  <br>Away you homosexual deviant!</br>  <br><br>Gay Priest is here.</br></br>  <br>But anon, Steel Beams are Unmeltable.</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Killer Queen did 9/11.</br></br>  <br>He couldn't see stands</br>  <br>Or he was just rusing.</br>  <br>he's clearly lying/delusional about being an alien, why can't he be that about seeing stands?</br>  <br> koichi <br> not tonio <br>shit taste 0/10</br></br></br>  <br>one of his many stand abilities is that he cannot see his or other stands, of course</br>  Flicking through Egypt BDv3 and there are hardly any fixes on the D'arby gambler episode, and they were quality as fuck.  <br> clearly <br>It's purposely left ambiguous.</br></br>   #ジョジョ4部脳内アニメスクショ大会 <br><br>There's some pretty good mock ups under this tag.</br></br>  I get so disgusted whenever some pleb says part 7 was better than part 4.<br><br>Like, really? It was basically a copy of part 2, if you boil everything down. Are people just really gay for cowboys or something? The added Dio fanservice at the end was honestly just insulting, if you're going to bring him back, at least make it a neat fight instead of "lol check out your head in this bag bro".<br><br>It's a decent part. Top 3. Is it just having an ending that doesn't suck or consist of a total deus ex machina for the first time since part 2?

I've finished reading part 7 yesterday.<br><br>What I can say is the Diego Brando is the best Dio.<br>I wish he had succeeded.</br></br></br>  <br> Josefumi Kujo goes into a seperate universe in part 8 <br> He was the Josuke that helped Josuke </br></br>  <br> no DIO for next parts <br><br>I'm still mad about that</br></br></br>  <br>That's stupid.

Then they all play baseball.<br>Or it's a bunch of Alternate Reality versions...still playing baseball.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why he needs his own TP specialist.</br>  <br>Is anime at end of part3?<br>How do they slice it up?<br>Dio's kill</br></br></br>  <br> The manga has been out since the eighties <br> There are people who still haven't just went on Batoto and read it <br><br>I don't understand, Then again the lamest excuse i heard was "Lol its not moving so i can't get into it XDDDD".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not against reading, I love manga.<br>Why did it take them so long to animate though?</br></br>  <br><br>they did do the OVA back in the 90s or something. Then there was (or maybe before, idk) that terrible Phantom Blood movie thing which both araki and everybody else hated, so maybe people backed off from Jojo to be safe? I'm making shit up lol</br></br>  How did Kira even know what Bites the Dust could do if he can't remember anything about the loop? How did he even discover it? Did the arrow give him an instruction booklet or something?  The sol parts of Part 4 killed it for me. I mean if I want to read slice of life I read something like Bonnouji and if I want some le delinquent action I read something like Crows. <br>The balance between sol and stand action was so fucking ruined in DwK. Those who unironically liked it, I am sorry for your shit taste.</br>  <br>You mean Josuke.</br>  <br> reading it for autism: the jojo </br>  <br>Because Araki is awesome and refused many adaptations since they were doing a shitty job. You wanted JoJo adapted by Toei or Pierrot?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The fact that he could see stands proves it wasn't a stand ability. He really was an alien.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's this guy? why he has a better hairstyle than Josuke?</br>  <br>nope i wasn't for it lol</br>  <br> he could see stands <br>Are you mentally challenged?</br></br>  anyone have the drawing of polnareff posing like this?  <br>oh that's his twin, Josoke</br>  <br>Part 4:<br> Guy who saved Josuke as a kid <br> ayylmao's identity <br><br>Part 5:<br> The gangster who Giorno didn't rat out (possibly Diavolo) <br> Fugo leaving <br> How KC officially works <br><br>Part 6:<br> Whether or not Pucci and DIO had sex  <br><br>Part 7:<br> Why Johnny kept Tusk after losing all corpse parts <br><br>Part 8:<br> pic related <br> gangster baby <br> Josuke's identity <br><br>Am I missing any?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> &gt;How KC officially works <br>KC works because it works</br></br>  <br> part 5 <br> Giorno's reflecting ability showed at the beginning <br>I don't consider fugo leaving a mistery since he simply didn't want to challenge Diavolo and chickened out.</br></br></br>  <br> Part 5 <br><br>mind refreshing me on the part on the gangter who Giorno didn't rat out?</br></br></br>  I still don't understand what the fuck happened to Bucciarati after he got Kakyoin'd by King Crimson.<br>What the fuck happened? Was he dead? He wasn't? His body was dead but his spirit wasn't? How the hell did he do that?</br>  <br>Ohh, that makes sense, since Josuke has his pupils too right?</br>  <br>Watch that be Josefumi</br>  <br>crack cocaine<br><br>Giorno resurrected him somehow, or at least healed his body and then Bucciarati's will was so strong that he was able to return to it or something idk but he became a zombie and KC eventually destroyd his body beyond repair so he died again&gt;?</br></br></br>  <br>Won't be that long.</br>  <br>fuck you lol</br>  <br>yeah i love that bitch too</br>  <br>Short attention span. You probably have dyslexia too.</br>  <br> browsing reddit unironically and pretending we'll let that shit pass if you put it in a spoiler <br>Even /a/ is dead</br></br>  <br>I heard they can have sex with anything they touch.</br>  Highway star needs an OVA budget  <br>yeah well i heard you fucked a frog</br>  <br> yfw it's all in CG </br>  <br> doesn't consist of a total deus ex machina <br> part 2 <br>did you forget the volcano that conveniently shot Kars into space?</br></br></br>  <br>So go back to .</br>  <br> part 2 <br> not deus ex machina: the series </br></br>  <br>Do we get first dibs if the stands become a reality? I'll take Stone Free.</br>  <br>I wouldn't even fucking care if it was CG by the dudes who did the 20 second opening they could make a 12 minute episode and I would nut all over the place. In fact not even the whole arc but just the scene with the baby and the motorcycle if that was done in CG from the guys who make the opening that should would be fucking amazing.</br>  <br> censored beetle lick <br>Even the gooks believe in sasuga david</br></br>  <br>then go back to reddit.</br>  <br> Jo-Jo <br>Man I've heard a lot of shit but this is brand new to me</br></br>  <br> part 5 is adapted <br> yfw Risotto vs Doppio </br></br>  <br>He made it</br>  <br><br>I meant *couldn't. fucking chill</br></br>  <br>I couldn't find the chapter when I tried looking for it but during Giorno's backstory it revealed that as a kid he saved a gangster who was being tracked down, so to repay him he started telling the people around him to respect him. There's a theory it's Diavolo.</br>  <br> Unbreakable <br>Isn't the right name for it 'Diamond is not Crash' ?</br></br>  <br> you now realize that with the cheap production of CG, they could make early adaptations of later parts right the fuck now </br>  <br>That was the duwang title. The series was always called Diamond wa kurenai or some shit like that in Japan.</br>  <br>Except you haven't meant it.</br>  <br>I fucking did. My argument only works with that correction dumbass.<br><br>What the fuck is wrong with this thread's quality?</br></br></br>  <br>Summer</br>  When I look at Abbacchio all I see is Sephiroth  <br>ESTUANS INTERIUS <br>IRA VEHEMENTI <br>ESTUANS INTERIUS <br>IRA VEHEMENTI <br> SEPHIROTH  <br> SEPHIROTH </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ohh now I remember, thanks!<br>pretty interesting theory. unfortunately there's not really any evidence pointing one way or another that I can think of, so in the end it's whether you want to believe it or not versus how ridiculous it sounds. I wonder what Araki would think of it</br></br>  What if D4C finds an alternate universe in which it's Za Warudo Dio Only Knows?  <br>You mean exactly what happened?</br>  <br> I see what you did there.</br>  <br>I dont get it</br>  Part 7 is terrible at least because this is a part in which at least 3 Dios died  <br>Dio = God in Italian</br>  Remember guys only one who is capable of tanking Tusk Act 4 is Diavolo as he is not part of his predictions thus cannot be affected by anything happening in the skipped time. Act 4 is bound to dimensions so it cannot chase Diavolo in the skipped time.  <br>Oh, I just didn't get the reference</br>  <br>TWGOK</br>  Semen. Semen. Semen, is she.<br>Semen. Semen. Semen, to me.</br>  <br>Was I seriously the only one who understood corpse parts only let you get an stand no matter what, but if you *earn* the stand then you get to keep it?</br>  <br>It makes sense I guess but it's ambiguous to me how Johnny earned his stand over Gyro. Did it have to do with Johnny being handicapped at all?</br>  <br> SO <br> everything in the solitary confinement ward <br>   c-moons ability is to censor upon contact </br></br></br>  Part 4 is just so comfy and fun. What compelled Araki go in that direction?  <br>He just wanted quiet life.</br>  <br><br>I figured he just had characters that went through a long journey going to Egypt, he wanted to do a story arc where things aren't as intense.<br><br>Half the time, reading part 4 felt like an SoL.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing about that always gets to me.<br>When the fuck was a US fighter pilot shot down by a Russian MIG over Florida?<br>Some kind of sekret Cuban skirmish, or something? Fuck if I know.</br></br></br>  <br>It only has an active range over Florida.<br><br> Besides, Diavolo would just die again. </br></br></br>  <br>Have you read Uzumaki, anon?</br>   5 JoJo threads in the catalog <br>Did DiU get confirmed or something?</br>  <br>New Chapter got translated.</br>  <br>Because they're all about something different in jojo</br>  <br>Koichi really visits reddit?<br>NO DIGNITY!!</br></br>  <br>The sad thing is that they really think all the "le go back to reddit" shit is just a dank meme or something, they seriously can't imagine anyone not browsing a piece of shit site that solely covers heavily filtered content.</br>  Okay I just finished part 4 and what the fuck was up with present day Josuke saving himself and his mother in the past during the snowstorm.<br><br>I figured some shit was going to happen during his fight with Kira where either he literally 'fixed' the universe to go back or Bites the Dust would cause time travel shenanigans but it just never got adressed.<br><br>What gives?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally only getting your information about reddit from 4chan. </br>  <br> literally understanding less about the site you spend most of your day on than someone who never goes there <br>As expected from Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Oh boohoo they got rid of hate subreddits boohoo. Who the fuck cares? I go to reddit for discussions about certain interests, news, and for porn</br>  <br>Probably Araki originally had a plan that Kira went back in time to kill Josuke or set up killing him and Josuke got caught in it as well and saved himself. Then Araki went fuck it and ran Kira over with a ruck.</br>  <br>Sounds like some other time travel movie I've heard before.</br>  <br>If they ever make a part 4 anime this is the one thing I'd be okay with them changing.<br><br>Even something like  suggested would be better than what we got.</br></br></br>  <br>This is exactly what I was talking about. So utterly clueless that he can't imagine anyone not using Reddit.<br><br>It's a piece of shit site. I don't give a fuck about some "hate subreddit" bullshit, what matters is that all the content is heavily policed and filtered so only the most popular opinions are ever seen.<br><br>The fact that you actively want other people to police your thoughts under the guise of convenience means you are totally ill-suited to browse a site built designed around freedoms. You cannot even comprehend the concept of the word "freedom". There is no reason for you to be here aside from jerking off over how much of an epic troll you are for pretending to be retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  How many viagra pills Joseph had to take in order to impregnate Josuke's mom?  <br>Why can't you guys accept that it's just random high schooler with a huge pompadour that just wanted to help someone? Instead, you just insert these time travel plots.</br>  <br> I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain <br>because hes a likable jerk<br><br> Seriously why was it so fucking good <br>the SoL format make the fights seems less fillers<br>Kira is the best vilain beside part 7 vilain<br>josuke was a total bro and the whole cast was hilarious<br>jotaro works better as a mentor<br>it has the best art by far in the whole serie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the funniest thing i've read today. I can't take you seriously when you're basing this all from the shit you've read on 4chan and have never used it yourself. You can actually go to /new/ and see the newest posts that have been made regardless of the amount of votes.</br>  <br>thats great whoever made this</br>  <br>why is jojo so quotable</br>  <br>Because he's literally drawn the same as Josuke, is extremely mysterious, and the way he was inserted into the story heavily indicates later importance - it being never adressed again is just a shit payoff for what looked to be foreshadowing for something big.</br>  <br>Wow, one board has enough mods to offer such a basic feature.<br><br>Of course, you aren't actually seeing the newest posts. Anything that is particularly hated by the constant moderation team will be deleted before it even gets added to the "newest" pile.</br></br></br>  <br>After reading about the alien, do you expect any more?</br>  <br>It's pretty clearly just a storyline that Araki decided not to bother with.</br>  <br>I completely agree, but it was still a shit payoff.</br>  <br>I'm totally sick of pre-destination timetravel shit. It's better without it.</br>  <br>I just saw flashbacks as a nice explanation as to why Josuke gets pissed when you insult his hair. Nothing more than that.</br>  <br> the constant moderation team will be deleted <br>Are you literally this retarded? You don't know shit about reddit. I would suggest actually try it for about a week or two but i'm guessing you'll go on it and not even attempt to search and explore other subreddits and call it shit.</br></br>    <br>I hate to break it to you but while yes pages will get deleted by moderators. When sorting by new you just see the most recent things. This is not the default though and most posts are ignored or downvoted because people disagree so most people will never see them. Filters can also prevent shit I'm sure but that is probably about the same as a word filter.<br><br>This is why reddit is fucking shit. Took 15 minutes of using the site to figure this out. At least say why it is shit for the right reasons.</br></br></br>   Japan loves the Assassination Squad a lot to the point where even Pesci gets love. <br> Nobody in the West gives a damn except for the fights they were in. </br>    <br><br>10/10</br></br>    <br>New isn't on by default because that's not the general point of reddit. It's supposed to bring you "the best content" by using some kind of algorithm by amount of votes plus how recent the post is or something.</br>  <br>Precisely why reddit is trash. Just because "new" exists doesn't mean it is widely used.</br>  Why did part 7 have Dio win only to lose anyways because of a dirty trick? Just to prove that time-stop really is the strongest stand power after Jotaro proved himself king of jobbers in part 6?  <br>If new wasn't used that much than nobody would vote on posts and those posts wouldn't get to the front page.</br>  <br>You forget that comments work the same way which is another large issue. Unpopular comments are downvoted immediately. This means they have less visibility to most users.</br>    <br>True but you actually can filter comments by oldest, newes, or even controversial (comments that have a near equal amount of downvotes and upvotes.<br><br>I don't think they'll let you sort by comments or posts with the most downvotes because that might encourage people to downvote those posts even more than they already are. In a way you could say that downvoted comments or posts having less visibility is good because if they were more visible then people would just downvote them even more</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't Josuke. It was just a guy with a pomp.</br>  <br>Exactly that guy looks like Josuke because Josuke copied his style since he look up to the guy that saved him and his mother.Now get over it.</br>  <br><br>It´s not Josuke, and he styled his  cool  hair in honor of that guy.</br></br>  Last night I had a dream where I had sex with Gappy.  <br>Fuck off Karera</br>  <br>He has the same face and clothes as well.<br><br>It was definitely josuke. Araki just decided to abandon that plotline</br></br></br>  <br>the characters look retarded as fuck</br>   Jojo parts described in one sentence: <br><br>part 1: Great expectations with vampires, sunlight kungfu, and the titanic<br><br>part 2: ancient homosexual aztec vampire gods get trolled by british human bugs bunny.<br><br>part 3: An autistic jap, his gramps, a muslim, a metrosexual, and a frenchman all hunt down a british vampire banana man on the other side of the world<br><br>part 4: a quiet town has a fetish murderer, manga artist, and a couple of characters up to no good, while a gang of school kids hustle niggas left and right.<br><br>part 5: a group of gay fashionistas seek to find their pink hyena leader to save his daughter<br><br>part 6: women go to prison with a 10 year old boy while a gay black catholic priest ends the entire universe for his deceased gay lover<br><br>part 7: Paraplegic and an aspiring Italian comic race across america to find the corpse of jesus christ and kill the president while dinosaurs wait for them at every turn<br><br>part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Finally read the latest chapter.<br>Gappy used to look pretty  gay , huh.</br>  I need high Dio, talking about the greatest high.  <br>Stop.</br>  <br>fuck off to all secondaries</br>  best jojo right here  <br>He lost because Johnny had friends while he was riding solo.</br>  <br>Didn't you hear about Joseph's  unlimited sex drive ?</br>  <br> not understanding that hamon keeps you young <br><br><br> Unlimited sex OVA DRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE! </br></br></br></br>  <br> liking boring 1 dimensional stand of the week villains <br> Liking anyone in part 5 other than Bruno and mista <br> hating part 6 <br><br>Why does japan have such shit taste?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like because of plot contrivance. By all rights he should have been able to either escape that or at least kill Lucy. Based on when Dio met with himself the last 2 times.</br>  <br><br>who the fuck doesn't like Beach Boy, to be fair? Simple and apparently boring yet badass and extremely threatening in the end, like the character itself<br><br>But yeah, I didn't even keep track of who was in the squad.</br></br></br></br>  Would you ever get Converses like these?  Why did Pucci have Whitesnake for the Weather Report fight when he said that he lost Whitesnake before that?  <br> anon why are you wearing shoes of the same man wearing two different sets of clothes? </br>  <br> implying Araki's senile mind hasnt already forgotten about everything in Part 4 </br>  So yeah i posted this question last thread but it was on page 10 soo<br><br>What's your favorite Chapter Cover?<br><br> best husbando </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was that guy chuuni or an actual alien ?</br></br>  <br>I dislike that this makes him seem almost bored but at the same time I love it</br>  <br>You actually have the worst taste</br>  <br> johnny and gyro <br> same face <br>johnny face is round while gyro face is longer</br></br></br>  <br>I like the way your mind works</br>  <br>I think they liked the fights and just shifted it to the characters. Ghiaccio and Risotto's fights were the best.</br>  <br>But to the point of fujos shipping them?</br>  <br>Oingo/Boingo/Hol Horse &gt; every single Villain in part 5.</br>  <br>I'd be surprised if there wasn't fujo shipping with how gay and flamboyant everyone in part 5 looks</br>  <br>But Anon, the most dangerous stand was Star Platinum ZA WARUDO.</br>  <br> jobbed to a rat and a toy tank </br>  <br>*in every part</br>  <br>Pesci has like no chin and has a turnip for a head and yet fujos ship him.</br>  <br> He hasn't read Part 4 and 6 </br>  <br>Why was it so hard for them to figure out how to defeat SHA. I was sure it would have gone like this<br><br> Jotaro figures out SHA is heat based <br> ZAWARUDO <br> Puts SHA in a freezer <br> GG, Kira now has a frozen hand, something to identify him by. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro is retarded,that's not surprising. He solved literally every single fight in part 3 with<br> punching doesn't work <br> let's punch HARDER <br>this time it didn't work</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it me, or are her tits so big in this pic they've escaped her body and are leaving for orbit?<br><br>Not that there's anything wrong with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Star Platinum could have beaten SHA and Pucci if Jotaro wasn't such a jobber.<br><br><br>SHA tracked based on heat. I doubt putting it in a freezer would make it unable to to track them. Pretty sure it broke through a door before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you read it? Who did Kira lose to/was trying his hardest to avoid?<br><br>I was also only talking about part 4, just like OP was. So I wasn't talking about MiH, GER, Bohemian Rhapsody, D4C, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>You made a NOTORIOUS BIG mistake thinking SP is the most dangerous.</br>  <br>It's because of 「Gravity」</br>  You know that kickass bass line in Roundabout?<br><br>The guy that performed that is no longer with us.<br><br>http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/<wbr>2015/06/28/yes-bassist-chris-squire<wbr>-dead--67-after-battle--leukemia/29<wbr>426347/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Arigato... Chris...<br><br>That's all I can think of saying</br></br></br>  <br>Beach Boy and Grateful Dead were great because they actually had an interesting character arc in the short amount of time they were in it. Fuck the others though</br>    <br>Your pun may be mind blowing, but i'm talking about Kira himself said that Jotaro was the most dangerous as he was avoiding his ability to stop the delicate hands of time.</br>  <br>The Most brawlic 12 year old ever has to duke it out with the biggest douchebag ever, he's a vampire.<br><br>Brawlic's grandson teams up with Italians, a milf, and a Nazi to fight ancient Aztec homo vampires.<br><br>Another brawlic fuckface meets up with the Part 2 hero and joins with a milf hunter, a fuckwit, and their arabian friend to hunt that douchbag from Part 1.<br><br>Part 2's hero is a sleazeball and knocked up a chick in Japan, so she gave birth to Johnny Suede and now he and his friends have to fight David Bowie.<br><br>Douchbag vampire had kids everywhere, and gave birth to the most boring lifeform in existence, he is also the gayest and most OP of them all, accompanied by his equally homosexual gang.<br><br>The autistic guy from Par 3 has a daughter that he neglects the shit out of, so she goes all lesbo and picks up a group of misfits to fight a black priest working for the biggest douchebag vampire.<br><br>Father Bootylicious from 6 reset the fucking universe of it's part 1 all over again BUT IN A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE, now it's about cripples, gay cowboys, patriots, and dinosaurs.<br><br>A faggot sailor has an identity crisis and can't tell if he's an autistic oceanologist or David Bowie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kira <br> man whos never left duwang <br> judging stands only based on the ones hes seen <br><br>Oyecomova was way deadiler than killer queen and N.

RIP</br>  <br>with all the efforts of a 12 year olds humor, you managed to make it even worse.<br><br> Heheh It'll be funny if i use words like fuckwit, fuckface, faggot, and bootylicious. <br><br>You have to be 18 to be here.</br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone got the pic of whitesnake shouting about plankton scum  <br>Fujos seem to love Risotto and Ghiaccio a lot even though most people here only like their fights.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aEW<wbr>FfSdRtbg</wbr>  [ ]  <br> thecopypastad text <br> that image <br><br> not immediately recognising it as shitposting <br> responding to shitpostng </br></br></br></br></br>  Diamond is unbreakable is best title and the last few chapters were GOAT.

It has none of the embellishments Josuke had.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It has more strength but less speed and precision.

He just keeps his stand because he earned it.</br>  <br>Earned it mostly because he progressed though acts.</br>  <br>Nah, Pocoloco also gets a stand. It's mostly about unlocking its potential or whatever makes you fit your stand</br>  <br>That and the fact that they were fabulous gangsters.</br>  So now that the dust has settled, how well did part 3 sell?  <br>I don't think the last blu-ray is even out yet</br>    <br> cant unsee the similarities <br> every time i read part 4, okuyasu sounds like english dub kuwabara </br></br>  <br>Thanks, is there anyway someone could crop it so it's just whitesnake?

I'm starting to get burned out with monogatari. How many novels are left to animate?   Still waiting for commie   <br>You'd think the name suggests something but of course it's not the last one.</br>  Still no Kizu.<br>I'm not bothering until I can watch it.</br>  <br>Koyomi<br>Owari<br>Zoku owari</br></br></br>  <br>is this sequel of Oremonogatari?</br>  <br>It's a spinoff of Owari no Seraph.</br>  <br>And the prequel, Kizu</br>  You just know there is gonna be a giant ass collection that includes all the books and the anime for an exorbitant price.  <br>It'll probably be one of the biggest BD releases in the history of anime. Similar to that one TTGL release. It's probably going to sell out too.</br>  <br>everything  except for kizu </br>  <br>but it's just about to get good man. Tsukimono was utter shit, but Owari is GOAT.</br>   still no kizu <br>Well, at least it's something.</br>  <br> off by one from a palindrome </br>  <br>I got dubs anyway. Can't wait to tell my mom, she will be proud as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Sweet</br></br>  Good keep pressing and get this shit over with already. Its long since worn out its welcome and getting it done and all possible money made should convince them enough is enough  <br> mfw they decide to animate kuzi last <br>At this pace I wouldn't be surprised if it gets released 202X</br></br>   skipping Koyomimonogatari  <br><br>why?</br></br>  im still on fucking nise slow down fam  <br>Its been years nigga</br>  <br>and all the future ones nisio is yet to release</br>  But SHAFT already animated Kizu  <br>The novels are ongoing and will most likely continued to be animated for at least 5 or 6 years.</br>  <br>No, fuck you where's Koyomimonogatari</br>  <br>It's not like they've ever given a fuck about the novels' release order.</br>  <br><br><br>What happens in it?</br></br></br>  <br>alot</br>  <br>They are just a bunch of short stories of Araragi and all the girls he have met, but the sories are a little after he meets teh girl, for instance Koyomi Flower is with Senjougahara before they were a couple.<br>The important thing about Koyomi is that the last chapter is important for what happen next because  Gaen "Kills him" and we don't know what happens next until Owari Vol. 2 , If they animate Owari Vol. 1 it's okay I guess</br></br>  <br> The novels wrapped up for now as far as I understand. I know the guy teased he'd write more but time will tell if that's just a gag or not. Personally i still think it wore out its welcome quite a while ago but I could say the same for a lot of light novel trash</br>   Still no Kizu <br>FFFFFFFUUUUUUCK YOU SHAFT</br>  <br>Bakemonogatari aired 6 years ago<br>How much longer until the series is over? It's kind of sad to think we're near the end.</br></br>  <br>Kazui Hiroko is the one who storyboarded that. She may be implying something there too.</br>  <br>No Kizu until 2020.</br>  <br>I'm glad it's still going actually<br><br>SHAFT could've stopped after Bake but I think they love it too much. Also money.</br></br></br>    <br> I'm glad it's still going actually <br><br>Same, it's nice to have a story that might actually get completely adapted. The endless 1-2 season adaptations and then learn to read Japanese or never see the rest of the story do get annoying.</br></br></br>  <br> The endless 1-2 season adaptations and then learn to read Japanese or never see the rest of the story do get annoying. </br>  <br>Isnt the time to start laughing 379 days away still?</br>  <br>I'll give you an idea, Ian Flemming's James Bond novels spanned from around 1952 to his death in 1964 being written , it took the films from 1962 to 2006 to catch up.</br>    <br>Awesome, I'm a little disappointed if they don't adapt Koyomimonogatari but that's currently being translated so hopefully it won't be an issue.<br><br> The novels are ongoing <br>no they aren't</br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, tsuki was ok</br>  <br>Based shaft</br>    Who is ready to see Kiss Shot again?  <br>Nice. <br>We're talking about how much episode for this arc?</br></br>  <br>Confirmed.</br>   Numachi <br> Tadatsuru <br> Sodachi <br><br>Why would NisiO think it's a good idea to introduce characters at the end of a series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll say 4-5 per arc: Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, Sodachi Lost</br>  <br>I was thinking about it and it makes more sense to animate Koyomi between Owari vol. 2 and Owari vol. 3.</br>  <br>5-6 would be ideal. Compare how compressed Mayoi Jiangshi was to Neko White or Hitagi End.</br>  <br>But it had the most stylish OP.</br>  <br>what about koyomimonogatari</br>  <br>Hope they'll made at least a one court serie.</br>  <br>Tsukimonogatari was one of the best arcs for a long time.</br>  Kizu official release just got moved forward to December 8th  I just hope they get the tsubasa Cat animators  <br><br>Speaking of the whole Monogatari series, is there a chart of some sort which gives those who start watching/reading a guide?</br></br>  So it will be fall 2015 + winter 2016 probably  <br>Whatever you say, /a/non.</br>  <br>Release order.

It also explains why Episode showed up because Gaen wanted a vampire hunter. </br>  <br>For a thread about Owari, there aren't very many pics of best  ____ </br>  <br>okay I'll give you the real answer. he was running away from the dark void with Mayo and shinobu, and then mayoi passed on</br>  <br>That makes sense I guess.<br><br>What novel is this?</br></br></br>  <br>Am I missing something, I don't see shit about Owari on that website.</br>  <br>This thread is a trainwreck because of the namefag shitposter. I'll make another one later.</br>  <br>maybe it was removed after they people found it</br>  <br>He removed it. They are probably waiting for the new BD boxes to come out before making the official announcement.</br>  <br>Shinobu Mail, Owarimonogatari<br><br>Remember when Gaen says she also wants something in return for helping with Snail? She's talking about fighting Shinobu's old servant.</br></br></br>  Are we gonna get a full season or is this just another 4-5 episode thing?  <br>at least that's only next month. I'd appreciate a PV too</br>  <br><br>Another source: http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>75</wbr></br></br>  Why doesn't /a/ like Franco-Prussian war: the animation?  <br>Ice girl and the ponytail girl were the only saving graces of it.</br>   Army lead by hot bitches  <br> Not one soldier wanted to fuck them </br>  <br>Fuck the Ems dispatch.<br>Napoleon III is worst girl.</br></br>  <br>  1870 <br>  muskets <br>uwot?</br></br></br>  <br>What makes you think no-one wanted to fuck them?</br>  Subs when ?  <br>Izana was only suspicious as Nagate when Tsumugi was first introduced only to be confirmed to her after she got promoted.</br>  <br><br>I think  Kunato wanting to put his brain in a Guana  and  taking home another Hoshijiro  is more than enough to say they want a 3rd season. To me, it seemed like they finished the episode with 5 minutes left and just put that stuff in so it wasn't a hard cliffhanger.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, they've left it open enough so another season doesn't seem tacked on, but at the same time they also closed it off quite a bit.<br><br>I mean with all the flashbacks showing what Sidonia went through, the resolve to keep on fighting, a sortie against a Gauna yet again, it all makes it feel like the anime was a snapshot from Sidonia's story, with a somewhat closed ending saying that the fight goes on, simply because that's what it's like for them. It's closed in the sense that it kind of all loops back to the beginning, one battle is over and a new one begins, Sidonia won a major victory but the war keeps moving on. It made the anime feel like all it was supposed to be was a snapshot in Sidonia's/humanity's ongoing struggle. Of course there's ample room and source material for more anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure what you meant but she was the first one to point out that she sounded exactly like Hoshijiro and wondered if Nagate had noticed it as well. We got confirmation about him at least being aware of it when he had that dream about Hoshijiro.</br>  <br>  I'm not interested in the romantic side of Tanikaze and Izana. <br><br>You're in luck! The real romance is saved for the penis.</br></br></br>  Is creayus the most dedicated and loyal artist?  <br>Why doesn't she draw stuff with C.C. and a cute 2D version of herself?<br><br> That's what I would do. </br></br></br>  <br>She's just that dedicated to the ship.</br>      <br>Must be nice being able to draw your waifu doin all kinds of cute stuff. Maybe one day I'll start doing it for my waifu since she really needs more fanart. Though I suppose drawing on pc with those tablets is kinda expensive.</br>  Where do Giftias go when they die?  <br>yeah I'm not saying that they didn't serve their purpose as they also developed Michiru, Kazuki and Isla as characters, but they could've been executed a lot better</br>  <br>No they were still unnecessary. They still had Michiru's father for that point. <br>Those episodes were bad, unfitting and had plotholes.</br></br>  Overall I thought the series was okay but Kekkai, Pleiades, and Etotama blow it out of the water for AoTS. Honestly I thought it was only a little better then Dungeon.  <br> You're next </br>  <br>Well, the premise already had plotholes.</br></blockquote>]
