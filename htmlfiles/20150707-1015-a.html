[ Beware the breast beast.    Reminder that Akarin is the best and Chinatsu is the devil.    <br>  <br>I don't have a problem with semi-naked Yurus, hell we've seen worse in the OVA now. Sakubutt and thighs are a miracle no matter what.<br><br>I just can't masturbate to them. Tried a few times. Made me feel really somber both times. I can't see these characters as fap fuel, I'm far too attached. They're like my little gays daughters/friends, and not the slutty kinds you see in doujins.<br><br>  <br> It's so cute how you still have vaguely normal moral standards, anon. I sometimes forget that normal people think this kind of stuff is bad because I've been so desensitized by the internet. <br>I've been here going on 8 years and that has yet to change. But worst of all some sometimes my actual friends will say lewd things about girls and it will make me feel really uncomfortable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> claims she's best girl <br> tries to deny her love <br><br>Which is it kiddo</br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder that all girls are best  I want to hug Yui!  <br>Whoa there, I didn't say I wanted to deny the best girl love.<br><br>If she wants to love Satan herself, it's her choice. <br><br>I'm just stating the facts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But what if Yui doesn't want to hug you?</br>  loli episode animated by TYO when  <br>Then I'll just have to befriend her until I can hug her</br>  <br> S3  <br>It's so close, yet so far</br></br>  <br>I'll do my best to compensate for your abstinence.</br>  <br> tfw you will never be hugged by Yui </br>    <br>Ever thought that Satan might not have turned out so bad if he'd had somebody to love and be loved by?</br>  spot the difference  <br>A good Satan is still Satan.</br>  <br>Satan just needs the love of a good girl.</br>  <br>I want to hug her too!</br>  <br>No, but maybe the whole rebellion could have been avoided if he'd just been killed at the first sign of trouble...</br>  <br>literally no difference</br>  <br>I can help too.<br><br>I just want to  kiss her belly and pinch her cheeks. </br></br></br>  <br>Huh, interesting. Over the years I've fapped to all kinds of fucked up shit here, but never to yurus: they're just too pure.</br>  <br>Chinatsu won an art fair.</br>  <br>T-that's sexual harassment not hugging!</br>  <br> having moral standards </br>      <br>Good Satan &gt; Everything</br>  <br>I always feel like there's a mild distinction to fapping to the characters and fapping to the characters doing lewd things to each other. I can't get into the former at all, but the latter works for me sometimes.</br>  Cute things are my fetish.<br><br><br>I can get more invested in something if I care about the characters. Especially if it's a doujin of any kind, if it's from something I don't know I just won't be able to enjoy it on as many levels and I'd rather skip it altogether. That includes non-h.</br></br></br>  Normal Akari&gt;&gt;&gt;Loli Akari  <br>pls namori more of these two</br>  <br>ayano's crying because she's imagining kyouko ;_;</br>  <br>Who is this tomato wacko?</br>  <br> Chinatsu is the devil <br><br>I wish this meme would stop. There is nothing wrong with Chinatsu.</br></br></br>  <br> implying yui isn't 10 times better than kyouko </br>  <br>She's crying because Yui's too aggressive.</br>  <br>It's just a joke, nobody legitimately hates any of the Yurus  except that guy who hates Chizuru who posts sometimes </br>  <br>I can't agree with that anon, I think there's something very clearly wrong with Chinatsu, and that's exactly why I find her so cute and interesting.<br><br>I don't think she's evil, but I would certainly say she's more "morally flexible" than the others.</br></br></br>  <br>I think to be morally flexible she'd have to have morals.</br>  <br>She does, she cares about Akari a lot and rejected the chance to kiss Yui.<br><br>Everyone except Akari is a moral black hole anyway after they all left her to die at the hands of ghost-Rise.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never be a dyke spending quality time with your dyke gf during PE <br>why live ;_;</br></br>  <br>My sides!</br>  <br>I wouldn't consider her affection for Akari to be an indication of morality, but her deciding not to kiss Yui does show some character growth in that direction.<br><br> left her to die at the hands of ghost-Rise <br>I don't remember that part</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not if she secretly likes it!</br>  <br>Chizuru is the worst thing since Stalin.</br>  <br><br>If only Lucifer had had a biscuit hammer...</br></br>  <br><br>Huh, rare to see Hitler get BTFO like that (after 1945, obviously)</br></br>  <br> I wouldn't consider her affection for Akari to be an indication of morality <br><br>Akari's a morality pet. I don't think Chinatsu's amoral or immoral anyway, she just has a really weird and incomprehensible moral code that she's slowly learning to abandon in favour of a more normal one.<br><br> I don't remember that part <br><br>I can't remember the episode but it's when the Amusement Club first meet Rise, they enter the room after talking about ghosts and think she's an evil spirit. Everyone clears the fuck out and Akari trips over, leading to everyone else scrambling the fuck out and leaving her to die. Kyouko cruelly and hilariously shrugs it off later after Yui suggests they should have probably tried to help her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just found out that we aren't even getting Yuru Yuri S3 until fucking October. Will you guys be able to keep up the hype with these daily "YrYr S3" threads until then?  <br>PERFECT</br>  <br> morality pet <br><br>I don't know what this means.<br><br> cruelly and hilariously <br>They're my least favourite jokes in the show - I usually don't find them funny at all - so that may be why I don't remember it. I think I've actually forgotten a lot of the show. Is that in the manga as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, thus far we've been able to keep them going by constantly posting the same repetitive meaningless crap over and over again. I'm sure we'll be able to keep it up until October!</br>  <br>It sounds like the same formula for every other successful thread on /a/!</br>  <br>we'll still get the two OVA's right?</br>  <br>Welcome to shitposting general, it's worked for us so far.</br>  does anyone have the pic where  yui stabbed kyoukos eyes and shes crying on her shoulder? <br>i need it for reasons</br>  <br>Hey, we get the occasional manga chapter too.</br>  <br>One more month...we just have to hold out for one more month...</br>    <br> I don't know what this means. <br><br>I've seen it used in discussions a lot, but looking it up on Google just now, it seems to be from TVTropes. Whoops. <br><br>Anyway, it refers to a character who is pure/nice/moral/good (Akari) who can be paired with a character who is antisocial/amoral/abrasive (Chinatsu) in order to soften them up and give them positive character development.<br><br> Is that in the manga as well? <br><br>I don't think that bit got translated, so no idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  chapter 8 when  <br>Next week</br>    <br>We're getting an OVA in August, and you yourself saw how much fuel was added to the hype train with the last one alone. There's no stopping it, anon.</br>  <br>nadeshiko a best</br>    <br>of course i have it, anon-chan.</br>  <br>Never. We need to track down whoever made this and force him to finish it.</br>  <br>How did she lose her eyes?</br>  <br>He probably got into a fatal accident or something.</br>  <br>Ah. I don't know if I really agree with the idea of Akari being Chinatsu's 'morality pet'. She has scenes with plenty of different characters that show her softening up and displaying positive character growth, it's just the over time Akari has become her best and closest friend. I think Chinatsu's pretty amoral as well for the most part. Whatever semblance of a cobbled together moral code she has depends hugely on whether or not it's going to benefit her, until the Yui kiss really. She does care about Akari, but even that's selfish. She does nice things for her because she likes Akari and it feels nice to do nice things for someone you like, but she never really does anything for her at her own personal expense. Though the dream chapter is taking things in an interesting direction.</br>  <br> only 1 month left </br>  <br>Goyac's too busy making Non Non Biyori incest doujins right now. I am hoping the OVAs and S3 will spur him into making more YuruYuri stuff.</br>  <br>Considering the other pictures that went with it from pixiv Yui probably got jealous of Kyouko being close to Ayano and dug her eyes out so that she wouldn't look at other people anymore.</br>  <br>He will probably get into a fatal accident before that happens.</br>  <br>He's a traitor!</br>  <br>That sounds like something Yui would definitely do.</br>  <br>Are you aiming to become pessimist-chan?<br><br><br>I just wish someone would translate them at least. NNB Goyac is better than no Goyac.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I just know that nothing good can get an ending.</br>  <br>The Japanese seem to be uniformly terrible at endings anyway.</br>    <br>A bigger tragedy than a fatal accident.</br>    <br>Apparently this is why Yui cut out Kyouko's eyes.</br>  <br>all i ever want is yui and ayano getting rid of the awkwardness towards eachother</br>  <br>it's over</br>  <br>thank you!</br>  <br>where is her arms</br>  <br>Ask Yui</br>  <br>She is reenacting the school days ending.</br>  <br>don't be silly, ayano and yui clearly likes eachother but can't overcome the shyness and awkwardness to become closer friends<br>it's like they have too much respect for eachothers</br></br>    Is Yui shy, lazy or just reserved? I can't figure out if she doesn't really interact with most the other Yurus because she doesn't want to or because she struggles with Yuru interaction.  <br>I was referencing these, anon. It's called a joke.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>    <br>she just don't like to talk too much, that's all</br>    <br>yui isn't that much taller than ayano<br>she's like 10 cm taller i think<br>i saved the yuru heights picture that showed the official heights but i can't find it on my PC anymore, fuck</br></br></br>  <br> 10 cm <br>She's 1 cm taller than Ayano according to the fanbook. They and Himawari are the tallest, I believe.</br></br>  daily reminder that nadeshiko a best  <br>if you have the time<br>can you share the heights, that would be really nice, i can't find the image anymore</br></br>  Would you Sakurako a Himawari?  <br>maybe if i have the time to spare.</br>   5AM currently <br>oh well good night</br>  <br>If you mean this one, it was the OP image of the last thread.  How hard did you look? </br>  <br>i made the last thread<br>i have this, but i am pretty sure i had another one that had individual heights</br></br>  <br>later anon</br>  awoooo  <br>My mistake. This is the only other height chart I have, if it helps, but no Ayano, sadly.</br>  No ehehe-ing or awoo-ing below this line<br>___________________________________<wbr>_______</wbr></br>  <br>What about wan-ing and nyan-ing?</br>  <br>Ahh that is fine<br>Thanks anyways, but I could have sworn a height chart was posted some threads back, I'll look through the archives for a bit</br></br>      <br>Like every other yuru?</br>  <br>Like EVERY other yuru</br>  Fuck I hate y/u/rifags so much.  <br>i love you anon!</br>  <br>We love you too, shitposter-kun</br>  Which Chinatsu is this?    <br><br>You didn't say anything about "eheheh"ing!</br></br>  <br><br> page 10 after an "eheheh" </br></br>        <br>Do you have one of just Kyouko with the sakurafish?

She'll only live to be gang-raped and having sex with multiple partners because you won't be able to make use of all of her assets. \<br><br>3) Your pathetic dick will never see the sunlight, and with that only be submerged in darkness.

Of course when applying it to artwork such as hentai or doujinshi, most artists feel compelled to give their characters this trait. Even some of the most talented artists have succumbed to this trend and create their beautiful girls with such a disgusting trait. Had they created stories of purity and righteousness, I believe people who read their works will also convert to better human beings. I too, have fallen sometimes to read these disgraceful acts. It is not because I enjoy the premise, no, it is because I enjoy seeing their creative artwork. But it's a shame, a real shame that great artists love to defile their beautiful characters for no apparent reason.</br></br>    <br>superior</br>    <br>Who in their right mind would racemix?</br>  Never too big  Shizune is perfect.  <br><br> /pol/ pls </br></br>  <br> Who in their right mind would racemix? <br> not race mixing with an elf </br></br>  With great boobs comes great areolae.  <br>The mom was my ideal size. Fuck that hentai was great.</br>  <br>Shame there will never be a V2 and no penetration.</br>  <br><br>I'd trade like 3 months worth of hentai releases for another episode of that. Maybe even four, given most of what's been coming out lately: shitty 15 minute episodes.</br></br>  <br>You could've prevented 15m episodes if you actually bought hentai.</br>  <br>literally never</br>  <br>so you watched the spiritual successor right? I mean it has  penetration  and everything</br>  <br><br>It was good, but not as good.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127641400 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127641697 <br>boku no pico</br></br>  <br>Thats the one with the girls with big tits?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Yes.

Seems a bit weird.</br>  <br>It varies</br>  <br> Basically the ability to take breasts and give them to yourself/give them to others via Breast Flow is tied to a certain bloodline. Chifusa's mother was basically kidnapped and impregnated by the patriarch of the Manyuu clan to get that blood in the family.

The body is like a finely made clock. The hands can be small works of art, but they're nothing without the face which compliments them, and the face feels bare without its frame. <br><br>Lets say you like tomboys and hate sticky sluts. A sticky slut will look like shit to you regardless of how well they're drawn or their breast size, however a tomboy will appeal even if it's poorly drawn - although there's a limit with most people to how badly drawn this can be. However, while you could love the tomboy and their breasts the artist could have a weird nipple fetish too and insert that and it clashes with your preference and ruins it, or maybe their hips are too small so it makes the tits look weird in proportion to the rest of the body. <br><br>The human body is a work of art and has its contrasts and compliments just like drawing, painting, or writing. Focusing on only just one part of it without taking into consideration of the rest is like appreciating only the pigment of a landscape by itself with nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone have source for this?

So it would mean that Rukia is the heroine and Orihime is the love interest. I say that because there's nothing overtly romantic between them unlike Orhime who seems to be designed for the soul purpose of shipping fodder.</br></br></br>  <br> Komamura grows a phantom cock and then summons a giant walking cock <br> Sasakibe gets a dildo that vibrates and zaps you <br> Unohana's vagina melts your dick </br></br></br>  With hefty amounts of ass waxing.  implying it will end  <br>I would be so done.</br>  <br><br>Incoherently and with a stupid chapter title.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I came.</br></br></br>  <br> Kurosutchi drugs you and rapes you  <br> Hitsugaya freezes your dick </br></br>  It was all a computer simulation  <br> chapter title "All's well that ends well" <br> [last chapter ichigo cut off yhwach's head with the help of Aizen, Eyepatch-Senpai and Ginjo/Facebook] <br> Chapter starts with a whole page showing us the sun coming out in KT with a rainbow/Editor's note: Colored Peace awaits!! <br> Orihime sets out to buy a food and a bottle of strawberry juice from the neighbourhood store <br> she smiles sadly whilegoing up the streets and Chad joins her without saying a word <br> they arrive at a huge building and Tatsuki waits roght there with ichigo's high school friends <br> [There is still not even one spech bubble] <br> They go into the building and stand in a room around a bed afterwards <br>   ichigo  lays in it with his hair's looking like they did after he defeated  Aizen in FKT <br> Isshin stands at the wall and everyone looks at him with bright eyes <br> suddenly we shots of karin and yuzu crying at home <br> HM was destroyed by SS, so everyone in SS including prisoners like Grimmjow an Sharktits are shown <br> Everyone seems pretty sad <br> rukia cries <br> page before last page <br> it's a double spread <br> top right panel: Isshin opens his mouth <br> top left panel: "He..." <br> huge panel uder those: "We tried everything.

IchiHime sounds like the typical ending. However, I wouldn't like that ending as it doesn't have much basis in the story. Ichigo doesn't seem to notice Orihime at all. On top of that, Kubo likes to be edgy and kill off those who experience love in Bleach. Or any kind of happiness, really. A happy ending for Ichigo would seem, well, out of character for the manga. On top of that, it seems that Orihime's love for Ichigo has been demoted to comedic relief status as of late...<br><br>Rukia would be a better match, for at least it would make sense to me. Of course, we all have our biases...<br><br><br> BLEACHED WORLD <br>Since white is the color of death in the east (right?) wouldn't a Bleached world mean that everyone is dead and lives forever as a soul in one world?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or, that everyone is just dead, with no-one to live and suffer the fears of mortal souls? After all, if nobody was alive, there would be no suffering, when life no doubt contains suffering of some kind for everyone without guaranteed happiness or purpose.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antin<wbr>atalism</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The Gotei 13 and friends have a straightforward battle with the remaining Vandenreich, and Ichigo defeats Bach and uses his body as the replacement Soul King. Everything goes back to normal. No plot twists.<br>A while later, Kubo starts another manga. A few characters have resemblances to Bleach characters, but everyone just attributes it to Kubo sameface, including an Aizen lookalike.<br>Several years into the new manga, when the Aizen lookalike is losing a fight, he says "since when were you under the impression that this world was even real?"<br>The world shatters away to reveal fake Karakura town. Aizen asks "Did you enjoy my Bankai?" and pulls a new army out of his ass. Several years later, Ichigo manages to defeat Aizen in the Royal Realm after a long, slowly paced battle between Soul Society and Aizen's new faction. Right before Aizen is about to lose, he announces "The best part of my Bankai is... It can be used recursively"<br>The world shatters away again and Zombie Powder continues from where it left off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Two thrusts into Soi Fon's vagina and you cum instantly <br> Ikkaku's becomes massive but flaccid and you have to wake it up </br></br>  <br> Ikakku is gay so he only pulls out his dick if you promise not to tell anybody  <br> same with Yumichika, and he sucks all your reishi out through your dick </br></br>  It will end by someone describing his super seiyan level 2 bankai to someone else.  <br>Kubo sure is having fun</br>  <br> Ichibei makes you scream his name and crushes your throat for that <br> Kira makes your body feel heavier after everu thrust <br> Hinamori's vagina feels like fireworks going out on your dick </br></br></br>  <br>Probably with the heroes winning like always with minimal losses and another goodbye between Rukia and Ichigo.

But it's the most logical conclusion. I just haven't seen the purpose of Ishida yet though.</br>  <br>Ichigo's power should be different, though.

And if Isshin's brother is like him at all - it could be a sister too, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  I haven't paid attention to bleach since they went to rescue rukia from somewhere. or orhime. whoever they resuced second. Is there anywhere I can read a short summary without reading 15 years or mangos?  <br>This isn't one piece, you don't wan't too miss a thing. But I can sum it up for you if you wan't it.</br>  <br>It wouldn't take you that long to read all of it, the pacing is kinda shit. You would miss a lot of stuff too, a summary isn't nearly enough. You'd be left with the feeling that it's full of plotholes and asspulls as the story progresses.<br><br>Although, even people who HAVE read all of it complain about asspulls and plotholes...<br><br>It's just 2deep4u, okay?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess I'll just read mangas. Or watch the animu if I can figure out what filler to skip. I tend to prefer anime. I'm interested in seeing how Bleach ends since I used to really enjoy it, I read the newest 10 or so chapters and have NO FUCKING IDEA what is going on.</br></br>  <br>I don't really care for that. What interests me is the lore, the background details about how the Bleach world came to be as it is today.<br><br>Surely, by now, there have to be some plausible theories about the origins of Bleach world, right? How the Soul King, Yhwach, quincy, shinigami and hollows are tied together? Why is Hueco Mundo so clearly a result of Yamamoto using his bankai? How the world looked like originally?<br><br>I'd read about the less plausible ones on Lab Member's site but it's not working properly, so /a/nons, give me your best shots.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Anime has a lot of stuff that plain didn't happen, even if you skip filler, and it sometimes censors stuff. Like manji. It also takes a lot more time.<br><br>I would advise you to download the OST and listen to it while reading. It might take some time to figure out which track fits the best for any chapter, but it does pay out.<br><br> mfw I started Ichigo's theme at the beginning of the chapter when he returned from RR and it synchronized perfectly with his landing as I read the pages <br>better than sex</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So many shit going on in this Manga. I might as well make a list.<br><br><br>Dual wielders. There are only 3 known. 1 of them is a quincy, and so are the others in my oppinion. Can't see other reason why ukitake would be so councerned about Shunsui using his Bankai in the open.</br></br></br>  <br>That does sound pretty cool. I think I may give it a shot.</br>  <br> Why is Hueco Mundo so clearly a result of Yamamoto using his bankai? <br>I think you're pretty well versed on the theories already.<br><br>How the world originally was though? If the Gotei is to be trusted, without and before Soul King, the worlds would've been in total chaos and merged as a single world. This doesn't sit well with world history though, as it goes far further than the time Soul King was created. Of course it's possible that the worlds live in different planes of time, so a thousand years of Soul King in Soul Society could mean ten thousand years of Human World. Of course, this would mean that every year spent in Soul Society would be ten in the Human world, which just isn't plausible given the happenings of the manga. HOWEVER, it is possible that the time spent was synchronized at some point before any events depicted in the manga occurred.<br><br>There's also that thing about Shinji listening to Jazz 60 years before it was made in the human world...<br><br><br>It's a good OST as-is. Shiro Sagisu is based.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The tankobon sales are still great so it's not going anywhere any time soon. <br>-Shaman king Author before getting cancelled</br></br>  <br> only a six year run and 64 episodes </br>  <br> I think you're pretty well versed on the theories already. <br><br>Well, I've been trying to figure the origins of the Bleach world for a while now but so far, I've been unable to unify all the information into one coherent theory. We lack too much data and without them , it seems close to impossible to figure out what Kubo is thinking. <br><br> There's also that thing about Shinji listening to Jazz 60 years before it was made in the human world.. <br><br>I always thought that was because of the Cleaner. That somebody managed to smuggle a CD of jazz from the Real world into Soul Society but ran into cleaner on his way, sending the CD in the Soul Society 60 years before it came out...

This series is fucked. It was fun while it lasted.

Yen press shutting him down is just an excuse. Saofags do the translations because they genuinely love the series irregardless of waifus.</br>  <br>So...<br>In case Spyro drops it, do we have any alternatives?<br>Maybe a group of anons could take it up and share the PDFs here?<br><br>We should see if there are any people that would be interested in that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just pray for the irohafags to translate some stuff</br></br>  <br> Because spyro is a waifufag and is rapidly losing motivation out of butthurt <br>And there's this faggot.</br></br>  <br>Best bet is for an Irohabro to step up since they seem to be the most competent fanbase. Don't think Yukinoshits or Yuifags are any good at moon or OC.</br>  <br> group of anons <br>unlikely<br><br>but the weeaboo world is large, and I'm confident that surely someone will pick up the translation. Don't expect too much about the quality, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just a theory though.</br>  <br> he can always post his translation in his site. <br>No he can't, he'll get DMCA's and C&amp;D's all day long.<br><br>He is best off translating offline and just posting a PDF link here when he's done the chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter why he drops it if he does, we should prepare.</br>  <br>Considering the lame lines he posted about losing motivation after the latest chapters, it's the most likely explanation. <br><br>Otherwise if he's just burned out, he'll come back someday.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't /a/ have their own ftp?

One Peace Books is releasing a new ShieldBro volume every month starting in October. <br><br>No idea why YP is allowed to get away with their pacing.</br></br></br></br>   40 minutes <br> 6 posts <br> no Spyro translations in sight </br></br>  8man the siscon in paradise  <br><br>Or hell</br></br>  <br>He doesn't look happy at all.</br>  <br>They both abuse him verbally, calling him useless siscon and gomii-chan, while stepping on him on a daily basis</br>  <br>I so want his siscon adventures and Komachi to finally meet Iroha. Fucking Wata should release more volumes.</br>  Stay hydrated, brothers  <br>And nobody translates those volumes</br>  <br>Iroha don't abuse verbally.</br>  <br><br> komachi meets iroha <br> calls 8man gomiichan <br> iroha has similar reaction to yukino when she heard komachi shittalk him and starts using gomiichan <br><br>sasuga watari</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Gomii-chan-senpai~" <br> "Don't call me that please" </br></br>  <br><br>Nah, just 'Senpai' is already his nickname for Iroha</br></br>  <br>You can expect me to translate it if it's anything Iroha related (expecting poor quality though)</br>  Spyro is going to join YP.  <br>i never understood why they never bother hiring people that did fan translation for dirt cheap and do quick edit job and release. they do a piss poor job and take forever translating on their own.</br>  <br>Fan translators want to leave in horrifics, Yen Press doesn't want to. Conflict~</br>  <br> horrifics <br>isn't it honorifics, or is this a meme I missed?</br></br>  <br>Why not? The people who read weeaboo shit don't want it localized to sound like some American shit.</br>  <br>It's a meme you missed. Much like "You're waifu is shit".</br>  <br>but they did, often so (at least in manga section). But the translator can't help but have to obey the publisher policy.</br>  <br> horrifics </br>  <br>Now this is a meme I like</br>  <br><br>It's horrific that they don't use honorifics.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Professional translators tend to do language localisation. You just need to read a book in your language and then the same parragraf in the original language and you will see how different they are</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like with pottery it rhymes.</br>  <br>I like honourifics because its not something that is easily translated and is an instant indicator of relationships between two people. We dont have defined social standings to the extend of senpai/kohai. Calling someone -sama, -san, -kun, -chan, etc all show extremely different relationships. <br> <br>Like in this series, youd see Iroha only calls 8man senpai whereas if you leave all honourifics out, shed have a nickname for him as senpai (or bob or however retarded they bother to translate it). Just one small instance off top of my head.</br></br></br>  <br>They are trying to make it accessible for others who aren't into Japanese media. I imagine loads would take of to YenPress social media going "wtf is this "kun" and shit.<br>Though this would be easily solvable by including a glossary in their releases.</br></br>  yahari is dead what hte fukc  <br>This is the problem, they'll change all of that to Mr/Mister/Miss/Mrs or just to the person in question name. <br>As you said you'll never accurately know the relationship between 2 characters or the subtle change when they use a more friendly honorific or drop it all together.</br></br>  Yahari threads definitely won't die for a while. Even if we somehow managed to hit page 10, somebody will bump it for the heck of it.  <br>This kills the Irohafag.</br>  <br>I've saved the thread multiple times that way<br>The only way Yahari will die is if the mods kill it</br></br>  <br>Spamming Yahari threads would only encourage mods to purge them.</br>  Don't worry, I can not translate like Spyro does word for word, but I can give summaries.  <br> save <br><br>no you just trap us here, again again agin and again....<br><br>I hope you burn in hell  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And when they do I will finally be released</br>  Iroha confirmed?<br><br>What's this yen press stuff, did they pick up the novels?</br></br>  anybody have pdfs for the volumes in case he takes it down? i'm too lazy to copy and paste from his site.  fuck those YP scumbags. How the hell i can buy the fucking translations of theirs if I'm not Western and I dont have money? and we have to wait for years for those shitheads. DAMN ITTTTTTTTT  <br>Yes, and Spyro is probably ending his translation which means we'll get shitty translations in 3-5 years.<br><br>check the last thread some anon posted a mega link</br></br></br>  Someone should make a torrent and upload it to nyaa  <br> Spyro is probably ending his translation <br><br>Why would he? All he has to do is translate shit and make torrents for each chapter or just the whole volume.</br></br></br>  <br>Here<br/></br>  <br>Don't worry, some anon will scan the YP translations for you. That's how things work since ages ago.</br>  epub<br>https://www.mediafire.com/?89du4zd7<wbr>n3hny</wbr></br>  I thought we officially moved over to /djt/  <br>This. Can we just get a torrent?</br>  <br>It's a bluff.</br>  <br>DDL is faster.</br>  <br>DDL can also get removed</br>  <br>Well, I understand the loss of motivation to some extent, but it's not that huge of a deal. I mean, the people that matter and read the current fan translation are not going to wait 7 years for the official TL of the last 2 volumes when there's a fan TL of them available already.<br><br>You TL for the faggots on 4chan and some other sites, not for the normalfags who may buy the novels and read them first time like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.<br>Is this the latest version with the fixed translation from kyakka?</br></br>  Someone please post the link for downloading volume 11 raw.<br>Please spoonfeed me!<br> My picture says otherwise! <br><br> Does 4chan captcha system has a problem? It isn't giving me captcha to solve. When I click the box, it just gets checked. </br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>You need motivation in order to translate for free though. What's the point of wasting your time translating a book you already read and taking the risk of getting DMCA's and C&amp;D's? <br><br>And by doing it off-line, you would spend 1-2 months of your time translating stuff just for some anons saying thanks, while others criticize your efforts by saying your TL sucks or it's biased</br></br></br>  <br>Implying Nyaa hasn't removed stuff before.</br>  <br>We've became jojofags.<br><br>Same mindless discussions, which x would you let buttfuck you, etc</br></br></br>  So do you want to continue reading fan TL or not?  <br>Aren't most of us heterosexual males though?</br>  <br>So do you want to continue reading fan TL or not?</br>  <br>Sounds familiar.</br>  I can't find 10.5 PDF in the MEGA link, anyone had it?  <br>i dont even understand how you localize shit..... like if they said it red and three times faster would they say live long and prosper or some shit?</br>  <br>Take the torrent and put it in pirate bay and kat.cr as well then.</br>  <br>Except we can "hear" when characters speak. Also, at least memesubs left "Hikky", "Yukinon" and even chose more literal approach for "suki... nano". I doubt YP will do the same.</br>  <br> even chose more literal approach for "suki... nano" <br>Watched raws, how did they handle it?</br></br>  SPYRO!<br><br>YOU CAN ALWAYS POST PDFs AND RENAME THEM AS SOMETHING.jpg AND POST IT ON YOUR BLOG UNDER SOME CONCEALED SPECIAL TITLE!<br><br>WE CAN CONVERT IT BACK TO PDF.<br><br>YEN PRESS CAN'T STOP YOU FROM POSTING IMAGES, CAN IT?<br><br>SO PLEASE!

I never find HS truly problematic for anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>we're all tsun for commie but yp is legit garbage</br>  <br> there are people on the /a/ that don't know about programing. </br>  I just hope Yukino won't win. She's the worst character, a lying selfish bitch and a drama queen to boot, I don't get why 8man cares so much about her when there are better girls around him already.  <br>Oh, and ungrateful as fuck, also.</br>  <br>no I'm pretty sure I know more about programming than you, but your line was confusing to me<br> compile into python <br>what do you mean?

Does that mean we'll get three integral ending?

I read some where that 4chan was originally written in PHP by Shii or some sort. Did they change it later?</br>  <br>She'll win just fine. Winning her mom and oneesan.</br>  <br><br>That's actually what you guys get from a post that ends with yen pressing inside?</br></br>  <br> his own "I'm falling in love" <br>No. There's nothing wrong with that translation.

If she cared about him before it would make sense that she doesn't care about him afterwards. <br>Because she obviously cares about him, he betrayed her expectations, she betrayed his, that alone wasn't enough for them to stop caring about one another.<br><br> It was solved, the love triangle got dissolved. <br>Genuine 2.0 just made their love for him stronger but made the love triangle less violent.<br><br> All the same, she didn't want him around. <br>She didn't want him to force himself to do something he didn't want.<br><br><br><br>Yep</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>go to /djt/ and go nowhere fast</br>  <br>That isn't a good enough reason to tell someone to fuck off, he would leave of his own free will if he wanted to. She even told him with a smile. If this was as you guys said she would look sadder.<br><br><br> the love triangle less violent <br>It was never violent to begin with. If there was still a love triangle and he gave them a go ahead on being genuine about it I would predict that there would be more hurt feelings in the short term. It would preserve long term relations though.<br><br> she obviously cares about him <br>Then she wouldn't have intentionally hurt his feelings like. He never hurt hers before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She even told him with a smile. <br>Fucking duh, she's autistic. news at 11.<br><br>Now, I wouldn't deny that she look like a bitch while doing that, but she had damn good reason to do so. And that's why it's so sad.<br><br>Her first rejection during genuine scene OTOH, I have no fucking idea. That was incredibly petty no matter how one would spin it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is she so flustered?</br>  Yen Press is our savior  <br><br>Do people seriously browse the threads? The only thing valuable there is the pastebin.</br></br>  <br><br>Yukino rejecting Hachiman at first during genuine was because she was upset about him claiming all the blame for what happened. She understood to herself that she was at fault as well, but Hachiman was acting like everything was his doing. It was like another social suicide for him from her PoV.<br><br>  After I finished, I looked at Yukinoshita. She squeezed the fists she had on the table even harder. <br>  “So you’re saying… you’re at fault?” <br>  “…Yeah, I can’t deny it.” <br>  Directly or indirectly, my actions were the cause of everything. That was an infallible truth. Upon answering her, she quietly lowered her eyes and bit her lips. <br>  “I see…” she said, her voice resembling a sigh and lifted her face. Her eyes that were slightly moist looked at me for an instant, but were quickly averted. After taking a moment to search for the words she wanted to say, she spoke with a cold tone. <br>  “…However, if you think the responsibility is yours and only yours alone, isn’t it something you ought to solve on your own?” <br><br>It's like Hachiman/Yukino interactions the entire series have to be viewed as these two loners struggling to reach out to each other on a level beyond words and failing. But they get closer every time they do it. They both assume things about each other and then judge them when they don't live up to that. They expect things from each other and act like they don't have to really talk to each other, but get disappointed anyway when it turns out that they do need to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  <br>It's confirmed for being 100% friendship.<br><br>She's just confused because she doesn't know better, and has never had a genuine relationship (heads up; friendships are relationships as well you fucktards) with anyone.</br></br></br>  <br> 100% friendship <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br> It's confirmed for being 100% friendship. <br>There you go<br><br> not trusting your anon-sempai </br></br></br></br>  <br>The day I trust you fuckers is the day I die. You guys are the biggest lot of distasteful human beings on the internet.</br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  <br>Only you, Ooka, and Yamato, Tobe.</br>  <br> She even told him with a smile. If this was as you guys said she would look sadder. <br>8man already knows her smiles at that time were fake.<br><br> Then she wouldn't have intentionally hurt his feelings like. He never hurt hers before. <br>She had to hurt him so he would stop doing retarded shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme reply to a meme post</br>  <br>What do you mean anon? Didn't you see the infirmary scene? That was the meaning of platonic friendship right there</br>  <br>yeah I didn't.  I thought it was a harem for sure. </br>  <br>If that was friendship then why was she eye raping Yui's Hikki? <br><br><br>Iroha (big maybe) and Saki like him so it is technically one but they are so far behind it is funny that some people consider them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That isn't a good enough reason to tell someone to fuck off, he would leave of his own free will if he wanted to. She even told him with a smile. If this was as you guys said she would look sadder. <br>You believe her smiles?</br></br>  <br> Yui's Hikki <br>Holy top kek, you surely mean Iroha's senpai, right?</br></br>  <br> Yui's Hikki  <br><br> implying she not allowed to rape her own man </br></br></br>  <br> you surely mean Iroha's senpai, right? <br>Not him but that's technically correct.</br></br>  <br>But more manga expressions makes her more intriguing. Also please, have you seen Megumi's LN illustrations? She is far from "flat" at all, the anime tonned her down to maximum level of flat.</br>  <br>She was confused. An autist long outcasted from society doesn't know how to deal with feeling of attachment towards opposite gender.<br><br>Her feeling for 8man and for Yui was basically the same. Yukino is basically about to commit the same mistake as 8man had in junior high.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui's Hikki doesn't belong to Yukinon. If he did anything to her it would be not be consensual.</br>  いろはす～  <br> thinking Yukino won't accept 8man  <br>You're just in denial, 8man writes sonnets about Yukino all the time it's basically love</br></br>  <br> loner thinks a 10/10 trope girl is 10/10 <br> means love <br>Does that make him in love with Iroha too? Because at this point he's writing eroticas for her.</br></br></br>  <br>And he was eye-fapping to Miura, Iroha and even Totsuka</br>  <br> Because at this point he's writing eroticas for her. <br>Based WW</br></br>  <br><br>Her manga expressions are too exaggerated. The anime got her emotional expressions just right. "Flat" doesn't really mean emotionless so much as being normal. That, and Megumi's voice is supposedly constantly flat in tone, but that's something impossible to tell in a text medium so not really relevant.</br></br>  <br>What a slut.</br>  <br> Flat <br><br>Gives a lot of misunderstanding. Subtle is better. And I think Shiraishi is a good example.</br></br></br>  <br>Typical delusionfag</br>    <br>run of the mill denialfag</br>  <br>I really love this one, it could be totally innocent or totally lewd.<br><br> I still sperg because 8man's desk is in the wrong place though. </br></br></br>  <br>Just reflect image if it triggers your autism that badly</br>  I wonder if Yukino ever realized how hot she is with these stockings  <br>Isn't he. But he always holding his urge or making bunch of excuses when it comes down to Yui.<br><br>I wonder why?</br></br></br>  <br>She probably did when guys started trying to ask her out</br>  <br>It all makes sense now.</br>    <br>Her bun will be on the wrong place though.</br>  <br>Highly arousing.</br>  <br>8man should hug Yui from behind and grope her Yahallos against her will.</br>  <br>So comfy.</br>  I wonder, since it bothered Yukino that guys only tried to get close to her because they wanted to date her why does it seem like she wouldn't mind dating 8man?  EEIIII<br><br> If you heard her, you lose </br></br>  <br>He loathe her at first sight<br> Sounds romantic actually </br></br>  <br>Because those guys weren't genuine.</br>  <br>I lost, hard.</br>  <br>Already been covered in official doujin</br>  <br> official doujin </br>  <br> against her will </br>  Was it ever confirmed that Iroha mouth raped 8man?  <br>8man is so fat in the last part.</br>  <br>She just felt like wearing her bun on the other side that day</br>   Okay, let's check how normalfags will ruin my day this ti- <br> Oregairu Light Novel and @comic Licensed by Yen Press <br>My Youth NEET Life is Shit as Expected.</br></br>  <br>I heard someone different, so I think that makes me the real winner.</br>  Is it true that Yenpress drops LNs they've licensed in the middle of translating when not enough people buy it? Is it plausible that when the Yahari novels don't get enough sales, they might just sweep it under the rug?<br><br>I'm pretty sure people who are not familiar with the words "senpai" or Japanese honorifics wouldn't even fucking bother buying the localized translations.</br></br>  <br>Me too Yuifriend<br><br>Me too<br><br>Yui is the best, no need to deal with the rest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not knowing the term "official doujin" </br>  <br>Cute, although she doesn't look sly enough.</br>  <br>Damn, it's impossible not to hear her.</br>  <br>Yahari is pretty popular so that won't happen</br>  <br> Youth </br>  <br>Well, aren't twenties still considered youth?</br>  The only thing I want from Yen Press now that its been announced that the volumes will be release more than one time a year and that they have good covers.  <br>but with the amount of time they would take releasing the translated novels, wouldn't people lose interest as time passes by?</br>  <br>I-I'm still in my 30's</br>  Can't even get mad at Yenpress for this shit.

He was dragged into the situations due to his strength and he has never trained of his own volition. It makes since and is completely his character to pursue his dream in peace time instead of being a power freak and constantly training like Goku and Vegeta.</br>  <br>shut up spic</br>  <br>truth be told chichi forced him (like your typical asian mom), instead of goku forcing training</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127680954 <br>FUCK MY LIFE UP</br>  That bitch chichi brainwashed Gohan with her study shit. If I had the potential to be a powerful saiyan, I'd train the everliving daylights out of myself.  Can anyone point me towards a decent sub, please? I know some are pretty terrible, and there are a lot out.  <br>wait for baaro's group (the-moonlighters), should be clockless too</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>You know what pisses me off? he's 17 years old and they put glasses and make him act like a 30 y/o</br>  <br>spoiler that shit you ass</br>  <br>Yes, that's how it works. It's always like that</br>  Toriyama hates Gohan, and Videl.  I liked how Piccolo was watching Gohan walking with Videl and was like 'look at that tosspot, choosing hoes before broes'  <br>Don't remind me ;_;</br>  <br>He went from the most evil villain to a tsundere stalker.</br>  <br>You had 20+ years to watch it. DBZ spoilers are allowed.<br><br><br>And he's getting married as well. I don't blame him though, Videl is the best dbz hottie and he even gets to impregnate that hot ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you will never have Piccolo as your guardian/stalker <br>Piccolo saving Gohan was my favorite trope in DBZ movies, too bad thats long gone</br></br>  <br>Him getting married makes sense, what doesn't make sense is that he uses glasses and acts like he's 30 when he's a 17 y/o kid</br>  <br>I used [AU] but it felt really amateurish. I'm sure some Anons got triggered when they translated Beerus as Bills.</br>  <br>When you gone through shit that makes you decide the fate of the world you grow up fast.</br>  He never wanted to be a fighter in the first place, just fuck off OP.  <br>Getting married at 17 makes sense?</br>  Chichi made Goku promise that once Cell was dealt with then Gohan could become a scholar like he wanted.  <br>Thanks mate.</br>  <br>If English isn't your mother tongue, I'd highly recommend for you to search for subtitles in your language. Dragonball is famous around normalfags.</br>  I watched the first episode, but am still debating on whether I should wait for dub or not. The rest are okay, but Goku sounds fucking horrible with his old granny voice.  <br><br>Confirmed for not knowing anything about Dragon Ball in general.</br></br>  <br>Because even Gohan realized that Goku is always going to save the day anyway so he's chilling with his waifu</br>  <br>Replace anime with learning japanese. Lurk DJT instead. Git gud. After a year or so, 1 year's worth of anime to watch, RAW. Maximum satisfaction.</br>  <br>False, faggot.<br><br>He stated that the ones he didn't like were Chi-Chi and Vegeta.</br></br></br>  <br>If the couple can defend themselves and they have all the money in the world they can. No one's stopping them. Gohan's fucking smart and already has ambitions of providing for his new family. If he can do all that at 17 he's a fucking catch. He should be thanking Chichi for raising him that way.</br>  Anyone else think Videl is clearly best girl? The first episode of chou showed that quite well.  <br>  literally fuck off <br>if gohan stayed on that course the series would have been ruined. There would have been no reason for goku to be resurrected and we likely would not have gotten majin vegeta or goten OR video or pan. People who obsess over ssj 2 gohan are the underbelly of the fanbase</br></br>  <br>Videl*</br>  <br> Make a call back to kid Goku <br>We don't need a call back to kid Goku, adult Goku should just be acting the same as he always has. <br>It would have been more interesting to see the Trunks/Gohan dynamic and maybe draw some parallels between the Gohan/Piccolo relationship. But nope, that only happened in one movie. <br><br>Seriously, NOSTALGIA is pretty much the only excuse for how shitty Dragonball has become<br> remember all of these useless side characters? Well we haven't made them any more useful BUT WE REMEMBERED TO SHOW THEM FOR LIKE 5 SECOND CAMEOS  except for Lunch lol <br><br> You're not supposed to take the power level bullshit seriously, it's just like the original Dragonball where Goku just stomps everyone  <br>Dragonball also used to have actual fighting choreography outside of punching/kicking flurries and beamspam. Toriyama has made decent looking fights in the manga but Toei kept adding padding in the form of what I mentioned above, and that padding seems to have stuck for the movies. Instead of being creative with fights, they are still just bigass beams and punching/kicking really fast/hard.<br><br><br> He never wanted to be a fighter in the first place <br>Why the fuck did Gohan take up a super hero mantle? Even as an adult in Battle of Gods he dressed up as the Great Saiyaman and wanted to show off how powerful he was (a completely out of character and stupid decision made for the sake of PLOT, by the way).<br>Gohan should still want to be able to fight for JUSTICE or whatever, there is no excuse for him slacking off so much that he loses his powers to such an extent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's ok but too domesticated now. I miss the tomboy.</br>  <br>Thread should have ended here.<br><br>Why are people too stupid to follow simply shonen like Dragon Ball?<br><br>Gohan NEVER wanted to be a fighter. He hated fighting from the beginning. <br><br>He only became so strong during Cell arc because Goku forced him train in the time chamber and he got desperately mad when he saw his friends and family beaten to death.<br><br>After Cell's death, there was no reason to train or fight anymore.<br><br>Also when you acquire a premium waifu like Videl, you settle down and enjoy life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Mystic form has some use in this.  <br> we likely would not have gotten majin vegeta or goten OR video or pan <br><br>sounds like an improvement already</br></br></br>   tfw no teen Trunks and Goten shenanigans <br> instead we get more kids being dumb </br>  <br><br> Actually the Opening is full of hope, there are moment when Gohan is very cool.</br></br>  <br>because toriyama likes making Trunks go through Le Quirky Bart Simpson Antics rather than give his character any growth even though it makes zero sense for Trunks to still be a child when BoG takes place.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>Gohan is really the only one in Dragonball who has actually showing decent character development, MAYBE Krillin too but everyone else doesn't really feel like they change at all.</br></br>  <br> he never noticed Trunks entering his growth spurt <br> episode 1 of Super </br></br>  Why is Gohan in his Ultimate Form in the intro to Dragonball Super, but claims to have forgotten it by the time Revival of F comes around?  <br><br>What about Vegeta?</br></br>  <br>But he's actually taller than Goten now.</br>  <br>Is Goten really wearing a shirt there with his own fucking name on it?</br>  <br>Yeah and you mirin'</br>  <br>Is that something new to you?</br>  <br>Aye.</br>  WHERE THE FUCK WAS SHE  Gohan is such a joke character. Not in a funny way like Satan but the dull and boring type.  <br>with Broly , in his real place :^)</br>  <br> and for some reason, there are fags who insist on calling her Buruma </br>  <br>Hey they used Mr. Satan's useless sidekicks from the Cell Saga in the first episode of Super.<br><br>Anything is possible!</br></br></br>  <br>Muzukashi hon is a classic of literature.</br>    <br> Muzukashi hon <br>this guy.</br></br>  <br>Worse still, some call her Blooma</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br> he hasn't read muzukashii hon <br>What an uncultured swine.</br></br>  are there animal people in Super? There werent any animal people in Z  Why does Goten sound like a toddler?  <br>Being rejected by Tenshinhan must have emotionally destroyed her beyond repair. Now she's either a hooker or dead. Maybe both.</br>  <br>So he made them a happy rich couple that love each other dearly?</br>  <br> The first episode of chou <br> chou <br>Literally even the Japanese call it "Suupaa".</br></br></br>  So I heard this is set 6 months after Buu's defeat. Aren't Gohan and Videl like 16-17? And they already live alone in their own house and are soon to be married? What the hell? They didn't even date 6 months ago. 6 months is barely even enough time for Videl's hair to grow to the lenght it is now.   Shit Animation <br> Shit VA's <br> Shit Story <br><br>Why do people like this again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this. You guys can get outta here with your "muh perfect house waifu" shit, I liked the badass flying Videl so much better  you think she can still fly? </br>  <br>Because we don't take Dragon Ball seriously and just want a fun mindless series to kick back and enjoy?</br>  <br>The Author just doesn't give a fuck about it anymore. Just trying to milk out as much money as he can.</br>  <br> 6 months is barely even enough time for Videl's hair to grow to the lenght it is now. <br>Yes it does?</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed [SeNsUi]</br>  <br>When you're not underage anymore you'll appreciate her.</br>  <br>I think it maybe used to say Satan.</br>  <br>Nice projecting from the boring as fuck waifufag.</br>   No Teen Goten, no present timeline older Trunks, no older fusion of Gotenks <br><br>Just cuck my shit up Toriyama.</br></br>  <br> just want a fun mindless series to kick back and enjoy? <br><br>Then why is only half of it fun?<br><br>Goku being a bored farmer, and Mr. Satan bribing him to silence is fun.<br><br>Everything else is bland.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How long will this series run for? Here's hoping for timeskips (yeah I said it)   only 1 episode out of 100(?) <br> all those fucking complaints. </br>  <br>fuck off pedoshitter</br>  <br>I'll wait for the dub, even it takes me 2 years.</br>  <br><br> Dubfaggots </br></br>  <br>At least 100 episodes confirmed, and supposedly there's ideas for another 100 if this does well.</br>   Videl's voice.  <br>Oh how I missed you, Minaguchi.</br>  <br>She probably keeps sneezing and forgetting she wants his 4th eye.</br>  <br>Needs Topgun edit.</br>  <br><br>They're dying out anon</br></br>  <br>It's just like SS. No one calls it Chou Saiyajin, even though it uses that kanji because it gives suupaa as the reading for the kanji.</br>  <br>Let him be a family man, faggot.</br>  <br>Toriyama says she still pesters the shit out of Tien, who has a fuck huge farm. She basically became crazy stalker ever since Tien showed up and went after the 3 eyed D.</br>  <br>/a/ will shit on every single episode just for the sake of it</br>  <br>It doesn't matter if you never wanted to be a fighter. Sometimes shit happens and you have a responsibility to do something that you don't want to do. This is one of those times. Gohan is just being a selfish prick.</br>  <br> This is one of those times <br>Why? What's going on? Nothing is happening. The world is safe. Beerus is destroying planets but gohan doesn't know that yet. The opening showed him in his fighting clothes so it's implied he will fight alongside goku and the others eventually when shit goes down</br></br>  <br>This is the dumbest argument ever. By that logic everyone should strive to be the best they can possibly be without wasting any potential. Yet, here we all are wasting time on 4chan. The blatant hypocrisy of this mindset is just astounding.</br>  <br>Because his ambitions are lame and it's a sin for the son of a MC to not become a badass.</br>  I hope there are 300 episodes.  <br>Because Gohan is a fucking dumbass if he thinks that this peace is going to last. All his life there are always threats that keep popping up and he should know by now that Goku and Vegeta aren't really enough to keep the world safe. Not only that, but shit that they used before that saved their asses cannot be used anymore from what I remember. (fusion earings, hyperbolic time chamber). <br>So right now, if Goku and Vegeta are somehow incapacitated, the world is fucked because this pussy whipped little faggot didn't want to do something that only he can do. <br>What needs to happen is Goku or Piccolo needs to tell him to either get serious and train again or stay his ass away from battles because all he does is get the fuck in the way.<br><br>This isn't remotely the same thing. Stop projecting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>weeaboo</br>  <br>It doesn't have to be the same thing. It just has to be similar enough. The vast majority of people don't live up to their potential, but for some reason you expect Gohan to devote his life to training because he should feel obligated to do so. That's just silly, especially when Goku and Vegeta are around.</br>  <br>*shrug*<br>At my local comic book shop the owner wore a shirt with his name on it in giant ass letters. <br>It was his "name badge"</br></br></br>  <br> tfw toriyama literally forgot she existed in DBZ <br> he probably did it again </br></br>  <br>dragonball timeline has always been retarded, just go with it.</br>  <br>Trunks and Goten will clearly join pilaf's gang after we get to the BOG time.</br>  <br>Living up to his potential isn't the problem. Its him trying to have his cake and eat it too. If he didn't try to show up to battles I wouldn't have a problem with his bitch ass. But the fact that this motherfucker is going to keep showing up, getting dropped like the little bitch that he is and get in the way really pisses me off when he could have done something about it. Just stay the fuck at home if you aren't even going to try.</br>  <br>Are you 12?</br>   Why is Gohan so awful now? <br> Why is he not fighting like he should be? <br><br>FUCK YOU PEOPLE<br><br>Gohan has had his life in danger since he was 3 years old. Goku didn't start his adventure when he was 10/11. Goku was fighting in his first tournament at around 12. What was Gohan doing? FUCKING FIGHTING CELL TO SAVE THE PLANET! He never asked for any of this or really wanted to fight but he had to because he had the ability to.<br><br>He is Half Saiyan so he does not care as much about fighting. Same with Trunks and Goten yet people give Gohan shit because he stopped trying as hard when he was the strongest.<br><br>Even Krillin said fuck it when he got 18. Only full breed Monkeys care that much about fighting. <br><br>If he wants to be a scholar and have a happy simple life with his wife let him. He deserves it, his dad can handle the rest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  DBZfags are the worst<br><br>They don't like to view anything from the humanistic point of view. It is always WHY DOESNT HE KEEP FIGHTING AND TRAINING!?!</br></br>  <br> He should just stay home. <br><br>Dude, he hasn't been 100% useless in any fight, if it wasn't for him, Piccolo would be DEAD(in RoF), and the Beerus situation NO ONE was able to beat him. Come on, Gohan is the third strongest guy on the 'good' team, if he doesn't appear, no one else should except Goku and Vegeta.</br></br></br>  <br>His dad spends more time dead than alive. And Vegeta can never step up to the plate and always gets blown the fuck up.<br>Gohan should be a contingency. The world hinges on these 6 sayan fuckwads and only one of them is actually useful anymore.</br></br>  <br> implying fighting is the cake <br><br>Gohan doesn't want to fight. The only reason he does is because he feels like he should help.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't mean he can't have a happy life.<br> Wanting him to sacrifice what makes him happy just he can train just in case vegeta and goku can't fight <br><br>Fuck that.<br>Let him be happy. Everyone in Super is happy for him as he is enjoying his life right now. Well expect Piccolo but that is because he got NTR by Videl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Working as a maillady</br>  <br>Sounds like /fit/ tbh</br>  <br>No, /fit/ is mostly filled with people who don't even lift.</br>  <br>WHICH MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE<br>If you feel like you don't need to train, then you shouldn't feel like you "need" to help. Seems to me like Gohan is just a fucking attention whore. <br><br> he hasn't been 100% useless in any fight <br>Did you not see BoG? Piccolo would be dead if Gohan wasn't there? Don't know about this one since I haven't seen the film yet. But if I have to make a wild guess if Gohan was in peak condition + SSG I doubt the situation would have gotten as bad as it did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Self-sacrifice is very humanistic.</br>  <br>Either way they use the logic of 11-13 year old and not understanding how a person may honestly feel about a situation but instead focus on WHY AREN'T THEY STRONGER!?</br>  <br>Thanks for the full series analysis anon, make sure to come back next week so you can fill in the other half you'd be missing then.</br>  <br> he gets in the way  <br>When? Are you talking about when he was a little child? Yeah they dragged a little child to a battlefield then complain he doesn't compete with the others. Bravo piccolo. <br>Or are you talking about him as a teenager when he stood in nobody's way and then killed cell, against his own will because goku made him ? Or in the buu saga when the kaioshin froze him in place and his energy got stolen, again, forcing him to be part of the action? And then getting wrecked by buu (but so did vegeta). I honestly don't know what you're talking about.</br></br></br>  When will the dubs come for this thing? <br>This is literally the ONLY show that I'll never watch with subs.<br>Hearing japanese goku just makes me cringe.</br></br>  <br> Self-sacrifice is very humanistic. <br>Yes, in situation where there is no other choice. If you are free from a Ultimatum why do so? Train forever just in-case?<br><br><br> If you feel like you don't need to train, then you shouldn't feel like you "need" to help. Seems to me like Gohan is just a fucking attention whore. <br>That logic is bullshit and you know it. Trying to say because you are not spending every minute dedicated to one thing means you don't care/attentionwhoring is fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I liked the badass flying Videl so much better you think she can still fly? <br><br>You mean the one that got her teeth knocked out?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Its because in the world of dragonball not being able to deal with the latest planet buster is a death sentence, him not staying in tip top shape is pretty irresponsible, especially as a parent with a wife and child to protect.</br></br>  <br> stay his ass away from battles because all he does is get the fuck in the way. <br><br>Then why is Yamcha still allowed to fight?</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to spend every moment doing it. Not even Goku does that. <br><br>I'm talking about bog and rof.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like he, and the rest of them either need to go train with elder kai or fuck right off with gohan. They don't do shit when the big bad is fucking everyone up either.</br>  <br>Gohan's supposed to be smart<br>Saving the world &gt; being a salaryman on every conceivable level<br>Unless he goes full SCIENCE! and invents tech that can protect earth from world-breakers, then being a fighting god is his most significant contribution to humanity</br></br></br>  <br>I've heard that Gohan's vision is ass, and in fights he just relies on sensing ki to get by.<br><br>I dunno if that was legit, or just some anon's headcannon though.</br></br></br>  Gohan was suppose to take over as mc but never got the chance because neets demanded more goku  I wonder if this will get a mexican dub  <br>Are you always able to watch most stuff raw, without using dictionaries and the like? That's pretty cool man to be there in a year.</br>  <br><br> kidnapped by alien uncle <br> dad dies trying to save him <br> kidnapped again by dad's demon slug alien archenemy because stronger aliens are coming <br> befriend slug man, but he dies protecting him <br> gets beat up by manlet alien <br> goes to slug man's home planet to revive dead friends <br> gets beat up by dancing aliens and space hitler <br> after getting beat up by weird android bug he finally had enough and went SSJ2 <br> dad dies again  <br><br>This is all before he turned 12, most of it while he was 5/6. And even during 7 years of peace, he still had to look after his mom and little brother by himself. He's earned a peaceful life with a rich qt girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SenSui was alright, but why haven't any actual groups picked this up yet?</br>  <br> He's earned a peaceful life <br>True, but since when is the universe so kind as to give people what they've earned?<br>Gohan is one of the few people on the planet who can fight world-busters</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck the world nigga. Gohan doesn't have to rescue shit</br>  <br>No sayian makes a good parent period.</br>  <br>if dragon ball online is still canon then when he became older he studied Ki, learned how it works, released a book about it and unleashed a new era of martial arts all over the world where everyone and their mothers know how to fly and throw energy beams, that is surely his biggest contribution to mankind</br>  <br>Where is her going to fuck Videl if there's no world?<br>Namek?<br>Man, fuck Namek!</br></br></br>  <br>Only the 'released a book" seems different than the others<br>And even then, unless he developed "world-busting for dummies" techniques, then that's a bunch of power level 1000 people vs planet-busters (I didn't play DBO, I don't know its power level)</br></br>  One thing i never got with Gohan during the 7 year gap was, Why both? Study and train?<br><br>I mean nothing goes against his character wanting to stay fit might be a good way to vent stress or something. And he was already crazy smart at 5-7. So its not like hes a retard that needs 24/7 to study for 7 years straight. <br><br>And As for Current DBSuper Gohan, I'm glad he's settling down to be a scholar/Husband with his very own green guardian angel/stalker. He better be a better dad than Vegeta and Goku. if he turns out to be a shit dad too I'll be pissed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't FotNS nigger.</br>  <br>Piccolo will end up being Pan's tutor since Gohan will be <br> MUH BOOKS </br></br>  <br>Gon and Killua</br>  <br> *shrug* <br>Summer has come</br></br>  <br>Women can grow their hair out faster. It's all in the estrogen.</br>  <br>What? He isn't in his 20s by now?</br>  <br>Nice pasta</br>  <br>literally only autists care</br>  <br>In Super no. Its literally months after Buu's defeat. So gohan is still 16. BOG he was 20, ROF he was 21.</br>  Why was money EVER an issue for Chichi and Goku? <br><br>Bulma is literally (literally literally) the richest woman on the entire planet. Would Bulma really not let Goten and Gohan learn from Dr. Briefs or pay for the best tutors on the entire planet given their history together?<br><br>If Gohan or Goten didn't get into the college they wanted Bulma could literally buy Tokyo University and have the professors teach them one on one all day long. This is really bothering me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Toriyama has an editor that he has to listen to.<br><br>Toriyama setup DBZ to focus around Gohan. Gohan's development and growth. With Goku dying. Story would focus on Gohan as the MC.<br><br>But producer clashed and said the manga's base (now older) would identify with Goku instead of Gohan (DB/DBZ were in shounen serialization).<br><br>So Toriyama cuck'd(NTR for /a/) Gohan and gave starting role back to Goku who was already dead.<br><br>PROOFS:<br>- show focused on Gohan's development<br>- Gohan normally wouldn't be a factor considering he's not nearly as strong to take on adults<br>- Even at the end of DBZ. Mystic(englightened Gohan) was still the strongest single person in the universe.<br><br>Gohan &gt; Evil Buu &gt; SSJ3 Goku</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is really bothering me. <br>High functioning autism</br></br>  <br>wheredoyouthinkyouare.mov</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127694517 <br>Did you literally just call out an anime thread on /a/?</br>  <br>Do you really see ChiChi begging Bulma for money?<br><br>Yeah Bulma would give it to them but Chichi would much rather see Goku earn the money. Or win it.</br></br></br>  <br> especially as a parent with a wife and child to protect. <br>While having spent half his childhood looking after his mother and younger brother... I see a point in just trying to BE THERE for his family instead of training.</br></br>  <br>Well would you ask for rich friend "Hey pay for all the things I need, We're Friends after all" Seems like a dick move to make your friends pay for your life.</br>  <br>I don't mind the thread, I mind the people that are in here right now.</br>  <br> Yeah Bulma would give it to them but Chichi would much rather see Goku earn the money. Or win it. <br>Yeah and she chooses literally the most inefficient way to make use of his talents to make money. Farming. Like a normalfag, even.<br><br>If you're gonna make him farm at least let him do it at supersonic speeds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan was a totally awesome brother to Goten. playing with him and stuff. iirc Goten was more shaken up by Gohan's death than ChiChi's</br>  <br>Gohan's powerlevel downgrade post-Buu was all kinds of bullshit when between the Cell arc and Buu arc he did fuck-all for an even longer period of time and came out of it barely weaker. Only Vegeta was pissy enough to complain about his insignificant powerlevel downgrade.</br>  <br>Yeah that was pretty silly. Goku/Gohan/Goten could plow and plant a 10k acre hunk of land in about 10 minutes. Goku was just fucking around pretending to work because he couldn't get his mind off training.</br>  <br>She said he could earn money in another way but Goku refused.</br>  <br>And then Goku agreed to farm but ended up just fucking around doing zero farming...<br><br>If anything Goku should've agreed to be a fisherman and traveled the world catching rare fishes and selling them...he gets excitement, exercise, WAY more money than farming, and can fuck around and train all he wants without getting yelled at.<br><br>I guess Goku and Chichi are canonically pretty fucking retarded though so it makes sense that they act stupidly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku was Earth's guardian and he had just died.<br>Gohan had the greatest potential out of all of earth's fighters. The whole point of that arc was supposed to be a passing of the torch. Instead Japan maintains the status quo by making Gohan a bitch and reviving Goku who Toriyama had been trying to kill off for the entirety of the series.</br></br>  <br>Never heard of that before. Probably not canon.</br>  <br> Toriyama setup DBZ to <br>It was a weekly manga and a weekly television show you fucking faggot. It wasn't like Z was some grand return, it aired a week after DB ended</br></br>  <br>And Dragon Ball was supposed to end after Frieza. Gohan fans are just salty because he's not a badass like Goku and Vegeta even though he's not a battle maniac like them. He was a normal teenager who wanted to live peacefully, he stayed true to his character.</br>  <br>Dragon Ball was supposed to end after the Pilaf saga shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>Throwing his character development out the window and regressing isn't staying true to his character.<br><br>They needed an excuse to bring back Goku so as per usual they did the only thing they knew how to : butcher every other character so that Goku has to come in and save everyone because he's the only one who can ever get things done.</br></br></br>   tsundere tomboy Videl is permanently dead <br> she's now generic housewife <br>Will 18's personality be kill too?</br></br>  <br>i feel like you're missing the point. In their world, Gohan revolutionized the entire world. About as much as the inventions of book printing, or steam engines, or the internet. or the discovery of electricity, Gohan studied Ki and revolutionized the world. I know what youre getting at: there is no world if some evil guy blows it up. But ya know. That's what they're making children for. Trunks, Goten, Pan, etc. The future protectors of the planet.</br>  <br> implying everone on /a/ doesn't talk about wanting to fuck fictional characters </br>  <br>IIRC Piccolo or Goku wore a hat with their name on it during the driving test</br>  <br>It's the least Bulma can do.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Fuck Goku driving tractor reminded me of that episode where he was learning to drive  <br>Throwing what? He trained because he was forced to, he beat the big bad Cell and his daily life became normal, end of story. Nothing as been thrown, Gohan development was when he was a coward, now he can fight when it's needed but he's not like Goku and Vegeta, it doesn't interest him.</br>  <br> And Dragon Ball was supposed to end after Frieza. <br>Dragon Ball was supposed to end at like 5 different places. Don't be retarded.</br></br>  <br>Oh my God this makes me so mad. There is literally no human on the planet who works as hard as Goku. He is anything BUT lazy.</br>  <br>Actually, Goku loves being lazy when it comes to doing anything other than training and fighting.<br><br>He's the hardest worker when it comes to training. Not so much anything else. Remember when Roshi tried to get them to study?</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Gohanfags excuse is shit. He doesn't like fights so he studied and stopped training, simple as that.</br>  <br>that episode is now confirmed for canon,chi chi eventually forces goku and piccolo to do the driving test again and that is why he is driving in this episode, we will have an episode later about this second attempt in a flashback</br>  ITT  <br> Villains that did nothing wrong <br>Look up what villain means.</br></br>  <br>Take that advice yourself, a villain can be a bad guy to a group of people, while being a hero to his own.<br><br>Please learn to think outside the box.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not a villain if you never do any wrong.</br>   did nothing wrong <br><br>That rat did everything wrong.</br></br>  The Ultimate Minus, Leader of Class of Minus-13<br>and the controller of All-Fiction.<br><br>Kumagawa Misogi, The natural born loser.</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing he did wrong was not to win.</br>  <br>How's that freshman writing course treating you? You are conflating villains with antagonists. Villains are always evil. That's the literal definition of a villain: an evil person who does evil things. Antagonists are just characters that oppose the protagonist, they don't have to be evil. They just have to stand in his way and provide some kind of conflict. <br><br>TL;DR villains by definition have to be "wrong" or else they aren't evil, and if they aren't evil they're not villainous.</br></br></br>  <br>Go read a book, seeing as you have literally no idea what you're talking about. A villain can change his status to anti-villain if his motivation for "evil" proves to be of good intent, examples being Dr Doom. <br><br>Next time try not to come of as some pretentious know-it-all-faggot because of some meme you literal retard.</br></br></br>  <br>An anti-villain is still a villain who does villainous things.</br>  <br>what is perspective?</br>  <br>The only thing he did wrong was to abduct the red haired bitch and her baby daddy in order to kill the parents and indoctrinate the child. I don't care who you are or where you're from, that shit was underhanded, even against the arrogant humans.</br>  <br>If "wrong things" are up to perspective, then "villain" must be as well, because that's what the term villain is all about.</br>  <br> If "wrong things" are up to perspective, then "villain" must be as well <br>exactly, now you're up to speed. perhaps now you can contribute to the thread.</br></br>  <br>Mamoru was made for protecting</br>  <br> exactly, now you're up to speed. <br>Oh, so the thread was about "villains who aren't necessarily villains" all along?</br></br>        <br>Fuck off Griffith fag</br>    <br>So he's like Greece?</br>  <br>villain<br> noun vil·lain \ˈvi-lən\<br>: a character in a story, movie, etc., who does bad things<br><br>: a person who does bad things<br><br>: someone or something that is blamed for a particular problem or difficulty</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He just wanted to rule the universe!</br>      <br>Intent is largely irrelevant.<br>It only matters when you try to figure out if he's a straight villain or an anti-villain.</br></br>  <br>What the... what?</br>  <br>Villains are people who do bad things.<br>If the villain does bad things for reasons that are not typically villainous, it's an anti-villain.</br></br>  <br>isn't intent what differentiates the two?</br>  <br>Intent differentiates villain and anti-villain, yes.<br>Isn't that what I just said?</br></br>  <br>he was bringing order to the universe, he made Beerus go to sleep for a few decades and he introduced technology to underdeveloped species, when a species was too savage and dangerous (the saiyans) he eliminated them.

Evil is always a matter of morals.<br><br> the outcome justifies the means, meaning they did nothing wrong. <br>So long as the "means" are within certain limits the character can still be considered an anti-hero.<br>As soon as that threshold is passed, you are a villain.<br>Your intent does not affect the threshold.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which you just finished saying was irrelevant <br>Nigger, do you have a reading disorder?<br> in regards to this. </br></br></br>  <br>he was following orders, but delighted in the sadism. he has no redeeming features</br>  <br>If what you do is evil but the outcome is an even more powerful good, you are morally evil but logically correct.<br>This is why forced eugenics are considered evil.</br></br>  <br>because he is, of course what he did to the namekians was questionable but when the opportunity to achieve immortality to continue his policing of the universe forever arose he was going to do whatever it took. Goku even tells Frieza that he gave the saiyans what they deserved.</br>  <br>No it does not, if you genocide people with the intent of "well I was just protecting my teddybear incase they would steal it, not because I hated them" its still evil.<br><br>They simply cared more about their own personal opinion on what is correct so much it hurts others, hence they are evil.</br></br></br>  <br>He did nothing wrong regardless of the fact he was a sadist, that's a textbook Ad hominem. Failure to upkeep strict regulations over the wolf's maw would destroy the leading country itself. The populus knew that any and all that attempted to cross the barrior would be murdered, he killed absolutely no one without initial reason.</br>  Not really a villain I guess  <br> you are morally evil but logically correct. <br>Again. Evil is always a matter of morals.<br>Saying "morally evil" makes you sound like a retard.<br><br> powerful good <br>Strange wording.<br><br>Yes, a greater good also makes a greater cost acceptable before you slide into villain territory.<br>We do not disagree on this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Again. Evil is always a matter of morals. <br> Saying "morally evil" makes you sound like a retard. <br>If evil is a matter of morals, there is nothing incorrect with saying morally evil.</br></br></br>  <br> lists Pucci <br> doesn't list Valentine  <br><br>Come on</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Redundancy != tautology</br></br>  <br>True.<br>It's not incorrect. It just makes you sound like a retard.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion on me doesn't matter, all that maters is if i'm correct in an argument.<br>Also my first language is German, sorry.</br></br>  <br>A tautology is a redundancy.<br> tau·tol·o·gy (tô-tŏl′ə-jē) <br> n. pl. tau·tol·o·gies <br> 1. <br> a. Needless repetition of the same sense in different words; redundancy. <br><br><br>"Moralisch böse" is a dumb phrasing too, on the same level as "weißer Schimmel".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How would I put it in better terms then, would intrinsically evil work?</br>  <br>They weren't humans. They were gods.</br>  <br>Why do you think vicious is the worst?<br><br>You would get revenge too if the two people who you LOVE most in the world betrayed you and both ntr you.</br></br></br>  <br>The cars thing confused me, he protected that puppy for one, so how would his rule be? probably still bad.</br>  <br>Just "evil" should suffice. I personally don't like the word because it is so badly defined. If I can I completely avoid it.<br>Sacrificing a number of people to save many would not be evil in my book. It might be coldhearted, possibly calculating. Generally the best adjective would probably be pragmatic.<br>There might be other descriptors, depending on the circumstances. Fanatic/dogmatic/closed-minded are common among such characters that appear in anime and manga.</br></br></br>    <br>An open mind is like a fortress with its gate unbarred and unguarded. you dont let any opinion in, you are cynical for a reason.<br><br>Its a slippery slope.</br></br></br>  <br>Vicious, as the main villain, suffers greatly from lack of development for one. I think centring around revenge is shit in general, and especially pathetic when there are so many other variables to consider. He should've been more angry with himself than with Spike, considering his waifu pretty much hated him in the first place and knew he was a bastard from the start. He was just a bastard for the sake of being a bastard from the start.</br>  <br>Not quite.<br>A closed mind is not a fortress, it's a ship that refuses to set sail and let itself be moved about by the wind.<br>A mind that will not let itself be tested against other minds inevitably goes off-track and develops some funny quirks.<br><br>Of course you change when you allow other people to affect your way of thinking. But that change is necessary to maintain your mental health, because it is also the only thing mending away the logical errors in your reasoning that you alone cannot even find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kars' one redeemable feature was that he cared for animals. However, once he ascends to godhood you see him creating life that killed that innocent squirrel. This was to show that any redeemable features Kars might of had are now gone and he has become 100% pure evil.</br>  <br>I agree with you entirely, but you need to understand that many people have strong grounds and heavily believe in the term "evil", it has a defined definition and logical use to the term whether or not you believe it to be real.</br>    <br>For the weakminded, there was no change other then following others with no reasoning from himself.<br><br>Thats why a person with logical sense and reasoning can find it himself, since there is no reason others can do something special just because they are someone else. Thats insanity.<br>Their constructive criticism is flawed, that is one's own constructive criticism of their criticism.<br><br><br>Instead, a mentaly logical person would correct them instead. Everyone is not equal in value or ability.<br><br>Some people are logical then others, a fortress or a ship that lets everyone onboard is a horrible place, only cynical and careful measurement is the way to go. we have it in our instinct for a reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate how hamfisted the author acted with squealer.<br><br>He made it blatantly obvious at every turn that we were supposed to cheer for him despite giving him the villain perspective.<br><br>It was hilarious how everytime a queerat did something wrong they'd take a human and have them do something exponentially worse to make sure you realized that they weren't so bad in comparison.<br><br>What an obnoxious story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are delusional.<br>But there is no point in arguing with you since apparently you have decided that you must not take input from other people, so I will leave it at that.</br></br>  <br> Stalin-san <br> not Adolf-senpai </br></br>  <br>Pretty sure 'coercing and massacring your own species because they don't agree with you' counts as wrong.</br>  <br>The same can be said to you, thus proving your point wrong.<br><br>If you cant point out what is delusional, then you have no logic or reason to your argument.<br><br>Hence why you DONT have an open mind about things, you have a zero tolerance for open mindedness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The same can be said *about* you, <br>ftfy<br> thus proving your point wrong. <br>This is not logical, proving that your thought processes are not nearly as logical as you think they are.<br>I can advocate things that I am not capable of. I can understand that it would be advantageous to have a certain ability while I am lacking that same ability.<br><br> If you cant point out what is delusional, <br>I already did. You said I was wrong without any basis for your claims. I said your mind develops logical holes (such as the one I just pointed out) that you cannot easily find without having others to point them out.<br>Also, I did not say that I "can't". That is your personal interpretation, which again is not logical. It may be likely, but likely and logical are two completely different things.<br><br>Would you like to leave your mind open to continue this discussion?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Souther could do nothing until his masters death  <br>He needed no redeemable features, he did what he did because he wished to evolve himself as a species and into a god, he's a lot more complex as a character.<br>It's not as if he entirely wished to disregard smaller and weaker lifeforms either, he had nothing against turning humans that wished to join him into zombies, or high ranking zombies if he saw value in them.</br></br>  <br>"ftrbbq"<br><br>No its you who are not logical. <br><br>This does explain why this guy is not making anymore grammatical sense as showned here.<br>"I can advocate things that I am not capable of. I can understand that it would be advantageous to have a certain ability while I am lacking that same ability." He certainly isn't able to form a coherent sentense.<br><br><br>That said he is unable to find fault in logic just proves he was wrong. Still, its good he admits its his personal interpretation, just like he admits its his personal interpretation that others have personal interpretation.<br><br>Since he cant and admitted he cant, he cant figure out probability either.<br><br>Hence why you dont leave a open mind in the sense of not allowing everyone in your fortress or ship.<br><br>Would you mind if I dont have an open mind and still continue this discussion?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't you both agree to disagree?<br>It's one of those situations where neither opinion is correct and entirely subjective.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you drunk?</br>    <br>There is no such situation ever.<br><br>That said, you dont allow bad opinions in your thinking anymore then you allow your fortress to be an open mind, as its like unguarding it and having it unbarred.<br><br>Only carefully measurement of each person/statement that might be fact or not until measured, do you let said thing in your fortress. If its bad you reject it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is no such situation ever. <br> That said, you dont allow bad opinions in your thinking anymore then you allow your fortress to be an open mind, <br>Integrative complexity is a research psychometric that refers to the degree to which thinking and reasoning involve the recognition and integration of multiple perspectives and possibilities and their interrelated contingencies.<br>Integrative complexity is a measure of the intellectual style used by individuals or groups in processing information, problem-solving, and decision making. Complexity looks at the structure of one's thoughts, while ignoring the contents. It is scorable from almost any verbal materials: written materials, such as books, articles, letters, and transcript; as well as audio-visual material.<br>The measure of integrative complexity has two components: differentiation and integration. Differentiation refers to the perception of different dimensions when considering an issue. Integration refers to the recognition of cognitive connections among differentiated dimensions or perspectives.[1]<br>In a 1988 study it was demonstrated that changes in Integrative Complexity could be potentially used in international violence prediction.[2] These findings were seen again a 1995 article by Guttieri, Wallace, and Suedfeld looking at the Cuban Missile Crisis.[3]<br><br>Tldr; You are a human being with an abysmally low amount of integrative complexity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  For ants  <br>There is no such thing as a bad subjective opinion.</br>  <br>But winning is everything, Anon.</br>  <br>I know the whole "nothing wrong" meme gets throws around a lot but this guy really did do nothing wrong.

Then Shinoa broke it down and put herself into a tight spot that needed to have their approach changed.</br></br>  <br>As far as HER SQUAD goes, it's HER SQUAD, which answers to HER. If she says "let the yandere vampire take him," those are her orders and they listen. It seemed fairly obvious that for those outside her squad, the people that know her personally were waiting to find out what the fuck was going on, and those that didn't know her were being held back by her and her squad.</br>  <br>He has seen Shinoa telling Yuu to escape before while she was about to get killed by a vampire<br><br>Mika is a retard</br></br></br>  <br>Yu is just going to wake up an get  triggered  right?</br>  <br>He is gonna wake up see Mika and immediately ask where Guren, Shinoa and co are<br><br>Mika is not gonna know how to respond and Yuu will immediately assume the worse</br></br></br>  So the seraph faction is born already  <br>Nah Mika will get  triggered  when he sees Shinoa and co getting beat and is reminded of how he failed to save his previous family. If he doesn't enter  Seraph mode  by this arc, then he probably isn't  a Seraph .</br>  <br> Shinoa telling Yuu to escape before while she was about to get killed by a vampire <br>This is like the most generic thing to do in order to get help</br></br>  The author wrote an interesting premise and characters, but holy fuck does their storytelling need work.  <br>Satan, pls.<br><br>Isn't it adapted fro a LN? I thought it was the case.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, they wrote a prequel novel but I'm pretty sure the manga is the original material.</br></br>   family <br><br>It's like they have an obsession for that word. Only thing that gets on my nerves with this manga.</br></br>  <br> fujoshit logic </br>  <br>He's writing the manga and a prequel LN series about Guren at the same time.</br>  <br>You seem like the kind of guy that would easily be pulled in by con artists.</br>  <br> Muh dead family <br> He's family <br> Isn't that the guy he calls his family? <br> We're family <br> Some family we are <br> Take care of your family <br> Don't touch my family <br> Let's adopt this faggot into our family because he's our families family </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really triggers me. Wish they would stop with that. If not, at least reduce the amount of times and leave it for the very important moments.</br>  <br>This manga is shit. <br><br>More news at 11</br></br></br>  <br>It already hasn't shown up for a while till this chapter</br>  she did what?  hot  BEST OP<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cdx<wbr>Z6rRbNFY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  I just watched it.<br><br> Maria kicks the villain <br> Instantly floored by counterhit <br><br>They do it on purpose. Just like Hibiki will never ever have a real rival, I'll bet 2hu won't even get a punch thrown at her.<br> <br>Otherwise it was spectacular, but then again so was S2's first episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> NOT EVEN THE OP </br>  <br>Biki is female Goku.</br>  We need more furries.  <br>You can say "Wingardium Leviosa" all you want but you're not going to be able to learn Harry Potter magic. Even if they look like humans, they're aliens.</br>  <br>Until it's really developed and researched I don't think anyone will be using magic at a mainstream level yet. <br><br>But fuck, look at the shit Lelei doing <br><br>I'm sure the top researcher in their own field are starting to use it. <br><br> Hawking would be even stronger than Lelei. Just image all the fucking battles at the most prestigious universities against each department. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yfw steven hawking gets paid bank and is given a super robo terminator body just to open Hawking Holes to otherworlds and kill their leaders.</br>  <br> animuu was a flop <br><br>I liked it. A lot of people liked it. Just because you on 4 computers thinks it's bad doesn't mean the overall opinion is bad.</br></br></br>  <br>It would really turn the whole world around. Instead of money for power. Knowledge would actually be power. People would start actually learning shit and making breakthroughs just so they won't be bullied into oblivion.</br>  Who is your deity ? You can only choose one.      <br>Jesus Christ</br>  I'm going to post this everyday until you like it.  i will hate YOU until the stars burn out and the light fades.<br><br>i hope that sakura will be my gf</br></br>  <br>This thread needs more Ilya.</br>  164 days since moot died.<br>21582 days left until AoG dies.</br>  I will stars it until the hate burns out and the light fades.<br><br>I hope that me will spend this time trying to convince you otherwise.</br></br>  <br>I almost like this.</br></blockquote>]
