THIS is what it does above everything else.</br></br>  <br>One helluva downgrade.</br>  <br>But Barakamon is less moeshit than this.</br>  <br>"We want Idolmaster audience" happened.</br>  <br>Will the mangafags stop complaining anytime soon? We get it, you fucking hate it. How many threads has it been already?</br>  <br>to be fair we haven't seen her with her helmet off yet<br><br>she looks like a Shota protagonist currently<br>her nickname is Shortstacks, she's not tall</br></br></br></br>  <br> moeshit </br>   Hurr durr muh designs <br><br>Why are you faggots so anal about this shit? Nobody fucking cares</br></br>  <br>They'll never stop, and that's fine. Nobody gives a fuck if animeonlyfags are butthurt.</br>  <br> MC is an Otaku <br>i've dropped this series after i knew this fact</br></br>  <br><br><br>Cancer</br></br></br>  <br> 35 years old <br>I want to be her husbando tbh.</br></br>  <br>It's A1 and they took the moeshit route.<br><br>They even censored the jabs at China and only portrayed Darrel's Administration.</br></br></br>  <br>It'll be hilarious if a little army girl beats the shit out of the prince.</br>  <br>Why do you get so butthurt with this? They clearly improved her design to suit the current trend or it wont sell. She's much cuter now though her masculinity has been toned down to the extreme but at least they keep the bust size the same as before. <br><br>I read the manga and i think anime design is much better.</br></br></br>  <br>It because you're a moefag of course you love that frail looking grill with big eyes. At later scene when she do some badass scene no doubt it will be laughable with her current design right now. i had enough with current manga direction right now with all of the sudden harem pandering now we got some shitty studio trying to moefy the show.</br>  <br>No, that's Mami, stupid.</br>  <br>I enjoy moe ironically though, there's no point in resisting it since you can do nothing against it.</br>  <br> MUH MANGA DESIGN <br>Yea well she looks fucking disgusting in the manga, at least now we can see she is a woman, stop thinking you are special just cause you read the manga, because you are not, and your opinion will still be shit regardless of the media you use.<br><br> Inb4 moeshit </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Actually, her LN design is more like the manga design.<br>Most of the characters in the Anime look like either the LN or manga design, but she was given a new design completely.</br></br>  <br>This. Are you finally realizing what moeshit does? It spreads to other anime and manga like a disease.</br>   being surprised when Japan turns nearly every woman into fap fodder, usually by pandering to a very narrow set of what mainstream otaku find attractive   Didn't someone post some other pages showing OP to be misleading last time?  <br>She's fucking 24.</br>  <br>The LN came after the manga you know. Also she doesn't look at all like that in the LN.</br>  Cowtit lovers getting destroyed.  <br>she got idolmasterified, wich is fucking disgusting.</br>  moefags ruin everything  lol I was going to put together OP's pic but I'm too lazy.... still, saved  <br><br><br><br>Get used to it, fags. Heh</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like it's a new occurrence</br>  Anime was kill in 2007. You can only cry now.  Move along, nothing to see here...  <br>Look at that ordinance</br>  <br>Wow, that's horrible. The left looks much more likable, while the right is just forgettable.</br>  <br> those tits <br>the only reason im actually mad about the anime design is that we won't get to see this scene, or at least it won't be so great as in the manga</br></br>  <br> edgy <br>Uhhhhhhhh</br></br>  <br><br>You now realize Kuri's greatest feat of strength is being able to stand straight.</br></br>  Honestly, why should you care? The anime is toned down trash anyway. Expect many other things to be changed and most probably cut.<br><br><br>This is /b/-grade logic.</br></br></br>  <br>unf<br>those muscles</br></br>  <br>They upgraded to a better design, now it looks like a girl.</br>  They fucked it all up. The whole show. Expect so many things to be left out or just modified to be kawaii uguu.  I just hope they keep Rory's expressions intact.  <br>Why are you such a fucking liar?<br><br>Or totally ignorant?</br></br></br>  <br>Dropped.</br>  <br>So, you're telling me I should avoid the anime and just read the manga, huh?</br>  Okay, what got 'censored' in the anime?<br><br>Did they omit scenes from the source material? I didn't notice any blatant blacked out spots on the video.</br></br>  <br>Left's tits are fucking disgusting, so I don't even have an issue with this.</br>  <br>Just edgy shit like war rape.</br>  <br>Yeah. Fuck this series. Fuck the guy who recommended it to me. Fuck anyone who calls this 'anime of the season' or a 'must watch'.</br>  <br> real things that happen in war are portrayed in a war manga <br> edgy </br></br>  <br>There are some parts of Rory's introduction that got toned-down and ironically made her look like less of a good person. A big part of Tuka's (the elf) introduction got moved around, but there's no way we won't see it because it becomes a pretty big plot point later on.</br>  <br>They're beautiful, faggot.</br>  <br>Web Novel: 2006<br>Novel: 2010<br>Manga: 2011<br>Light Novel: 2012<br><br>The Novel didn't have illustrations, beyond the cover.<br><br><br>Violence was toned down. The scale of the invasion in the first episode was massively played down.<br>The dragon fight was extremely tame—not only does it laugh at you by saying there are a lot of bodies and that's it, they tried so hard not to show a speck of blood that you can't even tell that the Dragon's arm was blown off, unless you actually know it happened before hand, because of all the smoke.<br>I've seen people mention how nothing hurt the dragon, only to be surprised when told the dragon's arm was blown off, and they had to go back and verify.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are they animating it if they're just going to piss all over the material?</br>  <br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Gate_-_Thus_the_JSD<wbr>F_Fought_There:Rory_the_Reaper<br>The manga actually added to that scene, so yeah.</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Where did all these huge fans of the manga come from, anyway? It's not like there were a ton of threads beforehand, and people in them mostly seemed to just be reading casually for the nippon stronk shit and Rori. Now all of a sudden people are bitching left and right about how the anime is pandering garbage that ruined the whole thing.</br>  <br>Because ¢a$h baby</br>  <br>They turned her into a generic girl who is clearly not fit enough to work for the military. I mean seriously she has no muscles, when we get to her badass scene's it's just going to look weird as with the Anime design she clearly doesn't possess the strength or stamina to do it.</br>  <br>Before, the threads were mostly monthly, following a new manga chapter release.<br><br>More recently, the threads picked up a lot of pace, but they still existed before, and there was a good following.</br></br></br>  <br> Now all of a sudden people are bitching left and right about how the anime is pandering garbage that ruined the whole thing. <br>Really? I mean holy shit this is already a series about an otaku going to a fantasy world and being surrounded by a harem of girls while saying JAPAN IS THE GREATEST NATION LONG LIVE THE RISING SUN<br><br>How can you pander harder?</br></br></br></br>  <br>cause its charting as well as Charlotte</br>  <br>Toning down the violence seems like a really negative point.</br>  <br>when it takes away from the story then yeah</br>  <br>You don't need the gore to enjoy the story. Maybe you need it, but the story doesn't.</br>  <br>Anon I don't "need" it, but if the whole point of the violence and shit was to expand the story, then yeah I think it's a bad thing.</br>  <br>What's wrong with gore and violence?</br>  <br>See<br><br/></br></br>  <br> JAPAN IS THE GREATEST NATION LONG LIVE THE RISING SUN <br>Wrong. He's a "humanity fuck yeah" kind of guy.</br></br>  So they replaced a kickass tomboy with a bubbly generic. <br><br>How the fuck is she going to manage this scene?</br></br>  So I heard that this was originally a novel that was adapted into a light novel, then a manga and now an anime. Supposedly it was toned down after each adaptation.<br><br>If so, how fucked up was the original novel? Or did it only tone down the rampant nationalism / JSDF propaganda?</br></br>  <br>It's going to look even more ridiculous now if she beats up the prince.</br>  <br>The story of war isn't believable if it isn't gorey.</br>  <br>Don't forget massacring the kings guard with a LMG.</br>  <br>deleted scene<br>just like the bandit rape scene<br>there will be no monster tits ether<br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This world needs more yanki girls, tomboys, etc.<br><br><br>It wasn't fucked up. It just had a lot of political rambling and Japanese nationalism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of that scene, why the hell was she using a bayonet against a bunch of armored sword &amp; shield users? How would that be effective at all?</br>  <br>You get stabbed in the neck it doesnt matter how much armor you got on</br>  <br>It's a bit more important to the storyline.</br>  <br>It was originally webnovel, then a novel, then a manga, then a light novel and now it has other random things too. The original webnovel was pretty strong in the japan strong and horrible politics and also a lot of bad ends for the characters.</br>  <br>Been saying that for a while.</br>  <br>The bayonet just so happened to have an automatic weapon attached to it.</br>  <br>but if they cant show how brutal he was towards his slaves, why should they brutaly kick his ass and put the peace treaty at risk</br>      <br> pokes a full grown mad with a bayonet <br> full grown man goes flying <br>Oh boy this is going to be fun..</br></br></br>  <br> using a bayonet against a bunch of armored sword &amp; shield users? <br><br>Yeah that was bullshit. They gave us some crap about her having some badge in close quarters combat or something, but she's taking on a bunch of people who are outfitted and trained precisely to fight against melee weapons. A bayonet isn't even such a hot weapon compared to dedicated melee weapons like swords and pikes and shit, it's an afterthought on a ranged weapon.</br></br></br>  <br> and also a lot of bad ends for the characters. <br>Like what?<br><br>I don't like spoilers but I guess it's safe to assume the manga is gonna stick to the second novel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shino is so fucking good</br>  <br>Yep she's one of the most entertaining characters in the story along with Rory.</br>  <br>Someone said that the web novel ended with Itami killing himself.<br><br>Of course, this isn't the case in the novel, light novel, nor should it be in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't refute my point. The anime didn't explicitly state that the bandits were also raping people. Sure, this is sort of implied by the fact that they're bandits, but if the suffering they were causing got a little more focus, everyone would have been much more excited about Rory killing them rather than nonplussed because generic hurr durr bandits are bad.</br>  <br>She has lighter combat armor and a bayonet is just as good as a sword, just way lighter. She's also pretty strong AND fast. I don't see how any of that is bullshit when she just cut their unprotected necks.</br>  <br>She only stabbed two or three of them. The vast majority of them were shot.</br>  <br><br>Aren't most medieval soldiers extremely large armies like these just peasants that have been through formation training exercises and the most basic of basic weapons training?</br></br>  <br> unprotected necks <br><br>Do you think some soldier with a friggin shield and melee combat training might... oh I don't know... block her?</br></br></br>  <br>Better reach and intimidation factor go a long way. Also, fucking learn to ignore petty details like that, it's a fucking anime and her specialization is CQC.</br>  <br>Oh jeez, that sounds hardcore. This has piqued my interest.<br><br><br>See ,  and .<br><br>Also remember they had to use peasants for guards and stuff after the massacre when the JSDF first entered the gate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I guess it's safe to assume the manga is gonna stick to the second novel. <br>Of course it is. The manga and light novel are both adaptations of the published novel after all. The webnovel's story is a lot different.</br></br>  <br>She does though.</br>  <br>This makes me super curious.</br>  <br><br>Anywhere I can read the original ending?</br></br>  <br>Yes, but I see her taking on soldiers clad in plate armor in the palace. Those guys are not some pitiful peasant<br><br><br> Better reach and intimidation factor go a long way. <br>A bayonet is a kitchen knife on a short stick. It doesn't exactly have a lot of reach. Also why would soldiers be intimidated by a woman they never saw before?</br></br></br></br></br>  This show is dumb.  <br> Also why would soldiers be intimidated by a woman they never saw before? <br>Because she just stabbed that dude in the fucking neck. Is it that hard to understand?</br></br>    <br> Also why would soldiers be intimidated by a woman they never saw before? <br>It's obvious you read the manga so I don't even know how you didn't notice how shocked they were when they were told these guys were from the jayesdeef.</br></br>  <br>You seem to have ignored the most important point. I'll quote it so you can read it again.<br> learn to ignore petty details like that, it's a fucking anime and her specialization is CQC </br></br>  <br>I want to know the original ending.</br>  <br> WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED? <br>Is a miracle.<br><br>The manga art was so shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because she just stabbed that dude in the fucking neck. Is it that hard to understand? <br><br>You think soldiers in a medieval army get intimidated when someone on their side gets stabbed? Seriously? What the fuck do you think these people were doing in the battlefield?<br><br><br> they were told these guys were from the jayesdeef <br>The enemy at Itarica didn't know shit about who these guys were<br><br><br> learn to ignore petty details like that, it's a fucking anime and her specialization is CQC <br>Just say it's anime bro. You can leave out the lolrandom extra reasons as if you know wth you're talking about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and a :^) for you</br>  <br>Shit tastes abound.</br>    <br>I'm sure even a veteran from Irag must be very surprised when a dude next to him suddenly gets shot from nowhere. You know what I'm talking about</br>  <br>they improved her obviously</br>  <br>They're not americans in Iraq fighting a long range war where you cover in a ditch all day and losing someone is somewhat rare. It's a fucking medieval army storming city walls. A shitload of people getting stabbed and maimed all over the place is the norm.</br>    oops, wrong post<br><br>see<br/></br></br>  <br>Now imagine you were in Iraq and only had swords and shields then the first woman you've ever seen on a battlefield kills your comrades extremely effectively.</br>  What would the  Paizuri  feel like?    <br> The enemy at Itarica didn't know shit about who these guys were <br>The scene at the capital is months later than Italica.</br></br>  <br> The scene at the capital is months later than Italica. <br><br>Yes, dude, we know, she was also being a melee badass at Italika, keep up</br></br></br>  <br>ANIME IS DEAD BABY</br>  <br>Artistic liberties ruining things again.</br>  <br>Maybe this series would've been better as some violent 80s ova.</br>  <br>you realize this now? The nips could have had their nippon bonzai and titties and we could have had our gore /k/ and titties<br>Everyone would have been happy</br></br>  Stupid bitch had to be blinded by hate when she could've had a happy ending with him.<br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br>This makes me very very sad.</br>  <br>Is that Tomita?</br>  <br>No  it's the chef guy.

Try reading Drifters instead if you want a decent "eras collide" scenario.</br>   Post yfw when the ''WOAH, WOAH, WOAH, WOAH'' part starts playing in the OP   <br>Oh, I heard of that. Isn't it by the same guy who did Hellsing.</br>  <br>Someone post that Shirobako image about manga vs anime changes.</br>  <br>And it's better than Hellsing.</br>  <br>Yea it's pretty good.</br>   apologizing before cutting into elf's shirt <br><br>ARE THE JPS REALLY THIS POLITE<br><br>IT'S LIFE OR DEATH<br><br>JUST DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO SAVE HER LIFE<br><br>GOD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I should stop being lazy and check it out.</br></br>  <br>I don't have the original but this is fine.</br>  <br>I am empty.</br>  <br>this can't be real</br>  <br>Shino-san!</br>  <br>Which scans are the best for Drifters?</br>  This is the future you chose weeb shits.

Why? Because a pleb with a spear can kill a knight before the knight can reach him. Even better if the knight is mounted.<br>The same shit goes into modern physical combat. reach = advantage.<br><br>so its bullshit, but not bullshit because "muh training" or "bayonet is useless afterthought lmao."<br>It's bullshit because of the number of people more than any other reason, shields being a close second.<br><br>/k/ out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is this neo-/a/  <br>Welcome to Hell</br>  <br> apologizing before cutting into elf's shirt <br>I didn't have a problem with that.

The contrast between being a military officer and an otaku is just so random! That's a very clever joke if I do say so myself. I just love the juxtaposition of Itami being conflicted with doing the correct thing for SDF, and revealing his otaku power level (his favorite is Gothic lolis which are irresistible to him). God I love this anime, haha. Can't get enough!  <br>What a fantastic asshole.</br>  <br><br><br>Die</br></br></br>  <br>Man you're post is so witty and funny haha! <br> kill yourself. </br></br>  <br>Chen pls  stay </br>  <br> mad because they're right </br>  <br>I know this is easy shitposting for you but let's be perfectly honest.

A spear extends much further. Holy shit, just google some images and compare lengths.<br><br>As far as the manga goes look at the top left panel of  and see how much her weapon extends beyond her hand in comparison to the guy's sword. And that's just a fucking sword.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/c<wbr>ontrast%20military%20officer%20otak<wbr>u/</wbr></wbr></br>  What a disservice I was doing myself by not reading this sooner.  <br>The fuck is with this typesetting?

Also, she acts the same in both the manga and the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Her intro was top notch <br>no it wasn't</br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, she could've just asked the JSDF to help her, and everything would've gone fucking smoothly.<br>The power of love wasn't enough. ;_;</br></br></br>    <br> The power of love wasn't enough. ;_; <br><br>Her love wasn't as strong as her rage.<br><br>Love always wins, just not if you don't believe in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Her intro was top notch <br>Prop ax that only cuts one thing, and acts like a blunt bat against everything else.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>This kind of shit just breaks my heart.</br></br></br></br>  <br> she acts the same in both the manga and the anime <br><br>This. She has the same bemused observer attitude so far</br></br></br>  <br>Is that and answer to something?</br>  <br>Let has character and isn't a pitiful moeblob</br>  <br>Wait a fucking second<br>That's her? I didn't even realize it. I thought it was some character i forgot about</br></br>  <br>I find it funny that the unit chose Rory as their badge mascot.</br>  <br>Another /a/non's day ruined. Our work here is done.</br>  <br>Those are thing judged by how she acts, not how she looks, and so far her attitude is spot on.</br>  <br>MC gets no one? That's depressing.</br>  <br><br>What happened to them, anon? I'm a filthy manga reader, I need to know.</br></br>  <br>It looks like an Italica (or Itarica or however the fuck the elevens pronounce it) specific badge. Kinda makes sense they'd be helicopters and Rory on it</br>  <br>Don't forget  bunny girls never find out she wasn't a traitor .</br>  I just finished Love Lab for the second.<br><br>Twice disappointed. It's cute and funny but damn, they should've just hooked up. There were signs the whole time.</br></br>  Seriously, Love Lab sounds like some crazy name for a laboratory where qt anime girls are subjected to rigorous experiments that put their libido to the test  <br><br>That's not too far from the premise of the show, actually.</br></br>  <br>Another butthurt yurifag who can't understand the existance of female friendship.<br>The premise of the show was about getting a boyfriend for fucks sake.</br></br>  Surely we'll get another manga chapter soon.<br><br>Any day now. Any day. I can wait for it. It's just 12-16 pages of cute stuff. Not as if the next chapter will be any different from the others.<br><br> Please Habanero. Please. I need it </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder who's behind this post.<br><br><br> 12-16 pages <br>You mean 8 pages? The next chapter is being edited, it'll probably be released around next week.<br><br>I'll also begin a marathon of the remainder of Volume 6 up to Volume 8 once I clear my backlog, which will probably be next weekend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But the translation isn't what's slowing the releases, right? I remember even back with the /a/ group you were ahead of what was released. <br><br>Glad to hear it's still being worked on though. I don't mind these bimonthly releases as long as it doesn't die for good.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting a yuri ending when there wasn't one <br> posting on /a/ <br>Damn I agree with you, but you just summoned the asspain of 1000 weebs. Nothing gets /a/ going like non-canonical yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't there be one show with an all girl ensemble where there isn't implied yuri?<br><br>Can't we have one show free of /u/s bullshit?</br></br></br>  <br>You can't honestly expect yuri fans to stay away from a show with an ll- or mostly-female cast.</br>  <br> But I'm a lesbian and this show isn't far off from how closeted gay girls act with eachother before coming out. This show is unrelenting yurifag bait and you know it. <br><br> inb4<br> blogging <br> 3DPD <br> comparing 3DPD to superior 2D <br> but we're all little girls </br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br> lying on the internet <br>Who would do that?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I'm gonna have to agree here. There are a lot of shows where people just have their yuri goggles set on max, but I was legitimately surprised Love Lab didn't have a yuri ending because Riko and Maki were gay as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Not me, anon.</br>  <br> "help me learn how to get a boyfriend" <br> "okay" <br>Super gay, alright. You're retarded. You're also probably one of the people who ruined Love Live threads with your /u/ shitposting<br>Go back to your goddamn containment board</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ruining Raibu with /u/ <br>But it is already a yuri, anon.</br></br>  <br> &gt;"help me learn how to get a boyfriend" <br> &gt;"okay" <br><br>And yet, neither of them got boyfriends.  It's like they aren't even trying. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Love Live IS yuri you dumbfuck<br><br>this is from the manga</br></br></br>  <br> manga nobody cares about. <br><br>It's the anime that sells the series.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> baiting this much <br> girls cant have friends </br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, they really can't. Women can't stand one another, and only the gay ones want to be around them. <br><br>Another reason traps are so superior, they aren't women.</br></br></br>  S2 where they get boyfriends when?  <br> it's only yuri if the characters literally say "I'm gay and like you as more than a friend" <br>Of course girls can have friends. They can also be gay.</br></br>  <br>It's like you never even watched the second season.<br><br><br> Girls can't be gay </br></br></br></br>  <br> baiting this hard. </br>  <br><br>Two women can be friends the same way a guy and a girl can be friends. Sure it might work out for awhile, but eventually, someone will want to rub their genitalia with the other's.</br></br>      <br>That shit isn't over yet.

In a market saturated with waifu-bait and moepandering garbage, It's rare to<br> come across a title which doesn't reek of banal archetypes and generic settings. Ever since the finale of Bleach I've been searching for a show to<br> fill the void and re-immerse me in world filled with unique characters and relentless yet well thought out plot containing deep philosophical themes. I have come here to tell you that this anime is not my savior that i have been searching for. You see, I used to spend all my<br> days as a NEET watching anime, it was a truly splendid lifestyle until one day i returned to my village after visiting Comiket to find that my <br>entire family had been murdered by muslims. Ever since that day I cursed myself for being a tasteless weeaboo, if i'd practised sport instead<br> of wasting my life I might have been able to fight off the muslim invaders. Im warning you all before its too late, anime is worthless. Stop <br>watching it. You might think that its impossible, that it wont happen to you but honestly I thought the same, I would have never have anticipated <br>the tragedy which befell my family because of my avid weaboo antics. It could happen to you too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which episode this will happen?

I didn't even find out they were added censors until people started to complain about them.<br><br>Shitty translations are inexcusable though.</br></br></br>  <br>How so?</br>  The ED to this show is one of my favorites. Why is this show so based?<br><br><br>Do *you* care about Japan's crippling birth rate right now?<br><br>Sovereign nations don't give a fuck about Sovereign nations except for their trade, weapons, technology, and immigration.

If Japan was an orwellian nightmare, that's what you'd say too. I'm not saying "Save the Japs" I'm just trying to convey what people in other nations would feel about Japan being like this.

Warrod retires.<br><br>So Mavis was officially 24 when she died/was turned into Lumen Histoire, whatever. Yuri got married when he was 23, Makarov was born 6 years later when he was 29, and he died at age 33 when Makarov was 4 years old. </br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>   Gray and Natsu back to normal clothes <br> girls still in swimsuits <br>Das sexist<br><br>...N-No more Angel?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats the scratched out part on 697? Mavis' cause of death?</br>  <br>Yeah. According to the translations floating around, the part that explains what happened to Mavis is scratched out, and the part right after the scratched out part is just about her grave being built on Tenrou Island.</br>  <br> Mavis was officially 24 when she died/was turned into Lumen Histoire, whatever <br>Does this mean I can safely fap to Mavis without feeling like a pedophile?</br></br>  <br> I'd pound her while she's helpless, if you know what I mean. <br><br>pls explain</br></br></br>  <br>You can fap to anyone you want without feeling like a pedophile if that is what floats your boat.</br>  <br>I suppose. She's definitely an adult. She basically just stunted her growth when she was 13. Leaving her short, with small breasts.</br>  <br>The I'm fighting for a evil but necessary cause but isn't all that evil after all</br>   Spriggan <br>I had forgotten that some of these names actually mean something.<br><br><br>I hoped at least he wouldn't die here. I hate when they do that, when a character goes missing, then they find him dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it. Mashima's fanservice doesn't really run towards panty shots. Hence skirts conveniently covering between the legs like this. Though I think the most notable was back during the Kain fight where Lucy's skirt defied gravity to keep her covered up.</br>  On another note, volume 50 is out, so art from that is starting to surface.  <br>Well...</br>  <br>Doesn't he love humans despite saying that, also the main reason why he created all those demons is to kill himself.</br>  Where is team B ? I want the funny dorks not the edgy coolkids.  <br>Dat Porlyusca.<br><br>Also,link to the vol 50 chibis that previous thread's faggot  totallynotme  forgot to post.<br><br>http://lucy-heartflawless.tumblr.co<wbr>m/post/124338415707/for-the-launch-<wbr>of-volume-50-of-the-manga-mashima<br><br>http://lucy-heartflawless.tumblr.co<wbr>m/post/124340078767/50-cards-made-f<wbr>or-hiro-mashima-first-25<br><br><br>Based FT team censoring.Better than light beams.DARKNESS is superior after all.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So lewd.</br>  <br>No, by his conversation with Mavis, most humans piss him off.</br>  Nanatsu no Taizai when?  <br> image <br><br>Something something Gumball.</br></br></br>  <br>Having to deal with human stupidity all those centuries, it's no wonder he thinks that</br>  <br>more like Fairy YEAAARRT amirite</br>  Is Zeref actually Gerard? I'm having trouble following why this nigga keeps showing up everywhere.  These last chapters are really looking like the end of Fairy Tail.  <br>And nothing of value will have been lost.</br>  <br> Zeref's army is defeated in this new kingdom <br> Oops sorry Zeref is in another castle <br> Fairy Tail goes to fight him in the next kingdom over <br> Repeat forever </br></br></br></br>  How can a Loli have such wide hips? My dick.  <br><br> Yep and again hiro fails to kill off makarov <br>Makarov will only die for real if Mashima has the balls to perma kill Jellal as well, but we all know that ain't happening. So I wouldn't get your hopes up in expecting the old man to even be dead when the end of series epilogue comes around.</br></br></br>  <br>Mavis is such a semen demon</br>  <br>Why couldn't they?<br>Are you discriminating against lolis on what they can have?</br></br>  <br>Nah. Makarov is an old man. Mashima can kill him off anytime.</br>  Is there an end in sight with this shit?<br>I really thought it was comming in the last arc when the dragons were kill, but no..<br>Do anyone here predict this will be the final arc before E.N.D and Zerefs death?<br>I dont dare do that anymore.<br>Shits gonna go for another 5 years, atleast.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It ends if the readers don't read it anymore.</br>  <br>Zeref was always hinted at to be the end (no pun intended) boss of this. The last chapter makes it sound like after the Spriggan arc there'll be an Acnologia war arc. That... should be it.<br><br>I cannot think of anything else that would happen after that. Except maybe Lector being killed by Grey and the secret 10 year mission that Gildartz was away on during the beginning of the series.</br></br></br>  This is probably the worst written arc of all of Fairy Tail, and considering Mashima's writing history that's a fucking accomplishment.<br><br> Lucy is pissed at Natsu for leaving, which could actually lead to some development between the two, yet it's ignored once FT gets back together <br> Juvia instantly forgives Grey for leaving her <br> Aquarius' broken key has yet to be mentioned once, which is pretty significant considering it's been mentioned multiple times that SOMETHING happens when all 12 keys get together <br> One year timeskip, Lucy gets new ability and is STILL the weakest of the group <br> A God is introduced and one-shotted <br> Explanation for why Ishgar has doomsday weapons, which could lead to some interesting worldbuilding, but it's actually just Zeref's country <br> Despite dragons showing up, still no implications as to wtf Layla had to do with them <br> Zeref's curse explained, which could involve the Gods and lead to more arcs involving them, yet primarily ignored for this three-way battle about to happen <br> Everything is rushed- they make it to the capitol of this supposedly menacing country without any problem <br><br>There's still a shit-ton of loose ends and I have the feeling they're gonna stay unexplained for the whole "muh Natsu vs Zeref vs Acnologia" battle, which should be the finale after the loose ends are tied up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Lector beeing killed by Grey has already been prevented now, hasnt it, so whats there to explore there?<br>Gildartz was probably hunting down Acnologia or some shit like that, which should only be some flashback chapters at best.</br></br>  <br>fuck off to a forum, cancer</br>  <br> Everything is rushed- they make it to the capitol of this supposedly menacing country without any problem <br>I'm not saying you're wrong, but do we REALLY want another infiltration arc? The Edolas arc was the worst arc of the series by far.<br><br><br>Yeah, sorry, my bad. You're right on both accounts. I guess that's it then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Juvia instantly forgives Grey for leaving her <br><br><br>Batter housewife syndrome is good writing though<br><br> One year timeskip, Lucy gets new ability and is STILL the weakest of the group <br>Well did you expect her to get strong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While it was nice of that person to post them, they apparently didn't manage to find the best quality ones currently available.</br>  <br><br>Sadly Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Erza, Wendy, Charle, Gajeel, and Pantherlily aren't available in much better quality than they posted. <br><br>Fortunately the rest are available in somewhat better quality, courtesy of some Chinese fan.</br></br></br></br>    Post Fairy Plot with a side serving of fairy feet.            <br> that heart shaped exposure <br>3lewd5me</br></br>            <br> new name  <br>Another name we can give is Dues Ex Machina.</br></br>                              <br>I don't know how Lucy could be that mad at Natsu when the guild was disbanded a day later and everyone else left anyway. I also didn't expect Juvia to stay mad at Gray but she should have been more involve at least, when she came back.</br>                                <br>My little villain can't be this cute!<br><br> I also have hard time remembering some of these characters, some I can't recognize at all. Is my memory just shit or is FT cast so forgettable? </br></br></br>    <br>Gray + clothes?<br><br>Have ever even read this manga before?</br></br></br>  <br>Goddamit, how can a single girl be so best?</br>    <br>wow lucy is such a fucking demon look at that body</br>    <br>Hairy Fart.</br>  <br>She's a whore, just like her VA.</br>    <br> Makarov is an old man. Mashima can kill him off anytime. <br>Like I said, I'll only believe it when Mashima perma kills some other character who's death would cause an impact like Jellal or even Gildartz as well.<br><br> I cannot think of anything else that would happen after that <br>Mashima named dropped that God who cursed Zeref again this chapter. So I'm thinking he's planning on making that God the Final Villain and will redeem Zeref during this arc or the next. Well, that is, unless Mashima uses Zeref to kill a big name character for real this time then he'll probably be killed or maybe die protecting Natsu.</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>And this is the last one.</br>  <br> Defending FT <br> Calling other people cancer </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Fuck! I can't get into chibified art because if these were in normal style, I'd be set for awhile.<br><br>Almost that Mashima accidentally drew Natsu with Blue hair for a second.<br><br>I guess Mard does give off a laid-back feel enough to make him some rich guy who likes to vacation in the tropics.<br><br>This almost feels like foreshadowing for what could happen to Sorano this arc since she, Jellal and Crime Sorcerie will try to kill Zeref themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't worry about it being foreshadowing. <br><br>Yukino's cosplaying a nurse <br>Sorano's cosplay a patient <br><br>That's likely all there is to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess this fanservice will have to do. Hope for more Lucy and Angel next week.</br>  <br>End villain will be the god that cursed zeref.</br>  <br>Where do I get the collection for all these.</br>  <br>Well, you could say, that even Yukino being a nurse is just as suspect. I mean it'd kinda make sense for her to help care for her sister after such an event happened.<br><br>But yeah you're probably right and that Mashima just felt like drawing them with that theme.</br></br></br>  <br>Which will be the Edolas version of Zeref's brother.</br>  <br>For making babies.</br>  <br>I hope this semen demon returns.<br><br>Chances on her brother not being dead and or being revived to mindfuck her and Erza, Jellal?<br><br>There is also that card and block guy from tower of heaven arc. The block guy is that one dudes brother from oracion seis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Natsu is just some shitty car driver in Edolas.</br>  <br> Lorg <br>???</br></br>  <br>Must be horrible Engrish. It's different from the name Gajeel knew him as too.</br>  <br>Lorg is really cute.</br>  <br>It makes for good pacing, at least.</br>  <br>On Simon not being dead? Pretty much zero. Mashima's reluctant to kill off characters in Fairy Tail, but not that reluctant, and there's fair too much drama attached to it now, plus too much time has passed for it to possibly be executed well. <br><br>Chances on him being revived to screw with people's minds? Also pretty much zero. Mashima hates the idea of genuinely resurrecting characters. That's why we get stuff like Lisanna's death being retconned. It's why we get so many unconfirmed villain deaths, he's leaving just enough wiggle room to bring them back later if he really wants to do so. That's why Silver was some kind of undead. <br><br>Plus Simon's body should have been destroyed along with the tower. Which really limits the ways he could come back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forget that Zeref will just use edo tensei.</br>  <br>There does not seem to have been double checking for what the official english names are there. It's not a problem for most of them, as the names are fairly well standardized, if different in a couple cases from what the fan translations prefer. But that leaves a few with like Charle being the original Charles, and Rogue apparently had someone try to romanize his name at some point at Lorg. I'm guessing a native English speaker had a word with someone fairly early on about that one, but the weird romanization was left to float around and crop up here.</br>  <br> Edo tensei <br> ressurects madara <br> Natsu vs Madara <br><br>damn that wuld be amazing lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>even though you got the devil´s trips, you´re wrong<br><br>They invaded the country with a fucking stone ruin submarine</br></br></br>  <br>Lucy is really such a dirty slut.. she is always wearing tiny Mini Skirts</br>  <br>Lucy is just there for fanservice and nakama bullshit</br>  <br>Juvia...Does things to me.</br>  <br>Best girl forever and ever</br>  Whats up with zeref's obsessive incestive homolust for Natsu?  <br> ajeel <br><br>Gajeels father detected</br></br></br>  Finally this really is the final arc.<br><br>Soon Acnologia will be defeated</br></br>  <br>Implying</br>  <br>I don't think they're specifically collected anywhere. The artbook collected a few of them on a couple pages, but in general, the cover flap images are just kind of floating around.</br>    <br>The guy created Natsu so that he can kill himself.<br>Dude is just too powerful to end is own life.</br></br>  So when the book of E.N.D is opened, will Natsu go full edge mode or will he be his same usual self with god powers?  <br>Full edge mode probably. Seeing as END is supposed to be different than Natsu.</br>  <br>Do these only appear in the Japanese editions?</br>  <br>I'd have to double check, but I think so. The US release simply doesn't have the same cover flap. Publishes tend to slip when in comes to moving the contents of the flap elsewhere. Even if they do move it to a page, it wouldn't be in color.</br>  <br>He didn't create Natsu. Zeref Dragneel brought his little brother back to life.</br>  <br>I need to start buying the Japanese editions then. Do the ones on Amazon have them?</br>  Fairy Tail Zero 13 is out.  <br>Natsu has come and so has Zeref</br>  FUCKING WEEBS  everyone seems pretty OP right now    Forgive my bad English<br><br>I have a theory, i not know whether someone has posted something similar.<br><br>Is it possible that the spirit of Mavis is actually Zera? yes, it sounds somewhat stilted but if you think on it, this is not so crazy. The spirit of Mavis and Zera can only be seen by certain people, also they can interact with people that can see them. Natsu and the others questioned the identity of the spirit of Mavis after seeing Lumen. The end of FT Zero shows that Zera somehow is still there so it is not unreasonable to think that will have any role (besides I doubt Mashima's only put her for the drama and the loli yuri fanservice).<br><br>With this, the scene in which the spirit of Mavis tells Laxus that Lumen Historie is the light of Fairy Tail could have meant that Mavis is Fairy Tail Light not Lumen.<br><br>What do you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The homolust is strong</br>  <br>I liked seeing Mest shit himself when he saw Zeref</br>   This battle is going to be an anime reenactment of "Luke I am your father" except replace father with brother   <br>SLUUUUUT<br><br><br><br>Wat<br><br><br>I believe they're on the back flap, but the US volumes don't have an outer cover with flaps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> FT Zero over <br> Ice Trail over <br>Awww. I guess FT Mag as a whole is over. Does this mean Fairy Girls is over too? We're still missing several chapters of that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>tfw Natsu will instakill Perfect Susanoo</br>  <br>I think those aren't in FT Magazine.Apparently Blue Mistral will be getting an english release on August.<br><br>I wonder what the Ezel fight will be like.More lewd black panties?Comedic filler?Dried plums?<br><br>Actual canon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This looks creepy as fuck.</br>      why didn't gray fuck Juvia once when they were living together?<br><br>Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>he's gay anon, it's a proven fact</br>  <br>Grey is going to destroy E.N.D., Natsu is Etherias Natsu Dragneel. If the book is destroyed Natsu is too.</br>  <br> Grey is going to destroy E.N.D., Natsu is Etherias Natsu Dragneel. <br>You sound like a fucking retard as of right now Gray's whole revenge plot point will be forgotten just like most of the plot in FT in favor for Natsu vs Zeref vs Acno.</br></br>  Since the spinoff series have ended, will it be possible that the anime staff will adapt Zero at some point? Like maybe when they reach the timeskip after the Tartaros arc to help gain more buffer time, and it being a good point to take a break from the present story to tell a story that takes place long period of time before.  <br> muh pure shonen protags <br><br>No excuse for him and Gajeel to have not gone balls deep in their chicks over the skip.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All of the Japanese editions should have cover flaps. Regardless of where they're sold. It's a difference in design between Japanese manga, and US manga. The Japanese editions come with a dust cover, meaning that when fully scanned, the cover looks like this. Checking the raws I have, it looks like with volume 13, they started putting a panel of character art on the back cover flap. Star Dress Lucy being the latest example, and  and  being other past examples. <br><br>The official US English release of Fairy Tail, and pretty much all other manga, doesn't have a dust cover. The cover is an integrated part of the book like regular US paper back releases. Meaning there's no dust cover to put the art on. The bit from the author they'll usually put on a page in black and white, but after checking, they don't seem to bother for the character art. <br><br>Not sure it's worth buying the Japanese editions just for that, but tl;dr: yes it's in the Japanese edition starting with volume 13. No it's not in the US edition. Yes the Japanese edition on Amazon should have them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gray fucking anyone except Natsu <br><br>Thanks for paying attention.</br></br></br>  <br>Ever heard the expression "Don't stick your dick in crazy"? Gray has. He's trying to follow it's advice. He's slowly losing, but he's trying.</br>  So, pic related controlled the spells in Greed Island, could make 14 fighters from his aura while remaining stronger than Hisoka and made Phinks and the Genei Ryodan think twice before fighting him. Just how fucking strong is he? Will we get more of him later?  He's extremely strong, but I'm more concerned about getting more of any character than one in particular. Isn't he stuck on Greed Island anyway?  <br>Gon</br>  He's strong, but he could be getting a boost of power with a restriction like never being able to leave Greed Island ever.   will we get more <br> hxh <br> more </br></br>  <br>Was it ever specified if he was stuck there? Hard to believe Ging would do that considering Razor told Gon he was friends with his father.</br>  Didnt the power rankings rate him a bit lower than most of the spider members? He's not THAT strong, and would have been totally fucked without the spell cards against the spiders.  <br>A shit</br>   no actual Greed Island game has been released yet <br><br>fucking technology.</br></br>  <br>This , he's strong , but i think that phinks , feitan , machi , sharnalk and nobu are stronger than him .</br>  <br>Just checked. Actually, the ranking lists him on par with Hisoka at 24 points total, with Chrollo at 25.</br>  <br>Still would have been dead meat against all the spiders at once, obviously. Though i guess that isn't necessarily how they do things in the troupe.</br>  Who would win in an arm wrestling fight; Gon-san, Uvogin, or Razor?  <br>Gon-san &gt; Razor &gt; Uvogin</br>  <br>Gon-san clearly. He's the second most powerful character in the whole series.<br><br>Wait, which arm?</br></br></br>    <br>Gon-san could probably grab his cut-off arm, arm wrestle with it and still win.</br>  <br>Uvogin is most stronger than razor , he takes a bullet with his teeth , and tank a bazooka shoot , he can kill a human with his scream , he's literally a beast .</br>  <br>This is true, surprisingly. Pitou said Gon was at the same level as the King when he transformed, and Meruem was officially listed as being off the charts in the power rankings.<br><br>Razor was one point below Netero, the strongest on the list, on every trait.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Where the fuck is my Action RPG for the 3DS?</br>  <br>Power levels in hxh are particularly convoluted though. A character could be the same "stats" as netero and still be complete and utter trash compared to him, or even a lower powered character.</br>  I think the whole island is probably one big nen amplifying circle, similar to what that boxer prisoner was using to win his matches. I dont think her would be able to use spell cards outside the island but while on the island its like he is a god with those cards which is prob why the spiders thought twice.  <br>Yep. Plus, considering the battles are mostly based on strategy, there's even more room for error.</br>  Does Pitou have a penis?<br>Does Alluka have a penis?<br>Why does Kalluto look and dress like a girl?</br></br>  <br>fuck off killua</br>  <br>Do the Chimera ants even have genetalia, I mean the queen certainly should have a big, fat vagina, but breeding is not supposed to be a function for other ants, so that could mean that they don't have the parts.</br>  <br> Chimera ants <br>Yes, it's stated that after the queen dies they will all go out and try to mate with females.</br></br>  <br>Soldier ants were said to be able to breed though, as well as the King. Who knows whether or not this applies to the royal guard, but I just wanna know if it's right for me to be fapping to all the art that depicts Pitou as having a vagina.</br>  <br>Why does this have to happen in every thread?</br>  <br><br>But what will their penises look like?<br>Will cheetah man get a cheetah dick? Will Yuppie get a horse dick? What about pouf? So many unsolved mysteries.</br></br></br>  <br>Furries please go</br>  <br>Youpi could morph his dick into anything</br>  <br>Cheetu would have a barbed penis. Pouf would have a feminine penis.</br>  <br>Jesus I don't care if this thread gets deleted anymore</br>  Chimera Ant Arc is truly the pinnacle saga that all anime, not just shonen arcs strive to be. Not only is the story telling prodigious, the pacing and character development is top notch. The level of depth that Togashi created is on another level. The exquisite and subtle use of narration at only times of importance delivers an amazing story telling experience.Of the various themes present in this work, his theme of ethics and value theory incorporated with various interactions between the characters appeal to logos, ethos and pathos, and this amalgamation of techniques once again prove his acuity and status as the smartest and wisest writer ever. His profound messages regarding anthropology and the juxtaposition of insects and animals with introspection as a species delivers an amazing tale of tragedy and loss. The fact that he delves into the more psychological aspects of human nature,morality, structuralism, existentialism, meta cognition and phenomenology show that he is the Shakespeare of writing and that he truly understands philosophy, proving that this epic is the most intelligent tale ever crafted. Togashi demonstrates his ken of the human race as a hole through the Chimera Ant Arc, his magnum opus.  Post your favorite volume cover.  Nice , Pitofags and their masturbation problem ruin the thread , again .  <br>Jing, pls. I'm just asking the hard questions. Questions like, "how do I become a good father?"</br>    <br> while remaining stronger than Hisoka and made Phinks and the Genei Ryodan think twice before fighting him <br><br>did we even watch the same show? 8^) <br><br>hisoka could kill him easily and the phantom troupe would have killed him as well but razor told them to beat him by the games rules and banished them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Post your favorite volume cover. </br>  <br> Chimera Ant Arc <br> the pacing is top notch </br></br>  <br>Pitoufags aren't the ones starting the shitposts, obviously.</br>    <br> subtle use of narration  <br>heh</br></br>  <br>No she fucking didn't, she said his capabilities (fangs) would finally be able to reach the king. <br><br>gon was never as strong as meruem, he just had the ability to harm him. Meruem was still leagues smarter and tougher.</br></br></br>  pitou is a boy  <br> she </br>  <br> she </br>    <br><br>I am a boy, therefore I am Pitou.</br></br>  <br>Yorknew is way better than Chimera Ant arc. I don't like how in the Chimera Ant arc everything is so stacked against the humans. Meurem and Youpi were unbeatable if not for radiation poisoning. Even though Pouf succumbed to it too, someone like Killua could have defeated him easily if he didn't keep running away. Pitou was probably just as strong too but didn't get destroyed by a raging Gon whose power put him in critical condition. The overpoweredness of the Chimera Ants just makes the arc boring. It's also annoying how they try to make you feel sympathy for the ants as well when there is no reason to feel bad for any of them aside from the ones who realized they messed up and became good guys. Even though the Phantom Troupe is strong the protagonists are still able to give them a run for their money due to well thought out strategies. The troupe members are much more relate-able than the ants too and have more unique powers instead of just being strong. Pouf's power was cool but he has no combat abilities.</br>  <br> Greed Island <br>Everything is basically virtual.<br><br>That other Guy prevents physical bodies from reaching the island.</br></br></br></br>  People often complain about the pacing of the CA arc, but aren't they just talking about the anime? I recently reread it and there was no chapter that felt slow, except for obvious build-up ones before certain climaxes.<br><br><br> someone like Killua could have defeated him easily if he didn't keep running away. <br>Are you talking about the clone Killua fought? He was much weaker than Pouf, it was 1/7th of his cells.<br> The overpoweredness of the Chimera Ants just makes the arc boring. <br>Isn't that contradictory? The fact that every hunter was so outclassed during the invasion was what made it feel intense.<br> It's also annoying how they try to make you feel sympathy for the ants as well when there is no reason to feel bad for any of them and became good guys <br>There are tons of reasons to feel bad for them, just like there are no real good guys in that arc.The RG and Meruem all had tragic deaths in different ways. Also, by your logic, you have no reason to emphatize with the Troupe either since none of them got redemption. <br> Even though the Phantom Troupe is strong the protagonists are still able to give them a run for their money due to well thought out strategies. <br>Only Kurapika, it was made clear that Gon and Kil had no chance against them. The strategy part also applies to CA, look at how Morel beat Cheetu/Leol or Shoot managed to keep Yupi busy. Strategy and psychological states are important in nearly every HxH fight.<br> The troupe members are much more relate-able than the ants <br>That's highly subjective. I could not relate to some Ryodan members at all except for a handful, but could perfectly understand how the RG had conflicting morals and instincts.<br> more unique powers instead of just being strong. Pouf's power was cool but he has no combat abilities. <br>Are you saying you wanted more balanced fights? There were a lot of these before the invasion.<br><br>There's no point in comparing it to Yorkshin because they're so different. The hate on this arc is so ridiculous sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> power rankings <br>I don't think these are very reliable, Komugi is stronger than Zushi according to them.</br></br>  <br> best boy <br> shit </br></br>  <br>The stats rank more than just physical strength, yknow</br>  <br>Hisoka needed Gon and Killua just to catch the ball. Razor would have blew him up.<br><br>The Phantom would obviously win, he was outnumbered.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not my point. He was still incredibly strong.</br>  <br>No he never did say that.<br><br>Why are wankers always wanking?</br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>She at least said something along those lines, my memory isn't perfect. But that's not the point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. He was hellish strong, but he wasn't on Meruem's level. <br><br>And that was pre-rose Meruem. <br><br>The king is just too much, he can solo everyone together unless they pack bombs(which won't work in his after-rose form either since he's 10 times stronger and faster)</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>ow</br>  Is there a limit to what Killua can command Nanika to do? If not, doesn't that make him the strongest character in the series?  <br>Definitely this, it's beautiful. I'll post my own scan too because it's a bit bigger.</br>  <br>Why hasn't Pika gone through puberty?</br>  <br> That slight hint of nipple </br>   Gotoh <br> Squala <br> Kite <br> Pokkle <br><br> all nice guys <br> all died because of something related to their head <br>Leorio, Morel, Mizai and that guy from Beyond's group are next, i'm calling it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotoh's death was more the neck than the head, it's not like he got his head cut off or anything, just his throat slit.</br>  <br>You didn't actually read this did you?</br>  <br><br><br>Seeing as how at least one of them, Zazan, aspired to become a new queen I would wager that they could undergo a sort of protandry if ants of that class were all born with dicks.</br></br></br>    <br>it's obviously a generalization, not all ants are male. Kite alone proves this.</br>  <br>I don't reallg like any. Togashi is shit at coloring.</br>  <br>Pitou-chan kawaii</br>  <br>Under extremely specific conditions related to the island, so I'd guess he's about the strength of an experienced hunter, just with a big boost while in-game.</br>  <br>Ging had to be the one to capture him and there is nothing to make us think that being on the island makes him stronger somehow.<br>He is just ridiculously strong.</br></br>  <br>Just throwing the ball back at razor broke his fingers. By the time the game ended all of the bones in Hisoka's hands were broken.</br>  <br>Shalnark a cute.</br>  <br><br>Normally the villain character who smiles and acts all nice is the most evil one, why is Shalnark just a genuinely nice guy? He's like the mormon of the Troupe.</br></br>  <br>Shalnark isn't all that nice, but he isn't mean either.<br>He does smile when he kills people though. Not the best sign.</br></br>  <br> The Phantom would obviously win, he was outnumbered. <br><br>phantom troupe only fights one on ones, i'm guessing we really didnt watch the same show.</br></br></br>  <br>From what I remember he's usually the one who's all<br> hey come on guys, let's not fight here, let's just flip a coin! <br>Seems to me like he is pretty chill, but maybe he just seems that way next to the rest of the Troupe.</br></br></br>  <br>IIRC it's because he cares about the Troupe as a whole rather than the individuals.<br>He probably cares about a few of them, though.  Like Uvo. <br>But he's no Feitan. Shalnark is a saint compared to him.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder who would win out, if one of the high tier Zoldycks like Silva was tortured by Feitan. He always complains that he was "just getting started" when he tortures someone, so I wonder if that could hold up against a true pro.</br>  <br>Who knows. However, his Rising Sun seemed like torture because of the slow but strong flames.<br>If Silva had done minimal damage to him, I'm sure he could succeed in torturing him because of that.</br></br>  Reminder that Phynkss is best spider  Yuyuyu thread  Daily reminder that there are no heroes left in man  What's going on here?

Arguing about whether or not Tougou did something wrong distracts from arguing whether or not Hibiki is doing anything wrong.<br><br>Also, why do our fanbases overlap so much? I don't see other magical girl series come up so much in those threads, other than Nanoha, of course. Is it punching? Is it being really gay?</br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear threads for Symphogear, Madoka threads for Madoka, YuYuYu threads for everyone?<br>Anti-general is another world for anti-YuYuYu</br></br>    <br>Bad art time?</br>  <br>A bit of both.<br><br> Mostly the gay .</br></br></br>    I like how these two always look at each other in these arts.  <br> how do two girls have sex </br>  <br> the sheet folds makes heart <br>Degeneracy at its finest.</br></br>  <br>Damn, their official arts just keep getting gayer and gayer.</br>  I want to ____ ____'s _____s  <br>We're all just waiting for Wakaba. I think we're pretty much tread all the possible ground as far as theories about how it'll connect to the rest of the series go.</br>  I still have this in my backlog, will probably start watching it tomorrow after i finish of the Garo anime.  ded thred<br>just like Gin</br>  <br>SAY NO 2 B8.

Didn't somone translate the first couple pages?  <br> Implying </br>  <br>In a fight to the death the yuushas literally can't lose while the geahs are still mortal. They'd all be logs by the time the fight's over though.<br><br>If it was just a friendly match, I think that the geahs outclass the yuushas pretty handily since the geahs simply have way more options than the geahs do. Tsubasa alone can probably take on Fuu and Karin at once and win, and while Tougou can try and snipe out Chris she can't dodge Megadeth Party. Hibiki also has more battle experience than Yuuna as well as a few years and probably several pounds and could probably wreck her in cqc.<br><br>In terms of gayness Miku is gayer than Tougou but Yuuna is more dense than Hibiki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That being said, the FIS girls are probably a little bit more around the yuushas' power level, whereas Sonoko is probably around a geah's powerlevel. It's hard to say how Sonoko would affect the battle since we've never seen her fight with her 21 fairies and her powers seem to all have to do with dreams or sleep, which is pretty vague. Despite that, she's supposed to be stronger than the rest of the Hero Club combined.</br>  <br>It's not even out until the end of this month.</br>  I want to see season 2 vertex godess mankai Yuuna going full bikizerker  A question I had after seeing it mentioned recently:<br><br>YuYuYu relies on WaSuYu and Jukai for a lot of characterization and worldbuilding. If YuYuYu had been a 2-cour originally, what scenes would you want put in the anime rather than LN/VN, and what new things would you want to see?</br></br>  When is season 2? <br>Is this the first show lookalike- Madoka that be successful?</br>  <br>I would've put in all of WaSuYu if possible for sure because it adds a lot of world building as well as more characterization for Tougou &amp; Sonoko. Jukai isn't really needed but I would've liked what the VNs did in terms of fleshing out Karin &amp; Yuuna's families to have been included in the TV anime too.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128284923 <br><br>Wrong thread, shit.</br></br>  <br> S2 <br>No idea, maybe more info sometime after NoWaYu.<br> successful <br>I think so. Depends on how similar a show has to be to be a lookalike, and how much is has to sell to be successful. <br>The only earlier show I watched that might count is WIXOSS, and it's success on how much it impacted the game it was advertising, since it's first season sold well but the second didn't. But, it's only similar in the sense of being young girls suffering at the hands of a magical, inhuman system and power for a price stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  symphogear 3 subs where?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128284923 <br><br>Sasuga Anon<br> Yuuki best in both series </br></br></br>  <br>After episode 8, highly recommend you read the Washio LN.

I wonder if he and Gin used to fool around.</br>  <br>Tournaments are shit by definition. The only reason the Election wasn't so bad was because they managed to cook up a lot of interesting characters for it, but it's still a long-ass stalling tactic and those same characters are more fun to watch OUTSIDE the tournament proper.</br>  <br>Holy shit, is there any free will left in Ryou?</br>  <br> stalling tactic <br><br>I doubt that was the point this time, Just look at Nao and Hojo both were introduced during the tournament so we know who they are and what their specialty is when Soma is interacting with them in various arcs. To a lesser degree the same applies for Hisako to a lesser degree since we knew nothing about her before the tourney.<br><br>Yeah the latter half lasted too long but the preliminaries was great for setting up characters and situations for the future of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like I said, they managed to make it work because they focused on a lot of stuff outside the tournament proper and because the characters they introduced were all interesting. But it's still easily the worst arc overall.</br>  <br> used to <br>What do you think that "business" he had to attend to was?</br></br>  <br>Being Ryou is suffering.</br>  Soma's dad probably fucked his love interests<br><br>it's a cuck anime</br></br>   They skipped the introduction to the Autumn election <br> Megumi didn't sleep because she was worrying about being nominated so she stumbled onto the father son contest <br> She hasn't been nominated in the anime, why couldn't she sleep <br><br>BRAVO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Interesting, is that what's required for you to self-insert?</br>  <br>More importantly, they skipped the ping pong match. <br><br>Unforgivable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Soma's dad mere presence made every girl in the dorm wet when thinking about Soma's future potential. <br><br>The boy's pussy magnet-itude went up at least threefold from that visit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I will laugh at you when they do it two weeks from now.</br>  <br><br>It still messed up the continuity, stupid.</br></br>  <br>anon he's been with her ever since he was a little boy, He had to deal with all her quirks for a long ass time he simply broke and just went along with it.</br>  <br>whatever works for you man, if the show is more enjoyable for you with that idea then by no means go ahead</br>  Seriously though, it's fucking weird. By Skipping Sensual Karaage and the Ping Pong match, they basically made dad's visit pointless, since he served primarily to encourage soma and megoo for the tournament.  <br>Erina's going to lose her shit when she finds out not only has her superhero husbando put his penis into another woman who wasn't her, but did it so often that it produced her nemesis.</br>  So Casanova are doing the recipe omakes right?

See 説明</br>  <br><br>Look up some of the words they are in to get a feel for them. 解説 and 解釈 might be good since they share a Kanji. 説明 and 演説 are also key words.

You don't lose all human communication skills. That's probably around half of why you learn so much quicker as an adult.<br><br>However, a large piece of this intuition comes from a deep understanding of the grammar and knowing all of the nuances of each of the other words around the unknown word.

This haze continues to exist for a long time.<br><br>Looking up the words makes it exponentially quicker to grasp vocabulary. The sooner you get your vocabulary up to snuff, the sooner you can make it easier to access, and subsequently, the sooner you can remove this haze in more cases than not.
