From when he destroyed the ice.</br>  <br>Stein is a slut, he has the DNA of at least 40 heroes inside him</br>  <br> yfw it turns out that you have to give your DNA willingly to someone to give him OfA <br>geez</br></br>  <br>OH FUCK HES GONNA INHERIT ONE FOR ALL</br>  <br>I wonder if the ofa spirits can help him move?<br><br>Prob not, since last time it was just a single shock</br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck : Is that what this arc is going to be? <br><br>Deku trying to eat Stain's DNA before he loses all for one.</br></br></br>  <br>He has to kill Stain now in order to prevent the quirk transfer. Full edge later boys</br>  <br><br>So all it takes to kill him is to give him an AIDS ridden hero to fight</br></br>  <br>  tfw Kacchan sees Deku's new moves are similar to his </br>  <br><br> &gt;Well-spoken imposters are a dime a dozen <br> &gt;But you <br> &gt;Are worthy to survive <br> &gt;Not the same for these two <br> &gt;No! <br> &gt;Don't touch him! <br> &gt;Ughhhhh!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   All these stupid cunts thinking that just DNA transfer is needed to inherit oneforall  <br><br>Fuck's wrong with yall?</br></br>  <br>No it's because he's smaller than Stain so he needs to take advantage of it. First rule of a battle/fight is to never fight at a disadvantage.</br>    <br>If this were the case, then I don't think all might would have been so secretive about the transfer abilities</br>  <br>All Might dna thing could be a lie or not all the process.</br>  <br>and it got even more torn up from the punch.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128486727 <br>It's too late.<br> They're already here. </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128486727 <br>Just woke up. Are people from reddit actually coming here now? Oh God. Way to ruin my breakfast</br>  <br>I've actually assumed it was like this in the first place.</br>  <br>there's no indication of that, in fact he uses that same hand again a few pages later</br>    <br>I dunno, All Might is still the primary holder of one for all, I don't think deku is capable of a transfer.<br><br>Kinda like how you have to start puberty before you can knock someone up.</br></br></br>  <br>todoroki arrives holy fuck</br>  <br>As torino said, he got some bad habits.</br>  <br>Of course there's something deeper too it. Fuck, all his class have ingested microscopic bits of Deku in one way or another.</br>  <br>Well, at least Stain sticks to his principles.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128486771 <br>There actually here</br>  <br> there's no indication of that <br>Deku was pushing through the pain to try and get Todoroki to use his fire side.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128486916 <br>just like im always at your mother room when she is horny,son</br>  <br>if it had damaged his hand that much using it the first time he wouldn't have been able to use it again:<br>http://bato.to/read/_/316936/boku-n<wbr>o-hero-academia_ch39_by_fallen-ange<wbr>ls/14</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> Ice and fire at the same time <br>Where's the steam Horikoshi</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128486897 <br>You people make me puke.</br>  <br>Knew it, he's impressed by Deku</br>  <br>That's because he didn't let the egg explode.</br>  <br><br>Last page guys, see you same time next week<br><br> &gt;Another one... <br> &gt;There's no end to you intruders today... <br> &gt;Your text, <br> &gt;should've been more specific <br> &gt;Midoriya <br> &gt;I was almost late because of it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this guy gets it</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128486916 <br> We were always here <br>Fuck off. This is why 4chan is starting be a bit shit. It keeps getting diluted by other shitty social networking sites like reddit and tumblr. Do they have nothing to discuss so they come here?</br></br>  <br>thanks for your work anon-san</br>  <br> Your text should've been more specific, Midoriya <br> I was almost late because of it <br>Ooh, so Deku called for backup<br>That was smart<br>Much better than Todoroki showing up outta nowhere</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ty anon</br>  <br>Luckily mods banned the faggots. If you go on other websites keep it to yourself you fucker we dont need to know how many dicks you suck a day. <br><br><br>Thank you translatorfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Shit son! Thanks Translator-Anon</br>  <br><br>I hope Aizawa shows up next week. He's the perfect match for Stain.</br></br>  <br>Best Boy called the other Best Boy yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<wbr>ees</wbr></br>  <br>They have shallow knowledge and only look at the pretty pictures. Secondary's gonna secondary.</br>  <br>Thanks Translator-san.</br>  <br>Deku is motherufcking MC that we all deserve. He know that he wont stand a chance against hero killer so call for help   But why not for fucking pros ? </br>  <br>You're doing god's work Translatorfag.</br>  <br>When did Midoriya even get Todo's number</br>  <br>They're gone, don't push it further</br>  <br>you clearly see him texting someone pages before, also based deku asking for help instead of going "heroic dumb", this boy knows</br>  <br>He probably doesn't have the cell numbers for many pros<br>I'm surprised he didn't call All Might though.</br></br>  <br>Thank you translator-kun. <br><br>  I love you, please marry me  </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt he knows any of the pro's phone number. Its</br>  <br>Obviously offscreen. They were borderliner friends after the battle.</br>  <br>He would have tried but he had no proof. </br>  <br> making All Might worry on your first mission <br>yeah no</br></br>  <br> Next week: flashback of Todoroki talking to his batshit mom and then getting his ass handed to him <br> Chapter ends with "bakuguo enters the fray!" <br> by the end of the arc the half class lies in that alley </br></br></br>  <br>Nah man<br><br>Obviously there is more to it<br><br>I'm hype because we are going to learn a lot more about the quirk because of this<br><br> and there is nothing wrong with getting hype over something like this. Get off your high horse, yo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is one absurdly happy face<br><br>There it is again jesus christ here we goooooo</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Your text, <br> &gt;&gt;should've been more specific <br>What the hell did he write in that small window he had?<br> in alley Iida attacked send help </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He already said he didn't have any more proof to get the pro hero's to believe his story. So he probably asked Todo for a favor.</br></br>  <br>There are Noumus running rampant and Iida nearly got killed already<br>This is already well beyond a simple training mission and Deku is a smart enough kid to know that.</br></br>  <br><br>The only thing that'll annoy me is Todoroki being stupidly OP and untouchable again.<br><br>He only loses to Bakugou because he half-asses it due to being emotionally conflicted. I wanna see him get his shit pushed in by a villain more than Bakugou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AfO enhanced typing brah</br>  thanks for making this board a better place translator-kun.  <br> not calling bakugou <br>arc ruined</br></br>  <br> Ice-kun Iida danger alley fighting hero killer <br><br><br>He has Gran Torino besides him, there's no need to call for Almight</br></br></br></br>  <br>he probably sent it when he saw all the noumus and was trying to find ilda</br>  <br>Calling All Might would have been risky, because his transformation isn't lasting as long as before.</br>  <br>quick text and contact list.<br><br><br>Bakugou lost the dekubowl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> HELP Bakugou Iida is in danger!! <br> What the fuck deku where did you get my number? </br></br>  <br> send help, attacked in alley, iida in danger <br> FUCK OFFFFFFFFFFF WHO GAVE YOU MY NUMBER YOU LITTLE HSITJFSLF </br></br>  <br> Mom.Cookies.BackAlley.Now </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128485493 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128485278 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128484926 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128484985 <br>Nice one, samefag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it kinda normal for you to have the phone number of most of your homeroom in japan?<br><br>Or am I just going crazy?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks as always man, you always save us from the damn FA shitastic translation.</br></br>  <br>Is there a quick text for "Classmate is being attacked by a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle in an alley in Hosu"?</br>  <br>when are they gonna show the slice-of-life side of the series with great characterization and dynamics between the homeroom</br>  <br>fucking casual, should send coordinates like.

Help Iida</br>  Does Stain use throwing knives? It seems like he'd be incredibly scary (even moreso than he already is) if he could just nick you from a distance with a throwing knife then finish you off at his leisure. One-hit paralysis is extremely scary as an ability.  <br>It's something like 35.6833° N, 139.6833° E, dumbo</br>  <br>Hori showed Stain licking the knife he nicked Deku with.<br>Could his quirk have something to do with his tongue having to taste the blood of the foe he wants to paralyze?</br></br>  <br>That could very well be the case, maybe his gross-looking tongue isn't just grotesque stylization and it's actually relevant to his quirk.</br>  <br>God bless you, anon</br>  <br>cool but mine work too.<br> L <br>Latitude<br> B <br> B Longitude</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Cum2me! I need u!"</br>  <br><br>He has to literally taste the blood of whomever he cuts to paralyze them. He does this to both Iida and Deku.</br></br>  <br>I am pretty sure he will lose against Stain or at least get pushed back. Stain got hyped up a bit too much to instantly job to Todoroki or anyone else for that matter. Maybe Endeveor will appear and Stain will have to retreat, Deku might break free or Stains quirk might just run out, whatever it is this fight won't end in Stains defeat.</br>  <br>He need to ingest/lick the blood.</br>   next chapter <br> Stain rushes to slay Ice-kun <br> Ice-Kun: "I wouldn't do that if I was you" <br> Close shot of Stain's Eye <br> Endeavor literally breaks through the wall and burns the running Stain into the ground <br> Stain's right hand is on fire <br> Stain: You...

My hype went full Deku the moment the State dropped.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128488452 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128488374 <br><br>While I appreciate seeing the only good character in that manga, this isn't Medaka Box.</br></br></br>  Thanks based mods  So, is Stain's natural enemy AIDS Man?  <br>No, it's this girl.</br>  <br> Frozen barbecued Iida <br>T-thanks, Friendeavor</br></br>  <br> AIDS Man <br>just fucking imagine</br></br>  So when are we going to get a side chapter with sticky balls and mount lady?  <br>kek'd.<br><br><br>What's her power again ?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Detroit <br> State </br></br>  <br>Her blood is extremely acidic.</br>  I hope we get a pro hero soon that always encourages the villians while he defeats them like screaming <br> "Please try harder, I know you can do it!" <br> "I'm actually not that strong!" <br> "Why don't aim at my legs ones in a while?" </br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how dangerous stain would be with a boomerang</br>  <br>How did he control warp gate?</br>   Pulls off X's wall jump within two days <br> Them sweet sanic moves <br> Two successful SMASHes <br> Secretly calls for help by thumb texting behind his back  <br>Deku is best shonen. I can't wait for Endgame Bawl Might being Superman and Batman rolled into one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He cute Black Mist.</br>  <br>He slashed at his arm. You can see him bleeding in the panel.</br>  <br>You can see that warp was wounded in the arm, so that.</br>  <br>If Stain says Cowabunga at one point my life will be complete</br>  <br>HEY LOOK ITS SUSAKE TO SAVE THE DAY!</br>  <br>hey calm down hes not even close to that kind of edgy</br>  <br>He's more like the Neji that should have been.</br>  <br>For once, I really really want FA to mess up the translation so he says it.</br>  When do we see the poll results?  <br>Want to know the color of todo's new customs, cause his hair is red but maybe black.</br>  <br>Next week I think. Or the next time we get a color page.</br>  <br>Warpman has a real body hiding under the fog. Ochako grabbed him during their first attack.</br>  <br> Detroit <br>YES</br></br>  <br>  Stain's hideout is full of discarded pizza boxes </br>  <br>But he more like Neji</br>  <br> &gt;FUCK OFFFFFFFFFFF WHO GAVE YOU MY NUMBER YOU LITTLE HSITJFSLF <br> ... <br> ...why isn't he texting back? </br></br></br>  <br>The next day everyone in class is talking about how they fought Stain. Kacchan can't participate.</br>  <br><br>Until he shows any dere, he's just tsun.</br></br>  I knew the having the text would help make the chapter better. It's till transtion one rather then a super hype moment but the characterization going for Deku and Stain does a lot.<br><br>Hell even Deku's calling for help plays into the theme about a real hero. This is about saving lives for him, not proving he has the biggest dick in the room.</br></br>  <br> oh man, you remember how silly everyone looked when paralyzed? </br>  Ok, we know stain needs to suck his target's blood, then how was he able to do that to blackmist? I assumed blackmist real body was somewhere else  <br>Blackmist didn't have his power activated in the bar. It's like how crowbro has a bird head but that's not his quirk.</br>  <br> oh yeah, we were lucky to get out of there. <br><br>Meanwhile Kacchan is salty.</br></br></br>  <br>Would have been salty even if he was there..</br>  <br>How can he write with such precision on a touchscreen without looking?<br>Did he already have the message ready beforehand?</br></br>  I hope Endeavor is the one to save the day, to be honest. I want to see him doing something heroic since all he has done is be an ass.  <br>SASUKE SAVES THE DAY</br>  So does this mean IcyHot is interning at his dad's after all? Endeavor was close by too after all  <br>Wonder if they have some sort of chat group for that.</br>  <br>Somehow I can totally imagine him having a few drafts for these situations<br> Strong hero in ____, need help <br> Pls evacuate ____ <br> Wounded people at ____ </br></br></br></br>  <br> Strong hero in ____, need help <br>Strong villain you mean.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, of course</br>  <br><br>Drawfag you there?<br><br>Draw dis.</br></br></br></br>  What's the chances that deku and todo gives stain the good old one, two, tag team ass whooping he wants so bad. <br><br>And I like stain more and more. if he actually sees your potential he lets you go. And I bet iida is going to be ass hurt about the whole ordeal! You would think he would be happy, but no I can already see him being salty like sasuke was when he realized how fast naruto was growing.</br></br>  I want to see Deku in with his cowl on. Also I need some more training and less almost death  <br>Nope thats Gaara.</br>  <br><br>That's Kaachan's secret, he's always salty.</br></br>  <br><br> What's the chances that deku and todo gives stain the good old one, two, tag team ass whooping he wants so bad.  <br><br>None, but the ice will provide a good distraction so Large Size Jump Spicy Flame Dad can join the fray.</br></br></br></br>  How long until the anime gets announced?<br>Jump Festa?</br>  <br>Deku is a pro stalker, he probably knows the numbers of all of his classmates.</br>  <br>Next year</br>  <br>Probably never, the author is speedy as fuck, he doesn't have time for such things.</br>  <br>Whenever Toei is ready.</br>  CHINK SCANS  <br>We can only hope whoever picks up the anime does a lot of comfy character interaction filler instead of making shitty filler villain arcs<br><br> Who am I kidding </br></br></br>  <br>Stop it anon! You're trying curse this manga right!</br>  <br>Mad dog mad dog mad dog mad dog mad dog mad dog</br>  <br><br>Look into your heart anon, you know it is true.<br><br>Generally anything this popular gets a bad studio. My kingdom for Bones or Madhouse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want Dogakobo to adapt it?</br>  <br>Right after Toei finishes World Trigger.</br>  <br><br>Well, Kohei's pacing allows for a lot of potentially canon filler.<br><br>+The other students fighting their mooks in USJ.<br>+All of the one-on-one tournament!<br>+The "Bonus" events for the tournament washouts.<br>+More of the other students internships<br>+drag out Deku's training a bit longer.<br>+some more stain/shigaraki asides<br><br>Lots of stuff to drag it out without having One Piece tier filler arcs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ninja turtle?</br>  <br>Sasuke?</br>  <br>For some strange reason, I keep on forgetting to save them fujo drawings of Todoroki going after Deku, especially since its appropriate this time</br>  <br>That pairing overtook Fujos rather quickly, didn't it?</br>  <br> WT <br> Popular <br><br>I love it WT to death but it really isn't not with nips or NA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did god make speed readers?</br>  <br>More like Nedgy.</br>  <br> Hero Academy <br><br>Ah, so this is where that frog girl that keeps showing up on /a/ is from. Thinks op for providing the source for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are people even arguing this?<br> He's obviously Zuko </br></br>  <br>Hahaha pic shit I was way fucking off!!!! I'm sorry I don't know what I was thinking I meant mad house</br>  <br> when anon is telling the truth and you can't fight it  <br><br>At least let me have hope that God will send it a savior like madhouse at least</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Toei doing another season of World Trigger but with completely anime original content?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>Even Stain will run away from Endeavour.</br>  <br>Apparently it is. Well after that is over Toei is probably going to nab Boku Hero.</br>  <br><br>It overtook tumblr really quickly because Bakugou parings were "problematic" due to how abusive he was.<br><br>So yes, "problematic" fantasy pairings of manga characters are a thing<br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let be real here. Todoroki will be first at the popularity poll, isn't he. I don't even like him but I can't see him losing.  <br> things a cursory glance at the main tag show no sign of </br>  <br>I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and just assume "problematic" means "no chemistry" and I agree, but there's also no chemistry with todoroki.<br>The only decent pairing shit i've seen is that Bakugou and ochako squabble stuff.<br>Who ever does that should continue.</br></br></br>  <br>You've said this before, and from what I can find, there is one person saying that and the rest of tumbler loves Bakugou.</br>  <br>The cat gets me every time.</br>  Anime when?  <br>My bet for the results is:<br>1. All might<br>2. Midoriya<br>3. Uraraka<br>4. Todoroki<br>5. Tsuyu<br>6. Bakugou<br>7. Tokoyami<br>Then im not sure, anyone's game.<br>Bakugou is going to lose some fujo points to Todoroki for being an asshole, but i dont think todoroki is going to beat that top 3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ochako being that high <br>We can only hope.</br></br>    <br>There is no way she's losing to any of the other girls at this point.<br>Maybe when the series has a bit more weight to it and some other girls get a lot of screen time.</br></br>  <br> Ochako being that high <br><br>Nips have shit taste there is no way she is gonna be that high</br></br></br>  <br> DETROID <br>Clench your ass real tight and...<br><br><br> SMASH <br>Shit nigga, I came.  And cried a little. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear it will happen.<br>Iida is a wild card though.<br>I dont expect him to appear high because he's a bit of a cunt, but his screentime might make him show up anywhere</br></br></br>  <br>Iida, Stain, Hosu alley, Help</br>  <br>A lil bit of blood came out of my dick</br>  <br>I'm more interested in 2 things.<br>When did deku get todoroki's address?<br>And how talkative is todoroki?<br>I mean, deku must have known he was in hosu so at the very least he get's status updates but is todoroki secretly a very texty guy like Sasaki Isaburo?  RIP </br></br></br></br>  <br> heroes not having a special app that allows for a distress signal and a trackable position </br>  <br><br>i think is to soon for that to happen, also stain just lick a little bit of blood, almost nothing, im sure there is more to it.</br></br>  <br>Why dont we actually have that?<br>emergency services is pretty dumb, if you call but dont say anything they might not even take it seriously, but if you're in a real emergency you might not have the time for that shit.</br></br>  <br>ty anon, you are the best</br>  <br>They may trade All Might cards, stickers and talk a lot about Silver Age heroes.</br>  <br><br> All Might <br> 1st <br> In Japan <br> Land of shit taste </br></br></br></br></br>  the real judgement of japan's taste will be where dekumom ranks  <br>If it is good taste<br><br>at the bottom</br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  http://www.poll-maker.com/poll36960<wbr>6x1ab32B16-14<br><br>The poll corresponds with the image.</br></br></wbr>  <br><br> Mei has 1/3 of the votes. <br><br>Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck your poll, it's Mei time!</br>  <br><br><br> Mei has more votes than the rest combined. <br><br>Why</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mei has her own Y-san apparently</br>  <br> Iida carrying Deku <br>I hope we can still see Iida's smile after this arc</br></br>  <br><br>I'm impressed the author actually gave him a reason to show up instead of being there randomly to save the day. Deku is pretty smart for a MC since they usually don't plan this much. Even something as simple as calling backup in an emergency is to be praised.</br></br>  So everything thinks icyhot will stall him before ultimately having to be saved by his pops and storming off angrily because of it right?<br><br>I can just see him paralyzed while his dad is talking down to him about how fire is so great.</br></br>  <br> And I like stain more and more. if he actually sees your potential he lets you go. <br><br>He's just letting him go so he can kill him later though.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Todoroki will have the upperhand, he's all ranged attack, but is still good when the fight is brought into close range, his ability has an advantage over stain.<br>I think stain will either escape and/or be attacked by Mr. Hands<br>Fire dad will probably deal with the noumus.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice poll you got there.</br>  <br>It would be nice if we could have one of these without people gaming it and spamming their waifu. I know that will never happen, I'm just saying it would be nice.</br>  <br> Implying those aren't the real results </br>  <br>Yeah, I actually want to know what people think. I think there'd be a lot of variety considering how likable most of the cast is</br>  <br>Yes anon, that's exactly what I'm doing. How astute of you to notice that.</br>  <br>Pretty much every boy is likable except bakugou.<br>Though only like half of them are diddle-able.</br></br>  <br><br>In Eyeshield 21, the winning and loosing team members exchanged their numbers as a show of no hard feelings and future training partners.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Deku has mindkun's number.<br><br><br><br>But then again he'll have to be working with his dad in order to be in the area to respond so quickly.<br><br>I want to see Endeavor going apeshit at the thought of his son being in danger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Bakugou <br> Not likeable <br><br>Anon pls. Everyone loves him because he's framed as the asshole he is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All Might <br> 1st <br> Other interesting side characters <br> Anywhere near the top <br>Nahh. It's Japan, the land that voted a side character with no personality over all of the main characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying dad of the year won't just yell at his kid for being too weak. </br></br>  <br><br>does it constantly smell like pussy around her when she's always fighting nude like in the cavalry fight?<br><br>surely her invisibility must have some weakness.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Look at that Iida face <br>totally SASUKE</br></br>  <br>I don't think Ochako will higher than Frog, unless y-san loves her.</br>  <br>Frog is only fanart popular.<br>That's why she'll be the highest ranked minor character.<br>Ochako is like the sakura of this manga if sakura wasnt shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> but you <br> are worthy to survive <br><br><br>I really REALLY like Stain  he is stain because he is a necesary evil to remove all the fake heroes that stain society , he has principles and sticks to them, he's not a psycho just looking for a reason to kill.<br><br>I can see how he could even actually attack yuuhei at some point, because that institution only promotes bigmouths into the hero business when they have not the true hero principles like Deku.<br><br>Stain is impressed by Deku for the same reason All Might chose him to inherit OfA.<br><br>So stain wants to make hereos tob e REAL hrees for some reason and improve society, but then what do Shigaraki and his boss want?<br><br>Damned Hiroshiki making a shonen this great.<br><br>Deku is fucking awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Stain can at the very least paralyze 2 people at once (we don't know if the other hero is paralyzed or unconscious).<br><br>he has to be fucking good to be able to cut strong heroes to pralyze them.<br><br>How do you discover a quirk where you have to lick the blood of another and then you can paralyze them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah todo will help them gain time before they run the fuck away from there.<br><br>Maybe endavor will get killed this arc.<br><br>Oh man I really hope Stain is a permanent character and not one just for this arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that will be shown in a flasback when grapes calls deku to visit him at the hospital, becaus he's been injured.<br><br>Then the group rushes there only to find mt lady all angry outside and grapes there with a dumb happy face<br><br> I... I've been in paradise! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Totally agree, Deku is the hero Shonen deserves.</br>  <br>nah he will keep an eye on him, so if deku goes against his heroic principles, stain will be there to kill him.</br>  <br>He's probably angry because no one saved him from AIDS</br>  <br>Kek, Underrated post</br>  <br>I'd wager he probably thought he was quirkless for a long time like Deku and only became aware of it later in life. Maybe he too craved to be a hero but was never able to become one due to appearing to be quirkless. Seeing wannabes that didn't really give a damn about being a true hero attain the position he so coveted may have driven him over the edge and led to the mindset he has now.  Perhaps he learned of his quirk after earning his redwings. </br>  <br>maybe his mental stress was greater, because he DID have that bone in the toe, but he never learned his quirk until later on.<br><br>Imagine knowing you have a quirk but you can't use it, or know how or what to do to use it.<br><br>Must be frustrating.<br><br>And I think you are right about seeing all the hero wannabee being fake while he felt to be more worthy.<br><br>If this is the case I really like Stain more, because he is a really good contrast to Deku, or even All Might himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw he accepted to train with his Dad which explains him being there </br>  <br>I guess that's obvious.</br>  <br>What should be:<br><br>1.- All Might<br>2.- Deku<br>3.- Grapes<br>4.- Bakugo<br>5.- Ochako<br>6.- Crow bro.<br>7.- Todoroki<br>8.- Erasehead<br>9.- Stain<br>10.- Tsuyu/Mei<br><br>What will be:<br><br>1.- Todoroki<br>2.- Deku<br>3.- Bakugo<br>4.- Shigaraki<br>5.- Ida<br>6.- one of the metal dudes<br>7.- Crow bro.<br>8.- Ochako<br>9.- Tsuyu<br>10.- All Might</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If we ignore Mei Deku is the most popular</br>  <br>Why would you ignore Mei?</br>  <br>3.Grapes<br> Fuck off, I hate that grapes</br></br>  <br>Because someone was obviously samefagging with his shitty script/bots</br>  <br>Lunch Rush a best.

Did he do some shit like this during the festival?</br>  <br>Yes. That or during his fight with Deku. Either or, really.</br>  <br>I won't be surprised if at some point Deku's punches will have more explosive power than Bakugou's.</br>  <br> his smile and optimism: returning </br>  <br>The way he's moving. Rapid movement with sudden explosive changes in direction.</br>  <br><br>Someone need to make a reaction image of that with Stain already.</br></br>  <br>I tried for you buddy</br>  <br>I feel like Kacchan is screaming to the skies, challenging God itself.<br><br> I WILL BE POPULAR </br></br></br>  <br>he already is popular, what he wants is to be nº 1.</br>  <br>He's popular in what aspect? Hero wise yeah he's popular for his skills, attitude wise nobody likes him as a hero. In school nobody likes him with his closes friend being red riot(who is honestly maybe the nicest guy in the whole class).</br>  <br>No don't you mean he's the one we want and deserve? because if we don't deserve him then what do we deserve some shit tier hack hero who super dumb but somehow is a fighting idiot savant ?</br>  <br><br>^This<br><br>All Might has never been worried about Deku being captured for his DNA, he's only worried about himself.<br><br>That and if Deku could transfer like All Might, the computer guy would have told Handkun to capture him instead of just killing him off.<br><br>All Might needs to die for Deku to be able to transfer OfA to the next candidate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he is the well known asshole from class A</br>  <br>All Might would be lucky to make top 10 even.

That "world changing event" Narrator Deku said was pretty ominous.</br>  <br><br> jizzedinmypants.mp3 </br></br>  <br><br> Kacchan gets at the bottom <br> Even fewer votes than lunch rush. </br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Deku style on this pic like fem-Deku on fanarts?</br>  <br><br>Silver's just good at imitating Horikoshi's style.</br></br>  Wait, didn't Iida also not save Ochako during the test because he wanted to make sure he got the most pints he could get to make sure he got in and wrote it off that if it was a real world situation he would have helped her? And then figured Deku only help her because he knew he'd get points for it? Horikoshi you clever little...  <br><br>Okay Anon, explain where you're going with this.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, there's been plenty of subtle foreshadowing that Iida isn't all that heroic.</br>  <br>Just that the fact that under the right condition Ida can find a reason to put himself before others has been hinted at from the very beginning.</br>  <br>To go a little further I'm not saying Iida isn't overall a good guy, just that he's had this flaw that's been there right in front of us from day one that we could over look and because he's so earnest and straight lace you'ed never think of him being a guy to mess up in being anything other then the square jawed completely morally upright type.</br>  <br> Uraraka <br> 35% <br>NOPE, Officially bullshit.  Not that I don't like her though. </br></br></br>  <br>I just realized something.<br>Tetsutetsu or Kirishima might be able to fight Stain with almost no problem.</br></br>  <br>I think on a bigger note this kind of feeds into the complaints that Aizawa and Stein's complaints about the hero course at UA.<br><br>First of all the entrance exam, you don't have to save people to get in, in fact the school values the amount of robots you can defeat aka the amount of showing off you do, over the amount of lives you save (look at Bakugou). In fact Deku didn't defeat any robots but saved the most people out of anyone taking the exam, but even so the exam proctors only cared about how many robots he could defeat, and in fact almost didn't pass him because of it. And even worse the way how its set up means that people whose quirks can help save lives but who can't show off will be passed over.</br></br></br>  <br>He could just stab them in their eyes, but yes, they have a big advantage over him.</br>  <br> In fact Deku didn't defeat any robots but saved the most people out of anyone taking the exam, but even so the exam proctors only cared about how many robots he could defeat, <br>That's wrong, they had an whole heroic points system that gave Deku a shit fuckton of points because he did the right thing, they just happen to prefer not telling the participants about it for obvious motives and know that to be a hero you need to be strong. Of course, it could be better, buy saying that they only cares about how many robots he could defeat is silly. Also, I'm confident that other people also got heroics points.</br></br>  <br><br>N-No, it will be Bones and it will be full with sakuga! Just you wait!<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Tsuyu that far down the list.<br><br>HA HA HA HA HA<br><br>Hipster faggots. She has the most fanart and r34 out of this series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't there are other departments/branches of the Hero Academy focused on support and less showy things?</br>  <br>Deku was ranked last even though he had the most saves while Kacchan was ranked first he had zero. The proctors then had to be convinced to allow Deku into the hero course. They prioritized destroying robots over saving lives.<br><br><br>Support isn't for the heroes, support creates hero tech that the heroes use on the field. The hero branch is all encompassing, remember the villain invasion was originally supposed to be an natural disaster exercise in saving lives.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Deku was ranked last <br>You're full of shit, pic related, Deku was 7, everyone above him other than Kacchan also got at least some points in rescue/heroics, he would rank 2 otherwise. <br>Deku also only saved a single person and definitely lost points for blowing his arm along with the robot while Kacchan destroyed a shit fuckton of robots, saying that they prioritized destroying robots over saving people is just false.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you!<br><br>I sometime look up at the sky and ask "god why did you create speed readers?"</br></br></br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-24/2nd-garo-anime-to-prem<wbr>iere-in-october/.90850<br><br>The 2nd Garo anime will air in fall. It will be a period drama set in the heian period with a female MC<br>The movie will also have a new story<br><br>Bad news, guys. We aren't gona see Leon's gang anymore</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>   FEMALE MC <br><br><br>IT'S OVER<br><br>GARO IS FINISHED</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whats a period drama? Anyway, im just hoping the animation and the OST is as good as the first one.</br>  <br>The live action Garos were all stand-alone anyway, right?<br><br>I don't have a problem with a completely new cast in any case.</br></br></br>  <br>Female mc equals win</br>  At least it's still MAPPA  NO<br>FEMALE<br>MAKAI<br>KNIGHTS</br></br></br>  <br>Wikipedia tells me it's basically a term for shows set in certain moments of history. Here it means that it will replace the medieval notSpain setting for a setting in Heian (794 to 1185) Japan</br>   female MC <br>IT'S OVER<br>THE SJWs HAVE WON</br></br>  It will be good, also this   <br>/m/ are theorizing this means that the MC will be a makai priest/alchemist this time, instead of a makai knight</br>  <br>This is technically good. It will at least mean that the fights won't be CG.</br>   FeMC <br><br>Why,I want more fights with Makai Knights not some shit tier alchemist</br></br>   heian period <br>Well this could be cool. I wonder if the MC will be part of the Saejima bloodline or would marry into the family or something. Would be hilarious if some descendent of the Luis family just wash up on the shore and start the Saejima-Garo line.</br>  Hopefully since MAPPA isn't really doing anything right now, they won't sub most of the first cour to DRMOVIE like last time. Baha S2 should be later next year if it's going to have a production period as long as the first.<br><br>Before anyone asks, VOLN/DANGUN/DRMOVIE are doing all the animation in UtT, and MAPPA for the foreseeable future will be indulging in the time-honored MADHOUSE tradition of doing nothing and then putting their name on the credits anyway.<br>The only thing they're making this season apparently so far is one episode of Prison School.</br></br></br>  <br>A great share of tokusatsu lover are woman and garo is not an exception. The problem is not many woman toku lover liking anime as medium also.</br>  This is bad.<br><br>No Makai Knight MC gives me the impression this will have a lot of DRAMA and MISUNDERSTANDINGS.<br><br>Or worse, LOVE DRAMA AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS.<br><br>In a perfect universe we would get cute priestess doing badass things but we all know it won't be like that.<br><br>This is your fault Decade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the second season was a direct sequel to the first with the same cast, and the fourth season featured the son of Kouga as the main character</br>  Tokusatsu is bishounen wankfest, that's understandable. Female MC in tokusatsu prolly a good idea but in shonen anime, well that's a risky moves by mappa.  <br>It's clear now that they are using the anime for all those ideas they've wanted to try but weren't able to because they wouldn't fly at all in the toku.<br><br>Besides, it's not like S1 sold very well at that too. That was funded on pachinko money and this will obviously be funded on pachinko too.<br><br>Pachinko is love. Pachinko is life.</br></br></br></br></br>   heian period <br>Damn. I really wanted it to be set in medieval Europe again.<br> We aren't gona see Leon's gang anymore <br>Damn.</br></br></br>  The first season is just too edgy even by garo standard more of in their first season of the anime. welp they really doing a risky moves again.  <br>They make it Garo series is too edgy and angsty even for Garo standard though.</br>  Even if the protagonist is female, there's still the chance of the deuteragonist being Garo.<br><br>Assuming Garo is in the anime's title of course. If they have something like "A Garo Sidestory" in their title like Tougen Flute, then Garo probably won't show up at all.</br></br>  <br>It will fly in the toku as long as there is enough bishounen wankfest.</br>  <br>Why must everything be Decade's fault.<br> LOVE DRAMA AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS. <br>The contract between a typical shoujo romance and hunting down Horrors would be amazing to see.</br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps, but doing a toku in generic medieval europeland would be a pain in the ass. That's the type of thing I'm referring to.</br>  Wonder who the seiyuu will be. I swear if it's HanaKana or Hayamin, they've been in enough stuff.<br><br>Maybe KitaEri. She's already been in a MAPPA anime anyways.</br></br>  <br> Why must everything be Decade's fault. <br>He obviously gained Ladan's power and went back in time to turn the first Saejima Garo into a woman.</br></br>  <br>Yea the setting and the story are expensive in tokusatsu format.</br>  <br>I'm fine with that, the first anime ended in a good place for Leon and the others. I hope the 2nd anime ends up being as enjoyable as its predecessor.</br>  <br> Why must everything be Decade's fault <br>Who knows</br></br>  <br>  enjoyable <br>If you like edgy 'incarnate' anime. The story the opening and the ending is just full of edgyness lel .</br></br>  <br> Edgy incarnate <br> Edgy <br>The fuck are you talking about? Garo may be dark, but its far from the most edgy anime around</br></br></br>  <br>Is this is the new series of garo?<br>It seem the series is still strong.</br></br>  <br>It's not the most edgy but in the modern era rarely anime has this edgy setting even the toku series is far lighthearted than the anime.</br>  <br>Yeah, its from Goldstorm, pretty solid season so far and Decade makes for a fucking great villain. The OP is really good too <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qD-<wbr>EnZaPktM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Why would you shitpost so blatantly in a Garo thread? It's not like they pop up frequently at all.</br>  I hope Leon and company are still plot relevant somehow.  <br>This aired in the same year as Cross Ange, you literally don't know what you're talking about.</br>  <br>  modern era <br>i meant in recent time</br></br>  <br>They said that the movie will also be an original story, but I'm hoping that they'll feature in it in some way</br>  <br>It's not shitpost newfag it's a fact. Have you even completed the Garo anime series?</br>  <br> but in the modern era rarely anime has this edgy setting <br>No one would actually type this with any serious conviction, and with a grasp on English this poor, when AgK and Tokyo Ghoul exist.</br></br>  <br> Cross ange  <br>  edgy <br>Are you high or something?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh wow, I didn't know Decade show up in Goldstorm. I need to catch up.</br></br>  <br>Just report and move on.</br>  <br>So written by Okada?</br>  <br>always wanted a Priest/Priestess to be the lead.</br>  <br> Mc is girl <br>Hmm could work out. We will see.</br></br>  <br>seasons 1, 2, and 4 are connected<br>Seasons 3 and 5 are connected</br></br>  <br>Garo is shit anyway</br>  <br>probably the best season since Makai Senkai</br>  Since we're getting a female MC in the GARO series, just how many censored/uncensored nipple shots are we gonna get?  <br> set in the heian period <br>Good, after watching Kaguya-hime no Monogatari I'm convinced more stuff needs to have a heian period setting</br></br>  <br>I'm just hoping that the MC will be as cool as Jabi or Rekka</br>  curious to see if the anime will break continuity with the Live show and let the protagonist don on the armor or if the show will star a priestess...honestly either one is interesting  <br>The opening and the ending of both anime is not even edgy. AGK is not that edgy tokyo ghoul is more of gross than edgy. Though they already lost in OP and ED in the factor of edgyness atmosphere. You forgot important things Garo is more mature theme and audiences than both of the kiddy animes. Garo has nudity, sex etc and many adult theme compared to those two kiddy stories</br>  <br>You need to report yourself for being newfag.</br>  <br>Garo's CG was actually pretty good though</br>   The first garo thread in moths, made because of news about the new anime , and the movie. <br> we get a shitposter claiming it's the edgiest shit ever in modern times when Chaos "kill your friends to kill your enemies" Dragon exists <br>Why?</br></br>   No more fun times with the Fonz <br><br>That's too bad.<br>At least his smile will stay protected this way.</br></br></br>  I don't mind fem MC if she's hot blooded but I don't want alchemy, I want a knight  <br>maybe season 3?</br>  <br> Female Knight <br>That's retarded, you are retarded. And if they actually throw everything this franchise has been built on for one super duper speshuul snowflake female knight exception or whatever I'll be done with this franchise.</br></br>  <br>Because /a/.</br>  <br> I don't mind a fem MC <br><br>IT GOES AGAINST THE FUCKING LORE<br>IT'S A DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO THE RULES ESTABLISHED</br></br></br></br>  <br> female MC </br>  <br>Well, a woman was able to use a Makai Blade by implanting her father's bone inside her arm in the Zero spinoff. So logically, by implanting a Makai Knight's skeleton inside a woman's body, a woman should be able to use a Makai Knight's armor.<br><br>There's no way this can possibly go wrong.</br></br></br>   Female MC <br><br>WE WANT THE WAIFUFAGOTAKU AUDIENCE<br><br>FUCKING PIG DISGUSTING ANIMEFAGS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Established for the main series.<br><br>Isn't the anime basically an AU.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd only go against the lore if it was a female makai knight. The news only says that its a female MC</br>  <br>Female MC =/= Female Knight<br><br>I would dislike a Female Knight as much as the guy next to me but let's not jump ship yet. MC-Chan will probably be a priestess. Or god forbid, a normal girl who will fall in love with Garo-senpai and it will be love drama.</br></br></br>  <br> for one super duper speshuul snowflake female knight exception <br><br>nah, Yaiba is way worst</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you fucking start.<br><br>I don't go around saying how there should be guy Precures in manga adaptation because it's an AU</br></br></br>  <br>He is actually the main villain this time.</br>  <br> We aren't gona see Leon's gang anymore <br>I was expecting that until the final episode where I just thought they'd go with more Leon.</br></br>  <br>but /a/ wants to be the dude in the dress</br>  <br> Female MC <br> Possible Female Garo/Makai Knight <br>MASS<br>PANIC<br><br> But what if she was Horror </br></br></br></br></br></br>   <br>But we've already had romance in Garo and it was great</br>  <br>The garo first series do have choose the path of edgyness. 'Woman' audience for some reasons love drama, edgy and darkness.</br>  <br> yfw the female MC is a super-powered end game Horror who spends the entire show mostly naked <br> the show ends when she's penetrated by Garo </br></br>  <br> Horror-chan MC trying to survive assassination attempts from the evil Makai Knights <br>Fund it.</br></br>  <br>They this time choose shoujo audiences and another edgy themes again probably. It's quite risky though.</br>  <br>Is this the first time there's a female MC in Garo franchise? Only seen the anime, not anything live action related. Can females be Makai knights in the setting or only alchemists?</br>  Guys, we're clearly going to have a Makai Priestess as the MC, so I fail to understand why people are getting bootyblasted over nothing.  <br>Garo is not the name of makai priestess</br>  <br>Women can only be Makai Priests. There was a spinoff live action movie that starred two Makai Priests, Jabi and Rekka, as the main characters</br>  <br>   Horror <br>What if she's a  Watchdog?  The entire show be Makai bureaucracy.<br><br>When will Raiga  save his parents from wherever they are. Kouga is way too cool giving up the armor and fighting with just his skill in that dimension. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, seeing a cute girl broken is an amazing sight</br>  <br>For all we know the GARO of this series might either be a deuteragonist or have a supporting role.</br>  <br>so, not like it's the first time the MC wasn't the titicular character.</br>  <br> Kouga is way too cool <br>Best protag, Leon is pretty close though</br></br>  <br>i don't watch that typical kiddy anime. is that urobuchi character that it should be male instead of woman initially. So the story is never meant o be edgy overload sinec beginning. Even the op more of shounen battle wankfest than edgyness. It's even got many moefication and gender. The gender even irrelevant in this anime.</br>  Does the first season end in a conclusive way? I always held out on watching Garo because I thought the second season was going to be a direct continuation.  <br> NEW CHARACTERS <br><br>NO, FUCK OFF. <br><br>NO NO, WHERE'S MY ALFONSO AND LEON?<br><br>FUUUUUUUUUUUCK OFFFFFFFFFFFFF</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, its pretty conclusive.</br>  What if the MC is a Miko Priestess.  <br>  pic unrelated <br>Do you even know what you're talking about?<br> Kamen rider gattack is not the MC.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the main cast see closure to their arcs and it ends on a pretty optimistic note</br>  <br>I still remembered some people got pissed off because the end was too optimistic.</br>  <br> Cerise Hood <br>She is perfection</br></br>  <br>How when fucking everyone died?</br>  <br>What the fuck, a period drama in the heian period is literally gonna make it a fucking samurai story + demons + shitty shoehorned FeMC. Fuck this world, this isn't GARO.</br>  <br>It's like a Gundam MC not using a Gundam or Gundam clone.</br>  <br>Gattack is like Yuzu in Yugioh Arc-V, might as well have been the main character.</br>  <br>because the baby was hope</br>  <br>Maybe they just want more Leon's suffering but he got a pretty optimistic end which threw them off after all that build up.</br>  <br>Oh fuck off, that's bittersweet as fuck.<br><br>Garo was amazing and the ending was great.<br><br>New Garo sounds stupid as fuck, but honestly I'll still watch it and I'll probably end up enjoying it a lot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, time to get into Garo then.</br></br>  <br>Aye, Kouga is the best. Rei is the second best for me, his spinoff was great, though  a bit strange seeing that same foreign actor playing a different horror .<br><br>It does, the MCs accomplish their goals and conclude all the plot lines. All the characters get proper development and growth aswell.</br></br></br>  <br>Lel woman as protag in YGO. You need to stop posting that's far from good comparation. Gattack is cannot even TOUCH kabuto let alone to become MC.</br>  <br>But wasn't the point of all that suffering that he would learn from it and become a proper Makai Knight? It would've been pretty pointless if ended with him and the others just dying</br>  Man I really should make some time to go through everything Garo. Only seen the first toku quite some time back, and am still working on the series. Remember the toku was plenty fun. How many more series/movies are there after it?  <br>If you notice Garo series actually has habit of using the same actors for different roles in different seasons/movies.</br>  <br>if you want a better comparison, he is Zenkeichi from Medaka Box</br>  <br>You really don't know what you're talking about if being a plot window, and hardly anything more, is all a MC needs</br>  <br>Gattack is like some stupid/ idiot character to make the protag to look like einstein genius in comparison.</br>  <br> Maybe they just want more Leon's suffering <br>Well fuck them, the fucking seeds and losing his dad should be more than enough. Still mad.</br></br>  <br>Live Action<br>5 seasons<br>1 tv movie<br>3 theatrical movies<br>1 mini series<br>3 straight to dvd films</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I thought Leon was pretty deserving of a shot at a better life after everything he went through. And it's not like it's going to be a cakewalk for him even then, being Garo and having to raise his little bro.</br>  <br>wasn't the whole point of the last part of Dedaka was to find out which of the two was really the MC?</br>  <br>Wait, really? Now I need to go back and check.</br>  They're probably going to make it a full-on drama to top the suffering of Leon.  <br>that's just typical of live action shows...it's essentially the same as having the same voice actor/ess for multiple characters.</br>  <br><br>Mother of fuck, it will take me the rest of the year to go through all of them. Guess I'll get the second season or whatever comes after the first tonight to at least get the ball rolling. Much appreciated.</br></br>    <br>After the first season there is<br> Beast of the Midnight Sun (Kouga Movie) <br> Red Requiem (Kouga Movie) <br> Makai Senki (Kouga Series, fucking awesome) <br> Lament of the Dark Dragon (Kouga Movie) <br> Zero Black Blood (Spinoff with Rei as the lead) <br> Tougen no Fue (Spinoff with Jabi and Rekka as the leads) <br> Yami wo Terasu mono (Tv series with new cast, honestly pretty bad but it has its moments and picks up towards the end) <br> Makai no Hana (Sort of sequel to the first two seasons, has Kouga's son as the protag) <br> Goldstorm (Current season, sequel to Yamitera with Ryuga and Rian as the protags) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or Shinsuke from Sengoku Youko.</br>  <br>flash enemy needs to be changed to Gold storm</br>  <br>Garo! GARO!! GAROOOOOO!!!!</br>  <br><br><br>A movie it is then. Thanks. Thank fuck it's the weekend too. Would have gotten something then forgotten about it by the weekend if I asked about this sooner.</br></br></br>  <br> the fucking seeds <br>Don't remind me goddammit.<br><br>Did Over-time sub Yami? Or do I have to go with T-N?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It still hurts, doesn't it?</br>  <br>Over time has everthing post-first season</br>  <br>I'll always remember that her funeral aired on Valentines day, just to rub it in a little bit more.</br>  <br> T-N <br><br>You're better off watching anything without an alternative as raw really. I personally can't concentrate on the damn show due to their damn shit.</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=search&amp;cat<wbr>s=5_19&amp;term=Garo&amp;sort=5<br><br>They have. The issue is <br> seeders </br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>/krg/ on /m/ have all of Garo in their Mega if torrents are an issue</br>  <br><br>Shinsuke seems be getting set up as the protag for the inevitable part 3 though<br><br> I'm looking forward to it. Shinsuke is the best character in Senyouko </br></br></br></br>  <br>He choose an old hag after that it's just some weird and awkward moment</br>  <br> Female MC </br>  <br>But will the OST match up to the first series?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oI9<wbr>r-_Logn0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Stop it. I only want to remember the happy part.<br><br>Alright, thanks. Need to finish Yami so I can start Goldstorm.<br><br>I'll check /m/ first to see if the mega batch is back up yet, if not I'll just go download from Over-time's site.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm almost certain that its going to be the same people doing the OST, but I could be wrong</br>  <br> Mega <br>Their what?<br><br><br>No happiness, only suffering. Unless you have Gonza's ancestor with you.</br></br></br></br></br>  As long as the animation is on par with the fight between Leon and Alfonso for the golden armor, I won't complain.<br><br>That fight is beautiful</br></br>  <br> Their what? <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!94IVTKDC!p7Pz<wbr>w5Me6IdTvL5tv8k6qQ</wbr></br></br>  <br> Not knowing mega </br>  <br>Yea and is not helping when the protag is just childish teen but in adult themes.</br>  Female MC is going to be the reincarnation of Lala  <br>You know it.</br>  <br>Nah, they'll be pulling an Aquarion.<br> She'll be the reincarnation of the dog. </br></br>  No more Leon, Alfonso, Ema or Watchdog-chan.<br>I didn't realise how attached to the characters I was until now.</br>  BDs by anyone when?<br><br>Why is whynot so fucking dead?</br></br>  <br> No Watchdog-chan <br>It's possible.</br></br>  <br> heian period <br>Meh. One of the things that made the old season interesting for me was the not-Japan setting.<br>Will look into it though, I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Gonza truly is perfect in any age.<br><br> A farmer girl beating up Horror with pent up romance power <br>Why not. If a Samurai can overwhelm Horror with his pride then I'm sure love can do the samething.<br><br> Watchdog-chan. <br>Oh yeah, they never did explain why she acted so shady or if she was the Watchdog as the one from the first season. She just gave up on her colony drop plan and disappear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get a loli Makai Priestess in season 2</br>  <br> Watchdog-chan. <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Baka</br>  <br>Was it just me or did anyone elses eyes burn whenever this bitch was on screen? It seems those scenes had really increased brightness and no dark colours to contrast her against.</br>  <br>You should get non-pussy eyes</br>  <br>You would enjoy Goldstorm</br>  <br>I've been going through the original series recently and that seems to be the case whenever Watchdog Central appears. Kind of a visual gimmick.</br>  <br>That would be cute, Heian era no less so she'll probably be wearing those oversize kimono that drag along the floor.<br><br>Probably Funi's fault.</br></br></br>  I really don't see why women can't be Makai Knights. It felt like a dumb excuse to keep them out of armor when they could kick ass like the others do. Just give a chick some armor already.  <br>Funi can't into contrast and overly saturates the fuck out of their videos. This started since Zankyou no Terror.</br>  <br>It's actually to do with their physiology, females cannot physically use Soul Metal without it burning them.</br>  <br> Probably Funi's fault. <br>If someone's watching FUNi shit, they deserve it. Why would you not wait for Whynot?</br></br>  <br>Flagging the colors in their encodes wrong was the problem. <br>HS fixed that this season, so while they are still FUNi shit, the colors are not as fucked up.</br></br>  <br>They literally explains this in Beast of the Midnight Sun. Women don't have the ability to use or don soul-metal armor that Makai Knights do.</br>  <br>My eyes are pretty pussy but pic related was on another fucking level, I couldn't wait for her to get offscreen. Except most of the time it was much worser when she was sitting in front of a white background, she's probably related to solaire because she is fucking grossly incandescent.</br>  <br>Discussion? The airing thread is always the most active.</br>  I miss shitty dad  <br>A quick temporary solution is on CCCP. Go to render settings, and under output range select 16-255. It'll help the contrast issue a bit.</br>  <br>But why? That's so retarded. Why does having a vagina burn them? Does the soul metal not work if you bleed out your cooch?<br><br>It's just stupid.</br></br></br>  <br> PRAISE THE SUN! <br><br><br>That or just use madvr and press something like ctrl+alt+shift+i</br></br></br></br>  <br> This started since Zankyou no Terror. <br>No, this started since their first simulcast</br></br>  <br>Same reason why in the real world women make inferior soldiers to men. They aren't as physically capable and women's bodies are more attuned as well to the ying-yang of the universe that Horrors use to move through Makai to Sekai.<br><br>Same reason why they can't be suitable as Makai Knights is why women are more likely to be possessed by Horrors.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's a fantasy world and those are the rules, you fucking idiot.</br>  <br>No, its because Women have more Yin in their body, which is what the horrors are made up of. Men are made up of Yang, which is why they can wield Soul Metal and resist turning into a horror for 99 seconds when they summon the armor</br>  <br> Hurr I'll just fuck prostitutes and pretend to be morally superior while my son is put into life or death situations and then I blame him for his pent up anger. <br><br>Leon was right in calling him a shitty dad, when anime characters say that they're not usually serious but he legitimately was a piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Women can't handle soul-metal, it burns them like it does Horrors although not as extensively. In one of the later seasons, I believe either Rekka fucks up her arm just temporarily wielding the blade of her dead dad and had to have his arm bone or something magically crafted on just to use it temporarily.</br>  <br>Women have more Yin than men. Horrors are made out of Yin.<br><br>It's why the most powerful Horrors are women. Messiah, Ganon, Eiris, Anima all have the form of females.</br></br></br>  <br>Garo was originally suppose to be a live action magical girl series, so I'm thinking girls only being Priestesses came from that.</br>  <br>It's a new girl from Black Blood, not Rekka.</br>  <br>That was a different character actually</br>  There's a panel with anime Garo's director Hayashi Yuuichirou and Shaman Kings' author Hiroyuki Takei (who helped with the character designs) later today. So we're probably getting more info.<br><br>Incidentally, Maruyama just said on his panel that he wants to work on Shaman King (and Kenshin), so it's interesting to see he's already working with the author.</br></br>  <br>He's the point of view character since the mc knows tons of stuff that the viewer doesn't. <br><br>Only he also gets a lot of development and plot importance afterwards in addition to that. <br><br>The only thing Tendo has on him in the end, putting him above Kagami as far as actual focus goes, are the toys.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're thinking of that girl from Black Blood.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Ameiya never said that.<br><br><br><br><br>Also this. Women are filled with Yin energy, mean are filled with Yang energy. Horrors are attuned to Yin and the most powerful of the Horrors especially the Apostle Horrors like Messiah and Karma have female forms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even with all the toys, its Kagami that saves his life and helps him finish the final boss</br>  <br>I had a boner too many times because of Rekka and Jabi's legs to remember the finer details.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Shit, I thought people were joking when they said Garo was literally power rangers.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Do you eat shit?</br>  <br>Are you the same faggot that was constantly popping up in Garo thread calling it a Dark Souls ripoff?</br>  <br> Power Rangers <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah. Rekka, Jabi, and Emma are totally inferior to the rest. I'd sure like those two useless knights from the 3rd season to help. Have you not seen the shit some women in Garo do? It is absolutely on par with the guys.<br><br><br>So I can't complain if a rule in a fantasy series is completely arbitrary and fucking stupid? You must be a fun guy to be around.<br><br><br>That is completely nonsensical.<br><br>The point is that it's a conscious decision to not have women be knights in this series. It's not a fucking rule of nature, someone consciously had it be that women couldn't be knights because they're filled with what Horrors are made of? No one has a problem with this?<br><br>Look, The first 2 Garo series is some of my favorite toku, and I'm not saying this series is bad. I just think the whole Yin bullshit is dumb and completely unnecessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Any good batch torrents or places where I can watch the live-action Garo series from the beginning? Never got into them, but definitely interested to do so now.  <br>First I've heard of this comparison</br>  <br> Two useless knights from the third season <br>I can't really argue with that, Jabi, Rekka, and Emma, hell even Rian are way cooler than those two  Their armor has pretty nice designs though </br></br>  <br>Torrent is going to be hard with the lack of seeders. Best just go with the mega:<br/></br>  <br>Unfortunately, a lot of people seem to think that. I saw comments on the anime before calling it "Power Rangers for adults" and "furry Power Rangers". Funnily enough, I see this reaction way less with the Toku</br>  <br>Rian even killed the mastermind behind the whole thing. What did those two chucklefucks even accomplish?</br>  <br>Are you a dumb SJW refguee from tumblr? Its the reason why women are not Makai Knights, because they possess and are attuned to the same energy in the Garo universe that Horrors are, ergo they can not wear Makai Armor to become Makai Knights.<br><br>Its not a superiority issue, its simple biological fact by the creator to explain why men are the Knights and women can only be Makai Priestesses. Get over it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like Garo invented yin and yang.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Woah, Calm down fuccbois, it was a tongue-in-cheek comment , not to mention it literally is sentai.Can you look at that webm <br>and tell me with a straight face that you haven't seen that in power rangers?<br> over designed monster of the week get's blown the fuck out with shitty special effects and fags in suits. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool, thanks. What's the order that I have to watch these in?</br>  <br>They helped Ryuga kill Zedom, thats about it. They're not even in Goldstorm, despite it being a sequel to YamiTera</br>    <br>Takeru saved Ryuga from the last seed. And both helped in the final fight.</br>  <br> Not loving Garo monster designs <br>What are you, some kind of faggot?</br></br>  <br>See  I went with chronological order.</br>  <br>  Women are more attuned to the same energy as these shape shifting parasites <br>  biological fact <br><br>You deserve some kind of award for a comment this stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its tells me you haven't watched Garo or Super Sentai. Nice b8 desu.<br><br><br>That's what the franchise has repeatedly told us in the TV series and movies, so yes in the Garo universe they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>God their relationship was so adorable at times, that scene made me so happy</br>  <br>Original series&gt;Beast of the Midnight Sun&gt;Red Requiem&gt;Kiba Gaiden&gt;Makai Senki&gt;Lament of the Dark Dragon&gt;The one who shines in darkness&gt;Flower of Makai&gt;Gold Storm<br><br>You can watch Zero Black Blood and Tougen Floute at any point after you're done with Lament of the Dark Dragon.</br></br></br>  <br>Kiba Gaiden is also pretty much optional. Watch it if you really liked the villain of the first season but it doesn't need to be watched for Makai Senki</br>  <br>Why are they so lewd?</br>  <br>It's the same as saying women can't be knights because space wizards live in their wombs and turn into ravenous goblins if they fart in the same room as soul metal. It's a terrible excuse and one that doesn't need to exist.<br><br>Fuck, why not just say armor is passed down to sons in a male tradition? I'd actually be fine with that. It fits better with the theme of an ancient order and doesn't need to have that yin nonsense to justify it.</br></br></br>  <br>It sounds like you need to go back to tumblr.</br>  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br>  <br>If the stars align and we get some kind of new Shaman King anime in the future I will flip a pool in joy</br>  <br>In public aswell, such a lewd couple.  I bet they're being super romantic in whatever dimension they are. </br>  <br>It does introduce Ganon, though.</br>  <br>Makai Knights are passed down in bloodlines from father to son, typically. That doesn't change the fact Horrors are attracted and most typically attuned with women and the most powerful Horrors have always been female.<br><br>The concept of yin and yang and its effect on humans with the Makai Order has been explained since the original series. Get the fuck over it.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you seen Bond Kouga?</br>  <br> I wonder if scarf Kouga has made a return in that dimension  Not gonna lie I really want a movie about Kouga fighting in that dimension to find Kaoru </br>  <br><br>Uh-oh folks. Someone here doesn't think like us! Better tell him to go back to tumblr. That' ll show him we're not insecure whenever someone has issues with a show we like.</br></br>  <br>Did you really have to stir some unnecessary discussion? Why did you feel obligated to?</br>  <br> I don't like a well discussed and explained concept in a fictional universe that isn't tailored to my exact specifications or suspension of disbelief <br> I know I'll act like a faggot regardless of being told why I'm being dumb <br>Good to know you're an idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm arguing over the fact that rule even exists, not WHY it exists. I know why the series says women can't be knights, but what I'm saying is that it's a stupid reason.<br><br>Garo lets women fight and do cool shit, so they don't just sit around like other shows. I just think why they can't be knights is completely unnecessary. That's it.</br></br></br>  <br>From the way it types, it seems like it's an angry woman from tumblr.</br>  <br><br> yin (jɪn) Also Yin, Yn. [Chinese yīn shade, feminine; the moon.] <br><br> a. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also attrib. or as adj., and transf. Cf. yang. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's your problem, not ours.</br>  <br><br>Actual good show with next to no BD sales gets a second season. Times be changing?</br></br>  <br>I get what you mean, the only thing I've seen on why Amemiya thought it up is that he couldn't come up with designs for female Makai Knights that he was actually satisfied with. Kinda of a dumb reason but thats the only thing I could find on it</br>  <br>pachinko money&gt;bd money</br>  <br>Nah, most of Garo's money comes from the Pachinko games.<br>Hell I think the music sold way better than the BDs.</br></br>  <br>Garo franchise never gives a shit about BD sales.</br>  <br>Garo makes bank off of figurines and pachinko sales, not disc sales. Always has, always will.</br>  I hope the MC is actually a trap.  <br>Aye, Kouga not being able to play cards is adorable. Kouga sure do a lot of different thing in Makai Senki.<br><br>Aye,  I just want to see what's happenening in that dimension and how is he did he manage to stay alive while protecting Kaoru without his armor. Would be amazing if Kaoru's painting skill can be use in support like in the first season's finale. <br><br>Thank the pachinko god.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That and figurines. The figurines and statues make a shit ton of money.</br>  <br>You don't need BD money when you have Pachinko money, a MONACA soundtrack and JAM Project for both your OP's.</br>  <br> they make a pachinko Horror <br> lose support from offended pachinko players <br> Garo tanks <br><br>I guess that's also why they don't have an idol Horror</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a MONACA soundtrack <br>That soundtrack is just too fucking amazing. I still listen to it sometimes, out of the blue, and get super fucking pumped.<br>I hope the soundtrack this time is even better.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he is great isn't he? Though I wish Rei was more involved in early Makai Senki then just the latter half. <br><br><br>It would just increase their sales. Garo is filled with meta stuff at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They did have a male idol got eaten by horror though.</br>  <br>PACHINKO<br>A<br>C<br>H<br>I<br>N<br>K<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pachinko Horror <br>Wouldn't that be even cooler? Everytime the player "win" the Horror is hurt,  but in the end the player will run out off money and the Horror will consume him , such is the life of a Makai Knight.<br><br>Since it's Heian I wonder if there's going to be a lot of traditional Japanese music.<br><br>Aye, a shame about Rei. I'm also a bit disappointed that there's no old Rei showing up to help Raiga fight in Flower, seeing how close Rei is to Raiga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Garo is filled with meta stuff at times. <br>That horror movie and manga episodes in Makai Hana are ones of the better episodes from that season.</br></br>  <br><br>I liked how in episode 4 of Makai Senki, the actor for the Poker Horror's human form, the gambler, is the same guy who played Kusaka in Kamen Rider Faiz.</br></br>  <br>Also a couple of whore horrors. (Whorrors?) <br>That fat one in YamiTera made me bust out laughing, that was hilarious.</br></br>  <br>The clown horror freaked the shit out of me.<br><br><br><br>Don't forget the Game Show Host Horror from the first season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tbf Rei did get atleast three episodes where he was the sole focus, none of the other secondary knights can really say that</br>  <br>I don't know why I feel the need to talk about something on a discussion board. Funny thing, that.<br><br><br>See, this is actually a good point. The Yin &amp; Yang concept I'm fine with. Garo talks about it a lot with the whole light and shadows business. But then why are the evil creatures attuned to the feminine Yin? Are there evil creatures associated with the Yang, or does somehow being part of the masculine universal energy keep you "good"? Horrors have been built up to not just be thses otherworldly creatures, but some sort of dark reflection of humanity. That they exist because humanity is evil and has a darker aspect to them. That horror Zagi even talked about Horrors being slaughtered for sport in a colosseum, talking about how the cruelty of mankind made them. It's not just dudes vs feminine monsters, it's the goodness of humanity versus our darker aspect.<br><br><br>I'm not saying anyone is wrong for liking the show, and I'm not saying you need to do anything about it or that you're wrong having your opinion. I just thought that there were other people on /a/ who thought the rule was dumb. But I guess not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I know it won't happen but I'd love to see that Makai Senki samurai in this.  <br>He has a miniseries dedicated to him and he shows up as the mentor and teacher for Kouga's son in S4.<br><br>Rei is as much a main character as Kouga is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel bad for mangaka Horror, the people he ate wasn't that good anyway. Now we just need anime, video game, and J-pop idol Horror to complete entertainment media Horror.<br><br>I would love to see a reference to that aswell, maybe we'll get to see the silver knight the Samurai saw as a boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Well it says right there that yin is dark and negative.</br>  Yay. Garo was secretly the best show of 2014, now we'll have even more of it.  <br>Fucking fantastic episode that one.</br>  According to Maruyama, the main character of the show is a genderbent version of Abe no Senmei.  <br>I guess that confirm it, it'll be a Makai priestess MC.</br>  <br> Seimei's duties included analyzing strange events, conducting exorcisms, warding against evil spirits, and performing various rites of geomancy. </br>  <br> genderbend <br>Aw hell no.</br></br>  So wait, the anime is going to not only have a new MC that's a female lead, but an entirely new cast as well? Is it set in the same time period as Carved Seal of Flames or not?<br><br> go from Medieval Garo in Not-Spain to Renaissance Garo in Not-Italy </br></br>  <br>Nah, it's Medieval Garo in Not-Japan. Or maybe actual Japan.</br>  <br>Heian period.</br>  <br>Nope, its set in the Heian period in Japan apparently</br>  <br><br><br>AMEIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br></br>  Will this be a huge time skip?<br>Because I want to see Leon as a mature and happy man.<br><br>Maybe this time the MC will be a female makai alchemist but Leon could be around as a recurrent character?</br></br></br>  <br>Leon and Alfonso are in Not-Spain<br>S2 is in Not-Japan<br><br>Unless Leon ends up with the S2 FeMC and knocks her up to explain how Garo transitions from Europe to Japan's Order of Makai Knights</br></br></br></br>  I can't fucking wait  <br> Will this be a huge time skip? <br>I'll assume that Honoo no Kokuin was set in the 700-1100's until further notice, and I doubt they'll avoid giving Leon &amp; co. plot relevance of some sort.</br></br>  <br><br>They really need to up the choreography already</br></br>  <br>I like to imagine that Anna's hellfire that consumed Mendoza at the end was actually meant for German for impregnating another woman.</br>  <br><br><br>I believe in everything you said, Satan and son</br></br></br>  <br> That part where he turns to the hellfire with a worried look and then whispers to Leon about Ximena </br>  <br> Satan and son <br> not Satan and Antichrist </br></br>  <br>Technically, everyone who opposes God is an Antichrist since "Satan" is the Hebrew to "adversary". <br>Also, Satan has many sons.</br></br>  That was weird, and it didn't help that the Archives are still dead.  <br> Not medieval europe <br> No more Leon and Alfonso <br> female MC </br></br></br>  Is Rui in the right about Crowds? Is the potential for good even worth the risk? Crowds seems like a great tool for multitasking and manual labor, but I don't really see the point of how it's supposed to bring everyone together and 'evolve'.  <br>In universe, the potential for good has already been shown to be worth the risk. Everything went more or less well for two years, unless we are about to find out X has hidden the real crimes.</br>  <br>Wasn't that stated in a episode? That Rui and X snuff out any crime or incidents involving Crowds before it gets media coverage.</br>  <br>The way the put it in the episode it seemed more like X was doing a bit of moderating and putting a stop to things before they got nasty.<br>But I mean, you get crimes and incidents without crowds, too.</br></br>  Assholes exist everywhere and they will always misuse or abuse tools. The "bad" guy in this new season is just an example of extremist.  post hajimes  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br/></br>  <br>That's absolute disgusting. Why would you even save that?</br>  <br> Green hair Rui <br>Why does Rui look good in everything? <br><br>Also, what is this illustration for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea, sorry.<br><br><br>This is kind of cute, but doesn't look a bit like Hajime and most importantly why the fuck would you post that here?</br></br></br></br>  <br>These fucking tumblr landwhales trying to feel better about their own disgusting bodies by making healthy characters into fat asses</br>  <br>Why is Rizumu with them? Do I need to worry for Ruirui's safety?</br>  <br>A bit late for that!</br>  New episode preview images.<br><br>Why is he so smug?</br></br>    Is it Gatcha time already?  <br>Not yet. Just about a day.</br>    <br>G-Gerurururu....<br><br>Holy shit, another reason why I should start collecting Tomicas</br></br></br>  An argument against using Crowds would also need to address why using cars isn't just as bad, they're pretty much multi-ton murder machines if you want to use them that way. <br><br>(and before /k/ stumbles in, no, guns aren't similar, they have much more limited utilitarian uses outside of killing shit)</br></br>    <br>I like that they have the same outfits as last season, but at the same time I wonder if we'll ever get to see Rui's cute new blue outfit again</br>  <br>I want this.</br>  Leave it to Gelsadra.  <br>give 4chin the power of crowds.<br>what do you think would happen?</br></br>  <br>That doesn't sound fishy at all.</br>  <br>They'd get turned into cubes by superior numbers of normalfags the instant they try to start shit?</br>  <br>Where did you find this image? Maybe there's more information about it in the page.</br>  <br> Is Rui in the right about Crowds? <br>Hajime is the indicator. She is always right, so if she stopped, that was the right thing to do. Tsubasa and Gel made a mistake. Actually, everyone made a mistake, since Gel action was supposed to be what people wished for.</br></br>  <br>Look, I'm obviously not Gelsadra posting here while pretending to be a reasonable anon expressing his opinion for the purpose of luring more people into her supposed trap, yet I find her awesome and think nothing could go wrong with her.</br>  <br/>  <br>niggers start organized CROWDS fights and bet money</br>  <br>Hilariously stupid and useless shit.</br>  <br>It was a repost, I tried reverse image search but I didn't find anything.</br>  <br> I don't really see the point of how it's supposed to bring everyone together and 'evolve'. <br><br>When you mention evolution, you forget that Evolution is not about everyone surviving together. Evolution is an exclusionary process that promotes efficiency and meritocracy with a blend of ruthlessness and natural random number generator because in nature, random chance can still occur to topple the most qualified creature.<br><br>Crowds will help distinguish those who can move on. It's a tool that helps widen the gap to the point where it becomes more obvious who is more capable and who is not. Unfortunately, there will be a shake out period in the beginning as the evolutionary process occurs where bad users are evolved out of the pool of all_users.</br></br></br></br></br>  What I don't understand is why this crowds shit is being rehashed again as the focal point of the season. Is this not what season 1 was all about?  <br>S1 was about the mess and katze mostly, now that the humanity has "evolved", they want to show the next step in how to use crowds responsibly? But I kinda agree its somewhat like in the first season too. New gatcha and the alien better be useful.</br>  <br>theyd find a way to make loli crowds</br>  <br><br>Anime is called Gatchaman Crowds.</br></br>  Would you buy him if he came out in pvc?  <br>I thougt it was called Gatch-WUB WUB WUB</br>  <br>Of course, the crowds need something to make them into a proper gatchaman. World peace, etc. will be achieved next  yeah right. </br>  Car Graffiti JK Chapter 2 just for y/o/u/  <br> me in charge of forgetting to translate that thing in the margin <br>sorry.</br></br>  <br>Reading c1. Super cute. Thanks anon!</br>    What do you think of fansub in various languages? I'm italian and i hate italian subs.<br>  Very slow groups (people have a life, so they need a week to translate HS sub file) <br>  Hardsub everywhere  <br>  Tons of timing/grammatical errors <br>  A lot of groups don't use torrent. They use stupid host sites that delete the episodes after a week  <br>  189747894494 groups sub Naruto and One Piece, while no groups care about other better series </br></br></br></br></br>   Wakanim and ADN are slowly killing french fansub teams <br>Thank god I still have english subs.</br>  <br> people have a life <br>Those are the worst types of people</br></br>   Tons of timing errors <br>How do you fuck this up? It's literately the easiest part of subtitling. Time consuming? Maybe if you haven't done it a bunch. But once you learn some shortcuts it's easy as fuck.<br><br>Literately every time I start timing an episode I wonder, "Will they replace me with a monkey today? Why do they need me? I shouldn't have this job."</br></br></br>  <br> Turkish sub ''groups'' <br> no styling <br> nothing at all <br> translated HS release from english <br><br>Thank fucking god I can speak English.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are there any decent French groups with timely releases? I might as well get some use out of it for once, since Funi's wrecked this whole season.</br>  <br>Most of the time they simply translate the lines in the subs' file without retiming, not considering that different languages don't flow in the same way.</br>  Well<br>I'm Russian and I use only English subs for anime because I really dislike Russian subs, the language is constructively different and you have to fluctuate like a mad dog to make it sound natural which most every group I saw fails to do and it just looks retarded and out of place, not to mention that it would be a translation of English subs either way and they are not accurate 70% of the cases so trying to translate them will lose any track of what it was supposed to be.</br>  <br> Translating translations <br><br>Yeah, they need to knock that shit off. <br><br>Especially when you have groups that localize conversations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai provato subs italiani, mi sento molto più infantile se guardo cartoni con sottotitoli nella mia lingua. In inglese è meno imbarazzante, non capisco come mai.</br>  I rarely bother to look for them. I have some downloaded or otherwise watched and some of them are good, like pic related. But then I see spelling errors. Or they can't even fucking put spaces around correctly, which triggers my autism.  I don't even bother checking the quality of subs in Polish. I'm pretty sure they just translate english subs from legit groups.  <br> mfw watching/reading hentai in native language <br>Never gain</br></br>   ED is in english <br> character says something in engrish <br> gets translated in native language </br></br>  <br>OH JESUS. I can't even bring myself to go "sì sì sì" during sex, I wonder if it would work better in english?</br>  <br>Not to mention they're available only on streaming sites anyway, at least as far as I know.</br>  <br>Same.

Hell, sometimes you would still find sentences in English. Worst case was Kast-fs who I suspected weren't actually translating themselves but just putting shit through Google translate and checking the different options to translate a word if the sentence made no sense.<br><br>I like fansubs because there's a fair amount of shows that wouldn't get here without them but you gotta admit they're not always doing that good of a job.</br></br></br>  <br> everyone is buttblasted about subs being OCRd and stolen <br>It seems that most fansubbers only care about "muh translations do not steal" that are translated from english anyway.</br></br>  <br> falling bridges <br> falling stadiums <br> killing reporters and their families <br> murderers and robbers everywhere <br> even the fucking cops <br> nobody knows a second language, not even english which is easy mode <br> not even the guys inside the stadium that were there to guide people from all over the fucking world during the fucking world cup <br> the receptionist at a 5 stars hotel could barely speak broken english <br> a guy at a drugstore didn't even knew basic math and gave me 2 reales instead of one <br>huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehu<wbr>ehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehueh<wbr>uehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue<wbr>huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehu<wbr>ehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehueh<wbr>uehuehuehuehuehue<br><br><br><br> 50mb <br>kek</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't like watching subs in Spanish, they are usually translations from Funi (which is awful per se), and that screws the timing up.<br><br>Every now and then I find some nice stuff in spic subs, though.</br></br>  <br><br> the big opening stadium now is used to store buses <br> meanwhile they still lack a lot of money for even basic health and shit </br></br></br>  <br>Would this be the Spanish equivalent of English troll subs? Or are they just retarded?</br>  <br>My sides.</br>  <br>That's just...oh my fucking god</br>  <br>mierda tio joder!<br><br>The problem with spanish subs is that we can't stand the different variations of the language. Spaniards hate how latinos speak and latinos hate how spaniards speak. And all of us hate how mexicans speak.<br><br>So getting decent releases with a neutral non cringe inducing spanish is hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that BR?</br>  What is obectively the worst Spanish accent?  <br>Looks like shitty Spanish to me.</br>  <br>Spanish from Spain.</br>  Ukrainian subs and dubs are rare, and I hope dubs will stay such. There are tons of ukrainian manga translations on the other hand. I even tried to contribute into translating Yotsuba, but I completely suck at moon.<br><br> Watching Bible Black with ukrainian subs was boner killing.  </br></br>  <br>Chilean, bolivian or mexican.</br>  Are there any Dutch subs? I think I found like one by accident for Kokoro Connect, but that's all I've found. I'm not searching that much, but still.  <br>keks waren gegeven</br>  <br>To kill streaming you need to kill fansubs first.</br>  <br>waarom zijn alle nederlanders 9faggers en kek posters.</br>  <br>I tried fansubbing the first K-on episode when it was first released. Was just a translation of the English subs, got the timing and stuff pretty good, didn't know how to turn it into an actual video file though. So I gave up, I think I still have the files on my old PC.<br>If you're looking for actual dutch fansubs, there's sleepsub.<br>http://www.sleepsub.nl/<br>No idea what the quality is like though, like most Dutch viewers, I watch anime with English subs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did they have to put La Sola as BG theme, while reading words like anal, esperma, bolas, etc?<br><br><br>I don't know if you are the spic that was talking shit about Latinos, but it's mostly true. There are thousands of wholehearted weaboos, and almost no fucking body in my country (and in all Latin America can into proper Spanish, much less into proper English.<br><br><br><br>Not really. That character (and her parents or something like that) spoke in a weird Japanese dialect, and the guys from Natsuyoru had the (good, imo) idea of putting it as some sort of really low-life, thuggish Spanish. I found it hilarious, though I can see why people wouldn't like it. At first I cataloged it as "cani-speak" but then realized I know nothing about canis.<br><br><br>That is totally true. As someone earlier said, every subcontinent/country/region has its own expressions, and they all use them nonchalantly, thinking that everybody can understand what they mean.<br><br>Good thread, btw.<br>Also,<br> And all of us hate how mexicans speak. <br>You made me cough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>spanish from Spain</br>  <br>I don't see the need for dutch subs. You guys not only basically all speak english, you are probably the best speakers of english I have ever come across. I live in Canada but have travelled extensively through Europe and Central/East Asia and you guys are undoubtedly the best.</br>  <br>Hi /b/</br>  <br>the accent can be horrible though. During the killzone presentation (dutch developer) the guy could talk english fine but the accent was just so terrible. Or is thT not something foreigners notice that bad</br>  As far as I know, there are like two or three Hebrew sub sites for anime, and they just translate English fansubs.  <br> tfw nobody talks about the girl in OP's pic because she was from an irrelevant anime. </br>  <br>Watching nichibros in indon sub is fucking glorious. Like, ghost stories sub tier glorious.</br>  <br>I mean GS dub. They just went full retard with it.</br>  Spanish subs are shit specially AU and WZF.  <br>Chilean by far.</br>  <br>I'm born in a non shithole</br>  <br>There're still a shit-ton out there. Mostly because the average german anime viewer is streaming. The german Anime community is probably the worst I've ever experienced. Mostly because everyone is so fucking stupid, it hurts.<br>We don't have many good Fansub-groups, though. Nanaone is probably the only acceptable one. Because they can actually speak german not like the other 15 year olds who think their little english is enough for subbing. Kinda sad though, because german is a very nice language.</br></br>  <br>Nederlandse dubs zouden zowiezo minstens 1 van de twee landen kloten, gewoon door de keuze van het accent. Niemand die aan die nest wilt beginnen, denk ik.</br>  <br><br>It's been so long. Which episode was this from?</br></br>  <br> die nest <br>echt?</br></br>  <br>Spanish language subs are usually translated from English, and very badly at that. Eve if I can find a good Spanish group, all this year's using English subs make make everything I see in Spanish seem weird.</br>  Hebrew fansubs don't fucking exist. There's maybe one subgroup here that's still alive and they do one project a year at best.  spanish subs are ok if you are not watching airing anime  <br>Don't know about OP's but mine was from the first episode.</br>  <br>SO MUCH THIS</br>   brazilian subs <br>They are the best</br>  <br>I watched Full Metal Panic fansubbed by Nanime and it was kinda cute seeing anime subbed in Finnish. Strange but pleasant.</br>  <br>Not enough 'huehuehue' or threats of reporting.</br>  <br> spanish subs <br>my god I was forced to learn english as fast as I could, to get away from that trash.<br>even tough my english is shit, it´s still better than watching spanish fansubs. they don´t even speak correctly their own language.<br>it´s like watching gg/commie but in spanish. yeah it was THAT BAD!</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is a new group making subs from Pokémon XY. I asked them if they translate from Japanese but they said they just translate English fansubs.</br>  <br>As others ITT have said, you forgot the worst element that makes reading most subs hell on Earth: they just translate English subs badly, losing most of the Japanese meaning AND making mistakes since they're shit at English<br> "it can't be helped" translated as if the verb help actually means help <br> "anything but" translated as if that's normal, adversative "but" <br> constantly fucking up better sounding expressions because they of the middleman <br> weird translations for itadakimasu because English doesn't have "buon appetito" even if Italian does <br> characters who have a more serious or ancient speech lose it <br>And that's how I started downloading English subs only</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everything in the internet that's not in english is a worsened version of what's available in english.<br/>  <br>You forgot the worst thing<br><br> Non un congiuntivo corretto </br></br></br>  <br> Anão, que bom que você me lembrou desse thread 10/10 </br>  Threads like these make me realize how good we used to have it when cartel was still alive.  <br>Really? What are they called?</br>  <br> Pantatku </br>  I literally never used subs in any other language but english and i'm portuguese. I mean for what purpose would I use them if english ones are always the fastest and have the best quality  <br> I literally never used subs in any other language but english <br><br>Same.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck italian subs<br><br> company gets rights to anime <br> oops the sub is illegal now we're removing it ;^) <br> except it doesn't fucking matter and it's illegal whether a company has the rights or not <br> don't even offer separate sub files, which are completely legal as long as you get the raw yourself <br><br>and to top it off<br><br> translated from english, often wrong <br> can't encode properly for shit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these faggots starting with their mother language subs first <br>its like someone shits out subs, then the second translator ate the shit and shat it out a second time. Which is then what you consume</br>  <br>This is pretty close.</br>  <br>that's so fucking accurate for the current times</br>  <br>Spain or meheeco</br>  <br>Pokemon Heb Area<br>They are up to episode 31. I think I'll check their first episode just for laughs.</br></br>   2015 <br> still watching anime with subs <br><br>Fucking plebs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Really? Care to give example of some good groups?<br>I'm honestly curious now. From my experience, it's usually English to Indonesia translation and even worse, it's literal translation.</br></br></br>  <br>I know.<br>Dub only for me.</br></br>   dubs of anime into dead languages <br>so fucking hilarious.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lEO<wbr>caevfAMI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of this</br>   so used to english that I can't even read or watch anything subbed in my native language cause it just doesn't feel right anymore <br>I-I can't be the only one, right?</br>  <br>They translated from english.</br>  <br>how can you know how to pronounce a language that is dead.</br>  <br>afaik contemporary speakers of classical latin wrote what it sounded like or some shit.</br>  <br>A good translation would be "on ne peut rien y faire", "ça ne peut pas etre aidé" doesn't make any sense. I don't know how you can translate a serie and let meaningless sentences like that pass, I could never let my name by associated with low quality work like that.</br>  <br> weird translations for itadakimasu because English doesn't have "buon appetito" even if Italian does <br>This, it's the same for french sub. Just translate it "bon appétit" not "Merci pour le repas" or some retarded shit you'll never heard in real life.</br></br>    <br>I feel embarrassed to be French just by reading this, I can't believe I used to watch these shitty releases.<br> http://zeuchteam.free.fr/ <br>My sides.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of this. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xqn<wbr>vSaiEQkw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> esperanto <br>ew.</br></br>  <br>there's a russian fandub of yuru yuri done entirely by one guy</br>  <br>Cuba77?</br>  <br> Cuba77 <br>I looked up this guy and I got this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=10&amp;<wbr>v=HgFkGFsMmwE</wbr>  [ ]<br>I had a similar thing when I downloaded Azumanga Daioh. The second audio track was in Russian and it was just one girl talking for all the characters. Weird stuff</br></br></br>   not getting puyasubs <br>Spanish CR is actually decent and doesn't have epic memes like most english subs.</br>  <br>But still has the shitty streaming quality</br>  the hebrew fansub in general is fucking terrible.  <br>Yeah that's the only downside, can be fixed with a good PC though.</br>  <br>This season I noticed that a couple of episodes of some anime (CR Spanish) had typical mistakes from translation Eng-Spa, which made me think they had hired a new guy and he fucked up. Since then, I haven't spotted blatant errors, those subs are usually pretty good.</br>  <br>This seems like bullshit</br>  <br> seems </br>  <br>Most errors come from the European version, I remember Vanadis having a shit load of errors. the Version for Latin America are always good and I never noticed errors on them, I don't watch all the in that version though, so maybe they have some fuck ups too.</br>  <br>Some subs are okay in spanish, but those streaming sites are literally cancer. That's why I prefer english subs to spanish ones.</br>  <br>Definetly Chile. Spain is okay but not for a long talk.</br>  Ok /a/ I just finished watching Oreimo.

Kyosuke rejecting all the girls and breaking social norm just to be "lovers for a limited time" and "enjoy themselves to the fullest" (which by the way never get to see) until both graduate?

I never understood bounties.</br>  <br>Depends on the current market value of hath and credits.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/836133/ef6de6<wbr>3f85/</wbr>  <br>That is something I also don't understand. I just keep H@H running and enjoy the rewards. Past that I'm lost.</br>  <br><br>Meh it's just luck of the draw, hoping a translators who cares about the work/artist/fetish happens to see your bounty. The higher the reward the better but mostly you rely on being lucky.<br><br>No one does whole tank translations for bounties, no matter how high the reward but I've had simple average length bounties sit untouched for ages even with high rewards.</br></br></br></br>  <br> oppai loli <br> trashman.jpg </br></br>  <br>Well yeah for tanks, but that isn't a tank, its just one relatively short chapter.</br>  <br>As a translator and editor, the rewards are *completely* meaningless to me. I don't buy anything with hath or GP or whatever. I don't see the point, honestly, though if I have hath I'll spend it on some perk that interests me to some degree. The only bounties I take are ones that I think are pretty hot and would have wanted to do anyway. <br><br>Also, no transparent bubbles, ever ever.</br></br></br>  <br> not using MS paint to crudely white out the transparent bubble and write the translation on it <br>its like you actually have standards.</br></br>  <br> No one does whole tank translations for bounties <br>http://g.e-hentai.org/bounty.php?bi<wbr>d=11432</wbr></br></br>  <br>So are you saying high hath rewards interest you?<br><br>Or not?<br><br>Either way, I get that bounties aren't important to most translators, but they do work sometimes, I think. Either way, its really the only means available to me until I start a new job at which point I could pay for translations I guess. But got so many untranslated things on the back burner already to commission.<br><br><br>Damn thats cheap for 160 pages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Been a while since I last checked bounties.<br><br>It surprises me someone really thinks anyone is going to pick up http://exhentai.org/g/706110/895744<wbr>30ed/ for translation. And it's even is a top translation bounty.</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> edgy </br>  <br> NTR all over the place <br> not edgy </br></br>  This thread had potential, and now I'm just back to fapping to traps and cucks. <br><br>Thanks again /a/</br></br>  <br>If they offer nothing but credits, I don't even register the bounty. Hath is all I look at, but even then, it doesn't matter too much. It's purely decided by "do I want to do this? is the work hot?" etc. Bounties are still better than nothing, though, because there's such a fucking hue quantity of un translated material and bounties are like lighthouses for pointing out certain gems.<br><br>Speaking of which, what kind of things do you want to commission? <br><br>I don't have standards but I translate on commission 90% of the time and doing sub optimal stuff like that makes me feel like a crook.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That pencil thin neck is fucking offputting</br>  <br> I don't have standards [...] doing sub optimal stuff like that makes me feel like a crook. <br>baka</br></br>  <br>Lots of things.

Which is harder these days because Wani, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I don't have standards but I don't providing sub-par work for OTHER people.<br><br>When I do non-commission work I don't have standards. When I do commission work I give myself standards to follow so I don't feel bad about taking money. It's kind of like, I myself don't mind eating cheap and bad food, but if someone paid me to make food, I'd definitely try to make better stuff for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I love his cute and funny stuff, but I'll be damned if I can deal with his really dark stuff.</br>  Any manga with android banging chicks?  <br>Why does adding new works to one of my favorites categories when using thumbnail mode occasionally make recent existing added works completely ignore timestamp order? For example, yesterday when I added around 10 new tankoubons to the category, it caused the row above the one I was currently archive downloading to move 2 rows down. This row now has works all ranging from 2 hours to 7 days younger than the works on the row above it, which is completely retarded. I'm pretty sure I have missed entire rows of works while archiving because of this timestamping issue.</br>  <br>Sounds very odd. You're better off making a bug report to Tenboro.</br>    <br>where the fuck would you even get a little green dick</br>  <br>Anon, do you know what a dildo is?</br>  <br>LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT DICK!

WHAT HAS BECOME OF HUMANITY?!?</br>  <br>but it's like 1 inch long<br>it has the girth of a normal mouse wire for christs sake</br></br>  <br><br>Gotta have'm in child size</br></br>  <br>Oh, I've had the same shit happen. I believe it's because galleries with "wide" thumbnails (as in their width &gt; height) can't be positioned normally with "tall" thumbnailed galleries, so they kinda go where they fit.<br>Look at these, my trap &amp; shota favorites, for example.</br></br>  <br><br> Keikoku no Elf <br><br>It's not fair to be that cute AND a boy</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're better off making a bug report to Tenboro. <br>I have no idea how to do that. Anyways, it seems to only be an issue on thumbnail display, where ALL of the works in the category are completely jumbled up in comparison to the timestamps of list display. You can test it out yourself if you'd like. I'll just stick to list display while archive downloading, since thumbnail display seems to be completely fucked.</br></br>  <br>Oh, that's terrible for archive downloading then. I wish I had known about this sooner then, so I wouldn't feel so paranoid about having potentially missed works while archiving.</br>  <br>Just PM him on the forums.

What's the consensus on part 5? I can understand people not liking Giorno as much as other JoJo's because he only really got good development and shows of personality early on and essentially did nothing afterwards but I feel the last third or so of the part really made up for it.<br><br>The epilogue with the marble ball is honestly one of my favorite parts of all of JoJo, I thought it was absolutely genius. What do people generally think of it?<br><br>Also, one other question which I'd like as minimalistic answer as possible as I don't know the full details yet but  I'm aware of the universe reset in part 6 but only that there is one and not any details. Does it leave a bad taste in your mouth when you read it? Because I can't help but feel really bad that every part up to 6 was literally wiped from existence, it's heartbreaking to think it was all for nothing. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The wryyy at the end fucking lol</br>  What are the chances of a Part 4 adaption? When do you think we'll know?    <br>They'll tease with a TBC arrow on the last BD and then debut a trailer at Jump Festa in december.</br>  Oh shit, it's Alternate Dio time, isn't it?  Homosexual pastor arrived  <br>You feel really wrecked anon, but the next universe is still JoJo. Part eight is wonderful (part seven is too) and honestly part six has one of the coolest character arcs for the main JoJo. I'd start it after a break for a day or two though.</br>  <br>Oh, you misunderstand. I forgot that he can't fix himself.<br>I didn't mean anything lewd, but any guy would tap the chance to magically make his dick bigger if he could, even a decent guy like Josuke. You know that's a guy thing, and Josuke has his "dudebro" moments, too.</br></br>  <br>Gay priest<br>Queer padre<br>Fag cleric<br>Homophile preacher</br></br></br></br>  <br> ORAORAORA WRYYYYYY <br><br>Are you shitting me?</br></br></br>  <br> dudebro moments <br><br>Josuke's half-English, ya dummy. He knows it's not all about the pussy game.</br></br></br>  <br>How did he get out of his hiding spot, grabbed the corpse and got out of sight in just 9 seconds or whatever?</br>  <br> in just 9 seconds <br>It's 5.<br> How? <br>Because it's Dio. <br>Dio seconds aren't the same as Earth seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>true, that's another element for basically all parts: JoJo is never really a guy who goes around, even though he could.<br>That goes for lots of other characters, too.<br><br>Man, JoJo plays in a too beautiful world.</br></br></br></br>  Guys, help.<br>as far as I remember, the 'agreed' most shit part was 5, right? because 5 manages to make me drop it pretty well.</br>  <br> JoJo is never really a guy who goes around <br><br><br>I actually really liked part 5. Sure, Giorno's uninteresting, but Bruno, the rest of the crew and the fights were all spectacular.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not admitting Joseph is a black sheep of the family, but the cool kind, not the "ignore that fag" kind. </br>  <br><br> Black sheep of the family <br><br>How is he more of a black sheep than Josuke or Giorno? He's one of the most JoJo. He's even one of the few that are called JoJo and one of the few with the last name Joestar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, I think he embodies the JoJo personality more than the humble Englishman or the autistic Japanese delinquent. Him being a slut is his only bad trait.</br>  <br> one of the few with the last name Joestar <br>3 Joestars<br>2 Kujos<br>2 Higashikatas<br>1 Giovanna</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If part 5 gets an anime and we get it, Golden Experiences name may not change.</br>  <br>Warner Bros. owns Prince, don't they?</br>  If you stab someone wearing an Aja'd Stone Mask with the Arrow, what happens?  <br>Yes, that's why. <br><br>Although I don't know if that means the movie division can freely use his copyright, does it?</br></br></br>  <br>Or the games, for that matter. It'd be strange to see the anime using Gold Experience and a new JoJo game using Golden Wind.</br>  <br>I don't think it counts for the games, because Bamco would still have to negotiate with WB, since WBG doesn't publish the games like they do the anime.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the Stone Mask and Arrow are basically the same thing except the Arrow is a more "complete" version as it gives a Stand.</br>  <br>It doesn't work that way. Whether they could or not, there's no way they'd prioritize Jojo over not potentially irritating such a big name artist.</br>  <br>So if the Aja'd mask turns Pillar Men into the Ultimate Lifeforms, does it turn humans into Pillar Men?</br>  <br>What happens if someone uses the Stone Mask twice?</br>  <br> the Stone Mask gives stands <br> the Arrow turns people into vampires <br><br>imagine the possibilities</br></br></br></br>  <br>3 Joestars<br>3 Kujos<br>1 Higashikatas<br>1 Giovanna<br>1 Kira</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guy has Stand as long as he's wearing the Mask. <br> Slams Mask onto his face, activating it by breaking his nose. <br> "Come on Fine Young Cannibals!" </br></br></br>  What would MiH Requiem do?<br><br> HEAVEN ON EARTH! </br></br>  <br>He wouldn't need it.

It took some of Part 3's elements where they spent the rest of the time trying to reach a certain place while the Villain kept sending stands to fight them every new chapter and it just got old for me real quick. <br><br>The group was great, especially Bruno. Honestly he really held up the entire part for me. I feel like Giorno's even more of a boring protagonist than Jotaro. The villain is easily the worst one in the series. And then the whole final arc where Araki just said fuck it and started killing random members and the whole body switching bullshit, and then the ending with Giorno winning by plot convenience thanks to the Arrow. <br><br>Not to say it doesn't have its highlights, there's a ton of great moments in part 5. But it just feels like one of the weaker parts to me.<br><br>  It also got some points taken off for treating my boy Polnareff like that. All he wanted was a peaceful life.  <br><br>As to your other question, the universe reset was a weird but nice ending in Part 6. Some very slight spoilers that don't matter in the long run but   The universe at the end of Part 6, and the universe that takes place in Part 7 and 8, are different ones.  <br><br>You'll understand it more when you finish part 6.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Why does Araki always pair up Giorno and Jolyne in his art?  Do you think Josuke ever found out about his secret admirer?  So, most important SC question<br>  OVA Voodoo Kingdom or Anime Voodoo Kingdom?<br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bPmlT<wbr>jjwsME</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=raOO9<wbr>8pwvnc</wbr>  [ ]<br/></br></br></br> </br>  <br> tried to fuck his stand <br>Is he the representation of /a/ if we had stands?</br></br>  <br><br>I feel the complete opposite. It starts off slow but keeps gaining steam and getting more and more bananas. It's easily better than SC.</br></br>  <br>Why does he shrink?</br>  <br>Original Voodoo Kingdom is much better. If you're going to do a MAD you might as well make it original instead of a bootleg version of one that already exists.</br>    <br> Because I can't help but feel really bad that every part up to 6 was literally wiped from existence, it's heartbreaking to think it was all for nothing. <br><br>That's not how the reset works.</br></br></br>  <br>The new one is shit because it doesn't have DIO saying ZA WARUDO. Fuck that.</br>  http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Part_VII<wbr>I:_JoJolion<br>Go to the Chapter section<br>Look at the Ultra Jump titles<br>Now compare them to the Volume titles<br>So much wasted potential. Never forget.</br></br></br></br></wbr>    What is his name again?  <br> eros is inevitable between Josuke and Yasuho <br><br>Is this romance eros or sex eros?</br></br></br>  <br>fat ass</br>  <br>jumpin jack flash</br>  <br>Oasis</br>  <br>All of them dying through natural means would be the same anyway. To me it honestly doesn't make a difference. At first I was devastated like you were, but I thought logically and came to the conclusion that it doesn't really mean anything or make a difference. What matters is what had happened in the past.</br>  reminder that Jolyne killed in cold blood a normal, non stand user human.  <br>You become a double vampire and/or a double ultimate lifeform.</br>  <br>I'd have killed him too shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit</br>  /r/ing the "Dick is good in your mouth, but have you tried the word of God?"    <br>Gimp Gelato</br>  <br>Requim stands aren't the normal stand's ability on crack. All requim is, is whatever the user needs at that moment.<br><br>Silver Chariot Requim didn't have the ability to stab things really really fast.</br></br></br>  Is JoJo a meme manga?  <br>Danke, I had lost my image</br>  <br>No, I'd say you're a year too late to say that.</br>  <br><br>For the life of me I can't remember. Who?</br></br>  (Keep in mind I'm only like halfway through Part 5)<br><br>Why is Mista the best Part 5 character?<br><br>Also why is Mista the one that goes out and does fucking everything in part 5 (so far that I've read) but is relegated to being a background character?</br></br></br></br>  <br>her lawyer</br>  <br><br> Lawyers <br> Human <br><br>Knife-eared cunt had it coming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, she straight up strangles him and causes him to crash his car.</br></br>  <br><br>Every Passione member except Fugo carries their weight.</br></br>  <br>He can't use Crazy D on himself you twat.</br>  <br>Okay, I suspected I just wasn't far enough in and that seems to be the case</br>  <br><br>Mista is great and all, but he's one of the least helpful members. Defeated less enemies than Narancia, Giorno and Bruno and wasn't crucial to solving the mystery like Abbachio.</br></br>  <br>It's a shame he dies.</br>  <br>As I've seen so far it really feels like he's the one with the any initiative, as he goes out first, does shit, then gets fucked up because everyone else is waiting around or trying to catch up, regardless of how many people he's defeated, however I've only read about halfway so I'm sure this will change, it just really sticks out for the first half to me<br><br><br>It's a shame I don't care about spoilers</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a shame I don't care about spoilers <br>I'm bullshitting, don't worry. I can't really remember who dies, as well.</br></br>  <br><br>this is my favorite jojo meme</br></br>  <br>Narancia, Bruno and Abbachio die. Giorno, Mista and Trish are the only ones who survive, while Polnareff becomes a turtle. Fugo lives too, obviously, but you don't see him at the end.</br>  <br> Gio is so boring! He never really expresses himself! <br><br>Not saying this is you, but do people just skip the first 3 chapters where it outright says Giorno is eerily serene as fuck, and how many parallels it shoves in your face that he's basically "Dio gone good"?<br><br>Of fucking course Giorno is going to stick in the background until the very end,  that's exactly how Dio was in Part 3 god damnit anons use some critical fucking thinking </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio wasn't the main character of Part 3 and his mystery was the whole point of it.</br>  Post your favorite "Oh SHIT" moments in Jojo  <br><br>I think a lot of the problem is the bad translation as well. Apparently there's a lot of quirks in the way that each character speaks that is completely lost in the translation. Despite that Part 5 still has my favourite supporting cast. Passione Clan aint nothing to fuck with.</br></br>  <br>I never got why DIO needed to be so mysterious. We all knew who DIO was in part 1, the mystery was just his stand.</br>    <br>Congratulations, anon! You're almost realizing the the point! Just a little more thought and you'll finally understand the entire point of Giorno's character and why he wasn't at the foreground 90% of the time!<br><br><br>That too. In the Japanese text, Giorno sounds EXACTLY like Dio, and talks just as formal and polite as he does. Everyone is unnerved at first by it, but eventually "comes under his spell".<br><br>Giorno is an incredibly subtle character that I think most people ignore because they don't expect this kind of shit in JoJo, and just want Wacky Stand Adventures: The Series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think you just posted it. Jolyne getting turned inside out, the moebius heart, Pucci massacring EVERYBODY and SNAILAGEDDON are all up there. Part 6 was just one baffling moment after another. <br><br>And of course pic related and SPACE RIPPA STINGY EYES are golden.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked that mysterious. It made it feel like a completely different Dio. <br><br>Dio in part 1 was cunning and mostly an asshole, For the moments we saw Dio in Part 3 he was more mysterious and intimidating. Especially since everyone in Part 3 kept hyping him up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can someone post Weather Reports subsequent pose?</br></br>    <br>Talking about this?</br>  <br> Him being a slut is his only bad trait. <br>Trufax</br></br>  <br>Pucci casually walking down the side of sideways Kennedy Space Center in the middle of the C-Moon fight.</br>  <br>Y'know, translators should play around with fonts more to give each character their own voice. I didn't like how a translator note actually had to point out how fucking annoying Magenta Magenta was supposed to be when he could have written his lines in  Comic Sans .</br>  <br>Yeah I get that, I just kind of preferred when he was more involved in Part 1, as opposed to Part 3 where he really only had DIO's World to shine.</br>  <br><br>jojo has ruined me for other manga/anime. i'm not as satisfied with things that don't have constant posing.</br></br>  <br> Giorno is an incredibly subtle character that I think most people ignore because they don't expect this kind of shit in JoJo, and just want Wacky Stand Adventures: The Series. <br>We already get this with Jotaro though, and Jotaro is prominent in many parts that Giorno's personality seems even more basic.</br></br>  <br>Fuck man I really wish I wasn't spoiled on this when I was reading Part 7. The World coming back would've been a legit shocking moment</br>  <br>Imagine being a Jap in 2010 or whatever and opening Ultra Jump and seeing that. I would've shat myself.</br>  <br> Everyone is unnerved at first by it, but eventually "comes under his spell". <br><br>I wonder why.</br></br></br>  <br>Same, but it was still pretty hype to read. Animefags will never experience this  because SBR will never ever get an anime. </br>  <br><br>I hated part 3 Dio. Trying to be mysterious when there is no mystery is frustrating and dull. We know all about this character. Putting a shadow over his face is not making us forget anything about him. Part 3 DIO spends his time doing nothing and then coming out of hiding to job to a hero who only has indirect beef with him. <br><br>Part 3 DIO is the worst fucking villain despite being the fucking best in Part 1. PB Dio is great because he actually has a lifelong connection to Jonathan and a strange brotherly love and respect despite it all. There is an actual conflict developed. He has NOTHING to play off of against Jotaro. Worst villain, worst Jojo and worst showdown. When you take away the poses and one liners there is nothing of substance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the one! Thanks man.</br></br>  <br>I can understand why you don't like him but<br><br> Part 3 DIO is the worst villain  <br>You have read Part 5...right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Diavolo <br> Worst Villain </br></br>  <br>Nah SBR will get an anime in 2025. <br><br>  And the corpse's identity will be changed to Hesus Bhrist.  </br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 DIO is a fucking disgrace. Part 1 Dio is one of the best villains of all times. DIO is just completely devoid of personality and intellect. He's generic.</br>  <br><br>Part 5 is way fucking better than part 3 because there is an ACTUAL FUCKING MYSTERY. We don't know why the Boss is or that he's even the villain. This comes at the cost of character development, but at least it had intrigue. Part 3 had neither.</br></br>  <br>The moment I realized that Pucci's stand is affecting the whole world, simply because Araki decided to outright show it instead of putting up some news report.<br> The commentary about commercials in television is the the most bizarre part in SO. </br></br>  <br>I don't think the name Jesus Christ is copywritten.</br>  <br><br> Why <br><br>*who*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how everything part 6 looks nothing like florida</br>  <br> The commentary about commercials in television is the the most bizarre part in SO. <br><br>In any other part you might've been right, but not in Snail Ocean.</br></br></br>  <br>I really think everything about the end of SO is gold. Every part after, I dunno, the green baby maybe? Or after the courtyard shit. <br><br>But especially every time we saw the rest of the world that wasn't the main cast dealing with the accelerating time. Fucking Rohan Kishibe.</br></br></br>  <br> never saw any of the other JoJos reacting to it <br>At least we got to see Rohan pissing off mangakas.</br></br>  <br>Diavolo's not a very good villain.<br>We knew from the very beginning he was the villain because of Giorno's plan to overthrow the boss.<br><br>Also <br> Why did he suddenly decide to now try to kill his daughter instead of much eariler if he's that paranoid about his identity <br> Why not send Doppio out to retrieve Trish and kill her yourself to save all the trouble. <br><br>All we know about Diavolo is he's paranoid about people finding out his identity. We don't know why, or what caused this, it just is. Even then there really couldn't be any big payoff to who The Boss was. That could only work if we had met Diavolo earlier in the story but didn't know he was The Boss. Finding out The Boss is someone we don't know isn't shocking. Just a bit interesting to see what he looks like.<br><br>Diavolo's just not a very good villain comparing him to the other Jojo villains. He has a motive but we don't exactly know why. We barely know anything about him other than Doppio and being paranoid. And he doesn't even have any memorable lines from Part 5.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After the muslims getting asshurt about the OVA having the Quran, they may not want to take any chances.</br></br>  <br>This whole time we've seen that Diavolo is insanely paranoid, and in the final battle he was given a brief moment to retreat. He could've lurked in the shadows, send more assassins, maybe throw some rocks or poison Giorno's drinks.<br>But no. Instead, we got a "muh pride" moment from fucking Diavolo of all people.<br>Enjoy your constant not-death, fucker.</br></br></br>  What was up with that teasing Giorno bullshit in Stone Ocean? They talk about how Dio's sons are gathering and Florida and then it goes <br><br>"But what about Giorno Giovanni? Perhaps he is already here...."<br><br>That got me hype thinking we were gonna get a cameo. But nope, nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't retreat because he could never get to be the mafia boss again</br>  <br><br>Does that little mention prove that Heaven's Door literally nullified MiH for Rohan?</br></br>  <br>Because then there would be four of Dio's scion and Mista would've freaked out and killed everyone.</br>  Hey doc, add this to the "jojo out of context" folder  <br>Nah, it was just a reference to the fact that Rohan is fucking insane when it comes to making his mangoes. As demonstrated in Part 4 many times.<br><br>Didn't Araki confirm somewhere that Rohan didn't even notice the universe change because of his manga or something like that? Dude loves his job/art.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody was affected by MiH apart from the people in the main cast who died.</br>  I know it's only just starting but Part 8 feels like "a lot of nothing happening" to me. It just feels like nothing in it is really solid and the fights are fairly boring.<br>Am I the only stupid fuck who thinks this? The pacing is great but the content feels really empty.</br>  <br> Four sons <br>Dio's pullout game is weak.</br></br>  <br> the fights <br> reading Part 8 for the fights <br>This isn't DBZ, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but no one cares what christians bitch about.</br>  <br>I think it's great. But I like detective things so I guess it's not for everyone. It's Gappy figuring out who he is, not villain of the week constant action bullshit. If anything Part 8 has made me dislike the other parts a bit more.</br>  <br>It's a little bit of a change from previous parts, because the plot so far seems to be less about defeating enemies and more about solving various mysteries (but especially WHO AM I)<br><br>Speaking of Jojolion, I suddenly realized that Jobin looks like one of the special spiky fruits. I don't know what to make of that fact however.</br></br></br>  <br>That would've been perfect</br>  <br>One of the best parts of JoJo for me has always been how those rascally stand users will get out of trouble using their wits and smarts.<br>It isn't about the fights but it's not just the fights, every confrontation feels boring in multiple ways. The best part of part 8 so far was the beetle battle and it would have been better if it was more detailed, it felt like an easy win.</br></br>  <br>Bring Dio back</br>  <br>I've seen better battles with beetles in a bottle.</br>  So is the new chapter implying that kira was super rich<br><br>Because Karera said Mansion</br></br>  Could Pucci not know his own fate in heaven because he existed outside of time and wasn't able to go through his life like everyone else?  <br>It's because he was a niggaboo</br>  <br>He could move sanic fast while others move in relatively normal speed, so we can safely assume he isn't affected by MiH. Coincidentally, this is also the reason how Emporio defeated him.</br>  <br>HWMN release apparently on track for tomorrow.</br>  <br>Must be a mistranslation. It happened in Yagiyama's flashback too. Could someone contact the translator about this?<br><br>The word mansion is used as a loanword in Japanese, but instead of an actual mansion it means a larger sort of apartment building.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant to say Dainenjiyama's flashback, not Yagiyama's.</br>  <br><br>You did not address a single point in the post you're replying too. <br><br> We knew from the very beginning he was the villain because of Giorno's plan to overthrow the boss. <br><br>That's retarded. Nothing about the fact Giorno wanted to overthrow the gang necessitates that he wanted to kill Trish.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why did he suddenly decide to now try to kill his daughter instead of much eariler if he's that paranoid about his identity <br> Why not send Doppio out to retrieve Trish and kill her yourself to save all the trouble. <br><br>I think you underestimate Diavolo's paranoia. Hell, some people already knew that this was the Boss's daughter; if Doppio had just went to her and straight-up killed her there was a slight chance of someone connecting some dots. <br><br>Also, did Diavolo even know about Trish before the time of the story? I kind of got the impression he didn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where can I get all of part 5?<br>nyaa only had partial copies, and madokami was worse.<br><br>I read on a tablet on the bus, so reading online is not an option.</br></br></br>  what should i color boys  <br>Neat. Maybe some Johnny and Gyro?</br>  reminder Kenshiro was drawn in Araki's current art style  <br>Reminder that Narancia died thinking Giorno and Mista were having a little some-some behind everyone's backs</br>  <br>But he was right.</br>  <br>Everyone Araki draws is so lewd.<br><br>Also, that's kind of like coming full circle from when Parts 1 and 2 were HNK fanfiction, isn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>that's irrelevant, it's funny because he believed it due to wacky misunderstandings</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> You did not address a single point in the post you're replying too. <br>I did actually. Re-read the post.<br><br> That's retarded. Nothing about the fact Giorno wanted to overthrow the gang necessitates that he wanted to kill Trish. <br><br>How is that retarded? <br> Giorno joins the gang because he wants to take over  <br> In order to take over you need to be The Boss <br> ergo he needs to defeat The Boss to achieve his goal. <br><br>You stupid or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone Araki draws is so lewd. <br>It's the lips.</br></br>  <br><br>dick sucking lips for everyone</br></br>  The hell did you say about my buns?  <br>Pucci is pure</br>  <br><br>Shhh, don't worry about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Two of the 3 villains turned Koichi's friend shrink for some reason.</br></br>  <br><br>Shhhh, it's okay. Just don't worry about it.</br></br>  <br>Who is the other one? Hazamada, the guy with the wooden doll stand and?</br>  <br>the lock guy</br>  <br>Of there's one villain that Araki was writing by the seat of his pants, it's Diavolo. A lot of the shit he does and his motives just reeks of exceptionally bad and lazy writing.</br>  jojo is gay  <br>Either this or the one I post next.</br>  <br/>  <br>I've got this from Doc's imgur</br>  <br>He wanted the coloranon to color it differently, not to have a wallpaper.</br>  <br>I know, just posting because its basically what he was reqeusting</br>  What the fuck is a Jojolion?<br>All the other parts had cool names.</br>  <br>JoJo + Evangelion = JoJolion</br>  <br>Jojo + Evangelion</br>  <br><br> pls kill me </br></br>  <br><br><br>That's dumb, by far the worst name so far, and that's makes me angry because part 8 is doing great.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay</br>  <br>No, it's not ok<br>I will write an e-mail to araki and tell him to change the name to something cooler.</br></br>  <br>Jotaro</br>  <br>Can Crazy D make people younger?</br>  <br>You didn't enjoy the escape from rock boy #2? I mean I guess it wasn't really a fight and more of running away, but the ending was hilarious, I wasn't expecting Paper Moon King to be so deadly. I'm sure (or hope) that we'll get more fights between actual stand users when we get further into the story.</br>  <br>No idea, the rule of "fixing thing" isn't fleshed out enough</br>  <br>Better than "Vento Aureo".</br>  <br>Nothing</br>  <br>What if you stab the Super Aja with the Arrow?</br>  <br><br>No it is not, at least vento and aureo are actual words.</br></br>  <br>Nothing at all</br>  <br>It's a portmanteau, faggot. Evangelion is a real word and JoJo is the name of the series.</br>  <br>He let Killer Queen die.</br>  <br>Those chapters were really funny.</br>  <br>Oh god I just realized jojolion is a fusion of jojo and Evangelion just like Josuke is a fusion of Josefumi and Kira, I changed my mind it is the best name so far.<br><br>Phantom blood is the shitty one now, there are no ghosts in it, and stardust crusaders also don't sail on the stars.</br></br></br>  <br>It is not "fixing" it is turn things back in time, just not in the same way Kira does.</br>  <br><br>Dem feels when they are in the water looking for the baby.</br></br>  <br>And Battle Tendency doesn't have much battles has other parts<br>And Diamond is Unbreakable, Diamond is Breakable <br>In Vento Aureo , there is no golden wind stand abbility<br><br>There no stone ocean in Stone Ocean</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stardust Crusaders is about JoeStars fighting in the dessert to save Holy, so you could name it a Holy War.</br>  <br>Since when do the steel balls run?</br>  <br> There no stone ocean in Stone Ocean <br>The prison is the stone ocean you super reatard.

Stone ocean and SBR are the only names that makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>The Greek word that he's talking about is "evangelion", dummy.</br>  <br> The compund word "JoJo" is from the main character's name "Josuke" <br>Now I understand.</br></br>  <br>Bait post but I will answer.<br><br>Joseph had personality to pick fights (a tendency if you will).<br>The stand Crazy Diamond has an unbreakable will.<br>There was golden wind before Giorno got GER.<br>as for Stone Ocean, see  .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it's not. It's fixing things that are "broken" in the most literal sense. <br><br>People seem to see it as undoing things that are wrong but that's not the case. It can't fix diseases and stuff because nothing's broken, just working differently than it should. For example, it couldn't fix Okuyasu's dad because there was technically nothing "broken" about him. And as for the dead, it can't bring the dead back because even if you fix a wound the person would obviously still be dead.</br></br></br>  <br>I loved it<br><br>Please rename all the other parts.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was called Diamond Is Unbreakable because Crazy Diamond fixed shit, I thought about what you said at first, but Josuke and by extension his Stand have your average JoJo level of willpower</br>  <br><br> josuke <br><br>A love type of guy.<br><br> giorno <br><br>Is most likely gay. Shows no interest in Trish or the women that surround him at the beginning, prefering instead to focus on Bruno.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's fixing things that are "broken" in the most literal sense. <br>Crazy D can turn spaghettie into its ingrdients and "fix" scratchs that were already fixed making them appear again.</br></br>  <br><br> Diamond is Breakable <br><br>But not my erection while reading it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooking isn't natural.</br>  <br> Diamond is Breakable <br>Diamond is the strongest known metal in the universe, are you stupid?</br></br>  <br>Phantom Blood is about undeads with thirst for blood.<br>Battle Tendency is about people that fight a lot.<br>Diamond is Unbreakable is about a guy with a diamond named stand who survivied in the end.<br>Vento Aureo is about a golden boy'd wind of change.<br>Steel Ball Run is about a race with balls of steel.<br>JoJolion is about a great feline called JoJo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah,  is right, what's the first thing you do to make spaghetti? Grind wheat to make flour. or cut up tomatoes to make sauce.<br><br>I don't know (or remember) what scratches you mean so I can't give a proper rebuttal for that.</br></br></br>  <br>The scrathes are in the fight against Super Fly.</br>  <br>Actually, I think the reason Crazy Diamond can't restore Okuyasu's dad is because he needs to visualize what the object looked like before. Otherwise, it will look imperfect.</br>  <br>Is there a canon reason why Steel named the race 'Steel Ball Run' anyway? Because that seems completely random from his character's point of view and only makes sense in Gyro's context.</br>  <br>It is really hard, so you need balls of steel.</br>   pre-order dub <br> date still says July 28th <br> call Amazon <br> they confirm that is in fact the release date and it should ship any day now <br><br>I hope none of you guys bought the one that says September 22nd.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pre-order dub <br><br>I would like to hear it but I dont think I'll ever support that after hearing it from the recent event.</br></br></br>  <br> he needs to visualize what the object looked like before <br><br>That's fucking stupid and would have nerfed Crazy Diamond into almost unusability if it were true. And anyway it's certifiably false, if he could fix the Highway Star kid before fucking him up again he could fix Okuyasu's dad if what you said were true.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the out-of-universe explanation is Steel Ball + Cannonball Run = Steel Ball Run<br>The in-universe explanation is that it's named after Steel, no explanation as to where he got the "Ball Run" part from though.</br></br>  <br>Is it dual audio and uncensored?</br>  <br>Yeah, it was pretty shit. I fear that the future of the manga's release in the west hinges on its success, though.</br>  <br><br>  if he could fix the Highway Star kid before fucking him up again he could fix Okuyasu's dad if what you said were true. <br><br>Shit, I fucked that up, what I meant to say was that he wouldn't have been able to fix the Highway Star kid if what you said were true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Josuke can't fix Okuyasu's father because he can only turn things back a few days ago, and Okuyasu's dad was in that state for years.<br><br>The only exception was when he fixed  Joseph. </br></br></br>  <br>Uncensored, but only English audio.</br>  <br> only English audio <br>Ehhh, there's no blu-ray release either, is there?</br></br>  <br>No, Josuke actually said himself that he can't fix things if he doesn't know what they look like right at the beginning of Part 4.<br><br>Then again a lot of stuff happened at the beginning of part 4 that was ignored later on.</br></br></br>  <br>But what about that photo that was ripped up? It's just fixing and matching the pieces like a jigsaw puzzle.<br><br><br><br>I think you can figure out what a man in a body cast looks like before he broke all of his bones. Plus, they're just broken bones, not some facial disfigurement.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your theory is still stupid. How would that even work? Is there an arbitrary amount of time it "turns things back"? If not, how does it determine the point in time at which the thing is "fixed"? Arbitrarily? It ain't Josuke doing it himself, that's for sure.<br><br>Also, that would mean that things would be "healed" at either differing rates or in differing amounts of time depending on how long ago it became unsatisfactory, which isn't depicted at all.</br></br></br>  <br>If anything fixed Joseph it was Tonio's food.

WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO THIS SHIT?</br></br>  She looks so naked without the cape.    <br> So did the writers just forget <br>Forget what? That Hibiki thinks she’s worthless without Gungnir?</br></br>  <br>Hime carry with floods of pussy juices in the background?</br>  <br> It could also be that she so powerful only the gayest duet song can defeat her. <br><br>Jesus image when it's gonna even more gay than G's duet</br></br></br>  <br>They kind of don’t have a choice.</br>  <br>You have 2 panels. The jam could be from the gaijin eyes.</br>  <br> Muh forgot </br>  <br>No I mean't the screams of her getting BTFO</br>  <br>I'm currently thinking whistling jam-covered gaijins.</br>  <br>She didn't seemed that way near the end of G. She even went to save Maria without doubt and high spirits despite being powerless. Seriously what are the writters doing with Bikki this season?</br>  Someone needs to make a sound webm that goes from the transformation to the end of the ep.<br>I'd do it myself but I'm on a toaster.</br>  <br>She was thinking of how useful she was, losing Gungnir would be a great shock to her.<br>And she apologized after.</br></br>  Someone should make a new hype chart  <br>But they ran a brainwashing exam on Elfnein and she was clean. How could her present possibly be a trap?</br>  <br>They are setting themselves up to be assfucked on bigger scale than ever before. Ryoko and vert betrayal was nothing compared to this.</br>  <br> The least menacing looking enemy <br> The most competent </br></br>  <br>Worst*</br>  <br/>   the boys don't know about beef stroganoff <br><br>Bullshit, Genjuro and Ogawa probably make the best damn Stroganoff in the world.<br><br>What kind of man doesn't know about cuisine?</br></br></br></br>  <br>DID THEY RUN A BRAINWASHING TEST ON THE FUCKING DEMONIC RELICT SWORD THAT ONLY BRINGS RUIN ALSO?</br>  <br>They will have double henshin.<br>There hasn't been anything so gay before.</br></br>  Is it next Friday, yet?  <br><br>Then why did she even try to give it back at the end of G? She was fine without Gungnir after losing it then.</br></br>  <br>Because the writers forgot to deal with Bikki's issues in S2.</br>  <br>Is her masive  forehead .</br>   tfw NO SUBS time to calm down cut to two hours only now <br>SYMPHOGEAR RIDE IS GOING TOO FAST</br>  <br>Addressing the issues previous seasons just brushed over. In G she sacrificed Gungnir herself in order to save Miku which is completely natural since she’d sacrifice herself for Miku at any time.</br>  <br>She's a homunculus with only the necessary information in her brain. If the only thing she's ever had in her head RE the shards was that they were powerful but also perfectly safe to use, then show her the knowledge to make her flee to seek atonement for what she helped make, then it wouldn't be brainwashing because everything she did was of her own free will.<br><br>Sadly, it was all part of Carols keikaku</br></br></br>  <br>Three JAM sad gaijins, one happy doll gaijin</br>  <br>Because Elfnein was the big bad all along, Carol is just some girl that was kidnapped.</br>  <br>By making her think showing shards of doomblade into people is the only way to save the world.</br>  <br>Because she wasn't useless back then.<br>This time everything was on her shoulders and she failed making the one that needs drugs to do the job for her.</br></br>  <br>You are confusing her power to hold hands with her power to help people. For the most part, at the end of G all she wanted and needed to do was talk with Maria. She could count on the other gear to protect the ones she loved<br><br>She already failed at talking with Carol, and now she just lost the only tool that allowed her to protect her friends in a situation where she is the only one who can fight</br></br></br>  <br>Find me a cap of doll in a workable pose.</br>    <br>Orange color looks strange on her.</br>  <br>Kirika's song is already gay as fuck.</br>  <br> Here's ange </br>  <br>  phonic gain </br>   Trying to justify Hibiki being a bitch <br>Please. If Maria had just snatched Gungnir out of Hibiki's hand at the end of G everyone would be crying bitch. But mai waifu Hibiki does it and she diddu nuffin wrong.</br>  <br><br>We need a gif of this chart going up and then it cuts to the red bikie killing lazer of this episode</br></br>  So what episode is Fine going to show up in?  Missed the livestream and just saw the episode and JEEEEEEEZUUUUS<br><br> Maria manning up, catching Gungnir and turning into a modified version of her S2 gear where she actually uses her god damn spear <br> Garie fed up with Carol's crap <br> Bikki waking up from her bullshit but getting wrecked dead after her moment of glory <br> demonic relics soon <br><br>Life is good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki's hands are gigantic.</br>  <br>They only eat, watch movies and sleep like true men. Cooking is for pussies.</br>  <br>Pay attention to the dialog. She wasn't mad because Maria was taking the Gungnir away from her. She was mad because Maria wanted to use it for fighting and not protecting people in the retarded way she thought was right.</br>  <br>Because you won't just up and take away something from someone permantly without asking them first. She and everyone also assumed there wouldn't be any more noise anymore. Hibiki has only ever used the gear to fight noise at that time so she didn't think of any other uses for it.<br>Now that she knows that the gear is officially hers and that it can make her 10 times more useful, she can't go back anymore.</br></br>  <br>Fine gave up last season anon</br>  <br> yfw Ogawa fuck Hibiki for 3 days in the episode 7. </br>  <br>yuri hands</br>  where were you when hibiki was kill?  <br>The problem isn't whether she was being a bitch or not. She very clearly was. The problem is whether or not her action make sense (which they do).</br>  <br>Yuri hands are real.</br>  <br>Most likely wasn’t an easy decision for her, and it technically was Maria’s. Maria only formally gave it to Hibiki during that scene. Before that Hibiki had only stolen it just like Maria now stole it back. <br><br>Maria now wanting it back would be an “I gave you this present but I demand it back” situation and Hibiki’s reaction wasn’t a long thought out response, it was a knee jerk reaction. She’d probably comply after thinking it over and go back into moping mode.</br></br></br>  <br>you mean Tsubasa</br>  What the hell are these things?  <br> go back into moping mode. <br>Pleaso no. I hope Hibiki's obligatory emo phase of the season is short lived this time.</br></br>  You know whats wierd about this series? Everytime I go in expecting manly gar jpop fighting with gay girls, but after a few episodes I start thinking shit may actually get real and people actually start dying.<br><br>I mean, deep down I know that there is no way this will have a bad end, but all this demonic relict shit and hibiki not autowinning everything by being GAR anymore and all this talk about episode 7? jesus fucking christ.</br></br>   holy words   <br>TSAB facilities</br>   Subs are out in under 3 hours of the livestream <br>Oh, for a second there I thought I was in the Symphogear thread.</br>  <br>structure made out of Phonic Gain</br>  <br>I don't know but they're there since the very beginning.</br>  <br>They're like the stadium from the first episode of s1 but now there are a lot?</br>  <br>I agree, but that would be a very justified emo phase.</br>   [CReep] Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX - 04 [1080p].mkv   <br>Was Bikke a shit again?</br>   Hey stop bugging us already and clear the way <br> She actually does it <br><br>This is some Scooby Doo tier stuff</br></br></br>   All this talk about EP 7 being girmdark <br> Nana almost lost her voice from screaming <br> This episode showed edgy gears with relics in the users chest <br> Yfw the screaming in episode 7 is actually   berserker Tsubasa <br>Calling it now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her shoulders looks kind of wide too.

People have been comparing this to Nanoha since forever.</br>  So was Maria or Hibiki the better Gungnir this episode?<br><br> My vote is with Maria. </br></br>  <br/>  You know what makes GX good<br>The enemies are actual enemies and are being dangerous since day one/two<br><br> S1 <br>The characters have no idea who they're really fighting until the end since mooks show up mostly alone<br>Fine's gear looked ridiculous and her getting beaten down by Genjuro until she played with his affection made you wonder how much danger she really represented despite her moon cannon<br> G <br>Maria and her loli sidekicks were good, dumb people being tricked and not doing anything evil themselves<br>Mom looked like the mastermind yet she was a good person and you wonder why the fuck she was with Ver in the first place<br>Ver was an insane manchild who wanted to be LAST ACTION HERO-DA and acted more pathetic than anything<br>The Noise were used again and not even a threat since Symphogears were still impervious to them<br>The Nephilim miniboss, why was it even a thing?<br>End of the run Miku saves the day by doing a javelin throw after the symphogirls went full Precure white dress mode<br> GX <br>Carol, a several hundred years old alchemist wants to destroy humanity because she's pissed and she has the means to do so<br>The living automatons are spooky uncanny with the bone breaking/popping noises when they move and roll their eyes backwards, and have great style with their dance theme<br>They kill without remorse and some enjoy it<br>The Noise mooks can actually hurt Symphogear users and don't need a unique cane thing to summon them<br>One of the autoscorers might just go and become a separate threat<br><br>I don't watch much anime so you might find my opinion retarded</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> similarities <br>This is straight off copied nigger, they get btfo after a bunch of eps and come back with the cartridge/ignite system just like their enemies<br>Similarities he said</br></br></br>  <br>All Hibiki managed to do is punch water and get blown the fuck up.</br>  <br> no KORT EL FES GUNGNIR <br>Hibiki</br></br>  <br> Spear better than fisting <br>I agree that it was great and all, but let's be real here.</br></br>  <br>Maria, easily. Had a much better moment for herself and fought much more smartly.</br>  <br>Maria ofc</br>  <br>Maria a cool.</br>  <br>Maria. <br><br>Hibiki is held back by all her prior angsting.<br><br>G-Beat was cool though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria was cool but she ain't screaming Bikki</br>  <br>All Maria managed is to spill some Jam.</br>  <br>Lilies, huh?</br>  <br>The hell is wrong with her boobs?</br>  So just checking; everyone already knows what scoring is in pottery? Yes? Great, continue with the shitposting.<br><br>Elfnein a shit.</br></br>   lol that was just a clone, you didn't hit me <br><br>What is this godmodding RP bullshit</br></br>  What was the soy sauce offering about? I think it was some joke, but I don't get it.  <br>No way anon. The Hibiki moment was way better.</br>  <br>They look poisonous, though.</br>  Maria vs Garie confirmed?<br>Place your bets on how she will get trashed.<br> She summons a Serena illusion but gets wrecked after Maria sees through it. </br></br>  <br>Needs sharp teeth edited in.</br>  <br>By the time Maria gets her gear the dolls will probably be already dead anyway.</br>  <br> *its a hologram* <br> WOW IT TOOK TWO OF YOU TO KILL ME </br></br>  <br>Maria was great but she can't  G- beat the whistle.</br>  <br> All those lilies  <br>Subtle.</br></br>  <br>They're more colorful this time around too.</br>  <br>Confirmed since the op came out. That's why people are wrong about Garie being the real big bad, because the way everyone is paired off leaves Hibiki vs. Carol.</br>  <br> hating on sexhair, soft-voiced homunculus loli <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>VERY SUBTLE</br>  <br>Jesus christ</br>  <br>Yeah, I have the same feelings too.<br>Specially since those models look edgy as fuck, and usually spikes = evul.</br></br>  <br>It was only at the point of the last attack that she swapped it out for the water clone.</br>  One flower for each of mamu's daughterus?  Best episode of GX yet, finally managed to fulfill my thirst for hype and even exceed it. <br> dat shot of hibiki princess carrying miku after finding her resolve and all that glittering water in the background jesus christ manly biki <br> dat entire garrie <br> dat maria and edgy bleeding eyes  <br> dat biki getting BTFO meaning that a new power up is incoming <br>Also the dolls are great antagonists, exactly what symphogear had been lacking since Fine. I like their dissonant tracks, jacked movements and everything about them just screams "wrong". Also even Carol is scarier than the faggot who couldnt stop falling down stairs.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hibiki a shit  <br>Oh shit it's that Nanoha stark lighting.<br><br>Or maybe it just looks like it because the dolls are pale.</br></br></br>  <br> The chase we saw in ep1 was pretty lighthearted and bland <br> Elf9 manages to get saved in the shittiest way possible in ep2 <br> Carol knows about her being at the base already but doesn't give jack shit <br> Current plan is to break the current Symphogears <br> Garie mentions something among the lines of stealing their songs <br> Project Ignite <br> Anon's theory is actually right <br> Evil clones of the geahs powered by the destroyed songs <br> What do what do </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Finally going to start watching this season. Which subs are best for Symphogear?  <br>Skill points into revive and berserk though</br>    Why did a pink explosion happen when Hibiki's pendant was destroyed? That didn't happen with Tsubasa and Chris. Does it have something to do with the fact that theirs was destroyed by alca-noise while Hibiki's was just physically crushed?  <br>No wonder Mamu is coughing up blood all the time. She straight up drinks soy sauce.</br>  <br>Garie is naturally pale.<br>Micha has little more color.<br><br><br>It's not like there's much choice, just get those BDs on Nyaa.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ogawa doesn't want anything to do with this catfight </br>  <br>Micha throws explosions</br>  <br>I really wanted to see Maria slap Hibiki after she said that. What a great way to thank the person who just saved your life.</br>  <br>Starlight breaker</br>  Someone fix that goddamn first 4koma guys image now  <br>Maybe because theirs was damaged enough to disintegrate their gears (they had pink sparkles going around when it happend) but Hibikis just got smashed in one go so her gear went boom</br>  THAT WAS TRULY DETERMINATION TO FIST EPISODE  WAIT<br><br> Lot's of screaming from Nana on ep 7 <br> new demon sword enhanced relics <br><br>Oh dear OHH DEAR</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> naturally <br> Garie <br> natural </br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki's dead eyes still worry me. That wasn't anything like a fatal blow and her fall was very slowed down by PHONIC GAIN so she should have lost her consciousness at best. As far as I know dead eyes are not a code for being passed out, they're a code for being either really dead or dead on the inside in some sense.</br>  <br>Damn it hibiki</br>  Holy this show.<br><br>Doll noises [intensifies] the show.</br></br>  o deer  <br>Zerk Symphogears are coming</br>  <br>Who knows flower language? Cause the fact they chose those three flowers has to represent something.</br>  We ketchup now   elfnein is actually a double agent trying to corrupt the geahs   <br>Hibiki apologized right after. She's a good girl, people do stupid things when agitated.</br>  <br> now <br><br>You don't even have that much, git gud and spill more jam like the others did.</br></br></br>  <br>Setup complete<br><br><br>Maybe we're all being taken for a ride by the staff, and episode 7 is going to be the Jackie Chan episode.<br><br> cast unwinds after training and watches Rush Hour <br> Tsubasa screams after Hibiki makes fun of her inability to sing "War" well </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There is a criminally low amount of Carol fanart. I am highly disappointed in japan.  <br><br>White lilies are considered a flower given to the dead all around the world. Ironically they're also the symbol of yuri, which makes Miku bringing only lilies to Hibiki's grave in S1 pretty funny in a very twisted way.</br></br>  <br>I would, but I don't have it saved. It somebody posts it I'll fix it. <br><br> GBA <br>I get a feeling the menu colors and font look different on that one. I don't want to replace the whole menu and have Shadow's and Cyan's name disappearing.</br></br></br></br>  Would you watch anime about Windows 10-tan /a/?

As much as I enjoy Gon and would love some more development or character interaction with him and the other lancers Crow makes 100x more sense to move on given the Jack dynamic established in the last 2 episodes. Plus it'll give us a bit more room to shill BWs for high speed riders. Gon has time he's not going anywhere.  <br> shill BWs for high speed riders.  <br>Blackwings aren't going to be in High Speed Riders. All their stuff will take main pack space.</br></br>  <br>Gon will win.
