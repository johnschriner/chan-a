I'm more interested in the 7 minutes long remix of 進撃st-hrn-egt20130629巨人 that will be included.  <br>Not surprising, since it has much more manlet.</br>  <br>I don't think the first sold that much. Power of Levi?</br>  <br>Obviously. You think people watched it for the story?</br>  <br>Levi and season 2.</br>  How much did the first recap movie earn? Can't find any source.  <br>Is there a date for season 2 yet?</br>  <br>Mostly Manlet though. People going there for S2 were a big minority.</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-jsS<wbr>XHhRD9s</wbr>  [ ]<br> tfw the first part of season 2 will be a hell of a ride, and the second part will be boring as fuck. <br>Wonder how the openings will differ.</br></br>  <br>Looking forward to you faggots being cancerous as always.</br>  <br> the second part will be boring as fuck. <br>It won't.</br></br>  <br>Yes it will, except for one or two moments.</br>  <br>22 episodes for good pacing but I prefer 24 episodes to flesh out the characters and give them more backstories. 25 is a huge NO.</br>  <br>It will be 24, since they didn't have enough material for a second season after the clash of titans arc.</br>  <br> the second part will be boring as fuck. <br>I want them to condense it while adding some material to the first half but since the first has less Levi compared to the second, the opposite will happen.</br></br>  <br> characters and give them more backstories <br> More muh Marco and Araki's fanfiction </br></br>  <br>Most of the budget will be used to make manlet look even more cool. They did the same in S1.</br>  <br>There is always at least one entertaining thing in each chapter.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>All the conversation will be even more boring in the anime.</br>  <br>There are a lot of new characters introduced though plus the first season didn't do a great job making the characters likeable  except Jean and Armin </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>No. The conversations especially will be even more tedious.</br>  <br>Yes. Give me a chapter that has not a single entertaining scene.</br>  I'd love it when the staffs go with "show, don't tell" on s2 but then it's Araki we're talking about.  <br>I have to agree with him, there's Sasha stealing bread, there's Historia's lazer beam eyes, there's RT being comfy, Eren trying to get hard, rape time, Ackerman time, "Why are you retarded?" scene, Frieda's spaguetti spill, Historia's she mad and taking heroin, and the best of all  Mikasa's cuck face. <br>It'll be boring, but at least some keks will be had.</br></br>  <br>Most things you mentioned are still boring, except for a few</br>  <br>You don't have fun much, do you?</br>  <br>That's your opinion, and I don't share it.</br>  <br> second part <br>I'm mostly interested in Hysteria and if her VA is going to mess it up or not.</br></br>  I have never seen a series skyrocket in popularity then nosedive back to nobody giving a shit so quickly. Even faster than Bleach.  <br>I do, but most of it still boring.</br>  <br>*is still</br>  <br>It's because tumblr lost it's hype. It still sells the same in japan.</br>  <br> implying araki won't completely fuck up all of it by making Eren brawl with the turkey titan and deleting all moments that go in the way of his Mikasafagging <br> implying chapter 50 won't be completely redone <br> implying there won't be tons of levi shitty action fillers </br></br></br>  <br>What makes you think that?</br>  <br>Fujos in nipland still love it and they are the majority of the readers.</br>   a mysterious titan with unique appearance, intelligence and seems to have been out of touch with humanity for several decades, maybe even centuries who could maybe even be linked to the original titans <br> jk he's just some dude in steampunk goggles </br>  <br> original titans <br>That's just a theory.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if they knew about Historia when they hired Shiori Mikami to voice Krista. She never had a role similar to Historia.</br>  <br>/a/ is no indicator for popularity</br>  <br> orginal tian <br> Century <br>Shifters don't live more than 30 years. MT has at least 25 years.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not. I assume they were already working on S1 when she showed her real personality during Utgard for the first time. Then again Isayama probably already told them about it though</br>  I heard from nips that ymir is dead, is it right?  <br>wtf is that shity theory? lol</br>  I want the new chapter already.  <br>We all do, anon.</br>  <br>Never before has it been such a pain in the ass to wait for it.</br>  <br>Sorry that Shitmir isn't going to be in it much. I'm thankful for it though.</br>  <br>I don't think so because when the anime was airing it was still barely through the Utgard arc. Ymirfags complain about their shitty dyke's Miku voice but I'd rather see Historia get a different voice. Or maybe Shiori practiced and won't be so bad.</br>  <br> Sasha stealing bread is funneh <br>Not him, but he's right.</br></br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about her, but you're obviously butthurt because your favorite was in the political arc.</br>  <br>I don't care so much about the bread stuff but I want to see the shit machine animated and crossdresser Armin. Also Mikasa's cuckface.</br>  <br>Why would I be butthurt about seeing my favorites?</br>  <br>You don't. You know it damn well that there's no chance they will animate the shit machine.<br>You're just adding stuff up.</br></br>  <br>Because I said the political arc was boring and since it included your favorite you got butthurt.</br>  <br>They better add the shit machine.</br>  <br>Because you start shitposting when they are called boring?</br>  <br>I agree the political arc is boring. But there were a few scenes I want to see. The only butthurt I see here is you though.</br>  <br>Sorry for insulting Ymir-sama. I won't do it again next time.</br>   The political arc is my second favorite arc behind Utgard-kidnapping.<br/>   <br>It was boring in general but it has some great moments so in a way that redeems it for me.</br>  <br>What great moments?</br>  <br>I liked the focus on characterization.</br>  <br>If you agree with me then why did you get so butthurt? Are you retarded?</br>  The WIT duo Imai and Ebara didn't show up in Seraph. I hopethey are currently working on Titans now  Or they're probably working on Cabanelli with Araki. <br><br>I only want from second season is less QUALITY and more sakuga.</br></br>  <br>I see, I couldn't be wrong.</br>  <br>I'm not? Calm down Ymirfag.</br>  <br>Didn't they expect Seraph to be the next big thing and it was just mediocre?</br>  <br>Again, I don't give a fuck about her and my favorite is actually also in this arc and yes you are butthurt  well you are either butthurt or just generally autistic.</br>  <br>If you didn't care about her you would have ignored me. Is that too hard for you to do?</br>  <br>Autist like you are just generally retarded. Apparently it was really hard for you to contain it, just because someone simply called this arc boring.</br>  <br>And I agreed this arc was boring.</br>  <br>At least it sold 5k, good for the studio I guess, after the failure that is the Flopping Girls.<br><br> I don't even comprehend why would they expect it to be the next big thing. The story's mediocre at best. </br></br></br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  <br>Well the manga got a good boost and V1 sales aren't bad. Not the next SnK but it's not a flop.</br>  <br>I don't see the logic behind this, my favorite was in the arc and I still find it boring.</br>  <br>Guess that's why you made that butthurt post and immediately assumed my favorite isn't in this arc.</br>  <br>Who is your favorite?</br>  <br>Some anons think if you say this arc was boring you indirectly insult their favorite.</br>  <br>I could throw up</br>  <br>I honestly like the manga, but even I can't understand why anyone expected the anime to be good. The promos were fujo pandering everywhere.</br>  <br>Isn't Historia your favorite?</br>  <br>One of my favorites.</br>  <br>I don't feel like saying because it will only start shitlifting. I'll only say it's not Erwin nor Levi.<br><br><br>y</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The arc is less boring, even pretty good, if you read it in one sitting instead of 40 pages/month over 2 years.</br></br>  <br>Why? You want to shitpost and start meta cancer?</br>  <br>Armin? I like Armin too.</br>  <br>The only character I hate is Ymir.</br>  <br>Arminfags have no reason to hide their favorites, he's the most liked here. They're also pretentious enough to act superior so I doubt it's Armin.</br>  <br>Armin is a pretty good character though.</br>  <br>No, it's  Ymir <br> inb4 shit taste. <br> Taste is mine not yours.</br></br></br>  <br>I already noticed that.</br>  <br>That's subjective and I disagree. He's mostly a generic plot device to me.</br>  <br>Figures. Disgusting, well enjoy your shit taste I guess.</br>  <br>Armin, Jean, and Historia are all well developed characters. But people like to get butthurt here and call them plot devices for it.</br>  <br>Y-You too...</br>  <br><br>Heh.</br></br>  <br>Why are you pretending to be me?</br>  <br>I like Jean and Historia though. I don't use muh development as an excuse for everything unlike you, since development isn't enough to make a good character. And again in the end it's all subjective.</br>  <br>Only the second post is mine, genius.<br>Just a little tip, but this is an anonymous image board.</br></br>  <br>Why would you reply to a question directed to someone else then, genius?</br>  <br>I'm not, just answered the favorite question too.<br><br>Of these three I think Historia is the less likely to be a plot device.</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with development either. For example Historia would be Christa still and pretty much as flat a character one could get if more depth wasn't added to her.</br>  <br> I'm not, just answered the favorite question too. <br>It wasn't a general question, it was directed at a certain anon. I don't want to insult your intelligence for liking Ymir, but you know.<br> Of these three I think Historia is the less likely to be a plot device. <br>That should be Jean. I like Historia more than him but Jean isn't a plot device in any way. Historia, Armin and Eren are confirmed plot devices by Isayama, if that wasn't obvious already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because maybe someone else replied to a question that was directed at someone else?</br>  <br> I'm not, just answered the favorite question too <br>That's a little bit weird, but nevermind it's okay.</br></br>  <br>Of course there's nothing wrong with it in Historia's case because that was the whole point of her character. Other characters grew more unlikeable to me after development, like Jean for example. I mean that while development isn't always a bad thing, it's not always a good thing either and it's certainly not a way to measure character quality.</br>  <br>liking an ugly, annoying dike is beyond shit.</br>   You replied to my question, how dare you? <br>Let's just stop with this shit.</br>  <br>Jean is the most realistic character, I don't see what makes him so unlikeable. Same case with Armin except he isn't very realistic in comparison but I also can't see what would make someone be annoyed by him either. I liked that his ruthlessness is balanced by his humanity. Historia is one of my top favorites but she is definitely more generic compared to Armin or Jean.</br>  <br> I don't see what makes him so unlikeable <br>Because he's annoying.</br></br>  <br>He's far less annoying than Ymir is.</br>  <br>I said he's more unlikeable TO ME than he used to be, learn to read and understand the concept of subjectivity. I know I'm on 4chan and everyone claims their opinions as facts, but it's not too hard to understand and accept that not all people like what you like. <br>In any case, Jean was realistic even before his development. If he decided to enter the MP after seeing people die it would make even more sense. Historia and Armin are generic in fiction standards, Jean isn't as generic but he might come off as boring. Actually Armin and Historia are arguably the most generic characters in SnK even if I like Historia a lot.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't make him likable.</br>  <br>They're on the same level of obnoxiousness, they are blunt and rude and they can get on your nerves easily. Isayama likes them both because of that but I wouldn't want to be around such people. Such a shit taste he has.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384520 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Come on, you're just inviting people  Ymirfags  to call her a Mary Sue and a cliche Disney princess by claiming that. She was a lot less cliche when she was depressed and didn't care about anyone or anything and I felt her depression was handled rather well. Don't get me wrong, I still really like her now but I can't see how Armin or Jean are more generic than her.</br>  <br>Why does she trigger you that much? <br>Hurr durr dyke?</br></br>  <br>Probably. See </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384596 <br>Riported.</br>  <br> you're just inviting people Ymirfags to call her a Mary Sue and a cliche Disney princess <br>She is though. I like her, but she really damn is. I hate Ymirfags and their constant shitflinging and fingerpointing but that much is true.<br>  She was a lot less cliche when she was depressed <br>Not at all, do you even know what cliche and generic means? Have you even read enough manga or fiction in general? Because it looks like you haven't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind if she's a lesbian. I just find her awful.</br>    <br>That's your opinion. People like characters on different ways.</br>  <br>Yes, exactly. Peoples dislike Shitmir because they're bilbethumping anti-LGBT monsters &amp; Goobergaters too probably with Conservative flags on their redneck porches.<br><br>It has nothing to do with her being the shittest character on the show, nothing at all.<br><br>Hanji is also LGBT and (s)he doesn't get quite as much hate, (s)he only gets made fun off.<br><br>Now excuse me, I have to go shoot up a black church *tips Gomorrah*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd taste that colossal sausage.</br>  <br>I don't really mind her Mary Sue qualities because I like how Isayama portrays her.</br>  <br>Your post is kind of ironic.</br>  <br>Elaborate then.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384520 <br>Historia doesn't even act anything like a bimbo. Christa sure but Historia?</br>  <br>There I'm biting it.<br>You're the only one here who cares about that shit to whine and shitpost.<br>Some people here and you have a retarded obsession with dykes whereas others don't give a shit and when you get called out on your autism you write hemorrhoids/10 posts like you did.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384775 <br>Mikasa pls go.</br>  <br>Why is the colossal titan spaghetti?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384775 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384680 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384596 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384520 <br> RPing </br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384863 <br>And what does this all have to do with feminism you retard?</br>  <br>Nevermind. I didn't expect you to get it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384863 <br>Great anon. I so much agree.</br>  <br> You're the only one here who cares about that shit to whine and shitpost. <br>Not really, I see Ymirfags and not only them do it all the time too. Islamfag is just extra autistic about his posts.</br></br>  <br>Stop proving the retardation of Ymirfags by replying to him.</br>  <br>A+ reply, retard. If there's something you disagree with, say what it is so I can easily prove you wrong.</br>  <br>Don't mind Islamshit, his posts never make sense. He doesn't even know the difference between ants and bees.</br>  Learn the lesson, never say you like Ymir or don't even mention her at all.  <br>You can't though, because you already proved mine.</br>  <br>But she was extremely relevant to the plot in the last year. So much stuff in the manga is happening with her character, we should really talk about her in every thread just like we always do.<br><br>It's not fair that we can't talk about our most favorite bestest written character just because of a bunch of misogynists who harass women in the video gaming industry.</br></br></br>  <br>No one is stopping you from liking Ymir or talking about her. You just care too much about what others think.</br>  <br>You don't even have to mention her. People who hate her will just do it on their own.</br>  <br>I don't.  I still "triggered" a shitposter though. </br>  <br>That's the case for any character people hate.</br>  Hey there, M'ladies. Janitor here. Don't worry about the shitposts, for I am already on the case. *tips his trilby courteously towards all the BBW in this thread*<br><br>From now on, any negative mention of your favorite characters will be deleted ok?</br></br>  <br>oh my god thank you so much for making this thread a safe-space and inclusive for all of us !!!</br>  <br>Curses, foiled again. *shakes their fist angrily in the air*<br><br>Looks like us LGBTphobic misogynists just cannot win??</br></br></br>  <br>No you didn't, in case you haven't noticed I casually started shitposting in this thread and then I just adjusted my shitposting towards Ymir since you were talking about him again. Shitposting about Ymir simply gets the most replies so why wouldn't I.</br>  <br>WHAT ABOUT THIS THEORY? Shifters do not live more than 30 years ? LOL</br>  Eren is best boy  <br>Historia please go</br>    <br>I like Ymir. She's lesbian done right.</br>  <br>How do you write one wrong?</br>  <br> strong independent womyn that doesn't need no man <br> done right <br>You mean done as every other lesbian.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really though.

Hetfags can use a bunch of blushing panels for Reiner and Eren, but what can you do? The page where she told Ymir to live for themselves wasn't romantic in the slightest.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>man we really need to take down the het-triarchy</br>  <br>She had her panties off for Mikasa.</br>  <br>oh my god...this is so deep!<br><br> mikasa kills historia thinking she wants to steal eren <br> as historia dying in a poodle of blood, she whispers her last words <br> mikasa leans in closer to hear <br> "b-but i only loved you mikasa..." (dies) <br><br>how Mikasa react would?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you're admitting it that you hate her because she's a lesbo? This manga isn't even about romance and that's the only thing going for you?</br>  <br>Historia was just trying to make Mikasa jealous because she likes her.</br>  <br>She blushed twice for Ymir and once for Sasha.</br>  <br>Oh my god, finally I see the err of my ways. Thank you for once again telling me that the only reason I dislike Ymir is because of her sexuality, it must be true.</br>  <br>Classic defensive Ymirfag, I didn't say I hate her. I just don't like and overhype her her as much as you guys do.</br>  <br>This. She fell in love with her after they bonded in the woods.</br>  <br>Yes, she blushed when she licked her in public and when she forced alcohol down her throat in public. That's 100% romantic blushes. And the nose shadow when she was looking up also counts as a blush so that's three times actually!</br>  <br><br><br>Her sexuality isn't fanservicey, or drawn attention to, it just is. <br>And her personality is just one of a normal person. She has good attributes, and bad attributes. She's not raised onto a pedastal as an ideal. She isn't a "strong independent womyn that doesn't need no man", she's just a person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> overhype <br>She's not even my favorite and I only see shitposting involving her.</br></br>  <br>I was just going to say that, but you can't reason with them because they think suffocating blushes are romantic. That's like Eren's blush when Annie was almost killing him in training, and Isayama said Eren doesn't like Annie.</br>  <br> That's 100% romantic blushes. <br>Well according to /snk/ no character blushes out of embarrassment.</br></br>  <br>I didn't "write one wrong" you moron, I intended to write "done" as I did.</br>  <br>Then you're not looking at all. It's either shitposting or overhyping and stupid theories about her being the mastermind.</br>  <br> Isayama said Eren doesn't like Annie. <br>Wew lad, really? Why do EAfags still exist then?</br></br>  <br>Why do YHfags exist? Why do BRfags exist? Why do shipperfags exist in a manga with no shipping?</br>  <br>That's because they're hiding in /u/ or the other place now.</br>  <br> and stupid theories about her being the mastermind. <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;111947860 </br></br></br>  <br>More like they fucked in the woods.</br>  <br>Because tumblr.</br>  <br>You know 90% is shitposting and don't try to deny it.<br><br> and stupid theories about her being the mastermind <br>Discussing goes that far. I've seen worse theories. Still better that whining.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;93699271 <br><br>Holy shit man, I used to be a fucking legend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> theories about her being the mastermind <br>Where? Last one I remember was that Mikasa was the final boss.</br></br>  <br>There's a difference of serious theories and discussing from ironic "theories".</br>  <br>*fookin legend</br>  <br>Can you please quote that post. I'm interested.</br>  <br>They seem really serious about it. And I'm not talking about greentext fanfics like , but actual theories that she's an Ackerman, her speed or getting half out of the titan is a special ability, that she knows everything about anyone and she moves the strings and that she is MT's daughter even if MT is younger than her. Also a titan deity. Fuck this, I could go on.</br>  <br>Were people serious about the radioactive cave?</br>  <br>Some guy actually made a compilation of all the vorpal claw posts.<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/115318<wbr>235/#115318343<br>Other than the "power ranking" post, literally every single one of them is not mine (so probably actually serious).<br><br>I didn't even know about some of those.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You did that? Holy shit the autism.</br>  <br>The compilation? No, I was on holidays in October. The power ranking? Yes. It's clearly ironic and making fun of autists like you goys in this thread, in case you haven't noticed.</br>  <br>The compilation is old and needs updating, I've seen some really retarded recent theories and the leaf tumblr fanwanking needs to be in there too.</br>  <br> theories that she's an Ackerman, <br>Eh?<br><br>Not that it's radioactive, but the people could have some collateral effect with over exposition to the crystal, since the whole thing it's too good to be harmless.<br>But it's up to you believe it or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That and the nation named after Ymir.</br>  <br>The Reiss have been using those caves for years and I don't think they all became ill because of it.</br>  <br> theories that she's an Ackerman <br>Nips assume it and then people also started to talk about it here.</br></br>  <br>I know where you could find a nation *of* Ymirs, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>They didn't, they only got down there when they really needed.</br>  <br>It just need to be changed to "Ymir is 100% a dyke" and it's perfect.</br>  <br>In the toilet!</br>  <br>Maybe Urie getting sick is connected or is it just because of the coordinate?</br>  <br>Or that she owned titan slaves. The retarded theories never end, I'm telling you.</br>  <br>Too bad Historia is an Erenshitter now too.</br>  <br> in b4 all of them come true </br>  <br><br>The sewers make more sense.</br></br>  <br>*Servant<br>Because one day he was a human, anon.</br></br>  I dislike Ymir but I don't see what's wrong with theorizing about her.  <br>Same here. I also dislike Ymir, but I think she's the best character.</br>  So by the end of this arc, the SL should arrive at Shinganshina and fight MT+BR. But if they do... what else is left to cover? I mean yeah, visiting Titan Village, but generally it always seemed like MT was the final boss. Unless he isn't and there is someone even higher-ranking than him.  <br>Why? Do you think she's best in the sense that she's the most original, or the most useful to the plot?</br>  <br>Wall Titans</br>  <br><br>Although I would agree that the test subject was retarded.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Sure you do.</br>  <br>I think we'll only see the titan village in flashbacks, the SL won't get there. What if this arc focuses on MT and BR and the final arc is about saving Annie and the wall titans waking up?</br>  Give an actual reason why you don't think Ymir is a good character.<br>Hard mode- no "she's a shit"</br>  <br>Why do people need to provide essays why they don't like a character here? I don't like her because she doesn't appeal to me.</br>  <br>There's no need for that if you're not an ELfag, but it's a fact that there's a lot of shitposting about Bert and Ymir here. Bert's mostly from an anon who hates him.</br>  <br>So do you just ignore the shitposting about others too or do you only care when it's someone from BRY.</br>  <br>I'm not going to spend much time on this because her fags annoy me and they're going to fight me for this, but I don't like her because she's annoying and rude. Sure her intentions are good but she's still rude and annoying and her smug face makes me want to punch her. Being a lesbian is always portrayed like a good thing even if it's neutral and she's too much of a special snowflake for just a random person from outside the walls.<br>I'm not claiming my taste is superior since my favorites get a lot of shit here, but learn to accept that not everyone has to like your favorite, it's annoying and makes you look like a whiny child.</br></br>  <br>It depends on which shingekis you like more, I don't like shitposting about manlet or Historia either. Others I still report though.</br>  <br>Because she's a one dimensional character who has no depth and is only used as a plot device. She literally had no value in the story outside of being a red herring (Ymir-sama) or the Magic Negro archetype who exists to unlock the white female protagonist's character (Historia's).</br>  <br>That's okay.<br>Shitposting, whining and throwing shit at other characterfags is not.</br></br>  <br>I see Ymirfags do that a lot, and don't give me shit about how I know because I do know. At least I can come up with some legitimate reasons for disliking a character and don't go full retard doing what you said.</br>  <br> An Ymirfag here  I'm not mad, it's your opinion, although some of those could be debatable, it's still an opinion. I agree she's rude sometimes, but that's part of being too honest.</br>  <br>Yeah Jesus we know that you know everything.<br>How do you explain posts like this? </br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but "good or bad" are just opinions.<br>But we can talk about the fact that she was only created to provide information and some depth to Historia. <br>So we have this girl with no story and a hard tongue, which only attractive trait for readers is being a lesbian and some vague attribute like: being a princess, being a goddess, being a princess goddess, being from a very special group. You know, the problem is her fan's obsession about trying so hard to turning Ymir into a snowflake while she is fun because she is an annoying brat with too many secrets that could fix many problems, but she chose to shut up because she is just a teenager.</br></br></br>  <br>You can still be honest without hurting someone's feelings.<br><br><br> How do you explain posts like this? <br>Autism. I don't like her either but I don't agree with these posts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why do you keep bitching when it happens to just Bert or Ymir. Drawing attention to it also makes the autists shitpost more because they see it bugs you.</br>  <br> attractive trait for readers is being a lesbian <br>How is that an attractive trait?<br> inb4 LGBT community </br></br></br>  <br>I think so too. I like Bert and I see everyone is chill about him as long as some retard doesn't play victim about the hate. Same for Ymir, the hate starts when someone complains about the hate, even if there's no hate in the thread.</br>  <br>It means that it appeals to some people.<br>Mikasa being the only Asian appeals to some, Eren being a ragetard appeals to fujos etc.</br></br>  <br>I like Bert too but I don't care about Bort/Blorty whatever else they call him.</br>  <br>Even when they aren't mentioned at all people will still make dozens of shitposts.</br>  <br>Well then.  I still don't know how this could be attractive in the slightest.  unless you fap to these kind of stuff. </br>  <br>Which again, happens to others. But you guys make it worse when you whine about it instead of ignoring it.</br>  <br>Ignore and report them, it happens to other characters too. The only thing that annoys me with these posts is that mods only ban islamfag, when there's someone who shitposts in a similar way about Bert and other characters, with names and reverse shitposts like how he makes his fan girl heart flutter and all. Maybe people just don't report these after all.</br>  <br>I actually dislike him and I don't really get how these names are supposed to be insulting. They just sound weird.</br>  <br>Just retards who think it's funny or something I guess.</br>  <br>They're not insulting but the people who use them do it to degrade him so it it counts as an insult. It's all a matter of context.</br>  <br> Autism. <br>So explaining exactly why a character is written like shit is 'autism'? I guess you're correct since autism seems to be the go to response by actual autists when they're confronted with opinions they can't refute.<br><br>In a way, you're not actually talking about the opinion - when you said 'Autism' you are talking about yourself - it is basically short for "I don't know how to refute this post so it's triggering my Autism.".<br><br><br>Is literally the most logical, rational and ad-hominem free explanation why her/xur/his character is garbage tier writing.<br><br>S/x/he, Annie and Bert are literally one of the worst written characters in the entire anime/manga universe. You shit on Levi a lot but even he is better than these three pathetic exemplars of desperate writing excuses.<br><br>It just seriously boggles the mind how you can keep deluding yourself and blocking stuff like this out.<br><br>The three turds I mentioned are the worst written characters of the series - whether you like it or not.<br><br>Jean is the best written character of the series -whether you like it or not.<br><br>Why is it so hard to understand? I am your superior, both on an intellectual level and a maturity level (since I'm probably the only well adjusted social good looking person who happens to post in this thread [for shit and giggles]). My opinion is objectively better than yours. You can call it "shitposting" all you want - you clearly need it to be able to sleep at nights - but it doesn't change the fact that I'm right and you're wrong &amp; that my opinion &gt;&gt;&gt; yours.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally the only poster worth reading itt</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>06638</wbr>  <br>Man, you sure have a lot of free time to waste on explaining your shit taste.

I can easily multitask to shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so cool, I wish I was as cool as you and not a pathetic neet who jerks off to being Ymir</br>   Get interested in SnK again <br> Come back to threads after 1.5 years <br> See this <br><br>What the fuck happened to these SnK threads? When the fuck did all these shipper fags appear?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Come back to threads after 1.5 years <br>Nice try, but the threads were filled with even more SJWs and Ymirfaks 1.5 year ago.</br></br>  <br>Sure NEET. It's the internet, you can pretend to be anything here, it's okay.</br>  <br>I wouldn't have to pretend anything, but last time I posted my penis on /soc/ I got banned for it. Mod has clearly saved all my pics to know what I look like.</br>  <br>They were not this prevalent. I remember it was mainly Anniefags and Bertfags that were shitting up the threads, but they weren't this vocal.</br>  <br>Nice blog. Now fuck off.</br>  I like Adonis Ape but I'll miss Mystery Monkey  Can't we go back to those times when we laughed at Manlet's shit jokes and it was an amazing discovery that Bert and Reiner were Colossal and Armored?  <br>what is dead may never return</br>  <br>BR reveal wasn't amazing. It was unintentionally hilarious.</br>  <br> unintentionally  <br>Not really, there was no buildup just because it was intentional.</br></br>  what do you think of Ymir's disappearance?  <br>I think it is very important, let's talk about it for 30 minutes at least.</br>  <br>So many things happened this chapter and that's still the only thing you wanna talk about? Fuck off already.</br>  <br>Oh yeah sorry let's talk instead about how Historia blushed for Eren and they held hands together. Bet you'd like that you hetfag scum.</br>  <br>Will it be changed in the anime like Annie's laugh?</br>  <br>I hope she's dead.</br>  <br>Both. I think it was perfect.</br>  <br>Or we could talk about motherfucking MT or what Keith knows. Or we could not force irrelevant discussion for a change.</br>  TheWeightOfLives<br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0QJar8Dw0Nb</br>  Guys I think Ymir is MT.  <br>No, MT is obviously Jean.</br>  <br>Keith was there at the titan encounter in the forest at the very beginning of the manga. Maybe it really was a shifter.</br>  <br>Possibly, Araki likes to make everything more dramatic. I bet he'll prettify all the crying too like he did with Annie in the final episode.</br>  <br>I just wanted to provide some topic to talk about, but no some fag had to come and shitpost it like a fucking baby, get the fuck out of here douche</br>    <br>Actually the extreme laugh was Isayama's idea. Araki just overdid it a little.</br>  <br>I don't think it was a shifter, but he knew Grisha so he might provide Eren with some new memories.</br>  <br>Maybe he'll also overdo Gesumin.</br>  <br>I liked how Isayama described it, but it wasn't how Araki depicted it, in the anime she looked like an edgy slut when that happened, while Isayama's intention was to make her like a conflicted teenager that is now free of secrets.</br>  <br>Probably. He thinks he'll be an evil dictator anyway.</br>  <br>Please no more forced Ymir discussions, everyone's tired of your shit. If you want to provide a topic, there are tons of barely discussed topics. Again, fuck off.</br>  I want Ymir to sit on my face and poo in my mouth and choke to death like that. It is a good death.  <br>Isayama said he liked it. Well he was probably lying.</br>  <br> wanting to eat Ymir's children <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>So was she gone because she saw MT approach and hid before he could spot her? Or did she strike some sort of deal with him and wasn't shown for suspense?</br>  <br>You are an idiot then, if you can't even talk about Ymir, gonna report you fagg.</br>  <br>Probably imprisoned. Some nips assume she escaped.</br>  <br>You are so right. Not only should we ban people who dislike Ymir, we should also ban people who want to talk about something other than Ymir.</br>  <br>I guess, but I always assumed she'd be imprisoned once they reached the village. I mean, who is guarding her right now? As far as we know, MT can only create mindless titans, and he seemed the only person around together with BR.</br>  <br>Great song</br>  <br> I wonder when Annie with get hooked up to the shit machine.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  Wait so the second compilation didn't announce anything for season 2? There was only the Hanji and Nick teaser? No other tease at all?  <br>yes, no other tease. Plus they animated the annie vs mikasa chapter 44 scene in the beginning of the movie.</br>  <br>Damn, would've thought they'd give us the season at least.</br>  <br>We can get news during the release of the live action movie, maybe august or September.</br>    <br>Those two look oddly good together.</br>  <br>Why does Bert have to suffer in every single pairing? Even the ones that involve him.</br>  <br> implying Bert doesn't enjoy it </br>  <br>Because he's shit.</br>  <br>Maybe if making Bert a beta in the spin off was one of Isayama's ideas.</br>  <br>Isayama and Chuugakkou-chan are friends, according to an interview Isayama gives the basic ideas for the stories and then Chuugakkou-chan improvises. Most of it is his idea.</br>  <br>I knew he's giving her ideas, but it looks like he is more involved than I thought.</br>  <br>He gives ideas and supervises the final result, how more involved can he get? The next step is writing it by himself.</br>  <br>Maybe, but it doesn't really matter. Chuugakkou Bert is still a cute even if he's not Isayama's idea.</br>  <br>I thought he's just giving her a few ideas for some jokes. Didn't except him to actually supervise it. So making Frieda a pervert was actually his idea.</br>  <br>I hope he gets more screentime in the manga soon, all the extra official content he gets is wonderful but he was written off the story for too long.</br>  <br>Maybe. Of course he supervises it, that's required for all official content. Not necessarily giving all ideas, but he has to read it and accept the content before it's publicized.</br>  I love how everybody here used to hate Chuigakkou before it got an official translation.  <br>Only Bortfags like it.</br>  <br>I assume the same applies to spoof, since it was also an official spin off.<br><br><br>Some parts are actually kind of funny now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's about the same. Only the Chuugakkou Bert and Erwin chapters are good.</br>  <br>I didn't hate it in the first place, but I admit the translation makes it a lot funnier.</br>  <br>The same applies to everything that is labeled as official, which also means Spoof, smartpass content, ACWNR, the VNs and so on.</br>  <br>Does CR also translate them or do you always have to wait for the full volume?</br>  <br>That's Milo</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Chuugakkou Bert is a miracle and I'm not even a Bertfag.</br>  <br>Hounori said he only met Isayama once.</br>  <br>He's annoying.</br>  <br>You need to wait I think.</br>  <br>I for one find him endearing.</br>  <br>Because he's beta.</br>  <br>That's because you have shit taste.</br>  <br>Yannopoulos?</br>  <br>At least for volumes 2 and 3 it seems to be the case. Not that the other chapters are bad, but they're a little meh. They all have their moments though.<br><br>His misery is hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br> you need to pay even if you want to die <br>what a shitty world</br></br>  <br>That's too bad. I'm interest in one of the recent chapters and I've heard the translation is kind of slow.</br>  <br>Yeah the latest chapters seem fun, especially the Frieda and Valentine's one.</br>  <br>Next volume comes out November 10th.</br>  <br>I read the Frieda one but which is the valentines one?</br>  <br>Not on my country. And I still think it's shipperfaggotry bait.</br>  <br>It should be at the other place I think. Reiner, Bert and Jean didn't get chocolates for Valentines and tried to take revenge. There's a lot of NTR as usual.</br>  <br>The previous chapter before the one with Frieda.</br>  <br>Oh that one, yeah I read that. Thanks.</br>  <br>I want to ruffle his hair. <br><br><br>http://imgur.com/a/NUbg5<br><br>It's this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's husbando material.</br>  I have two questions, how did ape Titan know about annie being captured? Reiner was extremely exhausted,so why people claim he git easly ass kicked?  Where are you guys getting the translations of Attack on OogaChakacowtipping or whatever it's called?  <br> do enjoy </br>  <br>BR told him. And Reiner is still the AT.</br>  <br>that was a mistranslation, correct me if I'm wrong, but Annie was never mentioned when Bort and Roider were shown with troubles</br>  <br>Thanks for sharing by the way.<br><br> how did ape Titan know about annie being captured? <br>BR probably explained the situation and asked for his help.<br> Reiner was extremely exhausted <br>How so? It's been two months since we last saw them, how can you assume that he wasn't prepared for the fight?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3862820263<wbr>?fr=frs<br><br>Summary<br> http://eleore.tumblr.com/post/12275<wbr>4170478/magi-272-spoilers</wbr> <br><br>The generals explain a little bit of their reasoning. Until now, they had done nothing to stop Al-Thamen from harming the empire - no one did anything, except for Hakuryuu. That’s why everyone (the generals, Kouha, Kougyoku, their subordinates, etc) should disappear in this fight. you know, except for that last part I was sorta agreeing with them… .<br>Kougyoku is thinking to herself what to do. Those two are not likely to win, especially if they use their djinn equips and extreme magic… though she quickly checks herself, as she needs to conserve magoi.<br>We then go to Koumei, who I think says Hakuryuu is underestimating Kouha and Kougyoku. They can allow themselves to “waste” magic in trapping the soldiers, just like Hakuryuu is using his magoi to strengthen his 100,000 soldiers. In other words, this was all an strategy to make him waste his magoi.<br>Ri Seishuu and Gaku Kin join the battle. Looks like Seishuu has been waiting for his turn, as this should be a battle between fellow household vessels. Kougyoku and Kouha then continue advancing.<br>Koumei says it’s over for Hakuryuu. He has no more troops, no tactician, and soon enough he will have no generals. He is alone. If he had had Judar, or infinite magic, things would be very different, but… .<br>Hakuryuu is, indeed, running low on magoi, as he seems to be extracting it from the members of Al-Thamen we saw a few chapters ago… until they reach their limit and break.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Nanaumi then chimes in, apparently pretty diverted with the whole thing:<br>“Oh, you highness, you no longer possess the strength to maintain your prosthetic arm? That’s bad! At this rate, your prosthetic legs won’t be able to move either. We~~el, I knew it from the beginning… it’s really disappointing, but this was a lost battle. As I thought, your majesty couldn’t win against Ren Kouen or his siblings, huh~~?”<br>Images of Judar, Alibaba, Aladdin, and Gyokuen flash in Hakuryuu’s mind… just as the symbol of his metal vessel begins to fade away from his arm… .</br></br></br>  “The image depicts the volume 26 special paper that will be out on the 17th of July, this time, it’s a compatibility test according to Yunan’s own judgement and prejudice.

He has the voice of a 20 something year old and he like 15?</br>   http://arashidono.tumblr.com/post/1<wbr>22863205450/sinbad-no-bouken-68</wbr> <br><br>Sinbad has been locked and punished for weeks, he even got heavily tortured (look at that panel with all the bloody torture devices) and he tried all he could think of in order to please Maader with no success. All he got was more punishment from the witch (since Maader wants Sinbad to yield to her and not to fake it). Because of all that frustration, Sinbad has locked inside himself, choosing “immobility” as the only way out from Maader’s anger. He doesn’t talk and barely moves, he’s like a zombie now. Maader realizes he’s gonna loose it completely if she doesn’t let him out, so she ends the punishment and hopes that putting Sin with her other ‘children’ will make him accept her as “mother”. <br><br>So, she places Sin in a room with 3 other kids. One of them is baby Masrur who is given the responsability of caring for Sin (since him beating Sin landed the older boy there). The other 2 kids (who are a bit scared of his attitude) are great fans of Maader and tell Sin how she “saved” them from starving. <br><br>Later, Masrur shows Sin around the dungeons and they met Fatima (yeah, THAT Fatima from Magi) who is also a slave, but apparently the leader of all of them. He is a big big fan of Maader, proud to be “her right hand” and in charge of “slave quality control”. Basically, he decides which kids go directly to the slave market and which kids stay with Maader in order to be “educated” so they’ll make more expensive slaves in the future. Yep, the Mariadel Company runs a slavery ring in the shadows… And you get the happy “Maader” kids and the desperate “soon-to-be-sold” baby slaves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> abnormal sex drive <br> Examples: Aladdin <br><br>Aladdin confirmed  for semen demon? </br></br></br></br>  <br>He is 14 years old here.</br>  <br>Aladdin - boobs man<br>Wahid - boobs man<br>Masrur - boobs man</br></br></br>  <br> Toto <br> Abnormal sex drive <br>I hate that pirate kid.</br></br></br>  <br>You mixed something: Olba is a pirate kid and Toto is his wifu.</br>  <br>  In other words, this was all an strategy to make him waste his magoi. <br><br>Oh, that's even better than expected. Good job Koumei.</br></br></br>  <br> Ri Seishuu and Gaku Kin join the battle. <br><br>Finally, I was waiting for them.<br><br> as this should be a battle between fellow household vessels. Kougyoku and Kouha then continue advancing. <br><br>Good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Left and Right generals are half assimilated. Seems that Zagan's household vessel can opponents life.  <br> can opponents life. <br>can suck opponents life</br></br>  <br>And Belial's household vessel seems can control people.</br>  <br> Toto is his waifu <br>And that's why I hate him.</br></br>  I love the art in this manga.  <br> Hakuryuu is, indeed, running low on magoi, as he seems to be extracting it from the members of Al-Thamen we saw a few chapters ago… until they reach their limit and break. <br><br> This whole post. <br><br>Well that was unexpected. He will win, but things keep getting worse and worse. First the army, now his magoi. And Nana-chan seems to be there just to keep an eye on him more than to help.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> are those the generals?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Yeah, they went full assimilation.</br>  <br>Agree, it doesn't seem that Nanaumi or her faction is going to help him. They are more like VIP observers.</br>  <br><br>fuckin noice. Now we are in business</br></br>  <br> Fatima (yeah, THAT Fatima from Magi) <br>This doesn't add up unless he was sold to someone else.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the art has been great since post Alma Torran.</br>  <br>He must have been sold to someones else since Maudaura in Magi - lives in Actia.</br>  <br> Now we are in business <br><br>Read the spoilers, there are already bigger problems.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, the art has been great since post Alma Torran. <br> since <br>It was always pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br> Hakuryuu loosing <br><br>B T F O<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/dai<wbr>ly-briefs/2015-05-22/magi-sinbad-no<wbr>-boken-5th-ova-to-ship-with-7th-man<wbr>ga-volume-on-july-15/.88481<br> "With this volume the OVA series is temporarily finished." <br> The editor then noted, "Someday soon, there will also be an important announcement!?" </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Looks good, hopefully these guys help A-1 with season 3.</br>  <br><br>dat jelly</br></br>  <br> implying he is losing <br>Theres no way after all he acomplished would lose like this<br><br>it would be too stupid. He will power up at the cost of everonye else</br></br></br></br>  So, after all that intense fighting with Gyokuen and Alibaba, NOW Hakuryuu suddenly has a magoi pool to worry about again?  <br>To be fair, he is powering up an army.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Either he goes even more DARKNESS or Nanaumi offers him some kind of bargain for power.</br>  As promised.<br><br>Thankfully closer to the 4 hour mark than 6. It's only 2 am here...<br><br>But whatever, you guys don't care. Chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His feelings still show on his face all the time, it's just that everyone around him has gotten almost as bad. The only reason why he's been able to keep secrets is that the important ones are so crazy that no one would ever ask about them.</br>  <br>He was aware that Alium was going to confess in the beach. Just for that he's better than 90% of harem MCs</br>  <br><br><br>But that anon is right, Asahi isn't bad in the sense that He can't be annoying because He's literally nothing, just a walking plot device meant to cause the girls' interactions. Better than a dense AND hyper bland self-insert MC, but He's still barely a character. I never liked his original characterization, but it's still much better than being nothing.<br><br>Inb4 but He's the normal guy among weirdos. Normal doesn't mean bland.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I also didn't mean that as a BAD thing. It's just how the genre is.</br>  <br><br>If you are , you wrote that His characterization got blander, it's hardly not a bad thing.<br><br>Anyway, if many manga of this genre share the same problem, it doesn't mean that it isn't a flaw, especially when it's something that could be fixed without causing side effects for the rest of the manga.<br><br>Talking about change, Even Mikan's characterization changed, but it just got much better. With Asahi we had just a de-characterization.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127315<wbr>126</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

But then little by little I realized I was learning something and enjoying the learning. So I started studying "for real". I read Tae Kim a few times, and did just 1000 words in SRS. But SRS was so boring that I stopped. Instead I continued to "An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese" and worked through that book. <br><br>After this I started reading VNs. Or rather a single VN, Rewrite. I should probably have chosen something shorter because it took me over 14 months to read it, even though I read every single day. It because part of my life. Then I finally finished it. That's probably my biggest Japanese achievement so far. And it was amazing what progress I made during it, even though I used no other studying resources during it.<br><br>This was just a few months ago. Now I am reading another VN, G-線上の魔王 while studying grammar on the side by watching nihongo no mori on youtube and other miscellaneous stuff. I am far from fluent, probably N2 level, but I have come so far that I am sure I will get there eventually. Quitting never crosses my mind because studying is simply fun. It's just a matter of time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>- Started with Kana, learned to read and write in two weeks. Spend the next two months writing people's names and shit.<br>- Rosetta Stone for a month. Learned shit like "kuruma", "hikouki", "hito" in Romaji.<br>- Spend about four months with a common phrases book and read it twice.<br>- Did RTK thrice. First time, I reached about 400 Kanji. Second time about 1000. Third time to completion of the first book. A year of this. Physical flashcards in the first try.<br>- After finishing RTK, I tried "reading" Tomoyo After by getting the overall meaning without knowing vocab, grammar or readings. Totally deluded that I was understanding it.<br>- Dropped the language twice out of frustation from the above.<br><br>That was before I discovered DJT and after seeing the no-bullshit-allowed philosophy and the guide, I decided to give it another shot. Two years later, I'm about N2 level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> derp 1 month with kana <br> study with rosetta stone <br> spend a whole year on rtk <br>Rough dude. Did you do RTK correctly at least? I mean, if you did at least you know how to write now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Enrolled in first year Japanese at my university <br> Spent a year not learning shit (unless you count kana and 100 or so kanji something) <br> Didn't even know of Anki, DOJG or Tae Kim back then <br> Started Anki over the summer since I planned on taking second year Japanese (despite heavily sucking at it) <br> Got to 700 words &amp; quit <br> Resumed second year Japanese <br> Didn't really do much and only learned some basic grammar concepts like のに <br> Eventually passed the course decently since I had a better feel for studying Japanese. During the course, I started using Anki again since we had to learn about 500 kanji for the second course and I needed a way to memorize words <br> Resumed Anki full time with Core 6k optimized over the summer. I'm now around 3600 words | 1300 kanji in <br> About to finish my first VN &amp; starting other VNs right now <br><br>I've been practically wasting all my time in those 2 years except for the 3-4 months up until now, where I jumped from 100 kanji to 1300.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Started with Namasensei and a notebook<br>Quit<br>Used memrise, and realized that it was rote I hated.<br>Moved onto Anki RTK + Vocab<br>Figured that RTK was retarded after a month, and switched to straight Kanji + vocab<br>Figured learning kanji period was retarded after about a year and 1.?k mature and only had vocab<br>After about 2 years, and 6 thousand or so mature vocab cards, I figured Anki was retarded, and focused on reading to pick up the rest.<br><br>I never did pick up the rest(at least not to satisfaction), and while I can read LN's I couldn't go a page through DanMachi without using KanjiTomo at least once. Looking back, I only see the insidious death of my willpower/motivation. And while I read Japanese nearly everyday, I can't help but to wonder if this was all just effort that might have been better spent elsewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you need to do both Anki and some formal study to feel in the cracks of reading. Reading alone will get you there eventually (in 5-10 years) but the process can be much faster.</br>  <br>Last time I did it, I did it quick as in I wanted to finish the damn thing and move on to something else. The radical and meaning knowledge stayed with me but I can now only write about 500-800 Kanji if I make the effort.</br>  I'm having a hard time finding an English source to tell me the difference between 行き　(ゆき / いき)    <br>ゆき is mostly only for songs and as a suffix.

Reading it through seems really unnecessary to me.</br>  <br>Sort of wondering this too. Almost done with TK and not sure what is the best method to go about learning grammar from the DoJG that's not covered by Tae Kim aside from reading and looking up stuff. Maybe the DoJG cloze/abridged deck and use the reference to find the pages of each card I'm not 100% confident with and read through those?<br><br>I plan to mostly read of course; it'd just be something to do on the side for maybe an hour or so a day to solidify grammar that's a bit uncommon or hazy for me.</br></br></br>  I took my time working through core2k and TK over the last few months and I feel very comfortable with the grammar now. I know it is only a minute accomplishment, but I was happy to get all the non-listening N5 example questions correct today. Thank you for the help I needed to get going DJT! Now to seriously begin reading...  <br> college is way more time consuming than a job <br>Confirmed NEET</br></br>  How's 殻ノ少女 &amp; 嘘ノ少女's difficulty like? If anybody's tried either VNs.  <br>This might be an idea anyway, good luck and never give up.</br>  <br>Honestly, no grammar book is going to prepare you for reading, even the stuff in graded readers is way harder than the example sentences in grammar textbooks. Just start reading and use DOJG as reference books.</br>  Is it better to learn vocab with the Core deck or just add shit to Anki while playing VNs?  Hi there, Steve Kaufmann here. Today, I'm going to make what I consider to be one of my most important videos for language-learners. I'm going to talk about what I consider to be the BIGGEST MISTAKE that most language learners make. This is the biggest mistake, the biggest obstacle, the biggest hurdle, the biggest /thing/ that prevents people from succeeding and becoming fluent -- whatever that means.<br><br>And that mistake is that people stay with the BEGINNER material for too long. They stay with the beginner book, They stay with the beginner course, the beginner lesson, they never get beyond it. And it's quite unnecessary. If you buy a beginner book, which I think is a good thing to do if you embark on learning a new language, that beginner book? You can use it for a year -- but you keep on going back to it. You don't try to master it. You don't try to learn it, understand it, you don't have to learn or remember the dialogue, the vocabulary, the grammar rules, nothing! It's just a bit of initial guide, something that you go back to regularly. As soon as possible, you have to get away from the artificial environment of the beginner course, the beginner textbook, or whatever the teacher has you doing in class, you have go get beyond that.<br><br>You have to get into real language. Now, if I look at my own experience wich Czech, uhm, y'know I started I kept track of it, I started July the 23rd, and I was looking at it today and on August the 4th I started bringing in, uh, using LinQ's quick, yknow, bookmark, that quick import system, bringing in articles from Czech newspapers. That's uh, y'know, whatever it was two weeks after I started. Fighting way my way through these, of course, clicking on every word, saving the word to my database, reviewing them, not really understanding it, ah, kinda picking my way through maybe 30-40%? Most unclear instructor &lt;unintelligible&gt;, I kept on doing it!<br><br>&lt;cont&gt;</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think it would be interesting to plot over time the number of "is it better to learn by x or y"/"should I use x to learn"/"how good is x for learning" type questions vs actual questions about the language. I wonder if it fluctuates much. I feel like we get fewer actual language questions these days, but I'm really not sure.  <br>You know what fuck this it's going to be like five posts:<br>http://pastebin.com/x0pejxwa<br>Someone can edit this if they want. I just wanted to transcribe it.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it me or he is always saying that he is going back to a language or brushing up on one without ever really understanding it.</br>  <br>Yea thats probably what i am going to do.<br>But how can i make sure i translated / understood something correct without having a good english translation for it,thats something im worried about</br></br>  <br><br>He's right about classroom language learning being a joke, but I don't understand why people here think the learning strategies of an autistic savant are useful for normal people.</br></br>  <br>Autists have funny strategies because they're shit at learning. An autist's strategy will work for anyone. That only difference is that it's easier for them to continue doing things that they come up with on their own. Note: Generalizing autism here, this shit doesn't apply to &gt;130 HFAs.</br>  <br>This paranoia will kill you. A translation to check will help you, but it can also make it more difficult to understand Japanese on its own. <br><br>I mean, think about your native language. You or someone you know have probably had misunderstandings about words and what they mean, right? That's just a natural thing. If it's common enough, eventually you'll realize the problem and correct your understanding. In general, if you read a lot, your overall comprehension will move more and more to a correct one. <br><br>For the record, I'm not saying that you should never look up translations or something. If something doesn't make sense or you're confused about a meaning, look it up or ask someone (or move on if you think it's not important). But don't think that reading without an English translation to check will somehow teach you incorrect Japanese in the long run.</br></br></br></br></br>  頭をさすりながら、何事かと辺りを見回している。<br><br>What is this かと?</br></br>  <br>と functions in a sort of adverbial function here, describing how something happened. 何事 is like "something" or "some event", and か shows uncertainty. It basically means "as though something had happened".</br>  <br>Thanks that was kinda reassuring.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Is と short for something in this instance?</br>  <br>Wrong here.<br><br><br>か is actually closer to a literal question mark here<br>何事か would be like "What just happened?"<br>何事かと辺りを見回している。<br>Looking around as if asking "<br>What just happened?"<br>Or<br>Looking around to see what just happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>50 hours a week (college) vs. 40 hours a week (full-time job).

The scale of the incidents doesn't change, but the new scale of the setting might affect the story in some way, pls look forward to it. <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br> Takeuchi says a big city is more fit for modern vampire stories.  <br> They're talking about how they did location scounting around Tokyo, but won't say which specific places are inspired by. They don't want the players to know what to specifically look forwatd ro yet. <br> The Toono mansion and the school are being remade in details. The mansion will still be Western style and will feel like the best place for murder incidents to happen.  <br> They're talking about the 3D image of the mansion that's on a different page. Takeuchi is making a 3D model of it, which makes drawing easier, but it's also hard, since he needs to create all the details and mind object collisions.  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror etc. and is really happy to be making a hype of game he likes. <br> Talk about how the mansion doesn't really look scary at night, but gets ominous at night, like Resi 1 mansion. <br>(cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(cont.)<br> They're asked if there'll be elements of local folklore/traditions - basically what people talk about between themselves and pass it. Since the scale of the setting has changed, it might be about how Toonos got the mansion and th lands around.  <br><br>[About the character design change]<br> Takeuchi says he created a more modern designs while for example keeping the image of Arcueid as "pure white" vampire.  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already.  <br> Nasu asks if because of the change of setting he gave Arcueif a miniskirt.  <br> Not really, but...

He did eventually get it, though. His current whereabouts are off training in the mountains by punching boulders apart. Hrm, perhaps "training" is a misnomer - honing his skills/innate talents, basically.<br><br>But yeah, that's kind of what I was referencing before. Even without training and while insane, he was still a considerable threat. Although, I would actually say the reason he's so able to kill while Akiha isn't is because the inversion impulse has shucked away his inhibitions. I can't imagine him taking on Ciel or Arc or a Servant even if he was lucid. That's actually why I mentioned his MEoDP which works on similar principles to Akiha's plundering - absorbing odic force. If he was actually primed for combat beyond his base mentality, he actually might be quite dangerous because he does have a means of attacking on a conceptual level.<br><br>However, nothing beats a fully-incarnated Roa in his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not using the Melty Blood designs <br><br>shit nigga what are you doing</br></br></br>  <br>These designs are five years old</br>  DDD2 ending was full trainwreck.

Kekkaifags can atleast stick to a single thread.</br>  Whether you're an old-time casual fan pining for the days of Cowboy Bebop and FLCL or a hardcore otaku seeking out fluid sakuga and the biggest trending shows in Japan, there's something special waiting for you in the world of Blood Blockade Battlefront. It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've seen in a long time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015 season. <br><br>The series is more than just a pretty face. Its soundtrack is sublime, drawing inspiration from swing and jazz ditties of the 50s to blues and soul standards of the 60s and 70s, all wrapped up in a burrito of modern multicultural mayhem. (The most recent episode featured Indian and aboriginal Australian-inspired scoring, right alongside its usual rhythm and rock.)<br><br>There hasn't been an anime as wildly creative yet painstakingly cohesive as Blood Blockade Battlefront in a long time, and it's a crying shame that it's only slated for 12 episodes right now. Its world and characters are so wonderful that I want to spend much more time with them. I can't recommend it enough.</br></br></br></br>  It was garbage.<br>Anime original and comic plots were mismatched.<br>Directing was seizure inducing.<br>Music was random.<br>Animation was okay except directing made it hard to watch.<br>Characters were butchered by cuts to make space for anime original.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not fujo</br>  Fun show  Seems like the Aoi no Exorcist of our time, Cool concept, shitty execution. Manga will take 10 years to be worth more than a glance.  <br>It's okay. The Black/White shit is amazingly out of place and they keep introducing then immediately pushing aside characters. Pretty clear they either planned it poorly or used up all their dosh in the first few episodes.</br>  Boring show  <br><br>It hurts.</br></br>  Please read the guide before asking questions.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>at least this one was not made 40min before the old thread died</br>  Damn that looks fantastic.

Do you think they will turn out alright?!? I heard their levi figure was aids but i have hope    Thank you mister postman.  <br>Don't respond to generic everybody replies, nobody reads questions.

Nobody cares about any of these questions, it just fills the thread up with nothing. We went for a good period last time were anybody asking for people to post their preorders would be told to fuck off, now people respond because they've found websites that make them all pretty instead of being the mfc thumbnails. Christ, I've checked the profiles of some of these faggots and I can understand why Stalker-anon does what he does, because it's always an 18 year old girl or some mfc-blogging faggot. <br><br> I can't believe I'm responding to one of these questions myself.

That's oddly disappointing.</br>  <br>Several artbooks. I made the mistake of using Sal, now I just have to hope my package arrives before I leave for vacation.</br>  Anyone pre-ordering?  <br><br>That's a very unpopular opinion.</br></br>  <br>You sure? I don't think even my sisters had shoes that big compared to their feet.</br>  <br>Her breasts don't look as big as they're supposed to be in that picture. Needs more meat</br>  <br>I liked that it was more detailed, especially her clothes. MF's feels quite flat.</br>  <br>Enjoy your broken figures and figures that look nothing like the protype. Most of their figs turned out shit. At this rate they heading towards griffon territory.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but Alter's has better shading and detail. Look at the cape for example.<br>The pose is less interesting, and the colors seem to be an issue, but everything else about Alter's is better.</br></br>  <br>Those tits need some gravity or a tighter wrapping.</br>  <br><br>Only people who missed pre-orders believe that.</br></br>  <br>But the hair color is wrong.</br>  <br><br><br>The only thing Alter did better was the boobs, everything else is worse on her; the pose, the colors, and the art style.<br><br> I still bought it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I certainly fit that bill. Don't even know why I waited to order her. Now I have to hope she doesn't balloon on the aftermarket.</br></br>  <br>Best IS</br>  <br>I understand you weren't here before that aired.</br>  Ugh amazon.jp increased the shipping rates for figures internationally. USA is now 1.6k per 1kg of weight (up from 1k to 1kg of weight), Europe is now 1.8k up from 1.2k to 1kg of weight.  Friendly reminder that checking your EMS tracking page every 15 minutes doesn't make your package show up any faster.  Just paid for Mordred and the FE:If N3DS cover plate which i was lucky enough to see back instock yesterday.  <br><br>That blows. Should've ordered stuff I wanted earlier</br></br>  <br>Fuck. I guess this is goodbye for me.</br>  <br>Check the archive. There's about 4 pages between 2011 and KLK, and over 75 pages between KLK and now.<br>The early 2014 ones are almost exclusively KLK.</br></br>  <br>Best taste</br>  Will NY stock the aniplex+ Rin?  Who ready for this month?  <br><br> IS <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>Still the best deal around I believe, between the japanese sales tax reduction and the fact that they use a 'cheap' shipping weight. IE dark angel olivia is only 1.7kg weight shipped (~2.7k yen), as opposed to some place like amiami which would add a ton of packaging and crap and it would end up being like a 3kg package and you'd have to pay 5k+ for ems.<br><br><br>Pretty much.. I was going to order like 20 figures and noticed the shipping was like 28k and it seemed off even though I have like 6 1/4ths in my cart.. did a little math and decided to check out amazons shipping fees page where I noticed the increase in price. It's not a big deal, but it is a little annoying.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384182 <br><br>I don't want to pay $100 now for something that won't be out for a year, mr shill.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384182 <br>Can't they range ban this fucking faggot cunt already?</br>  New Buyfag here, I bought a Super Sonico Campus Life figure at a recent convention.<br><br>I've since pre-ordered Junai Kajitsu Shii Kiya Cover Girl Natsuiro Shoujo "Manatsu-chan".<br><br>Don't really know what I'm getting myself into but I like it.<br><br>Been wanting to get into figurines for a while now, I read the buyfag guide ages ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd choice.</br>  <br><br>She's there now, but you can't order her. Not sure if she sold out or what. <br><br><br><br>I've got a few things saved in my cart, but still haven't pulled the trigger cause I always think the prices will tank after.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating all harem is cool man. <br>Grow up son</br></br>  <br>I like lewd. But I will limit myself with lewd figurines.</br>  <br><br>All harems are lazy and mostly shit, but IS is especially terrible. Just vapid wish fulfillment trash.</br></br>  <br>i didnt want any lewd figures but when i got my first lewd one i was hooked they really get my dick hard</br>  <br>It's between that and Alter's Beethoven. But I am not counting out wedding dress Saber or the Maiko Kyouko and Sayaka yet either,</br>  <br>I would get some tame figures but I'm not up-to-date with anime.<br>Most of the good figures for shows I watched before are gone.</br></br>  <br>what did he post?</br>  <br>I too, can't wait for best IM@S.</br>  <br> what did he post? <br>shill link</br></br>  <br>Heh, I do too, but what usually ends up happening is either the figure sells out or the price never drops lower than I expect it too .. and eventually sells out. Worst case scenario, the price increases.<br><br>The mika jougasaki figure just sold out, I watched it suddenly have a '20 left in stock' notice and some jackasses on amazon bought up the rest of the stock in like 5 minutes. It makes sense to do, but it's pretty lame. Once amazon is out of the way they can resell all the figures they bought for 1-2k profits or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Referral link shit</br></br>  <br><br>I never really got the point of reselling figures outside of exclusive stuff. The profits are marginal unless you have some kind of middle man cutting the shipping/fees. <br><br>Even the exclusive/long OOS stuff doesn't exactly fly off the shelves. Sure it may be worth 30k, that doesn't mean you're gonna get that much immediately if at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki <br>mah nigga</br></br>  <br><br><br>Well fuck me, finally a good looking Rias fig. I thought it would never happen. Embrace Japan isn't a great maker, but they're recent stuff has been better.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I believe the shipping fees inside japan are cheap. There used to be a 1 figure order limit on items for international customers, (don't know if it has changed) so I doubt someone from the USA or whatever bought them all up. <br><br>It was probably just some japanese person or business that felt that buying 10-20 of that figure at 7,800 yen was a good deal and there was profit to be made eventually. I mean if they posted on other amazons and stuff they could probably sell to stupid people for pretty big profits. They could also post on amazon.jp because the price will likely go up. The cheapest sealed version of that figure is now 10.8k, the people bought up the 1-2 cheap ones by 3rd party sellers going for 9k and 10k. Could potentially give pretty good returns, but as you said, your money could be tied up for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>See: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;119163536 </br>  Quality is ehhhhhh  <br>Fuck off to tumblr, landwhale.</br>  <br>I agree with them for what its worth.

The discount is calculated by an algorithm that mainly takes into account the # of units left in stock and the pace of the orders. The price of the item is updated around 6PM JST daily.  <br><br>So I read the guide, and saw this. My question is, if an Amazon.jp item goes out of stock which was being sold by Amazon.jp, will they restock it in the future, or has their inventory completely sold out? I don't have Amazon in my country, maybe someone here knows how this works.</br></br>  Fuck this. If I get in-stock or preowned notification of her before Alter Shinobu is released, I'll buy her. <br><br>Is anyone else on the fence about some figure?</br></br>  <br>Considering the way figures are manufactured, that's probably it.</br>  <br>There's no definitive answer.</br>  <br>But she's great.</br>  <br>She is, and I want her, but I already have four scales preordered in July because of delays. And I'm worried that some exclusives I'm waiting for will be revealed fully painted and readyto go in Wonfes and I might need money for them.</br>  <br>I don't own any figmas, but I've been thinking about this one.</br>  <br>I don't go out on a fence.<br>I either really want something and pre-order it, or I slightly want something and justify it mentally then pre-order it. Not much of an in-between for me.</br></br>  <br>Pic related, Pulchra is ass and I know it but the prototype shots look adorable.<br>No way I'm preordering this though, I'll wait and see how it turns out when it releases, hopefully it bins hard too.<br>I find it ridiculous that Pulchra charges premium prices when you can tell even in their prototype pictures that their paint quality isn't much better than your average prize figure.</br></br></br>  <br>Mio's figure looks better.</br>  r8 m8 b8  has anyone gotten their mushishi art book yet?

Speaking of mushishi I would kill for a nice ginko scale.</br>  <br><br>Who thought that base was a good idea?</br></br>  <br>Why would you waste money on this shit? You won't be able to pose it at all, either get the Thinker or go full retard and order exclusive Iona.</br>  I liked these threads when they very rare or when plastic butts were the main topic, instead of this attention whoring with figures.  <br>Thank you for your valuable contribution.</br>  <br>I am in the same boat but for this.<br><br> 6,890 JPY </br></br></br>   postal strike <br> package arrived at customs 9 days ago <br> don't even have to pay any fees for this  <br><br>Just do your job and give me my fucking package, DHL.</br></br></br></br>  you have ten seconds to explain why you haven't hotglued your figures  <br>You have ten seconds to fuck off.</br>  <br>You have ten seconds to fuck off back to  and </br>  <br>Too scared of fucking up the paintjob.</br>  <br>But I did.</br>  <br>What the hell?
