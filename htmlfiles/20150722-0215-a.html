[  [GJM-Mezashite] Charlotte - 03 [0B24EDE5].mkv   So is this anime about woman getting punched in the face?  <br>No, it's about GJM devs trying to trick people into downloading their "subs".<br> The punch was good spanking material though. </br></br>  This pleases imouto.  <br><br>No, it's about a young woman beating the crap out of random assholes.<br><br>Naturally, she gets hit occasionally.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Imouto must have descended from the heavens.<br><br>No hooman being could possibly be this cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, she'll probably return to heaven by the end of the show.</br>  When will they fuck?  <br> mind control the girl while you're fucking her <br> feel your own dick inside <br>The doujins are writing themselves.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If bad stuff happens to imouto, we riot.</br></br>  Stop sexualising me!  <br><br>WHY ARE YOUR EYES SO BIG?</br></br>  <br><br>Don't tempt them.<br><br>Imouto is for hair-ruffling and forehead-kissing.</br></br></br></br>  Rory  So is Rory an actual god or just some sort of priest?  <br>she's shit</br>  <br><br>Demigod</br></br>  Those are some cute as fuck pantsu. Not what I expected.  <br>Maybe a god masquerading herself as her own priest?</br>  <br>She's the goddes of love.</br>  <br>Her anime design would have been infinitely better without those fucking ears.</br>  <br>Something that sexy can only be he worst kind of Demon, opposing god.<br> A semen demon </br></br>  <br><br>Chosen priestess. Like a loli Chaos champion.</br></br>  <br>RORI is perfect.</br>  <br>There is only one god ma'am, and she wields an halberd</br>  I really hope anime gets to other apostles.  <br><br>Her anime design would have been infinitely better if they just fucking used her novel design.</br></br>  <br>holy shit those two have a kid?</br>  <br>She still makes me rock fucking hard and I don't know why.</br>  <br>Is the blue girl with the sword that mage girl?</br>  <br><br>Everything about her anime design is wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah. She's another apostle.</br></br>  <br>does he have a keg of beer in that row boat?</br>   draw a 14 year old <br> give it a sexy voice </br>  <br>But does she share power?</br>  <br>She's  967  years old. Figure it out.</br>  Name?  <br>Rory.</br>  <br> halberd <br><br>Cap, please. And she's not a god yet. The God is a lesbian with blue hair.</br></br></br>  <br>Rory.</br>  <br><br>I can't take this shit seriously. It's just too censored.</br></br>  <br>If not a halberd, then what?</br>  <br>I bet the elf slut doesn't even wear any underwear.</br>  <br><br>It's just a large magical two handed axe.</br></br>  <br>Is that FAL elf is holding?</br>  <br>[ ] Left<br>[ ] Right</br></br>  <br><br>Type 64.</br></br>  <br>Delicious elf</br>  <br><br>Left<br><br>In the middle of a battlefield.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Loyal, playful, immortal demi-goddess with ridiculous combat ability, a self-healing body, and 900+ years of experience. <br><br> Bland, boring elf with serious daddy issues <br><br>Hardly a choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hardly a choice <br> Hardly <br> Hardy <br>Wonder who's behind this post.</br></br></br></br>    <br> So is Rory an actual god or just some sort of priest? <br>Just to be a spoilsport, might as well spoonfeed.<br>In the Gate world, most gods are created by other gods. Some deities claim they are "originals" and were never mortal, but we have to take their word for it.<br><br>Essentially whenever a god decided to project his or her power on the world without doing everything themselves, they pick someone to be their Apostle. This means giving them some divinity, granting that person immortal regenerative ability and a pretty holy weapon that contains the divinity. That Apostle then has a direct line to the deity and receives orders to do whatever. Most of the time though gods don't tell them to do much. So they just walk around being their god's Avatar on Earth. Depending in the God's domain the Apostle get strange behaviours and issues, with Rory she gets really horny when near an active battlefield that is only satified by sex or murder, because her god is of war and madness. <br><br>Aftyer being a god's bitch for 1000 years, the internship ends and the Apostle graduates into a deity herself. At that point she leaves behind her physical body and become a god. She could choose to pick a domain of specialty that was the same as her host deity, or pick something else entirely. Up to her. The down side is that being a god changes one's priorities, as human desires are left behind. Who knows what really happens why you become a god? Are you really the same person you were before? Who knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've become a Rorycon.  <br> as human desires are left behind <br><br>Hardy sure disagree.<br><br>And it looks like all apostles are chicks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she does want to become the goddess of love once she ascends. She has a definite girly side.</br>  <br> Rory she gets really horny when near an active battlefield that is only satified by sex or murder <br>Confirmed for being utterly impure. Dropped.</br></br>  <br> pina drawing yaoi </br>  <br> Hardy sure disagree. <br>Hardy is unusual. Even her own apostle don't understand why she kept talking about marriage, because it doesn't seem normal for gods to desire such things. At the very least there is a complete lack of understanding on the part of the mortals, with temples barely able to comprehend why their own gods do things or why. And gods tend not to bother waste time explaining anything to petty mortals, even their own worshippers.</br></br>    <br> Confirmed for being utterly impure. Dropped. <br>For what it is worth, she tend to pick murder...</br></br>  <br><br>Sounds a lot like Exalted gods and their the Apostles are just Exalted. Although gods can't change Exalted into gods like they can just normal mortals and Exalted usually can kick nearly every gods ass but how gods work and the whole giving divinity to chosen mortals is very Exaltedy.</br></br>  <br><br>You needed confirmation after how she acted in the humvee?</br></br>  <br>meant to quote </br>  <br>There's a difference between being lewd and taking a thousand years of cocks.</br>  <br><br>She sure acted like she wanted cocks though.</br></br>   anime cuts out Rory panty shot <br>Really now, A-1 is fucking killing loli since 2013.</br>  <br><br>They are also cutting blood, rape and people getting cut in half.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, yeah, but this is just a god damn pantyshot.<br>Not showing her gaping vagina. Even SAO didn't cut those, and that had a much lower target audience for fuck's sake.</br></br>  <br> Minimal Nudity <br> Minimal Gore <br> Minimal Panty shots <br> No Rape <br><br>They're going to have a rough time with some of the later plot points.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is government funded JSDF propaganda. No wonder there is more censoring.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they're saving it for later.</br>  <br>That's hardy?</br>  <br><br>Rory already dealt with bandits like if it was fucking Avengers. <br><br>And the worse scene in the manga so far happened right there. They just cut it completely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br> That's hardy? <br>In spirit...</br></br>  You will never have a medic that puts a naked elf into your car.  So when will the Japanese introduce these heathens to rock and roll?  <br> So when will the Japanese introduce these heathens to rock and roll? <br>First things first. 3-ply toilet paper and polyester t-shirts. Got to introduce things slowly.</br></br>  <br>What about indoor plumbing and not just putting your shit in a bucket and then throwing them down the street with little notice to the crowd below every morning?</br>  <br>The Romans actually had plumbing.</br>  <br> Scipio Africanus animu never </br>  <br>Rory?

Some clothes is a real pain to remove, and some aren't.<br>Cutting it off right away is just quicker and easier.</br></br>  <br>They don't know elf garb. You wouldn't as well.<br><br>Hospital clothes can be taken off easily.</br></br></br>  <br>And they should waste valuable seconds before administering critical treatment, why?</br>   look online to see if Gate is edited here because I live in the weeabooest country on Earth (France) <br> it's not <br> found this though <br><br>Maybe the anime will change that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did they give her one of those mini vibrators or something? Context?</br></br>  <br>You cut the clothes off because you want to move the person as little as possible until you know what you're dealing with.<br> Hey this guy's got blood leaking though his shirt, let's take it off <br> Whoops, he had a spinal injury and moving him to check where the blood was coming from severed his spinal cord </br></br></br>  <br>They're at a battle field, but she wasn't allowed to fight at the time, so she just felt the souls of everyone dying pass through her, and it felt like someone was sexually teasing her the whole time, so either she fucks, or she kills everyone.</br>  <br>They shouldn't. Especially considering the fact she may have gotten a neck injury from falling into the well.<br>I'm just saying removing clothes isn't such a pain in the ass if you know how.</br></br>  <br>Ça va pas tarder à arriver.<br>Si witchcraft Works a été localisé le saison suivante de l'anime, y'a moyen qui ça fasse pareil.</br></br>  Rori finally got hold of Itami's 'pistol'  <br>Is that penis in vagina?</br>  <br> qui <br>Que*<br>fug.</br></br></br>  <br>All right, fair enough.</br>  <br>She literally has orgasams as ppl die around hur.</br>    <br/>  <br><br>Croisons les doigts.</br></br>  <br>Alright the first batch is here</br>  <br>Do you get pissed when Gate threads do French soldiers surrender jokes?</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br><br>Not him but<br><br> spend years on /int/ <br> become immune to any type of country cliché shitposting because it's basically all /int/ is </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, I don't care, it's an old and busted murrikan meme.</br></br>  <br>Basically <br>Sure you're surprised at first that your country is a running gag for most english speaking countries and I might have took the bait once or twice but now I just roll my eyes. Each country got his own shit to deal with. <br>Isn't that right, clapistanese fatass hamburger ?</br></br></br>  <br>It's fine. Murrika still loves you France—just consider it flirting.</br>  <br>*taken</br>  <br>You quoted the same guy. You meant ?</br>  <br>Yes, an aphrodisiac keg of beer<br> <br>Results in at least two orgies, the second time involving tons of elves fucking mermaids. </br> </br></br>  <br><br>Someone who rejects her because she's not "pure" doesn't deserve her in the first place.</br></br>  <br>It's hardy in Lelei's body.</br>  <br>So what's the limit for contaminating the locals with advanced concepts and modern artifacts before the gods decide to intervene?</br>  <br>That dark elf is starting to look like a best girl contender. It's amazing what assault rifles can do.</br>  <br> So what's the limit for contaminating the locals with advanced concepts and modern artifacts before the gods decide to intervene? <br>They are gods, not mathematical concepts. They do what they like, and not even the Apostles understand what they are thinking. It is seen repeatedly that even the worshippers working at the respective temples have only a vague idea of what their god want.</br></br>  <br> So why did they cut her clothes off instead of just taking them off? <br>The better question is why they removed them at all. A vehicle with a heater will warm the wet clothes and while not comfortable no one is going to die from wet clothes in the weather conditions they had. They could have just laid her out on the hood and let the vehicle heat and the sun dry her out. <br><br>It was a poorly thought out reason to advance the plot point of getting the elf naked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get that filthy anime design out of here. Manga design or die.</br>   write a story about Kakashi and his friend Obito out of nowhere <br> start a new arc and introduce new character <br> named Tobi <br> his only eye is the one Obito still had <br> same haircut <br> identity secret <br><br> tfw there are people who didn't see it coming and were surprised when he turned out to be Obito. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  They thought it was Shisui, Madara, and a bunch of other guys...<br><br>I remain surprised how many people fell in that trap. Coming up with stupid theories when the obvious thing was right in front of us.</br></br>  Literally nobody was surprised  <br>You'd be surprised how many were.</br>  Yeah it was pretty obvious from the get go. Question is was Madara and Kagura meant to show up in the end or was Obito the intended final boss?  <br>I remember a bunch of people believing it was madara. how fucking stupid can someone be?</br>  <br>It was so obvious that lots of people discarded the possibility almost immediately</br>  <br> expecting this level of complexity from this kind of shonen manga </br>  <br>Before Shin got his big reveal, I thought he would turn out to be Shisui, because all we saw was a Mangekyou, and that he hated Sasuke for killing Itachi.<br><br>But no, a meaningful antagonist with a half-decent backstory would make too much sense.</br></br></br>  I remember Narutofan forums fucking broke when he was revealed. Fucking idiots denied it to the bitter end   tfw i was obito believer <br><br>Feels good man.</br></br>  <br>ikr?</br>  <br>There are still people who believe he's Madara. <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/zAkBDA8zPFk  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Can we start circlejerking now about just how right we were with our prediction of the obvious?</br>  I would be very angry if Kishi actually fooled me  <br>I'm amused how in every flashback about kakashi in the anime either with gai or obito, they always portray that kakashi is the bad guy</br>  <br>When so many people didn't see it coming? Yes. I believe we can.</br>  <br>I'm actually more surprised that it took Kakashi so long to figure it out, especially since their Mangekyou abilities are near-identical</br>  I am sure that there is a SZS chapter/episode about "too obvious to be true".  Naruto's corny song has been translated<br><br>No Matter What Day It is<br><br>In the expansive scenery before me,<br>I saw only what was facing me.<br>That there is truth hiding on the backs of things,<br>I never noticed, and overlooked.<br><br>Getting lost, and taking the long way,<br>It’s not a smooth road, but<br>If I turn around, I know you are beside me, watching over me,<br>Kindness overflowing.<br><br>No matter what day it is, no matter what time it is,<br>I’ll never give up on what I’m aiming for.<br>If you laugh, then with just that,<br>It will always give me strength.<br>Like the flowers coloring the treetops in two colors,<br>Let’s start answering our feelings.<br><br>Even the days I look back on,<br>Not a single one is the same.<br>They build upon one another.<br>I now understand the meaning of warmth.<br><br>No matter what day it is, no matter what time it is,<br>The bright sunshine raining down upon is<br>Smiling with us and accompanying us.<br>These days that I want to protect,<br>The place where are roads meet, from here on out,<br>Let’s walk together,<br>And start today.<br><br>Understanding one another,<br>Believing in one another,<br>We’ll take these bonds, and drive them deep into our hearts!<br><br>No matter what day it is, no matter what time it is,<br>I won’t give up on the dream I’m aiming for.<br>If you just laugh, than with just that,<br>It gives me strength.<br>We might fail,<br>But we won’t bend,<br>No matter what, we’ll do what it takes.<br>Even when there is a shadow on our hearts,<br>Now that we’re together,<br>From this point where our roads meet,<br>We’ll walk together,<br>And start today.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I liked this part of the anime, i was so hyped to see this animated, specially the part when they kill Rin and he goes insane.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Q5j<wbr>nvfGgjGM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Is the author of the video 12?<br><br> Itachi is strong and he said this so it must be true! </br></br></br>  <br>Every time a big(key) event happened in Naruto the full Moon was there and had at least a panel dedicated.<br>Kaguya was always watching</br></br>  <br>...Jai?

This anime definitely needed quite a lot more trimming in regards to the original material. Two whole episodes with absolutely nothing happening is like an invite to failure.  <br>Why do everyone seemingly miss the point of the flying scene and the world domination joke? I thought it was important, bur i dont really know if this series is properly paced as an adaption or not.</br>  Chapter 3 of volume 5 when?  <br>El psy fuckingwut</br>  definitely my show of the season so far<br><br>Im just a sucker for good guy stuck in bad guy's body. Loved it back in DBZ, love it now.<br><br>But Overlord also goes to show how people treat fantasy games differently. He roleplayed an evil overlord, but as soon as he's the real deal, he starts acting nice and polite to his underlings. It is like a big fuck you to anyone that wants to suggest violence in video games causes violence in real life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh boy<br><br>ohhhh booooyyyy<br><br>yer in for a treat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol best OP-kun today</br>  <br> Im just a sucker for good guy stuck in bad guy's body. <br>You and me both.

This got a brief English publication by CPM, but then they died.<br><br> Medieval adventure with a modern twist! Bright-eyed Prince Star left the comfortable life of his father's castle behind in order to search the lands for thrills and adventure. Of course, he should've been more careful for what he wished for, because the young Prince soon finds himself surrounded by a slew of unsavory characters, and perhaps a cute girl or two. </br></br>  <br>Cute art style.</br>        <br><br>It looks fun.</br></br>    I've heard good things about Ashita Dorobou, but I have not read it yet.                                                        <br>I've read Girl Friend and I really adore the art. Thanks for sharing</br>      op, are you gonna upload this somewhere? i don't really want to save this one page at a time.                          <br>There are programs/add-ons for that, you know.</br>                                    Man, the author really doesn't give a shit about maintaining the 4th wall at all, does he.                                                                                                                        Has there ever been a more sensual manga than Berserk? <br><br>And no i don't mean borderline porn with tits and dumb bitches with their tongues out i mean pure raw sensuality on a fucking black and white page.</br></br>  Also related, Farnese makes my dick rock hard  <br>One of the better pages.<br><br> oh, shes not possessed... </br></br></br>  <br>Know dat feel</br>  <br>Would lick the blood off those pecs no homo</br>  <br> tfw no more crazy sexually frustrated Farnese <br> fucking CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT <br> they'll never get out of the damn boat <br>Why Miura why?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Farnese suddenly completely reboots her character from "sexually frustrated zealot currently in huge doubt about her own faith toward God and her own beliefs toward the doctrine and the nature of God himself" to "man i fucking love magic" <br><br>MIURA</br></br></br>  <br><br> entire faith shattered by guts/demons <br> only person you love doesn't want to sex you up <br> know the world is ending and you're too weak to do anything <br><br>Her change was handled well, I just hope we see Casca go from drooling idiot back to delicious brown tsundere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She can stay drooling... I wouldn't mind.</br>  <br>I will miss retardasca if this happens</br>  <br>Casca dosent want to remember bro, SK pretty much said that shit.</br>  <br>I fapped to a lot of berserk pages.<br><br>Rape ones included(Casca too), it's hot as fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br> gads <br><br>wtf</br></br></br></br>  <br>edgy</br>  <br>Eclipse rape made me fap twice.</br>  <br>Well yeah I tend to edge a lot, it feels better when you finally let it go.<br><br>Meh it wasn't that hot, other rapes were better</br></br></br>  Shut Hell.  <br> tfw you will never get to whip Guts until you are about to orgasm. </br>  <br>Are those dudes going to kill each other?</br>  <br>Think that wolf manga or the one with like 20 chapters of rape.</br>  <br>Oh, don't worry.<br>Shut Hell is giving Mongol Guts the mother of all hickeys.</br></br>  <br>Did somebody ask for wolfrape?<br><br>I guess that's enough Shut Hell for now.<br>Give it a shot, it's pretty sweet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the art for this looked like shit coming from the mangaka who did Hellsing, but some research revealed that I have been confusing Shut Hell and Drifters for ages.</br>  Is Berserk still running? Last time I heard about it it was like 10 years going.  <br>New chapter in a few days. Scanlations some time after that.</br>  <br>Well, there's a LOT of Rapefaces going on.<br>And that's kinda Hirano's specialty.<br><br>But in general, they share sort of a sketchy quality.<br>However I prefer the loose, scribbley quality of Itoh's art as opposed to Hirano's thick, blockey lines and gigantic black spaces.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The color pages are awesome, but the best pages are those with teeth. His wolves are great as well.</br>  <br>I kinda wish he'd explore the spiritual side of things a bit. not explicit them, just remember they're here. Like when Alfald suddenly had a conversation with Yurul in the snowstorm and when the dead warriors told Shut Hell not to forget them. They're kinda drowned out in the rest of the story, and that's a bit sad.</br>  This is the only anime in the Anime of the season competition. It is literally proof of God existence. The greatest anime to be aired. It has plot,action, betrayal, saints, best girls, bunny.<br><br><br>Why aren't you watching the anime of our generation?Why...?</br></br></br>  <br>But anon, that's not bunny girl.</br>  <br> bunny <br> actually liking the MC <br>She's playing you all for fools.</br></br></br>  <br> bunny ears for no reason <br>It's shit</br></br>  <br>How about bunny girl want the monster and humans to get along for no reason.</br>  <br>Watch-- The next bitch to show up is going to want his dick too of course. He's the MC after all.</br>  The ending of Season 2 hit me really fucking hard. Literally how could it be that depressing? I'm not the only one who felt that way am I?  <br>Don't worry Anon I feel the same. Give it 15 - 20 years and mars will be a colony again. The only thing martians had going for them is the tech, Every other branches of their military is shit. Now that they gave their tech away they lost their advantage. Especially when Slaine is in prison and their leader is retarded and Earth still has Inaho.</br>  The ending made me so angry to the point where I had a blank expression. And I'm as transparent as glass. It's just so depressing to know that Slaine won't ever be happy in his life and barely had any good friends.<br><br><br> Wish the UE would just use the new aldnoah to initiate an invasion on vers. <br><br>Are you kidding me? The reason why there's peace is because THE PRINCESS OF VERS ordered it. If she wasn't there, Mars would wipe them out clean.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon --&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</br>  <br>What did Slaine do to deserve this ending? His whole life is nothing but misery</br>  The best part of S2 isn't even the asspull where you find out the bitch, eggs, and saucebum are ALL still alive. It's when you find out that Slaine becomes the principal antagonist. Because then you realize that everyone almost getting shot to death as well as the entirety of S2 never would have happened if eggs wasn't such a douchebag and didn't shoot down Slaine's aircraft right after getting the Deucalion. <br><br>That's some girls name level bullshit right there but not even as hilarious.</br></br>  http://schara.sunrockgo.com/day/ind<wbr>ex.html<br> June 20 <br> tfw this psycho </br></br></wbr>  This cutie.   tomorrow <br>No one good.</br>  MFW Shnaiser<br>MFW Marina Ismail<br>Goooood....

Is 8th grade still loli? Or else I could look for oppai-lolis. Next issue would be the font used. I guess SaHa would use that.
