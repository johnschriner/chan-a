She's funny and cute, and is embracing the life we dream of.    Imagine her feeding on your dick like it's a coke bottle.  I want to feed her semen  <br>If I ever saw her in hamster form i'd slice her up with my European sword collection.</br>  <br>I want to molest her until she kills herself, then rape her dead corpse.</br>  haters on suicide watch  <br>Kill it with fire<br><br>Beat the corpse</br></br></br>  I like how this anime is showing up on other boards.  <br> everytime I see her I literally scream "WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?" <br> woken up my family twice now <br>fucking /a/</br></br></br>  U WANT MIRRION DORRAR?    I can't really blame the himouto shitposters, there's nothing else worth watching this season.  <br>According to the latest studies on what the fuck is that thing, feeding it results in an increase of attachment that will result in higher and higher food demands that will eventually lead to you being broke. And then you'll be abandoned for a better food dispenser.

There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.<br> <br> <br>I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a little girl as you once again type your little Umaru thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" masked man, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your MORNING COLA on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about an chibi imouto anime. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic meme-posting NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?" You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  anime was a mistake  You wouldn't a Mikan   Mikan special chapter still not translated <br><br>It's only four fucking pages.</br></br>        <br>I definitely would a tangerine.</br>  <br>Is it bad if I find her toes much more arousing than the pantyshot?</br>  <br>Oh christ, you're one of them</br>  <br>My moon is pretty shit but I can give a summary: Kids at school think Mikan is pretty, and try to catch a glimpse of her panties, but she's on her guard and they can't see anything.

I think she's made excuses like two or three times already. The author certainly wouldn't keep it as a persistent plot point just to have it drop like that.</br>  <br>I think that after the whole DARKNESS thing, he realized that without Momo pushing for the harem plan, there wouldn't be any motivation for the plot to continue, so he laid Momo's doubts to rest in order to have a functioning story (read: backdrop for all the shenanigans).<br><br>If it resurfaces, it will only do so because the author is in desperate need of some drama.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the chance of making more Ritos is too great  Riko however is also acceptable </br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say that. If anything, it increased the doubts in her heart. <br><br>She's now not really sure if she really truly wants this.<br><br> No other option <br>What if there was an option, however? We probably won't find out considering Lala and Haruna won't just go away but she's real close to shaking.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> censored <br>What sort of unlimited faggot are you?</br></br>  <br>R-rule abiding</br>  <br>That little spark right there at the lower right image, it's the spark/sound that comes from Rito slapping himself into his sister's tight butt.</br>  Is Mikan legitimately, canonically sexually interested in her brother?  <br>It's a play on this phrase: https://kotobank.jp/word/%E8%8A%B1%<wbr>E3%81%AF%E6%8A%98%E3%82%8A%E3%81%9F<wbr>%E3%81%97%E6%A2%A2%E3%81%AF%E9%AB%9<wbr>8%E3%81%97-603287</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Superior parent coming through</br>  <br>Manga nipples are allowed.</br>  <br> condom <br><br>No dearest sister.

Please Yabuki...</br>  MIKAN IS THE SOFTEST  <br>Nah, that would be sensei</br>  <br>I'd</br>  <br>Dear Lord</br>  <br>Why is this allowed?</br>  <br>Because you want to commit the crime...</br>  <br> That is 11 years old guise </br>  <br>Assuming you're still here or were still wondering. 花は折りたしパンツは白し is as  says.<br><br>The original expression 花は折りたし梢は高し is literally something like "wanting to pluck a flower but the branch being too high". The metaphorical meaning is 欲しくても手に入れる方法がない which is like you said, "wanting something but not being able to get it".<br><br>As for the meaning of 花は折りたしパンツは白し my best guess is 花 is being used to refer to her body/lewd bits and with her white panties being the obstacle that can't be overcome. It's very simple what's trying to be said which is that the kids want to see her lewd bits but she's on high guard against them. It's ironic since she's completely relaxed around Rito.<br><br>Maybe something like "behind white panties, an unreachable flower" or something along those lines would work as a translation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>12, actually</br>  <br>Could this be a good reason?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't see Mea in this thread, and not just regular Mea. Mea (Nemesis Fused), you motherfuckers have shit taste, your fantasy of fucking a sibling is good, but it's still not best-tier.<br><br>Nemesis's femdom and sexually charged body transformations and playful sex teasing.<br><br>Mea's sexually charged lickity lick fetish and psycho-dive that connects body to body on a deeper level, making you feel her pussy as you thrust into it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too old. Do I look like I'm into grannies?</br>    <br>Yeah I know the meaning of the phrase, which is why I translated it as being out of their league (unobtainable).<br>It's the text on the side I don't get. Maybe it is like you said, or maybe it's like  said. <br><br>I don't know how to translate it into English in a good sounding way either, but I think the "out of our league" kind of gets the message across decently but I am sure there is a better way to formulate it.<br><br><br><br>Mea is great. One of my favorites. I prefer regular Mea though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pedophilia is a core /a/ value, newfag.</br>  <br>Lolicon is, not pedophilia.</br>  <br>Semantics.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Some translator did it a few days ago m8, look in the archive</br></br></br></br>  <br>What, are you too much of a chicken to admit that you are a pedo, friend?</br>  <br> braided girls slowly unraveling into ong loose hair flowing down your back <br><br>you have no idea how bad this fetish is for me</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but not all people who like loli are attracted to 3d brats.</br>  <br>"Out of your league" doesn't' convey the whole "unreachable flower under the white panties" naughty joke though.</br>  I want to reach for Mikan's flower.... if you know what I mean.  <br>Pedophilia implies an interest in 3DPD</br>  <br>Those things are related.</br>  <br>Lolicon is. Mikan IS a loli. Saying Mikan is too old means toddlercon, which is a) FUBAR or b) edgelord shit, depending on whether you mean it.</br>  <br>Personally I'm more into babyfur.</br>  <br>It's still a chronophilia, just because you wouldn't touch a 3D kid doesn't mean you aren't attracted to a kid<br><br>The word you're thinking of isn't pedophile (a person attracted to children), it's pederast, which means a child-raper. All pederasts are pedophiles, but not all pedophiles are pederasts. There's nothing morally wrong with being a pedophile, but there is something morally wrong with being a pederast.<br><br>I should also point out that pedophile as a word is abused frequently, pedophile would be for pre-pubescents, for teens it's hebephilia and ephebophilia.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as much as liking gory movies is related to being a psycho who wants to kill masses of people.</br>  <br>Actually it does not.<br>Interest in children? Yes.<br>But is it necessarily and interest in real children? No, not at all.<br><br>There's lots of pedos who never touches a real kid or looks at CP, and gets by with 2D loli/shota.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>playing violent games makes you a psycho that wants to kill a lot of people, so its true.</br>  <br>That's the weakest bait I've seen in years.</br>  <br>That's not it. Mikan is the flower and she's been plucked as in taken by Rito. Get your mind of the gutter, anon.</br>  <br>Wrong sensei</br>  <br>Hello again.<br>I translated it a few days ago and now I have edited them. You can find the chapter here:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Yeah I know. I don't know how to translate it in a better way though.<br>"She really is a flower at the top of a peak, isn't she".<br>Does that sound better? Not sure if people will get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is the TLR i fap to the most.</br>  Older caring sister vs younger feisty sister?<br><br>Vs  Tsundere waifu <br><br>Whoever you choose, you'll share the rest of your life with.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Picking only one </br>  <br>Older caring sister.</br>  <br>You know, I'd sleep better at night if it weren't for the things Mikan does to me. Because of her, I can't in good conscience say I have no attraction to lolis.<br>I'd fare a bit better if I didn't know a girl about her age, who looks a lot like her. My stepsister.<br>As a result, the only time I'm truly happy is sleeping with my girlfriend, who knows what I am and couldn't care less.</br></br></br>  <br>But her lewd bits they are trying to see are her panties.</br>  <br>But she's my waifu!</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  TLR would be so much better if it was only about Rito and Mikan<br><br>If only Rito wasn't such a shitty MC</br></br>  <br>No, it wouldn't. The appeal of TLR is the large number of awesome women being attracted to this almost top-tier dude that keeps diving into their crotches.<br>The series would get boring way too quickly with just one heroine to concentrate on.</br></br>  <br> almost top-tier dude <br> Rito <br>You're joking, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you just say Toddlercon is FUBAR or Edgelord? How is it Edgelord? Last I checked Loli was only a few years older than Toddlercon, the two are connected and the distinction is only by a thin line.</br>  <br>You're right. She's 13 now. Thats too old.</br>  <br>Rito is:<br>1. Good-looking, of the same type of playboy looks like Yui's brother.<br>2. Very athletic and at the top of his school as evidenced by their sports intramurals.<br>3. Can do household chores well.<br>4. Can assist professional mangaka in their work.<br>5. Comes from a rich and successful family.<br>6. He isn't a shithead asshole.<br>7. Decisive during trouble.<br><br>And that's aside from the surprise factor that his body is apparently perfect for being a harem king.<br><br>We know Rito is kind of crappy for not just going with Momo's plan, but that indecisiveness is what's helping create the Harem Plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rito is pretty top-tier when you look at it.<br> He is very athletic (plays football, can carry girls in his arms while running, can run from assassins etc). <br> He is very kind and gentle. Always taking other people into consideration and wants the best for them. <br> Very reliable. Helps everyone when they are in trouble and is basically raising a child (Celine). <br> It's pretty safe to say that he is at least above average looking judging by the amount of girls he gets. <br> Never any problem with his grades in school despite being very busy all the time. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're exaggerating really hard.</br></br>  Rito is a good MC, but compared to the MC of Trinity 7, Rito ain't shit  Why is Nana underrated? She's best girl.  <br>Those aren't exaggerations. You find all 7 things in the manga several times.</br>  Mikan is 2lewd.  <br> 666  <br><br>Satan loves his marshmallows</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because she isn't 100% dere yet and slowly getting there while other like her who are flat mikan etc. have better qualities than her.</br>  <br>Tell me how they're exaggeration.<br>Rito does kinda look like Yui's brother.<br>Rito does participate and even win intramural events and has been able to avoid attacks that humans couldn't because of Yami.<br>He does chores all the time.<br>He helps his dad quite a bit.<br>His dad is a famous mangaka, and his mom is a famous fashion designer from France. They live in a pretty sizable house and that's something in Japan.<br>He isn't a shithead asshole.<br>He is pretty decisive when shit happens, starting from chapter 1 saving Lala.<br><br>So again, what's the exaggeration there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not even an Athlete. He used to be but that was quite a while ago. Also being an athlete in jr.high really doesn't mean anything.</br>  <br> he isn't even an athlete <br>The fucker ran a race in the intramurals and won first place.<br>In a recent chapter, everyone said humans couldn't dodge the sword alien's attacks, but they later find out that Rito "leveled up" because of Yami attacking him. Even before that, when Lala and him were stuck on the alien planet, the constant trouble trained him to carry Lala around running in a planet out to kill them.<br>He still knows soccer and has one heck of a kick, knocking out someone harassing Mikan.<br><br>You were saying?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks average. He's not Ichika or Kyon. There are many harem MCs more attractive than him. He used to participate in sports but not any more. Mikan does most of the chores. Being a mangaka's assistant is not necessarily hard (it depends on the mangaka and his expectations). <br> He is pretty decisive <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br> he looks average <br> using their personal gauge of good-looking instead of the in-universe gauge <br>His hair style is similar to both Train Heartnet and Yui's bro. And they both get their share of the ladies like Rito does.<br><br>Sure, to us, he may look average, but not in his world.<br><br> Ichika and Kyon  <br>They're plain as fuck and I like both of them. What's the point of bringing them up?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  would you a momo?  <br>AAYYO Cletus dont mind all the rough talk<br>keep speaking that granny-slappin’ good kinfolk sugar truth</br></br>    <br>I'd fuck any TLR girl</br>  <br>Lolicon is about 6-14 years of age, if I remember the numbers correctly, toddlercon is about 3-6.<br>So yeah, for someone who's just barely alright with supposedly 12-year-old Mikan, the thought of fucking a four-year-old is somewhere between fucked up and "look at how edgy I am for saying this"</br></br>  <br>Up and down and sideways, all day erryday.

Because you can't discuss the plot without sounding like /pol/, /v/, /y/, /u/ or /x/, depending on genre.<br>You can't discuss the social commentary without being told that you're from reddit or tumblr and should gtfo<br>You can't talk about dark anime without being called an edgelord<br>You can't talk about popular anime without being a mainstream fag<br><br><br>So what's left? Waifu discussions and talk about weird fetishes that even /d/ wouldn't approve of. From that point of view, /a/ is dead, was always dead and will never rise again. And now it has become a cesspit that breeds socially inept people polluted by values of a society they do not live in and that would not want them anyways and who feel like some sort of master race.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yami's butt.  <br>Anon, I hate to break this to you, but she's actually one of my favorites along with Nemesis.</br>  <br>Haruna got a fantastic body. If she was in some other anime I might even have rated her fairly high up on the scale. She is just so bland and boring compared to the other girls in TLR.</br>  <br>You sound literally like a fucking newfag crossboarder scum.<br> WAAAAAAAAAAH /a/ DON'T DISCUSS ANIME THEY JUST POST ABOUT WAIFUS WAAAAAAAAAAAH <br><br>Shut the fuck up and get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously haven't read up to the Darkness arc, right? Lala is more relevant than ever before.</br>  <br>Is that the part where she turned into a cat?</br>  <br>This might be a good time to tell you that we really don't give half a fuck about that. I'm more interested in </br>  <br>A cat is fine too</br>  <br>It's kind of a shame that focus has shifted away from her since Darkness. She was Best Girl in the first part.</br>  <br>TnM is a god and gives me a reson to not hate all women.<br><br><br>That eve one is so good.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Comparing Haruna to the other girls in TLR isn't fair. It's like comparing a less valuable gemstone to a diamond. They're both good, one's just better than the other.</br></br>  <br>Thank you, you've proven my point quite admirably. <br><br>You may also notice that you are the only one getting into a snit here. You even started stringing all your least favorite words together.<br>Why not add on "3DPD", "cuck", "beta" and throw /v/ in somewhere, you're already going strong, anyway.<br>You might further notice that you, the people who annoyed you and the people who are annoyed by you are quite literally the only ones in this thread who do not manage to stay on topic.

I've started conditioning her with incest anime when she was 14, but no results so far.</br>  Has Rito gone down on all of the girls at this point?  <br>No.</br>  <br>Nana actually has a character, even if it's typically shallow. Oshizu exists to be startled by dogs and cause wacky hijinks.

They're just asking for it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Onodera is even more shit than Haruna, and Haruna is super shit.</br>  I forget, is there an actual point to the harem plan or does it just make it easier to shove lewd into rito's face?  <br>5 seconds in google</br>  <br>Is this an intentionally 16-years-old Mikan, or did the artist try to draw loli and fail?</br>  <br>You must be the person with the shittiest taste in the planet</br>  <br>That looks like someone took  and photoshoped it</br>  <br> toddlercon is now considered edgy <br> lolicon isn't <br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>The point is that Momo knew she didn't have the confidence in being able to win Rito if he only chose one girl, so she's trying to convince Rito that choosing more than one girl is a good idea.<br><br>I'm personally hoping that Rito does go with the harem idea, but kicks Momo out of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Neither are edgy, toddler-cons get looked down even by lolicons</br>  <br> December 2012 </br>  <br>I'm hoping an ending were Rito goes full gay and marries Zatsin</br>  <br>Best ending ever</br>  <br>Right I knew that part but that's it I guess. There's no other driving plot factor... not that I'm complaining.</br>    <br>I don't look down at tcons</br>  <br>Impossible, I don't like Onodera or Haruna.</br>  <br>Because you are one</br>  <br>Yep, you just confirmed your shit taste, you should talk to that guiness thing, they may give you something for the record</br>  <br> that drop on his nose </br>  <br>Haruna and Onodera fags are scum.</br>  <br>Was it water?<br><br>Or something more?<br><br> oh myy </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Says the guy with the shittiest taste on earth</br>  <br>You know, being the guy with shiest taste on the planet doesn't mean your comebacks have to be shit too</br>  <br>Once again, you seem to be confusing me for someone that likes Onodera and Haruna.</br>  <br>Someone is mad Kosaki is best girl.</br>  <br>Tsugumi best.,All others a shit</br>  <br>I want to do criminal things to her as she's sleeping.</br>  <br>I see you're also a retard, I don't know how the Guiness World Record deal with that</br>  <br>Anon the only mentally unsound person here is you, since you have your head so far up the ass of the most bland girls manga, the kingdom of bland girls, has ever produced.</br>  <br>You should tell your legal tutor that he/she should talk about that record</br>  <br>I should be offended, but then I remember you're a retard so anything you say makes sense, also being the person with the shittiest taste on earth takes some credibility to your opinions</br>  <br>You want to know something sad anon? You keep saying my taste is shit and I'm retarded but all you're doing is showing how insecure you are in your own taste. It's not surprising though, Onodera/Haruna fags are rampant in their insecurities hence why I point out that they are scum.</br>  <br>You wanna know know what's sad? You being so retard you're having an argument over a girl that isn't even in this series, both of you</br>  <br>All I can see is that you can't defend your shit taste so you call other people scum, classy</br>  It's funny Mikan doesn't even look like a teen anymore, but an adult.<br>And she's supposed to be grade schooler.</br>  <br>All I can see is someone so insecure in his own preferences that the second someone shows a dislike for something you like you immediately attack them.<br>Classy.</br></br>  <br>Want to know something sad? You getting so mad over somebody calling you retard over the internet</br>  <br>Why would you possibly think I'm mad? Are you so autistic and divorced from human emotion that seeing someone willingly disagree with you must mean they are angry?</br>  <br>I WANT TO COMMIT A CRIME!</br>  <br> doing exactly what you're accusing other people they're doing <br>That's classy</br></br>  <br>Calm down, you're gonna get a heart attack if you keep being this mad</br>  <br>I simply pointed out that the girls were shit, I never attacked you for liking them until after you attacked me, at which I pointed out that your kind has long since proven to be scum.</br>  For fuck's sake, if I had Rito's power, my dick would spend 15 hours inside Mikan's pussy every fucking day.  <br>Calm down anon, being mad for some random post will make you no good</br>  <br> being scum  <br> call other people scum </br></br>  <br> I never did what I just did  <br><br>Your stupidity keeps growing with each post you make</br></br></br>  <br>It is more apt to say that I didn't start it, you did which makes you the insecure aggressor and me simply reacting to your whimpering.</br>  <br><br>Why does Mikan not care that so much of her ass is just hanging out?</br></br>  <br>incredibly underrated post</br>  <br>Is more apt to say that you weren't expecting someone with taste to answer you and that's why you got so surprised</br>  <br>I wanna say slut but that's a demeaning term, I'm going to say cock hungry or sex ready.</br>  <br> playing victim <br>And you dare to call other people scum</br></br>  <br><br>You know what, you two clearly need this win to bolster your self-esteem, otherwise you might kill yourself so fuck it, I'll give it to you.<br>You're right, good job buddy. Call your dad or mom or whoever didn't give you enough love and tell them that a guy on the internet let you win a pointless argument about 2d girls and maybe they will tell you they are proud of you. That's unlikely of course, but hope springs eternal.</br></br></br>  <br>You stating your tastes about other series' girls on a TLR thread so other people don't argue with you shows how insecure you are, calling other people insecure will not change that anon</br>  <br>Stop getting so mad because you got no argument to keep going, just reflect on your shit taste</br>  <br>you shouldn't bitch like that every time you lose an argument online, that's sad</br>  <br>Good, now go to your shitsekoi thread to fight other retards over the girls in that shit series</br>  <br>Seeing as how I was responding to someone who mentioned Onodera and Haruna in the same post that makes it open for debate. Regardless, see <br>Good job buddy, maybe your dad will give you that hug you always wanted.  He probably won't though. <br><br><br>If it helps you sleep at night sure thing, I am so angry that I almost had an emotion during this whole thing. <br><br><br>It's not classy to keep attacking someone who let you win anon, I suggest you quit while your ahead otherwise I might post more indifferent<br><br><br>You seem to be under the impression that this was just about one girl from one series when Haruna, who IS from TLR, unless she is just so bland you forgot she existed at which point I don't blame you, therefore it's viable for discussion in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's probably a reason why you don't have that power.</br>  <br>or because it's not real you fuck nugget</br>  <br>I see you're trying to get the last saying in the argument, that's classy</br>  <br> maybe your dad will give you that hug you always wanted. <br>Projecting isn't healthy, of you're so desperate for your parents approval you should do something about it</br></br>  <br> FUCK I LOST WHAT SHOULD I DO <br> I KNOW ILL KEEP SHITPOSTING SO EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD GET AS MAD AS I AM RIGHT NOW </br></br>  <br><br> HEY I KNOW HOW TO STOP A SHITPOSTER FROM SHITPOSTING, I'LL KEEP RESPONDING TO HIM! <br><br>You and everyone else in that conversation is a fucking moron.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing making me mad is the fact I can't fap for a few days and these Mikan pictures are on fire.</br>  <br>I like how you keep trying to get the last word</br>  <br>Well, Tiger Woods had that power.</br>  <br>Oh I'm not your sparing partner I was just commenting on your "making others in the thread mad" comment.<br><br>Basicly saying the argument is only making you 2 mad and no one else cares.</br></br></br>  <br>When was the last time a fucking banana peel got scared by a dog? Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>We don't need someone to be scared of dogs if we have a bannananananananana peel to cause the WAAAACKY hijinks that Oshitzu's fear of dogs causes.</br></br>  <br>But the ghost tiddies!!</br>  <br><br>Oshitzu is shit anon, deal with it. She's almost as shit as Haruna.</br></br>  <br>Oh come on shes not THAT BAD thats going way too far.</br>  <br><br>You're right, Haruna isn't so terrible that she could be replaced with a banana peel or a gust of wind. Haruna at least has SOME kind of story relevance, even though she probably should have been replaced with Yui (who's not the greatest girl but she's more interesting than Haruna ever thought about being and she's definitely more attractive.)  speaking of which anyone else ever think Yui kinda looks like a grown up Mikan? I mean it's probably just a case of sameface which Yabuki is generally pretty good at avoiding but he might of done it with Yui and Mikan </br></br>  <br>Yui is shit. Haruna was always superior to her.<br><br>And please don't downgrade Mikan like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Shes much more tolerable than Haruna. True, her shtick has just become scared of dogs, but at least its her shtick. Haruna just pretty much exists to make Yuki go dokidoki and give her dog scenes.<br><br>U think it might be sameface, Ive noticed it too.</br></br></br>  I pray for the day a hentai drawer gets close to Yabuki's level. I wouldn't leave my room for one whole week.  <br><br>Someone looking like another person doesn't make them that person or vice versa</br></br>  <br>I think*</br>  <br>Nah, Yui is just crap with even fewer redeemable value than Haruna.</br>  <br>Well lets not pretend all these girls (save like 3) arent just walking vaginas at this point. Mikan, Yui, Haruna, and Oshizu are all void of exception.</br>  Haruna is shit.  <br>Fuck off Satan</br>  <br>I want Haruna to stay, Harun-chan is sexy.</br>    <br>Fuckin' A</br>  <br>Getting them all except Mea.</br>  <br><br>Momo why you so perfect?</br></br>  <br> except Mea <br>Come on now hers is excellent.</br></br>  <br>That needs to be hotglued</br>  <br>I won this figure on a basketball game at some vendor in fanime. <br>Then I tossed it out.</br></br>  <br>Its not nice to lie on the internet</br>  <br>Wanna bet?</br>  <br>You monster</br>  SO WHO REALLY WAS RU? THIS IS CONFUSING AF  <br>Y'know what? Okay. I've always considered Run to be the worst girl (and she IS terrible) but at least she's had some sexy moments with Rito. Oshizu brings nothing to the table but a lame repeating gag.</br>  <br>Well obviously, but what about non-fucking days?</br>   he didn't read Steve Jobs: The Manga    Reading the manga when you can watch the anime   <br><br>Steve did nothing wrong.</br></br>  thanks for the heads up      <br> 3, 2, 1, dead </br>  Is... is this real?  <br> caring about a scum of this earth misanthrope miser </br>  <br> Crabing <br> Crabs are the animal sign of cancer <br> Steve Jobs died from cancer <br><br>Aria was pretty redpilled</br></br></br></br></br>  Why some people said Steve Job is a psychopath?  <br>http://slated.org/good_riddance_ste<wbr>ve_jobs</wbr></br>  Steve Jobs was an autistic poser who threw childish hissy fits.  <br>fuckin nips need to learn to read actual books<br><br><br> crabing <br>triggered triggered triggered</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He supported a system of sweatshop labor and earned the most profits in the history of mankind by then using extremely aggressive marketing(i.e brainwashing) to charge people 500 dollars plus for something worth maybe total 30 dollars. <br>He literally invented the term 'designer electronics'. Now, as to if this is really a bad thing after all thats up for discussion, but many many many people suffered and still suffer because of apple.</br></br>  Get out.  <br><br><br><br>no way this is real</br></br></br></br>  Does it explain the origin of his turtleneck sweater?  <br> On a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony's chairman Akio Morita why everyone in the company's factories wore uniforms. He told Jobs that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day. Over the years, the uniforms developed their own signatures styles, especially at companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to the company. "I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple," Jobs recalled. <br> Sony, with its appreciation for style, had gotten the famous designer Issey Miyake to create its uniform. It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest. So Jobs called Issey Miyake and asked him to design a vest for Apple, Jobs recalled, "I came back with some samples and told everyone it would great if we would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea." <br> In the process, however, he became friends with Miyake and would visit him regularly. He also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style. "So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them." Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so he showed them stacked up in the closet. "That's what I wear," he said. "I have enough to last for the rest of my life." </br></br></br>  <br> he showed them stacked up in the closet. "That's what I wear," he said. "I have enough to last for the rest of my life." </br>  <br>Oh wow, that's pretty interesting.<br> It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest <br>Kinda like those cargo pants that has zips around the knees that dads like to wear? Good lord.</br></br></br>  <br>80s Jobs was a really weird dude tbh.<br><br>Time he spent building NeXT and Pixar after getting fired from Apple taught him a lot of things, I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet 1000 times better than rms.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jsk<wbr>q3-lpQnE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Steve Jobs <br> not manga about Lord Richard Matthew Stallman <br><br>are you even GNU anon?</br></br></br></br>  fuck off of my board cancer  <br> for the rest of my life." <br><br>So he had 3 turtlenecks?</br></br></br>  <br>It said he made about a hundred of them, can you not read?</br>  <br>he also loved retarded patents so he could sue everyone he could<br>for things like rounded corners and other shit.</br></br>  I'd rather read the Bill Gates manga.  <br>Based Bill</br>  <br>Now I want a Xerox manga. It would be a tragedy, of course.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>never knew about the manga but there is a steve jobs book and it doesnt look like autobiography, I might pick it up one day at my library, Ive never bought an iphone and ive only ever bought only one ipod 3g but i would like to find out why some people idolize this guy.</br>  <br>No one really stole from Xerox. They were completely unwilling to do anything with their computer research division. It was only after Apple launched the Macintosh that they thought "Oh right, home computing might be cool."</br>  <br>That's generally the desired outcome of brainwashing.</br>  <br>I imagine a slice of life, with a conspiracy going under that adds comedy touches due to RMS's inability to be taken seriously.</br>  <br>Could they find a douchier photo to put on the cover?</br>  <br> happy mac'ing </br>  <br>Why?

Rather a selfish arsehole like Jobs than the tyrant responsible for Common Core. He should have died of cancer instead.</br>  <br> No need to throw a hissy fit for an autograph signing. <br>That doesn't sound like rms.</br></br>   reading a Story about greedy copyrights thief with unbeliveable jew marketing style <br> not reading Story about ritchie, linus, rubin, or bill gates <br><br><br>i thought /a/ is full with clever people.........</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a joke because that macbook no longer has mac os installed</br>  <br> i thought /a/ is full with clever people......... <br>I wouldn't think /a/ is full of clever people if I saw someone end a sentence with nine full stops.</br></br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  WUT THE FUCK IS THIS BOARD  <br>Not remotely.

Just shut up and let them be.</br></br></br>  I met Steve Jobs and Tim Cook at an Apple expo a while ago, I went with my girlfriend. When we approached them Jobs looked at me, then at my girlfriend and said, "The fuck you doing with this stupid cunt? Get with this dick or get wrecked you whore." I was completely shocked and didn't know if he was joking so I stood in silence just not sure of what to say. Then a voice was heard from behind him "Oh Steve you found another goofball?", "Yeah Tim, this one looks like a complete dick head, his girlfriend is pretty banging though, I'd fuck her asshole", "Oh yeah, maybe we should fill his girlfriend's ass with goofballs so she'd know how much of a goofball he is". Right at that moment Jobs jumped on my girlfriend and pulled her pants down, I tried to stop him but Tim jumped on me and held me down. He started whispering in my ear "She's gonna get the goofballs and you ain't going to do a thing about it!" I watched on in horror as my girlfriend stared at me in the eyes as Jobs undressed her and rammed his fingers up her ass, she was trying to scream but Jobs just kept pushing her head down. Jobs looked at me and mouthed the words "a-p-p-l-e dot com", It was like a silent movie, I watched as Jobs then proceeded to pull out his testicles and forcibly push them into her anus with his hands. Tim who was still holding me down started to squeal into my ear "She's getting the goofballs", he started to twist my nipple as far as it could go, and I could feel blood trickling from it onto my shirt, I felt what I can assume was Tim's boner pushing into my back... I blacked out.  <br><br>Macfag here, the only real problem I've had with mine is the occasional overheating and not being able to run .exe but the latter is easy to work around.

It was worse than GSD. </br></br>  That's not M.D. Geist 'Colon' Deathforce  Who's the cuck on the bottom right?  G Reco  GSD&gt;VVV&gt;A/Z  Captain Earth is worse.  <br>CE has Bones traditional animation at least. It's not overwhelmingly beautiful like Star Driver and E7 but it's still pretty nonetheless. Shitnoah Zero has ugly as shit CGI mechs.</br>  <br>Aldnoah was mecha?</br>  <br>Better than G Reco.</br>  Dai Shogun is worse<br>Also, Ginguiser</br>  <br>I don't get everyone who says Aldnoah's animation was shit. Have you innocent virgins never seen actually bad animation before?</br>  A Wakening of Trailblazer is the worst  <br> CE has Bones traditional animation at least. <br>That just makes it worse. The fact they wasted all that beautiful animation and great OST on boring trash that goes nowhere and does nothing. Writing that assassinates any possibly tension, character drama that is preemptively resolved before it can get interesting. Pitiful attempts at fanservice neutered by Bones' prudish standards. <br><br>CE is a waste of everyone's time, including Bones'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it looked decent, that shitty mecha this season is far worse.</br>  <br>You actually thought that drab CG looked good?</br>  Evangelion  Aldnoah was FUN  <br>What, you mean the generic as fuck one starring les SAO man?</br>  <br>Cuck of the year.</br>  <br> all those mechashows in the season <br> so much hype was build up <br> most of them werent as good as expected <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> mecha <br> ever good </br></br></br>  <br>No idea, that with the 50 min first episode, not that I watched even half of it.

CE <br> bad <br>ebin shitposting meme</br></br>  Rather, what's the BEST mecha from the last ten years? I don't watch mecha a lot but most of the modern mecha shows that I've seen are garbage, Frontier is the only one I really loved (and is not even completely mecha, it's more half mecha half idol anime).  <br>Nah, same shit as Kill la Kill, it just somehow got extremely hyped. It's still plain bad.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628820 <br> Only watched 3 episodes <br> Thinks he can judge the entire show <br>Keep being retarded and shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was fun to watch with /a/. Stupid shit can still be fun. <br><br>CE is just boring though. Nobody had fun with it. Animators worked their fingers down to bloody nubs doing the action and transformation sequences and it just turned out so fucking dull. You could conceivably skip every action sequence in CE and not miss anything important. That's how bad it was.</br></br></br>  <br> Frontier is the only one I really loved <br>Opinion disregarded</br></br>  <br>Code Geass</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628937 <br>Thing is, you can't say it's overrated just because you don't like the first few episodes, when it gets really great later on</br>  <br>People actually thought Kill La Kill was good though. However KlK was also really fun to watch. <br><br>Everyone knew Cross Ange was shit but watched it anyways because it was hilariously bad. <br><br>The only way they're similar is they were both fun rides with shitty writing. The reasons they're fun to watch is completely different and in terms of actual quality Cross Ange is much lower.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shin Mazinger and SRW OGIN</br>  <br> last ten years <br>Eureka Seven</br></br>  <br>Koutetsushin Jeeg</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628937 <br>Then you say it didn't impress you, you didn't see enough to say it's overrated.

I could watch KlK while Cross Ange was so bad I just couldn't watch it, I even tried picking it up again at episode 16 or so but had to drop it after some minutes. Utter shit. I'd say that Aldnoah Zero is better than both.</br>  <br>Yeah...3 months ago</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629286 <br> G gundam is a tournament <br>You couldn't be more wrong</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629286 <br> G gundam is a tournament <br>The part you watched.

Worst mecha series in recent memory is probably M3 The Dark Metal.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd say best mecha period including everything is Gundam Unicorn. Best mecha on TV is probably Knights of Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>Goddannar</br>  <br>Vulvarape is probably the worst</br>  <br><br>Definitely the most massively overhyped one for what it ended up delivering. Remember this is the series that Aniplex constructed and assembled another super team of popular creators (only one of which had any remote experience or insight into mecha anime and left the project 3 episodes in) ala Madoka Magica to try to start a franchise that would in it's presidents own words supersede Gundam. It's like they thought literally all they needed was a magic quartet of Urobuchi, Sawano, Aoki and Kajiura with their darling Sora Amamiya as the female lead and everything else would magically just fall into place.<br><br>Granted it worked for a while and then Butcher fanboys found out he wasn't writing the scripts anymore and TIMBEEEEEEEEEER!!!! Realistically that's all it took, like the show was actually charting really well before he confirmed his level of involvement on twitter and various conventions. If Aniplex had just kept that in check and tried to act like he was still writing the scripts maybe things would have turned out differently at least financially for the series. As it is now it will probably sell worse than even G-Reco which it's creator actively tried to sabotage commercially which is hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was fun, especially with /a/ though</br>  <br>The amount of hype and self-glorification was beyond ridiculous for what the show ended up being.</br>  <br> I'd say best mecha period including everything is Gundam Unicorn </br>  <br>Shin Mazinger Z a best</br>  Aldnoah.Zero have some serious problems, especially on it's second half.<br><br>It's still not as bad as Gundam Seed Destiny though. Actually everything that is bad on AZ, Gundam Seed Destiny is able to do worst.</br></br>  <br> episode 16 <br>There's your problem. DRAGON world was the most boring part of the show.</br></br>  <br> If Aniplex had just kept that in check and tried to act like he was still writing the scripts maybe things would have turned out differently at least financially for the series <br>No sane person would approve of this kind of shit writing we had in A.Z.

Make some fucking videos already.</br></br>  <br>If Aldnoah is the best mecha in the last 10 years then mecha has been a pretty shit genre for a while<br>I don't even watch mecha and I know you're wrong</br></br>  <br><br> Urobuch, writer of supreme skill who plum the deepest recesses of the mind </br></br>  <br>Logos has actually been decent so far. No Akino or inserts, but it's been getting better each episode and the cast has been more likable than EVOL's. You get used to the character designs fast.</br>  <br>Yea thats kind of why that other comment kinda triggered me. I also actually like the cast and the themes.</br>  I gotta say I was avoiding mecha for a long ass time and I've just started watching Gundam 0080 war in the pocket and it's been pretty damn good. Apparently Zeta Gundam is even better?  It's not so bad compared to the really horrible crap like Gundam AGE, G-Reco or Dai Shogun. <br><br>It's in the same tier of mediocrity with the likes of Valvrave, Majestic Prince and Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>That's not MLA: TE.</br>  <br> Gundam AGE <br><br>Isn't that the Gundam that was so horrific that Bandai pretends that it doesn't exist?</br></br></br>  <br><br>0080 is the best Gundam<br>Zeta Gundam tries too hard to be mature and and ends up being a mess of a show</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was watchable unlike aldnoah zero.</br>  <br><br> G Reco <br> crap <br><br>Here's your reply</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This unit is PANICKED and used HUNKER DOWN.</br></br>  <br>Aldnoah zero was complete shit. Valvrave has it's flaw but it was a lot more fun to watch than Inaho shit.</br>  <br>It's pretty bad tbh and only Tomino-fags defend it to death anyway.</br>  <br><br> wanting more reviews from a guy who think KnK is one of KyoAni's best works </br></br>  <br><br>Both are shit. I wonder when this "G-reco is an misunderstood masterpiece" meme will stop...</br></br>  Aldnoah S2 could've been much, much better but I suspect they would've needed more episode and more time to properly write them.<br><br>It's pretty funny that the series was hammering home how UNDERSTANDING wasn't going to stop the war, but Peace Princess and Prince I Fucked Ur Waifu show up and magic the entire war away using the magic of DIPLOMACY and UNDERSTANDING.</br></br>  <br>Funnily enough, I dont even remember the ending of A/Z S2 but quite clearly remember how the first season ended.</br>  <br><br> That description <br><br>So it is like Top Gear,  ambitious but rubbish </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You have to rewatch G Reco three times, then you will understand why is a masterpiece ahead of its time.</br></br></br>  <br>Calling AZ ambitious is a bit much, it's pretty much just a combination of mecha tropes that never goes anywhere.</br>  <br>It definitely was ambitious<br>The staff were saying stuff like "it will surpass Gundam" before it aired ,and hyped it to death<br>Of course , it ended up being shit</br></br></br>  <br>AKB0048,Inb4 idolshit.</br>   yfw Majestic Prince   <br>This is the biggest waste of potential I have ever seen.<br>Its literally the most ambitious show ever made but fuck it we suck.</br></br>  <br>Fafner</br>  <br><br>That's Hino fault because he cannot into writing TV shows due to him using video game writing logic, and let's not forget this gem:<br><br> Made ambitious goal that the PSP games tie-in would sell 1 million copies <br> Sold less than 10% of its target (both games sold around 70k combined) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Worst. When fucking Gundam V exists.</br></br>  I don't know, g-reco was pretty fucking bad  <br>The staff had ambitions but the work itself did very little to back that up.</br>  A/Z and Build Babies Try are easily the worst  <br> hating on V gundam </br>  <br>Hino sucks at writing video games. Who's bright idea was it to give him control over something he has no experience with?</br>  Yeah Aldnoah Zero or Captain Earth for sure, Two if the biggest jokes.<br><br>Mecha genre is fucking dying anyway, It's too predictable and boring that no one wants to do it any more apart from Gundamn stuff.</br></br>  <br>ufotable did Kara no Kyoukai though.</br>  <br>KnK as in Kyoukai no Kanata.<br>Kudos for thinking of Kara no Kyoukai though.</br></br>  <br><br> wanting more worthless opinions from an Urobuchifag </br></br>  <br>That's actually the joke. If you were to say something like "I'm so fucking mad that Bones screwed over ZnT", I would have said "But J.C Staff/Mappa did Zero no Tsukaima/Zankyou no Terror!”. It’s not really that funny, but the point still stands.</br>  <br><br>From WONFES.</br></br>  <br>Star Driver</br>  <br>I absolutely love 0048 but have a very difficult time calling it a mecha show. It has mecha in it, sure, but it's a pretty minor aspect of the show.</br>  <br> Urobuchifag <br>If that were the case wouldn't he have mindlessly given Aldnoah a 10/10 just because Butcher worked on the first couple episodes?</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the video? Half of it was spent apologizing for Urobuchi's involvement. He claimed the reason it sucked was because Urobuchi wrote a few episodes, outlined the plot, and then fucked off.</br>  <br>The first couple of episodes were pretty okay. Bellybutton magic was fantastic. After that, it all kind of petered out in a pathetic manner though. Not even those glorious handdrawn mecha fights could keep me there.</br>  <br>Linebarrels was good.</br>  <br>I liked A/Z.</br>  <br><br>G-Reco was complete and utter shit.<br><br>Turn A was the last truly excellent gundam, unless you count build fighters (I don't, mainly because they're dumb, exciting fun and nothing more).</br></br></br></br>  <br>God, Doga Kobo just gets shit done. I really can't wait for them to do another mecha anime.</br>  I didn't have a problem with Aldnoah Zero and I loved the ending because it was (kind of) out of nowhere. And then they made season 2, and THAT is one of the worst mechas I've ever seen. The only one that comes to mind next to it is Gargantia and I haven't even finished it yet.<br><br><br>Evangelion 2.22</br></br></br>  <br>I think Hino is great for concepts, but after he makes the initial idea, lock him out of the writing room. <br><br>AGE infuriates me with how great it could have been. A generational Gundam could have been incredible. I thought the mechanical designs were pretty good too. AGE-3 is fucking sexy as all hell. But it all goes to shit in the most embarrassing way possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Orange did the CG in MJP, didn't they?</br>  <br> Evangelion 2.22 <br>It doesn't really hold up that good compared to the original TV series, though.</br></br>  <br>I think you meant "best mecha ever made". Either that or you've gone full retard.<br><br>I mean, <br><br>Aquarion<br>Valvrave<br>Nobunaga the Fool<br>Daimidaler<br><br>and those four are just the trainwrecks I've personally witnessed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is M3 good? I'm on episode 4 and so far I'm staying for the hilarious Okada quotes  <br>It doesn't hold up to fucking Bayformers, I don't know what Lelouch is on about.</br>  <br> Lelouch <br>That's Jebus, even he's less obnoxious than Lecunt.</br></br>  g reco's initial episodes were pretty terrible and then Sage died so I just dropped it.<br><br>Tomino shouldn't have embarrassed himself with that show. The only thing I really recall was he put a toilet in the giant robot, and also there was a brazilian space pope or something who controlled the space elevator, and the space pirates were actually the good guys trying to throw off the corrupt Federation government.</br></br>  <br>Oh, it appears they did.</br>  <br> best mecha ever made <br>You watched season 2, right?</br></br>  <br>I had far more fun with all four of them than A/Z.</br>  <br>Yes bd soon.</br>  <br><br> Eureka seveN <br> Edgy </br></br></br>  <br>Each of those four were much better than aldnoah zero.</br>  <br>Fucking this. It's the complete opposite of edgy if nothing else.</br>  <br>I said it tried to be edgy, which is definitely true. Halfway through the show was 100% NOT about surfing, but instead muh despair.<br><br>Ending saved it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At least Aldnoah had parts that had me interested. First episodes weren't terrible and the sort of 90's greenscreen mech design and Kubrick references were a nice touch.<br><br>VVV was just overall shit. It was "fun", but I don't see why Aldnoah wouldn't be "fun" in the exactly same way.<br><br>Neither are good but VVV is definitely worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Okay, now you're overdoing the hate. There is no way Space Vampires piloting robot mechas to fight over a space conspiracy was better than A/Z. The OP of Valvrave was awesome, but that was just about the only thing.</br></br></br>  <br> Vandread <br>I cant believe someone else knows it existed I loved that series<br><br>Athrun never cucked kira and put the blame for the destiny plan and the messiah on Shinn though</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't see why Aldnoah wouldn't be "fun" in the exactly same way. <br>Aldnoah was ugly. Really ugly. The CG was ugly and it didn't blend in well with the ugly backgrounds at all. On top of all this, there was almost no discernable "fun factor" usually present in mecha anime. It didn't have Patlabor's charm. It didn't have Ishikawa/Nagai's "fuck you I'm edgy and I'm proud!" It didn't even get Code Geass' bizarre polical conspiracy right.<br><br>Aldnoah.Zero has nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First two episodes of aldnoah shit was good becuase of the martians winning with their technology. After that the series just turn to complete shit with Inaho coming to the rescue every single time and making everyone around him look dumb. It was the same repetitive shit over and over again. <br>VVV wasn't that repetitive and the series had way more interesting character unlike aldnoah zero especially with the earth cast. Also characters actually died in valvrave while nobody died in aldnoah zero. Vlavrave had it's problems but it was a much better series than aldnoah zero.</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed the hell out of Valvrave. Aldnoah got dull around the time the Martian of the Week episodes began, and I never really got back into it. I repeatedly fell behind and had to force myself to catch up more than once.<br><br>So yes, I'd genuinely put Valvrave over A/Z. Both were poorly written, but at least Valvrave was fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Name one element of aldnoah zero besides the ost that was better than Valvrave. Characters?Plot? Development? Anything.</br>  <br>Come on the final ark isn't edgy the whole show was based on using old mecha homages<br>Arc 1 young boy goes on adventure<br>Arc 2 he realizes that people are dying/this is war<br>Arc 3 despair and suffering<br>Arc 4 overcome problems and unlock the mecha's final super modo so he can save the world<br><br>Eureka seven was just following standard procedure. I bet that 90% of mecha shows in this thread follow this procedure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aldnoah was ugly <br>You're right, but I don't think being ugly has nothing to do with being unfunny.<br><br>And no one was comparing it with Patlabor or anything "decent". It was being compared with VVV, which is on the same level of shitness.<br><br><br>I can't really see why anyone would claim this. Everything you stated about VVV was bad and at least as bad as Aldnoah. I also don't believe "characters dying" is any measurable factor of greatness.<br><br>Both Aldnoah and VVV were trainwrecks that were "fun". Aldnoah really dropped the ball with Inaho reaching Mahouka-Jesus levels and other shit, but at least it made an effort. There were parts that I didn't find completely terrible. First episodes were really not that bad and the ending of first season was so out there I really enjoyed it. VVV was just shit episode after episode. It didn't even try. Only scene I even found remotely "fun" was when the teacher become Moses and split the ocean of students. And that's a lot said, as I pretty much remember only a one unrelevant scene from entire series.<br><br>I'm not saying Aldnoah was good or that I'm a fanboy, but c'mon. At least it had decent ost and mech design was often spot on with the technology gap. Before it went full cyber-eye there were things I didn't find outright horrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Come on the final ark isn't edgy  <br>That's what I said, numbnuts<br><br>Also<br> conceptually deleting space itself, graphically destroying whatever was partially inside it <br> not edgy <br> giving hubby-chan a kissu so he can asplode <br> not edgy <br> beating children <br> not edgy <br> And don't give me that "Holland was just Brightslapping Renton!" garbage either </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>uhm, I think you're embellishing in your memory, but Valvrave had just about the most boring, clichéd cast ever. To wit, we had<br> hot-headed idiot MC (aka Suzaku without PTSD) <br> the Shirley <br> black-haired aloof bitch who tries desperately to be Kallen <br> idiot delinquent who totally steals the MCs hot-headed shtick <br> hikkikomori bitch <br> utterly forgettable douche-canoe <br> ERUERUFU (aka white-haired Lelouch, complete with his own over-idolized Nunnally) <br>aaand a bunch of utterly forgettable bad guys, except for that psycho kid voiced by Yuuki Kaji whom I still want to run through a meat grinder despite being voices by one of my favorite VAs and that "call me Moses" guy who I still periodically remember and chuckle at</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The model kit for the sleipnir is better than he valvraves<br><br>M3 was pretty good i'd give it an 8/10<br>It was a while since I had seen a yandere in mecha. Lastime I saw one was in Nadesico</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Pretty good <br>The show was really dumb and tried to achieve shock value by twists after twists. I now "edgy" is a buzzword but it's been a while since I watched anything with that dark palette about angsty teenagers. Antagonist had shittiest motive in a long time. 3D was ugly.<br><br>The sad thing is that in the first episodes it seemed like it really could go somewhere. But it never did. It was meaningless twist after meaningless twist with characters you really didn't care and couldn't connect with.<br><br>Only redeeming feature was that the first op was sort of catchy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Overall mech and environment design?</br>  <br> Rather, what's the BEST mecha from the last ten years? I don't watch mecha a lot but most of the modern mecha shows that I've seen are garbage, Frontier is the only one I really loved (and is not even completely mecha, it's more half mecha half idol anime). <br><br><br>Gundam 00 hands down</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because after all of that the cast for valvrave was still better than aldnoah zero.</br>  <br>The "deletion of space" its just a unique weapon the enimies have I mean they are aliens after all. I thought it was a nice change from lasers everywhere. The only other time I've seen it in use was in Fafner.<br><br>And c'mon hollands beatdowns on Renton were definitely throwbacks to brightslapping bones did break off from sunrise afterall. Another reason was the fact that he was jealous he won Eureka<br><br>Now as for the child abuse I won't lie it was somewhat edgy but used in moderation to darken the tone of the show frome time to time</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay anon you hate VVV and you think aldnoah was better but as I said before vvv had much better characters and the plots for both shows were about the same. Also people find vvv way more fun because it wasn't the same repetitive shit with the gary stu main character coming to the rescue in almost every episode. That shit started from episode three to the finale. Also there was absolute zero character developments among characters except for slain. Go back to valvrave and you will see that each of those characters had their moments and developments.</br>  So it's come down to this huh? It's not enough to argue about how my fav anime is better than your fav. We've now got to argue for why one shit series is a bigger piece of shit than the other one.<br><br><br>Let me tell you why that's bullshit. After the first few episodes, I came to V3 expecting some ridiculous shit out of it; the sort of campy stuff you might get in a B movie. I wasn't expecting high plot, just ridiculous characters like Elf doing ridiculous shit in the vein of 80s/90s action stars. I got what I went into for.<br><br>Now AZ on the other hand? War drama? Nope. Regular romance/drama? Nope. Cool mecha fights? Almost, but eventually nope. The central conflict about Earth vs Mars? Nope. Music aside, I got nothing out of AZ. AZ was just a series of build ups that mounted to nothing. Just promises, no punch line.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam SEED</br>  <br>You misspelled gunbuster anon</br>  <br>But you were still able to remember defining character traits for the valvrave cast. Could you do the same for a/z if asked?</br>  <br>KEK, sure Gundam Seed is not the best Gundam but call it as worst when we have show like A/Z is completely wrong</br>  <br>hm... lesse<br> borderline autism MC who's got great aim and enough knowledge of physics that he should already have a degree <br> the shirley <br> the Euphemia who (somehow) doesn't die <br> the second MC who has to endure just about everything awful until he's crazier than a sack full of weasels <br> Snazzbaum, the sleazy smug bad guy who still had a likable motive <br> the most boring Heroes' best friend <br> a bunch of bad guys most of whom are killed off before they could become interesting <br> a surprisingly interesting Euphemia/Nunally crossover <br><br>Frankly, I watched this show because of Inaho, Slaine, Snazzbaum, Lemrina and Asseylum (and the awesome awesome music). I didn't like all the story decisions, but I actually found the fights to be well animated and with great music, pretty much just like Guilty Crown, except with a slightly more agreeable ending and less shitty story decisions along the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam Seed Destiny is still better than A/Z tell me what Destiny did that is worse than A/Z</br>  <br>I'll give you the part about being repetitive, gary-stu rescue was overused. Other points not so much.<br><br>Plot for VVV was really shit. Aldnoah sort of stayed the same and was true to being shit, VVV tried to pile more and more shit to the pile until you really couldn't tell what sort of space-vampire-alien-conspiracy shit it was trying to be. And it really was one of those things that on paper sounds really fun, but it was never portrayed as ironic work and you couldn't even get chuckles out of vampire-rape as it was never played as comedy. Only thing that made the series "good" were the treads on /a/ and that really has nothing to do with the series itself.<br><br>As for the characters I feel the general problem was, which you pointed out, that they were never quite developed. There were some characters that could have been something if given spotlight, like ptsd-drunk or the martian girl, but never got anywhere. But hell, potential existed, whereas VVV cast was just very uninteresting. Only person that I ever felt could go somewhere was the eyepatch-antagonist as he was portrayed sort of mystically in the beginning, but the character development and spotlight that "every character got" turned out him being just some alien or something.<br><br><br>But I don't see that as a problem. Both works are bad, but at least you expected something from Aldnoah, which would mean that at some point, some time, you believed the series would have something. To me even that alone is a bigger merit than series being intentionally shit, and I don't know if VVV actually ever tried to be shit, as it never was quite the comedy /a/ made it to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Frankly, for a lot of the main cast I had to look at the TVTropes page. For A/Z, see<br> (though I still had to look up Lemrina's name)</br></br>  <br><br>Certain bits of the show (like when Renton went berserk at the mook and found out it is actually piloted when he sees the pilots remains) and the manga is pretty "edgy"</br></br>  <br> it will probably sell worse than even G-Reco <br>The last time i check the last volume of A/Z sells worse than even Cross Ange</br></br>  <br>I like it when Bones anime gets edgy. DtB and FMA did that really well, especially the latter; but I don't think E7 handled the edge nearly as well as either of those series. I think it would have been just as good if the violence weren't as overtly-graphic as it turned out being.</br>  <br>Now that I recall it did have that edgy factor to it. I never really noticed at the time but I still thought the ost was god and the animation was decent. While the cg was jarring at times I didn't find it too distracting. He story while it wasn't a masterpiece it was at least somehing mild and the two "twists" can be seen from a mile away if you've seen a couple of meha series</br>  <br>Valvrave still had the better cast anon. Inaho was a shitty gary stu with no character background. Nothing from his character. I can't beleive that you even liked asseylum. I honestly can't take you serious again after hearing that. <br>The only thing I'm getting from pro aldnoah anons are better music and mech designs which isn't saying much.</br></br>  <br> at least you expected something <br>No, I went into it by being cautious, expecting nothing in particular. I didn't expect much, maybe cool mecha fights at least.<br><br>It was in hindsight, i.e., after actually finishing it, that I can look at it and say that they wanted to achieve many things and did none. At all.<br><br> a bigger merit <br>No it isn't. It's the reverse. That is the absolute worst thing to do. It just made the whole thing a complete waste of time (barring the threads on /a/.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could've forgave Aldnoah Zero if had stopped at the end of the first season and the war continued in a whole new direction in the second with a new MC and cast.<br><br>Or at least Inaho and Princess got together for fucking sakes.</br></br></br>  <br> the two "twists" can be seen from a mile away if you've seen a couple of meha series <br>That's one element which made it sort of bad, it was very cliche but still tried to pull the twists with shock-value alone.<br><br>Not that anon but I can't defend any character from VVV either. There was some aliens and eruerufu did some plans no one understood. Problem in Aldnoah was that many characters were never really developed but even by existing they made the series far better than VVWild ride.<br><br>Aldnoah get's the "at least you tried" medal, while VVV is the strange guy who rolls around in puddle because he realizes he will never amount to anything. Trying is more positive than being just shit.<br><br>In the image you can see the moment where the main cast sort of realizes their own show is shit and stop trying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's say it this way:<br>After they tried to scare the viewers with Asseylum's death the fifth time, I started getting attached to her like "come on, you've bullshited us with this so many times, you're not actually gonna do it, right? Right?" and I sort of liked how ignorant of the world she was. After the series is over, the best I can say about her is how she took a huge stinking shit on convention and ended the whole clusterfuck in a political marriage, thereby ending a conflict surprisingly neatly and putting a giant gravestone on a thousand shipping debates.<br><br>My favorite character was still Snazzbaum and I'm still pissed at Slaine for murdering him, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> at some point, some time, you believed the series would have something. To me even that alone is a bigger merit <br>What kind of shitty logic is that? Having 'believe' in it is irrelevant to the show's actual quality. You're on fucking /a/, where people jump to conclusions about shows that haven't aired and we're neighbours with /m/, which is already shitting on the new Gundam show based on trailers and staff announced.</br></br>  <br>i was really mad that Chaika got a shitty budget in comparison. The characters and the fights there still ended up being enjoyable, but I know they could have done so much better.</br>  <br>If nothing else, it means the series had a beginning that left you wanting more.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5038527  <br> Aldnoah get's the "at least you tried" medal <br>Are you American? Because that medal is worth nothing.<br><br> he realizes he will never amount to anything.  <br>Yeah, nope. V3 had better mecha battles than AZ. Not mounting to anything describes AZ more than V3.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Princess <br> Wanting that Sora 2.0 piece of shit to be happy </br></br>  <br>/m/ has be pretty chill about g-tekketsu they loved the designs so far and like how it gives of an "after war gundam X" vibe. I'm pretty excited myself the director is at least competent enough to give us a 7/10 series at least</br>  <br>tengen toppa gurren lagann</br>  Evangelion, it's shit  <br> had a beginning that left you wanting more <br>So Valvrape then. A body jacking space vampire sounds way more promising than the plot of what sounds like another cheap attempt at imitating Gundam.</br></br>  Name a good mecha show in the last 30 years<br><br>Protip:  you can't  </br></br>  <br> Had better mecha battles <br>I don't remember any of them. They were in space at some point I guess. It was just unmemorable shit with ugly mech design. And what was the thing with harakiri-super attack? You couldn't come up with anything more ridiculous?<br><br>Really? I guess it's your opinion and all, but body-jacking vampires pretty much sums up what was wrong with the series. It's just stupid and tries to rake in the retardation-points.</br></br></br></br>  <br> by existing they made the series far better than VVWild ride <br>Just to make you think like that because the potential it promised but it never happened which is why it is bad writing</br></br>  <br> Lol it's now edgy to shit on what a lot consider the best ever <br>the post<br><br><br> I'm a newfag who still thinks mocking eva makes me look cool <br> I'm a newfag who hasn't realized that people only hate Shinji ironically now <br>the post<br><br><br> First episode ends with New Orleans nuked from orbit <br>Say against that show what you want, but THAT actually looked like it had potential<br><br>Though, to be fair, Valvrave's beginning also looked promising, until the writers forgot about the Vampire thing for six episodes and then thought, "shit, our characters have done fuck all vampity lately, so let's throw in some LEL EDGY RAPE SCENE"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam</br>  <br>But if you have a character you want to see developed and shone light into means you are interested in the said character. Which is automatically more than I can say about any of VVV characters.</br>  <br>Yeah I see what you mean there but I feel the reason most people bring that up is due to the shows artstyle. Eureka seven's genki yoshida designs do set you in that happy mood so when the darker parts of the show occur it can be unsettling (like the scene with renton going crazy with after killing those pilots)<br><br><br>Yeah I've been meaning to get to the manga. From what I heard it's the victory gundam of the eureka seven franchise</br></br></br></br>  <br>Came out 35 years ago</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128645315 <br>Yes?</br>  <br> But if you have a character you want to see developed and shone light into means you are interested in the said characters <br>It is everyshow ever</br></br>  <br> It's still not as bad as Gundam Seed Destiny though <br>Nah, GSD actually makes sense, everyone is that show is a fucking idiot. Nothing in A/Z makes sense hell not even the title makes sense since it was suppose to be about Slaine apparently reaching "zero"</br></br>  <br>Except Valvrave</br>  <br>So what does that make you think that better than VVV characters</br>  <br> I didn't have a problem with Aldnoah Zero and I loved the ending because it was (kind of) out of nowhere <br>Jesus fuck this shit taste</br></br>  I give VVV the credit it's due, at least it accomplished what it set out to do with revealing the truth of the world. A/Z had no point and felt like a huge waste of time.  <br>The franchise still continue and watching all of them are good</br>  At least VVV had god-tier cast and OPs unlike Aldnoahshit.    <br>You have to admit the decision to kill (even though the second season ruined that) seemed kinda ballsy. It really made the finale go from "meh" to interesting.</br>  <br>Not everything has to be musashi Gundoh to be shit. It was extremely uninspired fights for the robot CGI and the animation for characters was passable but nothing to write home about. Further, the direction of the animation is part of the animation and when you have scenes like anti-anti-tank missile loli jeep you can probably call it shit,</br>  <br>Valvrave is the easy answer, it is literally the physical incarnation of all hopelessness focused entirely on twists and shock value that becomes outdated after the firs viewing. It is a textbook example of everything that could go wrong without the concept being a factor and everything wrong with the mecha genre ever since Code Geass was successful in omni-pandering and Haruhi Suzumiya and K-ON sentenced the industry into the current fad of slice of life shows being the "in" hip thing.</br>  <br>Not really because it was fucking obvious that it was meant to grab idiots to watch the second season, anyone who was smart enough knew what they were doing.</br>  <br>actually I had a giant nerd-gasm when I saw Inaho stepping out of the car at the start of S2.</br>  <br><br><br>This is what happens when idiots watch G-Reco</br></br></br>  <br>VVV ended with witch mobs that killed thouusands and liberated no one.<br>Aldnoah was at least entertaining.</br></br>  <br>You are everything that's wrong with anime fandom</br>  <br>because the eye</br>  <br><br> This is why "Stick to A/Z faggot" became a thing in /m/ due to some of the people there got sick and tired of others begging to be spoonfed </br></br>  <br>but it wasn't the Code Geass I was craving for</br>  <br>The ending where the main girl gets taken over by the supercomputer and starts behaving like a slut goddess is pretty good. Sure the fight animation for the ending was pretty good, but it was a dull fight. All I cared about was how how hana was evil.<br><br>Delicious evil brown.</br></br></br>  <br>Worst piece of shit I have ever completed.<br>I felt like I wasted my time in nothing when I finished, all the characters were shit. <br>Marito did nothing.<br>The other 2 girls that I can't remeber what their names are were useless.<br>Slaine was a fucking retard.<br>Inaho was a damn robot.<br><br>I can't believe people liked this garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>VVV also didn't introduce a new character 2 episodes before its finale to tie up its loose ends. <br><br>The very existence of Crutons Jr. is easily the worse writing in any mecha this decade.</br></br></br>  How come everybody hates CGI?  <br>Well it worked. We got less people complaining about G-Reco</br>  <br>People who aren't idiots don't. It's badly done CGI that's hated on.<br><br>Akito OVA's CGI wasn't being hated on since it was actually done well.</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave is definitely worse.</br>  <br>Everybody hates CHEAP CGI. Looks fine when it has effort put into it.</br>  <br> now that I recall <br>Early on the mahvess seemed to be powered by the pain and suffering of angsty teens. I thought the edginess was pretty on-the-nose.<br><br>I think that the underlying concept of communication was pretty good. It certainly wasn't executed very well, and there were some plot points I wish they could have gone even edgier in (MC with his brothers fiancee sexual tension?)<br>maybe 6/10 (slightly better than average) but could have been better if it was just presented in a more exciting and less trite manner.</br></br></br></br></br>  Valvrave is legitimately the single worst mecha anime ever and that is in no way a meme and an exaggeration.  <br>Because it generally looks bad? Especially among mecha fans because, as on of anime's oldest genres, it had it's golden age in a time when CGI didn't exist..<br><br>Full CGI like sidonia S1 looks okay, MJP is probably the best example in recent mecha to pull it off well. AZ's bad CGI is just another tick mark on its long list of faults.</br></br></br>  <br> MJP is probably the best example in recent mecha to pull it off well <br>Fafner EXODUS's CGI has also been fantastic so far.</br></br>    AZ threads were filled with fujoshits from tumblr. Therefore it's the worst.  <br>I liked the progression of the second season a lot more. Sure, it was shit, but with all of the new orbital knights and the ocassional slaine HAPPENING moment, it was a lot more entertaining than most of the first season. If they had actually pulled something closer to code geass, I'm sure most of us would feel it was more entertaining, but certain things really brought it eg princess drama.<br><br><br>Haruto acting violent was foreshadowed for a few episodes in advance. No one was surprised that he might attack someone during airing. What was surprising was the accompanying rape.</br></br></br></br>   A/Z <br> Valvrave <br> G-Reco <br>Mecha is pretty much dead, Fafner is just desperate life support</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's vvv that is the worst. In comparison to A/Z it has worse cast, worse characters, worse plot, worse writing, worse action, worse cgi, worse music, and overall unenjoyable unlike A/Z which was moderately enjoyable.</br>  <br>Valvrave is the worst. <br>Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it's trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn't. It's not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out.</br></br>  <br>GOING GOING HIKARI E</br>  <br> Haruto acting violent was foreshadowed for a few episodes in advance. No one was surprised that he might attack someone during airing. What was surprising was the accompanying rape. <br>At episode 2, tgat is not foreshadowing. Then nothing with the vampires is done, so yes they did forget it, then suddenly rape.</br></br>  <br> one tries to be serious but fails <br> ultimately insults your intelligence by putting up pretenses of intelligence (rayleigh scattering etc.) <br> one tries to be goofy with silly plot twists <br> on-the-nose writing, but you know what you're getting into <br><br>I don't know how you can argue on those grounds. Valvrave failed in a lot of ways, but it managed to entertain in the ways it wanted to. Yes it is stupid, but its hard to argue that a show that was trying to be intelligent and ended up being just as dumb is somehow superior. Maybe less disingenuous, but that's like arguing a statement made ironically is equally uninformed as the same statement made in earnest.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  At least the first cour of VVV was fun to watch. A/Z was just awful. It's like the writers improvise all the time. At the end of A/Z's first cour they make think there's something between Inaho and the princess, but then they only have scene together in the second cour and he possessed by his bionic eye. I don't know why they even bothered.  <br>Valvrave is the worst when all is said and done. Valvrave is a complete failure, a failure to provide good characters, memorable scenes, or even to entertain. Why does Valvrave fail at being dumb fun? And why should you not watch Valvrave as opposed to an anime very much like it, or an anime whose sole purpose is to provide easy brain candy. After looking at the lack-luster characters, the stupid plot-twists and all that other wonderful bullshit. For all its eccentricities, Valvrave is a show that's missing a lot of soul. When you watch a show that tries to achieve that same feeling that Valvrave attempts, I at least feel, it's a show born because the creators wanted the audience to have a little fun. Valvrave feels like it's engineered for the sole purpose of keeping the audience around long enough so they feel obligated to buy merchandise, and all the craziness that it contains: those stupid plot-twists and ludicrous situations, are born from that. And yes, you could argue that's the purpose of every anime that's ever existed, but still, you're not supposed to be so obvious about it. Valvrave is an empty fireworks show; an hollow mess that's devoid of passion, creativity and soul, that feels like its very blue-prints was built to pander to the biggest demographic possible. Valvrave is the worst mecha-anime. Not self-aware. Not "so-bad-it's-good". Not clever in any way. It's the inevitable result of putting together as many typical tropes of the mecha genre as possible, mashing them together, and hoping that it will be eaten up by the masses. So yes, just... plain... bad.</br>  <br>Bodyswap hijinx? I'm pretty sure that occurred before the rape. And though it's been a while, I recall haruto lashing out in the episode previous.</br>  <br>No you are rememberingwrong Aldnoah was fun and vvv was just shit.</br>  <br>in stillframes, sidonia-type cgi looks okay<br><br>during any movement whatsoever, it's fucking shit-tier eye cancer of the worst goddamned kind<br><br>who the actual fuck thought it was okay to render that shit at 12 fucking frames per goddamned fucking second?<br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the other way around. <br>VAMPIRES IN SPACE &gt; Autistic kiddo defeating every enemy without breaking a sweat</br></br>  <br> Bodyswap hijinx? <br>Never actually happened. People wanted to see them but there were none.</br></br>  <br>is this pasta? I agree valvrave was meh and stopped watching it after like 4 episodes, but holy shit that wall.</br>  <br>Except both of them wanted to be serious and be taken seriously. It's just that Aldnoah actually tried while vvv did not.</br>  <br>g-reco was fucking awful<br><br>schizophrenic pacing, endless numbers of one-dimensional characters (often introduced and then discarded one or two episodes apart), a confusing (admittedly less so after additional research after the show finished airing) story that couldn't decide what it wanted to do, and varying animation quality does not a good or even acceptable anime make<br><br>much less one falling under the gundam banner<br><br>it was a fucking catastrophe, and you know it<br><br>the ONLY acceptable parts of it were the good fight sequences</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really arguing that A/Z was any better? Obvious female gaze pandering, lazy writing, lazy setpieces, the bare minimum effort to make the MC look OH-SO-COOL compared to other characters, and just as many idiotic plot twists as valvrave also designed to simply rope in the audience each week.<br><br>When you consider that valvrave was SUNRISE and like gundam EXISTS TO SELL MERCH (no one has any illusions about gundam so why have 'em about valvrave) it's hard to feel betrayed. A/Z may have started with a soul, but the writers just started doing things near the end because whatever. It's just as messy and nonsensical.</br></br></br>  <br>So autistic retard losing with a giant robot and needed a white haired Russian gary stu, who can't pilot, save him is more entertaining than a standard robot fight with interesting tactics?</br>  Aldnoah failed because they did everything they can to not be Gundam. It needed to be Gundam Seed for it to even click locally. They avoid that and then it flopped. Had Aldnoah done a more grounded approach to SEED's storyline, it would've actually taken off as a franchise  <br> what's the worst mecha ever made and why is it it aldnoah.zero? <br> what is NGE </br></br>  <br><br>It is actually, and it is basically spammed by the same autist in /m/ (with different variants) because VVV raped him or something</br></br>  <br>No, I sat through the drek that is Valvrave and at no point found anything worthwhile or of value in it.</br>  Oh, I see G-Reco's finally getting mentioned as well. Time to bring in Cross Ange so we can get the full party going.<br><br> lesbians, lesbian rape, mind rape and tons of women and children getting killed is fine <br> nipples is still no no even in BDs. <br>CA is indeed the worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br> A/Z <br> Valvrave <br> G-Reco <br>One of the these things is not like the other<br><br>One of these things just doesn't belong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why you bother responding, when all you'll get is some "you didn't like if because you're an idiot who didn't understand it" strawman.</br>  <br>Infinite Stratos 2 counts as a mecha show, right?</br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>Best example of them trying to not be SEED is personified with Asseylum. They tried hard to not draw the obvious comparison to Lacus Clyne or heck, even Releena Darlian, as a result, her characterization suffered immensely</br>   VVV  <br>So bad it was fun to watch<br> Aldnoah <br>The same but you knew there was good intent but it was completely mishandled<br> Reco G <br>Just completely bland so it became uninteresting I couldn't tell if it was good or bad<br> CA <br>Just stupid fun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> VVV  <br> So bad it was fun to watch <br>Sorry meant to say so bad that it's bad and not fun at all.</br></br></br>  1. Code Geass<br>2. Full metal panic<br>3. Dunno haven't watched any other mecha anime</br></br>  <br>what is entertaining of standard robot fight with tactics from gary tsu MC? are you 12 years old?</br>  <br>No it's an accurate analysis of why vvv is so awful.</br>    <br>More entertaining than a robot overheating and freezing up every five minutes.</br>  <br> of course asspull is more interesting </br>  <br>Asspulls is literally all vvv is.</br>  <br>First season is pretty good if that helps</br>  <br>Gundress. Hands down.</br>  <br>Probably the faggot reviewer who is getting his opinion from /a/ and sharing it on youtueb</br>  <br> implying all of A/Z is not asspull more </br>  Whats wrong with AGE? I know its not great but I cant quite put my finger on where it sucks  <br>It isn't. If you think tgat then you obviously didn't watch it.</br>  <br>best post in the thread<br>not to mention that some of the best mecha designs is in 00, audio/ music is god tier too(duh), Kawaii is just GOAT)</br></br>  <br>this Exodus had godly cgi. you can always count on xebec to do good cgi I would even go as far as to say I prefer it to he originals animation</br>  <br>The MC itself is an asspull, how can you still defend that?</br>  <br> Evangelion <br> Mecha <br>Pick one, shitlord.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off /m/oron</br>  <br>if those are your complaints you haven't watched enough mecha. In the mecha genre rape and child abuse of all kind go hand in hand</br>  <br>So is Sue-Elf from vvv and that shit also comes with the most inconpetent useless Shinji ripoff that is even worse. How can you defend that?</br>  <br>NGE isn't about the mecha. It's about the characters, m8.</br>  <br>Not my fault you suck at reading comprehension.</br>  <br> implying a/z wasn't an asspull <br> inaho didn't get shot in the head it was his eye and now we have technology to give him a new eye that will cause him to surpass kira yamato but it's only for inaho and NO other soldier would get this upgrade even though a squad of them would win the war. BUT WAIT if he uses it too long he'll die. <br> lol jk we took it out of him </br></br></br>  <br>people didn't like the final arc because it became seed/destiny again where the mc was too afraid to pull the trigger and just became a mecha butcher</br>  <br>Gunbuster<br>Diebuster<br>Evangelion<br>TTGL<br>Mostly Gainax stuff. There's probably something else I'm forgetting that isn't Gainax.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The inconpetent was helped by the competent one who was trained child soldiers for 8 years, that's make sense</br>  <br>wb NGE</br>  <br>And they were still more boring and infuriating than Inaho who was at least entertaining.</br>  <br>It liberated the world from the Magius and accomplished the goal of exposing the truth. Honestly A/Z bored me, the fights were too predictable. If the mecha action isn't fun then I'm out.</br>  <br>The sad part is it didn't have to be that way, they could have easily introduced him earlier and not made him feel like an afterthought. It really feels like he was thought up last minute because they didn't have the guts to follow through on anything. Really the show should have just been 12 episodes, the "plot" didn't warrant 24.</br>  Well, since we seem to be /m/ today: What did y'all think of Linebarrels of Iron and/or Overman King Gainer? Based on the overviews, they look to be at least fun.  <br>You're trolling right?</br>  <br>Well there's also Mari Okada's Aquarion Evol, M3 and the new Gundam she's going to ruin with her shit writing as well.</br>  <br>It didn't liberate people. It took away freedom and turned into a red scare situation with witch mobs and people selling each other out.</br>  <br>I know right, what a great ending.</br>  <br>You didn't like EVOL's deep symbolism?</br>  <br> MC literally IM SO COOL bait with asspull <br> It is more entertaining <br>You just prove you are 12 years old</br></br></br>   defending aldnoah unironically itt <br>ay</br>  <br>I don't speak the language of the cur. It all sounds like barks to me.</br>  VVV first season was only fun if you were in the threads when it was airing and the second season is legitimately the worst mecha related thing possible, especially the ending.  <br>L-Elf was overpowered but he wasn't a one noted Mary Sue. Cain beat his ass in first season and he failed to protect the one he wanted to protect, also he lost his best friend and had an actual emotional range unlike Inaho who was a boring flat character without a personality who was a plot device without carrying the show.<br><br>Unlike Inaho, L-Elf wasn't well liked or accepted by the Module until he proved himself. Inaho never fucking struggled for anything.</br></br></br>  <br> Inaho who was at least entertaining <br><br>Inaho's so irrelevant in his own show that Aniplex shuns him in Wonfes.</br></br></br>  <br> boring flat character without a personality who was a plot device without carrying the show <br>You literally just described L-Elf. <br><br>And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that cannon probably raised the price by 2000 yen</br>  <br>The first season was the same boring shit as the second one. There is no difference between them quality wise. They are both the worst.</br>  <br>In the end she really didn't have much characterization to speak of, she was very much a parrot spouting things others had said. They really had no idea of what to do with her, so they put her in a coma for a good chunk of the show.</br>  <br>Slaine's getting another figure too, I find it ridiculous how Inaho has been ignored. They're not even hiding their favoritism now.</br>  <br> another <br>That's the same one that was announced before, the only difference is that it's colored. Inaho is getting one of that maker too.</br></br>  <br> And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season. <br><br>No, he didn't. He was a monotonous plot device now with forced homolust in second season.<br><br>L-Elf carried VVV easily. He struggled, committed mistakes and got an actual character arc.<br><br>Inaho's entire arc was dropped so he could become Slaine's therapist. He was such a shitty character nobody cared about him besides what he would do for Slaine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season. <br><br>His eye? That amounted to nothing and was handwaved? They made it sound like it was too late and that it would kill him, turns out he could remove it and suffered no repercussions.</br></br></br>  <br>This is bad. Why couldn't Aniplex add an Inaho little stick too? It seems mean spirited.</br>  <br> L-Elf carried VVV easily. He struggled, committed mistakes and got an actual character arc. </br>  <br>How is that wrong you retard, did you even watch the show?</br>  <br>I think so too. Adding something that tiny and ridiculous to one but not the other makes it look like they only want to troll whoever buys the other one. Not that I care since I won't buy either but it's kind of a dick move since they'll probably cost the same. Actually I bet Sleipnir will be even more expensive.</br>  <br>Hey newfag, that guy is a regular troll in every mecha thread. He greenquotes you with an epic maymay picture to start shit and then watches quietly as you all fall for his bait and reply to each other thinking it's him. Ignore his posts and lurk the fuck more.</br>  <br>They seem to love to ignore him, I think they viewed Sleipnir as the face of the show more than they ever did Inaho. He never even got a solo spread, it's pathetic.</br>  <br>Really, who wouldn't want a teeny tiny Inaho to go along with Sleipnir? Unless they fucked up and Sleipnir isn't to scale with Tharsis.</br>  <br>Yes I did and he is easily the secobd worst character in the show. His plan always work, he takes on giant robots without one of his own and wins, has no trouble durung the show at all, as lways gets what he wants.</br>  <br>It is. You can see it in here  that's the correct scale, Tharsis is 17m and Sleipnir is 13,5m. I'm thinking they might add it later since Tharsis didn't come with that tiny Slaine initially, but if they don't, then that's a dick move. I wouldn't be surprised after what happened with the magazine spreads, though. They were never discreet about their bias.</br>  <br>How they've treated Inaho just feels weird, I know Aniplex only cares about money but usually it's not this obvious.</br>  <br>I'll never understand why they keep pushing Inaho as a main character in interviews and focus so much on UFE and Inaho and then pretend he doesn't exist outside of that. Maybe they're just that bad reading their audience. For example when Inaho got shot in S1 they were legit surprised at how many fans were worried about him and how little cared about Hime dying again. It looks like they underestimated their own character and thought no one would care about Inaho because Slaine was in the show. Incidentally they overestimated Hime and don't know how to deal with the hate she got so they ignore or avoid any questions about her that are politically incorrect. This is amazing in it's own way, they're clinically delusional.</br>  <br><br>Aniplex is no stranger to hyping shit up but that series took the cake.</br></br>  <br><br> Hurr hurr hurr I'm a retard on /a/. I'm going to "implying" that you said something stupid but I'm not going to take it any further than that because I'm a retard on /a/. <br><br>Seriously why do people do this shit, like you literally aren't even saying anything, you've done absolutely nothing to counter his point whatsoever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a retard from /m/ actually.</br>  <br><br>It really does feel like he practically Alan Smitheed himself off of the project. I haven't seen him mention it once on twitter and he actually seemed to get agitated when people brought it up to him at a con as if it was supposed to be on the screened questions list but it managed to get by and he was forced to talk about it. He even still mentions and talks about Gargantia on occassion and he wrote even less scripts for that one.</br></br>  <br><br>It's in the latest SRW game so obviously not. Honestly the show was alright up until the last quarter or so where the 3rd generation MC and antagonists motivations and actions stopped really making any sort of logical sense even within the context of the course of events.</br></br>  <br><br>It seemed like they basically just copied ideas from the latest Gundam series that were coming out at the time like AGE and Unicorn. They really seemed to specifically want it to be their own version of Unicorn with the disc and merchandise sales to go with it. They even got the same composer to try to do the music even if he captured none of what made his work on Unicorn so strong.<br><br>The thing with Unicorn is though that it's capitalizing on over 3 decades worth of continuity, themes and canon within a franchise while Aldnoah was supposed to be a starter series, yet they seemed to have the expectation that if they got that specific assortment of people that it'd all work out.</br></br></br></br>  I'm not reading through all this shit thread but, OP, you honestly haven't seen true garbage bin mecha if you think Aldnoah Zero is that bad. <br><br>az was, if nothing else, a huge pit of wasted potential because the basic premise is promising (although the actual worldbuilding itself turned out to be flimsy at best). In that sense, it might be the most disappointing mecha anime I've seen in a long while (although between GBF Try and G. Reco being from a similar timeframe, it's a pretty damn well contested spot). <br><br>I thought americans might be familiar with something on the level of Candidate for Goddess's shittitude, since it aired on adult swim back during its initial run. Or maybe M3, because it's contemporary? You know, actual absolute trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly UC Gundam is pretty great in general as are most Gundam series as long as you are not a complete cynical contrarian asshole. I'd personally avoid Seed Destiny and AGE though, the former for not really capturing what it is that makes most Gundam series great and enjoyable and the latter for really just not being able to capitalize on it's ideas and really just kind of insulting the intelligence of the viewer in it's last act especially.</br></br>  <br><br>He managed to make penance to Bandai at least by making Yokai Watch.</br></br>  <br>If eva is mecha then so is SnK</br>  <br>Fan-art by the way.<br>Eva's have a mouth.</br></br>  <br><br>That's what a lot of his fanboys claimed so that they could keep it in their heads that he's utterly infallible, but the reality is that even Urobuchi admits that he wrote a template for them that they sort of kind of followed albeit with tweaks of their own. The guys credited as original creator for crying out loud, I don't know how much higher up the echelon of a franchises order of prestige and authority you get than that. Yeah he didn't create, write scripts and lyrics for, direct and storyboard it like Tomino did Mobile Suit Gundam, but still that original creator credit isn't just there for show.</br></br>  <br>Better?</br>  Evangelion is the biggest piece of shit i've seen and without a duoubt, the worst mecha anime that ever existed.  <br><br>That's cause they tried to make the show all "grit and serious" like in the producers own words Man of Steel.</br></br>  <br><br>Symphogear and Kamen Rider are /m/.<br><br>Your argument is collapsing here just as bad as it does on /m/.<br><br>You don't have to wonder why he's shitposting about &gt;/m/ on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>L-Elf had a personality, though. It's just that both he and Eggs were Gary Stus.</br>    <br>not that guy but those count as power armor</br>  <br> what is an AT field </br>  <br> L-Elf had a personality <br>Epic meme!</br></br>  <br> I'm not reading through all this shit thread but, OP, you honestly haven't seen true garbage bin mecha if you think Aldnoah Zero is that bad. <br>That is true. Valvrave is the worst.</br></br>  <br>SnK is /m/, we just don't talk about it because we don't like it. Just like Doctor Who.</br>  <br>Slainefags love making up meta fanfics.</br>    <br>Cross Ange, VVV, and maybe Guilty Crown (if we even want to count it as mech) were all worse.</br>  <br>They did a very good job marketing it, if only they put that much effort into the actual show.</br>  <br> has no trouble durung the show at all <br>Cain beats him and half of the Module is gassed.<br>He fails to save Lieselotte. He broke down and most of the Module was killed.<br>He finally manages to beat Cain but Haruto dies just after he became friends with him.<br><br>You don't have to even like VVV but L-Elf was okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tharsis didn't come with a tiny Slaine, but they did a Count Slaine fig to showcase last Wonfes too (Aniplex made). It wasn't on scale as this. I don't think it's trolling but mostly that they know Slaine gives them money.</br>  <br>What focus? All Inaho amounted as "save muh Slaine" in the end.</br>  aldnoah zero is as much mecha as code geass, having mechas does not make a show mecha  <br>L-Elf wasn't a Gary Stu. He was overpowered, but to be one he had to be flawless and well loved and praised and L-Elf was neither of this. He was also held back by not piloting or having super powers.<br><br>He was competent because he was a child soldier raised by an ancient fascist alien.</br></br></br>  <br>Having mecha does in fact make a show mecha, and aldnoah zero had less mecha than code geass.<br><br>In case you haven't noticed, Code Geass follows the gundam formula and is very mecha.</br></br></br>  <br>valvrave, that shit was straight up the worst show I've ever seen. not even gonna post pic cause I don't want to save it to my computer.</br>  Neon Genesis Evangelion  <br> not liking melodramatic Mazinger Z </br>  <br>Because eggs</br>  <br>Both Aquarions are good, but Nobu and Daimidaler are both worse than Aldnoah.<br><br>Valvrave is WAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY worse than Aldnoah.</br></br></br>  Eva is garbage  <br><br>Am I the only one who noticed this?</br></br>  <br>good? what good about that, the retarded MC? the retarded mecha pilots? retarded earth forces logistics? or the fucking white base that they find for i don't know, plot convenience</br>  <br>The more I look at that picture the more angrier I get</br>  <br>My ebony skinned long lost brother!</br>   everyone has forgotten buddy complex <br>Next someone will claim it was actually good when the only entertainment came from how hilariously stupid the characters were.</br>  <br> a forgettable series is being forgotten <br>No way.</br></br>  <br>VVV is better than Aldnoah. Are you high? Aldnoah was hyped and overhyped as a good show and was shitty. VVV was always trainwrecky and never took itself seriously.</br>  <br><br>Good job trip-kun.</br></br>  <br>FUCK. I want the Tharsis. It looks so good painted.</br>  Guys, stop replying <br>He's an autist from various forums trying to shit up /a/ and /m/<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Nothing is better than Valvrave.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>NOTHING.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can't decide which is worse, A/Z or G-Reco apologists.
