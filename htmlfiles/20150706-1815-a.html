Tamamo will always win  <br>You solved the puzzle. Nasu doesn't really give a shit about the remake, he just wants to get it over with so he can get back to what he really cares about.</br>  <br>Oh, please. If that were the case, it wouldn't need all these redesigns and new routes.</br>  <br>I'm a huge Arc fan and I'm ok with Arc's redesign. She looks so slim without her long skirt, and she has a cuter air to her, if possible.</br>  What went  right?   <br>improved 1000%</br>  <br>Who's this girl? She's very cute.</br>  <br>Lurk the fuck more.</br>  <br>I've gotten past Arc's redesign. I've come to terms with Ciel's redesign. I even like Akiha's redesign.<br><br>But the one thing I will not forgive are Shiki's stupid fucking glasses.</br></br></br>   I like the new Arc better   That outfit is fucking awful.  <br>Arcueid Brunestud from Tsukihmie</br>  <br>It would if he wanted to shatter the dreams of Tsukihime fans and make it so that they never want him to do something like this again.</br>  <br> miniskirt <br>why</br></br>  <br>Arcade Bumstead.</br>  <br>why would a 1000 year old combat-specialized vampire lord wear a miniskirt? It makes no sense.</br>  <br>Because it's sexier than the old granny skirt she had.</br>  <br>I don´t see the problem</br>  <br>It makes more sense than King Arthur wearing full plate armor. Why does it need to make sense?</br>  <br>I want to  marry  Arcueid !</br>  <br>Easier movility. Now Arc can effectively kick her enemies without worrying about her long skirt getting in the way.</br>  <br>It makes perfect sense. She is a woman and all women want to look cute.</br>  don't be blinded by those rose tinted glasses  How are they going to sabotage it? By making it good?  It's okay because Hisui is cute.  Identify this character  <br>Ciel  with shitty hair. </br>  Looking good  I like the new characters but I'd rather see them work on the actual Tsukihime remake instead of this original shit.  <br><br>I actually prefer this hair for her even i its a clichee "girl with glasses" hair.<br><br>But it makes my dick diamonds. But I know well never get official h-scenes anymore. And then I get sad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Complaining about an outfit not making sense <br> In a fictional work <br><br>Jesus this is top tier autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is looking less like a cunt than she did in the original. Hopefully her personality also gets changed into something tolerable.</br>  <br>cutting rapeslut</br>  <br>Ciel<br>Elesia<br>7th of the Burial Agency</br></br></br>  <br>The bearer of my children.</br>  <br>Ciel was based in MB</br>  <br> they changed it therefore it sucks <br>There is literally no point to a remake if they're just gonna do the exact same thing all over again.<br><br>If it bothers you, just play the original again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What?<br><br>Ciel was Bro Tier. That was the problem. She was more of a Bro than a Waifu. Unlike the other ones who acted like a cunt except for Hisui.</br></br></br>  <br>So bro, she didn't have sex with Shiki when she really wanted to have sex with Shiki to save Arcueid.</br>  <br> trying to turn Arcueid into a Tohsaka Rhino </br>  <br> implying this design isn't better than the original <br>You're a fucking homosexual.</br></br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with being homosexual.</br>  <br>Now that I'm finally seeing Arc's new design in something other than standard turnaround poses, I'm actually okay with it. Only took 5 goddamn years.<br><br>Still wish the skirt was another inch or two longer, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Ciel with  _cute_  hair</br>    <br>I couldn't even figure out what my issue with her new design was until someone pointed out she doesn't have the gap in her bangs anymore a few weeks ago.</br>  Are they going to change the dress too?  <br>I just want them to change that blue portion to gold or white.</br>  <br>I hope it's a miniskirt dress.</br>  Now that I look at it, Arcueid's bed is full of mysteries.  <br>Hnggh she's far better.</br>  It's almost like they want the remake to succeed instead of being stuck in the minds of nostalgia fags who aren't going to buy it anyways.  <br>I smell the memes.</br>  Notes anime WHEN???    <br>new Arc looks good, but that dude over there is literally, LITERALLY Shirou with dumb looking glasses.</br>  Anyone who bought the Type-Moon ace know how the fuck you open that CD thing that came inside?  I love Tsukihime and it looks great. Can't wait.  How much rape will the adaption be lacking?  <br>Her split bangs were her most defining facial feature. It's fine to pretty her up a bit and give her longer hair and cuter glasses but Takeuchi should've kept her split bangs at least.</br>  <br>All except the Kohaku past one.</br>  <br>Woah there Shirou, lose the glasses and tell Saber to use her normal clothes.</br>  <br>Why do people keep bitching about the redesigns? I think she looks great in that miniskirt, it brings out her playful side more.</br>  <br>What if they change color? Like blue-black or gold-white dress?</br>  <br>These are the same people who think Tsukihime has an intriguing story. It's a mistake to think there is any sense in their opinion.</br>  <br>I don't dislike the design, I just honestly think she looks a lot cuter in her long purple skirt. I'm not gonna say they did something wrong with the redesigns but I do wish that they had stayed closer to the originals. MB Arcueid was cute as fuck.</br>  <br>After the DDD anime.</br>  <br>scissors</br>  <br>Why not? They already changed it once. Few people remember that her dress was completely different originally.</br>  <br> Miracle of the multiverse. </br>  <br>Longskirts and baggy sweaters were moe when tsukihime came out. Just look back on shit like Love Hina.<br>Now miniskirts and tight sweaters are all the rage.<br>Only oldfags who cant move on prefer the longskirt design.</br></br></br>  <br>I present: terrible MSpaint Ciel fix</br>  <br>Was it really? I had no idea. I guess everyone's getting a redesign!</br>  <br>Yeah. In Tsukihime, there's a flashback to Roa's memories of the first time he saw Arcueid. Her dress used to be mostly blue and frilly. Didn't look very regal.</br>  <br/>      <br>The dress is already "modern" enough.</br>  SHORTIEEEEEEEEEEEEEES GET THE FUCK OFF MY ARC  <br> eyes not teal color <br>Takeuchi is a fag</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty nice.</br></br>   moe Arc <br>Yes, I'm sure their ploy will fail miserably.</br>  <br>that's been established for well over a decade</br>  <br>M-maybe she will actually look like Ciel when she's not posing as a school girl, y-yeah?</br>  <br>Reminds me to the scene in Satsujin Kousatsu part 1 (KnK 2) where Shiki passed Mikiya.<br>Is that a parallel?</br></br>  <br>Ufotable do that a lot</br>  <br>Good CD<br><br>Medea summons Nero, Rin summons Passionlip, Rani summons Archer. Shit goes wrong, it was worth listening to in various ways.<br><br>Nero and Medea get along pretty well, Rin can't deal with this and keeps calling Passionlip Sakura when she tries to introduce herself, Rani forces Archer out of his underwear, Passion gets stabbed in the chest with Rule Breaker as Nero and Medea were fighting over it. Usually anything that falls in her chest becomes trash data as it gets destroyed entirely, but apparently Rule Breaker created a bad reaction as I guess all of her junk data she was collecting comes flying out and they're all buried.<br><br>Archer realizes he can just use Rule Breaker on himself rather than going around naked, so he breaks his contract or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just give it up and hope that the villains are untouched<br>The only change that nobody would be mad at is a drastic change to SHIKI is because nobody gives a fuck about him  except me </br></br>  <br>The guy is asking how you get the CD assuming be bought it. I don't think he was asking for spoilers.</br>  <br>Call it a bonus then<br><br>I'm providing services as a reasonable price.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope for a better Nero arc.</br>  How much of the Tsukihime lore and world will they acknowledge in the remake?  <br>How else are you suppose to self-insert?</br>  <br>The original makes her looks like an unpopular nerd girl, though, when she's supposed to be a beautiful, intelligent, and pretty famous girl of the school.</br>  We're up to chapter "Who even knows at this point" in regards to All Around Type Moon.<br><br>I know its past chapter 50 at least<br><br>Its only by chance that we had a chapter scanned in recently since people were so hot to get to that Tsukihime news.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's there to aknowledge? Other works has already done that.</br>  <br>We're aware. It got translated on Beast's Lair, someone just needs to insert it into the pages.</br>  <br>What, you want more wank about 'wow this shouldn't be possible it's a dead apostle ancestor who is so beyond human and yadda yadda i'm going insane with my urge to kill inhuman shit yadda yadda'? You want seafood to be part of Nero's attack line-up to extend the word count by a few thousand?</br>  <br>Blue-black could work depending on the darkness of the shade of blue but gold-white would be a little too much gold. The more her hair and eye color pops the better.</br>  So why is the iconic, purple skirt removed again?  <br>It's back.</br>  <br>I blame Saber.</br>  <br>Koyama said it was Takeuchi's idea.</br>  <br>According to Takeuchi, the skirt was shortened to better fit the change of setting from suburban anywhere to urban Tokyo.</br>  <br>Because the setting has changed from small city to big city, in a certain way that they had to change it up.<br><br>Entire game location has changed, certain pieces are altered.</br></br></br>  <br> Villains go untouched <br>The  final battle  feels repetitive without CGs since the villain is the same again and again, and the result is the same. Even the battle with  NRVNQSR  have more tension than the  final battle <br><br> I'm the only one who care about Capslock-kun <br> Not wanting he got more intimidating appearance <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;113689659 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;118505675 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Saber it is.</br>  <br> All the Lancers and Bazett <br>Damn, I'm curious.</br></br>  <br><br>I must be the only person who likes all the redesigns. I mean fuck, I couldn't stand Ciel's design in the original game and her design in the remake is actually kind of cute.</br></br>  <br>Takeuchi wants to decrease the amount of his long skirt fetish.</br>  <br>curry</br>  <br>I don't expect him to be intimidating. He's a guy who is insane because of his demon blood being driven more insane by the lingering insanity of an obsessed weirdo, who spends all his time locked up in a basement drugged out of his mind who gets raped on a daily basis. It's like a rabid, sickly dog with its ribs sticking out</br>  I hope we finally get to see what Brunestud and Arc's sister look like.  <br>It's not repetitive, it's just an all out let down and awful.<br><br>Roa the centuries old vampire who just beat Arc basically gives up, recoils in fear, runs away because a teenager said a few sentences to him. Was cowering, the teenager killed the hallway and it fell on Roa, he was crushed and basically died there, then the kid ran up and stabbed him.<br><br>Roa is the greatest failure in all of TM, at least Nero wasn't that much of a puss. Even SHIKI showed more guts, tactics, and ability that that bitch there.<br><br>Roa was the lamest guy there, he was basically all out beaten by a hallway after turning tail and cowering, after that much build up.<br><br>Could be the worst fight in TM, but at least the manga tried to spice it up a bit. Ancient vampire was mindfucked because a teenager said a few things that the ancient vampire wouldn't understand anyway without true context, or understanding in a certain way.<br><br>Roa had the Eyes of Life, he had no issues with them or fears, because they're far far less tension than the Eyes of Death. From Roa's perspective, another set of eyes like his shouldn't be such a big deal, because he shouldn't naturally understand the fear they represent even if Shiki says two sentences.<br><br>Fights in Tsukihime<br><br>Nero = Akiha &gt; Sacchin(Akiha route) &gt; Arcuied &gt; Ciel &gt; SHIKI &gt;&gt; Roa</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who cut off Arcueid's hair again?  <br>Her sister.</br>  <br>Altrouge.</br>  <br>Why is she such a bitch to her automaton of a sister?</br>  <br><br>In the manga he ran away because Shiki was killing his fucking magic.</br></br>  <br>Atari Dumbledore</br>  <br>Roa can kill only dudes with his eyes<br>Shiki can kill damn near anything except a concept or high level magical oogly boogly stuff<br>Roa is insane from being so far from his original incarnation and his host is already super nuts<br>He feels like hot shit for having his eyes and thinks he's at the top of the world after smacking around Arc, but whatever cognizance ups and leaves the building once Shiki starts killing things which aren't alive</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, but at least Roa gave us Ciel</br>  <br>Ive been wondering.<br>How does Ciel still live when they suposedly killed Roa for good in Tsukihime?<br>Arent their lifeforces linked?<br><br>Also, heres hoping we get a Ciel smashed/disemboweled/dismembered into bits and then regenerating in front of Shiki scene because god damn they missed so many oportunities with her in the original VN.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All these replies and not one mentions that it says her name right on the page, in English.</br>  <br>Roa was stable after the SHIKI personality went subvert, as his original personality became dominant. Roa was stable for the most part, it was SHIKI who was out of it since the unstable mesh of souls. Roa wasn't perfect in mental fitness, but its sure to say he was stable at least.<br><br>He got mindfucked and ran before Shiki really killed anything, Shiki just started saying "Your eyes and my eyes are different" and he was already losing his shit. You can rationalize this however you want, but it was pretty shit.<br><br>Shiki killed the building after Roa was already freaking out, not before he was freaking out in order to give him a proper reason to feel some form of fear, and Roa could have done far too many things or at least something to not look that foolish if he wasn't mentally broken after a few sentences based on something he had no context to fear towards something. Eyes of Death are only really scary if you've experienced or felt them, felt the world with them, not when some kid just goes "Well I can kill things".<br><br>Don't try to explain "But these aren't are super scary", Roa wouldn't naturally have feared them unless he had heavy context on what that world felt like which Shiki saw all the time. Only context Roa had was "I have super eyes, and they're pretty cool".<br><br>Nero's reaction was quite proper at least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least they fucked a year or two later.</br>  <br>It's not "Roa keeps Ciel alive" it's "Roa keeps Ciel from dying"</br>  WHERE IS OUR NEW HANEPIN CONCEPT?  <br>Largest bust in all of the Tsukihime side of things.</br>    <br>Not gonna lie, I've thought his reaction to only words was dumb for numerous years too, but justifying it with instability is the only way that it makes any sense. I also really like the pathetic Roa</br>  How do you make Michael Roa Valdamjong a good villain?  <br>Manga.</br>  <br>Let him reach his original power again in Sacchin route<br><br>The level of power that beat Arcuied's sister, when even Arc couldn't do that.</br></br></br>  <br>Hanepin's probably not gonna have many chances to appear.<br><br>Not unless Asagami's moved to Misaki. Which I supposed wouldn't be all too surprising at this point.<br><br>I wonder if we'll get a Kagetsu Tohya remake.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But that requires the Sacchin route to not be a ruse over a decade in the making and for the teacher to not be the new route</br>  <br>i hate it, but maybe thats because im so used to her old design<br><br>I wonder what people that know nothing of tsukihime think of this Arc?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not possible. Not with SHIKI.</br>  <br>Well she is Akiha's best or second best friend<br><br>She was maybe mentioned in one ending already. We might get some light mentions of her from Akiha at times.</br></br></br>  <br>Akiha doesn't talk about her school life much with Shiki.</br>  <br>Wait, when does Shiki rape her?</br>  <br>Shiki never shares a scene with her.</br>  <br>She even saves him in Akiha route.</br>  <br>SHIKI has a lot of innate potential as judged by Roa himself. It's just that he couldn't employ any of it since he was insane for so many years.<br><br>Mikihisa said both the kids were born with a lot of power or potential, but in different ways. If Roa judged this kid to have great potential, and great money/authority, which was another designation he was after when he chose this host, then he probably had decent potential to display his power if he was allowed to spend more time getting used to this body and let the personality stabilize with the soul.<br><br>Longer he's allowed to familiarize the more he can demonstrate, but any time the Roa personality takes dominance Arc tends to destroy him. If its just the host as the dominant soul even if they're warped Arc can't hone in on them entirely, but when Roa gains control she can find him.<br><br>Supposedly Roa and Nero team up in Sacchin route, so that's a reason why Arc wouldn't be able to get close to Roa to take him out, so he'd have more prep-time to reach more of his real power with this body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shorten her dress to a mini skirt <br> make her face rounder and younger <br> give her more uguuu poses and expressions <br><br><br>2/10, just another cash grab</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a remake<br><br>Hanepin and anything in regards to her school life wasn't created when original game was out, so of course some text will change based on newer revelations.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Jesus Christ I had to redo this because photoshop crashed.

Its way easier to get a typesetter than it is to get a translator. The first one I can actually do something about.<br><br>Post the link</br></br></br>  <br>Even so, you can't really expect SHIKI to have the same potential that the original Roa or Elesia had. Elesia's basically a freak. A mutant with ludicrous innate talent. Roa himself was a genius of tremendous caliber. <br><br>To begin with, you're getting your facts mixed up. SHIKI did have potential, but that potential doesn't come close to Akiha's. A talent as a hybrid isn't the same as talent as a Magus.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Takeguchi has finally become unable to trascend his saberface syndrome.<br>Does Akiha have saberface too? I bet Nero will have Shirouface or Kotomineface too.<br><br>On the bright side it means a ufotable anime afterwards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> On the bright side it means a ufotable anime afterwards. <br><br>Not in the state ufotable is in right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently Roa thought it was close enough, since this is the new body he chose based on three standards "Potential, money, position".<br><br>If the potential part didn't factor in so much since he couldn't employ his true powers there since "Demon powers are different, I can't use magus stuff here", then this body is kind of useless based on the first criteria. Potential of course would have to mean "Potential in which I can personally use based on my own standards in some form".<br><br>I'd say SHIKI probably had decent circuits, and so does Akiha. Maybe not on the same level as Ciel, but Roa has an enter conversation in the game where he was so impressed by the performance of his previous host that he made sure potential was a big part of the next host. Originally he was more about wealth or fame when choosing hosts supposedly, but upon tasting Ciel's ability he really reorganized his priorities and decided that power was basically the way to go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/5969-ALL-AROUND-TYPE-MOON-YAR<wbr>IO?p=1959974&amp;viewfull=1#post1959974<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  Is Shiki alive at the end of Akiha True?  <br>It's like Takeuchi became retarded and failed to recognize that part of Arc's appeal was her older appearance contrasted with her naive personality.</br>  if Takeuchi dies and Koyama is the new official illustrator of TM, we will have Aokofaces ?  <br>Type-Moon will die since no one else can make Nasu do any work.</br>  <br>Nasu would kill himself if his husbando died anyways.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127666853 <br> deleting posts <br>heh</br></br></br>  <br> She is a woman <br>nope</br></br>  <br>No, it was just Akiha being insane as usual and hearing a heartbat in a knife.

They certainly have the animators, the organization, the money, and no need to rely on a single person like Miyazaki.   next Ghibli <br> only produces otaku pandering moeshit <br><br>Does not compute</br></br></br>  On one in a context wildly different from the case of Free!, the song in they're really famous forming thing thing the lead featuring in a context wildly different of they're really different from K-On one in the lead females (or in the song the actually featuring the case of Iwatobi's swim club) perfor: from the song the actual context wildly different from their animations tent from the actual content from K-On one in the actually different from the members of the lead featuring the song the song  <br>We have Colorido as the next Ghibli.<br><br>The thing to ask is that who will be the next Telecom when their staff retires as they have been at the studio since the late 70s/early 80s.</br></br></br>  <br> next Ghibli <br> moe <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Always next Ghibli.<br><br>Colorido all the way.<br><br>Maybe Chizu, we see.</br></br></br></br></br>  Kyoani hasn't made a bad movie yet <br><br>Ghibli made some shit like Earthsea<br><br>So Kyoani has already surpassed Ghibli</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ghibli only made 1 bad movie, Earthsea was that movie and Goro got better.<br><br>Meanwhile, his other son Hidetaka has since out placed him, something Goro will never do.<br><br>Telecom is still light years away from KyoAni however.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't surpass other people by your failures, but rather your successes.</br>  This thread  <br>I like KyoAni but comparing them to Ghibli is fucking insulting <br>Also don't talk shit about Takahata</br></br>  <br>This.<br>Kyoani will always be a waifu studio, nothing more</br></br>  <br> his other son Hidetaka </br>  <br> does Kyoto Animation have the potential to become the next Ghibli? <br>Nope, if you really believe that I suggest you to get your brain tumors removed</br></br>  <br>Indeed.<br><br>Leave Takahata alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Why else will be be brought up so much lately, Goro failed replacing Hayao's fame when Hidetaka succeeded, just not in animation.</br>  bump  <br>A studio with lots of potential but squanders it on doing only stuff with the same style? I'd say they're already the new Ghibli.</br>  trigger's LWA is already so Miyazaki that it shits Answermen.  <br>No thats Colorido, KyoAni is light years behind them.</br>  <br>Trigger is not Ghibli, Trigger is Startoons and Disney Australia.</br>  If Kyoani stops animating for high schoolers and goes for an even younger crowd that Ghibli animates for, then yes.  <br>KyoAni aims at otaku (young women for Free), not high schoolers.</br>  Ghibli is Ghibli, because people that would otherwise not watch an animated film will watch an animated film made by Ghibli. If that were not the case then they would have to carve a niche out like all of the other studios and their works would reflect that.<br><br>So for any studio to be "the next Ghibli" they have to convince normalfags to watch their movies.</br></br>  <br> people that would otherwise not watch an animated film will watch an animated film made by Miyazaki <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Please stop making these stupid threads and no they aren't even operating at anywhere even remotely close to the same level of international exposure nor going for the same kind of thing that Ghibli was in it's prime let alone during it's latter years. Hows that for an answer.<br><br>Seriously Kyoani is not the studio people seem to think it is, I don't know if or when it's ever going to get through to their fanboys but they aren't even as popular as they were in the late 2000's and completely stuck within the framework of late night anime TV for otaku. They had one show really go beyond that in K-On, but then again Love Live has already gone well beyond that so that's what they'd have to be chasing first before one could even talk Ghibli.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is Grave of the Fireflies </br>  <br>Literally every anime made by Kyoani is set in high school.<br>Even fucking Full Metal Panic was set in a high school.<br>It seems like they go out of their way to make it set in high school. Even an anime about managing an amusement park is run by high schoolers.</br></br></br>  <br>School settings are used because everyone goes to school. School settings are not used to attract people currently in schools.</br>  <br> Even an anime about managing an amusement park is run by high schoolers. <br>Amaburi was an adaptation so that's not really KyoAni's fault. Besides, only one episode was set at the school.</br></br>  <br>Replying to bait this seriously makes you look like a complete retard you know?</br>  <br>Not literally. Clannad AS is not set in high school. And I haven't seen munto but it doesn't look like a high school anime to me.</br>  <br>Waifu implies the girl is straight, so no, they aren't 100% a waifu studio.</br>  <br>Amaburi is the one odd out, and coincidentally its one of the better Kyoani.<br><br><br>Didn't think hard enough on Clannad, I suppose. It did start off in high school and for a good part of AS as well.<br>Wasn't Munto an OVA series? I never seen it myself either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Colorido says hi.<br><br>I'm talking about markets.<br><br>Meanwhile at TMS.<br> Show is about 2 guys on the run from the law. <br> Show is about 2 dogs who solve crimes. <br> Show is about 3 puppy like kids who live in a water tower at a major US movie studio since the 30s. <br><br>They rarely do school shows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this guy who used to watch anime near constantly <br>He suddenly stopped, the only anime movies he still likes are most Ghibli films and Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu</br></br>  <br> Cute Girls Doing Cute Things: The Studio <br> the next Ghibli <br>I hope to fuck this was bait.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell him to watch How I Spent My Vacation, that will fix him right up.</br>  <br>It's not, he is just shooting blanks.<br><br>Colorido is the next Ghibli.</br></br></br>  THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN  <br>I don't think Kyoani has the aspiration to become the next ghibli. I think they're much more doing their own thing and just getting better and better at it. I don't see kyoani ever achieving the mainstream appeal ghibli had or focusing on stuff that is more general and less niche. Kyoani are the champions of the late night anime niche, which is great, but I don't see them pivoting to becoming generalists.</br>  Best girl.  <br>No, this is best girl in the industry.</br>  <br><br> KyoAni <br> pandering to otaku <br>Good joke. They only care about their female audience when talking about pandering.<br><br>Also Ghibli uses little girls are protags on regular basis, and that's something KyoAni really wouldn't do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They only care about their female audience when talking about pandering. <br>Only on Free, their other shows like Amaburi are aimed 100% towards men.<br><br>TMS aims at both genders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no, kyo-ani is too dependent on moe-shit to go mainstream. tbqh ufo-table has a better shot at this (despite all the typemoon shit they've been churning out)</br>  The only show that they maxed out their potential on is Clannad.<br><br>If the incorporated high-end writing with their art style, they would be set.</br></br>  <br>It's not that everyone went to school, it's that half of japan is mentally stuck in high school.</br>  <br>TMS even more then ufotable.<br><br>Just look at How I Spent My Vacation &amp; Little Nemo.<br><br>Also, this list has no KyoAni projects on it because they are not essential at all.<br><br>A US version of this is coming soon, so please wait on /co/ for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's obvious he's just going to keep making these threads regardless so who cares really. Guy needs to stop with the spam is the point.</br></br>  <br><br>Only to raging frothing at the mouth fanboys.</br></br>  <br>Okay i'm going to crack what the hell is this list?</br>  <br>Did you watch any kyoani anime beside Free faggot ?</br>  <br> does Kyoto Animation have the potential to become the next Ghibli </br>  <br><br> TMS posting this early in the morning. <br>You're a dedicated man.</br></br></br>  <br>It... it says at the top... and in the filename.<br> Stupid </br></br>  <br> Amaburi are aimed 100% towards men <br>Excuse me? We are talking about whether they pander to otaku or not.<br>Amaburi is shounen, but having a female bait protagonist.<br>Risque service like loli bath scene is even cut out to not cater to "those creeps".</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>TMS already is mainstream. They do stuff like Lupin III and Doraemon and have been around since the 40's and literally a year after the war ended. They've even done animation for tons of foreign productions you probably grew up with.</br></br>  <br>Industry stander list, also you need to watch out as the last time I posted bare asses here I got banned for a few days so be careful with those sweet cans.<br><br>http://rule34.paheal.net/post/view/<wbr>832512<br><br>Heres what the US version is for the time being.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's because it's obviously compiled by somebody coming at it from the prospect of picking the most critically acclaimed and significant of animation by actual critics, not just the otaku scene. You notice there's not much after a certain year because that's when Japanese animation started to go into the decline that people like Anno talk about. You hardly ever see Japanese animation studios do much for American TV anymore unless it's like some novelty thing, but how many people know that in the 80's Toei did animation for things like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</br></br>  <br><br>This seems to be missing a significant portion.</br></br>  <br>TMS was founded in 1964, It's Kyokuichi that was founded in 1946.<br><br>Shin-Ei Doga did Doraemon, not TMS.<br><br>But as for Ghibli grade films they only did 2, Akira &amp; Little Nemo, they were one of Ghibli's main subcontractors however until the studio shut down.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hibike is yet another shitty anime where kyoani managed to get easy yurifags and tumblr landwhales by baiting them with having 2 girls act like lesbians.  <br><br>It's more like anime that has entered the Japanese mainstream culture and which the nation as a whole identifies with as opposed to just otaku. Like as in if you were to mention it to a random person in Japan they'd probably know what it is.</br></br>  <br><br>I actually still own a copy of Little Nemo on VHS. The NES game by Capcom also owns. Nice to run across somebody that actually knows what they're talking about in this thread of all places.</br></br>  <br>It's still being worked on as to why no Steamboat Willie &amp; Plain Crazy.</br>  <br>As to why no KyoAni lead shows on on this list.<br><br>It's now on Blu-Ray uncut.<br>http://www.amazon.com/Little-Nemo-A<wbr>dventures-Slumberland-Blu-ray/dp/B0<wbr>08XJM8BO/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=143<wbr>6158953&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=little+nemo<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> hurfhurfhurfhurfhurf <br>Do you have an opinion of your own? Or all you do is happily parroting what others say?</br></br>  <br>I don't know what this means.</br>  <br>In a way, Kyoani is already Ghibli. There works are made with top-notch professionalism and their staff and animators are treated like actual human beings instead of slaves unlike other animation studios. The problem is, like Ghibli, they are not ambitious in the slightest. They don't want to expand their market outside of what they're already doing, which is just cute girls doing cute things. Free is arguably the most original work they have ever made, but for all the wrong reasons.<br><br>Unlike Ghibli though, Kyoani's business model doesn't rely on a single person. So as a company, they have already surpassed Ghibli.</br></br></br>  <br><br> ghibli <br> ambitious </br></br></br>  <br>do you have the potential to make a post that doesnt sound completely retarded and teenage</br>  <br>Who cares? KyoAni is KyoAni.

Don't know if that correlates to mating.</br>  Is Ping Pong Taiyo Matsumoto's best manga, or just the best thing to be adapted from one of his manga?  The latter, though Ping Pong is definitely up there among his works and lots of people like it the most. Go read his stuff if you haven't yet, even Ping Pong, which I personally prefer over the anime.  It's one of my favourites but Takemitsu is pretty great as well as Hanaotoko. I honestly didn't enjoy the adaptation, too much unnecessary cruft and sort of pollutes the original intention. Sunny's shaping up to be pretty good.  <br> I honestly didn't enjoy the adaptation, too much unnecessary cruft and sort of pollutes the original intention. <br>Fair point, but I still think it did a better job of carrying over Matsumoto's general tone than the Tekkon Kinkreet movie did.</br></br>  <br>Takemitsu Zamurai is my favorite and I think the best. The atmosphere is very inviting and you get sucked into the story and all the little details. Shame it isn't having an english release, I would buy it all.</br>  <br>I never got to watching Tekkonkinkreet. It looks pretty nice though.</br>  <br>I think out of his major works (by that, I mean his multi-volume series aside from his debut manga), No. 5 seems to be the most underrated. In all my years on /a/, I've pretty much never had a decent discussion on it. What'd you guys think of it? I remember some of the GWR scans having stiff or odd translation choices (I personally didn't read from english scans), so I'm not sure if that affected people''s enjoyment.</br>  <br>Never read it, so I'm probably part of the problem. Some group also localized it and distributes it on the iPhone app store, I wonder if they did a decent job, although it seems unlikely.</br>  The best is this wired as fuck 3D pilot they made in the 90's for tekkon kinkreet.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LBs<wbr>YJo5T0k0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I actually just finished watching this, I kinda wish they had done the match between tsukimoto and peco a little lengthier, but I also appreciate the way they chose to wrap things up.</br>  <br> localized it and distributes it on the iPhone app store <br><br>Wut. This is a thing now? Companies distribute official manga on app stores? Who was it? I remember Viz doing 2 volumes and then dropping it due to low sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Webook or something.</br>  <br>Fucking hell, that damn thing has been on my 'too read' list since high school. It looks like Matsumoto really playing off his Moebius influences.</br>  <br>You really should get to it. It's nice to see Matsumoto do action/thriller in his own way. The ending goes a bit Eva, to put it in a crude way, but I thought it was still a great read.</br>  <br>And yeah companies do distribute official manga in app stores individually sometimes. Google Play/Bookstore has some Yen Press, Viz and Kodansha.</br>  <br> Some group also localized it and distributes it on the iPhone app store <br>Do you know if they did the whole thing?</br></br>  <br>It appears they did. I think their intention was to do more Matsumoto, but I don't think they got further than No. 5.</br>  <br>Hey Hox, could you translate something from Fumiko Takano? I really want to read Kamisori or Bou ga Ippon</br>  <br>Yeah I was planning to do Kamisori this year but then I decided to try and wrap up Sangokushi instead. But after that, yes.</br>  So if any of you anons are like me, you read the manga after the first episode. Lets talk about it  <br>I actually read the manga before the first episode.</br>  <br>what a fag<br><br>fuck off you fat vancouverite chink</br></br></br>  <br>i wasn't that interested. I don't think many of us were. please don't spoil anything, we're not buying the manga just yet. let's take this relationship steady for now</br>  <br>I had never heard of it before its airing, which is peculiar because I've read a ton of manga and never came across it</br>  <br>The manga actually gets way better after its further past the first episode material</br>  <br>I liked it. I went to my local bookstore to buy a copy and they sadly didn't have it.<br><br>Does anyone think the story would be just as interesting without all the superhuman stuff? If it was just about mafia politics and two guys doing odd jobs?</br></br></br>  First the anime and now this.<br><br>Why does Umineko suffer so much?</br></br>  <br>Man, do you have a link with the PS3 BGs? For Umineko too?</br>  <br>Its valuable, absolutely valuable!</br>  <br>No but really.</br>  Went to panel. Very entertaining. Dude is very animated. &gt;He spoke of BT his buddy and the good time he's had. Did not mention his passing. ;_;<br> His inspiration of writing comes from him wanting to freak his readers, namely BT. <br> He confirmed he's working on Fandiscs, or rather he is interested in making them.  <br> Next WTC maybe in a different format, not limited to SN/VN.  <br> More Lolis to come.  <br> He showed leniency to his readers about explaining the ending of ep8 by confirming with the artist of the manga all what he wanted to include as extra info on Umineko. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Without the truth, love cannot be seen"</br>   [Mori] Wakako-zake - 01 [C190060B].mkv <br><br>Nobody was making a thread.</br></br>  So /a/ do you have a favorite kind of sake? I really like nigori, it's unfiltered and cloudy but sweeter and more fragrant than filtered sake.  <br>I've had some crazy dessert sake, it was really sweet and fruity. Someday I'll try to get into sake again, but shochu is just easier to drink.</br>  <br>Just as a I thought, /a/ is a bunch of plebs who haven't even tasted the fine spirits of the great nation of Japan. Either that or you're all as underaged as you seem.</br>  <br><br>I'm acyually also a big fan of nigorizake. I'm not as well-versed in sake as I would like to be, but I've tried at least a few different examples of most varieties. It's just sort of rare that I get a chance to go out somewhere where they have much of a selection.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I was lucky enough to work at a company whose CEO was a really big sushi and sake fan, so I got to try a bunch on the company dime. I don't miss the company but I do miss the benefits.</br>  Compulsory Gatchaman CROWDS thread.  Not only was I not disappointed with the new opening, I think I may like it more than the first  <br>Same. I really like the cutouts on real life shit.</br>  <br>Rui has the coolest helmet.</br>  <br>The problem with the new op is that the first one was so much better it is not even funny<br><br> no more THE CROWDS ARE CALLING MY NAME <br> no badass OJ <br> no Galactor cameo </br></br></br></br></br>  Gel wants everyone to be united.<br>But Hajime can't be united with normal people.</br>  Why do people hate the Evangelion Rebuild?  <br>Proto-Asuka from the proposal was best of all though. I imagine her being like a cross between Soryu and Hikari</br>  <br>original Asuka was just a horrid person to be around whereas Rebuild was a tsundere<br>Better or worse probably depends on whether you like characters you can like</br></br>  <br>Yeah ok one scene. I will give him credit for actually acting like a badass for once.</br>  <br> Asuka <br> not best </br></br>  <br><br>What are the dots? Acne?</br></br>  Why?  fuck off  Kishi's huge boner for the fucking Uchiha is not strong enough to make Sarada the main character for the movie, just watch Boruto win agaisnt Sarada or Sarada only winning out of technicality.  <br> Why? </br>  I sorta like the post story stuff. Its pretty comfy  why wont it end?  Praise Hana: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bHU<wbr>-QbRHS_Q</wbr>  [ ]  So this is going to be a bigger disappointment than the AkG adaptation?  <br>She's still highschool age. Her ovaries should have dropped.<br><br>Also, Hana is a total tomboy, thus her voice should be deeper than fucking HanaKana.</br></br></br>  <br> Tomboy <br>Knows how to make tea and only turns violent to boys</br></br>  <br>And i was looking forward to it. Well whatever just stick to manga i guess. You didnt even need to say who, its fucking obvious from that same monotone voice like every single character done by her.</br>   character is named Hana <br> hey guys what if we...ahahahahha... what if..... what if we..... ahahahahaahahah let Hanazawa kana dub her <br> get it guys, am i not funny <br><br>There had to be one faggot like this in production who ruined it for eveyone.</br></br></br></br>  Beware the breast beast.  <br>Do you have one of just Kyouko with the sakurafish? I want it for reasons.</br>  <br>Sadly i don't, Just a mixmash of them. Someone should though.</br>  <br>Akari is cute no matter what she wears.</br>  <br><br>10/10, would start a business with</br></br>   Akari's buns are a central plot point for an entire episode of season 3 <br><br>Could it happen?</br></br>  Is Bleach really as bad as people make it out to be? I think the character designs are pretty cool.  The RG members except Ichibei and Nimaiya, were selected to become members of the Zero squad because of what they creations which contributed to the development of the SS and the shinigami in general. <br><br>Before that they were the previous captains of squads then. It is true that it was Urahara who first created the science division. But that does not mean, no one else did anything related to science and research and development.<br><br>Hikifune became the member of Zero squad, because she was the one to form the idea and create mod souls, which Urahara continued from.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know whats up.</br>  <br>No... not Lil</br>  <br>That all can literally be explained with the latest chapter, Ichigo and Ishida may be mutant quincies ala haschwalth and ywach</br>  <br><br><br>Adding on to that Isshin and masaki may be older than what we think, given that quincy age differently. Who's to say masaki isn't +20 or so years than we thought given the scarcity of quincy after the extermination</br></br></br></blockquote>]
