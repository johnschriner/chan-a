I want the return of Type 74-kun most of all however.</br></br></br>  <br>Yao is on the cast list, she HAS to be in the first 24 episodes</br>  how they gonna introduce this bastard into the anime?  <br>black screen with white text</br>  <br>"Enormous Amounts of Rape"</br>  <br>I think it would have been a bit cooler if they went with the Type 10 instead, though I guess that using the latest tech isn't necessary for fighting medieval style armies.</br>  <br>Yeah, hopefully Type 10 will make a cameo at some point. Just for tank-service's sake.</br>  Why do medievals have a lower standard of morals than moderns?  <br><br>Because they did in reality?</br></br>  <br><br>They are needed outside when China decides they really need the gate. <br><br>70's tech works perfectly well vs Romans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the "morals" you know today have only happened after extraordinary periods of peace - something your average peasant in the medieval ages never experienced.</br>  <br><br>No, no, i get that<br><br>I'm asking why</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because religions had more to say back then.</br></br>  <br> They are needed outside when China decides they own the Gate because China. <br>fix'd</br></br>  <br>What  said.<br><br>It's just like now. Poor people have different morals from the rich.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't care if you laugh at me but that's really true.</br>  <br>He's right you know</br>  <br>This. It should be black or deep purple, maybe red.</br>  <br>Is she okay?</br>  <br>she's  Alive, but also plotting a series of events that would lead to his utter defeat and humiliation. It also gets one of the MC's warbros knifed and hospitalized. </br>  <br>silhouette behind curtain</br>  <br>Ah poor bunny after all that rape, or is that rape her defeat and humiliation?</br>  <br>bunny races, poor decision maker</br>  <br> She gave herself to him to spare her people, of course he fucking lied about it. Lots of decapitated bunny girls, but moreover, you should see who else he's had his way with. She's got beastmen spies fucking everywhere. </br>  <br><br>Damn I see.</br></br>  <br>Yeah...  The douche prince gets interrogated. I'll leave that to your imagination. </br>  <br>When will this happen in the anime if it does happen?</br>  <br>I have no idea. Not too long in there. How many episodes are planned right now? 12? Then if we're lucky we get it mid-season, maybe  Fire Dragon slain as the finale? </br>  <br>Ah kk, nice trips.</br>  Could any amount of plate armour stop a bullet?  <br>it's 24 episodes, I think</br>  How did colonial powers in our world stop the natives from getting technology? <br><br>I only ask because I'm trying to figure out if the JSDF needs to take precautions or if there's simply no way the fantasys could recreate a working firearm without help.</br></br>  <br>Go read Drifters.</br>  <br>depends on the type of bullet, gun firing, and type of steel.<br><br>But yes, a solid foot of steel could stop most moving things.</br></br></br>  <br>By not selling it to them.</br>  <br>The JSDF themselves don't put the tech out in the market and put sanctions on things like Gate-Japan dictionary.</br>  <br>I don't think they could reverse engineer any type of gun even if they had one due to the reason that despite guns being massively produce nowdays they still require precision machinery for a lot of their parts. At best they could develop a cannon, or a single shot gun.</br>  <br>I reckon modern pistol rounds might have trouble, they weren't designed with penetration in mind.<br><br>Probably useless against any standard army rifle.</br></br></br>  <br> How did colonial powers in our world stop the natives from getting technology? <br>The JSDF avoids technical training of the locals.<br> And the Gate Gods coincidentally help in preventing tech advancements. Japan probably won't be allowed to set up schools even if they wanted to. </br></br></br>  <br>From ladies pistols most likely. And Colts.</br>  <br>So it's not Outbreak Company universe.</br>  <br>There's so fucking much information needed to reproduce technologically more advanced shit than what you're used to.<br><br>They wouldn't be able to even reproduce assault rifle since it'd be too mechanically and metallurgically complex not to mention cartridges and the chemistry involved in them. Even if they somehow learned to produce simple gunpowder they'd have to figure out how to mass produce saltpeter for it to be any good.</br></br></br>  I just read the manga, 47 chapters later and they still think that shields will block an assault rifle only to be mowed down in surprise.  <br>Well seeing how the people who do know they do jackshit not spreading the knowledge or being dead it's understandable.</br>   tfw manga will never continue to be translated   <br>The problem is there not being any chapters anon.</br>  <br> I just read the manga, 47 chapters later and they still think that shields will block an assault rifle only to be mowed down in surprise. <br>They don't have internet. Hell, they don't even have telegrams. the JSDF is barely a myth to the Empire, news travel slowly, and even when the news arrived it takes a long time to be believed.</br></br>  <br><br>Plate armor is around 2mm thick. <br><br>Won't stop even .22 rounds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's that feature for, anyway?</br>  <br>This, they even mentioned that it takes 13 days to travel between Alnus and the Capital, meanwhile the JSDF can get there in a day.</br>  <br>Sex</br>  <br><br>When are we getting actual sex with Rory or Tuka Tuka Bird Elf?</br></br>  <br>It's it nowadays just a shirt with panties instead of a one piece?</br>  <br>Technically Pina just had a bunch of nobles and shit at her afternoon party and the JSDF even let some nobles shoot rifles and then they fired mortars. All that was done at her estate, which is in the capital.</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be a non-sequitur or something?</br>  <br>Water going in between the breasts have to get out of the swimsuit somewhere or it will balloon up.</br>  <br>Yea but they were keeping quiet because they didn't wanna get executed for treason</br>  <br> And Colts. </br>  <br>That's BS!</br>  <br>Nigga just shut up and enjoy the view.</br>   You will never suddenly become naked and cum in tears from seeing a few old planes in the air, and appear next panel fully clothed.   <br> Yea but they were keeping quiet because they didn't wanna get executed for treason <br>And the only reason the demonstration was done was because the JSDF was getting impatient. News got to the Emperor but he didn't believe it.<br><br>In general the low travel of news is a great military advantage to Japan, if the goal was to invade and conquer. But that wasn't the goal, the goal was to get a peace treaty signed. And that is why it is instead a great stumbling block. The longer the Empire thinks it stood a chance, the longer the war lasts, the more people get killed and civil infrastructure gets destroyed. This would mean when peace finally comes the surviving Empire government would be more politically unstable and thus making the peace treaty itself less sustainable. Japan does what to keep the local government around, they don't want to deal with a civil war.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shouldn't be a problem as of the latest chapter, as everyone saw what the JSDF can do.</br>  <br>I want to steal her lucky medal and hide it somewhere</br>  Any of you seen City Hunter?  Yes, but I didn't finish it.  Yes but I didn't get very far. I'm saving the rest of it for later.  It needs a bd.  <br>Yes it's my favorite anime and I watch it every year or so.</br>  nicky  <br>Why doesn't it have one already?</br>  <br>not yet it's on my list.</br>  <br>I'll probably get back to it once I finished Urusei Yatsura and Mobile Suit Gundam.</br>  Just finished the Black Army arc in City Hunter 2 a couple days ago. It was just so fucking good, probably the peak of the series for me so far and there have been a lot of damn good episodes.<br>But the moment this song kicked in at the climax of the arc just solidified it as a masterpiece to me. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9og<wbr>Bk8wPwpc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's just such a fun anime that I can't help but love it.</br></br></br>  <br>Liked the first season, 2nd was ok, the rest is shit with exception of some of the movies, ovas.</br>  <br>Why is Akira Kamiya so good?<br>He's probably the greatest VA of the 80's and one of the greatest ever.</br></br>  Just finished ZZ less than an hour ago. It had some good episodes here and there but it was overall pretty dissapointing. I feel like I would be able to appreciate it more if it weren't a sequel to Zeta. Also, pic related is the best suit in ZZ.  <br>ZZ had a variety of nice Mobile Suits.<br><br>If you think the Queen Mansa is nice, you're going to like the Kshatriya from Unicorn a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Ryo, Mendou, Coach mitaka<br><br>he truly plays the basest characters.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched Unicorn yet but what I've seen of the NZ-666 looks amazing.</br>  Will there ever be another series like Patlabor?  <br>No. Anime has changed. The industry has changed.</br>  <br>Don't forget.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W3c<wbr>3ScxUUEk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>That playful voice and then serious voice.<br><br>SO FUCKING GOOD MAN.</br></br></br>  <br>The nummer of episodes puts me off. Is it good and what could I expect? Is it comedy?<br><br>Also I got the BD of Rose of Versailles downloaded and muxed the subs for all episodes and now it's ready to be rewatched in glorious 1080p. Too bad the subs from episode 31 upwards are from the DVD release and are badly timed.</br></br></br>  <br>Kenshirou, Roy, Akira Hibiki and a lo of other characters too.<br><br>Kinnikuman just isn't the same without Kamiya and Daisuke Gori.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vs5<wbr>2iyo559o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more than just that, though. There was never really anything like Patlabor at any point in time. It's the only thing to have ever come of Headgear, which was one of the greatest collection of creative talents the industry has ever seen. 'Labor of love' (pun not intended) does not even begin to describe it.</br>  <br>under arrest or whatever it was called with the 2 cop girls is pretty similar</br>  <br>Are you planning on following up with more Gundam, such as CCA or Unicorn?<br><br>CCA is a treat visually but some of the characters and motivations are a little lackluster. You'll see what I mean (or maybe have a contrasting opinion) when you get through it.<br><br>After that, Unicorn and Victory have some slick Mobile Suit designs to look forward to. Victory especially has some that break from tradition while retaining the humanoid shape, but not nearly as much as Turn A.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of City Hunter, I saw that the manga is being scanlated again. <br>Is it any good?</br></br>  <br>It's similar to the point of being slice of life about police. Beyond fairly superficial elements there isn't all that much in it.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm going to check out CCA and Unicorn next. I'm looking forward to the focus returning to characters from 0079 in CCA but like you mentioned I've heard some negative stuff about Char's characterization in the film which I'm not looking forward to.</br>  <br>That's not Daisuke Gouri though. Toei recast everyone except for Kinnikuman and Meat when they adapted the Throne arc.</br>  <br><br><br>I watched the first movie today and it was just fucking great. It had the typical Oshii movie structure of begin with action, proceed to drama, conspiracies, and politics, and finish with action.  Type 0 vs Type 98 fight was baller as fuck </br></br></br>  <br>While I wasn't fond of what they did with Char in CCA, I had bigger gripes over the newly introduced characters. There are a number of aggravating scenes, especially as your progress through the film, all thanks to their meddling.<br><br>You may or may not find the ending to your liking too.</br></br></br>  <br> AV-98 versus AV-0 fight <br>Just about the best moment in the franchise. Noa put all but the most extreme of badasses to shame.</br></br>  I miss the golden age of anime.  <br>There are still some nice anime here and there today.<br><br>If anything I miss my OVAs.</br></br></br>  <br>that pic gave me warm, fuzzy feelings</br>  <br>I'm trying to think of a series with a better dynamic between two main characters. I'm coming up blank.</br>  <br>I don't know, Patlabor reminds of Planetes in a lot of ways.</br>  <br>GE999, though it's a bit different in nature.<br>Well, generally most Matsumoto couples have really good dynamic, be it Maetel and Tetsuro or Harlock and Tochiro.</br></br>  <br>*reminds me of<br>Though yeah, I can't think of anything else.</br></br>  Watched the  dub  of Space Warrior Baldios film from an ancient VHS rip with tracking/mono and stereo issues.<br><br>Despite being an original work, it felt a lot like the Korean Gundam ripoff, Space Black Knight. The stilted voice acting, the absolute ridiculousness, etc. Even with regards to the original voice acting, it doesn't seem like it would be particularly enjoyable. If anything, the shoddy actors made it more entertaining.<br><br>That and the English song "So Long Ago" by Brian Haverty/George Reseter thrown in as the OP and ED. Somehow, it sounds more fitting than the original Japanese song, especially with how the Baldios mech is barely present throughout the entire middle of the film.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well,  anime Tanabe is space Noa and Hachi isn't exactly dissimilar to Asuma.</br>  The oldest one I've watched was Captain Harlock. It's good, but it hasn't aged well at all.  <br> but it hasn't aged well at all. <br>I want this meme to end.</br></br>  <br>It gets even more amazing once you find out that a literal whore pilots it</br>  I have not seen it. Funny that i have seen teh jackie chan movie version and the shitty fuckboi korean soap opera version. <br><br>It's like 30 gigs of the whole thing. I need to check it out.</br></br>  <br>I picked up an OVA of the show on VHS format at some Library sale. Had no idea what I was getting into at the time, Shit was God-Tier</br>  <br>In all fairness, lack of Baldios seems to be only a problem with the movie.<br><br>From what I've heard, the TV series itself is pretty decent. But a lack of English subtitles is keeping me from checking it out.</br></br></br>  <br>I heard very conflicting opinions on City Hunter so I haven't given it a shot yet.<br><br>But I'm running out of high-quality OVAs to watch so I might pretty soon.</br></br></br>  <br> Somehow, it sounds more fitting than the original Japanese song, especially with how the Baldios mech is barely present throughout the entire middle of the film. <br><br>The lyrics of the Japanese theme do fit the series pretty well.  In that they are pretty ironic. </br></br></br>  Yes, City hunter is a lovely show. The opening is classy.  <br>Yeah, from the looks of things the original TV series has Baldios present in almost every episode. The movie focuses a lot on the character interactions, though I can't say if it's for better or worse. A shame about the lack of subs, I would check it out otherwise.<br><br><br> The blue of Hope loved by father, mother everybody, will be revived <br> Blue Blue Blue Fixer, Baldios, save the future! <br> The colour of memories lost somewhere will revive the blue of Earth <br><br>I'm going to go out on a limb and assume the TV series follows the same events as the movie? If so, that's hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe that the plot points are mostly the same albeit very compressed in the film version, but the film has the slightly less depressing ending.</br>  <br>It depends on your ability to handle a long series with a mostly strict formula.</br>  currently watching its. Is very funny but I dread that it might get repetitive after a while, particular the, perverted similar jokes.  <br>i wish there would be more main couples in anime with so natural interaction as those two</br>  <br> Couple <br>They're clearly just friends.<br><br>But seriously, I agree completely. You can feel and see it, you don't need to be told THESE ARE THE ONES WITH SEXUAL TENSION. It emerges naturally from the two characters and how they interact with each other. It's also handled with a remarkable respect for subtlety not usually seen in anything Japanese. Most of the time it's a source for cute interactions or gags but there's also a bunch of very nicely handled and often quite touching scenes between them. TV in particular did a great job showing how their bond develops, culminating in pic related at the very end of the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It helps a lot when you have two people that enjoy each other's company. Most anime romances don't seem to go for that.</br>  Has anyone seen Dangcougar? General consensus from what I've seen is that it's nothing special for an old mecha series. But the final dancougar design in SRW Z looked so fucking cool I got curious about it.  <br> it's nothing special for an old mecha series. <br>It's OBARI at his finest, the hell are you talking about?<br>Dancouga is great.</br></br></br>  Lately watched the Queen Emeraldas OVAs, pretty nice and Emeraldas is a cool character, loved the anthology feel to them but I was wondering where to go next for Leiji Matsumoto stuff, I've only seen that and Arcadia of My Youth.  <br>Hey man, that's just what I've seen from looking around for reviews.<br>I'll check it out then.</br></br>  What are some 80s series that got BDs anyway? They're obviously too old for it to be somewhat sensible, but I know Zeta got them since Sunrise got the dosh and fanbase.  Why does anime before 2000 look significantly less embarrassing and gay  <br>Queen Emeraldas OVA is goat, shame for that CG ruining ruining the opening and the last two episodes but the first half of the show is absolutely gorgeus.<br><br>Don't trust reviews anon, Dancouga is as OBARI as you can get and if you like combining robots and rock it's a damn fine treat.</br></br></br>  <br>How is the TV series? I enjoyed both movies and the OVA series immensely.</br>  <br> if you like combining robots and rock it's a damn fine treat. <br>Then I shall now proceed to pleasure myself with this series</br></br>  <br>cute, girly, etc have always been around<br>even worse, you had furry back then</br></br>  <br><br>The opening looked pretty silly and it has not aged well at all but my favourite episodes were probably Siren and the one where Hiroshi and the old man fought the cyborg. The western inspired elements also gave it a really nice charm towards everything too.</br></br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/JSaDZL7W<br><br>More important question, what are some that actually have subs and you can download. I already have a good number in glorious 1080p but it's kinda hard to look for them all.</br></br></br>  <br> Pre-2000s <br><br>Yeah, I LOVE DBZ!!</br></br></br>  <br>That's a really simple but really important point. I think that this is an issue caused by people drawing more on other media than real life, but so many romances lack any actual chemistry or even the ability to believe that the characters more than tolerate each other.<br>Before you get to anythign else it's apparent that Noa and Asuma just really like being around each other, with the rest of their relationship flowing from that point.<br><br>All of Patlabor has an excellent BD release. By some miracle it's even getting picked up by distributors in the west. It's a much loved IP in Japan and also just got a live action series.<br><br>Softer colours, art shifts.<br><br>It's like an extended and fleshed out OVA1. TV and OVA2 are personally my favourite entries in the franchise, since they give the characters room grow and the setting the ability to stretch its legs. It's a strange mix of OVA1 style shenanigans, straight up bizarre premises (remember the time that SV2 became Colonial Marines?) as well as some excellent dramatic presentation and character moments.<br>Watch it. Watch all of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Siren was a cool episode but if you followed the Harlock universe there are so many contradictions you'll probably feel puzzled, even so it was nice to see Tochiro.<br>The Cyborg episode was nice but I didn't like it as much as the first arc and with the animation quality being much lower it was a bit of a let down, the plot was well written though I liked the idea of a man turned cyborg who continuously upgraded parts.</br></br>  <br> 1980+35 <br> still needing subs for chinese cartoons </br></br>  <br><br> Leiji universe has so many contradictions <br>Having only watched Arcadia of My Youth the flashback to the Siren and Emeraldas's fight where she got her scar confused the shit out of me considering in Arcadia is basically an origin story of how it happened. I'm guessing Matsumoto is either forgettable or just likes to contradict himself a lot?<br><br>The way they took down the cyborg was pretty creative too, using the very elements themselves along with the gravitational field was a smart idea, you can tell a lot went into the writing process.<br><br>I think I'll watch the Harlock series next then start Galaxy Express 999 sometime in the late summer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm guessing Matsumoto is either forgettable or just likes to contradict himself a lot? <br>Matsumoto just flat out said he doesn't really care as long as the story is good, all the stuff in the Leijiverse doesn't really make sense in the little particulars, if you've noticed, in Queen Emeraldas there also is a fifth Dragoon, whereas in SSX and the normal Harlock universe the Dragoons were canonically 4, so there's that.<br>GE999 is also great, I warmly suggest you to also watch the OVAs.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Has anything come out on bluray lately besides cutey honey?<br><br>I know we're getting slayers soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been on my backlog forever.</br>  <br>Tobikage and Orguss came out in 2014, and Megazone 23 will be released in the next months.</br>  kaori a shit cockblocking faggot  I want this so badly.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/Orcm7fUx4Z8  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Polymar <br>Good taste Anon, and that bluray release looks fantastic as well.<br>Did classic Casshern get a bluray?</br></br></br>  <br>I caught some of it on a foreign TV channel while i was on vacation as a kid but I haven't gotten into the whole series as of yet.<br><br>That should happen soon though, as I'm almost done with the first half of the 80's section of my anime backlog (Maison Ikkoku, Dirty Pair, Area 88 and a bit of Urusei Yatsura left).</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. It got a Japanese BD release a few years ago and from what I gather Sentai Filmworks actually put out their own blu-ray set. No idea if they are pretty much the same thing or not though.</br>  <br>Thanks for the info Anon, I'll hunt it down.<br>Casshern is one of my favorite old shows,  might even consider buying a copy for my mother since she liked it as well when she was young. </br></br>  Finished Gundam X the day before yesterday, and am almost halfway through with TurnA.<br>I was slightly disappointed with Gundam X, despite having an interesting setting and premise, as it turned into more "Hurrdurr Newtypes" bullshit like with most of early UC. Nice Gundam designs though. The ending, while obviously rushed due to cancellation and cliche, negated all the Newtype stuff, and I think it was the first Gundam ending that I fully enjoyed and was happy with since finishing 0079. <br>TurnA so far is excellent though. Intriguing story, great setting (sometimes it feels as though I'm watching a Ghibli film, or something like Akage no Anne), great characters, breathtaking art and animation(the sheer amount of detail on the close-ups of most Mobile Suits and vehicles turns my dick into diamonds). The pacing is perfect - action scenes are used sparingly and when there is one it's usually worth it, and when there isn't an action scene the story slowly develops and you learn more and more about the world and characters. I can definitely see why people who liked the more action-heavy Gundam series would say it's boring, but it's perfect for me. It's like Tomino spent most of the 90s laying eggs of dubious and varying quality, then accidentally laid a golden one.<br>One thing that I don't about it is the editing or visual direction, or whatever you call it. While most of the show is gorgeous, there are some shots that genuinely make me wonder how it made the final cut, and the sheer amount of wipe transitions, sometimes after consecutive scenes, bother me. It reminded me of Star Wars, and upon googling to find examples I found exactly what I thought of, https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=usX<wbr>ca7W_jvM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Other than that, planning on watching Genocyber and Ninja Scroll later this week. Genocyber for the over-the-top M.D Geist-esque gore, and Ninja Scroll because I heard it was quite popular in the US in the 90s. Are there any other "must-see" short OVAs or films?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No problem. Hope you  and your mom   enjoy it.<br><br>Speaking of Sentai though, they really ought to release the rest of Urashiman.</br></br></br>  <br> Are there any other "must-see" short OVAs or films? <br>Well, since you're going to watch Ninja Scroll you should also watch the other Kawajiri adaptations from Madhouse, Makai Toshi Shinjuku, Youjuu Toshi, Cyber City Oedo and Vampire Hunter D, they're all great OVAs, maybe MTS is the weakest of all of those because it's kinda too normal and shonen-esque but it's still great.<br>Also, I suggest you definitely check out most of the Madhouse stuff from that time the two Midnight Eye Goku OVAs, Robot Carnival is also a must see for me though it's not from Madhouse.<br><br>Thanks again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had to guess, because Sunrise is focusing their remastering budget on smaller projects (like Patlabor) or old Gundam.</br>  I've been going through City Hunter. About 1/3rd the way through City Hunter 2 and I adore it. Sure it's kinda formulaic, and the status quo is like, sacred and untouchable. But the characters are fun, the jokes are good, and the whole thing is actually surprisingly well animated and cleverly written. It's kind of amazing how self aware it is too. It's like they know about our jokes!  Bump with easy Webbum maker for use with your favourite retro animé.<br>https://euclide.me/webmbuilder/</br>  <br>Still halfway through Patlabor and Cobra, too many stuff to watch in too little time. I have developed a liking to older anime however, it definitely has its charm and some things like Roujin Z or Cyber City Oedo are fucking amazing stuff that isn't made anymore.</br>   Client comes to him in the immediate aftermath of her sister being murdered <br> He hits on her furiously  <br><br>That kind of turned me off from watching more. He seems like an asshole.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's action mixed with comedy fueled by everything 80s.</br></br>  <br>Yes and a new OVA came out a few days ago. No raws for it yet though.</br>  <br><br><br>Dancouga is a interesting show in that it was an attempt to lightly 'deconstruct' mecha shows of the time, especially super robot shows. what Gundam was doing was clearly working at the time and so the creators decided to make a very Super Robot show (ie it combines, alien invasions, team of 4-5 youngsters work together) but wrap it in more grounded/gritty/realistic storyline and setting (much of humanity is part of the resistance group/lots of casualties of war/character fates do not fare well/the opponents and enemies are more charming and formidable than the good guys). A major point being that the main robot, Dancouga does not combine until episode 16, and even then they barely win.<br><br>Dancouga's downfall is that it got cancelled because toys were not selling but people still watched the show and liked the characters. Being cancelled the story was cut short and the last 8 or so episodes really throw a lot of what made the show good out of the window.<br><br>Dancouga is not a 'traditional' show by any means, it focuses more on character relationships than battle sequences (much of which is just punching things or shooting things).<br><br>I enjoyed the show, but I felt let down by the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not so sure how I feel about a new cast but we will see how that goes.</br>  Violence Jack is the best.  <br>Didn't it get an OVA though?</br>  <br>Blame it on dagumi jdm</br>   Toei can make Saint Seiya not shit <br>holy fug<br>they had a lot of great source material to work with with their other series but they can polish a turd when they need to</br></br>  <br> I miss the golden age of anime. <br><br>But we are in the golden age right now!<br><br>It will be no longer a golden age if the number of anime shows gets reduced to say 90% of this year's output</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of like saying that the late nineties/early noughties were the golden age of e-commerce.</br>  <br>Ryo Saeba is based as fuck he pretty much is how I think Ataru is going to be when he grows up</br>  Is this the Bastard thread?  <br>That hair is the tits.</br>  <br>SAINT SEA HAT!

That OP is catchy. I think I'm getting hooked into mecha anime though.  <br>Bubblegum Crisis (the original ones) as well as Gall Force have GOAT hair.<br><br>so does the original Burn Up!<br/></br></br></br>  <br>I also watch my favorites everywhere or so</br>  <br>Noa a qt. Also,<br> dubs </br></br>  <br>Spanish anime dubs tend to have experienced voice actors that already did work on western film/tv show dubs<br><br>So, they're not bad like English dubs, in short.</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, but I still question it here given how perfect the original cast is.</br>  <br>TIME TO SHOOT A DUCK!

Plus EG is retired now so he will not do anymore. Victory will get something most likely from /m/.</br>  <br>I know, that's exactly why I said "QC'd".

The blood and skulls of the opponents you’ve personally beheaded can be used to trade for other goods.” </br></br>  <br>I like when it is reasonably edgy.</br>  <br>doge edit when?</br>  <br> It was bothersome, so I killed him. <br>It's lines like these that come off as comedic.</br></br>  Literally edgy  <br>Is this a meme?</br>  <br>Anybody can see that he is being edgy as fuck here.</br>  What's the difference between dark and edgy?  <br> The other girl will never get to have f/u/n time with Ayana </br>  <br>He also probably raped hundreds of women when he was a feudal lord<br>  %90 human history is actually consists of endless rape cycle </br></br>  <br>Rape was pretty common back in the day</br>  She almost lost to the edge like her dad  <br> finger clicking <br>Make it stop</br></br>  <br>It's not edgy if you like it unironically.</br>  <br>Good thing that Dadruto caught that edge with his talk no jutsu and snipped it in the bud.</br>  <br>You will</br>  <br>I don't even like Naruto but Sasuke's daughter a qt</br>  <br>Does anyone have the shop where the clown instead tells a joke</br>    <br> threading your own post. </br>    <br>Define edgy</br>  <br>there's blood and death</br>    <br>I don't like it.</br>  <br>Nigga's just protecting his waifu, give him a break.</br>  <br>Which is ironic, since Hakuryuu is literally Sinbad's bitch now.</br>  <br>stop it boner</br>  <br>Unnecessary blood,death,angst and rape to make people think the story is deep or mature.</br>  <br>I'm saying! Good think he honed that skill throught his life and finally perfected it with sasuke or who knows what would have happen, we might have had salada trying to up root konoha and her eyes bleeding.</br>  <br>What does naruto have to do with it that's not even his kid.......... Naw im just playing but yeah I agree her and himawarai should actually be the star of the shows</br>  <br> Roy about to kill the everloving shit out of the monster that killed Hughes in the greatest way possible. <br> Edgy <br>Newfags these days have no idea of what edgy means.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't even care about the series anymore, but they better not even think about trying to hook Boruto up with Sarada.</br>  <br>It was thanks to Guts being autistic and abandoning Griffith in his hour of need that the torture happened in the first place.<br>Guts doesn't deserve a happy ending.</br></br>  <br>fun fact, this manga take place in the same universe as nier + drakengard ending E</br>  <br>Naruto may be a retarded hokage but at least he has a 1000 times more sense towards children than any adult shown during the regular manga run</br>  <br>have source to back it up?</br>  Kumagawa is the perfect edgy character, he's a girly looking weak manlet and still intimidates everyone by being a massively overpowered edgelord.  <br>http://drakengard-3.com/timeline.ht<wbr>ml<br>"The “Luciferase” appears to be most effective on young people. The drug is given to young adults with higher physical prowess, who are later promoted as civilian employees.<br><br>The “Fifth Crusade”, mostly comprised of teens, is organized.<br><br>The “Hameln Organization” is established as an international organization to scout for children of high physical ability from across the globe and raise them as battle machines"<br>http://nier.wikia.com/wiki/Hamelin_<wbr>Organization</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  haha you loser,we're all whores except for you  <br><br>That ain't edgy, that's history.</br></br>  <br>this is such a weird manga</br>  <br>Naw, he's avenging his bro, Hughes.</br>  <br>Read his name as anti-sex for a second.</br>  <br>You can say he got those girls  screwed </br>  The great thing about Murcielago is that everyone is edgy, even the characters you think aren't edgy.  <br> multipul men </br>  What is that one manga that sent out teenagers to war and they keep dying?  <br>that's called real life</br>  Basically anything yandere  <br/>  <br>Thanks</br>  Dead girl on her period is pretty edgy.  <br>Kimi Shi ni Tamou Koto Nakare</br>  <br>GOD FUCKING DAMMIT CARLOS</br>  <br>Sorry, I got it mixed up with the other time he was very mad at Envy</br>  <br>Everything touching the mediteranean sea is 100% rape</br>      <br>Bastard isn't edgy, that would be if it took itself seriously. The source material.might be edgy but Bastard has treated it the same way Metalocalypse did heavy metal.</br>  <br>what about one piece? nothing is edgy in one piece?</br>  <br>only law is everything that's edgy with one piece.</br>  <br>Hachiman ?</br>    <br>The whole point of this scene is anti edge though.</br>  <br>yeah... i think youre right</br>  <br>He almost seems like a parody though with how mocked he is.</br>  <br>well he is about to get un-edgy by the strawhat.</br>  Because saying fuck is cool -.-  <br>Uh... that's not edgy. That's just goofy.</br>  <br>Why can't more men be like Kouji.<br>So pure and honest.</br></br>  Shira's pretty edgy.  <br> abandoning Griffith in his hour of need <br>More like breaking free from the control of a "friend" who doesn't see you as an equal in the first place</br></br>  <br> -_- </br>    <br> mangareader.net </br>  So far, this is the most edgiest panel in the thread.<br>Try to top it.<br><br>Only reply back unless you know the context of this.</br></br></br>  <br>do you think is good one piece have nothing edgy? I remember the beginning of Naruto, and was more adventure than drama. when it became edgy, it became bad. maybe that's why one piece still has consistency.</br>  <br>I don't need the context, you win.<br><br>spoiler that shit the next time.</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto was edgy as fuck in the beginning?<br>Zabuza only became a ninja because he killed his whole class.<br>Not to mention stab through the chest and decapitation and Gaara using sand to blow up 3 people.<br><br>It got dumb when the edginess no longer made sense or was a full blown parody.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't need the context <br><br>Trap guy gets trapped by a group of rapists. They bring a fat gay rapist because they realize she is actually a he. The rapist literally rapes him to death and then they put his head on of his dolls. You see all of this minus the head on doll part.<br><br> spoiler that shit the next time. <br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot the part that he didnt escaped and endured all that shit because his stand was saving his friends asses</br>  <br>Pretty much this. Edgy has lost all meaning.</br>  Sasuke ruined naruto with his edge  <br>Naruto ruin Naruto.</br>  <br> JUST </br>  <br>This. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=31h<wbr>GgXSP9Oo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Imlpying Guts didnt live through 1000x more suffering than this </br>  <br><br>We went off a bad track when we accepted it to mean anything other than uptight angsty teens. Chuuni went the same way, and now it means pretty much any fantasy setting.</br></br>  <br>Or the fact the rapist actually helped him save his friends by injecting him with something that kept him up so he could feel all of the rape till he died.</br>  <br>Based gay rapist.</br>  <br><br>Sounds hot</br></br>  <br>Sasuke ruined it though. He wasn't even fun edgy just annoying edgy.</br>  <br>It doesn't you sick, sick individual.</br>    <br>He was fun edgy during the summit. Edgy annoying all the other times.</br>  <br>The only fun part on the summit was him getting hurt by the Kages.</br>  It's time.        <br>No, they don't. It's an endless fucking annoyance to see everyone throw around and call things edgy. It's like no one knows what real edge is anyone or they weren't alive during the 90s when everything *was* cringe inducing edge bullshit like Spawn.</br>    <br>But Spawn was good.</br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Stabbing your brain = edgier than stabbing your throat.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I remember this one. It was the one with the neet that travels to the past and rape his classmates, right? What's the name of the manga?</br>  <br>Last page<br><br><br>It's about presentation, that also never happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really.<br><br>I did enjoy it but I wasn't turned on though.</br></br></br>  <br> the biggest edgelord ever conceived  <br> not sasuke <br>2/10 too much memes</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Did she died?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like how you pussies who cant handle gore try to insult manga for adults.<br><br>Go back to shonen shit and boring SOL, all the best manga are "edgy".</br></br>  <br>This. Take out every Sasuke interaction with the rest of the characters and all of them will be less shitty.</br>  no specific screen caps, but Sekai Oni is pretty edgy.  <br>Stale pasta is old.</br>  <br> Go back to shonen <br> shonen doesn't have edgy shit <br>Literally the first post.</br></br></br>  <br>Step it up senpai</br>  <br>You have 10 minutes to name a good manga that has no gore.</br>  <br>And theres 10 minutes I win , get fucked faggot. Your shit opinion doesn't matter and neither does your life. Kill yourself loser.</br>  <br>is it bad if this made my peepee hard</br>  <br>Is he attacking Metallica?</br>  Nothing can be edgier than Gantz  <br>What are you trying to say, anon?</br>  <br>Read more manga</br>  <br>The fuck? <br><br>Is that Casca? Does everybody want to rape Casca? Is she half-Elf or something? Why this.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I remember I read on 2ch a few years back that Mohiro "I want to kill a loli" Kitoh is a pedophile who roams the deep web. I'm starting to think it might be real.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People who haven't even read Berserk keep taking that page out of context<br>It's basically a nightmare sequence where Guts is afraid of hurting the ones he cares about, namely Casca<br>It's like the opposite of edgy</br></br></br>  <br>Umareru Kachi no Nakatta Jibun ga Anna no Tame ni Dekiru Ikutsuka no Koto</br>  <br> -.- <br>I know why you're calling it edgy, go back to tumblr</br></br>    <br> m-muh tumblr booegyman! </br>  Is berserk even good or is it just filled with blood and sex  <br>she's alive anon</br>  <br>No he didn't. <br><br>You're dumb if you think Guts went through more than a dude tortured every single day for a year. And it wasn't common torture, they destroyed him</br></br></br>  <br> the good boy that helped her was actually the most insane of them all other than the protagonist herself </br>  <br> had to kill all his loved ones in order to become stronger <br><br>No he doesn't, he needs to kill his party members. He doesn't care about them, well he doesn't like killing them either but it's not like he loves them</br></br></br>  Collapse of the World as We Know It  <br>Fruits Basket got too edgy for a manga about bishounen turning into cute fuzzy animals.</br>  <br>What is that supposed to be? Some dead loli's head on the body of a puppet?</br>  <br>Yes and yes</br>  <br>It's a trap's head on the body of one of his art pieces.</br>  <br>That's not period blood m8, after people die they shit themselves.</br>  <br>Close it's the head of a gay shota</br>  This mangaka tries so hard; her shoujo manga is the edgiest.  <br><br>At first Haku took alibaba's leg as in removing control of it. Alibaba took Haku's legs before his soul was sent to the dark rukh realm. <br> Finding humor in irony. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah you're right because he should of spent his whole life holding griff hands! Man griff was just being a gay bitch nigga and decided to go and do some dumb shit because his BF left him and NTR his black bitch from him</br>     wanting to commit suicide after being on this post a minute to long   <br> edge meme thread <br> 200+ replies <br><br>Summer is here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> opposite <br> implying edgy, on the way children spam it, has a meaning <br><br>It's just used to anything heavier than mlp by now. If a character gets a nosebleed, you can expect a kid to cry about how eddie it is.</br></br></br></br>  is this edgy enough for you? i mean his name is edge. im sure he is a bit edgy. i heard he watches anime too. His favourite is sasuke  <br>damm forget the pic</br>  <br> I've been here for awhile, and we've always used emoticons. R-right guys....... ? </br>  bump  <br>Yeah, Sorry.</br>  <br> It was thanks to Guts being autistic and abandoning Griffith in his hour of need <br><br> Griffith hour of need was long done, all he had to do is bid his time, charm the princess, marry her and be king.<br><br> Grifith had already killed anyone who could stand in his way with the help of guts, from this point on, guts could do nothing more for him.<br><br> Griffit destroyed his own dream by himself, he had already won the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is this from?<br>Can't find it.</br></br>  <br><br>QFT<br><br>Griffith was just being whiny little bitch. He may have ascended into godhood, but he'll never not be a bitch ass nigga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  guts was born under his dead hanged mom surrounded by her blood. <br>  his adopted father sold him off to get raped <br>  his father tried to kill him <br>  killed his father <br>  lived as a mercenary as a child haunted by nightmares <br>  saw all his comrades dead surrounded by their blood with the exception of 2 <br>  his best friend literally fucked the girl who was dear to him and sold out all his comrades <br>  has to fight demons every fucking day with no good sleep because of the seal his shitty friend placed on him <br>  later finds out his shitty friend made a new army under the same name <br><br>I mean Griffith went through shit but if you say he had it worse than Guts than you're just spewing bullshit. Plus if Griffith didn't fuck the princess out of frustration he wouldn't have been tortured in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit I meant to quote this for here</br></br>  <br> implying history can't be edgy </br>  <br>He's a better person than Femto for sure.</br>  <br>Edgy isn't really defined anyway but completely subjective. Sometimes I wish Bastard would take itself more seriously in some scenes, it has a really weird mix of grimdark gore and comedy elements like pic related.</br>  <br> tfw you are two poor to have pockets so you just shove em' into your pants. </br>  <br>Must be Fourteen/Chicken George</br>  <br>Holy shit, that is awful to look at.</br>  <br>I am probably going to regret looking it up but what is that from?</br>  <br>Definitely not enough sfx in there, needs more.</br>  Does this guy get evil now that he's a lich? He's not going to be running around saving people, r-right? <br><br>Because that's not what I'm signing up for.</br></br>  <br>He created the crack on Nigan's empty crystal just for the purpose of showing that he had to use the trump card to defeat the vampire.<br><br>He merely showed another crystal from his own collection that had suitable tier magic to fool the witnesses.<br><br>Since Nigan's crystal was empty and they wouldn't be able to confirm it anyway. If the crystals are all identical looking anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah he just had backup item to prevent from his team getting blown the fuck out.</br>    <br>Only momo gets monologues in the anime.</br>  <br>There was some major trolling going on that episode.</br>  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  <br>I've always wanted Killer Queen just because it had cat ears. I just want to touch them.</br>  made in heaven  <br>Cheap Trick</br>  Supa Hot Fire  Foul feats fulfilled at a bargain  <br>Za Warudo or Emperor - both those are baller as fuck</br>  <br>Isn't Emperor essentially just a gun.</br>  <br> Improves user's reflexes and reactions <br> stealth weapon, can summon whenever <br> HOMING. BULLETS. <br>Yeah, but it'll still be a great stand for general life and i wonder if you could ever learn double up and dual wield</br></br></br></br>   not wanting Death 13 <br>do you even lali ho?</br>  <br>I want MILF hunter Kekyoin as my stando</br>  Catch the Rainbow. It wouldn't be the most useful stand, but it'd be the one that would give me the most fun.  I think heaven's door would be awesome because you could just go around reading about peoples lives and shit. Also being able to force people's will by writing rules on them is so powerful.  <br>Uncleanly doings made cheaply</br>  <br><br>Hard to say, but Heaven's Door is fucking OP.</br></br>  Schlong Slinger  Easily Star Platinum<br>Stronk as fuck and I would be able to draw so well I wouldn't need the manga aspect of Heavens Door. Plus time stop and I'm basically set, plus all the plot armor. Second would be Tusk because it just seems like a neat stand</br>  Id need a straight forward powerful one like star platinum or something, im not clever like a jojo character so i couldnt make the weaker ones work. And its important to be blatantly overpowered because stand users being drawn to eachother means id have to encounter some of you faggots.  Mandom.<br><br>There are so many applications of reversing 6 seconds in my life. Cheating the fuck out of RNG is the main one.<br><br>I don't need some bulletproof iron-wrenching punch ghost. I need the ability to undo my mistakes.</br></br></br></br>  Strength.<br><br>I've always wanted a boat.</br></br>  <br>If /a/nons with stands often encountered each other do you think we'd fight? I'm pretty sure we'd just wank to the fact we have stands</br>  <br>That hair looks really out of place, it really looks flat as fuck compared to everything else.</br>  "Razzmatazz"<br>It'd literally be the soul of Frank Sinatra</br>  <br>It'd be the scene where Polnareff and Kakyoin do the secret handshake, only stretched out over our entire meeting.<br><br>I'm absolutely sure you faggots would fight eachother though, just to jerk over the fact that you can. And of course there's be that one guy who had to make everyone his fuckboys.</br></br></br>  <br>i forgot the ability again, freezing raindrops midair and walking on them right?</br>  So who was stronger SP or the world? Dio did punch through SP's attacks but was he just lucky? Yes SP ultimately did kill the world but that's because Dio was already hurt  <br>I'd be friends with you anon. We could fight all the fuck boys together, because be honest, some fighting with your SUTANDO POWA does seem cool. <br>On some basic stuff what would people use their stand the most for? I'd probably  use the stand to get the remote and get me a drink <br><br>Yeah<br><br>They seem about equal, I'd say SP is stronger just due to the compensation for it's range while The World has a much larger range in comparison</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Run the Jewels<br><br>Ability to move at a fast acceleration, hide and store objects</br></br>  <br>I like the reference <br>I'd do King Krule <br>When it hits someone they experience their worst experiences and or feel an extremely heavy drug trip, of course with the ability to weaken said trips</br></br></br>  <br>If I had time stop or whatever, lewd shit, for sure. Or I'd use it to get myself some easy cash and live the good life. I'd basically go full NEET like DIO did.</br>  Heaven's Door or maybe Diver Down they both seem pretty cool. I wouldn't want a combat stand, because it seems really fucking useless.  <br>But anon, that's unjust. I would do the lewd though. Would sign up for those "Strongest man" tv shows and use SP to lift</br>  <br>I'd say what really makes a difference between SP and the world is the users. Dio being a vampire gives him a much longer time stop duration, but I think jotaro's wits makes him and his SP stronger in the end.</br>  <br>It fits well after affect should be insomnia</br>  <br>I was thinking of that, but also an effect on the user from over use would be insomnia.  I want to write a JoJo knock off with all the potential music references I know Araki doesn't listen to. </br>  Crazy Diamond for sure. Just seems to match my personality  <br>a stand who make you poop in your pants until you die of malnutrition.<br><br>I called it The Final Countdown.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably grab Jailhouse Rock, just because it's the stand I personally fear the most by far, and it'd make me feel a lot more comfortable knowing 'I' was the one with control of that stand.<br><br>I'd rather fight Dio 1v1 without a stand of my own (Die.) than face Jailhouse Rock.<br><br>I'd rather die than live the rest of my life with fucking alzheimers.</br></br></br></br></br>  My stand would be called anal cunt. He would show up, shut on the ground, call me gay, then leave  <br>as someone who works with alzheimers patients for research, after all i've seen, if I developed it later on in life I would most likely off myself, because we are not gunna have a cure by the time I'm 60-70</br>  <br>So the spirit and stand of /a/?</br>  <br>I haven't read through it in a while but watching the anime recently It looked like SP did the killing punch on the same spot on The world as where Dio had his legs fucked up moments before. I was assuming it was Dios arrogant personality attacking with his injured body that got him killed.</br>  <br>Yaaaaooooooo, I volunteered at a nursing home for a summer, that's how I learned I'd fucking end my life if I ended up like that too.<br><br>Well, I would if I could even remember that I wanted to die.<br><br>Just gotta make some suicide pacts I guess...<br><br>You know you have a friend when they'll visit you while you're sick. You know you have a best friend when they'll put a bullet in your fucking brain when you won't get better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  you are now imagining all of bizarre adventure being told as a re-cap by some guy with a Brooklyn accent  <br>now listen here u lil shit</br>  So, was Vanilla Ice a true vampire or a zombie? I thought you could only become a vampire via Stone Mask shenanigans, but the people Dio Brando turned into zombies generally looked all grey and weird.  <br>The zombies looked strange and gray, and Vanilla Ice didn't, I mean.</br>  <br><br>It's easy to say this when we have recollection of memory, but as I see it, if you can't remember the horror of the condition, there is no longer any horror to it. Now I don't know how they see it, so my view might be simplistic philosophical bs.</br></br>  <br>Highway Star</br>  <br> once i marry and have children im going to put it in my will </br>  <br><br>it's been a while since I saw the fight but I don't remember vanilla ice regenerating at all during the fight so he might as well have been a zombie right? I get what you mean about the look but I don't think we have enough references other than the abomination zombies to say what they had to look like.</br></br>  <br> If you could choose your own stand what would it be? <br><br>A gay one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why the condition creeps me out so much on a deep existential level.<br><br><br> Good idea, I'll do the same. Fuck that noise. </br></br></br></br>  <br>done</br>  Floral Shoppe<br><br>Power E<br>Precision D<br>Speed C<br>Range C<br>Durability C<br>Potential B<br><br>The stand itself manifests itself as a pink fog that can quickly surround objects.<br><br>Objects covered in the gas cannot exert a presence on anything outside its range. For example, covering a police car in the fog means that people won't be able to see or hear it or the noise the sirens make and a person walking into the fog will simply pass the car and end up on the other side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And breaking your body down to follow raindrops, like he did by sending his jaw down with a drop and biting Johnny's shoulder IIRC.</br>  "Teen Spirit"<br><br>My stand would have a ghost like physical appearance and my powers only work on people the ages of 13-19. My "teen spirit" stand has the ability to poses any teenagers body and take over full control of their consciousness.<br><br> I will only use this stand to do lewd stuff with teenage girls. This stand will most likely not be suitable for combat situations unless I'm fighting another stand user who is in the teenage age bracket and then I could just command them to kill themselves. </br></br></br></br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>As a philosophy  minor  it doesn't scare me within my perspective, however if I do know of my condition and could remember how I can't remember shit then yeah, I'll probably be inclined to do something rash. I might as well put it in my will too, thanks for thought to.</br>  <br>that feels like a stand that would be overpowered if araki put it in the series.</br>  <br>Should be called Smells like Teen Spirit.  The aftereffect of the stand is that if used for too long the teenager has an increase in suicidal thought, so if used for stuff like interrogation you'd have to time it wisely and not over use it. Also since it is "teen spirit" maybe if said teenager has a stand you can make use of their stand as well </br>  <br>Lol, Philosophy. What a waste of college money, why don't you get a real degree like  Sociology with a minor in Anthropology, for the love of God end my life plz. </br>  <br> I'm majoring in Anthropology mate, I just plan on doing med school after </br>  <br>In my country you can apply for self-termination. Just fill in the paperwork and pick out a date and a doctor will be dispatched to your location with a syringe.<br>No need to wait for a slow, agonizing death. Time is money wasted.</br></br>  I was re-watching a few episodes of stardust crusaders and for all the crap ive heard about part 3 no one ever talks about the 4th wall being broken during wheel of fortune. <br>this scene made me laugh so hard. too bad this is probably the only instance of it in part 3 or any other part.</br>  <br>If you can choose then why not choose the most broken Stand?</br>  <br>That isn't Heaven's Door or Hey Ya.</br>  <br>I don't know anon, Gold exerience requiem is pretty bullshit. I mean I know the translation for part 5 is ass, but from what I could tell it basically negated king crimsons power and said "fuck you" over and over again.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool dude. I thought about going into forensic anthropology so I could be a fucking coroner (People keep telling me that's creepy as fuck, but I just remember being fascinated when I dissected shit back in the day.), but I'm starting to think I'll just do some social work and then go into law later.<br><br>That, or maybe join the army as an officer and try to get a civil affairs position where I can oversee our relations with some foreign country somewhere. I got a 97 on my ASVAB (A 96 is required.), so that means I can definitely do it.<br><br>I wanna hold off on making those decisions until later on though, for now I'm happy being a broke college student fucking around on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  Expectations for EoH? After seeing N'Doul play out, I'm hoping for more gimmicky characters like Mountain Tim.  <br>fuck man N'doul is gonna b everyones partner come full game hes just the best support</br>  C-moon. <br>It would be cool to be able to float around and if I feel like it I could go to Florida and reset the universe in whatever way I want.</br>  <br> Time in a bottle <br><br>The ability to reverse time by 30 seconds with only its effects being known to the user. I would only use it for gambling (Roulette/Craps) and wouldn't bother doing stand fights or anything badass. Just doing some gambling to make enough money to live the way that I want to.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just a stronger Mandom.</br>  <br> I want Ringo Roadagain's stand Mandom except better in every way. <br>There's gotta be a downside Anon, like you have to age a month every time you do it, and it makes your hair and fingernails grow a month too.</br></br>  Pet shop's stand.  <br>me too dude</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty crappy stand, not gonna lie.<br><br>Iggy managed to beat it, and his stand was probably worse than Hermit Purple.</br></br></br>  King Crimsom would be the best for trolling.  What's her disability?

The editing seemed awkward at points and the transitions from scene to scene didn't feel quite as natural as the second--or even first--episode. Kinda felt disappointed with how they handled pic related as well, I expected something with a bit more impact considering Ohta's usual hyper-expressive output (him sharing the storyboard with another guy might explain the unevenness). Still quite decent though, can't wait for Sylphyn's episode.</br>  <br>I want to  brush the shit  out of her  hair .</br>  <br><br>That looks satisfying.</br></br>  no yuri they said, hetfags on sucide watch    <br> hetfags on suicide watch <br><br>Not while Ebina is around</br></br></br>  <br>nobody cares about sluts</br>  I don't know Japanese, but Sylphin's voice sounds a bit different from normal to me.

Will we get to the dark plot and reveal that Umaru is not Onii-chan`s real sister, existence of real Umaru and plot of DOMO corporation?  <br>Umaru is actually a fat old man in a skinsuit who impersonates imoutos to scam people.</br>  <br>With Dogakobo slicing up the plot like salami, I'm not sure.</br>  <br>Hey buddy, we're talking about the manga.</br>  So now does Kirie end up as parazite in Onii-chan`s household too? Episode even ends with her dining with them at night as if she belongs there and its her house.  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br><br>haha, what the fuck</br></br>  <br> Episode even ends with her dining with them at night as if she belongs there and its her house <br>That's because the anime skipped quite a few of manga chapters. Kirie actually hung out with Umaru and Onii-chan for some time before started having dinner there.</br></br>  <br>Such is life as a YJ adaptation.</br>  What's this show's native resolution?  Sylphy best girl.  I want to protect this smile  I LOVEEEEEEEEE YOUUUUUUUU JESUSSSSSSSS CHRISTTT  <br>They are rearranging chapters to introduce characters faster, we likely to see lot of skits from "skipped" chapters, so current episodes dont tell anything about the pace.

Taihei was the cause of the accident, and because of it he was disowned by his father. Taihei really blames himself for it too, and because of how much he loves his mother and the trauma of being the cause of her death, he blots out his past and just lives for his dead-end job. Umaru becomes lonely living alone with her father who starts abusing her because of how much she reminds him of her mother, so she runs away and goes to live with Taihei. Because of what is essentially a second chance to be with his beloved mother, Taihei thus devotes all his time and energy to making Umaru happy. And Umaru escapes from the weight of the abuse she has suffered by drowning it in the noise of games and anime and whatever. She puts on a persona outside because she doesn't even want to acknowledge that something inside is broken, let alone show that to other people.</br>  <br> I'm not a Kiriefag </br>  <br>O-oh.<br><br>That's really sad.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you a strong enough swimmer to save her?</br>  <br>People are dangerous when they are drowning. <br><br>Be careful</br></br></br>     Drama in SoL comedy <br>That's not it works, it's just a misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Don't forget the possibility of Taihei actually being adopted, their father marrying again to produce another more dependable heir for the corporation (ie. moonUmaru),  and the inevitable reveal the Kanau wasn't really in love with Taihei as she was just acting under their father's commands. </br>  <br>Don't worry, tits are floatation devices.</br>  <br><br><br>/a/ please.<br><br>Fucking please.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow that's edgy!</br>  <br>My money is on Kanau only initially being forced to be with Taihei, and she genuinely fell for him in time. And then Taihei stopped being a viable option to strengthen their company, but she is still in love with Taihei and fights nail and tooth to refuse all the arranged marriages. Her father punishes him and tries to break her resistance by placing her in the stressful position of being a boss at such a young age, not even knowing that her love for Taihei only grows stronger because the fact that Taihei is one of the people she is in charge of manages to slip right under his nose.</br>  <br> Her father punishes him <br>Punishes her, I mean.</br></br>  You come home after a long day of work and find your shitty himouto like this.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br>Spoil her with a nice fresh helping of protein. She doesn't even need to wake up, I'll pour it down for her.</br>  <br><br>I think Onii-chan really is adopted. Or at least there's the chance of them being half siblings.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck. Good idea.</br>   people actually think that Kirie and Alex will ever be a thing <br><br>It's incredibly obvious that Kanou is trying to set him up with Umaru, so that she can have Taihei all to herself.</br></br>  <br><br>Just think of that trippy chapter where gets lost, though. At this point it wouldn't surprise me, this shit always had some stuff that seemed to just lurk in the background.  Although really, I'm just having fun making retarded speculations. </br></br>  <br>Damn imouto, using the hamster to protect herself.<br>I guess I'll have to get creative.</br></br>  How come the lesbo didn't noticed she was Umaru? She really turn into a chibi??  <br>Because anniemay</br>  <br>What do you mean Umaru? She clearly said that she was Umaru's little sister, Komaru.</br>  What is with pleasantly comfy SoLs and the fact they always have that 'under the skin' drama that gets barely brought up and only hinted at every god knows how many chapters?  mods i better not be banned  Does anyone ever find out that Umaru is a horrible person?    <br>It's much more interesting that way.</br>  <br>You mean like when a character doesnt exist?</br>  <br>They hit you harder.</br>  <br><br>wait<br><br>what<br><br>this is all bullshit, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes. <br> No. </br></br>  does Umaru even wash her hamster coat thing?  <br>No.<br> Taihei does it for her. <br> She has at least five copies of it. </br></br></br>  <br> five </br>  <br>Or when everyone was actually dead from the start?</br>  <br>I said at least.</br>  <br>pls</br>  <br><br>Stop it.</br></br>  <br>Pic related<br>Sylphyn's mouth</br></br>    Kirie reminds me of a cross between Hitoha (Mitsudomoe) and Tomoko (Watamote), but more overloaded with cuteness. Still, I prefer Ebina by a long shot. Beach episode when?  <br>Insecure people who can't just accept light-hearted entertainment for what it is and have to try and shoehorn in something "deep" and "dark" to try and feel smart and mature.</br>    I want to buy her all the food she could ever eat.<br>And then marry her.</br>      Who is this kanau person?      <br>Ribonless Chiyo.</br>  That's it for now.  Let's try to make Umaru more realistic.  Ebina is literally the only reason to keep watching this shit.  <br>Why did you post a picture of Ebina then?</br>    <br><br>needs more kidney failure and rotten teeth</br></br>  Would it be possible to steam rice on Ebina's head?   people actually like Ebina <br><br>She's a useless, fat, dumb slut with no personality. Worst girl by far.<br><br>Umaru at least knows how to have fun.<br>Kirie at least has aspirations and talents.<br>Sylphin is Umaru if she was actually good.<br>Ebina just wants to eat all day like the pig she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's a useless, fat, dumb slut with no personality. <br><br>It's no wonder you hate her if you somehow see her as a mirror version of yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>I swear to God, I will fucking fight you.</br>  <br>She's a completely one dimensional character defined solely by always being hungry.<br><br>For fuck's sake, she's worse than your generic shonen protagonist - at least they also have the added element of being hot blooded.</br></br></br>  <br>That anon wished that he could be a slut.</br>  <br>he has long face</br>  <br>Eh, she still has a cute face.</br>  <br>Also Umaru is the most useless girl by far. She's just a burden on her brother and she lies to her friends like a cunt. <br><br>Ebina is super kind and she's just shy. <br><br><br> defined solely by always being hungry. <br>If anything, she's more defined by her shyness and feelings towards KC-kun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are these plot twists canon confirmed? These seem so freaking likely.</br></br>  <br>No, and neither of them are likely at all.</br>  Also Ebina's butt is big and would be MUCH better a place to catch your breath after running a marathon than any of the other girls' butts would be. This is objective, irrefutable fact. <br><br><br>They aren't likely at all, you fucking idiot.</br></br></br>  How would you propose to Ebina?  <br>With a hamburger</br>  <br>With lots of cake and other good food.</br>  <br>Are you pssibly cuntkiller-kun?</br>   Ebina   <br> those eyebrows <br>Sure way to identify her onii-chan.</br></br>    Ebina is a very healthy girl.  You don't know me  <br>ebinachang...</br>  <br>Yeah, sure.<br> Yotsuba is an alien born from female astronaut that died from childbirth in space after strange light phenomenon happened with ISS. NASA after initial years of observation and experimentation, sent her with head researcher acting as her father to Japan - to try to raise as a intellegent communicative being in normal environment to establish species contact.<br><br>Both her father, Jumbo and other friend work for NASA. Father spending days writing back reports. Yotsuba has no memories of her alien origin, but genetic memory of location of the star she is from.</br></br> </br></br>  <br>The grimdarm Interpretation - bullshit.<br>The facts of manga having the actual drama subplot involving Taihei`s mother past, DOMO corporation, Umaru`s reason for being there etc. - is actually true, also the plot is not far enougth yet to reveal all cards so people speculate.</br></br>  <br>so is she supposed to be a lesbian or</br>  <br>Do we have stats yet? I need the stats.</br>  <br>no, actually, her schtick is being a normal heterosexual girl that is secretly an otaku slob.</br>  How is she so perfect?  I will be mad if they don't go back to the skipped chapters after introducing all the girls.  <br>not Umaru i mean the bitch that's like obsessed blushing over her</br>  <br>That's retarded.

Now get the rest of them.</br>  <br>There are a large amount of images on mfc for you to look at to see for yourself.</br>  <br>But Hibari, Katsuragi, and Yagyuu are shit.<br><br>I'd literally want everone else in the series except those 3.</br></br></br>  <br>I would, but I can't. That pose isn't fitting for her at all. Good figures of them in their Shinobi outfits are too much to ask for.</br>  <br>Who is this figure based on? Looks pretty neat.</br>  <br>yeah but I’m not totally sure, what do you think?</br>  <br><br>I have it. I love it really.

Based Japan with good taste.</br>  <br>I love katsuragi but almost all her figs are shit.</br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>Looks legit to me. The bootlegs for this one seemed rather sloppy. Where did you get her from?</br>  This is not a GK. Original character made by Q-six.  <br>Jesus fuck. Please provide pics of your collection.</br>  <br> Yumifags <br>Yeah you and Japan sure showed me.</br></br>  Based off of this art. I hope they can pull it off. This might be exciting for the anons who were upset about Lala not having pubic hair.  Anyone have Cu-Poche? I really loved the episode that featured the four torpedoe girls. Plus the tickling of akatsuki's tummy is one of my favorite memes.  <br>from the seller. thanks I’ll check it more carefully. <br><br><br>fuck, even the hikage fig isn't that good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is she holding a long turd in her hand</br>  I want to make this piggy squeal.  <br>Who's this</br>  <br>Is that Hibiki nendo out yet?</br>  <br><br>Looks super cute, especially that face, but I'm not terribly thrilled about the pubes. Def won't even consider it if those are actually included.</br></br>  Big spenders, how old are you?  <br>For a while now, yes.</br>  <br> fuck, even the hikage fig isn't that good. <br>Really none of them are. I did get that Hikage by Milestone since she's my favorite and she probably wouldn't get another figure. Turned out alright to me. I also have the Phat Kat. Quality wise the Alter Asuka is the best but fuck that pose.<br><br>Then there's<br> everything else is Griffon <br><br>At least I have my petits.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>turkey-sensei</br>  <br>Do you even know how tits work?<br>When you raise your arms they do that kinda thing</br></br>  <br>18</br>  <br><br>She honestly look like shit, and I'm a Hibiki fag.<br><br>I'll wait for the QuesQ one.</br></br></br></br>  A bunch of amiami merchandise will be available at wonfes and some should be up on their site.<br><br>http://amiamiblog.com/amiamiblog/20<wbr>15/7/22/o98vky7n8xf3df9hmunzuoxg1kj<wbr>m3x</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>What are these called again?

Well, the Australian government thinks we're not paying enough for imported goods despite our garbage exchange rate so now we get to pay GST on them. I've heard some websites will lower the cost of the package so you can dodge this jewery, which ones are they? I know Amiami doesn't but what about others?  <br>I need to find nicer backgrounds around my house.</br>  <br>I like to move some of the lewder ones onto my desk while I fap. <br><br><br>The guide has them marked. Mandarake has had a recent policy change so each store is now different. There were a few posts in the archive about how requests for undervaluing went with each store. Search for individual mandarake store names and it should come up.<br><br><br>I love this photo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope this is painted by this WonFes, it's been a damn year  <br>Certain mandarake stores. Check the archives which. I just transacted with toycoin.sg and they're fine with it but you need to talk to them by email.</br>  <br>Some people will jack off to anything, what a dumb question.</br>  <br> so now we get to pay GST on them. <br>I remember hearing about this when your budget came out but I can't actually find anything about it except about GST on digital goods and services.<br><br>Don't you still have that $1000 limit for parcels?</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/ne<wbr>ws/nsw/gst-deal-state-premiers-agre<wbr>e-to-charge-gst-on-overseas-online-<wbr>shopping-purchases-under-1000/story<wbr>-fni0cx12-1227453472235</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Looks like I'll have to buy preglued from now on.

So nothing's actually happened yet?</br>  <br><br><br>I've done it 6 or 7 times already and got this</br></br></br>  <br>I get the urge to but I haven't done it yet. I always feel regret after Cumming to any sort of porn</br>  <br>They've talked about it before but haven't done anything, but it seems like they're serious this time considering what a big conference it was. When it comes in is a different story, might not be for years.</br>  <br>Interesting. I might try my luck for a third time then.</br>  <br> I always feel regret  <br>So did I, when I was fucking 10.<br>How the hell can that persist?</br></br></br>  <br>I have a few and they are cute figures, I understand that some anons don't like them, but then again there are people thatt don't like SD/Chibi proportions</br>  <br>Maybe it's that nagging voice in my head telling me I'm a virgin loser with no friends or family</br>  <br>What happened to your family?</br>  <br>That happens to me but when it's something truly morally questioning. Other than that, no.</br>  <br>Jesus fuckin christ anon</br>    <br>I estimate about $3500, with about $2500 of current preorders.</br>  <br>They're too "skinny" for me. Also hands/feet are too big.</br>  <br>They've already done feasibility studies on it before and found that collecting the tax would cost more money than it would make. That's the entire reason the threshold is there.</br>  <br>this is not the place for that shit go to /jp/ if you plan to blog about that.</br>  Around $500. Not bad.  <br>They have the proportions of a toddler so they are accurate IMO</br>  amiami please give me my invoice already  <br>About $3,000</br>  <br>Satsuki.<br><br>That's not happening though.</br></br></br>  <br>Amicos waifu.</br>  <br>But they are sisters. <br><br><br>Why not?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The eyelashes are a bit dull, if that's what you mean. They contrast well with her pale colors and allow her bold red/orange eyes to stand out more.</br>  <br>Sibling love is the purest.</br>  <br>I think it depends on how much you have ordered in the past though, I guess they wouldnt easily ban a good customer</br>  Anyone know how to get items from P-Bandai if I live in Australia?<br><br>They announced a new Digivice on it and I want to actually get it this time.</br></br>  <br>Only when it's oneechan and little brother.</br>  HOW DO I GET AUTOGRAPHS OF DOUJIN ARTISTS? MAINLY YUZUKI N'.  <br>Proxy. P-Bandai don't like gaijin dorra.</br>  Instant pre-order.  <br>ewwww</br>  I think that everyone will want to see this. A huge amount of scales have been announced. I think that I will be getting all of them.<br>http://www.cygames.co.jp/figure/</br>  <br>Speaking of autographs, who would you buyfags like an autograph from?<br><br>I'd probably pay more than i should for a HanaKana and Fatalpulse autograph</br></br></br>  <br>Whenever I read doujin I get embarrassed seeing mai waifu in such lewd states of undress and stop reading.<br><br> I have no idea why I'm posting something so off topic </br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh fuck yes.</br></br>  <br> http://www.cygames.co.jp/figure/ <br> Koto vampire loli <br>preordered</br></br></br>  <br> All of them <br>Th-that's like over $1000</br></br>  <br>I'm helping with Yuzuki N's table in C88. <br><br>I can get you an autograph, if you can guess my given name and send me email. <br><br>[firstname].tachibana@excite.co.jp</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Going to have to reduce my diet to noodles starting from now on.</br>  <br><br>If anyone happens to know a good proxy to use, please suggest it. Otherwise I'm just going to try Rinkya or something.</br></br>  <br><br>Why do these look like the come pre-glazed?</br></br>  <br>Why do you have to be so cruel anon?</br>  <br> Why not? <br>Because the series has ended a long while ago. I know they recently put Mako up for preorder but I highly doubt we'll get anything else after that.</br></br>  <br>Already got most of the autographs I want, but I'd love to get HanaKana, Araki, shibafu and Miyuki Sawashiro autographs</br>  <br>2 years is not a long time.</br>  <br>How does Koto compare to Alter?</br>  <br> Reading doujins with you're waifu in them <br>There's your problem. That's like a normalfag watching a porno starring his girlfriend.</br></br>  <br>Source</br>  <br> 2 girl 1 cup </br>  <br> not just self inserting </br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>Koto is generally above average. But with the amount of figures they pump out they have a wide range of variance and fucked things up while also producing some amazing gems. Their Dark Angel Olivia is one such gem so I have high hopes for everything they are making for cygames.<br><br>Alter is consistently top-notch. What you see in their promo pics is generally what you can expect to get. Their quality control is also better than Koto.<br><br><br>Looks like that was from skytube's twitter post. MFC usually has it a couple minutes later if you are too lazy to look for who to follow. http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>les.php?user=hIE&amp;page=pictures&amp;sort<wbr>=date&amp;order=desc&amp;cid=0&amp;aid=-1&amp;nsfw=<wbr>-1&amp;p=1</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if it's a lesbian porno?</br>  <br> Forte the Devoted <br><br>My dick.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon. I'm really hoping the other Koto Bahamut stuff are Olivia-tier.</br>  <br>Chiwa Saitou. <br><br>Kinda pissed I couldn't get Ayako Kawasumi at AX.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit, that makes a lot of sense and is probably the problem. I guess I'll try giving doujin another shot then.</br>  <br>How the fuck do they do Granblue figures and not do Danua?<br><br>It's like they hate money</br></br></br>  <br>Google image didn't find anything, but thanks. Found it</br>  <br>Sugina Miki<br>Misaki Kurehito<br>Happoubi Jin<br>RAITA<br>Mitarashi Kousei<br>LilyLilyRose (I'd love to hang out with him too he looks like the biggest bro)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to get my Etotama blurays signed by the voice actors. I should have gone to AX to meet Hanamori Yumiri. She also played Chiaya from Rolling Girls which is another show I loved.</br>  I'm a regular buyfag but I want to preorder this fig for a friend of mine as a gift. I never played awakening and I'm wondering why there is the random breast plate just there? If it had anything to do with the game or if it was just a design choice thing.  <br>She's a part of the itty bitty titty bitch squad and she wears a breastplate that makes her tits look bigger than they actually are.</br>  <br>How did you find a friend?</br>  <br>She usually wears it. There's no particular reason she isn't in the figure, but whatever.</br>  <br>Like  said it's her breastplate, not really sure why it's hanging on that rock that looks like a pegasus wing from the game.</br>  <br>Alter doing Anila huh? Might get it. Hopefully Djeeta and Caclistro will turn out alright.</br>  <br>From what I heard it's part of a DLC. She doesn't like that her breasts are small so she makes them look bigger with the chest piece.</br>  <br><br><br>Weird. I hate how aligned it is. I wish it was more tilted and natural looking if it was just supposed to be placed.</br></br></br>    <br>You think your friend is gonna put out?</br>  <br>Your explanation is the best.</br>  <br>http://granbluefantasy.jp/pages/?p=<wbr>3853<br><br>Apart from Yuel, the other girls are all more popular than Danua.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>literally all the fanart i see is Danua, maybe she's more popular with illustrators</br>  <br>Harsh and rude.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you can put it on her.</br>  <br>Part of the reason why weeaboos are so despised</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>yes, we read your post</br>  <br>she normally wears it in game, it's more just to show off her boobs. in game some supports have her talk about being embarrassed for being flat, she's just small. except for some dlc you won't even see her without armor which makes her look bigger</br>  who's going to cop?  <br>casuals most likely</br>  <br>I would if I had a use for mugs.</br>  <br>That wasn't me</br>  <br>I haven't watched the show but just looking at her pisses me off.</br>  <br>Oh, it was me after all. Apologies and carry on, chap.</br>  <br>You're a fucking fag buddy.</br>  <br>You're going to get a lot of casuals/newfags yelling at you now for not liking meme character of the season</br>  <br>I like her normal form better. Chibi a shit.</br>  <br> Dark Dragoon Forte <br>Holy shit yes.</br></br>  <br>She looks like a little shit.</br>  Any day now AmiAmi.  <br>Yes, and as a result she's fun.</br>  <br>Please no. I can't afford her til right near the end of the month.</br>  <br>I see it being released around there anyway.<br><br> You better pray to the AmiAmi gods anon </br></br></br>  <br>I'm a super serious connoisseur of anime, I only invest my time watching highly intellectual anime, anime for the thinking man you could say.

Bikini pics you say?</br>  <br> Cass <br> Nelo <br> Shurelia <br><br>What a great game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well how about these?</br></br>  <br>Get that shit out of here!</br>  Clips that make you want to watch their associated anime?  <br>This and the racing clip got me to watch it.</br>  <br>May the \K\ube be with you.</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>Ninja Cop</br>  <br>Hell policeman</br>   "Deku gets his shit reck <br> stain sets to lay the final blow on both of them <br> the best dad swoops in and teaches stain what's a true hero is (and I'm not talking about sasuke) <br> come back next weeks for the new chapter <br><br>But no seriously when can we at least expect a spoiler</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mina arc <br> before Mei arc <br>I don't think so.</br></br></br>  Needs more Mount Lady.  <br> Kaminari in retard mode <br>This guy will never catch a break won't he?</br></br>  <br> Todoroki is Endeavour's name too. <br><br> jump-netabare spoilers say Endeavour, All Might and Best Jeanist turn up.  </br></br></br>  <br>Nigga's still in his sleepin bag</br>  I know I'm late, but I just got to this scene and just wanted to show to those concerned that the best friend WINS! Its only a matter of time now before babies are made.<br><br>Also, any other genderbender/trap manga I can sink my teeth into? Boku girl will probably end soon and take its rightful place with Prunus Girl for God Tier Trap mangas.</br></br>  <br>Yes. I want to marry her.</br>  <br>Mizuki clearly hasn't gone through puberty as a guy, there's always a chance he's a late bloomer. Alternatively the entire series may have taken place in under a month so far.<br><br> Although the most likely scenario is the writer just forgot about it </br></br></br>  <br>Most manga avoid menstruation for obvious reasons and a number of genderbender manga do the same. That doesn't mean that Mizuki has no menstrual cycle.</br>  <br>It hasn't been mentioned yet. It's a rather crass and trite thing to bring up, so he may just be avoiding it entirely. Or the author may be saving that bombshell for near the end of the series when Mizuki inevitably comes to terms with things and has to make a final decision. Otherwise I doubt it will be mentioned at all, as over 5 months has passed in the series, and Mizuki is petite but certainly developed enough to have started by now.<br><br>PS: I posted about the liveTL on my site and ordered the magazine for Ch72 today. Should have it by Monday or Tuesday next week.</br></br></br>  <br> Mizuki hasn't started growing yet <br> yet </br></br>  Are they actually fucking in this?<br><br>Seems needlessly unclear</br></br>  <br>That anon wouldn't be in this thread unless they're a fujoshit too</br>  <br>I thought it was made perfectly clear that they are, indeed, fucking.</br>  <br>When? why is the boy so innocent and getting all flustered by just a kiss when the blokes probably up to his elbow in him at night time?</br>  Yes, but the writer is 50 shades tier of shitty so the uke has to pretend he hates it every time even though they've been together like 5 years now in the story.  <br>See <br>Nakamura Asumiko is probably the worst BL writer ever</br></br></blockquote>]
