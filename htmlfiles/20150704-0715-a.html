[ Finally, UBW is over. Time for this cutie to get her spotlight.  <br>What is this face supposed to convey?</br>  <br>fuck off wormslut</br>  <br>Eat the apple or I'll bath your head in my worm-can-pussy</br>  <br>Tenacity.</br>  <br>beatings, chores, rape, not completely sure I only watched Carnival Phantasm and plan to play all of the VN later this summer</br>  Rin: That's enough. This conversation is over. I can't let you get away with this. Kirei Kotomine... As the sixth head of the Tohsaka family. I will strike down the enemy of my father.<br><br>Kotomine: I can see you are not going to change your mind. I can only have one regret then, Rin. And that is that I did not get to see your face when you first heard the truth. I bet you never thought that I would send both parent and child of your family to their death. Rest in peace, as I will see your sister off, as well.</br></br>  Why is she wearing Taiga's clothes in UBW?  <br>Eat your fish, Shinji.</br>  <br>She's happy he will be able to rape her soon.</br>  <br>I'm sure most people just think of it as "Sakura's outfit" and forget the small detail of where it came from. <br>I don't think I've ever seen Taiga actually wear that outfit, even in fan art.</br></br>  Why is Sakura feeding Shinji happily?<br>He raped her.</br>  <br>Sakura enjoys being fucked by Shinji and is happy she'll get to be screwed by him again, but he'll only be able to ram his worm in her after he's feeling better, so she's trying to help.</br>  <br><br> This scene is so fucking stupid. They look like two healthy, stable and sane siblings teasing each other.<br><br>They had the chance to turn this into something really sad and depressing (but believable) by showing that just because the show ends, doesn't mean every conflict is resolved and an ending doesn't necessarily equal a happy ending for everyone. But instead they took the Disney way out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nasu wanted to make UBW stand out on its own without having to connect to Heaven's Feel. Since they went the RN route, Shinji has never actually raped her, and we know Shinji becomes a better guy after UBW.</br>  <br>Because UBW, is the Shinji/Sakura route anon. <br><br>Which at least has the benefit of having a nicer Shinji, instead of Fate where Sakura is stuck alone with grandpa Worms.</br></br></br>  <br>I dl'ed Realta Nua instead of the older version, did I make a great mistake?</br>  <br>No, if you use the right patch, you can switch between censored and uncensored stuff.</br>   Sakura gets a pseudo incest end in UBW <br><br>The route that keeps on giving.</br></br>  <br>I got the patch from Beast's Lair.</br>  <br>You're good then.</br>  <br> I only watched Carnival Phantasm <br>What the fuck? Why?</br></br>  <br>She's cute in it so I don't care.</br>  <br>LOOK AT THOSE FUCKING APPLES. LOOK HOW SHE CUT THEM. LOOK AT IT.</br>  <br> stuck alone with grandpa Worms <br>He honestly seems like the guy it would be fun to sit down and share a beer with while shooting the shit.</br></br>  <br>That apple looks like a worm.</br>  <br>Shinji never raped Sakura in Realta Nua.<br>Which is what is being adapted.<br> HF too </br></br></br>  <br>Why does she kill him in HF then?</br>  <br>better Kotonoha's patch instead of Jack's<br>Jack has the bad habit of modifying the script to fit his headcanon.<br> RN scenes are far better than the original ones.<br>Also what's being adapted</br> </br></br></br>  <br>He spoils a movie<br> Attempted murder by Shinji. </br></br>  <br><br>How do I know if I have the right one?</br></br>  <br> Jack has the bad habit of modifying the script to fit his headcanon. <br>I've seen this claim too many time, but not yet a single proof to support it.</br></br>  <br>Most famous one is changing "I know how to please a man" to "Even I know how to please a man" that he justified with Google translate.<br>At some other point there was a descriptive about Saber that was outcommented which he reimplemented.<br>I think there should be a whole list of things like that on BL somewhere</br></br></br>  <br>Where'd you download it from?</br>  <br><br>I think it was nyaa.</br></br>   Teehee that tickles, Mr. Worm!   <br>The lack of Zouken/True Assassin scenes in H/A is a crime. Their Hanafuda story makes up for it a bit at least.</br>  <br>Love anon, they love each other.</br>  <br>RN scenes are the censored versions that do change the story significantly and it's what its going to get adapted.</br>  <br><br>There is a RN version which is uncensored too.</br></br>  <br>That's a patch people made because RN is voiced unlike the original. That's why if you switch off RN once the sex scenes come in the voices will stop.</br>  <br><br>Yes, still get the sex scenes in RN at least though.</br></br>  <br>RN does change various things in HF not only the sex scenes. Sakura telling senpai her dark past in rain scene is one.</br>  <br>She needs it anon. Shinji was just being a good brother.</br>   An hour and a half for Heaven's Feelerino <br><br>It's going to be great it'll be great.</br></br>  <br>HF can't come fast enough.</br>  <br><br>I know what it changes - all I was saying is you can get the sex scenes.</br></br>  <br><br>Actually she doesn't, her capacity was so large she could handle the drain normally since mana refills over time. If she couldn't , wouldn't she have already gone crazy a long time ago? The game already says he rapes her to make her "compensate for being the heir" and for no other purpose. Plus that only started 3 years prior to the game.</br></br>  <br>She still gets horny when she is on low.</br>  <br><br>For RN, he never raped her, but he beat her a lot and essentially pretended to care about being an older brother because it gave him a feeling of superiority over her, so it's not much better.<br><br>The other guy was right about Shinji being whitewashed. It was like that in Hollow too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura doesn't mind it all the much anyways who cares. There was no rape and Shinji beatings are probably sissy as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Don't see how UBW is much better. Now she has grandpa worms, and a brother that is still a spoiled brat who'll do nothing to help her situation, but he feels better about himself<br><br>That is like saying you still are up to your eyeballs in debt, but at least your dog stopped shitting in your slippers. That silver lining is about as irrelevant as it gets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>watch Carnival Phantasm at the least</br>  <br>I did, what of it? Everything there is a joke, I hope you know this.</br>  I'll give it 2 years for one of the HF movies released.  <br>She has always had grandpa worms. The worms don't care about her all that much anymore, Zouken has alzheimers and doesn't even remember Shirou.</br>  <br>Ebin maymay. He tries to rape her for the first time, and since she's a pure virgin, she does the right thing and kills him.</br>  <br> one of <br>there's only one movie anon</br></br>  <br>I need to see the source on that friend.</br>  Does Nasu possess Unlimited Writer Works? (Urobuchi, Narita, Higashide, Sakurai, Meteo)  <br>No he has Gate of writers.</br>  I wish I hadn't read her route. I feel sorry for her arc.  <br>EAT THE FUCKING APPLE YOU BITCH NIGGA</br>  <br><br>They're apple bunnies, a common shape to cut apples into when feeding sick people.<br><br> Sakura would know about eating bunnies. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They feed on her constantly bro, and cause pain frequently.<br><br>And even if Zouken is losing his mind, it's not like that removes them or stops them from draining her and festering in her internal organs. <br><br>Not really a good thing. Also, being an experiment and having a wild mad scientist with Alzheimers sounds pretty terrible. They keep forgetting they already experimented on you, so you get more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They feed on her constantly bro, and cause pain frequently. <br>Only the crest worm which feeds on her mana and it doesn't give pain just makes her horny.<br><br> And even if Zouken is losing his mind, it's not like that removes them or stops them from draining her and festering in her internal organs. <br>No this doesn't happen, the worms won't do much if they are fed mana which she can make easily.<br><br> They keep forgetting they already experimented on you, so you get more. <br>Nah read HA.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Avenger you so crazy</br>  <br> They're apple bunnies <br>Why would she put extra effort?</br></br>  <br> Nasu has Gates of Writers <br> Takeuchi has Unlimited Maid/Saber Works <br><br>Can anyone beat them?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I only watch Carnival Phantasm <br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Who has MEoDP?</br>  <br>Is there an interview where Nasu explains this? Why does she go from barely being in the route to having an arbitrary scene with some miracle resolution if in the very next route everything is fucked?</br>  <br>The next route's shit gets fucked because of triggers triggering at the wrong time. Like Zouken seeing Shirou and remembering that he is Sakura's weakness so he uses that to get to her while the war is on and everything goes to shit.</br>  <br>HF is a BAD END that was expanded more.</br>   Censored Heaven's Feel <br>That's absolutely retarded. The sexuality in Heaven's Feel is crucial to the tone of the story.</br>  What if Gen Urobuchi and Nasu teamed up to make a  Hisui True Route  anime?  <br>I didn't mean the events that triggered HF.I was talking about how she disappears for the entire route and then comes back and she just seems happier. Like is she better, what the fuck is going on at home, what is she doing after UBW, are thing not okay and is her life still shit? What was the point of even bringing her back outside of HF?</br>  <br>Despite everything Shinji does to Sakura, deep down part of her wants for Shinji to go back to being the way he used to be in the past which is why she's happy in this ending because Shinji starts going back to how he used to be.<br><br>If you're asking why HF happens as opposed to the other routes, as a result of Shirou meeting Zouken and learning about the Einzbern name, he takes an interest in them and learns about the history and situation of the war and his father much sooner in the story and decides to take the war seriously. When he beats Shinji that night and speaks with Zouken again, Zouken realizes that he now has the triggers he needs to take action in the war.</br></br></br>  <br>She forgives him</br>  <br>Sakura NEEDS to BREED. Shinji is the only dick in town, so she has to SUCK UP to get that HOT MATOU COCK</br>  <br>Because at the end of UBW she gets mentioned in the VN?</br>  Shits going down now right?  <br>It would be great but also very sad at the same time</br>  <br>There's no resolution for her in UBW or Fate. She will keep being a magus of the Matou family.</br>  <br><br> Shinji <br> not Ayako's little brother Minori for senpai - kouhai loving <br><br>The kouhai tradition must live on. Let Minori have his senpai.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there even an interview where it's stated what Sakura is doing after anything other than HF? Or is the life of Sakura an enigma?</br>  <br>It's pretty straight forward, she keeps doing her mage training until Zouken finds her a suitable Magus to breed with.</br>  <br>I played the LN 6-8 years ago and I honestly have no idea why you asshats think it's so great, or deserves 6 different adaptions. Hell they could've animated something great like FMP, immortal regis or shit like that which would go great on tv.</br>  <br><br> to how he used to be <br><br>You mean a spoiled brat who treated his imouto like a commoner servant? They even play around with this in Hollow when the girls tell stories of their childhood with their siblings. Pretty bad.<br><br>She is just glad he chilled out, he wasn't much better as a kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>doujins confirmed for canon<br> I fucking love this doujin, one of my favorite FSN hentai by far </br></br>  <br>So, everything is not daijoubu.</br>  <br>Worms. The answer is always worms.</br>  <br><br>Nasu isn't even very clear about her abilities as a magus, and her father figure and mentor in her route and Hollow gets neither a face or lines. Not exactly using her to the best of her potential at times.<br><br>Nasu likes to keep things vague, and is sort of lazy. He got salty that Hiroyama fleshed out Luvia so much in Prisma he can barely squeeze his own stuff in now. I'm sure if someone made good side stuff with Sakura, he'd see he missed out on several opportunties.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I played the LN </br>  <br>Death, sudoku, suicide</br>  <br>Sakura was always fairly sympathetic to Shinji, she didn't completely hate him even though he was so horrible to her, she sort of saw it as partially her fault. That's why she went so nuts when she killed him in HF.</br>  <br>Waver comes back to dismantle the Greater Grail several years later, and there's a large battle about it.<br><br>But we have know info about what Zouken handles this. Thus, we have no info about what happens with Sakura either.</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to hit Shirou for leaving her and Taiga, so he can go play with some kids in the sand.</br>  <br>How's that trip to London, Shirou?</br>  <br> &gt;I'm giving birth to a bunch of worms <br><br> Mfw </br></br></br>  <br> Only the crest worm which feeds on her mana and it doesn't give pain just makes her horny. <br><br>Read HF again, there was an entire scene that shows what happens, where they sift through her muscles and choke her to fainting trying to find mana. <br><br>And Kirei even explained it is like having a crest. Except she doesn't get pain numbing medicine like Rin does.<br><br> read HA <br>I did. It's obvious whatever continuity it follows, she is free from Zouken. So of course she was able to easily put him under her thumb. She is powerful herself, and has a servant ready and waiting to eviscerate the last of the Matou males quite gladly. They'd be foolish to try messing with her. It's pretty obvious even in the joking scenes they are only alive by her good graces.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He got salty that Hiroyama fleshed out Luvia so much in Prisma he can barely squeeze his own stuff in now. <br><br>Really? Why would he give a fuck about Lluvia? She acted the same as she always does in UBW's last episode minus the ojou laugh.</br></br></br>  It is kind of scary right now.<br><br>Everyone that is involved/influences in the Ufotable HF project is hyping the shit out if right now and saying it will surpass anything else animated Fate wise.<br><br>It is hard to imagine it is happening yet I want to keep believing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It will surpass everything so hard it'll be like first Fate/Stay Night anime.</br>  <br>Why would anyone one choose to be a superhero when they could just be her hero?</br>  <br>When put in the ring 1 vs. 1 against wanting to be a seigi no mikata, Sakura has a 100% win ratio.</br>  <br>Those who believe will only be betrayed at the end.<br><br>You know this to be true, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep your expectations high for everything in life, so when they're met you can feel a sense of superiority over doubters.</br>  <br> 100% win ratio <br>Nah that's why MoS and Rider killing Shirou exists.</br></br>  <br> Ufotable HF project is hyping the shit out if right now and saying it will surpass anything else animated Fate wise. <br>Who said this?</br></br>  I wasn't much of a Sakura person before UBW but Ufotable made her so adorable that I just want to protect her.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/20<wbr>15/jun/27/fire-injures-200-people-p<wbr>arty-taiwan-water-park<br><br>Didn't know that the Grail War happened in taiwan</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br><br>Is that pic from the rumored test of courage chapter?<br><br>But Sakura loves ghost/horror stories, she should be laughing while Shirou is jumping at everything.<br><br>Still, Shirou upholding his pride as a senpai is kakkoi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bad ends <br>That's like going down the wrong street and having to turn around to get back to the right road. I'm talking true ends mate.</br></br>  <br>They talked a little bit about it in TM Ace and said they are aiming to make it perfect and surpass expectations.</br>  <br>Bad ends are canon mate.</br>  <br> true ends <br> nasuverse </br></br>  <br>Are you talking about the wrong bait translation that OP made?</br>  <br>It was an opportunity to cling all over senpai. When you unlock the test of courage event you have to take advantage of it.</br>  <br><br>It's is kind of disheartening for him as was writer I guess. He might have had a lot of development for Luvia, but now Prisma will be strongest in people's mind.<br><br>It's his own fault, but I can see how he feels.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2017 at the earliest</br>  <br>Pretty sure it was just attempted murder, not rape.<br> read the fucking spoiler </br></br>  Does anyone kinda find it disturbing that Shinji is into imouto porn? So disturbing that Shirou sold him out on that one.  <br>It was attempted rape.</br>  <br>Onee-san porn</br>  <br>Interactive reading counts as far I'm concerned as playing.</br>  <br>but it makes sense</br>  <br>Sakura strong</br>  <br>She would be if she could proper wield imouto power. Rin would be putty if she could.</br>  <br> LN <br> played <br>I'm not sure if you're registering the issue here or not.</br></br></br>  <br><br> if she could properly wield it <br> hasn't seen little sister competition in Hollow <br><br>She knows, Rin is already hers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doubt everything and never get hyped for anything, this way when the inevitable happens you won't be disappointed.</br>  Sakura-chan is such an erotic body...  Manga raws when, I want to redraw the shit out of it  <br>Ha, no. Enjoy one of the silliest scenes in the VN.<br><br> get to the scene <br> Archer and Tohsaka fighting Zouken <br> Archer cuts him and then he just walks away <br>Like what the fuck did anyone actually think he would die</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if </br>  <br>As terrible as DEEN/Stay Night was, it got a lot of us interested in playing the VN. I still remember when these were created.</br>  She always try her best to seduce her senpai through that outrageous body.  Just look at how she is always pressing up her bust.  And how she's always doing various additional things for him.  <br>My very limited knowledge of Japanese lets me recognize Senpai, and Sakura</br>  <br><br>What on earth is going on,here? Sakura looks like Rider going in for a kill. I guess there was some truth about some servants and masters having similar personality traits.</br></br>  <br><br><br> Muh doujins <br>God you're as bad as the Luviafags</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Shirou's fingers?</br>  <br>Some worm is sucking on it</br>  <br>This is lewd.<br><br><br>Sakura found Rin's weak point was being called onee-chan. Also, oddly enough Rider's plain clothes design and Sakura share a few similar sprites.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura found Rin's weak point was being called onee-chan <br><br>That's Rin's ultimate weakness? I thought it was being called a gorilla.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is performing emergency medical treatment to get her senpai's attention.<br><br>Look at the curves of that body...if every nurse was like this, we'd have no capacity left in the hospitals</br></br></br>  <br>Stop it.</br>  <br>Is Sakura route too lewd for you?</br>  <br>What other kind of imouto powers are there?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that is supposed to be set after UBW.</br>  <br> why doesn't he like me dumping an NTR doujin while roleplaying <br>Go back to whatever shithole you crawled from</br></br>  <br>It's Vanilla since this is Sakura thread, not Rin thread.</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>only plebs hate Sakura<br>she's basically Cinderella, but with more rape</br></br>  <br>Imouto power basically has no limits but it's at it's strongest when the imouto or the target is threatened.</br>  Sakura just has too much seduction powers. Just look at that posture, no one other than the most powerful of semen demons can pose their body in such a way in front of their senpai.  <br>I'm not the only one who thinks Sakura's best physical trait isn't her breasts but her ass, am I? Like people/Nasu say Rin is the heroine of the ass but Sakura's wide hips and big, plump, squishy ass is more my thing. Don't get me wrong though her breasts are still 10/10.</br>  <br><br>even though I heard Heaven's Feel is the best route, i'm not looking that much forward to it because i'm not fond of Sakura....the stuff with Kirei though...that i'm looking forward too.</br></br>  <br> Like people/Nasu say Rin is the heroine of the ass but Sakura's wide hips and big, plump, squishy ass is more my thing. <br>I think you're right Anon.<br><br>Sakura is applying all the correct Semen Demon techniques and her Senpai gets a full frontal view of how wide her childbearing hips are.<br><br>It's her win tactics. Plus her blushing face, and those eyes that look like they are completely infatuated with her senpai.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer boobs, but she does have a nice ass.<br><br>As for Rin, that's all about the legs.</br></br></br>  <br>Kirei is the best part of HF by far.<br><br>The route itself drags way too much in the middle to call it best overall in my opinion, but the climax and the ending are the strongest out of all the routes. UBW has more in the way of constant action and unexpected twists.</br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of a bust, considering her onii-chan is an asshole. She's better off putting her all into kouhai appeal.</br>  <br><br>I'm a Sakura fan, and I even think that is bollocks. Out of all the great vanilla Sakura doujins, you pick that?</br></br>  <br> I prefer boobs <br>I suspect Shirou does too.<br><br>It's what works on him when he is oblivious to everything else.</br></br></br></br>   Sakura - Tits and Ass <br> Rin - ZR, Legs <br> Saber - Kinpatsu??? <br><br>Why is she the most popular girl in japan again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some kind of retard moe appeal, I think.</br>  <br>Because Saber doesn't need cheap tricks to win over Shirou, she just needs to act like herself!</br>  <br>japan has shit taste</br>  <br>Because she has a horrible personality and is completly unlikeable</br>   those hips <br><br><br>Are you saying this isn't vanilla?<br><br>There's nothing but sweet consensual sex between a semen demon and her master.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually really liked how HF was paced. It's like edging the route. Just a whole lot of build up until the climax, and in the end you're left with a really satisfied feeling. Of course, I actually really enjoy all the slice of life in Fate so yeah.</br>  <br> &gt;I actually really liked how HF was paced. <br>wow</br></br>  <br>I suspect Shirou actually likes small breasts.</br>  <br>I enjoy the SoL myself but there was just too much in the middle before before Sakura's shadow took over. That ending sure as hell made up for it though.<br><br>Fate had the best balance of all the routes in my opinion when it came to the comfy parts and the action.</br></br></br>  <br> Sakura - Tits  <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>His question was about Saber, not Rin.</br>  <br> before Sakura's shadow took over <br>Shadow?</br></br>   You will never have a waifu who constantly faint, as if she had a vibrator stirring the insides of her womb 24/7   <br>Saber's breasts fit in your hand perfectly!</br>  <br> I actually really liked how HF was paced. <br>You have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>But Shinji did care about her. <br><br>He's unlocked the pseudoincestbowl post-UBW.</br></br></br>  <br> Are you saying this isn't vanilla? <br>It's not shitposting faggot.</br></br>  <br>I guess Takeucihi mixed up Arthuria's body plan with Neros.</br>   waifu has lust in the eyes and beg for sex <br> Shirou just hugs her <br>Goddamn it Shirou...</br></br>  <br>Shirou's main want to fuck girl Rin isn't big, the girl that scarred his life Saber has small breasts, Illya gets him up too. Sakura couldn't even get him up one year and a half in, Shirou is not a big breast faggot.</br>  <br> &gt;Kirei is the best part of HF by far. <br> tfw you'll never get ham-off crossover series <br>Makes me wonder if VA masturbate to their own voices.</br></br></br>  I love this doujin so much.<br><br>They're like little kids playing doctor and nurse all over the house while parents are gone.</br></br>  How can you guys keep rewatching this shit over and over. It's the same shit every time  <br>LMFAO NO ONE EVER SAID FATE FANS WERE ESPECIALLY BRIGHT.. :)</br>  <br>thats canon though, happens in HF aswell.<br> H scence happens so often they only get a quick phase in and nothing more.  <br><br>They are fucking like retarted rabbits<br>smut inside</br></br></br></br></br>  Extra/CCC translation when?  Sex with her shirt on is my fetish.<br><br><br> not watching it for the porn <br><br><br>Sakura is a worthy rabbit demon made for breeding</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> H scence happens so often they only get a quick phase in and nothing more. <br>Sex is such a casual thing for Sakura, she has sex as much and normal human breathes air.</br></br>  Uhh, guys, I don't think they are actually having sex.<br><br>Sakura is still wearing her apron, that means they're just cooking food.</br></br>   ITT Why people dislike Sakurafags   <br> Sakura, I don't follow. What kind of meal is this? </br>  <br>I think you lost me Anon. Need further explanation.</br>  Am I the only Sakurafag that detests Illya and Rin?  <br><br>Next thing you'll say he was walking her home gently or something.<br><br>Anyway, to get away from Bait Thread #9000 and Reverse Bait Part Deux, I propose some speculation.<br><br>What type of work will Sakura and Shirou be doing together in HF True. Does she help in his training as well as recovery? They are tapped out on cash, so how would they get Shirou a new body? <br><br>Also, will they get married, or just be low key lovers. And if they do, Japanese wedding or Asian? The majority of Japanese fanart saying traditional Japanese suits them better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're never the only one</br>  <br>Screw you,anon. I wanna see all three hang out together and gang up on Shirou due to his audistic reactions. The most I got was that scene where it Rin and Sakura fuck with Shirou. in HA.</br>  <br>Sakura asks Rin to get in touch with her old men employers.</br>  <br> What type of work will Sakura and Shirou be doing together in HF True. <br>Home wife.<br> Does she help in his training as well as recovery? <br>What training? She fucks him to keep him alive so that could be his recovery.<br> They are tapped out on cash, so how would they get Shirou a new body? <br>Sakura had no interest whatsoever to get him a new body.<br> Also, will they get married <br>Of course why not? Japanese wedding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't follow. What kind of meal is this? <br>The meal was so good and fulfilling, Sakura was full even the morning after.<br><br> that belly rubbing </br></br></br></br>  <br>He truly is the winner of UBW.</br>  <br> It's not NTR :^) <br>Fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Fug</br>  <br>This isn't Saber's perspective or Rin's perspective. It's not NTR.</br>  Heaven´s Feel confirmed one movie at the FSN panel.  <br>Nice joke.</br>  <br><br>Why would it be home life stuff when she is the Supervisor and is already spreading her network in the magic world? I imagine Sakura will go out exploring once her training with Dilo is done and she knows Fuyuki is alright. She passes Supervisor duties back to Rin. I say this is in five to ten years.<br><br>Sakura wants to get a new body for him, he was the one that says it's fine when she asks.<br><br>Shirou has trained most of his life, he is unlikely to stop, his girlfriend playing to broaden her horizons in magic will make it somewhat necessary. They have Rider for protection, but Shirou is too stubborn to leave everything to her. <br><br>Another option is Shirou might become a pro bono lawyer. If Sakura goes traveling, he'll join her. Perhaps having a catering service on the road. <br><br>Ooh, Japanese wedding, good choice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is NTR you shitlord. Fucking kill yourself already.</br>  <br>I hope batcave will reappear during final fight.<br>Must stay true to the series.</br></br>  <br> when she is the Supervisor <br>She isn't<br> already spreading her network in the magic world <br>She isn't<br> I imagine Sakura will go out exploring once her training with Dilo is done and she knows Fuyuki is alright <br>Directly contradicting her established character<br> Shirou has trained most of his life, he is unlikely to stop <br>Reread HF</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's a warrior with a soft side. Even Shirou knew where the real goodness at.</br>  <br> Sakura <br> exploring anything <br>She can't explore, only get explored, if you know what I mean.</br></br></br>  <br> Is the order a rabbit? </br>  Best girl  <br>Quite so.</br>  <br>That's a hell lot of fan fiction, Sakura has never expressed the desire to go "adventuring".<br> Sakura wants to get a new body for him <br>What? Where does she state this?<br> Shirou has trained most of his life, he is unlikely to stop <br>He did it for his super hero ideal, he never liked magic.<br> If Sakura goes traveling, he'll join her. <br>She won't.<br><br>HF is pretty much the polar opposite of the Fate ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best sisters</br>  <br><br>My nigger</br></br>  <br>I agree with all this points, I think Sakura, Shirou, and Rider would be able to accomplish a hundred times more than any other route Shirou when it comes to the hero business. Like Rin said there's no way they will stay put.</br>  <br>A gentleman of fine taste.</br>  <br>Just fucking look at her and you'll understand like  does</br>  <br>And still directed by Miura too.<br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>I can't wait for her to get more art once HF comes out</br>  <br>Source?<br><br><br>Nips are mostly slenderfags like Takeuchi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So he is into failed kings?</br>  <br>Source? I can't believe this. You are full of shit.</br>  Friendly reminder that Shinji never raped Sakura. Not in RN or the original.  <br>RN or Original?</br>  <br>Best duo <br><br>Yeah, I haven't seen this confirmed anywhere. I'll trust you when I see the source.</br></br></br>  I'm at the F/SN panel at AX where Ufotable's higher ups who worked on UBW are here. I asked them how many movies Heaven's Feel will get, and they said that in the original draft it was 6 hours long.<br>However, due to Aniplex being greedy with their shekels, it'll probably be one feature length film.</br>  I'm starting up Fate/Extra for the first time.<br>Seibaclone, a man with a Raw Anus or a foxgirl?<br>I'm thinking of taking the foxgirl, but I heard she's pretty hard to play as.</br></br>  <br>Saber was quite successful actually! It was with her rule that the age of man began.</br>  <br>FSN panel at Anime Expo</br>    <br>Same here</br>  <br>Unlikely, considering he changed his priorities for Sakura. They may have advantage in having more numbers and perspectives, but they're slow, especially Sakura.<br>She's a burden. Fate or UBW Shirou are more determined, and ultimately all of them are doing it wrong.</br></br>  <br>Oh hai Zouken.</br>  <br>The only thing "hard" about her is the grinding. But they all have unique servant stories, so if you really want to play, then you can go with all of them.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I didn't know Urobuchi posted on /a/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much grinding are we talking about here?</br>  <br>Same as everyone else, only difference is she's shit in the beginning but absolutely fucking broken later.</br>  <br><br>They mentioned they were still discussing the release format as far as I know</br></br>  <br>Well I can't really say for sure, depending on how your luck is, but it's a decent chunk, that gets rather boring because of the RPS mechanic.</br>  <br>"So apparently at the anime expo Miura said although he wanted a 6 hour film (lol what) it's going to be only 1 regular length movie. Though not sure if by the latter part he meant a series of regular length movies, but the wording seemingly implied it's only one."<br><br>is what I found on BL</br></br></br>  <br>What about Seiba and Aacha?<br><br>I played through the entirety of P3 AND The Answer.<br>I enjoyed the first one. I barely got through the second one.<br>Where is Extra on the scale?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> regular length <br>How long is it?</br></br>  <br>Her voice is sex</br>  <br>RN or Original? COME ON.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>Nero's considered generally pretty easy since she's just your standard melee, but there's a bit of grinding involved. Nonetheless, Extra really isn't about gameplay, but about the stories, so just think of grinding as something that's just an annoying add-on</br>   We don't have any idea how to do HF yet. Nothing is decided, so there is nothing to talk about. But if you watched UBW, you surely would be amazed. I think we'll have to wait for another couple of years.   <br>That's a wrong translation, keep deluded.</br>  <br>The story is shit though</br>  <br>My moon isn't high tier by any means, but that doesn't seem to be the right translation.</br>  <br>Dude it's going to be RN.</br>  <br>We don't know yet. Some things imply original, others RN</br>  <br>He meant one singular regular length movie.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Well, a foxgirl it is.<br>Now I need to figure out if I should give her a lesbo lover or a husband.<br>It's a hard choice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SHUT THE FUCK UP, this shit can still be saved.</br>  <br>Probably some merge.</br>  <br> Deen 2.0 <br>God fucking dammit</br></br>  <br>Why hasn't anyone fucking asked that? Jesus fuck.</br>  <br>Some statements they made make me believe they're keeping the rape in, but they'll probably go RN for the sex scenes.</br>  <br>Because TMAce clearly shows that it's going to be RN.</br>  Is Sakura finally going to bypass Rin on the popularity polls?<br><br><br>RN isn't even that bad. The worms still happen and most things stay intact. Deal w/ it.</br></br></br>  <br>I was just told by a trusted source that it could also be a trilogy of short movies and that it hasn't been decided yet.</br>  <br>What rape? RN still has worm rape. RN took out sex scenes and Shinji rape.</br>  <br>No it doesn't fucktard that's just them selling merchandise.<br><br>No fuck you its terrible.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can you fags stop trolling?</br></br>  <br>I'm expecting them to keep the Shinji rape and go with vampire Sakura.</br>  And this is why you should never get hyped and hope for getting anything more than the barest minimum.  <br> it's terrible <br>Explain.</br></br>  <br>Well, it's certain that there is a 6 hour long draft and that they're not sure how they'll format it. The wording of what was said was kind of confusing.</br>  <br>That's fucking worse than RN are you fucking kidding me holy shit. Kill me, this is going to be worse than DEEN's movie fucking adaptation fuck.</br>  These Sakura porn needs more translations.  <br> Keep Shinki rape <br> Remove sex scenes <br>lel</br></br></br>  <br>The cutest</br>  <br>Lololol<br><br>No, there is no six hour draft. He wanted to do a six hour version but that's not going to happen.<br><br>It's not going to be a trilogy of movies. One film. That's it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Head animator is a Sakurafag. She's gonna look so good.</br>  <br> lololol <br><br>leave</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dude, did you even read the ending? Rin gave her administration over Fuyuki in that end, she found out about Rin's trial through her contacts at the Association (key point, the Supervisor regularly gives reports to the Association, this was noted in Hollow). Rin talks about Sakura spreading her network of influence.<br><br>Her established character? What, did you think she would just. Why even bother taking a mentor if she wasn't gonna use it. <br><br>She refused Rin's invitation to the Clock Tower because she already has a teacher, and work she wanted to do in Fuyuki. But Dilo is only in Fuyuki to replace Kirei temporarily. Her 'established character' does want to learn magecraft.<br><br>Like seriously, how many people have actually read HF? Hopefully they paid more attention than this guy. Sheesh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lololol </br>  I think Sakura's body is too sexual for her own good   Heavens Feel with MAGIC CREST TRANSFER <br>How is this going to be good again?</br>  <br>There was always a possibility that it was going to be one and done.

I scanned the English publication of AX a while ago, so I'll be dumping it. The editing sucks, but the selection is decent. AX is the spiritual successor to the alternative manga magazine, Garo.

Any help?</br></br>  <br>調子に乗る</br>  <br> 調子に乗る <br><br>Agh, thank you! So then the な makes it a negative command? Something like "don't get carried away"/"don't get cocky"?</br></br></br>  <br>調子に乗る = to be elated; to be excited; to be caught up in the moment; to be carried away; to get cocky<br>調子乗んなよ basically means "Don't fucking get excited". The whole sentence would mean something like:<br> Don't fucking get excited because I'm also going with you. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, don't get carried away works better on second thought.</br>  As a newcomer who has lurked in /djt/ threads for a while: would you recommend doing RTK first and then grammar + a core deck, or just disregard RTK entirely and learn kanji from vocabulary?      <br><br>Thank you! But I'm still a little confused as to how this grammar is formed. Does this "んな" contraction happen regularly with negative commands in casual speech?</br></br>  <br>ん is a (failed) contraction of る and な. You can use it with verbs that end with る (ichidan or godan)<br><br>こっち来んな！<br>さっきから蹴んな！<br><br>it does this because る tends to disappear when you say things quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In certain levels, he's not a normal part of the cast.</br>  なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

Shouldn't it be "it has rained"? Isn't 降る one of those verbs?  <br>Because it implies he's above the beginner level that's he's set with this audio, and not on mount stupid, while simultaneously putting others down for not having practiced listening. He also assumes others are bragging about their Japanese comprehension level.</br>  Is there any place where という is explained with all of its nuances?  <br>What do you mean "one of those verbs"?</br>  <br>This picture fills me with inspiration.<br>Time to do my reps.</br></br>    <br>REKT.<br/></br>  <br>That mean "has done" instead of "is doing" when they're in the ている form. Or I mean, it obviously is not. But it seems like it should. Being similar to 降りる, 上る et.c. How do you tell?</br>  <br>Because he listened and realized that he can't even understand a children's story.<br>so he's trying to tell other people that they're in the same boat as him.<br>it's a fact that what he's saying is true.<br>but he's dumb as shit for giving this much of a fuck about it. find the transcript, anon, learn what they're saying, listen again, and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 9 out of 10 retarded japanese learners <br>what an official sounding statistic</br></br>  <br>B called C and A was negatively affected by it?</br>  <br>I think he means intransitive. Where 木の枝が折れている isn't "trees branch is breaking", but "tree branch is broken, and remains in that state." <br><br>I don't know all the rules to that, or if there are any rules. Just keep in mind that ている has a few functions. <br> ing 食べている "eating" <br> continued state　結婚している "married, and still am" <br> sequence of actions for movement verbs 行っている "went, and is there now" <br><br>At least that's how I understand it. I could be wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know of a particular rule or a resource that lists them. I think you just need to read a lot and figure out which is meaning is more commonly meant.<br><br>降っている leans towards "raining" to me, but I'm not a native.</br></br></br>  <br>This is another case of people wasting their time in this thread trying to be superior to others for no good reason.<br><br>It's two things in action: The "suffering" passive, and the common construction of に電話する "To call on the telephone"<br><br> AはBにCに電話された。 <br> Cに電話された <br>C was called<br> AはBに <br>By B, to A's displeasure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Passive, causative, etc. you fucking drone.</br>  <br>This sentence really does throw me off though. A being the subject　he's the one calling C right. And B is the one making him do it?</br>  <br>That's easier.</br>  <br>ている can mean that in verbs that involve a change, and if the object is still in the final state of the change. Like 降りる means to go from somewhere high to somewhere low, in other words a change. So if the person is still in the low place after having descended, you can use ている. But the change in ふる is not when it stops raining. It is when it begins raining. The change is going from no rain to rain. Therefore, to use ている one must be in the final state of the change, which is raining. Therefore "it is raining". If it had stopped raining, we would no longer be in the resultant state and ている can not be used. Only た.<br><br>If you want to say "It has stopped raining" using ている you must find a verb in which the change is going from rain to no rain. For example 雨が止んでいる</br></br></br>  <br>So pretty much the same as everyone else here who spend their time looking for ways to project and put other people down, exactly as you have just done?</br>  <br>No it's not. <br>Even less so for an English speaker. It is objectively more complex. <br><br>I wish Tae Kim never shut down his forum. You sycophants really need to fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just say that there are too types of verbs: action verbs and state verbs.</br>  <br>two*</br>  <br>You objectively have to learn more to know how to conjugate all the different verbs into past tense. I wish people would stop nit-picking Tae Kim as if that somehow made them better.</br>  <br>Watch out. C was indeed called. But not by B. He was called by A and the one who made him do it was B.</br>  <br>Conjugation is not the hard part at all. It's the mindset for a way saying things that just doesn't exist in the English language that's hard and that's exactly what the causative form is.</br>  Do many of you have speaking partners? I'm looking at the only link for it in the guide but I really haven't tried speaking japanese yet and don't feel like fucking up royally to someone I can barely understand.  <br>How many times are people going to fall for this one? It's unnatural Japanese, no one is going to speak like this because even natives think it's confusing.</br>  <br>Not true. No one is making anyone call anyone. Maybe you are confusing passive with causative form.</br>  New to the thread. Why is Rosetta Stone not listed as a learning resource? Just curious so don't sperg out.  <br>I fully agree with you, also the mix of 使役受身形 is really annoying as well. Conjugating verbs is just, well, conjugating verbs.</br>  <br>If you translate it literally it means Rain is falling. In english, the verb is "to rain" itself, but in Japanese 降る is the "falling" verb, which the rain is doing.</br>  <br>whats a roseta stone?</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Tae Kim makes some pretty huge mistakes in his guide though, at best misleading and at worst completely wrong.<br><br>For example something as simple and essential as the は particle. In his guide he states:<br><br> The 「が」 particle identifies a specific property of something while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. <br><br>This is horseshit and it made me misunderstand the は particle for like a whole year into my study, until I happened to come across this video and saw how much it conflicts with the info I got from Tae Kim: http://www.gwu.edu/~eall/vjg/08part<wbr>iclewa/08particlewa.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are far better resources that are recommended over it, for one.</br>  <br>Japanese isn't Spanish.</br>   tfw can't learn Japanese anymore <br><br>I kept starting and stopping and now <br><br>I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter.<br><br>College is over and so is high school so there are no girls or bros to use it on.<br><br>It'd take me three fucking years to get decent at it. By then I'd be 25, which is essentially an old man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>If you spent the time you wasted on that post learning instead, yes you could learn Japanese.<br><br>"You miss 500% of the slam dunks you never take" - Albert Einstein</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oNf<wbr>2BbLj5W0</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>This is mostly wrong.<br>Some verbs can go either way like 落ちている 飲んでいる and it has nothing to do with when the state changes. It depends entirely on context.</br></br></br>  <br>it depends what you want to learn Japanese for.. like if you languages then why not keep at and have fun. If you want to know Japanese to one day live in japan then you should for sure keep trucking</br>  <br>Yes, exactly, conjugation isn't difficult. That was Tae Kim's point. That the rules you have to learn to conjugate to past tense are the most complex in the whole language, and they're not complex at all.

You're all wrong because it doesn't even make sense in Japanese. The two に particles are awkward as fuck. Apart from my good friends mom here who is still thinking about the sentence.

I guess it gets harder then, but that doesn't deter me tbh.</br>  http://homepage3.nifty.com/park/asp<wbr>ect.htm<br>Here is a very interesting discussion about the various interpretations of ている.</br></wbr>  <br><br>Whats makes it bad, exactly?</br></br>  <br> I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter. <br>Isn't this a myth? I'm a business major and from what I've seen people will learn languages at any point if it means making more money via international partnerships. I'm talking people in their 30s and 40s.</br></br>  <br>So, it's like the complete opposite of what TK says?</br>  Aiming for N1 in December, but I feel like I have to improve my grammar quite a bit to make that happen. I've tried making grammar decks in Anki before but never managed to make one that works for me.<br><br>How does DJT use Anki to study grammar?</br></br>  <br>No it's absolutely 100% true, how could you think otherwise? Everyone knows that after you hit your mid 20s your brain turns into stone and is totally unable to learn new things. That's why everyone is totally justified in blaming their lack of learning on being "too old", it's clearly not an excuse in any way.</br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>Are you trolling, or?</br>  <br>well once you hit your mid twenties most people dont care about you anymore so it really does suck honestly</br>  <br>I'd post my autismbux.png if i was at home.<br>Where OP admits that he dreamed the sentence up and it didn't come from native media.<br>I fucking told him it's confusing as fuck even to a native.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I prefer to read native material while slowly go through grammar resources (JLPT textbooks, DOJG, Imabi, among others). If I need a grammar point clarified while I'm reading, I just refer to the DOJG or Google or this thread.</br>  <br>That's clearly sarcasm.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say he's right, but he's not entierly wrong either. This is always brought up in lingustic courses together with "language acquisition" and yada yada yada.</br>  <br>I grabbed the DOJG deck from the COR and went through it slowly, while still reading stuff in Japanese. That way I made sure I went through all the essentials, while still looking stuff up as needed when encountering them in "the wild"</br>  <br>It definitely is true to a certain extent.<br>Native Japanese speakers who wait until they're older to pick up English will almost always be unable to distinguish between Ls and Rs no matter how much they try.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that, and my friend told me she thought her Japanese was embarassingly bad for not understanding it at all. Heck even I didn't think about it being off and thought I could translate it.</br>  <br>Stop that shit, you want to turn this into DJT: Misinformation General</br>  <br> Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that <br>The authors of DOBJG sure did.</br></br>  <br>I got a copy of Rosetta stone for free so I started there for about three or so days. During those three, days I learned nothing about the fact that there are three different alphabets, nor did I learn about the many particles and grammar rules that make sentence structure so different from English. What I did learn, is how to say and read (but not right) Boy, plane, and "The dog is under the table" all of which btw only takes 3 mins to learn with anki flashcards.<br><br>So while there are many ways to go about learning Japanese, Rosetta Stone is not really an option unless you never want to reach fluency</br></br></br>  <br>Post the entire page.</br>  do not attempt to speak/write in kansai ben <br>You end up sounding like a stereotypical Chinese man speaking semi-broken English trying really hard to sound Southern</br>  <br>せやろか？</br>  <br>The whole L and R problem for Japanese speakers is true, and I've been Googling to see how age affects language learning ability, and as far as I can tell, it does get more difficult to become bilingual the older you get.</br>  <br>I'm practising for N1 aswell, I'm only studying with the Kanzen Master N1 grammar book right now.<br>1 lesson per day and there's 20 of them.<br><br>Nihongonomori is a good ressource too, it's somewhat easier when a person is explaining a grammar point sometimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone correct me if I'm wrong<br><br>But I'm under the impression that that style of learning is only effective if you don't want to read/write japanese, only hear/speak it.<br><br>In other languages the two might be very closely correlated since you don't have thousands of characters to learn,<br>but it's completely ineffective if you ever plan on reading/writing it.<br><br>and most people in these threads care about reading japanese above all the other skills, so rosetta stone isn't a good option</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't do this to me.

However if you're trying to build something on top of nothing it is going to be confusing at best and grossly inefficient at worse. We're not babies - we don't NEED to learn like them. Adults have the ability to think abstractly which is a powerful tool in helping to remember things (see mnemonics + comparisons), whereas babies / children pretty much HAVE to brute force memorize things via hearing them repeatedly.<br><br>I haven't used the program properly myself, so I can't comment on any specifics, so maybe look up some reviews yourself if you're interested for some reason.

In the car sentence, the friend is performing a direct action on the car, whereas in the Merry one, two passives are being stacked, which shouldn't be possible. Furthermore, in , (8) is completely different from (9) grammatically because in the former, 横に denotes a location, not another passive; thus, (8) makes sense whereas (9) does not.</br>  <br>For 2-3 days set your new cards to 0 and just review.</br>  <br>That one is a especially bad case because Aに電話する is a set expression that means "To call A on the telephone". That's why I said that  has two different uses of に in the same sentence. The first に is to mark the agent and the second に is part of the set expression. It's a bad choice of example sentence and just causes needless confusion.</br>  <br>彼は彼女に彼女の浮気相手に電話された<br>make sense.</br></br>  <br>It works for me.</br>  <br>Seems fine to me.</br>  <br>But I don't understand what purpose 彼女に serves in that sentence.</br>  <br>I think I'll do that actually.

Or archaic Japanese. <br>let's not get ahead of ourselves tiger</br></br>  <br>Okay. So your girlfriend is performing the action. The action being "you getting called by your girlfriend's lover"? What?</br>  <br>I'm just curious, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong by looking over the differences/evolution in time of the language.</br>  もしもしDJTくん僕の名前はバナアド  <br> you getting called by your girlfriend's lover" <br>Not that guy, but she called her lover. You're affected by the event, although you're not a direct participant.</br></br>  <br>The action is that she calls her lover (that's not the speaker so an adulterous lover). It's a bit tricky to translate:<br> My girlfriend called her lover and I was troubled by it. </br></br>  <br>バナアドさん、元気ですか？<br>ホモセックスしようぜ？</br></br>  <br>Do you mean "she got called by her lover"? Because in that case, I can sort of start making sense of it. So what it's saying is sort of like, "My girfriend, the rotten cunt, fucked me emotionally by getting called by her lover" And yet it still doesn't seem right because you're making it sound like direct harm to you was done by your girlfriend whereas she didn't do anything directly, she was just called.</br>  What's the different between が or は?  <br>No. She called her lover, not the other way around. The passive is to make the speaker seem negatively affected by her actions.</br>  <br> No. She called her lover <br><br>But this can't be the case. You would need to use を for that, like in the car sentence.</br></br></br>  <br>The other way around. Because 彼女に is first. Like the link from dobjg said earlier.<br>"My girfriend, the rotten cunt, fucked me emotionally by calling her lover"</br></br>  <br>There are plenty of resources for classical japanese, but the fact that you can't find (let alone read) them yourself means that they'll be useless to you at your level.<br><br>As for dialects, they're blurry and constantly changing.

You will also build willpower by resisting the urge to masturbate even though you're surrounding yourself with erotic materials. <br><br> The lewd scenes eventually started to appear, but I was determined to resist and protect my testosterone from destruction. It was my only way to stay passionate, energized, and focused on studying. My only way to learn Japanese. <br> Even reading the simplest things required every ounce of willpower I had. I wasn't sure how long I could sustain the effort without bursting apart. It seemed like the only thing holding my mind together was my one desire to learn Japanese. The intensity was maddening. After resisting masturbation for so long, even a basic eroge became a desperate struggle for survival. <br> I thought I had everything under control, but then the lewdest and most arousing scene imaginable seemed to appear out of no where to claim all of my Japanese progress and my testosterone. <br> Normally it would have been child's play to quickly masturbate and calm my mind, even though it would have come at the cost of my passion and focusing ability, but after resisting masturbation for so long it took everything I had AND MORE. <br> Then something just snapped. Something inside of me.  <br> "NO! NO MORE! THAT'S IT! I DON'T CARE!" <br> I didn't care anymore. I didn't care about the lewd women. I didn't care about masturbating. I only cared about reading. I only cared about learning Japanese. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hey I am from 4chan <br><br>You guys crack me up.</br></br>  What does 付き合ってくれる人 mean exactly?  <br> willpower <br>nice meme breh<br>just pop an adderal</br></br></br>  <br>A parson who do something with you</br>  <br> Adderall without willpower <br>That's a recipe for passionately shitposting and researching weird shit for 12 hours straight.<br><br>Adderall without willpower is like shooting a nuke at a random location.

For otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These foraging trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. In a match-to-sample task study, a single California sea lion was able to demonstrate an understanding of symmetry, transitivity and equivalence; a second seal was unable to complete the tasks. They demonstrate the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language, though they only rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a captive California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing its head in synchrony to musical rhythms. The mating system of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, and the remaining 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rain Man pills</br>  can anyone tell me the Kanji on the left side of this i cant see them and this is the biggest pic i could get.<br>1 this girl is big.<br>2 This boy is tiny.<br>3 this is the story of the 2.(or does couple fit better)</br></br></br>  <br>I can't read it, but I want to shit post.<br><br>So it's basically LoveCom but ghetto and shitty.</br></br></br>  Minna~<br><br>Daijobū desu-ka?</br></br>  <br>Suck it, Zayn</br>  im just asking for a little help ive seen people do it with dragon ball all the time.  <br>Repeat it in かな、名ファッゴッと</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127514528 <br>plz no</br>  <br> かな、名ファッゴッと <br>I can use Google Translate, too!</br></br>  Any Nico Live suggestions?

I'll definitely give it a shot then, if you recommend it.</br>  <br>If you don't count refreshing certain parts by looking it up in DOJG instead of going back to Tae Kim, sure.

Did you go through all of Tae Kim, as in, did you finish the advanced topic chapters as well?</br>  <br><br>pls respond</br></br>  <br>Not the whole thing. It's been a couple of years since then, so I can't recall exactly when I started reading, but looking at Tae Kim right now, I think I started reading when I finished the special expressions section and opted to do the advanced topics section later. Perhaps a bit before that even.</br>  <br>I was going to do that after I had a couple thousands words under my belt so I wasn't looking up 95+% of the words.<br><br>I think I'm going to just persevere though and start reading because I really, really hate Anki. If it wasn't for Kanji, I'd never touch the thing.</br></br></br>    <br>Well, thanks a tonne, anyway.

That's the only case where I can picture まったく光のない being a standalone sentence as it's like saying まったく光のない暗闇</br>   先輩を攻略しちゃいます <br>Would this be:<br> I'm going to capture senpai. <br>or<br> I going to win senpai over. </br></br></br></br>  At which level can you read a light novel like Koizora?<br><br>After a textbook like Tobira/N3?</br></br>  <br>N5 is the equivalent of a one and a half year old kid's language capabilities.

There's nothing special about jukugo, it's just vocabulary.</br>  外国語を習うのは難しい～  I was reading and a manga and stumbled on "朝早すぎ". I understand what it means ("It's too early in the morning.") and I know how to use すぎる but I'm confused as to why the る is dropped here.<br><br>Is it simply some kind of casual/colloquial way of talking? I feel like there's something I'm missing on there. There's no mention of this in Tae Kim's guide so could someone clear that up for me please?</br></br>  <br>It's just slang.</br>  <br>You should at this point in time stop using kanjidamage.</br>  Did anyone having retention/acquisition issues with vocabulary notice a significant increase after they started learning kanji?

If you wanted to express the same thing politely you could for example say 朝が早すぎます, but preferable you wouldn't say anything because complaining isn't very polite no matter what you say.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for your reply.<br>What about these https://www.google.co.jp/#q=%22%E6%<wbr>9C%9D%E6%97%A9%E3%81%99%E3%81%8E%E3<wbr>%81%A7%E3%81%99%22&amp;start=0 ?</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> This is a casual and not strictly grammatical expression, you can't just fix it with a です <br>I don't see anything wrong with it.</br></br>   戦場で人が殺せない」ということは、「平和な時代に人を殺すのが止められ<wbr>ない」のとまったく同じように間違っているのだ。</wbr> <br><br>Someone help me understand this sentence please. Isn't the second part true and not 間違い? You can't stop people from killing each other during peacetime.</br></br>  <br>I mean, you can say it, but it sounds a bit funky and not very polite because of the grammatical shortcuts. Stem-form of a verb plus です is not a proper, polite speech pattern. It's slangy.<br><br><br>Just look at the results, first one is <br> 朝早すぎですよ！！おはようございます！！ヾ(o´∀｀o)ﾉ  <br><br>Clearly this is not something you'd write to your boss in a message. It looks like a casual greeting, despite the desumasu. Most of the other results also have such politeness level quirks, using words and grammar that shouldn't be used when talking to superiors. So it seems this is the type of expression you can use when you want to sound polite-ish to your friends or acquaintances, but not in business or formal situations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As always: Context?<br><br>The grammar is pretty straight forward, only thing is that you might interpret the second part as not people in general, but the speaker, or listener. THEY specifically would not kill anyone during peacetime. But again, can't really know without context.

It makes me want to study even harder.</br></br></br>  <br>言い過ぎ is a common expression so it has essentially turned into a normal noun from too much usage. 朝早すぎ isn't, in fact it is probably derived from the grammar of such expressions such as 言い過ぎ. Just compare the google results. 言い過ぎです has like 50 times more results than 言い過ぎます. However 朝が早すぎます has more results than 朝早すぎです</br>  <br>How long does the J-CAT test last?

Personally, I learn my vocab cards outside of anki before reviewing them so I just left it as default.<br><br>Starting ease is too high imo. If you answer good every time, your card's interval will be multiplied by 2.5 after every review. So you'll see a card after 1 day, 2 days, 5 days, 12 days, 30 days.

I struggle to understand why people enjoy shonen battle shows.</br>  They're healing.  <br>Some shonen battle shows have nice aspects, not sure if absolute duo was shonen but it was battle and was cute, Julie was really adorable</br>  <br>best girl in a pantie on head wearing summer anime.</br>  <br> Japanese could animate literally anything they want, the possibilities are endless <br> isntead they make the same cookie cutter cute garbage with no story or development and copypasted faces <br> /a/ defends this </br></br></br>  <br>Variety, I enjoy tons of different anime. One of the reasons why I haven't burnt out is because I can watch a bunch of mech stuff,then move on to some slice of life, and finally could end it off with some battle shonens. I have my favorites, but there's no good reason not to give every a chance.</br>  <br> the most egregious offender </br>  <br> implying we don't get anime with diverse genres every season </br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? We didn't get any SoL anime last season.</br></br>  <br> anything they want <br>No they can't and that's what veterans are complaining about since a decade, retard.</br></br>  <br> isntead they make the same cookie cutter cute garbage with no story or development and copypasted faces <br><br> make a show with interesting characters or at least one interesting character with some depth <br> TWO FACED BITCH, NO PERSONALITY, EDGY SHOW, FORCED DRAMA </br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright I'll jump on the bait.<br><br>Why do you think your manner of storytelling is better than other people's? It's subjective.<br><br>For that matter, why are you of the opinion that shows need a storyline with development? Slice of Life by definition doesn't follow a traditional storyline, instead showing you "what is" (Regardless of the reality in which it's presented). There's no need to show development, there's no reason for there to be a beginning, middle, and conclusion with a lesson to be taught (Which is cliche as well, but a different conversation), it just is what it is.<br><br>You throw around pejoratives like 'cookie cutter' and 'copypasted faces', but aside from a few outliers I don't see this to be the case. I refute this specifically because one of the main draws to shows like these to me is the animation and the style. I'm sure that someone will bring up some obscure examples to refute me, but for the majority of the characters/shows the animation and styles are unique.<br><br>I mean, I understand that you think if studios weren't animating shows that you don't like they could be animating shows that you do like, but that's not how the world works anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yahari was last season...</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic?</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic you idiot.</br>  <br><br>What is Kiniro Mosaic<br>What is Danna ga nani (long title)<br>What is first half of Yuki-chan</br></br></br></br>  I like slice of life because it's a non-stressful genre with an emphasis on the characters rather than a plot. You generally become attached to the characters and it's fun to watch them interact with each other and do things, however inconsequential they are. Moe often just adds to this endearing quality that the characters bring, although it can often feel cheap or tacked-on. K-On! for example is an excellent slice of life where the cuteness of the characters doesn't feel forced, and you really grow to enjoy watching their antics.  <br>Most appealing genre useful to forget your daily life drama/shit.</br>  <br>I dig the choker. Glasses. Big titties, wide hips, tiny fucking tight waist, that fuck me now if you date attitude.<br>Mah dick wants that.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Why?</br>   reading anime reviews   Because it's easy.<br>And just calming as hell to watch. Like Non Non Biyori? That show is chill as hell.</br>  <br>While I can appreciate the cute girls I find these kinds of shows extremely boring.</br>  <br>What's wrong with wanting to see other's opinion on a show?</br>  <br>Yahari is not SoL, just because it has a school setting it doesn't mean it's SoL.</br>  <br>Everything, fuck off.</br>  <br>You have /a/ for that.</br>  <br>Okay. <br><br><br>It was pretty close to slice of life. No real overarching plot, although there are a few "arcs" I guess. I wouldn't call it SoL but the genre's vague enough for me to understand why someone would.</br></br></br></br>  <br> studios weren't animating shows that you don't like they could be animating shows that you do like <br>Instead they animate the same basic thing about cute girls doing cute things to pander to the otaku demographic. I don't if you want cute girls but must they do the same cute things over and over. Don't they ever feel tired seeing and hearing the same cliche lines again and again.</br></br>   with a big emphasis on moe characters?   <br>True, but /a/ isn't always talking about every show and some stuff won't get more than a few posts in a thread.</br>  I don't. Never even made it past episode 2 of one.<br><br>I don't really get the appeal of watching a bunch of autistic girls fuck around in a generic setting.</br></br>  <br>Fuck your sentence structure, also inductive generalization.</br>  <br>Good thing people or otakus always link moe to cute girls doing cute things.</br>  <br>Some faggot was so asspained that people didn't agree with his definition of moe that they spent time and made this chart.</br>  <br> being a normie </br>  <br><br>I don't really like Slice of Life.<br> I'm just desperate for more Soul Eater. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even a Oreigarufag, but it's clear that drama was the main point of the show.</br>  <br> otakus <br>This is the kind of pleb who misuses the term as some sort of synonym for cute.</br></br>  <br>But it wasn't like that in the first season.</br>  <br>Don't blame me if you guys are the one using it as a synonym for cute.</br>  <br>Who are "you guys" exactly?

That being said, Yahari kind of has a plot?</br>  <br>Yes it was. <br><br>Especially the last part.</br></br></br>  <br>It can't be SoL when your protagonist is literally drama and teenage angst incarnate.</br>  <br>The one that always call cute girls doing cute things moe. Those kind of guys. Not one people ever try to argue that they aren't moe which makes it pretty clear that most people think that moe is definitely cute especially from an anime otaku.</br>  <br>but the show consists of slices of 8man's life</br>  <br>I'm not him but what kind of respond is that? Are you retarded? <br> pleb, misusing the term <br><br> don't blame me if you guys are using it like that <br><br>You are saying that it's "guys" fault that you are misusing it?<br>What kind of retard are you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know, Mushishi is also a SoL. Last I checked it has no moe in it.  <br>Then, I guess, Monogatari is a SoL too, because it consists of slices of Araragi's life.</br>  <br>Mushishi was moe as fuck</br>  <br>It was very moe.</br>  I like seeing people be happy.  <br>Mushishi is iyashikei and Ginko is very moe.</br>  <br>Because they're men and you're a suppressed homo or worse, a closeted tranny.</br>  <br>Monogatari is SoL.</br>  <br>I think you're the faggot.</br>  <br>You are starting to make me angry anon.</br>  Daily reminder that moe is the feeling of affection towards something.<br><br>Mecha can be moe<br> You  can be moe</br></br></br>  <br>But that's not what most people use it for. When someone say that mecha is moe that usually follows with a picture of a cute mecha.</br>  <br>Misuse of a term doesn't mean the definition changes.<br><br> Mecha are pretty damn moe </br></br></br>  <br>Most people are retarded.</br>  <br>What's the difference anyway? Isn't iyashikei just a subgenre of SoL?</br>  <br>The term that people generally mean when they use "moe" is "Cute Girl Doing Cute Things", however CGDCTshit doesn't have the same kind of shitposting potential as  moeshit  does.</br>  <br><br>haha you didn't even try to refute him</br></br>  <br> haha <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Only crossboarders who use  'moeshit'  which don't know what moe is use it like that. <br>Moe is not a genre, and it is likely prevalent in your favourite anime. <br><br>Regardless of how many idiots can't use it, moe actually has a definition, but is a subjective adjective. <br><br><br> same thing over and over again <br>You don't watch anime, because otherwise you would know it's usually 1-2 per season we get CGDCT, and they're not even the top sellers most of the time. <br>Either that or you're taking shitposters bait.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> moeshit <br>I love how this word still triggers /a/ so much</br></br>  <br>Well it's a good thing that he's right.</br>  <br>Yeah, crossboarding newfags trigger me.</br>  <br>haha what do you his farts smell like <br>just asking for a laugh haha</br></br>  <br>The shitty waifu bait anime are however the ones which get talked about the most, even though there are many better ones</br>  <br> But that's not what most people use it for <br><br>Who gives a fuck.

Obviously the Miia will be another bellydance but the idea I had for Cerea is as good, at least for me.  Shy Cerea lifting her skirt to show her pelvis/hips, like she doesnt have a vagoo I can do that, but still it somehow feels lewd. </br>  <br>Cute lewd is ok. Plus Cerea is great.</br>  <br>Seconded for cute lewd Cerea that won't even require spoilering but will because  some mods are easy to trigger .</br>  <br><br><br>Casting my vote for cute lewd Cerea as well.</br></br></br>  <br>You do you loen, but belly dance Miia  or really any Miia   is always welcome</br>  <br><br> Obviously the Miia will be another bellydance <br><br>Stop it, Loen.

I think it gets some hate in /ic/, at least the few times I have been there its been like that, but Im not sure why, since it works wonders for me.

I really should get a better tablet but its not like a expensive tablet will give you magical drawing skills, its just a tool, so this one will do for a while. But this comes from someone that has no idea about tablets, this genius is my first and only one.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you use pen pressure?</br>  <br>Of course. I remember doing drawings with a mouse, pen preassure really feels like heaven.</br>  <br>I need a tablet for drawing.<br>What should I look for in my tablet?</br></br>  <br>She is best girl  in the first chapter. </br>  <br> no dubs or trips  <br>Ha.</br></br>  <br>I dont know anon, I just got mine because  it was the first one that I found, I knew I wouldnt find another one anytime soon so bought it the very same day.  You will have better luck in /ic/ with that question.</br>  <br>They'd be suggesting high priced/overly complicated ones and hating each other's tastes.</br>    <br>Thanks Loen. I'm the anon who drew the big nippled Rach and I was considering buying a tablet to further my drawing. Any tips to get clean lines like yours when I draw in Sai/PS?</br>  <br> Okay, Cerea then. <br>God's be praised!</br></br>    NTR doujins practically here  <br>Literally can't wait.</br>  <br>There's already a preview for a Papi one<br><br>Glad I couldn't care less what happens to Papi</br></br></br>  <br>You monster.</br>  <br>Fuck you!</br>  <br>You have a point there anon, but I really dont know.<br><br>In SAI, change your Ctrl+Z to a shortcut, a single key, because you gonna need it a lot (I have mine on backspace, Im left handed so its a well placed key for my free hand). Then do clean smooth lines in one swing, thats what makes it look clean. You will be re-doing the very same line 5+ times til it makes you happy, and same proccess with every single line.</br></br></br>    <br> Papi <br>Such a waste when we have Miia and Mero begging for a NTR doujin.</br></br>  <br>Mero yes<br><br>Miia no<br><br>I will genocide crusade anyone that makes anything with Miia that's not vanilla and love filled</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When was this done?! My hea..hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhnngggg</br>  <br>Still think Miia as a DJ doesn't exactly fit her personality-wise. I think she should be an idol.</br>  <br> Miia no <br>Sorry but your waifu was probably created with NTR in mind. It's no wonder Okayado filled the house with other girls, including one with this particular fetish.</br></br>  <br>Damn straight.</br>  <br>So all of them<br>Because let's face it, the artists will be able to pull the most contrived plots out their asses for each girl to be NTR'd. Every single one of them.</br></br>  <br> implying Suu can possibly be NTR'd </br>  <br>This yours?</br>  <br>Is this really a life worth living?</br>    <br>She can be NTR'd away from Papi</br>    <br>That dragon girl looks alarmingly like she's &gt;shiggy diggy doo-ing</br>  <br>But if we're following the logic of her being main girl, wouldn't she be a bad singer on top of being a bad cook?</br>  <br>Somehow I think Papi would be the one being NTR'd in that situation.</br>  <br>Suu inflatable-seats for sale when?</br>  <br>Jesus, can anyone stop the slime menace?!</br>  <br>No.<br><br> But who would want to? </br></br></br>  <br> tfw a slime will never rape you for your juices </br>  <br>Well, duh. You can't rape the willing.</br>  <br><br><br> rape </br></br></br>  <br>By your logic she would also be fucking terrible at being a DJ as well, so it really wouldn't matter. That aside, it is still easier for me to picture her being an idol than a DJ in my head.</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure Matsu-Sensei did this one.</br></br>  <br><br>She may not be a very good singer. She also seems only marginally OK with being the center of attention in public.</br></br>  <br><br> Yukio. <br><br> Pretty easily in fact. A universal weakness for polymorphs like Suu in both science-fiction and fantasy is low temperatures. A chilly day was enough to threaten to freeze Suu solid. She's literally be powerless against a being that wields ice-magic. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Go ahead. Would be amazed if it travels past this board, but if you can get a  3D  to say it in a video, that'll probably work.</br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>That was a prentender. I use actually use correct punctuation. Also the file name is a give away. As seen in <br>.<br>Jerks trying to steal my waifu.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where are her  downy pubes.<br><br>Samus told me they'd have those.</br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>Mustard is a spice, the reason people use mustard is it provides the fiery sensation of spice without lingering on the palette.<br><br>You can literally notice this by going to the kitchen, taking out a mustard bottle and trying some.

We like you, really, so abort mission while you can.</br>  <br><br><br>It was a request from someone here on /a/.<br>You know I can't turn one of my own down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, stop. Cerea fans do not, I repeat, DO NOT need this. <br> ... <br>Get out.</br></br></br>  <br> It was a request from some retard here on /a/ <br> You know I can't turn one of my own down </br></br>  <br>Tell the fan to fuck off</br>  <br>Anon no.

You all win. Never say I don't listen to my critics.<br><br>If you simply MUST put a damper on my creative spirit, let's try something else. And here I was thinking the world of high-art was a place WITHOUT taboos.<br><br>How's this for something a little but closer to everyone's speed?<br>This one's nearing completion. I just need to make sure it's perfect before final submission for printing.<br><br>How does this look? My primary concern is the color of the scale texture. Does it look right to you?<br>Too red? Too pink? Not pink/red enough? I need a second opinion on these things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> that file-name </br></br>  <br>Darker red, I think. Just realised something though. If it's printed in a solid red, over time, the print cracks and makes its own scales. At least, that's how it is with some of my old sheets.</br>  <br>Darker red. I think Miia's scales are a darker red</br>  <br><br><br>Honestly, Rach's exoskeletal arms and hands are one of the few things I don't really like about Okayado's Arachnae/Dryders.<br>Yeah, it makes them more exotic, but the inflexible chitin on a very important part of their body just seems very dehumanizing.<br><br>That and the extra eyes are the only things I never really liked.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You are a graphic designer, so am I, so a little advice: dont pick up requests from only 1 anon. Pick requests that will satisfy many anons. You do something your fanbase doesnt like, you will lose them, so you change and adapt to their liking if you dont want to lose them.<br> If you simply MUST put a damper on my creative spirit, let's try something else <br>And dont start with this, that one sentence is basically the reason why deviantart and tumblr are the way they are when its about art. When you are a graphic designer, you dont work for yourself, you work for the public. You keep the masses happy, many happy anons&gt;1 happy anon. Keep it up anon, you are doing great things.</br></br> </br>  <br><br> And dont start with this, that one sentence is basically the reason why deviantart and tumblr are the way they are when its about art. <br><br>I was joking and speaking sarcastically.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit just die please</br>  <br><br>On the other hand, I guess I can see where he gets the pink from.</br></br>  <br>What is Miia's scale colour anyhow? Red or pink?</br>  <br><br><br>How's this?<br>I'm dealing with some very fine tolerances here, so they may look very similar, so I was very precise and incremental in fucking with the shade and hue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's sort of the point</br>  <br><br>It fluctuates due to just Okayado's inconsistencies, but I'm pretty sure it's a relatively light red (slightly lighter than her hair-color), but they're very shiny and reflective when she's not close to a shedding, so they reflect a lot of light that makes them appear lighter.</br></br>  <br><br>....What? That could be adorbs, not cancerous.</br></br>  <br><br>End of Eva flashbacks, man. <br><br>One whiff and you're reliving the trauma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it couldn't have<br><br>Do you think there's anything to be gained by referencing MLP? Anything at all?</br></br></br>  <br>And here I was considering purchasing one of your other shirts. Oh well, guess I get to keep that pocket filled.</br>  <br><br>Money from the freaks so he can finance his other works? A strangely sarcastic / and or flustered Cera denying any affiliation? <br><br>Come on, /a/nons, use your imagination. Did Lavar Burton teach us nothing?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not the shirt guy, but you're so full of shit it's running out your ears. <br><br>Either buy or don't, but I really hope you don't believe people give a shit when you write/say things like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Congrats. You're cancerous.</br>  <br><br> All the people mad at this. <br><br>Why? Clever graphical t-shirt designs are all about taking something from culture and modifying it to become something different, but recognizable.<br><br>How is MLP any different? It's a facet of modern pop-culture that many people are familiar with. What's wrong with fucking with their logo to turn it into something comically related?<br><br>Are people just having a knee-jerk reaction because they've been taught to get pissy any time My Little Pony is alluded to in any capacity?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure this person is trying to be funny, but have to remember this is /a/.<br><br> Refusing to buy something from an artist because at some point they did a commission for someone else that involved referencing a show you don't like. <br><br>That'd be a sad new level of autism. Thank God you probably aren't serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's a fine line between "exotic" and "alien" though.<br><br>The point of Monmusu should be to create women with exotic but appealing features, not off-putting alien-looking creatures that happen to also have some feminine human parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL THAT MAD because he did an awesome job with the Suu shirt. The Rach shirt is very cool and can pass off as some normalfag MMA thing, if not a very stylized Punisher.<br><br>For Cerea he could have gone with something very chivalrous/knightly (or even ginormous boobs/dat ass joke), but instead we see MLP which came off as derivative from a different fandom instead of something near and to monmusu.</br></br></br>   first MLP <br> now SJW defending it <br>funny how things turn out sometimes</br></br>  Did anybody else see this?<br><br>Was this an actual, official advertisement for the anime, or just a fan-made thing?</br></br>  <br> Cerea's sick burn  <br>Ouch.</br></br>  <br>I'm . I don't care for the new stuff, even if I've never seen an episode. Maybe just hype backlash. I just generally prefer the older style.</br>  <br><br> For Cerea he could have gone with something very chivalrous/knightly (or even ginormous boobs/dat ass joke), but instead we see MLP which came off as derivative from a different fandom instead of something near and to monmusu. <br><br>He said it was a specific request from someone on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is all just a ruse cruse, everyone knows MLP is hated here. And making that t-shirt knowing it is MLP and trying to tie Cerea to it. This is top top bait.</br>  <br><br>I don't see the problem. She still gotr a human torso/head.<br><br>And she could wax the chitin to get it shiny like a dominatrix in pvc. Fits perfectly if you ask me.<br><br>And I don't even know how chitin behaves as a material at human-size scale.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> getting this fucking mad because something relates to a show you don't like <br><br>You realize you are currently on a board that has not only frequent, but consistent threads about Naruto that are totally and completely unironic, right?<br>And that's been the case since before MLP was even a thing back in like 2010/11.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stroke a giant beetle. Or a crab shell. Or hell, use the broad part of your fingernail to touch/manipulate objects. The former will be what she feels like to touch. The latter will be what she feels when touching things.</br>  <br><br>You realize you're on a site that had an attack of the MLP fandom so severe it had to make a containment board for it?</br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Half the point of /a/ is to shit on things we don't like.</br>  <br><br>Talk about being cancerous. <br><br>Being open minded and not an asshole doesn't immediately mean SJW.  doesn't exclude it either </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> a fandom was/is bad <br> that means the media that created the fandom is by proxy inherently bad, and therefore we must imbue it with the status of some sort of supernatural evil that can never be mentioned even in jest <br><br>No, I think you just need to calm your fucking tits down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no problem with the texture of beetles.<br><br><br> SJW <br> open-minded <br>good joke</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Graphic design guy:<br><br>Do a GIS for "polo" "logo".<br>Make a parody of any of them, using Cerea and a lance.<br>???<br>Profit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not sure if you read that correctly, chief. <br><br>Try again. I'll wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> now SJW defending it <br><br>When did this happen?<br>I thought Monster Musume was too obscure of Tumblr land-whales to care about, and even if they did, the presence of breasts above a C-cup would make them run in terror.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell I just think it was a tacky/lame design, even if it was a request(?)</br>  <br>Yea? But at least Naruto is /a/ related. I don't need anymore shit thrown at Cerea. It's bad enough I have to dea with "horse pussy" all the time. The image just makes it worse for Centaur fans. Yes I mad.</br>    <br><br> Do a GIS <br> GIS <br>What does this stand for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some are already angry about it</br>  <br>I'm saying it being open-minded does exclude SJWs</br>  <br>More accurately it had an attack of shitposters that found something that people were willing to respond to endlessly<br>The show wasn't that great, but the thread on /co/ was relatively self contained and decently behaved, from an outside perspective.

That stuff is pretty good for sealing wounds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> For Cerea he could have gone with something very chivalrous/knightly <br><br>Designer-guy here.<br><br>That was actually the same guy's other suggestion.<br>We were brain-storming something to do with Centorea's Armor from Chapter 21 since the image of her fully suited-up would work well for a logo that breaks a complex image down to simple shapes.<br>However, he couldn't come up with a request that utilized it, so I tried my hand at his other idea.<br>I just didn't realize some people on /a/ would lose their fudge when reminded of a cartoon they didn't personally like. I don't like MLP either, but somebody offered to buy the print from me so I started making it. Seemed like a moderately clever idea for a parody-logo that would be feasible to make.<br><br>I'm just trying to create things that people will like here, guys. Calm down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't get it. Am I overlooking a pun here?<br><br>Is it just "Horse Pussy" that is the pun? Low-hanging fruit if that's the case.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I meant that for example, stroking her arm is akin to rubbing a two-foot long section beetle/crab shell. <br><br>This is assuming she's made of a similar material.<br>Just because part of her body is shaped like a spider, that doesn't mean it has the same texture.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But at least Naruto is /a/ related. <br><br>Shame that doesn't make the fans any less autistic, eh?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> How would she deal with a broken arm(or leg), I wonder? With most land arthropods, they seldom live long enough for it to matter. I think crabs and lobsters jettison the damaged limb then regrow them. Arachne=??? <br><br>Despite their spider-like portions, Arachnae are pretty assuredly mammalian and very similar in core biology to humans. Lamias are too, for example, despite being pikothermic and having various reptile-like properties.<br><br>Her limbs might even have an endoskeleton in ADDITION to having an exoskeleton for all we know, meaning a broken leg would heal like any mammalian species.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Even Miia's little D-shaped clips are making a "&gt;_&lt;"-expression. <br><br>Too cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But it is. We've seen that her hand is basically like a half-crab(with her digits forming the legs), sharp and hard enough to tear human flesh. Granted, the actual sensitivity on her part is up for debate(most arthropods have chitinous "hairs" jutting through the shell, which allows them to feel more things than just direct pressure against the surface (eg, wind blowing across the surface).</br></br>  <br><br><br>Did you mean the Ralph Lauren Logo? Or something similar to this? The Ralph Lauren Logo is often called the "Polo" logo.</br></br></br>  <br>her fingertips might be specialized, extra-hard material for digging into surfaces though. like teeth are a lot harder than other "hard" structures in the human body. So the rest of the chitinous cover might be different</br>  <br><br>Forgot the pic.</br></br>  <br><br> can't hold hands or cuddle with your Arachnae waifu unless she wears gloves <br><br>Sad stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ferrari logo could be cool</br>  Oh my.

An anon last thread said that Crunchyroll will be simulcasting the anime. Anybody got a source on that?  Current question points is 20/10/5.  <br>Thanks, anon!</br>  <br>No problem.

If we get 10 and 20 then we can know what the 5 pointer is anyways.</br>  <br>Also I thought that it was still about the carnival because of yesterdays question.</br>   tfw no personal trainer Polt   <br>It still is part of the festival, I think. But whenever Google gives me shit, I try copying the specific answer, like the other day, I didn't know what "J* J* Pose" meant. Still, I like that they acknowledged Cerea would be near impossible to Judo throw.</br>  <br>I thought that flying mare was some retarded version of those horses that go around in circles, like with carnivals or fairs, I dunno.</br>  <br>I thought it was like that school festival thing where two people carry a third and the "rider" tries to steal bandanas from other riders.<br><br>After I looked it up, I realised it's maybe related to the wrestling snapmare, although probably pronounced "ma-re" in Japanese.</br></br></br>        <br>I hate to break it to you, anon, but you were really unlucky tonight.
