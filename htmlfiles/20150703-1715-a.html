I can't stand Peter, but I like the format.  よくぞスレを立ててくれた, ！<br><br>褒美に死をやろう！</br></br>   tae kim grammar guide <br> 欲しい <br> This grammar is not used too often but is included for completeness. <br>What the fuck?</br></br></br>  Have you done your reps?  <br>Yes~</br>  調子乗んなよ！？私もい一緒に行くし！<br><br>I think the second sentence means something "because I will also go together with [someone]", but I can't figure out what the first sentence means. Any help?</br></br>  <br>調子に乗る</br>  <br> 調子に乗る <br><br>Agh, thank you! So then the な makes it a negative command? Something like "don't get carried away"/"don't get cocky"?</br></br></br>  <br>調子に乗る = to be elated; to be excited; to be caught up in the moment; to be carried away; to get cocky<br>調子乗んなよ basically means "Don't fucking get excited". The whole sentence would mean something like:<br> Don't fucking get excited because I'm also going with you. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, don't get carried away works better on second thought.</br>  As a newcomer who has lurked in /djt/ threads for a while: would you recommend doing RTK first and then grammar + a core deck, or just disregard RTK entirely and learn kanji from vocabulary?      <br><br>Thank you! But I'm still a little confused as to how this grammar is formed. Does this "んな" contraction happen regularly with negative commands in casual speech?</br></br>  <br>ん is a (failed) contraction of る and な. You can use it with verbs that end with る (ichidan or godan)<br><br>こっち来んな！<br>さっきから蹴んな！<br><br>it does this because る tends to disappear when you say things quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In certain levels, he's not a normal part of the cast.</br>  なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

Can't think of anything else.</br>  Why does does 褒める have furigana? <br><br>This is like 4 hours into the VN and no other kanji has it.</br></br>  If you cannot understand this simple story for children you are still a beginner.

Shouldn't it be "it has rained"? Isn't 降る one of those verbs?  <br>Because it implies he's above the beginner level that's he's set with this audio, and not on mount stupid, while simultaneously putting others down for not having practiced listening. He also assumes others are bragging about their Japanese comprehension level.</br>  Is there any place where という is explained with all of its nuances?  <br>What do you mean "one of those verbs"?</br>  <br>This picture fills me with inspiration.<br>Time to do my reps.</br></br>    <br>REKT.<br/></br>  <br>That mean "has done" instead of "is doing" when they're in the ている form. Or I mean, it obviously is not. But it seems like it should. Being similar to 降りる, 上る et.c. How do you tell?</br>  <br>Because he listened and realized that he can't even understand a children's story.<br>so he's trying to tell other people that they're in the same boat as him.<br>it's a fact that what he's saying is true.<br>but he's dumb as shit for giving this much of a fuck about it. find the transcript, anon, learn what they're saying, listen again, and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 9 out of 10 retarded japanese learners <br>what an official sounding statistic</br></br>  <br>B called C and A was negatively affected by it?</br>  <br>I think he means intransitive. Where 木の枝が折れている isn't "trees branch is breaking", but "tree branch is broken, and remains in that state." <br><br>I don't know all the rules to that, or if there are any rules. Just keep in mind that ている has a few functions. <br> ing 食べている "eating" <br> continued state　結婚している "married, and still am" <br> sequence of actions for movement verbs 行っている "went, and is there now" <br><br>At least that's how I understand it. I could be wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know of a particular rule or a resource that lists them. I think you just need to read a lot and figure out which is meaning is more commonly meant.<br><br>降っている leans towards "raining" to me, but I'm not a native.</br></br></br>  <br>This is another case of people wasting their time in this thread trying to be superior to others for no good reason.<br><br>It's two things in action: The "suffering" passive, and the common construction of に電話する "To call on the telephone"<br><br> AはBにCに電話された。 <br> Cに電話された <br>C was called<br> AはBに <br>By B, to A's displeasure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Passive, causative, etc. you fucking drone.</br>  <br>This sentence really does throw me off though. A being the subject　he's the one calling C right. And B is the one making him do it?</br>  <br>That's easier.</br>  <br>ている can mean that in verbs that involve a change, and if the object is still in the final state of the change. Like 降りる means to go from somewhere high to somewhere low, in other words a change. So if the person is still in the low place after having descended, you can use ている. But the change in ふる is not when it stops raining. It is when it begins raining. The change is going from no rain to rain. Therefore, to use ている one must be in the final state of the change, which is raining. Therefore "it is raining". If it had stopped raining, we would no longer be in the resultant state and ている can not be used. Only た.<br><br>If you want to say "It has stopped raining" using ている you must find a verb in which the change is going from rain to no rain. For example 雨が止んでいる</br></br></br>  <br>So pretty much the same as everyone else here who spend their time looking for ways to project and put other people down, exactly as you have just done?</br>  <br>No it's not. <br>Even less so for an English speaker. It is objectively more complex. <br><br>I wish Tae Kim never shut down his forum. You sycophants really need to fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just say that there are too types of verbs: action verbs and state verbs.</br>  <br>two*</br>  <br>You objectively have to learn more to know how to conjugate all the different verbs into past tense. I wish people would stop nit-picking Tae Kim as if that somehow made them better.</br>  <br>Watch out. C was indeed called. But not by B. He was called by A and the one who made him do it was B.</br>  <br>Conjugation is not the hard part at all. It's the mindset for a way saying things that just doesn't exist in the English language that's hard and that's exactly what the causative form is.</br>  Do many of you have speaking partners? I'm looking at the only link for it in the guide but I really haven't tried speaking japanese yet and don't feel like fucking up royally to someone I can barely understand.  <br>How many times are people going to fall for this one? It's unnatural Japanese, no one is going to speak like this because even natives think it's confusing.</br>  <br>Not true. No one is making anyone call anyone. Maybe you are confusing passive with causative form.</br>  New to the thread. Why is Rosetta Stone not listed as a learning resource? Just curious so don't sperg out.  <br>I fully agree with you, also the mix of 使役受身形 is really annoying as well. Conjugating verbs is just, well, conjugating verbs.</br>  <br>If you translate it literally it means Rain is falling. In english, the verb is "to rain" itself, but in Japanese 降る is the "falling" verb, which the rain is doing.</br>  <br>whats a roseta stone?</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Tae Kim makes some pretty huge mistakes in his guide though, at best misleading and at worst completely wrong.<br><br>For example something as simple and essential as the は particle. In his guide he states:<br><br> The 「が」 particle identifies a specific property of something while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. <br><br>This is horseshit and it made me misunderstand the は particle for like a whole year into my study, until I happened to come across this video and saw how much it conflicts with the info I got from Tae Kim: http://www.gwu.edu/~eall/vjg/08part<wbr>iclewa/08particlewa.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are far better resources that are recommended over it, for one.</br>  <br>Japanese isn't Spanish.</br>   tfw can't learn Japanese anymore <br><br>I kept starting and stopping and now <br><br>I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter.<br><br>College is over and so is high school so there are no girls or bros to use it on.<br><br>It'd take me three fucking years to get decent at it. By then I'd be 25, which is essentially an old man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>If you spent the time you wasted on that post learning instead, yes you could learn Japanese.<br><br>"You miss 500% of the slam dunks you never take" - Albert Einstein</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oNf<wbr>2BbLj5W0</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>This is mostly wrong.<br>Some verbs can go either way like 落ちている 飲んでいる and it has nothing to do with when the state changes. It depends entirely on context.</br></br></br>  <br>it depends what you want to learn Japanese for.. like if you languages then why not keep at and have fun. If you want to know Japanese to one day live in japan then you should for sure keep trucking</br>  <br>Yes, exactly, conjugation isn't difficult. That was Tae Kim's point. That the rules you have to learn to conjugate to past tense are the most complex in the whole language, and they're not complex at all. It was an implicit comparison with other languages.<br><br>Nevermind, actually. This is a stupid discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your blog.</br>  <br>I want to learn if so I'm not a monolingual degenerate and it seems easy enough to learn, but I can't stay motivated. It's the same story each time I start up again.<br><br><br><br>I actually did pick it back up recently which is why I'm ITT, but I'm scared I'll end up quitting again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to learn if so I'm not a monolingual degenerate <br> it seems easy enough to learn <br><br>Japanese is literally one of the hardest languages for a monolingual English speaker to learn.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't rely on motivation, it's fickle and fleeting at the best of times. Work on discipline, which is in short, the ability to do things regardless of your state of mind at present.<br><br>"Just fucking do it already you bitch" - Gatorade</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Sup' fellas. You're all wrong because it doesn't even make sense in Japanese. The two に particles are awkward as fuck. Apart from my good friends mom here who is still thinking about the sentence. However, she can stop doing that because its just bullshit. It's just made to trick people. Now if it were ～させた we would be talking. As  touched upon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I guess it gets harder then, but that doesn't deter me tbh.</br>  http://homepage3.nifty.com/park/asp<wbr>ect.htm<br>Here is a very interesting discussion about the various interpretations of ている.</br></wbr>  <br><br>Whats makes it bad, exactly?</br></br>  <br> I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter. <br>Isn't this a myth? I'm a business major and from what I've seen people will learn languages at any point if it means making more money via international partnerships. I'm talking people in their 30s and 40s.</br></br>  <br>So, it's like the complete opposite of what TK says?</br>  Aiming for N1 in December, but I feel like I have to improve my grammar quite a bit to make that happen. I've tried making grammar decks in Anki before but never managed to make one that works for me.<br><br>How does DJT use Anki to study grammar?</br></br>  <br>No it's absolutely 100% true, how could you think otherwise? Everyone knows that after you hit your mid 20s your brain turns into stone and is totally unable to learn new things. That's why everyone is totally justified in blaming their lack of learning on being "too old", it's clearly not an excuse in any way.</br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>Are you trolling, or?</br>  <br>well once you hit your mid twenties most people dont care about you anymore so it really does suck honestly</br>  <br>I'd post my autismbux.png if i was at home.<br>Where OP admits that he dreamed the sentence up and it didn't come from native media.<br>I fucking told him it's confusing as fuck even to a native.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I prefer to read native material while slowly go through grammar resources (JLPT textbooks, DOJG, Imabi, among others). If I need a grammar point clarified while I'm reading, I just refer to the DOJG or Google or this thread.</br>  <br>That's clearly sarcasm.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say he's right, but he's not entierly wrong either. This is always brought up in lingustic courses together with "language acquisition" and yada yada yada.</br>  <br>I grabbed the DOJG deck from the COR and went through it slowly, while still reading stuff in Japanese. That way I made sure I went through all the essentials, while still looking stuff up as needed when encountering them in "the wild"</br>  <br>It definitely is true to a certain extent.<br>Native Japanese speakers who wait until they're older to pick up English will almost always be unable to distinguish between Ls and Rs no matter how much they try.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that, and my friend told me she thought her Japanese was embarassingly bad for not understanding it at all. Heck even I didn't think about it being off and thought I could translate it.</br>  <br>Stop that shit, you want to turn this into DJT: Misinformation General</br>  <br> Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that <br>The authors of DOBJG sure did.</br></br>  <br>I got a copy of Rosetta stone for free so I started there for about three or so days. During those three, days I learned nothing about the fact that there are three different alphabets, nor did I learn about the many particles and grammar rules that make sentence structure so different from English. What I did learn, is how to say and read (but not right) Boy, plane, and "The dog is under the table" all of which btw only takes 3 mins to learn with anki flashcards.<br><br>So while there are many ways to go about learning Japanese, Rosetta Stone is not really an option unless you never want to reach fluency</br></br></br>  <br>Post the entire page.</br>  do not attempt to speak/write in kansai ben <br>You end up sounding like a stereotypical Chinese man speaking semi-broken English trying really hard to sound Southern</br>  <br>せやろか？</br>  <br>The whole L and R problem for Japanese speakers is true, and I've been Googling to see how age affects language learning ability, and as far as I can tell, it does get more difficult to become bilingual the older you get.</br>  <br>I'm practising for N1 aswell, I'm only studying with the Kanzen Master N1 grammar book right now.<br>1 lesson per day and there's 20 of them.<br><br>Nihongonomori is a good ressource too, it's somewhat easier when a person is explaining a grammar point sometimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone correct me if I'm wrong<br><br>But I'm under the impression that that style of learning is only effective if you don't want to read/write japanese, only hear/speak it.<br><br>In other languages the two might be very closely correlated since you don't have thousands of characters to learn,<br>but it's completely ineffective if you ever plan on reading/writing it.<br><br>and most people in these threads care about reading japanese above all the other skills, so rosetta stone isn't a good option</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't do this to me. Now I want to dig deeper. Can you give me a source please? It would really help me.</br>  <br><br>Feels like we've gone through this before.</br></br>  <br>It becomes more difficult but not impossible</br>  <br>The entire premise is that it uses immersion learning - even from the very beginning. However if you're trying to build something on top of nothing it is going to be confusing at best and grossly inefficient at worse. We're not babies - we don't NEED to learn like them. Adults have the ability to think abstractly which is a powerful tool in helping to remember things (see mnemonics + comparisons), whereas babies / children pretty much HAVE to brute force memorize things via hearing them repeatedly.<br><br>I haven't used the program properly myself, so I can't comment on any specifics, so maybe look up some reviews yourself if you're interested for some reason. But based on <br> it sounds like they leave some really important stuff out right off the bat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.education.com/reference/<wbr>article/Ref_Myths_Misconceptions/</wbr></br>  <br>What the fuck is this? No, seriously, what the fuck is this shit? Trying to understand this is like looking at one of those physically impossible pictures of stairs.</br>  <br>That and the fact that spending an hour or two with a computer program isn't immersion.</br>  <br>It's comments on the passive form. The whole section is like 5 pages long, so I left out a bit.</br>  <br>But it's utter bullshit. The sentences are gibberish.</br>  <br><br>8. is the relevant one.</br></br>  <br>I haven't seen that grammar structure before either but it's in DOJG so people are going to defend it.</br>  <br>sounds like one of those technically-correct "buffalo buffalo had had had" shit that even native speakers don't understand</br>  <br>Fuck, I'm gonna need to talk to my old teachers in Osaka to make sense of this. None of my friends understands.</br>  <br>I think so as well. Similar to point 7., though I think that one is more common.</br>  <br>Can you produce another source?</br>  Now someone told me they understood it, but no one would actually use this, like ever.  <br>I've never bothered looking.</br>  <br>How do you have such good connections?</br>  <br>I can sort of maybe understand (8) making sense (and never being used), but I just cannot deal with (9). It doesn't make sense grammatically and the translation also makes no sense.</br>  <br>9 is common as fuck, though, so you best deal with it.</br>  <br> 9 is common as fuck, though <br>Prove it.</br></br>  <br>Having lived and studied in Japan for a year and never encountering a sentence of this sort once, I doubt your claim. Either provide another source or don't post.</br>  <br>Nevermind, I thought he was talking about 9. for some reason, not (9).</br>  <br>Hang on<br><br>Sorry I'm just jumping in the middle of this conversation, but does the asterisk in sentence 8.b mean it's wrong or something?<br><br>Otherwise how can it be that swapping two names in the japanese sentence doesn't swap them in the english translation?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but does the asterisk in sentence 8.b mean it's wrong or something? <br>Yes. Ungrammatical.</br></br>  <br>I've studied 1½ years at ECC language school in Osaka. Basically go out and drink with the teachers from time to time, I have them on Facebook. I've also worked in Japan for 5 months (which meant more drinking with old teachers), then I've also written my bachelors thesis, so I can always ask my old professors as well, however its a little bit late for that in Sweden right now.<br><br><br><br>9 yes, but not the (9), it's retared, even for Japanese people.</br></br></br></br></br>  In addition to studying kanji independently of vocab, should you also try to learn the kanji of the vocabulary words you learn, or should you just learn the words themselves and learn the kanji later?

In the car sentence, the friend is performing a direct action on the car, whereas in the Merry one, two passives are being stacked, which shouldn't be possible. Furthermore, in , (8) is completely different from (9) grammatically because in the former, 横に denotes a location, not another passive; thus, (8) makes sense whereas (9) does not.</br>  <br>For 2-3 days set your new cards to 0 and just review.</br>  <br>That one is a especially bad case because Aに電話する is a set expression that means "To call A on the telephone". That's why I said that  has two different uses of に in the same sentence. The first に is to mark the agent and the second に is part of the set expression. It's a bad choice of example sentence and just causes needless confusion.</br>  <br>彼は彼女に彼女の浮気相手に電話された<br>make sense.</br></br>  <br>It works for me.</br>  <br>Seems fine to me.</br>  <br>But I don't understand what purpose 彼女に serves in that sentence.</br>  <br>I think I'll do that actually.

Or archaic Japanese. <br>let's not get ahead of ourselves tiger</br></br>  <br>Okay. So your girlfriend is performing the action. The action being "you getting called by your girlfriend's lover"? What?</br>  <br>I'm just curious, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong by looking over the differences/evolution in time of the language.</br>  もしもしDJTくん僕の名前はバナアド  <br> you getting called by your girlfriend's lover" <br>Not that guy, but she called her lover. You're affected by the event, although you're not a direct participant.</br></br>  <br>The action is that she calls her lover (that's not the speaker so an adulterous lover). It's a bit tricky to translate:<br> My girlfriend called her lover and I was troubled by it. </br></br>  <br>バナアドさん、元気ですか？<br>ホモセックスしようぜ？</br></br>  <br>Do you mean "she got called by her lover"? Because in that case, I can sort of start making sense of it. So what it's saying is sort of like, "My girfriend, the rotten cunt, fucked me emotionally by getting called by her lover" And yet it still doesn't seem right because you're making it sound like direct harm to you was done by your girlfriend whereas she didn't do anything directly, she was just called.</br>  What's the different between が or は?  <br>No. She called her lover, not the other way around. The passive is to make the speaker seem negatively affected by her actions.</br>  <br> No. She called her lover <br><br>But this can't be the case. You would need to use を for that, like in the car sentence.</br></br></br>  <br>The other way around. Because 彼女に is first. Like the link from dobjg said earlier.<br>"My girfriend, the rotten cunt, fucked me emotionally by calling her lover"</br></br>  <br>There are plenty of resources for classical japanese, but the fact that you can't find (let alone read) them yourself means that they'll be useless to you at your level.<br><br>As for dialects, they're blurry and constantly changing.

It's sort of easier to understand if you phrase it as "私は彼女に彼女の浮気相手に電話を掛けられた"</br>  <br>He's got a section for Classical Japanese too.</br>  <br><br>imabi has a classical section which is rather impressive and insightful for an English language work.</br></br>    <br>バナ・アド（1949-　)</br>  I'm going to be really honest here.

I got addicted to idols for about a year, watched multiple hours of media per day and read forums, but now I'm bored of them and need something new so that I can fuel my Japanese learning.  <br>maybe you'd be interested in  実況プレイ? </br>  <br>Yeah I watched a few of those when I first started learning but it got kind of boring.

While KLK was "good" it wasn't the board consuming show that TTGL/Geass/etc... were so people were disappointed.</br>  <br>Yeah no, KLK shat the bed in the 2nd half, with shoddy animation quality, a story that made no sense, discarded plot points, retcons, abandoned characters and so on</br>  <br> retcons <br>Such as what?</br></br>  <br>Some quality meme forcing.</br>  Are you guys ready for Trigger to save anime again?  the whole thing lasted about 10 seconds and was hardly a teaser.  <br>Nah, it's a popular-type of show.</br>  <br>How did it look? Faggy looking MC? Manly MC? Female MC? Moe MC? Couldn'teventellwhowasMC? What the hell am I even watching MC?</br>  <br>The killer, and don't you dare spout some bullshit about foggy memory. That was a straight up retcon</br>  <br>How about a shut the fuck up MC.</br>  <br>What makes you so sure?</br>  <br>Nui was always the killer; her prototype designs date to a whole year before the show aired.</br>  Video where?  <br>If your reason for thinking that is the Satsuki silhouette in Ryuuko's earlier flashbacks then you are fucking retarded and KLK posters are indeed as garbage as they say.</br>  So will this actually be the Trigger Girls thing from April?  <br>No, this is an anime-like anime.</br>  <br>Maybe. I wouldn't put it past Trigger to actually go through with something announced as an April Fools joke.</br>  <br>If Trigger did anything, it's making teen and western catering casual series more popular.<br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>No MC was specified but if the first character shown was the MC, then something like a younger Dojima from Persona 4.</br>  <br>Did it really look like Persona all that much?</br>  <br>Character designs did. Looks more mature than the designs in Inou Battle.</br>  <br>Haremish or guys and girls group?</br>  <br>No way to tell. At least one female was show but there were more males presented.</br>  lolo  <br>Did it give an action vibe or a realish drama vibe?</br>  <br>No way to tell. They didn't show off anywhere near enough info. Trigger being Trigger though, I would expect some level of action.<br><br>I don't remember seeing any weapons but that doesn't mean much.</br></br></br>  <br>The show is going to suck but the shit posting should be good.</br>  I was at the panel. It looked like Persona so I expect something Persona-ish.  <br> It looked like Persona <br>That's what everyone's been saying. What, exactly, gave you that impression? The character designs? Was there something about the premise that you were able to gleam from what you were shown?</br></br>  <br>Fashion looked similar to Persona. One character looked Kanji. Modern urban setting.</br>  -Yoshinari:Working on LWA 2 until three days ago so excuse me if I’m tired.<br>Naoko Tsutsumi:Not a joke, was working on this until three days ago and worried how the final product looks.<br>-Imaishi:Was at AX five/six years ago for TTGL and was surprised by all the energy and heard from Sushio about all the energy he received and was interested about the feedback here.<br>-Everyone started chanting “Sushio”, despite Sushio not being there. lol<br>-Imaishi wanted to know what appealed to fans over here.<br>-Someone that represented the crowd stated that people had complained about the anime industry becoming stale and KLK was the opposite of being stale.<br>-Imaishi:“We don’t get that same amount of respect in Japan”. lol<br>-When Imaishi drew illustration for 3rd KLK cover, he hadn’t drawn anything KLK related for awhile so he had to rewatch the final episode and was surprised at how fun it was.<br>-They aired a G version of Sex and Violence. They cropped the shit out of it and had to take cuts out of it. lolololol<br>-“When you watch it at home, please make sure your parents aren’t home and the door is locked.”<br>-Imaishi: Asked the audience if they were familiar with Street Sharks as he had started collecting them.<br>-Sex and Violence was limited to five colors and the animators did the backgrounds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>-Every year anime gets more complicated and so he wanted to keep it as simple as possible.<br>-Waka:It might be a bit crude but we wanted a love romance between a shark and love doll.<br>-Amemiya told Imaishi that he can’t draw any of the females for Ninja Slayer<br>-Imaishi:I like drawing all these hulking guys. *sarcastic<br>-Imaishi:“Every week four or five of these characters get killed so I’ve designed a lot of these characters.”<br>-Our director Amemiya is passionate about toys, so many of the designs have holes in the back or slots of where to put batteries.<br>-All these effects are supposed to reflect the chrome color of toys.<br>-Otsuka almost cried in laughter when people started cheering for Inferno Cop.<br>-Imaishi: Maybe we should move out West.<br>-Otsuka: Worried about feedback for LWA 2 as they haven’t seen the final product (probably exaggeration). They are concerned about the quality.<br>-Yoshinari: “I just saw Ninja Slayer and Sex and Violence. Guess I’m the last fort in Trigger to save the studio from these crude animations.”<br>-Waka:I disagree. I think the cheap and high quality side can coexist.<br>-They showed the clip of Inferno CopxLWA from Animenext here.<br>-Waka: What did you think of the InfernoxLWA? *crowd cheers*<br>-Yoshinari: “I expect a lot more applause tomorrow.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> -Imaishi: Asked the audience if they were familiar with Street Sharks as he had started collecting them. <br>Sounds about right.</br></br>  <br>-Imaishi: Guess I found out Trigger is popular in America. Thank you everyone I’ll be back with a new work.<br>-Yoshinari: “Wow. Really? Inferno Cop? I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know if my talents are appreciated in the west anymore.”<br>-Naoko:Guess it’s not full of lies that Inerno Cop is popular in the west. Suppose we can tell the truth.<br>-Waka:Season 2 confirmed. Even if Otsuka stops me I’ll do it.<br>-Otsuka:We’re having a talk later.<br>New Trigger original anime shown. Only character designs and one shot of setting was shown. The character designs reminded me of Persona in that they’re all 16-17 and have that sort of casual attire that looks like modified school uniforms. The designs looked fairly serious in that there was no fanservice or anything of that nature. The one shot of the setting was that it overlooked a modern city and there was a large prominent bridge in the shot. The teaser apparently came fairly early so we weren’t allowed to ask questions on it. So probably not a Fall show.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> -Someone that represented the crowd stated that people had complained about the anime industry becoming stale and KLK was the opposite of being stale. <br> Saving anime </br></br>  <br> Yoshinari: “Wow. Really? Inferno Cop? I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know if my talents are appreciated in the west anymore.” <br>Please tell me he was saying this jokingly.</br></br>  I don't know why people still have hope for Trigger after KlK, Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer. Even if they're being retarded ironically they are not doing great works and will fall off eventually.  <br>But those are all 9/10 shows.</br>  <br>No. These are not even anime. Fucking Korra is more anime than IC or NS. They are a shit studio and every Trigger fan should be ashamed for his shit taste.</br>  <br>Then what is good taste?</br>  It is interesting to know that these creators actually acknowledge how popular they are in the West. If only there was an easy way for them to profit off of how popular it is over here instead of, you know, BDs going for $30 per episode and everyone just torrenting or streaming everything.  <br>yes he was fucking kidding, i was there!!<br>yoshinari is just joking hes just tired because he literally just finished LWA2 just three days ago.<br><br>i would know i got an autograph from him<br> i yelled out YEEART when they talked about Ninja Slayer </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Nobody cares.</br>  <br>I'd like to let you know that I appreciate your information but you're a huge autist and I'm ashamed to be associated with you as an audience</br>   infernal crap x LWA   <br>Name is Keit-ai<br><br> Keit-ai means Phone </br></br></br>  <br>ok :^)<br>i got imaishi to laugh<br>get rekt kid</br></br></br>  <br>then fuck off</br>  Reminder people don't actually hate KLK.<br><br>What you have is a bunch of newfags who came here when SNK aired, they got shit on for liking it and then they stuck around to shit on the next big show so they could fit in. Throw in a dozen or so autistic faggots who lose their shit whenever multiple threads are up and there you have it.</br></br>  The biggest plothole in Kill la Kill was the question of, how was the father able to subtly plant the seed of rebellion in a 4-5 year old Satsuki if he faked his death and ran away with a &lt;1 year old Ryuko? Yet Ryuko and Satsuki are only one year apart? I have never understood how this happened.  <br>More like never.</br>  <br> “We don’t get that same amount of respect in Japan”. lol <br><br>That's why KLK had a 13k average for a 2 cour series and as the first anime of a new studio right?</br></br></br>  <br>KlK threads were full of /co/, tumblr and reddit shit. Fuck off.</br>  <br>You got proof on that?</br>  <br>You.</br>  <br>I'm not from Reddit, tumblr or /co/.</br>  I lost faith in Trigger because of Ninja Slayer and Inou-Battle.<br>Yeah, I know they're not anime originals but still.</br>  <br> Trigger <br><br>No one cares. Its going to be shit anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it too early to make a final judgement?</br>  <br>Yes but it is never too early to shitpost.</br>  <br> I lost faith in Trigger because of Ninja Slayer and Inou-Battle. <br>They were both fun though,</br></br>  <br>For what purpose?</br>  <br><br>Inou Battle was pretty decent for a harem LN adaptation.<br>Ninja Slayer is god tier though.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything they have done is shit and I dont see that changing. I have no hope for them.</br>  <br>Just give it a chance.</br>  <br>I see Ninja Slayer as a drawn-out Inferno Cop that tried too hard, but that's just me.</br>   Not even officially revealed yet and people are already shitposting <br>If I do end up watching it at least I know in advance to avoid the threads.</br>  INFERNO COP 2 WHEN?  <br>I like the animation mix up and the switching between serious revenge story and just flat out gag/slapstick comedy.</br>  <br> Waka:Season 2 confirmed. Even if Otsuka stops me I’ll do it. <br>It's happening</br></br>  <br><br>Yoshinari is so funny. His personality is a rare one.</br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Everytime.</br>  I'm hype for some anime saving.  <br>right the second after we end ourselfes</br>  <br>BUT WHO WAS PHONE?</br>  <br>modern style anime?<br><br>about what?</br></br></br>  <br> Imaishi: Asked the audience if they were familiar with Street Sharks as he had started collecting them. <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br>  After Ninja Slayer, I can't get hyped for Trigger anymore. They're a meme studio until they prove themselves otherwise.  <br> Street Sharks  <br>ONE OF US<br>ONE OF US</br></br></br>  <br>?</br>  <br> not loving stupid 90s action cartoons <br> not getting into anime because Ted Turner said they were a blight and refused to renew Swat Katz </br></br>  <br>mfw street shark is a american/chinese/korean animation</br>  It's sad how they don't understand that people like trigger ironically.  <br>You don't seem to understanding that like is liking no matter the raisin</br>  <br>My cousin would have shaken hand with him.</br>  <br><br> Yoshinari: “I just saw Ninja Slayer and Sex and Violence. Guess I’m the last fort in Trigger to save the studio from these crude animations.” <br><br>Based Yoshinari. Love him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you slavic? It soulds that way.</br>  <br> Yoshinari: “Wow. Really? Inferno Cop? I just don’t know anymore. I don’t know if my talents are appreciated in the west anymore.” <br><br><br>I hope he said that in a joking way.<br><br>I mean, LWA2 basically exists because the first show was very popular in the west.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yoshinari Yoh is a jokester.

I really hope she makes it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want another Aijou Yuujou.<br><br>But really, I'm curious about how they're going to handle the bait and switch with the OP and ED. They're obviously going to use https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mW-<wbr>JAiZcGbU</wbr>  [ ] for the first episode, but it's up in the air if they're going to keep up the dissonance or just switch outright to a different OP.</br></br></br>  <br><br> https://<span>youtu.be/mW-JAiZcGbU?t=54  [ ] <br>Is it just me, or is that "everybody say" pronounced with much better English than usual for these sort of songs? Not important, but it stuck out for me some.</br></br></br>  <br> Hoping Kurumi makes it but not Rii </br>  <br><br>Who is holding the shovel?</br></br>  <br>I think what's most likely going to happen is that Rii will die from crazy and Kurumi will sacrifice herself. The only two left will be Miki and Yuki unless new characters join the group. At the end I think Yuki will die after maturing and acting more like a leader and Miki will be the last one standing.</br>  <br><br>They Might do the typical use it for episode one but then change it sorta thing. I mean, it really doesn't fit.<br><br><br>I hope Shovel lives more than anyone else. She deserves it, obviously i don't want anyone to die but i just want shovel to live that little more.<br><br><br>Its balancing on the table.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want them all to make it, but at least one of the four has to be sacrificed for the others to live. I just feel like it'd rather be Rii or Yuki, and I like Yuki just a little bit more.</br>  <br><br>Sasuga Shovel-kun.</br></br>  <br>Somehow I'm not getting a vibe that all or even any of the main characters will die. I think Kurumi's going to end up in a "fate worse than death" situation, and the others are going to continue to suffer.</br>  <br> canon slut <br> deserves to live the most </br></br>  <br> I think Yuki will die after maturing and acting more like a leader and Miki will be the last one standing. <br>Not before they scissor right?</br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel. I am trained in shovel warfare and I’m the top shovel wielder in the entire US armed forces.</br>  <br>No. Only Miki and Kurumi.</br>  <br><br>It's going to be Kurumi if one is sacrificed, with her personality and the fact she's already been bitten. I don't want it to be her as she's my favourite girl but, it's going to be her.</br></br>  So where do you think the anime will end? I think probably around the  helicopter crash.   <br>I could see that. They've been waving death flags for quite a while but instead of dying they just suffer more.<br><br>I'm afraid that if they go to seek help and find people from the corporation or the military they'll just capture them instead and then do experiments to Kurumi because she's infected.</br></br></br>  <br> posting the version with the scribble above "you little bitch" <br>No.</br></br>  <br>graduation</br>  <br>Im sorry or thankyou, i'm not sure what your post is directed at.<br><br><br>Shovels the most likely to sacrifice herself, definitely. But i don't want that ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rii, I'm already a zombie. <br><br>-Big Shovel</br></br></br>  I am having a boner when Kurumi zombified.  Will DameDesuYo subs be enough for this show?<br><br><br>Graduation, duh.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the fact that she was bitten actually reduces her chances of dying quite a bit, thinking of it from the author's perspective. The way I usually see these things going is that a character that was already close to death once before is less likely to die than other characters that haven't been close to death.</br>  <br> Its balancing on the table. </br>   You killed my little sister? <br> Eh, that's only a doll right? <br> You bastard! You Demon! <br>(Everyone awkwardly watching)<br>Calling it now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I'm the one who one who made the shovel version of the pasta i can do whatever i want!<br>  I-im sorry i lost the other version ;_;  <br><br><br>Oh i see.<br><br><br>She is the one who takes the most risks and stands to fight while everyone else runs, she's gonna get badly hurt sooner or later. I just hope its extremely later and that she doesn't die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What the fuck is Rize doing in this show?</br>  <br> says Rize <br> posts Ayaya <br>What are you trying to pull?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm getting sick of this design already.</br></br>  <br>Every show has their own version of ayaya, we've been over this.</br>  <br>I wonder if she ever check her own hearbeat<br>Maybe, it was already stopped long ago.<br>What I got is, her hand is always cold now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's such a shame Rize / Ayaya's VA isn't voicing Kurumi. Honestly that's exactly how I imagine her to sound.</br></br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. She's already been badly hurt. Twice, if you consider the helicopter explosion. Plot dictates it's unlikely it'll happen again, at least when compared to other characters. I think she's safe from dying for a while, at least until another character comes close to dying.</br>  <br>And everyone's sick of you, yet you still don't fuck off.</br>  <br>Bear loli will "die" and then Kurumi. Or those 3 new girls.</br>  <br><br>If her heart was beating she'd still be warm surely, it must have stopped.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>But that's one of the best designs ever invented.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those twintails aren't long or blue enough.</br>  <br><br>If Bear loli dies its Rii-san thats going down next and we all know it.</br></br>  <br>Bear? I thought pink loli was wearing a neko hat?</br>  <br><br>All darker shades of blue, green or violet essentially mean black.</br></br>  <br>How can the bear die when she is not real?</br>  <br>That would be the cliche way to go. Doing the unexpected would have more impact.</br>  <br>No no no, the other loli.  The one that's a figment of Rii-san's imagination. </br>  <br>I'm scared of Rii-sans sharp descent into guilt induced madness.</br>  <br>No, Rii's "little sister"</br>  This isn't one of those shows with rape in it, right?<br><br>I can deal with lolideath.</br></br>  <br>There's no rape.<br>Just plenty of healing.</br></br>  <br>Because the delusion of the bear loli will die.<br><br><br>Maybe so but i think its likely to happen, and it would be a good direction to go.   other than dead people anyway  <br><br><br>No rape, lots of gore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just a handful of girls living their school life.</br>  <br><br>So why isn't she wearing a  trenchcoat ?</br></br>  <br>i love shovel</br>  <br>About 95% zombie gore, but there's still that 5% to worry about.</br>   yfw you got trolled and the loli is real just mute   <br>Neither, an action ED with electric guitars. <br><br><br>They're really enjoying making their bait. This song is just silly. They might go EDless for the first episode and add to chapter 1 so they can end on the same broken classroom scene and make it as confusing as possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Looks like I need to caught up on my reading.</br></br>  <br>So fucking cute HHHHNNNNNNNNGGG</br>  <br>catch*<br><br>Damn, it is late here.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll fight you.<br><br><br>Its not cold enough for a trench coat.<br><br><br>Well shovel gets hurts pretty damn often and badly at that. Other than that the only one we've seen get hurt was Megu-nee and that was pretty bad.<br><br><br>Indeed, i love teddy bears.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I certainly would coat her trench.</br></br>  <br>Wait. In the CM, Yuki is running through the halls as the OP plays. The scene in the manga right before the tone shift is her running through the halls. What if they start to do that "first episode end of episode OP" thing like some shows do nowadays, but cut it short at the tone shift and continue from there next week?<br><br>There's a lot of ways to fuck up the tone shift and we can only hope they know how to do it right.</br></br></br>  <br>Tone shift doesn't really matter if you already know it's coming.</br>  <br>I'll take you on as well.<br>  I laughed  </br></br>  <br>It does if you're trying to do it justice</br>  <br><br><br>It won't surprise anyone who knows the manga. Hell, even the synopsis gives it away already. But it can be executed in a good way at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever reread the chapter? Even if you know it's coming, if it's set up right, the effect is still felt. Besides plenty of people will be watching it with no prior knowledge, and Lerche really seems to have played up the bait and switch with how they're advertising it.</br>  <br><br>They certainly released a lot of cute art already.</br></br>  <br>Are these the OTPs?</br>  <br>Sure, now go to /u/ and talk about it.</br>   Oh my god, Megu-nee is dead.   <br>  Not quite yet  </br>  <br>There is no way Lerche could make this scene look as good as in the manga.</br>  <br>Of course not. You should already accept that it won't be as good. Though, it can still be good in its own right even if it isn't as good as the manga. I can't even begin to imagine them getting this scene down too well.</br>  <br>I don't know how they'd be able to capture the any of thousand yard stares and faces of despair with the current anime artstyle. I'm really worried it's going to look emotionless and stiff.</br>  I only see dead people  <br>You see   Megu-nee?  </br>  <br>I don't know about that, I can feel despair when I look into their eyes already, and they're not even traumatized yet.</br>  <br><br>Only because you know what's going to happen.<br>Otherwise these would be just some cute happy girls.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know anon, those eyes look spooky in general.</br>  <br>The art looks disgusting here, those eyes man.</br>   Ruu had the bear clothes on in the flashback <br>Explain that, dollfags.</br>  These new girls will betray them.<br><br>Everyone had see this coming right?</br></br>  <br>They will sell them to raiders who will viciously rape them except Kurumi who they will kill immediately after they find out she is part zombie.<br><br>Everyone sees this coming, right?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Translations when? I haven't even looked at the raws because I'm waiting for it to be translated first.</br></br>  I hate seeing likable characters suffer.<br><br>So why do I like this manga so much?</br></br>  <br>You are slowly becoming a sufferingfag. Now go read Wizard's Soul.</br>  <br>Because they're likeable characters, and you want to see them get saved. At least I hope you want them to get saved.</br>  Today's illustration, Twitter account has reached 10k followers.  <br>Implying Kurumi wont activate her ultimate shovel skill and kill them all.</br>  How the fuck will this manga end?<br><br>Shovel dying alone?

You're a shovelfag, yet you don't know shit about your waifu. What's up with that?</br>  <br>Not knowing how the zombification process =/= not knowing about a character.</br>  <br>Well, in my defense, she's the only half-zombie so far. Also you get to know about her more as a bonus.</br>  <br>So? Colour Wars was bloody awesome waifu warring despite nobody ever using their real names.</br>  <br>Do we ever use the girls real names?<br>Monogatari does it aswell.<br><br>  these captchas get hard if you've been posting for 14 hours straight  </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd think Yuki doesn't have a nickname herself.

She's right up there as one of my favorite girls , even if I like her that doesn't mean I enjoy the material she's from. </br>  <br>Yukis been Cat-hat since the first gakkou gurashi thread ever. Why we started calling her that, i dont remember.</br>  <br>I have never seen her called that.</br>  <br>I just had to. First thing that comes to mind when walnuts are mentioned. I know, there are a lot of them, but she seems to come first. Maybe it's because of design. Can't go wrong with Tsunako, at least.</br>  <br>It isn't used as much since the like "five?" of us that used to hang out in gurashi threads, are obviously only 5 people. Though shovel and garter are still used. Cat-hat stopped being used and Rii-san was changed from Onee-san to crazy after a certain chapter.</br>  <br>Actually i think garter used to be short skirt.<br>I can't remember.</br></br>    <br>Those eyes still terrify me.</br>  <br>The more I look at those eyes, the more creepy they get.</br>    <br>Is there an animated version?</br>  <br>Needs more blood splatter.</br>  So if I kissed Kurumi would I become a zombie?  <br>Now if only every single one of those followers would buy the BDs.</br>  <br>Considering that the disease spreads through by biting, maybe, if she gives you a hickey.</br>  <br>Why does everyone love shovel?</br>  <br>She's literally zombie apocalypse Rize.</br>  <br> So did this chapter confirm zombies can catch colds? <br>War of the Worlds ending confirmed?</br></br>  <br>memewaifu<br>People just like her because she looks like Rize/Aya.</br></br>  <br> memewaifu  <br> implying  <br>She's a great character, all the love she gets is greatly justified</br></br></br>  <br>I liked Kurumi before GochiUsa had an anime.</br>  <br><br>It spreads through salaiva doesn't it, in fact to be fair if any of the girls shared a drink or something, they could start turning into zombies.</br></br>  <br> salaiva </br>  <br>She was teh rei in the very first thread, but I don't think anyone called her that afterwards.</br>  <br>The CM doesn't look like it has low budget, so that's a good sign.</br>  <br>Why is there still no PV? Isn't it going to air soon?</br>  <br>Because bait and switch.</br>  <br>Even Yuuki Yuuna had a PV though. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2<wbr>0efh7MSI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, but Yucky Tuna's bait and switch wasn't in the first episode.</br>  So how should they handle the bait and switch?  <br>Exactly like the manga.</br>  <br>The manga did it well, so just properly adapt it.</br>  <br>it maybe can do anything but can't even make a good proper emergency toilet for chineses themeselves</br>    Continuing the dump from yesterday with chapter 4.

The key visual features the little sister.  <br>Garter &gt; Psycho &gt; Shovel &gt; CatHat</br>  <br>The teddy bear appeared way before the current chapters</br>  <br><br><br>The little sister is in the key visual.</br></br></br>  <br>You had me there for a second.<br><br>At 13 episodes and a monthly manga, we're probably only going to get up to the end of volume 4 at the most. I doubt it's going to be the graduation unless this ends up being 2 cour.</br></br></br>  Let's revisit this and look at what questions it brings up and what it implies. So, first off, this confirms there's a well-funded, government-like organization around. But what's up with the box? Someone obviously collected this stuff, but what criteria did they have for selecting it? There's some random stuff in there. Broken knife, cellphone, wallet, revolver, pen, one of those squeezable food packets, and a toothbrush(?). If they're trying to simply find survivors, a lot of this stuff wouldn't help. Then, look at the helipad. There's only one helicopter we see on the 3 pads that are shown, and we get an outside view that shows that this is a large facility (all the lights are on, so they must not have power problems). But the fact they send one one pilot, with no copilot or crew, AND that he's infected, and that they don't send a second helicopter to search for him when he crashes, shows that they're probably severely limited on both manpower and equipment. Then there's the biggest question: What was their goal? Did they really simply want to save the girls? I've heard people say they were after their medicine, but that theory has some holes. First, they wouldn't have known they had medicine unless they knew that school had it beforehand. And if they did, what stopped them from going there before finding the card with their coordinates? There are three syringes in addition to the one he crushed in the box, which seems like it'd be a bit generous if they were low on supplies, so I don't think it was that. So was it really that they simply wanted to save them or what?  <br>Can the first few picture be red herring? <br><br>Like it was way way in the future/</br></br></br>  <br>It's the same gas mask.</br>  <br>What does the label on the box say?</br>  <br>Well the radio station had the exact same shelter stocked with supplies as the school so there are most likely a few of them dotted about all over the place. If they knew about the shelters, I don't think it's a stretch to say they were after their medicine.</br>  <br> 巡回発見物 <br><br>Patrol findings.</br></br></br>  I just noticed Lerche is also doing Game of Laplace this season too. How the fuck are they going to manage three shows in one season?  <br>I'm praying Monster Musume is very very low budget.</br>  <br>That's why you should keep your expectations low and prepare for the worst</br>  <br>Right. It's the one they can get away with looking like shit since the people who obsess over it will watch it no matter what. Just like Kancolle.</br>  <br>If that were the case after all, I think they also wanted to save some survivors. If they simply wanted the medicine, they'd send more people armed with better guns to subdue the survivors. As it is now it looks like the pilot just had a sidearm for a worst-case self-defense scenario. Plus, you'd think they'd purposely avoid getting medicine from places they know were occupied until after they checked all the unoccupied places. I think it's likely they had overall good intentions.</br>  <br>If there's any that needs to be low budget, it'd be Laplace. I don't want my monster girls to look like shit.</br>  After a long deliberation I've come to the conclusion that Mi-kun is indeed best girl.  <br>It should have been obvious from the start.</br>  <br>Laplace didn't require much budget from what I saw, it had some interesting visuals going on as well</br>  <br>But Kurumi has ribbons and had a crush on a boy, she has to be Chiyo.</br>  <br> tfw I might not get to watch it <br>Please enjoy it for me in case I can't make it.</br></br>  <br>What, the one page she appears in as more of a cameo than anything?</br>  <br>Don't commit suicide just yet.</br>  <br>It's not up to me, but my father is planning on throwing me out pretty soon so I don't really have much of a choice. I'm not even a neet but he wants his son to be popular and surrounded by gfs.</br>  <br>Subscribed.</br>  <br>Thanks m8, I appreciate every subscription.</br>  Anyone have a high res scan of either of these images?  <br>This is the best I could find for the one on the right.</br>  <br>I seem to remember someone posting the left image at some point, but I don't remember seeing the right one before ever.</br>  <br>Fuck you, it's the one that absolutely cannot get away with looking like shit.</br>  <br>They're like Rika and Bernkastel: the same person in different universes.</br>  <br>Stay mad monsterfag. You know you'll eat it up no matter what.</br>  <br>That's where you're wrong.</br>  <br>Even Kancolle fans agree that the Kancolle anime is shit. What makes you think Monster Musume will be any different?</br>  <br>I just want my waifu to not look like shit animated. It really seems like animating a slimegirl would be more difficult than normal characters, due to the fluidity and translucency.</br>  <br>The Kancolle anime still sold a lot. <br><br><br>But she looks like shit even when she's not animated, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br><br>Stop instigating fanbase wars you shitter.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm almost sure those gradient silhouettes made for some issues in production.   That said I want all three shows to look good but if I had to pick one to have budget issues it'd be Laplace. </br>  <br>Yeah. Laplace is a three episode rule pick up at the start of the season kind of anime, not an anticipated while reading the manga for years kind of anime, for me at least. It's unfortunate, but both GG and MMniN fall under that latter one. Really, I'd rather give Gakkou Gurashi the most budget, even if it means shittily animated monstergirls, just because GG has so many emotionally charged scenes that would be extremely easy to fuck up.</br>  <br> The Kancolle anime still sold a lot. <br>This is why Touhou is in a state of recline.</br></br>  <br>How long until ZUN hits the emergency Touhou anime button?</br>  <br>All he has to do is release every 2hu game on Steam. Instant beer money.</br>  <br>That's true, I would accept shitty monster girl if they actually managed to nail Gakkou Gurashi. I'll continue to hope both look good though even if it proves hopeless. <br>The only thing that will keep me watching Laplace is the TANOSHI and MC being a cute. Those Psychopass vibes aren't doing anything for me.</br></br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-02/sentai-filmworks-acqui<wbr>res-ushio-and-tora-gate-school-live<wbr>-wakaba-girl-aoharu-x-machinegun-an<wbr>ime/.89985<br><br>Crunchyroll essentially confirmed.

Who else can kill an entire horde of zombies on her own or stop a hit from a crossbow?</br>  <br> Problem is she'll be put in a situation where if she doesn't snap out of it, one of her friends will die, but if she does, she'll die. <br>In 30+ chapter the story has never put the main characters in such a tragic situation. There was a lot of dramatic moments, but the real tragedy centered around minor characters like Megu-nee, Miki's friend, or Radio-chan.<br><br>I doubt that's going to change anytime soon, so I don't think any of the main character is in real danger of dying just yet. Maybe someone will die at the very end though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They better not fuck this up.</br>  <br>All girls best girl.</br>  <br>I'm going to riot if things get a whole lot worse and someone gets killed or raped because the new girls betray them.</br>  <br> bear loli gets shot and dies </br>  <br> They seem to be trying to sub every first episode. <br>You're thinking of FFF, anon. They're the ones who speedsub the first episode to hook the RSS leechers, V2 the speedsub a few days later, then as soon as blue is awarded on nyaa start exponentially stalling, because fuck you.<br><br>DDY have only announced 4 shows with 1 more as a maybe.

If whatever's going to happen doesn't end with a betrayal I'll be pleasantly surprised<br><br><br>I'm a Kurumifag myself but man Miki gets great artwork</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course shovels the best, what a silly question.</br>  <br> Taroumaru </br>  Reading all this little girl suffering is great.  <br>They better had just be using him for the bait and switch and not make his character actually important.</br>  <br>Miki. Don't listen to shovelfags.</br>  <br>I think even Miki agrees Kurumi's best.</br>  <br>Of course she does, even the girls cant deny that shovels bestgirl.</br>  <br>So? Maybe Kurumi thinks Miki is best girl too.</br>  Has anyone ever called Rii-san Yuuri in the manga?  <br>Kurumi is too busy thinking she's about to die.</br>  <br>Miki did when she first came to the school but was instantly told to call her Rii-san.</br>  <br>Wrong one<br><br/></br></br>  At 13 episodes, how many chapters will there be per episode? I know that a lot of people had mentioned the graduation as a logical place to end the anime, but trying to fit in 30 chapters of a monthly manga into 13 episodes at about 2.3 chapters per episode seems like it'd be really rushing it. Plus, unlike some other manga, there aren't really any skippable chapters here. Something closer to after they deal with the Megu-nee zombie around chapter 20 would be a more managable ratio of chapters to episodes.  <br>Since the author of the manga is the head writer for the anime, I don't think they're going to be super faithful in adapting the series. I wouldn't be surprised if the only keep the main plot points as in the the manga and change the rest a bit to up the pacing. Miki will certainly appear earlier, considering how much she's appearing in all the promotional material.<br><br>So yeah, I believe graduation is going to be the stopping point.</br></br></br>  <br> Since the author of the manga is the head writer for the anime, I don't think they're going to be super faithful in adapting the series. <br>Is that how it works? I'd think that it'd be more faithful this way.</br></br>  <br> Since the author of the manga is the head writer for the anime, I don't think they're going to be super faithful in adapting the series. <br>What would make you think that?</br></br>  <br>I agree it wouldn't be the medicine since they would've busted in already if they expected the school to have it. There's two likely goals: research and labor. They indeed seem to be low on manpower, and the girls can be very useful in that area, performing duties such as nursing, cooking, cleaning, and whoring. On the research end, they're probably studying survivors and trying to advance their anti-zombie technology. For example, the toothbrush could have cells from its user for the lab to analyze.<br><br>This would make shovel a high-value objective for them.</br></br></br>  Mio Honda is perfect.

Seriously, if the manga is anywhere near as fun as this I'll definitely pick it up.  <br>Turn back while you can anon, the ride will never be finished.</br>  <br>But the ride is fun, why would I want to get off?</br>  <br>but the ride stops in the middle</br>  <br>Ah, I hear that Togashi tends to get lazy. Well it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Or something like that.</br>  <br>that's actually one of the main themes in hxh. maybe togashi just does it to justify the hiatus though.</br>  Take your time and leave the manga/99 anime for when you've joined us in hiatus hell. <br><br>Don't expect fun throughout though, it's got a deceptively cheerful tone at the start.</br></br>  Is it okay to cry during the Chimera Ant arc  <br>i don't think he should delay the manga considering how much of gon's character the 2011 anime messes up from the first chapter. he doesn't really get out of character after that but they fucked up the beginning.</br>  <br>Yeah, I've already been spoiled a bit, so I have an idea of how the show will go.<br><br><br>That arc was actually part of my reason for picking it up. Wish I'd done so sooner so I could have enjoyed the threads with /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True, op go read the first chapter of the manga then either keep going or resume the anime.</br>  <br>Alright, will do.</br>  Don't do it man...<br>I couldn't even bring myself to continue reading the manga after the hiatus was announced. Literally my favorite anime ever, I'd probably fuck it if I could. I was depressed as fuck after ep 148 for a little while... I was debating getting a hxh tattoo up until that point. So sad.</br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gD<wbr>FWHD9cm-E</wbr>  [ ] <br>F/SN UBW Dub Trailer is out, what do you think?<br><br>Original for reference:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sps<wbr>eKv7jtmY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> F/SN UBW Dub Trailer is out, what do you think? <br><br>Most of them aren't too bad, Rin's voice is god awful though.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin's voice is god awful though. <br><br>Did DEEN finally 1 up Ufotable?<br> https://<span>youtu.be/y6waJO-Oe_I?t=2m2<wbr>8s</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br></br>  YOU OUGHTA BE REJOICING BOY  <br> https://<span>youtu.be/gDFWHD9cm-E?t=1m4<wbr>2s</wbr>  [ ] <br>Random lazer in the dub.</br></br>  <br> "You have to rejoice, young boy" <br>Not<br> "REJOICE, YOUNG MAN" <br>0/10 try again</br></br></br></br>  As terrible as expected.  <br> dub  <br>Literally didn't even watch.</br></br>  So how long will it be before this becomes the next SAO?  <br>Shiou's voice gave me cancer.</br>  I think I've only cringed at a few dubs<br>Watamote, Log Horizon, and this.</br>  <br> Your FATE[sup]tm[/sup] is now my FATE[sup]tm[/sup] </br>  <br>Isn't Fate way "bigger" than SAO in Japan?</br>  <br> Shirou <br> Tohsaka <br>How could it get worse?<br><br> Archer <br>Mother of god</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dub <br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br> kotomine's voice <br><br>Literally buckets of cum</br></br></br>  <br> Bryce Papenbrook <br><br>I don't even watch Fate but holy shit he ruins everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Was it that hard to get Liam O'Brien again for Archer?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Nj<wbr>QzlV2t4w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Shirou sounds like he's constantly moaning <br> Rin sounds like she's a six years old <br> "You are to be rejoicing, boy" <br> The way english speakers can't pronouce Shirou <br><br>this is nauseating</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Holy shit that's terrible.  <br> I must sound like the coolest one <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  There's already a thread for this.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127502918 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127502918 </br></br></br>  <br>Like, I'm not even the type to really rag on dubs too much, but that sounds awful.</br>  <br> Rin sounds like she's a six years old <br>It's the same voice actor as the F/Z dub for Rin but it's a shame that English voice actors can't get into ranges like Japanese VA's.</br></br>  <br>I like Lancer.</br>  <br>OP is a meme, no thanks.</br>  <br>It's "you ought to be rejoicing", you twat.</br>  <br>It's the same voice from the 2006 series and movie too, but she sounds terrible.</br>   Any english dub ever <br><br>They can't pronounce shit</br></br>  <br>meh I don't really like that one either</br>  <br>SHEEROW!</br>  Is it time for the rebirth of Gay Bulges?  <br> Archer's Voice <br> Reen <br><br>What happen to Laim O'Brian?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Saber not having an British accent <br>Seriously, what the fuck?</br></br>  <br>It depends on what exactly you're comparing. As a franchise and anime, obviously Fate is bigger, but from anything I've seen, SAO is much more popular as a LN. Granted I've never seen any of the sales numbers for any of TM's LNs. They never seem to make the charts, or just aren't on them?<br><br>In terms of global appeal, I believe SAO is more popular.</br></br></br>   REEN <br><br>Yeah this will be great.</br></br>  <br>How do you go from that to this, I blame the director.</br>   Dub Shirou is Dub Eren is Dub Kirito <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eRw<wbr>y1Nu5Q2I</wbr>  [ ]</br>   REEN <br> Archer not Liam O'Brian <br>DISGUSTING</br></br>  <br>Type Moon's never really had any super mainstream LNs other than Fate/Zero.</br>  <br>Not bad for a dub. Rin will take getting used to, I feel like the VA voices her a little too young.</br>  <br>They all sound like shit.</br>    Bryce Papenbrook <br>Into the trash etc.</br>  <br>Liam was Kariya in Zero, funny enough.</br>  This sounds really bad. Getting rid of Liam was the worst move. Rin's voice sounds like a 50 year old. Only redeeming character is Kirei and he sounds very good.  <br>Lancer's 1 line was great too.</br>  Zero was better.<br><br>Crispin and Mercer sexy voicing against each other beats the faggot who voices every teenage male MC nowadays. And they got the same voice for Loli Rin as Teen Rin.</br></br>  Saber sounds like she's 40  <br>From what I've heard that may not really be the case? It sounded like Apocrypha was more well received than Zero was from what feedback I've seen.</br>  <br>Not his dank meme again.</br>  This is laughably bad, hilariously so. Shirou and Rin are cringe worthy. Archer passes the event horizon of bad all the way to funny.  <br> that Shirito <br>Tell my dog it was my only friend in life and that I'll never forget that.</br></br>  <br><br>meh, I think god tier saber and kotomine well make up for the shitty rin and subpar <br><br>F/Z dub is one of the best dubs IMO and I would rather it then sub so I don't know why F/SN UBW is getting shit cast, <br><br>plus we still don't know all of the voices and if it is just these sound clips that are shit, we will just have to wait<br><br>There could be more great VAs <br>and there could be more shit VAs we can only wait</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Kara no Kyoukai?</br>  Is Gay Bulges still in ?  <br>You sound like you're from reddit.</br>  <br>nice insult</br>   that lancer <br><br>So they completely missed the point of the character when casting the VA?</br></br>  <br>Painn23......</br>  <br>she is</br>  <br>sounds pretty good imo, i hope it gets on toonami so fate can get even more popular</br>  <br> god tier saber <br>Die.</br></br>  <br>A weapon...

I don't know, 'exaggerated' American accent? I suppose it could possibly be that they just kinda stand out more being juxtaposed against everything else I know to be Japanese, I'm not sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will need to watch that then</br>  <br>Zero would be better for shitposting on /co/</br>  <br>I'd say it's tied with Bo-bobo</br>  why is it in dubs they always seem to over enunciate everything?<br><br>It's like they try too hard or something.</br></br>  <br>Bryce Papenbrook as Shirou?

It's disgusting, I barfed literally. This needs to die, none of them sound good at all.</br>  <br>Ninja Slayer probably has one of the best dub to date.</br>  <br>They got Kirito's dub VA for Shirou.</br>  <br>Because they're shitposting?</br>  <br>The faggot voicing Shirou, voiced both Kirito and Eren.</br>  <br>Almost fell for the bait</br>  <br>Because dub kerrytoe is dub shirou</br>  <br><br>Why do you know who dubbed SAO?</br></br>  <br>He sounds bro to me.</br>  <br>Because it airs on TV on Saturdays.<br><br>What do you expect me to do on the weekends? Go outside?</br></br></br>  <br>It's simple because most of them come from reddit and watch anime dubbed. You should have noticed this by now but /a/ has this people nowadays.</br>  <br>not to mention, there's so many spoilers you can spoil them with.<br>UBW only really has Shirou = The Red Man.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck are those sound effects at 1:43?<br><br>PEW PEW PEW</br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I just like to compare Shirou and Kirito as characters.</br>  <br>Laser Tag.</br>  <br>I think you mean  grail aids. </br>  <br>Thank fucking god you put the original there to wash my ears.</br>  <br>If I remember correctly Fate/Strange fake vol.2 was top 3 or 4 selling LN back in May. Their light novels do pretty well despite what people think actually.</br>  <br>That's the new sound effect for Gandr.</br>   Saber doesn't sound british <br> Lancer doesn't sound irish <br>Literally shit tier. The rest of the cast is awful but those 2 could have redeemed it in a way subs can't. Is it really that much of a leap in logic to capitalize on what a dub can do better? <br>Seriously whats the point? They know they can't match up to stuff like Nakata so they need every advantage they can get.</br></br></br>  <br>This sounds like total shit. Kill youselves if you seriously considered watching this.</br>  <br>s-shirou?</br>  <br>I have yet to watch the videos but I'm going with its shit.</br>  man I would have been okay with everything but Archer sounds bad  <br> there are english dub VAs that have or can do good accents <br><br>Keep dreaming</br></br></br>  <br> Saber doesn't sound british <br> Lancer doesn't sound irish <br><br>That's actually fine. You create a bunch of plot holes if you actually try and make the servants sound like where they came from. Everyone has a funny accent except Archer for some reason. Wonder where he's from?</br></br></br></br>  <br> no based Liam as Archer <br> Shirou is now Eren <br>Do we start an online petition or something?</br></br></br>  <br>I think you meant  nasueating </br>  <br> Shirou has same voice as Kirito and Eren <br>American dub companies know when a character is shit at least.</br></br>  <br>doho</br>  REMINDER THAT PAPENBROOK WILL ALSO VOICE THE HEAVEN'S FEEL MOVIES.<br><br>THIS IS YOUR "FATE".</br></br>  This is eventually air on Toonami and the best thing about it will be spoiling /co/ fags.  &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/  <br> speaking english <br> no accents <br>Nigger I don't care if this is Japan. If you're gonna waste money on a shit dub at least put some effort into it. As far as accents go it really doesn't matter for Archer. He lost his memories or something and is generally mysterious. Unless they gave him a Jap accent along with assassin. Honestly If you left the greeks alone you can bet by with it easy.</br></br></br>  <br>F/Z Seiba is best Seiba.</br>  <br><br>I can't believe that even in something as mainstream as fucking UBW they still refuse to edit pauses in like fanworks have done for years.<br>No one fucking speaks like that</br></br></br>  <br>It's sounds like they were trying to emulate Sherou from Luvia's voice.</br>  <br>To give more time to actually talk? I have no doubt that would benefit the dub but the actors are still awful.</br>  I honestly don't think I'll ever get used to dubs. It probably doesn't have anything to do with whether or not it's good or not, but all of it makes me cringe for some reason.  <br>When is Saber going to receive an equipment remake/update?</br>  <br>It literally doesn't make sense if you think about it for more than five seconds. What would a British accent from King Arthur's era be? What's an ancient Babylonian accent? None of the characters ever bring up how the their voices sound when trying to figure out where a servant is from, so you create a plot hole by just adding that in.</br>  You really expect me to watch that shit?   Shirou <br>Decent.<br><br> Rin <br>I actually like this voice<br><br> Kotomine <br>FUCK YEAH CRISPIN FREEMAN<br><br> Archer <br>What the fuck is this trash?<br> Deen stay night Archer was perfect</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is so, so bad. It's baffling when Fate/Zero had such a good dub and parts of the DEEN series and movie were great.<br><br>Anyone who did Archer after O'Brien was going to be a step down, but the new guy is the worst guy in the entire video. Holy shit.<br><br>New Shirou isn't much better.<br><br>That voice actress has done Rin before and isn't getting any better.<br><br>I really wanted Jamieson Price to come back, but I knew it was never going to happen. Here's hoping Freeman isn't continuously saddled with lines as awkward as "You ought to be rejoicing, boy."<br><br>The only two who don't suck out loud are Dahlgren as Saber and the new girl as Illya. This is going to be a disaster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What would a British accent from King Arthur's era be? <br><br>Welsh</br></br></br>  <br>They sound awful. The main reason for this is that the VAs have zero range and can only do one voice with slight alterations. Add to that there are probably 10-15 total and you have garbage.</br>  <br> Luvia ends up being the only one that pronounces it right </br>  <br>What did they do to my poor Illya?</br>  <br>When she finally dies and becomes a real spirit/guardian<br><br><br> Shirou <br> Decent. <br><br> Rin <br> I actually like this voice <br>Completely wrong</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber Red and Saber Lily, plus what ever other Sabers the guy can't stop drawing.<br><br>Q: Why do you like drawing Saber-faces so much?<br> Nasu: I'd like to know that too. <br> Takeuchi: Huh, what's with this atmosphere? You're making me seem like I'm a weirdo, like I'm a perverse dude or something. <br> Nasu: You've been doing this for over 10 years; you're plenty perverse. "Doing what you set out to do" is a handy expression, isn't it. <br> Takeuchi: Oh man, I just got told by the guy who's still adding stuff to the Fate canon even as he keeps saying he "doesn't wanna"... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   wanting accents <br> majority of cast is Japanese  <br><br>Don't be stupid. You go all the way or not at all.</br></br></br>  <br>That's probably the very reason they didn't bring him back as Archer.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/hGLLvwaPyi8?t=5m50<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Rin's Prisma dub voice actually sounds better.</br></br>  <br>Name one thing wrong with Rins voice without using buzzwords.  You can't </br>  <br> new girl as Illya. <br>No, Illya is shit in all dubs.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hGL<wbr>LvwaPyi8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>People get paid to do this?</br>  <br>ANN doesn't post a list for monthly sales, but vol 1 of SF made it in the top half of sellers at 57k.<br><br> http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-06-02/top-selling-light-nov<wbr>els-in-japan-by-volume-2015/.88814</wbr></wbr> <br><br>That's better comparatively than all the Fate manga adaptations that get in the 30K range (HF vol 1 got 32k in it's first week which is average for fate manga, but that also isn't for a full seven days sale? I couldn't find the date it was released).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jameson Price went from Kirei in the DEEN series to Rider in Zero. Grant George went from DEEN Gilgamesh to Zero Lancer.<br><br>Bringing someone back obviously doesn't stop them.</br></br></br>  all voice actors are from valkyrie profile L O L  <br> somewhere the VA's are thinking to themselves "Man we did a great job!" <br>Disgusting isn't it?</br></br>  <br>Sounds way too soft, like a child even. <br>Seems like a generic "trying to emulate moe" type of voice they are using.</br></br>  Lancer is fucking terrible. It doesn't fit his personality whatsoever, it sounds like Deermud.  <br>What's that.</br>  <br>Tony Oliver has been voicing Lancer since DEEN Stay Night. I felt like he's done a pretty decent job.</br>  <br>She sounds like a child. Voice hardly suits the character.</br>  <br>I'm not even going to blame the voice actors, it's whoever is directing them and not telling them what to enunciate and what tone they should be speaking in. I doubt anyone has actually read or watched the source material.</br>  <br><br>Nope. It is literally a 1 to 1 what rin would sound like in english.<br><br>Try harder weebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even upset at the VAs. They aren't good but nobody could maker those lines sound like anything other than ear cancer<br><br>Who wrote this script? Who edited it?<br>Who seriously read the lines these VAs were handed and said "this is acceptable"?<br><br>I could do a fucking better job of it and I translate japanese fetish porn for fuck's sake. Do the idiots behind that script not know what the english language sounds like?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I've only heard a single line, but that doesn't sound like Lancer at all. Maybe it's just the script.</br>  <br>You can go back to reddit anytime now.</br>  <br>Please kill yourself.</br>  <br>I think I get you. Same voice but the lines I've heard in this trailer make it pretty clear the script has been pretty poorly translated. <br><br>Lancer is speaking in that stilted, mock-epic kind of way that fit Diarmuid's character but has not place in Lancer's dialogue. He's a pretty casual guy. He doesn't put on airs.</br></br></br>   Kotomine is Skullface <br> everything else is atrocious and terrible <br>I expected nothing and was still disappointed</br></br>   fighting over 'dubs' <br>what is your problem, seriously</br>  Who the fuck cares? The original voices sans Kirei were all trash anyway.  <br>Fuck off. They gave legitimate answers that most people will agree with while you're being a massive faggot. You probably don't even have ears.</br>  <br>The thing about dubs is that they need to somewhat match the mouth animations from the original. That's why you get some really bad lines in English.</br>  <br> voice is in done in some weird childlike manner <br> sounds much higher <br> 1 to 1 <br>Being deaf makes you a poor judge of dub quality anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese VA's also have to match the mouth animations of the original as well.</br>  <br> Skullface <br> not Sundowner </br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the lines are read using a story board or something before it is animated.</br>  They fucking replaced Sam Riegel and Liam O'Brien 0/10 fuck this dub.  <br>I don't see Jameson Price returning as Kirei or Grant George Returning as Gilgamesh for UBW. The guys in charge of casting must have thought that people would recognize their voices if they returned from their F/Z roles.<br><br>Also, David Vincent was Assassin in DEEN/Stay Night and Gil in F/Z.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> muh nihon ichiban <br><br>Face it, english voice fits her character way better. Japanese sounds like an oldass woman.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sam Riegel wasn't that great, even if he was better than the new guy. <br><br>O'Brien is the real loss here. He was PERFECT for Archer. How do you fuck that up?</br></br></br>  Is UTW not doing the last two episodes?  <br>Are you her dub VA?</br>  <br>Nice try though.</br>      Not a native english speaker here.<br><br>I watched the UBW movie dubbed some time ago, I thought the guy doing Shirou was ok.<br><br>Now I watch this new trailer and that's no Shirou guys.<br><br>What's your HONEST opinion about this? It's like the new guy put too much emphasis in the wrong words, like he's trying too hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>That's not even an excuse.<br><br>Performance is extremely versatile, and a lot of lines can be stretched or compressed to fit mouth movements by performance from the actors/actresses<br><br>And even within that restriction, things like "you ought to be rejoicing, boy" have absolutely no excuse. Every word from that trailer reeks of either being too literal, or being localization from the mouth of someone that doesn't know enough of the english language to localize. I'm guessing most of the translation gruntwork was done by some 2nd or 3rd generation chinese immigrant weeaboo liking in texas, and then passed over by some minimum wage college yahoo editor only checking grammar mistakes.<br><br>Japanese has an awkward predilection of indicating subjects excessively (eg. rather than "I can't move", it's "my body can't move". Rather than "I have to run" it's "my feet have to run")<br><br>Any good translator simplifies a lot of those awkward subjects because in english, fucking nobody says "my feet need to run". Yet, in that trailer alone there were several lines where an awkward subject was left in, ostensibly because the amateur on the script is too stupid or lazy to bother making it sound like english.<br><br>I almost feel bad for whoever has to actually read that garbage, because they're going to sound like amateurs spouting stilted ESL goobbledygook no matter how broadway their delivery is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/'s luck is too high for your shit.</br>  <br><br> Kirito's dub actor <br><br>NOPE</br></br></br></br>  Keep in mind that the voice clips that they use for the trailer aren't usually the final cuts. People were complaining about the exact same shit when the F/Z dub trailer was first posted, and that turned out just fine.  <br> and that turned out just fine. </br>  <br><br> god tier saber and kotomine <br>Saber was decent but far from perfect<br>Kotomine was definitely solid but he's nowhere near Joji Nakata's level<br><br>Shirou and Archer are almost tolerable, Ilya is bad, Rin is shit, and Lancer's delivery doesn't fit his character at all.<br><br>At least it's not as bad as Prisma's dub, but that's not saying a lot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>UBW Shirou did a poor job as well.</br>  <br>I think that the problem is that every american whore just has an awful voice.</br>  Does Bryce Papenbrook know where the bodies are buried or what? He's the lead role for everything now.<br><br>He's not that good.</br></br>  <br>It was a fun pairing because they're total bros in real life. <br><br>The only enjoyment I got out of watching the movie's dub was hearing them yell at each other for like 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br> Hero of Justice <br> Not ALLY of Justice <br><br>Try again, it's shit. Like all US dubs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed<br><br>The movie was shit, but the bitchfest/fight in the castle as Liam O'Archer tears into Shirou was one of the best things Fate I've ever seen.</br></br></br>  <br> Ally of Justice <br> Not Superhero </br></br>  <br>It's not really fair to compare some english nobody like cripsin freeman to jouji nakata.<br><br>We all know going in the dub won't be as good as the original, that's just a standard for dubs, and isn't really a productive avenue for criticism.<br><br>There are a lot of better ways to criticize the english kirei voice than by saying it's not as good as jouji nakata. Very few people will ever be as good as jouji nakata</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Liam O Brien is a massive loss. The fact that he probably only didn't get it because he voiced Kariya is bullshit. Who cares if it's the same VA twice? He's too good to get rid of<br><br>I'm a huge dubfag, Sam Riegel was Shirou in all the deen crap, and he was usually serviceable, and sometimes pretty good.

Are you fucking kidding me? God dammit. Why couldn't they have replaced Sam Riegel with someone who is actually good like Johnny Yong Bosch?<br>And who's the dipshit who decided to replace based Liam O'Brien as the voice of Archer with a fucking nobody?<br>Fuck I'm mad...</br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious more than anything. I've watched every episode of UBW at least three times at this point. I'm sure I'll watch it in English at some time too.</br>  <br> being addicted </br>  <br>It's really not that hard.<br><br>One viewing for the live stream. Another viewing for subs.

I watch cause I like it. There's no weird internet peer pressure here.</br>  <br>Oh really? I'll watch it again to see if I can catch that. I'm this guy </br>  <br>Some people actually enjoy watching the detail they put into the scenes instead of reading lines of text once and a while.</br>  My ears hurt.

Hell he could voice everybody and I'd still watch it.</br></br>  <br>Too bad this is another low budget shit tier job. Terrible translation. Terrible line delivery.

Voice actors just dont match the characters well. Shirou voice sounds like a decent VA, just not a good cast for Shirou.</br></br>  <br>Troy Baker doesn't to anime anymore. He only ever does MCs in video games.</br>  <br>When I heard the cast announced earlier today I immediately went to some of the dub scenes from KLK to compare. If he keeps using his Tsumugu voice instead of what we heard in the trailer, then he could be a good Archer. Liam O'Brien is still better though.</br>  Tohsaka voice sounds goddamn awful.  <br>A person of her time would not have a modern english accent</br>  Fucking terrible.

Its the disconnect non-Japanese speakers experience when reading subs regardless at how long they have been watching them. You are literally reading lines off the script then looking back at the action to see whats going on instead of it being unified and synchronous. Make no mistake, I much prefer subs now but I didn't start that way. It will never be the same as watching something in your native language. If you disagree you're simply being a fuckhead who wants to argue about dumb shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You actually have to look directly at the subs to read them?</br>  <br>Reddit really likes UBW. In fact, they probably tie with /a/ as the websites which like it the most.</br>  <br> You are literally reading lines off the script then looking back at the action to see whats going on <br>I am neither illiterate nor brain damaged so I'm capable of doing both at the same time, like most people</br></br>  <br> they even ruined his dumb chant <br>How is that good?</br></br>  <br>Nah, it's an issue of familiarity. Once you get used to it, there's not that disconnect anymore. Watch anime for a decade or two, and even if you don't know nip the subtitles will stop speaking in your mind. <br><br>Looking back and forth? Takes a fraction of a second, if any time at all. Your reading skills must suck to not be able to read and watch at the same time. <br><br><br>Dubfags trying to find excuses, but really just showing how fucking mongoloid they are<br><br><br>Well, I don't know jack shit about lebbit, so there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based Liam.</br>  <br> Dubfags trying to find excuses, but really just showing how fucking mongoloid they are <br><br>Did you quote the wrong post?</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that Americans simple aren't talented enough to do a good dub.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but the post he made makes sense. He's saying that dubfags are just looking for excuses.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say talent, there are some really good voice actors in the west.<br><br>They just aren't doing anime</br></br></br>  <br>NOT LIKE THIS</br>  <br>I love how they made a significant improvement to Shirou Emiya but they left Rin Tohsaka with the same woman.</br>  <br> they made a significant improvement to Shirou Emiya </br>  <br>Did you not here Sam Riegal?</br>  <br>I will take a fucking Teenager Mutant Ninja Turtle over Kirito.</br>  Why do companies even bother dubbing shows at all?  <br>You're supposed to be listening to the voice acting, not the script.</br>  <br>Netflix, Hulu, and Toonami.</br>  <br>Wow, he is really Kirito? What a weird choice. I had no idea.<br><br> Rin Okumura in Blue Exorcist, Kirito in Sword Art Online, Masaomi Kida in Durarara!!, and Eren Jaeger in Attack on Titan. <br><br>Do you know who they got for Lancer or Archer? I can't tell.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Autists like<br>will ear it up. And there are many like him.</br></br>  <br>Do they not broadcast things unless they are dubbed into English?</br>  <br> ear <br>eat*</br></br>  <br>Because there is a market for people who don't want to watch anime in Japanese and want to listen to dubbed anime.</br>   Kiritsugu gets based Matthew Mercer who played Leon from Resident Evil <br> Shirou gets SAO bullshit <br><br>Why is this okay?</br></br></br>  <br>Netflix and Hulu default to English, and it grabs in the normies way more than something subbed. I only remember seeing subbed anime on really high up TV channels like, a decade ago. It's either dubbed, or not on the air at all.</br>  <br>The only role he's done is this guy for klk.</br>  <br>Honestly, listening to the cringeworthy dubbed lines hurts the experience way more.</br>  <br> sticking Cristina Vee on Sakura <br>I don't know if I'm more happy that she's Sakura or mad that she's basically not on an important role until a fucking dub of Heaven's Feel god forbid.<br><br>It's so fucking hilarious how all the good ones are stuck as side characters this time around, since they are trying to stay consistent with Fate Zero. Bryce Papenbrook is a fucking faggot, and I can't believe they brought back Mela Lee and not Liam O' Brien for Archer. This fucking stinks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So far:<br><br>Good<br>Ilyasveil<br>Kotomine<br><br>TBA<br>Lancer<br>Saber<br>Archer<br><br>Oh dear god why<br>Rin<br>Shirou<br><br><br>Gilgamesh is going to be David Vincent(Jin) like in F/Z, so expect that to be bad. I hated his F/Z voice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who voices Kotomine nowadays?  <br> &gt;Good <br> Ilyasveil <br>Kill yourself. Even the prisma dub did her better.</br></br></br>  <br>Crispin Freeman (zero). George Nakata (Japanese).</br>  <br> Your Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] is now my Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]. <br><br>God damnit Seiba</br></br></br>  <br>I meant English VA, of course. He dosen't have a deep enough voice for Kotomine but I imagine none of the English dub VAs do.</br>  <br> I share a name with the guy who voices him </br>  <br>Papenbrook's a weird name.</br>  The saddest part is that doesn't matter how much we complain, Shirou will now be Eren/Kirito and there's nothing we can do about it.    <br>Shirou sounds like a literal faggot in the dub. Who thought this was a good idea?</br>  <br>God, what I wouldn't do to have a voice like George Nakata.</br>  <br>That guy is literally the voice for MCs right now just like Haberkorn and JYB before him.<br><br><br>I wish he did more anime roles, all of the ones he did were supporting roles like Schneizel and Pain, but I guess it's to be expected since he can get paid way more to do video games instead.</br></br></br></br>  Tony Oliver, the guy who voiced Lancer in the "Every time my Gay Bulge..." scene is directing the voice acting  Will this imitation surpass the original?  <br> エサinstead of 餌 <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>He was always Sasuke before that anyway. Shirou has never really had a good VA. UBW was probably the first time I thought his VA actually did a pretty good job.</br>  <br> Dub <br><br>Its shit. Only retards watch dubbed anime.<br><br><br><br>Because retards like redditors will buy their release and love the dub no matter how bad it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they still are relatively soon according to the comments</br>  Let's see what the chefs in the YouTube comments have to say about all this:<br><br> I still don't like Shirou's VA the rest are ok but the voice doesn't fit in my mind... <br><br> Not feeling this cast...None of the voices fit quite right, I love all of the actors, but not for these characters... <br><br> I love Bryce but... I don't think he'll make a good Shirou.... <br><br> Sorry Nonons voice for Rin just feels wrong to me. And my god Bryce take a break already I swear he is the new Johnny Young Bosh or Yuri Lowenthol. He is everywhere. <br><br> Oh boy...i'm not sure how to take this. I want to believe this'll be a good dub, the Zero dub surprised me with its decentness, and they got rid of Shirou's teenage mutant ninja turtle voice which is good. <br><br> But on the other hand, Archer's cool voice got taken Aut. and Shirou's replacement is...a guy that basically does every voice. Its like they got JYB for Shirou. Atleast all the other voices are carried over, which is good. I thought Arturia, Sakura, Rin and Gil's Zero english voices were good, so we'll see <br><br> Bryce really what happens to the other guy sorry forgot dudes name Bryce does not fit Shirou miscast or a rush job for Shirou. <br><br> Why do they always pick Bryce to be the VA of english dubs? He is a freakin j0ke. Always sounds like a whiny little kid. : ( <br><br> Seeing as how Shirou is a whiny character I guess Bryce fits for that. Though it might make him too obnoxious. Good to know they kept most of the dub cast from Fate Zero. Kinda bummed that Liam O'Brien isn't Archer though. Maybe the ones they replaced might do a good job. <br><br> What the fuck happened to Sam Riegel? Was he found dead in a ditch somewhere? I actually want to keep a consistent voice, but no! Dubs for the Fate series always freakin' changes now! Because now every time I hear Shirou talk, I keep on hearing freakin Kirito! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck no, he already sucks. Why didn't he get the role???</br>  You know who should Papenbrook be voicing now? Shinji, he's the perfect Shinji.  <br> Seeing as how Shirou is a whiny character I guess Bryce fits for that </br>  Is Tony Oliver coming back as Lancer? This is important, he was definitely the funniest part of the DEEN dub.  <br>You could have just said that there are retards.</br>  <br>Yep he's back as Lancer.</br>  <br>It gets better </br>  <br><br>ktkr<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eRw<wbr>y1Nu5Q2I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>   saber doesnt have a british accent <br> lancer doesnt sound irish <br> lolislut sounds older than rin <br> rin sounds 9 years old <br> archer sounds almost gay <br>atleast they did archer right</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Ready or not I will come to take your life! <br><br>At least something enjoyable come out after all of this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin and Illya need to switch places. It would still be shit though but a bit better.</br>  <br>Papenbrook is so over-exposed. I don't see how anyone could self-insert as one of the many characters that have his same voice without diluting the experience.</br>   Command Seal <br> Hero of Justice <br> The blue man... and the white man... <br> Wow, you really are an Archer! </br></br></br>  I'm going to sleep, completely disappointed in humanity.  Who is voicing Caster, Berserker, Assassin, Leysritt and Sella?  <br> Berserker <br><br>Some hobo off the street they got to scream into a mic.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck you, Rin is not a whore</br>  <br><br>The fact that Bobo-bo even got a dub should be a complete fucking surprise.

She was Romano-British after all.<br><br>Though I would admit giving her a British Accent, and Cu an Irish one would be agreeable to me. Make Gil sound Iraqi as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, as DBZ Abridged taught me, you can modify the mouths to better fit English Dialogue with only a small degree of effort in the computer. So why they don't do that more is beyond me.</br></br>   people still watch dubs   <br>I play Weiss Schwarz, so do 2 of my best friends. <br><br>I have 3 different Bakemonogatari decks.</br></br></br>  <br>That gets into editing territory, which could annoy some studios, directors, and fans. You can't exactly advertise a set as "uncut" when you are changing things around, even if it's not due to censorship.</br>  <br><br>They've done good dubs. Bebop and El Hazard.<br><br>I don't know how dubs like that can come into being given the shit state of the dub industry though. What magic formula is there to make a good dub? Anyone here have an idea?</br></br></br></br>   american anime dubbers <br> decent in anyway <br><br>They don't use the correct inflections and don't understand how to roll with the flow of words/terms.<br><br>It will never be good. Just like spongebob dubbed in spanish is probably shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone's voice is complete dogshit other than kotomine.<br><br>SHEE ROH</br></br>  <br><br>The Queen's Latin and all that jazz. If a character is English or Roman, they're expected to have a posh British Accent. It's just the way it's been portrayed over the years. Blame I Claudius for that.</br></br>  Having a chapter numbered 69 and it not involving that?

Mostly wannabe.</br>  <br> A sentai stage show? *Maybe?* </br>  Btw Gozo Shioda apparently is the founder of a famous form of aikido. Which of course, Mizuki's family runs an aikido dojo.  <br>nah, went off the context and on the zoomed out frame I recognized the kanji used for the verb "to meet" 会 at the end and figured he used the stem which changes it to adj/noun based on context.</br>  <br><br>Not when it says ＴＡＫＡＨＡＳＨＩＦＡ with a roman N tacked on.<br><br>Not sure if that's amusing or sad.</br></br></br></br>  (( GLOOM ))<br>Please pay attention while walking in the halls.

She looks like the princely type who's too uptight about the rules... perfect candidate for getting it turned on her head, no?  <br>Yeah</br>  <br><br><br>That would make everything better.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting mizuki to turn back into a boy <br><br>What are you, a fag?</br></br></br>  I'm sure others have noticed, as I have, that the storytelling has taken a different trajectory as of late. Seeing how the cover art changed for Vol6, I'm guessing he got some kind of guarantee from Jump for like another year+ or something. Hence less need for shock-value HABBENING every chapter, and more regular plot arc events.  <br>He has to be</br>  <br><br>Nonono, you're going about it all wrong.<br> Mizuki turns into a boy at the start of the play <br> Fairy God-Loki turns him into a girl for the ball <br> she turns back into a boy at the stroke of midnight <br> at the end, he has to choose whether to go with the prince or the princess, and changes to a girl or a boy depending on the choice </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not wanting for him/her to go back and forth <br><br>Are YOU a fag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I prefer cute Pussy  Mizuki.</br>  <br>Oh my god, it would be great.<br>Make it happen sugito</br></br>  <br><br><br>Someone else is gonna land the role as the prince and kiss Mizuki on stage. There's no way it's going to be Takeru.

Here's hoping this success will mean an anime is on the way.</br>  <br><br>Are any of the girls from last chapter even in the same class as Mizuki? Could we get Prince Maria or Prince Ideko?</br></br>  <br>additionally, actually I think he was advised to pick up the plot pace a little cuz he was dragging somethings out a little too long.</br>  <br> he got some kind of guarantee from Jump <br>Then we're left with naught but life's most persistent question.<br> Anime when? <br><br>Takeru will still have a role, possibly as a stable boy or some other extra.<br> end of the play <br> Mizuki is freaking out over switching back and forth and so on <br> sees Takeru <br> s/he goes right for him and buries his/her face in his chest <br> curtain </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  they're all in the same class, right? did i forget?  <br><br>My only problem with this getting an anime is the censorship, no way they're gonna show Mizuki's  Softness  on tv.</br></br>  <br>God, if this actually got a good adaptation, I could die happy,</br>  Okay. || I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story.<br>It's the story where the lost slipper fits perfectly.<br>WE KNOW! // soko ka yo?<br><br>Just going with that is rather boring.<br>Why don't we add our own twist?<br>We could make a few changes to the story.<br>-- Mizuki's Classmate --<br>-- Asou Reiji --<br><br>Ooh! That's not a bad idea, Asou! We could have a sword fight in the second half.<br>A war even!<br>Uhh I don't think we should change it THAT much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ide-chan is the princess <br> they become otp </br></br>  <br><br>Looks like we got the prince.</br></br>  <br><br>HERE WE GO I TOLD YOU</br></br>  <br>An OVA would be fine.</br>  <br>PRINCE DETECTED</br>  <br>He looks likr NTR material.</br>  <br>seriously though isn't takeru in their class</br>  <br>You mean we all may bear witness to the first gender bender manga breaking 100 chapters? Be still, my heart.</br>  <br><br>Wait, so what if this means this is an actual new competitor in the Mizukibowl?</br></br>  <br><br> male Mei-chan <br><br>Oh no, my ladyboner.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Please no.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reiji's family name is Asou. 99% sure that means Reia (genki girl at the dorm) is his twin sister.  <br>no, but someone who becomes an actual rival with takeru</br>  <br> male Mei-chan <br>you mean Takeru?<br><br>GENDER SWAPPING INCOMING</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wow, we're getting new characters all over the place. Before these last two chapters we had what, 7 or 8 recurring characters? And this is 4 in two chapters, without a need for them to be immediately relevant.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, it's interesting. It kinda makes me wonder how things are gonna get paced from here--we're going in a really different direction.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it means Mizuki going full hetero then I'm okay with multiple male suitors.</br>  <br><br>If I was to guess I don't see him actually chasing mizuki but he's there to make those that are chasing mizuki fly into jealously and rage.</br></br>  <br>not the first; not by a long shot - see Ranma1/2 150+ chapters - 32 volumes</br>  <br>He did say the idea started from a character with multiple suitors that disregard the main characters gender, after all.</br>  <br>I'm not sure Ranma falls under the same vein though. There's been a couple manga that feature regular gender swaps of the MC, but it's usually trated as just a gag, and we all know the MC is gonna end up a guy in the end anyway. Stories like Boku Girl with a permanent change aren't usually as popular.</br>  That seems like it could be fun.<br>*SMILE*<br><br>We'll decide on the scriptwriter and director after this<br>But for now I'd like to pick people for the roles!<br>Feel free to recommend someone or yourself.<br>Let's start with the role of the Princess.<br><br>*clatter*<br>HM?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck, prince-kun is qt</br>  <br><br>Aww yeah, come on Prince Ideko!</br></br>  <br>Not this shit again.</br>  <br> Ideko as the princess </br>  <br>mizuki getting the role would seriously be a gigantic asspull<br>it would make no sense</br></br>  <br> Ideko as the princess <br>She's the best candidate! She's perfect for the role!</br></br>  <br> It would make no sense <br><br>There's a god among them, anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is Loki going to be the director or the fairy godmother? Place your bets.</br></br>  <br>its what I could tell from the pictures in the cn scans on baidu for 70. Really, at this point Yamada; and Ida are just there for comedic value at this point. I really didn't see any strong competitors that would get between a takeru/mizuki end; and yumeko hasn't stepped up yet either and Mei comes in in the spring semester.</br>  Something else to note: 'reiji' means midnight. Which could have special significance considering the play is Cinderella. We'll have to see.  <br><br>It'll come to a vote and be a reverse of the last one; all the girls are splintered on who gets to be princess, the guys all vote Mizuki.</br></br>  <br>Loki is going to be fairy godmother for certain and fuck around with the play on-stage as a way of 'shaking things up'.</br>  Im calling it...<br><br>Mizuki - Prince<br>Fujiwara - Princess</br></br></br>  <br> Loki as director <br>Chaos.jpg</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck</br>  <br><br> that blush <br><br>DESTROY MODE ACTIVATE</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, plenty of the boys tried to confess to her when she was still male. It makes sense that someone would nominate her, and still more sense that she'd end up with a plurality of the votes.<br>She's also the only girl who they haven't seen in a dress, so there's the added incentive there.</br></br>  <br>He certainly seems to contrast nicely with Takeru too. Pretty boy, seems like a cool and level-headed kid.</br>  <br>I'll be honest: if they're going with the hilarious miscasting route, there's still no topping Fruits Basket.</br>  <br>but she has absolutely every reason to turn it down. but the author won't let her.</br>  <br><br>Well to be honest, so would Yamada if we didn't know about his fetish.<br><br>I think he'll have some secret that will push the comedy. Hell, he might even be a reverse trap. Wouldn't that be something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Takeru is going to be cast as one of the stepsisters for comedic value on behalf of his classmates,I feel it.</br>  <br><br>Some kind of encouragement from Fuji would get her to do it pretty easily, and that's before you're even tossing Loki into the mix.</br></br>  <br> reverse trap <br> the uniform nod <br> cinderella theme <br> reiji  <br> gets turned into a real man to further the gender bend theme </br> <br>holy shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeru is stepsister <br> ends up pulling the whole play off the rails </br></br>  <br>even so, I think Ranma is the only 100+ ch GB? though these perminent change GBs are usually way too short. I would imagine that these have difficult time generating a fan base the only thing that kept Ranma going was Rumiko Takahashi; who already had 2 wildly successful series, even that one had a rough start.</br>  <br>Takeru is not even in their class</br>  <br> has to help fix the timeline in the third one </br>  What do we have here? Was your worn-out horse-faced self just kicking up hay...<br>Or were you seriously looking to nominate yourself as the Princess?<br>Doho-!<br>Look who's talking.

While I am not at the level of Aereus as far as translating I have read it and enjoyed it several times already. I needed some reaction posts because they're funny, I laugh at them.</br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br>正 is the kanji for 5, really? When is it used that way?</br>  <br>How dare you!?</br>  Ace knew that Sabo was alive?  Everyone knew that Sabo was alive.  <br>He was speaking about rubber boi</br>  <br><br> brotherS <br><br>not brother, brotherS.</br></br></br></br>   Muh pirate family honour <br>Whitebeard killed Ace when he instilled that shit into him.<br><br>Good riddance.</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese doesn't have singular/plural, idiot. It's just a shitty translation, as always.</br>  <br>Except Whitebeard also tried, repeatedly, to get him to back off. Ace's death was ultiamtely due to him being a cocky, bullheaded and violent asshole, just like he was when he was a kid.</br>  Is Oda going to change Burgess' design now?<br><br>Or will he pull off some bullshit about his beard and hair having so much Haki, the fire didn't affect him?</br></br>  <br>Ace called whitebeard father, so that would make the other people in his crew brothers also genius</br>  <br>Yeah Shanks came barge into the ship acting like he knew what was going on but whitebeard had already told him not to<br><br>I also think Whitebeard knew the evil in Blackbeards heart but he loved him like a son just like everyone else</br></br></br>  <br><br>If he used 兄弟, then he indeed referred to more than one brother. If he used 弟, then he referred only to Luffy.<br><br>Please stop fucking spouting bullshit about a language you don't know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why wouldn't a language have words for plural or singular?</br>  We would need to see the original Japanese  <br>I think mangapanda had the right translation and he only meant his brother luffy, if it tuns out to be brothers he obviously meant his crew. At no point in one piece ace was shown to be aware about Sabo's fate and if he knew he would have told luffy already.</br>  <br>Luffy didnt seem too shocked Sabo was alive either.</br>  Is there a bigger jobber in one piece than burgess?  <br>every single vice admiral</br>  <br>Doffy</br>  <br> Luffy didnt seem too shocked Sabo was alive either. <br> I didn't read the manga <br>good to know</br></br></br>  <br> Oh god look Hancock is so strong she can make a vice admiral stab himself to stay in her presence <br> Oh god look whitebeard knocked out that vice admiral with one punch <br> oh god look doflamingo is making vice admirals fight each other <br> oh god look that mysterious pirate bart took out a vice admiral like nothing <br> oh god look law just completely beat up vice admiral vergo <br> oh god look doflamingo is sitting on vice admiral smoker <br><br> oh it's you <br> appropriate level of shock for someone you thought was dead </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sabo is the oldest of the 3 brothers, as he also set out to be a pirate before Ace and Luffy. Also, I think mangastream fucked up the translation because Ace only has Luffy as a little brother.  <br> Luffy didnt seem too shocked Sabo was alive either. <br> appropriate level of shock for someone you thought was dead <br>Do you have a split personality?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Garp is a vice admiral and he kicked marco's ass and defeated Gol D Roger all day every day</br></br>  <br>fuck off tripcunt</br>  <br>Garp also turned down an Admiral position several times, iirc.</br>  <br>do you not know what "too" is?<br><br>Too shocked<br><br>I didn't say he wasn't shocked.<br><br>I said he didn't seem "too shocked"<br><br>His shock was seemingly at a level of "Oh hey you are on this island Sabo" not "OH MY GOD SABO YOU WERE ALIVE THIS WHOLE TIME?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> brothers <br> not nakamas </br></br>  <br>He never defeated Gol D. Roger<br><br>He "cornered" him whatever that means but clearly Roger still roamed the seas</br></br></br>    Where is a proper translation and scan? It's not up on secret club yet.  <br> niggerscam being retarded <br>woooow</br></br>  Ace hung out with Whitebeard so he probably knew more than Luffy did about what was up in the world.  <br>Smoker</br>  <br>Fuck off, newfag.</br>  <br> His shock was seemingly at a level of "Oh hey you are on this island Sabo" not "OH MY GOD SABO YOU WERE ALIVE THIS WHOLE TIME?" <br> being a filthy tripfagging speedreader <br>Cancer</br></br></br>  <br>I suppose that post did come off as a bit newfaggish. I can wait but I was curious. Meh.</br>  <br>That's exactly how I look like when I see my dad home from work</br>  <br>Where do you think One Piece comes from? Have you never heard of mangastream? You are such a fucking newfag and yet you are on madokami. Disgusting. Lurk the fuck more. Hell, you don't even need to lurk, just google it, you humongous faglord.</br>  <br>Does your dad rape you or something?</br>  <br>okay I am retarded rip<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G6s<wbr>LGJVr_A4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I forgot where that face came from. All I remember is him telling everyone it was okay and tagging sabo in to replace him. I guess I will have to stop being hard on people who forget</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He isn't part of the tablet reader master race </br>  <br> little brothers <br>Christ their translations truly are bottom of the barrel tier.</br></br>  <br>How hard does he beat you up daily m8?</br>  <br> reading on a tablet when I can read on my computer <br>What do you think I am, some kind of normie with an active life away from home?  CDisplay is swell. </br></br>  <br><br>Nigga, it's fucking japanese. Instead of having an alphabet like any civilized country they draw some random lines for every "word", not to mention their autistic language being more about context than actual words. Don't try to look at japanese language in a rational way, they're fucking autistic.</br></br>   re read the chapter <br> noticed this <br><br>either this is some unknown foreshadowing or someones getting fired.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is it supposed to be?</br>  <br><br>I have no idea who that could be either<br><br>my first thought was shanks but luffy has his hat</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dont know but it highly resembles shanks during his first appearance.</br></br>  <br><br>could be a random guy holding onto luffys hat. Id have to scan chapters to see if he lost it.</br></br>  <br><br>wish I could ask oda this so he could explain but its probably nothing.</br></br>  <br>we know he took it off to disguise himself in the tournament<br><br>what did he do with it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right. That's what I had thought too because I recognized the hat but that would make no sense. Strange.</br></br>  <br>He's just a guy in sabo's crew. You see him next to the big bearish guy later when koala is talking to him on the den den mushi.</br>  <br>i just want to know why didnt blackbeard take ace fruit when he beat it in the island burgese was already in his crew it was one of the firsts<br><br>was he still incapable or was it all in order to get whitebeards, did it had any sense</br></br></br>  <br>you have to kill them to get the fruit<br><br>he wanted ace alive so that whitebeard stormed marineford THEN he could get whitebeard's fruit<br><br>he didnt want the mera mera</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He had it on his back you speed reading shit</br>  <br>Because he needs the DF's owner to die. And if Ace died then<br> no war <br> no Whitebeard <br> no Gura Gura <br> keikaku failed </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't confirm it would work until Whitebeard.</br>  <br>Because it's not needed.<br>E.g. A French guy could ask, "Why wouldn't a language have masculine and feminine articles?" about English.<br><br> Sociological answer: Because in the Japanese culture the group is more important than each individual, that's why they don't care about explicitly pointing out they're talking about exactly one person </br></br></br></br>  So what is Law and Luffy's pirate alliance named? I don't trust that shitty translation one bit.  <br><br>LawLu</br></br>  <br>The stlawhats<br><br>Pronunciation remains the same</br></br></br>  <br> not wanting to comfily read his chapters on the couch <br> cdisplay <br> cdiscount <br> 1024*600 <br> not a nexus 7 <br> is it worth 55€ ? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heavenly Yaksha</br>  <br> They didn't confirm it would work until Whitebeard. <br>how did he take all the risk if he didnt know if it works and only did it once<br>  shonen  </br></br></br>  <br><br>Put all his eggs into one basket and followed his dreams.<br><br> SHONEN </br></br></br></br>  <br> cdiscount <br> 1024*600 <br>No clue what you're implying here. I don't use a cell phone for any of this stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Besides that think about all the other progression that would happen if he killed ace <br><br><br>Without Ace alive he now becomes the focus for the full force of Whitebeard. Even with the mera mera I think he gets his Assraped by whitebeard not to mention he lacks all of the impel down level 6 people which was a huge part of his plan<br><br>Without ace alive luffy doesn't barge into impel down giving him the distraction he needs also he probably dies to magellan's hydra this time since shiryuu didnt escape. <br><br><br>Even if he some how breaks into impel down and gets past magellan the admirals are no longer occupied by whitebeard and show up and beat him and his crew down.<br><br>Ace being alive is entirely beneficial to all of his plans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>straw-heart alliance mane</br>  <br>Right up until Thatch's corpse hit the ground. Then all bets were off and Whitebeard wanted Teach's head, but was unwilling to sacrifice more of his "family" to do it. Ace was a god damn idiot</br>  <br>fuck, when i google Cdisplay, the first link was this http://www.cdiscount.com/informatiq<wbr>ue/tablettes-tactiles-ebooks/cdispl<wbr>ay-tablette-7-8go/f-10798-cdp7tab4c<wbr>8.html</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Another thing is I don't think whitebeard cares if you attack him. whether it's ace attacking him in his sleep or squardo stabbing him in the gut because Akainu brainwashed him. As long as you don't harm another "son" he will forgive you.</br>  <br>Odd.<br><br>I was referring to http://www.cdisplay.me/ It's a nice image viewer. Used it for years.</br></br></br>  Holy shit that ending was amazing<br>How many big shots will be tracking down Luffy and Law now that it's public they took down Doffy?<br>Will Yonkou's go after them to talk now?</br></br>  <br>Big Mom already has his crew kidnaped</br>  <br>The Straw Hearts</br>  <br>just add a counter?</br>    <br>and she fell in love of Sanji because she cooked some candies</br>  Where is Luffy's strawhat at anyway?  <br>Well people, it's that time again.<br>Bounty predictions.<br>Luffy will most likely get over 500 million, Zoro will get the second highest and Usopp will get the third highest because the marines will take Doflamingo's bounty seriously.<br>What about everyone else? Will Chopper get more than 50 this time?</br></br></br></br>  <br>sucking rebbeca tits</br>  Fujitora's apology would have felt more genuine if Fujitora had actually tried to fight Doflamingo instead of doing nothing. Sure, he helped delay birdcage, but he was the most powerful man in Dresrossa and unlike Sabo he wasn't fighting anyone else so he has no excuse to not fight Doffy  <br>I think the bigger question is:<br>Would Sanji get a proper mugshot now?</br></br>  <br>It'll be a picture of the fake Sanji from Sabaody.<br>Or even funnier, a picture of Sanji in drag from Okama Island (Sanji's new title will be Okama Leg Sanji)</br></br>  Why is it significant that Fujitora was being recorded and broadcasted? Is he somehow going to get lectured by Akainu for making the marines/world gov. look bad? <br><br>Can't wait till next week. I want to see what happens with this information around the OP world.</br></br>  This panel gave me goosebumps  <br> Why is it significant that Fujitora was being recorded and broadcasted? Is he somehow going to get lectured by Akainu for making the marines/world gov. look bad? <br>It is presumably completely unprecedented for the Marines and the World Government to actually apologize for anything or admit they screwed up</br></br>  <br> We're the ones who put you through this. *prostating* <br> Doflamingo revealed to the world as a tyrant and false king. <br><br>Do the math.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. The WG wouldn't even admit that the worst criminals in the world escaped prison because it would make them look bad</br>  <br>But he wasn't allowed to touch Doffy because of his shichibukai status.</br>  <br><br>Because this is the same WG that covers up every major incident and kills people over confidential information.</br></br>  <br> lectured <br><br>Is that what the kids are calling it these days<br><br>He was going to kill coby in a war for asking it to stop<br><br>What do you think Fujitora is going to get for making the Navy look like buffoons after he worked so hard to get them into shape?<br><br>not a lecture I can assure you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Never mind just making the Navy look bad, he's an ADMIRAL.</br></br>  <br>Burgess now is Kane</br>  <br>Once Fujitora tells him he did to kick pirate scum out of the WG system,Akainu won't have any complaint</br>  <br><br>He didn't kick them out though, pirates did it for him.</br></br>  <br>They can do that without looking like idiots. The WG was going to kill off moria using another shichibukai<br><br>if that's what he wanted he should have talked to Akainu prior to this.<br><br>Instead he made the WG look like dunces, failed to capture the countless people of higher importance than doflamingo on the island, and gave luffy even more stardom.<br><br>There is no way he right this off as a net positive. I went to some anime forums and there seems to be a bunch of you who think Akainu won't be pissed over this somehow</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora's whole goal is to show the entire world how useless the Shikibukai system is,being nothing but a burden. By kneeling on the ground to excuse himself for the fuckup of a shikibukai he does that very effectively.</br>  <br><br>I know what his goal is, but Akainu won't be happy with how he did it.</br></br>  <br> I went to some anime forums </br>  <br>fine some chinese cartoon commentary sites</br>  <br>he was bawling his eyes out for like two chapter iirc, when he was wearing that fish costume running around</br>  <br>Why would any language need them?</br>  <br>The original shitty mangapanda translation left me speechless<br><br> Act as your own government <br><br>I actually thought he was telling Dressrosa to go independent of the WG because the WG obviously didn't give a shit about them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that's unnecessary.</br>  Tripfag is literally 12  <br>Other languages work differently. <br>Don't make 1:1 comparisons of languages using your language.</br></br>  <br>Why would you use tripcode?</br>  any info on the next chapter ?  <br> not taking an emic stand point when discussing another language and culture <br><br>Get some education kid</br></br></br>  <br>Why does german have other grammatical rules than other germanic languages?<br><br>Because.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Sabo's crew <br><br>Sabo is not a pirate</br></br></br></br>  <br>you fucking retard</br>  <br>なぜ言語が複数または単数のための言葉を持っていないでしょうか</br>  <br><br><br>That's what I just said</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, his from the Revolutionary Army</br>  <br>それは私が今言ったものです</br>  <br>He said crew, not pirate crew.</br>   people seriously think the great Tenyesha is defeated <br><br>There's still 8 chapters to go.</br></br>  Literally what was the purpose of CP0? They showed up, did nothing, and left.<br><br>Do you think they'll come back to take Doffy into "World Government custody"?</br></br>  <br>That's one way he could go, get tried in front of the tenryuubito<br><br>Would be great karma</br></br></br>  <br>foreshadowing for their action in the next acr.</br>  <br> wanted to join the tournament for the mera mera and then shit started going down </br>  <br>This is One Piece. Literally everything is foreshadowing.</br>  <br> tfw he cornered Roger and all Roger did was invite him for a drink <br> tfw Garp refused this drink because filthy pirates are filthy <br> tfw Garp was rambling Roger just walked away picking his nose <br> tfw Garp and Roger prolly grew up together in some way </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> reading the cancer that is mangapanda <br><br> not reading based Mangastream </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece is just a foreshadowing for Oda's next manga.</br>  <br>Smoker has "cornered" Luffy many times already, I wouldn't put Garp among the likes of Roger, WB or even Shiki.</br>  So is Burgess dead?  <br>He's "KO'd" just like every other villain that gets murked. He'll be back to full health the next time he's shown.</br>  <br> The One Piece was in space all along </br>  <br>fire not actually burning people has been a staple in action shounen since forever.</br>  <br>Based</br>  So what does this mean for the other alliance with Kidd, Appo, and Hawkins? They're gonna be pissed Law and Luffy got so much done in like, two weeks.  <br>That's exactly what parallel I have said as well.<br><br> Pirates just seem to be naturally stronger than their marine counterparts. I wonder if it's a matter of ambition or something that inherently keeps them from being as strong.</br></br></br>  Now that the Shikinbukai System is going to be dismissed, what will happen to Hancock and Amazon Lily?  <br>the OP pic is literally mangastream. They changed the translation since the Op pic was posted.</br>  <br> 2 weeks  <br><br>its been like 1 day</br></br></br>  <br><br>I read it from Mangastream. Back then it had just that. See the mark on the left corner.</br></br>  <br>he is talking about the entire post time skip<br><br>No way it's been a day from fishman island to punk hazard to dressrosa</br></br></br>  <br>Say that to Sabo's scar.</br>  <br>stop this meme</br>  <br>Fire only actually burns people when the plot demands it. The rest of the time it just acts a big blunt force.</br>  <br>How do you know?<br><br>He mentioned aliance. That's only yesterday.</br></br></br>  <br>It hasn't even been night at Dressrosa yet</br>  <br>It would be pretty cool if they really were planning to take out Kaido, and both alliances teamed up to take him down.<br><br>I have a feeling Kidd, Appo, and Hawkins are going after Big Mom though.</br></br></br>  <br>Is taking down DD really that great of a deal? Of course he's a shichibukai but this is the NW, and according to Moria the WG have hundreds of candidates for that spot, maybe not as powerful as Doffy but i don't really see Kidd going all jealous, the real rally is to take down either Kaidou or BM.</br>  <br>But that's true.</br>  <br>Oh sorry, i mean the whole "it takes little to no days to get from island to island" thing</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Luffy and Law started their alliance back in Punk Hazard, they've been working as a team for awhile now actually. Between Punk Hazard and sailing to Dressrosa</br>  <br> Ryuma Spin off <br> Roger spin off <br> Norland spin off <br> Usopp spin off (If he's alive after the ending) <br> Kuma/Dragon/Sabo/Revolutionaries spin off <br> Water 7/Iceburg/Puffing Tom/Chimney spin off <br><br>Pick you're poison</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a big deal because it shakes things up, Doflomingo is a big deal in the new world and had a lot going for him on the side aside from being a king.</br>  <br>It's been less than a week in-universe<br>Pretty sure someone did the math and at most it's been like two days total</br></br>  <br>Yes, Sabo wrote a letter for Luffy and Ace after he dissapeared.</br>  <br>he still needs a crew if hes sailing</br>  <br> Yes, Sabo wrote a letter for Luffy and Ace after he dissapeared. <br>But that bandit guy saw the small ship being shot and exploding, that's why Ace and Luffy thought he was dead</br></br>  <br>But Ace was the only read it.</br>  <br>Yeah mangapanda had it right, Fire Gun Ace.</br>   all these autisitic assclowns defending jap moonrunes <br><br>Shit langauge, get over it.</br></br>  <br>Wait. What were Ace and Sabo's ages?</br>  <br><br>The letter was write before he set sail.</br></br>  <br> reading OP with shit translation </br>  <br><br>OP's pic is from Mangastream.</br></br>  <br>shit no, is from mangapanda</br>  <br><br>Look at the mark on the left corner. It's niggastream.</br></br>  <br>Earlier today, mangastream did not have the TL note.</br>  <br><br>nips and other east asians function as a hivemind. nail that stick out get hammered down.</br></br>  <br>This we will find out in 600 chapters.</br>  <br>Other languages work retarded, then, you stupid fucking cuck.</br>  <br>たわごと言語は、それを乗り越えます。</br>  <br> "Other languages work differently." <br> "Other languages work retarded, then, you stupid fucking cuck." <br>Почему ты такой злой?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> thinking small fry like Doflamingo is significant enough for 800 </br>  <br>that's just one of the revolutionaries.</br>  <br>Mangapanda has that retarded oil filter. Mangastream does not</br>  <br> doflamingo being joker isn't big enough for 800 <br> doflamingo having CoCK isn't big enough for 800 <br> law being a D. isn't big enough for 800 <br> doflamingo being a former tenryubito isn't big enough for 800 <br> gear 4th isn't big enough for 800 <br> doflamingo isn't big enough for 800 <br><br>The only thing possible is Kaidou's reveal right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Garp is nearly as much of a jobber as Smoker analogy wise. I think Roger was just as lucky as Luffy was.</br>   we're entering post-arc/pre-next arc territory <br><br>Rev up those comfy chairs, boys. World building, "what's happening elsewhere now" chapters and setup time are to be had!</br></br>  <br>Man I fucking love those.</br>  <br><br>Also knew crew member that was promised at the start of the arc.</br></br>  <br><br>They're always great cause in a span of &lt;10 chapters, they have so much reveals and information carpet bombing that it gets you all excited for the next one.<br><br>Especially with how we've been in Dresrossa for two years, it's a nice change of pace.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DD was a lot more than just a shichibukai. He was one of the biggest black market brokers in the NW and one of Kaidou's top dogs. Not only did Luffy and Law beat him but they destroyed the smile factory and freed the tontatas. Luffy has done nothing but shit in the mouths of the Yonkou since the timeskip started.</br>  <br>not one of <br><br>he WAS the biggest black market broker. From illegal arms, to devil fruits, to fake devil fruits to all sorts of creatures.<br><br><br>I wish we learned more about that then the shitty executive fights.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, 800 is when we finally cut to Sanji and the others being killed by Big Mom.</br>  <br><br>I keep thinking we won't get a new nakama until the end of this "saga." Dressrosa feels like a stepping stone (jesus considering its 80+ chapters long) and we're still in the calm of the storm that is Kaidou. I think that is where we'll see a new crew member.<br><br>That and there hasn't been major focus on a certain character in the entire arc that would warrant a big nakama flag. I mean, if you look back on it, Rebecca had one but it's too brief and with how its connected to her Kyros, the Riku family ,etc. it comes off as something for the locale than telling us "hey guys, this one is a keeper!"<br><br>I would like a new crew member though but I want a reason beyond "this guy is cool and would fit the SHs!" and Dresrossa didn't show me much characters that fit the bill. Okay, maybe Barty but he works more as a very staunch ally and I see potential with him duoing with Cabbage.<br><br>But eh, what do I know? Predicting Oda is pretty useless. They might throw us a Robin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>meant for </br>  <br> yfw 800 is when they find One Piece </br>  <br>The best times</br>  Not an expert by any means but I thought the translation would be:<br>"I beg you not tell my younger brother"<br> <br>He meant Luffy.Ace also didn't know he was alive<br>Why would Sabo tell Ace to not tell Luffy he was still alive and they met.<br>Ace and Luffy were both mourning him, there is no good reason to hold that kind of info back about "family"<br>Even Garp just randomly told Luffy about Dragon<br><br> inb4 Robin <br>She's not a bro, she was just obeying Sabo's request as Revolutionary<br>Ace would not agree to it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If a Marine actually catches a pirate, the game is over. Only a pirate that's better can consistently get away.</br>  <br>كنت سخيف غبي</br>  <br>in 800 Luffy and Dragoon finally mets</br>   Curly D. Adan <br> Edwar D. Newgate <br> Donquixote D.

There seemed to be a big hole through his chest?<br><br><br>Also why the fuck did he antagonize and want to get blown the fuck out?</br></br></br></br>  <br>100000000000 chapters later, as Luffy is running through yet another series of corridors to get another crack at the islands big bad, Doffy suddenly swings out of nowhere:<br>D: "My vengeance is at hand Strawhat! Prepare to me-"<br>L:"Get outta the waaaaaaay!" ACtivates G4 and shoves Doffy through a series of walls and into the room the big bad was hiding in<br>Big Bad: You agai- wait, who the hell is that?<br>L:Loldunno. Wanna fight?<br>How mad would you be?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So was Dolfy really stronger than all the admirals so much so that none could do anything about him on their own?<br><br>Fujitora and Aokiji seemed like they'd get wrecked<br><br>also is there anyone stronger than the admirals in the marines?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doffyfags are delusional. He is now chained with Sea Stone. He is done.</br></br>   Luffy only defeats Dolfy with help from Law and a small pirate army <br>So how the fuck is he fighting big mom or Kaidou?<br><br>I'm assuming the next arc will be an awakening arc or something</br></br></br>  <br> Dat speedreading <br><br>Fujitora alone could have ended this saga in like half a chapter and DD was fucking back pedalling against Aokiji, admirals actually fight yonkou.</br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora could not have done anything aside from dropping a big meteor on the entire island.<br><br>Aokiji backed the fuck down when Dolfy pressed forward.</br></br></br>  <br>Uchiha Madara?</br>  <br>Doffy is admiral level .</br>  <br> new crewmate could be in the Kaido arc <br><br>I can dig it, what do we have ahead of us now? Big Mom, Wano, then Kaido. If shit doesn't go down between Mom &amp; the Straw Hats, I could see her sparing some of hers for the war, other than that another sword user or a Zoan could be an option for a new crewmate.</br></br></br>  <br> This level of delusion <br><br>So you missed the part where Fuji stated his non intervention policy? Also it was DD the one who tried to fuck with Aokiji, not the other way around, guess who was the one that ran away without Smoker's info?</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Fijutora &gt; Sabo &gt; G4 Luffy &gt; Doflamingo &gt; Base Luffy</br>  <br> Fujitora and Aokiji seemed like they'd get wrecked <br> Aokiji literally made him run with his tail between his legs <br> Fujitora effortlessly stopped him from finishing Law off + told Doffy to his face that he planned to abolish the warlord system <br> Doffy <br> Admiral tier <br>Doffyfag pls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy is not admiral level<br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>read the chapter again</br>  <br>Sounds like you need to reread the chapter Aokiji and Doffy faced off, because you've got it backwards. Doffy left Smoker alive because he didn't have the balls to face Aokiji. Also Fujitora warned Doffy he should probably kill him as he planned to dismantle the Shichibukai, and Doffy didn't have the balls to take him on either.</br>  <br> referencing anime <br><br>But yeah you forgot the face and him crying the chapter or two afterwards<br><br><br>Thank you for confirming how big of retards tripfags are</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy is slightly below admiral level.<br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br> Doffy is slightly below admiral level. <br> Couldn't even take on an Akainu-fucked Aokiji </br></br>  <br> Couldn't even take on a fully recovered Akainu-fucked Aokiji <br>Fixed that as well.</br></br>  <br>There was no evidence that aokiji got weaker. he has an ice leg and arm that seems fully functional.</br>  <br>These are indeed good times. Everyone knows One Piece is at it's best at the start of an arc, the end of an arc, and the stuff that happens inbetween different arcs.</br>  Doffy was too good for this world.  <br> You're  <br><br>Fuck kill yourselve right now</br></br></br>  Why is Doffy smiling?  <br> yourselve <br><br>After you.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is an idiot but I don't understand how Ace could possibly not know that someone as famous as Sabo was alive</br>  <br>Then what scar on luffy chest</br>  why doesn't oda ever employ nice literary techniques like in medias res  <br/>  So yaksha wil replace yonko  <br>What's the deal with Doflamingo's eyes?</br>  <br><br>Wasn't Heavenly Yaksha Dolamingo's epithet?</br></br>  what would be the powers of this devilfruit?  <br>It turns you into a colossal faggot</br>  Poor Koala.<br>Sabo's a rude mother fuck. Probably a permavirgin like Luffy too.</br>   people (retards) actually believe akainu will be mad at fujitora <br>akainu is literally going to the gorosei right now and probably knows of fujitora's goal to get rid of the schichibukai</br>  <br>Bad writing is all can say Sabo was probably a last minute character rush in to fill the void of the cool older brother.</br>  <br> Sabo was probably a last minute character <br>Nah, Ace's tattoo says otherwise.</br></br>  so i'm guessing there's gonna be no post-boss partying for the Strawhats and Law?<br><br>actually I would be okay with it. Dressrosa's reconstruction should probably be a cover story instead of another chapter.</br></br>  <br> they've been working as a team for awhile now actually. Between Punk Hazard and sailing to Dressrosa <br>Did you fucking read the end of PH?<br><br>The alliance slept through one night after Law blackmailed Doffy on the raft, Doffy called back that morning, and Law said they'd meet him on Green Bit in 8 hours. The Lawhats have been together for like 2 days max.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he was hinted at during fishman island</br>  <br>Ace's tattoo was a typo originally, Oda just wrote Sabo in to make it seem like he had planned it all along.</br>  <br> citation needed </br>  <br>Akainu was suppose to have the boil boil no me but due to a miscommunication he was given the magma fruit</br>  <br>You will never have that coat</br>  <br>Nami's name was originally going to be slut, but the editor didn't agree.</br>  PLOT TWIST DOFFYS GLASSES ATE THE STRING FRUIT AND WERE PUPPETING DOFFY ALL THIS TIME, DOFFY WENT CRAZY SHORTLY AFTER BEING FORCED TO MURDER HIS FATHER THAT'S WHY HE SAYS HIS CHILD HOOD WAS HELL  <br>Nah, they're actually Bikini Top, half parts of the direct opposite of Roger's One Piece.</br>  <br>all I want is for people to stop saying inanimate objects can eat logias or paramecia fruits</br>  <br>But they can you cancerous speed reader</br>  <br>not a single object has had a logia or paramecia<br><br>we went over this. every single one has been a zoan fruit<br><br>the gun<br>the sword<br>and the pile of poisonous slime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we haven't seen any objects with a logia or paramecia fruit <br> so that means they don't exist! <br>Do you even read what you write, dumbass?</br></br></br>  <br> we haven't seen any  <br> that means they do! <br><br>there is a very specific reason we have seen it with zoans and not a logia or a paramecia</br></br></br></br>  <br> objects can eat devil fruits <br> e-except logias and paramecia because I said so </br></br>  <br>How do you reckon you control a fire sword or a lightning robe good sir</br>  <br> Ace's tattoo was a typo originally <br>Can't tell if being sarcastic or not but, no.<br>Oda drew a 'what-if Sabo was still alive" picture before it was revealed that he was actually still alive. Ace's tattoo was missing the 'crossed out S' competely.</br></br></br>  <br>It does kind of make sense. Zoan fruits seem to also give the user cognitive abilities on par with the animal it represents in addition to their own intelligence.</br>  <br>Yes. America didn't exist until 1492.</br>  <br>he is talking way way way way before marineford.<br><br>Back in alabasta about there was an SBS where oda said the tattoo artist messed up the spelling</br></br></br>  <br>But Nami is the very definition of a slut</br>  <br>No there wasn't.</br>  <br>Let's be honest, even if you had it you probably couldn't pull it off and would just look like a dork.</br>  <br>The same way fujitora controls a gravity sword?</br>  <br>She's also a bitch who beats up guys who she knows will never hit her back because Oda is a mangina.</br>  <br> SBS <br>because this is where Oda reveals all his twists and important plot points, especially if they'll be included in the manga some time later, without giving mostly joke answers.</br></br>  <br>We saw him use his powers without the sword<br><br>he was eating noodles on a ship<br><br>he summoned a meteor</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honest question. Why do you feel the need to tripfag in an anonbased site?</br>  <br>Because my mom is a celestial dragon.</br>  <br>and editor's waifu</br>  Who was more epic BTFO? Burgessfags or Doffyfags?  <br>Akainu</br>  <br>I just not have the willpower to wait until mangastream finish posting every other shit manga before uploading OP.</br>  I have no idea why Oda decided to make Jesus into such a jobber.<br><br>He gets toyed with in the arena and afterwards also accomplishes nothing except get slapped around by Sabo effortlessly.<br><br>And this is a character that's supposed to be a part of the Blackbeard endgame crew.<br><br>So far he's a joke and it he's anything to go by Blackbeard's entire crew is also a joke.<br>That's the message that Oda is getting across here whether he planned it or not.<br><br>Looking at Jesus right now he has zero threat level emanating from him. I bet even Sanji could slap him around without breaking a sweat.<br><br>I know Sabo is supposed to be crazy strong but Jesus just comes off as a punching bag joke character regardless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ace</br>   Implying she won't fight Sanji <br> Sanji won't hit her because "muh women" despise the fact thay she's a freak of nature <br> Implying Oda won't continue to shit on Sanji till the end of the manga </br></br>  <br>we might get the "well jesus was the weakest member after all" trope when the blackbeards find out he was defeated</br>  <br> Implying she fights <br>Calling it, she'll have the Violet curse; can fight but won't due to being weak as shit</br></br>  <br>Is Burgess stronger than those level 6 prisoners?</br>  <br><br>His soul is still dancing.</br></br>  <br>lot of doubt<br><br>Blackbeard specifically told the rest of his crew they were no match for ace. Jesus seems like he is no stronger than Vergo. I know the level of opponents have been different but Vergo seems more impressive actually. <br><br>Wish we could have seen some jesus vs diamante or something to get a better gauge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it obvious?<br> Everything he's ever worked for <br> Taken from him in an instant <br> Defeated by a literal plebian <br> can't possibly get any angrier </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>honnestly, I was disappointed that the S was not a typo</br>  <br>As shitty as panda's translation is, I find myself hating niggerstream's localization more.<br><br>Also with Akainu's aggressive leadership, I wonder if he'll take Fujitora's actions lightly? Makes the Marines/WG look incompetent to some degree, may fire or arrest him too.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus is a retard, admit it.<br><br>It took 3 direct attacks by Sabo before Jesus realized that he should use haki.<br><br>Jesus already got damaged before he could counter Sabo.<br><br>And Jesus doesn't even know how to keep his mouth shut so he should have 3rd degree burns on his face right now and maybe lose eyesight in one eyeball if Oda isn't a hack.<br><br>And what a retard he is. Jesus plans to use a knife to stab Sabo but doesn't even cover the knife with haki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not smiling, they've fucking gagged him</br>  <br>http://captiongenerator.com/48436/A<wbr>kainu-reacts-to-Fujitoras-Broadcast<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Sanji couldn't even handle Vergo. Dobut he can touch Burges</br>  <br>plus burgess i the one talking. burgess a shit who doesnt know anything</br>  <br>Still a little unclear if blackening is necessary all the time, I think with the Zoro and Mihawk flashback thing it was meant to imply blackening makes your haki coating hard, ie when Luffy was fighting Hody, a dude with no df powers at all.</br>  <br>we already know it's not black all the time<br><br>we saw CoA pretimeskip as invisible/transparent with the boa sisters, Sumo guy I always forget his name, amongst others.</br></br></br>  Reminder that Jesus doesn't trust Aokiji.<br><br>Reminder that Jesus cockblocks Aokiji from gaining Blackbeard's trust by talking shit all the time about Aokiji.<br><br>Reminder that before Jesus goes back to HQ, he will get assassinated by Aokiji and then Aokiji says Jesus ended up dying in Dressrosa.<br><br>Aokiji will then take Jesus's place and now no one will constantly complain about him to Blackbeard anymore since a big mouth like Jesus is dead.<br><br>Screencap this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's that, some could argue the blackening is Oda deciding to make it visible just so you know when it's being applied, though it has still been the invisible kind on occasion, ie Tashigi cutting down Monet, but it was still a while back that Oda could still have been indecisive maybe.</br>  <br> honnestly, I was disappointed that the S was not a typo <br>I still believe it was, but Oda probably retroactively put Sabo in the story based on that S and tried to make it as seemingless as possible. Consider the fact that Sabo could've been literally any known character up until his flashback appearance and the only difference would have been the amount of drama that ensued.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit this. <br><br>But there were so many fucking people in denial about Sabo being alive despite not having an on screen death and the three cups thing.<br><br>These are probably the same people who keep guessing wrong about the 'next strawhat'. (Monet, Perona, fucking Paulie)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aokiji will take Jesus' place <br><br>Aokiji confirmed for Anti-Christ?</br></br></br>  <br> They fought for approximately five seconds so we know exactly how the fight would have ended <br> The good guys in anime are never able to win a fight if they meet resistance at the start of it </br></br>  <br>see my take was there was to types of CoA<br><br>Hardening which turns things black and the aura which coats something <br><br>Since we know for a fact Haki is an expendable resource that can run out my argument was that Hardening takes more Haki to do but produces far better results.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats magma burn not lava burn... <br>thats why ace died and akoji got bleached. Magma is the exception to the rule</br></br>  <br>There is no official name, but we get by with the StrawHeart alliance.</br>  you guys have to read flames of recca if you want fire that behaves like fire <br><br>or yamamoto's sword skills from bleach</br></br>  <br> tracking down Luffy and Law <br>Does this mean the alliance needs to continue or they have to split and be every man for himself?</br></br>  <br>I thought it was on his back... But I'm not sure.</br>  So is everyone ready for them to return in the next Cover Story arc featuring them freeing Doflamingo and his Family from the marines?  <br>Fucking speedreaders. It was them who told the Dressrosa populace to not worry and that Doflamingo is still king.</br>  <br>Kicking a Shichibukai is different from abolishing the whole Shichibukai system.</br>  <br>You mean like this?</br>  <br>If he were Blackbeard wouldn't have gone through all the trouble of breaking them out.</br>  <br><br> Punk Hazard <br> after the explosion pieces of Vergo were thrown clear because he hardened them with haki <br> a part of his face is lying in the snow <br> it has Smiley's axolotl fruit stuck to its cheek <br> he eats it <br> regrows the rest of his body </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There are still people that think invisible armamanet haki doesn't exist post timeskip </br>  <br>   seamless* </br>  <br>I wish Sabo knocked him out for a long, long time if not totally killed him because if this guy finds Luffy or Law then damn. The only people with those two right now are Rebecca and Viola and I doubt they can do anything to Burgess. <br><br>I hope the people of Dressrosa know or find out that Law was Luffy's support in this boss fight.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, this might actually happen.  I hope it doesn't <br><br><br>In hindsight this was alright because of what Croc does in the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sabo was in loguetown with Dragon. He shows up on panel twice.</br></br>  <br>I hope it becomes Luffy's turf or something.</br>  <br> They fought for approximately five seconds so we know exactly how the fight would have ended <br> The good guys in anime are never able to win a fight if they meet resistance at the start of it <br>Sanji said to himself that he had no faith he could finish his fight with Vergo<br><br>I don't see why Oda would write Sanji admitting that he was screwed if he wants us to believe that Sanji would've pulled through with the power of determination, we never see Zoro or Luffy going "WHEW glad I got outta that fight!"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said it would have been bad, not that he had no chance of winning.</br>  <br>Buster call</br>  <br>Nothing. Her island is in the Calm Belt and Hancock is powerful enough to defend Amazon Lily. She just can't leave on looting sprees to other islands anymore. <br><br>At worst the WG sends an Admiral to arrest Hancock and her pirates, the rest of the girls elect another leader.<br><br><br>I don't see Sanji as stronger than Smoker. It would have been a good fight either way but the end result would be the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter?</br>  <br>Sanji had already been "beaten up" before that fight though.</br>  <br>there's a fucking watermark</br>  <br>I think he just showed up in order to establish how strong Sabo is if he can kick him around so effortlessly.</br>  <br><br> This delusion </br></br>  <br><br>You can see him in the front when Luffy is about to get executed. You also see him walking into the crowd during an establishing shot of Loguetown. This is when he's wearing his current clothing, mind you, so he's REALLY noticeable. I don't know the chapters offhand, though.</br></br>  Yonko Buggy when?    <br>Soon anon, the recent SBS had Oda saying that Biuggy can escape through the birdcage</br>  <br>Viola isn't even weak, its just that Oda fucking wrote her out of the manga after they infiltrated the castle.<br><br>After that he only used her as a plot device when necessary.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  So are there any apparent parallels between Don Quixote and his namesake?  <br>It's Chapter 99 but I don't see it. Care to help me and point it out? Got me curious.</br>  <br>he has a horse named rocinante</br>  <br>I meant relatively, she's like Tashigi in that she can at least beat up cannon-fodder characters but that's about it<br><br><br>Prove me wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br>Na fuck that burgess provoked sabo and nearly got his face crushed all for an opening to attack with his sword, sabo only lived because plot lol</br>  <br>Prove you're not.</br>  <br>Don Quixote was extremely delusional and insane with brief patches of sanity. He also thought he was a valiant knight that was always in the right</br>  <br>Implying he won't have a split okama personality like we saw ivankov vs that imple down jailer</br>  <br> Prove you're not. <br>Oda does that way better than I ever could</br></br>  <br><br>You can see him way better in higher quality scans but here.</br></br>  <br>Don Quixote was a Spanish novel<br>Doffy has a matador/bull fighter outfit (besides the feather coat)<br>Dressrosa city has a Spain theme<br>Roci (Doffy Brother) was named after Roci (the novel MC's horse)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the indication! I'll look for a higher quality scan for myself now.</br>  Was roger an actual bad guy or did he just get killed because he know about the superweapons and the void century and how to read poneglyphs?  <br><br>Roger gave himself up because he was already dying.</br></br>  <br>That's stupid why didn't he do anything. That's probably the closest Luffy's come to dying and Sabo didn't do dick</br>  <br>Yea but why were they following him in the first place?<br><br>If he was a pirate like Luffy then there really is nothing to charge him for.<br><br>I mean Luffy became a pirate at first because he punched a marine who was being a dictator in a city. Every actual "crime" Luffy has committed was because the marines were being fuckheads and not doing their job.<br><br>All of his crimes =<br>Being son of Dragon<br>Hitting Morgan<br>Ennies Lobbies<br>Impel down</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don Quixote rides the roads of Spain in search of glory and grand adventure. He gives up food, shelter, and comfort, all in the name of a peasant woman, Dulcinea del Toboso, whom he envisions as a princess.<br><br>Law = princess</br></br></br></br>  <br>Buggy got lightninged and it really looks like dragon did it.</br>  <br> That's stupid why didn't he do anything. <br><br>Because Dragon already had that shit on lock.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying that wasn't just what Oda based Sabo on <br> Sabo literally about to let Luffy die in front of his eyes </br></br>  <br>Its a pretty good read if you can follow it</br>  <br>I kinda like this. Doflamingo was corrupted from a young age to believe it was his right to become king. The way he was brought up by the Executives made him think he was in the right no matter the what he thought. <br><br><br>His appearance totally flew over my head. <br><br>Does Don Quixote (Novel) inspire a speech like the one at Marineford?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy was in no threat of dying. Dragon was there.</br></br>  <br> Because Eneru already had that shit on lock. <br>Fix'd</br></br>  <br>In a way I guess there's a scene in the novel where the MC meets actual nobels and knights and they completely crush all his hopes and humiliate him. So that could be compared to Doffy thinking that those in control determine just and what's right.</br>  SORE GA BOKUTACHI NO HARD KNOCK DAYS  <br>It's the crime of being a pirate, raising a jolly roger is declaring yourself to be lawless and not abiding by the rules.</br>  I think the most important character the government will think they have to watch out for is Usopp as most of those gladiators and pirates think he saved them all  <br><br><br>Roger's Major Crimes:<br><br>- Starting Pirate Era (Terrorist Recruiting)<br>- At least one Ancient Weapon (Weapon of Mass Destruction)<br>- Read and Distribute info about the Ponyglyph/Void Century (National SecurityTreason)<br><br> What does that make him worth?/spoiler] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck you're stupid.</br>  <br>Arlong's back. And actually powerful.</br>  <br> discussing Roger <br> posting Vista's image <br>anon please</br></br></br>  <br>Well that sure is never happening</br>  <br>He was no Luffy, that's for sure, remember Squard? Roger killed all of his nakama, that's pretty brutal and more in the line of Kaidou.</br>  <br>Luffy was not a real pirate before Impel Down</br>  <br> All of his crimes = <br><br>You missed the biggest one.</br></br></br>  <br>infinity million</br>  <br>What are the odds they're hauling away a string clone?</br>  <br>Define 'real pirate'</br>   Koichi Yamadera gets to be Corazon and Beerus at the same time <br><br>Based</br></br>  <br>wouldn't a string clone just collapse when seastone cuffs were applied</br>  <br>It would have disappeared the minute the seastone was put on it</br>  <br>Thisisn'tNaruto/10</br>  <br>I'll admit, I'm just going off of "we never saw the body" logic with it.</br>  <br>But anon, that's Bartolomero.</br>  <br>Blackbeard</br>  <br>Fair, but this is true of basically all women in One Piece. The female characters almost always get shafted from proper fights. It's not unique to Viola.<br><br>I just found it really upsetting that Oda wrote her out of the manga. As far as Dressrosa arc characters go, she definitely got some of the worst treatment. She didn't even get her own scene and flashback last chapter unlike the other members of the Riku family.<br><br>There's a lot of things I don't like about this arc but this one really bothered me. She played the most important role of any of the other Riku family members this arc but got sidelined not even halfway through. She betrayed Doffy, informed Sanji about CP-0 and the conspiracy, told Sanji when Doffy was just about to kill everyone on the Sunny, helped Luffy and Zoro infiltrate the castle, assisted Usopp in taking down Sugar again, helped locate Mansherry, fought Doffy to buy time...<br><br>but instead Oda wanted to spend more time focusing on Rebecca crying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It isn't.

There’s absolutely nothing wrong in loving a ship because they are lesbians. It’s not like straight people are lacking in representation. But a well developed romantic bond between two intriguing female characters, who share so much screen time, mutual development and love? That’s rare, and more than enough reason to appreciate a ship like this.<br><br>Straight KumiRei would still be a well-developed relationship, but it wouldn’t have piqued my interest at all. And it would change their characters; for example: Kumiko’s overt disinterest in men, and Reina’s likely self-denial of her own lesbianism, wouldn’t very well be factors to take into consideration, were either a dude.<br><br>No, Kumiko and Reina being read as lesbians is incredibly important to me, and my shipping of it. It’s not the only reason to ship them, but I’ll happily admit that nope, I wouldn’t be this emotionally invested if it was just about some straight people, or even two gay boys - there are other series for that. This is rarer, and far more personal and relatable - obviously.<br><br>I ship them because they are both girls, and girls with such shared passion, such wonderful characterization, such wonderful interactions and such wonderful development. For being girls in love. And that is a key part for me, with a relationship this rich, this rare, and this gay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have the novels been translated to English?  <br> ... <br>fuck off</br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127503820 <br/>  <br>Please stop copying text from tumblr.

It's a huge improvement even. Shuichi does nothing to the plot.

Reina loves Taki, get over it.</br>  <br>You realized that's a fanart, right?</br>  I'm so mad they changed Taki's sensei design so much in the anime.

Dont regret anything of Kumiko x Reina. We enjoyed every single time they spent together... even if Kyoani will obviously rip out our hearts at the end. I will forever be a KumiRei shipper till the end!! There's no shame in going down with honor after all we have come to get used to the harsh treatments of the anime world towards the yuri fans.Till next time my friends. A forever KumiRei shipper.  <br>tl;dr fuck off back to /u/</br>  reminder that she got the award for best girl  I want to  date  her.    I want to have a threesome with these two  <br> You will never be this happy with the fagotts. </br>    <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Spoken like a true lanklet.</br>  <br><br>needs moar fluff to be a more believable Kumiko</br></br>  Parallels  So any second- or third-years in Kitauji now were in the same middle school as Kumiko/Reina/Shuu1? Did they know each other (from the band)?  <br> waiting for shit </br>  <br>Something about pots.</br>  <br>ohmagawd</br>  <br>NO THANKS, OBOE-CHAN</br>    <br>Mizore, Natsuki, Nozomi and Yuuko went to the same middle school.</br>    What was he doing?  <br>Thank you based oboe-chan.</br>  <br>Are they celebrating that she died?</br>  <br>It's a music thing. You wouldn't understand</br>  <br>So none of these second-years were in the band? But that's weird because everyone except for Natsuki could play before going to Kitauji.<br><br>Or that all first-years knew the second-years, but the anime didn't show? But if this is the case Kumiko wouldn't even have tried to pretend that she didn't know eupho, because they would all know.</br></br></br>  <br>Hazuki recognises that hand.</br>  That transition to being encouraged and then realising she's still mad at him.  <br>he misread what you wrote<br><br>Natsuki Mizore Yuuko and Nozomi were part of the same middle school but not the same as Kumiko, Shuuichi and Reina. I don't think anyone in the band went to the same school as them. Aoi knew Kumiko and Shuuichi from their childhood though, not sure if they went to the same middle school.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait what? Natsuki hasn't played but she did go to the their local middle school. Nozomi, Yuuko and Mizore played together in their middle school. Nozomi is the girl who rallied the second years tryhards to quit.</br>  Taki is a good husband  Who's cuter?  <br>i had a laugh</br>  <br>I thought that was a picture of loli Reina for some reason.</br>  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br>      <br>looks nothing like her</br>  <br><br> Reina can't even recognize that Kumiko is nervous as hell compared to Midori and Shuichi <br> Reina encourages Kumiko in the audition by squeezing her face <br> Shuichi encourages Kumiko just by using his voice <br><br>Smooth as silk</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She looks like a playful woman.</br>    <br>Taki.</br>  <br>That makes sense.</br>  What in the ever loving fuck is this face trying to say? is it a <br> She doesn't know her own feelings  <br>or<br> I'm glad she's single <br>fuck kyaoni</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Taki-sensei's waifu on the front page!</br></br>  Best mates. <br><br>Nichijou adventures when?</br></br>  <br>Weird I like Nozomi/Natsuki and Mizore/Yuuko more.</br>  <br>Where were you when Ribbon-chan was rekt beyond recognition?</br>  <br>she looks like the kind of girl who would roll around  on blankets </br>  <br><br>Clearly the first one if you think about it since she clearly isn't aiming for Kumiko but Taki-sensei.</br></br>  <br>Imagine their sex life. <br>m<br>a<br>g<br>i<br>n<br>e</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ep11 made me think she was aiming at both of them</br>  <br>Wait a minute, was Kumiko able to play that dificult part? Taki clearly smiled because of Shuichi playing correctly but what about Kumiko?</br>    <br>Hazuki is there to explain to you what happens. She high fives Natsuki because Kumiko played her part.</br>  <br>Best one</br>  <br><br>And episode 12 reminds you again that Reina wants Taki-sensei's D. Trollish isn't it?</br></br>  <br>and episode 12 is there to explain to you that Reina would push Kumiko into a Japanese truck if she went near Taki again</br>  <br>I know, but why would they do it so fucking gay? I mean, you have them inches away from each other's face, the cheek touching, the voice acting, the hand touching. Kumiko's fucking face.<br>For what<br>damn<br>purpose</br></br></br></br>  why does Taki use his hands instead of a baton?  <br>Only amateurs use batons.</br>  <br><br> For what damn purpose <br><br>Because bait.</br></br></br></br>  Was Hazuki thinking of the impasse between Shuuichi and Kumiko or that she still likes him, here?  <br>What the-<br>I live in Peru!<br>Where the fuck are those pictures from, causa?<br>I don´t remember there being any events these past season, mierda.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has bait ever been this blunt in Kyoani? All I can think is Hiroomi talking sensually to Akihito, but he was always alarmed/annoyed. Kumiko, in the other hand, looks really into it.<br><br><br>Tranquilo papa, taba webiando.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I KNOW<br><br>I KNOW I'VE LET YOU DOWN</br></br></br>  <br>Funny. I always thought Reina reacted like that because Kumiko spent time with someone else when she wasn't doing very well instead of going to Reina.</br>  <br>Hands are usually use for choirs. Batons are good for orchestras. So it is kind of weird.</br>  <br><br>Blunt bait is still bait. Nothing more to it.</br></br>  <br>holy shit..</br>  <br>Batons are only good for very large orchestras, in which the movements may be hard to see for players at the very back. Hands are able to convey a lot more information than just a baton.</br>  <br>Was he  fapping? </br>    Taki really grilled the Trombones hard huh?  <br>He does it for her, anons.
