That sounds fucking boss) kill Hitagi when she was sleeping over? I feel like apparition logic would be "kill the girl, get the cock"  <br>Araragi would fuck up the world if that happened</br>  Jeans Hanekawa = Sex Atom Bomb  <br>good point. yeah, he'd be pretty fucking pissed. probably go full vampire.</br>  I didn't really care about cat until neko shiro, but after that arc she became my favorite character.  <br><br>Because Mistress would not wish it</br></br>  <br>Hanekawa is a good egg. Sexual angst though, that can drive anyone bonkers.</br>  <br>I want to see her wearing trouser or jersey.</br>  <br>Perfection.</br>  OK. I'm at the toothbrushing scene.<br><br>What the fuck? <br><br>I can just picture the novelist writing this and masturbating under his desk.<br><br> In B4 Oral hygiene bro. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>Karen will never be able to go to the dentist again.</br>  <br>Not without suffering major disappointment anyways.</br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br>Not without cumming in the chair anyways.</br>  Carl Gustav Jung all up in this BITCH!  <br><br><br>then create a word you fucking retard</br></br></br>  <br>Just gonna throw this out there:<br>Abhorrence<br>That's a pretty strong one.<br><br>Also, I feel what you guys have for Snake is what Christians call "Perfect Hatred". It is akin to love. It is a part of Gods plan, in that you are SUPPOSED to hate something for a greater purpose. And I'm pretty fucking sure you're supposed to hate Snake.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Father of Psychoanalysis, and every good anime ever created.</br>  <br>hey, I don´t hate her. Medusa arc was pretty fun<br>I just like the others more</br></br>  <br>I know, she's a crazycute.</br>  <br>She was pretty boring until Medusa.</br>  <br>All she needed to hear was, "follow your dreams not Araragi" <br>Could've avoided the crazy</br></br>  <br>To me it looked like she was trying to use Araragi as a bridge to coming out as herself. It looked like she didn't have the love for herself that she needed to do it. But if he loved her, then she would. Kinda sad really...</br>  <br>No matter what extra motivations or depth the one book gives her, she'd still be boring shit in the rest, so I don't care.</br>    <br><br>So /fa/ it hurts.</br></br>  <br>I have a theory:<br><br>People who like Cat are slaves to cowtits and therefore have shit taste.<br><br>Or to put it another way, I can't imagine anyone liking Hanekawa without being slaves to cowtits, and liking cowtits requires shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gold star anon.<br>You tried.</br></br>  <br> heartburn.gif </br>  I like Snail just because when she's around the writing is more upbeat, quirky and snappy, and not so much of a slog to get through. <br><br>I seriously hate most LN adaptations of anything, though. I'll stand up for Ben-to, Haruhi, Toradora and Korean Zombies but that's about it.</br></br>  FUCK. Why are there so many English wordplays in this anime?<br><br>I'm going to be over here Spanking the Monkey while you guys figure it out.</br></br>  <br> Reminder if Araragi brought Mayoi from the other route we could've had 2 snails   RIP ;_; </br>  <br>I would spank that monkey.</br>  <br><br>Her parents told her to her face that they wanted to send her to an orphanage in grade school. That was shortly after her real mother committed suicide over her bed. You don't get much worse of a parent than that. <br><br>And they wanted to divorce anyway, so it's all a wash. They were people who had no business being parents, she developed the abnormality trying to be the perfect child to avoid getting tossed out, and when she was too good at that they freaked out. Most people would laugh in the face of anyone who called them victims.</br></br></br></br>  I am literally having trouble processing this toothbrush bullshit.<br><br>Does this asshole fuck both his sisters?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I would spank my monkey all over that ass</br></br></br>  <br>Is the contrast from Bake's content to Nise's content fucking you up a bit?</br>  <br>i like the silver in her hair</br>  <br><br>My friend told me that Bake was just his own little side project that he ended up publishing. Thus, Bake should just be composed of his personal fantasies. I'm guessing he dug deeper into his fetishes for Nise.</br></br>  <br>It started with Bake but it continued into Nise. You can't stop him, anon. NisiO just keeps going. <br><br>At this point, just sit back and enjoy the ride because it's going to get Cuhrayzee.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not that we don't like Hanekawa. It's that Ararararararagi's not Juicy Yuuji from Fruity Grisaia.<br><br>Learn to smack a bitch down when she tries to boxcutter your mouth.

You know that a bunch of people find her arcs redundant and boring.</br>  <br> You know that a bunch of people find her arcs redundant and boring. <br><br>This is what I will never understand about Catfans. Are they under the assumption Cat has ever had a good arc?<br><br>Her shit is Ph scale water up in this bitch. The best things about her arcs have been anything but her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ph scale water up in this bitch <br><br>I get the gist of what you're trying to say, but I can't make heads or tails of what this is supposed to mean unless it's a reference to Tooe's speech.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>[Spoiler] crab=monkey&gt;bat&gt;bee&gt;snail&gt;cat&gt;bird&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;snake [/spoiler]</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh nah, just that she's absolutely middle ground. Boring, Plain, Generic. <br><br>When you get to PH Neutral, you get Water.<br><br>Though admittedly I couldn't think of the term PH Neutral until after I posted it so PH scale Water had to make do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa cat was good, Tsubasa family could be considered boring, Tsubasa tiger was fantastic.<br><br>I guess she gets 3 arcs because the whole series was basically her fault. If she hadn't been there Araragi would have killed himself in the gym storage room. And if Araragi didn't worship her like he did, they wouldn't have enabled each others' self-sacrificial tendencies.</br></br></br>  <br>Bakemonogatari suffered for basically being built upon the Hanekawa foundation. <br>A river of feathers does not a good foundation make. <br><br>She's in every arc and it leads up to Tsubasa Cat. Nise is the same with it's copious amounts of Hanekawa. <br><br>None of the other girls really get a chance to shine when Hanekawa is there to solve everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I never watched past the first season, where Snake seemed like the best girl. What's wrong with her and why do people hate her?  <br>Continue watching and leave this thread. It's retarded yo spoil yourself such a great show</br>  <br>She was shit in the first season. Why would you like her when she does nothing in her arc except deepthroat a snake. <br><br>If that is everything you need for a best girl then you're missing out.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep. Hanekawa is an extremely boring character outside of her own arcs. It's the role that was made for her, but it still makes you want to fast-forward the 10000th time she tells Araragi what the Right Thing To Do is. In contrast, I found the arcs centered around her to be very interesting.</br>  <br> failing spoilers </br>  <br><br>It couldn't be that great. I was wholly unimpressed. Well, maybe it gets better, but I don't care enough to bother. <br><br>Just tell me why people hate Snake and maybe I'll watch it because she's pretty much the only one I was that invested in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even within her own arcs she's boring. She's literally "Boring: the character". It's fucking amazing NisiO could develop a character who on paper seems decent enough and have her turn out so meh. <br><br>The best part about her was how she's retroactively Gaen Izuko and how that affects her interactions with people from the Gaen Network.</br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck is this? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? TUMBLR IS FUN TUMBLR IS FUN?</br>  <br><br>It's less that she was great and more that I thought everyone else sucked.<br><br>I thought all of the girls were stupid and I wouldn't get near any of them, in other words. That's just me, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you think everyone else sucked then I don't know how to break this to you.<br><br>Politely I'd recommend you watch something else because these are your main characters you gotta live with. <br><br>Less politely. You don't know anything, you don't even know you don't know anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can we agree Hachikuji and Arararagi's interactions are the best?  Were always fun, I still miss her.   <br>The only one you were invested in was the generic harem kouhai-type? I guess Monogatari isn't for you if you don't like characters that will occasionally piss you off.<br><br>If it's not bait, here's why people don't like her: her cutesy persona is just a front that she uses to avoid meaningful relationships with others because she's actually wholly uninterested in anyone except Araragi (who is more like something she puts on a pedestal as part of her delusions). Once she finds out that Araragi has a girlfriend she starts losing it and eventually tries to kill him by swallowing a charm and turning into a snake god. She ends up holed up in the shrine outside of town as its new resident god and plans to kill Araragi and all of his friend's once they graduate.</br></br></br>  K A I K I<br>A <br>I <br>K<br>I</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't find her boring in her own arcs, but I guess that's just a matter of taste. Have you read the LNs? Maybe my impression is skewed by those.</br>    <br>Hachikuji and Shuraragi's interactions were basically just Nisio talking to himself  so yeah, they were great .</br>  <br>Within her own arcs she still suffers from not being a particularly enjoyable read. <br>She's at her best in the commentaries when playing off Senjougahara and Ougi. <br><br>She's very...useless (?) as a protagonist. She needs to take a book out of Gaen Ex Machina's book and just become a background force. <br><br>Maybe start up the Hanekawa Network which takes the Gaen concept of making "Friends" and combines it with the Oshino school of helping people achieve balance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is kill</br>  <br><br>Reading comprehension. You'd think you'd have it since you watch this show, but somehow you don't and that depresses me.<br><br> I'd recommend you watch something else <br><br>I was doing that already.<br><br> you don't even know you don't know anything. <br><br>Yes I do.<br><br>Literally this one line for both:<br> Well, maybe it gets better, but I don't care enough to bother.  <br><br>Get it together Anon. That wasn't my question at all.<br><br><br> The only one you were invested in was the generic harem kouhai-type <br><br>Actually, it's because  I like snakes. <br><br>The sheer amount of apathy I felt for the scenarios presented in this show is probably unfathomable to a fan of it.<br><br> If it's not bait, etc. <br><br>Wow, that actually sounds fucking amazing though, specifically because the maximum amount of entertainment the other characters could bring me is in their deaths. Ah, I guess that sounds really edgy, though. Oh well.<br><br>It'd be nice if she won, but I know she won't because nisioisin is kind of a fag that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree about the commentaries. I like how she can't handle Kanbaru at all and how she fucks with Araragi for 20 minutes straight in Bake 15.</br>  <br><br>Hey, hey, let me tell you why I think every character in this show is stupid and I don't understand why people like them.<br><br> Which isn't to say it's necessarily bad. Just that I think this way. <br><br> Araragi <br>is actually a decent attempt at having a character in between the two extremes of harem lead protagonist, trying to balance the total bitch with the total badass. I still think he's too much of a bitch, though, and is way too fucking stupid to be alive.<br><br> Hitagi <br>is a cunt. She's just a bitch. It's like... take the worst parts of kuudere and have her try to pretend to be tsundere sometimes and yandere once and it's like... How does anyone like someone who is like this? How does anyone think this is a good character? Why does anyone care why she became a bitchcunt? Is it because she has an attractive character design? And none of her teasing is attractive. It's trying so hard to be clever it's actually kind of annoying.<br><br> Mayoi <br>has a shitty, overly plain design. Does nothing of interest. We're expected to feel sorry for her because she didn't know she was dead. Christ, just pass on, no one cares about you.<br><br> Suruga <br>is a hilarious fake lesbian who wants to cuck the main protagonist for absolutely no good reason over a bitchcunt like Shenjougahara.<br><br> Nadeko <br>does literally fucking nothing but be a victim, so she's completely useless, but at least she's not terrible.<br><br> Tsubasa <br>is this fucking hurr durr "perfect woman" who appears to give THE BEST ADVICES but really contributes absolutely nothing because she says some of the most vapid, obvious shit imaginable.<br><br> Shinobu <br>does nothing but be a sexier loli than Mayoi.<br><br>seriously though<br>it's not like the dialogue is funny<br>it's not like their backstories make it worth watching what shitty people they are<br>how does anyone care about these people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> snake is the only good character every other character is shit <br>man what the fuck<br><br>This thread is going to go downhill fast</br></br></br></br>  <br> No one cares about Mayoi <br>Hey, fuck you</br></br>  <br>Don't take this as an insult, but you obviously have no appreciation for the amount of subtlety that Monogatari characters are designed to have. You're literally listing off the first impression you get from each character and assuming that's the whole character.<br> and I'm not saying that makes them necessarily good, just that the show clearly isn't for you. .</br></br>   be birdfag <br> can ignore all of this shitposting <br><br>Feels fantastic.</br></br></br>  <br>She had the best OP</br>  <br>It's because people are replying to bait/a retard.</br>  <br>Sounds about right.<br><br>I think we can all agree that snakefags are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be honest, I don't even think Snake is actually a good character.<br><br>I legitimately just like snake symbolism, even if I think in this capacity it was actually just garbage.<br><br><br><br>See, that's the thing though. Throughout typing all that, I was thinking "frankly, they had fitting backstories that matched their characterization." But I ended up deciding, "it doesn't actually matter." Nothing about their dialogue or their involved histories and mental traumas is actually that impressive or interesting. They're really just a bunch of cunts, frankly.<br><br>Actually, you know what, I'm somewhat playing dumb. I spoiled myself on the vampire fuckery plot a long time ago.<br><br>"Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade."<br><br>Who the fuck ever names a character that.<br><br>First time I read that I stopped for a second and was like "okay, it's obviously intentional, I'll just accept it for what it is." And yeah nisioisin WAS doing something with it, kind of, but it's still retarded.<br><br>So now? No, fuck that. The series is actually meant to be taken seriously in any emotional capacity and it has that in it.<br><br>Fucking post the gif of Hanekawa breaking down. Oh, so dramatic. Fucking boring cunt had her feelings hurt. So triggered. Yeah, I know the "perfect woman" shit is just stupid idolization put up by Ararararafaggot because he's a moron. It doesn't matter, the narrative practically portrays her as such anyway.<br><br>But even if I could give a shit about her, this setting has Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade in it. She becomes a loli? Why? Ecchi scenes.<br><br>That's literally what this is. A glorified ecchi anime with characters that are more bittersweet than the typical drivel to rope people into thinking the plot matters. Toothbrush scenes matter.<br><br>You are absolutely right. I've no appreciation for the subtlety that the characters are designed to have. I see right through it. I don't care. Their inner turmoil doesn't actually make their superficial idiocy any less grating.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tl;dr</br>  <br><br>I'm whining about shit I don't even watch because I'm a douche.</br></br>  <br>Nice trips. More drama cd art.</br>  <br>ayyyy<br>post some more<br><br>It's not that he didn't watch it<br>i bet he did<br>but i mean he probably didn't internalize it really well. That's okay, I've watched a bunch of shit that makes no fucking sense to me  Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei  and has kinda given me a lower opinion of it since I'm just judging at face value</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Characters also change throughout the series, but if you're so thin-skinned that characters being bitchy triggers you then you shouldn't watch the rest.</br>  <br><br>No, that's literally me.<br><br>I'm the same guy admitting I'm a douche for coming into a thread and complaining about a show I don't even like.<br><br>I'm not even taking it at face value. Of what I watched, I understood the intricacies beyond the superficial exchanges of the show regarding the emotional states of each character. I'm just wholly unimpressed and still think the characters are mostly melodramatic idiots whose stories aren't actually interesting and whose dialogue is shoddy. I think the way Oddities are portrayed makes them incredibly weak and exceptionally lazy plot devices. In many ways, it really is a glorified ecchi show.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you couldn't find anything of sustenance than not sure what to say. <br>Could go on about what I find interesting and enjoyable about the show but that'd be a little bit irrelevant. If you can't enjoy the show, move on and watch something else. I mean that in the least offensive way, Monogatari is one of Shaft's more avant-garde works.</br></br>  <br>I don't know of any more drama cd art. Here's some more random official art.<br><br><br>I actually feel that way about Bake to some degree: you get to meet all the characters and they're interesting to me (maybe not to you, but whatever), but they don't really do anything with all that characterization. It's really only in Second Season that they start to change themselves and grow out of their old personalities and restrictions.</br></br></br></br>  When are we going to get the spoilers for the new chapter? Only 4 days to go before the chapter is officially out in Nippon.  <br>I'm not even sure whether we're going to get the RAW in time.</br>  <br>Does anyone even care at this point?<br>The manga turned to shit ages ago, probably around the change to monthly.<br> Admittedly, the Alma flash back was pretty good, but it took so fucking long. </br></br></br>  Last i remember the loli Noah died, did she really?  <br>I liked the art when it turned monthly, but goddamn I can't understand shit anymore so much is happening. Will this be monthly again?</br>  <br>She's de-stabilized or something.</br>  <br>No, apparently she just had her "dream" broken, whatever that means. Tiki confirmed she didn't die since their Noah memories will know.<br><br>That said I miss RoadXAllen. Base on the snippets of flashbacks we got we knew she covered for the 14th, so hopefully we get to know more about that soon.</br></br></br>  <br>A re-read before it comes back might be nessasry, I just marathoned it and it makes more sense than I remember reading the first time. Make switching to monthly makes the chapters take too long that we can't remember what happened well enough to understand.</br>  <br>She's the oldest and most important Noah. What do you think?</br>  <br>If she dies another one just gets found so does it really matter?</br>  <br>She might not be a Loli this time of course it does</br>  <br>Well yes, seeing as Road was the only one who survived when Neah betrayed their ass and knows alot of shit that she's keeping to herself.</br>  Do we know if any scanlating group is picking this up? It's only 4 chapters a year after all, hopefully some decent group will do it.  <br>How big are the releases?</br>  <br>What do you mean, how many pages the chapter have? If so we have no idea, it wasn't mentioned. Atleast 30 for sure.</br>  <br>Well it would suck if its only in the 30~ pages range sinces around 2-3 weeks worth but still better than what we got for years i guess.</br>  <br>Last time she came out of hiatus, the time she switched over to monthly officially, we got a 50 page chapter.</br>  <br>I'm not sure if I'm ready to get back into D.Gray-Man. I've forgotten so much!</br>  <br>At this point, I'd have to re-read the entire thing to know what's going on.</br>  <br>I just re-read it and I have to say it wasn't that bad I got into it almost from chapter 1.</br>  <br>This. It's a pretty good shonen manga if you ask me.</br>  <br>Spoilers are usually out prior the official release 3-4 days. <br><br>Chapter 218 spoilers were out on 30th, 5 days advance</br></br></br>  how can you niggers be so naive?<br><br>we know this is going to hiatus again after a couple of 20 page chaptes</br></br>  <br>That was Mana.<br><br>The one glaring down at him was Nea.<br><br>Ponytail = Mana<br>Short hair = Nea<br><br>Being a Noah, Nea he had to kill human.<br>He had to choose but refused to, Earl forced him and guess who died: their mom.<br>The scene where Road shields Mana either before Nea kills their mom or after he did it.<br><br>Thus why we saw a crying Mana saying "Don't you hate me Nea?" after finding out his dead mom.<br><br><br>Mana did nothing wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being a Noah, Nea he had to kill human. <br> He had to choose but refused to, Earl forced him and guess who died: their mom. <br> The scene where Road shields Mana either before Nea kills their mom or after he did it. <br><br>Nothing of this parts confirmed yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cross: Once you become the 14th you will kill the one you hold dear <br> re read the flashbacks and last chapter </br></br>  <br>I was actually referring to when Road shielded Allen from Apocrypha(or whatever that innocence monsters name is) and apparently "died"</br>  Notice the scroll.<br>There are six pages per scroll. The scroll is 1/11 length of the scroll bar. <br><br>The chapter is already in inking stage. There should just be enough pages for the chapter, not more or less.<br><br>Whatever this chapter is, it has 66 pages</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Earl is fucking Mana, more or less. If that's true, Cross's saying can be applied to both Allen and Nea</br>  Also, it makes more sense why Road is head over heels for Allen an not for the 14th.<br><br>He behaves a lot like Mana.<br>Cross said before that he was an edgy brat but after killing Akuma Mana he started talking as if he was Manaa himself. <br><br><br>Road likes Allen Walker not the 14th that resides within him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Road knows Past!Allen. She shouldn't not have known.</br>  <br>How?<br><br>Allen was just an edgy brat with a weird arm alone in the world.<br><br>His meeting with Mana was just pure bad luck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How? <br><br>She is a information dumper who does not do her job. Hoshino states in an interview that Road is the only character who knows and aware of everything.<br><br> Allen was just an edgy brat with a weird arm alone in the world. <br><br> His meeting with Mana was just pure bad luck. <br><br>past!Allen has a word for this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  DGM threadly reminder that Past!Allen is responsible for:<br><br>[x]Musician code along with the song<br>[x]Almost destroying Noah Clan via using 14th<br>[x]Turning Cross's life into shit<br>[x]Turning Allen's life into extreme deep shit<br>[x]Cross's death<br>[x]Lavi turns into wormslut<br>[x]Road made a contract with QB and become magical girl, only for getting Madoka's bless and gone for good<br>[x]Timcanpy's death<br>[x]Not!Shou Tucker raping everyone<br>[x]Turning everyone into gay<br>[x]Link's unrequited gay love <br>[x]Turning Kanda and Alma from straight to gay<br>[x]The manga switches to quarterly<br><br>[for later update]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is this past Allen?<br><br>Is it the MC? Or another Allen like the dog?</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure all the gay parts was there from the start, just suppressed. Then homolust becomes popular in Shounen and hoshino just released all the sexual tension that was already there.</br>    <br> cross's death </br>  <br>Which chapter?</br>  So the hiatus ends. I wonder why it was so unbearable. The hiatuses weren't even as long as HiatusxHiatus or Berserk  <br>Chapter 215. But there were hints several chapters ago, especially during Ark Arc</br>  <br>Yeah, I still care. Recently bought the manga just to reread too. Idk anon, I sort of like the new chapters with apocrypha and all. Kanda past and arc was legit</br>  Am I the only one who actually like Alma arc? The art wasn't really great comparing to her art before but got saved by the plot. The story is what a 'tragedy' should be and yet, still beautiful.<br><br>The arc is basically what I like about DGM: characters are suffered because they're alive, not because they're suddenly killed off for drama like AgK</br></br>  <br>There is a lot of white there</br>  <br>It's the MC with long brown hair and still the master mind of everything</br>  <br>And she has a legit excuse too, wrist injury is nothing to scoff at, especially for a mangaka making her living. We are not even sure what's wrong with Togashi.</br>  <br> People just like to make fun of it because of the Alma meme.<br><br>  Draw a boy <br>  Call it a boy <br>  But was a cute girl in his past life <br>  Was fucking his best friend in said past life </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Hoshino pull the same thing on prototype!Allen?</br>  I wonder if this thread is alive until the spoilers  ;_;   <br>Probably not, we have nothing to discussed for over a year already after all.</br>  <br>We have, but getting tired of it due to the lack of new material<br><br> past!Allen <br> Mana and the Earl <br> The heart <br> Lenalee's legs </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't remember shit. Last thing I read was clown Allen meeting sword nigga and glasses guy.  I loved DGM when I was a kid. I have no idea where I stopped reading it though. I think they were attacking Noah's arc and Allen had just recently gotten his Clown powers. Maybe I'll start from the beginning. It was some journey watching the manga-ka's art improve so much.   inb4 next chapter is the final chapter <br> inb4 no questions answered <br> inb4 "Keep Walking" <br> inb4 "Thank you for reading all this time!!" </br></br></br>  <br><br>Would sincerely advise you guys to re-read from the beginning. I just did and it was a very enjoyable read, and certainly understood more about the plot than I was reading it weekly/monthly</br></br>  <br>Next arc was confirmed so no</br>  <br>My advice is to read from lvl 4 Akuma arc and go from there. Most of the chapters before it is basically just establishing the fact that Allen has Noah inside him and general story background</br>  <br>What chapter that starts on? 60?</br>  <br>But then they would miss out on the best arcs involving Komui-invention shenanigans.</br>  <br>Road is cute. <br><br>CUTE!</br></br></br>  <br>Zombie arc is after Lv4 arc</br>  <br>Woah woah woah<br><br>Is it seriously back?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh right, but there was one before lvl4 with Komui's giant robot right? That was pretty funny too</br>  <br>It was confirmed to return since last year's November</br>  I thought this manga was about zombies, what in the fuck is this  Who knows?    <br>Hallucigenia-chan!</br>  It's the living dead.<br><br>Who said zombies had to be humanoid? Are undead abominations of all kinds not welcome?</br></br>  That's a cool zamby, are there more variations or do they all look similar to this?  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>Google is your friend.</br>  <br>I am a hero. it's pretty good but becomes really fucking shitty halfway</br>  <br>You are part of the problem</br>  <br>kill yourself my man</br>  I think the series is just going to go full dragon quest at some point and you're going to have MC running around with a sword and shield wrecking monsters and its going to be perfectly expected by that point.  <br>Yeah, no, the last volumes were great.</br>  <br>Zombie centerpede.</br>  <br>Well I wouldn't say it becomes "really fucking shitty". I was somewhat disappointed when I figured out that it was about zombies (I initially thought the MC was a school shooter or serial killer with that shotgun of his), but I've grown to like the plot.</br>  <br> Foolish mortals, this isn't even my final form! </br>  How do I stop being a little girl enthusiast? I am not a lolicon but I tend to like little girl characters over more age appropriate character.  Why stop it? Just be happy with the way you are.  <br>Second</br>  Little girls are a miracle of the universe, embrace them.  <br> little girl <br>She's 80 odd years old by now anon.</br></br>  <br>It is a physical attraction to the body type and behaviors.

That delicious body.  <br> am not a lolicon but <br>I have some bad news for you anon.</br></br>  <br><br> become lolicon <br> all of my friends now avoid me because they can read minds <br> lose my attraction to normal women because human sexuality only allows for liking one thing at a time <br> thought police break down my door and send me to jail <br><br>You're right OP, avoid it at all costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The To Love Ru Darkness Chapter 57 is out  <br>Mea has a smell fetish.</br>  <br><br>They've been there for a while now since the last day or so, the best part is when they try to post as multiple users but don't realise I can see their IP's.</br></br>  <br>TLR:D had samefaces for years now.<br><br>Actually, it recently got better.</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like your average jihadmon</br>  <br> dropbox <br>What?</br></br>  Can we talk about how they fucked up the first episode?  No because the first episode was pretty good.  <br>There's 4 girls at the start of the anime.<br>3 in the manga.<br>Do the math.</br></br></br>  <br> Hurr <br>They'll just do the pre-Miki stuff as a flashback arc. Nothing she did in the first episode affects the story in any way.</br></br>  <br>Because most of the first episode is told from the perspective of the crazy chick who sees dead people dumbass, notice how that 4th girl only ever spoke to her, wasn't acknowledged by the other two, wasn't seen when it showed what was really going on and had her fucking gravestone on the roof?</br>  This chapter was horrible, they ruined Miki with the dog bullshit.  <br> wasn't acknowledged by the other two <br>Shovel acknowledged her<br>"Ooh-ra?", remember?<br><br>Also the dog was dead before they met Mii-kun</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to repopulate the earth with shovel.  If you want to blame someone, blame the manga's author  <br>It was a good episode. Yeah, it was different from the manga but it was still good.</br>  <br>Are you implying Miki's dead? Because if so, pic related.</br>  <br> 4girl  <br> death <br>anime fag pls go</br></br></br>  that shit was amusing<br><br>at first i thought these girls were a bunch of orphan hobos because they lived at school, but then the Shymalan Twist kicked in</br></br>  <br><br>Eh next episode is called memories so they are probably going to revisit pre-Mii life when Megune was still around. Albeit a bit rushed. The only part they really fucked up on though was the dog.</br></br>  Did anyone else notice this?  First episode got more than 720k views on niconico. That's even more than the first UBW episode.  <br> didn't even have a mention of the presence line </br>  Manga spoiler incoming. I just ate up all the current chapters (if there's no more than 36, at least) and I'm wondering:<br> Is the new girl Rii-chan's delusion? Considering Yuki isn't in the imouto spot anymore, she has really started losing it lately.<br>They go into the building, nothing but zombies, Yuki leaves a Teddy bear. Later at night, she goes in alone and comes out coincidentally with a young girl they somehow hadn't seen at first but also features some strange "bear ears". Also, notice the girls' reaction. The only thing that's making me doubt is Yuki seeing the girl immediately.</br> </br>  <br><br>It's not her grave though.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Megu is a good christian girl</br>  <br> She's most likely a delusion, yes.<br>It's way too convenient for her to find her like that, and only Yuki, who we know is bullshitting her own delusion for reasons, is interacting with the imouto<br>In chapter 37 and 38, the other two girls don't actually interact with her, either, and they seem to be discussing her, most likely because they're wondering how to go about things now that Rii's fucking psycho too</br></br> </br>  <br>If you please, can I get a link to the latest chapters. I don't care if it's raw.</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336<br>Here you go</br></br>  <br>He said raw not gook scans.</br>  <br> he thinks there are raws </br>  <br><br>What's the fucking difference?</br></br>  <br>I can read glorious Nippongese but not shitty ugly dogeater scribbles.</br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br> Imouto is also specifically omitted in the scene where the three girls are watching them climbing back over the wall, and there's part of the window blocking the exact sliver of the panel where she would be standing when she's playing with Rii and Yuka <br><br>I accidentally typed "Yura" who would be entertaining in a zombie apocalypse too.</br></br></br>  Best girl coming through.  <br> those comments <br> "is that Komoe-sensei" </br></br>  <br>I'll say it again but all girls are best girls.</br>  <br>Yes is it. It is Megu-nee's grave in the manga. Megu-nee is dead, not Miki.</br>  <br>Will it sell?</br>  <br>If they fix the shit that was episode 1 sure.<br>I hope sells well.</br></br>  <br>If they are going to end it with graduation, they will skip a buttload of content. First episode was a single manga chapter.<br><br>Thing is, if there is a second season soon because good sales, they can't really go back to adapt those bits if the graduation already happened.</br></br></br>  <br> end it with graduation <br>I think they'll end it on the episode of Yuki's breakdown, where it says the same things the first chapter said, like "Lately, I love school"<br>Do we know if this is just going to be 12 eps or if it's going to be more?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's a perfect ending. Crying on Mii-kun's bosom after the same monologue.<br><br>Most likely 12, they would never take chances with a series like this.</br></br></br>  <br> perfect ending <br>Eh. Perfect way to end the penultimate episode, yes, but the graduation would make for a much better ending.</br></br>  <br> Most likely 12, they would never take chances with a series like this. <br>and is fucking sad<br>the industry will do countless of moeshit but they don't give a fuck about this.</br></br></br>  Who the fuck thought the dog was a good idea?  <br>I think it already got people's interest in the manga so the adaptation did its job. Sales of the anime depend if the quality of the show stays consistent.</br>  <br>I fucking hate goofy dogs and bratty kids with the main cast in every show ever.</br>  <br> It was different from the manga therefore it's shit. <br>It was a really good episode. One of the best 1st episodes in a while even. I heard even the mangaka is working with them to fix the earlier chapters mistakes.</br></br>  <br>He didn't say it was shit, can you read? He just said they fucked it up, and I'd be inclined to agree. 20 minutes of boring shit so you can reveal the twist in the last two minutes isn't that great. With the manga I was interested enough to keep reading through chapter one, but when I watched the anime, even though I knew what was going to happen, I considered just stopping and waiting until next weeks, because holy fuck was it boring.</br>  There are like 4 threads up, which one is the main one?  <br>Abusive tsunderes that complete the cycle of tsun to dere within the first few episodes are worse.</br>  <br>But going straight away into the thick of it isn't great either. Having you care a bit more for everyone before hitting you with the twist was a great decision in my books. If anything that can be said negativily about the episode is the lack of animation. It showed that they can't animate anything with the kind of the heads popping to talk.</br>  <br>Main threads don't exist. Post in the thread or threads you want to.</br>  <br><br>By main thread, I mean thread where the majority of people who want to discuss the show are discussing it. Not "officially ordained thread"</br></br>  <br><br>There probably won't be a season 2, so they are jamming everything into 12 episodes just to sell the manga.</br></br>  <br> But going straight away into the thick of it isn't great either. <br>The manga didn't do that either, and I feel like the pacing of the manga was better.<br> Having you care a bit more <br>It did a terrible job of making the viewer care, in my opinion. The entirety of the episode was based around Taroumaru, so unless they plan to make him heroically die or something, I don't see the point, because he was already DOA in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a problem when OP doesn't use Gakkou Gurashi in his post. Most people use CTRL+F.</br>  <br>you forgot this one.</br>  <br>The pacing was so much better in the manga.<br>Also they are going to use the dog for shocking or something.<br>When the dog was only a little flashback.</br></br></br>  <br> is <br><br>Also, considering how much those faggots who post their reaction to the episode miss so much, I'm not surprised how a lot of people didn't start suspecting something was off before the reveal.</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of the manga. How the hell did the  pilot get infected? </br>  <br> Also they are going to use the dog for shocking or something. <br>I really hope they don't do that. The manga lacked shock value, rather, it keeps you on the edge all the time, which I believe is better.</br></br>  <br>May have been infected prior to flying if Randall Corp/the elevens' government is severely undermanned as a result of the infection. May have been bitten by someone who was on the chopper as well who turned. It's implied that he was infected, was trying to take the medicine before he turned, failed, lost control, and crashed.</br>  <br>He probably was infected for a while, but the government is lacking manpower and has the medicine.<br><br>He probably lost control when it was time for his next shot of the medicine.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If he was infected all along and he needed another shot, that means that the vaccine probably works only temporarily on people, who are infected. Which would mean that Kurumi will probably need another shot soon.</br></br>  <br><br>Did they take any syringes from Radio-chan's place? I can't recall.</br></br>  That fucking dog.  <br>The same thing happened to Radio-chan. Shovel already has one foot in the grave.</br>  <br>It was never mentioned what they took except for the car keys.<br> RIP Radio-chan. ;_; </br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br> The same thing happened to Radio-chan. <br>I guess that would also imply that she ran out of shots to stop the infection from spreading.<br> Shovel already has one foot in the grave. <br>I'll be hoping for a miracle.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Don't remember the episode but one girl told Shovel chan that his skin is cold  <br>get ready for more despair.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Radio-chan probably died because she ran out of medicine.<br>She was infected for a while and if I remember correctly she was coughing in the last broadcast the girls heard from the car.<br><br> Did they take any syringes from Radio-chan's place?  <br>There probably weren't any left, but even if there still were some - The girls probably don't know that the medicine is a temporary suppressant and that Kurumi is going to need another shot of the medicine soon.<br><br>The point when Kurumi realizes that she isn't healed and will need regular shots of the medicine to not turn into a zombie might be the time we'll see the first mental breakdown from Kurumi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you forgot the top right image in your post <br>What dude</br></br>  <br>What are the odds this gets something similar to haruhi broadcast order?</br>  <br> episode <br>dam , chapter<br>the point is<br> she's ded </br></br></br></br>  <br> episode <br>Anon, you silly goose, you.</br></br>  Friendly reminder that radio girl being dead is a red herring.  <br> his <br>Words can not express how OK I would be with this</br></br>  <br>   his skin is cold <br>Anon, these boy jokes are going too far.</br></br>  <br><br> Implying she won't become a zombie hybrid <br><br>She was shown testing her abilities, the zombies notice her less now.<br><br>Also, nice trips.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This guy draws thighs as good as fatalpulse. Is fatalpulse working as his assistant?</br></br>  Why wasn't the helicopter pilot a zombie when they got his map?  <br>Died in the crash, properly died<br>Probably crushed skull</br></br>  <br>The helicopter crashed and then fucking exploded.<br>The corpse was probably torn to shreds.<br><br>The map and pistol Kurumi brought were intact because they were in a metal case if I remember correctly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he was wearing a helmet</br>  <br>Yuki was the zombie all along.</br>  <br>They're all sex goddesses, especially craycray.</br>  <br>His fully intact body is shown over the case with the gun/map in it. I don't have the manga on my laptop so I can't post the page.</br>  <br>Wearing a helmet protects you if your helicoter explodes</br>  <br>Do you got the rest of these?</br>  <br>for you? no.</br>  <br> the zombies notice her less now. <br>I went back and looked at that page and fuck, I didn't notice that back when I was reading. Time to panic.</br></br>  <br>I didn't remember that. <br>In that case it might be possible that he didn't turn yet and died in the crash.<br>If corpses still turn he might have turned at a later time, after Kurumi took the case.</br></br></br>  <br>Her CQC tactical espionage skills are being developed, she just lowered her body temperature so infrared won't pick her.</br>  http://swiffarchive.com/swf/Yare%20<wbr>Yare%20Daze.swf</wbr>  <br>Her body is cold and the zombies don't attack her unless she shouts at them. That probably means that ethe zombies see her as one of them.<br>She's half-undead at this point.</br></br>  <br> fatalpulse could be working on GG doujins as we speak </br>  <br>There's one of each girl except Yuki, I think.</br>  the dog was a mistake  <br>see </br>  <br>Scratch that, Yuki's would probably be volume 1's special cover, which no one has scanned yet.</br>  <br>Damn it, I knew I was missing one aside from zombie-sensei.</br>  Do the inverted uniform colors actually mean anything or is it just some bored person?  <br>Use your head.</br>  <br>Yuki's their senpai, Ledouche.</br>  <br>He isn't Ippo.</br>  <br>I done have told you guys she's gonna end up like  Murphy in Z Nation </br>  <br>I can't wait to see Yuki abused<br>All of them, really, but especially Yuki<br><br>And I want to see Shovel loved tenderly, because I like her a lot, and not just for cute</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's half-undead at this point. <br>Well shit, my optimism's pretty low now, though I still hope for some ass pull that there will be a cure or something, that will turn her back to normal again.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? That was really THE focus point of the chapter. Walking by zombies unnoticed is really something. It's obvious Kurumi has only stopped the transformation process. She's going to need another shot soon. Do they actually have another syringe in the case?</br>  <br> but especially Yuki <br> Doesn't know the purpose of Yuki <br>Read the manga.<br>She's just pretending.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Why the fuck did he even crash in the first place? He pulled out a syringe then it crashed? I didn't understand that.</br></br></br>  <br>I know<br>But she's super cute and trying her best to be optimistic and smiling a lot<br>I want to see her break down completely, because she's cute</br></br></br>  I assumed Kurumi was taking doses of it regularly  <br>I asked the same, and this anon's response was pretty good</br>  <br> just pretending <br>Why do people keep saying this?<br>You really think she had been merely pretending to be delusional for everyone's sake?</br></br></br>  <br>Transformation got the better of him the moment he tried to take the shot. That's why he crumpled the map, crushed the syringe he wanted to inject himself with and went full zombie.</br>  <br><br>Didnt you notice how his retard zombie spasms had him crushing everything, including the syringe? He was fucked at that point.</br></br>  <br>Mikifags shitting up the threads</br>  <br><br>How did he even become infected though?</br></br>  <br>She's clearly pretending at this point<br>She wasn't at the start, but ever since they took shelter in the disaster room, she's been fairly lucid</br></br>  <br>At that point, she's no longer fully delusional. You can see that by how grown up she acts, which is the reason why Rii is going insane due to her memories of her real imouto.</br>  <br> That was really THE focus point of the chapter. <br>Yeah, I kinda understand it now. I guess I should re-read the manga, just in case I missed anything else.  My lack of sleep is really gets to me sometimes. <br><br><br>He crushed the syringe in his hand. The infection was getting to him, so he started to lose control over his actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My amazing deduction skills tell me that he probably got bit</br>  <br>Holy shit read the thread fucking thread, this was already asked and discussed.</br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>I did read the manga. She wasn't pretending before chapter 29. Afterwards, yes, but not before.</br>  <br>How did he get fucking bit while in a helicopter? If he got bit before getting in the helicopter, why didn't he use the syringe before FUCKING GETTING IN A VEHICLE WHILE INFECTED FOR FUCK'S SAKE.</br>  <br>That's not necessarily pretending<br>They could have sold that to her as some sort of ritual the club does for reasons<br>I don't know what those reasons would be, but that thing's been there for a long time, and it would be weird for them not to have sugarcoated the explanation of it to her</br></br></br>  <br>You are a special kind of stupid.</br>  <br>That's where the theory that the medicine becomes less effective over time. For all we know, their last helicopter pilot could have been on the juice for so long that he needed to shoot up every twenty minutes.</br>  <br><br>The syringe was loaded with sedatives, that might be why he crashed too.</br></br>  <br>So we're still left in the dark and we don't really know the circumstances that led him to crash. Okay, I can accept that. Doesn't explain why fuckers like  are acting so colon crucified if it's supposed to be an ambiguous situation in the first place though.</br>  <br>This is why we can't have nice threads on /a/. Read </br>  <br> Doesn't explain why fuckers like (You) are acting so colon crucified if it's supposed to be an ambiguous situation in the first place though. <br>Because everything you've asked has already be discussed in this short thread you blind nigger.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't help when you/ are so fucking dense that you have to have the same thing repeated to you several times over just so you can get it through your/their thick skull.</br>  <br><br>Wow, looks like the memers are getting angry for some reason. Are you guys having problems? Face it, it was poorly conveyed in the manga so you're probably going to get more questions about it as more and more people read the manga.

Yuki was amazing.</br>  <br>What's wrong with dota?</br>  <br>Her gomen was cutest thing I heard this season.</br>  <br>Trust me, you're making the right choice<br> They spent an episode, or maybe 2 I can't remember, dragging a fat, bloated zombie out of a well because "If we leave it there, we can't drink the water, it'll be infected and bad", which would somehow be solved by just removing the zombie.<br>Anyway, this all ends in them ripping the zombie in half over the well, with the lower half falling back into the well, and the top half being alive and well on the ground next to them, so they kill it.<br><br>The whole second season is trash<br>Actually, the entire show after the first season is trash<br>Season 1 is pretty good though</br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> the industry will do countless of moeshit but they don't give a fuck about this. <br> using moeshit unironically <br>This is a fucking manga time kirara manga</br></br></br>  <br>first episode was very good, the only thing that I would have changed was something in the beginning to show that the world was fucked up, instead of leaving it at the end as a surprise<br><br>I went in completely blind, and I still thought the reveal was unnecessary, even if it wasnt the intent, it felt like they really wanted it to be shocking, and I think if you're just going to reveal something like that in the first episode, you're better off just putting everyone on the same page right off the bat, even if it was just a quick shot of some fucked up shit, just leave it as something for the audience to keep in mind until the end when you can use it and the reveal together to cement your setting.<br><br> &gt;opinions </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey now, Shovel is too strong to get mind broken.<br>  She just gets turned into a zombie <br><br>I also still love how her reaction to seeing a guy kill himself is to call him a fucking coward and move on completely unphased.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Actually, the entire show after the first season is trash <br><br> The last season was solid </br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh god, who thought that was a good idea? I'm suddenly glad GG is only one cour, because if it isn't a good adaptation, at least we don't have to suffer for years like TWD comicfags</br></br>  <br>I was talking to someone who hasn't read the manga and they said.<br> this will be anime OF THE SEASON. For sure. I know it. The first episode BLEW MY MIND.  <br>I don't ever want to talk to them again.</br></br></br>  <br>shoveled definitely getting zomb'd, it's unavoidable<br><br>but not until her own mini-arc and some character development, to really hit it home when the time comes</br></br></br>  <br><br>That was one episode. Call it a farm arc if you must.</br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say definitely. There's a pretty high chance that there'll just be some asspull and she'll be fine.<br><br> Or at least I hope </br></br></br></br>  <br>Good point, I just wanted to specify the well part, and wasn't entirely sure how to<br>Episode would imply anime, and a chapter or a volume would both be too short to really be the same amount of content</br></br>  <br><br>If I have to deal with people expecting "epik twists" all season I'm going to shoot myself.</br></br>  <br>I hope so to, sure I'd be ashamed because ass pull and all but if she ends up find I would be very happy</br>  <br> I also still love how her reaction to seeing a guy kill himself is to call him a fucking coward and move on completely unphased. <br>That was before she realized the medicine didn't worked and started contemplating the same thing, if only for different reasons.<br><br> The guy killed himself because he was infected. </br></br></br></br>  Why won't you love me, Taroumaru?!  <br> she doesn't exist when they found him <br> this is why he doesn't like her. <br>DP</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, he wasn't alive at the beginning of the mango either.</br></br>  <br><br> Graduation <br> Miki sees the dog walking back to the school rather than her friend </br></br></br>  The last shot of the show is gonna be   Miki's note to Kei, right?    <br><br>It was also really cute.</br></br>  <br>In the end, it was really daijoubu.</br>  I'm gonna have to either read the manga or avoid these threads, aren't I?  <br>Or wait until it finishes airing.</br>  <br>She is pretty much done for.</br>  I'm pretty interested in how this series does its zombies. They seem to simply be people who are afflicted by a mind-controlling bacteria/virus which heavily rots the skin. People who die before the infection gets to them tend to simply die then and there. Plus the zombies die from various things which would kill a regular human, and probably not a zombie. Not to mention that Megu-nee was going through really deep levels of infection and wandering the school with a  albeit horribly deteriorated  focused mind while heading towards a specific location in order to get away from her beloved students. <br><br>They don't seem like they are actual walking dead, but rather just infected people who are wandering around until they can infect other people.</br></br>  <br>The faggot was implying Miki was dead you dumb shit.</br>  <br>It's just a flesh wound.</br>   Wanting a shot for shot remake of the manga, basically using the panels as the storyboard <br><br>Pants on head retarded. It'd be dull as fuck.</br></br>  <br>The manga art is a thousand times better.</br>  <br>How would it be dull? The manga is great.</br>  What's the most brutal ending you guys can think of? <br><br> Miki never left her compound, all her "friends" are just a hallucination as she spends her days swinging at shadows from her imagination and pretending she has friends who themselves are actually deluded <br><br> Shovel Knight goes full-zambie, bites Miki with Miki committing murder-suicide to protect her friends. Yuuri is still in a state of mental-shielding delusion, while Yuki has to protect her from now on <br><br> Shovel becomes a zombie and they are forced to kill her. Just as they finish her off and enter a government facility, they are told that there was always a miracle cure, they were just being watched for the sake of an experiment, which would conclude as soon as they found the facility <br><br> Everybody dies, holding hands with one another, crying but happy.   It's revealed at the end that the virus is cured by radio frequencies and sound amplifiers, explaining why zombies were drawn to speakers and megaphones moreso than human flesh.  <br> Final chapter is simply Radio-chan cracking a joke over the radio that she thought she was a zombie, but was seemingly mistaken. She continues to talk about how she would keep playing music for any survivors who were hurting, and would stay waiting for anybody who would come to her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, after watching it, it was alright, the scene where it shows the ruined classroom was pretty good, music was decent too. Miki being introduced in this episode felt natural, anime adaptations tend to do this a lot, skip ahead in the story then explain shit in flashbacks. I don't really care about the dog<br><br>Shovel is still the best girl.</br></br></br>   mfw I got my imouto to read the manga after the episode, and she's now furiously texting me because shovel got bit   <br>How do I unsubscribe?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the outbreak is confined to this one city and it's all just a experiment by the government/corporation. <br>Still have no idea what the pilot's purpose was though.<br><br>It'll end with  all the cast sacrificing themselves to get Yuki a little closer to their goal and the government will find Yuki imagining her friends like nothing happened </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>By fisting yourself</br></br>  <br> showing yuri shows to your little sister <br>Unless you're a grill yourself you're an ultra faggot.</br></br>  <br><br>Yuri shitposter, you don't seem like you really have anything special in your shitposts. Please go back to the threads from friday and saturday and try to learn.</br></br>  <br> brutal <br>They were all zombies all along and they get hacked to death by an ordinary Japanese schoolboy with a chainsaw.</br></br>  <br>Your sister has good taste in girls.</br>  Why is she so sexual?  What if everybody is Yuki tripping balls?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128007211 <br>WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF, FAGGOT<br> Your capslock key is on, too. Might wanna turn it off. </br></br>  <br><br>Calling it now. Yuki is the only one who will survive.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128007211 <br>Watch it by yourself, Gaia man.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128007211 <br>Kurumi is manlier than probably 90% of characters from your shitty manime.</br>  <br> Best boy coming through. <br>FTFY</br></br>  Best girl.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128007211 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Yuki does things to my heart, especially the more serious she gets. How can one girl be so best?</br>  <br><br>I was pretty anti-yuki until that part</br></br>  <br> People who die before the infection gets to them tend to simply die then and there <br>Did they ever show someone die without infection?<br><br> zombies die from various things which would kill a regular human <br>I don't find that particularly surprising, unless I'm missing the point you're trying to make. It's not like their bodies suddenly become tougher because they are zombies.<br><br> Megu-nee  <br>While I really want to write off her resistance to the infection as an exception, I'll agree with you on that one.<br><br> just infected people who are wandering around until they can infect other people <br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone's going to be translating 36 and 37 from the gook scans soon in the other thread:<br/>  <br>They went full moe to make the reveal more dramatic, and imo it was for the best. How else are you going to fill the first episode if the twist can't happen until minute 18?</br>  <br>What chapter is that? I don't remember it at all.</br>  <br>Mall chapter, before they find Miki.<br><br>I wonder how much of the SoL scenes we'll get.<br>Will the entire sports festival make it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty boring, so I hope not.<br><br>I hope they just keep the contrast between the SoL and the survival and suffering, because that's what makes the series interesitng, if they just show a lot of SoL it'll end up being boring.</br></br></br>  <br> yuri <br>Fuck off to </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009963 <br>anon take this series in your mind as a deconstruction of the SoL genre and you can enjoy this.</br>  <br>I am not mentally prepared for what's going to happen to the shovel girl</br>  <br>This whole scene really made me think. To what extent does Yuki know whats going on? Shes clearly aware of the immediate danger while simultaneously holding onto her delusions.<br><br>How long do you guys suppose until shes face to face with a zombie and has to actually deal with it?</br></br></br>  <br>No shit sherlock!</br>  <br><br>I think she's pretty lucid by now. She was forgetting to ask Megu-nee's permission for things.</br></br>  <br>I wonder how long until we see the outside world from her eyes.</br>  <br>Literally the chapter after that happened<br><br>She's been coming back to reality since Kurumi was bit, and after the fire she's pretty much sane. The latest chapters even imply that she doesn't see Megu-nee anymore, while Yuri is starting too.</br></br></br>  <br> Only School-Live and Highschool of the dead have done Romero style zombies right </br>  Chapter 36 in the other thread, if anyone is still here.  <br>I dont think that really counts since it was a crawler. She could've walked away as easily ash she bashed it's head in with a mop. I'm talking more like shes alone with 1 other person whos passed out and suddenly zombies come out of no where or something like that.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>link</br>  <br><br>Literally look above you</br></br>  <br> you will never mate with Yuki </br>  <br>These are not romero style zombies. You have to be alive and bit to be infected and turn.</br>  <br>We actually don't know that for sure since we haven't see a dead person who isn't a zombie.</br>  <br>The guy who hanged himself.</br>  <br><br>Also, Romero zombies have to die before they can turn, but, as we've seen with the existence of the medicine and being able to change back, GG zombies have to be alive.</br></br>  <br>Of course it counts. You gotta trust the author's storytelling capacity a bit here, but the way that whole sequence was done was clearly meant to be a major point in her character arc. Couple the situation itself with Yuki's reaction, including the repeat of the initial monologue that introduced us to the delusions in the first place and her running through the school while seeing its actual state and then breaking down. If this manga wants to have good writing that part -has- to be the point where she changes, perhaps not 100% but majorly. At the very least I'm pretty sure she can act normal now, she just keeps the delusion facade up because reasons and also that's her personality anyway.</br>  If Shovel dies I'll go and get a job.  <br>You realize that your neck snaps when you hang yourself right?</br>  <br>Yeah, but the brain is intact.</br>  <br>But it's not attached to the rest of body. It's the same as decapitation.</br>  <br>Can you point out where does Yuuri start to see Megu-nee? So far I have been seeing the girls asking Yuki to 'confirm' with Megu-nee as part of their usual practice.</br>  <br>Rii saw megu's silhouette in the smoke</br>  <br>I thought the one who saw Megu-nee was Yuki? If I remember right, Yuki was the one who pointed the right direction and 'thanked' Megu-nee later.</br>  What do you see in her eye?  <br><br>Death</br></br>  <br>In chapter 32 I think, Yuuri talks about Megu-nee as if she's still alive. And again later she asks if it's okay to take the RV without asking Megu-nee about abandoning her car.</br>  <br>salvation</br>    <br>She never sees Megu-nee. Yuuris just using the fact that Yuki acts as if she can see Megu to get Yuki out of the room.</br>  I can't wait until we hear Yuki say, "Megu-nee is dead!" directly from her mouth. Probably to Yuuri.  Time for dank meme.<br><br>"Megu-nee is dead. She's not here anymore! But on my back, and in my heart, she lives on in me! "<br><br>"Digging a hole to piece the zombies! Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I'm Kurumi ! I'm not my teacher Megu-nee! I am myself! Kurumi the digger!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>What I don't get is, at least in the manga, sometimes she has really long hair and other times it's just shoulder-length. Why is that?</br>  <br/>  Reminder<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805</wbr></br></br>  <br><br><br>Continuing from the other thread.</br></br></br>  When does chapter 38 come out?  <br>Two weeks, 24th to be precise.</br>    <br>Just looked back and found this.</br>    <br>I want to punch that face.</br>  <br>I want to irrumate that face.</br>  <br>Yuki and Yuuri have similar symptoms but opposite causes.<br>Yuki was in a familiar and relatively safe place, so when she broke she could go 'safe-mode'. In her heart she knows what's happening but her mind could just block everything out and feed her happy thoughts. Now that things are happening and they're moving, new things are forcing her to come out of her comfort zone and make her shell really thin. She's relying less on delusions and has stopped making as many excuses. Moving forward will eventually break her shell, and there's going to need to be a lot of support for her when it happens.<br><br>Yuuri was handling it when it was stable, but everything's just piling up now they're moving, uncertainty, fear, responsibility, etc. Her mind can't handle it and her heart is searching for comfort. She'll stabilise after she gets back to a calm environment, cry her eyes out for a while and pull her shit together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, time to polish the previous pages that were done. I'll upload the rest to MEGA or some shit and maybe try to get rid of the watermark on the left of these but no promises on that.</br>  <br>I wouldn't bother with the watermark, this version's going to be replaced next month when Deel comes out with his version anyway.</br>  <br>Alright then, nice to know. I didn't see that update.</br>  <br>Ah I see, it was Yuki who was pointing to the correct path and Yuuri who saw Megu-nee.</br>  <br>The intention is what counts, thanks for you work. Although now that you have the intention, can you do the same, but with chapter 36? Typesetting done in paint is not that pleasant to read.</br>   just caught up with the manga <br> got to read newly translated chapters with /a/  <br>This has been fun. Mii-kun is best girl by the way.</br></br>  <br>Sure, I have time to waste. I might not dump it like this though, it'll probably be apart of the MEGA upload link.</br>  <br>She's competent all round. Has shovel's prowess and Rii's levelheadedness.<br>Truly best grill</br></br>  <br>How do you figure that? All they have to do is stop at where   they leave the school  They can just pick later when there's more chapters.</br>  <br>Good enough. Thanks in advance, much appreciated.</br>  <br>She'll go down the insanity-hole once something happens, just like Rii.</br>  <br>That's when she has to bash shovel's head with her shovel.</br>  <br><br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/11/japanese-fan-discover<wbr>s-interesting-fact-about-school-liv<wbr>e-uniforms</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> back to normal again. <br>Please don't get my hopes up.</br></br>  <br> She's naturally resistant and will encounter no symptoms other than cold body temperature <br> Randall Corporation has invented a more advanced cure in the past couple of weeks <br><br>What other possibilities, no matter how small, are there?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mii-kun is best boy <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br> Mii-kun is actually a trap <br> He throws away his crossdressing hobby in order to keep the group of girls sane with his manly aura  <br> they all become part of his harem </br></br></br>  <br> builds a resistance to the infection <br> they can make a vaccine from her and cure people who have already turned into zombies <br>But then they realize they can't save the people that they killed like their teacher and shovel-chan feels immense guilt for killing so many people.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying   this series won't end with Yuki being the only sane one of the group, as the rest lose their minds to various stimulus <br>   Yuuri has already gone off the deep end, and is carrying around a teddy bear she calls her sister <br>   Miki is a trap who is under the distinct impression he's a girl, and as such forgets who he truly is beyond "one of the girls of the Life Club" <br>   Kurumi has been cured, but her deep fears and paranoia lead to her body being clammy and cold, and she will mentally regress to the point where she will become a zombie psychologically rather than biologically, and the infection won't even matter </br></br></br></br>  <br>They were living in agony, near-mindless, but still barely there. Do you see this shit? There's no recovering from this.</br>  <br>That isn't even a grave, you dumbass.

I don't want survivors drama shit in my Gakkou Gurashi.</br></br>    I hope the helmet boys gonna join their gang.<br>Man power is never a bad thing.</br>  <br> Miracle cure is found <br> The girls have been so psychologically destroyed by the past events that there is no hope for them ever having a future that isn't overloaded with abject sadness, PTSD, and endless nightmares <br> Even if they find salvation, their scars will have ruined them forever <br><br>This series has its bad end already written out. What good could possibly come from this? Even if they revealed the zombies were all actors, they have killed a ton of people, and that shit would fuck with them harder than the actual apocalypse did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you seen those girls?

So since the Holy Grail couldn't make his wish come true, instead of making another wish (to revive his wife), he kills his family and destroys the Holy Grail?   WTF?    Because he has failed in his mission and lost the artifact used to summon Saber, house Einzbern, of his wife, is pretty fucking pissed at him.<br>So they take his kid and tell him to get lost and think about all the stupid shit he's done because of his overconfidence.</br>  The grail itself is a sham that doesn't actually grant wishes.  <br> ilyas eyes <br>Damn I feel bad for her.</br></br>   couldn't make his wish come true <br>It can, just not the way he wanted it to be<br> WTF <br>Go back to whatever shithole you came from.</br></br></br>  Did you miss the part where Grail is revealed to be incomplete and doesn't grant miracles?  SIX<br>BILLION<br>PEOPLE</br></br>  <br>But Reddit is down for maintenance ;(</br>  <br>Fuck off and never come back.</br>  <br>It's too late, I love it here. My friend come here often to.</br>      <br>i thought it granted kirei's wish of destruction after emiya refused it? did you miss the part where archer tells him that?</br>  <br>Does anything in the fate series make sense? King arthur is a woman and she wishes she wasn't king because she didnt lead her people yet lancelot said she was the best king ever</br>  <br><br>No, the grail is corrupt and only grants wishes of destruction, or grants wishes in destructive ways.<br><br>To this day I'm not exactly sure about what exactly was going on there but the grail was basically luring him into some fantasy world where he would live with his "family" presumably at the expense of destroying the real world. He symbolically kills the grail by killing the fake family members, which I suppose limits the destruction to the city they're in.<br><br>That's more or less how I interpreted that scene anyway. Someone who read the LN might give some insight.<br><br><br>This has nothing to do with OP's question. You're talking about the real Illya (his daughter); in the scene OP referenced he kills a fake Illya and Irisviel.<br><br><br> the most basic acronyms are now disallowed on /a/ <br> I'm quoting the situation <br>You fuckwits need to stop trying to fucking hard to fit in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> replying seriously to a bait op  <br> calling others fuckwits </br></br>  <br> No, the grail is corrupt and only grants wishes of destruction, or grants wishes in destructive ways. <br>That means if he revive his waifu, het gets a waifu of destruction?</br></br>  <br> she wishes she wasn't king because she didnt lead her people yet lancelot said she was the best king ever <br>She was incredibly idealistic and obsessed with pride and glory, so she evoked incredible respect and following, but ultimately the nation was crumbling and her people had to suffer. Giving up pride and selling out the nation as slaves might have led them to suffer less physically, at the requirement of giving up all pride.<br><br>I'd say it's ambiguous whether she did or didn't make the right decision.<br><br><br>It won't revive Irisviel, only a puppet that looks like her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> This has nothing to do with OP's question. You're talking about the real Illya (his daughter); in the scene OP referenced he kills a fake Illya and Irisviel. <br>I focused on the &gt;Kills his family and destroys the grail and his pic related.<br>So my point of view got skewed.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that was merely him rejecting the grail.<br>He orders Saber to destroy the lesser holy grail.<br><br>Does nobody fucking pay attention?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it was never really clear and open to interpretation</br>  @128016016<br>No u.</br>  <br>It was clear.

I know Fate is 10 years old, but don't spoil all that shit like it's nothing for fuck's sake.</br>  <br> but don't spoil <br>Most of the people reading it are VN players, it leaves room for extra exposition and more stuff that wasn't shown or fully explained in the VN.<br>Why cater to the lower percentage?<br> inb4 90% vs 10% </br></br></br></br>  <br>When you put it like that, yeah, fuck secondaries.</br>  <br>I thought the manga would get quite a lot of readers who just watched UBW and are waiting for the HF movies</br>   This was one of the opening pages to the first chapter <br> Dark Sakura probably isn't going to appear for half a decade </br>  <br><br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>That's a big head.</br>  <br><br> 4u </br></br>  <br> We won't see Best Sakura for half a decade <br>Why does it hurt so much?</br></br>  <br>Most of the people who watched UBW read the VN already, seriously they have a scroll in every episode promoting the VN, it's even on the Appstore and it was free during UBW's airing. Even if they didn't read the VN they probably watched Zero already.<br>The people you are thinking off are a very, very small minority.</br></br>  <br> Best Sakura <br> not BB </br></br>  <br>Wasn't only Fate free?</br>  <br>as you want, i will upload it tomorrow anyway.</br>  <br>UBW was free during the 2nd cour like how Fate was free during the first, you still have to buy HF though which would tempt most people into buying it.</br>  <br><br>I mean, at this point I could redraw the whole thing.<br><br>But if you want only that, then okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber does it for free?</br>  <br>let's go with the whole thing, it will look better.</br>  <br>Fuck you, Sakura. You horrible manipulative woman. You can't tell people what to do and not give them a resonable explanation for it. God damn who the fuck decided this bitch should get her own route? Thank goodness it's only going to be one movie.</br>  <br>Task Ohna just wanted to draw Dark Sakura right away. Can't blame him, she does weird things to my dick.</br>  <br>She takes her job very seriously.</br>  <br>What? How? You imagine her using her shadow dress to jack you off or something you damn pervert?</br>  <br>  Thank goodness it's only going to be one movie. <br><br>More than one; it's obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>If Deen can make UBW in 90 minutes, ufo can make HF in 120.<br>Believe in them.</br></br>  <br>Sakurafags on suicide watch. I wish I had a button to shock every single one of them.</br>  Miura's big idea for HF was to make a single six hour movie. He said that it'd be impossible, though.  <br>that's why i think of several movies.</br>  <br>The guy is cat on head retarded.</br>  <br>That's gonna get shaved down into 3.<br> Unless Ufotable just animates the cool scenes and an ending then at the end of the credits there is a huge "READ THE FUCKING VN" plastered on the screen. </br></br>  <br>Or he might just be an insane genius?</br>  <br>Miura is our guy. Don't hate our guy..</br>  <br>I'd watch that.</br>  <br>Why is her telling him to try to avoid getting involved in this magus death fight so he won't die so "FUCK YOU, GO DIE" type bad? Of course she can't tell him that its a magus death fight, since he doesn't really know anything about magus stuff beyond his father telling him a few stories, and it would be revealing more than a few things about herself as well.<br><br>Well maybe she could tell him a bit more, but as said a few seconds ago that would lead into a dozen other conversations like "Yes I'm a magus as well", and if you know her character she wants to just be normal around him since that's her sanctuary.<br><br>So she just asked him to trust her and go with it for now, just stay in for tonight. The amount of time they've been together should be worth at least that much even without much explanation given.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Kondo (ufo's producer) who had that wild fantasy.</br>  <br>I'd rather the 6 hour movie. Better than waiting fucking forever to see the scenes you want animated.</br>  Only one movie: https://soundcloud.com/karoshi-4/vo<wbr>ice-003-001</wbr>  <br>Has there ever been an anime movie with a runtime that is even close to that?</br>  <br>I think the longest, outside of any potential weird arthouse stuff, is around two and a half hours.</br>  <br>We have went over this already, what is really said and what the TM Ace says about it.</br>  <br>What's the difference besides darker levels?</br>  Does anyone know what this tweet is going on about?  <br>Just look closely at the moon<br><br>Pics from http://bosel.blog64.fc2.com/blog-en<wbr>try-3778.html</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>God Sakura's head looks weird.</br>  Task Ohna's drawing    <br>So pretty</br>  Soon<br> Character popularity poll <br>https://twitter.com/prisma_illya/st<wbr>atus/616582279238791168</wbr></br></br>  <br> Rin &gt; Luvia </br>  <br>5 hour movie confirmed?</br>  <br>Lord of the ring: 4 hours</br>  <br>I was thinking anime specifically.</br>  <br>Anon mentioned Anime movie.</br>  one movie is really not enough, what are they thinking?? the sales were not good? not as good as Zero?<br><br>Gotta' lower my expectations if it is confirmed...</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's some new/expanded scenes.</br>  <br>We have nothing fully confirmed yet. They haven't even started production on it. They're too busy working on this masterpiece.</br>  <br>BAZETT FLASHBACK CONFIRMED</br>  <br>That's Takeuchi btw.</br>    <br>And people wonder why they keep sucking Nasu's dick.</br>  Before I go, I leave this here. Just in case.  Thanks for the hard work guys! Hoping next months chapter goes up to Rin and Shirou meeting each other.  <br><br>You are shitting me.</br></br>  <br>nah I haven't browsed 4chan in years. I just followed the link in the BL thread.</br>  <br>Fair enough. The shitposting is too much sometimes, but other than that we can have nice threads and the fanbase here is dedicated.</br>  <br>I am... but wouldn't that be awesome?</br>  <br>Good call, we can be pretty shitty 90% of the time here.</br>  <br>Yeah, this thread is pretty 10%.</br>  <br>If they didn't have Bazett in the main series, I doubt it's something they would hold out for the BDs. Ufo either decided it wasn't relevant enough to UBW or they're saving her for HA.</br>  <br>She was indirectly mentioned in episode 14.</br>  <br> HA <br>How would they even do it? TV series? OVA? How much SOL, how much backstory, how much plot?</br></br>  Google translate synopsis from something in the volume release<br><br> Nasu mushroom teacher also talks about one page plump this Komikaraizu the guest comment. <br> This Komikaraizu planning seems to have apparently moved from two years ago. <br><br>  Tasukuona's "Nasu-san. Although I what an even say such things in the opposite station" <br>  Nasu wrote: "Yes, what'll we currently Bucchigiri first place Kusoya ...... <br>  Nevertheless, your friendly Tasukuona's. <br>  Watakushi, only Tsumo up of the parent because soon jump unlikely but please forgive me. " <br>  Tasukuona's "do not do such outrageous conduct. I'm a serious story, <br>  Hayate decades from playing Fate. <br>  ... In fact from the time that, I wanted to try to cartoon of cherry root. <br>  Experience in this three years I was loading. There is also a strength for the simultaneous series. <br>  First or Ron would not get to hear just talk, <br>  The Doraron, fly in the parent twice and Kinoko~o!

After it is generally true story. <br><br> Nasu-san and Tasukuona who is revealed the inside story of the impact is the fact that Mahjong fellow. <br> Komikaraizu cherry route did not go up also in the planning because difficult than the other two routes. <br> Dare had appeared to be going psyched from their to there is not that Tasukuona's. <br> I heard also enthusiasm to sell from their own, I think love is what is also substantial to work. <br> Even so, Na's this two people fun w </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's completely incomprehensible.</br>  <br>Something about Mahjong</br>  <br>Still a far cry from showing her in the flesh.<br><br>OVAs makes the most sense, given the nature of the Majora's Mask-esque progression. A series of vignettes with about 1/4 of them being the main story sounds balanced.</br></br></br>  <br>Please Takeuchi, no more ahoges. Just get Sakura's curves right and we'll be fine.</br>  <br>That's not an ahoge, that's just a strand of hair.</br>  <br> cartoon of cherry root </br>    <br>The common joke to say right now is that rather than being gay, that's masturbation. Truthfully though, it's just gay.<br><br>Shirou and Archer have the same starting points, but their end points will be different. They're two distinct individuals, and if one plows the other's man hole, then that's one separate being fucking another.</br></br></br>  <br>C'mon anon<br><br>What could possibly be gay about two men getting intimate in a sexual nature? What could possibly be homosex about two men getting together and having some man on man time? <br><br>You're out of it, nothing about that sounds gay at all, its one of the most hetero activities you might find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shirou is no longer alone. Archer is waiting for him in the future. <br><br>Gay</br></br></br>  <br>Scans from Newtype are out? Got anymore?</br>  <br>Saber isn't relevant in UBW either but they still inserted a bunch of half-assed flashbacks in episode 21.</br>  <br>Saber is a semi-relevant side character in UBW. She roughly gets the same character arc as she did in the Fate route, it's just not front and center.</br>  <br> Heaven Feel's PV is 4 shots of Sakura turning around </br>  <br>That's all they animated. That shit ain't coming for years.</br>  <br> and if you know her character she wants to just be normal around him since that's her sanctuary. <br><br>And that makes her a selfish manipulative bitch. If you care for someone you fucking tell them what's up. No excues. Sakura has nothing but execuses and she's a pain to deal with. Just tell him you can do magic, Don't let him nearly suicide himself every night when you know it's a bad method you fucking bitch! And Sakurafags clam that she loves him?</br></br></br>  Thank you for all your time, effort and interest, HF manga team!  <br> Prin- <br> touts <br><br>It should be print-outs, anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>No Fate/hollow ataraxia content, I think.</br>  <br><br>&lt;3</br></br>  <br>...but in the end, it doesn't even matter.</br>  <br>You're kind of pushing this in her own direction entirely, and then going an extra ten feet with it.<br><br>A friend even if they don't explain everything that's up, just them asking you to do something for them is usually enough. You just go "You're my bro, so I'll listen seriously since you seem serious'. You can't always explain it to them right now, you listen to them if they're serious, and if you need to know what it was about after then they will tell you.<br><br>If she thought his life was seriously in danger with the grail war she would have done something more, but at this point it was still just a bad feeling for her.<br><br>She doesn't know magic any more than him to correct him about the proper way to do it. She was never trained at all, she was just abused. The most she could say is "Fucking stop, that's dangerous", but she can't show him anything correct. He wouldn't stop because "I just need to do this, if it can help anyone then I must" train, rather than him finding it fun or anything. He already knew exactly what he was doing anyway, there was no mistake so much. She's afraid that he would think differently of her if she showed her hand, she tried to solve it in an indirect manner without risking everything by just asking him to trust her and don't go out for the next day until she gets back.<br><br>If her hunch was nothing then it would be no big deal, and she would be back the next day to watch over him again. She's not really manipulating here, she's just afraid and it feels like her world is kind of breaking down since she thought she left this grail war bullshit behind giving her servant to Shinji, so she could go back to her normal life, only to find out it was uprooted anyway since Shirou was maybe chosen as well.<br><br>It's like "Was that all for nothing?". A passive feeling where you fool yourself that nothing will change here, but maybe its already too late.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl makes an appearance.</br>  <br>RIN A BEST!</br>  <br>Do you have a version with the text, based Heart?</br>  <br><br>With or without?</br></br>  <br>Without the text, please. It's great artwork.</br>  <br><br>This is the closest I have.<br><br>I could redraw the Fate Stay Night logo and maybe promotional art, but it would take me a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fine, thank you.</br>  <br>She's been with Shirou for a fucking year and thinks he'd listen to a request like that? She just wants to lock him away in her nice little happy place regardless of Shirou's feelings on the matter and that's selfish,anon. Sakura's love is a selfish love just like Saber's love is a ridiculously unrealistic one where she has to basically degrade herself mind,body and soul just so that Shirou can take the lead. It really shows that Nasu did not set out originally to make her or Sakura Shirou's lovers and that they were shoe horned in like that because eroge.</br>  <br> She was never trained at all, she was just abused. <br>This is pure bullshit. He thought her magic.</br></br>  <br><br>Small filter and leveled.</br></br>  <br>You're really great at this, Heart. What's your secret?</br>  <br><br>Hard-work and patience.<br><br>The truth? I do it with utmost care. Every small detail is important to me, I look at every that needs to be done and I do it over and over again until I'm happy with the outcome. And then, when I hand the product over, I see another small detail that went unnoticed and tell myself I'll do it better next time.<br><br>I enjoy what I do, I suppose that's the secret.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any projects you're working on or are you a free lancer?</br>  Great work! It was a great read can't wait for the next chapter.  <br><br>Started doing redraws with this very manga, you tell me.<br><br>The only reason I'm working on this is because HF is my favorite route.</br></br></br></br>  <br>domo</br>  <br> those expecting puppy eyes <br>too cute</br></br>  <br><br>Excellent. Another round of Count the Senpais. I'll go get the booze and see how long I last this episode.</br></br>  <br>Don't die.</br>  <br><br>There's only been 40 Senpais in the Manga so far. That's not enough to kill me. Now the movies, that's probably going to put me in Hospital. If I do die, I've left instructions for someone to notify /a/ and give my Obituary. 'It was worth it for best girl'.</br></br>  <br><br>And that was Six. So 46 Senpais in the HF Manga so far.<br><br>My eternal quest to destroy my liver continues...</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Are you people actually autist?</br></br></br></br>  What is our first fight scene? Saber vs Lancer, right?  <br>What's she thingken about?</br>  <br>Where do you think we are?</br>  <br>Smug-chan!</br>  Wait, did Shirou dream about Caliburn in HF?  <br>He gets visions of things from archer's arm.</br>  <br><br>They're really good</br></br>  <br>But he hasn't gotten Archer's arm yet.</br>  Worst first episode of the season?<br><br>Also, this is one mad battle station.</br></br>  Yaoi is not angry  I did it.   game doesn't even allow you to track quest progress <br><br>Why is the game design so fucking shit?<br>Are they too poor to pay their devs or something?</br></br></br>  <br>What? Do you need more than 50 and 80% markers?<br><br>Go find some easier game to play.</br></br></br>  <br>Dumbest thing I have read today.</br>    The face just got revealed.<br><br>This nigga bizarre as fuck /a/</br></br>  <br>I'm more confused on why they think having an hourglass figure is hot blooded or manly. It just looks so out of place.</br>  I just want a crossbone gundam adaption  <br> BuffGundam ready to wreck everything. <br> Not manly. </br></br>  <br>It's not as bizzare as G-self at least. This has all the fundamental Gundam parts there.</br>  <br>What with its waist?</br>  There have been more bizarre "Gundam"s, though many probably don't count this because &gt;Vagan scum and AGE in general.<br><br><br>Maybe it comes apart, ZZ style. Just with two parts instead of three.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the gundam in the image is still "incomplete". The chest and waist is barely attached</br>  Is this going to be UC or it's own timeline?  <br>see<br><br>It looks under construction.</br></br></br>  <br> no tomino <br> no shit tier eureka seven designs <br><br>Well, cant be worse than shit-reco</br></br></br></br>  Looks ready to reckt some shit I like it.<br><br> Muh crossbone <br>lel even Hathaway flash has more chances to get animated than Crossbone</br></br></br>  So the latest chapter was interesting to say the least.<br><br>Keith explained a few gray areas but also created a new one, what the hell was Eren's Dad doing on the outside of the walls? Where did he come from? Was he from a human comunity outside the walls more advanced then the inside of the walls? He seemed to have had more advanced medical knowledge.</br></br>  He lived in a community that coexists with the titans. He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. Once he arrived at the walls he was found by the SL and brought inside the walls. MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). Grisha, being a doctor that specializes in studying titans, cured the city and won the Carla bowl.  <br>BRA are from areas that have been subjugated by MT, who is carrying out the will of the First King. They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. Once they discovered that Eren had eaten him they tried to instead bring Eren back so they no longer had to kill anyone.</br>  <br>Probably related to MT and BRA. He originally invaded as a spy but he grew attached to humanity, enough to marry a human and support humanity. He obviously lied about being too drunk, he had his memories from the start.</br>  <br>Hange was a real cunt this chapter</br>  <br>Or he was a doctor 100 years prior and was one of the first titans to be created and he wondered around like Yimir until he happens to eat a shifter and turn back into a human.<br><br>Hell he could be one of the original scientists working with the first king who created the titans.</br></br></br>  <br>The First King created titans as a means of warfare, with the goal of destroying all of humanity except for his own society, where there would be no conflict. MT is one of the warriors that he set out to accomplish that. There are other villages outside the walls, but they have all been subjugated by MT and his forces. The walls are comprised of his subjects that he gave the Colossal Titan serum to, and willed them into hardening themselves. They aren't shifters, so they can't be exposed to sunlight, lest they start destroying things.<br><br><br>That's possible too. However, I don't think it's that easy to come across shifters to eat. Ymir got lucky in that she was one of the first titans to enter the walls after Bert kicked the gate in. Then she found BRA's friend and ate him. Ymir didn't have the shifter power until the walls were under attack and only got it because MT sent a bunch of kids to do his dirty work and infiltrate the SL if necessary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She wanted answers and all she got was a guy crying about how useless he is and how he got cucked.</br>  <br>Grisha and monkey trouble are half brothers or some shit.</br>  <br>who would've thought keith was an ultimate cuck.<br><br>First by Grisha then by Erwin</br></br></br>  <br>He also probably felt feels when he saw Eren at training, he did say he looks just like Carla.</br>  <br>That's gotta be weird, seeing a 15 year old boy that looks exactly like you're waifu.</br>  <br>I just said feels I didn't specify what kind of feels.</br>  I wonder if Carla knew about Grisha's basement experiments.  <br><br> incoming eren rape doujin by the trainer </br></br>   This child isn't like you <br>OUCH</br>  /a/, I just wanted to let you know that you are already great...<br><br>Because you were born...<br><br>Into this world.</br></br></br></br>  Who's BRA and MT?  <br>MT = Monkey Trouble<br>I forget BRA<br><br><br>Was this the mangaka's way of letting us know Eren will never get more development?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BRA - Bert Reiner Annie<br>MT - Monkey Trouble</br></br>  <br>typical shonen mom trump to make all the virgin reading feel special.</br>  <br> Was this the mangaka's way of letting us know Eren will never get more development? <br><br>Or maybe that he's special because he isn't special? Unlike manlet, Mikasa and Historia who are all special snowflakes.</br></br></br>  <br> chief kieth: EREN PUT ON THIS WIG! <br> eren: D-DAME DESU SENSEI </br></br>  <br>How is Eren not the biggest special snowflake? He's a shifter and the coordinate at that.</br>  <br>He's written like the chosen one, but other characters try to force that he's not. Eren is the biggest one out of all, even Isayama said he wasn't flawed enough.</br>  <br>Why Grisha stole the Coordinate? Why he chose to die?</br>  <br>I know, I was saying he's the biggest special snowflake too.</br>  <br>Carla looks really hot.</br>  <br> Carla's mom <br> Literally Eren with long hair <br><br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MT is Grisha's senpai and he just wanted to be noticed.</br>  this manga reminds me of that show Lost<br>and Lost became  shit </br>  <br>I know right?</br>  <br>Maybe She admired his and was dissapinted he retired, and now she heard his shitty excuse she got mad.</br>  <br> And you Mister. You shouldn't let people sweet-talk you like that, you know <br><br>Was Carla alpha?</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, there are some threads in this board where you can lurk desperately and make countless post, and yet gain nothing,</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128004956 <br> Saved. <br>You mean my webM right?<br><br> tfw someone finally notices how cute as fuck my webM is </br></br></br></br>    <br>Eren looks cute in that barmaid dress.</br>  <br>Carla was the manliest Jeager in the manga.</br>  <br>I don't get it why he decided to die? He was leaving the key to save humanity with a kid. That's too much faith in the next generation.</br>  <br>Alpha women aren't manly they' are just sexy as fuck.</br>  <br>Because he genetically modified Eren to be able to use the powers of the First King. The basement is filled with the corpses of failed clones.</br>  <br>Because Grisha is Eren. Plot twist</br>  <br>I want her to dominated me.</br>  So BR chapter next month?  <br>kek u gay</br>  <br>Jesus Christ how horrifying</br>  <br>mmm Carla femdom would be sooooo hot</br>  <br>The resemblance is uncanny.<br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean it in a bad way or in a "she's a man" kind of way, Carla was the Alpha Jeager and that's arousing.</br>  <br>Keith did say that he looks like her. Cue<br/></br>  <br> that's arousing <br>Please don't tell me you text those babes on tinder "that's arousing"<br><br>Don't say that shit again.</br></br></br></br>    Would Mikasa a Carla? Would Grisha a Eren?  <br>nah, Mikasa abandoned the fuck outta Carla</br>    <br> He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. <br>He might've been a titan shifter already and he probably made the serums himself seeing how he knows so much about the human body to be a doctor. <br>I'm wondering why his clothes were messed up when he met Keith. He got messed up before he shifted or after somehow.<br><br> MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). <br>Grisha's smart af so if he was running from MT, I think he would've chose which outer district to be found nearby and taken in. <br>Those plagues are pretty different. The one that hit Connie's village looked instantaneous while the Shigansina one killed people slowly. <br>The plague that hit Connie's village looked instantaneous because they all came out in separate areas where if it was slow, they'd all go to a hospital nearby altogether like how everyone came to Grisha in Shigansina. I also doubt Grisha was able to save everyone before they died from that plague too and if it really was the same plague that MT used on Connie's village, they should've seen some titans too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Granny Historia.</br>  <br>SnK: Peaceful Rural Life edition</br>  <br> Would Mikasa a Carla?  <br>Mikasa is erensexual, it doesn't matter if there is anyone that looks exactly like him she'll still be hopelessly pining for her husbando<br><br> Would Grisha a Eren? <br>Pretty creepy to fuck your kid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real? It looks so badly drawn even for Isayama.</br>  <br>why is Armin jacking himself off???</br>  <br>Why is Eren squeezing Armin's ass?</br>  <br>He is thinking about when he lost his virginity</br>  <br>His hands are in his pockets, fag.</br>  <br> fag <br> implying EAr is homo </br></br>  <br> They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. <br>iirc, one of their main objectives was to kill all of humanity which is not the will of the First King. read that chapter when Bert and Reiner are chatting when they have captured Eren and Ymir.<br><br>Also if capturing Grisha their main objective, I think they would've taken Eren after hearing his last name and that he was from the same district they attacked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look's like Isayama's art, though there are a lot of good imitation artists.</br>  <br>I suppose it is real since Editor-kun posted it.</br>  <br>Would Ymir a Armin? </br>  Two theories.      <br>End of theory one.</br>    <br>End of theory two</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128010024 <br>It's Team Manlet minus manlet.

Are they that easily triggered by YH?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128010024 <br>But Armin is almost right on top of Eren and Mikasa is staring intently at him, even though Eren is staring in the distance. There's no EH shippingfaggotry happening, so stay calm.</br>  <br>They get triggered when their precious EH gets no pandering.

Back when I was just getting into the series my original theory regarding the Colossal Titan was that 60 meters titans were the normal out in the rest of the world and the 15 meter ones scratching at the wall were the small titans. <br>I still sort of hope that's true.</br></br>  Is Mr. Hansi man or woman?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011418 <br><br>Please go back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br>There's a full theory in the book about how Titans in the North would be bigger. It uses the migration patterns of bears as an example. <br><br>I thought the implications of BRA's village getting attacked was more interesting though.</br></br></br>  <br>In the official translation someone responded to her with a "Yes, sir".</br>  <br>There was something about Isayama asking them to switch between male and female pronouns. <br>I still think he was just butthurt that someone even asked about it in the first place.</br></br>  <br>If he doesn't like a question he'll just give a bullshit answer to fuck with the idiots. Reminder that it's okay to read Armin as a girl if you want to.</br>  <br>Didn't he ask them to use neutral pronouns?</br>  <br>I guess he never studied English because that isn't really possible.</br>  Even if you're countershitposting don't reply goddamn  <br>So this means that CT can explode at will then?</br>  <br> I still think he was just butthurt that someone even asked about it in the first place <br>He was cool with the questions about Nanabs sex he said she's 100% female. hanji was meant to be a shemale since the beginning.</br></br>  <br>Isayama went to America for school.

Hajime Isayama (Attack on Titan; 234 points) </br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>It's possible but it just sounds like you are talking about an object rather than a person.</br>  <br> who is carrying out the will of the First King. <br>?</br></br>  <br>Only if you're talking about a hypothetical situation or if you don't know whether someone is male or female. Like if you're talking about solving a crime and you refer to the criminal as "he". If you know the gender of the person it can no longer be used in a neutral way. The only way you could get around saying "he" or "she" is if you just refer to them by their name every time which will sound awkward when done constantly.</br>  <br>Because he doesn't like her?</br>  <br> The First King created titans as a means of warfare, with the goal of destroying all of humanity except for his own society <br>There is nothing implying this, only that he was a coordinate who runned wild.</br></br>  <br>She's a  wesome. </br>  <br>I wonder if his time in America is where he got the idea for 3dpd Shotawin.</br>  <br>He got it from a music video.</br>  <br>That guy doesn't fully look like Erwin to me.</br>  <br>That's what Isayama said though.</br>  So do we have a status chart for ch 71?  <br>Keith is a cuck<br><br>Eren is still annoying <br><br>Hanji is a little insensitive in this chapter</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren wasn't annoying at all.</br>  <br>Yeah, let's be honest. Eren was cute this chapter.</br>   Mikasa/Ymir/Reiner cucked at the same time <br> keith cucked <br><br>who's next?<br><br>can no one stop isayama the madman?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Learn to spoiler, at least the OP</br>  <br>literally nothing is given away by the picture or post.</br>  <br>Mikasa and Carla pls.</br>  I never saw the q&amp;a image for this chapter posted. I saw someone write the answers although they seemed more like jokes.  Is this Mikasas jealous face?  <br>Here: <br>Q: Does Erwin use gel or pomade?<br>A: He uses hair styling products. He's particular about it.<br>Q: Were Eren and Armin not with their other batchmates a lot?<br>A: There was once a rumor going around that the two of them were too close.<br>Q: Is the emblem on the soldiers' uniforms embroidered? Or printed?<br>A: Embroidered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Mikasa feels emotion as we do. </br>  <br>That's her cuck face.</br>  <br>Historia is a midget</br>  WHY THE FUCK ARE THESE FACEBOOK GOERS STILL MAKING THREADS? GO BACK TO FUCKING FACEBOOK AND STOP MAKING GENERALS<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>are you ok? do you need a sit down?</br>  <br>So if eren was in trouble Mikada wouldn't save him because she feels no emotion?</br>  <br>hawt</br>  <br>She's programmed to protect him by Grisha.</br>  <br>Why does it look like Armin is grabbing his unsheathed cock on that cover?</br>  <br>Because Eren is grabbing his ass.</br>  <br>no she feels emotion, just not the same way we do, she's some kind of Eren dick seeking robot.</br>  <br>Too much</br>  <br>So what would she do if Eren was having sex with historia and she caught them?</br>  <br>She knows what's happening and she knows there's nothing she can do to stop it. She can only watch. <br><br>Oh, thanks. Wish I could find the image too. <br>I feel kind of embarrassed imagining Erwin trying really hard to style his hair to look good.</br></br></br></br>  Levi a best.
