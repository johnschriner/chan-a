[ post all reasons as to why saki saki is best grill  <br>I came up with all of it on the spot. Why do you ask?<br><br><br>Indeed, the author is the omnipotent God of the series so his word is law when it comes to these things. Regardless it doesn't change the fact that some people may have interpreted the story a different way than he intended.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't even specifically talking about the MarySue-ness or Iroha. My post was directed more at Irohafags as a whole.</br>  <br> she's fake I tell you fake! <br> look at how fake she is! <br> thinks that her being a sly person means she's being fake <br> thinks these are good points <br><br>Ok kid, that hugbox of yours seems pretty damn comfortable. Must be good not understanding how actual human beings interact or anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sues don't earn their sue status, otherwise they wouldn't be sues.<br><br>What you're saying is Iroha developed from someone shallow and lacking in positive traits into how we know her now. I'd say that easily disqualifies her as a sue.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess that could work but seeing as how they are fishing for replies anyways wouldn't you think it'd be easier just to ignore them entirely? Eventually they would get bored and leave.</br>  Is this still going to happen?  <br> some people think she's hot <br>She was like six years ago in that Woody Allen film.</br></br>   it's ends up being a near perfect adaptation of the first movie   <br> Scarlett Johansson </br>  <br>It's a yearning for validation, people believe that if good movie adaptations of anime exist more people will like anime and they won't look weird when they say they like it.</br>  <br> Wanting validation from normalfags <br>Who are these people and why are they on my Chinese cartoon image board?</br></br>  When did a show genuinely make you laugh? Gif related.  <br> I laugh in almost every episode of Non Non Byori. <br><br>I think you're looking for the word "chuckle"</br></br></br>  Seto no Hanayome<br>Love Lab<br>Binbougami ga</br></br>    <br>Better than not remembering the last time you laughed.</br>  high school boys  Why is Fuuka so fat?      <br>Blue boards are for faggots.

Him destroying random planets either because their food tastes bad or if 1 person picks a fight with him doesn't really count as a profession</br></br>  <br> What's the purpose of a God of destruction? <br>It's to balance out the universe constant creation. The planets he chooses to destroy though are solely based on how he feels. It's not like he's some kind of moral compass of choices of things to destroy. He just does whatever he wants based on how he feels.<br><br>Because, you know, he is a cat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> dragon quest <br> cool <br>Maybe if you're a kid.</br></br></br>  Why is Archer somehow popular again?<br><br> I should never have become a hero. <br><br>What's there to like about a self-loathing guy like that eternally whining over his ideals?<br><br>There are plenty of other heroes who met horrible ends without any complaints.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cool <br> confident  <br> cynical-asshole that can piss anyone off <br> has pretty rad abilities  <br> GAR </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This new Saber design is too good. Absolutely gorgeous.</br>    <br>why is assasin not at the temple</br>  <br><br><br>He's right, though. My dad works at TYPE-MOON, what this guy's saying is true.

This is Maron, which is someone else.</br>  GuP etc  <br><br>Page 02:<br><br><br>The modern lit teacher is a descendant of that John Browning you say??<br>... severe earthquake occurring!!!<br><br>*Noisy/commotion*<br><br>Say, did you hear?<br>Hey~<br>___________________</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7 done, 14 to go</br>  <br>well, that can happen when you play too much volleyball, i guess.</br>  <br><br>Page 03:<br><br><br>As expected, this turned into a fuzz<br><br>And there I wanted all the students to receive him without his name being relevant...

It seems like it's pretty pointless and obsolete now  I miss the kooky colored subs, they were so comfy especially if its an SoL and matches the tone of the show.  <br>How about the ones where every character had a different color for their dialogue?</br>  <br>I can't imagine that's it's more difficult than asking the companies directly. If it makes sense financially then I don't see why they'd be against licensing the show(s) out.</br>  <br>They don't care about filthy gaijins especially the creators the only one who cares are jew publishers like JUMP</br>  <br>Based Commie subbing the shows no one sub.</br>  so will he ever become Jimmy kudo again or remain as conan for the rest of his life  <br>Nice try Conan</br>  <br><br><br> arabic dub <br> this name sounds like a pain to say, just remove a few letters. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded or what?</br>  I'm 36 volumes into the manga. There's these long batches of chapters that are basically filler, then you suddenly get interesting developments between side characters or with the main plotline out of nowhere. <br><br>At this point I'm more invested in Takagi and Satou's relationship than Ran and Shinichi's. At least they have chemistry.</br></br>  Kaito &gt; Shinichi<br><br>Aoko &gt; Ran</br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #6<br><br><br>Previous thread:<br><br>Remember to take it easy, for their sake.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know.<br>Seeing this, you've gotta wonder how worn out he must be right now.</br></br>  <br>He knows he overestimated what he could handle, at the very least.</br>  <br>Here are the names.</br>   tfw usually go to bed early <br> usually miss Sharkbro's deliveries <br> miss when he's taking requests <br> most likely will in the future <br> people who're in and Circlefags will still whine at you for missing </br></br></br></br>  <br>He did say, as an apology for being late and only doing lineart, that he was going to try to give everyone there a proper Sharkbro delivery eventually.<br><br>So, if he stays true to that, everyone who requested will have two Sharkbro deliveries in the end.</br></br></br>  Pretty nice.  <br> If he gets moved to the school <br>He wasn't asked to. <br>All she did was tell him using his powers would put him in danger, and that he should get a legal job.<br>That's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Periodic Table Powers <br>Does this mean...</br></br>  <br>Yeah sure whatever buddy. Then I guess selling organs of people would be perfectly fine as long is for muh family<br><br>That is your own problem and other people shouldn't have to be affected or humiliated for it regardless of the reason</br></br></br>  <br>Selling the organs of people requires you to physically steal them, unlike photographs which are not intrinsic to the person they're of and don't literally kill them when removed.</br>  Nao is a cute.

What's the point then.</br></br>  Scanlation Thread<br><br>What are you working on?</br></br>  Personally I think they are going after the wrong targets. The scanlators aren't making money off the titles... the aggregator sites like mangafox however are making boat loads and they make it so simple for people to get the scanlations that most never buy the physical copies.  <br> Tokyo Ghoul, the manga itself has been translated AND scanlated twice <br>Ain't that other group doing it with tank scans?</br></br>  <br>It's not going to change anything. Whenever a group closes down there will be others to jump in that don't care about C&amp;D letters.</br>  Guys, does anyone know what happened to the people scanning Nanatsu no Taizai? Volume 15 came out around the time that Tokyo Ghoul:re Volume 3 came out and we "only" have roadagain scans. Meanwhile TG's complete raw was on all sites a few days after the release. Normally a NnT volume is on shobon-next/dl-zip and other raw related page including jcafe24 a week after the release, but it's been well over a month.  Look at the monster musume manga. They kept bitching about "muh redraws" and "she's too busy!" But when someone did a crappy release.<br>Few days later, that group resolved its issues!<br>even releasing 2 chapters too! now that's professional!</br></br></blockquote>]
