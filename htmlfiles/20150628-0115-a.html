[ What questions have you always wanted to ask about chinese cartoons but were afraid to?  I can't say.<br>I'm afraid to.</br>  Why do pedos try to hid behind the label of "lolicon"?  whats the point of 3x3 threads, anyway? What's the mission statement exactly. Is it just "heres 9 things I liked" or are they organized in some meaningful way?  <br>They're the "Mod approved" rec threads.</br>  <br>It's circlejerks, basically.<br>They're praising each other for their patrician tastes and knowledge of anime. That's what the threads are about.</br></br>  What are the roots of Emotional iconology (sweatdrops, anger veins, gloom lines, etc) and how have they evolved and expanded over the years  How are all the newfags finding this board?  How exactly can you tell what medium an anime was animated in? old ink cells, weird digital animator software vector stuff, "handdrawn", and drawn but with tablet?  <br>I'm really loving this Canada meme</br>  <br>Pre 2000s was mostly cel shaded you can tell pretty easily.<br><br>Early 2000s had that shitty "not quite right" digital style as seen in pic related. Now digital animation is more clean and nice in HD.</br></br></br>  <br>reddit and google</br>  <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br>  Why?  what animes should i watch?  <br>1) boku no pico<br>2) Shirobako</br></br>  <br>Watch shows off /a/'s wiki or whatever piques your interests on /a/.<br><br>You'll watch a lot of shit but eventually you'll develop your own taste and watch what you want also we like to spell the plural as "anime"</br></br></br>  Why do the nips have onomatopoeia for everything?<br><br>Also, does the still of that gif look like a chink Yotsuba to anyone else?</br></br>  Do you still enjoy anime or has it become a chore?  <br>I just lurk /a/ and if a picture/gif/webm interests my I find the source and add it to my backlog.</br>  What is the viewing order for NGE? Original 1-26, then the directors cut episodes then EoE? Then the new rebuild stuff? Help!!!!!!!  <br>I enjoy it, but it's a chore if I get out of the habit. Takes me weeks to get back in the rhythm.</br>  <br> Why do the nips have onomatopoeia for everything? <br><br>It's a mystery.<br>http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.j<wbr>p/qa/question_detail/q127992112</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Original 26, EoE, don't bother with the rest. Evanjell-o is shit, the only reason to watch the original series is because it's required watching for /a/</br>  <br>There is no required watching for /a/.<br>Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to take a chill pill.<br>The only requirement /a/ has is that you watch/read a few hundred titles. But no particular title is mandatory.</br></br></br>  <br>It's "required" in the sense that if you ever admit to not watching it people will bitch at you for the rest of the thread. It's just easier to watch it and get it out of the way.</br>  <br>Evangelion's basically required viewing in a literal sense, in that you almost can't browse /a/ effectively without at least knowledge of it. It's referenced too much.</br>  <br>It gets referenced all the time.</br>  <br> people will bitch at you for the rest of the thread <br>No, they won't - unless you're generally an ass or evidently a newfag or mouthing off in an NGE thread, obviously.<br><br><br><br>Not really.<br><br>I would recommend trying it, because I like it and think it's pretty good. But if you don't like it, drop it and just avoid NGE discussions. It's not difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do spoilers and spoiler scans work?<br><br>How do people get the newest chapters without themt being released in japan?</br></br>  <br>All the time.</br>  What's the difference between ai, koi and suki?  <br>By reference, do you mean "Rei-clone"?<br>That hardly requires you to watch NGE to understand. Sure, you may not know what kind of person Rei is, but the clones aren't proper Reis either, so there's no need to know the original.</br></br>  <br>Magazines get sent to shops in advance of their release and then some shop workers scan and upload these.</br>  <br>http://za-sh.com/difference-love-44<wbr>60.html<br>http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2134166<wbr>671986505801<br><br>好き is just like, either romantically or not.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Found it through tumblr spoilers, actually.<br><br>Question: Does Pixiv Expunged exist?</br></br></br>  Why are most anime fans so autistic? I was going to join my university's anime society thinking it would be nice to meet some people with the same interests as me.<br><br>Then I saw their fucking promotional video. Acting like anime characters isn't cute, it makes you look mentally disabled.</br></br>  <br>So, as someone who enjoys NGE, do you recommend the other stuff that the first anon said was shit? I'm on episode 16 and enjoying it thus far</br>  <br>Are you a landwhale?</br>  <br>Ahahaha same here anon, I thought it would be a place for me to make friends but I saw their facebook page and decided I'd rather be friendless. Thankfully 2nd semester I found my crew but holy cow they are fucking embarrassing. They are even throwing a make shift convention together next Spring which I may show up to with my friends shit faced so we can fuck around</br>  <br> Early 2000s had that shitty "not quite right" digital style as seen in pic related. Now digital animation is more clean and nice in HD. <br><br>It still looks like absolute shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The TV show + EoE is basically the way to go.<br>Don't touch the manga.<br>I haven't tried the compilation movies, but I'm not aware of them having any value beyond just summarizing the show.<br>Rebuild. Well, I'm not particularly fond of it, but if you wish to discuss NGE on /a/ you'd better know it. It's the biggest thing at the moment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They all have shit taste, too.</br>  Are there people you can get to buy shit for you at comiket?<br><br>I haven't found anyone so far</br></br>  So there's all these season of Fate/Stays, do I watch in release order?  <br>I haven't watched eva yet, nor a lot of required watching. I browse /a/ just fine and when I feel like getting to those shows I will.</br>  <br>Alright, thank you anon. I googled it, but its hard to get a solid opinion because most of the people saying what to watch are ravid fan boys. Currently working my way through the "classics" per say. Nice to get some helpful anons for once. Also side note, just finished the episode where Kaji shows Katsuragi Adam, and I feel like that was foreshadowed pretty heavily beforehand but maybe I just predicted it I'm not sure</br>  <br>Hardly.<br>And now that moot's gone you more than likely won't have to worry about not having a clue why a fucking bike horn has been playing for the past 5 hours one day.</br></br>  <br>I think you confuse ''people who make it really obvious they are into anime'' with ''people who are fans of anime''<br><br>Just like every hobby,the loons who annoy everyone give the medium a bad rep.</br></br></br>  Why do people praise the F/SN VN when it's mediocre at best in all three routes?  How furious do you get when someone insults you're waifu?  <br>I watched NGE only in 2010. Since I was a fucking newfag I did get into stupid shit on a regular basis, but it was never NGE related.</br>  <br>Cause it was their 1st or 2nd VN.</br>  <br>Do not watch any release by studio DEEN,they are terrible. Watch Fate/zero followed by Fate/stay <br>UBW 2014/2015 edition.<br><br>It is highly recommended that you read the VN first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why is Ping Pong the Animation giving me the feels?</br>  <br>It's shit but shounenshit fags love it.</br>  <br>Zero, then the UBW series that just ended.<br>Watch Prisma Illya whenever. Same with KnK.<br>Ignore the DEEN FSN from 2006, their UBW movie, and  Tsukihime. <br><br>If you're gonna read the VN, probably do that first, but there are hordes and hordes of secondaries, and we all get along just fine without reading it.</br></br></br></br></br>  how many of /a/ did actually watch boku no pico and how many did actually fap to it?  <br>Back in the day we often watched it together with other anons. It was fun, fapping in unison.</br>  <br>What is watashi's true name?</br>  <br><br>Is this a delicious cake, can't tell by thid picture?</br></br>  how many hours of anime until I turn ultra virgin and start decorating my room with anime merchandise?  I'm not seriously afraid of asking this but rather the few times I have asked this I never get proper answers.<br>why is NTR looked at so poorly?</br>  Oh<br>Why do you guys pretend you weren't all over Katawa Shoujo's dick in the time leading up to and the time following it's release?</br>  <br>Do you like getting cucked?</br>  <br>I've never had a girlfriend so it's not as if I could answer you sincerely.</br>  <br>I'm guessing because people think it relates too much to actual women.</br>  Why do we watch anime?  <br>escapism</br>  Why FSN franchise is so famous in /a/? Its so-so VN for me.  <br>Do you have a waifu?</br>  How do I understand those ranking lists where they show how much people have pre ordered current anime dvds blue-ray?  <br>Why can't we watch non-anime to escape?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>EOPs.</br>  <br>it's too realistic</br>  <br><br>anime and anything related to it is about escapism, a perfect world were average dudes are loved by hot chicks. NTR is kinda of a reminder of reality or what they fear it would happen. The buzzwords wish fulfillment and self-inserting don't exist for nothing m8.</br></br>  <br><br>A hole that gets filled by anime. Also i enjoy it and being on /a/ makes it a little bit more fun to watch.</br></br>  <br>Not all my h-doujins are about escapism. I'm not trying to escape into a world where octopuses and zombies are trying to rape everyone.</br>  <br>Oh for fuck's sake.<br><br>I can't explain it to you Anon, you will just have to use common sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Because.</br>  Why don't people lash out at "doujinS" with the same vigor they do at "animeS/mangaS"?  <br>I mean, I don't like war and stuff like that either, but it's enjoyable when it's fictional media, no? That's why I'm making this question, but escapism and wish fulfillment actually make sense as to why it's disliked.</br>  <br>So they don't trust their waifu enough and subsequently feel insecure around imagery of unfaithful women?</br>  <br>Probably because doujinshi feels more foreign/weeb-ish to say than just keeping the singular noun like you do with manga or anime.</br>  <br>Doujins is short for doujinshi.</br>  <br>On this note, why doesn't anyone lash out at "moe" being used instead of "moé"?</br>  <br>Ore</br>  Why is Love Live so popular? It's nothing special. The characters were mostly boring, some of them might as well not exist and the show wouldn't be any different. The drama at the end of season 1 was terrible. Second season had too many melodramatic and cringeworthy crying scenes, yet you can't get invested in those emotions because the characters were so boring and empty you can't feel anything for them. The songs are worse than your average generic j-pop. The CG looks creepy, Aikatsu handles that much better. Why is everyone jumping on this bandwagon?  How do I leverage my power level to get a girlfriend?  <br>Becasue americans don't like accents</br>  How the fuck do people get into idol shit? I consider it to be the lowest form of anime. The only time I tried watching one I cringed and questioned my manhood.  <br>Come on.</br>  <br>Because most keyboards don't have a key for that and most people don't know the alt code for it.</br>  <br>Chinese robots</br>  <br>The girls are cute<br><br><br>If a girl genuinely likes you maybe she wouldn't really care if watching anime is one of your hobbies, at most you would need to lower your time spend on it to spend time with her instead</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people still believe that doujin equals to ero-manga almost exclusively.</br>  What's wrong with being a "secondary"?<br><br>Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? Wouldn't it better to just wait for a live TL or actual release?</br></br>  <br>Depends what you're into. I hated IM@S but liked Love Live, and Locodol even more. If you watch it like any other I'm sure there will be at least one series that's enjoyable.</br>  <br>Oh somebody please. All the asterisks fry my brain.</br>  <br>  What's wrong with being a "secondary"? <br>Because people get jealous when they're shit manga/VN/LN isn't 'obscure' anymore.<br><br> Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? Wouldn't it better to just wait for a live TL or actual release? <br>Because they can either read Nipon to some degree, or can't wait for the release.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just pretend I do.</br>  <br>Because you don't like it yet.</br>  <br>Most likely to avoid being associated with both /v/ and the terrible KS fanbase.</br>  <br> What's wrong with being a "secondary"? <br><br>Cause secondaries usually know shit when the adaptation is bad. Although some "primaries" carrying in spoilers into the thread can make it real shit. Like Saekano recently, the threads were just all about what will happen in Vol. 7.<br><br><br> Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? Wouldn't it better to just wait for a live TL or actual release? <br><br>I dunno. Personally I know Japanese, so I give no fucks about translations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate it when LNfags have the nerve to call animefags secondary when they're the ones who is secondary to the main topic of this board which is anime and manga.</br>  <br>is korean manga better than japanese ?</br>  <br>Why is this thread not deleted yet?</br>    <br>I'll just use an example from the archive.<br><br>***,*62位/***,126位 ★ (**2,479 pt) [*,*37予約] 2015/06/17 響け!ユーフォニアム 1 [Blu-ray] <br><br>62 is the current preorder ranking on Amazon (lower is better)<br>126 is the previous ranking<br>★ means Blu-ray (an empty star means DVD)<br>2,479 is "preorder points", an estimation of well it will sell based on Amazon preorder rankings (higher is better)<br>37 is the confirmed number of preorders from nico (this number is always low)<br>the rest is just the date of release and the title</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's wrong with being a "secondary"? <br><br>Secondaries generally find the series later and ask questions that all the primaries know the answer to. They're effectively newfags for that series.<br><br> Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? <br>I assume you mean if they don't know Japanese (because otherwise it's obvious), in which case it's really just about getting what you can as soon as you can.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The exact same reason the other COUNTLESS amounts of threads like these were not deleted within the hour or so they were created.</br>  <br>On OS X it's option-e followed by the letter. On Linux it's composekey (whatever you set that up as) then ' then the letter.</br>  <br>Please don't spoon feed.</br>    <br>Wow, thank you.</br>  <br>And on Windows, which a majority of people use, it's some random fucking alt code.</br>  <br>The bigger question would be if you care about non-anime related things like espresso/espressi too.</br>  <br><br><br><br>éééééééééééééé<br>éééééééé</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Júst gèt yöürsêlf ä German keyboard.</br>  <br>áéíóúñ</br>  <br>It is /a/ related, you fuckwit</br>  <br>Not everyone lives in shitholes under the constant threat of being beheaded by narcos.</br>  Why do people feel the need to bring up the source material when i call their favorite anime shit? An example would be with UBW. Just because i play the vn doesn't mean the anime is going to suddenly be any better it'll still be shit.  <br>ěščřžýáíéóňďť<br><br><br>Czech Republic, faggot. I'm no fucking spic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br>Because moe is accurate.</br>  <br>Because they often claim that the original material is better than the adaptation.<br><br>Which if true in a lot of cases.</br></br></br>  Do people here actually think anime writing is any good? It's kind of hard to tell what's a ruse and what's real here sometimes.  <br>I don't see Light Novels up there, only Anime and Manga.</br>  <br>You mean plot or text?</br>  <br>I'll say vocal acting is good.</br>  <br>I'm sure others do but I dont but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy it</br>  <br>Pretty sure everyone here thinks the writing in one anime or another is good, otherwise they wouldn't watch it. Just don't expect anyone to ever admit it.</br>  <br>That's because moot is/was a secondary piece of shit.</br>  <br>No u</br>  <br>It depends on the show, obviously.<br>But yes, an anime can have good writing.</br></br>  <br>Why are LNfags so fucking arrogant?</br>  <br>I admit that I enjoy anime and that's all that matters to me. It interests me much more watching cute girls being cute than it does reading some wanker's whining about how cruel the world is and how everything is meaningless.</br>  <br>I don't see shitposting in title for /v/, yet that's all they do. So what's your point?</br>  <br>Cause they get to look down at secondary plebs like you.</br>  <br>Why are secondaries so ignorant?</br>  <br><br>But anon, you are the secondaries to this board. This is an anime and manga board, LN discussions are tolerated but not the norm. <br><br>Get back in your hole, scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br> get to look down on people <br> have to read light novels <br>that's inhumane</br></br></br>  <br>It's tolerated because it's related. How is it not? Half the shit that gets adapted these days come from ln</br>  <br>Because they read genre fiction for 14-year-olds.</br>  <br>Filthy /v/ crossboarder get the fuck outta here</br>  <br> LNs <br> good enough to grant status <br>what the fuck in the ever fucking fuck? LN is junk food literature</br></br></br>  <br>The main topic of this board is anime and manga so you will find loads of people who only enjoy anime, if you have a problem with those people then you can fuck right off since they belong on here a lot more than you.</br>  <br> shit <br>Correct, half of the shit out there does come from light novels</br></br>  <br> impying im a crossborder </br>  <br>It's no different than other television shows, theres a ton of shit but if you sift through it you can find some gems</br>  <br>If you aren't, why care so much about /v/?</br>  <br>boku</br>  <br>Are you seriously trying to imply that watching half assed cartoon advertisements for said books is better?<br><br>Come on, just admit you just don't like/know how to read. We all already know it.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't, I was using the retards for a point. Currently, you are the only showing any care about them, /v/-kun</br>  <br> Are you seriously trying to imply that watching half assed cartoon advertisements for said books is better? <br>Nowhere did I imply that. I just stated that LN readers feel superior because they read genre fiction for 14-year-olds. Which is true.</br></br>  <br>/v/ pls, who are you trying to fool?</br>  Do people really read LNs here?<br>All what I see in LN threads are "Muh summary" "Muh spoilers" but you guys actually read the books? And with that I mean, the japanese version, not some badly trasnlated shit at baka-tsuki.</br>  <br>It is superior to watching half assed, often unfinished, cartoon advertisements for said books though.</br>  /a/ would be a much better place if LNfags had their own containment board.  <br>They should feel superior.<br><br>Reading fiction made for 14 year olds is better than watching cartoons made for 14 years olds, which, most modern anime is</br></br></br>  Alright explain to me what the fuck a Series Composition person does and how does is it different from script/director.  <br>This is an anime board, if you hate anime so much then go away.</br>  <br>They choose the lighting in scenes, and the color palette, and all those other little details. <br>At least that's what someone said a few days ago in a Re-Kan thread.</br></br>  <br>Most are EOPs, and only the retarded feel superior about reading the source material, others tend not to care.</br>  <br>Nice reading comprehension. I never said I didn't like watching anime</br>  How can I quit?  What the fuck is this "BD" and where did the "6 billion" meme come from?  <br>BD = bluray disk</br>  I know if you have a new one every season then she's not your waifu, but what do you call the seasonal female character you fap to?  <br>You mocked people who watched anime(on an anime board mind you) and said LNfags were better, fuck off you snake.</br>  <br>Cheating</br>  <br>No this is<br>You are dumb for believing this<br>Series with someone who does Series Composition has them as the main writer who lays down the main plot<br><br>Honestly it's extremely cute</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh no.<br>Disregard that, I was wrong as fuck.<br><br>They actually do the narrative and sort out which episodes go where like when the beach episode should come and how the plot should progress.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't generalise, there are lots of digitally animated anime from the past decade that look great.</br>  <br>You should probably learn to differentiate between posters, that wasn't me you moron</br>  Does shojo romance exist in real life?<br><br>Does sex feel as good as vanilla doujins make it seem?</br></br>  <br>They choose how much content goes on each episode (You can blame them for shitty cliffhangers), who is writting it (If the series doesn't have already someone for the script) and what this anon said </br>  <br>A few autists make who flaunt their love of anime make normal people not want to be associated with them so they don't reveal their power levels. Retards ruin it for everyone.</br>  How do anime companies decide on OP/ED? What's the process behind it?  <br> Does sex feel as good as vanilla doujins make it seem? <br>Of course it doesn't. It's idealized sex.</br></br>  Just stopping by to say I like the idea of these threads.  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?  is definitely you otherwise you wouldn't have replied by referring to yourself in first person.<br><br>Just remember where you are at you dumb LNfag, an anime and manga board, they will always take precedence over your trash "literature".</br></br></br>  <br> Does shojo romance exist in real life? <br>I used shoujo tropes to get a gf irl years ago.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wz-<wbr>PtEJEaqY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I find it really tiring. Maybe I just need more exercise.</br>  <br>Dio.</br>  <br>Nice try anon-kun but you're wrong, otherwise prove it. I'm a filthy LNfag so you'll need to be detailed for me to understand</br>  <br>Ive acted like a dark and mysterious asshole for years, but it hasnt worked.</br>  <br>You need to be handsome to pull it off.</br>  <br>How am I wrong? The only reason certain LNs gets discussed on here is because they have an anime adaptation. Remember, this is an anime and manga board so save your holier than thou attitude somewhere else.<br><br>Secondary? My ass.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean arrogant creep.<br>I doubt many anons have the ability to pull of dark and mysterious. Also you have to be attractive.</br></br>  <br>Most of Denpa Teki didn't look that nice, if you ask me.<br><br>Either way, the animation department wasn't that important for that series.</br></br></br>  <br>Am I mustard ?</br>  <br/>  <br>I've been into similar anime situations like cockblocking, running from the girl you like and accidental falling on boobs, the outcome is usually dramatic instead of being funny, sadly.</br>  <br> That's a dirty kéyboard.</br>  <br>Your fingers are literally wiping the keys ALL THE TIME.<br>How do you let this happen?</br></br>  <br>Well what? the reverse applies too, nobody would give a tsundere the time of the day if she was fat and ugly.</br>  <br>Are you possibly mad anon? Are you mad because you are too illiterate to read a book and so you get upset when someone calls you out for being the secondary you are?</br>  <br>and now you're just throwing out insults, what's the matter? Can't handle the truth?</br>  <br>I read LNs and I cringe whenever I hear someone call them books.</br>  Why is streaming bad?  <br>gotta watch your cartoons in the highest quality so you can see all the QUALITY</br>  <br>Same reason streaming music is bad</br>  <br> disgusted keions <br>more like disgusting keions</br></br>  <br>Worse quality than downloads, less control over which sub group you get to use, streaming sites are usually filled with ads, you don't get to keep the files for offline or sharing with others</br>  Why can most of the questions here be answered with a single word, that word being autism?  <br>autism</br>  <br>6billion meme is from the climax of fate/zero</br>  <br>Na, stimulation wise I find masturbation more effective. However, when you got the right girl and flow it can be amazing.</br>  <br>What's wrong anon, can't handle the fact you have shit taste?<br><br><br>It's the difference between having a plate of actual shit and a plate of real nice food in front of you. Both have the same ease of access, but you take the shit anyway because its slightly 'easier' to get</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never distinguished quality beyond 128kbps, especially when I'm listening to a purely vinyl release, so why is streaming music bad?</br>  <br>I can have shit taste all I want, it doesn't make me any less wrong about anime and manga taking precedence over LNs on this board. LNfags are the secondaries, not animefags.</br>  Why are there people who would wait for a season to be over so they can start watching the anime from said season?  <br>I seriously can't hear the difference between streaming music and non streaming at all.<br>I feel like that's essentially the same as FLAC vs mp3</br></br>  Why are this board both anime and manga ? Why don't we have a manga board so we don't have to see shitty One Piece, Naruto or Jojo threads  <br>Mùgî seems to lïke it</br>  <br>They overlap too much.</br>  <br>You don't even seem to know what the term secondary means</br>  <br>Fuck having a manga board we just need a jojo containment board</br>  <br>/a/ in a nutshell</br>  <br>So they can marathon it.<br>Some people don't like waiting week after week.<br><br>I don't get how people do it with manga though. Waiting a week for 20 pages? That's insane. Especially when there are cliffhangers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer to marathon my series, or watch it in 3-4 episode chunks.</br>  <br>Manga threads are always dead.<br>/ag/ would be a better option, but /vg/ is pure cancer.</br></br>  <br> He préfèrs Moéshît threads to thé glorious Jôjô and OP ones </br>  <br>It is correct by the context of my post.</br>  <br>éééé ~</br>  <br>Because 萌え is rendered as "moe" in roumaji. There is no "accent" on the え in もえ, unless you are pronouncing it wrong.</br>  <br> jojo containment board <br> not waifu wars containment board </br></br>  <br>whý dó yóú týpé líké thát?</br>  <br><br>I think we can stop now.</br></br>  <br><br>These arent the answers I was hoping for</br></br>  <br>Jojo is much much worse.</br>  <br>What are your thoughts on /vg/? Only wondering, it sounds like a good idea in theory.</br>  <br> Read the manga <br> Loved it <br> Go to see if they are discussing it on /a/, since there was some thread before the anime starting airing <br> Is all memes, shitty shoehorned jokes and more memes. </br></br></br></br>  <br>KissAnime usually use good subs and you can stream the file directly by using the HTML5 player</br>  <br>Chicks dig guys with accents</br>  I don't understand how people can take waifuism seriously. They aren't actually real people. It's almost as dumb as falling in love with a rock. <br><br>I can understand collecting figures and shit as a hobby, but things like hug pillows creep me out. I personally shudder when I come across waifu threads and realize that all the sweet talk is really just a circlejerk between neckbeards.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget the rampant homosexuality</br>  <br> Not knowing the power of the foreign accent </br>  <br> I can understand collecting figures and shit as a hobby <br> explain it for me please? </br></br>  <br>No it isn't moron, you aren't using the term correctly. Explain to me how you are using it right<br><br><br>Generals are a bad idea, it just invites insane amount of circlejerking</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sort of. That's /mu/ for you where you're lucky to spot two albums you recognize in a whole fucking thread. On /a/ they work discreetly as recommendation threads, and I like them for that.</br>  <br>Have you ever walked into someone's house and seen art up on their wall and nice vases and little glass figurines?</br>  <br><br>There are varying degrees as to just how seriously people consider waifuism to be. Some people are more than capable of applying whatever ideal their waifu represents onto people in the real world, with some leeway given the differences between the two. Other people really do convince themselves that they would rather take a one-sided relationship with no chance of rejection so long as that relationship was never examined in a real world context. There's an entire spectrum of people and opinions between these two ends.</br></br>  <br>Generals = Criclejerks.<br>You can discuss the main topic, but that's because you can discuss ANYTHING in a general.</br></br>  <br>Anime and manga are the primary source of discussion on this board, every else is secondary and is only allowed if it is tied to a primary source.</br>  <br>legit waifu threads on /a/ are an abomination.<br><br>Dont let them dissuade you from falling in love</br></br></br>  <br> This, tumblr doesn't post in waifu threads.</br>  <br>Streaming is bad because creators don't get shit</br>  <br>The whole point of /mu/, if you can avoid the blatant shitposting, and Death Grips fans, is to recommend albukms to others.</br>  <br> They don't get anything unless you buy the Japanese BD/DVDs.</br>  Why are there so many fucking generals in /a/ and why the fuck aren't they being deleted? <br><br>2007 killed this place. Fuck everyone who came here after that point.<br><br><br> because creators don't get shit <br>They don't get shit from nyaa, bakabt, perfect dark, share, manga down sites, etc. either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does /a/ hate /v/?  Can you tell me how many of these you recognize? This is in no particular order or relevance to each other.<br> It's slowly coming this way!! <br> Why does she sit like that? <br> Filthy Mexican Half-Breeds inside me <br> Nyanpasu <br> Two years worth of semen <br> Who is this semen demon <br> Junko Junkie </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that really it though? figurines are just decoration?</br>  How do you cope with the emptiness you feel right after you finish a good anime/manga/VN/whatever?  <br>Because they are the same thing but with video games instead of /a/ related content. If there is something people hate nothing more it is a mirror.</br>  <br>Yeah, they're cute decorations.</br>  <br>The age difference</br>  <br>What about fictional characters in live-action shows? Would that creep you out less? And does it make a difference if the story is in a real world, or in a fantasy one (say Game of Thrones)?</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>I turn to my other hobbies</br>  <br>They're only a degree better than /b/ or /pol/, and probably at least 10 years younger than I am</br>  <br>then why did oreimo make a big deal out of it when Ayase asked Kirino about it?</br>  <br> 2007 killed this place <br>Stay mad 2007 fag<br><br><br> They don't get shit from download sites either. <br>Yeah but you don't support Americans<br>Paying for streaming is stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sit outside in the hammock with a cold drink and reflect</br>  <br> 3 <br>I'm a fucking newfag, ain't I?</br></br>   wake up <br> check /a/ <br> still no news about Hunter x Hunter <br>send help</br></br></br>  Next time I see HxH news on /a/ I'll probably have a heart attack from shock. I feel for the people who've been following it for a long period of time, hiatuses are really painful.   last update: september 2014   <br>Try and distract yourself by reading some other manga series. I reccomend Berserk.</br>   favorite main 4 <br> top 3 coolest hatsu from each category </br>   tfw following HxH from 2002   <br> tfw most of my favorite manga are on hiatus </br>  <br> hiatuses are really painful. <br>Clamp will finish X some day, too.</br></br>  <br>Please stop.</br>   Only on episode 34. <br> Watching it for the first time while /a/ begs for Togashi to take it off Hiatus. <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br> watching </br>  <br> not reading the manga </br>  <br> all the series I once read that ended years ago on a permanent hiatus.  <br>If they will ever be continued, I'd have to reread them, I guess. At least HxH manages to bring out enough chapter in a decade to keep it's story in mind.<br><br><br>It's a pity they didn't animate it like this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish Togashi would just draw like this all the time so we could have more frequent updates. No one reads HxH for the art.</br>  <br>You need help if you reed Hiatus X Hiatus.</br>  <br> I feel for the people who've been following it for a long period of time, hiatuses are really painful <br>Well you kind of get used to it, to be honest at this point I've completely forgot about HxH because I'm not expecting it to come back, it's too bad since they manga got really interesting but what can you do.</br></br>  <br>I do the same thing anon. It's pretty painful at this point.<br><br>The only day to really be looking though is SJ Thursdays, when HxH comes back it will be announced on the cover of the issue.</br></br></br>   gay yaoi shota shounen <br><br>I will never be interested in this waste of time.</br></br>  <br><br> New Shonen Jump <br> HE IS BACK (again, for real this time) <br> HxH fans around the world collectively cream themselves. <br> Togashi releases 3 chapters and announces a "few weeks off" due to health reasons <br><br>post yfw</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad for you<br><br>Dumb frogposter</br></br></br>  With all those hiatus, why no one is trying to get the HxH audience?<br>Some argue that My Hero Academia and even Black Clover is managing to stay alive by filling the hole left by Naruto, did Jump ever had a manga similar to HxH?</br>  <br> get the HxH audience <br><br>You act like HxH fans only read this series. I imagine some of us read your mentioned manga.</br></br></br>  <br> did Jump ever had a manga similar to HxH? <br>The original HiatusxHiatus is on permanent hiatus since 2006.</br></br>  /a/, what did Chrollo say to Neon?  <br>I still don't get why he was wearing that bandage.</br>  <br>You know, I finally understood why Kurapika wanted to be an Enhancer. I think that Enhancement and Trasmutation are the best categories if what you'll do the most is fight. <br><br>I thought Conjurers would function like mages or something like that, where they could use really powerful hatsus but they would run out of aura really fast. <br><br><br>I can only imagine. I'm going on a year now.<br><br><br>Wasn't he easily recognizable because of his Peter's Cross? I imagine that's why wore it. Goddamn, his design for this part was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurapika wanted to be an enhancer because it's the most balanced category for combat. If he didn't have emperor's time, Uvo's punches would have broken his spine.<br>I thought his hatsu was pretty funny, because it's pretty special snowflakeish but all it does is make him better at the most basic things like defense.</br></br>  <br> chicken <br>That's clearly a turkey.</br></br>  <br>stop reading shounen garbage</br>  <br>we facebook now <br> <br><br>as expected from this cancerous thread</br></br></br></br>  Do you think Togashi plans out the series plot during hiatus or after he's told he has a week to release a chapter or you'll get fired you useless piece of shit cunt?  <br>Yeah, I know why he wanted to be one. And yes, it is pretty funny. But I'll be sad if that's the only thing he uses ET for. I'm hoping he'll develop a hatsu for each category. Kurapika's smart, he can do it.<br><br><br>You really needed some quotation marks, dude. <br>And I honestly don't know. I imagine he has a rough draft in his head of where he wants to take things to, but will deviate if necessary. Something like "let the story write itself.'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What else did you expect from a shitty shounen thread? It caters to the lowest of the low.</br>  I can't understand why HxH is considered good tier when its creator keeps fucking everyone over.<br><br>Even Japan is sick of it</br></br>  <br>When you look at what happened with YYH and the fact that he has some pretty serious health issues, you can't really blame Togashi. I'd love more chapters, but all we can do is hope he recovers and starts drawing again.</br>  <br><br>Come on guys, we can wait 6 more months.<br><br>https://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/</br></br></br></br>  Reminder  <br>Gon &gt; Kurapika &gt; Leorio &gt; Killua<br><br>Specialist: Pika, Chrollo, Pitou<br>Enhancer: Palm, Youpi, Netero<br>Manipulator: Illumi, Shoot, Morel<br>Emitter: Leorio, Franklin, Knuckle<br>Conjurer: Jesus fuck this is hard.

I would have put Knov instead of Shizuku though.</br>  <br>Why did Pokkle and Ponzu have to die?</br>  <br>Because Pokkle is a weak faggot who took a qt to a dangerous mission<br>He probably also indirectly caused a lot more deaths because of his lobotomy</br></br>  <br>Togashi got tired of people shipping them because of filler in '99</br>  <br>Worst boyfriend ever. And he strengthened the enemy, what a cunt.</br>  <br>Reminder that he got beat by ants that didn't even know nen. That's pretty pathetic.</br>  <br>What is this, a hiatus chart for ants?</br>  Does Togashi just not want to do it anymore?  <br>If that was the case, he'd have done the same thing he did with YYH, not start a new promising arc. He seemed pretty inspired for that one, too.</br>  <br>Just read better manga.</br>  <br> HxH is making me gay </br>  <br><br>What, you disagree that this show is gay?<br><br>What the hell are you even doing in here then? We sexually lust over little boys in 9/10 threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4chan "made" a lot of people gay, anon. Just embrace it.</br>  <br>Suicide watch going strong.</br>  <br> Dude! No! Shota and gay porn are two different things! </br>  <br>Since when does how much you like an author affect how much you like a work? Berserk is also not good by your logic.<br><br>Hiatuses probably increase the overall quality when you think about it. Churning out weekly chapters leads to running out of ideas, poor long term planning, and generally just dragging on too long. HxH has probably benefited from all the time Togashi has to think about the story.</br></br></br>  <br> running out of ideas, poor long term planning, and generally just dragging on too long <br>chimera ant in a nutshell</br></br>  <br>Of the things you listed, only dragging on too long applies to CA. I don't like the length either but you're an idiot.</br>  <br>Did CA have too much character development for you?</br>  <br>Delete this</br>  <br>Trips of truth.</br>  <br>Except CA arc is the best example of taking your time and coming up with good ideas. It might have been a bit meandering at the start when the setting was being established, but the palace invasion onward was obviously thoroughly planned. Couldn't wrap up so many character arcs otherwise.</br>  Try being a NANA fan......sorry but I don't give a fuck about your 2 year hiatus when NANA has been on hiatus for 6.  <br>How many threads have you posted this in?</br>  <br><br>Just this one afaik, possibly 2 though that other one must've been months ago. Nana is a very popular manga and has a well known very long hiatus.<br><br>Sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all hiatuses are created equal. I loved Nana but I don't feel any serious urge to see the end, there wasn't as much half resolved plot as there is in HxH.</br>  <br>I was thinking of picking it up but i don't want to follow a 4th manga that is on permanent hiatus.<br> Is it worth it? </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br>Pitou is not a girl</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br>Pitou is pure you sick fuck.</br>  <br>Please don't.</br>  <br>Pure girls don't kill.</br>  <br><br>I think so but only if you can handle an unbroken haitus.<br><br><br><br>Disagree, I cannot even remember wtf was going on in Hunter x Hunter. Nana drops off at a crucial and life shattering point of Nana's disappearance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>If Togashi had planned it through, it could have been a solid arc and completed in much less time. Though I appreciate its ambition. Maybe he'll get it right with DC this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Nana has one big unresolved plot point, HxH has a bunch. You not being able to remember things doesn't mean they don't exist. <br><br>Battle shounen naturally has more going on than a story based on romance and friendship alone.</br></br></br>  <br>How does killing make Pitou a slut?<br><br>Togashi obviously had planned it. Shit, some things that were in the first 15 chapters were mentionned in the last few ones, and the character development of most important characters was gradual through the arc.<br>I know people like to shit on this arc but at least try not to be wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he </br>  <br> completed in much less time. <br>Considering your complaint is about the length, you probably take issue with the most well planned aspect of the arc, which is all the different plot points. Multiple storylines happening at once drag out the pace by necessity, but it also takes a lot of planning ahead to ensure each character plays an important role and all the loose ends are resolved.</br></br>  <br> scanlation </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br> implying <br>she's literally saint mary</br></br>  <br>in all version they use a male word , sorry</br>  <br> Maybe he'll get it right with DC this time. <br>Optimistic, aren't you? Enjoy your new cast of plot devices.</br></br>  I've never read much except the first chapter or something, is the art just like that in the weekly one?  <br> Enjoy your new cast of plot devices. <br>What<br><br>Yes, bakabt has the redrawn scans though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The japanese doesn't.</br>  <br>I have my fingers crossed that they won't be vessels for the narrative</br>  <br> that picture </br>  <br>I want to fuck Pitou.</br>  <br>I want to sexually pet Pitou.</br>  <br>I want to sexually molest Pitou.</br>  Who are you're favorite girls?  <br>Bisky<br>Palm<br> Pitou </br></br></br>  <br> wake up <br> check /a/ <br> Still no news of an Outlaw Star continuation.  <br><br>No really, this would have made a bigger impact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kite, Paku, Canary, Senritsu, Mito</br>  Would you give therapy to Gon?  <br>Pika</br>  <br>Why would you want to make a girl out of such a perfect boy?</br>  <br> boy <br>He's a man.</br></br>  Guys OP asked for help long timr ago did someone send him help?, are you ok OP?  <br>You don't understand, he's my favourite boy and favourite girl.</br>  <br>Posting Pika always helps.</br>  <br>Got a problem?</br>  <br> youtube thumbnail <br> forneverworld <br>Meruem wouldn't have wanted this</br></br></br>  <br>Bisky, Pitou and Paprika</br>  <br> Pitou <br><br> Pika <br><br> Pitou and Paprika <br>I know there's not that many girls but that doesn't mean you should post boys.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pitou <br> boy </br></br>  <br>Kurapika is a pure maiden. I have no idea what you're talking about.</br>  <br>Komugi, maybe Palm and Pitou too</br>  <br> that innocent look on Gon's face just before he threatens to kill Komugi <br>Damn</br></br>  <br>Gon was pretty intense during the invasion, but part of what made him so intense is how he seemed so calm about it.</br>  <br>Pika's bestness transcends gender.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Being so best shouldn't be allowed.</br>  <br>We cannot blame him for it. He never asked to be the best, he just is.</br>  <br>Gon</br>  <br>gross</br>    Am I the only one who likes HxH's art?  <br>It changes a lot, so it's hard to tell. I really like when Togashi actually tries though.</br>  <br>it's relatively simple, but it's great sometimes</br>  <br>I love it.</br>  <br>I love HxH's art, but it's secondary to the story.</br>  <br>Gon was so muscular before, what happened? Did the wish return the babyfat?</br>  <br>It's cool</br>  <br>That's not Togashi's art, it's some shitty redraw.</br>  <br/>  Best ant.  <br>It's okay, OP. You'll make it through as long as you love best boy.</br>  <br> posting worst boy </br>  <br>You being silly or something, anon? He's so sweet!</br>  <br>worst boy is illumi</br>  <br>Worst character in the damn series.</br>  <br>You're being pretty silly, too. He's so endearing that it hurts!</br>  <br>Illumi is best boy. Killua doesn't appreciate his perfect, kind older brother enough.</br>  Why are these threads so gay?  <br>is there a reason why togashi made him so unlikeable?</br>  <br> Killua best boy <br> Illumi worst boy <br>Holy shit anon, that is awful taste.</br></br></br>  <br>ENDEARING<br>NDEARING<br>DEARING<br>EARING<br>ARING<br>RING<br>ING<br>NG<br>G</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SHIT<br>HIT<br>IT<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said Killua is best boy. Killua is second best boy after Gon</br>  <br>To set him apart from Gon, I guess.</br>  if the zoldyck's wanted killua to be the new heir of the household, why didn't they immediately start training him nen?  <br>so he wouldn't use it to become independent too early. they wanted to control him. it didn't matter though because Gon claimed him anyway.</br>  Hisoka is obviously best boy.<br><br><br>It would have been harder to keep him under control. Remember how batshit insane and obsessive his mom and Illumi are?</br></br></br>  <br>They never said Killua was best boy; that was me. You really shouldn't assume things, anon. We didn't even type alike.<br><br>Maybe you think he's unlikeable because you have different taste, yeah?</br></br></br>  didn't HxH get axed by the publisher?  <br> filename </br>  <br>Will Hisoka ever win the Machi?</br>  <br> Remember how batshit insane and obsessive his mom and Illumi are? <br>That's offensive. It's personally reasonable for Illumi to want to keep his little brother out of harm's way. Look at all the trouble he's gotten himself into without Illumi's guiding hand there to protect and nurture him.</br></br>  <br>Fucking love this scene. It pretty much defines what Gon goes through during the Chimera Ants arc and the rest of the series too, but to a lesser extent. There are things that he is not able to tame in this world.</br>  <br> There are things that he is not able to tame in this world. <br>Like Killua's shit personality.</br></br>  <br> kil needs an isolated child to correct his behavior and train him like a puppy </br>  <br>His personality is endearing and cute.<br>Killua is very tameable.</br></br>  <br> His personality is endearing and cute. <br>That joke isn't funny anymore.</br></br>  <br>Gon tamed Killua very well. notice how as soon as he was no longer the center of Gon's attention is when Killua went to shit. Killua's personality disorder is medicated by boy love</br>  <br>His personality went to shit when he left home.</br>  <br>Illumi pls</br>  <br>Go to bed Illumi</br>  <br>his personality was always shit<br><br>he even acknowledged it</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why but this picture gives me butterflies in my stomach each time i see it.</br>  <br>It's because it's Gon and Killua being carefree as they'll never be again</br>  <br> His personality is endearing and cute. </br>  Man why does Togashi just doesn't get someone else to do the drawing and just do the story  <br>Because without Togashi's art it wouldn't be the same.</br>  <br>It's so ugly any other artist can imitate it.</br>  <br>I vote Murata</br>  <br> Togashi's art <br> ugly <br>Other than the scribble chapters can you post one page that you would consider ugly?</br></br></br>  <br>Every single one.</br>  <br>You didn't post a page, anon. Post one.<br> select the food <br> it's all food <br>I'm not sure how to feel about this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to post one when I said it's all ugly.</br>  <br>If it's all ugly you shouldn't have a problem finding an image that proves your point.</br>  <br>0/10</br>    <br>Murata is fucking great, but i still preffer the paneling and art of Togashi</br>  <br>Yeah, Murata's panelling feels a bit unnatural imo. If Togashi can hand him the storyboard then it's perfect though</br>  <br>Shit, I would just take the storyboard at this point.</br>  <br>Ho many can you name /a/?<br> Yugi <br> Yusuke <br> Ken <br> Bobobo </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously not able to name all of those?</br>  <br>I haven't read much shounen.</br>  <br>You should read more. Most of it is worth reading.</br>  <br>But anon, I'm not joking. His personality cute and I love him!<br>You just have different tastes than I do, and that's okay.</br></br>  <br> because a person who emotionally abandons his supposed best friend and can't show him any affection what so ever, yet still expects it out of said best friend is cute. <br> becaues a person who isn't there for their best friend when they go through an emotional breakdown and yet still guilt trips them afterwards is cute. <br><br>anon plz.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon always had a very small build.</br>  <br> girl </br>  <br>Mistakes don't define a person.<br>But, both of the things you've said have been pointed out within the series, so since it's been brought to attention that obviously means Killua will grow past being like that, reflect, and (maybe) apologize to Gon for it.<br>However, I don't wish to get into an argument over this. If you see him as a bad person, there isn't much I can say to change your mind, and as someone who's had this same argument several times I think it'd be best if we dropped this, and maybe you accept others have different tastes than you. I'm not sure why people saying they like Killua seems to set off so many people in these threads, but again, I suppose it's all up to taste.</br></br></br>  <br> h-he's not shit, he'll grow out of it! <br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>Fuck me, meant for </br>  <br>Anon I think you've been reading too much fanfic. No one ever called out Killua for being shit to Gon during the CA arc. And no one has ever called out Killua for being unable to show Gon any affection yet expecting Gon to show him it. Killua himself hasn't realize that he was shit to Gon and that he abandoned him, when Gon needed him the most. Instead Killua expected Gon to give him an apology for crap that mostly went on in his own head.<br><br>Is Killua a bad person no, Killua does this things without realizing that he's being hurtful. Does Killua have a shit personality that is in no way shape or form cute? Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Pituo doesn't have a gender, the only ant that reproduces is the Queen which means all the other ones don't really have a gender or are male.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure Alluka chastised him for his behavior.<br>Like I said, I do not wish to go through these motions again, just look into virtually any HxH thread and you'll find these same arguments.<br>I think Killua is a good person, and I personally like his personality. <br>Again, if you don't like his personality, that's your personal taste and I won't argue about it. There are plenty of people that do like it.<br><br>That's your interpretation/opinion. I don't really care how you see him. I like him, and your opinion won't change that.<br><br>Sorry if any of this came off as rude. I don't mean to offend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Comparing MHA to Naruto <br><br><br>They aren't even that similar I don't know why everyone is comparing them, if anything it takes more from one piece with all of the colorful and interesting characters and their interesting powers. We even know that Kohei is a OP fan as he sent in fan art when he was 15. Pic related to that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alluka only chastised him for the guilt trip, however she never chastised him for the other crap I mentioned, and no Alluka chastising him for guilt tripping Gon doesn't make the fact that Killua was guilt tripping Gon any better. It doesn't make Killua's personality any less shitty. All it means is that Alluka doesn't have a shitty personality and is able to recognize that there are somethings you just don't do.<br><br>All you can say to counter it is maybe Killua will grow out of it, but that's not changing the fact that he's shit in the present. Its not just the fact that Killua made mistakes that makes his personality shit. His personality is shit that's why he makes those mistakes.<br><br>Maybe it would be easier if you could say what about him you found cute, but its really hard to accept your opinion when the story shows that the things you find cute are in fact not cute at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm surprised /a/ likes HxH so much.<br>After watching the first few episodes I felt like it was gonna be lackluster as fuck but episode 3 or I think two turned around after seeing how based Gon was.</br>  <br>Well, I find a lot of things about him cute (outside of physical aspects). <br>He seems to dress how he wants and doesn't care about how it looks, he's mischievous, cheeky, can be a bit snarky, and confident. He has a huge sweet tooth and a horrible tendency to take poor care of money he earns. He gambles, he's messy, he gets embarrassed easily, and he's logical, loyal, and kind.<br>I think Killua's really swell.</br></br></br>  <br>I basically came to love him starting at pic related. It's cheesy that he just wants to be a normal boy and follow Gon around, and that Gon just happens to be the only person who could ever like him outside of his family, because they all, like you, think he's shit. Even Leorio never really got used to him. I find his obsession with Gon adorable even though it isn't healthy and he was a shit and went out of his way to make Gon not know he cared. I think deep down he's really a good person, he's painfully oblivious to how other people feel, and he can invent entire conflicts in his own head. I can't help but find his feeling rejected by Gon doing something that 'I had nothing to do with..' extremely cute.</br>  Why didn't he just tell Gon that Kite was fucked?  <br>he wanted to protect his smile, but he only managed to do it in the short term</br>  <br>He didn't want to rain on his parade, he was overcome by Gon's hopefulness.<br><br>That bitch with the bubble gum should have told him that Kaito probably wasn't coming back, at least as his old self.</br></br></br>  <br>I admire your will power. If I took half the posts I see here seriously I would have killed myself long ago.</br>  <br>Now I know you have been reading a lot of fanfic, or at least confuse Killua's thoughts for actual narration.<br><br>Killua has never once shown Gon that he cared, in every time that Gon has ever been affectionate with Killua, Killua has always rebuffed him, I think you're mistaking one of Killua's conversations with Palm or Ikalgo with ones that he's had with Gon. It's also a lie to say that others don't really get used to him, since its really Killua whose holding Leorio at arm's length, not the other way around. On top of that we do get to see Killua open up to others, as the CA arc shows us later on its not others that's the problem its Killua.<br><br>I don't know what's adorable about a obsession driven by selfishness, Killua notices what Gon is going through but doesn't care because he wants Gon to pay attention to him. His overreaction is what causes him to physically and emotionally abandon his friend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Selfishness.<br><br><br><br>Only Killua was there and could say that Kite was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still not interesting in arguing, but <br> Now I know you have been reading a lot of fanfic <br>That person is not the one you've been talking/said the original fanfic line to, I am. I was <br>I don't mean to disregard your post, apologies if it comes off that way. I just thought you'd like to know who you are replying to.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I feel for you, Killuafags, I admire those of you who don't shitpost.</br></br></br>  <br> Killua holding Gon's rod </br>  <br>correction- don't shitpost too much and argue, since everybody shitposts some<br><br><br>I am still conflicted about this. Killua sees how powerful Pitou is and that Kite is screwed so he knocks Gon out and runs away with him. He didn't directly see Kite die, but he saw Pitou's power. After that they see broken Kite.<br><br>He never directly saw Kite's head chopped off, right? So maybe there was a possibility, however small, that Kite is still alive but broken. At least that's how I got it. If he told Gon that he should let go, Gon would never accept it because he saw Kite "alive".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pika Pika  Can Chrollo beat Netero?  <br>Can pigs fly?</br>  <br>In the HxH world, probably.</br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br>He says "i let Kite to die" in the page just before. Killua is much more experienced about that sort of things than Gon. He knew Kite was dead.</br>  <br> I find his obsession with Gon adorable even though it isn't healthy and he was a shit and went out of his way to make Gon not know he cared <br> I can't help but find his feeling rejected by Gon doing something that 'I had nothing to do with..' extremely cute. <br>what the fuck is wrong with killuafags</br></br></br>  <br>Deluded beings who are driven by their cock.</br>  <br>This is a reallly interesting point of view to me. I don't frequent HxH threads on here often, and I'd always read the CA arc as Gon pushing away Killua, not Killua abandoning Gon. Huh.</br>  <br> I'd always read the CA arc as Gon pushing away Killua, not Killua abandoning Gon. <br>This is what happens when you take a character's thoughts for actual narration.<br>Same thing happened at the end of the arc, with people believing Ikalgo's thoughts were the moral of the story.</br></br></br>  <br>Gon's behavior in contrast to Killua's in the Election arc gives it more context. Gon learned from his mistakes and tries to make things right with Ging, Kite, and Killua. Killua blames Gon for his mistakes and guilt trips him for them.</br>  <br>But then I suppose you could say from Killua's POV it really was Gon who was pushing him away?<br><br>I wish there'd be some arc of HxH with more of Gon's thoughts, because I'd honestly like to get inside his head.<br><br>But you know.<br><br> hiatus x hiatus </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you apologize for fucking up THIS badly?</br>  <br>rekt</br>  What show do you hate the most?

I'm running out of dimensions here.</br>  <br>It's a logical conclusion. Why would she want Yukino to face her feelings and make her life more difficult when she could just confess (actually confess, not the roundabout retard confessional Yui does every few episodes) and be on her way.</br>  <br>What;s with this OP?<br>Well, here.<br>Velocity of Yukino will be given by root(2gh).<br>=&gt;root(2x10x40)<br>Whatever will stop her should produce enough force to absorb the momentum of Yukino and to positive work against gravity to take her to Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If 8man told Yukino to jump off a bridge, would she do it?</br>  <br>8MAN DIDN'T FLIRT WITH HER</br>  LN and animefag here, am I the only one who didn't get the last 15minutes of the episode?<br><br>Literally what were they talking about?</br></br>  <br>No, why do you think that?<br><br>Also,<br><br> Yui's look of disappointment <br><br>That's also what I've got from her expression. She never thought that Yukinon would fell this low.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well she knows she can't win from the start. Even before the 8bowl, she just know she can't won again the two (in the president election), that's partly the reason she went confess to Hayama even though her feeling wasn't for him. She purposely avoids her feeling for 8man because she think it won't bear fruit.<br>Remember why she always complaining 8man is the sly one instead? It's because she can't help falling for 8man actions.<br><br>You can see that Iroha is a complex character.  No who am I kidding here, her behavior is so typical for a highschool girl, nothing deep at all. <br><br>Sometime you know by your heart that something probably never works, but can't stop striving for it.<br><br> Like we Irohafags wishing her to win, we know it is futile, but just can't help it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forget "if they knows it would be very troublesome". So Iroha and 8man acknowledge that it would be bad if Yui and Yukino know about it, but still do it anyway.  NTR at its finest.  </br>  <br>Vaguely talking about winning 8manb owl, I think.

Nobody even speaks japanese anymore ffs.</br>  <br>!</br>  <br>Why would anyone think that Yukino will win?<br>Yui and 8man literally call Yukino out on her uselessness this week. I think Yukino herself finally realize how shitty herself is, that is why she decided to come clean and finally to decide request something from both of them.</br></br>  <br>Unless he's watching Horrible. I don't think they bothered translating the display board.</br>  <br>because best girl never wins</br>  Any prediction of what is it going to be?  <br>You didn't get the translation, or just not getting it?<br><br>Penguins choose a mate for life, stay with them forever, yada yada. In relation to Hikki's relationship with the two girls.</br></br></br>  <br>jesus christ how useless can crunchy be<br><br>that's one of the most important scenes in the first half of the ep</br></br></br>  Have memesubs gone too far?  <br>Those onions...</br>  <br>If they did that, then Irohafags wouldn't have anything to act smug and self-righteous about.</br>  <br>Horrible translated it.</br>  <br>she's there in the first place so she can get over her problems, you really think she isn't going to undergo development in the following volume(s)? are you delusional?</br>  <br>"fuck me raw dog 8man"</br>  <br>Mo watashi to kakawaranaide hoshii.</br>  <br>My fucking sides, damn 8man, that's some heavy shit there. <br>I hope that's true.</br></br>  Poor 8man  <br><br>Threesome.</br></br>  <br>I really wish Commie would go all the way and like cut out 10 minutes of an episode, insert random bestiality porn and then have it tagged blue on Nyaa because The Independent Quality Checkers™ objectively rule it as the best alternative.<br><br>And then people defending Commie. Would be hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>wow, so mad. www</br>  <br> Yukino being a cunt for no reason at all just to be a cunt <br>God I wish she would be killed off in some painful manner.</br></br>  Are dubs not special anymore?  <br>Everyone calling Yukino gonna win because:<br>1) They factor Main Heroine's plot armor<br>2) The damsel in distress set up<br>3) This whole major arc is specifically about her and her family<br>4) Whether or not Japanese ready for non-#1 heroine winning<br>5)  They never consider 8man's character nor Yui's major events throughout S2  <br>6)  They didn't read the LN </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is 8man observant and understanding enough to what Yui just pulled? Will he finally recognize her efforts and true feelings?</br></br>  <br> They delayed the subs for this </br>   Yui didnt confess because she wants them to stay like they are. <br> Yukino didnt confess because shes autistic <br><br>Is this right?</br></br></br>  <br>Best possible end</br>  <br>+1</br>  <br>Check 8man reactions to Yukino. It is pretty obvious that he has something for her.</br>  <br>That 3p date was actually looks fun. I was unable to hide my grin  though it was painful seeing Yui sinking her own ship one hole at a time ;_; </br>  <br> www <br>www what? That's not even a proper url you fucking idiot.</br></br>  <br>Daughteruzoned?</br>  <br> 6)   They didn't read the LN <br><br>Reaction like what, anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>wwwwwwwwwww</br>  <br> mfw watching the episode as a Yuifag </br>  <br>Are you implying that Hachiman blushing and getting flustered when Yukino does something is anime-only?</br>  <br>it's called banter mate, and you obviously can't take it, stick with your moeblob</br>  <br>(笑)</br>  <br>8man has feelings for both girls, it's been thoroughly established so take your antagonism elsewhere.<br><br><br>I know brother, but the real battle has only just begun, so keep the faith.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't that bad for me. We've known Yukino was going to win for awhile now, but with this episode we see that Yui is unquestionably the best girl. 8man just didn't choose her.</br>    <br> Are we getting another season?!?!?</br>  <br>No<br><br>8man was blushing and getting flustered wasn't exclusive to Yukino only.<br><br><br>Calm down, m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Whether or not Japanese ready for non-#1 heroine winning <br><br>I don't get this. Surely Yuifags, Irohafags, and others outnumber the amount of Hachiyuki shippers. Yui and even Iroha aren't lagging that far behind Yukino in terms of popularity.</br></br></br>  what is this feeling? why do I want yui to win?  <br>Yui with Iroha's strong personality would have won this bowl before the end of S1.<br><br>Even Iroha would have already won this bowl if she wasn't cynically waiting to see if there's still chance with Hayato before going full in on the second best choice.</br></br></br>  Fuck Yukino and Yui.<br><br> YUI'S MOM A BEST</br></br>  <br>She's been showing strength, courage, determination, warmth and care throughout S2. And having plenty of major events in which at least 3 of them are 1:1 adaptation.<br><br> FEEL is a Yuifag </br></br></br>  <br>Yui is the most popular. Just look at all the yahallo threads and the full size figs that Yui get.<br>That kono sugoi or whatever has a very sample size in comparison. Only like 400+ votes.<br><br>Even some random poll has a bigger sample size.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Even Iroha would have already won this bowl if she wasn't cynically waiting to see if there's still chance with Hayato before going full in on the second best choice. <br><br>Iroha is on the assumption (not that wrong though) that there's something between 8man and the two girls in the Service club. Even right now there is high chance that she would be rejected (or got blocked by double YY before she can do anything)</br></br></br>  <br> take your antagonism elsewhere </br>  Is it me or does it seem like Yukino is in love with 8man?  <br> ?!?!? <br/></br>  <br>For a moment there I was about to ask why the same character got two places.<br><br>Good thing they actually have different hair colours.</br></br></br>  Is this why subs took so long?  <br> She has been in love with Hayama </br>  <br>yes</br>   Says he doesn't play fair <br> Does nothing but play fair and encourage Yukino to stop being an autismical cunt and step up her game <br>Yui is a goddamn angel.<br><br>I never really rooted for any girl in this show and was just in for 8man antics, but now I guess I'll have to settle my horse in the Yuifag ranch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what happened in the last episode of the anime?<br><br>I don't understand shit<br>What was Yui wanted to do that 8man was not OK with it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>8-man strikes again</br>  <br> threesome. 8man is known for have poor stamina. </br>  MOVE THE FUCK OVER BLONDY<br>WE GOT OURSELVES A NEW EDGE MASTER</br>  <br>She is the chosen one<br>Yui-ham</br></br>  <br>Hayama x Yui OTP</br>  <br> &gt;Yui didnt confess because she wants them to stay like they are. <br>she confess when she gave the cookies to him, or was that not a metaphor?</br></br>  <br>"Just fuck my shit up"</br>  <br>Confirmed: Yukino -&gt; 8man -&gt; Hayama -&gt; Yui -&gt;  cookies man </br>  <br>Yui did what she did to have 8man push Yukino into solving her own problems by herself.</br>  <br>You sure she's that clever?</br>  <br>Hayama only loves Yukino-chan</br>  <br>For stuff that deals with emotions, yes.</br>  <br>Not the person you're responding to but it's pretty obvious she was pressuring Yukino to MAKE A FUCKING MOVE.<br><br>The day before with getting her to give cookies and then making a bullshit proposal that ALMOST went through.</br></br></br>  <br>She might not be the brightest academically, but as a true normalfag she is quick to pick up stuff when it comes to human relationships.</br>  Season 3 inbound right?  <br>I believe</br>  <br>thanks for sharing this, assured me on what I was thinking the whole thing was about...</br>    as much of a yukinofag i am, i am grateful for yui's existence  Pic so fucking related. Hyoudou-sama also wants something genuine.  <br>this is going to be like WA all over again!</br>  <br>Must feel bad to like a girl who literally does nothing but be an autist and suffer from muh princess syndrome.</br>  <br>Setsuna plays dirty.<br>Yui is literally handicapping herself by bringing Yukino along.</br></br>  <br>The less butthurt that Yukino will be the more likely Yui gets to keep Yukino as a friend if she wins the 8bowl.</br>  <br>Who said Yui = Setsuna?</br>  <br>OVA around 2019.</br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  What happened in this episode? I dont get it<br><br>Do they both like 8man but dont want to do anything because they like their friendship?</br></br>  What is this face trying to convey  <br>You'd have to be an incredibly dense person to not notice that.</br>  <br>It looks kinda creepy. It's a fucked-up smile, I think?</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>She pissed herself</br>  So this is the reason why we couldn't get subs yesterday?<br>Fuck you, Commie.</br>  <br>"want some dick?"</br>  I know we just had a thread yesterday or so but new PV is out:<br>https://<span>youtu.be/3jE9moHQePI  [ ]</br>  <br>And last I heard the author canned the WN officially to concentrate on LN (since it has already branched off wildly from the WN materials).<br>Though that also means author is free to use the WN introduced characters and such in different context, like the nobles of the Empire and so on.</br></br>  <br>already got outdone by Chaos Dragon</br>  Interesting premise, looks absolute crap.  <br>I am disappoint.

OP you are hero. Keep up good work.    <br> I've to say I was dissapointed that Ushio only used stone armor modidifed by scientists. I wanted some GATTAI between armors during last fight. </br>  <br><br>Nice to know. Hope you're enjoying it.<br><br><br>Thanks. Also, Hero is the name of the ed of the show. Just putting it out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yeah, honestly the armor didn't do shit. It's jsut a nice callback to the first enemy they fought.  </br></br>        <br> At least it didn't turn into enemies like Tora's armor/past wield users. It was also nice showing what would happen if Ushio managed to beat HnM while being drunk on rage and hate. HnM would just be reborn.<br>Somehow I get reminded of FFX from it, even though in spira it was repeated many times.</br> </br>  I am now worried how are they going to adapt all of these into 24 episodes.  <br> Net's shitting up again </br>  <br><br>39 eps supposedly. Let me look for my predictions</br></br>    <br> 39 episodes <br><br>Thank god.

I can't find it anywhere with English subs.</br></br>  <br> This post </br>  Just marathoned this show overnight<br><br>Pleasantly surprised with how little the MC had to use his power, was initially put off by the code geass power-bestowing. Concept of restoring a dead amusement park was surprisingly fun, and characters were quirky without being fucking annoying. Could've done without the school substitution episode and every scene with Latifah was pretty awful, but overall much better than I expected.</br></br>    <br><br>Why is politely expressing your gratitude disgusting?</br></br>  <br> every scene with Latifah was pretty awful </br>  <br>Fire.<br><br>Air is worst girl in the entire show</br></br></br>    <br> in existence <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br> Air <br> Not Heart </br></br>  <br>The show that .gif is from was also terrible and Hibiki is ruined by the war between Hetrofags and /u/.

Just like Punchline made me hate Mappa. Why'd Gainex have to split to make this these cancer a reality ?</br>  <br> Kyoani really lost their way. <br>implying</br></br>  <br>Because you have shit taste and clearly didn't watch any post 2000 Gainax anime with an open mind</br>    <br>Jesus, those child bearing hips.</br>  <br>I Did watch the garbage they put out and it seemed like a half assed attempt at riding on their gainex affliacted coattails. Kill la kill was Female Gurren Laggan and Punchline was a trying so hard to mix Fooly Cooly ridiculous with Gunbuster/Daibuster heaviness. <br><br>Until they realize they ain't gainex no more they're nothing but a bunch of loudmouths.</br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani really lost their way <br><br>Yes, After Gay Swimming.</br></br></br>    Fire Sento=Water Sento&gt;Air Sento&gt;Earth Sento  <br>Damn.<br>Best office lady in anime of ALL TIME.</br></br>  <br> not enjoying Tiramie being a playboy </br>  <br>But the school episode was the best one.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127227950 <br> no Gatcha subs <br> no Amagi subs <br> no Yahari subs <br>time to quit anime</br></br></br></br>  Name one good Amaburi doujin.<br>protip:  you can't </br>  <br>When can I insert my dick?</br>  <br>That one with the ecstasy heart sleeve fruit was good</br>  <br>The show was okay. <br><br>You've missed all the discussion about the plot and other things back few months ago when it was still airing. There's actually not much thing to discuss anymore until they finished the translation for 2nd vol. of the LN and so on.<br><br><br> Punchline was a trying so hard to mix Fooly Cooly ridiculous with Gunbuster/Daibuster heaviness.  <br>Just because some staff from Trigger also work in that show doesn't mean that the story is some kind of abomination created between those two shows from Gainax. The story and everything in PL actually accord well with the games that the creator has been doing for years.<br><br>Trigger is also not fully consisted from former Gainax members.<br><br>You're shitting up the thread with your pathetic taste and horrible opinion, please go away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> of ALL TIME <br>I really wish I had a picture of Kanie doing a mic drop right about now.</br></br>  <br>The Yahiro Pochi one.</br>  <br> was initially put off by the code geass power-bestowing. <br>That is a pretty forgettable element of the series.</br></br>  <br>I dont remember this...</br>  <br>that's because it wasn't on tv</br>  <br> not being able to hammer nails with your dick </br>  <br>did anyone found a movie from the real porn actress?</br>  <br>Eh?

They don't necessarily HAVE to be together, but when they are, it's a nice bonus.<br><br>Personally I prefer spats with ribbed sweaters or better yet, Ribbed sweaters with nothing but underwear or nude underneath.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit, Anon.</br>  <br> Mmmmmm </br>  <br>Ribbed sweater with pantyhose my man.  Imagine Muse in that. Or Sento. </br>  <br> secret fetishes <br>She clearly shows her desire to see men having buttsex.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, it was just as good as this fanservice shit.</br>  <br>Nah man.

What's the point if they are not inverted anymore? Fapping is suffering.</br>  I just want to plough Salama.<br><br>Is that too much to ask for, Nigel?</br></br>  <br>Dammit Latifa is too cute on this</br>  <br>yes <br><br>she's mine</br></br></br>   this OVA <br><br>Kyonai has gained redemption after the shitphonium blunder. Amagi S2 when?</br></br>  <br>She's pretty uninterested with lewd surrounding her daily. I think she's just a plain old fujo.</br>  <br>You just have a better taste than any other fairyfags, anon. Good for you.</br>  <br>to be fair salama and muse don't seem to show interest either</br>  Is Amagi the most sexualized KA show ever? I think its their only one where lewd took over cute, there is also sex jokes overload and a bunch of explicitly pervy characters  <br><br>Yeah, there's nothing worse than a good looking doujin with an inverted nipple tag only for them to last like 4-5 pages.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/824885/b41a36<wbr>0c6f/<br><br>Link related, they always, ALWAYS, do this infuriating shit</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, it's overlewded.</br></br>  <br>This fag doesn't even want to watch yaoi and get a handy from his waifujo</br>  <br>FUCK YOU KYOANI WHEN IT'S A SMALL GIRL YOU HAVE TO PAN QUICK AS FUCK AND DON'T GIVE US A SERVICE SHOT?<br>FUCK OFF.</br></br>  <br><br> overlewded <br><br>No such thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But they were explicitly like that in the first place. I actually enjoy the mascots acting like a bunch of old guys.<br>Made it kinda real but not really.</br></br>  <br>Stutter-chan isn't for lewd, Anon.</br>  So much Sento service.  <br>Fuck off and Kyoani too.<br>She is not for lewd, Latifa also is not for lewd, because they are shitty small girls right?<br>God damn it, did this OVA magnify all their moralfaggotry Jesus Christ. Even the camera angles always took care not to show her crotch or ass, this was beyond ridiculous.<br>Also gotta make sure not to show even a slightly lewd shot of Latifa! Fuck these faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry I was staring at her buttcheeks</br></br>  <br>No fucking buttcheeks of worth, we can hardly make out anything on contrary to the other girls in this segment who both got their service shots and details.<br>Holy fuck KyoAni confirmed for the hugest "can't sexualize small girls" studio all over again.</br></br>  <br>Latifa's plenty lewd.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>You're grouchy when she isn't sexualized and you're grouchy when she is. You're a hard person to please, Anon.</br>  <br> and you're grouchy when she is <br>But she wasn't ever, you funny kid. <br>Even in her micro bikini scene it was made sure she covers her crotch are and only get shown in awkward angles.</br></br></br>  <br>Does every store sell that poster or is that a pre order bonus?</br>  <br>the crotch isn't the sexy part, it's the vagina bones and they were visible</br>  <br><br>We hardly saw anything in her close up shot compared to all the lewd poses and details of the others. Really, they made sure to make her as tame as possible while still adapting that part, since fans were anticipating it.<br>However everything else was cut from her, along with her only bath scene, and this OVA is a proof of what KyoAni thinks of her.<br>Not even a cute butt shot. Nothing. But you can just compare Chuujou's wrestling outfit scenes to others in terms of details too.<br>This OVA made my blood boil more than anything in recent history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are one angry pedophile.</br>  <br>Yes, I am.</br>  <br><br>Cops called, fucko. Enjoy your jailtime</br></br>  <br>You seem upset. You should really cool down</br>    <br>hey doll</br>  <br>I can't.<br>I guess satisfied big girl fans won't ever understand. They are being served what they like on silver plate.</br></br>    <br>Are you a lolicon?</br>  <br>LRD please go</br>  <br> They are being served what they like on silver plate. <br>This is true.</br></br>  <br>Can't do that. I gave them the doubt of not being faggots after the third episode despite it not really giving the shots Latifa deserved.<br>But this OVA was too much. Too fucking much.</br></br>  <br>you got it</br>  <br> Only accomplishments are being adequate at singing and typing and not killing her friends <br> The only one whose talent didn't compensate for another's weakness <br> Doesn't say two words to Sylphy for the rest of the show after the second trial <br>What was going on in the writer's head for that episode?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>literally Miyuki</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>living proof that lolicons need to be exterminated</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you're ready</br>  <br>As a non-lolicon, you would be frustrated too, if you only got lolicon service everywhere, and even the few non lolis' scenes were denied from you in a series.</br>  <br><br>You don't get it, I'm not a lolicon but I understand his frustration. When all the girls get the spotlight expect the one you like, when she's left behind and all other people get to talk about the latest fanservice their favorite character gets. I feel sorry for that man, I really do.</br></br>  <br>Why would I be frustrated? If I want to see non-loli scenes, I could just watch a non-loli show.</br>  <br>Except that there wouldn't be non-loli shows. And the few ones where you think you would get some non-loli service would turn out to only give some from the lolis too, and nothing of the token non-loli.<br>That's the position I am in.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like you're just a whiny degenerate</br>  <br>There's a bigger picture of this, right?</br>  <br>You would be whiny too in this position.</br>  <br>Miyuki isn't a fujo and she's a siscon</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pkO<wbr>2_LdgSas</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br> ad hominem <br><br>When you will learn to argue?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course I am</br>  <br>When will you learn to not have shit taste. Because it's SO unfair that all shows don't appeal to your disgusting fetishes. Woe is you</br>  There's two girls holding onto Kanie arms here and neither is Sento. Is Water in the Kanie harem?  <br>Couldn't find it. Compromise?</br>  <br> that look on fires face <br><br>seems like it</br></br></br>    <br>She already got to hold his hand</br>  <br>She's wet for Kanye.</br>  <br>So lewd.</br>  <br> all shows <br>You mean "no shows". Also don't foget shows that could easily appeal to my "disgusting fetishes", but decide not to, on contrary to their advertising.</br></br>  <br>if you pay attention you'll notice that Muse always touches Kanie for some reason. I'd say yes</br>  Kyoani for the love of god please make a season 2.  <br>I could watch non-Prisma Illya or non-Kodomo no Jikan or any number of fringe non-loli anime I could learn about in the non-loli threads. I could even read some non-loli doujin or watch some non-loli hentai, if I was so inclined.</br>  <br> That trigger discipline <br><br>Based Kanye.</br></br></br>  <br>You should just jump off a cliff because the world is SO unfair to you.</br>  <br> or non-Kodomo no Jikan or any number of fringe non-loli anime <br>Oh wow, all the shows that aired 10 years ago? Don't be a retard.<br>Prisma Illya is the only one in recent history, and it's not like they have very high quality, unlike Amagi.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not him you fucking mongoloid. To this moment you have said nothing expect how much a degenerate he is. His fetish could be anything and yet you don't seems to grasp what he's angry about.<br><br>Keep on shitposting, that's all you can do.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Earth's probably in it, too.<br><br>I don't think Fire and Air are, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  When she's underwater does she get wet, or does the water get her instead?  <br>Who wouldn't want to casually touch him at every opportunity?</br>  <br>fire wanted to keep kanie "warm" when he got that summer cold</br>  <br>Earth yes<br>Fire is like Kanbaru, possible if you have Muse persuade her<br>Air could not give one solitary fuck about that stuff</br></br></br>  <br>It could be anything but it's most assuredly shit. And because it's shit, it's left it the gutter where it belongs. No sympathy for lolicons</br>  I only want s2  <br>Just so you know all girls in this show are illegal in many states, so how would you feel if they got removed because of it or something?<br>Either ways, your lack of empathy is evident.</br></br>  <br>Boneitis</br>  <br>all of the faires are in their 20s<br><br>so's av-chan and ashe<br><br>sento is the only  good  girl who isn't</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fire is only in it for news and seems indifferent about him.

KyoAni idol anime when?<br><br>Does KyoAni hate fucking money?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worth it or nah?</br>  Are there any hints of S2?<br><br>KyoAni better make an S2.</br></br>  Why are we still shitposting here?  I don't think the track at the end is included in the OST.<br><br>Season 2 confirmed.</br></br>        <br><br/></br>  <br> Does KyoAni hate fucking money? <br>Yes. See: Haruhi after S1 for proof.</br></br>  <br>Aren't they holding off on S3 because the author was being a jew and not making any more LNs because they felt they weren't getting enough monies?</br>  <br>The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato was made by another studio.</br>  <br>Is that a Nokia Lumia?<br>I didn't know Japan was into asian electronics.</br></br>  <br><br>It isn't included?<br><br>Well I dunno about that but all projects have a leeway which S2 is possible. It could be just unused resources that they decided to put to use.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Nokia <br> asian electronics <br>I guess you could say pretty much all electronic devices are Asian since they are manufactured there.</br></br></br>  <br>why is pink Mayoi such a slut?</br>  Have you praised the queen yet?  My anal queen.  <br>she's such a bitch and I love it</br>  ...w-where's arato?...  I loved Alice's voice in the anime.<br>I hope she appears in the ED.</br>  <br>Muh kokoro, I love that face she has in there.</br>  What's going on here? Is this how they're able to pass all the time?  <br>Haven't you see the ed? They know the power of love. They are in a whole different level!</br>  <br>  they have a secret homosexual relationship  </br>  <br> 100 chapters later <br> she becomes Souma's pet </br></br>  A few more and I'll have all these extras categorized. I lost track of what volume extras were fully completed and what weren't though, when I started doing these things they were posted out of order.  True Queen  I want to  cuddle  a Takumi.  I haven't read the manga except for the very late chapters.<br><br>Is the reason Souma's losing because he opted for a battle of texture when everyone and their mothers are making egg dishes (which will surprisingly all have the same texture more or less), making this a battle of tastes and flavor instead?</br></br>  Erina a shit.<br>Worse than Emi and Kirino.</br>  <br>This is from volume 6.</br>  <br>There's definitely nothing secret about this.</br>  <br>I also want to be spoiled as to what is going on with this egg stuff. Also what the fuck is with the new girls dish?</br>    <br>Mê-ghū</br>  <br>Thanks. Last one.</br>  <br>Souma lost because of introducing a dish that had less impact on both ends, the aroma was inferior to Hayama's dish and the flavor was subpar when compared with Kurokiba's dish.</br>  <br>This is from volume 7.</br>    <br>So that's why Erina looked so smug when he said he was doing a souffle. God damn it Souma.</br>  <br> Also what the fuck is with the new girls dish? </br>  <br>I can't tell if this is more or less lewd than other ones.</br>  <br>Me too, anon.</br>    <br>Queen of what? Getting shown up by her betters because her arrogance is offensive?</br>  Is Alice a Slut ?  <br>He's talking about the egg challenge faggot.</br>  <br>hes talking about the eggs lmao are you an autist</br>  <br> Insults Alice <br> With a picture of Ryou (aka Alice's husbando) <br>HERESY!!</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing lewd about pure love.</br>  <br>True enough.</br>  <br>Alright. I don't think I have any Volume 3 extras, are they not done or are there not any?</br>  <br>Casanova already translated volume 3 extras.</br>  <br>Souffle deflates after a while, it's not a good bouffet dish</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Oh, looks like they didn't translate the author and artist's comments.</br>  <br>Why did they only translate the Volume 3 extras? I contacted the translator and he said that they didn't do them so that people could support the official release so why the fuck did they even bother with Volume 3.</br>      <br>im not sure how i feel about her voice, its nice and all but i need to hear more.</br>  <br><br><br>Wait, really? I have them translated and the credit's page is from Casanova so I through they translated it. That's weird.</br></br></br>  <br>Also it's not only volume 3, volumes 1 and 2 were translated too.</br>  <br>They just got lazy I think. Everything up to Volume 3 is done by Casanova. So other than the special chapters everything else is all done?</br>  If only this series had delicious girls instead of all these disgusting chicks.  <br>Yes, we could translate everything except the two Isobe Isobee Monogatari specials and the recipe book omake, but I'm still looking for them.<br>Also there's these pics from Twitter I think I forgot to post.</br></br>  <br>Viz's volume 3, lacking dust jackets, just has a much smaller Doujima on the back cover. I feel cheated.</br>    Reminder Erina will fall for Soma after finding out he's the son of her admirer      I must be the only one who dislike this girl.<br>To me she is a bitch who can't be honest.<br>Oh wait that's almost every tsundere ever.<br>She also seem to be one of the stock characters that I always have disliked for some reason.<br>But in the end I know She and the main guy is going to get together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's all.</br>  <br>Higher resolution.</br>  <br>BEST SHOKUGEKI<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's opened up a bit more right after Souma's match with Hayama &amp; Kurokiba.</br>  <br>To add to your hate towards her, she only has like literally one fucking friend where Erina indirectly begged to play sevens with her, I would love to see her reaction if Erina's only friend leaves her</br>  <br>No Taste.</br>  <br>This is an Erina thread on /a/, of course you're the only in it who dislikes her. But frett not, the general opinion of her is that shes a massive, lying, unforgivable bitch who just so happens to be the main girl. Why do you think its doing so poorly in japan?</br>  <br>She is going to have two best friends now, Hisako and  Megumi </br>  Erina X Curry  <br>Curry already has a waifu.</br>  <br> Wrong Nakiri </br>  did someone post this yet?  <br>You mean a mom.<br>This chapter makes it clear that Jun sees him as a son and she loves that now he has friends his age.</br></br>  <br>Too old.</br>  <br>Jun a mom.<br><br>Yes. Why is it important? What is it? Where is it from?</br></br></br>  <br> Thinking any SnS girl is disgusting <br>Confirmed for homo.</br></br>   Ryou gets the best theme song. <br><br>Thank you Based JC Staff</br></br>  <br>I loved his theme song, OST when?</br>  <br> Why do you think its doing so poorly in japan? <br>Only the anime isn't doing well. But it sure did give the manga a boost in sales.</br></br>   cooking manga   <br>I suppose that's why you keep coming back to these threads to fap to them, eh faggot?</br>  <br> only guy who shows interest. <br> gets sonzoned. </br></br>  <br> Why do you think its doing so poorly in japan? <br>It's not. It's an anime adaptation of a WSJ manga. You usually don't consider the BD sales but the manga sales. And the anime boosted the manga sales.</br></br>  <br> Why do you think its doing so poorly in japan? <br>I don't know about the anime, but the manga has always been high in the rankings.</br></br>  <br> Only the anime isn't doing well. <br>oh yeah, thats true. But the mangas owes most of its success to its art imo</br></br>  <br>Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.</br>  <br> We will not get this in the Yugi match. </br>  <br>Alice and Erina are very obviously friends. The two of them just refuse to admit it.</br>  <br>I wish English manga had the dust jackets, lots of neat stuff under the Japanese ones</br>  Will Megumi be a yandere ?  <br>Probably the biggest disappointment of the anime so far for me. Till now pretty much every character's voice fit the voice I imagined in my head while reading the manga (especially Megumi who I prayed for everyday would not be voiced by KanaHana). Mai Nakahara voicing Alice would have been another perfect fit but Chinatsu's performance left something to be desired.</br>  <br>No.</br>   watch Shokugeki no Soma <br> likes it so much that I even try cooking stuff myself <br> I'm actually a better cook than I thought <br><br>Thanks Japan</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's Viz for you. I'd rather buy the original Japanese tanks than buy anything from Viz.</br>  <br>the ping pong battle with megumi was hilarious too</br>   Erinas Face when she finds out Soma is Joichiros Son     <br>She'll probably go hysterical and be self-denial.</br>  <br>Erina's face when Joichiro praises her food</br>  <br> implying he won't reward her by having her eat one of his experimental delicacies. </br>  <br>From a tsundere she'll turn into Soma's pet</br>  <br>Reminder that Souma will exploit her new love for him by making her admit his cooking is good, then ditch her for being such a huge cunt so that he can cook for  his waifu  Megumi  or his husbando Isshiki .</br>  <br> Inb4 she says to herself 'I must join my genitics to the son of my role-model' </br>  <br>the hotness, the mystery<br><br>she might be related to Soma, who knows</br></br></br>  <br>Jouichirou backstory never.</br>  Doesn't Erina kinda look like she'd be into anal?  <br>plus Alice looks ugly in the anime when in the manga she's even hotter than Erina<br>It's like they made her look gross on purpose to not distract us from Erina</br></br>  <br>They argue and their obsession with one-upping the other makes them cook above their expected level</br>  <br>she'd orgasm and then be mad about it</br>  <br>cooking manga are all about reaction panels though<br><br>well, except Nobunaga no Chef</br></br></br>  <br>megumi also have the same eye color</br>  <br>So how the fuck do they survive if they have separate classes? If they ended up with Shinomiya they're done for.</br>  Erina hate sex doujins when?  <br>But not the red hair gene.</br>  <br> the transformation takes 100 chapters </br>  <br><br>In 200+ chapters she'll be the one challenging him.</br></br>  <br> hate sex <br>/r/ gangrape instead</br></br>  <br>Take a good long look folks. This is Soma and Erina in their third year.</br>  <br>For what? an experimetal tentacle?</br>   YFW Erishit wins the Soma bowl   <br>Nobody knows. Maybe alone they're on the same level as Marui and the others, but if that's so, why did they not participate in the election?</br>  <br>Her key visual looks alright so it's just QUALITY unfortunately.</br>  <br>It would be cool if that was Soma's mom.<br>And that she died by eating poisoned food.</br></br>  SO will the anime be as long as the manga?  <br>wut</br>    Making a labor-intensive dish when he was told it was supposed to be buffet-style and he even had an idea of what that meant <br>Souma's lack of buffet experience really got him.</br>  <br>It's supposed to be 24 episodes but it'll probably have a S2.<br>Also it's an anime about a WSJ manga so probably yes.</br></br>  <br>They'll try, then they'll give up after they finish S2.</br>    10/10 cast.  <br>  Bottom left <br>QUALITYsmug? Or just a bad angle for the style?</br></br>  <br>for good measure</br>  <br>  Don still there <br>How.</br></br>  Why is Isshiki Satoshi the best Shokugeki?  <br>Are you referring to her chin?</br>  <br>He has a waifu now, of course he will be there.</br>  <br>Her eyes are missing something.</br>  <br>From Butcha-U's twitter probably</br>  <br> when in the manga she's even hotter than Erina <br>I'll have to disagree. They're both goddesses, but Erina wins by just a bit with her boingy bits and hair mandibles.</br></br>  <br>It's on his pixiv page, too.</br>  <br>that hippo</br>  <br>That looks more like Leonora with Alice's hair.</br>  You think we'll ever find out who Soma worked for in the last two weeks of stagiare?  <br>Cooperative and affectionate, with a little tsun here and there?</br>  <br>It's an emergency safety in case something needs to be hand-waved.</br>   you will never wake up to this sight. <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>  what's the consensus on Alice's VA?<br><br>doesn't feel right to me.</br></br>  <br>I like it</br>  <br>Yes, it's a bit awkward to me for now, but I'm sure I'll learn to like it, Chinatsu is a good VA.</br>  <br><br>I don't think Tetsunabe no Jan was about the reaction panels either. It was almost solely about the dish reveal and the explanations.</br></br>  <br>Expected a more sultry voice, instead it's higher than Erina's<br><br>But she's the younger one, so I guess it fits too</br></br></br>  this show is actually fucking outstanding, love everything about it. I might not be a fag and actually read the manga.  <br>Her voice was pretty sultry when she wasn't in SD mode.</br>  <br>Big disconnect with her character, thumbs down from me.</br>    <br>Read it already, you'll love it.</br>  Megumi is actually perfect so Erina can fuck right off. Lying bitch.  <br> streaming <br> .gif </br></br>  <br>Definitely worth a read for the art alone. If you're enjoying the anime, you'll really like the manga.</br>  <br>On another, slightly unrelated note. Those things Ryou had in his hand are called Baoding Balls and are used to improve manual dexterity. However Ryou was actually using them incorrectly since the balls aren't supposed to touch.</br>  <br>[insert crass comment here]</br>  <br>No. They're going to need filler episodes eventually as well, which I think will be tricky for them to do.</br>  <br>then I've been doing it wrong too.</br>  <br>It's pretty hard to get the motion down but it looks pretty cool once you actually get the hang of it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iyM<wbr>XsvBwHKQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The pitch seems off, but then again the only thing you can compare it to is the voice you heard in your head when reading her lines in the manga.<br><br>Given enough screen time I think I could get used to it, just like Risa Taneda's Erina, which by now I think is great.</br></br></br>  <br>Neat</br>  <br>Will it help me fap better?</br>  <br>This is amazing.</br>  They'll be such a cute couple.  <br>Alice in the manga had more sultry eyes, the one in the anime looks too plain</br>  <br>Well that certainly looks cooler than me when I play with my balls.</br>  <br>It doesn't feel right to have such a low class guy with 'royalty' like that though.</br>  <br>Love knows no barriers.</br>  <br>It's just that they didn't go with the white inner irises or whatever they're called, they went with the solid color eyes from her first appearance.</br>  <br>They went with something in between. Her inner irises are clearly lighter than the outer parts, but not super-light.</br>  <br>I just realized that ironically Erina is one of the reason Souma survives because of her advices that are meant to be an insult but instead saves his ass instead.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool actually</br>  <br>It's higher than I thought it would be, but I feel like after the next episode it's going to fit. For the best now that I think about it, her pouting/crying scenes will sound better for it.<br><br>The same thing happened with megumi's voice, I was not expecting her to be as folksy sounding as it was.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Did they add a shipper bait scene with these two or was it in the manga?<br><br>"He keeps popping up like this, it's not good for my heart", mega blushing</br></br></br></br>  I was just rewatching soma and megumi's shokugeki against shinomiya and I got to say, that soundtrack really made me way more hype then the manga ever could.<br>Also, that extended ending on ep 9, goddammit.<br>Say what you will about JC staff, but they are surely nailing hard this adaptation.<br>It is absolutely faithful thus far and are getting all the best things about the manga right (like the foodgasms) and even improving the visual aspects with the power of animation.<br>Any complaint right now would be nothing but nitpicking and I can only hope that they will keep it up for the second cour.<br>As someone who already loves the manga, the first cour gets my 10/10 adaptation</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not as mesmerizing as her manga eyes now, though</br>  <br>The "he keeps popping up" line wasn't in the manga. The blushing and everything else was there but they made it a bit more pronounced.</br>  <br>Yeah. I didn't remember their encounter at the hall during the announcement either but yeah, these scenes were there.</br>  <br><br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>The line was in the manga. And I don't think you need any more 'shipper bait' with the massive amount of foreshadowing they've gotten.<br><br><br>It's right there in the very picture you posted, weirdo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had a feeling she was pulling a Heston.</br>  <br> Ferret <br><br>The mangaka owns one? They're pretty adorable... when they're not trying to bite your hand when you least suspect it.</br></br></br>  <br> wasnt there in the manga <br> Is in the 2nd panel of the pic you attached <br><br>goodone</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ferrets smell, though.<br>They don't smell BAD, and you get used to it quickly enough, but you'll smell weird to everyone else as long as you own one.</br></br>  <br><br>Ah you're right. My bad.</br></br>  <br>Is it better or worse than wet dog?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, they can stink quite a bit so it's kinda off-putting when you first walk into a room. Of course, it's not anything compared to when they drop a stinkbomb. It doesn't smell organic and it's like something plastic caught fire.</br></br>  This was cool of them to put in on this historic day.  <br>OTP</br>  <br><br>But Erina is top 2 in the character poll.</br></br>  <br>Surely it was coincidence. R-Right?</br>  <br>That's part of the setup of course. Since Erina was raised to look down on pleb shit, it's a gap she has in her otherwise amazing knowledge. In a way Souma represents something that both Toutsuki and Erina are missing.<br><br>So we get stuff like Souma catching her by surprise at his transfer student exam with the furikake gohan, and also cooking takoyaki for her which she ends up eating up in the drama cd.</br></br></br>  <br>When's that being added to the collage?</br>  <br><br><br> Erina and Souma will have hardcore sex after their daily Shokugekis during their married life </br></br></br>  <br>Nah they will have softcore sex instead</br>  <br>I think the whole "Souma-kun" montage was heavy-handed, especially how he dominates her thoughts about Tootsuki. Even if you can't quite depict her middle school years there, the fact that the PSD crew take up a minority of those cherished memories just doesn't work for me.</br>  <br>These guys are most likely only good when teamed up. I bet they'll have a limelight chapter when there's some tag-team Shokugeki.</br>  <br><br>QUEEN OF EGGS BENEDICT, DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FRYING PANS AT YOUR DISPOSAL?</br></br>  <br> tfw Erina is a hidden hardcore masochist </br>  So what would you have made for the breakfast challenge?  <br>well it's not like i can cook anyway.

Not hating on her though, but not loving either</br>  <br><br>The author is not exactly subtle about what pairing he intends.

The spark here is that the wealthy person is bored or dissatisfied with the "best" of the world, but then caught off guard and enraptured by the "everyday" which is actually able to offer novelty and reprieve from their jadedness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>heres your reply</br>  <br>What is this? Some advertisement?  Looks adorable. </br>  <br><br>I don't hate her either, but I also don't like her. That's because I know when she appears in a frame that she is going to say something useless like:<br><br>1) Flashback to being given that stupid charm.<br>2) Nervous moments.<br>3) Remembering things Souma said and acting suddenly determined.<br>4) Scared/Emotional about whatever thing Souma is about to do.<br><br>So when I watch her its really boring. It would be fine if she appeared less often, but she appears all the time and hasn't really done anything beyond those 4 things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eggo waffles</br>  <br> ごきげんよう </br>  <br>They've never looked so on-model before this episode.

Its obvious you didn't read the mango, &amp; just depended on fucking summaries.<br>Also,<br> kek <br/></br></br></br>  <br> She's the one of the main heroines. <br>Corrected. Megumi is as much as the main as she is, if not more. In fact Erina was more of an antagonist at first and is just tolerates Souma. I'm not even a a Megumifag.</br></br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  <br>More like the main antagonist.<br><br><br>If the author wants more people to like Erina, then she should have her own tragedy that will physically and mentally change her to be a better character and not a pure bitch like she is right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both the heroines. If anyone cannot see it, they might as well kill themselves.</br>  <br> same opinions! <br> samefagging! <br>This is why I detest summer.<br>Do this board a favor &amp; kill yourself. <br><br> :^) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stay butthurt erishitfag</br>  I just want this arc to be done with so Best Girl Mitu can make the hometown cunt mad jelly.  <br>This is pure retardation.<br><br>Here's your reply</br></br></br>  <br> still no Megumi card in AA2 <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA, HISAKO AND NAO</br>  <br> AA2 <br>Nigga what?</br></br>  <br>you first faggot<br><br> :^) </br></br></br>  The episode didn't do her justice. Makes you wonder why they bothered posting her anime designs, when they're not faithfully following it.   erina hating which will soon be followed by megumi hating and waifushit wars only got this thread to move faster after hours of a slow drawl <br><br>gosh</br></br>  <br>where did this anime only faggots came from ? Fuck off to MAL or sumshit.<br><br>You are the cancer that ruins discussions on this threads. and also<br> Yuck <br>Kill yourself while reciting the national anthem for whatever shithole of a country you came from</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you expect? During this period, /a/'s filled with filthy summer crossboarders &amp; secondaries, so even a 'safe' series like SnS isn't spared. Just ignore &amp; report.</br>  <br> future mother-in-law <br><br>stepmother, you mean?<br><br> That's a decent premise for a manga </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh. I got  straight from the official site.</br>  <br> Using the correct romanization of Jouichirou &amp; Rindou <br> Uses Soma <br>Is this a new meme?</br></br></br>  <br>Lets wait until English release of the latest chapter is out, then the thread will become better (I hope).</br>  <br><br><br> primaryshits getting assmad their waifu is not liked <br><br>I've read the manga and Erina has not changed one bit. She has no value whatsoever and a boring bitch with tits who just gets angry all the time and has no compassion.<br><br>I will fucking laugh when by the end of SnS, she still is the same bitch since chapter 1 and all you Erinashits who are going "b-but she still has a backstory!" will realize you are dead wrong. Sadly, she will be rewarded for winning the Somabowl without any effort compared to people like Megumi or Alice who have showed compassion towards Soma.<br><br>That said, romance is not the main core of the manga and it's about the battle cooking aspect of it and Soma going to the top. I will be there when he curbstomps Erina and laugh my ass off for that double spread when she cries like the bitch that she is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing I'm harping about. So why are you asking a redundant question? I think there's no doubt Alice's design was inconsistent throughout the episode, &amp; rarely did she look like the one in said image.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>Sorry, misspelled Joe Ichiro and Rin Doe</br>  <br>You seriously need to fuck off.<br/></br>  <br> winning the Somabowl without any effort compared to people like Megumi or Alice who have showed compassion towards Soma. <br><br>for fuck sake faggot alice doesnt have feelings for souma she already love Kurokiba</br></br></br>  <br> can't provide a valid argument <br> resorts to shitposting </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Ok.

There's still a chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice doesn't even want to win the Soumabowl.<br><br>Romance is a core part of the manga. The thing about finding someone to love and to cook for has been there since the beginning, you faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> she already love Kurokiba <br>She doesn't. Stop spouting rubbish. She treats him like a dog.</br></br>   be Erinafag <br> too dumb to argue and post "Here's your reply!" <br><br><br>Here's you're reply!</br></br></br></br>  <br> NAO <br>That's a new one. I never see anyone say anything about her.</br></br>  <br>That's how ojousamas show their love.</br>  <br> Romance is a core part of the manga <br>Its not. Cooking is, &amp; will always be the forefront of this manga. Romance is like the appetizer, or dessert, but it'll never be the main course.</br></br>  <br> bub <br> &gt;&gt;reddit <br> &gt;&gt;MAL <br><br>you first manga or anime faggot?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice repeating digits.<br>Also, your grammar's atrocious.</br></br>  <br><br>Still waiting for that thoughtful reply to my above post, Erinashitter.</br></br>   be Erinafag <br> get mad at other people for calling Souma "Soma" because of autism </br>  <br>They're the same thing; doesn't matter where I sourced the image.</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?<br>Seriously, secondaries are misusing the greentext function.<br>You bunch of faggots need to fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>In one of the previous threads the conversation went<br> I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA! <br> Enjoy being castrated by Hisako <br> I WANT TO CUM INSIDE HISAKO! <br> Enjoy being boiled alive by Nao </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter who we're quoting.

Souma can always find another way to become the ultimate cook; he doesn't have to follow his father's footsteps. If you want romance &amp; harem, go &amp; read NiseShit.</br>  Holy shit this threads have gotten shitty.   erinafags are so fucking buttblasted the rest of the internet hates their shitty waifu they've converged into /a/ to shitpost <br><br>Sad thing, innit?</br></br>  <br>It'll be  Souma  that causes her to become like this permanently. Calling it.</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>Well she'd probably boil you alive and it would be an endless cycle. That or become a yandere cock slave.</br>  <br><br>Why do you shipperfags always assume Soma has any romantic interest whatsoever?<br><br>You're like Rindoufags who are already calling her best girl and saying she specializes in aphrodisiac cooking just because she looks "teasing" to Soma.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Only Hisako's medicinal cooking with 'cleansing' effects can make her turn out that way, no one else.</br>  <br> erinafags <br><br><br>my sides holy shit hahahah</br></br></br></br>  which kill would you la kill for?  the one with the red  Rags fan here.

Let's see how that would go.</br>    How fast would Satsuki kill me if I broke one of these? How is she going to know? I'm not sure why there isn't one for dating Satsuki but that would involve signing a contract with Ragyo and probably babysitting Nui. Is it strange that I think Disco MILF would try her hand eugenics if Satsuki had the life fiber parts like Ryuko? Just one woman's goal to find someone that is highly resistant to life fibers and have them get her daughter pregnant.  <br>I'm thinking like this. I can imagedump the rest of them if anyone wants them.</br>    <br>I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass and then feed my dick to Ryuuko</br>  <br>I can't post the rest because my computer is having issues.<br> Hey, Anon, could you possibly help me with my plan to create a master race by getting my daughter pregnant?  <br>That's how I see the whole situation. <br><br> I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass and then feed my dick to Ryuuko <br> MFW <br>That's lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Tampa <br> not Rags <br><br>Better dead than Red, I guess.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12723656   could I join?   <br><br>This can only be stopped in one fell swoop.<br><br> After everyone else of the original group dies off Ryuko goes insane and makes the Kiryuin clan Highlander each other to decide the dominant heir left standing, she kneels to let the last student become the master, proceeds to have severed head start manacle laughter ala Ragyo as it reattaches to disappear and haunt and strengthen the family for generations as she cant die due to the loss of life fiber blades. Centuries of the family line are considered cursed by the woman in red until she gets bored and one day shows up on the couch like its completely normal and proceeds to live an average life as a freeloader in the estate. Teaches the current head of the family lineage how to kill the life fiber core that landed as all reference of fibers were taken by Inu to the grave when his hard drives thermite bombed themselves as his heart stopped. Proceeds to guides this poor sole into becoming life fiber Batman. Then erases all memories of her existence from everyone else and waits for the need to rise again while the poor sole is thought to be insane with visions of the old family ghost. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> That's lewd. <br><br>You know what's the lewdest part?<br><br> Ryuuko would do it too. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the lewdest part is they are sisters</br>  <br>I can go for it. I'm just picturing Satsuki and the father just looking at this mess and wondering what went wrong.</br>  <br>Surprisingly this has something to do with that. Again, sorry for the mess. Next one won't be a mess.</br>  <br>Best girl would have me wore down in at least a minute and a half.</br>  <br><br>So they get gay at the end right?</br></br>  <br> So they get gay at the end right? <br>Nope. Platonic sisters.</br></br>  <br><br> Ryuko has possibly absorbed fibers from Junketsu, Senketsu, Koketsu, Nui, and possibly the fibers infused with Ragyo's will. This combination can only end well in the long run as her mind turns into a self contained hive if they take root. </br></br>  <br> &gt;Ryuko has possibly absorbed fibers from Junketsu, Senketsu, Koketsu, Nui, and possibly the fibers infused with Ragyo's will. This combination can only end well in the long run as her mind turns into a self contained hive if they take root. <br> MFW best girl goes even battier than when she wore Junketsu. <br>I think in that case Ryuko would probably need mercy killing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Incest makes it even better though</br></br>  <br>Satsuki is best girl but fuck Tampa.</br>  <br> Incest makes it even better though <br>How? That would probably cause memories of Ragyo's abuse to show up and Satsuki at least has a minefield of a psyche. That would be a rather messy explosion.</br></br>  Fuck blackkawks<br>Fuck Lightning</br>  <br> TFW she has the only means and ability to kill hybrids left. <br><br>At that point the only thing that probably could kill her is herself, unless someone realized the potential and made a contingency for it.</br></br></br>  anyone have the episode reactions/thread reactions?  <br>I'm with this anon</br>  <br><br>But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma.</br></br>  I'd rather stick my peter in some blue boipussi  <br> At that point the only thing that probably could kill her is herself, unless someone realized the potential and made a contingency for it. <br>Didn't Nudist Beach have some sort of bullet for something like this? Or go fishing for the scissor blades. I'm picturing Ryuko telling Satsuki to stop having kids before it got to the point it is now. At least around the tenth or fiftieth. <br><br> But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma. <br>At rationalize what their mother did to them. Chances that Satsuki would molest her own child do not look good in her favor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br> Tsumugu Kinagase has himself frozen in secret by Nudist beach splinter operatives that refuse to rest until all life fibers are destroyed. Everyone's face when this man becomes humanities savior after all the bumblefucking of nudist beach when she least expected him some few hundred years in the future with a single starch bullet to the Medulla oblongata. </br></br>  Find music fitting for the Kiryuin Highlander Massacre.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Iof<wbr>5pRAIZmw</wbr>  [ ]<br>Doesn't matter who or what it goes to.

So it's not surprising that they just ripoff whatever's popular and the result is generic schlock.<br><br>I hope you're not using Chaika as an example though, I thought it was a thoroughly competent fantasy story.</br></br></br>  <br>You fucking monster</br>  <br>I swear I just saw another thread like this.<br>And who cares about what you want, I like them.</br></br>  Is this the birth of an epic new meme?  <br> I hope you're not using Chaika as an example though <br><br>I'm using Chaika for Chaika's expression and Chaika a cutie.</br></br></br>  <br> What's wrong with all these writers of fantasy LNs and manga? <br>Western fantasy is all over Tolkien's dick. Eastern fantasy is all over a different dick.<br>What's the matter, don't like strange dicks?</br></br></br>  <br>Chaika is cute!<br>CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding me? Chaika is trash aside from the girls.</br>  <br>Get fucked. Chaika was a decently fleshed out fantasy setting with some history and consistent themes.<br><br>Most importantly, it didn't fucking drown the viewers/readers in exposition every two pages. Toru and Akari don't have long conversations about what saboteurs are to inform the viewer despite the fact that both characters would know what saboteurs are. Instead, we get the details when they become contextually relevant.<br><br>That has to be the biggest pitfall in LNs: worthless exposition dumps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaika had potential, but the author had no idea what he was doing with the world building. Or maybe the anime just did a poor job explaining it. Who knows.</br>  <br> Who knows. <br>People who read the manga might?<br>Why is it that anons keep insulting source material they have never touched?</br></br></br>   <br><br>Chaika is based on a LN. It's also shit aside from the cute girls.</br></br>  <br>Because it's an LN.<br><br><br>I disagree. The worldbuilding in Chaika was good, excellent by typical anime/manga/LN standards. I liked that it didn't explain things but kept the world as logically consistent as it could, and wasn't jacking off in my face all the time with fucking exposition dumps.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah man, I felt like the worldbuilding was great in the anime, atleast for the country itself. I dont know about the surrounding countries though.</br></br>  <br>It's a lot easier to use a standard RPG system that most of your NEET reader will understand without problems than to actually be creative.</br>  <br>Is this some new kind of bullying kids are into these days?</br>  On the flipside<br><br> setting the turns the RPG system on its back and makes the mechanics central to the story </br></br>  <br> flipside <br><br>more like the writer doesn't have any imagination</br></br></br>  <br> commenting on the author and his idea of world building <br> did not even touch the LN <br>secondary spotted</br></br></br>  I get it when both sides come in to play, but I don't get Danmachi.<br><br>Is it a game? What's with the game like levels and stats?</br></br>  <br> is it a game? <br>I think it is.

Otherwise, it's a fantasy world with rpg elements integrated into the actual world, instead of being floating boxes</br>  <br><br>I've been thinking of starting a "Write your own WN" thread because I actually got some inspiration in another thread a while back after writing a post with a typical reincarnation isekai beginning.<br><br>The thing is, though, that I loathe this place and I have no idea why I come here except for the freedom and anonymity to call you cunts cunts, so now I'm hesitant to actually take the snippets I wrote and put it somewhere else where it might be actually tracked back to me through my seven skellington armies. I don't want people to know I come here, even if it's just to feel disgusted at you all.

One more animoo themed thread won't look out of place.</br>  <br>They suck, that's what's wrong with them. There isn't a single good LN, they all inevitably fail to deliver as literature and as comics.

That's pretty shitty if you ask me. In true Gintama fashion they wouldn't give a shit about those Tendoshu faggots and keep doing what they do. I miss the fun.</br>  <br> People were actually thinking that the series is in its final arc </br>  <br>It's definitely ending, but once all the baddies are defeated and Shinpachi is given a choice to execute Gintoki or let his friends die and all that stuff we'll probably get a few meta comedy chapters.</br>  Episode 01 preview<br>http://www.symphogear-gx.com/next/<br><br>燃え尽きそうな空に歌は響き、 明日を輝かす種火となる。<br>拳も命も鎧い支えるは、 胸に揺れる小さな奇跡。<br>だが、逆巻く炎に涙する瞳は、 そうと知ってなお対峙する。<br><br>EPISODE 01 奇跡の殺戮者<br><br>鎮魂の夜を急ぐ血塗られた魔縁と、 かけてもつれた抒情詩。<br>耳をすませば遠からず、 世界を壊す――歌がある。</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   you will never do it for free with a passion <br> you will never suffer from serious paranoid delusions about crack shipping to the point that you try to block out anything that might cause cognitive dissonance <br> you will never write pokemon yuri fanfic <br> you will never stalk another person with serious mental health issues because they post Goodra spam <br> you will never post futa on /u/ unironically because you thought it was yuri <br> you will never fuck a hotpocket while thinking of MLP <br> you will never have an OkCupid account to look for a 3DPD whore <br> you will never be Troid. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if I reply to the same post twice they will think there are more of me!!!! </br>  <br>Sentence syntax conveys whether it's a question, not a question mark.<br><br>Also, if you want to nit pick structure why not call out  who is not using commas where he should.<br><br>Oh right.

I just want to know how much you laugh.</br></br>  Oh god, this was so fucking awful, holy shit. It was just like one of the old DBZ movies with a filler villain. Seriously, they didn't even need to make it Freezer, as they barely used his previous relationships with the other characters beyond "guy who wants revenge on Goku".<br><br>But wait, at least the old movies usually had some cool fights. Pretty much every fight scene in this one was uninspired and derivative. I lost count of how many times they did the old 'dash-in and punch to the gut' thing, and that's off the top of my head. It felt like every single fight choreography was just copypasted from scene of the tv series.</br></br>  BLUNDER OF THE CENTURY  <br>I guess it turns out jet fuel really can melt steel beams.</br>  <br>End of fight against Freezer was really terrible, it was made on pure purpose to mock Vegeta into oblivion, absolutely retarded dick move from scriprwriters/Toriyama or whoever is responsible for that bullshit. Overall movie was OK, quite enjoyable.</br>  <br>DBZ is trash?<br>welcome to 15 years ago</br></br>  <br>I'm actually a spic, don't found it offensive or something else, just like  said, I give a shit about it.</br>  l've never watched Fate/Stay night but I sure do enjoy this show  <br>And to think, primaries would have you believe you first needed to read the FSN VN and the Zero LN before bothering with Prisma.</br>  <br>Do not forget Hollow Ataraxia</br>  Me too. I wasn't really into Type-Moon but holy shit, Prisma Illya was SO damn good. Maybe I'm biased but as a parody, Prisma Illya is so much better than legit magical girl shows like Nanoha Vivid.</blockquote>]
