[ I finished Rebellion. ...So Madoka Thread. Reaction Images or general disscusion.   no   why can't Homura travel back in time to meet herself?  The only thing Homu did wrong was doubt the power of love and hope.     Homura did everything right.   Why must Homu sacrifice her happiness to make everyone happy? When will she get to be happy?   She gets to spend her life with her waifu. She is very much happy.    Helping thread reach image cap by posting best girl  Fluff   Best fluff of all     so when homu said she loved madoka what did she mean? is it a friendship love or a fug love?  Will sayaka continue to get rekt by hitummy in the next movie?    Legitimately happy Homu looks awkward.  Isn't it sad.       Forgot my gif    Happy homu is best homu. With the homu smile so rare it is second only to her legs.     I finished Rebellion  Haha, NO. Rebellion finished you.     I want to finish inside of homu    Oh it finished me alright.    The NTR is real   Hello autism general.   You tell me anon    Hey, how's it going?    Homufunposting general  Other magical girls welcome      QB will finish it inside of you.    She said others can't understand. So we don't understand.    I would became a magical girl for that wish   Tfw your phone is low on homu   Holy shit. Contain at least spoiler that hideous meme picture.   Perfection  Does anybody have any Kyouko?  If sayaka actually had balls would and did not get NTRd would it have motivated hitumtum to become a magical girl?  The queen of /a/   FUCK YOU   Join me, Anon-kun...   Bullshit, Homu only has eyes for the Doka.    How about Nay.    Best post kevin has ever made.    Good answer.   I am the pumpkin full of seeds   Full of my seed    what are you doing       tfw no homu to transplant rice seedlings together with     Teasing.    For once keven is being based.    Nah, she's for NTR. Hitum will NTR Nakazawa from sensei.      You got it wrong. It's Homuseed and they are now inside of you.    Teasing who?           <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127104978  Replyin' to the ghost post   why is salaka such a whore     Watch those your whore fingers anon    Every magica excels in a different area  Madoka is the cutest  mami is the most mature and graceful  kyoko is the coolest Homura is just the best and sayaka is the biggest slut         Sayaka needs white knights   She has kevin. The most autistic one of them all.    He's now a slave of Homu.   He betrayed Sayaka.        In that case kevin is now the smartest and best tripfriend of them all. Based kevin      You can go fluffier.    What is homu staring at?    To be honest, I also think Homura is better than Sayaka.     I really want to organize folder v3,     Something she doesn't have    President wouldn't lie    You know, the point of these threads isn't for people to spam things just to irritate someone.    Small tits&gt;cow tits tho i can see mami'd mamis appeal    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105781  Talk to me on archive.moe    I don't think Homu would care the quantity of the mass on someone's chest.  Kyouko Loves Sayaka. Sayaka Loves Kyouko.      Kyouko loves food. Sayaka loves me.    Prove it      Failed trips say otherwise.    Dressing like sayaka does not mean she loves you...  Still holy shit      Oh shit kevin kun is getting called out! Who will win ?    I think I meant Sayaka took off her meguca clothes in my room.    B-but sayaka is 2D and you are 3d.. those are defiantly 3d clothing. Dont you lie!    Uh, pic is me. I love Sayaka much more than Kevin-kun so I am the next generation.    Can't even keep up with Kevin-kun.             I heard a rumor that you're a Korean. Is it true?     No, that would mean I would hate Sayaka.            I don't get it but dat pantsu m8.      Koreans hate Japs and Sayaka was made by Japs!            hatin' a qt like Sayaka only for that reason is stupid tho.    Is there a better quality version? This one is so fuzzy.      I agree! It probably has to do with Japan raping their country.      __No               Have you ever kissed Sayaka?      That's lewd!    oh shut up, you panty poster.      No! It's a fine picture. Stop!    Just remember: Homura did nothing wrong.    You must answer in Yes or No.      Not until she's of age and real.    So no, huh? Too bad that Sayaka-chan's first will be mine.    Doesn't work that way, champ.      We'll see, cali boy.     Cali boy.      You don't like? Okay. Just post Sayaka. Better if lewd.    No lewd.    Come on or I'll call you a cali boy.    It's creepy.    That pic is waaaaay creepier tho. Good night btw.    Good-night, Anon-kun!       bumping from page 9 with shitposting   being a pathetic human being   being contradictory and obnoxious   being proud you get protected my My Little Pony fags with mental disorders   shitting on the characters              So are you guys going to discuss anything or are you just going to keep posting pictures?   salaka loves dicks    i think sayaka has the best dress but shes worst girl     more like worst girl   Five minutes from thread posted to trip posted. A complete travesty   Does anyone know where I can read Tart Magica?    'dat filename   'dat text in post      Anon is just too tsun to admit he loves Sayacuck   Homura is kill and it's all fuggin your faults!!  What?   Good.   Moe is exploding right now. Post cute instead.      Anyone have the rest of this?   Ok. Oh,  and ttyumbjb or whatever it's called was me. It's a fake account    There is literally not a more attractive woman in anime.   Every girl in one piece   WHAT THE FUCK IS THE NAME OF THAT HAIRSTYLE   Every girl in every other anime    But that's not a woman. It's a woman-shaped robotic vehicle for a genetically female human brain.    elvis?   wrong   Truly the softest.    Gross. I hate her design and she's a terrible character. Oddly enough I still really enjoy GiTS      That's a girl, not a woman.    Humans are human-shaped robotic vehicles for genetically human brains.           Bob cut    She's not even the most attractive purple haired woman in anime.   Where did everything go so wrong?    You didn't learn anything.   Manga major best major.   truth tbh    Oda's change in artstyle was good in terms of designs for things like ships, architecture, etc. but it made a lot of the characters look fucking retarded. I can't handle Chopper's current appearance, its rediciulous.    I personally prefer the movie version of the Major.    She's a great character but she's a shit waifu.   Guys what if Mahou Shoujo Major?   The only true waifu in GITS is the Tachikoma.     You will never have a maid waifu tachikoma to come home to.  Why even live?        eroge aren't anime     Truely, Atsuko Tanaka's voice enslaved my dick   What makes purple hair the most patrician anime hair colour?    Misato has black hair though. The only Eva characters with unnatural hair colours are Rei and Kaworu. Akagi dyes hers blonde.        Even in a medium full of ridiculously proportioned characters Misato manages to look weird. Her waist almost doesn't exist and her arms are way too long.  And have a better purple girl        Complains about proportions   Posts Geass      you could not have picked a worse anime to make that particular point    She was too good for this world, which is why they had to ruin her    My nig.    floofy  truth      Movie version Major is the most realistic one.  SAC version Major is somewhat idealized version but with the best personality.   While this is just pure shit.         No, this is floofy.     &gt;short hair     no, it's merely fluffy. To be floofy, it also needs to be poofy.    It's not a woman though.   Is it weird that I've never seen Bleach but have a collection of pics of three different Bleach girls on my drive?    Is it weird that I've never seen Bleach  Good taste.     It's totally not my thing, but damn, the girls are hot.    Geass Anatomy is bad, but Cornelia is best girl    Jackets are cool and it's shitty that there are so few jackets in anime these days.     pretty much  only good for fap material.   I read Bleach in high school but I didn't get that far before realizing the plot got too complex and stupid. It was alright when it was just to save Rukia and had SoL elements but I read on the internet after that it was the wars and shit and ichigo turning into a hollow who the fuck cares         Do you also believe that anime needs more toast?   Motoko was created to be perfect.  SAC Motoko looks tacky as fuck   longrunning shounenshit are only good for the girls. I only read the sadpanda versions these days.    Mah nigga     americhink slut   attractive  lmao lad    Revy is fine I'm just being a shitnigger           These ladies together are my favorite anime characters, but somehow I have a hard time fapping to them.     Because you don't want to take advantage of you're waifus.    Nah, I guess I just like them as characters but anime has so much variety it's obvious I've found characters I find hotter just in terms of pure looks.    [HorribleSubs] Kyoukai no Rinne - 12 [720p].mkv   All 20-25 followers, ARISE!     Do I need to watch Rinne no Lagrange before this?   I'm sleepy though.  So will this show turn into a romantic comedy from now on?   You're giving this show too much credit.  There are 5-6 followers at most.      no, idiot, the prequel is kyoukai no kanata   I liked the episode, it was nice and Rinne's father keeps on being a cunt.   It's Kara no Kyoukai, dumbo.   Oh SHIT  Wobble wobble   time for the AOTS   Did best girl appeared yet?   it's inuyasha bozo   Well there you go, she said it herself, Rinne confirmed slut.   She's much less sexy than I thought she would be. Cute though.  I wonder if this reference was a joke about misunderstandings.      She's pretty great.    This isn't what it looks like, I can explain. And then he explains.  Why is that so rare?     What a slut.   To be fair, it didn't even work anyway.    Because other heroines would have hit him way before he explained. Sakura is just unfazed by everything.     God DAMN you, Sabato!     Papa da yo~     In another world, Sabato is the main character of a corruption doujin series.     Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<wbr>re</wbr>     In the other world, he IS the corruption doujin.    that disgusting bastard   I think I'll just wait for FFF    50% upgrade  Ageha confirmed for wearing fujogoggles about Rinne.      there are people actually waiting for FFF out there right now     16 so far!     FFF confirmed for Damashigami front to put people on the Rinne no Wa before their time    Still the AOTS.   You die and are reborn into an anime (not as the MC but as a normal side character)  Which one would it be?    Tough choice there, OP.     Witch Craft Works. Purely becomes kemonomimi people are considered a normal, ordinary thing by people who don't know magic exists.    Any character in a nonshonen series.   Question. If I die again can I go to a different series?   There's nothing I want more than to be a Dog Days side character   No, we don't know if there's life after death after death.     MFW  I wanted to break the system.     Yuyushiki or Yuru Yuri. Something with almost no boys so I have a high chance of becoming the little girl.   index    Free!     We can't have a bunch of side characters killing themselves because they want to go to another series    Yuri yuri because I've never seen anything bad happen in the show    Who said I was going to kill myself?   Define "normal". Until then I'd pick Embryo. An immortal God.   Baccano  location doesn't change   chance at immortality   fedoras are still cool to wear in public       Pokemon   Probably Durarara. I'll join Dollars and become buddies with the van gang.   Asobi-ni-ikuyo   Magic and super science exist   qt alien catgirls have come to earth in peace   They're sharing their technology   Including a fucking space elevator   Seriously, even if I never even see a Catian in person, the stuff they're willing to share clearly means the whole world benefits.         Symphogear so I can buy Nana Mizuki albums.  Polnareff. Definitely.  on a quest to avenge his imouto   has an armored stand with a sword   /ss/   doesn't afraid of anything   is an idiot that never shuts up        Pokemon obviously.   That one anime with the drink cans that turn into animu girls  or that one where you had to fight for meals in a convenience store       berserk as a peaceful farming villager with wife and 3 kids   kids were ate in front of you and your wife turned into a breeding sow   by trolls   die of starvation in a deserted village        Pretty sure they meant no specific supporting characters either.   But still, Jojoworld has stands. And Tonio's food.     For Anime, either Hunter x Hunter or Soul Eater, since in both the probability of being able to be a bad ass even outside the story is pretty damn high.  I wanna say that for a manga I'd choose Hero Academia for the same reason.    Shinsekai Yori because having telekinesis and living in a utopia would be pretty awesome. Either that or GitS because cybernetics would also be pretty awesome even if it's just a basic cyberbrain modification that most civilians recieve.    once a cuck, always a cuck   ZnT world. That seems like fun.    But then those would be background characters.   GALAX seems like an app that would actually be useful.  I feel its worth noting that the OP only said pick an anime to be a background character in. He didn't say could could pick your background character.  Because then people would pick Akarin.       Polnareff   not the main character of part 3   implying Jotaro isn't just a side character there to mop up messes       A random rabbit in GochiUsa.    Hokuto no Ken   YKK    not choosing to be Miku so you can fuck Hibiki every night   Alternatively you could just be a random guy who NTRs Miku but that would require more effort.      Jojo, you don't need to be anywhere near the cast to get a stand.    Cromartie High School world  JoJo if i can eat Tonio's food, also, having a Stand would be useful as fuck.     D-Frag    wanting to be a cuck instead of a DRAGON    Kagami from Lucky Star.  Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo because I want to wig out with Bobobo, Don Patch, and Jelly Jiggler.   I'd like to end up in Yamada-kun, either I get to be a witch, or get kissed.   I would be fine with any of: Darker than black. Erryday monster grills. Sora no Woto YKK  and maybe Yuru Yuri since everybody is a gay little girl and even though the world itself is the same I'd still be living the dream since I'd be one too.         I'd try to score at least once though.  Poor Speedy never scored.     Spice and Wolf, I want to study magic and go on adventures.    Implying   I doubt anyone on 4chan has the mental stability to keep their powers from leaking and destroying the world around them.  At best you might be a queerat and live a primitive life underground.         yfw you end up in Saito's world.    Code Geass so i can be with mai waifu  Shirobako so I can marry Aoi.  Durarara!! It just seems so fun.    Obviously. Especially if it's an early season and I retain all my knowledge of the games. I'd look like a fucking wizard if I bagged a legendary bird before Ash shows up.   Danmachi, so I can grind    Demonbane  Try becoming a sorcerer and hopefully someday be powerful enough to make a contract with my own immortal book-loli.   GitS  I basically get to live in a possible future of our world. Also, I will be able to get an android-loli.       Hard choice between Index (30 years advanced tech + espers + magic) and Baccano! (just to follow Isaac and Miria).   Good choice, but i'll go with Railgun    patrician taste anon    Actually they even state they have come to breed with human males, so essentially every male will get a horny cat girl.     I just be a mook that goes with D-Frag cast shenanigans but will win the Funabori.     Prision school.  I ask where Hana's room is located.   Slip inside through the window to steal Kate's hard drive containing the porn.   Sneak into the student council office. I sit at the desk with a glass of scotch and a cigarette waiting for Mari and her gang to appear.  Tell her my plans as the ruler of the new council, with her sister being the president.  Place Mari and Kate together in a cell. Upgrade security to include bug recorders and signal jammers inside the prison.  Begin my pranking the boys.  Use the prisoners for entertainment such as bikini car wash.                 Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuutsu because the side characters are the main characters in that series.     both are in the same place/background so it wouldn't make a difference. Also good taste pretty much guaranteed cool ass powers just not much guaranteed power levels plus cute esp girls    posting on /a/   having the willpower or fighting spirit to be able to actually control the stands  You'll end up like Holly     DBZ   one of the world's strongest beings   should be fine unless I'm Krillin       Monster Musume, easily.  It'd be comparable to my daily life, only better, due to the fact that Monster Girls exist.     Man, I don't know anon. If Alessi or Boingo can get one...      This. I want to run a bakery with a Slurpuff and a Hydreigon for deliveries. Or a landscaping company with a Tyranitar for knocking down mountains and redirecting rivers.     HxH universe without hesitation   I don't think I could take that fist    I hope you like mafia, bitching wheelchairs and to be lonely. 'cos it will be only worse from now on.     Die and become a turtle    Anime: Pokemon. I can literally just run around and do nothing. Maybe even get paid to just watch pokemon.  Hentai: Ransem. I want to toilet brush that chick, except with my dick.     Ye   Outlaw star Should be pretty neat as long as I am not on the backwater planet at the start Might even get to see some Ctarl Ctarl fat cat tats    Initial D so I could live out one my dreams and become a Japanese toegay drifter, only to have them shattered by some kid in a Corolla.   Yeah, but how many times have random passerbys been used to demonstrate the enemy's strength/powers/cruelty. Or hell, just imagine what'd happen to you during Made in Heaven's reset    Yeah, but all of the powers rely on advanced mathematics. Do you want to do calculus or Trig every time you make a small ember with your Level 1 power?    Lucky Star   Its just fucking high school agian except I get to dick Konata     Depends purely on whether or not I can influence the plot. Rendering mikono in aquarion evol deceased would be quite a satisfaction.   K-ON.  If my plan succeeds there will be 5 members in the light music club, not 4.     Yugioh or Pokemon as long as I retain knowledge about the franchise If not, then any moeshit anime will do      This is... a pretty damn good answer, actually. You basically get to go to Hogwarts, learn magic and have fun. Bad stuff basically never really happens, and while there's danger and politics and drama, all of that stuff is taken care of by people way more important than you.   You just get to have fun at magic high school.        Knowledge probably won't be as good as you think it'll be. I mean, if your idea is that your knowledge of yugioh deck building will let you totally kick butt in a world where card games are serious business, I should remind you that all the important people in that world have special powers that mind control or instantly draw the card they need, or sometimes just outright ignore the rules.      Pokemon would be fucking to live in. It looks easy when you're playing it on a screen, but can you imagine being 10 years old and forced to wander around the wildnerness where wild animals that can spit fire or lightning will just randomly jump out at you every 5 steps you take?     But it's a kids show where nothing bad ever happens to anybody, though. It's got free healthcare, and nobody even complains about it.    The bro    Ya know   I choose Food Porn: The Anime   One Piece easy. Find a devil fruit and eat it. Enslave some east blue or 1st half grand line island. I don't need to find the One Piece it's easy to be a boss in that world.    Why would anyone choose a realistic real world-like setting?  Choose one that has a confirmed afterlife or at least reincarnation so after you die you're not gone forever like in real life.      Raildex-verse. Science side FTW     what if you already died and are currently living as a background character for a slice of life anime?    I choose the Saki-verse. It's a haven for gambling addicts. Also no boys allowed   not choosing the world where you can literally steal other people's powers by gouging out their eyes     not choosing autismland  I don't see the problem here, anon.    Atelier  probably just nisekoi or chu2koi or something. it'd still most likely be entertaining  How about this, /a/?  You get to chose any one fictional universe to be in, but instead of being just another powerless side character, you will be given a proper identity, with powers and skillsets rivaling of a main character in the series, which one would you chose instead? This means that those going to Raildex will be the next level 5, while those going to Jojo will receive a stand as strong as a MC or villain stand.  Which world would you go to?       Yugioh and only play Dragon Rulers because the only known banned card is Chaos Emperor Dragon.     Shinsekai Yori is an interesting one because if your just somebody random, your pretty much living a delusion established by people who are painfully aware of how badly things can get fucked up.  I also wouldn't want to get eaten by a cat or exploded.      post bestia    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dcf<wbr>7dQg0JVA</wbr>  [ ]  Ojiichan is bestia      REMOVE FEETFAG   nah   Is hestia a bestia?   is feet a man's romance?   https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   No spoiler summary on the OP? Disappointing.      Coma Cheese  I don't get the joke.    Now that's alpha.    "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                               Fresh thread! Fuck yeah /a/  Spoilers from volume 11:  Yukino gives 8man the chocolate.   Spoilers from volume 11:   Iroha won't be in volume 12 because Sensei is going to make sure she's not slacking off at the Service Club     Yukino? I thought Yui was the one giving them.  Better for Yukinofags like me     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                      Spoiler that shit next time, jesus.    Summary of the entire LN:  -Yui being a retarded whore who can't even say her true feelings and now is getting BTFO because she wants to live a lie -Yukino is a worthless bitch who can't fix her own mess and try to ask for help to everyone, first hayama, then Haruno and now 8man. Fucking dependant whore. -8man is an edgy faggot who try to find muh genuine even if he have that on his face but he's too retarded to make a single desition because he's just a coward. -Haruno take the antagonist role just because all those 3 faggots can't even realize they are living a lie. -Hayama a cunt -SENSEI IS THE ONLY TRUE ENDING BUT WATARI IS A CUCKLORD SO HE'S GOING TO PICK YUI OR YUKINO  Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?             Fuck off retard, stop posting false information      I'll make a summary   Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?      Friendly reminder  To those complaining about Spyro's translations having mistakes, many people here are happy enough to have his translations. Spyro is a damn blessed soul for them. An official translation means having to wait years until it reaches the point where we currently stand, and we don't want that. I will read it raw too because japanese isn't a problem to me, but that's not the case for others here so stop being a retarded fucktards and show some appreciation to Based Syro at least. He's doing this for free. Fucking plebs    Meta cuck   Marvelous.    I'm gonna miss you after this all over. See you in another thread in summer, I guess   No matter how much shitposting we make, you're all great, anons. Couldn't ask for a better, fucking twisted community. Fuck you all anons, fuck you all.    Blatant shitposter obviously trying to false-flag one of the smallest and weakest waifu factions.   Nigga go fuck yourse-   Doesn't bother including Iroha   kek'd. Carry on you gigantic faggot.           Implying he's not falseflagging falseflag     So he's not  genuine ?    Wait, would that mean he's actually a senseifag, or that he intended for his post to be called out as a false flag?   How much would you pay?     SOLD    maybe euro 70 ... but not anythng above 100. 90 is already asking for much, but willing to comply, im assuming I get full acces, yes?     I'll pay with my semen.   I don't know anything about this character or series. But I've seen several doujins about this girl and prostitution, and now this thread. Is she actally into escorting in the manga/anime? I thought it was a SoL about mahjong.  If she does, I'm picking it up.    Why does Nao Touyama always voice sluts   She's not. She's just the sluttiest girl of the franchise and she's not even trying.     $7/hr just like every other unskilled laborer    I'll do it for free.   60-80 bucks   Where did this slut meme come from again?    Doujins and fanworks.    Why isn't she wearing panties?   Is this a horse?  I want to kill this fucking cunt.    tfw you don't know if your ship has sunk for good or is looking great, because translators have different takes on that spoon scene.  Also, one more day until the BTB threads days are numbered.  Shitposting OP, stop it.               No, that's a shit and worst girl. Yuckyno A SHIT.    why the fuck do you post this in every thread?    Fuck you man     So, Yui is the hero the Service Club deserves.    Brothers?   Spyro finally started, yay!     1/3   All this proves is that Yui is a selfish cunt.    2/3     All this proves is that you are a complete idiot.     Now that's alpha.    Fuck of falseflagger    Yukino loves 8man   Yui loves 8man   Yui and Yukino are best friends   8man is romantically stunted  This sounds like a huge plot point going forward. This will impact their relationship a lot.       3/3     you will never have your own coma cheese       Try to hog too many things at once and they all fall off from your grasp.     Yui   character who's chronically unable to assert her own wants over those of the group   finally decides to stand up for herself   selfish cunt   We've been through this dance already with Yukino between the election and genuine speech, so how about you get          She is the hero they need.    Komachi is scary, too scary. Yui and Yukino look more concerned than taken aback.       Yeah, that fish is big   - If there would be no refuge, it wouldn't find its own place... Always hiding, going with the flow, sticking with something... And hitting an invisible wall   - Which fish?   - It's about myself   I like this bit a lot. Seems like Yukino is finally coming to terms with what she wants to do; she was a lost fish but now that she has Hachiman and Yui, it seems like she finally found a home of some sort and will stop going with the flow   Makes me think Yukino is going away for a period of time; if so, then it means that she is not going to follow anybody's footsteps.             MAX 300 coffee  I would drink the shit out of that DDR used to be my fucking game.       Yukino is going away for a period of time   Literally White album 2 Watari is a hack      No Iroha allowed below this line   -----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------</wbr>      So will Yui get cucked?    That's not nice.   Good Irohasu, everyone!  How do I stop this underclassman from being so sly?     kinda surprising she admitted it. I figured that was going to be a big source of conflict later on.       Responsibility  [ ] Take [ ] Leave      Not if Watari doesn't want his best friend to sue him for plagiarism.    Do you want a boring thread? Because that's how you get one.   Now that we know that Yukino/Yui are going to go for the 8 how would they respond to another girl going for him?     cockblock.   We dont care about losing/winning.  She has enough points. She will just NTR 8man, when he meet his kouhai again, after the time skip     You're not alone brother.    I wouldn't do anything that I'd have to take responsibility for. Not when I've got to hurry home to my gorgeous bun-headed ray of sunshine and cook dinner for her.    Best girl is best    What kind of life do you live that leads you to fantasize about living a normal life?   All girls other than Komachi are complete shit.   This is a well known fact within both the scientific and literary communities.   You cannot debate me on this. It is indisputable.       He's just come home after banged his kouhai    Irohabro shop owner says no.   Irohasu~   Thanks, brethren.    80% of pixiv is Yui     Is she softer than Yukino?  I want to use cocytus on Iroha   Spoilers for borderline blogshit  One where I wasted most of a decade of my life dicking around, so now what's most appealing to me is peace, stability, and the love of a kind and beautiful wife.     Fuck Iroha, Yukinon 4 life.  Why are Hiratsuka and Sensei the only ones that look like actual brides.   Probably more bouncy. Soft is hard to say.   Yui deserves to win and should, iroha is pretty fun, saki is great, Yumiko a best and yukino is a bitch. Have a nice thread guys   use that on your Onisama. Dont touch our goddess or she will NTR you     get home and cook dinner for her.   anon what is wrong with you, is it happy marrying a  vase ?       Hiratsuka and Sensei   You need to sleep, m8.     Alpha &amp; Beta    Made for titty-fucking     Iroha is the second biggest 8+Y shipper after Komachi though, no way she'd ruin all her hard work baiting one of them into finally taking the 8bowl.   Who would be a great trophy wife?   I wish she had heels on during the series instead of boots. Heels look a lot better on her anyways.     two right feet  Jesus Christ.     Give us your definition of "trophy wife" first.    Haruno. She certainly wouldn't be a good wife in any other respect.     yumiko has 2 left feet  Why, just why.    Irohasu!  8man should 8 both the girls against their will and see which one he likes better.   that's why Hayama won't fuck her    I'm gonna miss you captain. IROHA OR DEATH    What sort of position is 8?     I never noticed that, wow. Artist fuck up I guess      You have eccentric taste.      can't fucking unsee  Th-thanks anons.          I want the Irohafags to leave, you got your romantic moment translated already so please leave us alone to discuss the drama.   They wear a strap-on and fuck him in the ass.    In Japan? Yumiko. She's blonde. And very, very cute.    Sticking his 8 in them, typically via behing or missionary.    Eccentric how?    I fucking love cooking, Alton Brown is one of my idols. Yui's meme-flaw is a flat out win for me, since I don't mind the extra work and I'd get to play teacher in her efforts to not be a failure in the kitchen.    I'm trying to imagine a blonde Japanese woman being sexier than simple black hair. I just can't see it.  The only reason Yumiko looks cute with blonde hair is because she looks white.     At this point I'm okay with anyone but the spoiled rich brat bitch winning.   And the kind of girl who will be nothing outside of highschool. Her days are numbered, soon she'll just be some random pretty girl.     what the hell does a vase have to do with marrying Yui?     You underestimate how far in life being pretty will get you   間接キス!     I can't help it, she's on my mind.    Go watch Japanes Propaganda : The anime You'd like it.  Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken       At least you've clearly got your priorities straight.     I don't know actually; it's more of a vague feeling.  Yui &gt; Orimoto &gt; Miura &gt; * &gt; Yukino = Iroha = Haruno here.      Yui wont suffer r-right?   Nice quads, male sibling.   1/8  EITHER GIRL EXCEPT IROHA OR DEATH  Who do you think schlicks to 8man? Yui and sensei only?   Not remotely, memeposter sir.    I just fantasized about sitting in a room reading a book while Yukino does the same thing.   This makes no sense. There's literally no interaction, why is it so appealing?      2/8    saki    If you switched orimoto and iroha id be a pretty big fan of your taste, other than yumiko not being best    IROHA    3/8     quiet   peaceful   no awkward silence (at least if you're 8man)   reading is awesome   she probably smells nice        Where are the fake spoilers?   remember cake belongs in the top of the food group.    4/8    That's my nigga       don't need this heartboner right now man.      SAY YES      tfw when you'll never get to teach Yui MD and TD     At least we have a genuine understanding.         Heh, I didn't realise it. Great.  Thanks for telling me. Have a Saki.      There are couples who read books together you know. Whatever works best.    good    5/8    AH FUCK HIS PHONE WILL BE CONFISCATED  CONTRABAND  WEEKEND PASSES REVOKED         meme-flaw     6/8     Self-insert doujin  That's why Yuifag not GENUINE     7/8     Anon's right though.   KONICHIWA I'M BUSTY OPPAI-CHAN ALL FRIENDLY AND SWEET, B-BUT I CAN'T COOK!  It's a common form in Bengali cartoons.        Wait, how is Valentine's Day not over? Isn't every volume supposed to be a month apart?  The thought of Iroha somehow getting 8man alone and giving him some kind of Valentine gift is pretty exciting.      8/8    You've read my mind.     8man carrying iroha's bags even in yui's doujins   it's over my negroes      That's just an assumption, we don't know when the volume ended. V-day is probably over, though.     Goddamn meme trash. Typical of Vietnamese mobile paintings.    as expected of non-yuifags not understanding genuine.    Here, fixed for you  Iroha= Haruno &gt;Orimoto&gt;Yui&gt;Miura&gt;Yukino      More translated fanart here!    http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B       WHO IN THE FUCK KEEPS THEIR HAIR IN A BUN WHILE WASHING IT    Retarded people, that's who.     (  Gahamama - that's what 8man call yui's mom in Vol11      meme as an adjective  I wonder, when did you fucks get this fucking stupid?   Why the does it always seem like only Yui shit gets TL'd?         Jesus, I don't know where to begin with you.     switch Miura and Yui and I'll take it     only Yui shit gets TL'd  Yui shit as in only her bad doujins or as in only Yui's doujins?      because she's the best girl    What's going to happen in the next episode?   I feel so sorry for Sakifriends. It's never going to happen, even though it wouldn't be bad if it did     ALL GLORY TO YUMIKO    Highschool teen DRAMA R A M A         Truck     this desperate to pretend Iroha's ship isn't sunk     You got that backwards.    An interesting stance    We will never falter, never give up. If the boat has to sink, I'll be guiding it to the depths of sea myself.     openly flirting with 8man over an indirect kiss   sinking  You what.      Why is Yui such a slut? Look at that cock hungry expression.    I reiterate my previous statement.    Except it's mostly Iroha that gets the translations and typesets done. You really need to lurk more.      yukino over yumiko  get a load of this faglord     I meant things containing Yui tend to get TL'd more then other girls' stuff.   Yeah, her too. They both have 42 images on       Hold up for a second, guys. At what point does Iroha pull out the spoon? Pic related implies that it's in his mouth for the entire conversation (as Iroha touching her lips is before his 2nd answer).   mfw saika comeback from thailand   1/12    implying Yui didn't just sink herself at the end of the volume     They're about even, really.  And Yukino's practically out of the running, since she doesn't seem to have nearly as much fan comic stuff on pixiv.      2/12    But some of those Yui ones are old, like S1 old. Iroha has been getting most of the shit done recently.     every thread  Are people ban-evading, or not getting banned at all?    3/12    Not entirely sure she did but she did try to make Yukino and hachiman speak their minds (I think that was her intent when she was all "If I win I want things to stay the same"  I think she knew what would happen if she said that but she did it to help the other two open up.      The latter.    4/12    mods are surprisingly lenient, i only got warned for saying "JUST CUCK MY SHIT UP" in an annoying manner and haven't shitposted outside of a yahari thread since    5/12   Is Yukino going to win yes or no ?   this is very important.     No mention of that in the translations that we got. But it does seem like he still had the spoon in his mouth just before dropping the flirt bomb on her.     SLUT    Body, face, and personality of a Goddess.    6/12    Yahari threads are most cancerous. What're you expect?    She better, or I'm gonna have to burn a couch.    Probably not. We're going straight into the loner / friendship ending.    She isn't even in love with Hikki. If she was she would have let him kiss her.    No, Watari thinks Japan is ready for a story where second girl wins.   Better polish your couch-burning shoes then.         Wrong pic.    Very likely but anything could happen.    8/12     flat   blind   kuudere   goddess   You need to seek mental help, now.         9/12    i want to see our goddess in Bikini    Closer, but you were still a little off the mark.    All this Yumiko love  You guys are great     kuudere being bad  when has /a/ had better taste?      Watari thinks Japan is ready for a story where second girl wins.  Truly a man ahead of our times     10/12    Since Yuckynon debut      In other words, a hack.        11/12    No matter what Iroha does I feel nothing. Its just too easy to see through how much shes just putting on an act. Any picture I can't just think "hey she's cute" I gotta think, "look at the little she devil planning her shit. Who you putting that cute face on to trick?" 8man may fall for her routine but I won't. I'm not buying that shit.     being this much of an irohafag      first girl doesn't have a romantic development   she wins anyway   author is not a hack   Please, anon.           not writing another cookie cutter LN romance   hack  pick one      We dont know for sure yet. We do know that hayama might like her considering he gave her a trophy during one of his soccer matches in the latest volume.   Will they ever call Hikio by his real name?  Is it true that Iroha raped 8man in vol 11?    "What have I done to deserve this treatment?"     Yes, he was forced to taste Iroha's iroha.  And he liked it      Still doesn't change the fact that Watari or whatever this hack's name is, is in fact, still a hack.    Forced drama   Genuine   Standard romance   Bad fan base  seems pretty standard+            Hold off below for tomorrow   You're asking the impossible, Gahama-san.     Yui is the same as Hayama and friends. She likes being with Yukino and 8man, and fears losing this.    I would pay 15 percent of my paycheck for the rest of my life if they made an anime re-make of Good Eats, that show is so comfy.      not pinching her fat  0/10 shit tier doujinshi     Now that's alpha.    that's some chink joke. Basically it mean you marry some girl just to show off (and having sex while at it).    Here's another, suffer more!    Too bad, you're getting a remake of Good Burger. How does this make you feel?    that would probably elicit a squack from her and would ruin the mood    Seems like something 8man would do.     quick someone draw a pick of Iroha pinning 8man to the floor with his shirt open, chocolate smothered on his chest and her shoving a spoon into his mouth while she licks her chocolate covered fingers saying "Take it all you whore"      Stuff like that is literally what couples who have been together for more than 2 years do.   you run out of shit to say to each other and just enjoy each other's company most of the time, going out on dates when you can but for the most part it's just getting off work and chilling out together on your laptops       Soon (I hope).    implying it wouldn't get her fired up    Ep 13 anime tomorow?   Yes, shitfest incoming and maybe just one more week of BTB threads. Then it's all over.     and  fuck      all over  Nope, LN threads     LN threads don't usually invoke the cancer that this does. And depending on how fast Spyro translates it, threads will be very slow.     Okay so he'd still be a hack, but at least he'd earth some points for originality   So Hayama will win right? him and 8 will run away together and have hatesex   If he wants points for originality, it's best to have the dark horse win. In this case, Iroha.   Are you ready for the movie announcement after ep 13?    as long as it's at least two seasons, I'd be disappointed but optimistic     227 / 82 / 58   I smell a serious case of samefagging.    Get shot, fujoshit    holy shit how are they so gay    I'd settle for a cameo character in Shokugeki   Still pretty happy. Especially if they got kenan and kel to come back for it      Why didn't they look away? Why were their eyes quivering? Why did he focus on her lips? Why did she lean in? Why is did she touch his knee when he is injured?       She's still too distant from the main narrative, it would be too much of an ass pull   Yui is the only girl that deserves to win   The main narrative doesn't have romance in it, it's just the trio trying to figure themselves out and causing drama and suffering in the process. Iroha's side narrative has been nothing but romance, for the better or for the worse.      originality     No, its still probably Yukino's victory in the end. Yui and genuine 3some ending are also possible.   Any other ending wont be possible given the story given how the volume ends      Blushkinon is cute.    she's too dumb for her own good, she doesn't deserve the 8    Meant to say    Any other ending wont be possible in the story given how Vol 11 ends       Shes obviously not that dumb if she got into the school theyre at. Where do people get the idea that shes stupid?    this thread    She's not dumb. She's bad with words.     post imgur folder typeset anon.     By the fact that she constantly demonstrates by being stupid in the LN. I'm not gonna go out and list them all because it would literally be copy-pasting half of the entirety of yui interactions that exist    list the instances where she did something smart or above average intelligence.    she plays up being simple. doesn't mean she's actually retarded. she's not in 8man's or Yukino's league intellectually but that's not to say she lacks potential. She wasted her youth being friends with shallow idiots unlike 8man or Yukino, so she was out having fun instead of being a loner and living vicariously through literature. Makes a big difference.    She outright says she's not very smart in the latest episode preview.    Did Yukinon fall in love with Hikki while I wasn't paying attention?    Romance has always been a thing between the main three, it just got pushed back in the priority list when Watari shifted gears from spice of life to PLOT.  You're also forgetting that the "romance" with Iroha is all one sided right now. 8man doesn't care about her nearly as much as he cares for Yukino and Yui.     Heyyahari bros, I just wanted to get you guys in with the stuff I've been doing for the series that makes things a lot easier and clearer to understand. I suggest going watching the first S1 and take extra attention to the dialogues while you are watching till the end of the first season. Then go and watch S2, but instead go and watch they last episode in reverse to the season opener and watch the rest of s2 backwards. Doing the will make you understand exactly what's going on a whole level.   I did like the way I did it in my discretion but it makes a *million times more sense, if you're a huge fan of the show and LN's.     Have you even seen the latest spoilers? 8man openly flirted back at Iroha.     sup' brother  have some housewife saki        watch s2 backwards  what?     http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B  Here you go.      Nope it's just the usual Oregairu overhype.  Wowit'snothing.jpg        saki section   good lord, thanks        Yeh watch backwards, instead of 1-12 in or you start with S2e12 and go backwards to you hit ep1 of S2. Pretty is to follow it just every in the show make show much sense     Yes I have and that's s very liberal interpretation of what happened. It also doesn't remotely compare to him baring his soul to the other girls in the last chapter.    She fell for him sometime after they made up.   8man should have pinned down Yukino against her will and do genuine things to her.    can you convince everyone first by explaining your findings by watching it backwards      against her will      liberal   Do you like me putting my saliva in your mouth? Do you think it's sweet?   Yes.   Okay, anon.   baring his soul   implying Iroha isn't searching for genuine with her senpai and made him take responsibility for it.   Open end with VN is my guess anyway.            あざとかわいい is nice and all, but the LN spoilers have made me realize that what I really, really want to see is some あざとえろい.  Please start getting aggressive by the time this is over, Iroha.        implying she wasn't referring to the "jam a spoon in his mouth" appeal  And where did it actually say she had used the same spoon?  Seriously, the Irohafag mental gymnastics are getting so crazy I'm starting to wonder if it's not all one big, well-orchestrated troll.       is that your Genuine?     where did it actually say she used the same spoon  When she tasted it, retard. That's what she was doing, tasting it.  Don't get mad that the two autists in the club don't know how to be romantic.       Oh yeah, 8 did used this "amai" word on others', right? Like when he commented on Miura's advace on Hayama and on Iroha's appeal strike on Hayama.    But that woud take alot of it away fom the experiences    That word can be used as literally sweet, but it also means something to the effect of naive, like you're too pure in your thinking to get your way.    So it's something you just have to see for yourself huh?    We don't care. Tell us.      355 名前：この名無しがすごい！[] 投稿日：2015/06/22(月) 21:15:21.65 ID:/qypC8sW [12/12] いろはすは、アニメでスプーン八幡に突っ込んだけど、 実はその直前自分でそのスプーン使ってたw なぜカットするかね  Try lurking more faggot, and I don't where they mentioned it, maybe in the actual fucking novel?

Fans service for Irohafag: Iroha actually used the spoon to taste the chocolate before giving it to 8man.   Why don't you try looking into how not to be a retard before posting? It might make you look somewhat less like an idiot chewing on the foot in his mouth.                            The text of the spoiler mentioned no such thing. But nice try.     we'll  kill yourself     Well I genuinely want to see Iroha and 8man start getting frisky.     • Yui's mom show up in this volume  Cool  • Threesome date near Nishi-Kasai station.  Hopefully cute.       If what we've seen so far serve as an indicator, they're getting there. But 8man is 8man and he needs a lot of time. Thankfully he already stepped over the line on that whole spoon incident.     why are you so dumb? Have you tested your IQ? Do you have any trouble with your life? Need any help?     なぜカットするかね  Damn 2ch you're so slow.  FEEL cut the juiciest parts of the scene out so that it wouldn't spoil the LN.        Y so mad Anon?     Here's praying that they plan on releasing the full scene on the BD release. Because that sudden tamanawa appearance and 8man teleporting to yukino's side is just terrible pacing and makes it look like something was cut.       And 10.5 date OVA. Just the date     Cool  I'm guessing FEEL is going to cut her out sadly, considering they also cut out 8mom and 8dad.    Yui you're drunk, go back home.    I appreciate Watari and his skill with Japanese wordplay, but still, fuck Japanese wordplay.   Even those faggots on 2chan have trouble understanding that scene.             No I just feel sorry for you. Inability to detect obvious sarcasm is a sign of social retardation. I'm seriously thinking that maybe you really need help.    iroha ship will sink on volume 11     Inability to detect obvious sarcasm   Oh god the irony      I can pretend I understand moon too.   Posting lewds.   iroha will get BTFO once volume 11 gets translated   mfw     I don't think it was clever wordplay there. Incidentally, he does do a bit of clever wordplay in episode 6 with Isshiki. Isshiki says he seems like he has high awareness (Ishiki-takai), 8man tells her not to lump him in with them (her). Or at least I think that's what he was going for, Irohasu had an awkward reaction to it.         "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                                  Anybody got the other screencaps of the denialfag? His comments are comedy gold whenever another volume hits.   In the LN for that scene he was talking about self-aware people and all that, a reference to his personality. His comment about it confused her since she doesn't really get his loner attitude at times.   Like that time he made the "we shouldn't meet at the gate" joke, it just went over her head and gave off a different impression than he intended.  I don't think he was implying anything about their relationship personally.             I mean go see S2 in reverse ordered nu wa starting with the last epidoes realized and then go to previois ep*s tel the begniing   Preview when?   He's been progressing really quickly with Iroha, so it might be sooner than we think. That said it's questionable whether Watari would even give us the gratification when the story will still revolve around the club even if 8man and Iroha hook up.   I wouldn't be too surprised, this is FEEL we're talking about. There was a big difference in the lewd scenes from the TV version to the BD of YnS, and this season is a pretty exceptional case.  Only way I can really see the BD not having the full version is if something about the production process makes post-release audio/voice editing something that never happens.          volume 11   Yui's volume   Not entirely wrong, but still that comment does elicit a chuckle out of me.      What happen when Vol.11 completely translated?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106711  your fault for being so beta. if you have to ask her, you've already failed before you've begun.    Better insight into the last two episodes of S2, then the long wait for volume 12   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106711  Fucking retard   At what points did the girls start falling for 8man?   I'm pretty sure we will be getting the side stories included with the blu-rays translated from Spyro in the mean time. So the wait shouldn't be as bad as previous volumes.   Still fucking terrible though, I don't understand why I still put myself through this torture.      I wonder why 8man crying after seeing Yui smile and she said she knew what 8man going to said ?    Yui sometime before the school festival, Yukino sometime before "genuine", Iroha after being rejected by Hayama.    Forgot about those. Can't wait to find out what Watari is going to do in them    Thinkin about Genuine.    How long till the blu-rays anyway?  I want dat OST       Yui  Became interested in who he was as a person after the car accident, but didn't actually fall for him until after she joined the club.   Yukino  Implied to be around the genuine scene, though it might have started earlier than that since she displayed minor jealously during events like the culture festival.   Iroha  Was falling for him throughout her request, but had a love epiphany after over-hearing his genuine speech.        How does 8man unlock Nice boat end?   If I recall correctly, the first one actually comes out on the 24th of June. Though I could be wrong.    Did he felt what Yui doing is genuine?    I'd argue she was falling for him before that. Iroha confessed to Hayama because she realized she wanted something "genuine" from 8man's speech, a speech which she empathized with because she stopped wearing her mask around 8man.  Therefore one can argue that the reason Iroha confessed to Hayama in the first place (which both 8man and she acknowledged as being really out-of-character for her) is because she was already falling for 8man.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106884  hey i wasn't about to go insane for the sake of maintaining my non-existent training.  Med quarters does things to people. Even prison isn't that isolating.      I was there too mate on day 3 of eating cherry pie i was bored out of my mind did you get rtd?       Stay mad Irohafag. Your ship is dead. Iroha never liked 8man anyways.   Holy, my sides.      Nah, it's just a whore.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106969   Psychology  Yeah that should have been a pretty major sign anon, I'm not quite sure how you missed that.   Sounds like you actually lucked out on that one.    Therefore one can argue that the reason Iroha confessed to Hayama in the first place (which both 8man and she acknowledged as being really out-of-character for her) is because she was already falling for 8man.   I did a pretty large post detailing this interpretation a while back. You could probably find it in the archives.   But the gist was that Iroha confessed to Hayama because she was having doubts about whether her feelings for him were real. Leading to her confession, and something about her behavior during the confession or throughout the day, gave Hayama the impression that Iroha liked 8man.   I would elaborate more, but I don't really feel beating a dead horse again.               I will be completely fucking mad if this doesn't have at least a side story where Komachi meets Iroha.   yeah, after 3 more months of rehab and AIT im finally back home at fort couch.     Yukino  Seems like she always felt some attraction to him. She started very slowly around the school festival but it didn't become anything of note until genuine. The problem with Yukino is she is falling too fast. I don't know what happens in volume 11 but I think she will love him less.  Yui  Interested from the start and developed a crush after some time in the club. Started falling hard around volume 5 and into 6. She was still falling as of volume 10 but now it seems that she is trying to suppress it. I don't know how much she still loves him as of volume 11 but it is probably less than before.   Iroha  Genuine was the real catalyst, the train scene sealed the deal. I don't pay much attention to Iroha so I can't give a good opinion on her.         If we sink,we rather sink bitter sweetly.    Probably, he felt that his genuine about to be lost. And it enforced that both YY are people whom 8man held dear and deeply cared about.   How do we go from this:  “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.” She quickly ran her mouth after flinging out both her hands as if to take some distance.    “…Ahh, yeah, sure. Nevermind, just forget it.”   To THIS         I'm still waiting for 8man to do his own variation of her rejections towards her.   That and the Komachi/Iroha meetup are the two things I'm praying for the most from Watari.       Yui  Around the festival, that is when she started to really love him.   Yukino  Doesn't like him romantically, only as a friend.    Iroha  Loves Hayama-senpai but think of 8man as a friend.           Its time to stop posting.     Doesn't like him romantically, only as a friend.    Loves Hayama-senpai but think of 8man as a friend.   Just because you're not writing something mindnumbingly retarded, doesn't mean we won't be able to tell it's you denialfag.  Stay mad pro Yuix8man Denialfag         Hello denialfag, how's that pepper on your ass going? I imagine it must burn like hell.       He's even trying to start shit in the Saekano thread, he's really hit a new low.     Periodic reminder that Hayate was fed chocolates made with 8man and Iroha's mixed saliva.   This is my opinion too. Iroha is a nice girl and I love the friendship they are fostering but the evidence she has feelings for 8man is weak. We know that Yui is the only one who loves him.   Yukino does like him out of some sort of twisted dependency but doesn't actually love him.     Any spoiler for the BD bundle short story?   I thought some anons already got hands on it.     It's the full version of the Iroha end Watari posted on twitter.     samefagging  Sasuga denialfag, "owning" the thread as always.     That's some next level cucking .     At least it is only Hikigaya's saliva this time    Are you sure that isn't a copycat? He is quite successful of a troll.       You don't need to samefag. It's already bad enough you're responding to Irohafag retardation with more retardation.    would we call that a meta-cuck?   Episode preview when?   What a magnificent cuck. I love this show.    He only responded to a post saying that Yuifags were going to be the next Nekofags; so I'm pretty sure it's him.   Though it could just be a well informed troll, though I kind of doubt it.   Shame Ebina didn't know about it.         24 hours    Okay    No, I won't. I like posting.   I may be pro YuixHikki but I am not "denialfag" Stop using buzz words, they are not arguments.   Not him.  I am not upset, this volume seems to be going well for the characters. There is nothing to make me mad.    That wasn't me, not everyone who has the same opinions are the same person. There are 79 unique IPs in this thread and if even 10% agree with me that is still about 8 people.                 Iroha's a smart girl. It's probably a voodoo ritual to transfer some of 8man's chemistry with her over to Hayato.    “God, I’m not going to make it!”   “It’s okay, you still have time! Just keep going! Don’t give up!”   I casually looked over and a caste of girls sitting at different seats, either the second or third group from the top, was knitting some kind of muffler or sweater. It’s almost like I was listening to a conversation between a light novelist and his editor. Look, normally, you’re not going to make it. It’s almost Valentine’s Day and your progress is only at about ten percent. Rather than putting effort into making it on time for the deadline, it’d be more productive and realistic to try to extend it instead!   This sounds awfully familiar to me      Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                       buzz words  Sasuga denialfag, too poor to afford a mirror for himself as always.   There are 79 unique IPs in this thread and if even 10% agree with me that is still about 8 people.   Trying this hard to deny the fact that he wasn't samefagging   Top tier comedy as always.             At least this time it wasn't milk chocolate     I dont get it Who is the knitting girl Who resembles the conversation between a ln author and editor  I have no idea        I found Iroha's behavior to be quite queer in episode 12.   She likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.  I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. If the spoilers are true that she forced an indirect kiss on him then that is even more evidence.        You can stop with this pasta now.    Stop with this pasta    She's been making passes at him for a while but this is arguably the first time he's intentionally reciprocated.  Slip-ups like him bringing up her birthday or answering her example-appeal seriously don't count.     Yahari threads: 30% meme spouting 10% actual discussion 60% shitposting       Iroha is, again, away from the heavy drama and is the romance of the volume.  The goddess delivers yet again.      Slip-ups like him bringing up her birthday or answering her example-appeal seriously don't count.  He did dig his own grave when he did that, though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106711   blogging about 3DPD on /a/  Normalfags please go back to /r9k/, /soc/, reddit, facebook or whereever the fuck you came from.      He did dig his own grave when he did that, though.  How so?   Are you implying I use buzz words? I don't, I don't meme at all. Neither does "denialfag"  That wasn't me, that was someone who agreed with me. The mods know I am right.   That is a load of horseshit being fed to you by pro Irohax8man morons. There is far more evidence that she likes Hayama than 8man.    It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for.  She was being kind to the first taster, 8man. I am sure she changed a few things for the real deal. She was literally fighting Miura again over Hayam's affection, why can't you faggots see that?     She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.  Yukino and Iroha were only surprised he ever had that sort of relationship with any girl. That did not indicate that they were bothered by it.   If the spoilers are true that she forced an indirect kiss on him then that is even more evidence.  They are wrong as far as I can tell.                       meta-blogging about blogging  well played.      Sensei  Ramen date   Let me believe ;___;        first one or second one?    Without taking into account x.5 volumes  2011: March - July - November    2012: March - July - November   2013: March - November   2014: April - November   2015: June  He's running out of ideas and can't make then on time for the deadline          Keep it up, denialfag. Have some Iroha 間接キス     If not that, then the bridge for sure    Why would Iroha willingly put her saliva in something and then give it to 8man?   Why would she then mix their saliva and give it to Hayama?      To rub their genuine in Hayama's cuck face.   Iroha x Hayama OTP.   women do fucked up things when they feel slighted. it beats falsely accusing him of giving her the bad touch.    Then, can we expect a new vol (12) by November?    The only truth about this series.    100% waifu wars.  It never used to be this way.      Fuck that.  IroZai 4ever     After seeing the yui solo ed, yui definitely deserves to win, but won't.   He was, but really the turning point is when he himself decides to pursue a relationship with Iroha.  At this point I'm pretty sure he wouldn't refuse even if she tried to kiss him, but I feel like him actually starting to take the initiative is something that will be necessary development.      If everything goes smoothly, we can expect vol 12 by November/December.  If he runs out of ideas, be prepared for a vol 11.5 by November where he spends half the volume ranting about not being able to meet the deadline, editor-kun being a dick and/or not wanting to work. The latter is most likely to happen.       Rejects her because she's below standards.   OTP.      The one where he saw her at a wedding and they went alone, she wanted another one after he graduated.    Well it sounds like you've got a sold foundation for how things should go, so you might want to get started on that fanfic.  It is the only way it'll happen after all.      I don't exactly agree with everything you said, but I do wonder how he would act if she tried to kiss him after this volume.    denialfag pls go    That was when he should have made a move.    vol 10.5 fagt    Depends on how she goes about it really.  If it's by surprise it'd probably the same as if anyone else tried it: He freezes up from shock and so is unable to defend his purity, and after recovering will devote most of his energy toward trying not to seem flustered.      Not him, I'm not stupid enough to think Iroha feels nothing for 8man.  I'm just not stupid enough to think she has a shot in hell either.      barely canon. side novels aren't real evidence    Good god.    You are stupid enough to shitpost your opinion as fact though.   Can I get a summary of the spoilers so far? I've been asleep for way too long.  How come it's not in the OP? OP is a massive fucklord.     In a nutshell  Iroha gives 8man an indirect kiss and he tells her he likes it   Yukino family drama   Yui basically does what 8man did in volume 9 and tries to get the club to be genuine   Yukino request cliffhanger         If anything, my only fault has been wasting my time arguing with something as delusional as an Irohafag    Are you also the yuifag with the proxy that messes up the polls? I wouldn't be surprised if you were.      barely canon. side novels aren't real evidence  Watari has to release at least 3 volumes per year but he's being lazy and can't meet the deadline. That's why he releases 0.5, shorter volumes with half their contents about deadlines and whatnot     I'd say your main fault is not contributing a single worthwhile post to the thread.     Barely canon   Iroha was introduced in vol 7.5 and this event was mentioned in vol 8      What happens once his contract is up anyway? He has to make a new one or he won't be published anymore?     I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.   &gt;"Even so, my answer is the same."   the words she was waiting for.   He didn't think what he said.        Just because she was waiting for them doesn't mean he didn't mean them though.    Are you saying he's a shallow cunt and not genuine?    It depends on the terms of their contract. But most likely the 12 volumes contract is an exclusivity clause and after that, he's free to change publisher unless they agree on a contract extension    He wants to just be nice to her.   SOMEBODY    omg gaiz, indirect kissu!   for the 200th time   worthwhile posting       ONCE TOLD ME     streaming   commie      It's because didn't realize that he has the genuine thing Iroha wants. He thought Hayama had it     barely canon  yeah, you decided that huh?  not real evidence  denial is not genuine fgt       On-topic speculation, treated as speculation.     Yui basically does what 8man did in volume 9 and tries to get the club to be genuine  Fucking what? Could you elaborate?     Because he doesn't care about her, he wants to be genuine with Yui and Yukino.    Amazing.    That doesn't make sense. 8man doesn't try to be genuine just because people expect him to. In fact it's the opposite.   Where are the Yukinofags right now? Why are we being only ones that have to put up with the denialfag?   ITT: Irohafags distraught that nobody will believe them about the magic pink elephants parading down the street.  IROHOE HAS NO FEELINGS FOR 8MAN R O H O E ❤ H A Y A M A              If Iroha likes 8man so much when will she drop the she likes Hayama act?   After surprise kissing 8man    She certainly can't think she's being genuine with it.     When the other two is gone.    Does that new yahari vita game have iroha in it?  I know she won't win here, but at least..       Nobody is going to win, that's why they release a Vita VN   This fucking season.  I want iroha to at least one final date with 8man where admits he would have acknowledged her feelings if yukino didn't exist.  That's all i ask. Then Yukino can take her plot and trophy all the way home with 8man.     Well we could all see the yukino family stuff hitting the fan after she asked him to save her in pandaland, not to mention 2 visits by her Mom     Yukino  After cultural festival started to attract with him and falls for him before genuine  Yui   from the start since he saved her dog, that cookieman is 8man, so it is likely she also joins the club at first because she has crush on him and wants to know more about him  Iroha  I don't really understand her character         And don't forget 8man's monologue   I did not mind her presence at all   Basically, like she said, If Yukinoshita didn't exist, I might fall for her slyness        Nice one!    There. I would be fine with that.   I hate losing ships when they're mishandled. If you are not going to let them win, handle their rejection well instead of just pushing it aside or rushing it.   If watari at least gives iroha an ending she deserves, may we all find ourselves in dayvy jones locker with smiles on our faces.       Irohafags are sleeping now, perfect chance to break through their dreams and show them that a spoon might fit somewhere else too.  The reason Oregairu is such a hit is because it isn't a straight-up harem comedy, but made much more realistic and believable (relativly ofc).   From  Iroha has no feelings for 8man, she loves Hayama   Iroha has feelings for 8man, but also loves Hayama   Iroha has feelings for 8man, but 8man has no feelings for Iroha   Iroha has feelings for 8man, but 8man imoutozoned her   Iroha has feelings for 8man, and 8man might reciprocate, but he will end up with Yukino because of the first girl win trope   This change in less than 2 months           Basically like Sensei's 'if I'm ten years older' monologue.   As former Senseifags I rested in peace when I read that     Finished my work today to literally run to the nearest Animate store and, finally, this damn thing is right here in my hands  Gotta finish reading this before the last episode starts I guess. Welp, see you later guus     I'm still awake fag.    volume spoilers are out   iroha and 8man are at it again, but this time 8man stepped over the line too   all these anti-Iroha posts   It's volume 10,5 all over again, but with more hatred.       At least we both have it better than sakifags.   I'm disappointed that they cut so much of her.   Do we know how much episode 12 adapted from volume 11?         No problem. You still can experience it awake.     Any new spoilers /a/?  The perfect ending is with Yukino, it would be 8man biggest character development and can solve his problem before he joins the club   I wonder how the LN thread will go once those iroha pages are translated by Spyro. I also wonder how he'll translate their flirtation, whether he'll mess with it or not, because let's admit it, we're all biased even when we don't want to be.     Here   Just flipped through the pages and I found the last scene on page 224 so there you go       Basically, like she said, If Yukinoshita didn't exist, I might fall for her slyness  nice fanfic, where can I read the rest?    Genuine     we're all biased even when we don't want to be.  HA yeah right  IROHA OR DEATH       I like old Yukino better    Spyro's translation is full of mistakes. How can I tell? Welp, I read it raw so I don't know about his work, but last month there was this one occasion where I managed to find a critical mistake in it by just reading a part referenced by an /a/non on Yahari thread. That helps me guess about the overall quality and a number of potential mistakes yet to be found  Seriously, Yahari deserves official translation. I've seen quite many NLs published in English, and just don't understand why Yahari isn't one of them      Bullshit, cuntkiller guy is an Irohafag. Put him on the other side, with Iroha's army.     Give proof or you're lying.    Your point being?     there's no continuation. It's the end of their relationship     Yenpress in 4 years, it will take them 8 years and they will drop it at 7.     The end of their affair?     Orimotofag here, and in terms of beauty rank I would say: Harubitch -&gt; Yuki -&gt; Yumiko -&gt; Yui -&gt; Iroha -&gt; Ebin -&gt; Sagami = Orimoto's friend -&gt; Orimoto = Komacheese  Before you raise pitchfork, this is strictly beauty in vanity sense, Komachi makes it up with undefeated childlike charm.       It was fucking last month and I don't record all the threads like an autistic retard. Go search the archive with keywords related to the last part of volume 10 and especially Haruno's lines    you're lying  And what the hell do you try to say with this? Don't tell me you seriously believe Sypro is some sort of the perfectest translation of our age who make no single mistake for its worshipers        That was him falling for Yui actually     Did you contact Spyro about the mistake, or did you just sit there thinking about how you're hot shit?   Of course the answer is probably c) neither: you're a lying faggot trying to shit-stir and piss off Spyro       series with (at least nominally) realistic settings are much harder to translate than sci-fi/fantasy. You're more likely to get a series with either complex wordplay or tons of real-world cultural references in a series that can't rely on esoteric elements like magic or videogame tropes (Danmachi, SAO). These take more effort, hence time, to translate, and in the past LNs in general haven't been worth the investment to localize. That's changing pretty rapidly over the last year, but American publishers are still wary of series that don't have some kind of obvious otaku appeal to them. That's why we've got Danmachi but will be waiting a long time to ever see work done on Oregairu.     Don't mention that!     all this engrish   So the thread is asian now huh?     Well anon, many people here are happy enough to have his translations. Spyro is a damn blessed soul for them. An official translation means having to wait years until it reaches the point where we currently stand, and we don't want that. I will read it raw too because japanese isn't a problem to me, but that's not the case for others here so stop being a retarded fucktard and show some appreciation to Based Syro at least. He's doing this for free. Fucking pleb   Can we have the next OP with the summary of what we know so far, please?     full of mistakes   points only one   Retarded.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127102585  dead  not dead  Yup, he's moot.         Spyro's translation is full of mistakes. How can I tell? Welp   Fuck you!       Seriously, Yahari deserves official translation.  You say that but I'll cry if we get CR tier translation in the wazoo because someone can be arsed to get all the nuances and context right.      Just in case.     Honestly I approve of this for once.  Better an early thread with relevant information than shitpost-tier blather.         edition  Oh, come on anon.     You really can't fault him for that when our OPs are usually so much worse than other major threads.   Damn, all fags are sleeping or what? Let's cheer up this a bit.  Iroha fags, you can all go fuck yourselves.     fuck you too anon   iroha or death       Be fair, not all of them. A few good ones come out of the woodwork every now and then.  Just the ones who shit up half a thread wanking about "flirting" and an indirect kiss that never happened can go fuck themselves.      Honestly, I think that too but I only said it to restart the fun shitposting    Please don't reply to shit takers like that, if you said you did it, you did it, don't feel the need to respond to crap     "flirting" and an indirect kiss that never happened  Hide your denial powerlevel. It has literally been posted on the thread that she did use the spoon before using it on him.  Same goes for their mutual lewdness.       Okay point. I guess we've got to push this thing to bump limit somehow.  Reminder to all delusional Irohafags: Y our beloved family photo of 8man, Iroha and child is NTR by the creators own tags.    The only evidence of the indirect kiss is a post from 2ch. Strangely enough, the anon that translated the dialog about the taste didn't offer up anything that would indicate an indirect kiss, in spite of there being a good two pages of text before and a page and a half of text after the exchange.  And the "mutual lewdness" is nothing but your waifu goggles being screwed on too tight. 8man was nonplussed at best, as he is with every other advance Iroha has made.           here's your reply     The only evidence of the indirect kiss is a post from 2ch. Strangely enough, the anon that translated the dialog about the taste didn't offer up anything that would indicate an indirect kiss, in spite of there being a good two pages of text before and a page and a half of text after the exchange.   Are you fucking retard? If you don't know any moon then please just stop already.   Fucking EOP.        I know you're shitposting but it's sort of in the text. After Iroha shoves the spoon in his mouth he's thinking, hey weren't you just tasting from this.      I'd believe that if the translator had actually included the line in question. Again, seems kind of strange that such a major detail would get left out.  When someone actually quotes the line you can consider this post an apology and I'll back down.  Until then of course, I'm more than in my rights to be skeptical of the most rabidly delusional group in these threads.        While I agree the indirect kiss thing is suspect, it's worth note that the translator anon who did the dialogue admitted not being able to translate a lot of the descriptive text because of the higher levels of kanji used compared to the dialogue itself. (Which was so simple that even barely-literate anons who only knew kana could read it.)  So it's not like he knew everything was going on and selectively neglected confirming the spoon thing.  That said I've noticed comments about the spoon have also started appearing in the Nico recap of the event, so at the very least it's not something that /a/nons are blowing out of proportion as it's spreading on japanese communities as well. (Yes there are a lot of dumbass weebs who spam japanese memes on nico but these seemed to be informed comments.)  Claiming 8man seemed nonplussed (let alone "at best") about the dialogue is downright silly though. He returned her advances, which is downright exceptional as far as 8man is concerned.          Fucking pleb, I love you anon   NEW SYMPHOGEAR GX PV! GET HYPE, FAGGETS! IT'S REAL! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]       WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TUMBLR FILTER BULLSHIT.   Looking forward to it. Hopefully it's better than G.      YES YES   finally   Pls don't bully   Seriously, how does this shit gets more season.  Season 1 was easily among the worst anime shows of all time.     She's too useless so even got kicked out from jail.      Because you have shit taste. Your favorite show will never get new season unless you paid money as us.    S2CA in the first episode  Cumming buckets    I don't understand, anon. How could you watch that PV and not instantly understand what people love this series for.  I for one am trying to hide my huge fucking happy grin after watching this during uni.    Remember, kids. Don't use LiNKER.  Can't. Stop. Watching.  That new song is lovely.  GUNGNIR  WUB WUB WUB DATTO? WUB WUB WUB      It's not ramen   Elfnine a cute  So i guess Maria won't have relic in s3 for first few episodes?  Who are you calling Raildex rejected character design?   villains are more girls with probably sad pasts and good intentions   I kinda miss season 1 when you had this feel of impending doom with noise fucking up the world at any time, was a decent setting for girls in armor fucking shit up.  dramatic villains will just make for more shitty added drama and pointless filler like season 2 felt mid-season.  will still enjoy the fuck out of this tho.         Yeah, it's broken according to the character description. But that didn't stop it from activating last season. She probably doesn't even have the pendant, Kirika and Shirabe didn't have theirs either.<br/>     determination to fist    [Megadeth Party intensifies]  I was just too excited, I'm sorry.     I hated both antagonists in S1 and S2 but yea S1 was amazing.     Too bad we're never going to be able to see it.   But the dolls are free to beat up without repercussions.   NOW I'VE LOST IT   Smug, isn't she?    Who voices who again? I only know Misaki Kuno.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizu<wbr>ka_Ishigami  You will also see her in fall  </wbr>     That no-name resume  Disgusting.    Ned buntline93R is the villain.  I wonder the last 2 slots are just nothing or secret characters.

Give the newbies a chance. I wonder how these people feel like, sitting in the same recording room as Nana Mizuki.     Shitty quality webm  puu dot sh/iAMos dot webm     Westphalia is relevant.     in the pastebin here<br/>     I would feel honored and pressured at the same time if ever I would have the opportunity to work with all those professional VAs in the industry. Regardless, I couldn't care less about a no-name VA like her.    no singing    She's not really no game anyway, just not getting crazy push like Amamiya Sora.    Marked as ひみつ, so secret characters.     Peace of Westphalia   relevant in the 21st century  Satelight, wot?     How gay will it be?  I want to protect that smile.   Not nearly enough.    Yeah, there's something to the tone that early S1 had that might not be able to be replicated here. On the other hand, there was plenty of room to improve on S2's take on villains, so the opportunity is there.    Are the new sluts gonna join Hibiki's harem too? We kinda have too many girls now.     Chrismind.      Oh look, a time paradox.    <br/>     08:24   08:23  Damn.       Dolls probably gonna die. No idea about the two twins. Maybe they will fuse and become one and then die or return to their home planet.    <br/>    Until what ends Bwen?   Subs never Fuck commeme       You should be able to recognize enough moonspeak to watch it raw now, anon.    So what song was this? OP or ED? The concert looks like it will be another highlight, but it will be tough to beat the previous ones.      You'd be surprised. If you are not actively trying to link the moonspeak you hear to the subtitles you are not gonna learn anything even if you watch anime for 50 years.    Neither. OP is called Exterminate and ED called Rebirth-Day. Probably gonna be a battle song. Sounds a lot like a finale song though.     MARIA DINDU NUFFIN JUST TRYIN GET HER LIFE ON TRACK NEED MO' MONEY FOR DEM CONCERTS     I am One with the Hype  IT'S HYPENING  How many songs are they going to fit into the first episode? Probably like 3 not including OP and ED, from the looks of the concert and likely two battles that they previewed. Excited   They'd feel awkward at first, but once they see Nana is kind and acts like a grade schooler sometimes they'll warm up eventually. Then they'll be reminded of their position again once Nana starts to do her job and once they see her sing live.     I hope at least red and blue do. They are cute as fuck.     Don't you know in Symphogear universe the leader of NSA is also the leader of Illuminati?    mfw see this  FUCK YES     Symphogear game by Platinum when?   Tsubasa looks like a man, holy shit.   Song of prologue, Hibiki's battle song, live concert song, special ED song.    meant to quote<br/>    Who da man? Tsubaman.    GET EXCITE!     I WANT TO PROTECT YUKINE'S SMILE!     And?   Do people actually think this is a good show or is it just a meme show?   We're all just here because we want to fuck Chris Or get fucked by Tsubasa Or watch Miku and Hibiki make out      Good action, amazing music, fun characters, interesting mythology of the show, ending of S1 is GOAT.  It's just great.     [SENKOU INTENSIFIES] when?    Tsubasa will never gently dominate you   Tsubasa gently fucking Chris doujins never  Why      We like it because its full of dumb fun, we love Nana Mizuki, and we like cute manly girls fighting while singing.   So if I get this right they authorized international geah action.   I think I'm gay for Tsubaman.      Watch it for the girls   Wow, /a/ really does love moeshit    Good action, amazing music, fun characters, interesting mythology of the show, ending of S1 is GOAT   Stop lying anytime.            Watching anime for girls is better than watching anime for the gay men.     hating fun  it's like I'm really on /v/      makes me think of magi and the jew faction     Given that you're commenting on it with such conviction, I have to assume you've watched the whole thing. I mean, you'd look pretty dumb if you called something shit without ever watching it.      Just an observation on how the other boards are correct in the statement of moe anime and /a/, not saying it's bad.   Saw Season 1 and 4 episodes of Season 2. First few episodes were pretty interesting but it all came back to moe shit. The final fight was alright though.         There's plenty of worse stuff than Symphogear mind you. I thought it was ok to watch, story may not be spectacular but was enjoyable to watch.     people describe what they like about Symphogear   dismiss it out of hand   posts western shit <br/>      http://anoxy.se/uploads/2015/06/2qu<wbr>32w8qg6ytzdr.webm</wbr>   So guys, what are the lyrics for Dark Oblivion anyway?   Stand up! Hello ground!      thread slowly getting derailed again  Jesus Christ, just ignore the faggot.  So what is your wild speculahs for GX, /a/?       4 episodes of Season 2   missed out on episode 5, the point where everything goes completely batshit   missed episode 6, where best girl appears      Does anyone have Bikkiebutt statistics on them?    moeshit  Please go back to /v/ or /co/ and never fucking come back.     Did they change Anime ja nai's hairstyle?      So what is your wild speculahs for GX, /a/?    Maria will be useful again        http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/sy<wbr>mphogearg/darkoblivion.htm Really good english. Hikasa just butchered the pronounciation. </wbr>     those vagina bones  It looks quite weird but its lewd as hell. I liked Tsubasa's G gear more, why do they have to remove parts of their already revealing gears? Are they prostitutes or something?       Are they prostitutes or something?  Idols. Same thing really.     Hibizerker will appear as a separate entity, have a crazy punch-on with Hibiki, then be tamed by the power of SUNSHINE.    They should've let Ayahi sing that, for god's sake. Nana x Ayahi duet when?     Are you implying Nana is a prostitute? Don't compare actual pure idols to the sluts that fuck everyone for money and don't give a shit about their fans.        Nana   Idol   Bitch she's an artist.      Did they put Maria in a goddamn straitjacket What are they afraid she'll do, cry at them?    They're afraid her uselessness might spread to other Gears.    She is called an idol too by some people, fucker.     That was the joke.   Now post what you hear her singing.      But Tsubasa isn't a prostitute. If anything she'll be the one to buy the prostitutes.      Tsubasa became Chris' new pimp     Please no bully. Chris is pure.     That doesn't stop her from having a youth full of hard work.       Tsubasa-senpai please stop with your heart hymen thing.       not hibiki  what    That concert looks even more amazing than in G. I can't wait for the song.    So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Also the fact that they're bringing back the shitty G Gears is making me reeeeeeeeee       chuck boulders  Eat, sleep and movies.   sprint across water  Ninja.        Miku already bought them all.   So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Ogawa is literally a ninja. Genjuro is just that manly.         nolongerpodracing.jpg     They watched lots of action movies.  reeeeeee  Fuck off back to       Jesus Christ this PV almost dislocated my jaw. I'm going to need to buy a stand of some sort before the first episode if I want to come out unscathed.    She got a boobpad instead.    The House of Ogawa  The House of Ogawa: Descendants of ninjas from the Hida clan. A long time ago, the Ogawa family worked for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but they disappeared during the Battle of Sekigahara until they reappeared after the Meiji Restoration to work for the government. Since then, they've fought to subvert the country's domestic enemies who work to try and bring down the government. The previous leader of the family, Ogawa Kunimitsu, died and the eldest brother of the siblings, Souji, took over. The second eldest, Shinji, used his abilities to become a direct agent of the government. Suteinu, the youngest brother, was freed from any familial responsibility because he did not want to inherit the old traditions. So he became a host at a hostclub in Kabukichou, Shinjuku known as "Absolute Zero." There he's known as the No.4 host "Alan" and works throughout the nights. The technique that Tsubasa utilizes, Shadow Weaving, was originally Ogawa Shinji's forte. Tsubasa was attracted to the convenience of the move and mastered it over the course of 3 years.   chuck boulders  Eat, sleep and watch movies.         So no then. Because it bugs me when a show tries to keep a consistent set of rules, but then throws in Kill la Kill "lol anything goes" whenever it wants.  Also who else looking forward to more awful Engrish this season?         Genjuro is consistently a badass. Ogawa is consistently a ninja. I don't see the problem here.      consistent set of rules  You might be in the wrong thread, anon, this is for Symphogear.     holy shit that combination song, dat PV, dem witches and actually exploring something outside of relics and shit. just so damn hype.     You take anime too seriously anon.   I'M FUCKING READY    no chris boobpad   no hibiki buttpad   no pad with tsubasa's finely toned   back  why even live?        no chris boobpad  This exists.

Apparently Luffy's D will pierce the heavens?     2 other One Piece threads out there   starts a third!   Do you even know how to use the catalog?       Tomorrow? But chapters don't come out til thursday.    muh Doffyfags  fuck off already   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359  stop posting this unfunny bullshit    Lucci is a good boy   <strong style="color: red;">(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)</strong>     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359   cancer       posted a total of once   cancer       It's a ban evader. Just check the ban page or the archive.  Mod already gave the poster a 30 day ban so it is only a matter of time before he gets an IP Range Ban.      Nigga I ain't even been banned before    do you?   What do you think this bastard is up to?   Taking Haki cocks up the ass    Hope the scene switches back to sanji at the end of the chapter.    Only one other OP thread and is reaching bump limit.  Do you even know how to use the catalog?      Sounds good.   I am sure he does not. Clearly that comment in no way showed any ability of using the said function...      reminder that one piece &gt;  two pieces    For a second I thought I read "beginning". That would be fucking cruel!    yfw Doflamingo had another pair of glasses and the arc goes on for another year   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105359   The one piece is actually the murder devil fruit and it just lets you murder murder pistol everyone ever and they all die in a giant murder circle they're all dead except you,   AND THEN THERE WAS BLOOD COMMING OUT OF YOU AND THE BLOOD GOT EVERYWHERE EVEN ON A SMALL CHILD AND LITTLE DOG!!!!   IT WAS DANGEROUS TO GO IN THE WATER WITH A DEVIL FRUIT BEFORE BECAUSE YOU WOULD SINK BUT NOW ITS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BLOOOOOOOOOOOOD COMMING OUT OF YOU AND ALL THE SHARKS WILL COME SWIMMING AT YOU AND EAT YOU.   SOON EVERYONE GOT TIRED AND SENT YOU TO SPACE SO THAT YOU DONT GET BLOOD ON ANYONE ANYMORE AND THEN YOU EXPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODE   the scariest thing is that you have alreaady eaten the one piece and forgot...   now you are on a new adventure again to find the one piece...   love /x/, got you spooked ey.          Why is belly dance so hot?    we finally get to see his eyes next chapter   doffyfag tears  What, are you retarded ? Sure it's not a btfo thread but retardation wise it might as well be.        &gt;we finally get to see his eyes next chapter  What the fuck are you talking about?     His glasses fell off, silly.     glasses break last chapter   implying Oda won't reveal what his eyes look like next chapter     Doffy doesn't have eyes, he uses observation haki to see    It's not. It's the girl.     That'd be neat but I doubt it. He probably has plain, normal eyes. We know his right one is normal at the very least. Now the left one might be damaged somehow but we can't be sure.    His left eye is  a flamingo!    Doflamingo's glasses were actually a device to suppress his haki.   Calling it, his eyes won't be revealed yet, but Oda will tease us.    banned    Did anyone actually expect a shonen villain to win?    The time of teasing of over, Oda had his fun, now is the time for the reveal.    they do, sometimes    It sometimes happens, but just to allow the MC to come back fuck villain's shit backwards.     Crocodile won twice, Kizaru/Kuma won, Magellan won.     No but somehow retards in this thread make a confusion between being a Doffyfag and expecting him to win. Probably because anyone of average intelligence predicted Doffy wasn't out with just Redhawk.   What do you think Doflamingo's eyes are like?  They're probably kawaii circles.     It's not the destination, it's the journey       "D" pierces the heavens    Spoiler when?  Duh!   Doffy is Ruffy's father, obviously     I hope the penguinposter gets banned too    Exactly like pic related.    Shut the fuck up, Dentist anon is cool.    left one is missing    I hope shitposters get banned too     Say hello to Monkey  Drill  Luffy, anon.      What do you think Doflamingo's eyes are like?   photoshop Rocinante's eye onto Dofla   literally Zoro   This is why you're the master Oda        Because he can only draw three different faces?    Hopefully the entire board gets banned    MODS=GODS     (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)     i don't understand. what happened? did i miss something?    Press F5.    yfw Doffy gets up from that    What?    Exactly where luccifags belong     No I just want this shit to be over and stay that way.     HAHAHA SUCK IT LUCCIFAGS, WORST SAGA VILLAIN AFTER HODY    Followed by a sad, one page flashback of him shooting Rosinate, then fell back, unconscious. That would be good.    Quick, guys! Reply  with your best One Piece laughter!   no, like, why was he banned? i didn't see     Chronic shitposting.     This shit of villains being redeemed or feeling regret in some way needs to stop. If he gets up he should laugh and spill the 'secret'    But that hasn't happened in One Piece, has it? Except probably Moria's rant.    Just make the mods aware of the penguin poster and he will get banned as well.  Mods have banned attentionwhores before especially those that forced memes and also blog about their lives on /a/.  Penguin poster is an attentionwhore and also samefags his own replies as well and also tries to circlejerk with his equally attentionwhoring fanclub.          He was banned for constant ban evading.   Instead of waiting until his ban was over, the cancerous Luccifag kept evading his ban so now hopefully he gets a permaban.      Remembering when he used to be a woman and wondering if he will ever become Luffy's nakama    Doffy is such a step up from the older villains in every way, it would be disappointing if he 'fainted' and went to the background/Impel Down quietly following that fight like all the others.    Don't worry, Sugar will turn him into toy.   Reposting from last thread   Sweet sweet justice       Normal eyes with his left gouged out.      Thousand arrows ?! Zygarde is that you ?     aww, really? he'll be back within a day though. I can bet my leg on it.   Why is Usopp worst Strawhat?   Cause of his dick nose     Why the left one?     Why are you such a faggot?    But Sanji and Chopper are the worst.    We've seen his right one      I just wanted some pasta  ;_;       Luffy is worst strawhat. Usopp is best. Everyone else is good.    Shit I don't even remember that. Guess I'm a faggot    Ussop is best, Robin is mai waifu, and  Nami  is the worst    But Luffy is. He's literally the worst pirate of the worst generation.    so he's basically Zoro    Because he is a pathetic simpering coward  The only time he ever fought seriously was against his own captain over a broken ship and only because he knew Luffy wouldn't kill him.  The only fights he ever won were  1. Because he was so pathetic his self esteem actually could not get lower 2. Because he lost so badly that it startled Sugar   But he sniped sugar   Thats all            when do we get spoilers?   He fought seriously in Arabasta.    That wasn't solo    not as pathetic as Rebecca and her brain dead fans.      Oh shit, I didn't notice this.   Pokemon has great girls, do you agree?   They are all extremely fappable.    gen 5 hast best girls. The best being the bun girl with the leggings.      TFW most pokemon doujins are furryshit   Why     I just wish the artists didn't give the girls watermelons instead of breasts. THat-s fucking disgusting.     TFW only played XY because my custom Serana    School Noire is best Noire.     Beru sure is cute...      She would look cute pregnant, wouldn't she?     The cool kids strike back.  I fucking love  Shun__    yfw Academia invaded Standard Dimension off-screen   In like 30-40 episodes from now, we get flashbacks about the invasion.   Best dad is carded   Best mom is carded   YSDS Kid Trio is carded   Everyone from LDS that remained behind is carded   We find out that Yusho was missing because he was carded by Dennis/Leo/Yuri   Yuzu gets captured during Synchro Dimension arc because she sacrifices herself to protect Yuya   Yuya has realised TRUE ZETSUBOU that goes beyond a mere Edge Mode    Its not like anything is stopping them from doing it now. Their only line of defence is:  Himika (she probably isn't a duelist, but if she was, she would be the strongest on this list... which doesn't say much since she would still be shit)   Masumi (would get BTFO by Obelisk Force easily if Sora's implied statement about Fusion Dimension duelists being stronger than LDS Fusion users)   Yaiba (a jobber who lost to Kachidoki off-screen)   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127095574#p127109998">Click here</a> to view the full text.
