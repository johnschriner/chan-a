[ How do you watch anime all day long?  I don't.  I barely watch any anymore  <br><br><br>/a/, circa 2015</br></br></br>   watching anime   I only watch 1-2 eps a day while i exercise. Too busy to watch any more than that.  I watch like 1 show every two seasons.  <br>Well, first you drop out of school. Then you don't get a job. That's about how my progression went.</br>  <br>Then anime stops filling the void and all you have is /a/</br>  I tend to marathon series until I get burnt out, then I take a break.   /a/ <br> Watching anime </br>  With one hand on my dick.  <br> watching anime </br>  Since this thread OP has elf, may as well ask here.<br>So I was just reading about the anime Isekai Monogatari, and it say it contains dark elf, so I wanna ask.<br> It is safe that the elves are treated nice? <br> This anime is a spinoff of what? <br> Why Aura looks so cute? </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>I can only watch School Days for so many hours.</br>  I mainly watch it on weekends.<br>I try to watch at least one episode a day, but working and going to college at the same time takes way too much time, wish my family was wealthy enough to support a neet lifestyle for me.</br>  Tend to watch anime all day long every sunday about 2 years ago.<br>Now I barely watch any anime. Just lurking /a/.<br>I hope that someday I will get the urge back to watch so much. Were some comfy times.</br></br>  <br>She's not an elf.</br>  I don't, I have a job  I don't get how people can marathon anime.<br>I can get manga or anything else, but anime?</br>  <br><br>How so?</br></br>   this isn't a Levia thread   <br> kanahana became troll fairy </br>  <br>Doesn't everyone watch just like 3 or 4 a week</br>  <br>Who let this plebeian in?</br>  -Wake up<br>-Turn on Computer<br>-Watch an anime<br>-When you finish that anime, find and watch another anime<br>-Repeat until tired</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My record's like 48 in a day.<br><br>It takes some perseverance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only watch about an hour of anime each day (3 episodes). I also work on my film backlog by fitting about 2 hours (average lenght of a film) before i get to sleep, and sometimes the film ends up being an animated one. That's the only occasion when i watch more than an hour in one day.</br>  Extensive use of piss bottles.  <br>I do but not often due to my job having such unstable working hours. On the good side I get cash to buyfag.</br>  <br> wish my family was wealthy enough to support a neet lifestyle for me. <br>You don't need wealth to be a NEET, you need to be extremely cheap. Get down to less than $1 a day. Move around less so you can eat less. Eat less than that. Throw away your pride as a human being. Shamelessly mooch any resources you can mooch.<br><br>And then you don't have to work anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Aura is a Dark Elf, and is not only one of the cutest Dark Elf, but also she is not being raped or being a sexslave, and she can win an MC, the only two obstacles are that she is part of a harem, and MC is clueless as fuck. Other than that, she can lose and still be safe, or she can win and this will be the best harem anime.</br>  I marathon a season of something, and then spend two days indecisively staring at my backlog trying to pick the next one to start.<br><br>Get a laptop or tablet, that way you can still watch when you go to the bathroom, bathe, or make food.</br></br>  <br>  Just making sure, there hasn't been one for quite a while right? I want to make sure I don't miss it if it does suddenly pop up. </br>  <br>what makes you think I have material for a whole day?<br>I always drop 25 shows and only watch 5. <br>clrearly not enough to watch anime ALL DAY!<br>unless you have shit taste and watch everything that comes out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just broke 200 episodes in this month alone. Get on my level Pleb.</br>  <br>25 episodes minimum, unless it's a full manga day.</br>  <br>I don't even really know how to explain it.</br>  7:15 AM- Wake up.<br>7:15-7:30- Check threads on /a/ that I kept open overnight, bump ones that are still alive and on the lower pages.<br>7:30-8:00- Browse other threads.<br>8:00-9:00- Watch anime.<br>9:00-9:30- Breakfast, browse /a/ while eating.<br>9:30-11:00- Watch anime.<br>11:00-11:15- Browse /a/ and add more anime to backlog by hitting the random button on bakabt and downloading everything I get.<br>11:15-12:30 PM- A nice, long, hot bath.

Some days I spend more time here because I don't feel like watching what I have and need to wait for something else to download. Typing it out made me realize I haven't read a manga in months. I really need to work on that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even watch anime. I spend 60 seconds a week reading the one manga that I like. Then I shitpost on /a/ for a minimum of 4 hours a day.</br>  <br>Seems relaxing bud.</br>  I try to watch 8-10 episodes a day <br>Sometimes 4-6 if I have work, but I'll still try to finish some series during lunch break by watching it with subtitles and no volume, this work best for the monogatari series<br><br>Trying to finish as much animes as possible so I can mark them as complete on MAL</br></br></br>  <br>When do you read?</br>  <br> watching anime </br>  <br>I haven't, recently.

HMS Prince of Wales would be cute aswell if she have a phobia of planes and pilot fairies constantly bully her. HMAS Vampire would also be cute if she come with the whole blonde loli vampire theme with her.<br>Don't know about VMF, maybe someone who served alongside Bep during her time in Pacific fleet.</br></br>    <br>Blame Refrain</br>    <br>Yeah, Enterprise is waifu killer and only shitter likes her</br>  <br> no HMS Gay Viking <br>Stalker pls</br></br>  <br>Not before Japanese coastal ships, I need those super loli ships.</br>  <br> Enterprise is waifu killer <br>Maybe if your waifu wasn't shit, she'd be alive.</br></br>  Kaga is mou kuso  <br>It's not her fault but Commander in Chief of the combined fleet.</br>  Would Lexington CV-2 be a delicious Christmas cake ?  <br>I searched in Google and Yandex, no results.<br>Source?</br></br>  <br>It's moe sugoi, anon.</br>  <br>No Yadokari is going to draw her and she's going to be a loli. <br><br> i-074 </br></br></br>  <br>Lexington a fat</br>  <br> &gt;i-074 <br>Yeah, the filename was so helpful.</br></br>  I can't wait to be able to torture Kaga.  <br>It (most likely) means that the image comes from one of the anthologies.</br>  <br> Touhou <br>You must be new here</br></br>  <br>Here anon, I don't have the link for better scans though.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/123441<wbr>786/#q123442532</wbr></br></br>  KILL<br>A<br>G<br>A</br></br></br>  <br>You mean healthy</br>  What does a dead Kaga look like?  <br><br>Man, this guy is disturbing.</br></br>  <br>I'm here since 1948, respect your olders, faget.<br><br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nice memeship</br>  <br>Anything for fellow Kagafans</br>  <br>Lexington a soft</br>  This is not a boy.  <br>Show, don't just tell.</br>  <br> Don't know about VMF, maybe someone who served alongside Bep during her time in Pacific fleet. <br>Maybe this ship? <br>http://www.combinedfleet.com/haruzu<wbr>_t.htm<br>Hopefully she would be Of Balance )))))))))0</br></wbr></br></br></br>   Poi   <br> STOP </br>  <br>Is this a boy?</br>  <br>Enterprise and Yorktown bullying the other CVs when?</br>  <br>The girliest.</br>  <br>Stalker, what would you do with a loli Mamiya?</br>  <br>Shitpoisting will never stop</br>  <br>umad cuz ur waifu bad</br>  <br> that maury smug </br>  <br> bad <br>Nah, she just caught by surprise</br></br>  <br> caught by surprise <br> not bad <br>japs cannot into scouting or radar <br>or damage control for that matter, pic related<br>shamfuru dispuray</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That could work but I would rather have a pure Soviet ship, that way Hibiki would have someone to respond to her in Russian.<br><br>I wou</br></br></br>  <br> I wou </br>  <br> he wou </br>  Kaga HAS to die.  <br>Meant to say; I would use the food ticket a lot more to hear her. Speaking of Mamiya, I wonder when she'll become droppable, the only support girls left are her and Irako. Would be nice if she have some passive effect like slowly raising the morale of the girls in the same fleet as her.</br>  Holy shit, how fucking hot would HMS Warspite sama be? <br><br>Haughty as fuck. <br><br><br>Probably a Gangut class battleship or a Nakhimov or Kirov class cruiser, they actually provided shore bombardment during the war.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does Kaga get raped often? I hope she does.  <br> HMS Warspite sama <br>BBA the level of Kongou?

Germany during WW2 could have given 40 different awards to Bismarck for various bullshit reasons but it wouldn't mean anyway.</br>  Why did Touma punch such a beautiful lady?  <br>Manlet rage.

It's a fact that people in Index do not ever have sex under any circumstances whatsoever, no exceptions.</br>  <br>Because he wants to hit that.</br>  <br><br> Oriana was a nun who became a stripper mercenary <br><br>Oh god that's hot.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Cause being Alpha means you don't let hot women play you like a fiddle anon.<br>You probably fidget and stutter.</br></br>  Why does her hair change every scene were the animators dropping acid or something?  <br>worst girl</br>    <br>is Index</br>  <br><br>Sherry Cromwell*</br></br>  <br>At least she doesn't appear as often as Index.</br>  <br>she wasn't living her life correctly. And he liked big breasted onee-samas. He was hoping to pop her into his harem with a one of his patented pimpslaps of justice.<br><br>it  half worked.  </br></br></br>  <br>Because he believes in Gender Equality<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kyt<wbr>O5uUExXo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Because he totally hit on her.</br>  <br>That was a strange ending, she wasn't the villain, she wasn't the one who needed that punch, there was no reason for her to freak out so much but it was her who got punched in the end.</br>  <br>Big boob onee-chans are his type though.</br>  <br>good taste</br>  <br><br>She fucked with his homies and was trying to make a mess of his city, pretty good reason I'd say.</br></br>  Just read NT7. <br><br>So that guy pretending to be #6 was a fake. I get that but according to the Agitate Halation plan all the Level 5's should have shown up. <br><br>Does that mean the #6 was there and we just didn't see them? Also can we safely assume that because Rensa can't copy Gunha's powers that #6 mustn't be a gemstone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma's gotta break her illusion so she can hear music again and reunite her with her other half and all that jazz. Plus those that get punched get added to the harem anyway.<br><br>I hope Shutaura eventually reappears in a future volume.</br></br></br>  <br>was wondering that myself her hair changes every other scene. <br>guess the animators were having a waifu war</br></br>  <br><br> he totally didn't have a huge hydra boner under those bed sheets looking at a total bomb shell that is Kanzaki Kaori </br></br>  <br>He wasn't thinking clearly at the time.<br>Oriana is for  Sweet and tender loving cowgirl so she can look you in the eye/smother you with her breasts </br></br>  <br>what's going on there? she rescued a loli from a stripper? if index s3 ever gets made will she appear again?</br>  <br>Maybe in S4  (ha) , she only shows up again once in one of the later volumes.</br>  <br>I think she's taking a lost little girl back to her mom.<br>Reading the novels and learning about her back story actually makes me feel bad for sexualizing her.<br>Her whole goal in life is to basically help people and the reason she messed with AC and Touma is because she thought it was the best way to the unite the world and help everyone as best she can.<br>She's actually a very sweet girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why does she dress like a stripper though</br>  <br>triggered</br>  <br>Alright I can't find any morally justifiable reason for that other then can you blame her?<br>If you looked like a goddess of fertility would you wear a habit your whole life?<br><br> "Do magicians really not realize how odd they <br>look?‖<br>―…‖<br>Kamijou silently stared at Oriana‘s body, but it seemed she didn‘t notice the irony."<br><br>She might not fully realize it herself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, /fit/</br>  Oriana is just so much wasted potential... but that's pretty much the lead motif in the index series so it fits in well.  <br>Index is making him so frustrated with females that he can't help it.</br>  Because Raildex has shit writing and is meant for people too pretentious for Narutardshit to eat up.  <br>this exactly</br>  <br>Yes its Aogami Pierce</br>  <br>Fuck off. Under what evidence?</br>  <br>Because every character from idiotic trio must be relevant somehow, and so far he wasnt</br>  <br>Ah. So no actual evidence. <br><br>I'm guessing it's within the same tier of theory as Accel's "There was an experiment to stop cellular aging within the Imaginary Numbers District" comment about Komoe?<br><br>IE it's possible but it's not like there's evidence for it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just don't understand its greatness.</br>  <br>Number 6's power is different from other level 5. It probably has some connection with magic. He's probably has similarities with Tsuchimikado</br>  Was the movie from the LN or was it an original story?  <br><br>She's in English Civil War, which would probably be covered in S3</br></br>  <br>Original but written by the author of the novels and the events have been mentioned a few times in the novels that came out after it.</br>  <br>In NT12 it's revealed that  the number six regularly gives out his identity to people who are less well off than he is who could use the name/reputation of a level 5 to better their situation.  As for agitate halation, he could've been there? I don't think he'd be drawn into fighting though.</br>  Serves her right, she's a blonde. <br>I'd gladly punch every single one of those bitches.</br>  <br><br>Aogami Pierce is best #6</br></br>  <br>/thread<br><br><br> Fisting </br></br></br></br>  <br>He was feeling threatened by her height</br>  <br>At least she's not a pooskin.</br>  <br>Blondes are worse than niggers.<br>At least niggers are just dumb animals who don't know any better. Blondes are actively malevolent cunts with zero empathy or compassion who just want to make you suffer for their amusement.</br></br>  <br>They both need to be put down on sight.</br>  <br> he's not a blonde Nordic or Germanic <br><br>Quick lets point and laugh at him</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger loving faggots like you are the reason the US is going down the shitter.</br>  <br>Niggers should be put down like animals.<br>Blondes should be slowly tortured, murdered and dismembered.<br><br> being a subhuman snownigger <br>No thanks.<br><br><br> implying I like niggers <br>It's just blondes are so subhuman, they are worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Niggers should be put down like animals. <br><br>Why waste all that money when you can get sport out of hunting them?</br></br></br>  <br> just read NT7 <br>Oh boy, you're on for a wild ride.</br></br>  <br>Because being animals is the natural state of a nigger, so they'll be more experienced in surviving than urban kiddies with guns.</br>  <br>my theory is Rensa's power is based on #6<br>screen cap this if ya want</br></br>    <br><br>I think that the true number six send the fake there. So even thought he didn't come personally, he did intervene to stop the "heroes".</br></br>  <br> implying I'm wrong </br>  <br>That's all part of the thrill of the hunt.</br>  <br>#6 has connection with magic. That's my theory</br>  <br>This. Touma always loses his shit when a magic side shitter fucks with one of his friends who isn't involved in that nonsense.</br>  <br>Doubtful. In any case, the whole point of the character and his ability is that no one knows who he is. Revealing his identity at this point would ruin it.</br>  <br>Himegami was never relevant again</br>  Reminder kakine is the true No.1 esper of AC.  <br>Please go back in the fridge Kakine.</br>  <br>go away volley ball</br>  <br>/poI/ is leaking again</br>  <br>Since when does /pol/ hate blondes?</br>  <br>He's a lolicon.</br>  <br>Loving delicious flat chest doesn't make you a lolicon. <br>Speaking of btw. Wasn't Misaki pettanko when Touma fell for her?</br></br>  <br>But its not ranked by the power but how useful esper is to researchers so whats the point of those numbers anyway</br>  <br>That's what a weak jealous fag would say. <br><br><br>Only the strongest get ranked at the top.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah man because Gunha is weakest of level 5 espers right? Im pretty sure he could beat everyone other than first and second.</br>  Have you ever curious on who is the level 5 who can be penetrated by Mental Out?  <br>I was expecting this to the the first response.<br><br>You threw it off, so fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Index manga <br><br>Are we still on the ice boats?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunha never wins a fight.</br>  If she wears a belt why the fuck doesn't she actually use it?    why is it that the girls touma is attracted to are the complete opposite of what the majority of the fans like?  <br>Same reason he punches everyone else: she wasn't living her life correctly.</br>  <br>That can't be right. That would actually mean that #6 is not only sane but also incredibly reasonable, which is impossible for a level 5.</br>  <br> ―Uu… Although this isn‘t the case, your warmth has infected my entire body. I really feel <br> like handing myself over to you……‖ <br> Seeing Kamijo complaining like this, Fukiyose closes one eye before smashing a fist into <br> the back of Kamijo‘s head, causing his head to sink into the breasts of the painter nee-san. <br> That nee-san didn‘t shriek, as she gently pushes Kamijo‘s head aside, saying, <br> ―Haiz. Let me see, are you alright? You, cannot, fight, on like this forever. It‘s rare to have <br> such an activity, so of course you have to make some wonderful memories.‖ <br> Wah, Kamijo‘s looks like he‘s going to cry. <br> ―So magnanimous! So completely different from those girls who bite others and those who <br> give others a punch! I‘m about to sink in this warmth!‖ <br> Kamijo shouted out, ―Watch closely, this is a mature woman; watch and learn, you iron wall girl!‖ <br> This is an apology for knocking into you. Normally, you Japanese would lower your head <br>to apologise, but we normally do this.‖<br>―Ah……that‘s how it is?‖<br>―Ara ara. Do I need to give a kiss?‖<br>Poof!! Kamijo does a spit-take.<br>After trembling for a while, the pure and innocent Kamijo Touma shouts,<br>―I WANT A KISS!!‖<br><br>Touma really needs to run into her again so she can just give him a big soft hug so he can heal from all that torture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This blonde bitch wiped the floor with Tsuchimikado  <br><br> Touma was able land a punch on her  <br><br><br>Why is it everything that Touma does such bs?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma wants someone he can depend on, not someone who depends on him.</br>  <br>Gunha's actually ability is Jobber King. He had the ability to become as strong as necessary and gain any powers, to show how overpowered his actual opponent is when he loses to them.</br>    <br>Touma was able to punch her after runefag distracted her</br>  <br><br>So he is some sort of kumagawa?<br><br> "It's not my fault, it's GUTS fault!" </br></br></br></br>  does anyone have that picture of Asuza on a pogo stick flying into space with the quote "she died on her way back to her home planet" ?<br><br>also K-on is pretty neat.</br></br>  This?  <br>I love you</br>  <br>Arigatou</br>  Ritsu's birthday is in a month.

Pretending to be something she is not. It's all a facade, all lies.</br>  <br>Anna is a huge slut that has no shame because she doesn't know any better<br>Kajo is embarrassed because she knows exactly what she's looking at</br></br>  <br>But japs have small dicks</br>  <br>Are you talking from personal experience? Have you seen many? How big of a sample size are we talking here, 100 Japanese dicks?</br>  <br>There're exceptions to every rule.<br>Like how chinese are supposed to be short until some 7ft tall freak of nature is born and becomes a basketball star.</br></br>  <br>thats only cause the wank so much<br>this is a world where wanking is outlawed</br></br>  Kajo's mind is lewd and her heart pure. Her cause is noble. <br><br>She would be best lover.</br></br>  <br>Yep.<br>Kajo a best. Gap moe a best.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>No one would take walking in on getting NTR'd well.</br>  There's a manga of this right? Or an LN?<br>Who does the protag get with Anna or best girl Kajo? I have to know.</br>  She has a dirty mind but she's not actually horny.<br><br>And she probably never saw a real dick before, she only spreads 2D stuff.</br></br>  <br>That was no freak accident, the Chinese government had their tallest people marry and have children for the sole purpose of tall children</br>  <br>On-going LN, has a manga adaptation as well.<br><br>Apparently both Anna and Kajo formally confess their love at around the same time, not sure what volume that happens--I assume the latest. Kajo confesses as she's being arrested for something.<br><br>With any luck we'll get an unconventional polygamy end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>glasses kajo is best kajo.</br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  The OP shows her and Tanuki both going nude-terrorist so she's probably not dickophobic in of itself  <br>Why am I not surprised?</br>  <br> Anna is a huge slut <br> only lusts for one guy's D <br>She isn't anon. She;s indeed incredibly lewd but nowhere being a slut.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what I meant. She's consumed with cocklust.</br>  <br>No. There's a big difference. Being a slut means she wouldn't care whose D it was. Anna is still virgin and badly wants it from a single guy.</br>  <br>Yes anon, I get that. I wasn't literally calling her a slut in that sense. It was the easiest word to get my point across.<br><br>Rest soundly, your waifu's purity has not been insulted.</br></br></br>    <br>MC has a huge D. But why does it not even bulge on his pants?</br>  <br>stylistic choice</br>  <br>Grower not a shower<br>Or mandatory bulge-free future pants to protect our vulnerable youth</br></br>  <br>I thought Japan used the metric system.</br>  <br>He better fuck them both. He better fucking fuck them both. Don't you go and be a little faggot, Tanukichi.</br>  <br>Obviously this universe is so prude because in their reality America was run by Puritans from the very beginning and eventually they took over the world.</br>  <br>They do. Maybe its metric on the flip side of the ruler.</br>    <br><br>Cocks are measured in inches. everywhere</br></br>  <br>He's a big guy</br>  <br> Possible harem. <br><br>Thanks for the warning.

Can talk up sex for days but when it cones to the real thing, shes just as cherry as everyone else.</br>  I-I thought she was acting like she was surprised. Guess not.  <br><br> measuring by length and not weight </br></br>  <br><br>Good, thats one-less faggot with shit taste.</br></br>  <br> two girls <br> harem <br>Euthanize thyself.</br></br></br>  <br> Weight <br> Not Volume and Density </br></br>  <br><br>this show had so much promise, dropped</br></br>  <br> not by the number of particles </br>  Real semen demon when?  <br>To be fair, he did say possible.<br><br>Hyouka seems to be into him in ways most emotionless characters show it</br></br></br>  <br>His member is big but his body isn't. Anna is even bigger than he is.</br>  <br/>  <br>Sadly, this doesn't make sense. If you measure by number of particles, the number will be huge which means you are trying to overcompensate. The others worked because even a small amount using those units of measurement is huge for a cock.</br>        <br>So this is where cowtits mirai came from.</br>  <br>I think it was more from seeing your best friend naked and trying to seduce your other new fried.<br><br>Kinda like how it's really awkward to walk in on family members getting kinky or stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/mgg/</br>  This anime is pantsu-on-head retarded.<br><br>Still, the action sequences are kinda fun</br></br>  So if nobody knows where babies come from how have the birth rates not fallen and the country dissappeared?  <br>Like I said, show's retarded</br>  <br>its about up until high school probably.</br>  <br>who says this isn't happening?</br>  <br><br>Can't self insert anymore, faggot?</br></br>  <br>Did you ever read The Giver when you were younger?

That way only the ones who were selected by the government would know how a baby is really formed.</br>  <br><br>There's a pretty big jump from dirty jokes to witnessing p0n0s about to enter vag00 in real life.</br></br>  <br>i guess there will be an official training course or book once you are married. <br> Ok you are married, you may now officially kiss, also here is a book, be sure to study it well *grin* </br></br>  <br>Because if it were happening they wouldn't go further with the laws as they're doing because they'll destroy the country</br>  <br>Like most of /a/ I guess, we talk about lewd things all the time but only a very small percentage of anons actually had sex.</br>  <br>Or he might have a lot of dick cheese. <br><br>Imagine that smell hitting you full on.</br></br></br>  More important than that, how come in a extremely morally conservative society they let a girl wear such short shorts?  <br>This so much. You all acting surprised as if most people in this board wouldn't lose their cool if they saw a vagina in real life</br>  <br>my friend and his gf had sex on the bed behind me while I was playing burnout and that didn't bother me one bit.</br>  <br><br>This show is fucking terrible. It's not funny in the slightest, the MC is a huge beta faggot. And the characters are completely uninteresting.<br><br>Anime just plain blows, it seems. Manga is vastly superior.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But my doujins told me the smell turns girls into cock slaves!</br>  <br>She looks like a kid, the law must ignore lolicons exist<br><br>(like how British law used to outlaw gays but not lesbians)</br></br></br>  <br>okay then</br>  <br>People actually thinking this is good should just watch Qwaser instead. That thing was an absolute masterpiss.</br>  <br><br>That repressed sexual tension has to come out somehow</br></br>  <br>Did he fuck Eva?</br>  <br>This dude has a point. Also can you even buy shorts this short any more? Those look like they're out of the 80s.<br><br>Not that any of you fags would remember the 80s...</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know which is funnier, that it "didn't bother" you, or that it didn't bother them to have sex behind you.</br></br>  <br>It's about as appealing to them as tuna vaginas are to men.</br>  <br>Everyone did, Volgin even did it up the ass</br>  <br>I remember the 80s, micheal jackson was still alive, and black.</br>  Kajo is healthy lewd, Anna isnt more lewd its just that those kids are cannisters so full of opressed sexual desires they dont even realise it so when they get poked it blews the whole thing. <br>Kajo lets steam off gradually like you are supposed to.</br>  <br>Those are in fashion again, or at least they are were I live</br>  <br>A little bit of natural dick stank is fine but dick cheese is fucking disgusting in any case. They put that shit in doujins because they're written by and/or for ronery unwashed otaku.</br>  <br><br>Anon I saw a real life 3DPD loli wearing booty shorts walking down the streets not too long ago</br></br>  <br>there were two other people in the room too.</br>  <br>So she's just boring.</br>  <br>were you able to hide that you were checking her out?</br>  kajo is normal lewd girl<br><br>Anna is "pure" semen demon</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure there was anyone who did not fuck Eva in Snake Eater. Except for Ocelot.</br>  <br><br>Yes<br><br>But that was because I averted my eyes like a second later. I don't wanna turn into a 3DPD pedo, that shit carries too much baggage<br><br>For real though, that booty was nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why'd she beat him down and tie him up if she thought he was consenting?</br>  I bet Anna is the type of heroine that is willing to share.  Talking about "unexpected" personality traits, eyebags-chan has a pretty decent awareness actually.<br><br>How mad is she going to be? I can feel her tranquil fury.</br></br>  You wouldn't fuck middle schoolers  Are there decent doujins of this  <br><br>You are right.</br></br>   Anyone not wanting to fuck Country Grown JC   I'd walk this middle schooler home gently.  The right one was kinda hot at times.<br>I have no clue why they were middle schoolers instead of high schoolers.</br>  <br>no but I would love-snuggle those two fictional characters.</br>  I would marry the tomboy.    <br>Yes I wouldnt they are disgusting</br>  I'd tuck that tomboy regardless of age.    I want to marry Tamako!    <br>Who's the guy on the left supposed to be?</br>  <br><br>What's middle school? We don't have that here. All we have is 6 years of gradeschool (age 6 to 12) and 5 years of Highschool (age 12 to 17)<br><br>I'd guess it's in between these two? So like age 13 and 14? That's a bit young, but depending on the individual can be fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good thing they are in highschool.</br>  <br> Hi, I haven't even seen the anime </br>  <br> You wouldn't fuck middle schoolers <br>Till my corona became so worn doctors would assume I underwent a shoddy circumcision at birth, I would.</br></br>    <br>Don't respond to tripfags. Ignore them long enough and they kill themselves. It's for the best if that happens.</br>  <br>ages 13-15 iirc<br><br>if you were to just count the school years it's referring to years 7-9, which you can translate into your own local system.</br></br></br>  <br>What was the word again?

I still think discussion on this subject should be moved to /qa/, this doesn't need a lot of threads.</br></br>  <br>You should've picked actual anime for your image.</br>  Everyone download there doujin, waifus, Hentai and Lolicons before it's to late   switzerland not involved <br><br>How does anyone want to live elsewhere? Its like a paradise here.</br></br>  <br>That's what the TTIP is for Anon</br>  <br><br>My work (making the OP) is done.<br><br>Now, whether or not /a/ takes action, that is another matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They might not be involved, but the actual places of creation are.</br>  <br>we need all the boards of 4chan to take action</br>  <br>I have 3 cousins in Switzerland.<br>They have nothing but bad things to say about it.</br></br>  <br>is pic related happening, if this BS happens?</br>  <br>Like what? It's a beautiful place.<br><br>They're probably a bunch of faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much yes. Only the big guys get a win out of it while the regular folks are at a big loss.</br>   The Counsel for Negotiations is supposed to "negotiate". Anyone can blindly swallow demands, even a kid. I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. If they can't even do that, Japan may as well be America's dog. <br><br>  This is in response to the TPP finalizing the copyright protection period as "70 years after the author's death", and non-Antragsdelikt. The latter means that anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. <br><br>Love Hina/Negima/UQ Holder's Ken Akamatsu actually tweeted this shit about the TPP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Time to buy new HDDs and downloading a lot of doujins, manga, and anime.</br>  <br>He knows what's up. This is terrible.</br>  I think were fine as long as China, India and all of Europe don't sign this treaty<br><br>I might be wrong though</br></br>  <br>This is a thing I'm concerned. How will this shit affect me directly and my cartoon porn if my country isn't part of all that mess?</br>  <br> 4chan  <br> taking action <br>We're here because we never took action for anything</br></br></br>  Don't forget, its not just the repesentives/senators that you should be notifying but those who have big following  e-celebs/etc. (hate to say it but chibireview has a large following. the same with those Let's players. Those people too will be targeted by the TPP.)  If those people know how fucked they'll be if this passes than they will tell their fanbases about it and it'll spread from there.  <br>Why, because they actually force you to work?</br>  <br>Europe is on its way to sign its version of TPP, called TTIP. That's why you have to call your MEPs to stop it. Also, TiSA.<br><br>India and China wants in on the TPP too.</br></br></br>  I'm still not sure how this is related to /a/.  <br>Your cartoon porn won't be made.</br>  <br>so it affects anime reviewers <br>does that mean If i said something bad about an anime in my reviews they can sue me</br></br>  <br>Well, they are portuguese.</br>  <br>B-but I'm a slav.</br>  Fuck off with this shit, no one cares.  <br>/a/ basically watches most of its shit from streaming/horriblesubs/torrenting. It also reads most of its manga from illegal sites. This includes your doujinshi aggregate sites like e-hentai.<br><br>This FTA has the massive potential of shutting them all down.</br></br></br>  <br> some random retard can claim copyright on some random doujin <br> no more doujins created <br> no more comiket </br></br></br>  <br>If you even show an anime in your review someone can sue you on their behalf without their permission</br>  <br>If USA and Japan sign this shit, then everything you love will die.</br>  Will we ever get that 2nd season that we deserve?  Yes, it was confirmed for summer next year  <br>You aren't talking about Ben-To here.</br>  <br>never, David Productions is too busy doing Part 4 of Jojo's</br>  <br>What makes you think you deserve it?</br>  <br>There must be something after Jojo.</br>  Not even on the SEGA Saturn's dead body.  <br>You don't deserve shit you self entitled little nigger. When was the last time you paid for anything?</br>  <br>This. fucking Ume-fags.</br>  Dyke annoying bitch  <br>The breasts talked!</br>    <br>I don't see anything wrong with what he said, Ume-sama.</br>  Ume please punish me.      <br>Kyo &gt; Kyo</br>  <br>I don't see how this is still a thing as Kyo is literally perfect unlike Kyo.</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br>Does The World stop time, or speed it and its user up?</br></br>  Why didn't Valentine make a billion Valentines and pile himself ontop of Johnny and Gyro?  <br>It wasn't Valentines Day</br>  <br>Why didn't he bring in other Johnnys and Gyros?</br>  <br>Probably because 99% of the time they would had fought him on sight</br>  <br>This too. His power seemed kind of weak, but at the same time strong. What exactly did he do to Diego when he killed him?</br>  What do tomboys tomboys tomboys tomboys tomboys?  <br><br><br>Does Fukuyose even qualify as a tomboy? She's more a class rep type with big tits.</br></br></br>  <br>This shit is disgusting</br>  <br><br><br>She's basically "big tits comic relief".<br>I don't even have to say how unoriginal that shit is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the desire for a mate who has the empathy and interests that women are naturally incapable of exhibiting, while also satisfying their heterosexual urges. It's a specific fetish that represents something that all men want but can never have. No doubt there are many more examples of this and other desires such as male mother need.</br>  <br>Every girl in Fukou Da - The TV Series is comic relief.</br>  DxD thread!<br><br>BorN BD1 sales are out for the first 4 days.<br><br> Blu Ray - 4,382 <br><br> DVD - 1,188 <br><br> Total: 5,570 <br><br>For 4 days and taking into consideration how BorN was, that's pretty damn good.

She'll impale her wings on the spikes.</br>  <br> LOL you guys will never get a fourth season of this shit...Im sure of it this time!!! <br> DxD BorN v1 sells 4382/1188, total 5,570. Down from 9.0-9.1k for v1wk1s of s1-2. Definitely in for a drop this season. <br><br>I don't think you have much to gloat about this time around</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not reading the rest of the thread <br><br> Dude, first week sales. No one, absolutely no one counts only the first week. Specially when it hasn't even been a full week, but 4 days. Come back in a month and then we'll see, if it's still at 5-6k then and only then will it have dropped. <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br></br>  H-How? How can BONES make something this good? This is totally going against all the expectations. This adaptation has been fucking great so far. <br><br>Or were the expectations too low to begin with?</br></br>  <br><br> HEARTBONER </br></br>  <br>Maybe it has something to do with original material for adaptation?</br>  <br> FMA:B <br>That was terrible.</br></br>  I hope there isn't a lot of drama, I don't think I'd be able to continue watching if there was.  <br>I don't think this is bad, but I guess I'm missing whatever makes people love it so much. It's a bit overly dramatic/hammy for my tastes.</br>  GET IN HOTDOG FORMATION<br>  /ai/ idle activities  </br>  <br>Good job I live in a place where adults and children can still interact and be friends.</br>  <br>Enjoy getting raped in prison pedo</br>  <br>thx bro <br>You just got all of our IPs into a watchlist.</br></br>  <br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-005218</wbr></br>  <br><br>Banter and trolling aside, do you actually think like this?
