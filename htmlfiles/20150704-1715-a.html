It’s not based on an experience right?” <br> “…At the very least, I don’t remember having an experience like that.” <br> “…Ah, it’s fine ~. It’s nothing~. Just my imagination~.” <br> “Katou?” <br><br>Is she in love with Tomoya?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She herself said she wasn't in love with him in volume 7.  Or so Tomoya thinks. </br>  <br><br>But /a/ told me that she was evasive and a liar and that she really is jealous of Eriri.</br></br>  <br>Of course she loves him, silly anon.</br>  <br>Now this is scary</br>  <br>Really most of those things said about her are just assumptions or different interpretations, but she isn't really a liar. It's undeniable that she likes Tomoya and has affection for him. However she seems more concerned about her broken relationship with Eriri, so her jealousy and possible romantic feelings probably have less weight.</br>  <br> However she seems more concerned about her broken relationship with Eriri <br><br>What if she completely botches making up with Eriri and Tomoya is the only one left to comfort her? That might happen next volume.</br></br></br>  <br>Is she really wearing just a shirt? What happened to her pants?</br>  <br><br>She's probably at least wearing panties. She stayed the night.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I would be able to sleep that night</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised, making up with Eriri isn't easy. I guess it would finally be the trigger for her romantic feelings to start flowing.</br>  <br><br>She sleeps in his bed regularly. He probably goes to sleep with her scent still on it.</br></br>  <br>When Utaha said in the epilogue about everyone must understand Eriri, I don't know why but it sounds that they are (Utaha and Eriri) getting cocky for me.</br>  <br>Tomoya is a lucky bastard. I wonder if he at least thinks of taking a peek when she's sleeping or in the bath.</br>  Just came in here to say Utaha a best.<br>Bye.</br>  <br><br>He's too scared of making her angry.</br></br>  <br>Would Megumi react badly if she realized he was doing something perverted?</br>  <br>Not this shit again.</br>  <br>put your trip on ledouche</br>  <br><br>Yes. She doesn't like being seen naked.</br></br>  <br>Because she's pure.</br>  <br>That explains why we barely saw any fanservice of her.</br>  <br><br>That's good.

She doesn't need shameless fanservice to grab the fans' attention.</br>  <br><br>Name a way in which Megumi is not pure.</br></br>  <br>But what caused that scene was Tomoya's rant about her cousin. In a way, he's raising, bringing out the multiple facets Megumi has shown.</br>  How is it possible to have seen the show and not realize how best Utaha is; especially compared to a doll and a cunt.  <br> doll  <br>Wrong show, mister.</br></br>  <br> Megumi is boring <br><br>I love this meme.</br></br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>Utaha turned into a lost cause when she started fawning over Eriri.</br>  <br>It's like your usual 3D girl<br> "You must understand me!" <br>Yet they didn't care about the other side.

She knows that she loved the circle and that she understands Tomoya the most.</br>  <br>No that a slut</br>  <br> Eriri doesn't understand anything <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br>  <br>Utaha x Tomoya is canon.</br>  <br>She's so fucking selfish and self-absorbed it hurts. It takes a girl like her to waste an advantage that practically gives you the victory of the MC bowl served on a silver plate.</br>  <br>Eriri x Tomoya is canon.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Eriri never had a chance with Tomoya as long as she valued being an artist.</br></br>  <br>She could, if only she can be honest since beginning.</br>  <br>i cri</br>  <br>There needs to be more ponytail and long-haired Kato art.</br>  <br>But then she wouldn't be tsundere, thus she wouldn't be a top tier girl.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br><br>Well, they could get together, but they wouldn't last. Eriri needs someone to push her to improve and Tomoya definitely wouldn't be able to provide that.</br></br>  <br>It's the opposite. She would be a top tier girl if she wasn't a tsundere.</br>  <br> watermarks <br><br>Why do people do this.</br></br></br>  <br>Realistically tsundere has the least chance after all.<br><br>It was a huge misunderstanding since beginning. It was something that solveable if both parties decided to talk. But then again, she's tsundere.</br></br></br>  <br> make a top tier design <br> give her a shit tier personality <br><br>Literally why.</br></br></br></br>  Don't remember if I dumped this when vol 4 came out.  <br>Those were delicious tears, but Airi - the better and actually good tsundere - should have won.</br>  <br>Well, that show was literally an advertisement for the PSP game. And it worked incredibly well.

The final result wasn't very good.</br>  Izumi's doujin cover in episode 7.  <br><br>The nice thing is that she makes the good girls stand out even more.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't the PSP game considered bad? I remember someone saying fans of the original VN didn't like it.</br>  <br>Are you sure they weren't talking about the new heroine?</br>  <br>Tomoya had reason to be excited about Izumi's talent and rub it in Eriri's face.</br>  <br>Utahafags, assemble.</br>  <br>I remember it was said in one of those shitstorms about Sana losing because they were baiting people into buying the game.</br>  Winter Day, Fateful Night  https://<span>youtu.be/KT9qkRckGcY  [ ]  <br>I will never get tired of this scene being remade.</br>  I ask of you.

It hit all of the points of Fate and focused on the romance pretty well too.</br>  Say what you will about DEEN, but the Kenji Kawai soundtrack for the movie and 2006 series was fantastic.  <br>You might want to clean your ears out.

TYPE-MOON overdramatic gothic nature captured well in the OST. Kenji Kawai make the score for F/SN TV and UBW movie just feel underwhelming compared to Kajiura's work in KnK and F/Z.  <br>I just listened to and <br><br>It's not bad but it certainly isn't anything to go crazy about. I think Fukasawa's and Kaijura's composing to be a little bit better.</br></br></br>  <br> le ebin reaction pic <br>In other words, you don't know what you're talking about. Thanks for confirming it.</br></br>  <br><br>We need Excalibait and God Bait ASAP</br></br>  <br>I'm a FSNfag, idiot. I want all the routes adapted wholly. I don't give a shit if the boring heroines get sex or kisses, I don't give a fuck about the romantic aspect.<br><br>You, on the other hand, aren't a real FSNfag.</br></br></br>  <br>UBWfags usually are dickish; they'd gladly receive less if it meant they could rub it in someone elses face and say "Route was shit anyway, we got ours, that's good enough".<br><br>Rather this only excites them the most, if they got more and everyone else got less. Even though they were sad and asked for a do-over when they got a lousy movie, they would love it if everyone else was treated the same.<br><br>Really that's what most (insert)fags are like.

DEEN's version of Fate is good enough.</br>  <br>HF bashers have always been Rinfags butthurt their generic tsundere didn't win in the grand finale. This is nothing new.</br>  Is it true Miura is directing again?      <br>I guess it's just a matter of opinion then. The majority of the fanbase seems to like Kenji's music more. I hope he comes back someday.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jLF<wbr>g30ACkY0&amp;index=7&amp;list=RDWJXw0lL5-vA<wbr></wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, keep being so cancerous mate.</br>  <br>I never said anything about ufotable's UBW.<br>It also being bad doesn't make DEEN's adaptation any better.</br></br>   The angle Miura is going for is that F/SN builds on the characters and themes from F/Z, and Shiro as a "hero of justice" is a continuation of everything F/Z was about. He intends to keep the comedy elements in F/SN because they're part of what makes F/SN what it is, but on a whole they want to make a more serious sort of series.   <br>Unfortunately.</br>  <br>Yup.</br>  <br>Based Miura's back, baby.</br>  But the final HF fight needs to happen. It has to be animated. I don't even like F/SN and I want to see it animated!  <br>So UBW faggots (not UBW fans who like all routes) aren't real FSN fans, they just want muh cute tsundere romance and don't care about the story? No wonder UBW threads were cancer and shitposting while Fate/Zero threads were fun.<br><br>They were crammed by nonfans.</br></br></br>  <br> shirous depiction nd characterization was mostly shit <br>How? It was largely the same in the VN as well. It only falls apart a bit in the latter half since the lack monologues catches up with the anime, but ufotable had this problem as well. You cant really avoid it in an animated adaption.<br><br> church basement was a farcry to its original in the VN <br>Yeah, this is the biggest weakness imo.<br><br> and forcing shit from the other routes was retarded <br>Doesn't detract anything from Fate route though.<br><br> these points together make it shit, <br>Uh, sure. Whatever you say.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, that's why he fucked up UBW then.</br>  <br>They will do HF good end.<br><br> MUH MIURA </br></br></br>  <br>I got them all but Baitllerophon was new.</br>  <br>What? Miura's fucking awesome.</br>  <br>its just kirei punching shirou while being prickled by swords, and shirou flailing is arms around</br>  <br>I don't like Miura. I thought UBW adaptation, except for a number of good episodes, was just above average.</br>  <br>Hey, I'm not the Rinfag.</br>  <br>Eh. All we know going by today is that he's probably in charge of the storyboards.</br>  <br>It's by MIURA so expect Shirou and Kirei jumping all around the cave.</br>  <br>It was pretty amazing in the VN but I don't know if it will look good animated.</br>   one movie <br><br>UBW was a flop then? That's probably why they don't have money. Unlike based FZ.</br></br>  <br>If 35K for the first set alone is a flop, then Aniplex doesn't know how to manage their money.</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br> All this fucking autism </br>  <br>pretty floppish when they were aiming for 100k. doesn't look like it has half of the merchandise either.</br>  <br>No, just shitty bait. Nobody can hear shit in that clip, and some Murrikan con doesn't have a shred of credibility to begin with. Until there's official confirmation from TM Ace or such, we don't know shit.</br>    <br>That's fair enough I guess. You can see the routes as different ways to deal with the contradictory nature of Shirou's ideal.<br>And there's nothing inherently wrong with a director messing around with pace or tone, if he still can pull a good story and be true to the source material themes and characters. Problem is, if Boukyaku Rokuon and UBW are any indication, Miura is not capable of doing so.</br></br>   there are people that literally think ufotable will create a 6 hour film and show it in theaters <br>This is a new level of delusion</br>  <br>Miura is one of the worst directors to ever live. Just look at what he did to KnK 6 and the UBW anime.</br>  <br>Miura has highs and lows, notably lows.</br>  <br>The VN itself said it was a shitty fight, just two half dead guys throwing punches at each other.</br>  <br>Yeah huge flop.</br>  <br>They joked about it reaching 100K and making a HA adaptation, but the first set alone was a chart topper for Fall, and they still haven't cashed in for the second set yet.</br>  <br>knk6 was fucking golden. ubw was fucking garbage</br>  <br>More rational than rushing the best and most popular route, at least.</br>  <br>HFfags are the saddest people on /a/ no doubt.</br>  <br> and the UBW anime. <br><br>Made something really good?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you not know what dramatization is?<br><br>oh wait your're just baiting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>most popular is fate.<br><br>i give you best.</br></br></br>   yfw Extra Chapter: Sparks Liner High <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/G9NSQIV15uI  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> most popular route <br><br>Which is why it's never been adapted in 10 years and is only getting one movie.</br></br></br>  <br>HF is ruined even if it gets 10 movies ;_;</br>  <br> Most popular route <br><br>Here, maybe.

Who would have thought?</br></br></br>  <br>And in Fate and UBW she is a wormslut.<br> she's a virgin in RN. <br>Still raped by worms shitter, sorry your waifu is a big slut.</br></br></br>    <br> it was regarded as the worst before people had actually read it <br>In other words, hatred for HF and Sakura is just a forced meme by shitposters.</br></br>  <br> all of the above mentioned are shit </br>  Sakura gets fucked by worms.<br><br>Just think about that for a second, guys.<br><br>Like, we all just take that for granted for a while, but just think.<br><br>Worms. In her vagina.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best route, best representation.<br>Fate should get a decent adaptation though, it might be okay.</br></br>  <br> HF started slowly gaining popularity after translation was finished and people could read it  <br><br>Oh.<br>My.<br>God.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're completely missing the point but that is a factor in the hatred of Sakura at this time yes.</br>  <br> raped by worms <br>It's like saying a electric dildo can rape a person. Is it true? Maybe. The point is it if fucking hilarious.</br></br>  <br>Yes an Electric dildo can rape a person. you shove it in and let it rip.</br>  <br> still raped by worms <br>Good job confirming you haven't read it. They don't even look like penises anymore, so you can't call it rape.</br></br>  <br>Hatred of Sakura is just a common thing because she is a piece of shit and most people agree.</br>  <br>I don't really see a point in doing that now. It's too introductory. A huge part of Fate is introducing the Holy Grail War, how Servants work, who are the 3 great families and so on, things that get expanded in later routes. Not to mention characters who are nonchalantly shunned like Assassin and Archer<br>For a Fate adaptation to be worthwile it would need some heavy reworking. Otherwise, it would fall flat because both Zero and UBW animes have already laid down the groundwork it's Fate Route's job to do in the VN.</br></br>  We could have had a good thread before all this happened.  Stop making fun of Sakura please. It is very rude.  <br> this is what Rinfags really believe </br>  <br>RN follows this.<br>Go figure.</br></br>  <br>So what your saying is there was a demographic that had no access to Heaven's Feel but, had seen the anime about the others. Then when that demographic gained access the popularity increased? Color me surprised, who would've thought that popularity may be decided by exposure and accessibility.</br>  <br> implying rape even makes one a slut to begin with <br> Cue the crossboarder reaction images. </br></br>  <br>So if I disguise my dick I can rape your butthole and you won't lose your anal virginity?</br>  <br>Now you're just asking for it.</br>  <br>Only because you asked nicely.<br><br>After all this time it is still hot</br></br></br>      <br>It follows the LN, actually, where all dialogue regarding it can be interpreted in a way consistent with RN, not the overly edgy manga adaptation.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if F/Z gets retconned soon as well. Nasu has been on a warpath pushing RN as canon for years now.</br>    <br>Don't you mean 7 proxies?</br>  <br>Yes it is anon, years later Sakura's wormrape keeps my dick hard everytime I read F/SN.</br>  <br> Worms taking the form of a slut <br>Spooky.</br></br>    <br>No, because you're a human being. You can't be raped by beings that aren't even similar to humans. Worms crawling inside your body isn't rape, it's torture.</br>  <br> tfw when I'm getting a huge poster of this in the next issue of Young Ace </br>  <br>Nice idea.</br>    <br>What if she loses her hymen in the process?</br>  <br>Get your shitty duckroll neogaf posts the fuck outta here: http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpos<wbr>t.php?p=100098281&amp;postcount=3425</wbr></br>  Threadly reminder that Shinji did nothing wrong.

And TG is overrated and that's the reason it's getting praised all the time.

And he's clearly hung up about it himself. You could say his life is suspended.<br><br>If the theory about Shirazu having a sister whose eyes were scooped out by Tsukiyama turns out to be correct, it seems like this next case might be especially cathartic for him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I?

If you make a claim and can't even back it up, even though, by your own admission, it should be easy to prove, then he has all the right to laugh you off.</br>  I swear if Tsukiyuma doesn't die I'll be mad. There needs to be a notable character death sometime soon in this manga.  <br><br>he needs to be fed to centipede</br></br>  I want tumblr to leave.  <br>Agreed. Kill off tsukiyama and you also kill off the shitty part of tg fanbase with fujoshi fags in it :^)</br>  <br>Killing off fanbasa = Killing off potential manga buyer = Less money = Death of tokyo ghoul</br>  <br>Nah they will keep on buying TG with the hope of seeing their princess's snowflake while Ishida draws Kaneki using Tsukiyama quinque.</br>  <br> baiting this hard <br>10/10 you even got me to reply. Fuck off with your opinions shit head. Why even bother visiting this thread?</br></br>  <br> as if the entire fanbase consists of only thirsty fucks who want tsukiyama' cock up Haise's ass <br>Basically the manga would be more interesting if a main character was killed off and something ACTUALLY tragic happened ex.

There's no emotion, no sadness nor joy, the "life" there is colorless (literally, in the film they're all white) because that's essentially enlightment.<br><br>Kaguya wondered how life on Earth was like after seeing that other woman who sang the song, so then the punishment for that (yes, there is punishment for desiring things in based Buddhism-land) was to send her there and make her experience it first-hand only to take it away. The climax could be interpreted as a metaphor for suicide (after all, what triggers the retrievement in the first place are Kaguya's thoughts of not wanting to live that life anymore) or literally, but it's what gives meaning to the whole film. And it's not quite depressing, rather bitter-sweet once you get the context and understand what the film's idea is.</br></br></br>  is the dub watchable?  <br>Thanks for the post.

This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Is it just projection?<br><br>It's a good series though.</br></br></br></br>  Male characters.<br>Every show with male characters is a fujoshi show, just like every show with female characters is a yuri show, no matter how much non-shippers don't want to accept it.<br><br>You don't need "undertones," you literally just need characters. That's what shipping is about, characters' personalities, not whether or not the series they are in has any romantic or sexual themes at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Because while you and I see Kircheis as Reinhard's bro for life, the fujoshi see him as Reinhard's fucboi. <br>Some people just like gay guys.</br></br>  Handsome men doing handsome things.  <br><br><br>I would of that that fujo's would find it boring, it really isnt the type of show that i would have thought to attract that type of crowd</br></br></br>  <br> shall we try laying a trap </br>  <br>having seen this picture before watching the series, i had a good time watching out and noticing those moments when i was watching it</br>  too bad  <br>True bros fuck eachother though. <br>Haven't you ever had a best friend to give you a cheeky handjob?</br></br>  <br>LoGH might attract less women than men, but it's not like they can't enjoy it once they start watching.

The author does not seem particularly self aware.</br>  Plebs are too retarded to realize that Reinhard ambiguous relationship with Kircheis is supposed to mirror Alexander's relationship with Hephastion. <br><br>That's the only "implied homo" thing in the series.

Any tips on buying figmas and statutes? I really want this one. I know its amiami price so I won't buy if it's too much. I have a family friend here, so communication won't be a problem  <br> it's pricy <br> I'd rather spend nearly double in the aftermarket <br><br>You are aware of how retarded you sound, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> beautiful Alter figure <br> a character from a popular show <br> rather pay aftermarket price <br>anon are you serious?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Buy.<br>Everything.</br></br>  <br>Lucky you, when i was there it felt like i was constantly being scammed, i guess I'm just too paranoid. You can find some gems in Akihabara if you look long enough.</br>  <br>The only problem is the space it takes in your bag. If you really want the boxes home you are going to have some issues.</br>  <br><br>Yeah fuck me I was thinking too short term.</br></br>  Just came in the mail today.<br><br>I bought the Isreal edition, so I did not get an art book or anything, but I'm still content with my purchase.</br></br>  <br>Why didn't you just import B1 poster frames?</br>  <br>I wanted UV protection</br>  <br>can't you just not hang them in the sun?</br>  How exactly do you get amiami to undervalue? I have a first time eurobro friend and I don't want him to get buttfucked but customs.  <br>You don't.</br>  <br><br>You don't. <br><br>You tell him to use USAL/RSAL to avoid customs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that what's causing you to lose sleep?</br>  <br>$40+ is a bit too much for me when I was able to get good &lt;$10 frames for my other posters. The 16x28 size is unusual and that's why I've been having a hard time finding a simple/cheap frame for it.</br>  <br>Uh what?</br>  <br>You can't. Tell him to move to murica where we don't have shitty customs for nippon goods.</br>      <br>fuck off.</br>  <br>Is it just one loser posting this heifer every thread trying to make her a meme or something?</br>  <br>Looks awful.</br>  <br>Every Sal package I've received so far has been busted by customs.

When do release days actually pop up on amiami? The animation ver. Tsugumori rerelease still just says "July 2015"  <br> Being this new </br>  <br>Cool, thanks for the help.</br>  Anyone going to try to get Shinobu V3 or short haired crab?  I've been thinking about buying some doujinshi on surugaya lately, but most of those I want are only available on their kaitori section so I have some doubts. Can anyone share their experiences with buying used stuff on suru? Is it worth it? What's the deal with those low prices? Seems a little bit like a russian roulette with quality of items to me.  <br>This isn't your tech support thread faggot.</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>It literally says "read the guide before asking questions" you sperg. I read the guide and searched through google without finding anything so I'm asking my buyfagging question in the buyfagging thread. Sorry I didn't magically start the hobby with years of experience. Fuck off.</br>  So Amiami sends you a warning before they ban you, right?  <br>No I think they just ban you.<br>What did you do?</br></br>  <br>yes, almost always.</br>  <br>I haven't done anything yet, I'm just thinking of cancelling my Venera, it would be my third cancellation in 2-3 years.</br>  <br>Sell me that Lupin.</br>  <br>He called you new for a reason, dipshit. Actually lurk for a while and you'll see why you can't find exact release dates.</br>  <br>This is so blurry that it's almost SFW.</br>  <br>Then relax, you're not gonna get banned just for that.</br>  <br><br>Thanks. Hopefully Amiko will forgive me then.</br></br>  <br>Dont even bother with retards like him, had he actually googled it properly he wouldnt even need to ask.</br>  <br>Isn't the kaitori section where they buy shit from people so they can resell it? I only ever see the link on sold out listings.<br><br>Most doujinshi with shiny or glossy covers will likely have light scratches on them. Slightly dented corners aren't unusual either. There's a chance for loose binding too. The worst damage I've noticed is a small mark on a glossy cover that looks like something was pressed down and dragged on it. The pages inside are pristine though, and it was only 70 yen.</br></br></br>  <br> When do release days actually pop up on amiami? <br>When there's a release day.</br></br>  Typically speaking, how high are amiami's standards for used items? <br>There's a figure I want that's rated B/B, does this pretty much guarantee cum stains and/or scratches?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127542345 <br>I'm not 12, so no.</br>  <br>Can't be as bad as solaris japan like that anon a few threads ago with that dusty ass "4.5 stars" used item.</br>  <br>I will if I can get shinobu for a reasonable price from mandarake. I don't want her enough to try and get her off y!jp</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127542345 <br>MODS!</br>  <br>B+ is almost guaranteed not to have issues, for B or B- there might be some minor scratches, or tiny paint transfers</br>  <br> lurk through 4 threads of people generic photos of their mass-produced figs just to find the answer to a simple question <br>Literally autism<br><br>"Amiami release dates"<br>"Amiami release info"<br>"Kotobukiya release dates"<br>"when does amiami announce release dates"<br>"when do release dates show up on amiami"<br>Literally no helpful information. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The third wheel arrived.  <br>Way to prove my point, learn how to google faggot.</br>  <br><br>Shit guys it's a joke, this thread is too slow for a friday.</br></br>  <br>The guide tells you to read the stores FAQ's for store specific information. Now try that and go read the guide for real.</br>  I still don't get how people sustain that ALL A/B on Amiami come sealed.  <br>Kaitori section is for selling, not buying. <br>Their doujinshi are pretty much as good as new unless it's stated otherwise. I've bought from them a lot and I can't remember ever being bothered by the state of their stuff. <br>The catch is that they'll ship everything in a huge box so you'll either have to get a service that repacks for free, pay extra for repacking, or pay more than necessary in shipping.</br></br></br>  <br> GSC shipped her yesterday <br> package is already in NY <br> tomorrow is a holiday <br>DAMN IT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for your response.<br>To be honest, I have no idea how their kaitori system works, my japanese is shitty and their faq doesn't provide any decent answers either. <br>Do you by any chance know if they ship stuff from kaitori and normal section together? I'm trying to avoid more handling fees from proxy services.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking people wasting like 10 posts just to shit on the new guy.<br><br>AmiAmi does not post actual release dates. They just put estimates according to what manufacturers give them. So you'll see things like Early-July, Late-July, etc. <br><br>To get a more exact release date, look up the figure at mfc. http://myfigurecollection.net/<br><br>Manufacturers delay stuff all the time so AmiAmi does not give you exact dates.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't expecting the package to come today since I was sure that the holiday was going to hold it up. At least you get the Kero exclusive, I procrastinated and missed the pre-order deadline.</br>  <br>dont worry, the guide is pretty shit and is in dire need of updating.</br>  <br>Nigga, that section is for SELLING. It's confusing because you add items into your cart and everything. This is how it roughly works:<br>-Add items you want to sell<br>-You ship them the items<br>-They pay you for the items<br>In other words, do NOT place an order from that section. Buy only from their normal store.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I almost didn't order her from GSC but then Giant Warrior popped up in their store one night so I pulled the trigger. I do like the Kero that comes with Tomoyo more than the one that comes with Sakura. Just wish Tomoyo had some more parts, like at least alternate legs.</br>  <br>Do you use SAL?</br>  <br>Well, thanks. Shit, it seemed to good to be true.</br>  <br>I know, it happened to me too, and that's how I learned. All the prices were so low and everything I wanted was in stock. It really was too good to be true.</br>  <br>Yeah, no alternate legs is always a disappointment. The cellphone set they had in the show would have made a nice accessory and also given room to display them in separate locations from each other. I would have also liked a worried/surprised faceplate instead of all smiling ones, though they all fit her well and four faceplates is pretty much out of the question. I think GSC could also make some mad dosh producing and selling a few different costumes for Sakura like a nendoroid more set. That's asking for a lot, though.</br>  3 new figs at once. Damn, Satan's box is huge.  Has anyone here had any personal experience with Solarix? I haven't bought from them before but they have a grail of mine for a fairly decent price, but I don't want to get fucked. I can't find her anywhere else.    <br>They are good. I used them twice and my shit comes in perfect.</br>    <br>oh lord no</br>  <br>Awful.  I'm just kidding, anon, enjoy your plastic. Also, nice blanket. <br><br>Now that is awful.</br></br></br>    <br>More variation in faceplates would've been nice, though they're all cute and I do really like the starry-eyed one. I think they could've left out the extra hat for Sakura and included a 4th faceplate and/or something else like those phones you mentioned, and a couple of legs.<br><br>I would totally buy a nendoroid more set of Sakura's costumes. The only downside would be that they haven't been including hair accessories so far.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127545481 <br>Holyshit, FUCK OFF.

The figma are between $50 and $70, Dandy was $90, Kitaro Revoltechs were $30 a piece, and Nadia was $30, but retails for $40.</br></br>  <br>subscribed</br>  <br> I remember when Native made boring sluts that catered to my taste </br>  <br>Did he ask you how much you paid for them faggot?</br>  <br>He acted like they were cheap.</br>  <br>Where did that dog get a fedora?</br>  <br>Their recent figures are a lot less popular than their older ones. I'm not alone.<br><br>If they would just fucking finish the Mahou Shoujo line I would quit bitching. That's their most promising line.</br></br></br>  <br>Reddit, like the person who posted it.</br>  <br>Don't know but it's my favorite fedora image.</br>  <br> The figma are between $50 and $70, Dandy was $90, Kitaro Revoltechs were $30 a piece, and Nadia was $30, but retails for $40. <br>Those are junk.</br></br>  <br>He acted like they were junk.<br>There are plenty of people who will pay top dollar for junk i.e., you..</br></br>  <br><br><br>Resize your shit and correctly align it or fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>you're not fitting in</br>  <br>I think he was posting from the convention</br>  <br>I got OFA for 4k yen and the Movie BD for 5.5k yen.<br><br><br>They're Volumes 1-9 of G4U and the Anime BD.

You'd be hardpressed to find it online, but I think YA might have it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I got OFA for 4k yen and the Movie BD for 5.5k yen. <br>I'm pretty sure thats less than what I paid for them, good shit anon.</br></br>  DHL came by today.  <br>smartphones have image editors you know</br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br>He couldn't contain his excitement, please understand autism-kun.</br>  So guys I'm having trouble deciding. Who goes with monthly shipments? Sounds like looking forward to a goodie box could be fun    <br>Anon pls</br>  <br>Can't do that shit because customs will fuck me up every month. I have to resort to philippine smuggling techniques to be a practical buyfagger.</br>  <br>Does it seem more than a $100 prize fig to you?</br>  <br>This figma looks really gorgeous.</br>  Does big in japan ban people for cancellations?<br>I canceled a preorder last year way in advance and they seemed to be fine with it.<br>I requested a cancellation again just now because I realized it would be more cost effective to preorder from amiami and combine it with two other preorders that are coming that month.</br></br>  <br> Their recent figures are a lot less popular than their older ones. I'm not alone. <br>Bullshit pulled out of your ass.</br></br>  <br>I only ever receive one order a month for new, non-exclusive figures, from AmiAmi.<br><br>Reduces shipping costs and I rarely get dinged for customs.</br></br></br>  Every time I see these outdoor shots on MFC, I wonder how many people were around to see some autist taking pictures of a plastic girl.  <br>Nah. Just going by MFC numbers I am right. I'm not sure anything has been as popular as Cat Lap Milk, which was an interesting original character, and their releases of late do not compare in numbers to their loli figures.<br><br>Not only that but they look like shit. I can see the umbrella slut appealing to some people, but who was elevator slut made for? Especially when they've got things like Yui in the pipeline for 2 years, which will print money if it ever comes out.</br></br></br>  <br>That's actually as good picture. The foot doesn't need to be so deep but great shot because it looks to scale. Normally fags have blades of grass that are as giant as a redwood.</br>  <br>To be honest, nobody probably cares. You're just being too self-conscious.</br>  <br>I think it's cute. Though I wish they'd do it with figures that aren't ugly.</br>  <br>Too bad BRS is shit</br>  <br>I'd think he was a faggot if I saw him and I'm in the hobby so I highly doubt that no one cares.</br>  <br>How much did you find all of G4U for? A small fortune I assume.</br>  <br>Dollfags do it all the time, the important part is to give 0.00 fucks.</br>  <br> caring what others think about you <br>Truly the mark of a beta.</br></br>  <br>Id be too scared of taking my doll out because I wouldn't want to get her dirty.</br>  <br>A two second thought is hardly caring, in my opinion. It's not like you would go home and write an essay about it or tell your parents at the dinner table or anything.<br><br>All it would be is a passing glance, a quick comment in your head, and forget about it and continue with your day.</br></br></br>  <br> not wanting to take a bath together when you get home </br>  <br>Yeah same with all my figures really.<br>It's not worth a good shot for them to get all dirty, I don't have a good camera anyway.</br></br>  Everyday until she's up.  <br>Well, the majority of the people who use that site seem to be european girls so I don't know what people's reaction would be seeing a girl do that.</br>  <br>But anon, she's up right now.</br>  <br>Found the entire set for 35k with tax. Pretty good deal considering some places were selling just the 9th volume alone for 8k.</br>   no Wuxia gunpla <br><br>What is this I dont even?</br></br>  <br>Face is completely fucked.</br>  <br>She isnt though.

Drake. Drake admired his father, Barrels, and dreamed of being a Marine like him. Something happened and Barrels became a pirate and was violent towards Drake. Drake went with him regardless.

He was young, and after he became one of the Shichibukai, and even when he got a severe drubbing from Whitebeard, he put his eyes on the Alabasta Kingdom, where he hunted pirates as a Shichibukai. This article informs about his heroic activities as such."</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Oda gives Nami and Robin large busts because it's the dream of young boys   <br>He never gave up. He just kind of went into the shadows of his operation as a Shichibukai to presumably find Pluton and get revenge against Whitebeard.</br>  <br> pirate hunter </br>  <br>I think this is the only time Wado Ichimonji is ever wielded somewhere other than his mouth.</br>   Buggy can get through Doflamingo's Bird Cage. <br><br>God of pirates indeed</br></br>  Why can't One Piece always have this animation?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=D_Q<wbr>K9tCSVIY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I know, right?

He has used it several times in his hands for ittoryu/nittoryu.</br>  <br> Pica's shoulders have spikes because he wore shoulder pads that were in that shape, much like how a watermelon will become square if kept in a square box while it's growing. <br><br>One Piece human anatomy continues to make no sense at all.

Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  So Bonney is pretty much guaranteed to use her powers on someone important<br><br>Who will it be?<br><br> Law gets turned into a child again, gets carried around all arc once more <br> Captain 'literal' Kid  <br> Adorable baby Cavendish <br> old man Luffy throwing out his back after every attack </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> how dare you criticize Oda <br><br>he isnt above it just because he writes your favorite comic, you know</br></br></br>  <br>Brook</br>  <br>stop posting<br>forever</br></br>  <br>Brook's already immortal so it'd be pointless. <br>Nice quads by the way.</br></br>  <br>getting raised around huge people makes you huge I guess<br><br>or something about monsters being huge</br></br></br>  I wonder how much domestic abuse this relationship would have  <br>probably about as much as it has now</br>  <br><br>I posted some good material in the last thread and I ended up getting banned</br></br>   Episode of Sabo is created before an Episode of Law <br><br>What is this wizardry</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br><br> implying the cage wasn't imbued with haki. </br></br>  <br>Logias can split their bodies to avoid haki, as seen with Kuzan. If Sabo tried going in his regular fire form through the cage and made contact with the strings, it'd slice him up, but if he reformed his flame body into a narrow strip to fit between the wires he'd be able to get through.</br>  <br>The Gorosei return to their prime.<br><br>Also,  Bonney is Akainu's daughter who is eight, but uses her devil fruit to look older. Hence why she acts like a brat. </br></br></br>  Now that Doflamingo is all wrapped up for Level 6... Will we see him again?  <br>I want the Strawhat pirates to merge with the Heart pirates, but that's impossible. Since Law has to go back to his darling crew, can the StrawHeart alliance go on forever? Or can the Hearts be the first... what do you call that... Strawhat division? Or something? Seems unlikely, but still...</br>  <br>Never said anything about criticizing him. You just said his answer was stupid because there were counterexamples in his own story. And I just said maybe it's because that SBS answer wasn't really all that serious to begin with.</br>  <br>well first they have to get him there</br>  <br>Will Bonney's powers work on Sugar??</br>  <br>doesnt make his answer less dumb</br>  <br>i agree. doesn't make you less dumb for taking it more seriously than his other dumb answers for most of his SBS questions either.</br>   not knowing if senor wife is still alive.   <br>you know we're working under the assumption that it may not be a joke, right? And that im criticizing how lazy he is?</br>  <br> you know we're working under the assumption that it may not be a joke, right? <br> we're <br>I'm not. You are. That's why I'm saying you're dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>alive or not, it doesn't make a difference</br>   Pica's shoulders have spikes because he wore shoulder pads that were in that shape, much like how a watermelon will become square if kept in a square box while it's growing. <br>Fucking Oda</br>  <br>you're saying im dumb for reading this and having an opinion <br><br>like it isnt justified because he plays it off as a joke. I don't see how its dumb to criticize this man's motivations</br></br></br>  <br>Does a coma count as alive?</br>  <br>No it makes a lot of difference, seeing as if she's still alive oda could always bring the bitch mind back via power while if she's dead that's it for her. Like I like senor so I hope he had some type of happiness come his way</br>  <br> mom dies <br>Go on adventure. Fullmetal Alchemist used this concept.<br><br>Rurouni Kenshin used this concept.<br>Oda listed a platitude not spoke nonsense.<br>As far back as Homer, you need a woman to cause the start of a journey. Since Oda decided no romance, he built a straw hat crew of people who never met their blood mom.<br>It is strongly implied Luffy's is dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's dead along with Gimlett. Senor even inferred it.</br>  <br>Well she was able to smile, so that could of been a hint at her recovering and She probably could of recovered via DF</br>  <br>Well I've learned with mangas unless you get a ace or jairaiya type death then the person of concern may never truly be dead. (Ex:sabo and obito) so he could just be talking about her being brain dead</br>  <br>It's lazy writing though<br><br>he could have made his own story instead of falling back on archetypes and very easily not killed them off</br></br></br>  <br> It is strongly implied Luffy's is dead. <br><br>It's also strongly implied that since Dragon is a serious guy he took his carefree attitude from his mother.</br></br></br>  <br>because the post I replied to was you calling his statement dumb because there were adventurous mom's that he killed off. <br> Because [Mom] is the opposite of [Adventure] ! Don't write that on your test! <br> That's dumb because he killed off mom's that were adventurous! It doesn't hold up! <br>It's like you think his SBS answers are some set in stone rules he follows or some shit. You're taking it too seriously. It seemed to be a pretty obvious shit-tier joke that he usually spouts in these things. <br><br> like it isnt justified because he plays it off as a joke. I don't see how its dumb to criticize this man's motivations <br>I honestly don't even know what you're trying to get on about here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dick no longer functional <br> but ass is <br><br>well I guess he can still have SOME fun</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's lazy writing though.  <br>Why is killing off mom's lazy writing though. He just likes to do it a lot. Who gives a shit. Why are you so offended? If he killed off more dads than moms instead, would you consider that lazy writing too? or no because it's less conventional to do that? What's the point of that? Young kids usually have more emotional connections with their moms. Killing off moms could just be more impactful.</br></br>  <br>saying that because it's a joke, it's dumb to criticize is pretty dumb itself<br><br>the man is supposed to be a professional so he isnt above being criticized for the shit that comes out of his mouth<br><br>of all the ways he could have answered, he goes 'because moms lol'<br><br>That's dumb and he deserves to be called dumb for it; whether as a joke or as a lack of foresight.<br><br>I'm not writing my dissertation on this. I'm literally saying, 'Wow that's a stupid thing to say' and leaving it at that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Slams him not on his back. <br>Based.<br><br>Unrelated:<br>It took Haki and Gear 4 to defeat these animals who don't even have haki.<br>Kaido is the strongest animal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shakespeare and Homer didn't invent their archetypes either. Homer wrote told story. Shakespeare wrote his story into existing ones.</br>  <br> Why is killing off mom's lazy writing though. <br><br>because it's been done a billion times already and is only done for cheap feels. He COULD actually make a more complex story around a parents death but just choices not to. And he can do that but such a flippant answer makes him look like a lazy hack</br></br></br>  <br>what is your point?</br>  <br>Okay? And my answer to you was  . I wasn't asking for a dissertation about your reasoning. I already know you were calling him lazy/dumb for making a joke answer to an SBS question of all things. And I was just stating that it's dumb. Now you're calling me dumb for calling you dumb for calling the answer dumb. Full circle.
