That would be beyond terrifying  <br>That scene gave me the biggest erection.</br>  I sometimes wonder why I bother living when fictional characters can have better lives than me.  Everyday I wake up before dawn and a single tear streams down my face as I realize I don't have to rush into my butler outfit, cook breakfast and greet my ojou-sama as she awakens.

I'm surprised Vega Tale is still even alive. What's the point of his existence anymore? He might as well be Yamcha at this point</br>  Cell can.  Yamcha can.  <br><br> Yamcha is actually a Saiyan <br> all the times he's been defeated has actually made him the potentially strongest Saiyan but he's never figured out how to train properly </br></br></br>  <br>I know, it's almost like DBZ is an anime.</br>  <br>That's why I said sudden you smartass , theres like 8 DBZ or DBZ related threads up right now.</br>  Who is Whis?  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Explain yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Careful if you say things like that its gonna be time.</br></br>    <br>Just saying that even yaharifags contain themselves.</br>  <br>Even Narutofags contain themselves.

Those threads just die in a few hours, really no different from the bait and shitposting we already had. <br><br>You know that you can just block them if they annoy you right?</br></br></br>  <br>and people can create generals as well.</br>  <br>Its not really annoying or anything , it just makes a lot of clutter of dead threads in the catalog , making a general would be a great since it provides more discussion and less clutter.</br>  <br>/a/ would sadden me if I didnt see at least 3 DB threads</br>  <br>There are people who gets annoyed when they see 10 different threads about the same topic.</br>  <br>Vegitto is like SSJ 4 transformation. It's already above SSJ 3 but far below SSJ 4. Vegitto transformation is not ki consuming like other SSJ transformation the same reason why SSJ 4 is more of permanent transformation and rarely have limited time. So they can be at that state in very-very long time or near permanent as long as they're not unconscious.</br>  <br>They can suck a boner</br>  <br>You should go somewhere else. /a/ isn't for you.</br>  <br>Wah, this thread isn't about softcore porn and moeblobs, I better throw a tantrum, that'll show em</br>  <br>Ok, quote the part of my post where I said that. Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Maybe you should because there always three up moeblob</br>  <br>Logic says that since Goku has the knowledge to perform the transformation then so should Vegito.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  That lightsaber move is cool as tits.  He Cant even die. He can literally just leave crumb size pieces of his body somewhere and regenerate from that in a few seconds. Punches don't work, energy blasts blast through him and he is like "whatever". Even the biggest spirit bomb in the series almost failed.  <br>The problem with Buu is that he was literally just a retreading of Cell.<br><br> he can regenerate! <br> he knows our attacks! <br> he absorbs people! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Cell was clearly getting hurt and tired as he fought. Buu on the other hand is complete bullshit since nothing even damages him unless it literally destroys every cell in his body all at once.</br>   Buu on the other hand is complete bullshit since nothing even damages him unless it literally destroys every cell in his body all at once. <br><br>Just like Cell. And my point wasn't really about power it was more how buu wass cell: pink edition.</br></br>    <br>Buu is more like an improved Cell. Cell cant absorb people as he pleases, he had a powerlevel cap which he hit absorbing the androids, while Boo absorb powers are limitless. And Cell actually can take blows unlike Buu which ends up absorbing the blows too with his elastic body.<br><br>Anyways the real enemies in DB are the saiyans, if they could stop beeing self centered assholes and protect the earth as they should they could have avoided the births of Cell and Boo to begin with. Maybe even Freeza, without the Namek battle, eventually Vegeta could have achieved SS to slap Freeza's shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Buu can actually reform from atomic particles. No cells needed. If Buu is even made of cells like a normal thing.</br>  <br> Could Vegito reach Super Saiyan 3 <br>In my country, it was translated that he's Super Saiyan 10</br></br>  Demonbane is the strongest DBZ character. Demonbane is the strongest everything.<br><br>Demonbane is love, Demonbane is life</br></br>  <br>Dandy already defeated Demonbane in an infinite number of universes.</br>  <br>How exactly?</br>  <br>Because Dandy exists in a Universe of every possibility, and in the universes Dandy loses to demonbane his mind just changes universes.</br>  No because Vegeta cant  <br> Saiyains being anything more than a proud warrior race.  <br><br>The mere thought is blasphemous.</br></br></br>    <br>Vegeta is weak anyway he cannot goes SSJ3 when trunks and gotenks can. So in multiplier coefficient vegeta is much weaker than gotenks and trunks.</br>  <br>Why goku is combine with vegeta. goten and trunks are muchstronger. They can go ssj 3 while vegeta only can reach SSJ 2 at most.</br>  <br><br><br>This thread got real Brazilian real quick.</br></br></br>  <br>Right back at you african nigger faggot.</br>  <br><br>Are you coming onto me?</br></br>  <br>Are you a racist white pig?</br>  <br><br>I'll be whatever you want me to be</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Good for you then Now you can go back to your cage.</br>  <br>Only if you come in here with me and throw away the key.<br><br>The suns coming up but that don't mean the fun's gotta stop.</br></br></br>  <br>Source? That's too fucking powerful. <br><br>I don't give a fuck, that must be Beerus level</br></br></br>  <br>  implying SSJ 3 fusion is strong <br>Just look how weak is gotenks.</br></br>  <br>Gogeta can probably defeat beerus too. He is not yet face any goku fusion related until now.</br>  <br>Neither kid had reached SSJ3 alone, and they were the dance fusion. Potara is stronger, Vegeta and Goku are stronger, and Goku has already mastered SSJ3.<br><br>Doesn't compare.</br></br></br>  <br>  asumption <br>It's just your asumption without proof. IN FACT There is no difference betwen going SSJ 3 in fusion or in normal state.</br></br>  <br>Post the assumption in my post.<br><br>Dance fusion drains Ki, hence the time limit. Potara multiplies both users energy while creating greater endurance. The Kais imply they could stay in SSJ3 indefinitely as Vegito, they'd just be shaving a few years off their life due to the immense pressure. That's far stronger than only keeping up the form for a few minutes.</br></br></br>  <br> Post the assumption in my post. <br>All your post is assumption!<br> The Kais imply they could stay in SSJ3 indefinitely as Vegito <br>Source and Wat?<br><br>Vegitto power level is just in your fanfic. Actually pottara user is infact is weak. looked how weak is kaioshin even with pottara earring. Pottara power in your post is just merely fanfiction because in fact the power is not strong. look how buu can dispell pottara earring and goku has not yet won again buu even under veggito. The earring is overrated because none of the user yet proved to be powerful. And the power of the earring is in fact is weak because it can EASILLY dispelled by buu power.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>one advantage cell has it that he has the hax sayian ability of getting stronger every time you almost die. and since he can regenerate from a single cell, its a pretty OP ability for the most part.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because there's a new Dragon Ball anime out?</br>  <br>  cannot use genki dama again <br>I don't think vegitto is a best move since he cannot use his strongest attack and the strongest attack in all dbz warrior. There is no attack that known can kill buu ultra regeneration and many other main villains regeneration except genki dama.</br></br>  <br>Probably, but at this point it would be better to go Super Cyan since both halves know it and it's most likely stronger than SSJ3</br>  <br>Trunks and Goten can't go SSJ3, but Gotenks can.</br>  <br>You can't be that stupid</br>  <br>There is no single proof that both goten or trunks cannot go ssj 3. and there is no proof that the fusion can change your level even 1 level higher than the state of the fusioner.</br>  Can two fused people fuse? Like, can Gogeta and Gotenks fuse to make Gogetanks?  <br>  stupid answer <br>You cannot be that idiot. fuck off newfag.</br></br>  Whose idea was it to design the most powerful being in the known universe as a flaming gay man?  <br>it cannot. fusion also cannot be done when they're not in sync both power level and dance. The height also will be a problem sync it will make the dance harder.</br>  <br> implying vegito wont reach SSJG at some point in super </br>  <br>  sync <br> since it will make the dance harder to be synchronized. </br></br>  Bernkastel can easily destroy DBZ for fun  <br>Everything you said is so off that I simply feel sorry for you to be that retarded. Go educate yourself, summer fag</br>  <br> cannot bring any proof <br>Go away idiot newfag. Your idiocy in this thread has made me cry. Go cry a river somewhere and bring your BULLSHIT! fanfic with you.</br></br>  <br>  crying because nobody believe his fanfic theory </br>  <br><br>Because we're not allowed to make Naruto threads.</br></br>  <br> He had a powerlevel cap which he hit absorbing the androids <br>Super Perfect Cell says otherwise.</br></br>  So I just started DB: Super and decided to also watch the movies that came out before it, regardless of whether they'll be canon or not.<br><br>Finished Battle of Gods but am having trouble finding a torrent for Resurrection F. Am I missing something? I thought it has been out for a while now.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about all that, but  Vegeta is undefeated against Goku .</br>    so bog isn't canon anymore because super overrides it right?  <br> actually pottara user is infact is weak. looked how weak is kaioshin even with pottara earring.  <br>Two weak gods fuse and are still weak. What a suprise<br> look how buu can dispell pottara earring <br>Buu had no idea that they would defuse inside of him. He ate them as last thing he could do against Vegito.<br> and goku has not yet won again buu even under veggito <br>He did not want to kill Buu as Piccolo, Gohan and kids were still inside of him<br> The earring is overrated because none of the user yet proved to be powerful. <br>I don't even, are you that stupid?<br> and the power of the earring is in fact is weak because it can EASILLY dispelled by buu power. <br>And again, you are wrong. By eating someone way stronger than Buu, you mean easilly? He ate Veggito only becouse he had to rescue z fighters inside of Buu, nothing else.<br><br>I know that this is bait, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup. It's weird also because super takes place 6 month yes some years in the future where BoG takes place videl has not gave birth to pan.</br>  <br>BoG was never canon in the first place. Super actually has a right to that claim (with the manga by AT even if he isn't drawing it). RoF is next on the list of shit to be 'retconned' (while not being canon to begin with).</br>    <br><br><br>Are you both stupid?<br><br>Videl has not given birth to Pan yet. Not in Battle of Gods, nor in Super.<br><br>Let's say she got pregnant after Z (after the fight with Boo she and Gohan got sexytime). Less than 9 months have passed until Resurrection of Frieza since Pan is not born.<br><br>That epilogue from DBZ is years down the line. I think 3 or 4 years after Z?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, up until Super both new movies were canon. It's just that they eventually decided a new series would bring better profits and now we have Super.</br>  <br>  assumption <br> IN FACT he cannot defeat buu. <br>  IN FACT the earring is dispelled instantlyinside boo's body. he doesn't even try <br>  IN FACT kaioshiin pwer level is thousands times stronger than frieza <br>  IN FACT kibito has superior skill in speed and healing ability than Goku  <br>And yet he still a weakling!<br>Are you idiot?<br>Bringing you masturbation fanfic theories won't bring you far, idiot newfag.<br><br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SSJ3 is easy for fusions.</br>  <br>You're dumb. BoG was written by another in a Toei film set in the anime continuity. AT's rewrite was only ever advisory in nature. This is the real deal. RoF had some room for arugment, BoG didn't. Super is a clear case (not the anime though).<br><br><br>And you're dumber. What are you prattling on about, boy? None of that addresses the most important question of all.  When will Vegeta beat Goku again for 3-0 ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>and shit for everyone else</br>  <br>AT completely rewrote most of it to serve his own intentions, so what the original writer did hardly matters. The only thing left over was god of destruction vs super saiyan god. Unless you think Super isn't canon because AT is still using that writer's ideas.</br>  <br>The Super manga is an abridged adaptation of the anime story, so it's not canon if that's what you're implying.</br>  <br><br>You won. Your stuppidy is overhelming. It's like talking to wall.</br></br>  <br> most <br>Not his story. Not his characters. Not even his final say.<br><br> Super <br>Entirely his take on things (as already noted). He can do with it as he pleases (as seen in the manga thus far).<br><br><br> blue hair Bulma <br> five finger Pickle Man <br>Anime-continuity is not canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only 3 of those are Dragon ball threads, the others are just using DB picture.</br>  <br>The epilogue is 10 years after Buu. Pan is 4 years old and Uub is 10 years old during it.</br>  <br>I honestly think Toriyama is a faggot<br><br> Magna with 99% shredded men fighting each other as their clothes gets destroyed through every battle. <br> Zero relevant female characters <br> Always a fucking gay guy added, in every. fucking. arc. <br> Whis is the most powerful being in the universe by leaps and bounds <br> Cant write female characters to save his fucking life. <br><br>I love Dragon Ball but hes fucking gay man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The writer wanted beerus to be a completely evil lizard-man and the character designer wanted SSG to be like a sort of mix between SS3 and SS4. AT got his way on both fronts. In the end, it was a collaborative effort, but AT's push was far greater than anyone else.<br><br>Then nothing about it is canon. I don't think AT has anything to do with the manga. He's writing the scripts for the anime, and it's likely the manga writer gets the same scripts and does his more abridged version.</br></br></br>  <br>  cannot into math <br>Are you stupid?<br>It's stated that BoG film takes place several YEARS after kid buu defeat. it takes more than 3 years after the even of super to be precise. so in three years the baby should have been born.</br></br></br>  <br>Explain carefully why, in the movie, Beerus wakes up from a 40 year long nap, dreaming about a Super Sayain God, and immediately undertakes a trip to locate it, going first to King Kai's world, then Earth.<br><br>While in Super, he spends the first episode already awake, out in space, eating space cuisine made by space chefs, and then blowing up half their planet.<br><br>The facts don't add up mate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stuppidy <br>Right back at you, stupid newfag.</br></br>  <br> Toriyama called Battle of Gods a continuation of the manga <br> Called Resurrection F a sequel to Battle of Gods <br> Gave tbe idea for the cartoon of Dragon Ball Super, upon which the comic is an adaptation <br> You're still tryung to say that the movies are non canon and that Toyotaro's comic is canon <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good you admit defeat. Forcing your masturbation theory with your delusion fact won't get you anywhere and going nowhere.</br>  <br>But Whis and Beerus are canon now, and they are stronger than Vegetto</br>  <br>It's retconned by super and become non canon or filler now.</br>  <br>Sounds like the first episode of super takes place after he wakes up, but before her gets to Earth / King Kai's place. Maybe he got hungry on the way?</br>  <br>If he is already full why in the heck he still feeling hungry on earth like a starvation person and being edgy revengefull bitch because of food.</br>  <br>It's completely different and disconnected from the movie.</br>  <br>He's really REALLY hungry? I mean, the Buu saga did happen. Let's not pretend Toriyama is Shaskespear or some shit.</br>  <br>Retards don't know how to use a catalog. Dragon Ball needs to be purged and blacklisted on the same level as Narutards</br>  <br><br>The dialog in movies told otherwise and whis transformation skill said to be the fastes on universe. I think beerus has no time changing his mind in faster teleportation skill than goku's instant transmission. The speed literally instant. he logic doesn't add up. You're day dreaming.</br></br>  <br> AT gets say in another guy's script <br>Not his story. Super is.<br><br> in the end it wasn't AT's story <br>Good chat.<br><br><br>BoG didn't happen.<br><br><br> AT said <br>AT says a lot of things. Know what he never says? That something is canon. BoG wasn't his story. He has now made it his own with Super.<br><br> tbe <br> tryung <br>You what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With Potara, probably. The difference in heights would prove an obstacle to the fusion dance though</br>  <br>The fact that he jumped into it half-way does not negate that he made it his own while still using the base elements. He's still currently using those elements and has based the entire start of the series around them, so it's sort of silly to harp on that. It was completely canon until Super and would have remained so had they continued doing movies.</br>  <br>but then theyd be weak so no reason do that</br>  <br>The dvd/bluray for RoF doesn't drop until October. There won't be any good encodes or subs for the movie until then. However, the movie premieres English dubbed in US theaters next week.</br>  <br>Really- really hungry but stop eating before get full? when he is act like a spoiled god that want his wish granted even the wish is illogical and forced other to believe his delusion and dream. he literally forcefull against stupid things but choosing to become desireless on his needs and hobby on eating.</br>  <br> does not negate that <br>It was another person's story (and remains theirs)? Super is AT's take (and canon).<br><br> canon until <br>It was never canon. Super has taken that movie trash and made it canon trash. Rejoice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's neither here or there, Anon was asking whether it was possible, which it is.</br>  <br>You have a silly definition of canon then. The movies were canon as according to AT half-writing one and fully writing the next. The anime is now canon due to his writing superseding the movies.. That's it.</br>  <br>no its never shown possible and FACT is that its weak so cant be done... stop your fanfic newfag</br>  <br>I think it's interesting that with the inclusionary SJW enviornment we have in America nowadays, Toriyama managed to drop tons of gay characters all over his manga, and it never felt forced, and it was never treated like a special thing. It's kind of hard to find in other shows, all portrayals of homo characters are either yuribait or fujoshi bait in Japan, or sjw pandering in America.</br>  <br> It was another person's story (and remains theirs)? Super is AT's take (and canon). <br><br>AT has a less active role in Super than in the movies though, which is why we're getting filler characters in Super. <br><br>He just made the plot outline for Super, while with the movies he was either tweaking the final script itself (BoGs) or actually writing the script (RoF).<br><br><br> AT says a lot of things. Know what he never says? That something is canon.  <br>He said that he saw it like making a new story for the manga, that's the closest thing you can get to "canon".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In rof has much more filler than super now. Jaco and some random shits.

Either of an existing series, or with original characters.<br> This is not a request for free manga. Just curious. </br>  <br>Because a lot of them have become viciously protective of their waifus, and attack both anyone else who requests them and any artists who dare to draw them.

Angle and pose is up to the artist.  When does the Waifu thread "end"? Tonight?  <br>Yeah, depending on who's been delivered it can end early tonight or early monday. Why do you ask?</br>  <br>Because these threads are practically dead until then and I like these threads.</br>  <br>Yeah the general is normally pretty cool. I would try to avoid it monday though, if there's drama from the WWD the day before its gonna be awful. This weekend has been calm surprisingly so I think this time it might be alright.</br>  <br>The weekend was pretty chill actually.</br>  <br>Yeah, some pretty awesome drawfriends really made a difference.

The fuck is an Oora?</br>  <br>Wow.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128632257 <br>Whether he was aware of it or not they weren't going to come in to save him from the shitposting.<br><br>Honestly I just wish they would keep their stuff to themselves, we could have more weekends like this is that was the case. <br><br>I saw someone mention they have something going in the IRC but they never involve their antics in the thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can I get a pregnant Tsugumi in a white dress having Raku's head on her lap listening to the baby  <br><br> no Immortan Joe and his Warboys collage </br></br>  <br><br> Immortan Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Fund it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You won't get hate unless you're a faggot though.</br>  <br>Maybe he was ban evading, but that still doesn't mean it was because of drawthread drama.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Why isn't this a thing? Take my money please.</br></br>  <br>This thing</br>  <br> tfw was witnessed this weekend by my small group of warboys <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br> and anyone who knows anything knows mass delivery recipients are more victims than greedy cunts. <br>no, the only "victims" were the ones that acted like greedy cunts after the fact</br></br>    <br>Nice!

If it had been done like Season 1, sighs would have been summed in 3 to 4 episodes, not a full 6. The only good thing about sighs was a slight indication of Itsuki's mysterious past.<br><br>The movie redeems the failures of Season 2, but it was too much too late. Everyone moved to Madoka.<br><br>...the only good thing si that Madoka has not had new content since 2013, while a mediocre series keeps Haruhi 'current'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Personal opinion: Endless Eight is ok, it gives an small glimpse of what Nagato felt during all the bucles.</br>  <br>The problem is, Endless Eight is what will put laymen off the anime.<br><br>I think thats my chief problem/concern with Haruhi in its current form. When Haruhi Season 1 came out, it garnered attention for attraction not only anime fans and moe fans, but also non-anime fans who liked the show. But as season 2 went on, and with it, Haruhichan, it sort of cemented the series's ties with otaku culture, which ostracized it. The yukichans eries isn't that different from your typical boring slice-of-life anime.<br><br>The series needs something vitalizing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From what i see the second season did a purge of undesirables fans.</br>  <br>And from what I see the second season made the series a lot less interesting to other fans. You say they're undesirable, I say its what made the series relatable.<br><br>Its like something was lost when KyoAni pulled off the stunt that was Endless Eight.</br></br></br>  <br>And whos call was to animate endless eight, Tanigawa's? or KyoAni. if its tanigawa's <br>but if is KyoAni's, i dont know what they were thinking.</br></br>  Are you making me dump my Haruhisky folder again??  <br>Well, in answer to your question:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tqy<wbr>8x-zKuKw&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=SG</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>        Read the guide.<br>buyfag.moe</br>  Still can't believe this got picked up.

It's there so that when idiots like yourself repeatedly ask stupid fucking questions we can just direct them to it rather than putting up with their shit.<br><br>You'd know this if you'd read it.</br></br></br>  is influencing someone by viraling him something to buy and then he buys it and got into trouble is a sin??  <br>Judging by the tail, this is Nana right?</br>  <br>Is this the new figure of the year 2015?</br>  I know it's /v/ shit. But are there any decent even "bootleg" figures out there of League girls?<br>Cap Fortune makes me wet.</br>  <br>Why are you asking here when you know that it's /v shit?</br>  <br>Because most of /v/ are kids with no disposable income and probably eBay for everything if anything.</br>  <br>You mean you don't like their official merch?</br>  <br>Sucks to be you, guy.<br>I'm getting it fo' sho'.</br></br>  <br> official western merch. </br>  <br>Looks like an authentic British woman to me.</br>  Enjoy the twenty-seventh of July.  SOON  Are companies who give the garage kit license at Wonfes told if the garage kit sold out or not to scope out potential interest?  <br>There was a guy who had some of the bootlegs you see on ebay, they looked pretty decent. Not sure if there's one of MF, though.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the sellers always put signs up when they're sold out, and pretty much all good GKs get sold out because of the limited quantities.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Thanks, doc.</br>  Possibly the worst Wonfes in history.  <br>Yeah yeah, so was the last one and the one before that, we get it. Don't worry, next year's will be worse than this one anyway.</br>  <br>Wait, that shit isn't even released yet, how are there figs?</br>  <br>It's a fucking Google Docs file, promoting it doesn't generate any revenue for anyone.</br>  <br>Fucking Griffon-level.</br>  my kingdom for a severa nendo<br><br>or any severa merchandise at all</br></br>  <br>Anon, let him wallow in his delusions.

There's usually only one or two things I want, tops, most of which are often updates on pre-announced items. This year showed two new things and updates on two more all of which fit into that category. Yuzuhura alone makes this the best one in ages for me, she's actually been a grail-tier announcement since the last Muramasas came out.</br>  <br>that looks terrible except for the wings</br>  <br>Kusuriuri truly surprised me. I can't fucking wait for colour.</br>  <br> 3/4 is videogames <br>You should be able to understand.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>It's pretty damn good so far... not sure what there is to complain about.</br>  What show is this based off of?  <br>More like /v/anillaware</br>  <br>It was pretty good for me.</br>  <br>But even Alter had something overtly sexy for once.</br>  <br> For me this year was quality over quantity. There are only a couple things I'm looking forward to but they look great.</br>  Will she be delayed again?  <br>It looks like some weird combo of KanColle, SW and SnK.</br>   Yo Dawg, I heard you REALLY REALLY like Fubuki, so we put your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki, so you can Fubuki your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki while your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki with your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki can Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki on your Fubuki, Dawg   <br>If not wrong.
