[ What the fuck did I just watch?    <br>SPOILER<br>the club members are dead too</br></br>  At first I was all...  But then I serious'd the fuck up.    <br>Cute girls doing cute things.</br>    <br>Is this the new Madoka?</br>  <br>For what purpose.</br>  <br><br>Those aren't even the same person. Also nice 10 year old meme.</br></br>  I think the scene loses impact and doesn't look as good as it was in black and white  <br>Nope. This is actually good.</br>    <br>a comfy high school SoL with cute girls doing cute things</br>    <br> believing /a/ </br>  <br>I thought I was watching a cute SoL.<br>I just don't understand.</br></br>  <br><br>plot tweest: they all zombies now and they ate the school. kowaii desu ne!</br></br>  <br>Twist within a twist: the entire anime is a zombie's nightmare.</br>  <br>We need to go deeper.</br>  <br>Plot twist: Zombies are humans.</br>  Swimming pool episode fucking when?  <br>Typical moeshit.</br>  So why are they enabling this retarded girl's delusions? Seems like a lot of effort to keep it up when there's more important shit to worry about.  <br>urobuchi pls go and stay go</br>  <br>So they don't go crazy.</br>  <br>Don't you watch the news? Delusion-enabling is mainstream these days. See: Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner. <br><br>I bet some of you guys didn't realize that Gakkou Gurashi was /pol/-related too.</br></br></br>  <br>Cutest girl of the season</br>  <br>Because her retardation/moe lowers the stress of living in a post apocalyptic zombie land.</br>  <br>Because they're her friends</br>  <br>They play in a river once.</br>  <br>Having a pet helps with high anxiety</br>  <br> Kurumi doesn't get cold because she's half dead </br>  <br>You, sir, have just witnessed a true masterpiece.<br>Isn't this just a run-off-the-mill zombie anime with cute girls? That might seem true at first glance, but allow me to explain what the story really is about.<br><br>We have a bunch of girls helping out eachother, trying their best to survive in a schoolhouse after a zombie invasion. Wait a moment! This is just like a real Japanese school. The students are like zombies, doing what they are supposed to do. They even pressure other students to do as they do, just like zombies convert their victims. Our brave girls are not flinched by the zombies/peer pressure, and keep on living, doing what they truly want.<br>What's the significance of Yuki's PTSD? It shows that even if you stay yourself, and don't become a brainless zombie like everyone else, school will still take a serious mental toll on you.<br>Having just seen the first episode, I am still flabbergasted by the deepness of the plot, and I can barely wait for next weeks episode!</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Not as strong without the music.</br>  Why is Miki already here. Why is the dog their club pet now  <br> http://www.dm5.com/m208794/#ipg1 <br> Chink translations are out <br><br>Will they get rape by mad max chunnis?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or without showing the fashionable collar afterwards</br>  <br>If the doge is as dead as in the manga, the doge might be a lie too.</br>  <br>it heals the soul</br>  <br>CatHat without the hat is literal sex.</br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>It's a fucking choker!</br>  <br>deepest lore</br>  <br>lmfao people actually believe this</br>  <br>My guess is to make the plot roll faster since the mall would take time.They'll probably kill the dog in the next episode or have him turn at the end and use it as a device to mess with Yuki and Kurumi.<br><br>I'm more concerned how they'll deal with Megu-ne's death. Also if the rumors that they want it to end by graduation if they'll have enough time. If they've cut out Miki's introduction they're just going to be spending a lot of time at school.</br></br></br>   cute girls doing cute things during a zombie apocalypse <br><br>Proof that nipponese directors get their anime ideas from /a/</br></br>  <br>Won't happen unless we get an S2 though.</br>  <br>When did this happen?<br>Chapter please.</br></br>  <br>ch 28</br>  <br>I beg to differ. I actually prefer anime reveal to the manga one.</br>  <br>Nah, I liked it better in the anime. The music box song and having another character there to watch her be crazy added to it for me.</br>  <br>I didn't feel like I had seen that other image... this one I remember.<br><br>I still don't understand,<br> Why can she still see Megu-nee even though she's ready to face reality? </br></br></br></br>  I'm confused.  Is Yuki blind to these zombies or not? Does she know about the zombie apocalypse and know that there are very few people still alive? In the manga when she was cleaning up a classroom, she saw a zombie and killed it I think. So of course she knows the current situation they're in, right? But it looks like she still thinks life is normal.    <br>She's only pretending to be retarded, but she's pretending so hard she even has herself tricked for the most part.</br>  Would you guys rather let Yuki comfort you or comfort Yuki during a breakdown?  <br><br> She's slowly recovering. Subconciously I think she's always understood the gravity of the situation. <br> Meanwhile Rii-san's contracting "the crazy". </br></br></br>  <br>I'd comfort her with my dick, and I'd let her comfort my dick.</br>  <br> No, she gave up after killing a zombie. <br> It's just that she really IS kind of stupid and whimsical in spite of being the most heroic of the mall, so it's not that big of a shift. </br></br>  <br>She's crazy until something breaks her illusion but seems to understand somethings off but just pretends like it isnt. She was ready to go out and save shovel and miikun after the helicopter incident and took the glow sticks and a bat, two things she clearly wouldn't have done if she truely believed there was no danger.</br>  <br>We don't know if they're really "gone," though. Could be that after realising what was happening she just rejected the truth again.<br><br>It's obviously had some kind of effect on her, so she's probably subconsciously aware of it or something. But I don't think the delusions are gone right now, unless she's actually just playing along for the others' sake</br></br></br>    <br>fuck off</br>    <br>Stop doing that, cunt.</br>  <br>There are plenty of better faces you coul dhave chosen for Miki.</br>  <br><br>We should keep condensed for the sake of the board. Unless the rest of you guys want to be the hated fanbase for the rest of the season.</br></br>  <br>how could you not use this page for Rii<br>it's like the best expression in the manga so far</br></br>  Does anyone have any idea of when she became like that?<br> Megu-nee having wrote that it's her fault makes me think that it was between the apocalypse and before her dead.<br>She also had that psychology book in her shelf.<br>Could she have done something for the sake of their survival?</br></br> </br>  <br><br>Oh fuckin right.<br><br>"yuruyuri is actually dark and sinister /a/ threads" - the anime<br><br>It's edgelord trash on par with madoka at best, and madoka's bottom tier so-deep shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh fanbase drama <br>No one gives a shit, fuck off.</br></br>  <br><br>literally this show's fans in a nutshell<br><br>"i-it's unique because it's blood and girls, r-r-right? let's make up some shit lore and metaphors...!"</br></br></br></br>  I want to lick Miki's thighs  <br>You'll give a shit when threads start getting deleted m8.</br>  <br><br><br>Truly the Dark souls of anime</br></br></br>  <br><br>right down to the "babby's first difficult game/horror anime" casual fanbase trying to look cool</br></br>  I went into this spoiled on the fact that there would be zombies, but the anime still managed to fake me out when it came time for their introduction. I was expecting this to include the initial outbreak, so I was constantly on guard for them to be attacked out of nowhere. So I really liked the reveal that the outbreak had already happened and it was all in Yuki's imagination, it was still different from what I was expecting, and it still surprised me. I'm definitely going to keep watching this for a few more weeks at least.  I just want to see the reaction of people who haven't read the manga after watching this first episode.  <br>Foucault/10</br>  <br>Went into the series blind, the reveal actually hurt me. Poor Yuki :(</br>  <br>I haven't read the manga but I browse /a/, so I don't have to read any manga.</br>  <br>I read the preview and thought I was watching the wrong show.</br>  <br>I went in knowing nothing as well, the episode seemed boring as hell. I've got Non Non Biyori for calm relaxation this season and this one doesn't even have an interesting setting... Then that final scene... Well played, well played Gakkou Gurashi. For a series that I had no expectations of, this was amazingly unexpected.</br>  <br>I was waiting for the zombies to attack or something, but what I got was so much better.</br>  <br>It was spoiled a bit for me by the MAL page but I guess I wouldn't even have started watching it without the horror tag. Still what the fuck man I was not prepared.</br>  <br>It was stupid and boring so I skipped through a good part, and went a bit before the ending. Then brain went like "what" and my head did a 90Â°.</br>  <br>I kept thinking, ughh how could this girl be so irresponsible to just barge into a classroom with class in session. OMG stop doing it, clearly its the middle of the period whats wrong with you, have you no consideration of those around you? Ughhh she did it again wh--------ohhh boy....</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So is she faking the megu-nee thing now? She did say "the four of us" when leaving the school in megu's car.Obviousely, if she still believed in Megu, she would say 5</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ITP: Shittiest taste.</br></br>  <br>Megu would stay in the school, no reason to count her for the trip<br><br>unless I don't remember right</br></br></br>  <br>I read the synopsis, but my brain sorta skipped over the zombie part. I was really surprised and confused. After that, I rewatched the episode from a different perspective and looked at the reactions of the others.</br>  The anime has successfully captured the Madoka audience, I'm glad maybe now we'll get the chapters faster.  <br>It was greatly spoiled by /r/anime before airing on the "upcoming anime chart" posts. Big spoilers. Spoilers like madoka magica after episode 3.<br>So...i don't think many constant /r/anime readers will be surprised.<br>And as episodes pass for this show it will be spoiled more and more...like madoka.</br></br></br>  <br>She hasn't done the Megu-nee thing in a while.</br>  What if the blackboard sentences are Yuki's subconscious thoughts?  <br>I'm pretty sure "Megu-nee" is with them. When Rii said they forgot to ask her about the vehicle change, Yuki replied "Megu-nee is fine with it" or something.<br><br>Still, the fact that she only acknowledged "Megu-nee"'s presence after someone else brought it up suggests that she is actually just faking it, or at least that ehr delusions are starting to fall apart</br></br></br>  <br><br> reddit <br><br>And this is what this kind of "it's gore so it's deep" anime attracts. <br><br>I hope this series dies out in popularity ASAP or this board is going to be a fucking cesspit.<br><br>at least the constant shitty oregairu threads didn't lie to themselves about the show's quality</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Yuki looked a little put off by Rii asking her about it. They've been pointing out how she's been acting a lot differently.<br><br>it's what lead to Rii's breakdown in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>I just started watching it cause "fuck it", never heard of the series or anything. I'm on this ride til the end now.</br>  <br>Why do we allow gays to marry?</br>  <br>/r/ anime's tastes are actually pretty based<br><br>https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comm<wbr>ents/3crqps/what_anime_had_you_hook<wbr>ed_from_start_to_finish/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>"Hmm okay, another nice cute girls doing cute things anime.. I wonder why this is tagged as Horror?"<br>This show looks like it's got amazing potential.. am excited to see how it turns out</br></br>  <br> MUH SEKRIT CLUB!!!! </br>  <br>It was unexpected but it wasn't another guillotine gorilla<br><br><br>laughingwhores.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10 you're not event trying</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I was buttmad because I read a description on a chart and it mentioned zombies.<br>Mid-way through the episode I quickly read the MAL description for "zombie" but no zombies there.<br>Realized what was going on when Miki said this and anxiety kicked in.</br></br></br>  <br>Of all the 'horror' wanna be series I've seen over the years, a series with cute girls chasing a dog for 95% of the episode's time is the first to have scared me. The moment the reality changed was amazing and terrifyingly shocking.</br>  <br>I did drop by /r/anime yesterday, and most replies to  are almost copy/pasted from there.</br>  <br>I didn't know anything about this beforehand. I just thought it was another cute/funny/relaxing SOL series. When the big reveal came, I was kinda shocked. Bravo Gakkou Gurashi, you managed to do something that hasn't happened to me since I saw Terminator 2 as a kid.</br>  <br>I was tipped off from the number of upvotes for this episode. /r/anime loves its moe but not enough for 450 upvotes. There had to be a catch.</br>  <br><br>Potential for fucking what.<br><br>Please enlighten me. <br><br>What potential is there in another generic ass zombie story with generic ass cute girls? Really.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I take it that it's just one person spamming this thread then?</br>  <br>don't you have some fucking off back to reddit or /v/ to do?</br>  <br>The generic feels, bro<br>The generic feels</br></br>  A friendly reminder that ironically pretending to be redditors is still harmful as it makes actual redditors feel comfortable posting.  <br>Never heard about it but saw threads popping up yesterday. Downloaded it on a whim and HOLY FUCK I DID NOT EXPECT THIS SHIT</br>  <br>A deep psychological horror anime in the trappings of a moe slice of life anime, pretty revolutionary if you ask me and full of potential</br>  the difference between Gakkou Gurashi and your generic zombie bullshit is that it focuses on the psychological aspect of living through something traumatic<br><br>meanwhile most other zombie shows are just all about shitty action and shock value</br></br>  <br>vI watched this knowing nothing about it after Chaos Dragon and Sky Wizards Academy. Both seem to fail horribly at storytelling and I was seeing the same in Gakkou Gurashi.<br>Cliche setting, stereotypical characters, boring dog chase, oh god can't this episode end so I can watch Gangsta... I was even feeling sleepy due to boredom (watching it @ 3am)... The shock from the final scene was amazing given my state of mind at the time.</br></br>  <br>This is some dedicated shitposting anon.</br>  <br>Might be, that's some great shitposting.<br><br><br>Sure, I guess I can get the same content from there before it reaches this place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't get spoiled because I don't follow much. I actually dropped the show about halfway through the episode, but then read your comment and finished it. what the fuck...<br>what the fuck</br></br>  <br><br> deep <br> psychological horror <br><br>Watch out guys, super brainiac anime patrician over here.</br></br></br></br></br>  It'd be nice if the mods deleted this thread  <br>Are you the same guy who keeps posting reddit memes?</br>  <br>Agreed. I can already feel these threads are going to be the worst ones on /a/ for this season.</br>  <br>It'd be nice if the mods deleted your mom.</br>  <br>This was actually better than the first chapter of the manga. The reveal took a bit longer to happen but it was so worth it. I'm really excited to see where it goes from here. :D<br>I watched it with my BF, made sure he knew absolutely nothing about it before watching, and he was really shocked when the reveal happened. IMO it's more surprising than the manga.<br>(He thought I was making him watch another - he doesn't really like them - moe SoL series, hehe)</br></br></br>   short haired one isn't a qt trap  <br>DROPPED<br><br>D R O P P E D<br>R <br>O <br>P <br>P<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I listened to advice given and read nothing about this show/manga. I went in blind. I legitimately spent nearly the entire episode thinking it was a slice of life centered around cute girls with learning disabilities and autism.<br>They all hang out in the Resource Room.<br>Main character was clearly not right in the head from the moment she came on screen.<br>I thought short haired girl had some social disability (barging into classrooms yelling, not understanding it disturbs the whole class) or attachment issues (being hit hard emotionally by the dog rejecting her).<br>Twin tail shovel girl just had bad social cues, talking about inappropriate topics like shovel kill ratios in WW1 and such.<br>I guess the world wasn't ready for such a SoL.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes.

Just report and ignore, you can't reason with someone who gets their fun out of ruining yours.</br>  Is this a Left 4 Dead but with cute girls doing zombie outbreak things?<br><br>Also i didn't know nitroplus was behind this project.</br></br>  <br><br>Any anime with a "oh it's so shocking and bloody" that hits even a little bit of mainstream turns /a/ into a shitshow</br></br>    <br>How the fuck did you jump to that conclusion? Besides, who in the right state of its mind would do that?</br>  <br>I... I.. was expecting yuyushiki :'(</br>  <br>a tryhard loli surviving a zombie apocalypse</br>  <br>With Gangsta, Gate, Monmusu, and what's been seen of JwWw threads, I'm not sure.</br>  I don't see the comparisons to Madoka. Madoka was pretty clearly fucked up right from the ebginning, even if Mami suddenly getting her head bitten off was unexpected. How could people watch three episodes of that and not once think "wow, this is getting pretty weird for a cute magical girls show"  <br>How do you turn a shitshow into a shitshow?</br>  <br><br>a tryhard anime surviving a shit casual fanbase</br></br>  <br>BARRICADE YO' HOMES</br>  <br>Just do whatever they did to /b/</br>  <br>This guy would.<br>He's only doing it to this thread.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would be fucking terrified if the only thing that kept me safe from zombies was a simple stacking of desks.</br>  <br>If you weren't such a show fag you would realize that there is a wall in behind those desks those desks serve no purpose at all</br>  Remove animeonlyfags.  <br>Why are the windows broken?</br>  <br>If there was a button that I could press that would kill all anime only fags in front of their families and friends I'd push that shit in a heartbeat</br>  <br><br>almost as edgy as this anime, brah</br></br>  imo this show as potential to surpass psycho pass as the GOAT anime series of the last 10 years tbh  <br>you're trying too hard.</br>  <br><br>are we still copypasting from reddit</br></br>  <br>Watch the episode.</br>  <br>I seriously doubt a person who cared about this would do that kind of thing just to keep everything in one thread.

Whenever the world ends in fiction, windows all across the world shatter simultaneously.</br>  <br>All I did was put links in both threads to each other. I've been reporting the reddit shit in this thread.</br>  <br> trope  <br><br>don't you have some fucking off to do back to MAL or tvtropes?</br></br></br>  <br> tfw four of the 7 shows I'm watching this season are adaptions of manga I'm already caught up on <br>I suppose it allows you to see the series in a new light.</br></br>  <br>Im avoiding these threads because some anon told me to, I generally knew what was coming but the reveal was significantly depressing. I was caught off guard.</br>  <br><br><br>Eh, guess it's only me that does that then<br> mfw when I pick up an anime and then drop it and just read the manga instead </br></br></br></br>  <br> those desks serve no purpose at all <br>you could clearly see a zombie behind them after the delusion ended.</br></br>  <br>tfw I stay off /a/ for the few weeks leading up to a new season so I'll be fresh for all but the most anticipated anime.</br>  <br><br>That post was really obviously sarcastic you idiot</br></br>  <br>A bunch of manga that I've read have been given anime this year. Hell there have been ~7 this season alone. Feels wierd mang</br>  <br>Expected a standard SoL, so the reveal took me totally by surprise. Then I watched the episode again. Then I read all of the translated manga chapters. <br><br> I need more </br></br></br>  <br><br> No new chapters till next month </br></br>  <br>Feels good to not be a filthy secondary. Also, imo this is one of the best seasons we've had in a long time, and I really wasn't all that hyped for it. Really good string of first episodes.</br>  <br>Another for "i had read the description but i was still fucking shocked by the reveal."</br>  <br> imo this is one of the best seasons we've had in a long time <br>really? what are you watching that you enjoy? all this show had going for it was the reveal (which, admittedly, was great) but otherwise I'm reserving judgment. Charlotte seemed kinda cool maybe? Everything else seemed crappy.</br></br>  <br>I usually just skip the anime unless it has a god tier VA cast, but this season has been different.</br>  <br>Having Miki there makes sense, since she'd be less willing to go along with Yuki's delusions than the other two.<br><br>Hopefully we see the rescue in a flashback or something</br></br></br>  <br>I read the description and knew what the show was supposed to be about, but I didn't really understand how serious the show was supposed to be. I was thinking it was a flashback or something for the whole episode, and I thought some of the details were just foreshadowing, a lot of the hints went over my head, like yelling into the classrooms.<br><br>Trying to decide now whether I should read the series now, or when the show is finished airing</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127895996 <br>Stay mad anime only pleb.</br>  I don't understand why some people have trouble getting exactly what's going on with Yuki, Megu-nee, and Rii. It must be everyone who tried to rush through the manga in the last few days popping up, because I don't remember this much confusion in the past over something so simple.<br><br>The apocalypse happened.<br>The three girls and Megu-nee banded together to survive and ended up staying in the school, barricading themselves and fighting off zombies.<br>Yuki started to lose it, so Megu-nee made the School Life Club to help her cope, and give them all some peace of mind and something else to focus on. The rules are all there to help survive.<br>Unfortunately, Megu-nee gets zombified almost immediately after, and with her loss Yuki shuts her eyes from reality, and begins hallucinating Megu-nee. She had already begun to do this earlier judging by the contents of Megu's letter.<br>Kurumi and Rii go along with it because Yuki's their friend and it helps them cope as well.<br>Whenever a zombie comes or a bad situation occurs, Yuki's delusion slightly breaks. Every time this happens, Megu-nee shows up to be her voice of reason, showing that subconsciously she understands the situation and the danger they're all in.<br>Eventually, Yuki's put in a situation where she can no longer rely on Megu-nee, and so opens her eyes for real. <br>From this point forward, she starts forgetting to ask Megu-nee for things, but Kurumi and Rii don't realize Yuki's changed. <br>Yuki is completely sane at this point, but is putting on the act because it relaxes the other girls.<br>Eventually Rii starts to lose it, and she becomes engrossed in her own delusions, at least to the point of trying her best to pretend Megu-nee is still around.<br><br>I think that about covers it. Simple, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Unfortunately, Megu-nee gets zombified almost immediately after, and with her loss Yuki shuts her eyes from reality <br>pic related<br>Argument ignored</br></br></br>  <br>I was about to say stopped reading due to the third and fourth lines, but  beat me to it.</br>  <br><br>Also: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;113004805 </br></br>  <br><br>Why be nitpicky when they don't give a solid timescale and it's obvious she died very quickly?</br></br>  <br>That letter and the psychology book she had makes it look like she broke Yuki on purpose</br>  <br>That's what you got from  ? It's clearly written as if it wasn't intentional. She didn't know it would get so bad. And I might be remembering wrong, but I was under the impression that the books were taken by Kurumi and Rii-san after the fact when she started hallucinating.</br>  manga fags spoiling everything this is just like /got/ gen in /tv/ <br><br>just because you read source material doesn't make you better</br></br>    <br>But clearly the anime is going anime-original from the start.</br>  <br>/a/ elitism is a joke</br>  <br>My jaw was on the floor and my mind kicked from neutral to 6th gear in half a second but I forgot I still had my foot on the clutch.</br>  <br>Me too, at first<br>But the psychology book was stored right next to her diary</br></br>  What the fuck happened to this thread?<br><br><br>How new are you? You're cancer for trying to start mangafags vs animefags too. <br><br>Not to mention the fact</br></br></br></br></br>  this is the type of show that really makes me shy away from looking into shows/manga before watching/reading them. If I had gone into this knowing it was going to turn out to be some zombie situation where the genki girl is hallucinating everything, no way would it have been as good.  <br>Were the psych books general or were they specific to DID? If they were general, then maybe Megu looked up why she was hallucinating, but if they were for split personality disorder then I'd sooner think Kurumi and Rii just put them all in the same place.</br>  <br>Thank god your foot was on the clutch mate.</br>  I liked it.  <br>Yep, they were DID</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Megu-nee sacrificed herself on that radio announcement or something like that.</br>  <br>jesus fuck this post got a lot of replies</br>  <br>Don't read them, most of it is pasta from reddit</br>  <br>is this a meme</br>  <br>this feels like a meme</br>  Read the manga, OP.  <br><br>how do you guys manage to post itt while you are so busy with your full time job of fucking off back to reddit?</br></br>  <br>fixed it.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br><br> Not yuki's "what" face <br><br>Could have done better</br></br></br></br>  fuck it I'm reading all 30 something chapters of the manga tonight it's going to take me all night but it's worth it  <br>Why does yours look so different? Do you actually go to reddit? Fuck off and kill yourself.</br>  <br>Put Megu-nee's back and it's perfect.</br>  <br>nothing wrong with reddit, everyone goes on there(to lurk not everyone has an account I'll give you that) it's like not having a facebook/twitter/instagram nowadays everyone does it</br>  <br><br> his /r/anime is :visited </br></br>  <br> removing zombie-nee <br> not putting in Kurumi's "I messed up" face <br>Come on</br></br></br>  <br> everyone does it <br><br>Talk for yourself little shit</br></br></br>  <br>/r/anime has pretty good taste imo <br><br>http://imgur.com/sDCfaW1</br></br></br>  <br> facebook/twitter/instagram <br>Yeah, kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>I don't care if you're being serious or not, you need to get the fuck out.</br>  <br>I'll check what my fav anime is according to this chart</br>  <br>the black haired new girl is sex</br>    <br> he doesn't read manga <br><br>I haven't even read Gakkou Gurashi, but having seen the name more than a year ago and read the synopsis gave me all the information I needed to know<br><br> being anime-only <br> Not being manga-primary </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DayZ the anime series</br>  <br> inserts Tales of Symphonia reference </br>  <br> Why is Miki already here. Why is the dog their club pet now <br>i suspect they made the first episode "In medias res" or in the middle of the story. the next episodes will probably be flashback. if i'm right then we'll probably be 6 episodes before we catch up to the first episode; the dog of course is a delusion like the classmates, seeing as the dog is already dead.</br></br>  <br>the dog interacted with the other girls though<br>unless you mean to say they're in another layer of Yuki's delusions</br></br>  <br>Then explain why Miki is in the ep 2 preview?</br>  <br><br>fuck you telling me the dog is not real too? I didn't pick up on that in the 1st ep</br></br>  <br>That was my favorite scene in the game.</br>  <br>NO, the dog is real<br>But in the manga  he's dead </br></br>  <br>It's like Kotoura-san reversed.</br>  <br>We don't know if the dog is real. It was already dead in the manga, but it interacts with the other club members in this episode so it's probably alive</br>  <br>I read the description weeks ago but forgot any details, I just assumed it was cute girls living in a school after the world has ended. Most of the episode I thought I was watching the wrong series, but said fuck it, I'm already watching this now, its boring as hell, but I'll at least finish it. Then I finished it. Holy hell, has she been hanging out and sleeping in that bloody mess this whole time? Thats more horrible than anything else.</br>  <br>Don't you mean  undead </br>  <br>I have no idea how long they've been there and they obviously need to do shit during the day for survival like hunt down/plant crops for food but I would atleast try to clean that mess up best I could</br>  <br> I'm confused. Is Yuki blind to these zombies or not? Does she know about the zombie apocalypse and know that there are very few people still alive? In the manga when she was cleaning up a classroom, she saw a zombie and killed it I think. So of course she knows the current situation they're in, right? But it looks like she still thinks life is normal. <br>she's half in fantasty land and half in reality. she can SEE whats in front of her, she's chosen to ignore it, and pretend it doesn't exist. <br><br>you'll notice her most lucid times are when she is forced to face reality. once shes back in her comfort zone she retreats back into delusion. In a way, Mii-kun is right. She is faking it. but she's faking it so hard she believes it. Mii was looking in the wrong direction when she was reading up on discociative personality disorder. That's not yuki's problem. her problem is she's descended into a state of denial to such an extent it's become a psychosis similar to schizoaffective disorder.<br><br>it's not multiple personalities, its a combination of stress, probably legit bipolar issues, and such an immense horror as the end of the world in a zombie apocalypse leading her into such an extreme state of denial is literally became a coping mechanism which lead to a type of schizoaffective behavior. <br><br>because the disorder is in part caused by herself (and also likely caused in part due to either depressive or bipolar issues) she's able to leave the state if ever she chose to face and accept reality. she's made the conscious decision to ignore reality, so when she's forced to face it due to situations where her very survival is dependent on actually recognizing the world for what it is, she will do so. then the moment the threatening situation passes, she can forget all about it by slipping back into the fantasy world. <br><br>this is basically what she's doing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they didn't kill him he'd just return again.</br>  <br> they kill the cute puppy <br>fucking DROPPED</br></br>  <br> reading manga spoilers <br>The dog was brought up and killed in a flashback</br></br>  <br>the girls dind know that yuki was out of her delusions at that point<br><br>And when they change megumi's car for radio-chan movile , they forgott to ask yuki if megumi was allright with it.<br><br>In other words yuki knows where she is , but the girls still think that yuki is "living school days"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What chapter was that?</br>  <br>17</br>  <br>17</br>   how did the pilot get infected?   <br>Got too careless and figured he had the medicine as a backup, maybe?</br>  <br> Maybe there was someone else infected inside the helicopter and he got bitten while piloting. </br>  <br>If they enable her she's at least semi-functional. It's not like there's a fucking therapist around to fix her right now, so the only other option would be to let her break and die, and as her friend that's unthinkable.</br>  <br> Not to mention the fact <br>Thank you for not mentioning the fact.</br></br>  <br>The 'retarded' is aware that she is delusional but she kept the charade because it helps her friends to cope with the stress from the apocalypse by acting like their usual school days activities. This so called act is actually what still kept them sane throughout the days. It's like making a mental barrier to push away all the bad stuff so that you don't snap and went on a suicide option.</br>   24 minutes of moeshit <br> 1 minute of plot progression <br><br>dropped</br></br></br>  <br>Bye. Nobody will miss you.</br>  <br><br> Any of these can be possible yes, all they show leading up to that part was a couple of HAZMAT scrounging through what a patrol found and then we skip straight to the pilot going to the helicopter. I can't wait till this gets cleared up. <br><br>What do you guys think? Maybe a bathroom break doomed the man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Figured he was already infected so they sent him out as comparatively disposable.</br>  <br>That's the joke.</br>  <br>the moeshit is completely unrelated to the quality of the actual show, though<br><br>Whether it turns out to be good or not, you can't really judge that based on the unrelated moe stuff. It's basically an entirely different show. I actually didn't like the episode either, but I'm still sticking around in the hopes that the zombie apocalypse show is more interesting than the generic moe SoL show<br><br>I don't know why I'm responding to this obvious bait in the first place, but oh well</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why was there only that one helicopter when they had three helipads?</br>  <br>It'd make more sense if they just let him walk there instead of taking a helicopter.</br>  <br>Because they keep sending out infected people and they keep crashing?</br>  STOP POSTING UNSPOILERED MANGAFAG SPOILERS, GUYS, WE ARE DRIVING AWAY THE ANIMEONLYFAGS <br>STOP IT</br>  has anyone noticed the hints given before the classroom scene in the end?  <br> WE ARE DRIVING AWAY THE ANIMEONLYFAGS <br>Are you acting like that's a bad thing?</br></br>  <br> WE ARE DRIVING AWAY THE ANIMEONLYFAGS <br>Good.</br></br>  <br> we </br>  <br>Shit, we've got a genius on our hands here.

I thought she was mostly acting to cheer up the other members? Right now, she's just creepy and unsettling. It was never this bad in the manga.  <br>image how painful it is to live it bruh</br>  <br>She was that crazy.

I actually afraid they gonna ruin it again.</br></br>  <br>yes, but  was the saddest one I've seen in a while</br>  To be honest I think it's impossible to adapt this manga correctly.  <br> Manchild crying over anime adaptation <br> Calling other posters sad <br>Alright.</br></br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great </br>  <br>Hayate S2 was pretty good and that was JC Staff iirc. And I like Shokugeki.</br>  <br>buy the bd gaijin<br> even at showing this anime at 02:00 in the morning they still censor the shit out of it, well fucking done japan </br></br>  <br>fanservice trash with bad art<br>and dropped</br></br>  <br>JC staff has been pretty good in recent years. They were the studio that did the WIXOSS series and that was incredibly well produced.<br><br>I blame the director for this one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dumb frogposter kill yourself.<br>Fucking cancer of summer.</br></br></br>   Best girl  <br> Kanahana <br>I love it.</br></br>  I think JC Staff did fine on this. The story was totally different than what I thought though. I thought that it actually might have some kind of plot because of the huge following. Instead it is mostly PLOT with S&amp;M shit going on. <br><br>I am not with the whole "let a female beat you up" type thing. Where I come from we slap hoes. Beat the shit outta em.</br></br>  Jitsui wa ep1 WAS good. I am not going to let one shitposter in a Prison School thread change my opinion. It was one episode and the entire adaptation was shit? Fuck You.  im an animeonlyfag why are people hating this  <br><br>You gotta be. Bones is an expert ruining final chapters.</br></br>  <br>read the manga.</br>  <br>Cause they censored it.</br>  <br> I thought that it actually might have some kind of plot because of the huge following <br>read the manga.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with that coloring? Holy fuck, sasuga JC.</br>  <br>the manga art looks fucking shit stop being butthurt because the studio fixed the shitty design</br>  <br>I haven't watched this or read the manga, but the one on the left is clearly better. The one on the right looks like the artists have never seen the manga.</br>    <br>oh okay thought it was about something else</br>  The manga is cheap garbage, so I don't know why everyone is so upset.  <br>It's people who only checked it for the lewdity rather than the story.</br>  <br>my eyes</br>  <br>That's fucking terrifying.</br>  What time does this shit air in Japan?  <br>I think it's a japanese time</br>  <br>yeah one of the most dissapointing first episodes this season</br>  <br>Did they follow this guide?</br>  <br>People got excited because tits. It's also oddly popular, because tits.<br><br>Cheap ecchi shows like prison school aren't exactly made for adapting</br></br></br>  <br>That's a parody image, right? They don't actually all have that exact same face, right?</br>  <br> oddly because tits <br> oddly <br> tits <br>reread the manga, there's nothing odd about being excited over tits</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also oddly popular, because tits. <br>By that logic 99% of all manga would be popular.</br></br>  <br>What's with the mold on their clothes?</br>  <br> bad art <br>Thanks JC Staff for making the adaptation so bad even secondaries are put off.<br><br><br> that finger positioning <br>What the actual fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> parody <br>nope<br> sameface <br>yes</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also oddly popular, because tits. <br>Good thing nobody watches it for that then.</br></br>  Is this going to be like Highschool DXD where HS was censored and some shitty fansub group got the uncensored version?<br><br>Or am I going to have to wait for the BDs?</br></br>  <br>HS is doing Okusama ga Seitokaichou! uncensored so I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility.<br><br>But seeing as episode one is censored I guess they won't be.</br></br></br>  Why does funimation exist?  So is the manga lewd enough on it's own or should I seek out doujins instead  <br> seek out doujins instead <br><br>Should we tell this newfag or let him find out on his own?</br></br></br>  <br>I almost forgot this is Summer.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me.</br></br></br>  <br> Well if the anime is bad, but the adaptation is good, that only means that the source is bullshit. <br><br>I can't stop laughing here</br></br></br>  <br>I have jacked off to every chapter of phs</br>   Prison School adaption is terrible <br>NO SHUT UP! I DON'T BELIEVE YOU<br><br>I don't want to believe...</br></br></br>  Apart from the stupid censoring I liked it.  <br>This looks like they tried to capture the art style of the manga, when it just doesn't work in motion.</br>    <br>i feel like the author includes titshots because it's gonna be labeled as ecchi anyway so why not. The story itself is compounded with friendship and brotherhood but mostly comedic circumstances</br>  Was the author able to continue his Devil Blues manga? Or was I dreaming?  <br>it's a fine adaptation. Personally I think the story is moving a bit too quickly to follow at times, but that's what the pause/play function is for, I guess.</br>  <br><br>It looks horrible, and it's censored to hell, which defeats the whole point of a fanservice show. Pure garbage.</br></br>  are you guys kidding? the adaption was fine  <br>Just wait for the BDs, jesus christ. Did you ACTUALLY think the should would be uncensored? Are you that retarded?</br>  Hey, fucking idiots... News flash! AT-X version will be out in 2 days which will be uncensored. Calm your tits.   fat guy has the smallest penis <br><br>This is discriminating actually<br><br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br></br>  adaptations of shit are shit.<br>this season is fucked.</br>  Why didn't they go for 24 episodes? Because of money?  <br><br><br>assburgers detected.<br><br>by "good," he means "faithful."<br><br>this isn't hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably<br>im surprised this even got adapted in the first place</br></br>  <br>Was it confirmed?</br>  <br>Holy shit, I couldn't een tell that was Andre, I thought it was a close up of Jo until I saw him to the right</br>  <br>Then you could've wrote "faithful" instead of "good" my ipchangingburgerlandnewfriend</br>  <br><br>The censorship is the tip of the iceberg. In addition, Monmusu is airing fully uncensored, and is as graphic as this.</br></br>  <br>Can you elaborate on what you mean?</br>   a shitty manga that only sales because of tits has a shitty adaptation because nippons can't animate the female body properly <br><br>What a surprise</br></br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>But that's a worldwide fact<br>Stay mad fat guy</br></br>  Just like with DxD, they were releasing AT-X versions (uncensored) a few days after. You don't have to wait for the BD versions.  <br>I actually read Prison School so the ugly ass anime is a plus. Secondaryfags won't be shitting up the discussion.</br>  <br> that only sales because of tits <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IMPLYING <br><br>Why don't you, ya know, actually read the manga instead of assuming like a dumbass? The art is godlike and Akira really knows how to draw girls in some sexy ways but the story is actually good and funny, better than most shit out there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Danmachi wasn't a good adaptation. It just looks nice.</br>  <br> inb4 muh muh Tsutomu Mizushima is the best director in the industry, everything he touches is gold. <br><br>People need to stop sucking this dude's dick</br></br></br>  <br>I heard the manga went into more depth on it's mmo/rpg like elements but for a short anime adaption, it's fair to cut that out since they just want to get through the story</br>  The art is probably more than half the manga's charm<br>This is going to suck</br>   &gt;Monster Masume adaptation is godlike  <br><br>It's not hard to please people with shitty harem fan service tastes.</br></br>  <br>You're right but the anime seems better than the source material so far</br>  <br> manga <br><br>It's actually the LN, but it really needed that depth for Bell's character. Without it he's just another gary stu with random asspull powerups.</br></br></br>  <br>Well is hard to be worse than a plotless, fanservice, selfinsert manga.</br>  <br>we don't write to please esl's, faggot.</br>  is there some place good to download the manga  <br>I heard google is a good start</br>  <br>google hmmmm ill have to look into this</br>  <br>I love you anon</br>   Gay Shit Staff  <br>what did you expect</br>  <br>They're usually good at comedy.</br>  I'm only on Chapter 22 of Prison School manga but the art is fucking fantastic, I don't even know if you could copy that over in anime to such details.  It was too rushed. Every character was talking as if it had a stick up of his ass. A good comedy needs fucking pauses,you don't slap every joke after the other.<br> inb4 chapters lax of content <br>They nearly adapted a whole fucking volume of material.</br></br>      <br>Maki a fucking piece of shit.</br>  <br> unironically hating best raibu </br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br><br>Not great.  Anime of the season </br></br></br>  The first episode was great, what fuck are you on about  It wasn't bad at all, it felt rushed but the pace should be slower in the next episodes  Yall have to be kidding me right? Yall actually thought this show would be uncensored? They censor nipples and that's not a big deal. Hell I haven't laugh this hard in a very long time. This show is perfect. JC Staff is on a role. The manga is great the anime is great. Love the adaptation   Light <br> Beams <br>They got us good.<br><br>Also, really uninspired work from the VAs. This is going to flop.</br></br></br></br>  I don't care if it's censored to hell or looks like shit. I'm going to watch it for glorious Kamiya MC and angry bitch HanaKana  <br> uninspired work from the VAs <br>Good post anon but let's try that post again without the dicks in your mouth.</br></br>  Fanservice aside, I think JC staff really nailed the comedy parts. I chuckled quite a bit.  <br><br>Ye I thought it was pretty funny</br></br>  <br>I find it hot</br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br>Good joke.<br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br>Almost had me there.<br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> adaptation <br> Bones anime </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  well /a/?

It's just the style they went with.</br>  <br> calling somebody a virgin on /a/ <br>Hello, Summerfriend.</br></br>  <br>I'm a virgin myself but tits don't work like that</br>  Feels rushed. I didnt laugh once  <br> now im downloading all the chapters to the manga <br>Good on you. Get ready for great art and I hope you have a lot of tissues to spare</br></br>  <br>This is not a comedy.</br>  Atleast it's funnier than Gintama.  <br>Those faces are scary</br>  <br>Both have different kinds of humour though, don't they? I haven't watched Gintama but I remember reading the first 4 volumes a long time ago and thought it was pretty funny but I wouldn't say it's humour is anywhere similar to Prison Schools</br>  <br>what is it then</br>  <br>A deconstruction of the ecchi harem genre</br>  <br>it is, my animeonly summerfriend</br>   Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br> Himouto Umaru is Godakobo revival <br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> Shimoneta adaptation did not disappoint <br><br>All this fucking delusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expecting ecchi shit to be good <br><br>LOL</br></br></br>  <br>Compared to the manga? Yes, faggot. Read the manga</br>  I'm I the only one who reads Prison School for the antics and happenings? The tits and ass are a plus but if it were censored I wouldn't even give a shit as long as the story and characters stay likable.   Prison School <br> Shoukugeki <br><br>Why is JC so based?</br></br></br>  <br>It was doomed to fail. There's just no way any animation company would have the balls to do what needed to be done to adapt this spiritually and practically.</br>  <br>No, you're not. I like the characters very much.</br>  <br> 4chan browswe <br> Actual consumer <br><br>NOPE</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not the only one. I first read it for the tits but was pleasantly surprised by the top tier comedy and story progression. All the characters besides Chiyo are actually pretty good.</br>  <br>Yeah i can't get enough of Andre and his fucking face, it blows my sides</br>   VP beats the shit out of MCs mercilessly <br> "No, licking your boot is too much" <br> She actually backs down </br></br>  <br>this show and manga are SHIT</br>  <br> Secondaries </br>  <br>Is this pic from this manga?<br>I was always curious about this pic but never asked about it before.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  That first episode felt really rushed, It's been ages but didn't they just burn through a good couple of chapters?  <br>No, you're not. I couldn't give two shits. It baffles me how maybe 20 seconds of steam and white light is ruining the other 24 minutes for some people.</br>  <br> Monmusu is airing fully uncensored <br>It isn't<br><br>There is still slight censors</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how clever the series can get at times, Some of the scenes where Kiyoshi has his monologues are amazing.<br>I loved that scene where Kiyoshi has to discreetly pass the phone to the president.</br></br>  <br>It is comfrimed? 12 episodes means is going to be shit no matter how you look at it, they going to adapt around 8 chapters into 1 episode.</br>  <br> It baffles me how maybe 20 seconds of steam and white light is ruining the other 24 minutes for some people. <br> Many are watching just for those 20 seconds. </br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but I'd take Monmusu's unobtrusive censoring method over lightbeams any day of the fucking week.</br>  <br><br>and the colors and apparently the art style, personally I enjoy it even though they change some few stuff I wasn't bother by the censor. <br><br>I'm here for the laughs, the fanservice is just a big bonus for me.</br></br></br></br>  If this is 12 episodes and expected to end at their release boy oh boy is it going to rushed as a motherfucker.  <br> Watching a series just for fanservice </br>  <br>For obvious things like pussy. I still saw nipple though.</br>  For what I read, it's going to air uncensored in 2 days right? Though AT-X been shit for most of series this season, why is that?  <br> secondaries <br>nice meme<br>why dont you go back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>Where do you think this is? You'd have to be blind to miss the fact that every poster on this site and their dog will watch a show just for a bit of fanservice.</br>  <br> Watching a series just for fanservice <br>You have to be fuking me, I love the series but you don't seriously believe people don't watch some stuff just for fanservice do you?</br></br>  Other than the censoring I think it looks pretty okay. <br><br>Sometimes they look like porcelain but it's not as bad as I thought it'd be.</br></br>  The coloring is actually total dogshit. Look at the clothes, why is it that they can't decide if it should have a fade or not? Same with the faces. <br><br>Also the pacing was really fucking bad. They are going to shove like 80ish chapters into 1 cour.</br></br>  <br><br>Decide already.</br></br>  <br>I know people do, but that's a really fucking stupid reason to watch a series.</br>  <br>Prison school is so over the top in its sexuality that I've managed to completely ignore it at this point and only read it because it's funny as shit.<br><br>I never got the appeal of hyper ecchi anyway since at that point just watch some shitty hentai.</br></br></br>  <br> fucking stupid reason to watch a series. <br>Why is it stupid?</br></br>  <br>yeah so far i fucken love the characters and how they interact cant wait for more eps.</br>  <br>Because wasting your time watching an entire series for maybe a few minutes of fanservice throughout it is retarded</br>  <br>That's not really "stupid", At least no more so than watching cartoons for hours on end each day.<br>Watching anime doesn't really have much pay off anyway just watch whatever the fuck you want for whatever reason you want dude.</br></br>  <br>Those two posts are saying the same thing. Reading comprehension, anon.</br>   ecchi shit <br><br>If you watch this garbage you are the cancer killing anime</br></br>  <br>I really can not for the life of me figure out why they decided to color it like that...why couldn't they just go with your typical fucking flat colors? It would look so much better like that</br>  why do some of the MCs sound so autistic?  <br>It's ecchi with a legitimate good story, good characters, good progression, and good humour. The ecchi is just a bonus you fucking retard.</br>  <br>How does one sound autistic</br>  <br> implying I give a shit about the state of anime anymore </br>   A fanservice show that focuses on a bunch of guys <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br> A fanservice show that focuses on a bunch of guys in an entire school full of girls* </br>  <br>It won't be uncensored on AT-X. It doesn't have the same notice that uncensored shows get.<br><br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>6206 (â»è¦è´å¹´é½¢å¶éããâ»)<br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>5336 (â»è¦è´å¹´é½¢å¶éããâ»)<br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>6521</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the rest of you, but after watching the episode I wasn't that bothered by the coloring. I think it looks OK in motion, it's when everything is still that it looks like ass.</br>  <br>It's not god awful it's just a really strange thing to do for seemingly no reason</br>  chaos dragon was better than this shit, the manga of course is fucking excellent but i cannot pretend that this adaptation isnt complete shit  <br>CD is better than a lot of shows: overlord, rokka, prison school, LN harem #2, gakkou gurashi, shimoneta</br>    So, we getting around 8 chapters per episode? And you people worried about the censorship??  If they break out of prison by episode 12 that's around 7 chapters per episode, they ended this episode in the middle of chapter 6<br><br>Which means unless they skip some chapters or something, the pacing will be this fast every episode</br></br>  Honestly I really enjoyed the first episode. It could have been better visually but otherwise I think it did the job well.<br><br>I do have similar worries to a lot of anons with the pacing. I think for the early chapters this breakneck pace is fine, but I think having 5/6 chapters per episode later on could ruin it.</br></br>  <br> I love how clever the series can get at times, Some of the scenes where Kiyoshi has his monologues are amazing. <br><br> Him laughing just because the prez told him to was gold.  </br></br></br>  There were a few funny moments but they've destroyed the pacing so badly. Even basic things like conversations had horrible pacing, nevermind the fact that we're already so far in the story. They're probably planning to wrap the whole thing up in a season.  <br>I was hoping that the ridiculous pacing was just so they could get into the prison quick and start the main story so people wouldn't drop it after the first episode but there wasn't a need to rush Hana's introduction so I don't think that's the case sadly :/<br><br>I'll probably give it 2 more episodes to see if the pacing changes because a few things were still funny in there.</br></br></br>  This really doesn't look anywhere near as good as the manga.<br><br>And it's being censored.<br><br>Honestly I'm not even sure if I feel like downloading.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And it's being censored. <br>What did you fucking expect? When was the last tv anime that had tits uncensored? Are you fucking retarded?</br></br>  While it did feel kinda rushed, the comedy was there and it was really enjoyable. Maybe the fact that I've alredy read the manga influences my reaction to it though  <br>I genuinely don't understand what's so bad about this image.<br>The sameface is atrocious but the rest is above average.</br></br>  <br>The colors and art style look fine though don't they?<br>The censorship is bad but other than that seems fine.</br></br>   it doesn't look as good as the manga <br>no fucking shit, that would be borderline impossible<br>it's still probably going to be AOTS and a contender for AOTY, just because it's still much better than any other anime coming out</br></br>  <br>how about you read the manga, stupid</br>  <br> No Sugita <br><br>I miss Jack.  I miss Nichibros so bad. <br><br>School boys SoL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;&gt;School girls SoL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, it looks fucking cheap compared to Danmachi or Souma. It's like JC didn't even care to give it a good budget. It has horrible animation too.</br>  Andres voice is terribad, besides that this is fantastic.  <br>Does somebody knows what happened to Me and the Devil Blues? That shit was amazing.</br>  <br>Well haven't seen it yet, only judging by the pictures posted in this thread but I don't see anything particularly bad with the colors.</br>  <br>what kind of shitty filter did JC use, jesus this looks bad or is this intentional since Prison School is supposed to be a trashy show?</br>  It's awful but Kana Hanazawa  I fucking hope they add all the close-ups to the Blu ray  Fuck, only 6 BDs? So it's going to be one cour and rushed as fuck. Nice knowing you Prison School.  <br>what's wrong with you /a/, this was easily a 10/10 first episode. no, I'm not trying to bait. the manga is 11 or 12/10 though</br>  <br>Pretty much. When I read all the complaints I thought the censoring was much worse, but it was just in the close ups.</br>  <br>Let him learn anon. He must learn.<br><br> Either that or spread the glory of daigo. I swear you just have to pretend veep grew up and wants to fug her kid then this doujin works </br></br></br>  <br>You got that right. Just watched the episode 1, what a horrible pacing like the show was on crack or something. Well young jump adaptions are doomed to fail one way or another</br>  <br>I don't even understand why people are so obsessed with the censoring. The scenes were not cut and will be available in the bd edition later on. The truth is this episode was genuinely funny, unlike most other series where gags are so forced that watching becomes awkward</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>AT-X is another channel or distribution system or whatever that releases uncensored shows. Shows that required the nudity for obvious reasons. <br><br>People are pissed prison school gets censored since it's one of the biggest factors of the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow jc staff do uncensor. So it's great then.</br>  <br>It's just a cheap gimmick, while the fanservice is great, it's not the main reason you should be watching Prison School. It actually has a good story, good characters, and good themes underneath the facade of trashiness it displays.</br>  <br>So people are bitching for no reason then? Just wait like two days if you want it uncensored?<br><br>People are fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing, AT-X will NOT be showing this uncensored for some reason. You literally have to wait for the BDs.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I agree. I read it for the comedy I'm probably gonna watch this censored just so I can keep up to date.</br>  <br>But then why is it being shown on that channel?</br>  <br>I guess for people who miss the initial broadcast on whatever channel it was first aired on?</br>  I enjoyed it. It's been a while since anything's made me laugh an actual laugh.<br><br>I love this guy's voice.</br></br>  <br>Well, that was disappointing, dropped</br>  Why's everyone complaining about the pacing? I didn't see a single thing that was cut from the manga, and aside from not being able to match the god tier drawings it was pretty much on point exactly. Not to mention the fact that I like how it's moving at a good clip. Not much happens per chapter.  <br> I didn't see a single thing that was cut from the manga <br><br>Not yet anyway. How are they going to cram 82 chapters in 12 eps?</br></br></br>  <br>6 or 7 chapters an episode, which the're already doing</br>  <br>Oh and forgot pic</br>  <br><br>This, they didn't really remove anything.</br></br>  <br>Didnt someone say they are doing 6 volumes worth so only 60-70 chapters? Might be bullshit.</br>  <br>They cut that one page that had Kiyoshi surrounded by girls at the opening ceremony<br>That's one of my favorite pages too</br></br>  <br><br><br>They removed some scenes and removed dialogue. They made everything go faster than the manga, so of course it'd feel a bit rushed.</br></br></br>  <br>Without quick pacing it won't reach the ending and/or climax.It won't be good isn't it?</br>  <br> always following the live TL <br> watching this and enjoying it so much <br> maybe the most fun I had from this season chinese cartoon <br> all complaining in this thread <br><br>There will be no way of comfortable discussion on this show, wouldn't it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not an excuse for ruining the adaptation. They should have done 2 cours if they wanted to do it properly. Yamada-kun's anime was rushed too, and in the first episodes it wasn't too bad, but on later episodes it was really shitty, so I expect the same to happen with this. That is, unless it magically is in fact 2 cours.</br>  <br>what the fuck am i looking at?</br>  <br> jitsu wa watashi wa </br>   shit animation <br> shit art <br> shit direction <br> shit pacing <br><br>It's like Im watching Terraformers. When did JC Staff turn into LIDEN Films?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> glorious Kamiya MC <br>Faggot detected</br></br>  When I watched it raw, I thought it seemed to go really fast, but after seeing with subs, I don't feel that it's so fast anymore. It's still really funny and I like the voice actors. Also, I think HanaKana did a great job even though a lot of people bitched about it at first. <br><br>Though, it seems that it's mangaonly people complaining along with a bunch of shitposters. I hope all of you drop it by next week so that the discussion can be a little more bearable.</br></br>  <br>Man this post was priceless.</br>  <br>That's a good comparison, in any case JC Staff is dead to me, just going to finish Shokugeki, after Shokugeki I thought they might be the new heroes of anime, but now I just want to bomb them.</br>  <br><br>What he said. Avid lover of the manga and I think this adaptation is great so far.<br>Fucking /a/</br></br></br>  <br><br>BDs faggot, how did you expect this to not be censored on TV?</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking with you there man, I came for the TnA and stayed for the characters and laughs.</br></br>  prison school the #1 disappointment of the summer <br> im ashamed to even mention the anime and the manga in the same post </br>  I see everyone complaining about the censorship, but is the writing still the same? It was pretty bad, I'm genuinely disappointed that I listened to /a/  <br>Well look at what the cock-a-doodle do fella here has to say. "SOOOOOME PIG" he says. Well all be, kids these days.</br>  Why aren't we talking about how great the OP is?  <br> I'm genuinely disappointed that I listened to /a/ <br>Manga =/= anime<br><br>Just read the manga if you don't like the anime. I promise you the manga is actually really good, both in art and story</br></br></br></br>  <br>The story is the same. The early parts aren't as good though, it gets gradually better.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #2<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  Requesting my wonderful waifu, Mimi.<br><br>Possibly welcoming anon home as he gets back from work, but anything cute would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>She'll share her vodka with you if you draw her!<br><br>As always, take it easy, and I hope everyone has an absolutely amazing weekend.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume.

Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality.  Falulu's Non has evolved.  Lala a cute.  <br>Get that rubbish out of here.</br>  what the hell did I just watched.  <br>Vampkatsu!</br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  Gon  Were people surprised? It felt like a natural, albeit extreme, culmination of his character flaws when faced with a situation he couldn't handle. <br><br>Fucking scary though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, i've seen a few posts who said they didn't understand why Gon changed so much, when in reality he hardly changed but just was pushed past his breaking point.<br>Also i don't think it wasn't only a culmination of his flaws, but of everything that defined him as a character.</br></br>  <br>You're right, not just his flaws but also his good traits like optimism and determination. I really loved that aspect of it.</br>  <br>So he's like kid Goku.</br>    Gon is so cute  I really like Gon, he's a great and precious character.  <br>yeah but it was subtle enough to pass the radar<br><br>the Crimera ant thing was much more easy to notice</br></br></br>  <br>gon a best</br>  What a nice kid.  <br>I wish Shoot got to thank him. He needs that right now, kind words and praise</br>  Hypocrisy is a construction of society, though. That's where the idea of holding yourself to some sort of stated set of values came from.<br><br>Gon just like what he like, and don't like what he don't like. It's the same as when Goreinu wanted to shit on Bomber, but but wanted to heal Killua instead. <br><br>That being said Gon needs to learn to chill the fuck out and he doesn't learn that lesson from being 99% dead then fuck him</br></br></br></br>  Tell me /a/, where does he place on the character alignment?  <br>definitely chaotic neutral</br>  <br>People cannot handle characters in shounen handling situations like real people would in real life. They think hypocrites are poorly written characters<br><br>Gon is a kid who needed to decide between avenging one of the few truly influential figures in his life or getting through with the rescue plan safely</br></br></br>  <br>Hisoka is Chaotic Neutral. Gon is Lawful Good, that's why he was so conflicted in the first place.</br>  <br> Gon is Lawful Good <br>What makes you say that? I've started rereading the CA arc and the only part where Gon seems truly "good" is when he tries to rush and stop Yunju from crushing one of the guys he kept on a leash.</br></br>  <br>Gon also could not understand how the Genei Ryodan would kill people they didn't know.</br>  <br>Nah, he's neutral good if anything. maybe chaotic good.</br>  Gon will be a fucking monster if he has to, it's just that he acts nice in normal settings.  <br>There was also this guy.</br>  <br>Can we say he tries really hard to be Lawful Good? I mean, Neutral Good and Chaotic Good are definitely Kurapika and Leorio</br>  <br>He isn't acting.</br>  <br>Isn't Kurapika more like chaotic neutral?</br>  <br>If he were Chaotic Neutral he wouldn't care about the eyes anymore as they serve no purpose to him. Him wanting to serve justice means he has some good, albeit twisted, inside of him.</br>  <br>He got mad at the Spiders for indiscriminately killing people with no regard for their lives.</br>  Since we're discussing alignment now, let me try to give the best examples for the remaining ones:<br>Lawful Neutral - Netero. Otherwise he would have gone on a dojo rampage after becoming super strong instead of becoming chairman.<br>True Neutral - Zeno. The Ant situation barely phased the Zoldycks and Komugi dying made him lament not being able to act truly neutral.<br>Lawful Evil - Meruem. Don't think there's a lot to discuss from this point onward.<br>Neutral Evil - Genthru.<br>Chaotic Evil - Pariston.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Illumi?</br>  <br> Meruem <br> evil <br>What? <br>Uvo would be lawful evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaotic Neutral, just like Hisoka. He wants to preserve the family hierarchy but at the same time he wants to control Alluka's power.</br>  <br> Lawful Evil - Meruem. <br>get the fuck out of here</br></br>  <br>He could never realize the evil in his ways of maintaining humanity as cattle for the Ants. In fact, his revival only made his become more delusional about his intelligence and the true meaning of equality.</br>  <br> Chaotic Evil - Pariston. </br>  <br>Pariston stop posting</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Although I can agree maybe we already have better examples. I'd like to place Chrollo and the Spiders or Gyro in that spot but we have no clue what their motives are.<br>their motivations are</br></br></br></br></br>  YOU    <br><br>lawful evil is pouf, completely bound to the 'rule' of serving meruem</br></br>  <br>CAN</br>  <br>But that was what he was biologically programmed for. Those were his innate instincts, there was nothing evil about it at all. He forgave Pouf, wished good luck to Welfin, spared Knuckle's and Meleoron's lives, judged himself unworthy of his RG's loyalty and gave up on everything once he remembered the thing he truly cared about as a person.<br>He is not evil in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br>More like Teen Gohan 2.0<br><br>You do know the ENTIRE Chimera Ant Arc is based of the Cell saga, right? <br><br>Culmination of DNA built into one "perfect" being? <br>Check<br>Netero sacrificing himself for humanity? (Do I hear Goku?) <br>Check<br>Netero power up scene in front of Colt IDENTICAL TO GOKU POWER UP SCENE IN FRONT OF KORIN where both are told they're not strong enough? <br>Check<br>Self-destruction bomb used (TRIED to be used in DBZ) on perfect being? <br>Check<br>Young boy realising tremulous power that culmunates from hatred? <br>Check<br><br>Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ho before bros <br> not evil </br></br>  Pariston is more chaotic neutral than evil IMO.<br><br><br> more delusional about his intelligence <br>What do you mean? Meruem was very smart and capable of rationalizing moral values; the only issue was that his standards stemmed from a position in which Ants were the key species, not us.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Teen Gohan 2.0 <br>How exactly? I'm curious, it's been a while since i read DBZ.<br> Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen <br>I'm pretty sure he does get an immense amount of credit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the whole point was what would a perfect being like that actually think and feel upon coming into existence. Kind of like how Gon was like what if a super optimistic stereotypical shounen protagonist actually existed and had to deal with things like loss and failure?<br><br>It's no secret that Togashi takes influence from Dragon Ball</br></br></br>  <br>I understand where you're coming from but I'm judging him on the perspective of the story as a whole, not on each character's nature.<br><br>For example, maybe the Ryodan have a good reason for killing all those people, but none would make them be good. If I were to judge them from their perspective, they would be heroes.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never hold hands with Gon </br>  which part of hunter x hunter left the biggest impression on you? it was netero vs. meruem for me. the scale and brutality of that fight was insane.  <br>116 for sure.</br>  <br>The dodgeball game</br>  <br>gon and killua</br>  <br>Pushed to his breaking point. A usually young, playful, caring boy having power brought out by rage. Gohan's character changed when fighting Cell. He never liked fighting, but after going Super Saiyan 2 he only wanted to punish Cell. Make him feel pain and fear instead of killing him quickly. Basically torturing him. Though with the speed of DBZ, that phase didn't last too long. Gon, on the other hand, is an even more extreme version and is drawn out more, as you can see from Hunter X Hunter.</br>  <br>That picture is so disingenuous because Madhouse altered the events of the first chapter.</br>  <br>Not really altered, just rearanged.<br>Doesn't change the fact that everything you see in the pic would still have been in ep 1 even with the Kite flashback, it's a very short one.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br><br>If we're talking about scenes, though, it's definitely this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VYQ<wbr>rOXbznKs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Few were able to better flesh out characters like this scene did with Ging and Gon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay anon, at least we have this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nDg<wbr>WDlvvaNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Probably that one scene of Kaito under that cherry blossom tree at the end of GI, even though it's like one page. Netero vs Meruem was great too, I really liked the analogies of the field of needles and a contest in which one must consecutively make the correct choice.</br>  <br>This part. It sent chills down my spine when I first read it.</br>  <br>Togashi's really good at conveying expressions. Most other mangaka would have everyone looking shocked instead of tailoring it to each character's personality.</br>  <br><br>the yorknew arc made me realize this wasn't going to be an average shonen. aside from uvo, the phantom troupe all remained alive and escaped, as opposed to becoming structured 'boss battles' for kurapika. chrollo was also a very interesting 'villain', i haven't really seen anyone like him before.</br></br>  <br><br>gon-san jadedly smashing what remained of pitou's head, still muttering his rock-paper-scissors callout.</br></br>  <br>This is the essence of HxH</br>  <br>Right? The part with Gon and Killua following Kurapika's plan from Leorio's directions really sealed the deal for me.<br><br>Chrollo also looks like he's in just as much of a struggle as Kurapika to get to his objective, from the fight against Silva and Zeno.</br></br></br>  As someone who recently watched the 2011 anime then went back and read the manga, what is the justification for not showing Kaito's flashback at the very beginning? It seems like a pointless change.  anyone else find greed island just sort of...clumsy? the dodgeball finale was great but i thought the rest of it was all over the place.  <br>Gohan had gotten angry before and the thing that changed about his character was the maturation past his cowardly nature. He only needed a little push at that point and that's why Goku had him fight Cell. <br><br>Sure it was rage that brought him there, but he was still himself and was even still holding himself back.<br><br>More or less, Gohan is a regular person psychologically where as Goku and Gon are sociopaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty angry at the 2011 adaptation for making him look so fucking ugly. His appearance along with his somewhat disturbing facial expression was a big part of his charisma.</br>  <br>Same here. It had a lot of potential, specially since Togashi looked like he was gonna follow some RPG structure, but it turned out to be more like... all sidequests? It was cool that he managed to fit in the training sequence with Bisky in it without it feeling forced, though.</br>  <br>This video reminds me that we don't see enough of HxH's beasts. We see pterodactyls and "chocobo" in Kurapika's flashback arc, though. Where the fuck did he live?</br>  <br>These<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QvNU<wbr>kqHni6o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>he looks too 'cute' in 2011. in the manga it's impossible to determine what he's thinking, which makes him eerie/more of an effective antagonist.</br></br>  <br><br>Greed Island is a mess, the card system just slows the story down and the 'reveal' of it not being a game at all was pretty poorly done. I'm fine with the twist itself, but it didn't carry any weight.</br></br>  Hajimeruyooo~  <br>Nothing. Madhouse fucked up immensely.</br>  <br><br>all i can think of is to build mystery when gon/killua finish GI and encounter him under the tree. so the audience has more of a 'who the fuck is that' reaction rather than 'oh, it's kite'.</br></br>  <br>There WAS no reason. There's a lot of things Madhouse messed up on</br>  <br>GI is an amazing arc. Its obvious you dont enjoy it if you cant follow the meaning of the game for Gon's pals and for the rest of the players.</br>  <br> it didn't carry any weight. <br>I'm fairly certain it wasn't supposed to be an important plot point, they kind of just shrugged it off.</br></br>  <br>Director's waifu was certainly true</br>  <br>HxH is all over the place in case you haven't noticed. It's an intentional design.</br>  <br>Do you thin shonen characters turn strongers just because of power of friendship? Yes, GI is a "training" arc, but it gives a great sifnificant of nen and it gives too the support of how much Gon and Killua become stronger during the arc. And thats the reason why Biske is so important in the plot.</br>  <br>Damn, that directing is pretty fucking good. I think i need to rewatch the old version.</br>  <br>No, he understood how they could kill people they didn't know, he didn't understand how they could feel upset over their own being killed and nothing over anyone else.</br>  <br>I think you're almost right. He didn't understand how they could do it, but he wasn't upset at them for it, it seemed like he genuinely wanted to understand why. The only thing that made him upset is the fact that they could feel bad over one of their members being killed.</br>  <br>I watched the show first and that was my exact reaction. Thought it was kind of cool how they just jumped straight into the next arc with a new character we knew nothing about.</br>  <br>It felt structured like a training arc meant to give Gon and Killua their nen abilities.<br><br>The ending to it was contrived. <br> "Everyone who came here was prepared to die, that's why we're letting their killers live". <br><br>Aside from its resolution, it was a decent but lighthearted arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And, obviously, GI is much better in manga than any anime version (OVA version is awful).</br>  There would be no issues if people would just be his friend. But no, they just have to be the antagonists. They chose their own fate  <br>I thought the OVA was okay. Then again this was a long time ago. I don't really know.</br>  <br> 'oh, it's kite'. <br>I was actually very happy to see him again after like 180 chapters because he's a really cool guy.</br></br>  <br>easily the dragon dive scene, it gives me shivers no matter how many times i rewatch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=86M<wbr>oueTiBXE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a big fan of the 99 version. I think it had the best version of York Shin and I complain a lot about the 11 version for its directorial flaws.<br><br>The GI OVAs however were fucking shite.</br></br></br>  <br><br>and now he's a loli.</br></br>  <br><br>pouf going apeshit is great.</br></br>  Do you prefer doujins with sad endings, or with happy endings? I'd say happy, seeing someone get bullied really kills my boner.  I'm a sucker for happy endings.  I want everything to have a happy ending.  Happy endings are good.  Happy.  I like good endings if there is some torture of bullying in it. Fuck bad endings.  <br>Why you lied to me?</br>  <br>If you'd paid attention, the stuff underneath the table gave it away.</br>    <br> that fucking picture </br>  <br>hahahahaha</br>  <br> implying lovey-dovey romantic endings (often ending in marriage) aren't the best <br><br>don't be a fucking edgelord.</br></br></br>    <br>This is what the bible should be like.</br>  <br>best ending</br>  <br><br> don't mention it </br></br>  <br>Is that a rewrite?

Sucks that TNC Lunch quit drawing due to depression, though given the stuff he wrote and drew I'd be pretty depressed, too.</br>  <br>Don't you see their happiness?</br>  <br>She might be untidy and all that rubbish are hers.</br>  <br>I prefer rape/gangbang/netorare/other fetish hentai to end with a culmination of the fetish, not wasting several pages on some heroic deus ex machina ending that has nothing to do with porn.</br>    <br>You mean fake happiness?</br>  <br>Unexpected happiness.</br>  <br>lmao</br>  <br>Lel</br>  <br>Is this manga ShindoL's biting indictment of the bullying culture pervasive in Japanese schools, and the tragedy that it can easily bring about in innocent students' lives?</br>  Bonus points for comedy gold.  I prefer rape.  <br>Never fails to crack me up.</br>  <br>thats fucking disgusting anon</br>  <br>Saved.</br>  <br>MOOOOOOOOOODS</br>  <br>When the ending and everything leading up to it is incredibly unreasonable I can't be sad. Like the story in your pic, it's just completely ridiculous.</br>  <br>Excuse me, does anyone know the name of this?<br><br>Image search gives me nothing much a link to an mmo board.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't even.</br>  <br>Happy or bittersweet endings are the best. Also lots of hnng and an actual plot.</br>  I utterly loathe rape/bad end doujins, which is precisely why I fap to them from time to time to feel that sense that I'm doing something wrong, something I'll regret afterwards. In particular, doujins of characters I like getting raped or tortured so that I feel guilty about it and am reminded of it whenever I see the series mentioned. Like that Nanoha doujin "3 Mothers".  <br>It depends, both can be good.<br>That's not a doujin by the way.</br></br>  <br>PFFFT.</br>  <br>I remember that ending. After she's ostracized from school, her mother kicks her out, leaving her to be pimped out by her fuck buddy.<br>It was deliciously soul crushing.</br></br>  I like the ones where they fuck, those are the best  Depends on my mood, but generally I prefer happy endings. I read and enjoy darker stuff too, but afterwards, not immediately but within half and hour or so, I usually get in mood for something sweet and vanilla.  Sometimes I read doujins just for the loveydovey dialogue and only halfheartedly look at the lewd pages.<br><br>I don't know. Seeing someone confess and pour their heart out to someone else and the general atmosphere of those doujins just transforms my latent heartboner energy into bonerboner energy.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, confessions are great.<br>If only most doujinshi I try didn't confuse confessions with sex.</br></br>  No. Prefer sad endings. I want to see the despair in the characters as they lose all hope.<br><br>I also like NTR.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, its the intimacy and briefness of doujins that can make them very heartwarming reads, better than some 100+ chapter manga that drags on for the next flag to be sprung up.</br>  <br>Yeah, the nice thing about hentai doujins is that they actually go somewhere. Going somewhere too quickly, without any build-up, can also be a problem, but a lot of vanilla doujins are really good for a quick heart-warming read.</br>  <br>dammit /a/, my thread got deleted because of you.</br>  <br>What thread?</br>  <br> briefness of doujins that can make them very heartwarming reads <br><br>So..... basically oneshots?</br></br></br>  <br>I absolutely love when a doujins portraits even weird pairs as just a story about love. I love damaged goods, comedy hatesex, stuff like that. But I have best time reading those stories. I don't even fap.<br> tfw I read doujins for the plot </br></br>  <br>Kek, where you the guy who tried to start a Morrowind thread with that image on /v/?<br><br>What the fuck were you expecting?</br></br></br>  <br>Left out "intimacy" m8, key word there. I'm not saying all one-shots are not intimate, just that the majority that I have come across don't tend to give me the same satisfaction as some doujinshi that I have read.</br>  <br> that doujin <br><br>Simultaneously impossibly pure and more dirty than any mindbreak in this world.</br></br></br>  Definitely happy. <br><br>Although recently I read this, and the  transition from happy to soul crushing to happy was one hell of a roller coaster   I almost stopped at page 94 I couldn't handle it <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/821767/b407ba<wbr>9734/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  I like happy endings with tragic content.  <br>Speaking of happy to soul crushing to happy, this is always and forever will be one of my favourites. <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/601371/4a2823<wbr>690b/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind sad endings but the ending to this was fucked.</br>  I like bittersweet endings.  <br> Already saved <br>I'll have to read it again.</br></br>  <br>Ah I totally remember this, yeah it was a good one.</br>  <br>I wish 3D women were capable of love</br>  I like the "how the fuck are those two together?"  Still mad.  Ending in pregnancy &gt; Everything else  I've never been a fan of sad endings regardless of medium. But for hentai, bad endings don't really seem to feel right. One moment you're fapping, then the next moment you're supposed to get feels?<br><br>Then again, I prefer vanilla stuff anyway.</br></br>  <br> Not wanting to blow your load in a well of depression and heartbreak <br>Vanilla indeed.</br></br>  <br> it's a nigger baby <br> yfw <br>also gonna check this </br></br></br>  I see this thread calls for a reposting.  <br><br>I'm black so I actually would find that pretty funny.<br><br>Might be why I like cuckold and adultery endings so much also.</br></br></br></br>    <br> mfw </br>      <br> Sense of values of wine <br>This entire hmango.

The goverment says "fuck you faggot you can only choose one of these grills", who is you eternal lover anon?  Cerea leaves giant baseball sized shits in a pile.  <br>Which three?</br>  You have 70 hours to name a loli more autistic then Renge-chang from ãNon Non Biyoriã.  <br>chug chug</br>   it's a Renge episode   <br> from ãNon Non Biyoriã. <br>there aren't even that many characters in non non</br></br>  <br> it's another Renge episode </br>  She's seen some shit.  <br> He's fast! </br>  This one ?  Fake city girl  Chino  Hotaru is kind of gay. Maybe it's just my imagination.  <br>that`s not loli, is kirino 2.0</br>    <br/>      <br>its a creature</br>  <br> Renge-chang from ãNon Non Biyoriã </br>  <br>She's not autistic, she can talk with other people normally and she does not stack up or line up objects like most autists do. Her behaviour type is called a damn child. Have you ever seen a child, anon?</br>  You.    Why does Renge get TWO ahoges?  <br>Yes, unlike you it seems.</br>  this girl is most autistic<br><br>all she does is cry</br></br>    Do you know about Hinamarsuri? i think the main girl is most autistic main character ever.  <br>The only real Autistic loli in this thread.</br>  <br>Fucking mental is not autistic.</br>  Was Renge molested?  <br>Which loli has the most autistic cunny?</br>    <br>naice</br>    I:&lt; = ren-chon  <br><br><br>Sorry, I haven't met much autistic lolis.</br></br></br>  <br>Weeb lolis are cute as fug</br>  C'mon oniichan, lets go for a swim!<br><br>Take of your shirt, lets see those muscles!~</br></br>  Somethings wrong with this loli!<br><br>Somebody help!</br></br>  I think i found a loli more autistic than renge  <br>Is she a hikki?<br>She looks fat  she's cute </br></br>  <br>Everything about that image hits too close to home.</br>  <br>Is that a NEET loli?</br>  <br>Neat*</br>  <br>Not loli</br>  <br>creature?</br>  <br>Hakua is a legit Autistic loli ?</br>  Why are there only loli characters in these types of shows?  Can someone explain to me how Shirou became this badass in life? It makes no sense for him to go from shit mage weakling to this.  He beat Gilgamesh.  <br>He's the MC and Nasu needed a dumb plot device.</br>  does anyone know what timeline archer is originally from?  Just a random Fate question, don't want to make my own thread...<br><br>Was Saber stronger in life than she was with Shirou?<br><br>Like she mentioned not being able to use her abilities a lot because of Shirou's lack of mana.. Was her own mana in life sufficient for her to use Excalibur? I can't imagine a non mage sustaining that attack.</br></br></br></br>  You make a contract with the world to fulfill your desires and become a badass, in exchange your soul become part of the throne of heroes in another plane for all eternity.  <br>Saber was being weighed down by Shirou. When saber was Rin's servant she had her full power back.</br>  <br>But Saber's true power is with Shirou. Saber with Avalon is better than any of the other Sabers.</br>  <br>What about Saber when she was alive and had Avalon?</br>  Would you watch dubs if they were all as good as bebop?  Bebop is one of the few dubs I enjoyed watching. The voice casting was mostly spot on. Maybe it worked well since the show had a sort of western theme to it anyways. Dubbing doesn't work for SoL, comedies and other moeshit though. English VA's just can't seem to pull off those exaggerated emotions well. Also a lot of jokes and phrases sound awkward or get lost in translation.  <br>Just about all of that was shit. Shirou sounds like a giant nerd, Rin just sounds like a complete bitch. Only good ones were Saber and Kirei.<br><br> Probably because I watched Fate/Zero dubbed. </br></br></br>  What show is dub &gt; sub?  <br>Honestly, no. I'm autistic about things being the way they were originally intended, so I'd prefer the original voice acting.</br>  <br>Well, at least they got Crispin on it. Bad news is he's the only one who sounds like he knows what the fuck he's doing.</br>  MY SIDES.  <br>Yeah and this idiot messed up bigtime lol</br>  <br>Did Japan bring civil tech with them ? Are they going to teach the natives how to use modern industrial equipment ?</br>  <br>Hearts and minds</br>  <br> We got freedom shit all over and vomit it on anyone we see. <br><br>Because it's true, If the JSDF was as powerful as us then I wouldn't mind. At least have the other nations kicking butt with them on equal ground would be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>heh</br>  I just had an idea. Obviously since Goku has battled the God of Destruction he's going to be fighting some big time people in Super. Beerus says "Before creation must come destruction." It follows that if there is a God of Destruction there is also a God of Creation. What if we've known the God of Creation the whole time? What if Nameks found a way to channel part of him through themselves into artifacts using themselves as a catalyst? That would explain why Elder Kai took one look at the Namekian shaman items and said "Put those shidibbles away! Those are fucking dangerous you niggles!"</blockquote>]
