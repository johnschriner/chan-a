It's shit!</br></br></br>  <br>Oora!</br>  <br><br>So none of those girls in that pic are waifus?<br>Wow!</br></br></br>  <br>Shitty image to use as a reference. Better off posting the massive "everyone's waifu was drawn" delivery at the beginning of that one weekend</br>  <br>Requesting Misha getting bullied for being a dirty reyvatail.</br>  <br>That's not really a decent reference either. Just head to the archives to look up the first WWD thread of the weekend</br>  <br>They're all waifus. orz drew them a couple weeks ago.</br>  <br>Draw my waifu  Ryai </br>  <br>Counter requesting Misha, embarrassed, apologizing for how shit her husbando is.</br>  <br> Haremshit <br> waifus <br>Just say "anime girl of your choice" instead of limiting the pool for shit that doesnt even qualify</br></br></br>  <br>I think this is a safer route to go<br>Pretty sure all of those are waifus.</br></br>  <br>What was your email again? I asked you about some gamework a while back and I lost your contact info.</br>  <br>There's something about the way 34 draws that I don't really like but I'm not quite sure what the problem is.</br>  <br>Most of them are waifus, then.</br>  <br>Which one are the real waifus?</br>  <br>well the ones they deliver for the waifu threads are usually unfinished/unpolished and it shows in some of them.</br>  <br>Again, why bother limiting the pool?</br>  <br>All of them except Mishafag's harem, I'd wager.</br>  <br>I don't think it has anything to do with that, but it could be. They just don't appeal to me, I suppose but it's just my opinion.</br>  <br>who cares if they are real waifus or not, just draw the characters you like</br>  <br>It's not the weekend, so this is actually true</br>  <br>Most of the time for me it's the eyes and lack of depth in the coloring. There's always this tint or filter that I'm not a fan of. I find the lineart more appealing most of the time.</br>  <br/>  <br><br><br>Hey, is me. I was wondering whether you got around to finding that pic  I don't know how to reference posts in the archive ;_;  I'm glad it found it's way to you.<br><br>here's a wip of bassoon weapons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean it sounds minor, but when you consider they're mainly painted works without much lining its a bigger issue. unfinished edges really detract from the overall piece when you don't have lines to show the form.</br>  <br> Minigun <br> Bazooka <br>HYPE.

This let's me practice weapons/instruments anyway so we'll see how this goes </br>  How do I into twintails? I can't seem to get it. I get long, short and pony tail, but twin tails are tricky.  <br>That gief<br><br>Requesting Takeo dressed as Zangief and Yamato dressed as Chun-li being unable to hit each other in a fighting game.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn she looks buffed.</br>  <br>I think the left side is hidden a bit more cause as is it looks like if you viewed it from the front it'd be asymmetrical</br>  <br>I'm crying<br>For gods sake  ;_; <br><br>I absolutely love you, thank you so much. It's looking really good. I have no words, they get almost no fanarts</br></br></br></br>  <br> not using volumes for hair <br><br>There's your problem.</br></br></br>    Earrings are cute! Draw cute earrings!  <br>We need more hoop earrings on waifus.</br>  <br>I hope you mean medium size hoop earrings.</br>  <br>I don't know how big mediums are to you.<br><br>As big as hers is my ideal.</br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I should say max, actually. Those are slightly bigger than I originally thought.</br>  <br>That would be great to see, but I know that it will never happen.</br>  <br>Its been months, you still haven't improved?</br>  <br>Those are on the bigger side. A little smaller and they would be perfect.</br>  <br>When I read hoops I think of the one's black people wear</br>  <br>I believe I made some improvement over that Kuroneko. I just told you, I'm having trouble with twintails, I'm fine with other hair. Screen of some hair practice a few days ago.</br>  less than 3 days remain. Is your request ready?  Requesting a badass fatass.  <br>I'll just repost my request from last weekend.</br>  <br>I'll wait to see what another waifufag will do</br>  <br>being a badass requires physical activity. Which is antithetical to being a fatass.</br>  <br>Scum of the highest degree.</br>  <br>It never is.</br>  <br> part doesn't even line up <br><br>Maybe more practice?</br></br></br>  <br> Thought of what might be a fun request <br> Complicated. </br></br>  <br>Going back and forth between wanting to see her dressed as Hestia and this </br>  <br>Depends</br>  <br>I'm more concerned if Boa's coming back today.</br>  <br>Miiafag?</br>  <br>Of course. There's always room for improvement.</br>  <br>What's happening in three days?</br>  <br>I'm not gonna lie, I'd give up requesting next weekend if I could get a drawing from Boa.<br>That is everybody's dream, isn't it?</br></br>  im so envious of other artists. <br><br>help</br></br>  <br> I'm not gonna lie, I'd give up requesting next weekend if I could get a drawing from Boa. <br>If only you werent so full of shit. Not once has anyone actually fucked off</br></br>  <br>Draw you fucking faggot.<br>Make your envy work for you.</br></br>  <br>I remember I did on Easter Weekend<br><br>I feel you</br></br></br>  <br>But if I did fuck off though?</br>  <br>I do it once in a while tho.</br>  How's that idol collage coming along?  <br>I fucked off two weeks ago.</br>  <br>idol collage?</br>  <br>I have a request ready. Hopefully the drawfags will like it and do it.</br>  <br>I'm always ready</br>  <br>An anon asked for 12 waifus and has been working on it since last week, his last WIP was of Miia a few days ago.</br>  <br>I'd give up requesting for a month if 34 give me a colored delivery</br>  <br> tfw came up with pefect bait for a certain artist <br> another requester changes their request to alike thing later <br> the bait works but for them </br></br></br>  <br>Trying to bait twr?</br>  <br>There is no if, you wont. You will make your presence known even if you dont usually do so.</br>  <br>34 isn't worth a month. Sharkbro is worth a month.</br>  <br>I'd still fuck off<br>But she wont do it. I know she won't.</br></br>  <br> waifu is in there  <br>Feels goooood</br></br>  <br>Sharkbro was apparently worth waiting half a year.</br>  Requesting Melona and Haruka having a butt and/or boob battle, please!<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128410916 <br> diagonal formatting wasn't maintained <br>dammit ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sharkbro is worth a month <br>This. Getting a sharkbro delivery is like acquiring the holy grail in my eyes.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh man someone actually remembered.<br>Progress has been slow, because I haven't been putting a lot of time into it, but it will eventually be completed..</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have an idea for a request, but I worry that it might make people lose respect for my waifu.</br>  <br>I think it was only 3-4 months when he opened up for direct request<br><br>I can only wish he chooses her without direct requests</br></br></br>  <br>Don't.</br>  <br>I think scum collage is a better term for it considering people quickly requested to be in that one directly after another one</br>  <br>maybe this will help, it's what I try and do</br>  <br>I'm eagerly waiting to see her drawn!<br><br><br>Cry me a river, slowpoke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>I have no idea what to request.</br></br>  <br>You want to know what respect means in these threads? Not a god damn thing.</br>  <br><br>Reminder that these are the people you are drawing for .</br></br>  <br>personally I'd prefer a fully done orz or doom drawing.<br>but they don't spend that time for wwd deliveries so sharkbro tops there.</br></br>  <br>Two things here.<br>One is that the head is 3D, with sides and such. With twintails, the start of it is generally on the side. In a 3-4ths view, one side is visible. In your drawing, you have the twintail coming from the back.<br>The other is flow (which I've just learned about and has helped me tremendously with hair). Left face is fine, but right side isn't. Basically, hair would't just flow down like normal if she has a ponytail. The hair would 'flow' to that twintail point, at the side of the head.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the worst place in the world, no one has respect for shit here.</br>  <br/>  <br>I might finish this later in the week</br>  <br/>  Is requesting waifus in these threads bad form ? I'm new to drawthreads and don't know much.  <br>My original request wasn't done. I guess I'll request it again</br>   tfw no cintiq   <br>She looks great in there, can't wait to see the rest of the girls added in as well.</br>  <br>Yes. Only post your waifu if a drawfag requests waifus to draw.</br>  <br>Damn, not OR but that's damned cute.</br>  <br>ponytail, twintail, wouldn't. Fuck. I can illustrate it if you want, but I'm bad at drawing myself.</br>  <br>It's better to request exclusively in the WWD.<br>You can do it but people will call you out for double dipping. If you do it too much, your chances of getting her drawn will significantly decrease as people will start seeing her as a nuisance.</br></br>  <br>I really wish that you hadn't just required waifus, but anime girls in general when you asked for characters to be in the collage.</br>  <br> cintiq <br>What is this? Requesting an expert to explain this meme to me.</br></br>  <br>Mia is mai waifu.</br>  <br> meme <br> not taking 3 seconds to google it <br>its basically a screen you can draw on made specifically for arts.</br></br></br>  Requesting Nico receiving a birthday gift from Solid Snake please. Snake ref inbound  <br>You can't even spell her name properly.</br>  <br>Mine too.</br>  <br>I did google it but I didn't see anime so I didn't care. Thank you for answering without making fun of me.</br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>That never stops Mishafag. Just request anime girls next time if they ask for people in the general. It will always be the same handful of people for every collage if you dont anyway.</br>  <br> Solid Snake <br>for what purpose</br></br>  <br>He's right, though.<br>I mean, if a guy's gonna request his waifu, he should at least spell it right.<br>I know I do.</br></br></br>  <br>counter requesting nico  riding  a horse  around a ranch </br>  <br> Not in the first row when 34 was actually still trying <br><br>Feels bad man</br></br></br>  <br>I already suggested a character already so it's fine.</br>  <br>I asked for waifus because I was eventually going to post the finished picture on the weekend.<br>I apologize if I've caused anybody grief.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, I wont hold it against you.</br>  <br>Well, I'm in it, but I'm looking forward to it. I'll be looking forward to that future weekend excitedly.</br>  <br>Whose in it?  I'll let them know they have a delivery coming </br>  <br>Not him but I love it when people post helpful stuff like this.</br>  <br>*Who's</br>  <br> I'll let them know they have a delivery coming <br>What, how ?</br></br>  <br>Just be aware that the people you are drawing for are scum that will just move onto the next collage instantly.</br>  <br>She should be aware that you're an autistic talentless child who spends his nights crying about free art on the internet, too.</br>  <br>He's mediocre at best. There's better options out there.</br>  <br>But this is Boa we're talking about.<br>One of the Silent Heroes of the dr/a/wthread</br></br>  <br>Draw some  futa yuri please. </br>  <br>The people that requested their waifus know their waifu is in it.<br><br><br>pic related.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Mediocre is mediocre. It's no different with Rori.</br>  <br>Have a WIP, I'm going to colour and shade it now.</br>  <br> Rori <br>Wait. I must be an idiot, but I've seen this often.<br>Are Rori and Lolyfag the same?<br> Can't be. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Boa still gave me one of my favorite deliveries</br>  <br>Nice!</br>  <br> that face  <br>perfect</br></br>  <br>Just calling it like it is.<br><br><br>No.<br><br><br>I'm happy for you, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hanging out </br>  <br>fucking neat</br>  <br>No, Lolyfag goes by Rori(fag), the nip pronunciation of his trollwhore, to annoy people.</br>  <br>Hanging out could mean anything</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks!</br></br></br>  <br>Snake ref <br><br>I just like Snake and Nico, especially together</br></br></br>  <br>So...Rori is NOT the alter ego of Lolyfag.</br>  <br>My second favorite delivery is from CB and while I won't call him bad he's got a long road ahead.<br><br>Favorites don't really mean much skillwise, an artist of any calibre can draw a favorite-worthy delivery if they stick to what they know.</br></br></br>  <br>Rori is the drawfag who pretty much always does cute-lewds of loli-esque girls, Lolyfag is a shitposter.</br>  <br>Yoooo anon that's what's up, preach it. I'm glad you like one of my deliveries that much! Definitely do have a long road ahead of me, I can't do much besides paint birds or draw simple generic poses and cute girls</br>  <br>cute, i need to learn how to draw lolis.</br>  <br>You a  cute! </br>  <br> preach it. <br>I'm gonna smack a bitch.</br></br>  <br>I have no excuses for taking forever, and forgetting the bikinis.<br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly? You'll probably get a pass from the OR.</br>  <br>just saw these on /i/, was waiting for you to post this.<br>very fucking hot, number.</br></br>  <br> I haven't gotten anything from CB yet </br>  <br>Shit, I mean </br>  <br> no balls  <br>You had one job.</br></br>  <br>hot as fuck</br>    <br>You need to do more big dick futa</br>    <br>Wow. An entire set. I think I can forgive the small oversight. Thanks a fuckton man. Got a little bit everything good in there. Can't wait to see what you do next.</br>  <br>Have you requested from me? And if so pls remind me, I'm really forgetful with stuff like that</br>  <br>As long as that futa dick is inside a loli, second.</br>  <br>Nah nigga you gonna get smacked.<br><br><br>Yooooooooo<br><br><br>Yo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  CB is easily one of my favorite drawfags. He called my waifu cute and generally has good taste in animu girls.  <br>Melonafag?</br>  <br>CB taking requests is fine but do some randoms too, it feels way better not vulturing. Even though, you know, I did.</br>  <br>this looks like a real fucking anime WIP<br>i havent even looked at the porn im impressed with the line work</br></br>  <br>Depends on what you're working right now</br>  <br>Alright here you go anon, I hope you like it.</br>  <br> im impressed with the line work <br>What? The linework is extremely sloppy.</br></br>  <br>Always gotta be a nigga to rain on an artist's parade.<br><br>It's usually another artist too, is the sad part.</br></br></br>  <br>to my weak eyes it looks professional<br>all the colors<br>guess im easily impressed</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I know, I do randoms in the WWD. I'm only asking now because that's not for a while and if the opportunity is right there, I don't mind direct requests. That's a good point though, I don't like to be a vulture either.  who? <br><br>Nothing atm, I think I'm gonna do BB next? I don't remember which other ones were direct requested except for uh Kobori, gotta do her too.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not raining on their parade, I didn't even respond to their post. That anon is just deluding himself into thinking the linework is anything but sloppy because it has pretty colors like anime cells.</br>  <br>i third this, but only if that futa dick is on the loli.</br>  <br>You'll get to her eventually, she's cute enough</br>  <br>I tried.... sorry<br>also sorry for the bad coloring</br></br>  <br>Good! Cute girls are my favorite</br>  <br>Wait, you want a loli sticking her own futa dick into herself? Or do you want two futa lolis having sex with each other? I'm confused.</br>  <br> both sound good.  futa loli is great.</br>  <br>it's looks decent</br>  <br>Well yeah, but you gotta be specific.</br>  <br>OR here, this pleases me greatly!</br>  <br>I'm guessing you are a beginner? So if it's alright with you, I'll suggest a few things. <br>There are a lot of white spots between the lines and the colors. It looks as if you only selected the areas, used the bucket tool to fill them in and didn't pay attention to the details. <br>The shading also still needs lots of work... I recommend putting a layer on multiply mode above the color layer and shade with a color like purple or blue (depending on the drawing's atmosphere of course, but you got neither a background or lightning in this picture so those will do). As they are now, the shadows make the picture look flat and really unnatural. <br>I'm not the person who requested the coloring by the way.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Who? <br>Blue border.</br></br>  <br>Ooooh, mega cute.</br>  <br>honestly they're in the right. we don't want people saying something is good when its not, its breeds complacency and makes the artist suffer. compliment the subject matter and things that are improving.</br>  <br>CB make little Chronoires!</br>  <br>That's great, I'll be finished in a moment.</br>  <br> I'm guessing you are a beginner? <br>Yep.<br> There are a lot of white spots between the lines and the colors. <br>I'm using GIMP, so I select by color and delete white to make the lineart transparent. I'm assuming Photoshop has a better way around this, but I've put off reinstalling it for so long I'm not sure I remember how to use it anymore. Either way, the OR can always request until someone of higher caliber colors his waifu.<br><br>As for the rest, I'll keep it in mind when I color again. I appreciate the comment, thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tried a different style for this one. <br>sorry it's just a sketch</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128415893 <br> Stealing Youkofag's identity <br><br>You are the worst shit, you are the worst smell.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128415893 <br>I can believe yes, Rori seems cool.<br>Lolyfag has seemed like an awful person upon first seeing him.</br></br>  <br>for somereason I thought it was monster onesie not lizzard.... my bad sorry</br>  <br>A lazy, easier way to work with lineart is to just use a layer for coloring below the lines layer (with the lines layer set to multiply).</br>  <br> much always does cute-lewds of loli-esque girls,  <br>one day rori will draw my waifu. one day...</br></br>  <br>Just ask him directly, I'm sure he'll do it.</br>  <br>That's adorable.<br>If you're here this weekend, consider my waifu, please!</br></br>  <br>My software of choice for coloring (or drawing in general) are paint tool sai and clip studio paint (or manga studio 5)<br>They're relatively cheap (or easy to crack, whatever you prefer) and are much easier to use than photoshop. <br>If you want to have really good results, these or Photoshop are the ones to use but do yourself a favour and don't stick to GIMP. <br><br><br>Also, this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Rori only likes best girls </br></br>  <br>That must be why he drew my waifu, even though she isn't a loli.</br>  <br><br>Thank you anon, I appreciate it<br><br><br>I feel bad but would it be really alright to re-request a color?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here you go.</br>  <br><br>Alright, I'll check out all of those and see which one I like best.<br><br><br> I feel bad but would it be really alright to re-request a color? <br>Do it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks nice but I think the mouth looks off. The omitted part of the line is usually in the middle where the top and bottom lips press together.</br>  <br>how would I know who you are....</br>  <br>Which of them?</br>  <br>Can you add a bow?</br>  <br> Oh wow! My waifu is not there! </br>  <br> 4 hours later <br>Jokes on you. She is in there.</br></br>  <br>Anatomy and proportions need some work but I really dig the coloring.</br>  requesting Ushio in her swimsuit being embarrassed  and possibly in a lewd or uncompromising situation   <br>Too bad she's stained by Misha's juices.</br>  <br>I don't get why you guys hate Misha so much.<br>Play the fucking games, man, they're great. And Misha's pretty damn cute.</br></br>  <br>You will feel our strong connection.<br> Or you could just draw Louise in open toed heels if you want~ </br></br>  <br>How's the anime?</br>  <br>They hate Misha because she's associated to the drawthread's resident haremfag, which is a damn shame.</br>  <br>sure, to Tomoko or Cirno?</br>  <br>We don't hate Misha<br>We hate Mishafag.</br></br>  Requesting Eto warping herself in these bandages preparing for her next work/mission.<br><br>If you wonder how she's looks like: http://i.imgur.com/1XNxoCH.png</br></br>  <br>The OVA? pretty mediocre, actually. Way too short, too.<br>It being mediocre might be because I've only ever been able to find the dub.<br><br>I don't think that should matter for the character, you can hate the requester and still like the character.</br></br></br></br>  when and how did we find out about mishafag's harem?  <br>I'm not sure, now that I think about it. Technically it's part of Cirno's costume so it would go on Tomoko's head? But Cirno is more identifiable with the bow on her own head</br>  <br>Both of them, but especially the right. <br>You have the thickest darkest part of the mouth in the middle, it should be at the sides with the lightest part in the middle.</br></br>  Requesting more girls wearing this type of frilly bikini  <br>At first it was just catching him posting the wrong girl's reference with requests, then one based day he got banned for something and all his recent posts got [DELETED] so now we have the full list.</br>  <br>I fell asleep</br>  <br>dat ass</br>  <br>Boa draw my waifu again.</br>  <br>And that seals the week for me, thank you Boa<br> I really should have mentioned I wanted a frontal view but oh well </br></br>  <br>Oh baby</br>  <br>Do me a favor and go away</br>  <br>Yeah but the problem that if someone that's not mishafag posts Misha they'll get attacked immediately.</br>  <br>I didn't want a drawing anyway  ;_; </br>  <br>Rekd</br>  <br>I tried both but it looks better on Cirno</br>  <br>Great work Boa<br> But he asked for a negligee </br></br>  <br>H-hidoi ;-;</br>  <br>Damn, this is really good.</br>  <br>art looks familiar</br>  <br> And then anon realized that even Boa, one of the Seven Saviors of the dr/a/wthreads, has his limits. </br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br>I draw here every now and then so you might have seen me before.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I love your faces and hair. Got a blog?</br></br>  <br>Someone color this!</br>  <br>I've got a Pixiv;  <br><br> Cirno's lips <br><br>I feel the urge to defile them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has anyone actually tried coloring Boa's stuff? <br>It does not look like it would lend itself well to color, maybe just flat colors at most.</br></br>  <br>I remember there being one colorfag that tackled a lot of Boa's stuff</br>  Can I get Ishidou Natsuo eating a hotdog with mustard and wearing a Bad Brains shirt?  <br>I forgot the picture.</br>  <br>Any examples?</br>  Requesting a laughing whores version of the Paladin and Dark Elf from Bikini Warriors please.

Kuri.  <br><br>Why does she try to kill Bozes? That makes no sense.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't ask me, I only read the manga.</br></br>  <br>She's jealous because she's inferior as a woman.</br>  <br>Jealousy makes women do stupid things.</br>  <br><br><br>How is she jealous? Did she even like him?<br><br>Wouldn't that still mean she's raising another woman's child?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those aren't ears - they are "rape handles"<br><br>You know, so you don't fall off while riding them...</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she did like him and yes women are crazy like that.<br><br>Didn't you ever watch Mexican soap operas when you were a kid anon? Those were common plot lines.</br></br></br>  <br> Didn't you ever watch Mexican soap operas when you were a kid anon? <br><br>No, I got fat and played a lot of video games.</br></br></br>    <br>That's why they're archers.</br>  <br>Wait, someone still watches/reads that shit?<br>Outbreak Company did the same plot in an orders of magnitude better way and with the bestest girls.</br></br>  <br> Elves <br> making good anything except sex slaves <br>Laughingdwarves.axe</br></br></br>  <br>Throughout the entire series, she's unable to get a man who wants her, even though she has big tits and is quite willing to settle down. Her being able to beat up other males only further scared off potential suitors.<br><br>So when Bozes is finally proposed to by her lover, she snaps, thinking she could take her place as lover, wife, and mother.<br><br>At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if she managed to tame a wolfman (being that she's also worthy of being an alpha female) or minotaur (she has the bust to attract them) and take them as her husband. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if she outfucked and tamed an Orcman for a husband.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You again? It seems your autism knows no bounds</br>  <br>Outbreak Company did the same plot because it copied Gate's fights like beating a red dragon with a panzerfaust.</br>  <br><br>Please tell me Bozes can put up a fight. I don't mind shorty being strong, but steamrolling everyone in single combat is kind of flat.</br></br>  <br> she's unable to get a man who wants her <br>Tomita wanted Kuri?<br>Also Kuri fell for Itami in the webnovel so she might be joining the harem soon.</br></br></br>  Rory is the best girl.    <br>Rory is sex.</br>  <br><br>That really doesn't show much.</br></br>  <br>I don't think a knife vs a sword would mean steamrolling. Plus Bozes is a knight so it might be more equal than you think.</br>  <br>It'd be hilarious if Kuri did fall for Itami like in the WN. Moreso if she managed to wrestle him down and sex him (with Rory jumping in at some point).<br><br>Tomita is fine too.<br><br> Though now that I think about it, it's time that we got a female JSDF soldier getting a male mate from across the gate. All the pairings thus far is JSDF Male / Gate Female. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rory has the end game win.</br>  <br> I don't think a knife vs a sword would mean steamrolling. <br><br>You've seen what she can do, she can.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That she is.</br></br>  I find it weird that magic and their powers work in our world. Would that imply that our world also has magic but it is a lost art?  <br>Misconduct towards a superior officer :<br><br>Using violence against a superior officer<br>Threatening behaviour or communication to a superior officer<br><br>Max. sentence at Court Martial :<br><br>10 years' imprisonment<br><br>But hey she's a female, it's not a big deal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic use is genetic.</br>  <br>Maybe. we have our own demigod as well, except he was nailed on a cross and people don't believe him</br>   Reminder that this will never be animated   <br><br>They're just going to let her off for trying to kill Bozes, aren't they?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1284 <br> superior officer <br><br>Zorzal?<br><br>I wish he was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a very good reason to have mages trapped in tubes</br>  <br>he's never going to find love, is he?</br>  <br>Speaking of that Considering the fight Itami had with Flame Dragon. He took a lot of damage which was directed to Rory. Does that mean Itami is now invulnerable? </br>  <br><br>Wouldn't you think there'd be a point that it'd overload her capacity to self-heal?</br></br>  <br>Highly doubt it, she will just feel the pain he's feeling.</br>  <br>Made me wonder if he'll even age now.</br>  <br>Can't really do that. You can cut Demigods into hundreds of pieces and they'll still heal back together. I guess there might be a limit on the damage that the contract can transfer to Rory.</br>   Spoil me on this, why does the gate close in the novels?   <br><br>can anyone spoil me on this?</br></br>  <br><br> Kuri goes full retard when Tomita proposes to Boozes, and challenges her to a duel. <br><br> Rori stops it. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Had to be closed due to instabilities in both worlds, earthquakes etc. However Lelei opens a new one 4 years later that can be opened and closed at will. </br>  <br>Well, this guy is a Jedi so is not big deal</br>  <br><br> Is it 4 years here or 4 years there? Chose a side, dammit </br></br>  <br><br>Must be nice living in the forest though, those ears must be great for hearing things.</br></br>  <br>Which girls has sex with Itami in the WN?</br>  <br>*had</br>  Lelei  <br> Either way its a 2 month difference, so doesn't really matter but since it's told from the other world's PoV I assume it's their 4 years. </br>  <br>1 year in gate 4 years on earth</br>  <br><br><br>M'kay, thanks</br></br></br>  What is this  <br>granny panties, you sick fuck.</br>  <br>well played sir.</br>  <br>Weren't the years in their world 389 days but the days a little bit shorter?</br>  <br>or great for having ants and bugs burying themselves into it while you sleep. during vietnam war soldiers had rub their ears with insect repellent before taking a nap to stop nasty bugs from going in and fucking up their ear drums.</br>  GATE's, mangaka drew the anime version of Rory in his style.  <br>Looks better.</br>  <br>to be perfectly fair, the artist who did Gate manga wasn't that good of an artist. the anime version looks better drawn overall, even if the style isn't as agreeable to some.</br>  <br>I was about to post that.</br>  <br>wait what?<br>that's how the novel end?<br>i need more spoilers on this shit,so it closes, then what? the end?</br></br></br>  How much slavery was there in the Holy Roman Empire (as opposed to the Roman Empire which was full of it)? The whole "yeah we took some slaves from you guys, what of it? You're not going to take any from us?" thing made sense in the context of "Rome" but I don't know it it makes sense her.  <br>It closes and the gaiden series starts.</br>  <br>Read the previous thread.</br>  <br> op doesn't have link to previous thread <br>okay..</br></br>  <br>the gaidens look generic as fuck and mighty lame</br>  <br>Any man would prefer a blonde drill ojou-sama to some generic shitty jap woman.</br>  <br>we're not doing generals this ain't a charity we're runnign here</br>  <br> I'm too lazy to check the archive, spoonfeed me plz! </br>  Haha, anyone else enjoy that the MC is such an otaku who loves cat-girls despite being a military officer? I know I do! The contrast between otaku and military is so hilarious! Lol!  <br>Picked up</br>  <br>Gaiden 3:  Itami becomes a dragon knight made stoic by Tuka so his fear of flying dragons doesn't appear to save a bunch of elves. She finds out that her dad survived the dragon attack and has harem and a new kid. Turns out the dad had amnesia and only recovered for a short time when Tuka and Itami arrived. He doesn't want to leave his newfound harem and family so Tuka leaves him there. <br><br>Not a novelfag just remembering what was said in previous threads</br></br></br>  <br>Given that many countries in the world practice conscription, a large amount of /a/ has probably had military experience, so I don't see you are point.<br><br>Also, I heard plenty of WoW stories from my superiors in the army.</br></br></br>  <br>Haha, because the MC being an otaku was the whole point of this story! Lol!</br>  <br>I like him more cause he's a stealth badass. I don't care about the otaku shit.</br>  <br><br><br>yeah that's so super duper crazy cause we all know that soldiers aren't allowed to have a hobby right?<br><br>are you guys like... 14 or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was being sarcastic you idiot.

Tens of thousands of women in one city raped and killed. When the woman were all dead or exhausted or too well hidden they started on little boys, but only because any male old enough to carry a gun had already been systematically executed. Japan denied everything not only while it was happening but even after film of the event was smuggled out.<br><br>There's a difference between one soldier forcing himself on a local and a conquering ground force systematizing rape on an entire population.<br><br>So like I said. If Japan tries shit like that again; and they probably will if they think they can get away with it, then it's just proof enough they can't handle being a militarized country.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what Worst Korea is for</br></br>  <br>Aren't they too busy with Best Korea.</br>  <br><br>Best Korea has a hard enough time feeding their people, let alone 'causing problems outside their borders.</br></br>  <br>Worst Korea too but Japan's bigger and better and likes us more.</br>  <br>They're all manlets. A nation of manlet.</br>  <br>Mainstream Japan doesn't deny the Nanking massacre. There just have been debates regarding to the number of victim. (The number of victim was massively inflated by the Chinese at the time for patriotic propaganda purpose, while post-war Japan downplayed the number to save some face). Only the crazy hardcore right wing Japanese netizens out right deny that Nanking massacre happened at all. Though needless to say, a lot of no-life jap otaku keyboard warriors deny it as well. But once again, they're simply not the mainstream.</br>  <br> Japan's bigger and better and likes us more. <br><br>Heh<br><br>No<br><br> Bigger <br> ROKAF <br> 630,000 Active with 2,900,000 Reserves <br><br> JSDF <br> 260,300 Active with 50,800 Reserves  <br><br>As for "better", I'd put a lot of Korea's equipment over the Jap's<br><br>F-15J &lt; F-15K<br>Type 10 &lt; K2 Black Panther<br>Howa Type 89 rifle &lt; Daewoo K2 rifle</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe those anons were making what you'd call "jokes". <br><br> /pol/ <br> actually knowing jack shit about absolutely anything <br><br>In practice the law changes relatively little and most of the new capabilities are completely reasonable for any country of scale.

His nationalistic shittery has a way of rubbing countries both regionally and internationally with shared interests, like Korea, Phillipines and the US, the wrong way even though they're all on the same page and his legislative strong-arming has made the moves even more unpopular that they already would be domestically in Japan. The changes themselves aren't even the problem on some level, it's just this general feeling that this is Abe and the LDP old-guard's pet project and that they're doing it for the wrong reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pfff, these pussies couldn't handle the sweden let alone the chinese.

Like for example if a series has vampires then it is to be assumed other nightmare creatures exist. If magic and gods exists in the GATE world then magic and gods exist in our world.</br>  <br><br>Normal tanks work just fine in Japan, they always have. Nothing about Japan's terrain is in any way unique to it. Mountains exist elsewhere, as do plains, cities, and forests. The Japanese "optimized" their tank a bit for their terrain in light of the fact it isn't expected to go anywhere else (and thus doesn't need things like desert operations capability and huge intake filters), but that doesn't mean that other tanks wouldn't function just fine in Japan.<br><br>Modern MBTs are by design supposed to function just about everywhere. Just look at other island nations like Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, all of which operate "conventional" MBTs (Leopard 2 and PT-91) just fine. The Leopard 2, Abrams, Challenger series, etc. were all designed to operate globally either due to a desire to promote exports (Leopard 2) or because their operators needed the ability to deploy anywhere globally (Abrams, Challenger). Korea, incidentally, has a fuckton of mountains.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe magic and gods were inspired by people who passed through the gate and back?</br>  <br>Serfdom was used extensively in the HRE, which was essentially slavery; you were bound to the land, and forced to work for the local lord.<br><br>Churches had massive power back then, and were given a share of local land for their own use.<br><br>It was a bad time to be a peasant, that's for sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I recommend you look up the rape of Nanking anon. <br><br>The peacetime Chinese government after world war 2 killed more chinese people than the wartime japanese ever did. Please also note the difference between war and peacetime for China. There's been a lot of anti-japan rhetoric by both China and fans of china ever since Japan refused to hand over some of its islands to China because they sit in an area where there could be deep sea oil. Some of the history rewriting has even occurred on wikipedia where many chinese rewrites had to be reversed.<br><br>China is quite unashamed with its various tactics as hypocrisy is not in its dictionary. For example, it tried to force its way onto the organization membership of nations that share arctic territory borders in order to secure fishing rights there. Currently, only countries which have shared arctic borders are members of the organization which meets to portion out fishing, navigation, and occupation rights. Obviously, China is no where near the arctic but that doesn't stop them from trying to force (or bribe) some of the organization's member nations into proposing China as a member.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I'm not agree with your reason, I agree with "re-bomb the fuck out of them" part. A-1 studio should be ground zero</br>  <br>In modern times, there is "wage slavery" but it is unlike older slavery models which tied people to land. The wage slavery model ties people into groups or classes of people. Of course, such people typically would live in certain lands that the upper classes don't live so in one abstract sense, land is still a factor.</br>  Elevens have become Westernized so much I'm not sure they could ever go back to the old Showa-era militaristic Imperialism.<br><br>It could happen, for sure, but it would take a long time for such sweeping changes to occur; you'd need at least a generation to reeducate the children.<br><br>Even with all their economic troubles and woes, the average person in Nippon still lives far, far better than they did pre-WW2. It would take some serious shit going down for things to change, and I cannot see that happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong century dude.</br>  <br>To add to that, type 10 uses a ceramic armor of some kind which JSDF claims more resilient than the standard Armour. I don't believe it till I see it but Japan did spend money researching on the topic.<br><br>Also type 10's design philosophy is different from K2. While K2 is designed to beat down enemy tanks head-on, type10 is designed to get them based on info from recon drones etc preferably before enemy get in the line of sight and either annihilate the targets or run away. <br><br>Name wise both K2 and type 10 are tanks but type 10 is more like a striker with better Armour and firepower that Abrams.</br></br></br></br></br>  But they can make awesome bros.  <br> Malaysia <br> island nation <br>It's a peninsula</br></br></br>  <br><br>All tanks with modern FCS are designed for battlefield networking. The Type 10 is not special in this regard, it just got a fancy video to promote the capability. In the US Army this capability is provided by cavalry scouts (the unsung heroes of armored warfare), helicopter reconnaissance, or via drone for units equipped with them. <br><br>Abrams has better armor than the Type 10, and almost certainly better penetration against likely threats. While people like to make a big deal about how the Leopard 2A6 has an L/55 gun and the Type 10 has an L/50 vs. the Abrams' L/44, the Abrams has much better ammunition as the US has invested huge sums in developing more advanced penetrators. This is why the US intentionally decided against using the L/55. Their ammunition is already plenty effective with the L/44 and the L/55 would require recalculating all of their ballistic tables and actually make the M829A3 too fast (its lower MV is designed to make it less likely to set off ERA on contact).<br><br>The Type 10 is impressive for what it is, namely an almost purely domestically-made tank focused on maintaining a low weight and high mobility. But it isn't an amazing wonder-tank, and at the end of the day, there are just no substitutes for mass. Those extra 10 tons of armor matter.<br><br>And Japan is no longer interested in building more tanks, their strategic doctrine is changing from expecting to repel a Soviet amphibious invasion of Hokkaido (which the Type 74 and 90 and to a lesser extent the Type 10 were designed around) to a focus on strategic mobility, using wheeled vehicles like the MCV rather than heavy tanks that are hard for Japan to deploy with its limited sealift capability. The threat is no longer a mass invasion but skirmishes in the disputed zones and islands against China. Tanks aren't so good for that role unless you're an Amerifat and have a whole fleet of ships designed to support them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what if she became Emroy's new apostle after rori.</br>  <br><br>inb4 Borneo.</br></br>  <br>That would actually fit her quite well.</br>  <br> COBRA COMMANDER </br>  <br>Are you joking?<br>Attach a short blade to each one of those ears and she will gouge your motherfucking eyes before you realize what is happening!</br></br>  <br>She'd be like 60 by then though.

Asuka is best.  <br>Gonna be honest here. The best serie since the 90's of eastern animation, aka, anime.</br>  OP here.<br><br>I'm in the second episode and still quite unsure, I see a lot of people saying that the end is absolute shit and ruins the entire anime.<br><br>Is that true?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watch the damn thing. Don't come back until you're finished.<br><br> Won't be long before spoilers start appearing. </br></br></br>  <br>no. the ending is excellent. it's part of what made the show so interesting. Then, when you pair it with the film, it's very satisfying.</br>  <br><br>honest advice, don't binge watch it.<br><br>it's probably asking too much these days to allow yourself one episode a night, but i wouldn't watch more than 3-4 at a time.<br><br>more than that and the pace of the show starts feeling off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The ending is fucking 2deep4u bullshit. Just stop at episode 24 and you will be a whole load happier.  Would you give her your love and passion?  Probably.  no, too horny  <br>Bah-dumm tshhhh.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>Fuck off Carlos</br>   tfw no crazy demon waifu to gag on your cock at your command <br><br>jdimsa</br></br>  but that isn't Lord Touch Me  <br>No.<br><br>I want cute dense meido, the ACTUAL main girl you know.</br></br></br>  Without a doubt.

What is this anime ever about.  <br>We need figures. One good thing about an anime adaptation. You get figures produced.</br>  <br> figures <br>I would take a Nendo or two just for adorable Skeleton and Crazytits.</br></br>  What's she gonna use it for?

But square milk jugs save space when putting a bunch of them in a crate.</br>  Is it bad that I dropped overlord first episode in because of the whole stupid dive MMO plot?   wasting a 5th and 9th level spell slot on 3HD City Guard instead of using Color Spray to down both. <br><br>Ains can not into Wizard powergaming. I guess it doesn't really matter when you can craft Pearls of Power.</br></br>  <br>Unless you absolutely despise that sort of story and can't enjoy it whatsoever, yes. Should have watched the first episode entirely before making a decision at the minimum.</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>"wasting"<br><br>He could probably cast that spell all day without his mana going down</br></br></br>  <br>Considering how overused it is recently, I wouldn't call you stupid for doing so.<br><br>However it seems like it may simply serve as a launching point. Whether where it ends up going is actually any good remains to be seen. It's honestly moving kind of slow.</br></br></br>  <br>FAKE<br>TITS</br></br>  <br>Or he could just retreat to his Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion and rest.</br>  <br>I did watch the first episode in it's entirety before making the decision to drop it due to the dive MMO. <br><br><br>Eh, I might read the manga and decide if I wanna go further with the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lowest level Maid <br> could still fuck up anyone she sees <br>a true Sniper with an actual gun is an OCP for a medieval culture</br></br></br>  <br>You should consider reading 2 volumes of the novel and decide after that. The manga really doesn't do justice to overlord.</br>  <br>Wow, Funi's 720p is even worse than I thought.</br>  <br><br><br>He's level 100. He doesn't even need to waste a spell slot when a wack from the Skeltal Staff would autohit on a 1.</br></br></br>   all these people saying they dropped it because it's another "mmo anime" <br>it's getting to the point where i cant figure out who's baiting and who is just taking second hand information to heart</br>  <br><br>He's got what, like fifteen minutes of straight casting 9th/10th level spells until he runs out of mana for the day? Might as well just cast Ray of Enfeeblement a few times and whack them with his staff.</br></br>   What will madhouse do to vomit-chan when she vomits? <br>I may discover my new fetish</br>  <br> Using the motherfucking guild staff to whack shit <br><br>Are you crazy?</br></br></br>  <br> hoarding almost 800 spells and not having room for a ass ripping attack <br>The fuck's wrong with you? Grasp Heart is hardly a waste.</br></br>  <br>No, just boneheaded</br>  Episode 3 saved this series for me.  <br>That's a good thing. Flat is best for vampire loli.</br>  <br>I'd give her my D that's for sure</br>  <br>First he had to use his good instant death spell because he didn't know how NPCs worked. Some random knight could be a level 100 warrior for all he knew.<br><br>Then he picked a level 5 spell, which I agree was still too high, but Ainz is obviously risk averse.</br></br></br>  <br>He had no way of figuring out how strong they were excepting by trying to see what killed them.</br>  <br>No, I don't want our souls to let go.</br>  Grasp Heart is a Save or Die, and a Save and suck.<br>you fail the save and instantly die, but you pass and you take massive damage and are stunned.<br>there's a reason that it's Ainz favorite spell.</br></br>  <br>I want to commit a cirme.</br>  Didn't albedo have a sister?<br><br>I'm talking about the "real"most powerful guardian.<br>The Secret guardian and the MC's personal bodyguard<br><br>You know the one all the other guardians are terrified of</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck this is amazing.<br>This is literally the greatest power fantasy that I've ever experienced.<br>WORSHIP ME</br></br>  <br>Albedo a cute.<br><br>I'm an animefag but want more, is the manga or light novel better?</br></br></br>  <br> sullying the guild staff </br>  <br> rocks a sexy practical armor <br>That's Anime original, her actual armour is extremely bulky and completely conceals her figure.<br><br><br>This studio really keeps letting us down with the adaptation. I mean where was the fear in the faces of the sisters and villages. They were suppose to be literally cowering, while pissing themselves. There faces barely had any expressions.</br></br></br></br></br>  I heard something about martial users what are those?   Albedo's sexy armor that's completely covering her <br>That was nice. REALLY nice.</br>  <br>Guilds only have 700 character levels to make their guardians with, so everybody's pretty much accounted for.</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>But people are not terrified of her because she is strong, but because she was made as a horror. Like, horror movie-kind horror.<br>Momonga says he freaked out first time he saw her.</br></br></br>  <br>Mang, the LN made my imagination go full throttle.<br>I didn't sleep for 2 days just because I enjoyed it that much.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, except Finger of Death is a Fort save. Most SoD or SoS spells are Fort saves which is bad as Fort is usually the highest save a monster will have. Leave the damage dealing to the gish and dumb meatshield.</br>  <br>Basically melee skills.</br>    <br>If you enjoy the anime you will likely enjoy the LNs too. They're very close to the anime but LNs have some more details.</br>  <br>Yeah basically <br>you'll see next episode I'm sure.</br></br>  <br>Rubedo and Nigredo are different characters</br>  <br>MC's personal bodyguard?<br>I don't remember that</br></br>  <br>They're supposedly something that didn't exist in the game. If you're reading 'The New Gate', you can liken it to the 'Arts' from the series. Also martial arts don't use mana they use something else. Ainz is curious about them but they're pointlessly weak.</br>  That knight scene was more brutal than I was expecting from this kind of anime  <br>What kind of anime were you expecting?</br>  why no one likes her  <br>because is a best grill</br>  She sucked Gendo's penus  <br>cool</br>  cos shes all for me :)  <br>Because she's shit.</br>  <br>I like her</br>  Is Rei still the most popular character in Japan or did the rebuilds ruin her?     The anime industry is cursed forever thanks to Rei and Asuka <br><br>Thanks a lot.</br></br>  <br>I-i-i-its not like i wanted to curse it forever or anything!<br><br>BAKA ANON!</br></br></br>  <br>she has no style</br>  <br>she has no grace.</br>  <br>a doll? haha no</br>  <br>I was thinking about that, actually. <br><br>Eva is not only a pretentious shit story, but also fucked up everything to the day. If we used to have good stories with great characters, thanks to this garbage now we have the obnoxious faggot MC, the retarded tsundere and the doll girl which doesn't actually matters. <br><br>Thanks Eva for fucking up everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because everyone likes her.</br>  <br> being this insecure </br>  We've been over this. She is lifeless and emotionless. Rei was outright DESIGNED to be creepy and unappealing, and yet retarded otaku decided to sexualize her anyway.<br> Asuka was designed to be unappealing too, btw. you're all a bunch of retards. </br>  <br>I don't think so</br>  <br>This. There's only one Evangelion character who was designed to be appealing.</br>  <br>ffs, can't you reifag autismos keep your powerleves confined to one thread<br/></br>    <br>What?</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>It's not Anno's fault that nothing will ever be as good as Eva in the industry ever again.</br>  <br>Asuka sucked Kaji's dick so it's okay</br>  <br>Kaji is hotter than Gendo.</br>  <br> le reverse bait <br>No effort here.</br></br>  <br> good as Eva <br>Did you miss the part where I explain why it's horrible and fucked things up in the industry?</br></br>  <br>It's true though.</br>  <br> why no one likes her <br>People clearly have no taste.</br></br>  <br>Even shittier bait.</br>  <br>He's expecting the anon to name the "one Evangelion character who was designed to be appealing"<br>And then for all the shit to break out.</br></br>  <br>Wait, who is he talking about? I'm genuinely confused.   Is it the K word?  </br>  <br> bait </br>  <br>Bait.</br>  <br>It's Kaji, yes.

I believe that masochists go to Asuka. And, there is a tendency for women of the same generation and people who are children mentally to go to Misato. </br>  <br>Sword fights in the tent.</br>  <br><br>I like her OP, she is very reipable.</br></br>  <br>Manly things like hunting, fishing, and taking manly cold baths in the lake together.</br>  <br><br>I think its the opposite way</br></br>  <br><br>And taking manly dicks in their manly ass?</br></br>  why no one likes her?    <br>living the dream</br>  <br>A Rei is fine, but Asuka a best girl</br>  <br>Asuka a shit</br>  <br>Who's that behind her?</br>  <br>your taste a shit</br>  <br>No anon, you like a shit tsundere.
