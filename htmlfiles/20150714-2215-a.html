Meant the OP.<br><br>Anyway, maybe I'll give the second episode a shot and see how I feel. It was at least very comfy.</br></br></br>  What i like about Shirayuki is that she has both "meek and submissive" and "stronkk women" mode.<br><br>I.e. she is not one of those "i`ma feminist independent rude woman!" types you can see from time to time in manga, but rather knows her place, acts meek and quite when needed - and then switches to "get explosives in your face and kick in the balls" mode, and then back - not being too righteous or holding grudges.<br><br>The tree branch that bends to a degree, and then hits back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>beautiful, there's no wp version?</br>  I love the disdain on her face  Would you really want to be a Japanese schoolgirl?  Yes.  <br>I already am.</br>  <br>OP you don't understand!</br>  <br> 30 year old NEET with no friends or a future <br>Even if I don't get my yurilicious SOL new life, I don't think it would be worse.</br></br>   he is not a little girl   God Eater Episode 1 thoughts?<br><br>Firstly I would like to say the animation looks really weird and not weird in a good way.</br></br>  <br><br>The game itself is the most boring, generic shit ever, but the first episode managed to make it actually look personal and interesting. It was well-directed, had a good atmosphere and a decent amount of well-executed action. The visuals look fresh and personal. I don't get what's to hate? Different doesn't mean "horrible" by default.</br></br>  <br> "I have just notice this is not a slice of life or comedy anime." <br><br>you would be correct</br></br></br>  <br>Besides the curry nigger, there has been almost no "edginess" the entire episode.</br>  <br>So this is what happens when Ufotable has a good director helming a show. The differences are like night and day between Hirao and Miura. One of the first things that struck me was during the opening sequence, the use of jump cuts accompanied by this harsh static sound. It gives off the feeling of pain to the audience through sound so as to match the trauma felt by the main character. There's ample use of match cuts through this opening segment so as to give the feeling of continuity to these flashbacks in that for the main character, it's just one big memory leading up to the hard black cut and him being tested which signify a new set of memories. <br><br>Of note is how there isn't a clear shot of the main character's face until he passes the test and is named which could signify two things in that it's a sort of throwback to the game in that he's some nameless thing until solified by the player or that for the commander, he wasn't worth viewing or naming until he passed the test. In fact the first clear glimpse at part of his face is his mouth which not only works to confirm his determination but also is probably a reference to the God Eater name and the mouth his weapon later can morph into. Not to mention when the audience gets its first clear glimpse at the main character, the camera zooms first out of his eyes so as to reaffirm his personality.<br><br>One thing I was going to criticize the show on was how dead the military base seemed to be in regards to activity, however that turned out to be a plot point. Hirao used a number of long shots to show how empty the location was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judging from the pic alone, I'm guessing it's like Garden of Words but done wrong?</br>  To Love-Ru Darkness manga and anime have the best drawn female bodies. You can't prove me wrong.    I don't know what you mean by best drawn. If we're talking realistic then that's a definitive no.<br>If we're talking the bonerific, then yes, Yabuki has perfected the art of drawing ecchi goddesses.</br>  Lala&gt;Nemesis&gt;Momo&gt;Yui&gt;Nana  If this is a To Love-Ru thread...<br>How am I supposed to watch these Darkness OVA's? I'm about to start Darkness but I've been told at least the first OVA came out first.</br>  <br>erm don't quote me on this, but I think you watch the first OVA, then one after every 4 episodes, but it doesn't matter a huge amount, the OVA are basically side stories of fap material.</br>  Pic related, Katanagatari  katanagatari did enough talking for all of us  <br>nice one</br>  <br>heh</br>  best girl won  <br>Best girl won.</br>  It's like I'm watching Nanoha A's all over again.<br>I hope we get cartridge-fueled fisting.</br>  <br> I'm already   drinking beer, watching anime, and game all night <br>Me too...</br></br>  <br>Yamato damashii</br>    <br>Dead mom.</br>  <br> all night <br>You're doing it wrong. You're supposed to sleep at night.</br></br>  Summarize your life in one page of manga.    <br>It's a really cute vanilla h manga though</br>  <br><br>Since google doesn't give anything useful..:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/640459/835e49<wbr>b974/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon whatever you do I love you.</br>    Hey. Dumping some supernatural shogi manga. It looks like those who died a heroic death are chosen for a shogi tournament, or something. 2013, ongoing.          </blockquote>]
