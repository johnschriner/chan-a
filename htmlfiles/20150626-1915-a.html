[ PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]  Only eight days left until the first episode.  I need a thread to deal with the unbearable excitement until it airs.   What's Carol's goal? Destroying the moon? Calling the Custodians? Getting rid of the power of song and Symphogears?       http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/phara.php  You can't do anything! Symphogeeaaaar!  </wbr>    What are you doing Symphogeaaaaaah!!    Should I expect QUALITY? Later episode of S2 were terrible.     That must either be when she's sitting on her throne or when she's about to use her danmaku shit on Bikki.     Oh, I misunderstand its meaning. this  is correct answer.    When was the last time you cried during an anime?   You cry when you see shit?    I want to hug you too, anon. Too much fucking drama     Hah, I need to check this out. Looks like this 'Anne Frank' girl has waifu potential.    What?   I cry intermittently and without warning when watching Aria. Nothing particularly triggers it, the tears just fall out of my face.  It's like an emotional hypobaric chamber, and all my sadness, anger, and frustrations just boil to the surface.    I found this:  http://www.kaga-create.co.jp/saki/i<wbr>ndex.html</wbr>     AI Mahjong   Start in North Seat   Get Chiihou tenpai, get hype as fuck   Suddenly, West scores a Renhou from South's discard   Well, actually the game doesn't recognize Renhou so the winning hand was actually a plain tanyao but still.   And I never played AI Mahjong ever again          If you mean that someone won while you had a yakuman hand (implied by ippatsu tsumo) then riichi ippatsu tsumo because of the ippatsu yaku.  Open tanyao is a valid strategy to win a round quickly and to prevent that another player wins a big hand.       Which is more annoying when you have yakuman tempai?  How about choosing the wrong wait, only to see what could've been the winning tile spill out in front of you?     Subscribed to your mahjong blog   Anyone ever gotten a junchan + sanshoku?  Have you watched the greatest love story ever told yet?  I did indeed watch White Album 2, and am still waiting for the coda to be animated.   Thats not Golden Time picture..    No sorry. I don't watch meme shows.   Yes   Is this actually good?   I am going to marry Takao-chan!  What is "that"?   Tama a cute    When, suddenly--   I'd impregnate a Takao-class from below   Dat one gif series     An anon said a while back he'll do the guidebook. Is there any progress yet?  A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.   Brilliant.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]       Asuka ponytail  I still have mixed feelings about her but now I'm definitely aroused.      the description of the scene is that they fell asleep during practice. And the entire page is dedicated to the duet episode. It's probably one of those "it happened but we didn't show it" artworks. Kumiko has the hairband because she always puts up her hair for concerts, and they were practicing in the concert hall.       Well, it is the closing of three consecutive productions for KyoAni. With this many ADs on board here's hoping for a really well-animated performance. It would be great to have back-to-back episodes with cool animation highlights.   Is Rebellion better than original Madoka?    hidamaris     crossover when?    kevin is kill tho    i killed kevin because my waifu is better than his    poor kevin.   Beware, having a bad waifu like Sayaka can kill you.     Do someone still remember we once liked this manga?   Not anymore after the mangaka made the shitty sequel, though         Final Fantasy characters/10      Old Thread:   ITT we post a character without actually posting them.  I'll start with something easy.       one of the Initial Ds       Arnold?    super easy mode   momoka-sama   In the end, does this count as yuri or not.   That kid wants to aggressively /ss/ badly.   I don't think I understood what happened.  Why did he go back in time to start the loop? what about the cat, who is he?  Also, I am probably forgetting about this but do we know who was the one possessing the army general?     Oh right, thanks. So Rabura and Ito knew who he was because Yuta told them about Qmay, then?     Why did he go back in time to start the loop?  Because someone had to go back in time to make sure all this works out right. The Yuuta at the end is probably the only Yuuta who will go back in time to do this, since that area is out of the loop. He's just making sure it happens correctly.  what about the cat, who is he?   Reincarnated Yuuta  Also, I am probably forgetting about this but do we know who was the one possessing the army general?     They overheard Yuuta's entire story when he was telling it to Meika.             who was the one possessing the army general  Qmay    New episode Soon   Read the manga, faggot.    I will after the current season ends.   Which one should I download, and is the 1080 just an upscale?     That's just Bestgirl, anon. Don't worry about it.    Read the manga you colossal faggot         Well tanikaze finally gets his true waifu.   How many of you /a/nons are going to Anime Expo? If you're thinking about going  JUST DO IT    Autists everywhere   Overpriced shit everywhere   Smells like sweat and antiperspirant   Cringeworthy Cosplay everywhere   Shittaste everywhere   That was my first and last experience with Conventions. You never know true autism until you went to one. Before that I thought /a/ was bad but holy shit was I wrong. Thank god there was a Bar nearby so I could get shitfaced.  Thanks for reading my blog.            I actually bought a ticket for the UBW concert.     Whore yourself   Last time I went to a con I had like 8000 fat ugly neckbeards following me for my boypussy. Never again.   Where do I subscribe?    I've only been to one and had fun buying fanmade posters and random small merchandise like mystery box nendos.      omoshiroi     Why would someone do that? Just lean a bird up against a wall and have other birds poop on it's back?      Just lean a bird up against a wall and have other birds poop on it's back?     I'm sure it's bleeding internally after that so it probably died shortly after    hello darkness my old friend   What wicked plans have she conjured up?  What was yui saying at the end when the music went all dark and shit? Was she bullying Yukino because Yui was able to give her cookies first?   Can anyone translate this  ?    Post a proper pic faggot.    She was about to transform herself into Haruno.    You're getting meme'd. We freaked out for a little bit but the ship was salvaged by 8man himself.  That and I think except for assholes lke that guy and a couple other false-flagshits, both Y-fag ships have hit comfy seas. Service Club is gonna be maximum happiness no matter who wins.     Get in http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87    More importantly, its about what the User wants before he gets Requiem.  Polnareff didn't want to die so his requiem allowed him to switch bodies. Giorno wanted to beat/erase Diavolo and so Diavolo is dying (infinitely) .       Kars. People tend to forget that DIO is just a vampire and Pillar Men absorb anything that can't use Hamon as soon as it touches them. However this is only assuming The World has the same properties of its user too, and Kars can't really do much against a timestop other than just tank it.  tl;dr Ultimate kars would win      no it's not Kira got stabbed the arrow a second time, and gained a new ability on his existing stand Reqiuems are created when the stand itself is stabbed by the arrow     Dio could freeze his body to counter the hamon which would otherwise move into his body and affect him. Do you think that would work against whatever the Pillar Men secrete to absorb their food?  Either way, even DIO can't kill ultimate Kars, so I agree with you on that one.    <br/></blockquote>]
