[ Let us discuss the perfection that is Anya.  And we can talk about the other girls too, I guess   <br>Waiting patiently for that long deserved episode, A-1.</br>  <br>Rather than Anya lets talk about summer cakes.</br>  <br>Kaede time?  Kaede time. </br>  <br><br><br>It's always Kaede time.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never hear Anya say "Cheeki breeki" in that cute voice of hers </br>  Momoka on friday  Going on onsen excursions with Kaede!  <br>Don't mind both of them, they're both God-tier CGs<br><br><br>I want to listen to those rolling R's everyday for the rest of my life</br></br></br></br>  <br>Going to the bar with Kaede!</br>  How do I get into this? Should I play the games or watch and read the anime and manga first? I'm very interested in some of the girls.  <br>Going commando with Kaede!</br>  <br>What does this faggot cat's expression mean</br>  <br> Can you read moon and have access to an Xbox 360/PS3? <br>There's im@s 2 and OFA, if not there's always the manga and anime. Unless you're talking about the Cinderella Girls in which case there's not much but a manga, 4komas in Danbooru and the anime, if you live in Japan and/or have access to a japanese phone number then you can play the game.</br></br>  <br><br> You'll never play STALKER with Anya while speaking Russian with her <br><br>Why live?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Going to shower with Kaede!</br>  <br>That Anya daki seems like such a good idea now.</br>  <br>Did someone say Anya daki? I want an Anya daki!</br>  <br>Too lewd, I can only say it's made by this guy</br>  Is she okay?  <br>Agreed. Anya needs clothes to be comfy.</br>  Looks like another Kaede shitposting thread. <br>Not even changing the OP deflects these scumbags.</br>  <br>I don't know, she was only wearing a singlet here and probably bed shorts but she still looks mad comfy.</br>  <br>go back to your Rin containment thread</br>  <br>Miku doesn't even make the best cat<br>She's great when she's normal though</br></br>  <br>You mad anon?</br>  <br>Well Miku's schtick is she tries to use a character to represent her idol self when her idol self is Miku Maekawa.<br> And Anya's the rockman of CG. </br></br>  <br><br>I can't wait for all the Dooky suffering and anons rejoicing when she makes her comeback and BTFO of StepmotherP.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I want to marry Kaede and make her a mother</br></br></br>  <br>Be sure to make lots of mini-Takagaki for me.</br>  <br>Dooky suffering will be the best.</br>  Anal. <br><br>Which was the first idol that came to your mind?</br></br>  <br>Nozomi</br>  <br>Your mom. It reminded me of last night.</br>  <br><br>I want to make Miyu a certified MILF</br></br>  <br> wanting an ayy lmao baby with alcohol syndrome. </br>  <br>Kiyomi. I think she needs to relax a little before she wears herself out from stress.</br>    <br>I don't get it, this still makes me prefer Kaede.</br>  <br>Either way, Saori Hayami has a heavenly voice. What of it?</br>  <br>it's oky if you donf get it<br>but but those who so, わかるわ</br></br>    <br>Is Nana Iroha?</br>  <br>8/10, I smiled but no giggle outta me.</br>  <br>The highschool days where P was an asocial, philosophical prick, Kaede was a flat unfluffy bitch and Anastasia was a boy.</br>  <br><br>Hugs and headpats for Minami.</br></br>  <br>Giant head, tiny hand.</br>  <br>Big heart</br>  <br>you forgot about KWSM thirsting for the P</br>  I want Syuko to turn Anya into a bad girl.  <br>I want Anya to turn Syuko into a good girl</br>  <br>Why so mad /a/ here I can put Rin with Kaede.<br><br>Even with Rin's slutty school uniform; still looks fluffy when Kaede wears it.</br></br></br>  <br>keep that hobo minx away from the Tsarevna</br>  <br>Rin looks like she belongs in the Manson family in that getup</br>  <br>It's the artist, the soft brushing and coloring makes it look so.</br>  <br>Too late.</br>  <br>Here is a genuine smile.</br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>It's never too late.<br><br><br>TakanASS</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is conflict in those blue eyes<br>She knows better</br></br>  <br>She will succumb to sweet temptation  Just like Sae. </br>  <br>Here's another genuine smile</br>  <br>Even Minami failed to convert her, the result will only remain the same</br>   skipped a grade and studied abroad at an American university <br> loves Tobasco and puts it all over her pizza <br> has a smell fetish and loves the aroma of young girls <br> creates her own "pheromones" in a garage <br> likes staying up late <br> is skilled at disappearing  <br> adorable nyahaha laugh <br> enjoys suspicious scientific experiments <br> wasn't initially scouted by producer, but actually approached him first to use him as a test subject <br>When is this perverted genius cutie going to make her anime debut?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> loves Tabasco <br>And you were so close to selling me on her too</br></br>  <br>Oh, come on. It's far from the best spicy sauce out there, but it's still surprisingly good taste for a Japanese girl.</br>  <br>sriracha is the superior sauce</br>  <br>I agree, but Shiki is still love.</br>  <br>while it makes sense most American hot sauces probably don't make it across the Pacific Ocean, I wouldn't call settling for Tabasco in a country where gochujang, sriracha, and chili oil are commonplace "good taste"<br><br>She just needs to be educated is all</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. She's a curious girl, so it would be easy to introduce her to the good stuff. She could probably make her own hot sauce if she tried too.</br>  Looks like the Anzu equivalent of that Kirari Wedding Strip.<br><br>Translator anon, if you're there. Please do.</br></br>  <br>Ichinose brand hot sauce<br> It's just her pussy juice </br></br>  <br>I'd put that on my pizza.</br>  <br>but sriracha is just a meme sauce</br>  <br>Primaryfags or Secondaryfags, please enlighten me.<br><br>Does Anzu ever go dere (for Producer or her fellow idols)? Does she always act like a no good not-really-NEET lazy cunt?<br><br>I can imagine all of the other Project girls having a tender moment or two, but the only thing I see Anzu doing is going "fuck this shit" and sleeping in some corner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can I get some of this<br><br>Anzu gets broken</br></br></br>  <br>She does, actually.</br>  <br>She gets Mind broken.<br><br>She does genuinely enjoy and have fun working post-character development.<br><br>Not that she'll say it out loud though. Gotta keep up her NEET image after all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>odd<br>she doesn't look like an ugly little shit in the later cards<br>Is this the power of the P?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, she still would rather take it easy and have little to no work actually.<br><br>But it would be a lie to say that she doesn't enjoy what she does. Ever so slowly, that business smile of her is becoming a genuine smile.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really find a hard time imagining Producer having a moment with Kanako and Anya, those two are way too independent of him that I can't find a situation where they can bond without forcing their character out the window.</br>  <br><br>Tabasco... it's one of the most famous hot sauces due to age and brand recognition. Being a Lousiana style sauce it's uses fermented vinegar and is focused on heat instead of flavor.<br><br>Sure, I'd be even more impressed if she made her own Habanero or Carolina Reaper hot sauce, but that last one would be suicidal on the scoville scale.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that butt peek is not erotic and she doesn't look amazing on second card altogether </br>  <br><br>I'm torn.<br><br>Part of me wants an episode of classic AnKira hijinks. But part of me also wants an episode where TakeP makes Anzu live her life correctly and drags out a genuine egao from her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both can still happen on the same episode, 20 minutes is a long time. A-1 just has to sacrifice having NG on screen which isn't a big loss.</br>  <br>They definitely won't sacrifice anything for Anzu.</br>  <br> TakeP makes Anzu live her life correctly <br>This is not justice.</br></br>  <br>This is where everything backfires.<br> Producer promises that the Anime focus won't be based on popularity   which was an obvious god damn lie <br> Anzu is the second most popular CG <br>Must suck.</br></br></br></br>  Soon...<br><br> yeah, probably not this card in particular, but whatever. </br></br>  <br>That's a cute team</br>  <br>An Anon in the previous thread suggested a stargazing episode with Producer and Anya which I think would be really nice</br>  <br> Some boys dream of being Heroes of Justice <br> TakeP just wanted to give people genuine smiles <br>GARcher is old and busted<br>TakeP is the new hotness</br></br></br></br>  <br>A true hero.</br>  <br>Honestly, even in the games, Kanako is kind of flat, even when compared to the other CG girls. <br><br>Her character is basically Haruka but everything else but her love for making sweets is removed. Also, she became fat. There hasn't been any substantial change or notable introspection into Kanako's character.<br><br>Anastasia is an airheaded romantic. Not in the filial way, but in the classic connotation. In the games and Theatres, we see that she is quite thankful for Producer. Anya is honestly pretty friendly with everyone so she meshes well with most people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to be based on overall popularity.</br>  <br>It'd be more entertaining than what she does now  ie: nothing </br>  <br>I want to see her eat a ghost chili.</br>  <br>that's probably why she is doing very well compared others, she got some nice popularity boost when they changed her tone but I guess it's not enough.</br>  <br>Most normalfags I've talked to regarding that found her to be the most eyecatching of the bunch, she's arguably one of the most popular even within CG as a whole, but as the other guy said, anime focus isn't based on popularity.<br>Apparently, anyway,</br></br>  <br>What "experiments" does she do exactly?</br>  <br>I'd imagine that to be put into a NOMAKE, with Producer pointing out constellations and Anya naming them, much to her glee.</br>  <br>Whatever catches her interest and keeps her entertained. Shiki doesn't need petty things like "ethics" or "moral boundaries".</br>  <br>What about the crazy French girl with the awful voice?</br>  <br>Reminds me of this old pasta<br><br> Anya's focus episode <br> Love Laika is fairly popular now <br> Big Live upcoming with Love Laika performing in it <br> Minami injures her leg in a Lacrosse match <br> Anya must perform alone, thankfully she has a new solo song; You're stars shine on me. Management decides its a good time to debut the song. <br> Anya freaks out at the prospect of performing alone <br> TakeP tries to reassure Anya, asks her what are things that she likes <br> Anya mentions Zvezda and shit <br> Concert finally begins, Anya starts singing You're stars shine on me. <br> JUST ALIVE HOSHII-- then suddenly the concert lights shut off and the crowd switches their glowsticks into a pale blue <br> Anyavision sees the crowd as a starry night sky. <br> TakeP: Keikaku Doori <br> Anya is now slightly wetter for TakeP <br><br>Well, this pasta was made before episode 13, so I imagine that they can't pull the "Minami is incapacitated" card again. Still, it's not that hard to set up a situation where Anya would be nervous and so Producer will have to take measures to calm her down. The "glowstick = stars" shtick is a crucial part of Anya's romantic character so if she's getting a focus episode, I imagine they'll play up this part of her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fred's voice is cute, just like her.</br>  <br>While they didn't show it well, they did hint that she was nervous during their first ever performance, she quickly got over it too. Her independence is what loses her screentime I guess.<br><br><br>Her singing voice is decent and her speaking voice is pretty cute with the "fu~fu~" stuff</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's batshit insane</br>  <br>Anime Focus is Scamco trying to make Rin be Chihaya 2.0, except she's not<br> I like Fukahara, but Rin just doesn't do it for me </br></br>  <br>And I love it.<br>Wouldn't have her any other way.</br></br>  <br>Fukuhara herself is great and I can tell she's trying her best, but Rin isn't my cup of tea.</br>  <br>That's because she had Minami with her.<br><br>Going solo might freak her the fuck out.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you like cake or loli or russian hookers or dookie?</br>  <br><br>Fukuhara is actually insecure about her singing and the marketing of scamco of Rin as Chihaya 2.0 really puts alot of pressure on her.<br><br>When she received a fan message where the fan said that her singing was great, she ended up in tears.<br><br>I fucking hate Rin, but Fukuhara is a good person.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin looks so genuinely happy here that she actually comes across as pretty cute</br>  <br>Why's Kaede hanging out with those losers?</br>  <br>I'm an Eyedol kind of guy, but Anya is my absolute favorite regarding that.<br><br>But really, I like all the CG's. Don't get me wrong when I say Rin isn't my cup of tea, I like her but she's not close to being a favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>More than that, when the fuck did she bleach her hair?</br>  <br>Gold eyes &gt; *</br>  <br>going by<br>25+ christmas cakes<br>20~24 various assorted non seasonal cakes <br>16~20 cupcakes and fancier sweet breads<br>12~16 cookies, biscuits and confectionary<br>8~12 cookie dough<br><br>my predilection would be<br>Cakes for waifus<br>L@lis for daughterus<br>Cookies for imoutos<br>Sweet Breads for nieces (with a few exceptions that would make me take responsibility)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recognize 22 out of 24.<br><br>Okay, thats enough CG for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>I like Mika's wild copper and Kanae's seductive gold, but Anya's mystical aqua does it for me.</br>  <br>Probably isn't fair that some of these use SR and SR+ that put more detail into the eyes.</br>  <br>Whose eyes is that at the bottom right?</br>  <br>Kiryu Tsukasa</br>  <br>That was the one that stumped me as well.</br>  Fumi is the softest and comfiest idol<br>Even her voice fees like a warm quilt on your ears</br>  <br>Fumika and Kaede have the most soothing voices by far.</br>  <br>I found great comfort in Fumika, Kaede, Anya and Sae's voices.<br><br>I just await an album featuring all four and I die happy.</br></br></br>  <br> Anya is honestly pretty friendly with everyone so she meshes well with most people. <br>It's because of this that I look forward to seeing an episode to her, she's almost too perfect that I want to see how A-1 would go about developing her.</br></br>  Rina a cute.  <br>My three favorite girls.</br>  <br>Cute, trashy gyaru slut.</br>  <br>Meant to quote the other post, but my point still stands.</br>  <br><br> cute <br>yes<br> trashy  <br>meh I've seen worse<br> gyaru <br>hell yeah<br> slut <br>probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's way better than Yui, but I still like Mika the best.</br>  <br>Come on man, Yui is great.</br>  <br>What makes her better than Rina or Mika?</br>  <br>Never said she's better, but as opposed to Rina and Mika's gyaru, Yui's just a playful girl who loves her freedom. While the three have great chemistry, you can't really compare her to the other two since they have different themes.</br>  <br>Yui is pretty damn gyaru.</br>  <br>What the fuck happened here?</br>  <br>Kirari</br>  <br>Brainwashing via high concentrations of HAPPY HAPPY NYOWAS</br>  <br>She happened.</br>  <br>Thou shalt not sexualize the Kirari!</br>  Worst girls in their respective series?<br>Worst girls in their respective series.</br>  <br>Best 765Pro and a great 346, I don't see the problem here.</br>  <br>halfass google translate go!<br><br> DEREMAS <br> Anzu manga <br><br> Futaba-san, what's wrong? <br> Sorry P... <br><br> I got cut with the costume clothes hanger <br> [(the glove) got bloodied too] <br> and we're still in the middle of a (photo) shoot... <br><br> (is) the costume designer... <br><br> I'll take care of the costume somehow <br> [(his) hankerchief...] <br> we should get you to the infirmary quickly <br><br> mou... and so the foolish child goes on.. <br> ? what was that? <br> [it will take too long to get to the infirmary for a bandage] <br> ...I said "I thought this would be a restful/easy job" <br><br>Mindbreak complete, Egao has assumed direct control</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takane is great, fuck you</br>  <br>Anon with worst taste?<br>Anon with worst taste.</br></br>  <br>Takane is pretty boring but Rank is fucking great, mate.</br>  Rin is 2cute  <br> if you live in Japan and/or have access to a japanese phone number then you can play the game. <br>He can still play the game without a Japanese phone number.<br><br>It's just that he's locked out from features like trading, which is basically 3/4 of the fun of game itself, being able to acquire idols you like rather than what's forced upon you by RNG.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kiryute a best.</br>  <br>Unverified pleb here.<br><br>I may not get the cards I want, due to my lack of ability to trade, but my Dooky Puchiderella already gives me plenty of joy.</br></br></br>  Hard facts about life:<br><br>cake lovers also all old fags.</br></br>  <br> mahou shoujo <br> character trope </br></br>  <br>Is this the Jesse livermoore idol who made millions trading stocks?<br><br>We need more financial idols.</br></br></br>  <br> Gyaru consistently that low <br>Nothing makes me angrier</br></br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>People usually associate Gyaru with sluts and most people like their waifus to be pure, there's really no surprise here.</br>  <br>They should also associate their taste with shit.</br>  <br>I don't know, considering Tomboy is the most popular I'd say they have great taste.</br>  Cute as tits!  <br>Nah, ojous and bu/kaichous are were it's at.</br>  <br> ojous and bu/kaichous are were it's at. <br>Same guy who likes Tomboys, but you my nigga.</br></br>  <br>Sir, I too respect your taste despite our differences. perhaps someday we will met at common ground some some sort of tomboy ojou-sama.</br>  <br> tomboy ojou-sama. </br>  <br>An ojou-sama that likes the meddle in martial arts?<br>An ojou-sama that would prefer fancy pants and shirt to frilly dresses?<br><br>Nothing's impossible</br></br></br></br>  I love mushrooms  <br> cowtits <br>You're not drawing my idols correctly!</br></br>  <br><br>She will fill out one day</br></br>  <br>I'll fill Syoko out. <br><br>With my semen.</br></br></br>  Literally 50 hours left.  <br>The poll obviously was done before the Jougasakis were introduced.</br>  <br>Maybe, buy gyarus underrepresented in anime.<br>You only see those gonk yamaba gag characters.<br><br>When are we gonna get a Gyaru-ko anime?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Modern kogals are different to early 00s blacker than the night gals.

OUT.</br>  <br>I bet she blasts Linkin Park during sex.</br>  <br>Pretty funny how every time Anya gets sweet moments like this it falls flat by the end thanks to Ranko.</br>  <br>Rude bitch nigga.</br>  <br>It's Scamco's way of saying "Hold on, we can't have other idols be cooler than Rin"</br>  <br>Still one of the most comfiest CG theaters.</br>    <br>Too moe.</br>  <br><br>Goddamit Ranko.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if Anime Anya will ever be half as romantic and deep as her mobage self</br>  <br>Anime Anya's job is to be cute, comforting, and clueless</br>  <br>Doubtful. The mobage versions are there to rely on you and will be more affectionate for that reason.</br>  <br> Clueless  <br>Granted, she's been able to understand most of what's been going on, and even some cases where everyone else didn't, going to give her credit where it's due, she's an absolute sweetheart.</br></br>  <br> It's Scamco's way of trying to make Rin cooler, but we all like what we like and will not be swayed, no matter how much they pimp her out. <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>I imagine she'd be an Avril Lavigne kind of girl.</br>  <br>so, she blasts Nickleback instead of Linkin Park?</br>  <br>Iori is the anal idol</br>  <br>It's amazing how Kaede can pull off any outfit.</br>    <br> cool cat <br> Rin </br></br>  <br> Rin <br> cool cat </br></br>  <br><br>You guys more into dogs or something?</br></br>  Bunny Rin is best Rin  <br>I'm more into exotic animals.</br>    UzuRin?  <br>What about it?</br>  <br><br>You called?</br></br>  <br>I don't really know what idols are but why does this cow have such big fat tits?</br>  <br><br>I want to sexually FUCK Rin Shibuya.</br></br>  <br>Calm down, Uzuki.</br>  <br>Rin is a pretty girl.</br>  <br><br>How much yuri is there going to be in season two?

She's a baka for sure.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/wK65ScKbIsg?t=1m59<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Finally someone with taste.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/vhGK2293IGA?t=2m32<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Bottom's up <br><br>As expected of Kaede</br></br></br>  <br>Iori a second best.<br>She's also kind to everyone.</br></br>  <br> lori side boob </br>  <br>The more I see of her G4U Model, the more I realize how well done her face is, especially when put side by side with the others.</br>  <br>Really? Don't misunderstand me but I honestly think that Uzuki is much better looking on that specific image you posted. Anya feels off or something.</br>  <br>Uzuki's model is spot on, but it's only a surprise on Anya's end because she's not the easiest to replicate into 3D.</br>  <br>I always though G4U Anya looked a lot prettier in 3D.</br>  <br><br>I like what they did with Ranko</br></br>  <br>That makeup was a nice touch</br>  <br><br>I really like Ranko's makeup.</br></br>  <br><br>I can tell they're trying really hard, but the uncanny valley is still there.</br></br>  <br>It amps the sexy but Ranko's better being cute.</br>    <br>That's the stuff</br>  <br>Ranko is the best when bullied.</br>  So much Ranko I'm drowning in darkness.  <br><br>Ranko is best when cockblocked</br></br>  <br>And crawling in my skin</br>  Karen is surprisingly cute.  <br><br>Am I the only one who wants to bully Ranko until she becomes depressed and develops an eating disorder.</br></br>  <br>I know what you mean. I'm starting to warm up to her a lot more after getting her SR+ card. Her voiced lines are adorable.</br>  <br><br>That is what Kanako is for</br></br>  <br>Hopefully she gets a decent amount of screen time in season 2. I want to see her in a hospital.

I don't watch this show, why does everyone hate the blonde guy?  <br>Sensei is not a Christmas Cake.</br>  <br> Yukino only likes 8man platonically. <br>But it's true, look at her affirming their friendship by looking him dead in the eyes without blinking.</br></br>  <br>Can't you read?

If she's leaving for her third year her final request will be for 8man and Yui to take care of the club for her.<br><br>Yui is head over heels for 8man but she's going to get rejected. It's going to be painful and entirely 8man's fault for not being genuine about it sooner and instead leading her on with ambiguously weak resistance.<br><br>Iroha may or may not win but will not get any focus either way because she's not a main character.<br><br>Sensei will marry someone by the ending, probably a rich eccentric.<br><br>Hayama will get a girl in the end no matter what happens.

Does she even have a career in mind? Most of the time when there is that sort "I pick my career over you" type of ending the is a well established career she has been thinking of for awhile or she is already doing her job.</br></br>  <br>cute</br>  <br> Iroha may or may not win but will not get any focus either way because she's not a main character. <br>Nice stealth irohafaggotry in your boring copypasta.</br></br>    <br>Yukino's entire character revolves around her uncertainty in choosing a path in life AKA her career. How is that not "well established"?<br><br>Her leaving to pursue a career of her own is incredibly obvious at this point as it would resolve her entire dependency/identity issue in one fell swoop.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha will win  Tobe   Ebina simply interested in any relationships. </br>  MEME THREAD<br>MEME SERIES<br>MEME FANBASE</br></br>    <br>Ebina said she isn't looking for one "right now".</br>  Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1.

Yes! 5 wasn't boring that was GoGo!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're probably too busy doing the Gopri movie right now.</br></br>  <br>I get the two mixed up. Which had the best character AKA Miss Pic Related?</br>  Erika is the only one I need.  <br>GoGo! Which sucks because it's so boring compared to other seasons and on top of that it barely focused on the plot which wouldn't be a problem except Smile! also barely focused on the plot but that series is actually entertaining/good.</br>  <br>Nah. GoGo is great.</br>  <br>That's a lot of opinions stated as fact in that run-on sentence that continues going on for a lot longer than one would expect based on normal grammar conventions which we typically try to adhere to on this website even though its pretty clear that you're not making a whole lot of effort to do so or to keep the quality standards of your posts above any sort of standard deviation of post quality while the rest of us are over here using real punctuation in our shitposts.</br>  <br>I won't say anything about Smile, but Gogo was all about collecting randomly appearing things and taking care of the Kings. There was plenty of plot with that, plus the deal with Coco and Nuts becoming kings themselves, plus Syrup and his double-crossing. Then there were the villains who were in a corporation again with Bumbee trying to find his way and Anachondy or whoever falling for the big bad and what effects taht had on their organization. It had oodles of plot.</br>  <br>Smile is cool because even though the plot resets half way through the individual episodes hold up due to the strong personalities and characterization on both the Cure side and the Bad End crew.</br>  Stop arguing and post NICE pics instead!  <br>Okay.</br>  <br>Okay. Who would you rather be in this situation?</br>  <br>Honestly I don't know why anyone is expecting plot in these shows. GoGo and Smile were both good as plotless precure shows. GoGo had at least a couple of episodes that would just be just later redone in Smile, usually not as well executed. <br><br>GoGo was actually more entertaining than Yes5 itself in my opinion. But it had a 10 episode period where I did want to give up. Oh well, better than Max Heart's 45 episode period of that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No! My favorite season is better than your favorite season!</br></br>  <br>The one holding the lovely Haru, of course!</br>   the person who wrote the lost magical frog, santa, first onpu's dad episode, onpu's mom episode, seki-sensei's boyfriend, nishizawa bonding, momoko goes to the tv station and the hana's adventure episodes also wrote this <br>Do all of these make up for the one single episode that is distinctly shit?<br><br>The girl isn't even mean about people who don't follow the rules, she just asks them to remember next time and people talk shit behind her back about her wanting them to follow the rules.<br><br>what the hell does a fucking baby know about rules or morality<br>fuck you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up and Praise the Sun already.</br>  <br>What exactly is so great about it?<br><br><br>The only opinions in there are that GoGo! sucks and that Smile! is good. Which, ya know, are obviously opinions. Not to mention that wasn't a run-on sentence. That was two separate sentences with one of them being longer than the other.<br><br><br>Most of that isn't plot though? The plot is about them finding the rulers and then getting to the Cure Rose Garden and finding the rulers didn't happen often because there were only four of them and so there was a lot of padding.<br><br><br>This is true but I don't know what it has to do with my post.<br><br><br>Haruka. I want to be held by Minami.<br><br><br>Honestly I gave up on expecting plot after the disaster that was Dokidoki! Precure. What I do expect though is for the episodes that don't relate to the plot to be halfway entertaining which most of GoGo! wasn't for me. I thought the plot episodes were really good but a lot of the time I was bored by everything else and had to force myself to keep going with GoGo! which is weird because I've never had to do that with anything else.

If anything, I'd say Splash Star was inherently awful for a multitude of reasons but I think to get the entire Precure experience you need to watch them all at some point or another. When I decided to start Precure I chose to work my way through airing order even though I knew I wouldn't like the first three seasons very much simply because they weren't the bright, FUN magical girl shows I'm used to watching. And yeah, there were a ton of times where I just wanted the shit to end but they all had good points (some more than others) and now that I'm to the more FUN seasons, I think I appreciate them more than if I'd just skipped right to them. <br><br> Almost done with GoGo. ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  free software <br>Are you so poor?</br></br>  <br>those last 18 episodes tho</br>  <br>I don't pay other people to flip switches in my house for me. Why would I pay them to do so a bit faster in my computer?</br>  <br>Splash Star was the last one I watched and I thought it was ballin as hell.</br>  <br><br>I wont deny that it picked up towards the end but (imo) Saki and Mai were the most boring protagonists I've ever laid eyes on and the entire thing with Kaoru and Michiru was so shoehorned in that I just couldn't help but roll my eyes. The one thing I truly enjoyed about SS was the DBZ like finale. It was pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>See I heard Splash Star was better than both Futari Wa seasons both here and on Tumblr so I decided to watch that instead. What exactly makes you say it's awful?</br>  <br><br>Obviously theres a huge difference in taste here but if you liked Splash Star that much then honestly you might enjoy the first two seasons as well.</br></br>  <br>Seen them all. <br><br><br>Agreed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree that Mai was nothing special, but Saki just seemed like a better Nagisa to me.</br>    <br><br>My biggest complaint was that Saki and Mai were pretty much carbon copies of Nagisa and Honoka and as such, the season followed a very predictable formula. Thats not to say that Precure as a whole isn't predictable, because it is, but its extra noticeable going from Futari wa's two seasons straight to SS that its almost the same story but with slightly different characters. Plus, Saki and Mai were pretty boring in and of themselves. But I'm the type of person who loves huge casts, the more characters there are the more fun I'm likely to have so only having two or three girls interacting for 50+ episodes gets boring really fast for me. All I know is that when I finally got to Yes! I was so relieved to not only have five main characters but also girls who could transform by themselves, because that also got kind of old.</br></br>  <br>Nagisa=Hibiki&gt;Saki<br>mind you i'm still very fond of saki<br><br><br>Not him but Splash Star starts out as a watered down version of the original, which compounds which such wonderfully entertaining episodes as 'oh shit i spilled stuff on your book'. but it gets much better after a while.<br> tumblr </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily Minamin!!  <br>Ah. Obviously I haven't seen the first two seasons but I thought Saki and Mai were pretty good on their own. What exactly makes them boring for you outside of their statuses as 'carbon copies of Nagisa and Honoka?'<br><br><br>When would you say it got better? It was the first one I watched after I finished Suite and Heartcatch (which were my first two seasons that I watched after I got into the franchise during Smile!) but I thought it was pretty good starting with episode 8 or so.<br><br>Also Tumblr is still better than the livejournal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never seen anyone justify the "carbon copy" argument, and it's just not true in Saki's case. The personalities are completely opposite. The archetypes are similar. That's about the end of it.</br>  <br>For me, when Dorodoron shows up. Absolutely adore him, did not expect he would have that voice when i watched the 2nd ED before I started the show. the Ms. Shitatare arc is a bit of a dip for me, although I do like a lot of her monsters, especially the summer festival water balloon one. Then Kintolesky shows up and it's smooth sailing.<br><br>people use livejournal?</br></br></br>  <br>Dorodoron shows up pretty late (more than 1/4h of a way through the show) though. Why would you say it doesn't pick up until then/what kept you watching up until that point?</br>  <br><br>Well, the thing I liked about Nagisa was that she was what I'd call realistically genki. Her general mood was upbeat but there were times where she'd be pissy or sad which was a good balance for Honoka's constant state of pleasantness. Saki didn't really have an off switch and Mai was the same constant state of pleasantness as Honoka so for me it was just TOO MUCH positive energy between only two girls for 48 episodes. Like, its the same scenario episode after episode, a little argument or clash in personalities would have been refreshing but even when Saki ruined Mai's sketchbook there were no noteworthy reactions from either of them. I dunno', maybe if I'd watched something between Max Heart and SS I'd feel differently but as it is, I'd definitely say its my least favorite season by a long shot.</br></br>  <br><br>Funnily enough, for me it was Shitatare's appearance that marked the somewhat enjoyable portion of SS for me. She was fun and it seemed like the story/animation got a little bit more kooky at that point.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't call it that late, considering he shows up in ep 14 in a 49 ep show.<br>Despite my statement of SS being a watered down version of the original, in many ways it felt like a step up from season 2, which is loaded with QUALITY. Also I'm a bit of a completionist.<br><br>To each their own I suppose, her arc isn't a DRASTIC decrease in enjoyment for me.<br><br>I have a depressing lack of Dorodoron in my folder.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To me, SS was a bit too predictable (exactly 7 episodes per general) in structure, and from what I heard here I was expecting a lot more from a certain two characters than what was actually delivered. Most of the action felt really floaty, even though I loved the idea of using spirit power to fly and make shields and other cool stuff. I disagree about Saki and Mai though, they become their own unique characters within the first 10 episodes.</br>  <br>? But most series have a lot of positive energy from all the girls. What makes the Splash Star group so different?<br><br><br>Is Max Heart really that bad? I hear it's even more of the Nagisa show than Futari Wa was and I'm not too big on Nagisa.<br><br><br>Yeah Splash Star is pretty predictable but so are a lot of the other seasons. I can see why you'd be disappointed in the twins though if they aren't the kind of characters you find appealing. I suffered the same disappointment in regards to Setsuna.<br><br>Speaking of which I still need to finish Fresh since I stopped after Northa's debut episode. Does CureCom have any batches for the later episodes yet?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Max Heart really that bad? I hear it's even more of the Nagisa show than Futari Wa was and I'm not too big on Nagisa. <br>It's basically the first season but with a third girl but still the same ratio of Nagisa to Honoka as before.</br></br>  <br> It's basically the first season but with a third girl but still the same ratio of Nagisa to Honoka as before. <br>I'm watching Max Heart right now and Honoka's role is reduced a lot.<br>I still haven't seen any Honoka centric episode, but I can't even count the episodes focused on Nagisa.<br>Even Hikari feels a secondary character compared with Nagisa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to badmouth MH too much, because it certainly has it's moments, but fuck it:<br>the fights were less fun, often drawn poorly in comparison<br>Shiny Luminous feels like an excuse to add more stock footage<br>repeat episodes from last season<br>nagisa forgets shit she learned last season<br>plots of epsiodes staggeringly more boring than last season<br>Less super-heroics, due to everyone being put to sleep/heroines are warped to different dimension during fights (a malady that plagues SS, Y5, and other later seasons)<br>A significant amount of time pretending to focus on a plot that doesn't go anywhere until the last 5 episodes.<br><br>Nagisa taking up too much time doesn't even remotely bother me. I have watched far too much Dragonball to be bothered by that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Max Heart really that bad? <br>No. I liked it better than FW. Hikari added something to the group dynamic that I didn't realize was missing before, but was very obvious when going back to FW.</br></br>    <br>One part I found funny but also thoughtful was that there was one fight in particular where Hikari is running around in a forest while Black and White are fighting, and then they defeat the enemy on their own without her help at all. She realizes that she's actually not that needed to fight, and thought I don't remember what came of it, that there was attention drawn to the fact was nice.</br>  <br>i don't remember that at all, I would really like to see that one again if it exists</br>  <br>I'm not sure if that's good or bad but the way people talk makes it sound bad.<br><br><br>That makes me want to watch the first two seasons even less. And since those are the only ones I haven't finished other than Fresh that's not exactly a good thing.<br><br><br>What exactly did she add to the dynamic?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'll now proceed to pleasure myself with this racket. </br>  <br>i really like the first season, and at least don't regret watching the second, it is not without merit. I didn't intend to push you off of it.<br><br>nigga she gettin high</br></br></br>  <br>The first season is good, a bit outdated, but that's all.<br>It has a lot of nice details, White and Black are the most badass cures when it came to fighting and has one of the more believable friendship of all Precure.<br>I wouldn't recommend Max Heart to anyone though.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't find it, but it definitely happened. In rewatching some episodes though, I remembered just how awesome FW and MH were. The transformations and attacks felt so powerful and real, especially Yukana's amazing performance as Honoka.</br>  I am gundam  <br>I want to molest this Hibiki.</br>  Oh this poor lovely cat.

God I swear /a/nons are the worst trolls on the planet</br>  <br><br> It's amazing and better than the average mangaka's crap. <br>This looks worse than a weekly mangaka art. D.Grayman's art was so much better in Jump than when she moved to SQ everyone suddenly had a potato head and flat faces and you couldn't tell anyone apart anymore.</br></br></br>  Drawfag here<br><br>Hoshino's drawing skill is really good. But she is really indecisive to the point she puts details to everywhere, including where shouldn't</br></br>  <br> Drawfag here <br> Hoshino's drawing skill is really good. <br>You must be a shitty artist</br></br></br>  <br>Keep trying</br>  I thought there was some contract deal that was fucking the artist over, and that was why the D was in manga limbo.<br><br>Was that not the case, or am I just Pooh brain?<br><br>Fucking happy as all hell to see it coming back though. One of the first manga I ever read.<br><br><br><br>Fuck yes best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Chapter ends with Allen and Earl hugging <br>Whaat?!\<br><br>Can't wait for the translation to see what the heck is going on.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought there was some contract deal that was fucking the artist over, and that was why the D was in manga limbo. <br><br>It was a false rumour<br><br><br>It's just part 1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just part 1 <br>I see makes sense.</br></br>  <br>wheres part 2?</br>  <br>Not yet scanned?</br>  <br>Gotta love the transition<br>First volume is still the best cover</br></br>  <br>this cover and volume 19 is my favorites but that one is definitely 3rd.</br>  <br>Second part when?<br><br><br>I felt bad for Mana being there all broken.<br>Now the Earl knows how Mana felt in the past because he broke as well.<br><br>Also a friend pointed to me that yhe one who Mana&amp;Nea's mom was the Earl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also a friend pointed to me that yhe one who Mana&amp;Nea's mom was the Earl. <br>What? That the Earl "killed" Mana &amp; Nea's mom or that he  fucked  her? Because you're missing a crucial verb there.</br></br>  <br>The resonating reaction with Apocryphos has calmed down...<br>/<br>Now then, A date with the Noahs?<br>Well Whatever<br>/<br>... After all, This is the first date in 35 year's.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> puts details to everywhere, including where shouldn't <br><br>really? example?</br></br></br>  <br>Like every page</br>  <br> when <br>implying this werent made with fujos in mind</br></br>  <br>He married their mom when they were kids.<br>She died when Nea became the 14th, isn't clear if the one who killed her was the Earl or Nea himself.</br></br>  <br> Fujos <br>so whats the chances of Kanda's waifu boyfriend alma coming back? Kanda is a general now so he needs a side kick.</br></br>  Why is Allen hugging the Earl? I haven't read this shit in ages.  <br>Yuu is just a normal beautiful person now right? And his Innocence seems to be fucking with him. He can't do that deep/self heal anymore.<br><br> tf your waifu gets a penis </br></br></br>  <br>Alma won't return. He is even deader than Timcanpy</br>  <br> He can't do that deep/self heal anymore. <br>I thought he exhausted all his extra lives?</br></br>  <br> characters staying dead <br>Just look at Tyki Mikk, he should have died 5 times over by now.</br></br>  <br> 65 pages. <br>I pity you, d-gayfags</br></br>  <br> Road: Hey, Listen </br>  <br>How, he is one of the most OP in DGM</br>  <br>Hey I was expecting 30, this is already more than twice of that. it's not that bad</br>  <br>Allen chopped him to pieces a couple of times. Tyki's plot armor is pretty thick.</br>  <br>this. No clue what happened last time, the last 10 or so chapters were a mess to begin with</br>  I fucking hope Neah just totally takes over at some point and wrecks shit. I like Allen and all, but the few times the guy has come to the surface he's been really cool.  Nea is really cute when he is not trying to kill anyone.  <br>He can still regen a little it seem.<br><br>He got memory wipe recently in the story and his ability just get them back right after</br></br></br>  Kanda can still heal himself, it's just his ability isn't as strong as before  <br>I don't understand that though, these last several chapters Hoshino has confused me, and it also seems like he brought Johnny back after Allen/Nea/whoever the fuck he is right now slammed his head.</br>  <br>Kanda's blood has healing power, already shown in Alma arc</br>   my heart <br><br>That was a good chapter, Road was adorable. Glad it's back, though now we have to wait 3 months.</br></br>  <br>That's not the last page. It's not over that easily</br>  I wonder how much she's drawn ahead, I saved this from her Instagram back in November.  <br>Holy shit, its back. How long until translations go up?</br>  I honeslty can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading D gay man. How did the plot get so fucking terrible?  <br>The translation of the first 32 pages are finished</br>  <br>Which group do you work for</br>  <br>3 months is better than togashi infinite hiatus. Ill take it as long as we keep getting this sort of art quality.</br>  <br>None. There are a bunch of translators and editors working together under no group</br>  <br>Since we're all waiting for the manga translation to come out. I got a question. How come the official figure looks like shit for a fairly popular series such as this, and it's not even cheap to boot.</br>  Page 1~32 Translation:<br> https://mangahelpers.com/forum/sho<wbr>wthread.php/80787-DGM-Chapter-219-S<wbr>poiler-Thread?p=4056600&amp;viewfull=1#<wbr>post4056600</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Didn't it come out in the early days of the manga?</br>  <br>Thanks a lot. This series is my childhood and I'm totally looking forward to it. <br><br>Going to be enjoying every bit of it tomorrow when I wake up.</br></br></br>  <br>this is out like 10 years ago.</br>  80 posts already and that pastAllen pasta anon still hasn't showed up?  <br>is that neah or what he looked like before the white hair thing?<br><br> 65 pages <br>are we always gonna get about this amount of pages everytime? I hate for this to be a one time thing and next month they give like 20-21 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br> red arm <br>I thought the arm turned to black or was that an anime-only thing?<br>and gotdammit get some nailclippers, holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>that arm stops an axe. How can nail clippers do something</br>  <br> that arm stops an axe <br>I really need to reread this series.</br></br>  <br>Huh? Nea was the Noah of Destruction? Even if it's been so long since the last chapter, I totally don't remember ever having read this before. Must have glossed over it.</br>  <br> next month <br>About that.</br></br>  <br>I meant the next month we get a chapter.</br>  <br>Chapter 198<br><br><br>Krory arc, where Allen regained his left eye</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was struggling cleaning the raw. Here you are<br><br>DGM threadly reminder that Past!Allen is responsible for:<br><br>[x]Musician code along with the song<br>[x]Almost destroying Noah Clan via using 14th<br>[x]Turning Cross's life into shit<br>[x]Turning Allen's life into extreme deep shit<br>[x]Cross's death<br>[x]Lavi turns into wormslut<br>[x]Road made a contract with QB and become magical girl, only for getting Madoka's bless and gone for good<br>[x]Timcanpy's death<br>[x]Not!Shou Tucker raping everyone<br>[x]Turning everyone into gay<br>[x]Link's unrequited gay love <br>[x]Turning Kanda and Alma from straight to gay<br>[x]The manga switches to quarterly<br><br>[for later update]<br><br><br>As we have new chapter, please feel free to add more.

Or is that Kaneycky guy?  <br>Probably not the most, but more complex than Kaneki. <br><br>He manages to be insane without none of the reader notice until the truth got revealed</br></br></br>  <br> mfw when fatfags says shirou is complex <br>im not talking about you im talking about what makes a compelx character<br><br>but I would say for me its allen, kaneki only has to worry about two sides(humans and ghouls)<br><br>allen has to worry about like 4 sides<br> human <br> noah <br> akuma <br> innocence </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you forgot<br> past!Allen </br></br></br>  <br><br>So what is the most complex manga/anime/LN protagonist?<br> inb4 classic lit </br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking currently happening events.</br>  <br>As how Apocryphos said, past!Allen is like he can rises any moment along with Nea</br>  <br> So what is the most complex manga/anime/LN protagonist? <br> manga/anime/LN <br>woah buddy, thats a long list to go through, and I dont even read LNs.<br>\<br> past!Allen is like he can rises any moment along with Nea <br>what? so he has two people inside him now, fuck I need the vol. t hurry up and be delivered to my library.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And he has Mana's personality in him too</br>  <br>I feel like that's something he adopted. but Im getting a feeling like hes gonna try to save the noahs too.</br>  <br>Well of course, he has to save best girl after all</br>  This is too sad  <br><br>Aw hell, is this confirmed? I thought it was a wrist injury. Arthritis is about the worst thing that can happen to an artist</br></br>  <br>We never know what exactly it was, but she says it's chronic and there were times she felt it was painful just only lying down</br>  <br>Best girl doesn't need save</br>  can't wait to see the next part of the chapter. We only have half of it.  Man I need to reread this shit. I can't remember what happened last time.  Luberier did nothing wrong.  <br>But he actually did NOTHING wrong</br>  Due to Hoshino's recent instagram status, the raw provider probably will postpone uploading the rest  <br>Well shit, what status?</br>  <br>I assume you're talking about the part where Noahs have no dick.</br>  <br>That's just how they roll</br>  <br> どういうルートなのか分からないですが、発売日前の漫画を投稿しないで欲<wbr>しいです…。インスタは画像が主体の場なので、余計に…マナーがあると信じ<wbr>たいです。</wbr></wbr> <br> Although I do not know how, I wish my manga wouldn't be posted before its release date....Because the images are a big subject on instagram.... I want to believe there are still manners. </br></br>  <br>B-but they're supposed to breed human</br>  <br>Ok that's kind of sad now</br>  <br>Ah, I agree with her then. If its a sketch or in progress panels just showing her work I guess she wont mind.</br>  <br>That make sense, it's her long await revival after all.</br>  <br>Ah, instagram, the haven of art theft.</br>  <br>She actually minds after she learns that posting them gives editorial department troubles. She did that because she didn't know.<br><br>Is it just me or it's even sadder that she just doesn't want her works to be leaked before the release day</br></br></br>  HOLY FUCKING HYPE SHILLS  <br>Okay so, what the actual fuck is going on? I remember it starting off pretty neat, and then when they picked up the vampire dude things went south of fucking bananas in terms of story. I don't remember anything that happened past that part because it's all such a jumbled mess.</br>  <br>What in the fuck am I reading?</br>  <br>Welp, I guess we wont be seeing her work on current chapter from now on, its also a spoiler to the readers too. Pretty sad since I really like to see anons posting this <br>kind of work in progress pics.<br><br>Most raws are usually from the release day or after a day or two right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>DGM raws/spoiler are usually out before the official release 3-4 days.</br>  <br>I'm crying ;_;</br>  <br>Pathetic</br>  The chapter is pretty much easier to understand than Alma arc to me. Why so much "what the fuck is going on?"  <br>because no one remembers shit<br> <br>no one is complaining about the art, she is a high skilled artist</br></br></br>  <br> the rest <br>So the OP scans aren't complete yet?</br></br>  <br>They also try to read a raw chapter without understanding moonrunes.</br>  <br>33/65 pages</br>  The rest seems to be up  HOLY SHIT THIS IS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL  MANA IS THE EARL CONFIRMED <br>A<br>N<br>A<br><br>I<br>S<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>E<br>A<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh, digital colouring still can't beat the real thing.<br>She sure is great at it though, I'd need a decade to get around her level.</br></br>  <br>Most be tough being blind</br>  <br>Her carpal tunnel better not return.</br>  <br>its chronic I think.<br><br><br><br>sweet, now time to make a d-gray man folder and go look for some d-gray man reaction image.</br></br></br></br></br>  Just read the whole chapter.<br>It's all orge now.<br><br>Allen, you have been living great. It's better for you just to drop dead right there and now before learning the very truth</br></br></br>  <br>She is like a female Miura</br>   &gt;In these 7000 years, only once did the Millennium Earl disappear from this Earth.<br> Suddenly, on the ground, there remained only the wind... as well as... <br> Do you understand? <br> That was the two of us, Mana and Neah. <br><br> The two of us were originally one person: THE EARL OF MILLENIUM <br/></br></br></br></br></br>   <br>Hahaha this motherfucking twist.</br>  <br>   &gt;The two of us were originally one person: THE EARL OF MILLENIUM<br>  </br> <br><br>JESUS<br>FUCKING<br>CHRIST</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>What the fuck?</br>  where's the second part of the scans then? PLEASE! <br><br>can anyone confirm that spoiler?</br></br>    <br>The second part got deleted due to this <br>And yes, it's true</br></br>  <br>What a tweest.</br>  <br>On the scale from 1 to infinity plus, how broken will Allen be</br>  <br><br>She just wants it to end as soon as possible, doesn't it</br></br>  <br>It's true anon.<br><br>Holy fucking shit, despair incoming.</br></br></br>  <br>i think this has been planned since the beginning</br>  <br>It's more like she has been waiting to drop this bomb since the 1st chapter 11 years ago</br>  <br>He is already broken. I swear the amount of pain DGM characters go through is enough to make them kill themselves.</br>    I wanna fuck Kanda  <br>I love it they go through so much pain and still aren't edgy.</br>   I have decided the Earl's human form since the series's begining. <br><br>We have been warned ALL THE TIME</br></br>  <br>Oh god. I for one am going to enjoy Allen in the Earl's side for a while.</br>  <br>I always wanted to Allen to join the Noahs too, they just seem so fun, and then there's the AllenXRoad ship</br>  <br>b-but this guy said </br>  <br> the Earl's human <br>Wait what? That's the Earl on the far right and in the OP? I need to reread this series since it's come back, I literally don't remember a fucking thing that happened near the end</br></br>  <br>You quoted posts from the same person, which is me<br><br>It just got deleted</br></br></br>  <br> which is me <br><br>Hi you.</br></br></br>  I'm so confused, I haven't been able to follow what is going on since way back when they did Kanda's flashback    <br>Wait is it legit over now? The entire series?</br>  <br> Wait is it legit over now? <br>are you retarded?</br></br>  <br> I'm so confused <br><br>we too anon, hagu</br></br></br>  <br>It's just the begining OF TRUE SUFFERING</br>  <br>What? I haven't read this manga since the last chapter before the mangaka became sick and I haven't been following it at all</br>  <br>yes it over, it ended on ch 219</br>  <br> What? I haven't read this manga since the last chapter before the mangaka became sick <br>yeah and this is obviously the first chapter after that. From the chapter you read, do you really think, that from there it would finish in one chapter?</br></br>  <br>honestly? yes</br>  <br> this is obviously the first chapter after that <br> From the chapter you read <br>Literally what? I don't fucking remember whats even going on with this series since I forgot about it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Chapter 220 announced to be in October</br></br>  <br><br>get out</br></br>  <br>It is the "real thing", only digital. Exactly the same fundamentals apply.</br>  I'm gonna marry Lenalee!  <br>That's gay</br>  Would you fuck a grey man?  <br>They are twins.</br>  <br> They are the same person </br>  <br> You haven't read the series since it came out? <br> lol faggot get out fuck you can't enjoy this series </br></br>  <br>The noah.</br>  oh cool an update, just to shatter our hopes and dreams by leaving just hanging for couple another years again.  <br>I put the D in the title.</br>  <br>Lenalee a shit</br>  <br> Series comes back <br> lel is it really over? <br>Are you a legit reallife autist?</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is that it has comeback, I don't know how many chapters been released, I don't know what the mangaka is doing. For all I know she ended it in one chapter or some shit and  was the last page. I don't fucking remember, I already stated I haven't been following the series at all.</br>  <br><br>Please just stop</br></br>  <br>then google it or read the thread before posting retarded shit you subhuman.</br>  <br>They're literally the same person. It's like talking to that angry little voice in your head. <br><br>Honestly don't know how this manga got swarmed by fujos. It looked like a typical shonen when I first read it. It just has a lot of male characters, but the homo hints are way way low.</br></br></br>  <br> You're subhuman for asking a simple question <br>Go back to /v/</br></br>  <br>No you're a subhuman for being to ignorant to at least inform yourself before being a retard.

Have you seen her draw something other than Dgm? Because she is skilled as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How come he used the word subhuman without knowing /pol/ ?<br>Sounds fishy to me.</br></br></br>  <br>You better delete your post to save your face</br>  <br>They are just some autists tryhards, don't pay attention. Her skills are amazing</br>  <br> Any real artist or scholar <br>Which isn't your case, autist wannabe</br></br>  <br>The creator of Berserk? Nah, he takes his time and all, and he's a lazyfuck, but he does excellent drawings, sadly, D.Gray-Man hasn't gotten any better in years.</br>  <br>You're spending your time making up bait to "troll" people on the internet</br>  <br><br>What face ?<br>My anonymous one ?</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you're provoking for a reason.</br>  holy shit will Berserk next chapter be this impacting regarding the series too?  I don't even remember what was going on in this manga anymore.  <br>We're all confused anon. Just do some re-reading and it'll (probably) make sense.</br>  <br><br>Anon i advice you to take things less seriously in here.<br>we probably agreed on many subjects in other threads or maybe even here, since i samefagged.</br></br></br>  <br>just remove yourself from here</br>  To the guy who read all the chapter already: does Lavi appears? Pls respond this is important to me.  <br>Not the one you're requesting, but I saw Lavi in the WIP images on the author's twitter, so he most liekly appears in this or the next few chapters. Th eodd thing is that  he was with the MC. </br>  <br><br>Leave him alone he's probably a newfag.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>thank you so much  ;_; <br>I'm really hoping for at least a fucking panel with Levi</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is the context behind this</br>  <br> Fiddler (The Noah with eyeballs tounge) is drawing fan art of Lavi and his worms  </br>  <br> Levi </br>  <br> I want Lavi to be raped with worms </br>  <br> autism </br>  Lavi pretty much had mind break by now  Come on where's the translatorfags with the summary  <br>The whole chapter can be summed up in one sentence  Mana is the Earl </br>    So why the fuck does Tykki look like Neah? <br><br>  in before "muh sameface"  <br><br>Its intentional because Wisely mentions it when he wakes up only for Road to stop him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cloning, past!Allening</br>  <br>My dick is so confused</br>  <br>we know this already, that's not what I asked and this isn't a summary eat a dick</br>  <br> Its intentional <br>These DGMfags sure are delusional</br></br>  <br>Why bait?</br>  <br>And Allen called Nea "Tyki" in chapter 198 too</br>  <br>Pic related.</br>  <br>And another one.</br>  <br><br> replying to bait </br></br>  <br>There are a lot of shitposters on DGM threads and I actually want to discuss this without some others copying the guy/samefagging. Easier to just post the proof.</br>  <br>Poor Wisely is going to have a major migraine when he learns the truth.</br>  <br> don't know how this manga got swarmed by fujos <br>Well the author is a fujo</br></br>  lavi  <br> All this suffering <br> The implications <br> It is only the first chapter <br>I want to get off of Ms.Hoshino Wild Ride.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the only one.<br>Do you wish for more?</br></br>  <br> fujos <br><br><br> fujo </br></br></br></br>  <br>Has Nea seen Tyki in person yet? I wonder what his reaction will be.</br>  <br>no, die, degenerate</br>  Is mangastream still translating this?  Post Allen's reaction face when he learns about this   <br>I'm sure it'll fade by the time the next chapter comes out, surprised anyone's bothering.</br>  <br>You have 3 months to try and get off before the next swerve comes</br>  <br>They said they would consider if the manga really returned</br>  Time tor read this shit all over again<br> best girl of all best returns, what could possibly be better? </br>  <br>He went through Allen's memories so he should have seen him. Plus Tykki was in the area when Neah took over Allen to shit talk the Earl in the Alma-Kanda arc, though he was probably too preoccupied with Earl.</br>  If Allen is really Millennium Earl why the Noah, Demons, Neah, Count himself, the author literally everybody were trying to kill him?  <br>The last few DGm threads only has minimal shitposting. It was only today that we got tons of people trying to convince us we are blind for liking her art.</br>  <br> Honestly don't know how this manga got swarmed by fujos <br>Her style regressed to looking like something you'd find out of a yaoi manga, it doesn't surprise me. I miss her old style, she was one of my favourites.</br></br>  <br>she never went missing anon!</br>  does anyone have that page where allen blushes but the blush is all over the fucking page, I need it for an argument.  <br> tons of people <br>Learn how to count. Tons is not singular word</br></br>  This finally makes sense.  <br>Oh shit.</br>  <br>Road's known the truth for a while now.</br>  <br>  That face when the human you're interested in has the memory of the traitorfag Noah </br>  <br>Omg, thats funny because that's exactly what happened to deadman Wonderland. It ended in one chapter with the worst end of all time. Good thing is I think hoshino actually cares too much about her work to do that.</br>  <br> Omg <br>They are here, among us.<br>Beware the Fujos</br></br></br>  Im still mad lenalee hair got cut short.  <br>Don't think Road cares all that much.</br>  <br> because that's exactly what happened to deadman Wonderland <br>no it's not. DW had no break before the last chapter.</br></br>  <br>wasn't it burnt? she's growing it out.</br>  <br>You are right probably, I forgot most if not all of the "why" in this series.</br>  I want to cum in the Earl's hair  <br>I really do wonder how Tykki fits into all of this, maybe he was supposed to be the 14th natural host or something but the implantation into Allen screwed it up? Random triplet? We know that Allen's age reversed so ages aren't so certain.</br>  <br>They've been here for a while.<br>It's easy to detect their autistic text pattern.</br></br>  <br>they are even talking about the thread on twitter</br>  <br> implying this board wasn't already infested by fujos </br>  <br>I don't mind as long as they don't shitpost like the tumblrfags that they are</br>  <br> liking the bird <br><br>it seems you are autism anon</br></br></br>  <br>Probably the ones that Hoshino found out about the scans from, they don't understand low radar.</br>   So if Mana is the Earl, what was the robot skeleton that Allen killed?   <br>I do care. I don't like the idea to hold a conversation with someone who has a tumblr.</br>  <br>Split soul</br>  <br> ohh he posted a reaction image from an anime he probably likes it what a fag <br>Look I'm posting this guy I probably like Game of Thrones huh?</br></br>  <br>Hoshino saw it on instagram. The best thing we can do is support now is support the publication and not leak the second part.</br>  <br>See? You have autism.</br>  <br>Hoshino said the leaks are mostly in Instagram. I checked, and the majority of posters are Chinese and Korean.</br>  <br>why not?</br>  So now the next big questions is, who has he Heart?  <br>My bet is on Past!Allen</br>  <br>I'm going to go out on a limb and Say no one we know of has it. and I'll go farther and say "the Heart" isn't real</br>  <br>so the millennium earl</br>  <br>I'm thinking Lavi.<br>I like this  idea too. What a twist it would be.</br></br>  Why is Lavi capt again?  <br><br>So her art is just shit?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much</br>  <br>it looks more like scans are shit. the grain .</br>  <br>Someone close to Allen, since Apocryphos see's Allen as a threat</br>  <br> Lenalee </br>  <br> Lanelee <br> important to allen <br>shes friend-zoned so hard she isn't leaving, It'll probably be Johnny.</br></br></br>  <br>Since the original Allen seems to have planned this all out, I'm betting on him having found it a long time ago and hid it. Maybe somewhere on the ark?</br>  <br>Its timcanpy.</br>  <br>Maybe that was suggested when her innocence protected her, but I think it'll be someone less obvious <br><br>nah Johnny doesn't have an innocence</br></br></br>  <br>Apo sees Nea as the threat, not Allen and actually tries to save Allen, in a unique way though.</br>  <br> Friend <br> Not important </br></br>  <br>yeah I know, just a little bit of laziness on my part</br>  <br>Apo comunicates with it, Road fears of it. <br>It does exists</br></br>  <br>Poor guy's going to crack, maybe he'll just start laughing?</br>  <br>Sorry but Lanelee isn't going to be important. shes as important as Krory. <br><br>well the Heart could be a person instead of an innocence</br></br></br>  <br>Cross, since he is alive</br>  <br>is this confirmed? I always thought he was alive but...</br>  I just think Ufotable should make a D Gray Man remake and sell like water.  <br>fucking chinese and korean fujos <br><br>come on no one saved the full chapter?</br></br></br>  <br>Lavi is impossible since he is wormslut now. Apocrypha would be much more panicky if The Heart got kidnapped by Noahs</br>  <br>At this point in time even Kanda is closer.</br>  <br>it comes out officially friday. wait a couple of days.</br>  <br>but Apo either did or tired to kill him, or do you mean the innocence he carried?</br>  <br>Fujos have too much loyalty to each other anon.</br>  Haha wow.  <br>.....what?</br>  <br>Let's be honest, this twist was a long time coming.</br>  <br>The old Earl disappeared and became the two babies.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>At least it was well foreshadowed.</br>  <br>One can dream. It would be amazing.</br>  <br>please post the full thing you cocksucker</br>  <br> Let's be honest, this twist was a long time coming </br>  <br>Please, did you see how badly /a/ shitposted the God Eater threads? And the first episode wasn't even that bad. Things world be 10x worst with Dgrayman ones since it has actual fujobait</br>   Among the grey ashes in the flames shining...First one, then two ... <br><br>HOSHINOOO</br></br>    Your face when your husbando turns into two babies. <br><br>She then goes and adopts them. Katherina best waifu.</br></br>  <br> fujo bait <br>This again. How is Dgm fujo?</br></br>  <br>Holy shit it's like Hoshino's art changes every page.</br>  <br>Apart from the whole Alma arc...I don't know.</br>  <br>I want to give Katherina her own child. <br><br>Shame she dead.</br></br></br>  <br>lots of pretty boys working hard together and getting sweaty with each other</br>    <br>You just described most shounen manga out there.</br>  <br>People trying to force shit on D Gray Man <br><br><br>No anon, God Eater is awful. I never saw /a/ agreeing like that before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because it has lots of pretty boys. In fact by /a/ standards nowadays any show that has a high number of male cast than females is fujobait, doesn't even need for the guys to look good. This place is getting shittier by the day.</br>  <br>Yes, so in the end anything can be taken as "fujo", which is ridiculous. People saying that are pretty much autists or epik trolls thinking they are funny as <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128131220 </br>  <br>As a self proclaim fujo I am appalled as to why they called Kekkai fujobait last season.</br>  <br><br>Tiki may be a "carrier" for Mana as Allen was for Neah.</br></br>  <br> As a grill I am <br>Fucking stop.</br></br>    Thread died when the fujis revealed themselves. They truly are the plague.  <br>DGM has always had fujoshits, where have you been?<br><br><br>Many of them cite the Ark arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We are doomed. Can't we have nice things, anon?</br>  <br>Remember when she was the strongest Exorcist for a minute?</br>  <br> Remember when she was the strongest Exorcist for a minute? <br>nope cause there's master class.</br></br>  <br><br>for the life of me I cant picture girls on /a/, Like I know they're there just can't see it.</br></br>  <br>yes, I love her</br>  <br>You mean the group of 10 or so top level exorcists? IIRC, those guys were a bunch of chumps.</br>  <br> allens master <br> chump <br>nope.</br></br></br>  <br>Leenalee was never the strongest. The generals were always stronger, but they had to be taken out by the Noah themselves. Allen was always stronger as was Cross and Kanda.</br>  <br>Weren´t they trying to destroy humanity through mass murder?<br><br>What was with that!</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember too much from the series, but wasn't she  used goods? Not that I care or anything. </br>  <br>Wasn't Leenalee the first one to super exorcist lvl 3?<br><br><br>No, her brother would have prevented that.</br></br></br></br>  So this chapter had the revelation that Mana is half of the Earl and Nea is the other half. Why did the Earl split into two and who was the Mana thay Allen traveled with? Is it some sort of good/evil thimg and clown!Mana was the good half (albeit insane) or was it Earl!Mana the whole time?  I don't get it.<br>Then, who in the hell Allen called back in akuma skeleton and got his scar?<br>If Mana and Nea is Earl, how Allen called Mana's soul?</br></br>  <br>Also...who's Allen now? Is Allen a person, was he ever a person? <br><br>feels like Pandora hearts with Oz now</br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it was Allen's imagination or something because why would Mana/the Earl scream "you made me into an Akuma!" I doubt that's possible. My biggest question if it did happen is why did the Earl appear to Allen if it was him Allen had lost. I'm thinking the Earl has a clear split personality, too becuase otherwise...<br><br>My feelings exactly (and I love DGM for it)</br></br></br>  <br>You mean a lvl 3 akuma, it wasn't really anything special, just the first time that the group had come across one. Also she nearly died fighting it.</br>  <br>Simple that akuma didn't have Mana's soul.</br>  <br>Then how did it know Allen's name?</br>  <br><br>me, personally I would just chalk it up to being an hallucination.</br></br>  <br>or bother saying "I Love You."</br>  <br>It might have been someone he knew but we know for sure that it wasn't Mana.</br>  <br>It being someone else entirely makes less sense than it being Mana. At least the lines would make sense, then. But I think both theories are invalid.<br>I would say the Mana side of the Earl was using the opportunity to talk to Allen one last time without the Earl side knowing but it's impossible to know, with someone in that head clearly having a few screws loose...</br></br>  <br>Mm. Could be the 'human' side of Mana was speaking? Maybe he just never awoke.</br>  <br>What do you mean?</br>  <br>Like, if Mana hadn't awoken yet and it's why Allen was able to call Mana's soul into the Akuma frame. Then the Noah part of Mana's soul awakened after his death somehow and it's why Tyki looks so much like Mana.</br>  <br>I'm sure it'll be explained eventually. Hell she still needs to explain why Tykki looks like Mana and Nea, when his Noah fully activated his hair grew out long as well like Mana and the previous Earl's too.</br>  <br>That's an interesting theory. Like the soul somehow after the incident manifested in the Tykki memory or something?</br>  <br>The only person that's ever made sense to me is that shithead Timothy. His is the only innocence we've seen that has a human-like body and can talk to the kid AND other people if he just takes over Timothy. Allen's may be sentient as well, but Timothy's is almost like a whole developed person and it's fucking weird. It's almost like a crippled version of Apocrophos.<br><br>Also, it's odd how it synchronized with him from being shoved down his throat prior to it activating. His is almost a hybrid of equipment and parasitic because the innocence was in the jewel his dad made him swallow, but then suddenly became a part of his fucking head like a parasite type and again, I don't think we've seen anything like that from another person.</br></br></br>  Allen I hope he doesn't "die" so far hes had a tough life...  <br>I agree with this. Also the heart is smart. Who would suspect a young boy of having it?</br>  <br>  Everyone hates him and his shitty "filler" arc <br>  Turns out he has The Heart <br><br>HOSHINOOOOO</br></br></br></br>  It's been ages since I read D.Gray-man and I remember the story started to confuse me around the "Mystery of Kanda" arc. Does anyone know of a good summary of the series up to the latest chapter? Thanks.  <br>He'll probably be fine by the end, I'm sure Road will do something. He's stuck dreaming or something right now, right? Maybe she'll visit him she's stuck in her dream right now.</br>  Been rereading on and off all day, I really have to wonder how Link plays into all of this.  <br>yeah that scene was really weird.</br>    <br>so is there more?</br>      <br>Now I wonder which one of them is the craziest.</br>  The theory about Mana looking like the Earl turns out to be truth because Mana IS the Earl.<br><br>Fuck. So when the "Earl" killed Nea it WAS Mana himself killing his own brother which in turn makes sense as to why both the "Earl" and Mana were broken at the same time.<br><br>Oh shit.<br><br>We saw this coming we just needed a way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both probably pretty mad, they each have half a Noah memory. Maybe they'll become one again somehow?</br>  How much BTFO will be Sheryl when Bookman tells him the truth?  <br>Now the question is why Mana wanted to kill his other half? Noah memory awoke and he went nuts?</br>  A DGM thread with 400 posts? Am I dreaming or something?  <br>Mana was crazy because of his problem regarding identity.<br><br>But Nea is thre craziest when because he actually is sane and sound about the whole mess.<br><br>The Earl was traumatized for 35 years after killing Nea, wandering along the world chasing himself, blaming himself for Nea being missing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Poor guy, Wisely will have a migraine as well.</br>  <br>didn't cross say "allen you'll have to kill some one you love when you become a noah" so perhaps its the same for Mana?</br>  <br>Cross means Allen will kill Mana and Mana is someone he loves</br>  <br>Fits in with that sad/happy clown dynamic they have, huh?<br><br>So, about that page with the Earl looking over Mana and a dying Nea; considering the "Earl" seems to be some sort of armor-thing, maybe it represents the 'whole' Earl (like how Jasdero and Devit make up Jasdevi) that Mana and Nea are supposed to be a part of. Since Nea was killed for being a traitor, maybe he refused to assimilate? And as a result, he split into a human body and a Noah body (which was encased within the Earl's cover)?</br></br></br>  Well this explains the other Ark and why the 14th said he's going to be the new Millennium Earl. I wonder if it's a case where there can only be one Earl at a time?  <br>I wonder if that clown cover was wandering around empty all those years while Mana was with Allen? Like remote controlled? Dude was crazy.</br>  <br> And as a result, he split into a human body and a Noah body (which was encased within the Earl's cover)? <br>Had that been the case the Earl wouldn't be looking this old.</br></br>  Wonder how long the series will go on? this seems like this plot twist has been coming for 100s of chapters. Wonder how much farther Hoshino can go with it?  <br>Looked it up on the wiki, Lost Fragment of Snow. The Earl showed up with Akuma in the end while Mana was watching.<br><br>Maybe the Earl just hovered nearby Mana or was conscious of what was going on with him?<br><br><br>Hm? What do you mean?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Maybe Mana found a way to physically separate his Noah and human self? Would explain the Mana who died and was resurrected as an Akuma.  <br>It could have been Nea that Allen resurrected. His soul is probably similar enough to Mana's to be summoned in its place. If it was, then that gives an ok reason for Allen to escape from being eventually taken over completely. Nea's plans were fucked up by having his soul moved around.</br>  <br>If Nea and Mana are the Earl, so there's 2 Earls or both of them make the Earl?</br>  <br>There's still quite bit to cover, there's Cross, the Heart, Tykki's connection to Mana and Nea. What was the deal with the original Allen and why current Allen didn't go by "Allen" or remember Neah. I have to wonder if Allen really is "Allen" at all, maybe "Allen" put the 14th into someone else and he's still in the shadows. Would be funny if the real "Allen" was the Heart.</br>  <br>The original Allen was a dog, apparently. Mana just called our Allen, "Allen" since he was becoming senile.</br>  <br>You said that Mana's split in 2 when Mana killed Nea, but I say isn't possible because had that been the case Mana wouldn't have aged.<br><br>Now I wonder how much Cross new about this when he warned the small Allen in the circus to not get close to Mana.</br></br></br>  <br>He means Past!Allen</br>  <br> The original Allen was a dog <br>IT IS AQUALION ALL OVER AGAIN</br></br>  So are "Mana" and the "Earl" separate? Maybe it's like the difference between the brother and the Noah memories, except the Earl has a physical form?  Someone please explain to me what happened last. And not even last, but like, the event that occurred before mc went baddy mcbadbad.<br><br>I remember that everyone was getting rekt by some virus or something. Like, people were getting infected and there was litterally no hope. Then when everyone in the organization gets infected, the next chapter everyone is fine. I never did understand what happened. Did the author play it off as a dream or what? I remember thinking it was stupid af cuz everyone shouldve been ded</br></br>  <br>Well, maybe not having accepted his Noah self and having an improper awakening meant he didn't stop aging like Road? Not until his "death", anyway.</br>  <br> original Allen was a dog <br><br>That never stops being horribly sad and slightly hilarious to me. Mana is/was batshit insane to confuse poor Red with his goddamn dog to the point of renaming him after it when it died.</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck are you babbling about?</br>  <br>what? you mean the Level 4 fight at the end of the anime? cause there is quite a bit more after that in the manga.</br>  <br><br>I think the last arc he read was the joke arc where there was some pseudo-zombie virus going around in Exorcist HQ.</br></br>  <br>The Allen I'm talking about is the guy that gave himself to Neah. That our Allen didn't go by that name or remember Neah at all is strange, especially his deaging. Original Allen did something fishy, Cross figured it out before he was shot.</br>  <br>Zombie arc</br>  <br>Science team fixed it</br>  <br>Is this Nea talking to himself?<br><br>Alright, I get what you're talking about now.</br></br></br>  <br>I personally can't wait to see past!Allen with his long luscious red locks!</br>  <br>That's the thing, I thought everyone had gotten infected. Did I miss the explanation as to how they managed it?</br>  <br>Yes, he's talking to himself after he saw Tim's memories.</br>  <br>That guy is probably still running around, I doubt Allen is him. He's probably our true villain.</br>  So who Road is in love with?<br><br>Allen? Neah?<br><br>I'm confused.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ anon, that was like 4-5 arcs ago. You're talking about the Komurin D virus that Komui cooked up and turned everyone into vampire zombie things. The science division dug out a counter medicine and turned everyone back to normal.</br>  <br>Wait did he de-age and then age all over again? Dammit Hoshino am I going to have to read this over for a third time?</br>  <br>I thought that third panel from the left was 35 year old past!Allen. From the tone it looks like he and clown!allen share the same hair color and we know that Allen was de-aged to why couldn't have been him? Although I like ypur idea too.</br>  What the fuck is this Past!Allen. Is this a fan theory or have I missed something?  <br>It's pretty fucking obvious Neah is comparing the long haired guy to young Allen as he's talking about the guy aging in reverse. There's almost no chance of that NOT being Past!Allen.</br>  Red IS PastAllen.<br><br>He deaged and erased his own memories so that put Nea's in disorder "why he didn't age?".<br><br>pastAllen is a key character now because those memories should somewhere else.<br><br>Something tells me that Road loved that pastAllen which is might the reason why the "Earl" sealed her memories.<br><br>And that very person is back after those years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because of what Cross said and Neah's comments, I'm leaning toward Allen not being "Allen" at all. Also, where'd the innocence come from and where'd his original arm go?</br>  <br>Allen was older (like 20s?) then he deaged and then is aging up again. Prob due to the apocryphos?? and noah genes</br>  <br>Zombie arc? It was a joke, comic relief. Bak fixed everything.</br>  <br>Could the innocence have deaged him and wiped his memories? You'd think it would target the Noah as well.</br>  <br>That or maybe he's referring to the fact that the current Allen is still younger than the Allen whom Nea knew way back when.<br><br>Maybe our "Allen" is a clone/homunculus based on an "original" Allen? I mean, if Cross can manipulate the dead, maybe they've got this kind of traditional sorcery/alchemy in the story as well. The magic system within D.Gray-Man has never really been that well-defined, has it?</br></br></br>  <br>I was not about to find a good copy of this shitty arc</br>  <br>That is the mistake anon he met "Allen" yet the person involved didn't know, so Cross was clueless until after all this year the truth spit on his face.</br>  Funny how I came from hating Road to liking her over these years.  <br>Basically, Neah wakes up and gets control of Allen's body. He says "he's not immortal" and not aging since the last time they saw each other. He goes onto to comment that he's actually getting younger. He also flat out asks Timcampy why Allen forgot about him. In the same chapter there's a memory of Neah's in which the guy he thinks back on as he's remembering Allen's apparently older self (this is as he's commenting on the age regression) straight up offers himself as a host to "preserve his memory, for decades if necessary".<br><br>My wording is from the official translation but see  for basically the same thing. It's pretty obvious that as far as Neah is remembering, the person he remembers as Allen is deaging, and had previously offered to house the 14th's memory.</br></br></br>   when berserk returns it will get a sticky <br> DGM doesn't <br>Why</br></br>  <br>Current Allen seems to be aging at a normal rate, if he deaged to a baby then it couldn't have happened right after Neah died but sometime later. It will be interesting to find out what happened.</br>  <br>Bak created a vaccine and saved everyone</br>  <br>DGM isn't that popular and wouldn't create a slew of threads all over the board. Be thankful, it makes for less shitposting trolls in the end.</br>  <br> sex hair </br>  <br>Well she did go from not to HOT so that probably really helps</br>  <br>The "mistake" was Cross never asked himself "why" Red didn't call himself "Allen"</br>  <br>I didn't care about her design but her personality how she warmed to Allen despite being enemies is what got me.<br><br>In the other hand Lenalle had Allen on her side for a good time yet wasn't able to lend him a hand when it came to it.</br></br></br>  <br>But here's another question, how did Mana/Earl know about Allen in the first place? If you're going to give your memories to someone you shouldn't let your nemesis know about your backup plan.</br>  <br>I really hope we'll eventually see her true form and not the loli!Road she projects. Even if it's just for a single chapter or something. I've been curious to what she really looks like ever since she said that's not her real form.</br>  <br>If they're two halves of the same person, maybe he just instinctively knew who he was? Unless you mean knowing who Allen was based upon just seeing him, in which case perhaps Past Allen had come into contact with Mana/Earl back then and they just recognized it being a younger version somehow.</br>  I have a feeling that pastAllen hid the Heart in a place where True Road's body is hiding.<br><br>She is the Road to the Heart.</br></br>    <br>During G thief arc, Nea sent a "good morning" message to the Earl, making the Earl learn about Allen being the host</br>  <br>Road's real form is similar to what her dream form looks. She cannot go too far from her real form</br>  <br>Maybe she was Katherina?</br>  <br>I've thought this for a while now, I would not be surprised she was.</br>  <br>Katherina is dead</br>  <br>I was just curious as to how he even knows the name Allen. Yes, it's a common name but to name a dog that and then coincidentally name the kid the right name. I mean we know his name is Allen because that's what Nea called him and I don't think Nea'd call him the wrong name, in respect for his host, even when he was alone.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was literally crippled for a long time in the story, wasn't she?</br>  Rereading the third excorsist arc. The fourteenth and the earl call each other "Brother" several times.  <br>Hence "was", Road froze her age and is only one that wasn't reborn after 35 years. Just and random thought.<br><br>Thinking about it, when Mana was stuck in bed was probably when his Noah was awakening.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but all Noah's do that. We didn't think too much of it.</br>  <br>Past!Allen sent him a message like "14th's host is called "Allen" " or some short</br>  <br>Why would Allen or Nea endanger themselves even more?</br>  <br>Yeah, her innocence went crazy after that fight with the level 3. Her legs were fucked up during the entire Ark arc and for most of the Invasion of the Order arc until she begged the innocence to synchronize when that level 4 showed up. IIRC, she couldn't even walk too well when they first got into the ark, I remember her stumbling and falling a few times and I think Lavi had to carry her when they got off the boat to Japan.</br>  <br>In what aspect that could endanger them. Cross is their "comrade"</br>  Where is the gay porn?  <br>It's what heroes do.</br>  <br>Not here. Go somewhere else to find it.</br>  Should we have new thread?  <br>nope</br>  <br>I thought we were talking about Mana here</br>  <br>We weren't?</br>  <br>Is the manga better than the anime? because I dropped the anime after like 3 episodes because of all the tired old shitty tropes and shitty character designs.</br>  <br>What manga isn't?</br>  <br>Manga is better, but Hoshino is no good in drawing action scenes, which need the anime to clarify</br>  <br>KareKano</br>  <br>good point</br>  I don't get it.  <br>and you never will</br>  My work here is done.  <br>But you haven't done anything</br>  Is this Wasted Potential: The Show?  blue eye shadow is god tier<br>prove me wrong</br>  <br> yfw no one will ever love your shitty show the way you do. </br>  It's almost time for this season's battle harem that's a loose mix of Chrome Shell Regios meets Ar tonelico.<br><br>Let's take it easy and have a comfy thread.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm only watching because you said Ar Tonelico and if it doesn't live up to it I'm going to be mad at you anon</br></br>  <br>he also said battle harem</br>  <br>Oh, it is that time of the week.

I just hope the battle harem aspects don't fuck up a decent premise/setting too much. I already kinda dislike pretty much all three of what appear to be the main girls but maybe they'll be better after the first episode.</br>  Oh fuck. I forgot Chrome Shelled Regios existed. Fuck. Now I remember that there will never be a sequel.  <br><br>Sadly so, but CSR's LNs are fully translated save the gaidens. Take comfort in that. It was a good ride and a wonderful end for Layfon and Felli. The story may have ended, but their journey continues on.

Mir, Finnel, and Cas are tsundere, so that's half right there. <br><br>Mir is beyond a shadow of doubt a tsundere. The second game, the drama CDs, and the toukousphere are in agreement. Mir is technically a kuutsundere, so she's part kuudere.<br><br> At <br> shit girls <br>Pick one, fag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We use so many paradigm to make them less tsundere to make them whole heartedly trust the MC and finally submit to their love also bring them confidence. Is not that different</br>  <br>The MC also a teacher the same as the ar tonelico protag to make the girls show their true power.</br>  <br>Shit taste, and Mir isn't tsun at all, did you even play the goddamn games? She doesn't even give a shit if you see her naked, a tsundere would slap the shit out of you for seeing her panties.<br><br>Mir and Aurica are the best girls. AT2 Cocona is slightly below, along with Filament and Shurelia. Metafalica has the best music but no good girls other than Cocona and Mir/Jakuri.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget tsundere Akane. She deserves a mention. And let's not forget the best boys of EXA_PICO that are tsundere too. There are quite a few of them.<br><br>On a somewhat related but different note. Where is that one anon who was working to compile a nigh-complete collection of EXA_PICO music/drama CDs/special albums/etc? I hope he is stilm alive and well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you watch all of those? I couldn't get through an episode of either Absolute Duo or Isuca.</br>  <br>If you managed to finish Isuca than you can stomach everything of this genre</br>  <br> Disagreeing with all-around perfectly accept and great taste <br>Really?<br><br> She doesn't even give a shit if you see her naked <br>Mir didn't know the concept of shame, idiot. Of course she wouldn't be bother by that, especially if humans sees her. She looks down on humans and thinks they're like, well, insects after all. <br> a tsundere would slap the shit out of you for seeing her panties. <br>You obviously no idea what tsundere means and are stuck on a very narrow minded definition of tsundere. You're even going against word of God. <br> Aurica  <br> best <br>Even though there aren't any real bad girls, I would have to consider Aurica as just mid tier. She isn't that great. <br><br>Mir was always best above all. But since Cas came along, that spot can be vied for. Nay-san can also be a likely contender.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AD was great, Isuca was godawful and I only watched it for Isuca being dere</br>  <br> He didn't watch Absolute Duo for Julie and Isuca for Sakuya <br>You're missing out imo. Sure, they are a lot of things wrong (especially for Isuca), but it's the girls that you should watch for. Some of the battles in Absolute Duo are quite awesomely animated and have cool choreography too, so there's that</br></br>  <br> Isuca for Sakuya <br>How fucking retarded</br></br>  <br>The anime doesn't do justice to her as she should be like in the manga, but she's still quite adorable and deliciously sex. Isuca is also good too though, I suppose. She's the kind of crazy that you can't take your eyes off since she's fun and interesting.</br>  <br>I'm retarded, but isn't the main girl names Isuca?</br>  How long till the episode airs in Nipland?  <br>Yes, the main girl's real name is Isuca, but there's also a girl name Isuca too. I'll just say that the two are related in some way. There's some crazy history in the latter thus why she's trying to kill everyone the former's family and those she likes.<br><br><br>About 36 mins left.</br></br></br></br>  <br>everyone of the*</br>  Anyone else like Yuri?

I searched archive to the best of my ability to be sure, but I don't see any recent At/EXA_PICO threads, thus no update from that anon. I can only assume it also hasn't happened yet.</br></br>  <br>It is. <br>Its just that Blade Dance thread turn into shitstorm immediately since the anime aired.</br></br>  I don't even know why I even bother giving harems a chance every season.<br><br>It's all the same shit.</br></br>  <br>People just need to accept that Claire is best girl, threads would be much better then.</br>  <br>They could be good if the MC is entertaining or at least not a generic blushing retard, like in this case</br>  <br>Claire is at least about high tier. But you know most don't care to shitpost and vocally hate her though. It's a small group of vocal anti-fans that make noise and causes shitstorm. That's about true for most fanbases that has issues with a combative loud bunch that burns threads to stroke their taste.</br>  <br>I'm not sure as well, things are quite hectic so I rarely browse /a/.<br><br>Maybe next month, at least another EXA_PICO thread might pop up. This month's EXA_PICO thread is not yet being started. (Unless this is this month's thread)</br></br></br>  <br>How can it be?

No Reyvateils and Hymmnos can be excused because different of universe and setting, but godly music should at least be present, preferably in some made-up language. The soundtrack here  is pretty close to Ar tonelico's tune of music, but it isn't enough. I suppose we'll have to see though.</br>  This show is rather bad. Let's have an AT thread instead.<br>Mir is best Reyvateil</br>  <br>Yes, it has a good art and CG.</br>  <br>Alight.

I'm sure of it.</br></br>  <br>I caught most of it, just missed some of the finer details.</br>   They actually explained it   <br> I got hated and given a nickname because I failed other's people expectations.  <br><br>Welcome to life, you fucking faggots.</br></br></br>  Man, this MC knows how to sweet talk and come out on top unfazed against these girls.  <br> who's simply haughty about her own abilities <br>So yeah she's simply a bitch</br></br>  More stitch porn incoming.    <br>I remember hagure yuushayuusha when I look at the mc.</br>  The MC is based  <br>this. He's the reason I watch this</br>  <br>Any 1920x1080 onesÉ</br>  <br>What's your problem, are you just trolling or seriously have a sensitivity problem at the slightest disagreeable attitude? She is like virtually not overbearing at all. She caves easily under pressure that gets her receding into a vulnerable little girl. She quickly gets back up because she wants to prove her worth and her abilities. The whole thing is done with cute tone.</br>  This sounds incredibly lewd.  <br>Isn't 1080 an upscale? Only HS has 1080 releases and I think their subs can't be turned off.</br>  This shit is fun. Why do people dislike this again? <br><br>As a haremfag I'm loving this.</br></br>  Did the funi rip fuck up for anyone else at 11.42?<br>It cuts out in the middle of unsubbed dialogue, then skips to the ad break.<br>Checked the raw and it has about 30 seconds of additional video, which the funi rip fucked up.<br><br><br>Probably the OST and setting. It's unexpectedly comfy as fuck, for an apocalyptic [insert mysterious monsters that attack humanity here] theme.<br><br><br><br>My niggas.<br><br><br>Me too anon, me too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they force themselves to watch something they don't like to complain needlesly</br>  <br><br><br>What was the anime like? Worth watching, just to get a feel for the characters, before starting the LN from volume 1?<br>Or was it irredeemable garbage that should be avoided?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eh, a small following is probably best for this show. It's cool if there's only several of us. AT least we'll have each other. I'll be here every week making stitches too.<br><br>Anyways, I'm enjoying this show quite a lot myself. It adequate in satisfying my fix for (battle) harem. The MC is honestly good, even possibly refreshing for being nonchalant, understanding, competent, confident, and a pretty smooth talker. When you add in the fact he is OP'd/special, all that might make him sound like a gary stu, but his attitude and depiction in the story mostly avoid that by not putting him on a pedestal. <br><br>The girls aren't that bad at all too. They are generic, very much so, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Tedious perhaps for some, but not inherently bad. I can see them growing on me and can foresee the three of them overcoming their drawbacks and flaws, so they have room to grow. They have poor team work now, but that surely will change from the ragtag team they are now, so it'll be cool to witness them kick ass together via real teamwork.<br><br>The setting is something I really like, which I do chalk it up to something that came out of CSR x AT. The scenery and setting backgrounds that reflects CSR x AT are visually pleasing and quite stunning, so that only makes it better for me. Oh yeah, comfy soundtrack is nice too in making the show relaxing and entertaining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did the funi rip fuck up for anyone else at 11.42? <br>They did<br>Goddamit, first Overlord, then Logos and now this. Fucking funishit</br></br></br>  The CG is horrible, but the MC's cool and it has the same char designer as Full Metal Panic. Music's nice too.    Because why not.  <br>CSR's anime is okay. The LN is far better, but the anime is helpful in giving some characters a voice and tone that you can feel and sort out. Felli's seiyuu does a great job and there is delicious Felli to be seen in the anime, so it's worth checking out anyways.</br>  Done for today. I think.  <br>This is on par with Mahou Sensou.</br>  <br>Let's not go crazy, anon. MS is a trainwreck. This show has yet to become a trainwreck.</br>  No   A chill and visually pleasing Kuusen Madoushi <br>Wow. Ar tonelicofriends are miracle workers. I hope every thread will be like this. I would start looking forward to the weekly threads instead of avoiding them beyond a quick glance every so often. <br><br>Anywaya, I enjoyed episode two. It was much better than the first episode. The MC is mostly carrying the show, but the girls are cute and I like the intwresting premise of badass MC becoming an instructor for a dysfunctional team.<br><br>Also, thanks stitch anon for contributing.</br></br></br></br></br>  I like Rico the best but that's because I haven't seen many female narcissistic characters before. It's typically always a guy that fills that role if it's present. Rest of the show is pretty ho hum just doing the routines.  <br>You're drunk anon, go to sleep.</br>  <br> This is on par with Mahou Sensou. <br>No. So far it's okay. Could turn into shit though, so here's to hoping.</br></br>  Misora a shit. <br><br>A SHIT.</br></br>  <br> The story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. Thus wizards—aerial combat mages who fight the insects with magical powers—came into being. <br><br>Kanata Age is a young man who lives on the floating wizard academy city of "Misutogan." He was once celebrated as the "Black Master Swordsman," the elite ace of the S128 special team; however, he is now despised as the "traitor of the special team." One day, he is assigned as the instructor of E601, a team that has suffered ten consecutive defeats. E601 has three girls—Misora Whitale, Lecty Eisenach, and Rico Flamel—with one or two peculiar quirks.<br><br>This is literately Chrome Shelled Regios with more harem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> with more harem <br>Fon Fon had a huge harem man, he just ignored them all for the worst girl until he woke the fuck up and started romancing Felli</br></br>  <br>But this guy doesn't even have a harem.</br>  <br>  first few minutes of the episode <br>  MC tells her to shut up <br><br>This show is definitely one I'm sticking eith.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still. So is it better that CSR? Is it vastly different when you actually get into it? Are the characters authentic and not just cutouts?<br><br>Is this shit worth watching, Anon?</br></br></br>  <br>That was priceless</br>  <br>No idea not a LNfag for this series, just pointing out that Fonfon had 6 or so girls after his dick.</br>   Opening the door to a girl's changeroom <br>MC is clearly to be blamed for that</br>   Funi fucking around half-way through the episode   <br> no sub group picked it up </br>  You people really watch this pile of shit? I watched the first 12 minutes and had to drop it because of the amount of stupid cliches and the abysmal quality of it all.  <br>i wonder why</br>  <br>I watch it for the based MC.<br>Yeah, the first 12 minutes is painful to watch.</br></br>  <br>I don't blame them. Although fansubbing is dying anyways.</br>  <br>I'm watching it for the stupid cliches and terrible quality.</br>  <br>All it skipped was him saying "let's play tag" right?</br>  <br>What happened to childhood friend? She didn't get the Fon-Fon Dite?</br>  <br>She kind of turned him down to become queen.<br><br>To be fair he was being a massive shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't know, but  claims it to be around 30 seconds.</br>  Misora a shit  The budget for this show is appalling. They can't even afford to animate talking heads for too long.  <br>At least i like the ED. I just hope this also get an Unlimited fafnir tier attention where someone likes it that he started translating the LN.</br>  <br>UF anime was terrible and sleep inducing. Even in the middle of the day. Also fuck TBS and their latecast policy. It killed any possible discussion during winter</br>  Why would anyone watch this when we see the MC die in the first minutes of the first episode?  <br> Die <br>Lol, no. Second episodes says he runs away like a bitch. And episode 1 say's they just lose memory.</br></br>  <br> Like a bitch <br>Eh, at least he is alive. He was strong as fuck, much stronger than the team with him there. Was he supposed to die? What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Wizards remember the people that die but the normal people don't. <br><br>Also based on the injury talk and MC using the board thing I bet he can't fly anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>It will be revealed soon unless you like reading books.</br>  <br>I already read the Overlord and Rokka no Yuusha's ln this season. I've had enough of reading shitty prose.</br>  <br> OF YOU </br>  <br>my bad, i was not actually referring the attention UF got just because it was good but rather a special case of attention where people got interested in novels more than the anime since it was translated in fast speed.</br>   refined movements   <br>He was obviously talking about her fighting before her shyness kicked in.</br>  <br>Pretty sure you can watch everything, anon.</br>  <br>It hurts watching. My body just rejects this show, but I have to keep watching. <br><br>Why are two of the three main girls gutter shit? And the other one is decent, if not for being the scared/shy to the max. <br>Why is the mc walking into the changing room? At least use an excuse for that like they have been in there for over an hour, so it doesn't seem like a cringe scene #3000<br>Why are all the conversation so cringe with the mc and the main girls? Before that, why are the main girls conversation cringe? They should've used the A-team members instead if they would be better than the main characters, and even they're mediocre. <br>And holy shit if there's already this much of an issue with the budget I really don't want to see how the rest will turn up. <br><br>Please tell me that the source material is better, or at least gets better after a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is so bully-able.</br>    <br>I feel like you wouldn't even get a chance to bully her before she starts apologizing. It's kind of annoying, I hope she gets better.</br>  Misora is pure shit. The other two girls at least have serviceable skill/technique but Misora just acts like a retard. What good is her speed/stamina if she has absolutely no real combat training from the looks of it? Uses her weapon like it's the first time she's ever held it and can't even see through the most simplest of combat maneuvers. Cut your losses and boot that dumb bitch out.  <br>useless moe</br>  <br> Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan <br> Ar tonelico. <br>Nigger don't you dare say such a thing.</br></br></br>  <br>From what I can tell all that was cut was a small tease by MC, "let's play tag", and their reactions. Nothing too serious, but still not excusable.</br>  Animation is complete dogshit and its mostly tripe, but its still more watchable than some of the other shit this season.  <br>Posting best girl</br>  <br>Fucking 3d models just like KC</br>  <br>The MC's coat?</br>  <br>Whoops, posted wrong image</br>  <br>Misora is garbage.</br>  <br> expecting good animation from diomedea <br>personally i have zero expectations when diomedea handles a show since UF and WB happened.</br></br>  <br>Agreed.Misora is the cutest girl as of yet.</br>  <br>You're joking right? I thought it was agreed upon that Diomedia was the best studio for shitty battle harems.</br>   There are people who don't think Misora is best girl   <br>I know. Some people aren't subhumans.</br>  I want to _______ Red  <br>take responsibility for the outcome of coming inside</br>  <br>eviscerate</br>  <br>mindbreak</br>  <br><br>Hot-headed baka moe is moe. It is a shame anti-tsunfags still are trying hard to hate her by desperate means.</br></br>  <br>He was talking about the animation, and he's right. Making those 4 other shows definitely drained them.<br><br>At least WB made fun of its own QUALITY but you can't pull that shit twice in a row.</br></br></br>  <br>She's like not even violent, right?

Those songs are sex</br></br>  <br>danké</br>  <br>i was talking about animation and not about if it's the best studio for haremshit since it doesn't count as an achievement considering only few studios do haremshit this year while diomedea did 3 haremshit this year(besides the studio handling Absolute duo has tolerable animation than diomedea which made webm related)</br>  <br><br/></br>  Real best girl passing by.  <br>That midriff, muh dick.</br>  <br>I'll keep watching it to see this apathetic MC doing something, it could be fun.</br>  <br><br>Ignore obvious shitposts and bait, guys. This thread has been mostly nice and comfy for half a day, so it's counterproductive for detractors to be forceful out of nowhere.</br></br>  <br>So this is going to be repeat of the shit he was doing with Strike the Blood threads?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Who is THK?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retards think only one person hates tsundere and they call THK anyone who hates them.</br>  Misora is best. She is cute and a ball of fun energy. I like that she does have some skills and talent behind her boasting, but is in needed of refinement and proper training to make her a good all-rounder.  <br>Misora a shit.</br>  <br>Worse. He tried for a repeat of Blade Dance in the first week. We had a couple of threads be wasn't around for and the difference is huge (no chain spams, especially the absence of constantly agreeing posts over every little shitposts).<br><br><br>You must be pretty new here. Well, don't let THK himself trick you. Search the archive for "THK" to see for yourself. THK banned and THK exposed will show you serious autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool story bro.</br>  <br>I like her too. It's usually the feisty ones that tend to make my pants tight.</br>  <br><br>I just find her whole 'TRAITOR HENTAI' thing really fucking annoying. Her voice doesn't help either. She's just irritating.</br></br>  <br>She's one of those girls who work best in small doses.</br>  <br>You have horrible taste.</br>  Pic related is better  <br> TRAITOR HENTAI <br>I don't care for that. It's a gag in the series that they all do, so it's like whatever.<br> voice doesn't help either. <br>But her voice is ear sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit dat shit taste.</br>    <br>So why is he a traitor, what really happened?</br>  <br>Go find something else to do, THK. You're beyond stale now ever since you entered the thread to reply to every single post for Misora in the form of shitpost.</br>   Lecty has zero fans itt <br>Lecty confirmed worst girl.</br>  <br> silence counts as no argument <br>popularity begets shitposting</br></br>  <br>That wasn't me by the way. That was someone else who replied to you. Don't assume I'm THK or whatever.<br>I like tsundere when they're done right. Misora isn't. She's obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> THK <br>dank</br></br>  <br> That wasn't me by the way. <br>I can tell. THK wouldn't be as reserved as you.<br> obnoxious <br>Curious. How and compared what other similar tsundere?</br></br></br></br>  <br> anyone disagreeing their favorite tsundere <br> uses THK as the first excuse to shit on those who dont like their tsunderes. <br>even if THK actually exist, im thinking anons uses THK as a scapegoat to justify that their tsundere character is the best even though some of them are shit in some degrees.</br></br></br>  When is Felli going to show up?  <br>You're right, that's why the THK spouting retards get BTFO in threads like this<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127739<wbr>327</wbr></br></br>  <br>Lecty's shyness is really annoying.</br>  <br>How can it be. It has good CG and art so it's not abymal at all.</br>  <br>I want to like her, I really do. She was my favorite when she started dual wielding, but she just kept being shy and annoying. I've moved into Black's camp as she was my second favorite and hasn't done anything wrong yet.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/t<wbr>hk%20moe/<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/t<wbr>hk%20exposed/<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/t<wbr>hk%20banned/<br>Don't be so new. THK is completely different from those who merely dislike or even hate tsundere. This has been proven many times by tracing back his patterned shitposts and insane autism. See  and then look at &gt;&gt; 128128947 <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127536238 . Even when he gets called out, he still does it anyways. Many knows about THK by now after 3 years of him shitting up /a/. Aside from his apologists and cheap clones, anyone sane enough would avoid defending or copying a serious shitposter like him. <br><br>If THK wasn't autistic as he is and only voiced his opinions like a normal poster, hardly anyone would care about him since he'll just get lost in the sea of posts. But no, his goal is to undermine the entirety of tsundere and spread falsified hate, and that is the real problem with him.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>You can take off that tinfoil hat and stop being ridiculous anytime.</br>  <br>You can't argue against those links and reasoning. Those are specific, blatant distinctive shitposts used for years in the form of clockwork. <br> https://archive.moe/a/search/text/<wbr>%22Misora%20a%20shit%22/</wbr> <br>An idiot with half a brain could still cross-reference all that to THK's typical shitposts and penchant to samefag like he did in  (funny how drastic the thread changes when he goes to sleep).</br></br></br>  <br>Senketsu upload their softsub and there is ahsh</br>  <br>Misora &gt; Yuri &gt; Chloe &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty</br>  <br>There is no good battle yet? it seems the pacing is slow? That's not fun for battle anime.</br>  <br>It just started man</br>  <br>If this episode is any indication, I hope you enjoy CGI battles when/if they actually happen.</br>  <br>RIco's sister &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty &gt; Misora &gt; Chloe &gt; Devil Beetle &gt; Yuri</br>  <br>Chloe &gt; Yuri &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty &gt; shit &gt; Misora</br>  <br>Not exactly slow, but more relaxing and building up for bug invasion. As I recall, LNfag said the series mostly focuses on school tournaments. So a large part of the story will spend time developing the team so they can work together and raise their rank. The MC normally doesn't fight the bugs when they become a problem (for good reason), so he sends the trio and Chloe to deal with the bugs under his direction. It's that sort of thing.</br>  <br> not getting accustomed to the pacing for battle harem novels. <br>based on experience, most of novels where 3 episodes consist of 1 volume it is quite rare to see 2 episodes of fighting and a single episode of SOL and other stuff.</br></br>  <br> Misora &gt; Yuri &gt; Chloe &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty <br>I am okay with this.</br></br>  Is this better or worse than Seiken Tsukai no World Break? In terms of entertainment value, of course, it's not like there's any literary value in battle harems.  <br> Chloe &gt; Yuri &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty &gt; shit &gt; Misora <br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  <br>It's too early to tell.</br>  <br>The main girls are almost the same, but as shitty as Misora is, at least she isn't as horrible as that steaming pile of shit named Claire.</br>  <br> Mocking me because I agree with taste you are mad at <br>That's pretty sad.</br></br>  <br> being mad because more than one person hates the shitty tsundere <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Go away THK</br>  <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread//#q12<wbr>7804904</wbr> <br>Go to bed, THK.</br></br>  <br> In terms of entertainment value <br>It's pretty hard to beat WB at that, and this isn't even close.</br></br>  <br><br>Nice phone m8</br></br>  <br>No, but you clearly did that out of mockery for reactions. You got your reaction, but it's still sad you have to samefag like that.</br>  Misora is really cute  <br> it's samefag because it angers me <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br> Hates Claire <br> Hates even Misora <br>Now this is shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>No, THK. But there's no point trying to convince you.</br>  <br> phone <br>You of all people should know that better than anyone.</br></br>  <br>The anime is going to be horrible though, you know they're cramming in 9 volumes into 2 cour.</br>  <br> he LIKES Claire </br>  <br>That was such an idiotic decision.</br>  <br>You never have once been able to argue why she is so bad for you whenever thoughtful posts arguing why she is cute and developed were thrown at you. Don't pretend otherwise.</br>  <br> You <br>Who?<br>Even novelfags dislike Claire.</br></br></br>  <br> Merely pretending <br>That again, huh.<br><br> dislike <br>Yeah, that's why she's in the top 3 in the poll for LNfags, right? Fuck off already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a pretty big gap between the first two and her though.</br>  <br> he thinks I'm talking about Japan <br><br>Weren't you here for the early threads about the series? Barely anyone supported Claire at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Does not change my point. Est and Restia are simply more popular, Est especially by a huge margin compared to everyone else.<br><br><br>I was there for the whole season and before. Before the anime aired and months the season began, we had occasional STnBD threads. Those pre-air threads we had were decent and had nil shitposting. Waifu ranking happened sometimes and they hardly caused terrible waifu wars. Claire had her fair share of detractor, many whom didn't hate the way you do, but also a few novelfags who likes her most or a lot (I being one of them). <br><br>For those who read the LN and didn't like Claire at the start, they at least acknowledge that she gets better and develops, so the atmosphere is completely different from the hate you keep forcing when the anime started.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> didn't hate the way you do <br> the hate you keep <br><br>Who are you even talking to? Not everyone is out to get you.</br></br></br></br>  I don't know why this made me laugh but it did.  I like Claire and Misora. Adorable red hair tsundere with cheeky personalities and small tits are my fetish.<br><br>Haters are gonna hate etc.</br></br>  <br> Implying you aren't  pretending. </br>  <br>Nope.</br>   Even if THK were to die tomorrow his name will be brought up forever in any series that features a red haired Tsundere <br>He has become immortal</br>  <br>That's how retarded THKfags are.</br>  <br> Kirino <br> Claire <br> Misora </br></br></br>  <br> Gets thrown off MC's trail by a simple maneuver <br> Is like a lost animal trying to hunt down her prey she wants to wack <br> Is still at it dozens of minutes in grumpy fashion <br>Misora is cute, like really cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unlikely. If THK were to truly drop dead tomorrow, /a/ would become a much better place and nearly every threads he previous stalked to shitpost in would have a lot less shitty waifu wars and almost no a shit. A SHIT spams. People wouldn't call out THK when THK no longer posts.</br>  So I just watched the first two episodes.<br><br>I tend to watch all harems in a season if I've seen previous seasons or if it's the first season.<br><br>The first episode was fucking horrible, like even worse than Isuca.<br><br>Episode two however was pretty great and besides the chuuni bitch it was very enjoyable.<br><br>Ep3 looks great as well, I wish they could be more consistent with Misora's breasts size though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that's all bullshit. People will still retardely keep calling anyone who dislikes tsundere THK.</br>  <br> Kirino <br> Claire <br> Misora <br>Good taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying THK's death wont be used by minority of tsunderefags to shit on those who disagree their favorites <br>i'm not saying all of tsunderefags but what i am saying is quite possible since every fanbase has their own shitposter here on /a/</br></br>  <br>It looks like another SAO</br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br><br>There are bad seeds in virtually every fanbase. It could be idiots, reverse trolls, or those that wants to abuse it as a meme for their own means. But bad seeds typically are a minority. The majority and those who only would call THK out when it's a post he would undoubtedly make wouldn't if THK is no longer posting.</br></br>  <br><br>I was about to post something similar. The first episode was pretty bad, but second episode was better. The MC is pretty decent, too, which is probably the main thing that's keeping me watching this. Heroine-wise I don't really have a favorite, though I guess if I were to choose it'd be Rico because she's the funniest and her negative traits are a bit more tolerable than the two others'.<br><br>There's one thing I don't get yet: Everyone calling Kanata a "traitor." They say it's because he "skips" on missions, but from the hints in the second episode (using a floating device instead of a flight spell, Chloe saying that he's on "sick leave," not attacking the heroines during training) it seems he's lost most of his powers or something. I'm guessing he lost them because of that giant Devil Beetle in the prologue. If this is the case, how is he a "traitor" for holding off and nearly dying to hundreds of Beetles to save his team and not being able to fight due to his injuries? Is it explained further in the novel?</br></br></br></br>  How far is too far?  <br>He is not telling the truth that he is dying.</br>  <br><br><br>As someone who points out LRD and THK, I can say that it takes certain requirements for me do that. Random and generic tsun/loli haters usually don't cut it.</br></br></br>  <br>If you can stomach ar tonelico you can stomach all these bitches. This resemble ar tonelico more than you think.</br>  <br>I actually laughed out loud reading his character bio.<br>That's some Kirito level edge.</br></br>  <br>The OP said Ar Tonelico. There is nothing too far for Ar Tonelico standard though.</br>  <br>Relevant spoilers for you.<br><br> The MC used to be a super genius in both tactic, magic, and battle skill. During his plunge down planet earth The MC ran into a boss and was infected with The Dark Force. This Dark Force continuously feed on his total possible MP, and the MC keeps it in check with his remaining MP.<br><br>After he returned, he quits (take holiday) all patrol, fighting, and inner-school activities as he has no power remain. He also doesn't want others know he is infected with The Dark Force. Others thought he became a coward from his near death experience and despite him.<br><br>You won't see him fight much as he doesn't have much power remaining. Yes he can use the Dark Force and go berserk, but it speeds up its rate of power devour and he would like to stay as a human for as long as he can. He usually uses it to only power 1 blow. Mostly it's his students and his childhood friend that fights the bug under his direction.<br><br>So the MC knows he is going to die soon, but he wants to leave something for humanity before he dies (or turn into bugs). So he agrees to teach these 3 girls all of his battle skills. Basically a 'took an arrow in the knee and now I stay behind and teach youngsters the way of battle' sort of thing.<br><br><br>You probably are not surprise to learn that the boss removed The Dark Force from his body in volume 5/6. So now he can use his original magical power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br> There is a girl in this show right now that is kinda similar to Finnel <br>And I like it.</br></br>  <br>This tbh</br>  <br>From spoilers I read  his powers got really fucked with by that fight with the beatle but it's not something he can really reveal since his power changed. Basically it became some kind of weird mix of his original power and the power the beatles use. At the same time it's possibly stronger but he went from being able to basically use his power whenever to having a strict limit on how long he can use it now, why he has to use the board for flight. He keeps his condition a secret from pretty much everyone though.<br><br>Basically he's considered a traitor because he was the top ace and hero and now he refuses to fight or participate in anything. His goal is to train/find a replacement ace. </br></br> </br>  <br>You had me, anon.<br>This would actually be quite interesting, but that final spoiler made me lose that interest immediately, what a cop out if true.</br></br>  <br>Go watch the OP, and pay attention to when he goes full edge master.<br><br>Berserks are fun!</br></br></br>  <br>Who? It can't be Yuri...so Misora?</br>  <br>Can it reach that volume to let's see the true power of the MC or it will just focus on Ar Tonelico type of game that makes the girls can show their true power and skill.</br>  <br><br><br><br> Interesting. I guess the reason he doesn't at least inform his friends of what's happening to him is because he doesn't want them to worry about him? Too bad it seems Yuri hates him, though. <br><br>That last spoiler, though. Weird of them to go that route. Is the story nearing its end or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Misora? <br> Yes. </br></br>  <br>Are you want to die of sickness for killing a jacko type of villain more of this shit is just an insect.</br>  THK please save us  <br><br>Yeah, that last spoiler irks me. The series would be quite the gem if it took the route of MC dying in the end and his students taking up his mantle after instilling them of his skills and teaching sort of end. Epilogue flashforward years into the future to see a glimpse of what became of his students and the outcome of the war (if there is any).</br></br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Misora a shit.<br><br>A SHIT<br><br>S<br>H<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would he keep secret that he got infected and seek help instead?</br>  <br><br>Finnel is second best AT3. Misora is current best KMKnK.</br></br>  <br>Misora took a dump while MC watches?</br>  <br>Misora a shit though.</br>  <br><br>He doesn't exist.</br></br>  I want to _______ THK  <br>   You probably are not surprise to learn that the boss removed The Dark Force <br>Why? Is it a loli and loves him?</br></br>  <br><br>What is THK doing here?</br></br>  <br> THK <br>dank</br></br>  <br>This is a THK-approved thread.</br>  Why do they use kirito's voice for this low budget anime?  <br>Matsuoka is a template for harem battle LN anime MC</br>  <br>I like you.</br>  <br>What an ugly whore.</br>  <br>kill</br>  <br>marry</br>  <br>erase the meme called</br>  <br>burn</br>  <br>Prolly There is no cure for such very rare disease more of it's a magic disease.</br>  <br>support the holy cause of</br>  <br> Teasing and bullying Misora even though she is amiable to Lecty and you <br>Why is RIco such a bitch?</br></br>  <br>raise a family with</br>  <br>Prolly because he is quite handsome ?</br>  <br>perm ban</br>  <br>murder</br>  Why couldn't anyone save this show?<br><br>Why must I download FUNi shit to watch it? ;_;</br></br>  <br>She's the best.</br>  <br>It's not low budget at all. IT has PRETTY ART AND PRETTY CG</br>  <br>Misora is just a shit you mongoloid Misorafag.</br>  <br>This generic shit deserves funi.</br>  <br>For those that like Matsuoka, he's in that one show Makura Danshi as one of the boys that talk you to sleep. He plays a chuuni so it sounds like it'll be a great time.</br>  <br>Not ending at all. It's in the past soon in vol 5 or 6 based on spoiler said he will be free again from the disease or 'curse' .</br>  <br>Rico's entire flaw hinges on having a bad personality. Her BS is honestly the weakest out of the three. She has perfect grades and is competent, but what stops her from being a good wizard is because for her narcissistic personality? That is hard to swallow.</br>  <br>Come on, Isuca got DDY, I REMEMBER got FFF, Absolute Duo got Chihiro. Maou testament got FFF and Hiryuu, Fafnir got FFF.<br><br>And then just one battle harem and no one picks it up.</br></br></br>  <br>There AHSH or senketsu that sub it. it 's already out long enough.</br>  <br> Rico <br>She's still better than Lecty at least.</br></br>  <br>Gee, that sounds a bit familiar.</br>  <br>Lecty is still better than Misora at least.</br>  <br>There is, are you even looking. It's even posted at the beginning of the thread.</br>  <br>Lecty a shit.</br>  <br> AHSH <br>Those are just FUNi rips</br></br>  <br>Confirmed strongest magical girl.</br>  <br>torture and skin</br>  <br>Not as shitty as Misora.</br>  <br>Nobody likes Lecty. Nobody.</br>  Rico is too amazing, oh wow. Misora is cute when she's angry, and Lecty is the usual shy blob of cuteness I can't hate (with a bonus Nao to make her even better).<br>I think I'm enjoying this show.</br>  <br>Nope. MIsora &gt;&gt; Rico &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lecty</br>  <br>Go senketsu then.<br>You can download the raw if you want and download senketsu soft subs.</br></br>  <br>Nope.<br>Rico &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lecty &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Misora</br></br>  <br>I-I do.</br>  We can argue all day about best girl.<br><br>But it is near-unanimous that Lecty is the worst girl.</br></br>  <br>Yeh funi is not funi they cut some period of scene mostly they're not aware.</br>  <br>I don't think it's the same thing. Gil can get shit done by himself. His main issue is merely arrogance that prevents him from using Ea.</br>  I missed my red haired tsundere anime last season.<br><br>glad this is airing</br></br>  <br>Truth reflected ITT.</br>  <br>Let's be fair here. One of them uses a sniper rifle and the other has millions of weapons. Their weakness is still the same, arrogance and thinking far too highly of themselves.</br>  We can argue all day about best girl.<br><br>But it is near-unanimous that Misora is the worst girl.</br></br>  <br>She has not losing somethng dear to her like what gilgamesh had experienced,</br>  <br>Well, people like Yuki and Haruhi a lot more than Mikuru, so it makes sense.</br>  <br>She's objectively best girl</br>  <br>Amen.</br>  <br>Too bad your autistic shitposting in here doesn't count as majority.</br>  <br>Truth reflected ITT.</br>  <br>No. Red is best.</br>  Only beta ass niggas like tsunderes. Letting a woman walk all over you? What kind of man are you? lel  <br>Your post is objectively wrong and shit.<br><br><br>No. Red is garbage.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Parroting and copying others to mock them <br>Again? When you have to samefag and do shit like this, it's just sad.</br></br></br>  <br>off yourself laddie</br>  <br>Stop posting shit.</br>  <br>Only real betas can't handle tsundere and be man enough to allow them to be cute.<br> lel <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>This is bait.</br>  <br>All I hear is<br><br> bawwwwww </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>sure thing m80 I bet you like NTR and femdom too you fucking beta</br></br></br>  <br>The harder people shit on THK and disagree with him, the more rabid and louder THK gets. That's how he always is.</br>  <br> THK <br>Your meme power is over 9000</br></br>  <br> NTR <br> femdom <br><br>Stop trying so hard.</br></br></br></br>  THK trying to keep up by shitposting harder is amusing.  THK a shit. A SHIT.  <br><br>Cool phone lad</br></br>  <br>You are missing the rest.<br><br> <br>they always have a giant bug army invade the city at the end of every volume (usually interrupt their inner-school battle). And the MC would notice some anomaly with the bugs. He would lead his fire team to secretly penetrate the defense and figure out what's going on. His students would mop up the bugs there under his direction. Then a super bug would appear and the MC will prepare his super while his students defend him. At the end no one would know what they have done, and his fire team goes back to losing every inner-school battle.<br><br>Also, since the girls are his students, he doesn't show any romantic traits towards them (like how a normal teacher wouldn't lay his hands on his students).<br><br>His childhood Nanoha-esque child friend, on the other hand...let's just say his interactions with her definitely prove that the MC is not gay.<br><br>RIP, red, yellow, dark blue, some shade of blue, and white. <br><br>At least up to volume 5, the flow of affection is rather...one sided.<br><br>The MC pretty much ignore all their advances while openly engage in old-married-couple mode with his childhood friend (to the jealousy of red, and it becomes her main motivation in volume 4.) <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  THK the anime when?  <br><br>MIsora is just adorable. I want to take her home and have her do my personal exams if you know what I mean.</br></br>   The only reason I like Tsunderes is because I can't stop thinking about raping and mindbreaking them to be completely subservient  <br>Can't be the only one right?</br>  <br>Stop. You're embarrassing yourself, THK.</br>  Well, this thread went to shit(ter) fast.  <br>That's half the reason why I love them. Welcome to the fold, brother.</br>  <br> Wait until THK sleeps. </br>  <br>Says the autistic tsunderefag crybaby. Kek.</br>  <br>Isn't that common among tsundere fans? Part of the appeal is to break their tsun and have them be submissive. Rape or angry sex is amazing too.</br>  <br>This.</br>  I want to fuck Rectys Rectum  Eccentric hime &gt; Purple not-Houki &gt; Tsundere Red = Shy Yellow  <br>Yeah like the LN with his cute senpai but in the end he married his 'adopted' kid.</br>  <br>Fuck off THK</br>  <br>Nice falseflagging there, THK.</br>  <br> when I do it, it's not falseflagging! <br>Shut up retard, I want to call out THK and his shit taste too.</br></br>  <br> I want to call out THK and his shit taste too. <br><br><br>Thats exactly what THK would say to rile people up and get everyone talking about him again. You're not fooling me THK</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not remotely convincing all, THK. All your rankings in this thread always put Misora last and less than shit. There's no way your autism would allow MIsora to not be worst or less than shit.</br>  <br><br>THK pls</br></br>  My sides, why is this show so fun?  Jesus fuck, what is with the THK boogeyman and the anti THK sperglord? Can't you just be a normal /a/utist and complain about the shitty production values, &gt;funishit, and fake LN spoilers?  we arr all THK  <br>THK keeps the thread up though, based THK.</br>  <br> THK trying to deflect attention off himself <br><br><br>Oldest trick in the book THK</br></br></br></br>  <br>Expecting old hag to win against this young middle schooler.

You're past FOTM tier by now.<br><br>A muse would be great.</br></br></br>  <br>For that price I figured I may as well jump on it - it was either that or keep stalking manda for her. considering the price I'd pay to ship a single prize fig from Manda to Aus, combining her with my ami order this month was an easy choice.</br>  <br>The same as this one.</br>  <br>Thanks, now I'm sure I'm 100% jelly.</br>  <br>It hasn't been that long since she was painted, patience.</br>  Hey lets post our preorders, and instead of saying mean things, we complement them unless Pochacho.  <br>fuck you not again</br>  Fucking hell.

Too bad hot dogs are disgusting.</br>  <br>I have that one. Love her. She's the only of Taito's Sonico prize figures I really like. The rest have been all pretty poor, even for prizes.</br>  <br>You have some nice points for that Guts, that sexy MoMo and the Yusha, but all points were lost by that porkchacoshit</br>  Help guys.<br>I want to get into hotgluing but im having trouble deciding between getting a Pochaco or Cattleya figure.<br>Which one should I get?</br></br>  <br>Just a nendoroid and it's apparently in the city over.</br>  <br>pochaco is cuter</br>   MFC user wants to sell a figure "ASAP everything needs to go!!!" <br> I contact the seller <br> Few days later, no response <br> Listing is still open <br><br>What is wrong with these people?</br></br></br></br></br>  Can we talk about old purchases here or do people mostly talk about new purchases/things they're waiting for?  <br>post about whatever the fuck you want as long as it's not porkchop</br>  <br>Cold feet</br>  <br>The people on that site are infinitely lazy, and hard to deal with.</br>  Holy fuck Ebay is going to make it hard to sell my collection. So many knockoffs being sold for 7 when my item is worth at least 100.  <br>Sell on MFC.</br>  <br>Craigslist? :^)</br>  Anyone know if these 2 are getting the 1/4 with their regular uniform, the angler suit, or both, or what? Can't really tell from the image.  <br>I really don't want to give them money just so I can list. Also having to deal with those people.</br>  <br>Cattleya, but only if you get this figure.</br>  <br>You can list for free. It's much cheaper than eBay, and things most certainly sell faster. The only thing you have to be wary of are the retards that inhabit the site.</br>  <br>Just be patient. As dumb as people who buy on ebay are, there are at least some that have a bit of sense when it comes to avoiding the chinese bootlegs. I've sold tons of figures on there no problem</br>  <br>Last time I listed it was only one item. I have over 170 I'm trying to sell.</br>  <br>Post what you want to sell in a Google sheet and link it here then. Include photos, figure, an imgur link, and price<br>Not that hard.</br></br>  just arrived  Welp prime day was a bust, how sad.  <br>Ah. Well, you can always make a post on their "sales forum" linking your eBay page.</br>  <br>You're trying to sell 170 figures?<br><br>Any of them have big titties?</br></br></br>  <br> http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/friedhuggababy</wbr>  A lot though some DFC to try to even it out.</br>  <br>Either  or just make a blog post about selling all your shit. It's technically against the rules but it should stay up for a couple hours at least before anyone bothers to delete it</br>  <br>oh I know you<br><br>I bought your Violet POP figure a month ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Ha, know anyone who wants my other one?</br>  <br>not unless you needed a 32 inch for $79. And that appleseed bluray.</br>  <br>how much for sepang and green miku?</br>  <br>I'll give you $40 shipped for this.</br>  <br>wow you were trying to sell both? I guess you're trying to ditch your entire collection?<br><br>Anyway I don't know anyone with taste superior enough to enjoy One Piece.</br></br></br>  <br>nobody wants your hotglued shit</br>  <br>The angle of this picture makes it look worse than it should.</br>  <br>I still can't believe you bought the bear, fried.</br>  <br><br><br>Any interested parties email me at <br> friedkun@gmail.com </br></br></br></br>  <br>How much for Muramasa? Fuuri?</br>  <br>Post your MFC page here and sell to us.<br>We can contact you via PM there.</br></br>  <br>I'm about that resale value.<br><br><br>Which Mura?<br><br><br>see<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone hotglued a skirt until it was filled up? This sounds like something I want to see just so I can see what it looks like  <br/>  <br>In that case I got the original release of www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOGDS-13<wbr>7766 a few months back and it's much smaller than I expected. Why do you all think of thw World Uniform Operation line of figures?</wbr></br>  <br>But the bear hasn't sold out on GSC's online shop. In fact, you can still put in a pre-order for it right now.<br><br> I pre-ordered it the day it went up ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>It's about that long game.</br>  <br>WUO is 1/10 scale. I would buy the Heartcatch girls and maybe Futari wa and Fresh if they weren't so small.</br>  Now you can buy Sader's retarded cousin, Daber!<br> http://r.ebay.com/Rry2JB </br>  <br>If that's the case, then I suppose we're in this together.</br>  <br> Saber and Archer <br> There's no Archer </br></br>  <br>Emailed you about <br>Please reply, anon.</br></br>  <br>What's the point of shitting on the characters name if you're still blatantly stealing the franchises copyrighted name and logo?</br>  <br>Because China</br>  <br>When I was a kid there was this imports shop selling batman bootleg toys. At first they were named batman. then some time later "batmen" and finally "batworld".</br>  <br>Yeah I neglected to look at the size so I was surprised to find out how small she was. Still a damn nice figure though.</br>  <br>I really wish there was more high quality figures for the earlier series. I have Eas and she's wonderful.</br>  <br>Holy shit that hotdog.<br>I hope she gets one with an icecream or hotdog between her tits.<br>Lewd dick-like object placement make the best figs.</br></br></br>  <br>same with craigslist most the time. This same dude has been posting the same ad for over a month and he never responds to anything.</br>  <br><br>Sometimes I think these people have a need for attention and list things they really don't want to sell, just to have people message them wanting this thing they have.</br></br>  <br>I wanted the Miki WUO figure but that one is an exclusive and I don't really trust proxy services that much. Are there any other Precure figures you'd recommend that are still easy to find? I only have 2 (well technically 3 but my Chibiarts Peach is missing pieces/went missing awhile back).</br>  <br>I'm holding off ordering anything until after wonfes.</br>  <br>Every time you post, I consider buying something but then I remember that you hotglued half of your stuff.</br>  <br>Source on him hotgluing his figs.</br>  <br>5 that's it.</br>  <br> being this new <br>check the archive</br></br>  <br>He's a guy</br>  <br>I actually wanted it for a second because it was amusing but 20 is still too much.</br>  <br> claim something <br> ask for source <br> tell them to go look for it <br><br>That's not how it works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd call 'em and see if it's still there. Otherwise hope that Japan Post notices and tosses it back on the plane.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br><br>Did he state that he hotglued his figs or did he post pictures of his figs with hotglue?</br></br>  <br>enjoy your cumstained shit dude, it's not really my problem</br>  <br> that mousepad <br>Pre orders WHEN?</br></br>  <br>These threads.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/userna<wbr>me/fried-kun/order/asc/</wbr></br>  <br>Hopefully amiami puts it up soon.</br>  fried kun has got to be one of the worst posters here. damn near every time he posts it's either about hotglue, scalping, or being rich.  <br>Thanks, so basically stay away from these figures.</br>  <br>His pitiful hotglue you mean<br><br>Honestly, those were the saddest loads I've seen blasted on PVC ever.</br></br></br>  <br>How do I get rich?<br>I have 12k just sitting in my bank.</br></br>  <br>He still hasn't fried that fig he said he was going to.</br>  <br>pls no.</br>  <br>Just stay away from all of them.

FREAKING GENIUS I KNOW</br>  <br>Me too, but most of them wear them over panties.</br>  <br> Were they from these threads? Or just /a/ in general? <br><br>A few were more sp than a, but a couple were buyfags. We saw a bunch of NFL games at a tripfag's ridiculously nice house.

It was okay.</br>  <br>most women are too lazy for that.</br>  <br> Also, girls don't fucking take her panties that low when pissing to start with <br>Wrong. <br><br>And taking the clips off is unpractical since they're in front and back. It's much easier to just put them underneath the underwear. Or more importantly, when you want to put your dick in you'll want to take off the underwear as easily as possible. Imagine flinging with the clips while you're in a hurry. <br>It's not practical.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  <br>Garters and garterbelts by default are not practical, why are you eve trying to make them? They were used in an era where elastic clothes were not a thing and thighs wouldn't cling to her thighs, nowadays they are impractical by definition.<br><br>If someone is going to wear them they should do it right, not some retarded way just to take a shit and piss easily.</br></br></br>  <br>exactly, I bet most of anons here never had a GF, or hired a hooker.</br>  <br><br>raises paw</br></br>  <br>I'm collecting all armor girls from that series. I have a huge boner for girls in armor.</br>  <br>Practical or not, garters over the panties is the correct way to wear them.</br>  <br>Most likely, but waiting to see if anything else worth getting goes up in GSC's shop before the 29th. Also waiting until after Wonfes to make any more orders.</br>  Soon?  <br>Except under the panties is the right way. <br>It's honestly not about bathroom usage. It's sexy lingerie, the point is too keep it on during sex, that's what it's made for.

Pochaco is meant to be hotglued.  <br>The armor you posted  has a lot of problems, specially in the crotch and tights area.

I hope she produces many children.  <br>That hotdog is my dick.</br>  <br>How the fuck is Slutterfly shitty?

I could read the manga fine, even laugh along to it, but when I watch the anime I cringe harder than I've ever cringed. Is this happening to anybody else? The anime's quality is fucking awesome, no doubt, but something in it is hitting some deep hatred I never knew I had. Pic related, my face when Miia said she came in the first episode.  <br><br>Find out where he lives and stalk him.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to bully him, but I certainly hope he can make it to a Con is the US.</br>  <br> Not wanting to bully him <br><br>Crabman is made to be bullied</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about that lol but if anyone does know a mailing address, they'd have my thanks.

More importantly, she does not have the capability to be anything other than herself.<br><br>All of which makes her absolutely awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I've been reading the manga, and Akira Kogami is completely different from how she is in the anime. It's enough that they should probably be considered seperate characters. <br><br>Manga Akira is still a selfish cynical failed child idol, but she's not nearly as exaggerated and caricaturized as anime Akira. Her segments aren't lucky channel, it's just sort of a spin off bonus they include in every manga volume where she has her own group of friends. She's actually a nice person in manga, and genuinely cares for her friends. I don't know what to feel when reading this after having watched the anime.</br></br>  <br>Konata is a perfect blend of semen demon and self-insert<br><br><br>Sorry, I'm horny and getting drunk<br>Dubs and I won't serve myself more sake</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the original OP that made this one.

Not likely. Though her screen time is highly limited which means her particular inevitable human failings are directly portrayed only briefly. Such as, a lack of sensitivity to group mood and ability to calibrate behavior correspondingly. For another, an inability to study with discipline and application. That both of these look like they are expressions of an underlying structural flaw in personality only adds to their foreboding implication for the success and well being of an adult Misano.</br>          <br> Misano <br><br>It's Misao, got it memorized?<br><br>And yes, everything you said it's true as well.

Thanks for doujins. I love you guys.  <br>Does the manga end where the anime does?</br>  <br>thank you anon</br>  <br>In my mind it does now.</br>  Today's the day.  <br>Anime-original ending inbound.</br>  <br><br>It's not her. Kei's hairstyle is common.</br></br>  <br>Either a rework so they can fit enough in to get to a good ending point (such as graduation), or it's a ploy so they can out twist mangafags. Change a major plot point half way through the run or something.</br>  <br> anime ends with a happy end <br> manga ends up going ultra despair no survivors route </br></br>  Reminder that all Gurashis are best Gurashis.  ITT: Cool anime/manga weapons.  <br>I mean anime</br>  One of the only good things to come out of Naruto.  <br>its a reference, get out of here, anon</br>  Lance of Longitude  The Scythe was cool  Can girls be NTR'd?  <br>Thank you based anon</br>  <br> I'm going to ignore the absolutely tremendous amount of cultural history that has lead to the word virgin being an insult. <br><br>I mean literally everything in this thread is so armchair that it's not even worth addressing. I especially liked the guy asking for someone to link their peer reviewed journals and studies and getting nothing. Because you know, they don't exist.</br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br>Keep playing the academic as means of rejecting common sense for anyone who has dated women. Not /a/'s fault women act like women.</br></br></br>  <br>I am not a virgin but what use is stating that to a woman over the internet? The only reply you can expect is "lol u lyin u litle dik virgin :)" or some similarly inane stupidity.<br><br><br>Have you ever talked to women? Known women? They love "playboys" and disdain virgins almost unanimously. Men obviously feel differently.</br></br></br></br>  </blockquote>]
