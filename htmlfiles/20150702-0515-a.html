[ Why don't they just kill him?  Because he, along with Mary are the best character.<br><br>They should have killed off Shun.</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Our punishment must be more severe.</br>  Returns as Kekkai Sensen Back 2 Back in just over two more weeks in the new Jump Crown SQ magazine. D.Gray-man's back too.  I on-holded Trigun manga because art was too confusing, which translation is better - Max7 or Dark Horse?  <br>Wait, the Kekkai Sensen manga is over?</br>   Kekkai Sensen Maximum <br><br>May it run for another 14 volumes.</br></br>  <br>Are there even scans of the Dark Horse release?<br><br>I'm certain it would be better than what we have at the moment.</br></br></br>  <br> D.Gray-man's back too. <br><br>Hoshino is a talented artist, she should move on to something new and let DGM forever rest as her shameful mistake.</br></br></br>  <br>There are. Scans quality is very good, but my  acquaintance  who knows moon said that official translation is horrible and very confusing. I've tried reading raws and comparing them to Max7 and it seemed there are some translation mistakes too(but I think overall it's more literal translation than DH).<br>I'd like to hear someone else's opinion on this, or at least which translation anons read.</br></br>  <br> Back 2 Back <br><br> BBBB2B <br><br>Perfect</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's over the way Trigun was over when the magazine it was in folded. It started again as Trigun Maximum and picked up right where the story left off before.<br><br>It's a bit ironic that the exact same thing happened to both Nightow's manga.</br></br></br>  They're launching a new magazine? I wonder how long this one will last.  <br>Shit hits the fan in the second part again?</br>  <br> BBBB2B <br><br>Nice indeed.</br></br></br>  http://info.nicovideo.jp/seiga/kekk<wbr>aisensen_mad/<br><br>Winners of the Niconico AMV contest were announced and can be viewed on that page.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Wait and see, but given the direction the most recent volume took it seems likely.</br>  Araki is a genius. What are your thoughts on the new Jojo chapter?  <br>You just realized all this now?</br>  I wouldn't call him a genius but I'd say he's super creative and I really enjoy jojo because of that creativity.  <br>Yeah, he's not a genius by any means. He's not even that good of a writer. He really is super creative though.</br>  So anyone about this Jojo chapter, I really liked it because we know Gappy's  other half's real name,  finally  <br>It doesn't look like he has Josefumi's weird eyes, though.</br>  <br>Didn't he have both Kira's and Josefumi's eyes? I remember seeing a few panels of close-ups to his face, but perhaps that was just artistic? One of them that I remember was Karera looking close to him and realizing that he wasn't Josefumi. <br><br>Also, I remember it showing Kira's body without pupil's, but that could have been an edit I saw on here.</br></br></br>  <br>I just like how he alludes to past characters and stories in this new universe,</br>  <br>Gappy has 2 different eyes, but neither looks like Josefumis eyes</br>  <br>yeah it's kind of cool. In steel ball run the avdol one was pretty pathetic though <br><br><br>Hmm I'd have to look at the panels again. Why would Gappy have 2 different eyes and one of them not be the type that Josefumi had? Unless if Kira's and Josefumi's eyes mixed a little but not all the way.</br></br></br></br>  These subbers really annoy me with randomly putting words in quotes.  <br>Probably because Araki changed his mind about how Josefumi looks like</br>  <br>You mean translaters? But anon, that's how it is in the original text. It isn't random. Blame Araki</br>  <br>Hmm well let's see if newer panels have closeups of Gappy with his special eyes</br>  <br>Seen it in other manga, too. Toriko in particular. It's been really bad about that.</br>  <br>I think its fairly obvious they're translating the (can't think of a better word) expression from the raws, its not jusf some bullshit they're making up for funsies</br>  <br>Do you mean those "stand quote" things?</br>  <br>I think you're「Exaggerating」</br>  <br>He has his star birthmark though, which you can see kira doesn't have</br>  <br>Kira does have the birthmark. Don't you remember?</br>  <br>Yeah, but im trying to think of a word to describe/classify those things, i know the word exists just can't recall it</br>  <br>He doeen't have it here though</br>  <br>brackets?</br>  <br>Japanese quotes?</br>  <br>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japan<wbr>ese/Vocabulary/Punctuation</wbr></br>  <br> not even that good of a writer <br>Steel Ball Run</br></br>  <br>Probably just covered by the clothing. You can't see Josuke's one in every panel either.</br>  <br><br><br>call them stand brackets or just brackets. Corners would make more sense but sounds stupid<br><br> Japanese brackets <br> jabrackets <br>huh?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh so thats what they actually are</br></br>  <br>Shitty hair, and what is even going on with that shirt.</br>  <br>Damn you got me there</br>  Joubin's stand will wreck shit up    <br>You're right, but Karera kind of confirmed it. I'd bank on the other half being Josefumi. But even if the center isn't clear like Josefumi's one half is much lighter than the other.<br><br>The maid didn't know Josefumi, and he doesn't have the higashikata surname so his origins are the real confusing thing. Still don't really know anything about him.<br><br><br>He'll be the Wham, Karera will be the AC/DC, and Yotsuyu will be the Cars of the rockmen.  then Kira the other Kira/ Josefumi will come back as a rockman with killer queen like how Diego came back with the world </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gay anime.</br>  When did math become so relevant  <br> He'll be the Wham, Karera will be the AC/DC, and Yotsuyu will be the Cars of the rockmen. then Kira the other Kira/ Josefumi will come back as a rockman with killer queen like how Diego came back with the world <br><br>None of what you're saying here makes any sense at all to me. Yotsuyu referenced Santana, Jobin referenced ACDC, Aishou referenced Wham, and Karera's name and design are references to Cars.<br>Also Josefumi and Kira are dead and other result of their fusion was a corpse that has been cremated.</br></br></br></br>  Why does Josefumi have the birthmark?  <br>Kira was cremated?</br>  <br>The corpse made of the parts of Kira and Josefumi that aren't now in Josuke, yes.</br>  <br>I don't remember that part so I assumed he was playing dead like a rockman.<br><br> the rest of what i said, i was just pretending to be retarded. </br></br></br>  <br>Are you reading Duwang on your first time through? Part 4's all redone. Not sure what you mean regardless, even Duwang is making it clear that Kira's doing calculations to hit Josuke.</br>  What happens if Araki explains the ghostly Josuke in part 8?  <br>English isn't your first language is it? That question is rhetorical. Its meant to be a joke on the fact that Geometry isn't super useful for most jobs.</br>  <br>I'm watching Dio's World while reading this thread, and the differences between Kira and Araki's other villains seem immense right now. He isn't really threatening because of inhuman powerlevel shit (as opposed to Dio, or Kars, or Pucci at the end), and even his huge powerup is really limited (as opposed to Valentine and Pucci).<br><br>The only thing that makes him scary is that he's clever. This and his goals make him the most human villain, despite him being a serial killer. I find pretty much all of part 4's characters to be far more relatable than those from the other parts.</br></br></br>  Whats the best Duwang? I like this one the best.  <br>This one</br>  <br>Reminder that Karera said he wasn't Josefumi, got spooked and tried to flee.<br><br>If he didn't use his stand to learn and call out her name she would of never continued their discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, It could be a red herring. Araki would do it.</br>  Does /a/ like Shigechi? He was a fat greedy fuck but he wasn't evil and I was sad when he died. In the end he was just trying to protect his family and friends he didn't deserve to get blown the fuck up  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>It's too accurate to be pure duwang, really.</br>  <br>Kira would have had his quiet life if not for this fat ass</br>  <br>If Kira really wanted a quiet life he wouldn't have gone around cutting peoples arms off</br>  Is Mista's gun part of his stand or does he just use a real gun?  <br>I believe it was a real gun, which makes me wonder what Sex Pistol's ability really was.</br>  <br>Sex Pistols is just another Harvest</br>   post yfw Araki introduces Stands based on the OST of the 2012-2015 anime in the next part.   <br>It's a real gun, he stole the six-shooter off a thug in his flashback, I think.<br><br>Sex Pistols is just a bunch of little fuckers who are really good at kicking bullets.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not like Emperor, the gun and the bullets are completely normal.</br>  Just read part 6.<br>What the fuck did I just read.</br>  <br>Evangelion version Araki</br>  <br>Make everybody happy</br>  <br> What the fuck did I just read. <br>No idea Mon, no idea, Part 6 can catch you off guard like that, s'like a spiked drink, your good for about five hours the OHBOYHERECOMESTHEABSINTHE! and you don't know where you are, what time it is, and why you feel like you've thrown up your legs and your arms have flown away.</br></br>  <br>[Cruel Angels Thesis] and [Tumbling Down]?</br>  I know this gets asked in every thread but any news on Part 4 anime?<br><br>Also I'm rereading it at the moment, has jojolion caught up with it or something because the translations and quality seem to be 10x better than when I read them before.</br></br>  <br>「S A C H I E L」</br>  <br>He's never properly seen the anime so that's unlikely.</br>  <br/>  <br>「S H A M S H E L」<br><br>Well Shit.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair that was in the nineties and since then he has named a few characters and stands after Japanese music and drawn three album covers for Japanese musicians.</br>  <br>Well I had ideas for 「Stand Proud」and「Bloody Stream」but that was about it.</br>  <br>What is your standard of genius?<br>Cause i failed to see how anyone could match the level of his art &amp; character design and combat variety</br></br>  <br>He produces the best fights in any manga, without question. His art and character design is also very cool.<br><br>He falls down with his story and plotholes but the other aspects of his work are so good that people overlook it. But seriously it took almost 2 decades for Araki to learn how to write a really good story.</br></br></br>  <br> Brian Blessed is the next JoJo <br><br>plz</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Brian Blessed is the next JoJo <br>well you got the wrong idea completely.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I got the idea. It's dumb and bad, sorry. There doesn't need to be a stand called Bloody Stream or Sono Chi No Sadame. I just want Brian Blessed to be the next JoJo.</br>  <br>i think genius doesn't equal to being good at every field, but out of ordinary in one particular<br>Michael Jordon is shit at baseball doesnt mean he isnt a basketball genius</br></br>  <br> I just want Brian Blessed to be the next JoJo. <br>PERFECT! HOW DO WE FIT THE JJO PART IN THOUGH!?</br></br>  <br>Beats me.</br>  <br>I'm confused about the protag's joestar. Does both kira and josuke's counterpart have them? or only kira?</br>  <br>To that end, I think he is a genius fight director and artist but not a genius manga author because of his lack in story telling in place, but even that is getting much much better.<br><br>I would say a genius manga author in terms of someone who is complete and excels in all fields would be someone like Katsuhiro Otomo or Kentaro Muira for example.</br></br></br>    <br>Kira should have it. Maybe Josefumi is a bastard.</br>  <br>Josefumi had one, Kira had one (<br>), and now Josuke has one.<br><br>Nothing has been said about it yet but I think it's pretty safe to assume Josefumi was Kira's uncle like the previous shithair was to Jotaro.</br></br></br></br>  What are your anticipations for Part 4's anime if it ever gets animated?  <br>Nothing to CHI-MIMIN~ about.</br>  <br> Tell him yourself </br>  What's up with the way Araki's art-style changed over the course of the first few parts?<br><br>Phantom Blood had Jonathan as a ripped mofo in his 20th year of life.<br>Battle Tendency has Joseph who's slightly less ripped but you've got the pillar men to supplement that and he was 18 at the time.<br>Stardust Crusaders has Jotaro who's got a good build but is nowhere near that /fit/ level as previous ones and he's 17.<br>Diamond is Unbreakable has Josuke who's now more or less a regular student in build, even his height regresses and he's 16 at the time.<br>Then comes Vento Aureo and Giovanno along with the whole group already fit into that style the name of which I forgot which makes all the men look like women. He's also 15 and has a female surname.<br>Finally, the whole thing concludes with Stone Ocean and Jolyne who's a woman, though at least the age regression stopped and both her and all JoJos to come after her are 19.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Josuke is really pulling from all sources.</br>  <br>I'm really interested to see how they're going to handle Enigma's attacks visually.<br><br>Though the real challenge will come afterwards with Buccellati's stand ability and the way it bends the picture.<br>Now that's something to be scared of as an animator.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jonathan was a ripped mofo in his early tweens.</br>  <br>You have as bad a understanding of heights as the japs. Jotaro is 195cm, that is not a good build that is fucking massive. And Josuke is shorter than the first three but he is 187cm at the age of 17 which for a Jap is gigantic and for almost all of the world taller than average. <br><br>But to answer your question, Fist of the North Star was no longer the number 1 manga in Japan so the protagonists didn't need to be overly muscled manly men all the time. Araki's taste in fashion magazines probably changed as well since all of his designs are from there.</br></br></br>  <br> makes jojo thread <br> no pastebin <br><br>I got you bruv<br><br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your general shit.</br>  <br> Araki <br> Listening to Japanese shit </br></br>  <br>I thought he did though, I mean he did name 2 characters in SBR after Soul'd Out songs. And he has done album covers for 3 separate artists.</br>  <br><br/></br>   Playing HFTF <br> Some guy is being a real dickhead, swearing and telling people to "1v1 me u cheeky cunt" <br> Completely wreck some dude's shit in <br> 5 uninterrupted wins <br> "get rekt you turkish faggot" he says afterwards, even though he got steamrolled <br> instantly quits <br>thepleasureofbeingkebab'dinside.png<wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was /a/'s reaction to<br><br>1.

Hell he needed to crap out new powers just so he wouldn't get wrecked by a returning Jojo and then again because of a ten year old.</br>  <br>I'm female?</br>  <br>We're Dead?</br>  <br>I'm cool?</br>  <br>Probably<br><br>Unfortunately not.  But Pol would still be way more moe </br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a creative genius. Just compare his output to most other mangakas, he is a special existence.</br></br>  <br>I'm pissed?</br>  <br>Still the worst Jojo.</br>  I just read my 4000nd manga volume and i wanted to tell someone.  <br>No disagreement there.</br>  <br>lolnope</br>    <br>Nah he at least had some good interaction with his crew and an objective in his life that wasn't just reactionary. And even with the poor translation he had something resembling a personality.</br>  <br>Diavolo didn't deserve it.</br>  <br>Why is genderbent Giorno so much better?</br>  Favorite fights of each part?<br>For me it's<br> Dio in the Joestar mansion <br> Chariot race with Wham <br> Vanilla Ice <br> Highway Star <br> White Album <br> Bohemian Rhapsody <br> Mandom <br> Beetlemania </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it fits</br>  Where in the Word is Gay Priest?  <br>No matter how ham handed his mystery was done Diavolo was my favorite Jojo villain.</br>  <br>Changing his ways by stop being a shitty meme</br>  <br>I don't think he's as interesting as the other villians but he was entertaining and he's my ASB main. Kinda wish Araki did a bit better with him. King Crimson was great stand for him.</br>  Does/did the Jojo anime have any notable key animators working on it or are most of them newcomers. Aside from composers, no one actually talks about the Jojo staff very much in comparison to other anime.  How did you first hear about Jojo? When did you start? Did you watch or read? What did you assume about Jojo just by looking at it? I thought that Jotaro was a 50's greaser character when I first saw him.  <br>For me it was how he felt in the story. Its hard for me to describe he felt like a train, like he really was the secret emperor he hyped himself up as. DIO in part three didn't come close to capturing that feel of and now everything has gone to shit.</br>  <br>Gay Priest isn't a meme.</br>  <br>I'll give you that. Diavolo's reveal and how much a threat he was felt better than how DIO ended up being. Although GER is still an asspul it's an asspul that made since to beat someone as powerful as Diavolo while DIO felt weak to be defeated a by a punch to the leg no matter how you try to wrap logic around it.</br>  <br>I know its really disappointing that Dio had more of that feel in part 1.</br>  <br>The thing is DIO was built up over the entire manha after we already saw him in part 1, so DIO must be something better now. When he first encounters Polneraff up until his fight with Jotaro it felt the same way, he was threatening and felt stronger than anyone else. But as soon as he met jotaro and Jotaro said one of his shitty one liners DIO lost all of that. It would have been so much better if it was a team effort and too smarts to bring down DIO, I don't even mind Jotaro stopping time but that leg punch still pissed me off.</br>  <br>The only reason the leg punch should piss you off is if you missed the foreshadowing. <br><br>DIO's thing has always that he's actually a big bitch.</br></br></br>  Why has Araki's art gone to shit????  <br>Nah even with the foreshadowing that DIO lacked confidence in his abilities and what not he still lacked the 'feel' of a proper archvillain by the end of it he might as well been just another one of the quirky assassin minibosses. And that is disappointing even if foreshadowed.</br>  <br>He's not really that clever. He starts freaking out when things are not going according to plan and is pretty bad at improvising.</br>  <br>it's amazing, the thread went to shit, right after your post. You can really tell the difference.</br>  <br>The thing about Gay Priest is that as long as there is an anon out there who thinks Gay Priest is but a meme, Gay Priest must bless him to change his ways.<br><br>Gay Priest will be coming to change YOUR ways.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not really how it is. <br><br>He's over-confident in his abilities at all times, that's why he panics when he loses his invincibility in the Time Stop. Once Jotaro gets on an even footing he loses his confidence a bit because his The World is slower and weaker than Star Platinum, but once he gets a slight advantage he's back to thinking he's hot shit.<br><br>The foreshadowing I mentioned was specifically regarding his left side being is bum side.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It just how lame it was. With how DIO hyped up and died from his leg blowing up and then Jotaro makes another shitty one liner. I didn't like Jotaro after the first few chapters already and all that together made me really dislike how things ended.</br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br>I wonder what the anon that first posted Gay Priest Pucci_after.png thinks about his creation?</br>  <br><br> Foreshdowing <br>Left side was weaker. Not that the world is apparently brittle. It would have made sense if his leg had simply been torn in half much like the end of part 7.</br></br></br>  Something just occured to me. How is it physically possible that Jotaro stopped time for as long as he did? In Part 4, Jotaro's time stop limit is said to be 2 seconds. In the climax of the Road Rollar moment, Jotaro stops time at DIO's 9 second mark, and continues to stop it for at least 3 more seconds, because he makes mention the 11 second mark has passed, but he still keeps talking, and time is still frozen. If Jotaro can only stop time for 2 seconds, his human body not able to hold the strain long, how could he stop time for at least 3 seconds in that moment? Because if it was just 2 seconds, as soon as that 11 second mark hit, DIO should have been free, and time continued.  <br><br><br><br>Jap writing process is completely alien to the West. This is why archetypes in the East permeate the industry so heavily.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง</br>  <br>no but really, if the dog didnt steal shigechi's sandwich they would have no reason to chase kira and would be none the wiser</br>  <br>Nah, the World is just as strong and fast as Star Platinum, just less durable which doesn't really matter when the user is a vampire.  Which is interesting because while the World had a durability of A, a fully mastered Star Platinum with the full five second time stop in small intervals has a durability of E. </br>  <br>He stopped it for 5. He also does this in part 6.</br>  <br>I hope he feels really bad about himself</br>  <br>There's only reason. One simple reason, DIO pissed him off</br>  <br> Posting Jotaro <br>Bring it, dolphin fucker.</br></br>  <br>He said it had been ten years since he last stopped time at the start of part 4, so I just assumed he was out of practice.</br>  <br>He did everything he could to stall out and run he only fought when he had no other option left to him, and because he did that he lost any advantage he had when they attacked the manor. Its why he kept making a huge deal about being incomplete to Ice and Horse and why he feared the Jostars. Now you can have the archenemy be uncertain but DIO couldn't face that shit even to himself.<br><br><br>That and this guy right DIO dying of an exploding shin was pretty lame and so was getting punked by Jotaro with a shitty oneliner in tow.</br></br></br></br>  someone post that fake part 4 screencaps  <br>I think I came close to death.</br>  <br>It was torn off completely during the fight (which is stated to take place over the course of around 3 minutes from Kakyoin dying to DIO's death). Star Platinum breaks his legs moments before the final clash. Turns out absorbing Joseph didn't make him perfect. <br><br>Jotaro hit him so hard on his specific and damaged weakpoint that even his own stand cracked. That was enough to destroy DIO's stand. Simple as that. <br><br><br>Durability isn't a very good translation. It's better translated as "Staying Power" and refers to how far the stand can have its effects show from a distance. <br><br>The World is demonstrably slower and weaker than SP. It loses in rushes after DIO goes high and has its hand blown away by a punch.<br><br><br>DIO lost his advantage when Jotaro learned to move in stopped time but only then. If it wasn't a shonen and bound by story telling devices to deliver a story, he would have wiped them all out with ease as soon as they went in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  how far the stand can have its effects show from a distance.  <br>That's range. A completely different stat.</br></br>  <br> staying power <br>Which makes even less sense with Star Platinum: the World as that would have meant the time stop wouldn't have affected the time acceleration and King Crimson since the time deletion wouldn't have affected all of space.<br><br><br>Range is how far the Stand can be from its user.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Joseph didn't make him perfect <br>I could probably accept it better if this was right. In part 1 DIO got cut in half from what I remember was a sword ( imbued with weakened Hamon?) And still put his body back together. When his leg flies and has trouble putting it back together I'm fine cause he's still not completely in control. But after he get's his high and looses the rush his hand heals immediately, yet when his leg get's punched it stays that way even though he can heal faster.</br></br>  <br> DIO lost his advantage when Jotaro learned to move in stopped time but only then.  <br>That was when DIO lost his final advantage, Ice was an advantage so were all the other assassins and stand users he squandered.<br> If it wasn't a shonen and bound by story telling devices to deliver a story, he would have wiped them all out with ease as soon as they went in. <br>If it weren't a shonen Joseph would just have had Avodul burn down the mansion after they found it from the outside.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Jotaro hit him so hard on his specific and damaged weakpoint that even his own stand cracked. That was enough to destroy DIO's stand. Simple as that. <br>It'd be fine if Jotaro had said something like "even Diamond is breakable if you hit the same spot enough times"<br><br>How long the Stand hangs around=/=how far the Stand goes. Notice how punch types appear for a bit and go away? The World and Whitesnake keep their form longer, or that's how it should be.</br></br></br></br>  <br> How long the Stand hangs around=/=how far the Stand goes <br>Then you(or he) should have said<br> how long a stand can manifest a physical appearance </br></br></br>  <br>I was trying to simplify it a bit. But yeah.<br><br>The fuck are you talking about? If he goes into Timestop modo, he obeys the same rules as The World. He probably tires himself at superspeed or something.</br></br></br>  <br>I kind of stopped thinking too hard about Dio's vampire powers after Part 1 since they're so inconsistent.<br><br><br>Oh man, I can't imagine how things will go down if Avdol burns down the mansion from the start. Dio and his minions will escape somehow since fire takes time to burn down things and Avdol's range isn't that good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I kind of stopped thinking too hard about Dio's vampire powers after Part 1 since they're so inconsistent. <br>I missed DIO's ice mode. Imagine DIO somehow being able to use it through The World and freezing shit he punched.</br></br>  <br>This staying power thing makes even less sense because if we go by  Stands like King Crimson shouldn't stay around for long but that scene with Bruno shouldn't have lasted so long then.</br>  <br>Yes but Tech would be shit if he cant force a one on one fight with hostages and Ice although hideously dangerous wouldn't be able to get the drop on anyone. The other guy would probably just burn to death, DIO would be sealed in the ruins because daylight and even if he did try to hide PH would find him.  Although Joseph used his power in about the worst way possible for SDC </br>  <br>You pissed me off</br>  <br>Yeah, Part 3 really is overrated.</br>  <br> how long a stand can manifest a physical appearance <br>That's not what it means either really though. Basically, stand stats are really fucking dumb, pointless, they're post script for parts 3 and 4 to add to the irrelevance and that one is the worst of them all. Just ignore them.</br></br>  <br>Do you think things would have went differently if DIO kept Pucci around the mansion too? Whitesnake could do stealth, make illusions, Jizz, disguise himself as DIO, or any of crusaders for any reason, and he could stick his hand into someone and order them around, all while Pucci could be pretending to a innocent fuckboy somewhere else.

There was stuff like Surface, Rohan licking a spider all censored, that kind of shit.</br>  <br>But because Pucci was DIO's friend and not a servant he could tell DIO to shut up and let him stay. That also might have made DIO take things a bit more seriously and to get off his ass until he had to..</br>  <br>All Whitesnake needs to do is smack discs out of people and they go down. He probably could have beaten the SC crew if he pulled the shit he did with Manhattan Transfer where someone else distracted them and he came up and swiped discs. Jotaro couldn't stop time then, either.</br>  <br>By how you said it, it sounds like Dio considered Pucci to be more of a tool than a true friend. Friends are there for each other and are willing to die for each other. Just look at Josuke and Okuyasu.</br>  <br>It's been a while but, why didn't didn't take the discs from Jolyne and Jotaro when they had jizz all over them again?

Basically she knows she's a shit person and gives her up.</br>  Evil again<br><br> BTW: This was the correct spoiler. <br><br> Naruto wins the day by glaring at the Shins and then gives them a bit of TNJ telling them he will fix their bad manners, and they all returned to Konoha to live happily forever. Possibly. </br></br></br></br>  I kinda wish salad is Sakura's biological daughter<br>I just feel that it would be more fitting than having some asspull .<br>Either way I applaud kishi for this rollercoaster<br>Also kinda makes me wish he wrote a bit more naruto <br>Just a bit</br></br></br></br>  <br>And they all take turns cucking Sakura?<br>Yeah, I wish.</br></br>  <br>At this point in time Sakura as the mother makes abosultely no sense, since Kishimoto has done nothing to implicate that Sakura is the mother but everything to show that Karin is.<br><br>Even if the DNA test is wrong, you still have the point that Karin has Sarada's umbilical cord which in Japanese culture is something that is given to the MOTHER of the child. In addition it's also customary for the wife to take care of whatever bastard children her husband fathers, especially if the mother is unable to.<br><br>Plus logic also works against Sakura, since if Sakura was pregnant for 9 months then Naruto would have seen her pregnant, and she would have had in the Konoha where there would be superior medics readily available. Even if you want to say that she had problems giving birth and Karin was the surrogate then Karin probably would have stayed in Leaf, and besides she isn't a better medic than Tsunade and Shizune, both of whom are in Leaf. So it's highly likely that Sakura isn't the mother but Kishimoto will have Sarada say that it doesn't matter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>she's just straight up messing around now.</br></br>  <br>Why would you wish that on Salad anon, do you hate her or something.</br>  <br><br> mum <br><br>stop that. speak american</br></br></br></br>    <br>Because she'll have a reason to be shit<br>When ever a potential best girl is turning shit we can lead all roads to pinkshit<br><br>What can we say if she becomes worst girl over time(if kishi continues in the future) .

Saying "he won't do it because the magazine would stop him" as  said is simply incorrect.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Lets be real here, if Sakura isn't the mother its going to be because she's sterile.

There was a very simple and fairly standard formula here; Naruto was always meant to be with Hinata, Sakura and Sasuke were destined to be, Karin's the objectively better girl that never had a chance because she wasn't there first and didn't appeal to plebs. It was expected for anyone who wasn't a delusional tumblr fangirl.<br><br>I'm leaving a window of optimism open here, but if Karin got pierced by Sasuke once again, except this time in a way that didn't leave her bleeding to death, at least not out of her chest , it will all feel very surreal, more so because it's Masashi Kishimoto</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ will once again be proven right when it's revealed that popping the byakugou healing thing fries ovaries.<br>salad will be perma only kid short of more egg donations.</br></br>  <br> /a/ will once again be proven right <br> again </br></br>  <br>lel, I've been repping Hinata best girl since the Chunin Exams but please do keep your delusion.<br><br>That's the only thing that makes sense considering the aesop of this story is about children as an extension of the parents. <br><br>I expect Kaguya to come back from the dead and turn into Goku before I expect some of the asinine theories that have come up recently on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, NH ending was called ages in advance as well as burrito being special snowflake half moon nigger, and cuckera theory was instant upon release of 700.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Can you guys stop with the cuckura?

If it happens, it'll be because Sakura can't have her own kids. <br>No, you are only saying that because you are assuming Sasuke and Sakura are fucking. Just say it, don't hide behind code.<br>So far we see zero signs that Sasuke is sexually attracted to any woman, Sakura included. And his reluctance to visit his legally married wife doesn't improve the chances. SS shippers might equate marriage with sex, but we both know that isn't true; people don't get married to have sex, they get married to raise children. If Salad needs a home, then she needs a family. Marriage provides that, and also official legitimacy. But saying Sakura is sterile require that you assume they ever tried for a baby... And so far that doesn't look like it.<br><br><br> I'm leaving a window of optimism open here, but if Karin got pierced by Sasuke once again, except this time in a way that didn't leave her bleeding to death, at least not out of her chest , it will all feel very surreal, more so because it's Masashi Kishimoto <br>We see in the start of this entire arc that babies can be made more than one way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We have no reason to believe Karin would want a kid. <br><br>If Evil wasn't just joking, Sarada's glasses are a gift from Karin.</br></br></br>  <br>My single point here is this. If Sasuke didn't give any shits, then why wouldn't Salad stay with Karin? There's clearly a reason she's with Sakura, which is part of the Aesop.</br>  I don't think this was brought up in the other thread, but when Evil posted that both Karin and Sakura were there when Salad was born he also linked the song "How You Like Me Now" if anyone wants to dissect the lyrics<br><br>Now there was a time,<br>When you loved me so.<br>I couldn't do wrong,<br>And now you need to know.<br><br>If I was to cheat<br>Oh no, would you see right through me?<br>If I sing a sad sad sad sad song<br>Would you give it to me?<br>Would you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cuckera is the tobi = obito of the gaiden, sorry.</br>  <br>*she</br>  <br><br>That's fine but can you just stop until it's confirmed?

Just because he had more more important things to worry about in the past than having sex doesn't mean he's completely asexual now.<br><br> We see in the start of this entire arc that babies can be made more than one way. <br><br>It took up to 6 chapters for Sarada to deal with the idea that she isn't even her own mother's biological child.

Just because he had more more important things to worry about in the past than having sex doesn't mean he's completely asexual now. <br>Sasuke ALWAYS have "more important things to worry about". Even right now in the gaiden. This is enough reason to keep him asexual until proven otherwise. A sexual man does not ignore his legally married wife for 12 years by choice.

Death by Snu Snu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>girl sauce is pretty cute</br></br>  <br>I think you meany it another way.</br>  <br><br>I think he was making a joke</br></br>  <br> can't raise her daughter because she'd be thrown in jail the moment she even came to see her daughter <br> Probably not really allowed anywhere not owned by orochimaru since orochimaru is the only one who can get away with everything. <br> yfw Karin is the only one who actually suffered from the "ex terrorists" thing </br></br></br>  <br>Damn, Karin looks good in that screen.</br>   go to NF to look for Evil spoilers <br> they have to actively make sure people don't kill themselves  <br> apparently this has happened multiple times <br> one guy actually succeeded in his suicide after Itachi died <br><br>Jesus</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel like Karin would be the one suffering here more than Sakura.<br><br><br><br> one guy actually succeeded in his suicide after Itachi died <br><br>You mean that Russian kid? Did he post there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how many people are going to kill themselves when OP ending turn out to be disappointing</br>  <br>Naruto is serious business anon</br>  <br>Yeah, I mean yeah sakura pretty much won at everything but sex or any kind of physical emotion.</br>  <br><br>I saw a couple registered users in that thread saying they have nothing left in their lives if SS is ruined.</br></br>  I kinda want Karin to be the mother, if only because then she might show up in the movie, and maybe even tutor Salad in a Jiraiya-like position.<br><br>And also because SS will be super mad, which would be hilarious.</br></br>  I think the best part of it all is, that even if Sakura "wins" there's no getting around that Sasuke's most likely never kissed her and also abandoned her and Salad for 12 years without ever bothering to get in contact, despite having the means to do so.<br><br>And he'll also leave again at the end of Gaiden with some vague promise to keep Sakura happily raising his spawn.</br></br>  <br>guys come on. sakura is the mom. it's the "she gives karin the umbilical cord" misunderstanding ending. stop thinking the shitposts of an attention means anything.</br>  <br><br> Karin gives up her kid <br> Before Sakura and Sasuke leave, the last thing she gives them is a pair of glasses cause bad eyesight runs in her family. <br><br>The taste of the cuckening would be pretty bittersweet if things went down like this if you ask me.<br><br><br><br>SO THERE I WAS, BEING SASUKE UCHIHA...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Japanese society it's the mother that keeps the umbilical cord, because of the belief that it's tied to their child's health. It's not something that you would give to a stranger.</br>  The tumblr fandom's in full panic mode, I love it.<br><br>Whichever way they spin it, either genetics are what's supposed to matter so Sakura is the irrelevant parent, or love is what's supposed to matter, so Sasuke is the irrelevant parent. <br><br>SasuSaku sure is dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering the movie, it's pretty much confirmed that Sarada picks Sakura as her parent, because Sakura raised her.</br>  <br><br>Karin being Sasuke's baby mamma is just the icing on the cake.<br><br>Someone in that NF thread said Rai should be posting spoilers in about 5 hours, give or take. I'm wondering if I should take a power nap until then.<br><br>Unless there's something that can only be made out if you read Japanese, we may have the final word in just a little bit.<br><br><br><br>The way Evil was trying to spin it, Karin almost sounds like a better mom than Sasuke is a dad. Assuming that attention whore was telling the troof.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Karin and Sasuke are still fuck buddies?</br>  <br>She's actually only lied once, but in the amount of time she's been giving out spoilers she's been been telling the truth, it's just that a lot of people don't believe her.</br>  <br> Assuming that attention whore was telling the troof. <br>Evil never lies. She only took back one truth she said about the DNA test (she gave the truth first and then went to say that the test didn't happen), because SS were calling her a liar and a troll for the DNA test spoiler. <br><br>Evil went out her way to troll them only then. It was the only time she ever trolled.</br></br></br></br>  So did evil say its karins full kid? hy would karin have a kid instead of sakura,?  <br>Is she cute?</br>  <br>She did she had a "clue" that said "Karin is mom", but then like the time with the DNA test, people started to call her a liar.</br>  Now it's pretty clear that Sarada is Karin's daughter, still I can't believe Sauce simply banged her.  Way to go op<br><br>Thread is dead as fuck due to off topic text</br></br>  Not a shipper, but sakura is obviously the mom.<br>You should look at it from the parents perspective : Sasuke is known from wanting to destroy the village and kill eveyone, only close relatives know that sasuke is married to sakura. Kids at school knowing sarada's dad is a serial killer god will make them ostracize her so they decided to hide the truth until their generation is old enough to not loose their shit.<br>Has litterally anyone of you wondered why sasuke married sakura if she's not even the mom of his kid ? Well, there's not any reason to do that.</br></br>  <br> denial </br>  <br> projecting </br>   all those mental gymnastics <br><br>No you def are a ssfag</br></br>  <br><br>Meant for<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Except Sasuke isn't a wanted criminal, and the Uchiha aren't looked down upon since we know for a fact that Sakura uses Sasuke's last name, his clan symbol, and it's common knowledge that she's married to him. Sarada is using his name and isn't being ostracized at all. So what you're saying makes no sense.<br><br>Also in Japanese society if a man's mistress has a child it isn't uncommon for the man to give the child to his wife for her to raise.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, maybe I haven't paid that much attention to the details.<br><br> Also in Japanese society if a man's mistress has a child it isn't uncommon for the man to give the child to his wife for her to raise. <br><br>Sauce on that ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sasuke is known from wanting to destroy the village and kill eveyone, only close relatives know that sasuke is married to sakura. <br>Well Sasuke is the last living Uchiha and Salad+Pink walk around with the fucking Uchiha symbol on their clothing and live in a large building with the fucking symbol emblazoned on the front. Process of elimination.</br></br>  <br>*was</br>  <br>It was a part of the plot for Summer Wars.</br>  <br> deflecting </br>  <br>It honestly seems like Sasuke married Sakura just so she could legally look after Salad and she wouldn't lose face for apparently having a criminal's child out of wedlock. Them calling eachother Husband and Wife sounds very forced (for instance Naruto/Hinata still refer to eachother by their first names) and Sasuke seems like he's only doing it because Salad and co are present.<br><br>They didn't even have wedding photos or any memorabilia, and Sakura had to stick her photo over Karin's. <br>They honestly just seem like they're lying about their marriage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Besides that it makes no sense for Sarada to be born outside of the village if she really is Sakura's child. Sakura is a medic, aka, not the type of unit that is put on long term missions, and Konoha has the best medics. So if Sarada was Sakura's child she would have been born in the village.</br>  <br> not the type of unit that is put on long term missions <br>You're assuming there, don't think that's ever stated, but I could be wrong.<br><br>The only way sakura being the mom would make sense is if she went out for a mission that took longer than 9 months. But has there ever been such a mission described in the manga? Furthermore where would this mission take place? From what we've seen it takes only a couple of days max to traverse the entire continent. If sakura got pregnant on the job why didn't she return to the village when she noticed? That would be the responsible thing to do at least. I guess it's possible she just had the baby in another village but then why couldn't shizune just tell salad that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura a medic nin, she doesn't specialize in attacking or espionage, her specialty is healing people. By all logic she isn't the type of unit that you would put on a long term mission, she's better served in the hospital.</br>  <br>If Sakura was on a long term mission that took longer than 9 months Naruto would have mentioned it, after all he's the hokage the person who hands out missions.</br>  <br>Rather than the two of them trying to convince the other characters, I think it's just Kishimoto trying hard to convince the readers.<br><br>And himself, probably, since he said he honestly has no idea how they actually got together.</br></br></br>  <br>Not all missions could be about fighting and even if it is, it would be more logical to take a medic ninja on long term missions. Asuming she wouldn't have to do it alone.<br><br><br>Nardo became hokage years after Salad was born so it's possible he didn't know anything about it. One thing is for sure though this whole business shows that naruto is barely in touch with Sakura if he didn't even know she was pregnant.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nardo became hokage years after Salad was born so it's possible he didn't know anything about it. One thing is for sure though this whole business shows that naruto is barely in touch with Sakura if he didn't even know she was pregnant. <br><br>He's a busy man m8. Once you get settled down kids eat up so much time that friends and acquaintances just float away or are a passing glimpse until you get them in school and can do shit again.</br></br></br>  <br>Except the Naruto world is at peace, and again a long term mission would be something more along the lines of espionage, which isn't Sakura's specialty. Actually considering her fighting style she is the worst person to put on that kind of mission, especially because she is well known.<br><br>But then Naruto would still have the records, therefore he'd still have the information, and being a close friend he would be aware of whether or not Sakura is on a long term mission that lasted more than 9 months. We know that Naruto has been in contact with Sasuke for all of these years as well, so if Sakura went on a long term mission with Sasuke he'd know.</br></br></br>  <br>At no point in time has anyone in the series ever even hinted that Naruto no longer stays in contact with Sakura.</br>  <br>To be fair, expecting foreshadowing for anything is giving Kishimoto too much credit.</br>  <br>Actually all things considered Kishimoto has always used foreshadowing and it has almost always been too transparent.<br><br>(ex:Tobi=Obito, Naruto being the 4th's son)</br></br></br>  <br>If Nardo doesn't question the dna test it means he was never even involved in the pregnancy process. If nardo had seen a pregnant sakura he would have questioned the dna test but he didn't. The only way this would make sense is if sakura just showed up with a kid one day.</br>  How sizable were NS fans before they got blown the fuck out? <br><br>I can comprehend why anyone would want naruto to get with such a person.</br></br>  <br>They had an entire active forum dedicated to hoping Nurdu would stick his nine inch tails in pinkshit's yin seal. Their meltdown during The Last/700 was glorious.</br>  <br>I don't get it. He gets incredibly pissed at Sasuke for this whole shit, apparently the nigger wasn't even there for Sarada's birth. But by the time of the movie Naruto still considers him his BFF and gives him full custody of Boruto.</br>  <br>Pretty sizeable, there's a still a load of them. I think the Shippuden fanbase in Japan is still pretty big, too.<br> There was a lot of incredible assrage after 698 from them lol. <br><br>I personally felt it was the least stupid of the pairings considering it was the only one that got consistent development/foreshadowing but really Sakura jerked Nardo around way too much for it to be that likeable a pairing.</br></br></br></br>  I feel like Kishimoto is really begrudging with Sasu/Saku. He knows he has to put them together to make spinoff spawn but clearly doesn't fucking want to and regrets it, considering how Sasuke brutally rejected Sakura, then later when he was in a better mood gently pushed her away. Then he's just ignored Salad and Sakura for 12 whole years.  <br>To start with consider how most of the porn had Pinkshit as the main girl.<br>Now throw in the fact that regardless of the series everyone always expects the tsundere main girl to win (despite the fact that Sakura is not in any way shape or form tsundere, she just does the Comic Effect Girl Slap) and how fucking rare it is for a best girl to win, especially in this genre.<br>Add some morons falling for the parallels red herring, and you have quite a number of people.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fucking Naruto. He could've found a way to forgive Hitler.</br>  <br>Well it's not really Naruto's place to be angry at sauce. If Salad and pinkshit can forgive him and be ok with everything, then naruto doesn't really have a reason to be angry. Sauce didn't really cheat on Naruto.<br><br>As for giving full custody to Bort, that would be stupid of nardo yes. Though it's possible he just meant 'protect my son while I'm dead'. We'd need to see the movie to get all the context.<br><br> Also dadruto isn't going to die ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It depends on your definition of tsundere, really. If she had won the Narubowl, she would've been a classic one, I guess. <br>Tsun -&gt; dere</br></br>  <br>Yet the nigger writes Karin's spawn as the combination of the two and chose to do this stupid drama that still ends with the two of them being married over anything he could have written.</br>  <br>And yet he has also written that Sakura is only really married to Sasuke in name only, and has probably never kissed him, never mind ever getting the D. While Sasuke goes off and fucks other women.</br>  <br>Well she did not, for she had no attraction to hide by being a cunt.<br>We do see her around someone she does have attraction for, where she is the full-on pathetic doormat. Some people seem to have constructed a character out of whatever fanfiction they've read and whatever porn they masturbated to, called her Sakura and willed themselves to see her whenever Pinkshit was in a scene. That does not make her a tsundere, merely her fans incredibly delusional.</br></br>  <br>She does warm up to him though so it's pretty clasic tsundere. I don't think love has anything to do with being tsundere.</br>  <br>That's not tsundere though, a tsundere is a person who likes another person but hides their affection behind harshness. Sakura didn't like Naruto, she was just being a bitch.</br>  <br>The female fans project themselves onto the main female character. Big surprise.</br>  I don't get it.<br><br> Karin chooses employment with Orochimaru over raising her kid yet she at least bothers sending glasses to Sarada <br><br> Sasuke hasn't done shit for Sarada, nor has contacted her in the past 12 years <br><br> Sarada still considers Sasuke to be a parent to her and wants nothing to do with Karin <br><br> Sasuke is still meant to be a good guy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, but "likes" isn't always romantic, it can be friendship-wise too, so she fits</br>  <br> Karin chooses employment with Orochimaru over raising her kid yet she at least bothers sending glasses to Sarada <br>It might not be her choice. She did join a terrorist organisation, escape captivity (probably killed some low-tier poor fucks on her way out) AND didn't do much to further the war for the good guys' side once out. Big people too powerful to contain to begin with (Sausage, Orochimaru) might be pardoned, but she would have a much more difficult time.</br></br>  <br>Even going frienship wise she still doesn't, because her "tsundere" behavior was really her looking down on him. <br><br>Tsundere are harsh to hide how they really feel, Sakura is harsh because she's a bitch. Big difference.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if that counts as Tsundere.<br><br>Sakura was almost always too harsh at Naruto.<br><br>Save some few introspections in which she realizes and comments how Naruto is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and how useless she feels about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  While it's been a fun ride, i can't help to feel a bit sad about Sakura. Sure she may come off as the most mature character in the series after all this is over but all of thist just feels weird, too much real drama for a manga about ninja gods.<br>I'm only a casual Nurudu reader and i only cared about the possibility of NH. That happened and it was great as you all can remember.<br><br>But really, for some reason i feel a little sad for Sakura. What the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>That's like Hitler getting pardoned but some random prison guard not.<br><br>Not to mention how Kabuto is most likely chilling in his orphanage despite being the sole responsible for the zombie army that killed tens of thousands of ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>tsundere can both mean transition from genuine tsun to genuine dere and acting tsun while feeling dere</br>  <br> Sakura <br> mature <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Except we're missing the dere, as anon stated</br>  <br>A tsundere is someone who goes from tsun to dere as  points out tsun -&gt; dere. Nowhere does this stipulate that romantic feelings must be involved, it's just a meme that a tsundere is someone who denies and hides their feelings for another character. <br><br>I guess the meaning of a word can change by popular use and in that case she wouldn't a tsundere. But in the original meaning of the word she's classic tsundere.<br><br>Speaking of tsunderes, hasn't Salad been acting a little tsundere towards bort? She has been calling him stupid alot.</br></br></br></br></br>  Sakura's feeling towards Naruto felt more sisterly than someone with romantic feelings.<br><br>She just wanted to make sure he was taking care of himself and not making mistakes. The fake confession kind proved this by now she couldn't believe her own bullshit.</br></br>  <br>If Hitler kept coming back to life when you killed him</br>  <br> BoruSara's kid is Kaguya <br>ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU</br></br>  <br>She could always just claim sanctuary with Naruto, seeing as they're related. She could also easily lie her way out of it, since she had a pretty easy time fooling all the interrogators apart from Ibiki, and Naruto could shut him up easily if she just claimed she was being forced to help Sasuke/Orochimaru/Akatsuki. I imagine Nardo would have been overjoyed to find out he has living Uzumaki relation, too.<br><br>What a huge, wasted plot point her being Uzumaki is. Where are my Uzumaki clan adventures where aunt Karin takes Himawari on field trips and teaches her how to dissect corpses?</br></br></br>  <br>Romantic feelings aren't necessary, but the problem is Sakura is never actually dere. Sakura is too harsh for it to be tsundere. She's just a bit.</br>  <br>He only came back to life because Sasuke brought him back to life.</br>  <br>I think at least in madara arc she was dere</br>    Fuck, where did all these Sakurafags come from?  <br> Karin chooses employment with Orochimaru over raising her kid yet she at least bothers sending glasses to Sarada <br><br>Sakura might be infertile and she might have been surrogate meaning she's genetially hers but not hers.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt Naruto cares about her.</br>  The Tsunade seal thing fucked up Sakura's body so in order to give birth she had to keep drinking Karin's blood. Karin's blood went straight to the baby so Sarada has a daddy and two mommies. <br><br>Enjoy.</br></br>  <br>Well she definitely doesn't stop being a bitch but I'm sure there are some dere moments somewhere.</br>  <br>And it's not like anyone else can do anything about him. Sauce don't give a fuck, and he's got the coolest excuse for ninjesus. Who's gonna stop him?</br>  <br>The issue here is that faggots like Kabuto or Orochimaru are so far out of the league of mos jounin or even most Kage (neither could be killed due to curse seal ressurection/infinite Sage chakra regeneration, never mind keeping them locked up somewhere) that some sort of compromise has to be reached.<br>Karin is nowhere near that level of power or possible utility to play, and the best place she could go to is to work for one of these incredibly powerful players. <br><br><br>Had the whole thing of her being an Uzumaki been played with more, maybe even going so far as giving her and Naruto a scene together talking about the subject, she could have turned to Nardo for a pardon. They never really interacted, so it's feasible neither know of the other being a fellow clansman or that she would not turn to someone unknown to her for help when there's a far more known quantity in the form of Orochimaru to deal with.<br>But yeah, that whole plot point, like the rest of the manga, is a massive, potentially interesting/good thing that went to waste.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>From what we could assume, Karin used to be a genin from other village until she crossed paths with Oro's gang.<br><br>Probably wasn't her choice either, probably was kidnapped and had to gain their trust over the years since she was the prison guard and was also left with Sasuke's custody.<br><br>She probably got accostumed to that life or knew too much about things to escape and most likely has enough common sense to know that raising a child in that enviroment would not be healthy. Look at the Shin Jrs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Naruto is thirsty as fuck for family. He'd also have a boner for red hair and chakra chains, just like mommy.</br>  <br>He has a low opinion of team taka and he already has his own family.</br>  <br> He has a low opinion of team taka <br>Yet all they did was blindly follow his husbando's orders.</br></br>  <br>I don't even think he knows that they're related, besides that Naruto doesn't have an Oedipus complex.</br>  <br>Naruto holding Sasuke up to same standard he does everyone else? Perish the thought.</br>  <br> Naruto doesn't have an Oedipus complex <br><br>The only people Naruto has called good looking have been Kushina, Sakura, Sasuke, Haku and the chick Itachi genjutsu'd to get Jiraiya away from him.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck people could ship them?</br>  <br>He still doesn't have an Oedipus complex. He and Kushina are both Yang.</br>  <br> He has a low opinion of team taka <br><br><br> Yet all they did was blindly follow his husbando's orders. <br><br>Damn, sometimes I forget how hypocrite Naruto is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>twilight fans</br>  <br>I ship them the same way that I throw rotten banana peels and used tissues in the same trash can.<br><br>  quarantine ship </br></br></br>  <br> Sakura <br>Confirmed that he wasn't really that Naruto wasn't really interested in her?<br><br> Kushina <br>because you've never complemented your mother.<br><br> Sasuke <br>I'll give you that one<br><br> Haku <br>Literally the best looking person in the entire cast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When does he show he has a low opinion of them?</br>  <br><br> Billie Jean <br><br>Did I fucking miss something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget that Obito is the coolest guy.</br>  <br>As far as I know, only self inserts ship them. The reason so many girls ship them is probably because 'changing a bad boy'-trope.</br>  <br> because you've never complemented your mother. <br>I haven't, but my mom was never a hot 20 year old redhead.</br></br>  <br> changing a bad boy'-trope. <br><br>I fucking hate that type of shoujo tropes.</br></br></br>  <br>check the archive</br>  <br><br> Pic <br><br>I love it, because it implies Sarada and Bort are cousins and Bort x Inojin are OTP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The sending glasses to Sarada spoiler seemed to be referring to Karin sending Suigetsu to deliver a new pair of glasses to Sarada, since Suigetsu messed around in Karin's desk earlier to get the DNA sample after she warned him not to touch it. If that is an accurate reading those might be the different pair of glasses seen on Sarada in the movie trailer. Maybe implies Sarada's Sharingan-copied Homewrecker Punch caused collateral damage to her first pair.</br>  <br><br>Jesus, the one with "KARIN IS MOM" is borderline genius.</br></br>  <br> http://m.imgur.com/a/XKwJ4 <br>Obligatory</br></br>  <br>Also Nagato turned out to be an Uzumaki and Naruto didn't seem to make that connection as well. So he had two living relatives for potential Uzumaki shenanigans that didn't occur.</br>  <br>Is the red hair the only indicator of being an Uzumaki, by the way?<br>Because then that black girl Chouji married might be at least partially one, and a bunch of other characters too.</br></br>  <br> Is the red hair the only indicator of being an Uzumaki, by the way? <br>Being a walking chakra battlecruiser is usually a dead giveaway.</br></br>  <br>Was Karin stated/shown to be that?</br>  <br>Yes, Sasuke biting her to be healed. She is walking battery.</br>  <br>Fair enough.</br>  <br><br><br>not to mention that she can at least fuck with tailed-beast level chakra constructs with her chain hax.<br><br>the only secondary trait karui shares with uzumaki is being a foul-tempered redhead woman, which was not shown either way for mito</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm still curious about why Karin is the mom. Not if she is since everything Evil has said pretty much confirms she is, but rather why her and what led to it.  <br> why her <br>Because fucking her is the closest Sauce is ever going to get to fucking nardo.</br></br>  <br>Well Sasuke was never in the village, and has never shown any interest in Sakura at all. Besides Uzumaki = closest Sasuke will ever get to fucking Naruto.</br>  <br>sasuke like ginger</br>  <br>most likely explanation is karin spermjacked sauce (who may also be a closet case), pink shit's infertile from healing hax, and karin wanted to keep her kid away from snakes mengele.<br><br>seriously.</br></br></br>  <br> he fucks Karin <br> makes her put on a blonde wig and draw silly lines on her face <br> he fucks Sakura (theoretical scenario) <br> he makes her wear a black wig and make her draw silly lines on her face </br></br></br></br>  <br>  implying sauce would top itachi and not the other way around </br>  <br>Because it gives Kishi chance to implement Uzumaki techniques in Sarada and </br>  <br>This is confusing, is this girl Evil always this vague? The very last post tells me the Karin is mom thing isn't real. And Sarada is ok with Sakura not being her biological mom so technically that isn't a lie.</br>    Christ checking out that forum with the spoilers, why are they pretending they're on 4chan on a forum? They even try to greentext.  <br> finally, Sasuke has agreed to spend a night with me <br> this will be so worth all those times him trying to kill me! <br> eh, you want me to put on this wig? I suppose I'm willing to do tha- and draw lines from my eyes? Okay. <br> so now, are you ready to ravage me? <br> you want me to do what with a strap-on? <br> i- is it at least one of those double-headed kinds? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto never got to use any Uzumaki techniques yet Sarada will despite already having the shitload of stuff that comes with the sharingan and all of Tsunade's techniques?</br>  <br>Sasuke had to have kids for the cash in film franchise, and only knows two women: Karin, who he doesn't mind and never rejected, and Sakura, who he thinks is an annoyance and viciously rejected.<br><br>It makes more sense he banged Karin. But him banging a woman at all is a bit of a goddamn stretch.</br></br></br>  <br>Her hips look wide.<br><br>Does she hide bite marks on her thighs? Is that why she wears ZR?</br></br></br>  <br>At this point in time hasn't Sasuke technically been around Karin much longer than Sakura?</br>  <br>You could say the same thing about Naruto and Sasuke barely being around each other yet they still consider each other's BFF.</br>  <br><br>Not to mention the "how".<br><br>If Karin somehow spermjacked Sauce, it would sound plausible... well, I don't know if him literally cheating Pink also is, but still, it would be very something very dickish of him to put out there.<br><br>Not that I care, because that's the path Pink Shit chose, but to think of the children that read this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the time in academy count?<br>I would not say it does, but I'm sure some would try to argue with that.<br>But that aside not only has he spent more time with Karin, but he actually hand-picked her for her abilities whereas he considered Sakura dead weight.</br></br></br>  <br>With Naruto it's somewhat explainable given his history. With Sakura however, it's just a mystery.<br><br><br>He wasn't spending any time with her when they were in the academy so I wouldn't say it does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's known her canonically for about two or three years when Shippuden starts. Sakura, he knew for less than one.<br><br>Karin also actually knows him and knows about the Uchiha massacre etc, which is much better grounds for any kind of relationship.<br><br>...How many times have Sasuke and Sakura even interacted in Shippuden, anyway? All I remember is him ignoring her and paying more attention to Sai when they found him the first time, then they teamed up at the very end of the manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How many times have Sasuke and Sakura even interacted in Shippuden, anyway? <br>How much did they really interact in part 1? Sakura's entire obsession is based on nothing but looks.</br></br>  <br>Yet for some reason these are the last interactions we are shown between Sasuke and them.</br>  <br>I think he was kinda protective of her in the Forest of Death and against Gaara and said thank you to her when he deserted. <br>That's more or less it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, because Kishi was focusing in making Nardo's own set of techniques and never developed the Uzumaki chacharacter techniques beyond huge chakra tanks and to a lesser extent, the chains, not to mention those Uzumaki techniques were also implementsled late in the story, when Nardo already had plenty other shit he could do.<br><br><br>Adding Sakura/Tsunade techniques along with Uchiha shit are only to make her justu list bigger and because muh symbolism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>evil's initial clues have always ended up true if only in indirect interpretation.<br><br>she's falsely renounced spoilers before, which most people are assuming she's doing this time when somebody says "you're lying, right"?<br><br>of course, this is presumably the last nardo manga for quite a while, so if she really wanted to lie through her teeth to stir shit, now's the time, since her moment in the spotlight is about over.</br></br></br></br></br>  Karin in Shippuden:<br> handpicked by Sasuke as the most skilled kunoichi he knows <br> knows about the Uchiha massacre <br> saved eachother multiple times <br> Sasuke unlocks sharingan abilities to save her <br> part of a team dynamic that Sasuke considers close to family <br> supported him and tried to help him even when she was dying at his feet <br> Sasuke apologises to her before proclaiming he doesnt care what anybody thinks of him <br> he never really rejects her advances <br><br>Sakura in Shippuden:<br> Sasuke either ignored, belittled or attacked her <br> he was happy to let her die in lava <br> doesn't understand anything about his past or why he wanted to destroy Konoha <br> tries to guilt trip Sasuke by saying she loves him so he needs to stop <br> Sasuke puts her in a brutal genjutsu and rejects her for the second time <br> pokes her on the forehead when she wants to come with him, reusing Itachi's distancing gesture <br><br>Suddenly Sasuke and Karin forming a babby makes more sense than him and Sakura getting it on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She only did that because people kept insisting the spoiler was false, so she went along with it, and this was after she posted said spoiler.</br>  <br> so Sakura fans legitimately have to fall back on the 'IT'S WHO RAISED HER THAT MATTERS WAAAH' <br><br>but that would mean sasuke can be a dad because he didn't raise her<br><br>either way they lose<br><br>brilliant Kishi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Come on, this was the only moment Sasuke ever gave a shit about taka as something other than means to achieve his goals.<br><br>SS is shit and should have never happened, yet we still kept being hammered about how Sakura's feelings were true love with even Kakashi shamelessly shipping them. And now Sarada is actually going to be written as a combination of Sasuke and Sakura rather than as the girl Sasuke we all thought she was going to be.</br></br></br>  <br> Whatever happens, their suburban two-parent nuclear SasuSaku family can't turn out.<br><br>I wonder...all according to keikaku, Kishimoto? Or did you just write yourself into a corner trying to work out how you can make SasuSaku work?</br></br></br>  <br>And in part II Sasuke is only ever shown giving a shit about Naruto, but not about the other two. He then goes on to spend more time with them in the 15 year time so overall yes he has spent more time with them.</br>  <br>Nice essay, Karinfag. The only moment Sauce cared for Karin was when he remember his "beloved" team 7.</br>  <br> he has spent more time with them. <br>Does that mean that NS makes more sense since Naruto spent way more time with Sakura than he ever did with Hinata prior to the Last?</br></br>  <br>Pherhaps assistant-kun secretly despises SS and has been subtly manipulating Kishi into this corner.</br>  <br>she has been quiet for months<br><br>dattebae is the one still bitching and she ships both ns and ss + is a huge sakura fag and hinata hater, so this is probably tearing her a new asshole</br></br></br>  <br>screenshot that shit<br><br>especially the "lol sakura is obviously the mother"</br></br></br>  <br>so a hypothetical anti-editor-kun?</br>  <br> the kind of person who stabs a woman with a pipe mind rapes her then strangles her to death. <br> coolest guy <br>No kishi, I don't care how much you wank uchihas THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke caring about Taka was a pretty big moment, considering his betraying them symbolised his fall into DARKNESS. <br>As Sasuke leaves Suigetsu and Juugo behind, he becomes unhinged. As soon as Sasuke sacrifices Karin, he goes completely off the deep end.<br><br>He was trying to cut bonds with people he considered important to gain his edgelord powers--Taka and Naruto. <br><br>Eventually Sakura got in his way, so she was going to get carelessly run down alongside Kakashi, because Sasuke felt he'd already cut his bonds with them.<br><br>Taka was neat. Kind of a shame they, like all other cool side characters, got pretty shafted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It honestly seems like Sasuke married Sakura just so she could legally look after Salad and she wouldn't lose face for apparently having a criminal's child out of wedlock <br>that would be so cruel to ss fags<br><br>do it, kishi</br></br></br></br>  <br> naruto is barely in touch with Sakura if he didn't even know she was pregnant <br><br>so much for muh team 7 and naruto being ss's third wheel</br></br></br>  <br> it was the only one that got consistent development/foreshadowing <br>nope<br><br>the development was never romantic and naruto never took his crush seriously unless sasuke was involved</br></br></br></br>  <br> people said naruto was the third wheel <br>Never heard that one. everyone knows sakura was the third wheel of sasuke and naruto's mad bromance. besides taka&gt;team 7.</br></br>  <br>Sakurafags want naruto to be the third wheel so he can worship their self-insert.</br>  <br>kiba is more tsundere towards naruto than sakura ever was</br>  <br>the surrogate theory just makes her look like a bitch, karin helped her and she pasted herself on top of her photo?</br>  <br>It had enough hints, for a shounen mango, to be considered romantic. Also Nardo constantly thirsted after Sakura, constantly asked her out on dates and got all mad when she brought Sai to cockblock. He was pretty into her.<br><br>Sakura's feelings were left "ambiguous" so Kishi could safely choose either her or Hinata at the end, depending on character popularity.<br><br>Nardo senpai only noticed Hinata during the movie apparently, despite her confessing to him in shippydens.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok.<br>why does the existence of one tsundere character disqualify other tsunderes from being counted as tsundere?</br></br>  <br>self insert ship for girls that think they are reading a shoujo and sakura is the regular girl that will melt the asshole's heart when nobody else could</br>  Sai was the best waifu.  <br>The Springtime of Darkness guy? I don't think so.</br>  <br>sakura fags have been making jokes and fanarts about naruto being the third wheel and fangirling over ss family</br>  <br>Last night was fun.</br>  <br>Man gaiden was a kick in the nuts for SS self inserters.<br> sakura wins the sauce, they're married and have a daughter, it's a dream come true. <br> ignore the hints at the end of 700 that suggests sarada wasn't close to sasuke <br>suddenly gaiden<br> sakura hasn't seen sasuke for about 12 years.  <br> sarada doesn't even know he's missing an arm <br>  they don't even have a real family picture <br> also sarada isn't actually the fruit of their love, it's actually karin and sauce's bastard that sakura is raising <br> the first time sarada actually meets her dad he tries to stake her <br> Any hope they ever had of self inserting into a functioning relationship with their husbando is dead. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it really didn't, naruto never took his crush seriously unless sasuke was involved, they didn't understand each other at all and the "hints" always came from people that didn't know them</br>  <br> She told my baby we'd danced 'til three <br> Then she looked at me <br> She showed a photo of a baby crying <br> His eyes looked like mine <br> Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby <br><br> His eyes looked like mine </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serve them right.</br>  <br> that suggests sarada wasn't close to sasuke <br>To be fair in 700 Sarada compared her daddy issues with Bort. Which most people thought that he Sauce was constantly traveling so they didn't spend much time together as she wished.<br><br>There was nothing there that hinted that she had never even met the guy.</br></br></br></br>    <br> He wouldn't care, though, since he will replace her with Bort <br> tfw he literally gets to have two wieners </br></br>    <br> wizards <br>It is.</br></br>  <br>They were cocky pricks sure, but compared to the rape he gave narusaku SS is on another level. They're pairing is canonacally shit. How do you come back from that?</br>  <br>Well, Naruto did overdo it while fangirling about Sarada being the perfect combination of Sasuke and Sakura.</br>  <br>Babysat by Cuckura.</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br>this is how you know that Pink Shit fans are empathy-lacking sociopaths like their "queen".<br><br>the long suffering orphan MC is just a slapstick comedy prop to be beaten when he annoys one of the characters they want/want to be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>at least Chou Chou is in character there.</br></br>  <br>Team taka better than muh team 7</br>  <br>What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<wbr>uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<wbr>uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<wbr>uuu</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>It's like the opposite of what actually happened. like Sarada this chapter was like "Atleast this guy (she doesn't even call him dad or father or papa!) isn't that shit!</br>   they still don't understand <br>No matter what the outcome is, the point is to laugh at SSfags. They're the ones getting fucked no matter what.<br><br>Also check out this neat poster of Salad showing off her ass to Bort while their dads make bedroom eyes at each other.</br></br></br>  <br>A shame.<br><br>This kind of a bit stylized artstyle looks nice, such a waste.</br></br></br>  <br>well, he is an orphan who knows the pain of not having one or more parent around.<br>saying nice things about a runaway kid's parents is probably just the right nice/common sense thing to do, so I'm not sure what else people would have expected.</br></br>  <br>Sakura should be the "seriously" as she's the only one in that panel who doesn't want naruto's dick.</br>  <br>Karin giving her body to Sauce as a surrogate because Pink has fried eggs confirmed. <br><br>I get the feeling that the real spoilers are hidden in the song choices.</br></br></br>  <br>the coic has over 10,000 notes in dumblr</br>  <br> of Salad showing off her ass to Bort while their dads make bedroom eyes at each other. <br><br>To me, it looks more like Sarada and Boruto with their true parental figures.</br></br></br>  Friendly reminder that the best outcome is Pink being barren because it'll not only kill SS, but retroactively destroy every pairing involving Sakura giving birth to horrible OC donutsteel kids.  Sauce seems to asexual for sex to me.<br><br> crying over a manga <br>That person with the FT avatar seems very delusional.</br></br></br>  <br>Team Taka + Naruto/Sakura/Sai Team 7 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; muh team 7<br><br>All three of them were happier when they weren't in their original T7 teamup.</br></br></br>  <br> send help <br> Naruto please <br> I was sorry <br> Why you do this man </br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura not in any of the promotional material for the movie <br>kek</br></br>  <br>What a cute sunflower.</br>  <br>The fact that favoritism-sensei wasn't around might have something to do with that.</br>  <br>High res of that poster when?</br>  <br> These people interpreting Billie Jean from Sauce PoV instead of Sakura's </br>  <br>too*<br><br>Whoops.</br></br></br>   Remember, No Editors   <br>maybe I'm missing something, but isn't BJ from Sauce's PoV the correct one?<br><br>  bitch says this kid is mine <br>  no way <br>  oh fuck it is <br><br>isn't it basically spermjack confirmed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto and Sakura spent the whole time with Sai whining about how much they wished Sasuke was back.<br><br>They were never as happy with Sai as they were when Sasuke showed up in the war.</br></br></br>  <br> Pink being a cuck triggers a wave of mass landwhale suicides </br>  <br> And he'll also leave again at the end of Gaiden with some vague promise to keep Sakura happily raising his spawn <br>And he doesn't even show up again until Bort goes out to find him.

It happens occasionally in Hunter x Hunter, but only to real dickheads, or if the guy doing it is sort of a dick himself. If someone shows bro potential they have a real chance of walking, however. Some characters are also soft, or can be. (Although clearly, not all the time. Killua will pull peoples heads off, but he's learning to make the choice not to. Although, observe how well controlled his father is and how he fucking ganked Cheetu. He squashed him like a bug.)<br><br>The Spiders of course, are also clearly quite ruthless although they have elected to walk/let other people walk, too. (Gon, Kil, still breathing, etc.) Some more than others. Some of them are fucking insane even by Hisoka or Illumi standards. (other examples. Hisoka lets worthy opponents live, people he thinks are annoying little bitches, he slaughters.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want a protagonist with no honorable goals?<br><br>While both pirates and marines are made up of good and bad people throughout, the huge difference is that the leading pirate figures are good guys while the leading marine figures are bad guys (morally, I mean).<br><br>Garp and Aokiji were the only good people at the top at Marineford and they were both disgusted with how things went down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with that ? Did you expect him to drink shark juice instead or something ?<br>They just picked him up as a child. We don't know anything else.</br></br>  <br>false reports get you banned, you know</br>  <br>I wasnt that guy, plenty of people answered him as I was chewing you guys out</br>  <br> Luffy being the greatest marine <br> not Ace </br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't false though. <br><br>Announcing does though, but I couldn't give a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you</br>  <br> board culture <br><br><br>it was false though.

The only reason to watch it is for Mashiro and Benio who are the only fun characters, and for the self-insert fantasy fulfillment if you're subhuman trash who should kill himself.  <br><br>I dunno, I couldn't self-insert myself to a dog-man.</br></br>  <br> beniofags </br>  <br>Nigger at least the two had fun banter, as opposed to the MC being a bland zero personality twat manufactured as a blank slate to self insert as and a love interest that is handed to him on a silver platter who is engineered to be a perfect housewife and an airheaded bimbo.</br>  <br><br>My problem with Mikakunin was the MC. Just really felt forced.<br><br>If he's meant for self-insert, I feel they failed at making him one cause I admit, I'm guilty for falling for some self-insert characters but this one was just stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>3.4 mb <br>u wot m8?<br>You must really like Kobeni.</br></br></br>  <br>He's skinny. He's black haired. He's timid. Very considerate and kind at heart and he cares a lot for the girl. He's awkward and finds it difficult to express himself. People find him weird and hard to read. They knew their target audience and it's so blatantly obvious that it becomes impossible to ignore just how obnoxious it is.</br>  <br>The mc is not meant for self insert nor is he the MC<br>Kobeni is the mc<br>Girls are supposed to identfy with her<br>Not you with the guy<br>Twat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only one worth sticking a dick is in the loli. Cute ED though.</br>  <br>He's not the main character for the last time, christ <br>And he's not a perfect stand-in because he's scarred, tall and broad shouldered, canon really handsome, and the butt of the joke instead of always being the witty deadpan voice of reason.<br>The only thing "blatantly obvious" is that you're retarded</br></br></br>  <br>I guess you're right, now that I think of it. It's just that I find it hard to believe girls were the target audience of the show</br>  <br> Girls are supposed to identfy with her <br>And guys are supposed to insert as the guy. You seem to be under the impression that it's shoujo. It's not.</br></br>  <br>No they're not. The guy literally has no presence.</br>  <br>Just like the average otaku this is aimed at.</br>  S2 when?  <br>Too boring for season 2. The only good thing about Mikakunin is the character designs and the OP/ED</br>  <br>It was enjoyable and the animation was pretty good for moeshit</br>  <br>It was only enjoyable when the self insert faggot wasn't on screen. Seriously just remove him and romance entirely.</br>  <br>He almost never was.<br>The loli was the MC</br></br>  <br>No, the loli was his voice, but he was pretty much in 70% of the show, not to mention the dumb "romance" theme was there through the whole thing.</br>  <br><br> self insert faggot <br><br>Who? The silent guy? He's literally a dog. Who would self insert as him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga there was no romance.<br>Kobeni blushed a couple of times and that was it.<br><br>Im pretty sure youre a yurifaggot</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>HOLY FUCKING SHIT, YOU GUYS, I CAN'T STAND THAT YOU ENJOY SOMETHING THAT I DON'T, STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT I'M CHOKING ON A BILLION DICKS<br><br>That's you, that's what you sound like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> waah why aren't you guys circlejerking about how great this show is how dare you dislike something that I like and voice dissenting opinion where is my safe circlejerk bubble <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br></br>   /a/ hates mikakunin now <br><br>what happened?</br></br>    <br><br>Mashiro can't carry a shitty premise<br><br>Maybe if Dogshitkobo wasn't the most frugal studio in existence when it comes to hiring seiyuu and gave Mashiro and voice that wasn't A FUCKING FIRST TIMER</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said "romance". All Kobeni did was try to get close to that guy or feel bad for making him save her.</br>  <br>It's just one shitter hating on a literal background character.</br>   Show is about being engaged <br> upset there's romance in it </br>  <br><br>Just one fag sucking dick.</br></br>  <br>Samefag samefagging hard.</br>  <br>I'm upset because the romance was absolutely atrocious and went nowhere. They also needed a better male, that idiot has the personality of a fucking rock.</br>   this past year seeing Kobeni <br> took my sweet ass time not picking up this anime <br> remembers the past year of /a/ talking about Mikakunin and their love for Kobeni and Mashiro <br> gifs and webms enticing me to watch it <br> finally gets to watch it cause it seems like it's such a loved anime <br> sees a thread <br> there's hate <br><br>what is it about watching an anime where pre-watch it seems like everyone is fond of the anime then after watching it, you start to see negatives spring about?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only good thing about the show are Mashiro and Kobeni. The rest is forgettable.</br>  <br>No, he just didn't wear his heart out on his sleeve. That was the point of the backgrounds.<br><br><br>It's just one loser. Keep on it, anon, it's a decent watch with prime waifu material.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kobeni <br> background character <br>You what now?<br><br><br>I'm upset there's garbage romance in it.<br><br><br>Keep assuring yourself that anyone calling out your shit taste is just one person if that helps you sleep at night.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if it was actual dissenting opinions and ideas instead of the same unrelenting shitposting over and over again, I might agree with you. But it's not. It's blatant shitposting that exaggerates the same points over and over again.</br>    <br><br> shitting on something needlessly <br><br>Hope you can actually sleep.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was under the impression that you were crying about the dog, not Kobeni.</br>  <br> appraising something that has no value <br>Same for you.</br></br>  <br>Clearly, it's a harsh case of irritable bowel syndrome that he's been misinformed about since he seems to believe that every time there's another explosion of rotting fecal matter, it needs to be aimed at something. And considering the constant outpouring of shit, no, I don't think he can sleep.</br>  <br>They're both terrible, shallow characters with no fun quirks to make up for it.</br>  <br>Again, this is not just an opinion.

For those that missed it, Enjoyhasu~  <br>Sensei for lyfe.<br>with heaping tons of totsuka dojins</br></br>  The Haruno end is inevitable. Have you learned to deal with that fact yet?  When does the 8bowl end?<br>I want my god of a new world back.</br>  <br>It's hardly a soap opera, I think a lot of people are just upset because the drama at the end of 13 soiled what was starting off as a really touching moment.<br><br>But if you think about it, that's precisely the point. Yui seemed like she was finally opening up to 8man, but then she soiled it with her awful genuine speech gambit purely because she refused to be honest about her feelings.<br><br>The ending is ugly because that's what it was supposed to be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're trying so hard...</br>  Will this franchise still be relevant by 2017?<br><br>Because 2017 sure is when we'll get the 3rd and final season</br></br>  <br>No, anon, you are being too kind. I don't even try as hard anywhere near as hard as the Irohafags.</br>  <br>It's not a sopa opera because of ugly feelings, it's a soap opera because there's practically nothing BUT muh feelings adn stupid bullshit i could find in any old jrpg.<br>The ending is going to be oreimo or haganai, calling it.</br></br>  I believe Yui fell in love with Hachiman on first sight when he rescued her dog.<br>To her it must have been some fairy tale moment, or a manga fated encounter. And that must be the simple reason why she crushed on him.<br><br>I find that adorable, even if I'm a Yukinofag.</br></br></br>  <br>If you don't like complex emotions and character development feel free to watch another show instead.</br>  I R O H A<br>R<br>O<br>H<br>A</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm feeling good about Iroha's chances but holy fuck almost none of her for an entire volume is suffering.</br>  <br>Are you an idiot or someone who just came in from MAL?<br>or are you just illiterate?</br></br>  Why 8man just not fuck both of them? It would be genuine.  Y A H A L L O<br>A<br>H<br>A<br>L<br>L<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you even here? Do you somehow feel fulfilled by copypasting buzzwords in the most inane fashion possible?</br>  <br>MAL then.</br>  <br>I'll take that as a "yes".</br>  <br>why are you the only one here?</br>  <br>/a/ is one person.</br>  Iroha, Totally Not Your Imouto So It's Okay in the Eyes of the Court and God, Isshiki  <br>I especially like how that evolved into a real love on her part over time. From a crush on this creepy, weird guy through the first few three books, to falling for him all over again across the next few books, then finally the last bit of volume 8 where she "confesses" again and tries to comfort him after the twitter gambit. That one scene says so much about how she feels about him now that it's mind-boggling.</br>  <br>Confirmed best</br>  <br>She did disappear for half the volume, but look at it this way.<br>The few scenes that she got were very good ones, 8man even dropped the romcom cliche "嫌いじゃないけど" on her.<br><br>Though, I don't think anyone will win in just one volume, if vol 12 is indeed the last.</br></br></br></br>  Yuigahamama will win the 8bowl. Mark my words.  Did Spyro really kill himself?   Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe <br><br> the cutest delusion </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah it's really sad because we all know that's how it's gonna end.</br></br>  <br><br>Yui should win him first so that she could reel him in.</br></br>  <br>I think her disappearing is good for her. If she had any status quo filler scenes it would undermine the significance of her valentine's scenes.<br><br>The fact that she disappeared until the next volume in all likelihood means that Watari has something big to capitalize on it when she shows up next volume.<br><br>Really, the fact she disappeared is actually good for her. It just sucks to have to wait 6+ months to get the payoff.</br></br></br></br></br>  Yui's VA<br> 結衣の中には「私を置いていかないで」って泣き叫びたいくらいの気持ちは<wbr>きっとあったと思うんですよ。</wbr> <br> それを自分なりに整理して、最終話で穏やかな言葉として発している。 <br> でもそこで雪乃と八幡の通じ合うようなやりとりを目の当たりにするんです<wbr>。</wbr> <br> 分かってはいたんだけど、やっぱり辛いですよね。 </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's runes.</br>  <br>Ouch, not even her VA has faith in her.</br>  <br>Translation?</br>  <br> The fact that she disappeared until the next volume in all likelihood means that Watari has something big to capitalize on it when she shows up next volume. <br>Fucking bullshit<br><br>Watari probably already write a kohai fap fiction called 11.5<br><br>All the spotlight distribution is so fucking unfair, and I'm not even Y&amp;Yfag</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kohai fap fiction called 11.5 <br>I'm okay with that.</br></br>  <br>Nah, his kouhai fap fiction is going to be volume 13.</br>  <br>Reminder, Hikki was playing penguins with her way before Vol. 11<br><br> 90% a coincidence, but hey, one can hope... </br></br></br>  <br>While I appreciate the effort, you gotta remember this is an English image board, anon, and not everyone has taken the time to learn glorious nipponese.</br>  Y'know I am a Yukinofag myself, buuuuutt if you think like rationally, the only way the Club won't break would be Irohaend or nooot????  <br> でもそこで雪乃と八幡の通じ合うようなやりとりを目の当たりにするんです<wbr>。</wbr> <br><br> GT: But where Yukino and I got to witness the exchanges like each other through the Yahata. <br><br>What does she said?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be hilarious if WW really wrote another sidestory for Iroha.<br><br> Too bad that would mean Iroha can't win. </br></br></br>  <br>Iroha poorfag theory 1/3<br><br>Vol 8 ch 2<br> Her uniform looked slightly worn out and she was slightly squeezing the cuffs of her cardigan that was somewhat rugged. <br><br>Vol 9 ch 7 <br> “Is this really oookay? Thank you very much!” (snatches Destinyland tickets) <br><br>Ch 9<br> “And in light of how Hiratsuka-sensei reacted to the acquisition of that budget, it looks like it’ll be difficult. Also, fundraisers are a complete no for me.” <br> “The latter reason is completely self-centered…” <br> Yukinoshita let out an amazed sigh. But look here, Yukinon! Gahama-san and Iroha are both nodding their heads, see! If we were to do a fundraiser, according to my rough mental calculations, at worse we’d need at least 5,000 yen per person… That’s impossible… This amount was something I might’ve been able to procure if I cried to my parents, but if I had to pay for something like this, I might as well use that money to destroy the event in its entirety instead. Besides, there was the possibility that we'd have to raise even more money from here on. <br> With the issue of money finally becoming more realistic, the others in the student council looked at each other. And the one in that group with the most reluctant face was Isshiki. Good grief, this girl was really… <br><br>Ch 10 <br> “But, as I thought, it’s still one dollar and eighty-seven cents. The next day is Christmas too.” <br> I recalled this opening scene from somewhere. <br> Amongst the numerous books that were given to Isshiki from Yukinoshita, the one she chose was called “The Gift of the Magi” <br><br> I tried to throw the tinsels and ornaments away, but I was denied the chance because Isshiki suggested that they might come in handy again in the future. That’s called being a hoarder, you know… </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The other way around, anon. The only way to get Iroha end would be to break the club.</br>  <br>I'm starting to think that the LN was even more damning toward the club than the anime was.<br><br>I doubt Spyro would be so vocally depressed about his ship, as though it's already been sunk, if the anime really conveyed to us how bad things are for them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>8man already remembered her birthday and foreshadow April in v11.<br>We are in the mid of february and each volume seem to be 1month in length in the yahari universe. Coincidence that Yahari is ending in April in v13 or v12?</br></br></br>  <br>Because I don't understand a single thing she's saying, I'll just assume she's cheering on Yui.<br><br>Go Yui<br>ganbare you</br></br></br></br>  Why is anon a cute?

No point discussing anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha poorfag theory 2/3<br><br>Vol 10.5 Ch 1<br> So you know about it, Raiden? Well, Comiket’s been the focus on television and special programs recently, so it wouldn’t be strange to know about its existence. <br> However, Isshiki seemed to have a one-sided understanding of it. <br> “Isn’t it, like, a place where you can make loooads of money?” She asked, leaning slightly forward in keen interest with sparkling eyes.  <br><br> “S-Senpai, pl-please wait a moment.” <br> Isshiki’s voice was trembling when she stopped my hand. <br>“Wh-What’s wrong?” I asked.<br> Going “Mm! Mm!”, Isshiki wagged the tip of her finger and pointed at the screen. <br>“Look at this! Look!”<br> What’s the deal…? I thought. When I looked, she was pointing at a comment made by an employee from a certain publisher. He introduced himself and provided information on his job: the university he graduated from, what his job entailed, an approximate time schedule of one working day a week, and so forth. As I followed the lines one by one, my eyes stopped at one. <br> “A salary of ten million yen at age twenty five…” <br> I sat there trembling in shock and I could hear deep breathing noises from behind. When I turned around, Isshiki placed her left hand to her cheek and showed a sweet and poppy smile. “I’m going to marry a publishing editor.” <br><br> “Well, isn’t having some kind of goal in itself a good thing? I’ve been trying hard everyday towards my goal since a while ago, after all.” <br> “Hoh, a goal…” I gave Isshiki a scrutinizing glance to see what she truly meant when she had uttered something so unlike her. <br> But there, she placed her index finger to her chin and tilted her head. “Of course, I plan on retiring after several years by getting married, you know?” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't need to be a .5 volume at all.<br>Iroha's birthday is coming up and volume 12 could cover up to that, if Watari so chooses.<br>Also,<br> inb4 8man gives Iroha choco back during white day but not to any of the club members because of drama </br></br></br></br>  <br>Poorfag confirmed</br>  <br>Get burned noob</br>  <br>And that makes it worse<br><br>yet another fap garbage where one side get all the drama and another get all the romantic development</br></br></br>  <br>translate note: 5000 yen is around 320 Norwegian krone.

I was really hoping I could put the things from before under our expenses.” <br> “Oh no… That’s not good… Umm, isn’t that, like, really bad?” <br> Isshiki groaned and fell forward on her desk. She slowly turned her head towards me and her eyes were slightly cloudy. Right after, she murmured in a small voice, “The expenses! The discount! The extra charges! Over the budget! The account expenditures!” and shook. <br><br>Vol 11<br> Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making.So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it. <br><br> Idiot, are you kidding, don't underestimate MAX coffee. It's not simply as just adding sugar and condenced milk to it. Stop, for god's sake <br> He got really angry! <br> But that way it will go over budget <br> I don't know how much is she planning to make, but 130 yen for one can is a quite severe amount of money <br><br> Her apron during the event is white without any detail.

That's called chemistry, it's natural and doesn't require one side trying to forcefully make it work somehow.</br></br></br>  <br> sennheiser hd 589  <br>top taste</br></br>  <br>Welcome to the moral of the story.</br>  <br><br><br>Huh, so she really is a poorfag.<br>I guess that explains a big part of her shallow crush on Hayama, who is a filthy rich cunt.<br><br>There's just no fucking way to dislike Iroha anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not her fault <br>I never blame Iroha, but the duality of the storytelling and bias.<br><br>This me speaking as orimotofag, which literally exist as plot device, and I can accept that.

But how Watamote handle the 'Main heroines' seriously fucked up. <br>Fair enough, but ever since the themes of being shallow and fake came up at the field trip, double YY and 8man just couldn't keep their shit together.<br>It's not that it's purposefully bias or anything, but it does look like it is sometimes.<br><br> And? the chemistry that exist in early volumes between 8man and Y&amp;Y was GONE because Watari can't be arsed to make a proper balance for everything. <br>Their chemistry is gone because the girls started wanting something that would break the club's balance, and because of that they started to pretend that it wasn't there and 8man went along with it.<br><br>Hell, even 8man himself realized that the way things are going in the club won't allow a happy ending. But if that's what it takes for him to find what he wants, then so be it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So now it's pretty much confirmed that Iroha is in fact a poorfag. Let us speculate why did Watari made that setting? Too complicated for a side character that appear too late in the story. It's maybe more understandable if he changed his intention in later novel and added more details in later novel, but since the hint appear as soon as volume 8, I think he was planning something.  <br><br><br>I'm starting to think Watari's intention is to write her almost entirely out of subtext.<br><br>In that case even if she wins a big ending for her is unlikely. Even if she wins it'll just be a really light confirmation (holding hands in the epilogue) or no confirmation and all with strong implying implications.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy fallacy.</br>  <br>Can't really say anything because we're already done with volume 11.<br>But she and 8man do share some things, both of them dislike working and want to find a good partner that will allow them to stay home all day, yet both of them can and do handle work surprisingly well.</br></br>  <br>"Not all suffering is genuine"<br>"The service club is suffering"<br>"it must not be genuine"<br><br>literally textbook.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But how Watamote handle the 'Main heroines' seriously fucked up. <br>I don't see plotholes or thematic inconsistencies, on what grounds can you call it fucked up? There's no law of fiction that states heroines must be used in the most orthodox fashion possible.<br><br> And? the chemistry that exist in early volumes between 8man and Y&amp;Y <br>What chemistry? If they had good chemistry they wouldn't be in this mess to begin with, plain and simple.<br><br>The club situation is purely the result of incompatibilities in their personalities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice strawman. I never implied anything but the first.</br>  Irohasu~  Reminder for all Yukinofags that there are far more superior version of Yukino  <br>It probably ties in with the final moral of the story.<br><br>8man has a dramatic relationship with the club and cares about them, but he also has friends/family he cares about without the drama.<br><br>Iroha's basically one of the latter in the form of a love interest.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correction: I never implied anything but the first two.</br>  <br> complex emotions and character development </br>  <br>Why do you keep doing this to me?</br>  <br> commie </br>  <br>the third is the obvious implication of claiming "you can't call something genuine just because it makes you suffer" to be the moral of the story. Now you're just pretending it wasn't because I called your bullshit.</br>  <br>the third is wrong in the first place<br>you should stop typing and move on</br></br>  <br>Yes the third statement is wrong, thank you for agreeing with my original point.</br>  <br> Her apron during the event is white without any detail. Looks plain and cheap (even though she looks hella cute) <br>Forgot to say that this one was just my personal opinion, haven't read the translated text about that choco making scene yet</br></br>  <br>Wrong. The obvious implication is "the club may not be genuine".<br><br>Making a strawman isn't calling anyone out on anything. It just shows you don't have a position, so you have to make up one to argue against.</br></br></br>  <br>To clarify: The implication of sensei's statement is "the club may not be genuine".<br><br>I believe the club isn't genuine, and that's going to be the moral, however I have never claimed that it's -because- they're suffering that the club isn't genuine.<br><br>It's the opposite really, the club's non-genuineness is what's causing a lot of their suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>splitting hairs between "is" and "may not be" means nothing when the only way to bear out your supposed "moral" is for the club to prove not genuine.</br>  <br>The club already proved that it's not genuine in volume 11, in case you haven't noticed.</br>  <br>The club isn't genuine at all.<br>Look at double Y, they arent acting naturally at all.<br>All of them are wrecking their head trying to be "genuine" just so they can impress 8man and fit his genuine ideal.<br><br>They are a bunch of fakers.</br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>if she's so poor why does she waste her money buying bags of snacks each day</br>  <br>It's not that they're trying to impress him, more that they feel so inferior that they can't do anything without him backing it.<br><br>The club's problems are deeply entrenched in the fact that all three members have serious social issues.</br></br></br>  <br>Written off as StuCo expenses.<br>So she's not wasting her money at all.</br></br>  <br>StuCo money for the christmas event.</br>  <br><br>ah ok, I stand corrected</br></br>  <br>While I dont buy the samefag poorfag posts, those were expensed most likely. Not many students are buying $10+ worth of snacks and drinks every day for meetings. <br> <br>Shes pretty much the younger version of Miura - dresses stylish, makeup, lipgloss, etc. Her date and destinyland clothes are clearly stylish and expensive.</br></br></br>  Why do people consider a relationship with Hachiman end game in this series? He's fucking awful.  <br>most people don't realize that the real bowl is the komachi-bowl<br>whoever gets 8man gets her in the end</br></br>  <br>Because he's the MC of a romcom.<br>Although, the romcom part is only being kept alive by one character.</br></br>  Here's a list of all interesting Iroha vids on Nico.<br>For those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother to.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW<br>Enjoyhasu~</br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Dr いろはす is fucking good</br>  Hachiman, like most harem MCs, is not really a good catch, but what can you do?

Only inertia is keeping me coming to these threads I think.<br><br>I'm more convinced than ever of a friendship end with no one getting Hachiman. And where's the fun in that?

From the anime, everybody else were wearing colorful aprons with stamping, while hers was just plain white</br>  <br>Oh just fuck off. It's haremshit and she has interest in another guy. She's shit and should have her skin peeled off in sections.</br>  <br><br>Her sluttyness is part of her appeal, for me.</br></br>  <br>Anon, you ever watched a soap opera? They're full of murder, amnesia, pregnancies, incestual adultery and other crazy garbage. Any show that deals primarily with relationships isn't a fucking soap.</br>  Does Yui's friends (Yumiko and Ebina) support Hachiman x Yui?  <br>No, I mean I believe in friendship end. Whether one of Y won, Iroha won whatever, or even loner end.<br><br>They CAN rebuild broken ties, that's the whole message of this clusterfuck. Just because you fuck up doesn't mean you can't start over, that's what it meant to be youth.<br><br>  inb4 8man rant about youth being not genuine <br>He's changing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Ebina probably.<br>Yumiko no, she knows she's going to end up getting hurt.</br></br>  <br> I'm more convinced than ever of a friendship end with no one getting Hachiman <br>Friendsip is shit, love is all.</br></br>  <br>Miura probably does. She seemed extremely nonchalant about it when mentioning it in Kyoto, and her opinion of 8man has only improved since then.</br>  <br> 35 <br>Name of the song/artist?</br></br>  <br> I'm Canadian <br>My condolences</br></br>  <br>Are you Canadian too?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah. Things get bad but then you repair and restore your relationships. No one really thought there wouldn't be drama on the way. But they were always going to end the series as friends.<br><br>But if that's all we get, this whole thing was a giant waste of time. To have an outcome consisting only of what we already knew. The sweet words aren't enough.<br><br>Some HAS to end up with Hachiman. I don't particularly care who. Even Iroha whom I utterly despise. I would take an Iroha end over friendship only.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The truth about the Hayamakiller. </br>  <br>Hard to tell with Miura. She seems to reject the diea that Yui could actually like 8man. But that was when she didn't really like 8man aherself, he seems to have grown on her so she'd probably be more accepting of it now<br><br>Ebina would start lamenting the death of HayaHachi but you'd know that deep down she was happy for Yui</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>Yumiko? Not really.  She wants the 8 for herself </br>  <br>I honestly wouldn't worry about it. People who think friendship end will happen forget the central conciet that to be genuine you have to be willing to hurt the people you love. "Just friends" means all three main characters are still refusing to act on their own feelings because they're afraid to hurt each other.<br><br>If they really are genuine about how they feel, 8man will pick one of the girls, the other will accept that, and the three of them will carry on because their friendship does mean more to them than 8man's dick.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I don't know.<br>Scoured over the description, comments, and video and no mention of it.<br>But at least by reading the description I found out that the creator of the video is an Irohafag.<br> Irohasu was especially cute </br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, we still don't really know the exact nature of 8man's feelings. Obviously there's SOME level of romantic attraction, we wouldn't be getting all this spaghetti drama if he didn't like either of them. But that doesn't necessarily mean he'd actually be interested in a relationship with either of them. Or maybe it'll turn out that his feelings for Yukino weren't "genuine" after all (though that would be pretty dumb honestly)<br><br>I agree that romance end is most likely at this point, but he could still reject both of them and not have it be an asspull. If he does, though, it's going to be because he actually doesn't want a relationship, not him choosing not to act on his feelings to try and preserve their friendship. If it came down to that I think he'd actually rather just end up a loner again.</br></br></br>  left one is going to suck on your dick and call you cute and fun<br><br>right one is going to step on your dick and call you creep and pervert<br><br>left or right /a/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I choose to be in the center</br>  <br><br>Can I get right to do what left's doing?<br><br>She can do what she was going to do after that I don't mind.</br></br></br></br>  How did that turn out? Should I watch this if I'm depressed?  <br><br>S2 is not the best season to watch if you're depressed. S1 has its moments though.</br></br>  Dumping some Isshiki<br><br>1/6</br></br>  <br> If you think about all the efforts for the sake of making Hayama eat chocolate, this dedication is quite admirable.  <br> Well, if you dismiss that dark scheming about low price of obligated chocolate, apron on top of uniform gives it's effect.  <br> One can see how that schemes mysteriously turn into amusing effort. <br> Heed my words.  <br> Apron on top of uniform &gt; naked apron! <br> But Komachi in apron on top of sleeveless shorts is just the best. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2/6</br>  <br>What the actual fuck.<br>Are those the translations ?<br><br>How the fuck does he make those connections in his mind? Just fuck already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't got the girl? Will there a third season?</br>  <br>Pretty sure "not wanting a relationship" is still pretty far outside the realm of possibility, even if it's not nearly as ridiculous as "we'd rather not risk our friendships for love."<br><br>The only reason he's avoided a relationship thus far is because he's afraid of misreading girls' intentions and getting hurt like he did in middle school. Once you get 8man past that, he's got no other discernible reason to not end up with Yukino or Yui.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah. It's no way Yukinon would suck on your dick - even after marriage. She would call it smelly and creepy.</br>  <br> There are people who expected 8man to end up with someone in S2 </br>  <br> He didn't got the girl?  <br>No, it's worse<br> Will there a third season? <br>Possible, but still uncertain. OVA is more likely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>doll Yukino would.</br></br>  <br> doll Yukino <br>literally who?</br></br>  <br><br>vol. 11 Yukino</br></br>  <br>Most likely not since the LN is in its last stretch. There might be an OVA or movie or something to cover however many volumes are left.<br><br>The ending isn't super bleak or anything, but it does end on a cliffhanger and the characters aren't in the best place they could be</br></br></br>  <br> No, it's worse <br>I probably won't watch it. Please write under the spoiler how it ended.</br></br>  <br>Everytime he mentions Komachi, he's just digging deeper his own grave. Just stop being a tsundere and pin her down already 8man</br>  When is the MUH GENUINE arc gona end?  <br>If Watari can shit out 4 drama filled volumes within two years possibly, aside from that no.</br>  <br>TLDR:  The girls acknowledge that they both want the 8inch and stop beating around the bush, and he told them to be honest even if it will break their bonds and hurt someone. </br>  <br>It's just begun.</br>  <br><br>It's not resolved whether or who he ends up with. A S3 is really improbable.<br><br>S2 just has a lot of drama. It's basically shed being a comedy outside of a few moments here and there.<br><br>Typically when I'm feeling depressed I prefer to watch something a lot more light-hearted, such as Haganai (most of Haganai at least, it has its heavy moments too, especially in S2). You might be different though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If his editor can make him work and doesn't let him slack off <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br>Well, now that I think about it, I can't really blame him.

In Madoka, character's got the salvation of death, some pretty early, and therefore can't be subjugated to more suffering, but the Yusha's had to live on, each suffering for themselves and eachother.
