About to pick something else at random to read from translation lists.</br>  I've been reading that Death March webnovel.  <br><br> Worm <br>I couldn't get past how stupid the main character was and dropped it like 30 chapters in. I figured I'd enjoy it too since Sheeprabbit recommended it.</br></br></br>  <br> Hachi-nan <br><br>Literally never heard of this being mentioned on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> Zaregoto.  <br>Fuck that MC, fuck him. Holy shit he really should just fucking die. Fucking shit.<br> Bravo nisio, bravo. </br></br></br>  <br>Translation pace for that has been amazing.</br>  <br> lolis everywhere <br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>drama? its asuper hero story, with a female protagonist and some cool powers, pretty long and its already finished, rate 8.2/10</br>  <br>Really? I thought it was ok, though I've heard it gets kind of ridiculous later.</br>  Altina 8, 9 and Guns and Magic. <br><br>What a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>Glad im not the only one who thinks this. It just got so boring after the timeskip and him arriving in xaos</br>  <br>How is it self insert when MC doesn't give a shit about lolis even though he attracts lolis all the time.<br><br>Pisses me the fuck off. Fuck the author.<br><br>Don't make a loli story and then have an anti lolicon MC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Death March has more lolis I think. MC pretty much adds one or two lolis to his harem every town he visits while keeping around 4 lolis in his main party.</br>  mahouka vol.12<br><br>because ONII-SAMA</br></br>  <br>wtf is wrong with this guy, is he a high grade loli magnet?</br>  <br> Suzuki, an adult programmer, suddenly notice that he's thrown into another world wearing a casual clothes at level 1. He gained high level and treasures after using the 3-times-disposable-magic, Meteor Shower, once. After that he intend to do another world "sightseeing tours"? <br><br>What the hell does this mean?</br></br></br>  <br>The loli on his lap looks like best girl.</br>  <br>Wordmaster also gets 1 or 2 loli every place he goes. A couple of them are actually lolihags though.</br>  <br>You know what they say, if you see one guy and a fuckton of girls, it means either he's queer or you're getting cucked.</br>  <br>Mia is pretty good. <br><br><br>His  childhood friend / previous life's wife that's a goddess cursed him to attract flat chests.  </br></br></br></br>  <br>It takes place in a world with video game stats. The world gave him a title that makes loli attracted to him.</br>  <br>Really? I read word master up to like chapter 80 and there was only like 2 lolis that were interested in him.</br>  The new gate and Tsuyokute: new saga.<br>Starting Owari no Chronicle because I have a lot of time this month.</br>  <br>Been keeping up with a few random stories on aho-updates listings, but I haven't really been wowed by anything recently.<br><br>I did recently read all that was translated of the Zashiki Warashiki of Intellectual Village. While it has a neat setting, I kind of find the characters flat and the dialogue atrocious. Every single fucking villain monologues their entire fucking plan or how their power works near constantly. I get that with such an intricate setting immersed in old mythology you need to explain some shit, but it's handled so horribly.<br><br>Though it was interesting enough for me to read through all five translated volumes at least.<br><br><br>Worm has its ups and its downs, but it has some of the best use of superpowers I've ever seen in fiction. And the climax of the story is one of the few things I would describe with the word epic despite that word's extreme overuse.<br><br>It is incredibly long so it takes quite a while to get to that payoff though. Also due to being a superhero series, there are a lot of fucking characters. And those are hard to remember and keep track of in such an extremely long story, but surprisingly it manages it well though I guess that's one of the reasons it's so damn long. It's also not shy about killing characters off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The important question is whether he hooks up with the loli or not.<br>Oda Nobuna is probably the worst in that aspect (pervert protag, yet disgusted by lolis), but Black Bullet has the old hag childhood friend winning too.</br></br>  Since an anime is basically confirmed at this point, might as well read up to bitch about secondaries in the threads<br>:^)</br>  <br>Does he have his Lolislayer title yet? I think he starts to pick up more of them after that.</br>  <br>Dude wakes up at level one, realizes he has a spell he can cast three times, and then decides to treat everything as a vacation.</br>  Is the an epub for Death Match besides vol 1?  I've started to read Elvenblood. It's up on the same site of Anti Magic. Overall, it has very high edge content and the story seems pretty predictable right now. On the other hand, it's about killing elves so it's okay.  <br>why /a/ hates elves?</br>  <br> Lolis Bath <br>How amazing that feel ?</br></br>  Anyone read Close Combat Mage? It's fun, but I can't help but think the author totally fucked up after revealing MC can basically bloodbend.  As I Lay Dying and some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories.  <br><br>Funnily enough, while he attracts lolis all the time, he really likes older girls with big tits. <br><br>The hero of the country that Arisa talks about attracts the type of girls the MC likes, while the hero himself likes lolis but only gets women with big tits in his harem.<br><br>They're both cursed to get the opposite of what they want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Chapter 45 of Tensei Shitara Slime translation just came out.<br><br>Wow Rimuru is about to get a large number of guests to his city.</br></br>  <br>Aren't there like 3 different groups translating this or something?</br>  <br>Not anymore. One group translated 4 chapters, another group translated from there until like chapter 12, then someone else picked it up from there until 18. Clown picked it up and has done up to chapter 45. <br><br>I think there might be another group doing the LN version but they're only at around chapter 10 of the WN storywise.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to AntiMagic's release schedule.<br><br>The author seemed fast at release volumes before.<br><br>Now we are left with an annoying cliffhanger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he really likes older girls with big tits. <br>Thanks for protecting me from reading it. Time to stop the dl.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate how I have to go to three websites with horrendous designs to read this shit</br>  <br>Yeah, I almost dropped it. I don't understand why they can't just put it on that mainsite.</br>  <br>which ones are you talking about w the one with the lolis fanfiction or the black one?</br>  <br><br>You're going to stop reading it because of a preference? At least give it a try, he destined to live a flat chested life for the most part.<br><br>I say for the most part because he's completely smitten by the queen of elves and in future spends a lot of time courting her because he really does love her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Yeah, it's pretty bad going through those sites but what can we fucking do about it? <br><br>The worst one is the one with the loli dialogue every chapter, it's pretty horrifying what insanity can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're going to stop reading it because of a preference? <br>No, I'm not going to stop, I just protect myself from starting it and face inevitable disappointment and anger.</br></br>  <br>New volume just came out a few months while ago. It takes time for new volumes to come out you know.</br>  <br>Currently waiting on Baccano's only untranslated volume so far that just happens to be right in the middle of the novels.<br>Also waiting on Korean Zombie volume 5 .pdf.</br></br>  <br> Baccano's only untranslated volume so far <br><br>Didn't all fantranslations just die from the license?</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the main woman he likes is a mature elven queen, it's not like he's going to drown lolis forever.</br></br>  <br>Translator updated it this month, so no. He said he might as well complete it since there's only a chapter and half left and then the entire series so far will be fully translated.</br>  <br>I don't mind the loli rambles, I just ignore them.<br><br>I'm just mainly annoyed that there's a main site that seems to serve no purpose except redirect to three other sites. It's a pain.<br><br>Also, I can't believe people voting for that one poll with translating dialogue options. How did natural dialogue translations score the lowest number of votes?<br>Do people really need their handheld to determine who said what?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what you don't understand here, so I'll say it.<br>I don't want a protag who doesn't like lolis, shames lolis, and ends up with a fucking old hag.</br></br>  <br> protag who doesn't like lolis, shames lolis, <br><br>But he doesn't hate them, rather he's fond of them and works hard to stop himself from spoiling them everyday.<br><br>The only loli that gets scolded is Arisa because she's often trying to seduce him and tease him. And she's  reincarnated so she's like 30-something inside in the body of a loli. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stick with Wordmaster.<br><br> 《Little Girl Killer》 <br> You seem to be an existence that are blessed by, and attracts, little girls. In the eyes of little girls, your charm has suddenly increased. This is surely because you are also a Loli-- </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What else can we do, we are at 155/700 chapters if you want to drop it then godspeed anon, because from what I hear it's just him becoming more and more broken and beating shit up, eating until the ending where he fights a big bad and  dies, but comes back in the end to reunite with the rest of the cast. No one won the wordbowl. </br></br>  <br>That's not really different than Death March though, Hiiro is not attracted to any of the lolis he runs into. He doesn't end up with one either. At least Satou is nice to the lolis plus he's pretty much destined to end up with multiple wives at this point anyway.</br>  <br>how the fuck did he manage to lose having such a game breaking cheat hability?</br>  <br><br>As his fame grows more and more nobles chuck their daughters at him, but he always gets away before getting chained up. Queen of Elves or bust for Satou.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not reading something where lolis are not taken seriously. That is all. Already deleted.</br></br>  <br>That's my boy.</br>  <br>He'll most likely get Elf Queen, but Arisa, Lulu, and childhood friend girl(fuck can't remember her name at the moment) will probably get in on it too.</br>  <br>Almost banner-tier</br>  <br>Wait what? <br><br>At what volume and chapter do they mention this? <br>Also,  does the childhood friend join him in his travels? </br></br></br></br>  <br>GODDAMIT</br>  <br><br>The only time she shows up so far is in the  flashback chapter about the shrine-maiden. She's the one that gave him the 3 powers when he was transported to the world the novel takes place in. </br></br>  <br>It's one of the intermission chapters that was already translated.  Yes Childhood friend girl joins the party later, she's actually the Hero Yamato that founded the empire or whatever. She originally was going to go back to her world but found out Satou was going to get summoned here in the future through some kind of oracle so instead she entered basically hibernation for 500 years to wait for him. <br><br>It's not her Goddess self though, just normal Satou childhood friend.</br></br> </br>  <br>http://www.sousetsuka.com/2015/06/d<wbr>eath-march-kara-hajimaru-isekai_22.<wbr>html<br><br> "Fuhn nanoja, I hate Satou. I'll put a curse so you'll always be with flat-chests for all your life."</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  Thinking of reading Combat Continent because I had nothing more to read and every fag keeps complaining about the manhua adaptation.<br><br>Also Rokka no Yuusha, but I don't know if I want to spoil myself while the anime is airing, and I don't have enough motivation to start Antimagic Academy, right now.</br></br>  <br> Antimagic Academy <br>Isn't this getting an anime anyways?</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, forgot about those chapters. Kinda just skipped over them, thanks. <br><br> God bless I love childhood friends, thanks. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's going to be a bad one though, 9 volumes in 2 cour.</br>  <br>It's confirmed they're going to adapt 9 volumes?</br>  <br>Apparently so, I was cautiously optimistic about the anime too.</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei<br><br> MC marries 3 girls <br> All of them are perfect waifus (Eris &amp; Roxy are best though) <br><br>  <br>Just finished Shieldbro, seems my taste isn't that bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  After going through Death March, I finally decided to dive into mondaiji-tachi. Reading elvenblood as well, but I instantly go through them whenever kry releases, so mondaiji will have to do. <br><br>Got mahouka on my backlog, but got sao before that. Though after going through the first half of V12, I got really reluctant to go further so kinda put it on hold there.</br></br>  <br><br><br> Antimagic Academy <br><br>I will physically harm you two if you decide that watching the potentially disastrous adaptation is a good choice. Go read the novels, they been translated up to the current volume.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read </br>  <br><br>Drop SAO after volume 2. You're welcome.</br></br>  <br>Pick up Progressive, both LN and manga versions.</br>  Kansutoppu is pretty fun so far. It's kind of like One-Punch Man with her pulping everything.  <br>Too bad "the lazy 9" aptly deserves their name.</br>  I wish some other group would pick up Magi's Grandson, I really liked how that one was going.  <br>Ryua-chan a cute!</br>  <br> Someone said it gets kind of serious and people start dying everywhere. </br>  Translation never ;_;  <br> I will physically harm you two if you decide that watching the potentially disastrous adaptation is a good choice. Go read the novels, they been translated up to the current volume. <br>In all honestly i think i read the first novel and it was kind of stupid with swords &gt;guns. But i keep hearing it gets boring and sucks in the middle and it being god tier later in the series. Should i hunker down and read through it?</br></br>  <br> swords&gt;guns <br>That's really not in the first volume at all, did you even fucking read it?</br></br>  <br>I read this like years ago man, last thing i remember reading was the guy using a sword or something when the school was being attacked and some magic shit happened with the sword</br>  <br>Did the translators of this ever stop being massive faggots? Because I remember most of them being massive cunts.</br>  <br>It's the best superhero story I've read if you can get past the early bullying and edginess.<br><br>The author is completely clueless when it comes to real world weapons and politics though.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not so light hearted novel.<br><br>Lots of death at the end and MC keep going down the hill with no brake.<br><br>Still it's a good enough read.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy just keeps getting cockblocked by those lolis. I gotta feel for him.</br>  <br>I bet this fucking idiot has a script or something that searches for every mention of the word "loli" just to shit up threads.</br>   see Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? releases on Baka <br> 35 chapters translated? Looks interesting <br> "My English is not that good actually and I can't read Japanese. Learned my Japanese through animes only so don't expect much." <br><br>Why do these people exist?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hachi-nan <br><br>I used to read it but it's kinda too forceful to me. <br><br>Meet a rare undead dragon? No problem, just blast him with light magic and be done with it.<br><br>I also hate the way the author keep recap everything that has happened. And the magic system is a mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe they do this with the hopes of improving their skills, and they say this just to warn people.</br>  <br> 1 chapter a month <br><br>Well, the binge was nice while it lasted.</br></br></br>  <br> 1 chapter a month <br>You are going to wish it was that good.</br></br>  <br><br>Alyschu, the group who's doing the manga, is also doing the LN. They're only on the first volume of the LN though.

Like Muv Luv Alternative is better than Myv Luv Unlimited. <br><br><br>The guy literally cuts bullets and has an anomalous magical weapon that is a sword and named after Norse and is better than all the other magical weapons which are guns and are named after tyrants (Stalin magical heritage where? )</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japtem has pretty much dropped off the radar.<br>In the last month, they've only released chapters for Shadow Rogue, even though Magi's Grandson is their most liked story at the moment, apparently.<br>It's funny how all their translators are apparently too busy to do anymore, but then they go and announce they'll be doing manhua.</br></br></br>  <br>They're not something that should be spoiled.<br><br>Like I can think of a few fantastic examples, but they're all massive spoilers as well.</br></br></br>  Why are the magic systems in WNs and LNs always so oriented and ranked in terms of their combat utility? Magic artifacts and tools may have practical everyday use but magic cast by people is always about making bigger fireballs or rain of ice shards. <br><br>Surely there are more productive uses for having phenomenal cosmic force at your fingertips. Like in Mickey Mouse in the Magician's Apprentice or in Harry Potter when it's used to make housework easier. Or in Lord of the Rings when Gandalf uses it to make pretty fireworks.</br></br>  <br>Cause the ones you're talking about are based on MMORPGs.<br><br>If you read Mushoku Tensei, there's a ton of utility magic and it's a lot more flexible. It's just about how creative and imaginative you are when it comes to devising new spells.<br><br>But when you're talking about shit based off vidya games? Really? What vidya game do you know has a spell that heats up water for the bath while you take a shit next door?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are the magic systems in WNs and LNs always so oriented and ranked in terms of their combat utility? <br>Because the story centers around the kind of people who use magic in combat, rather than utility.<br>For some reason, the authors rarely think about adapting that kind of magic outside of combat.<br><br>"So what if it's an RPG World?" is a WN that focuses more on combat, but at the same time the author makes a point about how magic has tons of other applications, like Air-ships and advancing technology.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's the magic system dilemma. You want a magic system, what will you chose?<br>For a lack of better terms, the RPG system or traditional Witches and Wizards.<br>The RPG system works incredibly well for combat. Elements, circles, runes that can be manipulated and formed into attacks. Its really easy to build upon it and explain how stuff works or is made. Because of its "modularity" it can be expanded in many ways.<br><br>Witches and Wizards on the other hand is all about the mystic. Recite a spell and an action happens. How it happens is not explained. Could be gravity could be any kind of elementary force. It isnt explained at that is this kind of magic's charm.<br><br>You could add gravity or force in the RPG system as elements but then it would degrade into a physics textbook as you find ways to abuse it, not so much shounen now.<br>I could go on but i think this is enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei <br>the only magic I remember is Water Ball, Rainstorm, Earth Bullet, Swamp, Frost Nova, Thunderbolt, Thermonuclear explosion, gravity magic, and that magic cancel spell that I think Magonote forgot all about. Also some healing magics and some barrier stuff we never see. None of these have any place in activities of daily living besides healing. I guess you could argue water ball plus wind could be used for washing and drying clothes but why waste mana when you could just wash them in a basin and dry them in the wind?</br></br>  I've been reading Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o again since skythewood started translating the third volume, hope he'll pick up the fourth soon. <br><br>Other than that Im reading Hikaru and Rokka no Yuusha while waiting for someone to start translating my guilty pleasure  Hidan no Aria  I know  again.</br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of Mushoku Tensei, I still find myself wondering what exactly you do in magic university. We're given to believe that magic for the vast majority simply requires you to memorize and recite the incantation and this acts like a macro to automate the process of activating a certain set magic routine. And more complex and forceful magics have longer incantations. But nobody understands magic from first principles since nobody knows how to use it unvocalized, and nobody is inventing new spells, and thus all magic is basically empirical. Thus, how could a course at magic university last for five years (or however many years it was)? How much could there possibly be to study, and what could you possibly write your thesis on?</br></br>  <br>You can warm up water with fire magic, water your plants, or produce new soil for it.<br><br>That said, because normal people can't use voiceless, and because magic circles are expensive, using spells is just kinda stiff unless you can be creative in application. Because MT magic is more grounded and is based within several systems and categories, Harry Potter's "self cleaning dishes" wouldn't be possible.<br>On the other hand, most other things are still possible, like how Zanoba created living dolls (or rather, androids?) and that could be used to basically take care of any and all house work.</br></br></br></br>  Best girl or just a useless drunk goddess?  <br>That's a pretty good point—I never thought about it.<br>You clearly have control over the spell after using it, but what then? It's never clear how much control you have over a spell after casting it, and what you'd have to learn to gain better control.<br>Nanahoshi basically said that people in that world don't really work on creating new magic circles, and the same probably applies to voiced spells—and then you have to wonder how they learned those spells to begin with (I know they said they got it from the Elves, but they never explained it)<br><br>It sorta just feels like a plot-hole now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is there anyone know the name of this LN? It's about a guy who is a chuuninbyou neet and then he got hit by a truck and died. And then he reincarnated into a village girl in a fantasy world and she vow to stop being a chuunin and live a normal life. Until she heard that her little sister claimed herself as one of the Demon's General.  <br>I haven't read it myself, but sounds like Tilea's Worries<br>https://oniichanyamete.wordpress.co<wbr>m/index/tileas-worries/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes, that LN. Thanks, m8.</br>  Too lazy to update my list.<br>Right now I recently found Bungaku Shoujo online so I'm reading that.</br>  <br> super self-insert <br>He's heartless as fuck, maybe some apathetic faggots on /a/ can insert into him, I can't.

Read a few (or just one) chapters of it and it seemed pretty good, the writer really got his shit together in them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention they translate like ass and one of them is an obnoxious faggot.</br>  <br> I think that's her name <br>It's almost impossible to forget her name.

But he won't do anything unless there's some value in it most of the time(which is smart since it prevents him from being used easily). If he's feeling generous he'll give them a hint.</br>  <br>Funny how he is considering making himself immortal or have a very high lifespan yet he doesn't think of giving himself perfect eyesight so that he doesn't even need to wear glasses anymore.</br>  <br>He's *nearly heartless regardless. I admit that there's some moment when he show compassion for his companion, but he still retain his holier-than-thou attitude which is a big turn off. Otherwise, most of the time he just act like a dick.<br> won't do anything unless there's some value in it most of the time <br>You should check out his value system.<br> If he's feeling generous he'll give them a hint <br>And while you're at it, check out when he feel generous as well.

Hell, in general, little kids seems to like him a lot. He's kinda like that older brother that always says harsh things but is clearly looking out for you in his smug way.

The author has done a good job of making it hard to tell who will win. The translation goes to shit whenever setting exposition begins, so trying making sense of the plot gets annoying, though.</br>  <br>im reading about a story of a guy who was hired to livd in another worlf for 20 years and on his first weeks he got his ass beaten by rabbits in a struggle and then spend a week of spartan training to have revenge on just fucking rabbits.</br>  <br>Same key visual but in higher res</br>  <br>Been reading magicraft meister<br><br>just love crafting SOL type stories</br></br></br>  Im reading something about the MC is the side character and his best friend is the Hero of his own story and gets harem while the MC side character is the bro wingman<br><br>pretty much reverse roles</br></br>  I'm recently been reading Mondaiji-tachi and Campione. Mondaiji has way too much filler but otherwise it's okay. Campione is the worst thing I've ever read.  I don't know how you fags can read anti magic, it's fucking unreadable.<br>Or is there a better translation somewhere?</br>  <br> I first want to complete the main story <br><br>Once you've finished volume 8, you're good to go to Progressive.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, love to read this and Death March for how chill the MCs are and how comfy everything is</br>  <br>I wish Liza got a bit more emphasis.</br>  Gibson's a fantastic writer, no matter what genre he works in.  <br>Volume 2, chapter 16 is the last one translated, right?</br>  <br>At this point I can only see it as a sol story(Close Combat Cosmetician amirite) except for the animal abuse<br><br>Even the blood bend thing was discarted as unpractical compared to using the other spells</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12816483 <br>Me too, her LOYALTY is very good but I would also like for her to develop more</br>  I guess no one is doing Tokage no Ou, right?  <br>Hahahaha, no.</br>   Reading <br> Getting pleasure from non-visual medium <br><br>I wish I was as simple as you.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that backwards?</br>  <br>I need more stimulation to my brain to enjoy something so pictures, voice acting and so on.<br><br>While people who enjoy reading can get much more out of only words.<br><br>What's backwards?</br></br></br></br></br>  Spoiling myself the last Misumarca volume without reading the other ones, and pretty much enjoyed it, even though it seems the manga ending was different.<br><br> If I got it right, MC was betrayed, and is now in hands of the Empire. Nonetheless, he seems used to deal with Empire' stuff now. <br><br>Thinking of reading it whole because I'm Princess Lunas fag<br><br><br>I think so, too. But after reading Shiro Koukoku and seeing how in less than 12 volumes the MC pretty much gets like 10 or more wives, I think Rudeus' harem is not that best  even though I'm Eris and Roxy fag myself <br><br><br>You can do you a favor and drop it now. It only gets worse.<br><br><br>Isn't it Isekai mahou- something? I think that's one with the MC being the side character supporting a hero, and being bros.<br><br>It's also one with the King not being an idiot or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Chrome Shelled Regios <br>When I see that name I can only remember that doujin by Maruta. Holy shit it was good.</br></br>    <br>Having 10 wives is a bit much for my taste, I think 2 - 4 is the best amount, just imagine 10 women living in the same house with 1 man, the amount of bitchfights would drive you insane<br><br>Also why is there no Roxy and Eris r34 stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Translation of the 2nd volume never because the translator is also doing another LN.<br><br>Why are they taking a lot of projects instead of sticking with only one and finishing it?<br>Even worse for those doing WN translation, they are a fuck ton of chapters to translate, yet they are taking more webnovel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hachi-nan MC married 5 girls in the same ceremony. After that he acquired two other fiances and also has a few mistresses on the side.</br>    <br>Why is this artist so gud</br>  <br>I just read the raws.

It killed him and all those close to him.MC takes in his brother 's wife, has his first time with her (as according to tradition where lil bros fuck their older bros wives to know how sex works) and decided to keep her as a waifu/concubine  </br>  <br>Worm's a fairly dark superhero story. Overall great, but has it's ups and downs. Beginning's kind of shitty, but it's long as hell and actually completed.</br>  Currently reading Hello Work<br><br>I like it so far<br><br>fucking MC got his ass beaten by rabbits that he spartan train for one week so he can get revenge on the goddamn rabbits</br></br></br></br>  Worm is this one?<br>https://parahumans.wordpress.com/ta<wbr>ble-of-contents/</wbr></br>  <br>krytyk caught up. He's waiting for the next volume to be released, he'll be translating Elvenblood in the mean time.</br>  <br>Yes, also keep in mind it's huge and takes a bit to get going. I think it was stated to be 1.65 million words. You'll also have to mind some teenage drama, but then that goes away and it becomes drama about the meaning of what a hero is and what being a hero should be.<br><br>The scale also only ever really keeps increasing.</br></br></br>  <br>Looking at the About page, it seems like it. Kinda surprised it was a gaijin series since this was mostly a LN discussion thread but seems interesting nonetheless. Just going to be no Japanese tropes we're accustomed to</br>  <br>Think i will directly skip it, not really fond of this superhero books or comics. Hated even the one Sanderson wrote.</br>  <br>Really not as bad as it could be. I'm cautiously optimistic but I'll probably be disappointed. It should be treated like an action show with lulls but it'll probably be treated like a harem romcom with action like every other LN adaptation.</br>  Read regarding slime tensei<br><br> dat chapter 39 <br>god damn I fucking love the MC</br></br></br>  <br>Lot of people wanted more girls in the Mc's harems<br><br>but I would've been mad if they did.</br></br></br>  <br> The author is completely clueless when it comes to real world weapons and politics though. <br>Even the superhero politics outside Brockton Bay fell kind of flat. It was if that city was the center of the universe and everything else didn't really matter.</br></br>  Some really nice english stories are :<br>Mother of Learning<br>A hero's War<br>Lair (royal road)<br>Dungeon without a name (royal road)<br>This onii-chan got summoned to adifferent world (royal road, not as good as the earlier mentioned ones but good enough to spend time if you want a laugh)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japtem was the best when they were translating LMS and Arc really quickly. They slowed down their release schedule so much though that others basically took over all that and they kind of just fell of the radar.</br>  <br> all the girls MC finds throughout the story  <br>   proposes to girl that just appears <br><br>goddammit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which brother tried to kill him?</br>  <br>Mother of Learning and Worm are the 2 English series I see here recommended occasionally.<br><br>Having read both I can say it's deserved. Though how they even came into notice here is hard to figure or say.<br><br><br>Hard to disagree with. It's something very prevalent in the entire genre. Trying to manage political depth in more than one city full of superheroes isn't something I think any superhero series has properly managed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically he's a psychopath.</br>  <br>The eldest one , the one who gets the territory where MC is born.I think 2 other brothers were involved too.</br>  <br>Try these ones too </br>  Reading Long Live Summons and now I'm waiting for a new chapter <br><br>I wish there was other Xianxia series with a similar MC</br></br>  <br>What is this</br>  <br>That's Marisa.</br>  <br> Slime Tensei <br>Slime Tensei is a different story than that one. That one's name is Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken. <br><br><br>The  oldest one that inherited the territory. That other spoiler didn't really cover everything well but basically MC kept getting more and more famous and older brother felt threatened by the fact that his little brother was a hero and dragon slayer and stuff and thought he was trying to steal the territory. The King intentionally basically forced the situation though by making the MC visit his former home on his way to the demon forest for a mission request. The King really wanted that southern area to actually be developed since there was tons of resources and things there but MC's family had basically been turning down offers of assistance apparently. Not entirely sure why but there you go. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No  only the oldest brother was involved in the plot but he was also basically manipulated into it because of some nobles from the capital who wanted to get rid of MC. The other brothers, except for the smart one, were originally jealous of MC too but got over it, they got jobs under MC managing the territory as it rapidly develops now.  </br>  <br>Master of Monsters.</br>  <br>That's why I nicknamed it "Regarding Slime Tensei"<br><br>but really the other is so bad I might as well not even acknowledge its existence.</br></br></br>  <br><br>"Cthulu Average sidestory"<br><br>What I checked and I've seen no suck update. the last one was two months ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Trying to manage political depth in more than one city full of superheroes isn't something I think any superhero series has properly managed. <br>Brennus handles it pretty well, has an even worse beginning than Worm but it's ending up really good. It manages to create a pretty decent picture of all the crazy political landscapes that can occur worldwide when you throw supers into the mix while still getting into the lives of it's characters. Stone Burners does a good job too.</br></br>  <br> Cthulu Average <br>What happened with that? I thought the 2nd book was going to get translated but I also heard it's getting a LN that'll revise and continue the story.</br></br>  <br>your level of imagination</br>  <br>Sheeprabbit is working on Bakamille's story again. Not sure what happened with the side stories because I remember Vidar saying he had all the season 1 side stories done and was waiting for Sheeprabbit to finish season 1 to post them but then nothing.</br>  <br><br><br> cthulu <br> falling for the google translate meme <br>why cant you retards just call it jashin average<br>or at least call it evil god average</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> missing all the puns we made in the old threads </br>  <br>First chapters never ;_;</br>  <br><br>Is spider girl best girl?<br><br>Please say yes.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128173304 <br>No. Slime waifu is best girl.Altrough used goods.</br>  <br>Thanks for the spoiler. Also, what's going on in that pic? Is she a princess of sorts? Is he gonna add her to his harem?<br><br> also, when can I expect the pace to pick up? Translations are at chapter 28 as far as I know. </br></br></br>  <br>   also, when can I expect the pace to pick up? Translations are at chapter 28 as far as I know. <br> She is archipriest's daughter. He was joking about how she was getting many proposals and MC joked about joining in the queque so he ended up being forced to take her as main waifu since she has highest status amont the present harem members.She is the specialized healer of the party  </br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>She's  the Cardinal's granddaughter. She's actually the legal main wife as it were because of her high standing. When MC visits the church for the baptism thing, he gets in a conversation with the Cardinal and Cardinal mentions how his granddaughter is receiving a ton of marriage proposals. MC jokingly says maybe he should also offer a proposal and the Cardinal takes him at his word and makes it official that they're engaged. Cardinal knows that a mage as strong as MC will go really far politically. <br><br>Also translation pace is one chapter a week, are you still looking at the old site?</br></br></br>  <br>Currently reading Tensei Shitara Slime, Death March, Wordmaster, Slave Harem Labyrinth.<br><br>Any other LN/WN with world building, inventing or crafting, Level-up, just the MC being chill?</br></br></br>  <br>Well crafting would be Magi-Craft Meister. There's like 40 or so chapters of that translated.</br>  <br><br>Thanks again. Where am I supposed to read new chapters? I've been following infinitenoveltranslations thus far. I found another wordpress but all those chapters seem really messy despite being "edited" and "proofread" so I'm not so eager in reading those.</br></br>  <br>Only Sense Online is about comfy MMO crafting and MMO store managing.</br>  <br>Oh well, might as well read it too.<br><br>Talking about used goods, I thought that (pic related) was truly about used goods, but it wasn't. What a let down.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're following infinite then you're following the right site. Is one chapter a week too slow for you?</br>  <br>A little summary?</br>  <br>Maybe I just have a real distorted grasp on time. I don't know anymore man.</br>  <br>Can't wait till they get to the train journey part.</br>  <br><br>Will check it out, thanks</br></br>  <br>How about you try going out and experience the game called "real life" ?<br><br>It gets better? I dropped it after she finished the dungeon she is about to go in the translated chs.</br></br></br>  <br>MC saves a girl from being raped, and it happens the girl in question is also the "bad-girl" type, too.<br><br>She falls in love, and confesses, but he rejects her saying "no thanks, you are used goods", which is the reason why she starts changing.<br><br>One of the last threads just mentioned the title, so I thought it was about used goods, but it wasn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone reading <br>Reincarnated as main character little sister and....i just don't wanna die again <br>from royal road?<br>Or Re: dungeon?</br></br></br>  Just finished Owari no Chronicle 4B.  RIP Black Sun. Pretty emotional ending for a character that only spoke once.    <br> BC that's the way it has been referred to in this thread? Seriously who cares as long as you know what we are talking about.</br>  <br>It's in a shitty arc right now, honestly all the dungeon - combat related parts are kind of shitty. The traveling around part are great. There's a better part after the first dungeon part.</br>  <br>Were you using MTL to read those parts?</br>  <br>Not him but personally i really hate having a summoner and discovering she chooses kung fu as second class. I really want some more magicians MCs.</br>  <br>lets put it like this. person who controls bugs versus guy who turns into giant fire breathing dragon, who wins? the answer may surprise you.</br>  <br>I just think that summoning will only be really used against hundreds of enemies. I would like to see her using something like an army of summoned minions to fight, but kung fu against one is cool too.</br>  <br>Bug user of course. There are many ways you can defeat a dragon with bugs, like making them enter from his giant anus. That is as long as you can control them from far away.</br>  <br>strangely enough that does sound like something the MC would do to win a fight. that girl is scary ruthless.</br>  <br> Reincarnated as main character little sister and....i just don't wanna die again <br>What the<br><br>Tell me more about this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only read the start of the series before getting bored with how stupid it was but didn't the dragon win? MC only survived because other people intervened.</br>  <br>MC is reincarnated as a qt beast girl and is the sister of the MC of a game. She isn't allowed to train cause she has "weak health"(stupid MC tries to use magic when his race exponentially increases mp use so he faints for overuse) so she has to train in secret .She is trying hard to train in secret cause when she will hit 14 years old she will be kidnapped and then die in a fire. <br> She gets kidnapped aniway, ends up with a trap demon yandere falling in love with her.  </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128176265 <br> wanting used goods <br> wanting a delinquent <br> not wanting a qt yamato nadeshiko <br>Shame on you /a/non.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's there to cover for weaknesses. She can't instant cast the stronger ones so they're useless in battle unless if pre-casted. Her main instant ones (knight) becomes useless when they count as spirits and her opponent has some sort of aura that repels/melts nearby spirits.</br>  <br>Can't she just keep them on? She kept the knight on for the whole time.</br>  <br>if I remember right she at least fucked him up pretty bad and made his dick rot off.</br>  <br>Haven't there been a lot of magician MCs lately in LNs, with MT and Wordmaster being notable cases? <br><br>Don't be greedy, us "psst nothing personnel kid" rogue/assassin lovers get absolutely fucking nothing. I just want for once a MC who uses subterfuge, poison and his wit to defeat enemies.</br></br></br>  <br>No idea, might be mana or some other reason. Her strongest summons are big beasts that don't work well if you're going to fight someone in caves or a castle corridor.</br>  <br><br>Also, a different WN with a similar title is being updated on the same page, causing more confusion.</br></br>  <br>That'd actually require clever writing. Something that's too difficult for the authors.</br>  Toki no Shoushitsu Ukeoinin<br>Kuro no Tantei<br>Green worldz<br>Sentou Hakai Gakuen Dangerosu<br>Last two im caught up on and only on chapter two on the others</br></br></br></br>  <br>There was one where MC's weapon was a dagger and the story was quite nice with him being the guard of one of the former gods. I wonder when will tranlations restart. As for wordmaster the WN is a literal mess.</br>  <br>Yeah she fucked him up but she was still about get killed until other people intervened, I don't call that winning.</br>  <br>This isn't a manga thread dumbass.</br>  <br>it makes sense in that setting.<br>summoners have to be strong enough to solo fight the things they want to summon.<br><br>so being a weakling that only relies on summons means you cant get any stronger things to summon.</br></br></br></br>  So Slime Tensei, LN or WN?<br><br>WN is more far ahead, but I expect LN to have better writing..right?</br></br>  <br><br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Samayou_Shinki_no_D<wbr>uelist<br>Found it for you. Read this one it is quite good-</br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I'm enjoying Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka? a lot despite that.</br></br>  <br><br>sketchytranslations <br><br>Tokage no Ou and Sasami-san Ganbaranai's translator went MIA 2 years ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By the way, how are the translations for that one?</br>  <br>Is Slime Tensei even being worked on anymore? Also I don't think it has a LN.</br>  <br>sasami is still being translated, or are you talking about another translater.</br>  <br>It is another one, "regarding slime tensei" both WN LN are being translated.</br>  <br>Thanks anon. At this point I'm so desperate that a MC with a knife is rogue enough for me.  It's not machine translated right? </br>  <br>So you are talking about Tensei Shitara Slime. Slime Tensei is a different series' name. <br><br>Just read both the WN and LN translations.</br></br></br>  <br>Camille's magical ISIS excursion.</br>  <br>He doesn't use a knife except for a very small part of volume 2. Also the series is dead at volume 2. No more volumes.</br>  <br>"What have you've been reading,/a/?"</br>  <br>Welp, maybe I'll wait a bit before reading it after all.</br>  <br>Yeah it's pretty good, too bad it's dead. Loved how everything got flipped at the end of volume 1.</br>  <br>Antimagic is terrible. Author has no idea how weapons work and the MC is full blown retarded, e.g. MC never trains with his magic sword. He'll never question anything somebody says to him, except the most suspicious and obvious lies. <br><br>Such a gullible MC is ridiculous given his background.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, a character can't be more intelligent than the author anyway.</br>  <br>For something written on a dare it's a pretty fun timewaster.</br>  <br> MC never trains with his magic sword. <br>Because using the sword at all is risky as hell.</br></br>  <br> &gt;For something written on a dare <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>MC is too moralfag to me.<br><br>He should have sliced that faggot's stomach considering that faggot harmed his life and family much more than that witch did considering said faggot unleashed an apocalyptic horror on an entire city by being a super edgemaster.</br></br></br>  <br>She fought him again later. And won.</br>  Man, the King in Wordmaster was such an asshole. Fuck him.  <br>Is he worse than the one in Shield Hero?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>She's useful. It's just that it's completely outweighed by her general incompetence and stupidity.</br>  <br>Haven't read Shield Hero yet.<br><br>The Demon race, Evila, recently had a revolution where they overthrew their King that was basically trying to kill everyone. They then started to try and send peace treaties out.<br><br>Wordmaster's King basically gets two of his daughters killed trying to summon Heroes to fight the Evila. He does this while surpressing all knowledge about the Evila's revolution and peace treaties.<br><br>Then he lies to the summoned heroes about basically everything.<br><br>He goes to a peace treaty with the Evila and betrays them. He also betrays all the humans who trusted that this was actually a peace treaty, I guess.<br><br>He sends the Heroes along with a bunch of other people to go slaughter some Evila civilians, and gave the Heroes basically no situational training so they could get themselves killed as an excuse to wipe out the Evila.<br><br>He does all of that for "revenge" for the Evila "killing" his daughters. He breaks the peace treaty and totally fucks the Evila over, because they can't be trusted.<br><br>Which is a really dick move because he goes and trusts some Evila that were claiming to be traitors, which they were, to do all of this, right when he first got notice of the peace treaty.<br><br>Basically, the king is trying to fuck everyone over because he got his daughters killed for no good reason, and can't accept responsibility for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://oniichanyamete.wordpress.co<wbr>m/2015/07/15/somebody-translated-eg<wbr>a-side-story-6/</wbr></wbr></br>  Is there a hero as weak and unfortunate as Kazuma? What terrible reality actually has female orcs?  <br>He can't take a fucking break.</br>  <br><br>He actually has EX rank luck but every girl in his party has F rank luck and as a result, even with his godly luck it can't fight against three people with the worst luck. <br><br>Whenever he's with those three, he's destined to eat shit.</br></br></br></br>  Currently, nothing.<br>Hopefully this in a few weeks.</br>  Currently enjoying the edge.<br><br> But seriously, there are two translators and several editors working on this and they take a fucking week for one chapter, and it still reads like shit. </br></br>  Anyone read Man Picked up by the Gods?<br><br>Seeing a lot of releases coming out.</br></br>  <br>No, it's shit.</br>  <br>I swear, most web novel translators are children who think Google Translate is accurate, or they're foreigners who think their english isn't shit—or both.<br><br>I can't fathom anyone who knows english and is older then 15 being this shit at writing, without just being lazy.<br><br><br>Was curious about it too.<br>What's it about, and why is it shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I picked Hai to Gensou no Grimgal recently, was a good read, there is 3 manga chapther if anyone is interested  <br>The man picked up by gods is basically just another reincarnated MC making money out of the ideas of his old world and so far many has been reincarnated like him.(one brought a shotgun as their power,too bad he forgot how to ask for unlimited ammo) MC gets pick up by the gods because before he got transported his life was pretty shitty and the way he died is pretty stupid too.<br><br>well i do i like the curbstomping 40 adventurers with his slimes<br><br>making a laundrymat shop<br><br><br>its okay<br>MC is pretty chill<br><br>but other than that its fucking shitty reading almost 10 chapters of him cleaning restrooms and toilets</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ah, I wish they would focus on Long Live Summons instead of Descent of the Phoenix.  It should be considered a crime to be this hot.  <br>Nothing.

The protagonist is not a self insert super powerful MC, the story is pretty good, the writing and common sense is above worm. <br><br> It's a bit slow on the updates, but I think it deserves some love. If I can get two or three people to read it I am happy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I started reading it before it catch on at 4chan, up to chapter 30something I believe, but god, was it stupid? <br> The politics were bad enough it was notorious the author never stepped out of home. The main character was a cynical, nihilist and imbecile with a bullshit power that always won and was somehow better person that others simply because the story went out of its way to point that out.<br> Really, screw it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Please man, the guy is basically always right. He is a walking strawman argument that never loses his cool and always wins easily. He is the typical self insert of the author and his points of view.</br></br>  <br><br>On the subject of good stuff that will NEVER get nearly as much attention as crappy "teleported/reincarnated to magic land" novels; Anybody reading pic related? I am hype somebody actually updated the Baka Tsuki page with three new chapters, but it is going at a crawl regardless. <br><br> Mushoku Tensei is great novel, even if the reincarnation gig is already overused by now </br></br></br></br>  Reading third time in another world<br><br> become girl <br> enslave loli <br> enslave demon lord <br><br>living the dream</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I heard the same, but the starting was pretty decent regardless. The protagonist overpowered nature is getting out of hand quickly, though.</br></br>  <br>It'll never get as much attention because the translations are slow as fuck<br><br>remember Tate hero and Mushoku Tensei were popular because the translators just dished out the chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>Well reading spoilers says that  despite being super overpowered as a mage and even his party becoming super overpowered too, he's getting stuck taking construction and land development type requests and not actual monster hunt ones anymore. <br><br>Plus I think as of most recent chapters all his wives are pregnant now. Which I find a bit of a stretch since they've been having sex at multiple times a week for years at this point. You'd think one of them would have gotten pregnant sooner and not 4 of them at once. </br></br> </br>  <br>Mar 04, 2015 - Volume 3 Chapters 1-2 completed<br>Apr 07, 2014 - Volume 3 Prologue completed<br>Mar 02, 2014 - Volume 2 Chapter 7 completed<br>Mar 02, 2014 - Volume 2 Chapter 6 completed<br>Mar 02, 2014 - Volume 1 Epilogue completed<br>Feb 24, 2014 - Volume 1 Chapter 7 completed<br>Jan 24, 2014 - Volume 2 Chapter 5 completed<br>Nov 25, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 4 completed<br>Oct 20, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 6 completed<br>Oct 19, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 3 completed<br>Sep 13, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 2 completed<br>Aug 21, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 5 completed<br>Aug 17, 2013 - Volume 2 Chapter 1 completed<br>Jun 28, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 4 completed<br>Apr 24, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 3 completed<br>Mar 14, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 2 completed<br>Feb 12, 2013 - Volume 1 Chapter 1 completed<br>Jan 24, 2013 - Volume 1 Prologue completed<br>Jan 24, 2013 - Initiated as Teaser Project<br><br>Precedent translator :<br> I'm currently working on Rakuin no Monshou and intend to finish it through. <br><br> As I'm relatively new in this I won't be working on any other projects for a while yet. <br> But that'll probably change in the future. <br><br> intend to finish it <br> intend to finish it <br> intend to finish it <br> intend to finish it <br><br>Current translator :<br> I'm new at translating <br><br>And 4 months later, still no new chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Besides being so rich that the country he works for can't pay him back and has to pay him back in installments for the next 20 years <br>being married to the Cardinal's granddaughter and numerous mistresses who are all pregnant<br>being given a large amount of land to develop because no other than MC can do it, due to it being the home of monsters normal people can't fight<br>Having the most MP out of all of humanity and generally being broken as all hell<br><br>The fucker actively tries not to get anymore women shoved into his hands anymore because he has too many as it is.

Manga might serve as a better intro though.</br></wbr></br>  <br> Check it <br>Oh look today's update.</br></br>  <br>Fuckin hell that's hilarious.</br>  <br>i have already read the manga up to date, from which chapter can i read the ln?</br>  <br>Not sure. I'd just read from the beginning and skim, the WN moves really fast. LN translations are kind of slow, I'm not sure how far along they are.</br>  How is Kuro no Maou?<br><br>translator give the description that it's full of suffering and lolis. Lolis are ok but the suffering description makes me hesitant.</br></br>  <br>Why can't i find the translation? <br> Is no one doing it? </br></br>  <br>seems the manga went up to chapter 11 when the MC goes to the Dwarf kingdom. <br><br>though I suggest just reading from the beginning.</br></br></br>  Wordmaster 155 is up.<br><br>And on that note, sites that use odd fonts are hell.</br></br>  <br><br>It's going by very slowly, they've done 74 chapters and the only thing the main character has done is learn some new tricks and make ice popsicles, no seriously. <br><br>The story has edgy parts every now and then before it gets thrown in more SoL segments.  The main heroine is a half-fairy that is a loli and a total yandere when she transforms into an adult. <br><br>No crazy bullshit powerups, luck in finding super rare weapons or gear, no fast paced movement as the MC grows stronger and builds up a harem. This story takes powering up very slowly as in very slowly compared to normal novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's been up for a while you know? It's a pain in the ass, but at least it has Kuro no Maou as a side dish.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Well, that's what I get from being 100% reliant on Aho-Updates.</br>  <br> The main heroine is a half-fairy that is a loli <br>Picked<br>  she transforms into an adult. <br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  I miss the Mushoku Tensei threads where moon people will post untranslated WNs they are enjoying.<br><br>The only series that's not being translated that I'm still hype for is a series called Dream Life.</br></br>  <br> I keep hearing about it, is it a light hearted story or drama? <br>Angsty dramafest<br><br>Seriously fuck that shit, it's relatively well written but doesn't deserve the hype it got. Wormfags took everything too seriously.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She only does it when she goes full yandere mode. <br>Also, her adult form is only like 13 years old. She only went full adult once </br></br>  What is /a/'s thoughts on Gantz?  Masterpiece. Ending sucked though, but, eh, why the fuck does it not deserve a Disney ending.  <br> What is /a/'s thoughts on Gantz? <br><br>Stick it in</br></br></br>  <br>Everything before Katastrophe, the best series ever made, or at least the best sci-fi series.</br>  The author obviously thought up a cool premise and then didn't know where to go from there. Everything revealed about the Gantz ball is disappointing and the ending is just Independence Day.  <br><br>This, also the art went to shit.</br></br>  <br>this, Gantz and Berserk are the best's mangas in the fucking world, in their generes obviusly</br>  Was sweet and action packed for a while, but tripped and feel at the finish line when the catastrophe started.<br><br>Out of all the manga I read, this was by far the most memorable.</br></br>  <br>great art</br>  <br> baby's first seinen </br>  <br>First arc was good, then it becomes shit</br>   you will never have a Gantz remake by Madhouse/Bones <br><br>why even live?</br></br>  <br>because I definitely want to see an animation where gantz goes to shit.</br>  <br>This. All that build-up and the pay-off is "we prepared you for ayyyy invasion"<br>Durr hurr</br></br>  End of the Italy arc is where I mentally cut it.<br><br>Before that, it's the best damn dark sci fi manga out there.</br></br>  Is the anime any good?  The vampires killed it  Did Gantz start the whole "lets turn videogamey things into a manga story" cancer? <br>Not counting things that were originally games, like Pokemon</br>  <br>what anime?</br>  <br>Reading it for the first time was fun as fuck</br>  <br><br>I stopped reading after that fat retarded chick turned out to be some super genius or something - worth picking up again?</br></br>  I only saw the anime and a lot of people say the manga fixed this at some point after where the anime ended, but I really think it would've benefited from not trying to make me take it so seriously. The concept is ridiculous, almost all the characters are actively irritating, you get desensitized to the death and gore really early on, but when the dude breaks down and starts crying about something stupid every other episode it takes up a lot of time and focus. I get the feeling they wanted you to get invested in and empathize with him even though he's just a whiny piece of shit with no positive qualities for the majority of the show.<br><br>The action and gore was entertaining and I'm usually into shows like that if they're more self aware.</br></br>    <br><br>What they said.<br><br>However I was jealous of that fucker because  you know why. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess thats a no</br>  <br>It's stupid but it's stupid in a fun way not in a bad way. Wish I could say the same about the ending.</br>  <br><br>Found the page, does it get any better from here?</br></br>   yfw its just Man in Black with gore   <br>It's dragged down by the most unbelievably slow pacing. They would spend like 3 episodes just going home after a mission.</br>  <br>That's an odd way of putting it. However at the same time it could make sense. But don't forget tits too.</br>  <br>That's where it starts getting worse.</br>  Had a good start, but went to shit and dropped more interesting storylines after the hiatus  <br>Germans ruin everything. Especially Gantz.</br>  <br><br>Good to know, I liked the whole two Kei's thing when the hot chick went insane and created another Kei... I was seriously expecting some clone sex.<br><br>I guess this will be another one of those series I drop before the story turns it to shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what are your favorites?</br>  <br> almost all the characters are actively irritating <br>Also this, there wasn't a single likable person, maybe except for that pedo fighter guy, and a dude who fought just to get some alien pussy</br></br>  <br>ah yeah, do you believe in god?</br>  <br>Panda.</br>   kills off Lara Croft <br> brings in Tae <br>Fuck this gay world.<br>I tried reading it again for the 3rd time but I raged halfway and dropped it.<br>It's both my favorite manga and my most hated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good start and went downhill fast.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. Even god can't make her fuckable.</br>  This is a Japanese boy detective in a dress    <br> this is the only way we'll make a profit! <br>Anime is doomed</br></br>  Are Ranpo's stories this retarded?  Schrodinger's Genitals until there is confirmation  <br><br> mdw </br></br>  THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT    <br>How is it doomed when this was made by a hack?<br>I don't think Seiji Kishi is important enough to warrant an statement like that</br></br>  <br>Of course not. The problem here is the hack named Kishi, and the fact the anime takes enormous creative liberties with the stories</br>    <br><br>Go read the wikipedia summary of human chair. <br><br>The only thing they took was the name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how he got tits?</br>  He's the hero lolis deserve, because every loli has a right to be happy. So we'll beat him up. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A shadow man.  <br>;_;</br>      <br>Fucking shota shit shows always kill lolis fast.<br>This and Chaos Dragon too.</br></br>  <br>Thank god he didn't twirl or my heart would explode.</br>  <br><br>So does he enjoy teasing his friend, or is he actually autistic and doesn't notice</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he's just asexual and doesn't care about that stuff in general.</br>  <br>i hope hashiba got balls enough to ask him next time.</br>    <br>what is it with people declaring every character who doesn't blatantly show sexual attraction all the time asexual? By those standards, you'd think the vast majority of people you meet are asexual.</br>  Kobayashi is some next level but I'm also finding Hashiba cute too<br>Maybe it's just his obliviousness, or my rapidly intensifying obsession with 2D boys</br>  <br>I think its more like he's completely unaware of how weird and sexual some of his actions come off as. I don't particularly think that makes him asexual rather than just unaware of these kinds of things. Which sort of makes sense considering he's in middle school and judging by how feminine he is, hasn't really hit puberty yet.</br>   anime being watched mostly for the trap starts piling on the feels <br>of course</br>  <br>I just wanted to see butts<br>I didn't want to see a man utterly destroyed</br></br>  <br>The moment they started giving the backstory for the loli I had a feeling she was gonna be dead. I hated that I was right. Shadow-man truly is a great man, only to be broken by the filth of society.</br>  <br/>  <br>Me too, but I never though her fate would be that cruel, tossed inside a grinder and made a wall decoration.</br>  Did they try and shove an entire novel into a 20 minute episode? The pacing in this is the worst in any anime this season<br><br> the trap is cute though </br></br>  <br>From an anon in the previous thread, it seems they just take the little things like the novel titles and the characters but made the story all new.</br>  <br>Then there's no excuse for it. How is anybody supposed to enjoy something this rushed? It completely takes away any chance at getting invested in the characters.</br>  <br>The fucking grinder, god that was horrible. Making lolis into Han Solo-esque wall ornaments is degenerate behavior.</br>  <br>Don't think of it as an adaptation, its pretty much an original work.</br>   obese man that lives with his mom, loves lolis and kills those who disagree with him <br><br>/a/: The Anime Character</br></br>  <br>It's roughly a case per episode. You'll see the same recurring characters every week, so those are the ones they want you to get invested in.</br>  <br>Which is all well and good, but you still have to properly tell the story of an episode. You can't just ignore it for the sake of the larger arc</br>  <br>Its a homage/anniversary thing for the author, the japanese probably already knew the story or at least will be interested to see how it went in the originals.</br>  <br>You got a chuckle out of me anon.</br>  nice girl  <br>I don't think it's that weird. It's normal for the introduction of a side character to be a single episode. This episode was the introduction of the paper bag guy.</br>  <br><br>Clearly the point of this episode was uniting the shotacon, trapfag, and lolicon communities against the true and most degenerate menace: daughteru fags</br></br>  me on the right  <br>im the bear</br>  So headache guy is a 2cool4school prodigy that gets 100 in all his test, a genius detective and also a martial artist that can kick around landwhales much larger than him (plus a kakkoii sugoi ikemen that makes kobayashi's boypussy go tanoshii and start lubricating itself). Anything else?<br><br>The police should just have him choke on pills, give him a gun and send him to solve every case, he'd probably do it for more pills. They can fire the siscon and the other one that looks like he's about to shit himself, it's not like they do anything at all.</br></br>  <br>me mixed with concrete down the hall</br>  <br>If the loli could see the aura of paperbag man before , how could she get tricked?</br>  <br>You shouldn't feel that threatened by him. He actually injured himself for being too skinny and fucked up his hips for doing a retarded spinning kick. <br><br>In an unrelated note, as a straight guy who isn't attracted to Kobayashi I am going a bit GAR for him</br></br></br>  Shadow Man is probably going to be back as an ally since he's on the spread. The semen demon in the corner is Black Lizard, she's a crime lord and Akechi's female archnemesis at least in the novels. The guy in the far back is the Fiend with Twenty Faces who is also Akechi's arch nemesis.  <br>Will japan ever get tired of superhuman teenage edgelord chuunibyou wish fulfillment characters?<br><br> They can fire the siscon and the other one that looks like he's about to shit himself, it's not like they do anything at all. <br>hey that's not true. They interfere with kobayashi doing their jobs for them. So at least that's something</br></br></br></br>  That's hardly a mystery at all. Where's the part that supposed to have watchers to think along with the detective?  <br> Superhuman <br> dislocates his hip with one kick </br></br>  <br> mystery <br>Its not.</br></br>  <br>I just want to see more of the coroner lady. She was cute.</br>  <br>what is it then</br>  <br>Maybe the aura she can see is the lolicon aura</br>  <br>It's not that kind of show<br><br>It was apparent from early in the first episode that this was going to lean more on strangeness than mystery solving<br><br>Go watch CSI or something</br></br></br></br></br>  see this what do  <br> YOU CANT USE THAT, IT REDUCES YOUR LIFESPAN BY X YEARS <br>if a weakness or injury is just mentioned but has no actual plot consequences, it's not a weakness at all.</br></br>  <br>Han-solo wasn't shredded.</br>  <br>oh shit you're right</br>  <br>We should also get the Fiend next episode since they showed this during the ending</br>  ;_;7  <br>It does have actual plot consequences. It's for that exact reason that he doesn't go around solving cases by himself</br>  <br>Fucked up criminals and kobayashi's ass.</br>  <br>UNZIPS SEMEN</br>  <br>The lolis didn't look particularly shredded either, they just looked like they were frozen in carbonite.</br>  <br> wonder how I got there <br> flee for fear of taking the blame <br> if there's anything big and heavy enough to smash the handcuffs do it for brownie points with kobayashi </br></br></br>  So by this he specifically meant little girl, right? Seems like a confusing translation  <br>The hero we need but don't deserve.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> Akechi's arch nemesis is Bayonetta </br>  <br> those hips <br>That's a female body if I ever saw one. You can fake breasts, be short and have feminine legs, but you can't reproduce the curve of a woman's shapely hips.  Shit trap. </br></br>    <br>Yea I got confused when he disguised himself as the mom and I remembered him saying that line.</br>  <br>Help him up and compliment his looks ofc</br>  <br>Shouldn't you be in Gakkou Gurashi?</br>  <br>Is the woman inspired on that one that Sherlock Holmes crushed on? Does Akechi give a fuck about her outside of the rival thing?</br>  <br>he specifically said the word for little girl, the translators were dumb.</br>  <br>But I have relatively womanly hips, it's just random chance</br>  <br>Do they usually watch the episode through before translating? I guess I can see how they could think girl is enough if they haven't seen where the plot is going, but after watching it there is zero reason not to add "young" there</br>  <br>Black Lizard is kind of like Batman and Cat Woman. Both rivals but they really want to fuck each other and they find excitement in outwitting or fighting the other.</br>  <br> man is a master thief and can disguise himself as nearly anything <br> practically dedicates his life to worship of little girls <br> but he'll never be able to be one <br>this is like /a/'s worst nightmare</br></br></br></br>  <br>but he could disguise himself as a little boy and have his very own mujaki no rakuen-esque adventure</br>  <br>Of course he can't. Can't change his height.</br>  <br>Shadow Man is the light side of /a/<br>Fatty is the dark side<br>it's like poetry</br></br></br>  <br>Then he's a lying little shit</br>  <br>can we have a middle ground? I want to be able to love the loli too, Shadow man is too pure to lay hands on them</br>  <br>no anon, you mustn't.</br>  <br>Lolis are like the sun<br><br>Fatguy-chan was once like you, all he wanted to to was to love and touch the lolis a little. But he was wrong. You cannot touch the loli without burning your soul and becoming a maniac.<br><br>That is why you must not touch the loli.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't be that big of a man</br>  He's a pretty large male  <br>U U<br>U U</br></br>  <br>Is that Fiend the same Fiend from Daughter of Twenty Faces?</br>  What would you do with them?  <br>Four mouths?</br>  <br> boy underwear <br>burn them and buy him a bunch of frilly panties</br></br>  <br> You shouldn't feel that threatened by him. <br>It's not really that, I kind of like him, his addiction and no-shoes-inside-the-house autism is amusing. The thing is, I don't really get what are they trying to do with him. He's a genius so he's the brain of the team, that's fine, but he's also the muscle? What's the point of having the police guys, if he can take down the criminals by himself then?<br><br>Plus the whole thing felt out of character. He's the calm and collected guy that thinks before doing anything, and that gives no fucks at all, and didn't care about this particular case either, but then he suddenly rushes to kick the fatass for no reason at all, and when there was no need to, and when the siscon told him to not do it. If he's so smart, how come he didn't saw himself getting hurt? He acts like everything is a pain in the ass so much, one would assume he would do anything to avoid getting hurt, and then goes and gets himself hurt.<br><br>If anything I think I feel threatened by this show writing. I probably should stop caring about the plot and just enjoy the boypussy. That's what everyone's been doing right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He knew Chair-sensei was lusting for his  wide, soft hips , and is shown to be quick on the uptake of people's feelings, so I'm of the suspicion that he knows exactly what he's doing, kissing his poor blueballed friend on the cheek, handing him his underwear in public and keeping the dress like he just wants to see how long it takes before the guy snaps and does something about all the cockteasing. That sounds about as tanoshii as anything else Kobayashi admittedly adores. There's no way that crazy little fuck doesn't have a huge list of dirty fetishes  and I want to know them all. </br>  <br>So did Kobayashi put on pantsu or did they just not wear underwear?</br>  <br>yes they're literally the same person. Although the Fiend from Daughter of Twenty Faces isn't like his novel version. The Fiend is supposed to be arrogant and kind of an asshole while they made him sort of a gentleman character in Daughter of the Twenty Faces. I think the Ranpo Kitan version should be more accurate.</br>  <br> kissing his poor blueballed friend on the cheek <br>I think that was a whisper, the angle made it looked like he was kissing him.</br></br>  <br>Kiss them<br>Or did you mean the underwear</br></br>  <br>I like gentlemen thieves but I'm looking forward to him still.</br>  <br>maybe he puts on an indifferent front but he actually does care about justice, so he wanted to hurt the guy? it's not really that hard anon</br>  <br>fap</br>  <br>Replace with frilly/lace panties.</br>  <br> he suddenly rushes to kick the fatass for no reason at all <br>he was protecting his fuccboi</br></br>  <br>I knew it was coming and I still lost it.</br>  <br>I would get it if the fuccboi was under his feet completely on his mercy, but he's in different room altogether.</br>  <br>I seriously don't get how you could lose a fight to a man that fat. Just dodge his slow ass hits and fuck him up while he's taking 3 years to recover.</br>  <br> What's the point of having the police guys, if he can take down the criminals by himself then? <br>I thought from the first episode that maybe they were those two incompetent guys in detective shows that serve as a foil and that inform of cases, like in Sherlock Holmes, but from those two chapters I'm not sure. Maybe they are going to have another role further in the season.<br> Plus the whole thing felt out of character. He's the calm and collected guy that thinks before doing anything, and that gives no fucks at all, and didn't care about this particular case either, but then he suddenly rushes to kick the fatass for no reason at all, and when there was no need to, and when the siscon told him to not do it. If he's so smart, how come he didn't saw himself getting hurt? He acts like everything is a pain in the ass so much, one would assume he would do anything to avoid getting hurt, and then goes and gets himself hurt. <br>I don't see him like that. The guy spends most of his time being a coach potato playing games that are stimulating or sleeping. He probably spends the rest of his time working or exercising a little. Keep in mind that he is drugged all the fucking day, so him working this way, as a low capacity rechargeable battery is pretty logical. That gives me the thought now that he is so dead most of the time that he doesn't have the time to clean, leading to the shoes autismo.<br> I probably should stop caring about the plot and just enjoy the boypussy. That's what everyone's been doing right? <br>Not me. I just genuinely enjoy the show. It baited me with some good plot points in the first episode for things getting serious at the end (especially with the friend of Akechi), and for now, while it is introducing the characters, it uses the contrast between their views to create a grotesquely funny and entertaining story due to their reactions to each murder. Kage Otoko going all poignant after what happened this episode was hilarious</br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.forbes.com/sites/laureno<wbr>rsini/2015/07/16/how-one-website-is<wbr>-convincing-people-to-pay-for-carto<wbr>on-porn/</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br> comic lo <br> good <br>lolno is the naruto/snk of loli</br></br></br>  <br> will get them arrested on child porn charges <br>And that's why I said what I said about you knowing jack shit.

It's a common mistake.</br>  I'll revive this thread.  <br>3/4<br>Fantastic: Ping Pong<br>Great: Rainbow<br>Meh: Geass<br><br><br> lowest form of entertainment <br>That's VNs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all my favorite shows aired before 2000. that means i have great taste. :)</br>  <br>That's light novels.</br>  <br>Guess you've never heard of Uchouten Kazoku and Shin Mazinger.<br><br><br>They share the distinction.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's tokusatsu</br></br>  <br> Zelda II <br> Metroid Prime PINBALL <br> SUPER ROBOT PINBALL <br>What, for the love of God, are you fucking doing? You have great taste for the other stuff, but your vidya taste is atrocious. At least you have Ghost Trick, Metroid Prime and Super Mario Land 2 on there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like pinball. I don't really get much out of game stories, obviously with a few exceptions. It's not very a good medium for storytelling. That's why I tend to prefer more arcade-like titles. I want something I can pick up and play for thirty minutes to an hour. I also tend to prefer handheld games.</br>  <br> It's not very a good medium for storytelling <br>This tells me you haven't played many video games. Planescape: Torment is a masterpiece, and it's up there with some of the classics in literature (this coming from a guy who both reads and plays vidya a lot, literature and vidya are my primary interests).</br></br>  <br><br>The majority of Vns are written awfully and are pudrid garbage, but they still appeal to entertainment in a more engrossing and choreographed with a fleshed out story and characters, while being generally more thought out than your average video game.</br></br>  <br> This tells me you haven't played many video games. <br>I haven't played many recently (got burnt out), but I wrote for a game site for a few years and even went to e3. Growing up my main hobby was playing video games. But sure, exceptions exist. But compared to other forms of media, video games are pretty bad at telling stories.</br></br>  /v/ please leave  AIN'T NOTHING CHANGED BUT THE MULA  <br>Are these shows really your favorites or are they just cherry picked from the vast amount of anime you've watched then chosen because they were obscure? Honesty would be appreciated. Also how much anime total have you watched? Just curious.</br>  <br>Those aren't obscure</br>  <br> Also how much anime total have you watched? <br>Not as much as a lot of people on /a/. I don't general watch anime as its airing, and I tend to spend a month or more per series. <br><br>Completed:<br>TV: 64<br>OVA: 65<br>Movies: 108<br>Spcl.: 23<br><br>And yeah, those are my favorites. They're really not obscure either. Most of those are series by well-known directors. Same goes for the films and OVAs. Obscure would be me picking some random seasonal anime from a few years ago that only a few people watched. These are all series that stood the test of time. It's not at all surprising that they'd be my favorite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You guys are right they really aren't that obscure if your into older shows but I guarantee that most anons would barely recognize any one of those shows hence why I said obscure.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the show with the blue bald guy and the ova with the 3 blue guys called?</br>  <br>Good<br><br>Not good</br></br></br>  <br>The series is Lupin III Series 1 and the OVA is Cyber City OEDO 808.</br>  <br>And people think /a/ is better than reddit.</br>  <br>i've seen your taste on /v/ it's fucking shit.

She's very important to her older brother Boruto, and she really adores her older brother too. Even though she is just a young girl, shes helps out her mother Hinata with the housework; It's also a reliable aspect of hers. Although her father Naruto tends to be absent, she even doesn't seem to voice her discontent to him. Instead, she patiently endures it.</br></br>  <br>junko seems to dig himawari at least</br>  <br> She is Boruto's mother and Naruto's wife. With her pure heart, she continued to wholeheatedly love Naruto since childhood. Now that she became a mother, it became a deep affection that she pours into her family. Even though her husband can't look after his family, since he's too preoccupied with his exhausting work as the Hokage, she still has unwavering faith in him. But as for Naruto and Boruto, things aren't going well since there's a dilemma between her husband and son. It's something that makes her feel saddened. She has the Byakugan, which she inherited from the Hyuuga clan. Also note that she easily handles the housework and is family-oriented.  <br> Hinata's facial expression compilation. She doesn't have her 'Shyness' anymore. </br></br>   "That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived." <br><br>Reminder that this garbage somehow became One Piece's rival.</br></br>  <br><br>Junko didn't gave much fucks about NaruHina stuff in genaral.

In the space of a probably limited screentime anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> make way for new best girl </br>  <br>Himawari is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br> i hope well get to see her show a little bit of the confidence that she had in that post-credits The Last scene </br>  <br><br><br>  stockings <br><br>sarada who?</br></br></br></br></br>  so how are the chances of japanese people camripping it<br>also pre screening when?</br>  <br>Probably not very high.</br>  <br>i think australia is getting it early again</br>  <br>You mean the kid that people will always think looks like Karin more than her? Kishi did that shit on purpose.</br>  <br>  relying on the shitposter prison colony, ever. </br>  <br>aussie anon was the one that delivered the last camrip so</br>  om nom nom  <br> stockings <br>they seem to be in fashion for all preteen Konoha girls</br></br>  <br><br>Best two</br></br>    <br>Sasusaku is the most popular het pairing on Japan so Kishi couldn't get away with not making Sakura the bio mom. I wouldn't be surprised if Kishi never intended to let Karin be the mom but he wanted to scare the sasusakus for generating intestest on Gaiden and it worked, considering even 2ch was afraid</br>  <br>hope an ausfag is doing it</br>  <br> Can't show why Sakura likes Sasuke without sounding contrived <br> They still get married and have a kid together <br>Sasusaku confirmed for editorial mandate</br></br></br>  <br>By virtue of the editor having been the one who made Kishi make them in the first place.<br>Kishi did make them marry and somehow procreate, but has no idea what the fuck could have led to that (besides rape, presumably).</br></br>  <br>I doubt that. It was most likely that Jump made him write ten extra chapters to promote the movie, he wanted to use the opportunity to draw his new Uchiha waifu but couldn't think of a plot, his assistant told him about the people asking if Karin was the mom of the kid that lives in Sakura's house just because of the glasses, so he wrote about that.</br>  <br>Sasuke is Kishi's husbando though. Also, without the editor, Naruto wouldn't even exist. Hell, Kishi wanted to make a Harry Potter's rip-off</br>  <br>I was merely pointing out to that anon that 'editor's mandate' only really applies via the characters being the editor's idea, the contrived mess of them somehow ending up conceiving a child is more directly Kishi's doing, despite him having no idea how it could have happened.<br>Also wasn't the manga at some point meant to be a cooking manga? Then later, a relatively widely seen pilot had Naruto as the cub of a dead 9 Tails that could transform into a human boy and was sent by the village chief to the city to find friends.</br></br>  <br> she also gets pushed around by a rambunctious Boruto <br>Oh, I bet she does.</br></br>  <br> "The reason why Hinata came to like Naruto is clear, but I've deliberately avoided writing down the reason why Sakura came to like Sasuke." (laugh) "That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived." <br>At least he's self-aware.</br></br>  <br> the characters being the editor's idea <br>All editor said was add a rival and a grill to play up Naruto with.</br></br>    <br> The Uchiha clan battles together with Boruto! <br>Nardo must be pretty fucking jealous.</br></br>  <br>How much better would the manga have been if that editor was ignored and Sasuke and Sakura didn't exist? <br>I bet it would have been more about ninja stuff and less about Uchiha clan fucking everything up and chasing Sasuke for years.</br></br>  <br> ZR and skirt combo </br>  <br> With her pure heart, she continued to wholeheatedly love Naruto since childhood. Now that she became a mother, it became a deep affection that she pours into her family <br> incest </br></br>  <br>Somebody else would have taken Sasuke's place as the edgy rival that Naruto is in love with.<br><br>Kishi himself says Naruto is about bonds not about ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Michael J. Fox was in Australia and he got The Last camrip for us.<br><br><br> dem thighs  <br>Good Lord Salad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How much better would the manga have been if that editor was ignored and Sasuke and Sakura didn't exist? <br>If that editor was ignored the manga would have flunked.It's really sad but it's true</br></br>  <br>He'd either still need a team of some sort or be picked more on a needs basis for each mission (i.e. needing a bruiser, someone with stamina and someone with tracking abilities for the expected task, so Lee, Naruto and Kiba are put on a team for the duration of the mission).<br>Alternatively<br> Sasuke and Sakura are created <br> Zabuza Arc happens, they both die brutally <br> MC has to deal with losing comrades </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But there were no more ninja team missions after the Land of Waves other than the Forest of Death.</br>  <br>Part of the reason the series went to shit, shifting its focus to taking back a filthy traitor.</br>  <br> Michael J. Fox was in Australia and he got The Last camrip for us. <br>ouch</br></br>  <br>He could have followed the exact same formula. We just wouldn't have had to deal with all the shitty arcs and character assassinations that happened because of Sasuke,</br>  <br>I think the manga would have been alright as long as there were ninja missions and a tournament arc. I don't think it would have flopped if Sakura never existed. Naruto would have to have a rival anyways since it's shonen, but it would have been better if Sasuke never left the village and the manga just focused on rivalries between villages instead of that decade long Sasuke chase.</br>  <br>Sasuke is the main reason why Naruto has female fans</br>  <br>Firstly, they are hardly the main demographic the genre aims for.<br>Secondly theyre'd be plenty regardless of the Sauce. Fujos are all about Kakashi, Iruka and Sasori, whereas for the less crazy ones you still have Neji as the bad boy or Shikamaru and maybe Shino as the cool headed guy. Who else is popular amongst female fans anyway, besides Itachi?<br>Thirdly the discussion should be about what would make the show better, not necessarily more popular. The Uchihas and Sauce are pretty popular in Japan due to their shit taste and weird ideology that clicks with them but not westerners. It doesn't mean that the clan and the character were not massive tumors on the manga's body.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Personally I thought it'd make more sense if the Chuunin Exams happened first, then a series of Chuunin-level missions were completed by the teams. We never really saw what life was like at that shinobi rank.</br></br>  <br> The Uchihas and Sauce are pretty popular in Japan due to their shit taste and weird ideology that clicks with them but not westerners. <br>I'm pretty sure Sasuke clicks a lot with edgy teenagers and Sasusaku recently won an internet poll as the best couple. Wasn't some russian kid that killed himself for Itachi?</br></br>  Fuck off Narutards.  <br>Land of Waves and all those shitty fillers after Sasuke left the village were chunnin/jonin missions.<br><br>Genin usually just do shit like cleaning up toilets and walking dogs.</br></br></br>  <br>Problem is that based on the Chuunin exam as is, the only person of that rank is Shikamaru.<br>You could sort of make an argument why Naruto deserved a promotion, both for using a measure of tactics against Neji and more importantly for taking down Gaara, but he was hardly ready for those tasks and putting him directly in charge of his own team or the other rookies his age could be amusing for a bit, but not productive in terms of furthering his growing to know, befriend and acknowledge them and back. If anything as a superior officer he'd be distanced from them, which is the last thing the character needs.</br></br>  Nip fujos are better than western fujos, considering NarutoxShikamaru is a very popular pairing there    <br>It is still nothing compared to SasuNaru and Kakashixeveryone</br>  <br>I wonder if Bort's actually going to pass the Exams since he's likely going to mop the floor with Shikadai until Momo and Kin crash the party.<br><br>I don't exactly see him giving a monologue about FRIENDSHIP and then using the giant demon fox shoved up his ass to win.</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Gaara.</br>  <br>On the one hand it could show him surpassing his father at a task he at that age could not achieve, especially if he does it by fighting smart instead of spamming clones and relying on guts/stamina/demon fox to win the day for him. It is Bolt's stated goal, so it could very well happen.<br>On the other hand the exams are disrupted, it would be unfair to half the competitors if they just called it quits after they got Naruto back. We might simply not have the results either, as the focal point is mending the father-son rift, not getting promoted.</br></br>  <br>Naruto deserved the promotion for handling Gaara, not for his chunnin exam fight, ultimately he only won because the fox and his unlimited stamina bailed him out.<br><br>Sasuke apparently proved himself to be a chunnin worthy ninja according to the toothpick guy but for some reason didn't get promoted.</br></br></br>  <br>It strange that Hinata still looks and dressed like a teenage girl. Must be going through a mid-life crisis.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. I like Hinata for her backstory and personality and breasts. But Kishimoto is just giving ammo to people who dislike her.</br>  <br>The only reason Sakura liked Sasuke was that he was hot, that's why all of Sakura's character development had to be erased for it to happen. <br><br>Sasusaku truly is horrible.</br></br></br>  <br>At least it's better than the generic housewife outfit she had in 700 and in the family picture.</br>  <br> Naruto deserved the promotion for handling Gaara, not for his chunnin exam fight, ultimately he only won because the fox and his unlimited stamina bailed him out. <br>Based on the skill level we see in the few chuunin we see fight, it ain't much to begin with. Arguably his tapping into the Fox's chakra automatically puts him well above that league anyway. Then, like you said, we have the Gaara fight for which he definitely deserved a promotion.<br><br> Sasuke apparently proved himself to be a chunnin worthy ninja according to the toothpick guy but for some reason didn't get promoted. <br>Would this also mean Lee was on the chuunin level, combat-wise? All Sausage did was copy his shit and throw in an elemental attack.<br>Also the promotions were seemingly decided by Tsunade. When she got back Sasuke was still out cold, got into a fight with Naruto right after getting a little bit better and endangered the life of a teammate to whom he might have become a superior officer of through reckless behaviour, was insubordinate to his own superior officer, then shortly deserted afterwards. Hardly the most promotion-ready picture the little faggot could have painted of himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>teenage girls don't dress like that</br>  <br>You know, every time the plot isn't about the Uchihas or they are never mention. The quality of the manga goes straight up.<br><br>If you take out the Uchihas, will Naruto be better?</br></br></br>  <br>But Madara was the only good thing about the entire war arc.</br>  <br>It looks a fair bit more fashionable than her clothes before as well, possibly a nice hint at how much more confident she is now and more secure in her femininity as a frequent flyer.<br>Also as long as she can pull it off, she is free to wear it.</br></br>  <br>Kishimoto has said that he deliberately designs Hinata to not be stylish. He says she's the type of girl to not really care about clothing that much, unlike this slut.</br>  <br>uh<br>how old is sarada again?</br></br>  <br>old enough</br>  <br>that looks more suburban mom than teenage girl<br><br>the shorts and boots combo is off, but she was never particularly stylish</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like Hinata's new outfit. it does a neat combo of something bulky to hide her assets with and clothing that would not obstruct movement/you could hide shit in them.<br>She looks considerably less retired in that, although not too overly in mission gear either. Do we actually know what she does these days?</br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure she's a full time housewife, which I don't mind, since Himawari is still young<br><br>Ino is the only kunoichi that is still going on missions for sure</br></br></br>  wait so no guy vs madara today?<br><br>what the fuck</br></br>  <br>those hips and thighs<br>but the fbi</br></br>  <br>I wonder who took Shikamaru's place, since she's still on a team with Chouji and Shikamaru would not have any time, like Naruto or probably even less.<br>Come to think of it Bolt's fight against the little Shikamaru clone could be interesting on the grounds that they are the two most father-deprived characters, due to both of them having to spend most of their time running Konoha. (Sausage does not count, he's Sarada's father in blood only.) They could have some interesting banter about that before fighting.</br></br>  <br>Pokemon is having some special double episode, apparently.<br>We'll get a single episode next week, then a double episode pre-movie filler about Bolt/what is inherited if I recall correctly. Could be wrong, though.</br></br>  <br> SP putting post ending filler  <br> We aren't even near to Kaguya fight </br></br>  <br>The better question is what the fuck were Ino and Chouji doing that Chouji needed to pull out his ultimate technique?<br><br>In these times of peace a single kid with a sharingan is enough to get the hokage off his office and join one of the most powerful beings in the world in a mission when he barely has time for his own family yet apparently Chouji also got into a huge fight.</br></br></br>  <br>And we're also getting to fight Kaguya in NUNS4 well, well before she will show up in the anime, with some the Last and Burrito movie content already confirmed to be in-game.</br>  <br>Then who is Sarada's real father? Shizune?</br>  <br>Could be some natural disaster where he was needed to halt a landslide or something.</br>    <br>Naruto is probably the only actually male father figure she had. I mean she decides her life goal based on a head-pat and an afternoon of hanging out. in some ways that's on kid Naruto's level of emotional abandonment.<br> And now she isn't even best girl anymore, probably stuck as the useless medic with a retard strength punch that never gets anything done, the poor girl. </br></br>  <br>Do you guys really get that upset when female characters are delegated to supporting roles in combat? Regardless of the genre, I don't judge a female character by how many fights they get to win. And these stories are written for boys, after all.</br>  <br> Do you guys really get that upset when female characters are delegated to supporting roles in combat <br>Not really. I just think Sarada deserves better than being slotted into a specific role that has a history of being dull and useless.<br>Shame we never see Team Guy fight as a unit, I'd love to have seen 10/10 guiding/herding enemies to a place where Neji and Lee can get them, providing covering fire and whatnot. Or Ino's role in her team was pretty damn good.<br>It's just Sakura and her role that is shit and Sarada should be above being stuck as someone like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> useless medic with a retard strength punch that never gets anything done <br><br>She's one of the two next gen kids Kishi gives a shit about, if she's an useless jobber then everyone else minus Burrito are even worse.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty moot anyway unless we get a Nardo GT to begin with. The film obviously focuses on Bolt, shafting the rest of the cast his age.</br>  <br><br>There are only two enemies anyway, and Salad already got to do something cool in the Gaiden. Plus, she's obviously going to start off the movie stronger than him, like Sasuke was towards Naruto.</br></br>  <br> Shame we never see Team Guy fight as a unit <br><br>There was an entire manga about it<br><br>It was jokeish, but Kishi liked it enough to tie it back in the main series a bit. We see them take on more of their comedic roles during the last arc. Also he did some official designs for that manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Plus, she's obviously going to start off the movie stronger than him, like Sasuke was towards Naruto. <br>Not sure about that. He is already stated to be a prodigy, and it's safe to guess that Naruto taught him the Rasengan, which beats super punches that never hit.</br></br>  <br>She's going to nag Bolt about the Hokage position and fade away.</br>  <br>There was very little of them actually fighting, and fighting group on group, though, wasn't there?<br><br>Also this makes me wonder whether Hinata's 4 palm defense thing made it into canon or semi-canon at least. It was created for a filler arc, but was included in her moveset for the games (which Kishi said are better than the manga and anime) and in the Lee spinoff.</br></br></br>  <br>64 palm, rather.</br>  <br>She mastered the whole 64 palms normal thing during the war. Lion palms, net defense thing, they're all real enough. Maybe the net was easier than the real 64 palms, or maybe it was just more her style.<br><br>There was that chapter where Neji confronted the cloud village for that whole thing where they killed his Dad I think. This felt like it actually touched on the characters a bit more than normal.<br><br>Also the last chapter where Lee wanted to prove that hard work really did mean something. Maybe even the chapter where TenTen had to fill in for Tsunade.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived <br>Truly, Kishimoto's greatest quote.</br></br>  <br> She mastered the whole 64 palms normal thing during the war <br>That was a combination of the Twin Lions with the 64 palm, not the basic technique as I recall.</br></br>  <br>she did normal 64p against one of the mini-jyubi mooks, then showed her powering up lion hands and saying she was gonna do the combo, before cutting to one of the other K11.<br>readers are left to assume she pulled it off, but there is never any verification one way or the other.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she could only go up to 32 palms before that. Might sound lame but she's shown to have skill more than most Hyuuga at that rate.<br><br>Even the adults can't get up to Neji's level when he was a child in some ways, he was a true genius. He's like a chess prodigy that's better than almost anyone by nature, except without the chess part.<br><br>After that point she can combine it with lion palms, but Hinata after mastering the 64 strikes could finally stand on the same level as Neji, thus showing hard work can achieve things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>KISHIMOTO CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT</br>  <br> On the other hand the exams are disrupted, it would be unfair to half the competitors if they just called it quits after they got Naruto back <br>Actually, the way they worded it it sounded like Bort vs. Shika was the final match.</br></br>  <br>I love how Junko's quote is basically "HIMAWARI IS CUTE! CUTE!"</br>  <br> the fuck is this <br> the fuck is that </br></br>  <br> After that point she can combine it with lion palms <br>Shame she never did shit with it.</br></br>  <br> Must be going through a mid-life crisis <br>Or she just doesn't age.</br></br>  <br>What this guy said<br/></br>  <br>We probably won't know that though. The editor told Kishi to add Sauce and pink because he felt there needed to be a love triangle in there. <br><br>Without those two, you're more or less just left with the bare ninja concept with no Uchiha.

I'd say they are shit enough to do it, but the Hyuuga sisters filler makes me actually have some hope for them.<br>I'd love to see a bit of more genuinely happy family time between Naruto and Bolt before him becoming the Hokage and being less able to spend time with him, to give more weight to Bolt's frustration the same way the sisters filler built up Hanabi's and Hinata's relationship to give that more weight.</br></br></br>  <br>It's good to see she's still enthusiastic about the series.</br>  <br>Why would there be one? She's not even a ninja yet.</br>  <br> Where did you get that from? </br>  <br>I'm presuming anon is speculating a mutual envy of Bolt spending time with either.</br>  <br>sunflower starts getting jealous of her big brother's attention drifting elsewhere.<br> constantly trying to rip out salad eyeballs with her bare hands </br></br>  <br> hiwamari vs sarada rivalry <br>Over what?</br></br>  <br> built up Hanabi's and Hinata's relationship to give that more weight. <br><br>It's more that they had to do it because there was no relationship between them in the manga or anime at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the fact that she beat her elder sister was established already, but nothing much beyond it.<br>Gotta give them credit, though, they managed to really make something of Hanabi.</br></br>  <br>The only thing Sarada is going to be jealous of is Bort stealing daddy away from her.</br>  Sharingan is a babby power; you don't need to actually train to evolve your sharingan, just cry a lot until you get MS via TRAUMA and then switch them up with your sibling for EMS.  <br>Hinata a best<br>Naruto a retard<br>Sakura a retard<br>Sasuke a edgelord<br> mfw hagoromo basically says "you guys are fucking retarded; I'm out" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  not including best uchiha checking kage in sensei-student lineup <br><br>for shame.<br>also, except for jiraiya (who should have been 5th), literally every hokage after the 2nd was the student of a prior hokage.<br>konoha apparently DGAF about nepotism</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What else? Uzumaki dick.</br></br>  <br>Nardo is okay for a shonen protag, but has some really, really low points when talking about Sausage due to Kishi being unfamiliar with basic human emotions.</br>  <br>Well, it does say she has a "strange relationship" with her father.<br><br><br> Gotta give them credit, though, they managed to really make something of Hanabi <br>I hope we get to see her in the movie.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> hinata saves narutard's life <br> hinata confesses <br> narutard says "okay" and runs off to chase his boyfriend </br></br></br>  <br>It's an old picture. By then Tobirama was just a water guy related to the wood guy.<br><br> konoha apparently DGAF about nepotism <br><br>It's mostly because writers always prefer the main characters to be related to other important characters. Of course Kishi is going to have Kakashi's sensei be the 4th hokage over some random literally who.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he thinks love and peace will sve the world and is too idealistic for his own doing and never has to face consequencess or has taken any tough descisions that has lead to people die. hes amoralfag to the highest degree</br>  Someone translated the lyrics to Diver into English, or rather, engrish:<br><br>Always a Even now<br>We signed a perfectly real<br>Go taking off Even now<br>It takes one step forward and also the sun rises today<br>I wish such different should the yesterday of his<br>You will do not me why noticed<br>Aching dissatisfaction was recruited is in the mind<br>Also only thing never seen<br>Also only ones never heard<br>It’s reflected in this blue eyes<br>Shadow which runs far beyond Even always a now<br>And because I’m not just waiting Even I<br>Always a now Even We signed a perfectly real<br>Go taking off Even now<br>I was stepping Jidanda to be recognized like<br>Is there chagrin that can not be in words<br>Enough to hope if Negae want to become stronger<br>Resulting in idle<br>Even scary thing wearing rough is Tsuyoga~tsu in Tsuyoga~tsu<br>Without Nevertheless favorite also scared laughing<br>Mood can be well Even unpleasant without spear whiz<br>We would wait for useless Even us<br>The habit courage anymore<br>Also in baked too defeated<br>This will result not in spilled tears<br>Among the anxiety and the machining of spiral<br>Imperceptibly day had sunset<br>Go with me spelling if rain Even received Even wind or<br>And go jump I could do Even I<br>Always a Even now<br>We signed a perfectly real<br>I was flying Even now<br>I wonder if visible or used<br>Defeated throat this Even<br>I wanted what you craved<br>And for now it is here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's the Jap text.<br>いつだって今だって<br>僕らはちゃんと実を結んで<br>今だって飛び立って行く <br>今日も日が昇ると一歩踏み出す<br>昨日の自分とは違うはずなのにな <br>どうして気づいてくれないんだろう <br>募った不満が心の中でうずく<br>見た事ないものばかりでも <br>聞いた事ないものばかりでも<br>この青い目に映るのは <br>いつだって今だって遠く向こう走る影 <br>僕だってただ待っているわけじゃないから<br>いつだって今だって僕らはちゃんと実を結んで<br>今だって飛び立って行く<br>認められたいと地団駄踏んでたんだ<br>言葉に出来ない悔しさがそこにある <br>強くなりたいと願えば願うほど <br>空回りしてしまう<br>強がって強がって怖いもの着ラフだって<br>また笑って怖がって本命は言えないまま<br>やりなくて嫌だってうまく出来が気分やりて<br>ダメだってたちを待ってしまう<br>度胸もうないくせに<br>負けすぎやいでまた<br>涙こぼしてこの果てない<br>不安と加工の渦巻きの中<br>いつの間にか日が暮れてた<br>雨だって風だって受けまなら綴んでいく<br>僕だってやれるって飛び込んで行け<br>いつだって今だって<br>僕らはちゃんと実を結んで<br>今だって飛びだった<br>使ったか見えるかな<br>どこれだって敗れだって<br>欲しがったものがった<br>今はここにあるのさ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not saying it wasn't retarded, but one, it does stand on the level of your typical shounen hero's density and two, his having next to no decent human relationships for the first 12 years of his life, no real experience of what love is and having a low enough self esteem to misunderstand what she said as something non-romantic is somewhat justified.<br>At least the other shoe eventually dropped.</br></br>  <br>In the end this a shonen battle manga with an author that doesn't give a shit about romance, gets embarassed when he does it and ends up following it with hundreds of chapters of nonstop brotherly homolust.<br><br>He wasn't ever planning to have Naruto acknowledge the confession nor him dating Hinata at any point during the manga. If it had been left up to him he would have just shown the endgame couple babies in 700 and proceed with Boruto's daddy issues.</br></br></br>  <br>He did face Neji dying for him and Hinata, all but shattering his resolve, and he had an interesting bit of being annoyed by the villagers suddenly liking him after fearing and shunning him while he was a child.</br>  <br>he still has a boy mindset about morality. if faced with the choice of battle in sacrificing 100 people to save another 100 or sacrifice 100 to gain ground or whatnot he would say i will save them all instead of thinking critically.</br>  <br> he still has a boy mindset about morality <br>Agreed.<br> if faced with the choice of battle in sacrificing 100 people to save another 100 or sacrifice 100 to gain ground or whatnot he would say i will save them all instead of thinking critically <br>The series was never meant to address stuff like that, although the general story could have used something along those lines, especially with him wanting to be the head of government. The genre and its fanbase would not tolerate it and the author hasn't got the skill or will to make it work.<br><br>I mean, just recall the shit Rossiou got for making a string of rational, utilitarian decisions but doing so in a universe where the size of your balls and willingness to defy logic will pretty much reshape how the universe works around your retardation and make it work. On a far, far smaller scale, powerlevel and general worth of the story itself, but Naruto could not stomach someone like that in very much the same way.<br>The closest we get is Danzo, a cowardly, self-absorbed fuckwit who achieved nothing.<br>What you want goes against not only the very idea of the show you are making a point about, or genre conventions, but arguably the dominant tone of the very medium.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto is the jobber.</br>  <br><br>Aging is for commoners.</br></br>  <br>The jobber is the villain stronger than Kaguya that gets killed by a 12 year old.</br>  <br>You know, Bolt could turn out shit or pretty decent, but if he'll actually have the balls to legit kill a villain I will be pleased with the cheeky little bastard.<br>His father never so much as killed anyone, did he?</br></br>  <br><br>But saying that Naruto should have been promoted to a higher ranking because of the sand invasion incident is like saying a kid should get an A+ on a test and move on to the next grade because he managed to survive a school shooting.</br></br>  <br>100% Boruto doesn't beat it, same for Sarada. Boruto will just get strong enough to hit Naruto seriously for the first time, which happens near the end. Obviously to defeat space ninjas, you will only see Naruto and Sasuke doing the heavylifting, but everyone else can face mooks. There are 2 big aliens so 1 for each of the Jesus Ninjas. <br><br>Everything about white Zetsu and the space alien shit was the most ridiculous asspull in Naruto</br></br></br>  <br> but if he'll actually have the balls to legit kill a villain I will be pleased with the cheeky little bastard <br>Why would he spare the giant moon ayylien who just tried to rip Kurama out of his dad's ass and kill all his friends? <br><br>Also if this thing he's making is anything like a Rasenshuriken dis nigga's dead. Also he turns into a giant monster which is all the more reason to straight-up murder him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the test is about surviving school shootings then yeah, he should get an A+</br>  Music video for Diver's finally here. <br> http://www.jpopsuki.tv/video/KANA-<wbr>BOON---Diver/a17ff924d71acb99357f1a<wbr>88450f6b67?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_m<wbr>edium=twitter</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br> Everything about white Zetsu and the space alien shit was the most ridiculous asspull in Naruto <br><br>It's like everything about Kaguya and the sage's brother were last minute asspuls in order to have plots for the romantic movie and the father/son movie.</br></br></br>  <br> got to kill a god with Sauce and Nardo <br> got to wear nardo's part 1 jacket <br> got to wear sauce's slashed headband <br>Salad is never going to hear the end of this is she?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto is a legit prodigy like this granddad. He can do shadow clones, rasengan, and chidori, and probably a whole bunch of other shit.<br><br>It's also debatable to say that Naruto himself could have been a prodigy if he didn't have Kurama messing up his chakra flow.</br></br></br>  <br>Demonstrating the skills to take out the main piece of an invasion plan against your homeland ought to earn you a promotion, especially if your current rank slots you with greenhorns who barely know which end of the kunai to hold.<br>Really, the most crucial mistake the series makes is having a grand total of three ranks in a mercenary state.</br></br>  <br> Boruto is a legit prodigy like this granddad <br>But will he be like Minato "Putting a Kunai in Every Kumo" Namikaze?</br></br>  <br>If you take the recent filler as canon (which I don't) then Neji got a double promotion just because he happened to be around to save Gaara's ass from some faggot with a guitar.<br><br>And team 8 all made chunnin despite losing to joke characters.</br></br></br>  <br>If Jiraiya or Kakashi bothered to adopt him he could have turned out to be pretty fucking good, probably. But then Kishi would not have gotten to project his having been shite at school at him.</br>  <br> Boruto grows up to be a kumo-killing badass <br>Maybe he does have a bit of Hyuuga blood after all.</br></br>  <br> the most crucial mistake the series makes is having a grand total of three ranks in a mercenary state <br> a fresh out of the academy grunt is only 3 positions away from the head of state <br>Yeah, that's pretty dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>He's already starting off with that Yurui kid. Probably singled him out because his granddaddy was a one-man genocide machine.</br>  <br> If you take the recent filler as canon (which I don't) then Neji got a double promotion just because he happened to be around to save Gaara's ass from some faggot with a guitar. <br>Then three months later Nardo retrieves the Kazekage from a terrorist organisation and is the key person thanks to whom he can be revived, an achievement completely ignored.<br>Fun times.</br></br></br>  <br>His other grandaddy was a dab hand at kumo killing himself.</br>  <br>And then Hiruzen told him to kill himself for doing that.</br>  <br> Hiashi almost starts a war by killing Kumo fuckers <br> Minato ends a war by killing Kumo fuckers <br>POTTERY</br></br></br>  <br>Right, but the whole point of being promoted to a chunin is that you've shown leadership skills. Being a leader does't just mean you take on all the responsibility of the mission and only do the mission yourself. You have to know your team and know or at the very least have a strong belief of what they're capable of and based upon those judgments you lead them accordingly. Naruto may have been the reason that Gaara was saved, but throughout that entire arc he showed zero leadership skills which is what it takes to be promoted to chunin</br>  <br>if you mean the fandoms, I agree</br>  <br>Does this mean that Bort's going to wipe out the Cloud niggers once and for all?</br>  <br> not blonde nor a nigga <br><br>He was probably just some hobo the raikage picked up on the way to Konoha.</br></br></br>  <br>It bothered me the Cloud was ever forgiven for that.</br>  <br><br>Hiruzen's expression says "Oh yeah. Whoops. Forgot about that one."</br></br>  <br> Kishimoto: "That's right. But Sakura is addicted to Sasuke." (laugh) "The reason why Hinata came to like Naruto is clear, but I've deliberately avoided writing down the reason why Sakura came to like Sasuke." (laugh) "That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived." <br>how are ss fags taking this?</br></br>  <br>And Hiashi was forgiven for treating his daughter like a pile of shit after she nearly got kidnapped as a baby and for kicking Nedgy out of the house and never giving a fuck about him after his brother gave his life for him.</br>  <br>If only Neji was promoted, and to chuunin, I'd agree with you. <br>As is, everyone gets promoted as a participation award.</br></br>  <br>Man fuck that filler.</br>  <br>the usual, bashing hinata and nh, deflecting, claimiing this is good for them, etc</br>  <br>I could have dealt with the deal of everyone getting promoted but only if we saw some great Stage 3 fights.<br>Then the fuckers go and cut the whole thing short so they can do another filler about Coolest fucking Guy.</br></br>  <br>How do you even properly judge leadership through individual fights?<br><br>A lot of this stuff doesn't make sense. Shikamaru got hailed for giving up when he had no chance of winning in his fight and Naruto got hailed for not giving up in the written exam when he knew he had no chance in hell of passing the test.</br></br></br>  <br>Who could stay mad at him?</br>  <br><br> Cloud niggers try and kidnap Himawari because she's Kushina's granddaughter and Hinata's daughter and that's what they do <br> Bort does the whole village in retaliation </br></br></br>  <br>If I were a betting man I'd say the shipperfag explanation of it would be 'preserving the mystery' of it, or some shit.<br>Not gonna delve into wherever they hang out, but I'm fairly sure that's the best they can come up with.</br></br>  <br>Butthurt.</br>  <br>Hope someone makes the effort to update the Hall.</br>  <br> &gt;Bort does the whole village in retaliation <br><br>Truly he is Sasuke's student</br></br></br>    Hey look someone actually done it.  <br>Whoops, wrong one.</br>  <br> Sharingan needs to be nerfed <br><br>Your high, Sage mode is what needs to be nerfed. The shit allows the user to tap into limitless amounts of power</br></br></br>  <br>The point of the tournament thing was to show how you're able to handle combat<br>Written part was just to see if you could psychologically handle the pressure.<br><br>It's not about winning or "passing". It's more about how you're able deal with those kinds of situations in the ninja world.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "I like Itachi, Itachi is just such a good person, till it had me in tears (laughs)" <br><br> "Kishi: Your line makes me happy. Although he is a really good person, he had to act the villain until the end. I didn't draw Itachi's true feelings until the end on purpose. So when the truth is revealed, everyone would be shocked. Although Itachi is a really hard-to-describe/complicated character, I did drew out some pretty good scenes of him." <br><br>Kishi's love for his Uchiha husbandos is probably the only thing holding him on to this manga anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The implication is that he softened up on her and started teaching her techniques. The data book says her lion palm thing is something only the head family learns.<br><br>Really, Kishimoto is the one who shouldn't be forgiven for dropping the ball with the Hyuuga in Part II.</br></br></br>  <br>What would they do anymore? Nedgy's issues and the slavery stuff got resolved and Kishi only sees Hinata as a love interest character.</br>   Kishi interview shoots SScucks in the legs by saying SS is so bad that Kishi could never write a reason for Sakura to like Sasuke without it being contrived <br> SShits response is to shit on Hinata and plug their ears <br>Like clockwork.</br></br>  <br>No, it is fine as one of the uppermost levels of power attainable in that setting. <br>Getting it involves being pretty fucking powerful to start with, taking huge risks, learning to control yourself on a whole other level, becoming one with nature and its use is pretty damn limited. <br>It also does what it is supposed to do by its description, instead of being an eyeball that spawns massive laser skeletons and supplies whatever power the plot needs yo to have.</br></br></br>  <br> What would they do anymore? Nedgy's issues and the slavery stuff got resolved <br>How about not show that stuff off screen?<br><br>And how about giving Byakugan equal footing with the other eye hax?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man I never really liked the eyehax but the Tenseigan had a pretty weak design.</br>  Wait the movie badguys are really more powerful that Kaguya?. <br>I mean, I can understand that they would be more competent, but Bunny was so much broken for the series.</br>  <br> And how about giving Byakugan equal footing with the other eye hax? <br><br>Two main characters and a villain stronger than Orochimaru had the sharingan while only two side characters had the byakugan.<br><br>The sharingan was always going to end up as the superior eyehax.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than this dumb shit.</br>  <br> Wait the movie badguys are really more powerful that Kaguya?. <br>Yes and no. They're a threat that Kaguya felt necessary to create an army for. Transformed Momo is probably going to be on her level in terms of raw power.</br></br>  <br>On the contrary I liked every Mangekyou design except Sauce and Shisui's. Mostly because they deviated from the whole "take three tomoe and do something funky with them" theme the other eyes had.<br><br>But yeah, Shin's was pretty lazy. Then again so was his ability.</br></br></br>  <br>At least it should have been a cool new power-up and not just a blue Jesus mode.</br>  <br>What we do know is that Sausage said there's some people out there more dangerous than Kaguya whose tracks and signs can only be seen by his sharinnegan so he has to be left the fuck alone to wander the forests and totally investigate the fuck out of this.<br>Then we have a movie with two seemingly Kaguya-species villains.</br></br>  <br>Unicorn-dick mode was also pretty stupid too. Good thing I didn't watch The Last to see fights, otherwise I'd be sorely disappointed in the climax.</br>  <br> hey kid you wanna /ss/ </br>  <br>So basically Naruto was a bad main character that spent his time looking for butt buddies instead of living that ninja life like sauce</br>  <br>You can say that, yeah. But there's so many different kinds of ninja lifestyles in Naruto so there's no objective way to live like a ninja.</br>  <br> Bolt eventually gets Byakugan <br> inevitably gains a Tenseigan <br> tries to go full power, sees himself in a mirror <br> Daaaaaad, Moooooom, why did you have to get me the lamest battle aura <br> I bet Sarada will show off with a full Susanoo tomorrow at school <br> Daaaaaad, can I borrow your demon, pleeease </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Daaaaaad, can I borrow your demon, pleeease <br>Actually, that raises a valuable question. Does Bort even have Kurama's chakra? He has the whiskers that come with it, doesn't he?</br></br>    <br>Probably retained some.<br><br>Where's that post of Kurama giving Naruto instructions on sex?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably not, just a little genetic marker from Naruto being surrounded by Kurama's chakra from the moment of his conception.<br>But a thread a few weeks ago had a neat idea about him having a more or less powerless little fragment of Kurama being there with him, to be the Hobbes to Bolt's Calvin.</br></br>  <br> that part 1 nardo and bordo <br>Damn. Now I want an RtN-type thing so we can see those two meet.</br></br>  <br> All he did was copy Rock Lee <br><br>Right, but unlike Lee he also had Sharingan buff, tactical prowess, and two elements, which, generally only jounin have. If you want to say he wasn't there from a maturity point of view because he unraveled after the itachi meet up, cool. But from a power point of view he was there since right before the exams</br></br></br>  <br><br>If he does have any it'd be neat if he could take on his father's feral appearance when angry.</br></br>  <br> Naruto and Bolt go full fox mode as they debate whether they should go for Ichiraku ramen or burgers </br>  <br>Honestly I hope there'll be someone smart enough in the future to realize the comedic potential of that fact. Nurudu compares his love of ramen to his love for Hinata and Burudu doesn't seem to care for ramen that much, preferring burgers like a true American.<br><br>If they don't clash over that it'll be bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Then, rather than being nerfed, Sharingan ought to have been written as an ability you needed to learn how to control and how to evolve, rather than MUH DARKNESS POWERS ME UP.<br><br>Both abilities are stupidly powerful to really retarded extents, that simply shows Kishimoto was unable to finish fights in clever ways, as it was always either a power up, or some secret super powerful technique.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Daily reminder than Sakura's "feelings" for Sasuke are no more unique than the feelings of every other fangirl he had. She was just lucky to be placed on the same team as him</br></br>  <br>naruto realy married best girl</br>  <br> both of them meets <br> starts to beat the shit out of him for chasing the pinkshit and not recognizing Hinata's love for him </br></br>  <br>Yeah. Her love is so deep that Kishi can't write about it otherwise it'll seem contrived.</br>  <br> if you won't fuck my mom then I will </br>  <br>You know even though it was revealed she really was Sarada's mom I don't know why she was so evasive about her questions. <br>She could've just said "I was with your dad out of the village and he's gone on a mission" or some shit</br></br>  <br>Seems like a load of bullshit for the guy that hails SasuNaru as a beautiful BFFship and Coolest Guy/Rin as pure love.</br>  <br> She could've just said "I was with your dad out of the village and he's gone on a mission" or some shit <br>Or, you know, Shizune could have said it. Or Sauce. Or Nardo.<br><br>Dammit Kishi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sarada never asked Sakura about her birth only Shizune. What she asked Sakura was if she and Sasuke were really married.<br><br>But ultimately the real answer for all the secrets and nobody talking to each other is that otherwise the plot and the drama would have been resolved in just one chapter.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Bort finding out his dad's a total faggot loser when nardo probably told him the same bullshit that he told Salad and Chouchou  <br>I'd watch it.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember when Kakashi said Sakura's feelings matured way beyond a childish crush and how beautiful was her love for the sauce? Kakashi is the average SSfag</br>  <br>Isn't Kakashi the last person you should seek for romantic advice? He's like /a/ if /a/ killed every girl who was ever interested in him.</br>  <br><br> back to the future with ninja </br></br>  <br>He probably meant Sasuke was Chunin level in terms of combat profiency and he didn't get promoted because he wasn't mature enough to handle leading missions or something</br>  <br> Bort stages an event to get nardo and Hinata to notice each other <br> goes back to the future as a 20 year old man </br></br>  <br> people mistake him for the 9 Tails Jinchuuriki and start shitting on him <br> he kicks their asses and causes a general ruckus in the village <br> nardo and co are sent to check it out <br> hijinks ensue  <br><br> meanwhile Sauce interrogates the fuck out of Salad for being a surviving Uchiha <br> Sakura thinks she's trying to steal her Sasuke-kun and starts being a bitch to her </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you hear that ? are the tears of narusaku fans who are still criying and are delicious</br>  <br><br>Orochimaru is Dr Brown, Kabuto is Einstein, but what would the DeLorean be?</br></br>  <br>This pretty much confirms what I thought, Kishi has no clue how to write normal interactions between Sasuke and Sakura because they never had any. <br><br> Which is probably why Hinata doesn't show up either </br></br></br>  <br>A toad summon.</br>  <br> and ching chong chang for you to anon </br>  <br>Kakashi is the president of sasusaku fanclub. How the fuck kakashi could ship that unhealthy relationship, what a faggot</br>  <br>He has done a 2 page bit of Naruto and Hinata going to a date.<br>Romantic or not he really can't do any fluff or low key stuff. With Shikamaru probably being Naruto's best actual friend, Kiba and Lee there could be plenty of material for them just hanging out between missions, but the only time he's ever done anything of the sort it was a short bit to promote Road to Ninja.<br><br>The difference between those and SS is that the first category Kishi could make but won't because the embarrassment gives him heart attacks, whereas the second he just can't imagine how it would actually happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> How the fuck kakashi could ship that unhealthy relationship, what a faggot <br>see<br/></br></br>  <br> Boruto does shittalk no justu against Naruto about he cant beat Orochimaru and cant bring back Sauce while he brags about taking down the 2 moon demi-god <br> Meanwhile Dadruto went to Jiraiya to tell what he accomplished </br></br>  <br> Sakura thinks she's trying to steal her Sasuke-kun and starts being a bitch to her <br>The best part is knowing that she'd fucking do it too.</br></br>  <br>Part 1 nardo vs. Bort would be a fun fight no doubt. I mean, nardo would probably get his ass kicked unless he drew on Kurama's power, but it'd still be an interesting fight.<br><br>Despite Kishi's immeasurable fuckups there's still a lot of potential still in this series. I wonder if someone with the vision to realize it might take over in the future. I don't see nardo dying anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair she'd have every right to panic. She lucked out against Ino and Sarada was a contender for best girl of her generation.</br>  <br>I imagine Kishi hyperventilated and fainted multiple times while drawing this.</br>  <br>I'm really unsure whether it would be good for the series to get either a Naruto GT with the kids, or some Last era stories from SP. <br>On the one hand the Hyuuga sisters arc and a few of the filler episodes they made were pretty good stuff. <br>On the other the vast majority of the filler episodes are either irredeemable shit from the filler hell or fellating Coolest Guy.</br></br></br>  <br> Boruto is the one who saves Hinata from the bullies instead of Naruto <br> She ends up falling for Boruto instead <br> Boruto has to get Hinata to love Naruto to prevent himself from being erased from the timeline </br></br></br>  <br> I wonder if someone with the vision to realize it might take over in the future <br>If those happen to be the same people in charge of the fillers don't get your hopes up.</br></br>  <br>How much of a best girl does Hima can be?<br>Damn, that smile.</br></br>  <br> you can pinpoint the exact frame her cake breaks in two </br>  <br> has only love for Boruto <br> good daughteru <br> understands her dad while Bort smashes her cake  <br> Endures like a true shinobi <br>2 panels, 30 seconds of screentime, and she's already the best girl of her generation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's actually really cute. Shame the series didn't have more of this shit going on.<br><br><br>Let SP animate the Gaiden and then have a miniseries/OVA/movie every so often if whoever's in charge has a cool idea for nurudu.<br><br>Just don't have another 700+ chapters of bullshit for the new generation. I mean, who the fuck are they going to fight anyway? Aliens?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Always sweet to his little sister <br>Yes! Incest route, make it happen Kishi</br></br>  <br>Not bad. Not bad at all.<br><br>Josh I needs to take a break and put out some more naruto in a few years. Do some side baseball manga or whatever and bring back something good. Time skip and all.</br></br></br>  <br>Kishi* <br><br>Fucking Josh, great spell correct.</br></br></br>  <br> shit dad can't shadow clone at all <br> how is he going to protect mom from those faggots <br> I'll just give him a little assistance with a few clones of my own <br> fuck I overdid it <br><br> even after he fixes his mistake and comes back Hinata is a little bit more touchy feely with her special little man </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 2 panels, 30 seconds of screentime, and she's already the best girl of her generation. <br><br>So she's literally Hinata. The little screentime she gets isn't wasted.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe we might get filler where Part 1 Naruto and Sasuke vs Boruto and Sarada filler when UNS4 gets released</br>  <br> maybe we might get filler where Part 1 Naruto and Sasuke vs Boruto and Sarada filler when UNS4 gets released <br>Or they might put special dialogue in the game if you select that matchup. <br><br>But yeah, if they did a fucking episode about Mecha Naruto for Revolutions, I'm pretty sure this isn't beyond the realm of possibility. <br><br>Plus I'd give my left nut to see Salad hulk smash part 1 Pink in the face.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they did 2 fucking episode for mecha naruto<br>im sure they would do part 1 vs part 3 episode<br>also we will definelty get special dialouges</br></br></br>  <br> also we will definelty get special dialouges <br>Have CC2 ever done that before? Have we been shown any dialogue pre-battle in NUNS4??<br> Also how come there isn't a preorder for the game on Steam yet? I just want to get it out of the way. </br></br></br>  <br>sooo<br>whens The Last DVD/BD is gonna get released?</br></br>  <br> he also tried to make Sakura more popular with several things, which backfired though <br>He literally went about it in the worst possible way.</br></br>  <br> Also how come there isn't a preorder for the game on Steam yet? <br> Steam <br>Don't Storm games have shit online for PC?</br></br></br>  <br>i think there was special dialouges in UNS3 too</br>  <br>because opponent cards only shows connection reliability on but not average computer performance</br>  <br><br>They always include goofy alt content in the Storm series. I wonder what CC2 will be able to do with the New Era characters.<br><br>Also, they should eventually be available for purchase from the online store, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not much for multiplayer, so I would not know.<br>As for a promo episode, while it could be fun, what would it feature? Bolt accidentally the timeline, like above or what? Mecha Nardo was a weird enough idea to base an episode around it  and Revolution's little story segment was far better doing it anyway. , but you'd need to set up either time travel or some other shenanigans to have characters from the end of the series/Last era/Bolt era show up.</br></br>  <br>She was actually great during early part 2. But afterwards Kishi turned her back into shipping fodder and went beyond stupid with her teammates' powerlevels.</br>  <br>Sakura is an alright character without Sasuke. With Sasuke she's Pink Shit.</br>  <br>How did I not notice before how much of a manlet Burrito is?</br>  <br> the worst conclusion <br> implying </br></br>  <br> As for a promo episode, while it could be fun, what would it feature? Bolt accidentally the timeline, like above or what? <br>Orochimaru invents a time machine and invites the kids over to check it out. If they made fucking Mecha Naruto happen, they could make this happen. <br><br>Alternatively they find a Kaguya thing that opens a dimensional rift to a part 1 nurudu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nardo: 180cm <br> Sauce: 182cm <br><br> Burrito: 145cm <br> Salad: 147cm <br>Like father, like son. He's actually the shortest of his generation. I like to think he's a bit of a hothead when it comes to his less-than-impressive stature.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's right. But Sakura is addicted to Sasuke." (laugh) <br> (laugh) <br>no fucking mercy.</br></br></br>  <br>looks like its pre-order exclusive for now<br>also there was pre-order exclusive Goku costume Naruto in UNS3<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VMy<wbr>mW3lPhHg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>They said bonus, not exclusive. And I doubt they'd lock two pretty damn important characters behind a pre-order requisite and not allow you to purchase them later, especially if the Boruto movie is later incorporated into the game as DLC expansion or something.<br><br>After all, if this is truly the last Storm game, then they'll need to include the end of the series, The Last, the Gaiden and Burrito's movie.</br></br></br>  So when the countdown reaches zero <br>Will we see a new anime, manga or light novels?</br>  <br>  part 1 gets time traveled to part 3 <br>  everybody assumes part 3 adults goofing around <br>  everyone realizes the truth when they find neji is still alive <br>  hijinks ensue </br></br></br></br>  <br>Namizake "One Man Klan" Minato"</br>  <br>Naburo GT from SP formally announced</br>  <br>Who knows? The last "secret" was just a preview of the movie. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if they try and drag this shit out again. But the problem is that Kishi's given up the ghost when it comes to nurudu.</br>  <br>The safe bet is a Nardo GT of some sort or Kishi announcing he's retiring for good, possibly handing the reigns over to someone.<br>Unlikely but feasible is Kishi starting on either a brand new manga or a part 3 with the kids.<br>While the novels I bothered to read were fun, new ones would not make much noise.</br></br></br>  <br>God that would be wonderful to see that trainwreck animated. <br><br><br> everyone realizes the truth when they find neji is still alive <br> Bort meeting his soon to be dead uncle Neji and knowing the truth <br>damn son</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DLC storymode of the last and boruto movie for UNS4</br>  You Narutard will discuss over anything<br> Which one came first? </br>  <br> everybody assumes part 3 adults goofing around <br> Hinata has to get rushed to the hospital after Bort calls her mom <br><br><br> While the novels I bothered to read were fun <br>They were kinda nice. Be interesting to see them adapted into miniseries of their own if SP runs out of ideas.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Possible, but that seems like something CC2 would announce, not Kishi, and it certainly isn't enough to be a "secret announcement" deserving of a fucking countdown. <br><br><br>Jesus fucking Christ what am I supposed to be looking at?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ashura's Avatar and Indra's Susanoo</br>  <br>The Gaara and Shikamaru ones had enough action to be made into proper 2-4 episode long stories. Konoha Hiden is mostly ftuff and would get either massively condensed or expanded like no one's business with a whole episode for each character.</br>  <br> dadruto, bort, hima, hinata and hiashi cries when seeing neji go back to part 1 <br>  whole part 1's memories got erased everyone's when they got teleported back <br>  except Neji's </br></br></br>  I kind of want to see the kids doing missions in anew anime like Db Super  <br>Erased when they*</br>  <br>The only way he tried to make Sakura more popular was to draw her prettier when he should have given her more character development outside of Team 7.<br>I used to like Sakura and it was always frustrating how she kept saying she was going to do something to help Naruto and Sasuke, but she always ended up getting sidelined or embarrassed. She never really did anything other than heal them when they already settled the important stuff.</br></br>   ――親になったナルトを描いてみて、難しい点はありましたか？ <br><br> (Interviewer) ―― Was there a difficult aspect when you were trying to depict Naruto when he became a parent? <br><br> 岸本：そこまで難しくはなかったです。大人になったナルトも、今の僕みた<wbr>いなものなので。僕も仕事ばっかり で息子に全然会えないんです。つまり今回の映画は、自分の私生活をさらけ出<wbr>してる内容なんですよ（笑）。ボ ルトもそうですが、子供は構ってあげられない大人の事情を理解しにくいので<wbr>。逆もまたそうです が。</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br> Kishi: It wasn’t difficult to an extent. It’s because when Naruto became an adult, he became someone who’s also similar to who I am now. Since I also have nothing but work, I can’t meet with my son at all. So in other words, the contents of this movie exposes my own private life (Laughs). However, even Boruto seems to reflect it. It’s difficult for a child to understand the circumstances of an adult who can’t look after them. But the converse of that (also seems to be true: //it’s difficult for an adult to understand the circumstances of a child who can’t be looked after).  <br><br> ――「事情があるから、構ってあげられないんだよ？」 という息子さんへのメッセージ？  <br><br> (Interviewer) ――” Because I have circumstances, I can’t look after you” Is that a message to your son? <br><br> 岸本：メッセージというより、言い訳（笑）。親には親なりの、息子には息<wbr>子なりの考え方があるということを 知ってほしいです。もちろん、それだけじゃないですけどね！！（笑）</wbr> <br><br> Kishi: Rather than a message, it’s an excuse (Laugh). As his parent, there’s his parent’s perspective; As my son, there’s my son’s perspective. I want him to understand (both of them). But of course, that’s not the only thing!! (Laugh).  <br><br><br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> part 3 characters close to Neji travel back in time <br> they see him, want to have a nice heart to heart <br> he's still in his edgy asshole phase <br> Naruto has to go and beat up a dead man and one of the most stand-up niggas he ever knew just so they can talk for 5 minutes </br></br></br></br>  <br>At least Kishi is aware of how shallow it is. For awhile I thought he was trying to pass it off as a deep and speshul kind of love.</br>  <br>But that's dumb. <br><br><br>If there's one thing nardo needs it's more fluff.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ――最後にWJ読者ヘメッセージを！！ <br><br> Interviewer: Lastly, leave a message to the readers of Weekly Shounen Jump!! <br><br> 谷口：僕らも今から映画が楽しみです。絶対に面白いと思いますし、僕らの<wbr>曲も含め、映画を楽しんでもらえた ら嬉しいです。</wbr> <br><br> Taniguchi: We’re also looking forward to the movie from here onwards. We think that it’s absolutely interesting. Since it even includes our song, we would be happy if you could also enjoy the movie. <br><br> 岸本：今回の映画では、できる限りのことをすべてやり尽くしました。自分<wbr>でも面白い作品ができたなと思って おります。ぜひ親子で見に来ていただきたいです！</wbr> <br><br> Kishi: I was completely devoted to everything that I could possibly do for this movie. Personally, even I thought that it was an interesting work that I had completed. Certainly, I want parents and their children to come and see it! <br><br> Interviewer：ありがとうございました！ <br><br> Interviewer: Thank you very much! <br><br>2/2</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kishi's really fucked in the head, living out his own life problems through his characters.<br>He could have spent almost a year by now just with his family instead of making a film about not being able to see them.</br></br>  <br> For awhile I thought he was trying to pass it off as a deep and speshul kind of love <br>He does in-universe but pretty much admitted in the interview that it's bullshit and the whole "there doesn't need to be a reason for love" is just an excuse he made.</br></br>  <br> He could have spent almost a year by now just with his family instead of making a film about not being able to see them <br>Actually the movie's been in production for a while. Probably part of the reason the ending turned out the way it did with all that Kaguya nonsense.<br><br>Apparently while writing nurudu he worked almost 100 hour workweeks. Fucking Japan and their wage slave culture. Jesus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed, but I am unsure who would make anything decent of it.<br>SP has a bad track of being inconsistent, CC2's ability to add fun side missions is limited.</br></br>  <br>Guess it would be up to luck. However I recall most of SP's part 1 filler to be decent. Stuff like the bug arc and whatnot.</br>  <br>The bug arc was more an exception, not the rule. Stuff with Hinata was passable to legitimately enjoyable because SP loves the best girl. But there was also bullshit like the episode where Naruto uses the Rasengan to make ramen.</br>  <br> Kishi: It wasn’t difficult to an extent. It’s because when Naruto became an adult, he became someone who’s also similar to who I am now. Since I also have nothing but work, I can’t meet with my son at all. So in other words, the contents of this movie exposes my own private life (Laughs). However, even Boruto seems to reflect it. It’s difficult for a child to understand the circumstances of an adult who can’t look after them. But the converse of that (also seems to be true: //it’s difficult for an adult to understand the circumstances of a child who can’t be looked after). </br>  <br>There's some fairly decent stuff in there, some bizarre but amusing shit (Ino getting a golden shower) but a lot, a lot of pointless, dreadful filler.</br>  <br> Ino getting a golden shower <br>I'm still wondering who at SP managed to get their piss fetish into a children's cartoon.</br></br>  I think SP could have a chance if they had the time and budget what with the original series winding down to a close. But until they finish animating nurudu, there should be no more filler. <br><br>Especially about that faggot Obito and his retarded obsession with a girl who didn't even like him all that much.</br></br>  Why can't Sasuke just fuck Sakura again so his offspring can get EMS? Even if Sarada suffers enough trauma to get MS she will just go blind when she uses it.  <br> do you think ino would get embarrassed if she were peed on by naruto <br> sorry if this offends anyone but I thought it was a funny thing haha </br></br>  <br>One time was bad enough.</br>  <br>Apropos of Ino, did they do one of those episodes where the casts switches bodies and shenanigans ensue? It's probably one of the biggest fetishes I have seen to appear in a whole bunch of shows with some regularity, enough to become a staple, but while watching it you can't shake the feeling that the episode originated in someone's fantasy and in its original format ended up in a sock.</br>  <br> I'm still wondering who at SP managed to get their piss fetish into a children's cartoon. <br>Because it was accident! <br>And accidents and stupid shit like this considered funny in nipland</br></br></br>  OVA with best supporting character as the main when?<br><br>A conversation with him and Salad would be interesting</br></br>  <br>Because Sarada can't even get the MS unless somebody kills fatty.</br>  <br>For God's sake, anon, he's a changed man! Why would you punish him like that again?</br>  <br> again </br>  <br>I can't wait for the incest art</br>  <br>I still want to see a post-Last episode where Hinata somehow meets Kurama.</br>  <br> A conversation with him and Salad would be interesting <br> Kurama just sits there telling her every single embarrassing thing her dad and nardo did until she begs him to stop  <br> "And that was when he hyperventilated after hearing your dad had joined a criminal organization. He was such a faggot back then." </br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully Sasuke is smart enough to know that the world doesn't need more sharingans. Just Sarada is more than enough.</br>  <br> she doesn't give a fuck and isn't afraid of him in the least <br> affectionately calls him "Kurama-chan" and thanks him for keeping nardo safe all those years  <br> Kurama tries to be tsun but can't <br>I certainly wouldn't mind if nardo went in a more SoL angle under new management.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto can switch with Kurama, so it shouldn't be too hard for them to talk.</br>  <br>maybe nanashi will grow attached to these two like he did their parents</br>  <br> the world doesn't need more sharingans <br>Did you miss the fifty kids with sharingan that Kabuto adopted and will soon be breeding with Konoha women?</br></br>    Give me your himawari x boruto requests. I'll draw that shit.  <br>They are the perfect death fodder for the next Uchiha massacre.</br>  <br> There's some fairly decent stuff in there <br>that's true</br></br>  <br> Hopefully Sasuke is smart enough to know that the world doesn't need more sharingans <br>Yeah... about that...<br><br>Oh, but I wouldn't worry. After all, they're in the protection and care of a former mad scientist who started a world war and drank his former boss like a smoothie.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Your dad was top chuuni, sarada" <br> "He made minato looks normal" <br> "Always talking about vengeance, darkness, his eyes,etc. it was awkward as fuck" </br></br></br>  <br>They are not Uchiha, their offspring would not have the sharingan. All they have is tissue that doesn't reject any implants at all.</br>    <br>Piggyback race v. Nardo and Hinata.</br>  <br>Porn.<br><br> Actually, something about him making it up to her for destroying her cake would be nice. </br></br></br>  <br>Oh wait, forgot this page.</br>  <br>Their clones all have sharingans.</br>  <br> "And don't even get me started on his Chuunin onesie." </br>  <br>Wasn't that just inserted into all of them from Obito's fridge?</br>  <br> After all, they're in the protection and care of a former mad scientist who started a world war and drank his former boss like a smoothie. <br><br>People keep acting like this is a thing, as if he wasn't raped into being a good guy, by a technique that can only keep raping you until you finally surrender it all to that technique and are forced to be earnest.<br><br>He's not plotting anything, otherwise he could never get past Izanami.<br><br>He was fucked into being a good guy, who saved Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All they have is tissue that doesn't reject any implants at all <br>And a fuckton of bootleg MS eyes.</br></br>  <br>Shin found Obito's giant eyeball storage room. That's how Sasuke knew where the hideout was.</br>  <br>how real ninja battles should be</br>  <br>I don't know. They're all the same as Shin so I'm guessing he just cloned the eyes as well. Obito's magic fridge is likely still out there somewhere.</br>  <br> Seriously your dad is the biggest faggot I ever knew. <br> Well, second, I guess. <br> I ever tell you about your great great great grandpa Madara? </br></br></br>  <br> "So when are you going to breed with Boruto?" </br>  <br>Shes gonna have cute lil bro<br>Mark my words</br></br>  <br> Naruto and Hinata decide to introduce Kurama to the kids <br> Boruto is scared shitless and starts crying <br> Himawari squeals at how cute Kurama is <br> Eventually Himawari starts asking Naruto if she can play with Kurama <br> Kurama protests that he's not a dog <br> Still lets her cuddle in his tails </br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> "And don't let me start with that Faggot Indra" <br> "He was such a faggot that make Hamura leave the planet" </br></br>  <br> green eyes <br> pink hair </br></br>  <br> And a fuckton of bootleg MS eyes. <br><br>Are those things even confirmed as being useful?<br>I don't seem to recall the onions doing anything but toss overly cumbersome weapons around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all copies of the same eye<br><br>An eye that can control things that they've put their blood on, or something.</br></br></br>  <br>But Kurama was tsundere for Sasuke all along as well.</br>  <br><br><br>Why don't they make a filler with this?</br></br></br>  <br> that almost hidden chest <br>Goddamn she was always stacked. I wonder if Himawari's the same.</br></br>  <br> you will never be so gay that your faggotry transcends the mortal world and lives forever in your ancestors </br>  Reminder that against all odds, Lelouch died (yes, *died*; deal with it) a virgin. He died a virgin despite the facts that:<br><br>- Sex is not some taboo in this series. Fucking Ohgi got pussy (then betrayed him and became Prime Minister of Japan).<br><br>- He was surrounded by tons of beautiful, sexy women that wanted his dick, including CC, a succubus who has been giving out the ass for centuries.<br><br>- He has the power to make anyone do whatever he wants. But as we all know, rape is far worse than murder.<br><br>Even the most wimpy, dense, retarded, and gynophobic of protagonists get laid or eventually will. Lelouch is revolutionary in this regard, as he is none of these and still didn't get any. A protagonist for the ages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   died <br><br>Bullshit.</br></br>  he got fucked by murphy's law all the time, though.  <br>Maybe he just wasn't interested?</br>  <br>Seemed it. Didn't mean he me couldn't have taken a quick dip anyway.</br>  <br>He only wanted his little sister.</br>  <br>Nigger, Lelouch didn't die. <br>First of all it is necessary to explain how the "code" is obtained by using Charles Vi Britannia, Lelouch's dad, and C.C. as an example. Charles' geass had already evolved into the advanced version, i.e. where it shows up on both his eyes, by the time the viewer get to know him. In addition, C.C. did also evolve her eyes before she received the code. In both cases Charles and C.C. killed their predecessors by using the power of their advanced versions of geass. C.C.'s predecessor also states this condition herself. <br>There is also another condition set before the code activates - one has to die. In the scene where C.C.'s predecessor tricks C.C., C.C. is wounded around her chest area with blood fussing out. Furthermore, Charles' code activates at the moment Lelouch orders him to die. <br>As in these two cases, Lelouch receives the code in a similar way, thus obtaining true immortality. When Charles grabbed onto his throat he was technically killed by Lelouch - he dissipated in this case - thereby passing on the code from parent to child. It also gives a lot sense that Lelouch receives the geass from Charles who is his father, and thus is the successor of both his ability, the code, and the throne. <br>However, it's important to point out that he didn't activate the code until the last episode where the last condition, involving the bearer's dead, was fulfilled at the moment Suzaku killed him. This realization alone is a very strong argument in that Lelouch is actually alive and immortal at that. There is further evidence supporting this point.<br>One should remark that C.C. also have the mark of the code on her forehead, while Charles has it on his hand. So Lelouch most likely has it on another part of his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not so sure about that.</br>  <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br>2015 and still believing he died.</br>  <br>Was this from that ntr doujin where CC and Kallen randomly get stolen by Britanians, and Diethard set that up to happen to deliberately make Zero no longer interested in women since the two closest to him betray him?</br>  <br> died </br>  <br>“An intellectual is someone who has found something more interesting than sex.” <br>― Edgar Wallace</br></br>  <br>Reminder that it's real.</br>  Kallen is a cuck.  Doesn't Akito the Exiled confirm he's alive though or am I fucking up timelines?  <br> I don't need pussy even if nobody wants to give it to me and I'll prove it by posting a pretentious quote by literally who! </br>  <br> died </br>  <br><br>He's alive.<br><br> Pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone fucking asks the same shit.<br><br> wat guise y is lelouch alive y is the world bad again guise idk how to google lol <br><br>It's an interquel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akito is between season 1 and season 2.<br><br>So it's 1.5</br></br></br>  <br>cry more :^)<br><br>I see, that makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly. I don't like NTR so I wouldn't know.</br>  <br>Why is Lelouch by himself, even withstanding suzaku, so much more interesting than all the rest of the cast of Akito? What is it about him?</br>  <br><br>Only good doujins are doujins with pizzabutt</br></br>  <br>He was boning CC in between battles all the fucking time, it just wasn't an important part of the story or characters so the show didn't waste time on it.</br>  <br>It's not that he's terribly interesting, the rest of Akito is boring as fuck</br>  <br>Present proof.</br>  <br>Interesting due to complexity, no, but interesting due to the entertainment value he provides is definitely a characteristic of his. Akito the exiled has such a bland cast so far. If the mech fights weren't great eyecandy I might've dropped it. Also Leila's body.</br>  <br>I had pussy and my world did not change. Except that dealing with cunts is not worth my time. I'd now rather tap my Ona Hole. I just want to state that lelouch might just had his priorities set on something more worthwhile than fucking.<br><br>Although its rather unrealistic he just never had an opportunity to fuck. Blame it on the writers not to incorporate every shit, why didn't they also show him taking a shit. I don't remember Lelouch having to take a shit once.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Someone's gotta go rewatch  <br><br>It's pretty well implied. See the scene at the end of the anime, like episode 24, where Kallen interrupts C.C. and Lelouch's romantic moment. Possibly the only romantic scene Lelouch ever had in terms of sexual implications the entire show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't he into dudes?</br>  <br>It is a super power to Geass. Were any Geass users shown taking a shit? I think I am seeing a pattern here.</br>  <br>Erinnerung, dass gegen alle Widrigkeiten, starb Lelouch (ja, * * starb; deal with it) einer Jungfrau. Er starb als Jungfrau trotz der Tatsachen, dass:<br>- Sex ist nicht irgendein Tabu in dieser Serie. Ficken Ohgi bekam Muschi (dann verriet ihn und wurde Premierminister von Japan).<br>- Er wurde von Tonnen schön, sexy Frauen, die seinen Schwanz wollte, einschließlich CC, ein Sukkubus, denen geben hat den Arsch Jahrhunderten umgeben.<br>- Er hat die Macht, die jeder machen, was er will. Aber wie wir alle wissen, ist Vergewaltigung weit schlimmer als Mord.<br>Selbst die wimpy, dichte, verzögert, und gynophobia der Protagonisten bekommen gelegt oder schließlich wird. Lelouch ist revolutionär in diesem Zusammenhang, wie er ist keiner von diesen und noch keine bekommen. Ein Protagonist für die Ewigkeit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a psychopath, or schizoid. Enough said.</br>  <br> Getting laid is more important than destroying the world to rebuild it. <br><br>Please, plebian. <br><br> literally who <br>Please leave. Your kind aren't welcome here. You're both a virgin AND have never done anything significant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a wise man once said, and Lelouche clearly embodies the philosophy "I don't need your pussy, bitch. I'm on my own dick."</br>  <br>There was a point where he did say Euphemia may have been the only woman he ever truly loved.</br>  <br><br>I don't think you understand sexual romance vs love</br></br>  <br>Like you said there was a point where he stated this, however you can see that he loved Shirley as well by the time she died and of course if you pay attention Lelouch promised to make C.C. happy as she didn't manage to die. To maintain this promise he has to live.</br>  <br><br>C.C. also promised to be the only one to be by his side after he lost everyone/everyone hated him<br><br>Not even Suzaku was really by his side. Those last two months were probably a lot of fun. Nothing but fucking in Emporer Charle's bed</br></br></br></br>  posting best girl  <br>You can't prove he didn't get any off screen.<br>Just like you can't prove he did. It's pretty much like God tbh.</br></br>  <br><br>CUCK</br></br>  <br><br>Lelouch died a virgin as a mortal, that is correct, but then he woke up and thus eventually became non-virgin with C.C. <br><br>It's all old Code Geass talk though so whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting laid is more important than destroying the world to rebuild it. <br> It's either/or! <br>Typical rationalizing loser.</br></br></br>  <br>calm down, you're all losers</br>  <br> Lelouch  <br> dead <br>I'll bet you he is in the shadows that will come out once suzaku fucks up.</br></br></br>  <br>Some people can't accept it, like accepting Lelouch being a dead virgin.</br>  <br><br>Honestly his plan makes no sense anyway. The world will just turn into a new cycle 50 years later. The plan is so unLelouch that he has to be alive for it to make any sense at all. His entire plan was to become immortal. That is the Zero Requiem.</br></br>  <br>Too bad he won't be deflowering her. Then again, he seemed like the crazy overprotective type that wouldn't let guys near her.</br>  <br><br>This post is bad and you should feel bad. Nunally was second to worst girl behind Kallen anyway.<br><br>Then again the only intelligent girl in the entire show is C.C.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Every 50 years Zero comes back and topples the order </br>  <br><br> Lelouch along with his waifu C.C. return every 50 years to restore peace <br><br>I would watch it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit. Now I get it he became immortal, so he can become Zero every time humility fucks up again and resumes the title. Like Jesus.</br>  <br> Nunally was second to worst girl behind Kallen <br> either worst girl when garbage like Nina and Anya exists <br>Calm down, CCfag.</br></br></br>  <br>You seem to be missing the point that he won't do shit until Nunally actually dies. Why? because he fooled Suzaku by telling that he is influenced by the geass called "people's dreams" in order to make Suzaku also accept that Geass, therefore accepting his own inability to die at will. At the same time he assures a guardian for his sister Nunnally.</br>  <br><br> Implying those are even girl characters <br><br>Nina has a penis, and Anya is a otherkin</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is how you turn Code Geass into a milkable franchise like Gundam while never losing out on the entertainment Lelouch provides.</br></br>  <br><br>One, Lelouch knows all about cycles. Pay attention. <br><br>The cycle will take place in a better status quo. That's the point of the plan. <br><br>Not eternal peace or forcing people into submission forever.<br><br>Lelouch isn't against future conflict as a form of evolution/progress. <br><br>Even if he were alive, the guy isn't going to micromanage the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't have to be Lelouch, but they certainly will make more Code Geass both with and without him.</br>  <br><br>C.C. and Lelouch are the two main selling points of Code Geass.<br><br>Having both of them in the next series would boost sales/profits 200x</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if he had sex wouldn't he lose his wizard powers?</br>  <br>They are the two main selling points of THIS Code Geass yet there is nothing stopping them from making a different, equal or better one with others. Except for the mental inflexibility of some (thankfully not all) fans.<br><br>It's not like I dislike either of them, mind you.</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Being stupid enough to think he died <br><br>Faking your death is far easier than the bullshit he was doing all series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would certainly be better with Lelouch.<br><br>It will also boost the plot twists and entertainment value. If only they had a way to include Suzaku into later entries</br></br></br>  <br>Akito fucking blows though, it's like looking at Shinn from SEED Destiny. So I hope they abandon that shit soon.</br>  <br>That part in the episode was fantastic.<br><br> You will never have C.C comfort your worst moments of dread and despair </br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1541<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1540 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Adlet, anythings fine, maybe something "action-y"  Cyan eating an entire roll of sushi  Requesting a two-panel comic with carol (giant hat) saying<br> My dad is fucking dead! <br>and Hibiki responding with<br> At least your dad loves you! </br></br></br>  Requesting Kallen showing off her breast size and pushing it up against C.C's like the picture in the ref.<br><br>Kallen is a couple sizes bigger than C.C</br></br>  Requesting cute girls doing a cute squat while wearing cute sandals to show off their cute, delicious feet.

Otherwise, what's the point in having WWD in the first place?</br>  <br> That's what they started out to be. <br>Tell me when the WWD started.</br></br>  <br>Did you see who opted for the OP of last thread?</br>  <br> Guns &amp; Roses </br>  <br> Never happened <br>I wouldn't know about getting called out for anything, but you certainly were being rude over somebody expressing their opinion over trivial matters.</br></br>  Requesting Birdy riding a thick cock and being creampied.  <br>Fuck off, that doesn't count. SSF asked for waifus and waifufags responded. That's not normal requesting.</br>  <br>Nice job dodging my question.</br>  <br>I don't know how close they are to the original style but for references you don't usually want strange poses unless you're requesting the pose itself. <br>You want good resolution shots of every angle.</br></br>  Requesting Sailor Jupiter cosplaying as Mai Shiranui, preferably in her jiggle-crouch pose on the bottom right.  Requesting a cute feet pic of Nepgear, would greatly appreciate it!  <br>I can use fan art too.</br>  <br>So you don't know when the WWD started. You understand that making up claims when you have no idea what you're talking about makes you look like a fool, right?</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Araki's characters are always doing strange poses so that's not a problem I guess, this may be fan art but it's close to his style and is one of the clearer shots of her outfit from the back</br>  <br>The threads were started by Ristyfag and Gwenbro in order to limit the same generic waifu requests in the general. Do you know what you're talking about?</br>  <br>reminder that nepgear is an evil bitch who kills the rest of the cast.</br>  <br> titty monster Rukia <br><br>ruined</br></br></br>  <br> The threads were started by Ristyfag and Gwenbro in order to limit the same generic waifu requests in the general. <br>And you're still wrong. They were created specifically to summon drawfags to get more deliveries. Do you know what you're talking about? <br><br>You should try not to parrot other anons without a clear idea of what they are saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ristyfag <br> The first waifufag on the WWD threads <br>I learned something today.</br></br></br>  <br>True, but she's still cute</br>  <br>For some reason I want a really busty and curvy Nepgear</br>  <br>It was Lilianabro to Gwenfag.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128182174 <br><br>Kill yourself both, scum.</br></br>  <br>So tell me why we even bother having separate threads then, if they're just going to be used for the same purpose?</br>    <br>The weekend thread are specifically and only meant to be for waifu/husbando/daughteru requests. They are meant for general, one character, simple requests for drawfags to draw. The general threads have more complicated or specific requests of a different variety. When those WWD threads were started, they were started with the idea to attract lingering drawfags because waifufags wanted more drawings and hated waiting for threads to randomly pop up. The summoning threads were just threads left so that hopefully if a drawfag were interested, they'd draw some waifus for them. <br><br>These threads evolved into the current system of threads, where they became a Weekend only thing originally proposed as means for starter up drawfags or other drawfags to practice on simple requests that aren't "General Drawthread" tier requests while simultaneously satiating the endless hunger for waifufags to get pics of their waifu. They were never meant to contain anything. They were made by waifufags out of pure lust for deliveries, not to limit themselves.</br></br></br>  <br> daughteru <br>I'm tempted to request my daughterus in them.</br></br>  I want lewd with Misaki Shokuhou from Railgun and Miku Izayoi from Date a Live<br>Both have mind-controlling abilities.</br>  <br>They've always been fine to request. Just don't be a faggot and request your daughteru and waifu/husbando separately, though there is no way to actually enforce "house rules" like those.</br>  <br>My birthday is coming up soon(right when the weekend ends), is a request involving my waifu and two daughterus too much to ask for? I actually got something involving my waifu and one of my daughterus a while ago.</br>  <br>Should be fine if they are all in a single request as a theme.</br>  <br>Nothing is too much to ask, whether anyone will take it is a different story.</br>  <br><br>Might as well try, I'll probably have a simpler back up request just in case.</br></br>  <br>This is true<br>Safest bet is to just draw for the ones you've already drawn for.</br></br>  <br>I do it all the time. Requesting my waifu with my daughterus, don't see any problem with it, just that it's a pretty big request so it's doubtful anyone will take it.</br>  I have 2 requests<br>1.) Remove tentacle hair and give Ika 10 legs<br>2.) Squid for a head Girl</br></br>  Requesting an adult Kise Yayoi from Smile PreCure getting her dream job  as a member of a tokusatsu team.   <br>Are they actual daughterus as in OC or "these are characters I like im calling them my daughter"</br>  <br>As in they are canonically my waifus daughters.</br>  <br>Are you implying that daughterus aren't "actual" unless they're oc donut steal?</br>  <br> daughteru  <br>This sounds like a bullshit excuse to get another character drawn honestly.</br></br>  <br>Unless they canonically dont have parents yes</br>  <br>Thank you for telling us what you think as though nobody else has ever thought the same.</br>  Requesting Piccolo playing the piccolo  <br>You must be a special kind of stupid.</br>  <br>Top cuck</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br>I see you live somewhere that doesn't have the concept of "Loving someone like their your own kid"</br>  <br> My waifu is from a video game and when you marry her with your Avatar/self-insert player character you get two daughters, no cuck shit here </br>  <br>Counter requesting vegeta playing piccolo's piccolo.</br>  <br> abducting kids just so you can have people draw them </br>    Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  Want to share your list of daughteru?  Something of Catherine: some porn of any kind of taking a shower/bath  <br>No.</br>  How many haremfags were now going to see this weekend?  <br>I only have one.</br>  What happens if anons share the same daughteru?  <br>They take care of her together, I guess?<br> Two daddies. </br></br>  <br>The trips have spoken</br>  Requesting Turn-A fighting a bunch of Mass Production EVAs  <br>I have two daughterus, but you will never know who.</br>  <br>They request each other in the WWD and 34 has someone besides her requesting 3D.</br>  <br>Unless they actually reassemble you in a way you'll always be cucked</br>  <br> requesting 3D <br>Why is this allowed? No, seriously, why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br>That sounds pretty dumb.</br>  <br>I'm cucking myself with a player character that the developers made out to be an extention of the player themselves?

In response to the -tan arguments and some of the responses from previous threads about the way some could be turned to snuff crap or not:<br><br>There are examples of fanfics written for dunk tank stuff that involved death either in the form of drowning (top lid closing or weights/rocks tied to them) or eating by shark/piranha (in the one coming to mind, the girls being dunked still got off on it...go figure).<br><br>There are also fics involving girls being asphyxiated by various forms of gags, or the gag being a mask/tube of some sort that pumps gas into them and kills them.<br><br>There are also fics, and drawn pictures (even in actual games), of everything from pillories in the form of guillotines where when the girl cums the blade lops her head off, to horse-dicking to the point of bursting out of the girl and killing her, to bondage/torture involving crushing parts of girls bit by bit, to girls being strung up by their clothing and killed, to apron-wearing girls being shoved into ovens and burned.<br><br>So you see, the problem isn't the dunkfags, nor the gag-fags, nor the pillory or bondage or horse or clothingfags or the apronfags. They aren't the ones getting off to horribly maiming and damaging waifus.<br><br>The real problem is the deathfags/snuffags, the people who will take anything at all, no matter how normal or how kinky, and turn it into straight horror and guro. Sure, everyone's got their own kink, but if you get off to bloodletting and murder, that's a special kind of fuckery that everyone and anyone should be able to unite against.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, no, I forgot. Did you?<br><br><br>Yeah but I don't know any of those here. If I did I'd rage three times as hard as the dunk haters at them.</br></br></br></br>  REQUESTING:<br>Battle of the Bands with BECK Mongolian Chop Squad against Ho-kago Tea Time</br>  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br> no, you should be able to get off to whatever without persecution<br>as long as you dont bring that shit into the real world youre fine.<br>cumming to drawings that are on a computer screen doesnt do anyone harm</br></br> </br>  <br>Nope..</br>    <br><br>Behold.</br></br>  Requesting Eli making a footjob meanwhile she's wearing striped stockings and red glasses please    <br>Niiiiiiice!
