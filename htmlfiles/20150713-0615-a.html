[ A best sister.<br>A best everything.</br>  <br>But how can she be best sister when Izumi is best sister</br>  <br>She's an alcohol and it's destroying her family.</br>  I think you accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister.  <br>We're posting best sisters, not worst sisters.</br>  Best nee-san.  <br>They all have problems.</br>  <br>Kazue may be divorced but she's holding the family together pretty much on her own.</br>  <br> you will never lick Kazue's butthole after a long day of court <br><br>why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>W-what is going on here?</br>  <br>I want to take care of her.</br>  <br>W-WHAT IS HAPPENING?</br>  <br><br>He's putting heat pads on her because she has some muscle condition where she gets pain.</br></br>  <br>Oh, so that's what it was.</br>  <br>Brotherly love</br>  <br>I want to  hug her tenderly. </br>  <br> Selfish <br> Slut <br> Drunk <br> Loud <br>No she's shit. Then again all the onee-sans are..<br><br> is perfection though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cow tits <br> drunk <br> wastes money <br> isn't Izumi or Nazuna <br>Nah.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remind me, /a/. Why do they never see their mom and why does Katanashi not want to see her?  I just started watching it, but im wondering, is there actual romance at some point?  <br>She's a combination of all his sisters' worst traits and he blames her for their personal failings. She's a 7 foot tall mean, bossy alcoholic whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition.</br>  <br>It's a comedy, not romance. Things do develop with Todoroki and Sanji, eventually.</br>  <br>Assuming this season is the last one and ends like the manga does, yes there is some actual romance. Very little, but it's there.</br>  <br>Wow, that's fucked up.</br>  <br> whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition. </br>  <br>I want her to marry me and take care of me and rape me.</br>  <br><br>You guys are fucking faggots.<br><br>Nothing wrong with liking alcohol. It just means that she's a laid back girl that likes to have fun. Not necessarily a bad trait. And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br><br> implying cowtits is a bad trait <br>Fuck outta here faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to buy izumi cute dresses  <br>I haven't seen that in a while.</br>  <br> And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br>Ayyy</br></br>  <br>Drinking alcohol is fine, but when it's a defining trait of hers and she is seen continuously drunk, that is another. Try defending Alcoholism.</br>  <br>She's not killing or hurting anybody, just having fun. Get off her case, party pooper.</br>  <br>Alcoholism is great. The bigger issue is that she is obnoxious and incompetent while drinking and is constantly very drunk rather than simply compulsively drinking.<br>The only reason alcoholism is bad simply because it's a vice and any kind of crutch is bad whether it's cleaning or exercise. If you're reliant on it, it shouldn't be around. It's slightly worse than those because as a vice it invites other issues if done wrong but it's nowhere near as bad as stuff like gambling or stealing which are inherently damaging no matter how you look at it. <br>Alcoholism ranges from harmless to a money sink, to a health issue, to livelihood destroying/family breaking for sure but it still has range.</br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  When she eventually snaps...  <br><br><br><br> being a useless drunk is cool! <br><br>I like this. Being a Foreman at work I already know who the drunkards are and assign them the most work. Their pissing, bitching and moaning while they sweat like whores in church is most gratifying. Vowing to not drink again only to get shitfaced that night and come in drunk/hangover and then I assign them more manual labor. <br><br>It sustains me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  drunk waifu is best waifu  <br>Look at this square ass faggot. I bet you have no friends and no one likes you.</br>  <br>Are you my dad, because he's been doing this to his crew for like 30 years.</br>  i want to be pet by takanashi-kun  <br> divorced <br>No man likes a bossy cunt. MC has good life lessons from his sisters though. He knows what type of women to completely avoid.</br></br>  <br>what if it is your dad</br>  <br>This should bother me why? Unless you'd like to work for me? Come on over.<br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Not saying it should bother you, just pointing it out. You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life while people have fun. To each their own.</br>  <br>Not going to work drunk and/or severely hungover isn't living a "no fun allowed" life, it's just being a base-level functioning member of society.</br>  <br>If this is baitoza, then it's the bait of the baits, one-shots both Gilgabait and Baitrou.<br><br>No seriously salsa plz? Is this real life or a sea of Fanta?</br></br></br>  <br> You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life <br><br>I am happy thank you. But you, you stay buttblasted over my work ethic lazy deadbeat bum.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, but it's not like Kozue goes to work hungover so why did the faggot bring work into the whole conversation in the first place?<br><br><br>I don't give a fuck about your work ethic, It's not like I'm working for you.</br></br></br></br>  Do people actually find alcoholics appealing?  <br>You should since you sound like a spoiled little brat. A good day's manual labor while get that terrible shit outta you.</br>  <br>Only when I'm fucking them senseless in the bathroom.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br> I accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br> only when I'm masturbating furiously into my hand at the thought of having sex with an alcoholic whore </br>  <br>It'll be glorious. too bad we'll never see it.</br>  <br>I do. They are fun and laid back characters. What's not to like.<br><br><br> that reaction image <br>Why are there two people on there? There should be only one considering you have no friend to laugh at people with. Stay sadlife.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hinami was so damn cute this episode I mean holy shit HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG  So, FFF or DDY?  <br> no man likes a bossy cunt <br>You DID watch the newest episode right?</br></br>  <br> No man likes a bossy cunt <br>I dunno man, given her ex-husband's extreme masochism, she might have not been nearly bossy enough for him.</br></br>  <br> she has some muscle condition <br>It's called "not doing fuckall" in layman's terms. She had those heat patches put on, because her muscles were sore from walking a few blocks.</br></br>  <br>Only 2D ones.</br>  泉ねえわかわいい！！！<br>ね<br>え<br>わ<br>か<br>わ<br>い<br>い<br>！<br>！<br>！</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> わ </br>  <br> No man likes a bossy cunt <br>What a faggot</br></br>  <br> There should be only one considering you have no friend to laugh at people with. <br>I'm laughing at you bum boy.<br> sadlife <br> Making drunkards work their ass off, sweating out their liquor and beer only to make them do it again the next day <br> sadlife <br><br>Hardly sissy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to pet Yamada.</br>  <br> whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition. <br>Kek<br>Well baited friend.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what happens when you type fast and don't look at what you're writing</br>  <br>Wait, people on /a/ watch anime? I thought we all just saved images and then bullshitted our way through each thread.</br>  <br>There you go. That's a reaction image worth of a sadlife like yourself.</br>  <br> They are fun and laid back characters <br>Most of the time in fiction they're played off as noisy and obnoxious.<br>Just like half the time in real life.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, there are people on /a/?</br>  <br> Defending drunks <br>Your mom does meth doesn't she</br></br>  <br>That's only true for 80% of the threads.</br>  <br>m.3.3.w</br>  <br> thinking not being a drunk is sadlife <br>I fucking have you now. Give it up, throw in the towel. A clever ruse you played but now I hold the deck with the high cards.</br></br>    <br> not liking drunk woman <br>You gay nigga?</br></br>  <br>Kozue doesn't go to work at all. She's even worse than a drunk person with a job.</br>    <br>Gay nigga? You looking for some friends or something?</br>  <br> looking for friends <br> on /a/ <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>They're only ''noisy and obnoxious'' if you never got drunk yourself. If you stop being a bitch, you'll find out the true meaning of having fun while not giving a fuck.<br><br><br>Nice logic. Is this a new maymay?<br><br><br>Of course you hate me. You hate everyone who can have fun. Everyone is a sadlife except you right? You wish people were as smart as you but no one's on your level. Heh, typical elitist loner with no friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No man likes a bossy cunt <br>You sure about that</br></br>  <br>Well you asked if one was gay. I assumed you were looking for some friends or something.</br>  <br>So, are you?</br>  <br><br>why is she so perfect<br><br>I want to lie on the floor next to her and hold her hand and tease her as she tries to write</br></br></br></br>  I like drinking.  <br>That's some absurd logic</br>  <br> Of course you hate me. You hate everyone who can have fun. Everyone is a sadlife except you right? You wish people were as smart as you but no one's on your level. Heh, typical elitist loner with no friends. <br><br>Where does this guy think he is?</br></br></br>  <br> ant gif <br><br>You fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>I can find some that are. Give you their addresses. Of course there is a fee.<br><br>You ever eat seaweed?</br></br></br>  <br>No bullying!</br>  <br>Nah, you just need glasses.</br>   tfw the main reason Kon's films were so acclaimed was because they were so similar to Western cinema  <br><br>I don't know why but this makes me sad.</br></br>  Don't even think it.  <br>Arafonsky and Nolan claim to have literally stolen half their ideas from Kon.<br><br>He's even more of an inspiration to Hollywood than Miyazaki, so you damn well take back what you just said.</br></br></br>  <br> the main reason Kon's films were so acclaimed is because he was an actual student of film and animation, and he learned from the masters of cinema from around the world, creating anime that didn't cater to otaku and had an actual narrative thrust <br><br>Fixed that for you.<br><br>Satoshi Kon actually said things with his work, about the nature of art and Japanese culture. Speaking to a Japanese audience about Japanese culture is inherently Japanese, but the lesson he drew, that they were fucking things up and needed to learn from other cultures, is part of why he is beloved by western audiences while still having a uniquely Japanese voice.<br><br>Kon could not make his movies if he were Brad Kone in Hollywood. He couldn't make them if he were Claude Konne in Switzerland. <br><br>He could only make his movies as Satoshi Kon. And Satoshi Kon was as much a student of Igmar Bergman as Osamu Tezuka.<br><br> tfw anime as a whole is quite happy to cater to Chuunis and lolicons and ignore the fact that they have a unique art form available to say things and build something new, because the age of experimentation when new ideas were marketable is passed <br><br>I sure hope you're all looking forward to a lifetime of heterosexual male "Japanese" white dude protagonists who are just waiting for the right opportunity to unlock their hidden potential and save the world and/or their bland fanservice love interest. Because that's what we have now. Anime Spider-Man saves the 12 year old Gothloli. Forever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  tokyo godfathers &gt; perfect blue &gt; paprika  <br>Fuck off weeaboo</br>    <br>kontol</br>  <br> no millennium actress </br>  <br>Anime died in 1991</br>  <br>millennium actress in a completely different stratosphere, wouldnt be fair for everything else</br>  <br>7/10 at the very most.</br>  <br>Perfect Blue &gt; Tokyo Godfathers &gt; Millennium Actress &gt;&gt; Paprika</br>  <br>I'm going to call bullshit. Perfect Blue was largely influenced by Italian thrillers, but even still, the story was clearly rooted in Japanese culture. His other movies were direct homages to Japanese cinema. The only thing Western about Kon's movies were all the directors who would rip his material off.</br>  <br> Anime Spider-Man saves the 12 year old Gothloli. Forever. <br>Well shit anon, you're making me even more sad.</br></br>  <br>What I meant by 'western' was that it his movies didn't tend to be as shitty as most anime.</br>  <br>You mean this movies are good? Yeag its true</br>  Is he okay?  <br>Well, hello there, Kenichi Smith!</br>      <br>Anon, I love you.</br>  <br>Calling Kon's work western is like calling Kurosawa's work western.<br>Just because it was appropriated (albeit at a much lesser scale than Kurosawa) doesn't make him western-esque. It makes his imitators Kon-esque.</br></br>  <br>Blame the digital transition.<br>It's gotten way too easy to put out 4 or more shows a year in addition to contract work. <br>It's too risky to make flagship shows like used to be the norm, so they mitigate the risk by doing multiple low production value shows instead.<br><br>Anime has always been full of vapid adaptations and currently popular formulas. But they've never been able to do this before.</br></br></br></br></br>  I loved this episode. It feels like people newer to anime would describe the atmosphere as "creepy" or "disturbing" but in truth it was just depicting suicide in a lighthearted way which is a fresh take.  But western cinema is mostly shit.  <br>It's almost like there's no one willing to take risks and invest in anime that shows the tiniest bit of ambition. <br><br>However simplistic that statement might sound, it's still hard for me to deny it. I know there's a lot of talented directors that shine in the single episodes they have been entrusted with. If only they'd been given sufficient resources, I'm sure the results would be praiseworthy.</br></br></br>  <br>that would be paprika.</br>  <br>Fuckin 5 star post nigga.<br><br>Also it always pisses me off when I hear people claim that we're living in a "golden age" of anime. As if the mountains of tripe shows pumped out every season is some sort of indication of quality.</br></br></br>  <br>Skills wasted on anime, if we're being honest.</br>  <br> new ideas aren't making big money so they clearly aren't happening lelelel <br>Fuck off shitposter</br></br>  What do you guys think of his manga 'Opus'? I just started reading it and its pretty good so far.  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>Cool but it's unfinished which is annoying.</br>  We all know that Kon would've made a great adaptation of GR but let's think about it for a second. Who exactly would buy this show? Who would it appeal to in Japan? Anime that strives for something above its medium isn't financially safe in the least. The most you'll get is a pat on the back on the international front.  <br>Agreed anon.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127964262 <br>One of the last pictures of Kon.<br>Sadly, he failed.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Kon himself said he preferred to work on anime because his fast cutting style would be impossible with live action.<br><br>Mandatory posting of this link:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oz4<wbr>9vQwSoTE</wbr>  [ ]<br> goosebumps every time </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely agree. This episode was great.<br>I'm still not sure of why  Shonen Bat was so afraid of them  though.<br><br>Spoiler because maybe some people still haven't seen Paranoia Agent, and they should.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure you're not thinking about Hayao Memezaky</br>  <br>Nah.<br>He's the same deal as Oshii, his style doesn't work for anything else.<br><br>Have you seen Oshii's live action films?<br>They're dreadfully bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga, Avalon is the best thing he's ever made.</br>  <br>I like the scenes where he mimics Ozu.</br>  <br> heterosexual male "Japanese" white dude protagonists  <br>You're insane. <br> tfw anime as a whole is quite happy to cater to Chuunis and lolicons and ignore the fact that they have a unique art form available to say things and build something new <br>They're using their unique art form to give the world traps moe and lolis and it's glorious, go away</br></br></br></br>  <br> Satoshi Kon actually said things with his work <br>Yes, however westerners tend to draw some pretty dumb conclusions from his work. <br><br> that they were fucking things up and needed to learn from other cultures <br>See above. <br><br> Igmar Bergman <br> can't even spell his name correctly </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this is a fun post but it's not like the industry would change in a drastic way if anime with literary merit started appearing. Fun anime would get made no matter what because of fanatics. The medium really needs the other end of the spectrum in order to fight stagnation.</br>  <br> Anime Spider-Man saves the 12 year old Gothloli. Forever. <br>i lol't</br></br>  To all the weeaboos. Japanese people enjoy and are influenced by things that are not made in their own country. <br><br>I know this revelation will be hard on you and may even drive some of you to commit suddoku but it's the truth.</br></br>  <br>Because they're already dead. <br><br>They die pretty early on in the episode, and (I think, it's been a while) we may have never actually seen them alive<br><br>Note shadows, the activities of birds, and the responses of other people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The medium really needs the other end of the spectrum in order to fight stagnation. <br>Unfortunately japanese industries are notoriously bad at accepting this. Animation production companies are generally always between a rock and a hard place, and add to this the japanese business mentality of staying the course until you must nobly face oblivion, and you have a real recipe for disaster.</br></br>  <br>Who are those directors</br>  <br> I know they die right at the start, by asphyxia in the house that get demolished <br> I guess Shonen Bat runs away from them because he's powerless on them, and it feeds on fear <br>At least that's my take, but I'd like to hear other opinions.</br></br></br>  you mean because they appealed to pretentious artfags instead of being entertaining  <br>Millennium Actress &gt; Perfect Blue &gt; Tokyo Godfathers &gt; Paprika</br>  <br> the 12 year old Gothloli <br>I fucking wish, but loli is dead. At least you tried.</br></br>  <br> loli is dead <br><br>Anime industry can be saved after all.</br></br></br>  <br>And a fuckload of Hollywood directors took inspiration from Kurosawa. <br><br>Creators have no borders, greats learn from another. The fact that you feel "sad" is proof of your bias and ignorance.</br></br></br>  <br> Kon could not make his movies if he were Brad Kone in Hollywood. He couldn't make them if he were Claude Konne in Switzerland. <br><br> He could only make his movies as Satoshi Kon. <br><br>Yeah, you know why? Because he's Satoshi Kon. Of course he couldn't make movies as someone else. He isn't.<br><br>That statement is inherently meaningless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have the comprehension level of an infant monkey?</br>  <br><br>The current state of anime is perfectly fine, honestly. There's still plenty of talent in the field, it's just being poured into aspects you don't agree with. There's nothing wrong with moe or "chuuni" anime, both of these sorts of works can have plenty of merit, they just glossed over because they aren't taken seriously. That besides, it's not as though western media is any better at putting out works with more merit, and I'd much rather have moe#7346347 than crimedramashit#7346347.</br></br>  <br>You fucking rule anon. Best post I've read this year.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm supposing the intended point of the statement was that he was unique in the way he made movies.<br><br>He didn't necessarily have to make movies uniquely.<br><br>Making movies as himself is in fact a necessary assumption, since he literally can't be anyone else.<br><br>It makes making movies unique sound like a cakewalk when it is in fact a challenge and something deserving of respect which I think they want to get across to the reader.<br><br>Tell me where I went wrong pls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No U.<br>Also, friendly reminder that you have to be 18+ to post on this site.</br></br>  So who was supporting anime like Lain and Paranoia back then? And where did they go after everyone figured out that cute designs = more sales?  <br>I've always thought that Perfect Blue was more Alfred Hitchcock-like than anything else.</br>  <br>You know you were literally upvoting a 4chan comment right? You should go to reddit with the rest of the summerfags.</br>  <br>The same people supporting original anime till this day. Originals didn't die. Just no one is making good projects these past 5 years. And even when someone tries something different they failed miserably.<br><br>You know Kon loved the possibilities that digital cels offred for anime creators right?</br></br></br>  <br> I sure hope you're all looking forward to a lifetime of heterosexual male "Japanese" white dude protagonists who are just waiting for the right opportunity to unlock their hidden potential and save the world and/or their bland fanservice love interest. Because that's what we have now. Anime Spider-Man saves the 12 year old Gothloli. Forever. <br>I am</br></br>  <br>You went wrong when you decided to take on a relatively obvious statement about how Kon's works would not be the same had he existed in another context. Sure, it's a banal statement, but you're complaining about the wrong part<br> Of course he couldn't make movies as someone else. He isn't. <br>That's an obvious statement on the same level as the other, or perhaps worse. At least the former implies the more nuanced idea that the context of a person's life affects their work, and it's those individual experiences that make the "unique" possible. You're counter just sounds like wordplay bullshit and doesn't at all indicate the argument that unique filmmaking is hard.<br><br>Further<br> in fact a challenge and something deserving of respect which I think they want to get across to the reader. <br>Firstly isn't even going to be a part of the anon's original argument, nor does it imply otherwise as you seem to think. Since it doesn't imply that and you somehow read that it does, you might have reading comprehension problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*your<br>*it isn't</br></br>  <br>He missed a letter. Are you feeling self-conscious or what?</br>  <br> And even when someone tries something different they failed miserably. <br><br>That's my point. Do they fail because they're bad or because there are less people supporting them nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>They fail because most of them are burnt out. There is little new telent and the old guys are becoming stale at this point. When more new talents get into the industry we will have another GitS that would foster talent for decades to come.</br>  Perfect box set of Kon's movies released WHEN?  <br>When hell freezes over.</br>  <br>GODDAMNIT!!!!!!</br>  <br> there's plenty of talent <br><br>There's Yuasa and then there's everyone else.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime Spider-Man saves the 12 year old Gothloli. Forever. <br><br>Holy shit, fund it.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuasa with his skill for storytelling but on-your-face directing style and he still can't end an original show for shit.</br>  <br>Do you know what literally means?<br>Don't be such a faggot.</br></br>  <br> but it's not like the industry would change in a drastic way if anime with literary merit started appearing. <br>SO FUCKING WHAT?</br></br>  <br> &gt;tfw the main reason Kon's films were so acclaimed was because they were so similar to Western cinema <br><br>wrong, just wrong. He made good movies, he made movies with a message and a discussion on personal and japanese society problems.</br></br></br>  <br>He's saying he'd like more anime that actually have substance. What's so wrong about that? I know you just adore your ecchi, your SOLs, your idols, but would it be so bad to have things like Paranoia Agent, Ping Pong, Texh, more often than not?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure no one is against shows with substance unless they just want to be contrarian.</br>  <br><br>It's hard not to notice and has kind of turned anime into a shitty mass production industry. Make 5-10 shitty anime a season as a production level enterprise and hope at least a few of them have the right combination of appeals to rattle off that sought after 5K+ tally of disc sales that would be dismal for just about any other industry but means you've made it when it comes to anime nowadays. It's pretty pathetic and just makes anime feel like cheap disposable commercial dreck. That's why I miss guys like Satoshi Kon and a lot of the older creators who have retired, they at least tried to do things with anime beyond strictly just commercial purposes and appreciated and tried to further the craft of animation. Now the separation between studio and key staff is so invisible that it really is just all about the money. At least back then you didn't have producers that directly owned the biggest most prolific animation studio so there was a buffer between the animation staff and the sponsors in the form of the producer, whereas now the producer is the sponsor and likely owns the staff via the studio as well.</br></br>  <br>No, his point was literally that he'd prefer to have more "anime with literary merit" alongside the fun anime. How is that at all contrarian?</br>  <br>But the kind of anime you're talking about (minus the garbage that was Ping Pong) is being made at the same pace that always was. Hell even Ikuhara had a show this year. <br>Honestly though there are only 2 new talents that are being wasted : Hirao on Ufotable and Yamada on KyoAni.<br><br>You know Satoshi is an exception right? It's not like anime was a wonderful medium when he was active. It's just trying new things most of the times fails miserably : See Hiroshi and Aku no Hana.</br></br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  First for best character  is Diego Brando the best written DIO?  <br><br>uh oh</br></br>  <br>Of course</br>  Formless handsome British Lizard man.

Joylene has pretty cool powers, Weather Report is also pretty cool.</br></br></br></br>    <br>nah im serious.</br>  reminder  <br> no i mean im currently going through all of them and editing for the first time<br>im not gonna dump them now or anything</br> </br>  <br>Fuck I forgot how weird he looked.</br>  <br>forgot Diego</br>  <br>oh so i try to dump my collection</br>  <br><br>I just finished 4 and if you remove 5 that's pretty much my ranking so far. Part 5 is getting a retranslation or something, right? How far along is it? Not sure whether I should start reading that as it comes, take a break, or just read the worse translation all the way.</br></br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>Nice, pretty much how I felt through reading part 6. And yeah a common complaint about whitesnake is all of his powers. He'd loose 1 on 1 with Stone Free but Because Pucci is smart it rarely get's down to that.</br>  JoJo, the last anime you watched and the last manga you read get a crossover.<br>What would be the plot of this crossover?</br>  Just finished part 7 and starting on part 8<br><br>Do you guys think part 8 is better or will be better?<br>The ending of Part 7 dragged on a bit I don't think it was nessesary to have 15 parts of D4C but seeing the World again was cool<br><br>also, how long do you think this part will be, same as part 7 with ~100 chapters or will it be longer</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The ending of Part 7 dragged on a bit <br> I don't think it was nessesary to have 15 parts of D4C <br> he didnt enjoy the Love Train Hype Train </br></br></br>  <br>look at this qt</br>  <br>fucking epic ahaha</br>  Could Pucci beat pic related?  <br>im fucking dying</br>  <br>If Fate wills it.</br>  <br>qtist</br>  <br>Stop</br>  <br>For all we know, Part 8 might not even be halfway and there is no way to know how long it will last considering the way that JoJo is written.<br>I would be happy with another 4 or so years worth of chapters and Part 9 after that.</br></br>  <br> The fastest jobber alive <br>Probably</br></br>  <br>GATE + JoJo<br><br>Itami is given a stand by a loli sorceress and goes on a wild and bizarre adventure to kill the king of the Imperial lands or whatever they are<br><br>its only got 2 episodes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> western comics <br> any kind of good unbullshit power levels <br> implying flash can see me under the covers when he runs across the ocean <br>hes a little bitch and a liar</br></br></br></br>  <br> a set amount of speed(Flash) vs INFINITE SPEED <br>Flash Loses</br></br>  <br>And this is why manga is way better than western comics.<br>Even someone who just reads capeshit can understand that.</br></br>  Lucy Steele and Mr. Steele don't save Johnny and DIO secures the corpse<br><br>what happens, would johnny be able to save himself?</br></br>  <br> I want to cuddle with diego <br> no homo tho </br></br>  <br> Jojo + Eureka 7 <br><br>It doesn't need a plot, it's just mechs on flying surf boards doing ridiculous poses.</br></br></br>    <br> Scale is a bad thing <br>If you're gonna shitpost at least try not to come off as completely retarded</br></br>  <br>hes my husbando because above all else  i respect him </br>  If Alessi and Old Joseph fought instead of Polnareff.

Well, it's joseph, if anyone can figure out how to fight against a stand without actually having one it would be him.

Thread is dying anyway</br>  <br>It's all fully colored but RAW, the team is updated it with color ever so often.</br>   Jonathan <br>British<br> Joseph <br>British<br> Jotaro <br>Half Japanese, quater British, quater Italian<br> Josuke <br>Half British, Half Japanese<br> Giorno <br>Half British, Half Japanese. Moved to Italy but he isnt actually italian.<br> Jolyne <br>Half American, Quater Japanese, one eight British, one eight Italian<br> Johnny <br>American<br><br>Its kind of weird how the British heritage just slowly disappers like that. Also note that the Kujos are the italians (thanks to Suzie Q), not Mr.GangStar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can Echoes give someone Ripple by writing the Ripple Kanji/Katkana on them somewhere?  <br>if stand user knew what ripple was and specifically meant that probably</br>  <br> Echoes <br>Seems more like a Heaven's Door thing</br></br>  <br>Ah, makes sense.</br>  <br>I'd like to point out that Old Joseph is an American, and his daughter is American with British (and Italian) heritage. Not that it means much in terms of racial makeup but I'm throwing it out there.</br>  <br> Jolyne <br> Half American <br>Jolyne's mother was Italian-American.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it was stated that the Joestar lineage George I and Jonathan were descended from were originally Scots as well. Somewhere. Don't quote me on it.</br>  <br>Meaning she has the most italian in her blood</br>  <br>Why people hate JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku?<br>That fucking opening is amazing , better than Stand proud.</br></br>  <br>source? the wiki says so but i dont see that in the manga and they have no source</br>  <br>I must have read that on the wiki then.</br>  <br>I actually really like Sono Chi no Kioku but the first 10ish seconds really sucks ass.</br>  <br>The intro is shit and that leaves a pretty bad first impression.</br>  <br>all they say is "its mentioned she's italian American"<br><br>but assuming JoJo Project wouldn't miss something as aimole as stating a heritage, nothing about her mom is actually mentioned at all. The wiki doesnt source it to any supplemental material either. i feel they probably got mixed up by the actual show stealing Italian familly of the part.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you guys talking about the bit with the overlapping voices? Because that part's cool.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, that's my favorite opening after Bloody Stream. Stand Proud has the best cgi but that's it.</br>  Roundabout is best ending song after oingo boingos theme, right?  <br><br><br><br><br><br>1st OP &gt; 4th OP = Bloody Stream &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit Proud</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you serious? The fact that it sounds like they are singing in a tunnel makes it sound disgusting (the start and somewhere in the middle) and the final ORAORAORAORA is a huge clusterfuck. Every other part that isn't tunnel singing is great though.</br>    <br>So what happens to the time discrepancy between inside DIO's world and outside of it?</br>  <br>please elaborate. What are you talking about you bubbly anime girl?</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  <br>Yeah I'm serious. It feels menacing and atmospheric. And the ORAs are fun. Is your opinion a common one or something? Because I  shouldn't be surprised at widespread pleb taste, and yet, here I find myself surprised at widespread pleb taste if this is so. </br>  <br>There isn't any. Za Warudo stop time in all the universe.<br> inb4 But it's showed that the timestop propagates all around him. <br>It's only a visual effect used in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Bloody Stream <br> not undeniably best JoJo OP </br></br>  <br>Well I don't know if my opinion is common but I never said I hated the song, just those particular parts which makes up a fraction of the song itself.</br>  So what about The /a/ sings thing?  <br>like i said before someone just has to start the whole thing and people will follow<br>set a date, work out the little things, and everyone will hop to it</br></br>  <br> hating any of the OP <br>maximum fucking pleb<br>1&gt;2=4&gt;3<br>Fite me fgt<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yV3<wbr>F4nyBCpc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure his hamon could damage a human slightly, but it's not gonna just melt him like Kars'</br>  here have this KQ i drew a while ago  <br>I think he means how in the anime and in the game, the time stops envelops the world.   kinda reminds me of the second Inspector Gadget movie  </br>  <br>in terms of animation <br>3 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 1<br>but the last 2 openings bump 4 to the top<br>in terms of the songs<br>4 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3<br>overall I'd say<br>4 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what do you guys think of the dub? I think it's okay, but they shouldn't have had JYB voice Jonathan  So why was part 5 more popular than part 7 again?  <br>Fujos and I believe Part 7 went to a different publisher and didn't get enough advertising</br>  <br>Because  go back to the original universe you weird fuck. </br>  <br>Are you perhaps trying to be as wrong as possible? Because if you are, you're succeeding.</br>  <br>2&gt;=1&gt;3&gt;4<br> But they're all great OPs <br>I think Bloody Stream sounded really amazing, but Sono chi no sadame gets everyone hype as fuck, perfect JoJo song.</br></br></br>  <br>One of the first things Hamon is shown doing is breaking a rock. Right through a frog. I'm sure it can be used SOME way to fight a human.</br>  <br>nothing beats the original.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WP1<wbr>arj7AYuI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Because people love the JRPG setting of parts 3 and 5.<br><br>A horse race with two gay cowboys trying to kill the president of the United States, on the other hand, is more of an acquired taste.</br></br></br>  Did the Tyrant track from the latest OST ever play at all in SC? I can't remember hearing it even once.  <br>Here we go, ten donut steels and their made up fights that don't involve turning something into something else.<br>1. Wild Thing<br>Automatic stand in the shape of a glass bear. Anyone who makes eye contact with it causes it to charge after them, destroying it or immobilising causes it to shatter sending glass shards everywhere. It will then reform by the user and charge off again.<br><br>2. Midnight Oil<br>power type<br>Coats itself and the user in any oil of their choice.<br> <br>Defeats Wild Thing by smearing its hand on the side of a plane taking off. Wild Thing stares at its own reflection in the plane long enough to charge off into the distance after it leaving the user defenceless.<br><br>3. Walk this way<br>control type<br>Anyone who touches the stand user or their foot print is forced to walk in the same direction as the user. If they're a stand user their stand must also move in only that direction.<br><br>4. Radar Love<br>Ability Stand<br>The user can see where everyone around them is at all times within a 1km range. Within 100 metres they can tell the difference between each person.<br><br>Walk this way attempts to make Radar Love step off a ledge but the user yells insults at nearby people until he is grabbed and punched down by insulted onlookers. Walk this Way's user then tries to have him walk into traffic not knowing that while walking Radar Love's user guided his friend's car to his location. Walk this Way's user tries to block the car with a crowd then have them trample the occupants but Radar Love's user is able to pick him out from the crowd and run him over.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5. The Wall<br>Power type<br>Punches an inanimate object to increase its density until that object becomes unbreakable <br><br>6. Final Countdown<br>Bound stand<br>Attaches itself to a person and any device around the person that can measure time ticks backwards. If the time around them reaches 12:00 that person's heart and brain stops.<br><br>Final countdown attaches to the user of the Wall who thinks it's nothing at first until they notice it happening to every device and notice the same person stalking them for several hours.<br>They chase after the user only for the stand to reset the traffic lights as they run through the intersection. The wall lifts up part of the road and increases its density causing an oncoming truck to ramp over the user. The user of final countdown tries to get in their car but the wall increases the car's density until the wheels collapse. The final countdown user then pulls out their own clock with a time set much earlier than normal and gloats that the user of the wall only has seconds to live, the clock seeminly changes to twelve only for the hands to drop off and tear through the user of final countdown's wrist, their mass increased several fold.<br><br>7. Hotel California<br>Bound Stand<br>Any door within a building can lead to any room within that building of the user's desire<br><br>8. Machine Head<br>Power type<br>Activates or deactivates any machine no matter how broken it is.<br><br>User of Machine Head enters a haunted house attraction only for all the pop up monsters to slam into him. On trying to leave he finds himself at the centre of the mansion at all times and his stand can't seem to depower anything attacking him. He attempts to have his stand fly out the window but it ends up behind him again so he smashes the floorboard to get to the basement. The user of Hotel California appears and demands to know why he's destroying his house only for it to be revealed another stand user was attacking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>9. Rush<br>Control type<br>Infuses any moving object with far more kinetic energy.<br><br>The user of Rush appears and takes credit for the attacks. Motor Head's user attacks only for Rush's user to dodge every attack before infusing the hot water system with kinetic energy causing it to begin shaking apart. He gloats saying only he has the speed to avoid the explosion but motor head cuts all power to it. Rush's user says it won't be enough before shaking it even harder claiming that even with it inert he'll still build up the pressure himself. He turns his back to find them completely gone then tries to sprint out at lightspeed only to find himself reappearing in the same room every time. The boiler explodes killing him.<br><br>10. Final Boss Super Stand: Free Bird<br>Power type<br>Projects itself and the user to any location the user can see. Destroying the projection does nothing to the user and as long as the user can still see the target that projection will instantly reappear anywhere within the user's vision they choose to continue fighting. I'm not going to make up a fight for this one because it's overpowered as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's one thing i thought was hilarious, when Zeppeli said "my hamon isn't for destruction" when he was trying to break down the steel door that was between him and Tarkus. I mean sure it's a『steel』door but the first thing we were shown was him breaking a rock in two! Does he need a fucking frog each time or something?</br>  <br>Yes. The frog is essential.</br>    <br>Why didn't he keep a few frogs in his tophat then? What if he did and Tarkus had paid him beforehand to stage the match??!</br>  <br>Because keeping frogs in your hat is disgusting and not classy.</br>  <br>It helps him gauge if he's put to much into his Hamon, if the frog explodes...he overdid it.</br>    <br><br>Is it filename time?</br></br>  <br> Hamon is capable of making a frog explode <br>In which case it should work on normal humans perfectly fine.</br></br>  Why didn't Jotaro ever notice the time stops DIO did when he was putting Polnareff at the bottom of the stairs?  <br>no, there's probably some Araki styled excuse like "frogs don't have souls" so they can explode easily why humans cannot explode."</br>  <br>he wasnt aware of his power yet<br>after he realized The World and Star Platinum are similar types of stands and Joseph tells him The World stops time, he starts realizing he can try to percieve then move bit by bit within the frozen time</br></br>    <br>He only got Star Platinum The World in the end of the fight, that would include the observation ability too.<br>Source:  My ass </br></br>  <br> in a nutshell <br>Why is this phrase misused so fucking much nowadays?</br></br>    <br>please give us an example on how to use it legitimately.</br>  <br>F I L I A</br>  <br>a walnut is inside of a nut shell</br>    <br>"X in a nutshell" is a phrase you use when you see an image or something that is the gist of something.

Were you there?<br>I was and I didn't hear anything.</br></br>  <br>Nunca</br>  <br>At least that was within the already established power of hamon.</br>  <br> Botanically speaking, a coconut is a fibrous one-seeded drupe, also known as a dry drupe. However, when using loose definitions, the coconut can be all three: a fruit, a nut, and a seed. Botanists love classification. <br><br>What if I was using a loose definition you tight, dry drupe.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you're loose and momma always told me to stay away from loose faggots.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he didn't even use hamon for that to happen, the volcano just launched the rock into space and Joseph just said it was all part of his plan</br>  <br>I'm sure she also taught you all about nuts.</br>  <br>It was Kars' hamon being amplified through the red stone into the volcano that did it.</br>  Should Steel Ball Run be added as an extra part to the book of Mormon?

Because it wasn't very popular but still interesting, threads would pop up on /co/ or /v/ on an occasional basis. There were memes like "Steel Ball Run will never be scanlated again ;_;".<br><br>That it is more popular now means higher frequency of those threads and much higher faggotry due to exposure to more autists. I don't condone threads like those anymore since JoJo's /a/ presence is firm now.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't buy MKX but I played it a bit at a friends, its ok.

Is it ever explicitly stated that Polnareff has Chariot since birth? I don't remember. It'd explain why he does the most work.</br></br></br>  <br> I must admit I'm a little sad Diego wasn't just "Dio but unambiguously good because of his changed upbringing" because I'm a sucker for that shit <br>That's pretty much Giorno.</br></br>  <br>Except Giorno is even more braindead than Jotaro was</br>  <br>yeahhh...</br>  <br><br>Not even close. Groin was capable of solutions that were more than just "punch the thing really hard".</br></br>  <br><br> Groin <br><br>Thank you autocorrect.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>At least Jotaro had two personality traits ("Witty one Liners" and "Wants to fuck dolphins").<br><br>Girono only wants to be a Gangstar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>dont forget his most important attribute!<br>no drugs!</br></br>  <br> Jonathan's seiyuu is voicing BDSM fetishist Andre in Prison School <br> asking for Gachi anime <br><br>Ask again next season.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Joseph, Lisa Lisa and Suzi Q resettle in America <br> 50 years pass <br> Joseph is deemed English-American while Lisa Lisa is still British and Suzi Q is still Italian <br><br>Explain, /jojo/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was Bruno's. <br><br>Giorno only pretended to care so he could become mafia boss.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you not understand the difference between citizenship and race/ethnicity?</br></br>  <br>That's what I'm talking about.

Did Araki just forget about him?</br>  <br>his remains are still alive and in the possession of the Speedwagon Foundation.</br>  <br><br>He got locked up by the Speedwagon Crew and was either locked away Ark-of-the-Covenant-style or got destroyed at some point offscreen.</br></br>  <br> A: Go chase down this stand user that's about to destroy everything and make the world safe for my daughter. <br> B: Spend some last few moments with her, cowering and pissing ourselves. <br> Picks one <br> More than once <br> Picks it every single time <br> Shit father <br><br>Sure kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The other Pillar Men didn't even say much about him, so I guess he was just unimportant.</br></br>  <br>He got turned to stone and locked up by the SWF. Eventually he stopped thinking.</br>  <br>Santana was mentioned to be the lowest ranking pillar man. He was pretty much the faceless meido of pillar men.<br><br>He wasn't even important enough to be in the same pillar as the other guys.</br></br></br>  How do we fix these people's shit taste?<br><br>Of course they had a Steven Universe background</br></br>  <br> tfw no scanned doujins of Joseph getting dicked by the pillarmen </br>  <br>Because in this modern world, being mean is worse than being evil. And being nice is more important than being good.</br>  <br>they have no seeds, sadly</br>  <br>There was that guy who tried to convince people that ammonia and bleach make beautiful crystals.<br><br>Think of something less lethal yet similarly trolly.</br></br></br>  <br> going to tumblr <br>Can you stop? There is no fixing them.</br></br>  <br>We could always make our own.</br>  Josefumi is here now.  <br>Holy shit how did Josuke's hair get even more shit</br>  <br><br>He was the youngest and didn't follow the other pillar men when they went to battle the ancient hamon users.</br></br>  <br>Haha, time for reaction images!</br>  <br> RIP iggy <br> I didn't like you at first, but you grew on me very damn quickly <br> You also died a hero </br></br></br>  <br>No, he died getting kicked by a vampire gayer than his master.</br>  <br>Iggy is the worst character in JoJo.</br>  <br>If hamon can pulverize a rock I'm pretty damn sure it could knock the fuck outta a human being</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wJJ<wbr>VMyV-odU</wbr>  [ ]  <br> ignoring that jotaro neglected her for 15+ years  <br>Please stop sucking his dick</br></br>  <br>If giorno is genetic Jonathans son why isn't he big mc large huge like his father?</br>  <br>Actually, hamon has been said time and time again to not be nearly as effective on humans/living beings as it is on objects or vampires. That's why you never see joseph using it on part 3. <br>It doesn't do anything for the strength of the punch. <br>That's also why it passed through the frog. Zepelli didn't have to do any kind of trick to get it past the frog unharmed, he just sent the hamon through it because he knew it wouldn't do damage.<br>I mean, after all hamon is pretty much concentrated sun energy. I don't know how the fuck that works with breaking a rock in half, but it definitely makes sense to cause no damage in living beings. Except for cancer, maybe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The real question is why he has Dio's hair color.</br>  <br>He dyes his hair.</br>  <br>Seeing how much araki loves to suck jotaro's dick, there's probably gonna be some sort of one shot that fills us in on just what happened during those 15 years. And it's gonna make perfect sense that the only way to go was to abandon her.</br>  <br>For the same reason that josuke is not a meat tank, the mother's genes probably overtook the father's genes.<br><br><br>This might be a long shot, but I think his hair being black and then turning blonde might be a reference to the very first chapters of phantom blood, with the terrible charcoal shading that made everyone look like they had black hair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jonathan was 6'4 250lb of brick shithouse does that mean dio fucked a midget?</br>  <br> "Araki loves to suck Jotaro's dick" <br> killed him off in a universal reset plot so he wouldn't have to put him into further parts <br> there are at least three Josukes running around in part 8 <br><br>I sense some favoritism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you know how genetics work? It's not a compromise between the father's and the mother's genes, one of them takes hold and that's it. Josuke probably had an 80-20 chance to come out a meat tank because usually joestar men are meat tanks, but he didn't because genetics likes to do weird shit and his mom's genes for being more proportioned were more dominant than joseph's genes for being big mclargehuge.</br>  <br>Seeing how he made him into the perfect gary stu with the unbeatable stand and had to reset the universe to get rid of him, I wouldn't be surprised to get a one shot or at least a reference of him in the future. I mean for fuck's sake he brought back ZA WARUDO in part 7, and they are pretty much the same stand.</br>  <br>Scarlet?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wmR<wbr>RjpDaelY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Why couldn't David deliver this<br><br>Why did I have to resort to this guy<br><br>Why didn't Cooltaff do it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  2&gt;4&gt;7&gt;1&gt;3&gt;6&gt;5&gt;8  <br>Dude, Part 2 is my favorite and I can tell you that you have shit taste.</br>  <br> ranking Part 2 first <br> ranking Part 8 last when it hasn't even finished </br></br>  <br>because having 3 mins of flash backs fucking ruins the mood. If they were to include a flashback it should only be Jonathan "killing" dio in PB then when the punch rips through him switch back to jotaro<br><br><br>7=4&gt;5&gt;8&gt;6&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that's the point of him putting 8 last.<br> 2 is the best <br><br><br>now THAT is some bad taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say Josuke is very buff, but unlike his predecessors he has a realistic build for his age.  I hope they bring back his third alternate outfit in EoH. You know, the one that exposes his muscly arms. <br><br><br>So far in part 8, we only have Kira's profession and Josefumi's surname, but we're not going to get him back. I'm interested to see the design for the latter's stand, though.<br><br> perfect gary stu with the unbeatable stand <br><br>In SC, yeah, but despite Araki exaggerating Star Platinum's abilities afterwards Jotaro tended to job a lot or simply be taken out of the action.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It should've played when Jotaro stopped time, then stopped when DIO stopped time and resumed once The World started cracking.<br><br><br> Part 2 is the best <br>Huh? I can get you saying Joseph is the best but Part 2 is fucking bad. It's just Joseph Ruses Everyone and nothing else. All of the other characters are useless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Josuke is not buff at all, he just wears huge clothes.</br>  <br>I never really thought about it but you're right. Joseph is the best JoJo, which is why part 2 is so good.  4 and 7 are close but I think 1 had the second best JoJo </br>  Why are SJWs not attacking JoJo? You'd think that they would've by now.  <br>Araki can sense when an SJW starts writing an angry blog post about it, and subsequently drops a steam roller at them.</br>  <br>Attacked? No. Most of the JoJo fans on Tumblr are SJWs, though. And they have the shittest opinions.</br>  <br>Why do you even care about them?<br><br> A few have though. </br></br></br>  <br>Because most of them are fujos as well</br>  <br>Joseph being such a good character to the detriment of everyone else just weighs down the part. Wham and Stroheim are the only other characters who can come close.<br><br><br>By JoJo standards, his build is average, but he still looks pretty healthy compared to that twink Giorno. He probably doesn't have Jotaro's physique because all his hobbies are NEET-tier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, that seems about right.</br>  <br>Jojo's western fan base is probably the worst fanbase I've seen for an anime.</br>  <br>Dude, Every white person in the United States is of European descent. Matter of fact, I'm technically a quarter British, quarter French, and then some unknown ungodly mix of Irish and German filling up the rest.<br><br>I don't care about that. I'm American.</br></br></br>  <br>Clearly you haven't had to deal with the naruto fanbase at the height of its popularity.</br>  <br>They never said when joseph got his stand. He could have had it on his twenties, after the kars battle</br>  <br>That's a valid point but  if  the anime gets to Part 4 then all of the retards will flock to it since it's more SoL focused.</br>  <br>There's something worse about the Jojo Fanbase as it's full of people who push their tumblr ideals onto the show, by making random characters incredibly fat or saying "These guys are genderqueer pan romantics jus liek me XDD" Especially with their shitty fan art that somehow recieves praise. That and the endless amounts of SU fans who jump on Jojo as well. Naruto fans are annoying and obnoxious, but it was never at this level.</br>  <br>Well Jotaro didn't always have his stand, so they both probably got them around the same time.<br><br><br>It's just the time we live in. If Naruto was at it's peak popularity now then there'd be loads of SJWs. There were only weebs and furries back then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get ready for overweight and for some reason multiracial cast for the sake of being multiracial and trans dmabfafbabaqueeerstargender dogkin version of your favourite characters.</br>  <br>Giorno is pretty evil. He doesn't kill people because they're evil, he kills people because they're in his way. Part V even ends with Giorno taking over the mafia, an organized crime syndicate.</br>  <br>I'll own up to it now, I use tumblr and try to avoid the stupid blogs but every so often I'll see something JoJo related that makes me hurt on the inside. Especially bad fanart. There's a ton of that. Why can nobody on that website draw noses correctly? It just goes against what the characters are meant to be, handsome men.</br>  <br>I get a feeling most people reblog that shit just to so they can show that they're progressive and shit without actually applying any effort.</br>  <br><br><br>Dude, all of those stands are unbelievably bad.</br></br></br>  <br>Joseph got his stand when Dio used the arrow, as the same time as Jotaro, this shit was explained in the manga. <br> Super Retard </br></br>  <br>Stupid bullshit. You're not around to perceive me, that doesn't mean I'm not touching my dick right now.<br><br>But if you WERE here, you'd know. Just like the color would be there if you were there too. It's not being perceived, but it's capable of being perceived, therefore it's confirmably there.</br></br></br>  Coolest motherfucker I've read in any manga. RIP you glorious bastard  <br>Your mind is in a box, just because some stuff like crime/killing is conventionally considered morally wrong doesn't mean it's always wrong no matter the circumstance.<br><br>The mafia at it's best is like a police force for a community. It extracts taxes from the community, and in exchange they solve problems and execute justice on the ACTUALLY evil people. Of course, in part 5 Passione was a little perverted from that cause, which is why Giorno set out to correct it.<br><br>He was neutral at worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to the true man's world, Anon.</br>  Show crossovers that actually make sense  <br>I am glad we share a nickname for that vapid oaf.</br>  If D4C brought a copy of Green Baby into contact with actual Green Baby, which effect would trigger first; both of them Zero Pointing, or both of them Boxing?  <br> early 2000s italian mafia <br> actually giving a shit about community and not just leeching billions off the government through corruption </br></br>  <br>Worm. Superpowers literally come from extradimensional Stands. Even though that's a massive spoiler.<br><br>They're also used in extremely inventive ways, MC can control insects and she ends up doing some insane shit with that. <br><br>There's are two characters that can summon punch ghosts too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Alright someone has to have the screen cap from the manga where someone says that stopped time is really just moving at the seed of light, but it's just easier to call it stopped time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Golly gee wonder what voice he puts on for it.</br>  <br>That's why Giorno cast them down and took leadership. Were you not paying attention?</br>  <br>Fuck, you guys really hate Jotaro.</br>  <br>Man, I liked Worm, but it really, REALLY overstayed it's welcome.<br><br>The series jumped the shark at the fight with Leviathan, and it never really got up to snuff again. I mean there were good parts, better parts even later, but it was never as solid again.<br><br>Taylor just stopped really making much sense after that.</br></br></br></br></br>  7&gt;3&gt;2&gt;8&gt;3&gt;5&gt;6&gt;1<br><br>isnt this the universally agreeed list</br></br>  <br> the leviathan part <br> bad <br><br>At least say Behemoth, that's when it actually turned to shit.<br><br>Also, Taylor legit had brain damage since the Bakuda fight, which explains why she has that constant battle tendency, but I see where you're coming from. I was mostly into it for all the cool fights and powers.<br><br>The author is editing Worm right now and cutting all the "narrative filler" and hopefully fixing the timeskip before he officially publishes it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one ever said anything like that.</br>    So Joseph never bothered to visit Jotaro in Japan?  <br> Worm <br>I cant find this show, link to imdb page please?</br></br>  <br>He probably killed loads of Japs in WW2, I doubt he'd want to visit there again.</br>   <br> 7&gt;3 <br>4 not 3 sorry</br></br>  <br>He hated Japan so much he had to knock up a girl to care about it</br>  <br>Because every time a tree falls down it's fucking loud. If you were in a room full of dicks I'd be a hundred percent sure you'd go to town on them even if I wasn't there to see or hear it</br>    <br>Do you know what "jumped the shark" even means? It means that was it's pinnacle, then it was downhill and it was never as good again.<br><br>He's working on Twig right now too, and Pact is already done.<br><br><br>It's not a show, it's a "web serial". basically a book where he releases new chapters twice a week or so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> universally agreeed list <br>If you're a pleb who need other people to tell you what you're supposed to like any list will do.</br></br>  Is there any panels that made you cry?  <br>It's an "online book" (actually called a web serial but it's already finished)<br><br>https://parahumans.wordpress.com/ta<wbr>ble-of-contents/<br><br>it's as long as the entirety of Game of Thrones, warning</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that there's been a good 3 or 4 attempts at doing this but no one has done it even half right leads me to think that it's just a shit idea.</br>  <br> Do you know what "jumped the shark" even means? It means that was it's pinnacle, then it was downhill and it was never as good again. <br><br>No you retard, that's not what it means, look it up<br><br>and he's both writing twig and editing worm, also pact was shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never even fucking finished it completely personally. Eventually I started skipping the interludes because I couldn't be assed anymore, and by chapter 22 or so I just couldn't hack it anymore, and started skipping huge sections to get to the end.<br><br><br>Well, I suppose you're right. Whatever, I'll rephrase it to saying immediately after the leviathan fight it just wasn't as good anymore. Done.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 3 is mentioned twice <br> No part 4 <br><br>I guess you love stardust crusaders more than the people behind eyes of heaven</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He literally just didn't like drugs. That's it. He was okay with everything else. That's why he looked up to gangsters. It's impossible to look up to someone for something they're not doing.</br>  <br>My rankings: 7&gt;4&gt;8&gt;5&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1 <br><br>I mean, I enjoyed the Part 3 anime a hell of a lot, but as a manga it's just straight up not as good as the later stuff.<br><br>With 6 still up in the air for judgement because I haven't polished it off yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to argue with you about that, but it seems to me it'd be pointless because there's clearly something critical about Giorno you just failed to understand, and you won't get it no matter what.<br><br>I mean, yeah, he's one of the least well developed JoJo's because he was quiet, calm, and serene, and his crew got more screen time, but he still had clear motivations that you apparently don't know anything about because you can't grasp things that aren't spoonfed to you.</br></br></br>  <br>I like your taste</br>  <br>dude...the interludes were the best part of worm</br>  <br>Well, the problem was I sort've have an obsessive personality. Meaning basically that when I get involved with something, I completely immerse myself with it for 1 to 2 weeks before I finish it/master it to a a degree where I'm ready to move on.<br><br>Worm just went on and on and on and on, eventually I was like "God damn it, I just want to conclude what's going on with Taylor's story and the main plot, shit."<br><br>I can only read something all day every day for so long before I start just wanting to get it over with.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 1 at the bottom <br> 2 that low <br>2 might not be the best but Joseph makes it damn good.  he's the best jojo after all </br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I'm the same, and I did the same as you at the end (post timeskip), I just can't understand skipping the interludes</br>  <br> The translation is so garbage that I honestly just skimmed through most of Part V. <br><br> Still, you do a really good impersonation of a pretentious asshole. </br></br></br>  <br> cecilia <br>But that's a girl's name<br>Unless it's a Giovanna thing</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tfw when quads lie </br>  <br>To be fair, I have like 6 tabs open right now we're I'm holding conversations/arguments with other Anon's, at some point I'm just starting to get exasperated with what seems to me to be a tide of people that won't understand something unless you walk them through it step by step.<br><br>Also<br> I didn't read part 5 <br> I'm gonna judge part 5 <br>Shit Anon, come on, no wonder I sensed it was a waste talking to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we're <br>This is what happens when you're distracted, fuck that bothers me.</br></br>  <br>joseph&gt;josuke  fuck off </br>  <br>I refuse to believe a girl can have such a wrong knowledge of where a pussy is</br>  <br>Josuke's hair is neater and more arranged than Joseph's. Joseph is a slut, while Josuke's purity is surpassed only by Jonathan's.</br>  <br> go away </br>  <br>But thats wrong, faggot<br>4=2&gt;7&gt;3&gt;6&gt;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;5 </wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>You can't exactly get a good look at your own vag without using a mirror unless you're a contortionist.</br>  <br> caring about hair <br>The next thing you say will be&gt;Mad over hair insult<br><br> no_ </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that's what it looks like when she looks down? Or maybe it's just hard to draw</br>  <br>Do you guys really hate 5? It isn't that bad.</br>  Once rereading the manga again, I noticed that the anime adds really a lots of action example part 2,<br>Trust me, when part 5 and 6 will be animated there will be a lots of fans of it</br>  <br> I didn't read part 5 <br><br>That's literally not what I said.</br></br></br>  <br> Mad over hair insult <br>w-what</br></br>  <br>fuck</br>  <br>Looks like you responded to the wrong guy, but that is some DAMN shit taste dude. there's no way in fuck 2 deserves to be that high, and 3&gt;6? Come on.<br><br>Plus 5 is pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>People either love it or hate it here, but commonly part 5 is japan's favorite while part 4 is our favorite</br>  <br>I thought it was sort of meh but I use the translation as a scapegoat.</br>  <br> The translation is so garbage that I honestly just skimmed through most of Part V. <br>If you jack off, you're still a virgin.<br><br>If you fucking skim something while obviously not taking in any information, you have not read it.<br><br>The principle is similar.<br><br>Again, I find myself confused as to why I'm bothering with you. Am I being trolled, or are you actually a retard?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Too much fighting, not enough bullshit among friends <br> Is Giorno a character in this? <br> Araku dropped one of the strongest member from the crew before he could even do anything just because he was too broken <br> Narancia makes me feel funny about my sexuality and I dont like that <br>its shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought part 7 is our favorite.  Well, not mine, but I can see the hype. </br>  <br> Glorious asspulls <br> The best Jojo <br> Vampire gods duking it out with Nazi cyborgs <br>Give me one good reason it doesnt deserve to be that high</br></br></br></br>  <br> our <br>stop</br></br>  How did Pucci know when to throw the knives? Also, how did he move away from them so quickly? It's not like he can stop time like DIO, and objects move just as fast as he does.  <br>Make him.</br>  <br>Araki probably didn't want to make Part 5 Part 4: Italy edition but the characters needed to be fleshed out more. I hate how he just gave people a chapter of exposition during fights, it's so stupid.</br>  <br>And 6 is lower than part 3 because YOYOMA</br>  <br>「Fate」</br>  <br> that one jerk who wiped his lollipop on Jacob's hat <br> that one time Karl (kakyoin) wrote on his arm in sharpie <br> that one time Paulie (polnareff) used TWO bamboo swords <br> that one episode with Mariah that's 5 minutes shorter than the rest as Jace and Abdul get yanked from the escalator to the train tracks once the magnetism sets in </br></br></br></br>  <br>I said I skimmed through most of it. That's like reading a page every thirty seconds. It's not enough to get every little nuance, but I at least understand what's going on. Besides, the translation is so shit that everyone says Giorno loses 100% of his character anyway. Seriously, every character reads the exact same.<br><br>But again, very good pretentious asshole impression. "I don't know why I'm wasting my time with you" and shit. It's very believable.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone in the cast jobbing to Joseph, biweekly reminder that we will never hear the Battle Tendency soundtracks in their original instrumental glory.</br>  <br>Stop it anon, you're killing me.</br>  <br>He probably saw Dio do it when he had Jotaro's memory disk.</br>  <br>Part 2 has the most amusing JoJo. That's it, and even then Josuke and his antics are serious contenders for that spot, which is why I assume you liked 4 the best.<br><br>I mean, yeah, if your only metric for deciding how good a part is is "How much it made me lightly chuckle", then your ranking makes perfect sense, but when you do that you're not judging all the parts based on their own merit, instead comparing a manga that's basically of a completely different genre and tone to something completely different and wondering why it doesn't stack up.</br></br></br>  <br> killing me <br>I meant sending me to the shadow realm</br></br>  <br> Araki probably didn't want to make Part 5 Part 4: Italy edition <br>WHY NOT?</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying that Joseph is a bad JoJo, He is a pretty good JoJo after all, what I'm saying that compared to other parts, part 2 lacks.<br> since when having asspulls is good </br></br>  <br>Well, generally when ignorant people get talked down to they get the impression the person doing so is a pretentious asshole.<br><br>And they would be correct, because I DO in fact think I'm talking down to you, and I guess that means I'm being a pretentious asshole.<br><br>That doesn't change the fact that you don't know what you're talking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Giorno loses 100% of his character anyway. <br><br>I still don't understand this, I thought there was a good grasp of who Giorno was. The fact that he's not as bombastic as many other Jojos doesn't make him not have any character, he's very loyal to people he considers friends and ruthless in pursuit of his goals, willing to go to lengths others might find uncomfortable (very like Dio in this regard) in the pursuit of his ideal of justice.<br><br><br>Part 4 was more than enough schoolkid slice of life bullshit, thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that sounds like a description of a sonic fancharacter, not a real person</br>  <br> since when having asspulls is good <br> when Araki does it <br> Implying every victory up to part 7 wasnt an asspull </br></br></br>  <br>He's not a real person.<br><br>Were you under the impression Jojo is all based on real people and events? Because I have some bad news for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The problem is that "loyal to people he considers friends and ruthless in pursuit of his goals" describes every single JoJo bar Jonathan. He's like a template for a protagonist; with the basic qualifying traits intensified a small amount instead of anything distinguishing added to the mix.</br></br>  <br>b-but the nazis have the best technology in the world</br>  So I just finished reading Vento Aureo. Does anyone have an explanation for King Crimson aside from "It just works"?  <br> that one time Karl sprained Jacob's ankle in his first appearance with a doodle <br> that Hol Hog guy who hurt people by pointing at them and gave Abdul such a bad migraine he had to lay down for like 20 episodes <br> the Ben and Jerry brothers with their magic comic book <br> that Vanilla Ice Cream guy in Donnie's mansion who teleported people halfway around the world <br> that old lady who made a whole village go to sleep <br>she got awfully mad that her son got knocked out</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's inconsistent on multiple levels, so unfortunately "It just works" is the best explanation available. Any explanation that attempted to be concise would fail to explain some behavior exhibited at some point; the most complete and accurate "explanation" would just be a summary of what happened every time it was used.</br></br>  <br>When I say "ruthless" in this context, I don't just mean "really determined." Giorno is willing to kill people who even just get in his way to meet his goal, even people most would consider "innocent." And hell, look at Diavolo's fate, and tell me that's not the most ruthless thing any Jojo ever did.<br><br>The only Jojo that comes close would probably be Johnny, though Johnny seems to limit himself to actual enemies actively opposing him.</br></br></br>  Do anyone have that pannel where Rohan says to Koichi "Me, self centered ? It's a joke !" (or something like that) please ?  4 &gt;8 (for now and if it keeps being as good as it is now)&gt; 7 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 <br>fight me</br>  <br><br>Jotaro, Jolyne, and Johnny were all perfectly willing to kill enemies. Jonathan and Joseph are only excused by the technicality of none of their enemies being people. Giorno was only exceptional in that he was occasionally willing to kill innocents, which was a situation that only appeared infrequently and failed to influence his day-to-day behavior in any meaningful way. Yes, he was exceptionally driven, but so was every other JoJo, and more to the point almost every fighting shonen protagonist. Being ruthless and driven are the highlights of his personality only through the lack of absolutely anything else.</br></br>  <br> The fact that he's not as bombastic as many other Jojos doesn't make him not have any character <br>If your standard of "having character" is defined by extroverted characters like Joseph you might think it is.<br><br>The fact is, Giorno's personality is most likely based on Michael Corleone, which was already an impassive and low profile. Some people might have expected Giorno to be like Joseph or Josuke, forgetting he's supposed to have the personality of someone aiming to become a mafia boss.<br><br><br> loyal to people he considers friends and ruthless in pursuit of his goals <br>The only other JoJo who demonstrated ruthlessness and ambition was Johnny. All the other JoJos were more reactive when they needed to kill their enemies than proactive. <br><br>Giorno was defined by his ambition (Dio's trait) being directed towards a common good (Jonathan's trait), while Johnny's ambition was primarily individual and pertaining to his own quest in life. The rest of them had no greater ambitions other than living their lives until someone can to fuck with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't remember, when was Giorno ever alright with innocents dying? Polpo didn't even know what exactly Black Sabbath was up to and Giorno still got all full of righteous indignation when it killed the old guy.</br></br>  <br>Finally someone who fucking gets it.</br>  I had too good of a day, /jojo/<br><br>Disappoint me.</br></br>  Nomination is now open for the titles of "anime and manga hacks". Post their picture and state what work and reason.  <br>Define hack.</br>  Post 80's Tomino.  <br>A hack used to describe an overworked, worn-out, horse. Now it describes a director or writer, overrated, who churns out anything in the hope he will be paid for it, or anyone else who doesn't do his job properly or professionally.</br>  Nisio Isin<br>Urobuchi Gen<br><br>I shouldn't have to explain either.</br></br></br>  Nobuyuki Fukumoto<br>Inio Asano</br>  Togashi  Toriyama  <br>Nice bait.</br>  <br> bait <br><br>No. <br><br><br>Came here to post these.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hirohiko Araki  <br>It's not bait.<br><br>What, you actually like these shitty writers?</br></br></br>  Jukki Hanada  Kobayashi Ritz  Tezuka  <br>Nisio, no<br>Urobuchi, yes</br></br>  /a/ will not be able to agree on this list at all. <br><br>Aside from Anno.</br></br>  <br><br>OP<br><br><br>I think we can all agree on this one at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  Imagawa <br>Akira Ishida<br>Michiko Yokote<br>Yoshikazu Yasuhiko<br>Kazuhiko Shimamoto<br>Kaoru Mori<br>Tomino<br>Gen Urobuchi<br>Nisio<br>Nasu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Without a doubt, OP.</br>  Your favorite person in the anime industry  Whoever made your favorite series.  <br> Kaoru Mori <br>what</br></br>  moot  <br>Kishi and Kubo</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>Oda and his bullshit One Piece series has to be at the top of that list. The MC is borderline retarded, the art is so cartoony that you barely even think of it as anime when you read. But whatever anime doesn't have a rule book in that regard so it's ok. Writing throughout it is shit, shit pacing, horrid character designs, devil fruits are to One Piece as Dragon Balls are to DragonBall Z franchise. Just, ugh, I still have no idea why Japan likes this shit, they must be mentally ill as well. It isn't the world pushing this to be so popular contrary to popular belief. It's fucking Japan and only Japan. Fuck Oda, this bastard ass hack. <br><br>Overrated, Unworked, Lazy, shit-tier 1997 manga artist that should have ended his career before 2004.</br></br></br>  <br> Imagawa <br>kill urself my man</br></br>  I'm surprised nobody mentioned Takahashi yet in an effort to start shit.<br> Of course they didn't, DAGURAMU is perfection </br>  <br>Nigga Fukumoto is a god. His manga are much more different and superior to the the rest of the shitty formulaic LN trash released nowadays.</br>  <br> replying seriously in this type of thread <br> nowdays <br>Stop being a nostalgia fag</br></br></br>  <br>Kubo is a bigger hack. Even Japan knows its true.</br>  <br>Relevant for kubo</br>  <br>That's not fair, he has proper backgrounds by pouring ink over it now</br>  <br>Hiroyuki Sawano</br>  <br><br>His nonbackgrounds are the least offensive thing about bleach</br></br>  The guy that wrote Kaiji. such overrated filth  <br>Tite Kubo</br>  <br> tfw retard posts a /v/ thread near me </br>  Gen<br>Fukumoto<br>Hideki anno<br>Miyazaki recently<br>Imaishi</br></br></br></br>  <br>Btw does Kubo live in an ink factory or something, like this is suppose to be bleach's "colour" page.</br>  Wataru Watari  <br>JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, KUBOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br><br>WHY ISN'T HE FIRED?!</br></br></br>  <br>His volume sells, despite the the weekly jump rankings being piss poor, because Bleach still have a relatively large fanbase compared to newer series.</br>  <br>I don't know why you retards keep circlejerking over Miura's background art. He isn't the be-all end-all of detailed manga artists.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, because the point was that Kubo is shit.</br>  Nasu  <br>Hacks: All the writers you like.<br>Not: All the writers I like.</br></br>  Anno   Ctrl+F <br> No Shinbo <br><br>Great, only children are on.</br></br></br>  <br>Kubo draws on black paper, that's common knowledge.</br>  Satoshi Kon<br>Hayao Miyazaki<br>Junichi Sato<br>Kunihiko Ikuhara</br></br></br>  <br> Miyazaki recently <br>Ah, no. The Wind Rises is the best thing he has ever done.</br></br>  <br>You can't be a hack if you do fucking nothing.</br>  Nasu<br>Oda<br>Kawahara</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Pretty much everyone in anime and manga industry is a hack. People that can produce decent things work for the normalfag audience, which is much larger market, than Chinese porno cartoons.</br>  Takahashi, only good thing he did is VOTOMS.  <br> Urobuchi <br> shitty <br>Name one genuinely shitty work of his other than that one CGI movie.</br></br></br>  <br> I am borderline retarded, the art is so cartoony that you barely even think of it as anime when you read </br>  <br>This is about hacks; people who just do the same shit over and over. Not necessarily bad, but brainless.<br><br>Like Jun Maeda.<br><br>On that note, I think Fate/Zero is shitty.</br></br></br></br></br>   No Yamakan <br><br>For shame /a/</br></br>  <br>Oh come on, Jun Maeda does the same thing over and over again: harems with sad girls.<br><br>But Urobuchi is pretty much the opposite of one-note. Psycho-Pass (dystopia/cop drama), Phantom (thriller/romance), Fate/Zero (Fate), Saya no Uta (drama/romance), Kamen Rider Gaim (sentai), Madoka (magical girl).<br><br>I wouldn't exactly count Gargantia and Aldnoah as his, but those three episodes he wrote from either: SF and mecha.<br><br>What more variety do you want? Comedy/SoL? Gaim has plenty of comedy episodes and some authors just can't do SoL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuasa, because pretentious.  <br> Post their picture and state what work and reason. <br> reason <br> Thread is namedropping anyone worth remembering in the industry <br><br>This is really embarrassing. At least try to state reasons, /a/nons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole cast of Chaos Dragon</br>   No one here has said Shinichiro Watanabe yet   Every writer and director I don't like.<br>Every writer and director you like.</br>  Takahiro  <br>But they're all the same thing anon. <br>Every single one of them is Phantom with a twist put on it. Psycho Pass is Phantom but in a dystopia. Zero is Phantom in a fantasy theme. Etc. The plot stays the same while the setting changes.</br></br>  <br>His VNs are also very varied. A comedy spaghetti western starring 3 sluts in space, revenge and wuxia story set in futuristic shanghai, vampire kamen rider, lovecraft inspired love story and even an equilibrium fanfiction. <br><br>For LNs there is Black lagoon spinoffs, airplanes racing dragons and dark fantasy story inspired by fighting fantasy and warhammer.</br></br></br>  Shoji Kawamori<br>/m/ agrees</br>  Fukuda<br><br>I don't think it needs explaining. He's complete garbage.</br></br>  <br>Kubo<br>Okada<br>Yamakan<br>Anno<br>Shinbo<br>Urobutcher<br>Nasu<br>Nisio<br>R07</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari Okada</br>  <br>He's singlehandedly saving Sunrise from the hack Tomino.</br>  <br> R07 <br>No.</br></br>  <br>How that man even gets employment is beyond me.</br>  <br>I can respect a man that gets a bikini wax while traveling.</br>  <br>Madoka is not a magical girl, gen himself said he never watched a magical girl show, it has literally zero common elements if we don't count the mascot and the transformation</br>  <br> the plot stays the same <br>Have you even watched these series?<br><br>Or do you think everything that's not a SoL, harem or a comedy is 'the same'?<br><br><br>I really need to look into these VNs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh please. I've never seen Phantom, but Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero have almost nothing in common plot-wise other than a dark atmosphere.</br>  <br> has a girl who fights with magic in a frilly skirt <br> not a magical girl <br>Sure brah</br></br></br>  <br>Okada is okay when she's not trying to write intelligent characters.</br>  <br>Indeed. Its like saying that a show about construction workers is a mecha because it has machines in it</br>  <br> title is "Magical Girl Madoka Magica" <br> literally every main character is a magical girl <br> "It doesn't have anything in common with magical girl shows if we ignore everything it has in common with magical girl shows guys!" </br></br></br>  <br> Madoka is not a magical girl <br><br>It is.<br><br> gen himself said he never watched a magical girl show <br><br>[citation needed]<br><br> it has literally zero common elements if we don't count the mascot and the transformation <br><br>And, you know, magical girls. Given power by a mascot to fight for that mascot's cause. And the whole message of friendship, family and belief in human spirit saving the world. Literally the only thing you need to make PMMM into the next Precure season is toning down the number of deaths and brightening overall aesthetics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about, a show about people fighting in big robots is always a mecha.</br>  <br> Yamakan <br>Yamakan is saving anime, you fuck. Didn't you watch the masterpiece that is Wake-Up Girls?</br></br>  <br>Urobuchi does the same shit in every show he has: muh darkness, muh cynicism, muh idealism is wrooooong<br><br>The guy straight out admitted he hates idealistic characters and happy things. No matter what he does, all his stories, regardless of genre, are about shitting on the things he believes are wrong. Hell, Madoka, Psycho-Pass, Fate/Zero, all these are about the same thing: urobuchi screaming about how everything is shit and anyone that thinks otherwise is delusional and naive, and using his characters as devices to illustrate this mindset.<br><br>Yeah, I got the message, Urobuchi, the world is a cruel place and anyone that even DREAMS of making good things should be crushed to their very core for being a delusional child. Because obviously cynicism makes you a mature person. Really, man, really?<br><br>He doesn't even make the whole suffering in his stories to make a point or make a comment about an interesting topic. He just likes to shit on things he doesn't like for the hell of it. Once you know this is really had to take his stories seriously when you know is just him looking down to anyone that doesn't agree with his mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the only thing missing from being a standard mahou shoujo is a Prince character, but those have already been dropped when the genre moved to target neckbeards.</br>  <br> muh darkness, muh cynicism, muh idealism is wrooooong <br> call the police, author has common themes in his works </br></br>  <br> talking about animes you didn't watch: the post </br>  <br>What?<br>Silver link makes different types of anime.</br></br>  <br>Idealism won in Gaim and Gargantia (he wrote the conclusion, so it counts).<br><br>It won in Madoka, if you don't count the movies.<br><br>It lost in Fate/Zero and Phantom.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems to me that you're just projecting. You probably think that he likes utilitarianism, right?</br>  <br>  author has common themes in his works <br>I never said that was wrong. Is just that the "themes" Urobuchi usually uses are childish.<br>  cynicism is mature <br>  idealism is wrong <br>  everything is shit and anyone that thinks otherwise is delusional and naive <br>That's literally the main theme for 90% of the things he does.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It won in Madoka <br>It wasn't supposed to in the beginning.<br>Madoka's original ending was supposed to be depressing, but they changed it to a more optimistic tone because of the earthquake, Urobuchi didn't want that but had to roll with it.</br></br></br>  <br> cynicism vs idealism is childish <br>Wasn't 4chan 18+?</br></br>  <br> He just likes to shit on things he doesn't like for the hell of it <br>Kinda like you're doing? It's called a theme, so one author/director likes his darkness, big fucking whoop, watch someone else.</br></br>  <br> It won in Madoka, if you don't count the movies. <br><br>The Rebellion was made to set up another TV season, so it practically had to have a bad or ambigious ending. Though I still think the way it approached setting up a new conflict sucked royally.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I don't think he gives a fuck about it. Have you actually read any of his interviews? He admitted the only reason he shits on characters like Saber or Sayaka is because he hates characters that fight for justice and shit. Which kind of explain why Saber exists to be shit on in Fate/Zero and why Sayaka gets the same treatment in Madoka.</br>  <br> That's literally the main theme for 90% of the things he does <br>Akane defies Sybil by retaining her desire to improve society in spite of its flaws.<br>Madoka overcomes entropy by becoming a benevolent god and saving the magical girls of the world, past and present.<br>Ledo (Red?) casts his cynicism aside to party with squid and belly dancing island bitches.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cynical and idealistic characters get shafted in his works. You're just terrible at understanding those "childish" themes.</br>  <br>Except it was never cynicism vs idealism.<br>Is literally cynicism &gt; idealism<br>To be cynicism vs idealism it'd have to actually give a chance for idealism to have a point, in urobuchi's case is just idealism being for dumb kids and cynicism for cool adults</br></br></br>  Gen<br>Nisio<br>Shinbo<br>Mari Okada<br>Shinkai Makoto<br>Nasu<br>Miyazaki<br><br><br>Literally all textbook hacks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka overcomes entropy by becoming a benevolent god and saving the magical girls of the world, past and present. <br>That was not what he wanted, though. See </br></br>  <br>Saber got bullied by almost all the cast in Fate/Zero and Urobuchi himself admitted this was what he wanted. Kiritsugu was right all along about her ideals, and even though he got what he deserved towards the end because plot demands it, it doesn't change he and the rest of the cast spent the entire show shitting on her until Saber broke down.<br><br>In Madoka it happens the same. Literally Homura says it: idealism is shit, only suffering counts. Characters like Madoka also get broken down for being naive and innocent. Let's not even talk about Sayaka.</br></br></br>  <br>So? He shits on every character because he believes in catharsis. <br>Uro's favorite characters that speak for his ideology are the independent, freedom loving ones and they also get shit.<br>In Gaim, Micchy becomes Kariya tier, and he rebuilds him back up and gives him a second chance.</br></br></br>  Seo Kouji  Miyazaki  <br>This nigger knows.<br><br><br> Fukumoto <br><br>BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA<wbr>HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miyazaki recently <br>Hes a hack since the very beginning</br></br>  <br>This, but with twice the anger.</br>  <br><br>I actually really wanted Micchi to suffer and don't think he deserved that redemption. Gen and Kouta might be nice enough to forgive him, but I sure as hell am not. <br><br><br><br>Everyone shit on her, but at the same time the fact that she's the king of knights, the light of hope every warrior on the battlefield looked up, was never really refuted. She's wrong for trying to erase her own achievements, when an eternity in paradise is at hand's reach.<br><br><br><br>None of those themes appear in Saya no Uta or Kikokugai. <br>Sure, they're dark and edgy as all fuck, but Saya is generally a story about how love, when taken too far, turns to insanity. Kikokugai also has this theme, in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka's original ending was supposed to be depressing, but they changed it to a more optimistic tone because of the earthquake, Urobuchi didn't want that but had to roll with it. <br><br>[citation needed]<br><br><br> In Madoka it happens the same. Literally Homura says it: idealism is shit, only suffering counts.  <br><br>(1)[exact words citation needed]<br><br>(2)If you think that the final cycle Homura is supposed to speak for the author, you did not pay attention. If any character can be argued to directly voice Urobuchi's position, it is Madoka's mom.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So? He shits on every character because he believes in catharsis. <br>Source on this?<br><br>Meanwhile:<br> In your work, the universe can be cruel and bad things often happen to good people, but you support their struggle for goodness in such an unfair universe. Do you see yourself much in purehearted characters like Madoka, Akane, and Kouta, or do you put more of yourself in the darker characters of those worlds? <br><br> Sometimes when I see someone who's a spirit of justice… I feel like I want to destroy them! (laughs) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The real question is if there's actually anyone with talent in the anime industry. One who can write a good story, develop their characters, have interesting and well explored themes and message, without falling into the pitfalls of being pretentious.  <br> was never really refuted. <br>And..? That was never the issue with her character. Everyone kept looking down on her for standing up to her ideals. Iskandar, Gilgamesh, Kiritsugu. And it wasn't even for her to have a positive character development, no. It was just to tell her she was shit until she broke down in the end<br><br>And as much as I detest Fate/Stay Night, even Shirou makes a better approach to her problems than telling her she's shit and everything she believes in is shit until Saber is screaming and crying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HOW ABOUT LIST OF NOT-HACKS SINCE /a/ PROBABLY CALL EVERYONE FROM ANIME INDUSTRY A HACK</br>  <br> If you think that the final cycle Homura is supposed to speak for the author, you did not pay attention. <br>I don't think a single character can speak for the author. The whole work in general, can. And when a certain character's mindset is congruent with other themes that appear in other works, you can't help but think they do reflect the author's ideas.</br></br>  <br><br>Because it was, indeed, a flaw. They're not wrong, her attitude is closer to a whiny child's than a king's. She can wave her honor and dignity around all she wants, but so long as her motivation is "hurr I was a shitty king, must rewrite history" that honor has nothing. <br><br>Also, Kiritsugu didn't bash her because of her attitude, he bashed her because he hates the idea of heroes in the first place. He sees heroes as glorified murderers who make war seem dignified when in fact the only thing you'll find on the battlefield is hell. There's nothing wrong with this kind of perspective. It's being critical of myths and legends, which is one of the things Fate does.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I actually really wanted Micchi to suffer and don't think he deserved that redemption. <br><br>I was like that at first when I watched the last episode. But when I thought about that even someone with almost no redeeming qualities like Micchy can be saved. I found that can be inspiring.<br><br><br> Source on this? <br>I think he talked about catharsis in a couple of jp interviews. Definitely in Gaim's when they didn't allow him to show civilians getting murdered, which is an old tradition/trope that Toei wants to forget since the earthquake. <br><br>Yes, he's not too found of justice for justice's sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yamakan</br>  <br><br>  But when I thought about that even someone with almost no redeeming qualities like Micchy can be saved. I found that can be inspiring. <br><br>I can see why you'd think that, but I just can't find a reason to forgive him myself. It might have fit the ending, and I was happy for Takatora at least, but Micchi was too much of a manipulating asshole for me to just forgive him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone kept looking down on her for standing up to her ideals. Iskandar, Gilgamesh, Kiritsugu. <br><br>Uh. Kiritsugu is shown to be so completely fucking wrong in his approach to life that he breaks down in the end, after realising that not only he failed, he could not possibly succeed. Iskander tried to correct her ways out of his own brand of principled idealism. And I'm pretty sure that we're not supposed to agree with motherfucking Gilgamesh, of all people.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody is arguing Saber had flawed ideals. That's indeed part of her development.<br><br>However, you seem to miss the part where in Fate/Zero nobody gives a shit about helping Saber change her mindset for the better. Is very different from Shirou actually wanting to help Saber become better than having Kiritsugu ignore her, act like she doesn't exist, tell her off every time she wants to talk to him, having Iskandar rubbing in her face how much his army loves him, dismissing her as just some little girl, and Gilgamesh also dismissing her and mocking her for what she believes in right in her face. Nobody gives an actual shit about trying to help her, they're just there to look down on her.<br><br>Is not that Saber is not wrong, she indeed is. However you can't call her treatment in Fate/Zero a positive approach to her problems when it's not really about helping Saber to change for the better. It was never about that in Zero. Zero is about bullying Saber until she breaks down in tears. Or do you really think you can help someone by treating them like shit until you make them cry?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Iskander tried to correct her ways out of his own brand of principled idealism. <br>Except he never did. Iskandar just showed Saber she was wrong and fucked off with Waver. Don't confuse trying to correct someone with showing someone the ways they're wrong.<br>Kiritsugu was never shown to be give a shit about Saber either. Did you forget the part where he ignores her most of the time? He never tried to correct her, he just told her she was delusional.</br></br></br>  <br><br> having Kiritsugu ignore he <br><br>Because she's the symbol of everything he hates and opposes, and at the same time the epitome of what he wants to become. Her existence to him should be almost as irksome as Archer's existence was to Shirou's. <br><br> having Iskandar rubbing in her face how much his army loves him, dismissing her as just some little girl,  <br><br>Iskander has his own ideal of what a king is, which is incompatible with Saber's. He feels that he's right and she's wrong and tries to demonstrate it. <br><br>Also, I have to agree with him that Saber is being pretty childish and whiny in her approach to herself.<br><br> Gilgamesh also dismissing her and mocking her for what she believes in right in her face. <br><br>He doesn't treat her any differently than most everyone, with the exception of Iskander, whom he seemed to like. <br><br>  Zero is about bullying Saber until she breaks down in tears. <br><br>What eventually forces Saber to tears are two things. The first one is being confronted by her past and failures, with the ghost of the moment where everything fell apart for her in life. The other is the fact that at no point did it feel like she and Kiritsugu ever understood one another, which echoes the fact that at no point in life did Arturia and her subjects ever understand each other. <br>She's brought to tears by her own character flaws, and from the frustration of not being able to obtain the grail after all. <br>If she actually did start crying because everyone is mean to her, then she really is a childish character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Discussion of hacks  <br> Turns into another TM general </br>  Nasu and Urobochi.<br>The guy who writes for KEY too, but I don't know his name. I avoid everything done by KEY just to be sure.</br>  <br> If she actually did start crying because everyone is mean to her, then she really is a childish character. <br>Woah, watch out for that edge</br></br>  <br><br>I'm, uh, not sure you know what "edgy" means. <br>Expecting a mature adult to not burst into tears because someone insults him seems more like common sense to me.</br></br></br>  Oh look Fatefags are arguing about their shitty 2-dimensional characters again, you sure don't see that every day.  Pretty nice.  <br>Are you even human?</br>  <br>Sell your computer so you can buy one.</br>  <br>easier to write and explain why it is just mc and imouto and similar situations</br>  So kids with superpowers only started appearing 3 years ago?

I doubt enough people will have got powers to figure that out in 3 years.</br>   What I took out was, of course, MAX COFFEE. Why, you ask? It’s because it’s special to me. <br> As soon as I placed the can on the table, the three of them focused their stares on me. <br> Um, what’s with those skeptical looks…? There isn’t a person in Chiba who’d get upset from receiving this as a sweet. At least, that’s what I wanted to say, but everyone’s faces looked considerably doubtful… <br> Yuigahama stared at the can and whispered. “…I bet even I can make that.” <br> “Like hell you can. Quit screwing around and stop looking down on MAX COFFEE. If you’re thinking you can just dump condensed milk and sugar into coffee, you’re quite mistaken. No, seriously, don’t even bother.” <br> “He’s actually angry at that!?” <br> Obviously. It’s a completely different beast from just putting condensed milk in coffee. In fact, putting coffee in condensed milk would be more convincing to me. You couldn’t achieve that sticky sweetness through normal means. It wasn’t something amateurs should stick their heads into. <br> Isshiki placed the tip of her finger on her lips to think and opened her mouth. <br> “Actually, that would put me over my budget.” <br> “I don’t know exactly how much you plan on making, but you’re under a rather severe budget if you’re limiting yourself to less than 130 yen a piece…” Yukinoshita said in disbelief, rubbing her temple. That, however, wasn’t a concern. <br> “No problem. MAX COFFEE is cheaper if you pick the right store and buy it in bulk.” <br> “Jeez Hikki, just how into it are you…?” <br><br>It's hard to believe Watari isn't getting paid with this ammount of shilling.<br> https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hayato x Hachi OTP    Iroha poorfag  <br>The true genuine.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!

Woo him?<br><br>You know, it is possible that 8man bear a some sort of affectionate emotion towards Yukino. But the problem is, he never touch those flag.
