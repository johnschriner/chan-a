[ Chu~  This is a quick one, not much speech bubbles to translate. Many thanks to the /a/non providing me with cleans.                         I like this guy, he's okay-tier for a filler character    Pretty cool entrance.  thanks for this, ultimateking.      In the raws he actually says "pyo", but since boon translated it as et la, so will I.     Will we ever get out of the filler ride ? The tournament shit that Saitama intends to take part in didn't even begin.   Oh snap, Spring Mustache.      Garou confirmed for half jesus.    this is really cool, I don't even mind the filler anymore     I appreciate.  Not "I appreciated it." ?       fucking garou is litearlly hiruma    and that's it for today.   the funny part is we're not even at the end of this current fight since he still has to beat golden balls to a pulp.       10/10   It's not Hiruma without pointy teeth.        Stop me if you can. Until then, I'll stay this cocky!  Oh Garou. I thought you were alright before, but I'm loving you now.   Thanks for the work, ultimate.        whoops, spelled it as 9nd. Fixed now.    The fact he stopped here probably means his beating will be offscreen, there isn't much point in showing it.     Golden Ball ran out of bullets, right? So yeah, off-screen defeat.      let's hope so. A bad shounen would probably pull a random secondary weapon for golden ball at this point.    I don't understand the complaint, It's the usual OPM quality.   and shit loads of guns    Relax. It's all been pretty good so far.  And just look at Golden Ball's expression in the 2nd panel  It's pretty obvious he doesn't have a back-up.        Its not, its fucking filler, its not bad but its just stalling the real story which is way better.     its not bad   Crying about something that isn't triggering at all  Go to any anime of your choice that is based on a manga and cry about the filler in that thread. Anime writer have no fucking clue and write shit. But whoever is doing thi, be it Murata or ONE himself, is doing good filler and these should be appreciated as they just mean that we get more content. I like it way more like this (filler arc -&gt; Garou) than getting the Garou arc (and perhaps the fubuki/tatsuki arc) and then having a at the very least 6 months long break,     Can we please have fewer of these shitty pointless fights and instead get straight to the interesting parts?   Too late, Murata has already turned it into a bad shounen.    Yeah, because this maga never had " pointless fights". Actually, nobody who hates" pointless fights" could enjoy it.    *Actually, people who hates" pointless fights" could never enjoy it.    Jesus, you ONE fanboys are almost as unresonable as Stay Night fags.    What fights would be pointless in the original?    Ey, England is not my house tongue? I appreciate.     Truth. Maybe Murata and ONE talk about it.    Mate maybe for you but I don't care for this fillers, again, they're not bad but I don't find them that entertaining or engaging, I'm here for ONE's story, for his good comedy, Murata expanding the world building and all that is cool and all but again, I'd rather have him make the actual arc which is already long as fuck and will take many years to catch up.     I'm here for ONE's story, for his good comedy  then read his version no one is stopping you       this   good filler   Seeing garou beat two extra jobbers is anything but fun, but I agree that the hospital chapter brought some more substance.        Why would there ever be a break? Even without this, the entire arc would take three years probably. This stuff is probably just to flesh him out more.    assuming I didn't already...     having shittaste  The fight wasn't even bad, would be weird if anyone would take garou out in a filler m8.   Judging ONE's and Murata's speed, Murata would, if he had continued the canon story line, cought up to ONE by the end of Murata's Fubuki/Tatsuki Arc. Not even kidding.   then stop being such a whiny faggot, you'll get the redraws either way              bulletes  Seriously?     Dunno, something like 80% of the fights?  You and  are making looking like this manga is some kind of heavily plot driven story, which isn't and never was.    Who cares about godly the execution.   Well, yeah, such good execution wasn't in the original, so you don't care.  Also, you forgot the new and better kid introduction, or at least I don't remember it in ONE's version.             The fight was pointless as we have enough canon material of him wrecking shitters anyway.      Dunno, something like 80% of the fights?  Nice number but provide examples please.      for his good comedy  Oh yeah I'm totally making it out to be some kind of heavily plot driven manga.     What? There has never been any danger whatsoever of catching up. Murata's buffer has always been huge, and he always goes slow. We haven't had a stream of redraws recently, but I except a lot of them once we get into the main monster association event.    hey, don't make light of land sharks   cool chapter....lets see if Murata is going to do a VS between Garou and   Speed of sound Sonic   Ultimateking, youre the man   Won't mind seeing more A-Class heroes get their shit pushed in  It's like an evil version of saitama beating up heroes who have no chance similar to the way saitama beats up monsters.      shitters   implying they are shit     There has never been any danger whatsoever of catching up  There always is, We are only two arcs away. It's not as much as you think, so Murata is enjoying characters like Garou that won't have any relevance later on.         slightly different in that the point of this filler is it's Garou's training arc. OPM being parody and all, the villain needs to be the one doing the training arc so he can stand against the insurmountable hero.      VS between Garou and   SoSS   we got pretty an upgraded version of that in the original       Tnx 4 the real in depth analysis for us, bud    no problemo     The Monster Association arc is pretty long though.    Why do you ONEfags care about filler when we already know how everything plays out?  Murata adding stuff is great. It builds up anticipation for Garou's conquest and gives other characters a chance in the spotlight.     pretty sure it just seems to be like a few people who dont like one punch man at all and want to make the threads as unbearable as possible. It's been that way ever since the anime was announced.  We used to have some pretty good threads.      To be honest, that's exactly what I would expect ONE to do too.    The Monster Association arc is Garou's training arc.    Oh really? i dont remember that fight.... i have to re-read the monster arc Sorry....       Because nobody gives a fuck about those characters and also because the focus of this entire manga is the comedy and Murata can't do it so all his fillers are good looking and uninteresting battles.    You mean skip most of the MA arc? I'd love that.    Everyone complaining about the Garou arc filler is just upset that it'll take longer to get to the MA  and we all know that's what we want     And it was real quick, in more ways than one.  Because I actually like Murata's art, but I don't want to wait months for it to depict the well-written parts.       we used to have some pretty good threads  We had our moments but powerfags and retards have always been here     Still waiting for those examples.  If you can't deal with people actually discussing manga on /a/, then you have a great many other threads to choose from.      coming in here and saying     isn't discussing anything  we get it you hate murata's version. no point in coming in everytime there is a chapter release to reiterate it.   Just come back when the manga goes back to one redraw             It is discussing. It's discussing when people reply using arguments, I reply to them with arguments, and so on. Saying "lol u just a h8r fugg of" is not discussing. What I'm doing now, is discussing. What you're doing is dismissing. I was not discussing with you when I pointed out that circle-jerking with no errant opinions disrupting anything can be done in any number of threads. But then again, you didn't exactly intend for it to be an actual topic of discussion, did you?    I'm not the Anon you asked to give examples but as for battles that I thought were uninteresting and pointless? Everything except for Bang/Bomb against Garou and Garou vs Saitama. Every other battle I didn't care for the least bit.  I also wish ONE would go back to the more light-hearted chapters with a sort of "monster/problem of the week" structure.      Garou vs. Darkshine too?     I also wish ONE would go back to the more light-hearted chapters with a sort of "monster/problem of the week" structure.  Then we get a load of shitposters who bitch about OPM being too repetitive and "having no plot", you know, like every thread prior to the MA arc.  Say what you want but the MA arc was the peak of OPM threads, which didn't all end in power level bs.      So who win blizzard or these two a-class fighters  She seems well above B level but I can't tell how strong.    hey anons....what to expect about original (ONE) chapter 102?? i personally expect massive trolling    serious spanking   Let's get this shindig started.  I swear these threads are just there so someone can post keit-ai and some faggot can reply to that with "keit ai finds a way"   Oh great, now you summoned it.    Based keit-ai.

Never minding the strange area code, he immediately calls her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.  But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. In fact, she doesn't exist in this universe at all.

"I am the best"                   A Soul Calibur anthology that focuses the stories of Nightmare. Xianghua, and Ivy  An anime based on/inspired by Sultanate of Women  The Sultanate of Women was the nearly 130-year period during the 16th and 17th centuries when the women of the Imperial Harem of the Ottoman Empire exerted extraordinary political influence over state matters and over the (male) Ottoman sultan, starting from the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. Many of the Sultans during this time were minors and it was their mothers, the Valide Sultans, or their wives, the Haseki Sultans, who effectively ruled the Empire. Most of these women were of slave origin, which was often the case in general for consorts of Ottoman sultans.  Doesn't have to be historically accurate and could even take place in a fictional universe as long as the core idea of a harem with political influence in an Ottoman/Islamic style empire is there.  An anime based on Malinalli  La Malinche, known also as Malinalli, was a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast, who played a role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, acting as an interpreter, advisor, lover, and intermediary for Hernán Cortés. She was one of twenty women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of Tabasco in 1519. Later, she became a mistress to Cortés and gave birth to his first son, Martín, who is considered one of the first Mestizos (people of mixed European and indigenous American ancestry).

Virtual Sky Lanterns   It was once tradition for people to create sky lanterns, sending their prayers along up towards the heavens and hoping their messages would be answered. An app available for augmented reality devices renovates this ancient tradition: personal handwritten requests are now contained in virtual sky lanterns, publicly released into the night sky.  People carrying AR devices, such as contact lenses, smartphones or glasses, can see these messages under the viewing options. The plot follows two individuals encountering each other in a city, competing to answer these sky lanterns.   One of the individuals is a young woman volunteering for the recognition. She desires to improve her karma profile, a popular online trend designed to record altruistic actions. The second character is a heartbroken young man answering the sky lanterns to cope with separation.  Discovering these motives fosters concern. The young woman sees the young man answering the sky lanterns as an excuse to neglect the losses he suffered. The young man sees the young woman as a lonely person using the sky lanterns in hopes of find meaning in her vacant life.   As the two characters work together for certain requests, they begin to understand each other, eventually leading them to answer one another’s sky lantern request: helping the young man accept separation and finding a purpose in life for the young woman.

It would have a happy ending though, they all come back safe but with PTSD.        implying fan-fic is a thing         Their faces when they hear that first sonar pulse and sit in dead silence as the tension builds, waiting, praying the destroyer passes them over or the silence to be broken by an explosion as they're found.

Shed a few stray tears earlier today when I watched the finale of Houkago no Pleiades. Beautiful series. Mahou Shoujo shows make me cry more frequently than any other genre, not sure why.  I'm a grown man.      S1 was quite funny.    More like grown manchild. A real grown man don't cry.     Oh, OK then. Thanks for correcting me.     I cried a little when Haru was suffering at the end of Free s2     Crying over magical Subaru girls     I've never cried...Probably teary eyed with OP a couple times.   Code Geass had me tearing up near the end. Never flatout cried though.    Yep. I'm glad I didn't dismiss it as a worthless car commercial. It was an excellent show. Worth watching for the astrophysics porn alone.     Not to mention it's last series by Gainax until who-knows-when. Yes, I also shed some tears there.    Where exactly to you guys even draw the line between crying and tearing up?  For me, it's officially crying territory if a tear streams down my face. Even if it's only one and I'm not really sobbing.  I feel like some people define crying as bawling like a baby in a fetal position or something.      I am more prone to crying while watching anime, while i'm stoned. Any other fellows anons, experience the same thing ?   Episode 1 of Ninja Slayer.   The Archer and Rin scene in this last episode. Even my mom teared up and she's a filthy secondary.   I consider it crying even if my eyes just water.    Was it the part with Suna in the hospital?    During the last ep of Gatchaman Crowds. I just wished shit in this world were not as bad as they are and could be solved more easily.      Watching Fate with your mum.  Anon I....       Well yes, but I actually teared up when Yamato got all close to Takeo on the recent episode.   When I rewatched Madoka. That series is one of the few I've seen where it has more emotional impact on a second viewing.   NHK had the same impact on me.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=trr<wbr>oxGoaenI</wbr>  [ ]  which reminds me i have to rewatch the series now.    zankyou no terror bro moments hit home for some reason   When Caesar died in Jojo  I've never cried to anime, but KEY VNs usually do it for me. AIR was so sad I almost felt physically hurt, I don't even like to remember it.   Made me cry just as much as when I read the VN.   Watching the Steins;Gate movie about half an hour ago. Before that, when watching the PunchLine finale about 6 hours ago.  I cry all the time, I think there's something wrong with me.    All the time. The shit quality of anime brings tears to my eyes. Also every cryfest like Keyshit, Anohana gets me cause I'm a big pansy. I cry at everything basically.    Wow damn your mum has terrible taste in anime.     I got absolutely destroyed by the second ep of sotsugyou hen.  I tear up reasonably often, not at sad moments but at moments that I think are really good or emotionally impactful. So I guess crying out of happiness or something? But  was the last time I genuinely cried because I was sad. The entire last season, hell, most of Aria was beautiful.  I cried Steins;Gate, teared up during Eva, and got sad during LAIN. I'm eternally crying inside because a show I really liked isnt ever going to get a second season.   tfw season final week   tfw gonna cry at least five times this weekend   The ride never ends ;_;      I have an idea. If you mention what it is, one of us will dutifully tell you why it's shit and free you from your eternal struggle.    Because he waited until the autistic girl was half dead already to fuck her?    You wont be able to convince me that Yuyushiki is shit, anon. I'm a rational human being.   Episode 9 of YuYuYu Maybe it's just because I have five younger siblings.   I get teary eyed pretty quickly when it comes to anime,but anything else and I'm cold as ice. Just today I felt empty and teary eyed during the punchline ending.  I was fine watching the anime, then I played through the VN. I cried like a bitch at least 3 times   At the ending of angel beats, that made me tear up a bit.   Straight up lost it when Illya started talking about how Heracles was like a father to her.   It didn't hurt this much when the played the VN. Why?    A few minutes ago when I rewatched iDOLM@STER episode 20.  Fuko disappearing.  Then she reappeared as a joke character and I dropped it.      not episode 15    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qiN<wbr>RO5H3AfI</wbr>  [ ]  Ashita no Joe ending  Some months ago during  Free .  i cried like a bitch when kaiji narrated that everyone's actually on the narrow bridge in the competitive society  Grave of the fireflies...  I cried just now because my allergies are so bad.  I only ever get close when I rewatch something for some reason.  I think it has to do with knowing whats coming and setting myself up to be sad or something.  Happened with both Texhnolyze and Bebop most recently.       Plastic memories gets good? I dropped it ep5.   During episode 265 of Gintama.   It's going exactly where everyone expected it was going, for better or worse.    When KinMosa ended    No, it got worse.   An absolute shitshow which will try to save itself with a sad finale.  and I will still cry anyway. fucking japan       I haven't watched the last episode yet, so it's still airing in my heart.    It was very average. No musical by the way.    Yeah, they cockteased us with the end of Ep11 and then delivered a wow it's fucking nothing finale  I want my money back      This.  Season 3 never ;_;    Today. Cowboy Bebop Ep10.   Got hit with the ex gf feels. inb4 &gt;3dpd     Every last episode of a comfy SoL.  got teary when I watched Shirobako, that was about a month ago  When Chihayafuru S2 ended and I know it won't get S3. ;___;  Almost today with the end of Houkago no Pleiades.  ;_;  Its not an anime, but  when Bing Bong died in Inside Out     What's with these faggots    Yesterday.  End of Gosick.  This thread is full of pussies.   waltz in bashir ping pong  And this beautiful thing https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rCd<wbr>MVkVR-WY</wbr>  [ ]        Same here. Especially since the threads were so good   Anohana i think.    muh poor jews   David Irving is right. The Anne Frank story is another kike fraud.      Illya heart surgery    Surely got sad or nostalgic few times, but I haven't cried once because of a fucking anime.  There's one movie that got me to cry though and it's The Shawshank Redemption     I'd always managed to hold it together before. But I cried like a little bitch at this.   Same, I was on the brink of sheding a tear    Aria the Animation ep 12.  Flashback   Symphony insert song   Farewell, my Avvenire   Rainbow -acoustic ver.-   They just dropped all the bombs at once.         hibike yesterday, that episode felt really good.   Yesterday at the end of Houkago no Pleiades.   I don't know. I almost cried when Renchon cried in NNB.  I used to cry to every drama I watched but I guess I've grown up or something.    I dont know how you can possibly not cry to this   Name of girl in pic?   The only correct answer.   Rewatched this masterpiece recently, still gets me every time.    Oy vey.    HnK had loads of these great moments.    I cried too but out of laughter, even though I knew Kirino was going to win the ending came unexpectedly in both the LN and anime.     Reading this.   It's feels weird seeing how vulgar it is compared to most of the medium, but at the same time it makes the entire thing feel more real and heartfelt.    Angel Beats, I will never watch it again due to the emotional impact it left on me.  That end scene with Kanade disappearing was just too much     2 episodes left for me. God damn last time I cried was on little busters!    Boku no fuck off. First image in google   Teared up a litte when that faggot MC was overworking himself for the sake of shitty tsundere. I cry easily when someone's hardwork for others goes unnoticed then it hits them and all the emotions. I teared up when best girl/boy Suna was suffering in oremonogatari.  You know when that guy takes the blame or gets hated by something he didn't do but doesn't bitch about it and that ungrateful bitch finally notices it. Yeah that shit really hits me hard.   At  I got teary, but the last time I really cried was back in January when I marathoned Sakamichi no Apollon.   &gt;when they cry on the roof of the hospital   &gt;when they're all reunited at the end       Cried like a little bitch. Manly tears were shed. Also Angel Beats!   Episode 10 of Angel Beats!  That shit hit me hard.       https://<span>youtu.be/RB8dPFgzrTU  [ ]  This fight always gets me.     My updated list.  5cm/s Angel's Egg Aria (several episodes, mostly Origination) Binchou-tan (first episode) Dennou Coil (last 3 episodes) Diebuster (final scene) Disappearance (final scene) Gunbuster (final scene) Grave of the Fireflies Haibane Renmei (second half) Kaiba (Chroniko arc) Katanagatari (last 2 episodes) Madoka (TV, final scene) Mawaru Penguindrum (final scene) Monogatari S2 (Snail's farewell) Mushishi (several episodes) Natsume Yujinshou (several episodes) Princess Tutu (final scene) Rozen Maiden (Hinaichigo's death) Serial Experiments Lain (final scene) Sora No Woto (several episodes) Sora no Method (first episode) Soremachi (last episode) Squid Girl (first mini-Ika episode) Tamayura (several episodes) Texhnolyze (last episode) Usagi Drop (first episode) YKK Yuri Kuma (last episode)                                 why would you cry at that? it wasnt sad or anything? just curious   This scene man. I never asked for these tears when I first started with this series The manga is better overall, but the anime just pulled my heartstrings with this episode better than the same scene in the manga.    might as well put a hashtag on that    It was horrible. Once Setsuko started hallucinating, i just started bawling. I'm so glad I live alone   The chapter after Ai's death, when it showed how dead Ikuru was without her. Jesus christ, i haven't cried that hard in a long fucking time. We knew it was coming, it was said in the beginning that both would die, but I still wasn't ready for it when it happened. Thank god they didn't show how Ikuru acted when he found her, dead beside him   Hell Girl was hit or miss, but goddamn, this episode...  The old man, doomed for hell, spending his life painting the girl he hopes to see in the afterlife.     yfw the true hero in this series is his stick    All the works from this author are the same    Same here.    Not really. Ai-ren is much more tragedy based than the others.  It's also one of my all time favorite manga, so watch your whore mouth     Too pure for this cruel world.  ;_;     Last NGE episode   Last Gunbuster episode   Last Diebuster episode  Those are the most recent ones. They weren´t even primarily sad. Just filled with such strong emotions. Damn Gainax.        babby's first tear jerker episode    Does this count? DOES THIS FUCKING COUNT ? God, fuck everything about this heartbreaking, depressing VN. There is no happiness to be found here, even  in the single ending where Kana survives      Gainax  I almost forgot how Gainax ruined Christmas     This and Samurai X OVA   I used to have a heart of stone but I seem to be getting weaker to feels brought on by anime. Teared up yesterday at the end of Punchline, flat out cried at the end of the burger episode of Kekkai Sensen earlier this season. Sure I'm gonna have a few salty beers this weekend.   You just reminded me of that showd existence and the fact that it made me cry. That reunion was one of the most beautiful moments I've seen in years    I got the ending where Taka loses his mind out of grief. Then i got the snow endin. I broke down like a fucking bitch   I legit cry very rarely which is weird because I'm pretty emotional and get moved by a lot of things. It usually just stops at the almost-but-not-quite lump in the throat stage. I'm hard pressed to remember anything specific. I think latest was mango a while ago when reading Kokou no Hito. Can't remember if talking about anime. I get much more happy tears.       I finished the last episode of Gundam War in the Pocket yesterday and cried all the time in the second half, it was so sad to see Bernie dieing, it had too much of an impact on me, I couldnt concentrate on university stuff  Bernie ;-;      I didn't cry during Grave of the Fireflies. I actually laughed a little.  What the fuck is wrong with me?    Doremi has made me misty a lot of times while watching it.  "granma said I only can cry in the bathroom and  in my father's arms"   every fucking time     KyoAni always finds a way to make me cry while watching their seemingly innocent moeshit shows.    You have a severe case of the Edge.    Oh fuck, same here. Also, Reiko's death in Parasyte.      Why is it always the episodes with the dogs?  This was probably the stupidest thing I have ever cried to.       newfags will never know what you are talking about   Like a bitch.   The end of Death Parade. I'm a sucker when the characters are parting with each other.    I don't know, it wasn't a laughing at them kind of laugh, more a laughing because it was the only thing I could do to avoid feeling disgust towards myself for not crying.  And laugh is a bit of an overstatement, they were closer to chuckles than anything.  For what its worth, I did get serious about taking my SRI regularly after watching it.       Don't know why but the final episode made me cry.     mfw he smiled       I cry at anime all the damn time. Most recently I started tearing up at episode 8 of Pleiades when she sees the alien as what her brother drew when he was a kid.   I watched this with my brother (non-anime watcher), and fuck, I don't want to watch anime with normalfag again, they always comment and make fun of what they see on screen, it's annoying. They tend to underestimate what a cartoon can do. I should watch this alone.       S;G Movie   Damn, if you cried from the trimmed down suffering in there, how did you manage with the main series? Have you read the VN?        Brought tears to my eyes too. Though by most people's definitions I guess it wasn't "crying". Damn close though.   It just wasn't fucking fair.         Most of the time it's more like they don't seem to want to suspend disbelief. I think there's also an expectation as a guy to not want to just take emotional things at face value. Most guys who aren't in tune with their emotions are pretty tsundere towards being honest with themselves about how they feel to anything even remotely sensitive.    Never  Fuck this shit  shokugeki no soma last episode when   todokoro lose and souma apologizing, that OP played in piano hits me fucking hard.<br/>     Started to watch this anime   Lulz happens and all was fine   Suddenly there's an ep where   a cat dies to protect her kitties.   Crying during the rest of the episode.       Yesterday when I made up my mind and watched "When Marnie was here".   Maes Hughes funeral. If you did not cry you truly are heartless.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NKN<wbr>v8QKLJeE</wbr>  [ ]  I thought he died there  I was so young back then...    https://<span>youtu.be/Es3ROit1CbU?t=237  [ ]  Damn violins. Every time.  https://<span>youtu.be/oAZSrrVk1TE?t=1m26<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]      Most guys who aren't in tune with their emotions are pretty tsundere towards being honest with themselves about how they feel to anything even remotely sensitive.  Being emotional is simply just seen as being weak and/or feminine, undermining masculinity. It's a deeply fixated cultural paradigm. They don't change that easily.     I can't remember what the last anime I cried during was. I've cried with a lot.    True. I've just always found it a bit funny in how contradictory it is. Watching people constantly trying to cover their bases and proving themselves to no one in particular. Half the crap they say or do ends up looking like tsundere flags to me, and the fact they never seem to think "Hey, who says I can't be -both-?" strikes me as amusing.        making a jew your waifu  You're in for troubles.     ;_;    Me too Anon. The Priscilla Ahn track at the very end is what did it for me.  Although looking back on it now it was a pretty boring and uneventful movie.     Never, faget.      the very end just pissed me off though. I cried when I thought they had ended it and I thought it was kind of beautiful and fucked up but then they RUINED THE SHIT OUT OF IT. Assholes.    Just watched Tomoyo hen and that cracked me up. Fucking amazing OVA.  Before that was Angel Beats ep 10, that shit was tough.      my nigga    yeah i cried like a bitch when this happened. Yuuko 4ever.     literally garbage: the anime    Please go fuck yourself back to MAL where you belong.     Not anime but Mushoku Tensei   It's definitely a one-time watch. The postwar stuff going on in the manor was really nice too.      someone likes an anime i don't like    There are two big moments for me: 1. When Faye watches the video tape from her youth about herself, goes to her where old house stood, drew a box in the dirt where her bed was, and laid down it in. Fucking so sad.  2. When the Tachikomas sacrifice themselves to save Batou in the most badass fashion possible. For days I just walked around in a daze just unhinged.     fuck   I feel the same about mating rituals and now I'm a wizard.    i held it together during that i think. that was a rough event though   Ai-Ren I know it's not animu, but it was a punch to the dick even though you knew it was coming the entire time. It was too much, he didn't deserve it.  Clannad did get me to choke up a bit. But not nearly as fucked up as Ai-Ren got me to be.     5cm/s and Wolf Children reduced me to a blubbering pile of garbage. Especially the latter, I'd recently lost my own Mom and the movie made me think all about how much shit she dealt with to raise me.   Pic not related.   Mustang does it for me.   I don't cry but the most feels I've got recently was in Code Geass when Euphie  turned full Nazi, her character suffered from being a bit too perfect but fuck.         You're likely to succeed if you try!   When   Italy kissed HRE   i'm a fucking faggot  Rewatching the first few episodes of darker than black when this came on it really got to me for some reason.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RSd<wbr>o4idlRGI</wbr>  [ ]    The only time.  To actually answer the question of when the last time I cried during an anime:  Suisei no Gargantia,  "Go to hell, tincan!"     Gurren Lagan  When  kittan sacrificed himslef. Easily my favourite scene from the whole series       waltz in bashir    anime        That music   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J3W<wbr>gYFGsPFM</wbr>  [ ]    I still tear up when   Yang dies        <br/>  I finished Clannad: After story this week and from the point  Nagisa died , just the lyrics of the OP were enough for me.  Also, does this board happen to hate Clannad or something? I only started browsing /a/ a couple weeks ago and while I was watching Clannad I started noticing people spoiling the show in the OP.    Yes, I'm new to /a/ specifically.  I started watching anime about a year ago.         seeing VA-chan finally get a part   seeing her friend trying to hold back her tears seeing her succeed  Fuck that show for making me so attached to the characters.       Me three    Earlier today, when Reika managed to get the rest of the school to understand her convictions, and win the election for class president.  The day after I had to put my dog down, I watched an episode of Plastic Memories and that really hit me hard.   I cried at other things, but this just left me with a dreadful emptiness inside but no tears shed.   Amagi Brilliant Park hit me surprisingly hard. Although I kind of knew how the story was going to play out. Seeing Latifa crying as she was about to lose her memories just broke me after all the fun and amusement and happiness they'd had together.  Also no more Macron and Tirami.     I got goosebumps just looking at your image.   Cried laughing at the Tokyo Ghoul Root A ending.   EVERY SINGLE TIME  ;_;        The 2nd half of season 3 and all of season 4 is suffering     tfw estranged from my family because I didn't cry at my mother's funeral    Daicon IV    TWIIIILLIIIIIGHT      These made cry so many tears, it's ridiculous.  Also pic related       oh man, this hurt so much more than anything else in this thread. Especially if you had a gang of  close-knit friends  in school and life just took you in different directions. So fucking real.  Pic related was a close second for some reason     The ending to NHK when  they make the promise not to try to kill themselves for each others' sake because it reminded me of my promise with my best friend   I don't remember the last time I cried during an animu, but I have cried during a few sound novels/VNs lately.   Final fight of Gargantia.   RIP Chamber :'(      faggot     not crying at this scene  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0yM<wbr>FumlAh2o</wbr>  [ ]     I cried then too, but not as much. The dynamic between Misaki and Satou was something I could more easily relate to so it hit me harder.   You people don't even know true suffering.   HOW OLD ARE YOU    Dunno man, that part was just forced drama to me Sato's and Yamazaki's relationship is more interesting      I forgot just how ugly this anime was. Really poor animation and art.    Actual cry cry? I don't think I've ever done that. The last time I teared up was watching Psycho Pass when  Masaoka died. He was a pretty cool character, but I also have a soft spot for fathers because I'm really close to my dad.     Go to hell, TIN CAN!  Jumped straight out of my seat and yelled "FUCK YES!"       re-kan during the scene with kogal and her mom.   It didn't come off as forced for me because of personal experiences, therefore making it at least seem less forced. Without my own experiences I doubt I would have the same opinion and would probably agree with you. Their relationship as friends, Sato and Yamazaki, was definitely better written in the fact that they are two friends trying to make it. However, the relationship between Misaki and Sato, as two mentally ill people developing a dependency on each other with the hope that the relationship will fix something was well written for what it was and I know how that stuff goes.    Well, the people in the anime had ugly lives  So it fits  Also, the quality of the youtube vid is bad; it looks better     Can't remember last time when it was anime, but I had tears streaming down my face in the 'goodbye Gyro' chapter of JoJo.  Reuenthal's death, holy shit  When he sits out two glasses of whiskey, but Mittermeyer doesn't make it in time.     To me it was just playing that old forced yandere trope; I'm sorry if you have a different view of it   Also a great ARIA moment, took me by surprise.  Not a single time.   at least not yet.     Soremachi 12  Got me feeling morbid as fuck, actually the whole anime had this really weird sad gloomy undertone that I couldn't really put my finger on.    Today marathoning Bakemonotagari, pretty pathetic right?   Human    Nah dude it is cool. I can't expect everyone to see things the same way as me and you aren't saying anything rude or even incorrect. I think it is a fair amount more nuanced than "forced yandere trope", but that isn't really the point of this thread.    Depends on which part you cried at. What part was it that you cried?    when he realized hachikuji wasn't gonna win the arararagi bowl    hachikuji "coming home" but i also teared up to other parts, but right now i can't really remember the plot itself, too much stuff   Three days ago reading Oyasumi Punpun.  I still feel wistful.    Kimi no iru machi when the motorcyclist guy died    Teared up a litte when that faggot MC was overworking himself for the sake of shitty tsundere.   This was in Oremonogatari?      Nina Winry confronting Scar Ed saying "SHUT UP ROTTEN FATHER"     fuck  Fucking episodes 3 and 4. Also I think 7 or 8. Never cried more because of an anime.   The atmosphere helped a lot, i even got a bit sad because of the OP     Ah, since you're new, people will be cruel or indifferent to you as everywhere on 4chan, but just because it's like looking into a shameful mirror of the past. One day, you might feel just as scornful as they do.  That said, Clannad isn't actually that great. It's pretty okay. The drama is rather cheap and its a pretty melodramatic series. Although it might feel like a masterpiece right now, you'll probably feel the same way eventually as you watch more anime that isn't relatively entry level. Yes, Clannad is entry level in a lot of ways. Even though casual anime viewers may be unaware of its ilk, it's one of the first things you'll hear about when beginning to delve into anime/visual novels in greater depth, hence entry level.  I'm unsure if you look down on Naruto, but the reason /a/ mostly looks upon Clannad unfavorably is for somewhat similar reasons. A lot of people enjoyed Naruto when they were children and only realized it was absolutely, mind-numbingly retarded when they got older and experienced a more diverse array of anime. Which isn't to say Clannad and Naruto are remotely on the same level - Clannad far surpasses that shounenshit and is a much better told story - but in the same fashion, there are many superior anime with regards to evoking emotion. Key games and their adaptions tend to be kinda cheap with their drama, which turns off people once they're jaded to it.  You see, because people don't think it's that great, yet so many viewers newer to the deeper subculture think it's truly masterful and thus it gets overrated, people who aren't affected by nakige drama (whether because they're not that emotional or from experience that makes them think it's not that impactful) sometimes react to the series with exaggerated distaste. With that in mind, there are certainly fans of the series and Key works in general who still definitely enjoy and like discussing them, even when they're more experienced. I'm sure you'll find them.            Gankutsuou was fucking amazing. It's a shame Gonzo is so fucking hit or miss.     It was a commercial for the cars?    Chroniko's theme repeating itself throughout the show did it for me too.   When Natsumoe won, I don't have a screenshot of the kiss fuck    That ending was so fucking cool, too.    I cried in this part, I'm not sure why    I'm a grown man <br/>       Fuck you Shinkai    Well, I fucking love GitS, I love all of it to pieces and I did not watch SAC, I lived it. Still I was so far up inside in the show that I did not notice the little things and did not think much, I mean I wnet through SAC and SAC2 during one week, skipping school and living in the database.  But then some time later I watched it again and then I looked at the little things and tried to give the whole thing some thought and then I realized that we live in a limbo between those times depicted in GitS and our past. I figured I will never have an expansion of my brain capacity and never will see the whole worlds magnificient beauty, I will never see humanity rise above itself, I will never evolve above a mere human being and finally be free from those shitty genetical shackles pinning me to the ground. No matter how hard we all try, we always will just be puny humans with their little egos and only see a tiny spectrum of what the world has to offer. And that indeed made me cry, it really fucked me up big time back then and still makes me sad thinking about it. And then in one episode this fucking song came up and I fucking lost it. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CFt<wbr>hpfOyawY</wbr>  [ ] Life is god damned suffering.          Episode 15 of fate was it for me too.  also been watching code gease. what happens with the little pink girl didnt make me cry so much as rage...     I tear up in just about every anime I watch. Never sob or anything though.    Yesterday, watching a normal episode of Aria.   Meh I'll add my name to that. I an only cry when I'm both very stressed and very drunk, and in my bathroom.    I don't watch a lot of anime, but my friend recommended me madoka magica and the ending got me tears eyed   last time i cried when i was 8 whilst watching Sailor Moon.    Cheer up, man. It isn't unlikely that we'll make extremely vast advances in neuroscience in the coming century. We may reach that level in your lifetime if you stay healthy and safe.  Although we're much more concerned with epigenetics at the moment. We need to get this gene-splicing shit out of our system already.       Clannad had potential, which is probably why I hate it so much. It was such shit.   Cried when Iggy died, and when he and Abdul ascended.   Same, but I was 22.   I've never cried over anime, but I've gone into depressive states. Shinkai's work does that to me, especially 5 centimeters per second. Shit hits too close to home, man.    Almost brought to tears when Fudo and Ein died. I actually did shed a tear when Asuka wanted her father to "rest". Not exactly crying, so much as a silent weep. The death of Shuu was more enraging than saddening, because Souther's a douche.     Well, yes, and I'm sure the newcomer will agree in time, but it's honestly not overwhelmingly shit. It has good enough animation and decent build-up. It's just really not that remarkable in the end.  Good cap btw.      When the FBI came. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CiB<wbr>I0yrtHUo</wbr>  [ ]     That anime hurt me deeply for awhile, but then I realized it was kind of just shit and iyt felt really rather forced by the end.     When was the OVA to Panty and Stocking released?   Then.        THE VISIONS DANCING IN MY MIND      I don't understand that pose     A man can dream anon, a man can dream. We wont see anything as awesome in the near future as long as every supposed technology ethic and religious nut keeps preaching about playing god and refusing to keep his frankenstein syndrome in check. It is already a really dirty and long fight for stem cell research and it is only advancing because there are obvious benefits which can be represented ethically. Here is hoping that Russia will say fuck you to every UN charter one day and allow all kinds of shenanigans.        This but with pic related    fairy tail elfman's backstory.    I wasn't crying. It was just raining, I swear.     It's funny because science advanced using much more amoral and potentially harmful means in the past, yet the same people who rally against stem cell research have no problem using the technologies derived from such circumstances if it's convenient for them. The discoveries we're approaching now are done in more humane ways than ever before.     I just watched the episode a few minutes ago where the mother threw herself off the bridge so her daughter wouldnt have to go to hell too for pulling the string. Was a sadder ep.   I never cried since I visited /a/.  No idea why this show got to me like that, everything was generic as hell and predictable. Still got me depressed.   Elfen Lied.  I'm a faggot.    It's ok   me too      Final scene in pic related    What makes 5 cm per second so sad that it caught us off guard.   We are used to romance stories with a happy ending or at least one of them dies so there was some type of closure. This was a story where the love and bond was just left abandoned by no other reason than circumstance. It is as frustrating as it is depressing      Code Geass. Several times.   No results    someone did mention it already    Towards the end I was full out bawling even at parts that weren't really sad.    The only anime i've ever cried to is gintama, among all the jokes feels hit so much harder.    Sauce please.  Like always reverse search gave nuthin.     5 cm is quite close to life, that's what makes the impact. Imagine the social bonds and friendships with people you had as a child. To how many you still have legitimately regular contact with? Same can be directly applied to love. It can be fickle, passing and susceptible to sudden changes.       Every Fairy Tail backstory.      When Kamina died in Gurren Lagann    Why is she so perfect?   FAT TATS   Pork Banger go away   Make me    perfect   cowtits   topkek       Implying she isn't perfect   Even Karin knows     Isane is the best and most perfect Bleach girl.   BROTHER     Isane is pretty great. Tall and great tits, what more can you ask for? I wish we saw more of her, when was the last time she showed up?    Would lose my dick inbetween those titties.   At least a few chapters ago. She is with Urahara's group along with her little sister.    Who wouldn't?    Not liking best girl      Neliel   Isane   Kukkaku   Tatsuki   Lisa   how could she be perfect when there are so many better girls?          She is not        BRETHREN     we all know best girl is gone and forgotten for good    airhead with huge tits  Yeah, real fucking perfect.     With god-powers     her face   or rather   everyone's faces as the anime kept going         that she doesn't ever use to it's logical potential    I'd push her to the limit, if you know what I mean    I want to violate her.     I want to violate that watermelon...    She's brought people back from the dead, what more do you want?    She never did that.    Pretty sure Menoly and Loly were killed by Grimmjow. Ichigo may or may not have been killed by Ulquiorra.       samefagging this awkwardly   liking a girl with an unfinished haircut and zero relevance for anyone  Kill yourself         Dem lips   Whatever happened to her anyway?       I will forever be salty that Orihime joined the team instead of Tatsuki.     She was perfect until the chapter she appeared in.    Wow, Karin's standards are so low. She might as well say "bring anything with a hole".    Yeah she should rather say that ichigo should bring a little boy home like rukia     Pure sex.     Rukia's shit too, so why bother.       Because Kubo morphed her into Okusan.     Mayuri is truly a genius.    I wonder where he got his inspiration      Some people used to theorize that he was inspired by Unohana because of the single braid, but he probably just has good taste.    /fit/ vale tudo chick. What more could you want?    My dick approves.    I like how she's the only Shinigami who wears a skirt. Mayuri definitely has good taste.     accepted back into gotei just in time for quincy invasion   only vizard to be shown still using her mask   hasn't been in a fight all arc  Why Kubo       Did she get killed off panel or something?    no she just hasn't done anything    Fantastic shitposting, OP.    But she's not.     no vanilla doujins  Feels bad     Literally, whos?    In before Nemu is just a female Mayuri      Didn't we see Mayuri naked for a like 5 seconds?    Will she ever kiss Ichigo?  How will the both of them react?       tries to kill strawberry   lips can't touch because of her udders   strawberry dumps her for rukia        kill  fuck. meant to type kiss     And he had purple/black hair just like Nemu       implying he didn't almost die from a hug from her or Nel     I would  marry  Rukia so fucking hard    You perv   rise      tries to kill strawberry   Plot twist, Orihime is a double agent.      I would twist her double agent plots, if you know what I mean.    Because she never got raped by Broly! :)      In what way is she not perfect? She's so kind, emphatic, funny, cute, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy. Even with a hard life, she continues to smile and so shine the light of perfection into her friends lives. I love her.                                  Reading that in her voice makes it funnier.  Her dubbed voice.                        The image dump is much appreciated, a lot of these are new to me             I think I actually requested that in one of the drawthreads.                Didn't her attack work by denying the fusion of matter? Why not mix it with her healing ability to create an attack that reverses the target to a point of non-existance or just a weaker state? She could effectively become the reverse of Barragan    She planned to remove the Hogyoku from existence, but the chance never came up. I don't think Kubo knew what he was doing during the Heuco Mundo arc.      I will forever be annoyed that nothing came of that, it would've been the perfect moment for Orihime. At least have her attempt to destroy it.         I don't think Kubo knew what he was doing during the Heuco Mundo arc.   implying Kubo ever knows what he's doing        That momo is wrong.       Orihime   Red Dress  The night is dark and full of terrors.           Orihime down for a threesome        implying she wouldn't be                Why don't you like old hags, /a/?   so you are saying tsundere mentality is inherently wrong?    It's inherently stupid. Any adult person should leave that shitty and "don't know what the fuck I want" attitude behind.     That was possibly one of the greatest GMILF doujins I'd ever read despite being so short.     i'm saying it's a natural phase of human mental growth, you hate someone a passion when you don't like/understand why they do what they do and then become a mass of blubber when they do something you like or they hit your emotional sweet spot, some people grow out of that phase sooner or later by finding an emotional balance, usually leaning toward the positive or just plain neutral  if you are dead set to be the object of a tsundere's affections, then you have to gear up emotionally (if not physically) to be a saint and a masochist (lots of shit to put up with), no ifs and or buts about it      Bitch, who said I don't?   Now that the dust has finally settled can we all agree Vanilla is objectively the best flavor?  Yeah   Yes.   If Aizu was around to see Bell two-shot lvl 5 floor boss, would they fuck right there in the crater?    Aiz is literally too autistic for sex. Having sex with Aiz would be like fucking a dead fish, she'd just lie there, completely emotionless. Which is gross.     No, she would just go to Level 49 and fight the Monster Rex there and reach Level 7.    That's my fetish   Only when you put Butter Olive Oil on it  Damn, they really ran out of budget, didn't they?   Which is fine because with their current power gap she'd probably crush Bell's cock with one hip thrust     Now that the dust has finally settled <br/>    But anon, don't you want to make her experience the joy of the D, slowly breaking through her autistic shell until she craves it so much that she forces you down instead and starts fucking you in ecstasy until she is filled up completely, and your balls drained empty?    http://imgur.com/a/9d5I0     she forces you down instead    Oh please.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say none of us want to get physically overpowered and raped by Aiz Wallenstein.        absolutely   Yes  This anime was good.  LN sale before the anime based on previously ranked Oricon data. 0001: **8,185 0002: *12,083 0003: *19,447 0004: *24,884 S001: *21,833 0005: *42,553 S002: *27,091 0006: *47,438 S003: *27,676  Now 0001: 182,894 0002: 151,467 0003: 138,429 0004: 137,213 0005: 144,255 0006: 133,122 0007: 134,976 S004: *52,839 0008: 106,514   Season 2 or Oratoria anime never though.                          Why the fuck not?    Dunno I like Lime.   What do you call a girl like this?  For once, an elf is not for raping. Ryu is best Machi    implying you wouldn't rape this   Faggot.      where can I buy this    perfect   Did they really need to asspull ANOTHER magic sword aside from Welf's? That fight was pretty bullshit already.   delicious    Ryuu flavor is best.    What other magic sword?    http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/<wbr>B00Y9Q7GG2 http://www.amiami.jp/top/detail/det<wbr>ail?gcode=GOODS-00037464 http://www.hobbystock.jp/item/view/<wbr>hby-ccg-00042914</wbr> </wbr> </wbr>    Stinky  Post the after shower version.       The one Bell uses to blow the fuck out of that Black Goliath.   I thought it was a magic sword since it released an Argonaut-boosted Excaliblast and then it broke. Also, Lily stared at it as if it was some important shit.   Or are you telling me Bell can use the Excaliblast with a normal sword?        The only way I can see raping somebody of her ability is by backstabbing. And she doesn't seem to trust others that far.    The one Bell used. He kept using knives for the whole show until suddenly it was needed for him to use a sword.   So how much fucking dosh is Bell going to get from that hugeass monster crystal?   Because he is pretty much the only reason they killed that thing, the other faggots were just buying time for him to do his MC things.      I thought it was just his argonaut ability that took the shape of a sword. Not a sword itself.    So, Bell has his hax exp boost and can level up in around one-two months, which is at least ten times faster than even talented adventurers. That means he can hit level 6 in just one year and explore the deepest known levels. But what with his teammates? They do not have any boosts, so when Bell joins top-tier, they still will be level 2 or 3. 4 at the very best. Is he going to change the team or drag underpowered friends into 50+ floors?    No, we all want to physically overpower and rape Aiz Wallenstein. Being physically overpowered and raped by Aiz Wallenstein doesn't sound too bad though.    That isn't a magic sword, that's a sword made from an item dropped from Ais "solo-ing" a Floor 37 Boss.    He can use excaliblast with any weapon.    Experience and adventurer level have no real correlation. You level up from amazing feats, not experience. If Bell somehow beat the minotaur on his first day, he'd be the same level as he was before beating the goliath, but his stats would be lower.       So he can transform a normal shitty sword into a magic sword-tier weapon?  Holy fuck, that's OP.      The sword was dropped from the boss Aiz soloed to reach lvl 6. Bell can use Excaliblast with anything, magic, punch or weapon.    Yes, definitely.    But I'm assuming the Excaliblast gets more powerful if he uses something like that right? What would the point be otherwise if you could just use a random stick.    Nothing. The crystal is confiscated by the guild as a fine.    He did that when 1 he 1 hit minotour using axe.   Who's the best girl and why is it Ryu?   Anime truly is only for marketing the source material.    No, he needs to to do something amazing AFTER he maxes his stats. Doing something amazing before having S in all stats wont level him up. This fight with supergoliath didnt level him up, for instance.    That wasn't a shitty sword to begin with, Bell didn't transform shit. He just charged an attack and that's it.  The sword you can only get if you try to solo the Boss and force it to another phase when he actually spawns the sword itself. It's a super rare item that Ais got and Bell ruined it just like that. This is another reason why Bell didn't get great XP out of this.       Fucking jews.    When he one hit 3 minotours    Because pointy ears    Because she's a strong, capable, experienced woman and also not a professional autist.    Are you level 7 anon?     Would you rather Ryu or Aiz?    based yasuda endcard    This fight with supergoliath didnt level him up, for instance.  I got bad news for you. This finale skipped a LOT at the end. For instance, Hestia's familia just got two more members, who are now level 2, and their party leader is level 3. And many level 4 and 5 adventurers don't have s-rank stats. In fact, very few of them do.      They deserve a punishment, it's their (Hestia) fault to begin with.     TFW I'm Level 28.     Ryu all the way.  Because she would actually understand the situation.      dead fish   not pouting and teary eyed  Animeonly fag pls      That doesn't change the question. Bell can git gud several times faster than his friends. After a year the gap between him and Welf/Lili will be gigantic.     Do you even have to ask?     what fine?      The former, because she's not a professional autist.     Lili and Welf joined Hestia's familia? Or did the samurai faggots join?    It's not rape if you're willing.     Am I suppose to find this girl attractive?  Because I don't.       Japan hated the anime   Japan loves the LN   let's give them more of what they hate by giving them more Rewritestia in the LN!   Why are Japanese editors so fucking retarded?   Hopefully never. We don't need JC Staff's directors ruining another season with their head-canon bullshit. It would be even worse if they made Oratoria, since it's actually really good.           Not you again.     Mikoto joined for a year. Lili joined after paying a big ass money to Soma famila. Welf never join since he's tapping Heph.      I'm confused, are you sure about that, or you're talking out of your ass? I thought bell leveled after that war game with the other familia. Also, don't stats "reset" after leveling up?  For having gods in the dungeon and messing shit up. It was more like a compensation, really.      Destroying a city, several casualities, bringing a god in the donjon maybe? Oh and destroying a fucking floor boss item drop    But she's gay.    It doesn't change the answer, either. One of them is a blacksmith, and the other is a long-range supporter. They'll get better in their roles as they go on, and Bell's stats have been near-max since the minotaur fight, anyways.     he can hit level 6  His already having slow ass progress when he hit level 3, and hestia isnt help either because of her cockblocking his training with Aiz and sometimes Tione.       now that the dust has settled    objectively   As unoriginal as your character       Oh so someone actually ratting them up for bringing Hestia and Hermes down?    that speech   Holy fuck, Hermes has some high level autism.     I thought bell leveled after that war game with the other familia.  Bell leveled up from beating the Minotaur.  Also, don't stats "reset" after leveling up?  No. Otherwise, he'd be dead.       Hermes is austist in greek     Can you still get it up?    I still don't see what makes Bell the "last hero", aside from his skills.   Yeah, he is kindhearted and pure as fuck, but it's not like there aren't other people like him.     There are?    Funny how the guys who brought the LN according to 2ch after reading like the other girls after, cant blame them when hestia was only relevant in vol 1-2.    Last hero of Zeus familia, literally    no, you moron - in games, when stats "reset", things like health, mana, etc. all go back to full, not zero.   Jungle twins = Forest elves &gt; Vanilla &gt; Oppai loli  ASShita ga aru koto    Maybe?  I mean, it's not like everyone else are huge assholes or pure evil.  Only the random adventurers who are envious of Bell and those faggots from the Soma familia are shown as kind of twisted.      You're trying to shove game logic into this, when the furthest it goes in this show is stats written on their backs. And you still don't understand how leveling up works in this show. Who's the moron? It's the simplest level up system ever. It doesn't even involve experience. It's just "did you kill a bigger thing than before? And Bell has killed two progressively bigger things.      His the last hero of the anhilated Zeus familia, there are other heroic vessels like him but was cut off from the anime specifically the other heroic vessels are Finn,Riveria,Garreth,Aiz and Ottarl.    I would hammer that    He can just one shot the goliath and not needing any weapon to begin with.     Bell leveled up from beating the Minotaur.  I meant from lvl 2 to lvl 3  No. Otherwise, he'd be dead.  How come? Aren't the stats just the result of the blessing? Like, everyone except adventurers have no stats. I was talking about stats as in agi, magic etc, not health, mana.   it's not like there aren't other people like him.  There aren't. He went from lvl1 to 2 in 6 weeks. Before that record was one year. Also he's extremely OP for his level. Also           That's new, thanks for the info     Oh, I thought it was more like "the last person worthy of being called a hero", I didn't know it was a legit thing.   So what the fuck are heroic vessels? OP niggers who descend from heroes?     Am I the only one who thinks Hephaestus is too old to be attractive?  She's at least 35.     He meant if it reset bell certainly die because his stats is zero in all field.    35 what? Boners?   God damn, is the ignorant/retarded shitposting ever going to stop?  I think I found out why I enjoyed this show so much. The harem doesn't have a shitty annoying tsundere and the childhood friend is actually a 6000 year old goddess. MC is strong but not OP, and doesn't have any goal besides "git gud". None of the "you're the chosen one" bullshit.  Sup   Yeah, but it's not like everyone else are saints like he is either.    She seemed to like Bell enough.    what are complaining about + I think she is a little more aged than 35      I meant from lvl 2 to lvl 3  That's from the Goliath.  Aren't the stats just the result of the blessing?  No, everyone has stats, but they can only be read by gods and elves.   I was talking about stats as in agi, magic etc, not health, mana.  Yeah, then he'd be dead, because if they "reset", he'd have 1 agility and get slaughtered by everything. Your stats keep through levels, because levels are more or less just a title printed on your back. Bell just has an ability that will let him hit the SSS cap before most people would.         did you just cram all 13 episodes into one webm    Here is one of the skills of  Ottarl Level 7 Title: The Monarch  Passive skills Boars' Blood- health passively regen Achilles Heel- can't be damaged unless damage at one region Divine Devotion- immunity to all magic damage Goddess' Protege- Self level boost  His active skills are unknown.                 Holy fuck, that's OP.  Though that "Achilles Heel" sounds like he is gone for good the second Bells finds out where it is.     When everyone's OP, no one is. Ottarl is just OP-er.    Please post lewd screenshots of the episode   Now, just remember that everyone above Bell's level has something similar.   Happy end get.    It's not a happy ending until Bell's dick is inside Aiz's mouth.     Lili looks like a little shota    You don't put your dick inside ice cream     Loki has most of the OP'd heroic vessels  What is Loki planning?     if you put it into a cake you may as well go for ice cream    No, skill is individual and not similar.    Faggot      Similar in the sense they all have something op    All the gods are old.   what is aiz's skills?   I meant more in terms of higher level adventurers getting abilities that -seem- OP.    Wind magic, can't remember the others    Faggot.    create vanilla ice cream out of thin air she doesn't go hungry in the dungeon    So what exactly is the deal with Freyja?   Well this is a good version of a god who's meant to be lame       What's even the point of going to the dungeon when you are this OP?  What the fuck does he do all day? Paperwork?     yeah in a week, when the new season starts.    Dramaticly stays behind freya     I liked the "one little attack" Bell has that obliterates a level 5 boss. Not to mention he used Argonaut twice in the fight.  How long do you think it will take for Bell to get as strong as Vanilla Aiz, counting since the beginning of his adventurer career?   I do. I want her to pin me down and straddle me for hours until I absolutely cannot go any more while she stares at me expressionlessly the entire time.    Can literally just a 2inch thick adamantium codpiece to god-mode.     that long hair  Is that the Devil Survivor artist?     She can transform into a male if you wish for it.    Going deeper. The biggest and best team recently got to level 60 in the dungeon or something like that. Going further gives larger rewards, which makes your family richer/more powerful.   Which DD would you x?  Mai waifu   You mean mine.     Koneko     No, mine    Neither! Xenovia is best waifu   <br/>   Koneko doesn't have any D's though.    No....Mine.    But that's wrong     I never liked the D's in DxD they just look like implants from the 90's.     Left   We still have a thread use it.<br/>   It's correct.    Rias, Akeno and Irina at the same damn time.    Ross.   Serafall is best DxD    100 yen coin   not fine ass rias and sexy ass akeno  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ne8<wbr>DgiJdzCk</wbr>  [ ]     rias and rossweisse are best but rias is best   Silly rabbit, Akeno is for me.   Guys stop fighting over Akeno, her breasts are big enough for all of us.  I call dibs on Sona.    That's a negatory     It is fact.    This. Xenovia is best DXD.    Followed closely by Koneko.     asia for some reason.    This thread needs more Zenovia.      It's funny how they had to make Rossweisse a useless retard, so that she wouldn't steal the best girl status with that dynamite body.              You guys need to find yourselfs a new girl Akeno is mine             Anyone else waiting for BDs before they watch this for the first time?    Ophis.    Back the fuck out, m8. She stays with me    There can only be one.    Does she show up in the anime? I just started season 2. I don't know who she is but my penis is certainly familiar with her.    Posting best doujin   She does, she is in the 3rd season. I can't remember if she appears in season 2 though.    Eh, I've only ever read one ntr doujin that turned me on. Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot. HOW DO YOU ENJOY BEING FUCKED BY A TRUE MANS COCK INSTEAD OF HIS TINY LITTLE PECKER YOU FILTHY WHORE       Whatever, Issei impregnated his harem canon now.     Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot.  That one is even more hilarious considering it gets nothing right about DxD´s world, and the idea of a runt like Raizer ever being considered as leader of the underworld is just too funny to take seriously     in manga?   This one. After casting resurrection ofc.  And yes, M&amp;M Resurrection restores eradicated bodies.    Extra scene for the last episode in the Bds of S2 she shows up outside Issei´s house with Vali, its how they teased that S3 was going to happen.     Which DD would you x?   There is only one answer to that anon, all of them.  ALL OF  THEM except  ashy tits               Author confirmed on his blog.   http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/      I would like to bully Valkyrie. anyone else?   LNs   Only of bodies that matter. there is still no reason what so ever to bring back that pile of ashes back, specially considering that even asia can probably one shot her and turn her to ashes again        Stop being delusional   I'd like some Irina chan myself.   I would bully her by taking her to super expensive stores and buying her everything she sees    Usually, girls like Rias are my fetish, but for this show, I'm more interested in Koneko than all the others.   I love a show that has really.... eye catching eye catches.  What does it feels like?   bretty cruel mane.    Are you really asking what boobs feel like?  Boobs feels like a cantaloupe.      Bags of salty milk   Is this FAT TATS: the anime?   Pretty much    more like  ALL TATS: The anime.  the range of sizes is pretty good, even if the main focuse are big fat tats.       whichever one has the biggest DDs     Poor Sona looks so sad it's practically heartbreaking.    MAY DAY... MaY... daYy  THIS IS THE QUEEN XENOVIA      that view     Left is too yellow.    Its karma, Sona used to steal Ria's toys when they were small. But don worry Issei will give her a piece of the DxD from time to time to keep her happy     Small perky breasts are fine too.    I don't think Ishibumi is that cruel to Saji.  Otherwise we will see child who can control dragon water      Sona is great in threesomes because she balances out the girls she is usually paired with    I seriously hope not. Sona is a bitch for neglecting Saji.     Sona is a bitch for neglecting some one she never liked as anything but a brother    anon expecting her to like Saji is like expecting Rias to like Kiba.  And Saji neglects momo and twintails even harder, so i guess you dont want anyone to be happy.         why this season of dxd is so bad ? it feels like watching naruto fillers    Superior nordic girl    That's because it is fucking filler.    Saji tries so hard, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.   Rossweisse is not alone for C88, Rias getting another one. Can't post pictures because of lewd. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51068763</wbr>   Loki ruined the anime. Fuck Loki.    becuase they decided to mesh together a bunch of arcs, and skip a couple others, so they could use the second half of the season for a shitty completly anime original filler arc that will have no fucking impact on the actual story because  LOL they wont remember anything that happened  but it will impact the audience becuase it steals the hype from some of the events that would happen in S4 if it ever gets made.     Would you let a horny cat suck your dick?   Dude Saji tries but in all the wrong ways, the mother fucker basically does backflips into the friendzone and then dives deeper and deeper into the otoutozone and puts weights around his feet just to be safe.  And its not like he doesnt have help, Issei tries to bring him up any time he is talking alone with Sona, but she has no interest at all in saji as anything but a member of her peerage.  Saji should have taken the two girls that are after his D and then get them to help him convert Sona, but instead he ignores them which in turn makes them plot agaisnt him ever getting together with sona and makes them shove issei more into sona's face so she will go after him.       https://jerutz.wordpress.com/slashd<wbr>og/</wbr>   Rias always gets a couple so thats no surprise.  lets hope the Ross one is good and not like the Irina one we got when S2 aired, the cover was pretty great and then it got scanned and it was shit.      Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.     Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.  and she grabs your hand with her tail to keep it there on her head     that explains everything  its not just him, overall new characters and the plot is weak hell i'm not watching this show for plot but god damn this level of story writing should be banned, even PLOT didnt deliver.   S4  After what i have just watched i'm not sure if want.  Also all girls are best girls Rias and Sona just happened to be my favorite             Well it isn´t totally bad, half of the season was good, we got neko sisters    Yes because it's her fault he keeps chasing her when she's never shown any interest.    That's not true.  What happened is a typical scene between two children.  one doesn't want to lend her toy. (Rias)   the other wants to play with it. (Sona)    In the end, the teddy bear's ear was torn off as they tugged on it and both cried:   Rias because the toy Sirzechs gave to her was damaged.   Sona because she was sorry for damaging the toy.             the level of fuck ups in the last 3 epiosodes overshadow the good things from the first half, hell not even the Oppai Dragon song took the shit taste off of the last episode.   yes at least we got Kuroka, and genki koneko out of it, and i guess a half assed soft Akeno  though that just pisses me off because there was no real build up or payoff either because of all the shit they skipped     Well at least now they are fighting over a much stronger teddy bear who can just fuck them both and keep them happy.           A cat is fine too.     Where is a japanese anime Gordon Ramsay when you need him  Someone needs to give a lesson to that studio     Ravel.   A cat is more than just fine.          I didn't like it because it made Issei look more than the typical oblivious harem protag he usually is in the LN. And that says something.    showdown with Sairaorg  New mobage event is teasing season 4 god damnit.          PLEASE MORE    The artist making the Ross one is pretty good in my opinion. I particularly liked the Daimidaler doujin he made.     THE ASS WAS FAT     tfw Rias doesn't do it for me   tfw can't fap to Rias at all   Only DxD I have yet to fap to   Other than me possibly being gay as fuck what the fuck is wrong with me?         <br/>      And that's all I could find for this event.    red heads might not be your thing?...but even then anon, i would be seriously worried, the gay might be starting to take you over.    You don't like motherly girls.    Red heads may not be your thing. She may be too much of an Onee-san.         YES        Season 4 when?   Sometime between Winter and Fall 2016.    I myself don't like Asia. Not because of her cockblocks (I know that won't get anywhere anytime even without her because harem series), but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.    Irina     See? No one would post like this a few years ago. The cancer people bring from generals is astounding.     sauce?    his ass.     but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.  I dont mind girls being too nice, but yeah she is too nice AND boring .  hell her tits have more personality than she does.      That S3 was laughably bad.   The sad part is that they had all the tools for a decent fun season but decided to just throw it all the fuck away for anime original shit.  they could have tweaked the sitri game to fix some of the things that they felt would not really work, work in some new things, and hell maybe even bring loki back for a final showdown at the end of the season, but nope they just went full retard with it.      How can you find AKENO of all things attractive and not find Rias attractive?     Akeno hater   I only browse and post in these threads occasionally, but even I think you are annoying.      let keep our fingers crossed then, in S2 we did get a couple of pretty good one like the Akeno one, the Asia one if you are into that particular fetish and even if not the art was good and mostly in character, and the harem one was nice as well .  I hope we get another good harem on and a good Xenovia, or Koneko one (no the gasper/koneko one is not good), basically for all the girls to get at least one good one would be nice.      Based on stalker points where the BDs(there are two editions for each format) have about 3.6k and the DVDs have 1k. It's pretty likely a season 4 is coming. Though I bet a winter or spring release. That's not even counting the other retailers where it constantly ranks.   Who would be the best wife?   Realistically speaking I'd say Rose due to her being the best at budgeting, but take it as you will      Wouldn't Rias be the obvious answer?    pretty much , yeah...unless you dont want a harem.   understanding   rich as fuck   sexy as fuck but still with a cute jelly side   lets you have a harem   awesome family so you dont have to worry about shitty inlaws   that said, the right answer is actually  all of them               Koneko doesn't have any D's though.   Anime only anons are so cute.        She will never ask you to monster battle her dad to break an engagement and then awkwardly tell you how cool you looked and try to ask you out on a date   Abe deserved so much more than what she got, I hope that with D2 we get some more side stories with her involved in them.      tfw she's been irrelevant for over 10 volumes now     It would be great if Issei had some issues with his dragon body and that they call her in to help him...or anything really.  then again we do have a blode ojousama with drills in the main cast already, so the posibilities of Abe being brought back are really really low which sucks because she would bring her monsters and their shenanigans which were always great to read about.  Its weird how hard she gets side tackled by Rias, considering she has been ok with most girls hanging around issei.        That side story happened right before volume 10 iirc so that explains why she acted like that.    It happened right before Volume 6. That's still a long way before Rias' drama acting up in v10.    Will we get a short OVA with her in it?   Maybe because she is human?       hmmm you might be right, it was too close to her limit and abe got hit with a bit of the backlash   nah, i think the anon above got it right in that it happened close to a time when Rias was in a emotional state and Abe just had bad luck.  also yeah lets hope that she shows up in an OVA or something.   the second side story with her and her father happened latter anon.            Oppai of Tennis happens after Volume 4 Issei SOS happens right before Volume 6    Non-DxDfag here. Can someone please post that screenshot of Loki (?) crying because someone she loved didn't wait for her, it gave me a heart attack but I didn't save it.   I ought to burn you alive for mistaking Rossweisse with Loki.    I'm very sorry. I just thought it'd be too vague without a name so I went with my closest guess. Thanks, though.     crying because someone she loved didn't wait for her  more like her boss left her behind.    faggot made another thread for it , but just in case some one still has not seeing it.  http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/23319433/<wbr>  6-part novel "Highschool DxD EX" was announced to be bundled with S3 BD.   Someone who calls Asia "Mother".  No idea if its her kid, or just another harem kid that just calls her mother as they were all probably raised together with all the girls being their "mothers"   Mysterious ○○ with black hair that uses lightning  Issei/Akeno's kid   Mysterious ○○ that has Holy sword Durandal Ⅳ  Issei/Xenovia's kid   Nekomimi ○○ in white kimono.   Nekomimi ○○ in black kimono.  Either Koneko had twins, or its one koneko and one Kuroka's kids with issei   Brown haired ○○ that has angel and dragon wings  Issei/Irina's kid   Red haired boy swordsman with dragon aura  Issei/Rias' kid   Symbols "○○" are used to hide character genders.  any bets on the sexes of the kids? besides Rias' , all girls? half and half?                      </wbr>     Because the BD extras are literally going to sell the season.    I'm worried there is no implied Ravel child.     mfw Oppai Dragon song on iTunes funds season 4 alone     boku no Ophis    【まとめ】アニメ第3期決定『ハイスクールD×D』雑誌掲載のレア情報、<wbr>付録、描き下ろし、連載など、雑誌情報のまとめは</wbr>   I don't speak moon, so if someone that does can please clarify this thank you. But this is something that's gonna be in next month's dragon magazine and if google is to be even slightly trusted, this says they're going to talk about the decision to go original this season.     Actually they all call Asia mother and the implication is that she dies in their timeline. So either Asia is barren as fuck, or she died before she could have her own child.    Kiryuu...she knows everything.     someone is called mom   it means she dies  that's quite the leap in logic namefag      where the hell is Rossweisse and  Raynare's  kids?    to be fair its a preview and showing an implied Phenex kid would ruing the current novel plot and straight up tell us that Ravel is ok and not to worry about it.   also no nord kid, or magician, etc.lets just wait for more info/ the actual thing to be out before worrying too much.     Asia is barren as fuck  Oh man, she aint anywhere close the top girls in my list but it would be kinda sad if she never had kids and had to watch all the other girls be happy with their kids and issei.           Come now, I leave you fags for a few months and you forget me?    あのヒトたち、私を悲しそうな瞳で見ていました。……けれど、どこか他人<wbr>ではないような――。</wbr>   アーシア・アルジェント   Those people are looking at me with sad eyes... but, it's not like the others -Asia Argento   アーシア……さんを絶対に救う!  I / We must absolutely save Asia!              Asia's useless ass dies again  So we're getting a whole change/save the future arc. Well it could be worse, we could get Loki returning. I wonder if it will be resolved in the 6 volumes or if it will become an arc for the main story.     Lots of new people in the threads because of S3, dont worry about it.  So they are back to save Asia? hmmmmm    ashes cant have kids anon, no matter how much you stick your dick in that useles pile of ashes nothing is going to happen.           Asia dies again  Unfortunately she won't stay dead.     The new god is apparently called Valvazoa and I think he's hostile. They're also facing monsters on which neither magic, nor senjutsu will work on. It's also ommited from the text which what part of the red dragon emperor's armaments Rias' son is using. It says that he denies his father's ways (possibly a male tsundere and involuntary owner of a harem back in his own timeline due to dragon swag) and he says that he's also not as soft as his father.     It also feels like Ishibumi turning around and going   Look they fuck, ok? at some point in the future Issei fucks them all so let me keep doing the story and dont worry about that for a while.      Also surprisingly Rias' edgelord son's sword is crimson colored.   No, this is described as a forbidden chapter. The author knows he's playing with fire, so he's testing the waters first. Expect this arc to end with a memory wipe and a complete reset back to ordinary life.    maybe its destruction magic condensed into a blade? it would be a cool gimmick for the gremories to have along side with Millicas who is probably more like his dad .  also  edgelord  wat?        I guess you can't really call him an edgelord, because all dragons and dragon power users are aggressive at heart, but with Issei he offsets it with being a huge perv. This kid is just being honest to his instincts. He says that he's going to cut all his enemies to death, but the way he says it makes it seem like he's going to destroy them rather than just slice them apart, so you might be right about the power of destruction thing. Another interesting thing is that the antagonist has a grudge against the Gremorys, not Issei the other children, but the bloodline of crimson red hair.     That untanned skin is ridiculously white    Well, he said first that  I'm not as soft as father  before  destroy them rather than just slice them apart   So, it's just Issei being Issei. And him being more aggressive.         He says "kirihorobosu" instead of "kirikorosu", which to me is strange.  He says he's going to "cut them to destruction" and I get the mental image of him literally cutting his enemies to mince meat, hence the edgelord remark. But damn he's aggressive.      New DxD comes out   It's a "Rescue Asia" episode      also remember that while issei had some dragon influence in him from the start he was not full/part dragon from birth, and that after he got the dragon body he did get a bit of a temper and went more into "RIP AND TEAR" mode, so the kids being dragons from birth might make them a bit more aggressive.   It might also be a case of the son trying to step out of his father's shadow so he tries to be different from issei and how he would aproach things.  the villain is probably linked to the old satan faction? maybe the lucifuges?    even if this ends up being a "wipe their memories" type of deal, it already seems WAY more interesting than the anime's wipe their mind arc we just got.            No, it's a "save the future" episode. Saving Asia is just an afterthought, like "don't let her fall down the stairs bro".  Even Koneko's kittens are like that too, they don't hold back from the start.      What's the white kimono saying? I can't quite figure it out.    So yeah, if all the kids are like that its probably more about them being dragons than him being an edgelord.   Its all good anon, we also get  harem end confirmation   Issei fucking and having kids with the girls confirmation   Issei bringing a new age of dragon hybrids overlords to the underworld confirmation   so them going "oh by the way, do not stick that fork in the outlet" and saving Asia is fine.            Technically, all the kids would be devil instead of dragon. Issei got reincarnated into a devil again, remember? The way it works is that he is basically a devil with dragon traits, like Tannin.    ...This unpleasant feeling. I knew it it's not only them, but the one from before as well? -White kimono cat-ears That's fine nyan. I'm not holding back. -Black kimono cat-ears  The text does not mention their hair colors however, but black talks like Kuroka.       Hmm. Okay. That also the impression that I was getting but I was unsure of it as I don't know what they're talking about.  So, based on that, an enemy that they've already fought before in the future, and once again met now that they've come back to the past?      Most likely, seems the story is following a stereotypical timetravel crisis plot. They're going to the past to squash an enemy that will become a major threat in the future.    Yeah, I think it describes the insights into what caused the changes for BorN. I'm interested in hearing about this.   It's more like to set the basis for what the sequel series could entail. Also, there is the whole Millicas story he would want to do, so maybe he combines both.       I'm not sure if TNK is gonna be honest or just damage control.    They don't need to damage control, DxD X is going to practically sell the volumes for them.    Damage controlling can get us better budget for next season. It's fucking worth it.    Holy fucking shit anon, that's amazing quality.    Yeah damage control to cool down fans more than to secure sales.    Where are you getting your info from? I haven't seen anything new on the wiki or animesuki so I'm assuming you know Japanese.   That'll be quite interesting to hear about. Whenever it's out, hopefully someone posts scans or just summarizes the info for us.       Those are all from Ishibumi's blog and making inferences off of that.    Next month apparently. There's a website that usually announces the monthly magazines and what they entail. I'll keep an eye out for it.    http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/23319433/<wbr>  I'm N5 according to some. I know kana, suck at kanji and sentence structure, but I can watch anime without subs. Together with OCR and TA/googletrans I am able to make out the contents of texts.  </wbr>    Also I would like to mention that DxD has very simple Japanese, so I don't think I missed much from the previews. I'm used to mahouka, now that's fucking nightmare of a text to interpret.    What's TA?  I for one know kana and nothing else. I just use OCR, jisho, and different online translators.   And so far, everything that I know about DxD are all correct (main Volumes and short stories).  Started reading using this method since v16 as that was the time the translation halted)         Translator Aggregator, uses several different online translators. Googletrans and Honyaku are the most reliable to be honest. For manga I use KanjiTomo OCR, it's a fucking pain in the ass. For OCR mining I use another program and proofread from the source as I go along.      KanjiTomo OCR, it's a fucking pain in the ass.  It sure is.  I guess I'll give Honyaku a try when v20 comes out. I use Google trans and Bing trans.        Link?     I use several. TA gathers the texts these online translators print out and presents them in the window of the application. When you're using more than one translators you can cross-reference and weed out errors.    I'm the anon who originally found it. Some nip on twitter posted about it with the hashtag haremking and that's where I got the info.  This is what he linked to: http://za4.ch/tag/haremking      Ah, Twitter. So much info has been gotten from Jap fans there since BorN started. Thanks.    Is it a random nip? I usually see it posted from the official twitter of the magazine/website that announces it.    xD   Fuck off.     Every thread.   The Familiar of Zero Light Novels to Continue After Author's Passing  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-06-25/the-familiar-of-zero-l<wbr>ight-novels-to-continue-after-autho<wbr>r-passing/.89697</wbr></wbr></wbr>     bump for my first anime induced boner   Nice, that's the fucking good news of the day.  One day this will be for Berserk/Hunter x Hunter.  Oh nice. Great news. Looking forward to them.  Holy shit, I never thought I'd see the day when ZnT would be continued.  Great. Next we'll get Satoshi Kon's last work.   I wonder which author is doing to continuation, the official statement said the new author was approved by Noboru Yamaguchi.   Which girl?    tfw it's haganai author    Its better than nothing. I'm so happy I can finally see this series end.     eh nandate ?   New Berserk chapter when?   I want to live   TIME TO REMOVE LEMBAS BREAD FROM THE PREMISES  From the previous thread, here is the link for the ZnT PS2 shooter, free for emulation.  http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>ejels1h17kqi3w/ZnT+Fantasy+Force.ra<wbr>r</wbr></wbr>     what?    is this series even fucking good? there's a whole bunch of flame for it.   I'm really glad to hear this! ZnT was one of the first anime I watched when I started to get into it.  To hear that the true LN end will see the light of days is incredibly happy news!      now if Togashi pass down HxH to another author...   The anime? Holy shit no. It's always funny watching anime-only people try to make head or tails of the story without realizing the colossal holes in the plot and how bad are the switched characterization and massively lightened tone.  For fucks' sake, the anime actually skips over the end of AN ENTIRE FUCKING WAR and hopes you won't notice that that plotline never got resolved. I lost count of how many times there's a mass slaughter or semi-relevant character death that the anime just ignores fro the sake of more fucking KYAAA BAKA INU.      :&gt;      Oh god is he rolling back the sleeves?  I hope they fuck.        Kinako's comment on Utsutsu:  “I hadn’t really drawn any concept art of her in clothes so I just handed over pics of her in underwear and they were like ‘yeah this works’ so that became the design"    If Herakles could be summoned before he went full god, doesn't that mean Jesus could be summoned during his human phase?   Original concept was a turnover, and more fitting with the themes.  Of course the grail in this case has nothing to do with Jesus, in a way where CCC has to point out "That's obvious, this shit does the opposite of God's will". Original story for Fate, the cup is the chalice of the Whore of Babylon or whatever, a cup of infinite greed and desire, which is kind of the opposite of Jesus stuff. This revelation is more obvious when you start to think about the real nature of the grail in this case.  Jesus is more like "No you can't just have whatever selfish thing you want without limit, there are rules" and "There's glory in poverty, the women who gives two pennies of her necessity has given more than all of you who have given out of your excess".        Nothing but weak tricks and sorcery. He'd get wrecked by any C-class servant.    Jesus can't be summoned since he doesn't exist.    Nasu writes some next Fate spinoff or whatever   Lancer gets summoned   "Are you my mas-" and gets hit by collapsing roof   war continues with 6 servants  What other ways could Nasu shit on Lancer?       Golden Chalice &lt;Aurea Boura&gt;(? アウレア・ボーウラ): EX   The golden chalice that BB holds. As well as a Holy Grail.   A negative Holy Grail that grants the impudent, self-centered wishes of the owner.    The chalice possessed by the Whore of Babylon that appears in the Revelation of St. John.   A pseudo-Holy Grail, but exactly because it is a fake Holy Grail that it became a "genuine" Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans regardless of right and wrong.    To the Christians that treated the honorable poverty of those days as virtue, a chalice molded with a symbol of riches such as gold evidently had connotations of corrupted wealth, greed and the vanity of adorning oneself.    Although it was clear from the point that this was the chalice held by the Whore of Babylon - the personification of the Roman Empire - but this chalice has inverted Christ's words of "Do not pile up wealth on the land" and symbolizes the earthly wealth.   **   "I saw a single woman straddled on a red beast.   That beast, whose whole body was covered with numerous names that blasphemed God, had seven heads and ten horns."   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127212544#p127220693">Click here</a> to view the full text.

Holy shit what timing, this was my first anime show which I downloaded in 2001, and I started rewatching it yesterday. I didn't expect it to be this enjoyable still, though nostalgia goggles is everywhere.  Some thoughts while rewatching:   I didn't remember the soundtrack being this good   Animation was really wonky the first 6 episodes but gradually become pretty good (looked like Xebec learned as the show went on)   Love Hina has the best reaction faces   Keitaro not as annoying as I thought he would be   Seta a best   Naru still hot   Mutsumi still hot   Motoko still hot    inb4 blog                   Animation was really wonky the first 6 episodes but gradually become pretty good (looked like Xebec learned as the show went on)  Love Hina was the first 100% digitally animated anime, the studio really started to learn how to do it as the show progressed. The only bad thing about this is that it ate the budget and there wasn't a second season because of that.     That's some interesting stuff, sucks about the second season though.    Literally anyone but Naru.  The japs love their violent, indecisive tsundere though, being the idiots they are.     The wait for HS commences.   Probably Mama Tom Yum Shrimp flavored ramen with poached scrambled eggs    Yes.   Never mix balsamic with rice       Of course I don't want them to be apart. I just fear girls coming into the picture will mellow out a hot-blooded friendship, something that you see less and less these days since delinquents are going extinct.    Egg Tart.        Pretty sure western television has a law against product placement in cartoons. This is technically a case.
