Time to sleep.</br></br>  GET IN THE FUCKING GEAR, HIBIKI  WHY IS HIBIKI SUCH A LITTLE BITCH  <br><br>She's wearing a skirt, not pants</br></br>  How the fucking hell do you use martial arts on an explosion.  <br>Pants and skirts aren't mutually exclusive yo.</br>  <br> I'm an autistic retard with an attention span of five seconds who neither understands emotions or cares about the background and the deeper aspects of the characters so I just judge a character superficially by what they are doing right now </br>   HOW DARE YOU SAVE EVERYONE YOU FUCKING CUNT <br><br> GIVE ME BACK THE GEAR I CAN'T USE RIGHT NOW AND APOLOGIZE TO ME </br></br>  <br> kissanime </br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br>What do you mean 'how'?

What a twist!<br><br>I don't get you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can understand emotions just fine and still hate someone like her. When there are others who come from similarly bad circumstances and still manage to be more mature and sane, there is no reason to empathize with her or have any patience for her whatsoever.<br><br>Tsubasa sucked hard in the first few episodes for a good reason.</br></br></br>  <br> AND APOLOGIZE TO ME <br>But Hibiki was the one apologizing. Get your fact right.</br></br>  When did Kirika become so sexy?  <br> replying </br>  <br>Carol being an old body-surfing hag without genitals took away alot of her moe factor compared to her just being a pissed-off little girl.</br>  <br><br> She doesn't even have the best butt </br></br>    <br>You dissolve the heat by punching the molecules into different directions.</br>  Oh, you mean like how she just saved you and all your friends?<br><br> i-it only counts when I do it! <br><br>So Hibiki doesn't actually care about saving people at all.

Carol and her girls destroyed the Gears to force them to use Elfnine's upgrades, which will definitely backfire.

I think the anime skipped it due to the heavy incest hinting.</br>  <br>The anime isn't really going through in chronological order. The episode with loli Akane were chapters 2 and 7 and this week's episode were from ch. 12 and 6.<br><br>It seems they like to pair up chapters with recurring characters like Hana, loli Akane or the fan club president.</br></br></br>  <br>Should be animated in Ep 5C.</br>  <br>Oops, didn't watch the preview sorry.<br>So I guess next episode will be mostly Haruka and Misaki's.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think it is just pairing up the chapters so they flow a bit better. In the manga it jumps around between people a lot so I guess this just groups them up so that each one gets a decent amount. <br><br>What's the chapters/titles of the next episode? The one with Haruka explaining his shitposting of Akane online and what else?</br></br></br>  <br>Aoi episode when?</br>  Holy shit, that deleted post.  <br>Sounds about right, also looks like we'll get to see the 'beach' episode  and akane's reaction to being filmed in her swimsuit <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Which one, there were loads that went</br>  <br>Until she said it's underwear, I thought maybe Akane went commando.<br>Fuck it, I am just gonna assume that Akane did and her dyke friend lied.</br></br>  <br> 'beach' episode </br>    <br>Thanks, now I remember. Eight Misakis is a good one if I am remembering the right chapter. Gives you a good idea of what she actually wants and shit.<br><br><br>Probably someone samefagging and having all his posts removed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pic related. I thought it was a thread derailment, so it was just a same person samefagging, after all.</br>  <br>Ah, I saw them go but wasn't sure which one in particular you meant</br>  Thread about humble poet like me?<br><br>Thank you /a/.</br></br>  <br>That would be the bank robbery if i remembered correctly. Not sure when the anime's gonna show it.</br>  <br>No, department store hostage-taking and robbery.</br>  <br>And it'll probably include the one about her second power too. It'll come eventually I guess.<br><br>I wonder if any of the others will find any second powers at some point.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if it just has something to do with them maturing, because Kanade  didn't used to be able to materialise something when she didn't have enough money for it, now it just takes material from things she's already made  so Kanade or Shuu would probably be next in line for secondary powers</br>  <br>Kill yourself faggot.</br>  <br>She probably materialised it, symbolic of her mental erection</br>  <br>Yeah, it's just that happened a long time ago. Same with when Aoi found out hers. So it might just be too late, or maybe their one power will just get better.</br>  <br>Maybe maturing as in using the powers a lot, so for Akane applying gravity manipulation on something particularly large, Shuu trying to go to the moon, or shit like that.</br>  <br>That's got me thinking about how Shuu's power actually works. Whether he just imagines a place and it puts him in a safe location of if he has to gauge the distance in any way. Since he knows all these islands I'd guess distance, but then being able to teleport directly into his seat is improbable.</br>  No korean scans yet, but meh, I've found some photos of the raws: http://blog.livedoor.jp/pikaddb/arc<wbr>hives/44886708.html<br><br>Some predictable stuff happened. Good to confirm how Alice's mom actually died, though. Discuss if you wish.<br><br> And still no rapey chapter 50 translations. The Caterpillar side isn't doing so hot either. Oh well. </br></br></br></br></wbr>  Also I've put up a link for the currently available post-volume 5 raws of Caterpillar, for anyone who wants them: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8fax4nq6<wbr>wtgdctd/AAAvo8tR4yarWM4GQOqq0jICa?d<wbr>l=0</wbr></wbr>  <br><br> The Caterpillar side isn't doing so hot either <br>I'm not entirely sure what's going on, though L-Dragon did say he was getting very busy IRL. I'll give him another week before suggesting that I cast nets for a substitute editor. Thank you very much for the raws, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>You're welcome. And thanks for clearing that up.</br>  <br>Who is the one being raped?</br>  <br>Hanakamakiri/Flower Mantis.</br>  <br>So the trap gets raped? Good.</br>  <br>She's under threat of rape all the time, in fact. Even from Imomushi.</br>  wasp need more character spotlight, not just some last minute "I'm your father" asspull then died.<br>Seriously, Jackal had better writing than this even if it rushed in the end and is made by the same author.</br>  this reminded me of chrono crusade  <br> same author <br>Jackals' author was a gook, Murata was only the artist.</br></br>  <br>completely the opposite dummy,only gook had that art style with plot about assassins that were written by a japanese author.</br>  I haven't read Jackals much but apparently a few things from it got reused in Arachnid?  <br>Yes, best girl used strings too. Glad she survived.<br><br> inb4 mangafox <br>Bite me, it's been wiped from most online readers and I can't be assed to download the whole thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>turris flag from jackals has the same spider assassin theme, appearance, height like arisu.<br><br>blood witch domino is like scorpion, sadistic and smart</br></br></br>  <br> best girl <br>I'm glad I'm not the only one</br></br>  I wonder how long it has been since Murata gave dragonfly girl a design? Back in chapter 5, she looked like a nondescript guy covered in darkness, wearing googles and a beanie.   still no Kamadouma <br><br>Gay</br></br>  <br>fuck you, we have like 4 girl in this chapter and you still want that gay faggot?</br>  <br> back in chapter 5, she looked like a nondescript guy covered in darkness <br>Yeah, I thought Dragonfly was a guy too. Now she's a cool beauty. Not exactly complaining because girls don't die in this manga except Scorpion and Alice's cute mom  ;_; </br></br>  <br><br>at least she got her chrono crusade ending though<br> 30 year old <br> love one that was vanished all of sudden came back <br> so happy that cried <br> died in the end </br></br></br></br></br></br>  To think Yoriko has said she can't trust Goki.<br><br>I wonder what will come out of this next month. Was she somehow immune to Sasori's death poison or did she luckily get hit by the sleeping one?</br></br>  <br>it was clearly a staged ruse.</br>  The name of Alice's mom, "藤井陵那", is transliterated as Fujii Riyona, yes?  <br>or Ayana? is there no roman pronunciation tool for japanese language on the internet?</br>  <br>So she's also bad?</br>  <br>I see. I just put it in "Google-sensei", which is why I asked for a second opinion.</br>  <br>I'd like to believe she doesn't mean any harm towards Alice. It has been a bad enough day as it is.</br>  <br> Google-sensei <br>what am I looking for? a similar tool like google translator or a dictionary of roman pronunciation on japanese characters?</br></br>  <br>yeah right, then Alice gets a tokyo ghoul treatment.</br>  <br>No, no, its just a dumb nickname for Google Translator.</br>  <br> girls don't die in this manga <br>Well, queen ant (and firefly moth in Caterpillar) kicked it too, which is a shame since firefly was so cute. Bark mantis is probably also going that way, since Shinya Murata seems to have a fetish for rapists getting murdered. <br><br>I wish he didn't also have a fetish for designing cute girls and then giving them horrible makeovers. Sara, fig wasp and scorpion were all much cuter before they gave up their family names and became bug assassins.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well google trnaslator don't do that I'm afraid</br>  <br> firefly moth <br>Who was that? SMG girl?</br></br>  <br>firefly is the one who tricked caterpillar into fighting paranora's dad but failed<br><br>smg girl is the stick insect, aka: invisible " I killed my mother because she won't notice me" girl</br></br></br>  <br>Oh right<br><br>I recall her being in a pretty sticky situation involving a rope, a chair, a pitfall and delicous lingerie, so i expected her to be dead, is she sticking around or did she disappear?</br></br></br>  <br>Glasses girl who gets shot within like five panels of her appearance. <br><br>Machinegun girl is stick insect, she's cool too. But I'm kind of disappointed that her battle with flower mantis didn't involve a staring contest for 12 hours followed by her blasting him with flesh-melting pepper spray, since that's exactly how a stick insect vs. mantis match-up would go. Her falling for flower mantis' feint made sense though, stick insects are huge shotacons, the male is nearly always smaller than the female. <br><br>They can also remain coupled for around 80 days, so it's a shame that there is no stick insect/flower mantis oneshota.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who? Haven't read this manga in forever<br><br>And it appears best friend is the mastermind?</br></br></br>  <br>who cares lol the ship would probably sunk at the end of manga and she would probably drown along with the rest of the passenger except caterpillar, flower mantis, kumo and muscular macho kamen rider fag rikoku.</br>  <br>well we just don't think author is that brain dead retarded to pull cliche like that. Turns out he is retarded that he even use the "I am your father" shit for wasp.</br>  <br>didn't Caterpillar get stabbed to death in the spine in Arachnid?</br>  <br>Well, we knew that wasp was her dad for a long time now. Him dying is annoying though, he could've been a good supporting character. <br><br>Author's main problem is that he makes virtually everyone a dick for no good reason. If Yoriko is the mastermind, then she better have a plan for Alice that goes beyond "I want to see you suffer because I'm insane and hey, why not". <br><br>All of this is why burying beetle is the best girl. He has a job and he does it well, and he doesn't fuck with people just because he can. <br><br><br>Caterpillar is resistant to poison and we've seen other folks survive far worse injuries. People are made of sterner stuff in this manga, even flower mantis survives a couple of through-the-body stabs and having his head bashed halfway through a wall. <br><br>She's almost certainly still up and kicking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Caterpillar is resistant to poison and we've seen other folks survive far worse injuries. People are made of sterner stuff in this manga, even flower mantis survives a couple of through-the-body stabs and having his head bashed halfway through a wall. <br><br>She's almost certainly still up and kicking.<br><br>funny thing is that wasp does not even use poison as a real aisan giant hornet does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there's also that one girl that survived drowning</br>  <br><br>Gay kamen rider is the best girl followed by Kabutomushi.</br></br>  <br>Well, that was only jarring because in one chapter it was "even a water strider will drown if forced into water" and in the next it was "...except when they don't". Water striders do have the floaty hairs, so I'm willing to cut her some slack. <br><br>I'm also glad that she did that instead of pulling off the "pooping surfactants to propel her to the shore" trick, which is used by some other water bugs.</br></br></br>  <br>So bully-chan was actually a bitch who just took her bullying to the next level?</br>  <br>I'm still hoping for her to be good, since that would be a bigger twist than her being the seventh or so asshole in disguise we've seen. They should tackle the organization boss together, put her in his place and have Alice play her Turis. <br><br>That or gay marriage in America with cockroach end.</br></br></br>  <br> implying she's not the boss </br>  <br>So far she's let Alice get broken, battered, stabbed, poisoned, etc., and hasn't really done much to help. An explanation seems to be in order unless she is to be branded a bitch.</br>  <br>well alice did almost killed her.</br>  <br>Why is she inserting a gordian worm in his ass<br><br>Jesus Christ these bug people have weird fetishes</br></br></br>  ok, allow me to express this shitty conspiracy of mine.<br>At the end of jackals, lee mei lang the chink gang boss said she created an organization founded by the military, then she said something like "an era where coerce the citizen begins". <br>Jackals took place sometime at 1890'ish and is written by murata as well.<br>What if, Jackals and Arachnid is in the same universe, and the organization mei lang founded has spread globally and has now grown into the same organization as Arachnid?</br></br></br>  <br>Then she's probably spinning in her grave, given how much infighting happens in the bug order. <br><br>She was a remorseless dickbag, yeah, but she was a remorseless dickbag with a higher purpose. She'd probably cry if she saw her successors just fucking around killing each other for no reason.</br></br></br>   Diagnoses literally every illness he treats as caused by mushi <br><br>Why is he allowed to practice medicine? These people he's seeing probably have real conditions like leukemia or schizophrenia and because of him they'll turn down real pharmaceutical treatments and suffer from diminished quality of life and unnecessary, premature deaths.</br></br>  <br> Being  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sms<wbr>RN78qMxM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>It gives him money and it makes a good show so nobody cares.</br>  He can see the mushi and he has experience dealing with them, which makes him able to assume that mushi are doing it.<br><br>If he realizes that the issue is not casued by mushi, then he probably would just point people to a doctor, but it's a story about mushi, so there's no non-mushi related stories.</br></br>  <br><br>He can't keep getting away with this.</br></br>  Would the SAO anime had been more popular if Kirito had looked like this?<br><br> In before that one guy runs crying to his mod friends because "traps don't belong on /a/" </br></br>  <br>Traps belong on /a/.<br>Shit art online dosen't.</br></br>  <br>/thread<br><br> pic related</br></br></br>  <br>I like traps</br>  <br> Would the SAO anime had been more popular <br>Even more popular than pretty much have the full animated adaptation guaranteed?</br></br>  <br>yes<br><br>muh dick</br></br></br>  <br>He always looked like a girl in the LN. They really fucked that up in the anime.</br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>Reminder:<br><br>"Then I was gripped by a sudden foreboding and realized what<br>Kayaba’s present, the &lt;hand mirror&gt;, meant.<br>I raised the mirror in a rush, and the face staring back at me.<br>Black hair that lay neatly over the head, two weak looking eyes<br>that could be seen beneath the slightly long hair, and a delicate face<br>that made people mistake me for a girl even now when I go out in<br>casual clothes with my sister.<br>The calm face of a warrior that &lt;Kirito&gt; had had even a few<br>seconds ago was no longer there. The face that was in the mirror—<br>Was my actual face that I had tried so hard to escape from."<br><br>Just like  said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>LOL SO EDGY OMG SAO IS SHIT LOL</br>  a cute trap mc won't save a shit story  <br>I unironically enjoyed the GGO arc though. Still a shit series however</br>  <br>If Kirito was a girl, /a/ would call SAO the best anime ever.</br>  <br>Not disagreeing that SAO is a bad series, but how seriously do you take yourself?<br><br>Cool your fedora and sand down some of those edges, faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Probably not.<br>Kirito was always supposed to be at least a bit of a trap. They made him more "average" in illustrations and character design for him to be easier to self-insert into.<br><br>Same reason Accel World isn't as popular, even if it's much better written.</br></br></br></br>  <br> i want to self insert into a generic guy <br><br>said no otaku ever</br></br></br>  <br>It's just easier that way. Most people don't want to self-insert into a trap  unless you're talking about dicks </br>  <br>Undoubtedly.<br><br> According to novelfags he actually looks androgynous/trappy in real life </br></br></br>  <br>He's supposed to be<br>But every character designer thus far has mostly fallen short of that.<br>To get it right for GGO, abec said he just drew a girl, and erased the boobs.</br></br></br>  <br> He's supposed to be <br> But every character designer thus far has mostly fallen short of that. <br> To get it right for GGO, abec said he just drew a girl, and erased the boobs. <br>Admittedly, in the anime he doesn't look particularly manly either, if you told it was a tomboy/reverse trap I'd buy it all the same.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Lead protagonists are in lesbians with each other <br><br>Actually, we'd probably call it even more of a rip off of .hack//SIGN</br></br></br>  What is going to happen if the manga ends? what is the best choice?<br><br> Harem end, Rachnee as the leader of the harem  <br> 1 girl wins - most dissapointing one  <br> Darling never marry the girls but they live together full of babies and shit <br><br>As always, remember this:<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And for those people who wants to READ the chapter 35 (Mero arc):<br>  go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter  </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why?

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Baka Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret hackings on SERN, and I have over 300 confirmed kills (entire Commitee of 300). I am trained in time travel warfare and I’m the top scientist in the entire Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. You are nothing to me but just another mad scientist. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, bakabakashi. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, baka. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, baka. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Glorious Nippon Time Machine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little bakabakashi. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn hentai. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>You're supposed to namefag with that copypasta.</br>  <br>Nigga, it's 4:40 in the A.M. -- cut me some slack</br>  <br>unfunny</br>  <br> translating the last line as "so soft" <br>I don't know whether I was being dumb or genius at the time.<br><br>He says that it was pretty easy to win her over, so I either intended that to mean that she's "soft" on him, or I made a lucky mistranslation.<br><br>And sorry, but I had no luck.

It's my birthday too. 22 today. </br></br></br>  <br><br> Happy birthday, anons </br></br>  The Android version was just a great experience. It felt like this VN was made to play it in a tablet.  <br><br>Happy birthday faggots. Enjoy your day</br></br>  Hopefully Coldstone has a strawberry ice cream cake I can buy later today. This will be my first birthday spent with her after I found her.  Kurisu is love Kurisu is life.<br><br>I share a birthday with her and we're the same age too!</br></br>  <br>Thank you.<br><br> blessing this day with trips. <br>Thank you based anon.</br></br></br></br>  How does VN kurisu compare to anime Kurisu?  <br>There's the number 23 on that Dr. Pepper bottle! Coincidence?</br>  What is the appeal of Kurisu?   tfw marathoned SG today without knowing it was her birthday   <br>you tell me</br>  <br>She's cure, smart and many other words but I think it has a lot to do with how her romance develops throughout the S;G series and the DESPAIR that Okabe had to go through made it a lot more rewarding in the end. If they didn't release the OVA I think the series would of been lacking a lot.</br>  Happy birthday, Kurisu.  <br><br><br>Thanks<br><br><br>Happy birthday</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Her VN portrayal is much more fleshed out and her characterization is much stronger as a result. You have a much better understanding of what drives her and what influences her relationships with others in the VN.

I just keep H@H running and enjoy the rewards.

The higher the reward the better but mostly you rely on being lucky.<br><br>No one does whole tank translations for bounties, no matter how high the reward but I've had simple average length bounties sit untouched for ages even with high rewards.</br></br></br></br>  <br> oppai loli <br> trashman.jpg </br></br>  <br>Well yeah for tanks, but that isn't a tank, its just one relatively short chapter.</br>  <br>As a translator and editor, the rewards are *completely* meaningless to me. I don't buy anything with hath or GP or whatever. I don't see the point, honestly, though if I have hath I'll spend it on some perk that interests me to some degree. The only bounties I take are ones that I think are pretty hot and would have wanted to do anyway. <br><br>Also, no transparent bubbles, ever ever.</br></br></br>  <br> not using MS paint to crudely white out the transparent bubble and write the translation on it <br>its like you actually have standards.</br></br>  <br> No one does whole tank translations for bounties <br>http://g.e-hentai.org/bounty.php?bi<wbr>d=11432</wbr></br></br>  <br>So are you saying high hath rewards interest you?<br><br>Or not?<br><br>Either way, I get that bounties aren't important to most translators, but they do work sometimes, I think. Either way, its really the only means available to me until I start a new job at which point I could pay for translations I guess. But got so many untranslated things on the back burner already to commission.<br><br><br>Damn thats cheap for 160 pages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Been a while since I last checked bounties.<br><br>It surprises me someone really thinks anyone is going to pick up http://exhentai.org/g/706110/895744<wbr>30ed/ for translation. And it's even is a top translation bounty.</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> edgy </br>  <br> NTR all over the place <br> not edgy </br></br>  This thread had potential, and now I'm just back to fapping to traps and cucks. <br><br>Thanks again /a/</br></br>  <br>If they offer nothing but credits, I don't even register the bounty. Hath is all I look at, but even then, it doesn't matter too much. It's purely decided by "do I want to do this? is the work hot?" etc. Bounties are still better than nothing, though, because there's such a fucking hue quantity of un translated material and bounties are like lighthouses for pointing out certain gems.<br><br>Speaking of which, what kind of things do you want to commission? <br><br>I don't have standards but I translate on commission 90% of the time and doing sub optimal stuff like that makes me feel like a crook.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That pencil thin neck is fucking offputting</br>  <br> I don't have standards [...] doing sub optimal stuff like that makes me feel like a crook. <br>baka</br></br>  <br>Lots of things.

Which is harder these days because Wani, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I don't have standards but I don't providing sub-par work for OTHER people.<br><br>When I do non-commission work I don't have standards. When I do commission work I give myself standards to follow so I don't feel bad about taking money. It's kind of like, I myself don't mind eating cheap and bad food, but if someone paid me to make food, I'd definitely try to make better stuff for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I love his cute and funny stuff, but I'll be damned if I can deal with his really dark stuff.</br>  Any manga with android banging chicks?  <br>Why does adding new works to one of my favorites categories when using thumbnail mode occasionally make recent existing added works completely ignore timestamp order? For example, yesterday when I added around 10 new tankoubons to the category, it caused the row above the one I was currently archive downloading to move 2 rows down. This row now has works all ranging from 2 hours to 7 days younger than the works on the row above it, which is completely retarded. I'm pretty sure I have missed entire rows of works while archiving because of this timestamping issue.</br>  <br>Sounds very odd. You're better off making a bug report to Tenboro.</br>    <br>where the fuck would you even get a little green dick</br>  <br>Anon, do you know what a dildo is?</br>  <br>LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT DICK!

I believe it's because galleries with "wide" thumbnails (as in their width &gt; height) can't be positioned normally with "tall" thumbnailed galleries, so they kinda go where they fit.<br>Look at these, my trap &amp; shota favorites, for example.</br></br>  <br><br> Keikoku no Elf <br><br>It's not fair to be that cute AND a boy</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're better off making a bug report to Tenboro. <br>I have no idea how to do that. Anyways, it seems to only be an issue on thumbnail display, where ALL of the works in the category are completely jumbled up in comparison to the timestamps of list display. You can test it out yourself if you'd like. I'll just stick to list display while archive downloading, since thumbnail display seems to be completely fucked.</br></br>  <br>Oh, that's terrible for archive downloading then.

It's also hard to sell half the hentai from Japan due to content getting blacklisted from a lot of cards like Visa.

A nip wrote a a futa hentai manga, then comissioned the art for it for $3500 (I think). <br><br>Currently he has made around $2000 of it back in nip DLsite purchases, and $1 (read: one fucking dollar) back by selling it, untranslated, on an english DLsite. <br>He blames piracy for $4000 worth of lost revenue because he's retarded. <br>Most of the people say that he should try advertising on various futa communities before selling it, or translating it then selling it, or using another form of distribution so he can make more money per purchase.<br>One guy starts telling him why he's retarded in nipspeak (I can't read it, but that seems to be the gist of it) and is generally super cheeky about it.<br>Most of them also agree that the story was boring.<br>Nip gets mad and says he's going to use DRM in the future.

I feel kind of stupid for saying this, but I wish there was a tag for breast sizes in-between cowtits and washboard. I really like my breasts around a C-cup or D-cup but you can't tag anything bigger than maybe a medium B-cup as small without the DFCfags getting angry and you can't tag anything smaller than about an FF as large without the tittymonster fans getting equally outraged. Excluding both tags hurts more than it helps because of the relativity of the terms (hell, I've seen my favorite size range tagged as both) and also because doing so knocks out almost all works with more than one girl.<br><br>Anyone else feel my pain?</br></br>  <br>When it comes to hentai, unless it's specifically mentioned ("Ah fuck this 45 year old woman's J-cup titties!) then it's sort of up to the users imagination and is likely not going to be perfectly consistant depending on how long the manga is.

Now I can understand the OP from the last thread still being mad as shit.  Kyosuke rejecting all the girls and breaking social norm just to be "lovers for a limited time" and "enjoy themselves to the fullest" (which by the way never get to see) until both graduate? Then we get one kiss and they break up?  What the actual fuck? The ending was really unsatisfactory and I'm buttmad. The only thing that relieved some butthurt is this trivia from the wiki  Based off of the interviews with the author, it seems that Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship with each other truly has not ended. <br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-------------------------<br><br>Some minor questions the LN- and Mangafags maybe able to solve:<br><br>S02E08:  Kyosuke is wounded for some reason and being treated by Kirino. How did that happen? <br><br>S02E12:  Ayase goes back home from Kyousuke's apartment and someone takes photos of her? What was that about? <br><br> Why was Kanako part of his harem? They rarely interacted together and I never saw any hints? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  I've been on /a/ for over 6 years and have never even touched OreImo but I've fapped to Kirino dozens of times.  I now rape her regularly in AA2   Well you already are aware of the author's intent, so I guess just be mad at censorship?  <br> "enjoy themselves to the fullest <br>Watch the BD specials.<br> Then we get one kiss and they break up? <br>Fushimi had to end it that way because of retarded jap censorship. They actually stay together which is already really clear if you've read the LNs and it's confirmed by a short story and several interviews.<br> Ayase goes back home from Kyousuke's apartment and someone takes photos of her? What was that about? <br>A stalker, the anime teased it but then didn't adapt the scene from the novels. She's an obsessed girl, Kyousuke eventually solves that problem when he was living with Ayase. A big reason she realised that she loves him.<br> Why was Kanako part of his harem?  <br>Yeah, that was kinda stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well said and agreed.</br>  <br>The author wanted an incest ending but freaked up and didn't go for it. <br><br>All the girls were popular with the fans, so he copypasted several arcs from the visual novels here and there to satisfy everyone, just cutting off the ending when Kyosuke ended with other girls. The result, obviously, is a mess.<br><br>The thing is especially noticeable with Kanako because, being it laziness or lack of time, he just cut off all the romance development and went directly for the last scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyousuke and Kanako had more scenes together in the LN, but they mostly revolved around the fact that Kanako's a smoker, which isn't shown in the anime.</br>  Kirino is whore. That's all you need to know.  <br><br><br>Thx for the infos.<br> Watch the BD specials. <br>Will do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Had to look it up, Kyousuke got hurt when he visited Ayase and fell down the stairs . If you were in the last thread you should know what to do, read the pastebin, After Story and start the LNs. The anime is shit that butchered every character and especially Kirino's and Kyousuke's. Also drop the "OP".</br>  <br> Kyousuke got hurt when he visited Ayase and fell down the stairs <br>Ok that makes sense but the Ayase visit (at least in the anime) is in E10 and he has the wounds in E08.</br></br>  <br>Checked it out and you are correct, it's the same scene. Just shows how shitty the anime is.</br>  <br>Do you have a link to the pastebin/know where I can find the BD specials and After Story?</br>  <br>Everything should be in the pastebin.<br> http://pastebin.com/g1awYmW4 </br></br>  Kuroneko best grill.<br>Kirino A SHIT</br>  Rich hot model wife with a fun hobby she shares with you.<br><br>The real winner was Kyousuke</br></br>  Don't see how people are so obsessed with kirino.

For example she could have used and confessed while the siblings had theri cold war.<br><br><br>You sir are a gentleman and a scholar</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that music <br>Thank you anon, this is the best thing I've seen in years</br></br>  She's a glimmer of hope in our grim and cruel world.  <br>Thanks OP, you just reminded me that today is my Kirino Rape Day.<br><br>Every Friday I masturbate to a doujin of Kirino being raped. It's very therapeutic.</br></br></br>  <br>Manami's stupidity is what fucked her over. If she had shut her fucking mouth and not fucked with Kirino's head, she would have gotten over her "onii-chan" phase without falling in love with Kyosuke, leaving him ripe for the taking with a normal imouto. But no, she had to stick her nose into it, and by doing so, fucked herself up. Manami can only blame Manami for Manami's downfall.</br>  I hate kirino but sometimes i hate her, why is that?  <br>But why is she so perfect?</br>  <br>You have shit taste, a cure would be to kill yourself.</br>  <br>I am a MASSIVE incest-fag, and a Kirino-fag, but she really did have at least that first punch coming. She got in Manami's face and started taunting her about losing, until Manami finally goes over the edge and goes from passive-aggressive to physically violent.<br>She mad.</br></br>  Fuck you, Kirino. Fuck you and your stupid eroge and your stupid onii-chan and your stupid looking fangs  <br> stupid eroge <br>Ok, not your taste, i get it<br> stupid onii-chan <br>Kyousuke isn't all that stupid, but ok, whatever<br> stupid-looking fangs <br>That's too far, nigger. The snaggletooth is adorable</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have to wonder what would happen if they got caught together by their parents. Kyousuke would definately get kicked out, and Kirino grounded, all of her eroge taken away, and her interactions limited to school only.<br>But what about when she graduates? Would she find a way to meet with Kyousuke and elope? Would they still feel the same way?</br>  <br>I do think so, at the end they both accepted their feelings for each other and know they want to be together. Kirino might have to support Kyousuke financially during those 2 years but I'm sure they will find a way to meet up and after she graduates (or even before that, I don't know if jap laws allow that) they will move together, maybe somewhere else in Japan or even in Europe.</br>  <br>They could just move out before they get caught. Kyousuke would probably move out soon and they could convince their parents Kirino should tag along so they could take care of each other. <br><br>Their parents aren't truly suspicious of anything and by the end Daisuke is even rewarding Kyousuke for some reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they'll move to scandanavia and meet Haru and Sora</br>  <br>I'm sure the parents would be a little suspicious when they drop in to visit without notice, and there is only one bed.</br>  For Kirinofags, are you satisfied with that ending?  <br>They're not dumb, they'd have Kirino's room which is bed + storage for her collection and then Kyousuke's room for sleep and fun.</br>  <br>I wasn't at first but now I'm fine with it, it made a lot of sense and we all know it was a "100% Kirino ending".</br>  <br>Ok, only one bed that actually looks slept in. Although this could be attributed to Kirino keeping her room tidier than Kyousuke's</br>  <br><br><br>These fucking one-shots. jesus christ, it's sweet enough to rot my teeth</br></br></br>  <br>The LN was a lot more clear, and overall it's a fitting conclusion that life counselling is renewed for their new purpose.</br>  <br>I'm okay with just about any ending that ends in happy incest, so this was perfect.</br>   tfw Kirino is now 18 and probably has an incredible developed body that drives Kyousuke crazy   <br>At 14 she already had an incredibly developed body that drove Kyousuke crazy.</br>  <br>She'd be 21 if we count from the start of the series. Her body was driving him crazy from the very beginning, it was funny to see how irritated he was because of it.</br>  Friendly daily reminder thaT KIRINO A SHIT<br>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIEEEEEEEET<br>SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET</br></wbr></br>  <br>whore<br>/hôr/<br>noun;derogatory<br>1.<br>a prostitute.<br>verb<br>1.<br>(of a woman) work as a prostitute.<br><br>Kirino pretended to have one boyfriend, who was gay, and only ever had intercourse with Kyousuke.

I get the implications of them still being together in the end, but I still feel like there should have been more development of their relationship as a couple. Given Japan's current laws, I understand that the author really had no choice<br><br>If I had my way, I would have cut volume 10 entirely, ended 11 on a cliffhanger with Kyousuke confessing, and dedicated the entirety of 12 to the siblings as a couple</br></br></br>  <br>You mean dorobo neko?</br>  <br>Second adorablest, you have  ok taste </br>  <br>She's cute but an idiot.</br>  <br><br>If you read the after story, you'll get the true end where Kyousuke and Kirino are still very much together and Kyousuke is trying to get his license so he can drive her around and it's implied (by Kuroneko) that Kyousuke and Kirino have sex regularly and Kirino is a blabber mouth about it.<br><br>Fuck, do some research or lurk more</br></br></br></br>  Has there been any news on chapter 5 of this? Hell of a cliffhanger to leave us on.  If anybody cares I just get Roughsketches yesterday.<br>Should I dump Oreimo materials which was on it?</br>  <br>Please do</br>  <br>I would have cut the Ruri romance in 6, 7 and 8 and devoted that time to them coming together with the confession at the end of volume 8. Volume 9 would be dedicated to their 3 months of dating, the whole backstory and them breaking up in volume 10. <br><br>The last volume would have more interactions with the other characters, we didn't get anything with Ayase after her rejection, and would have shown just how much the siblings need and love each other, ending with them coming back together, <br><br>probably like the end we got with the renewal of their life counseling, only without any ambiguity.<br><br><br>Yes please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just to show how a nice guy I am.</br></br>  <br>Struggling through that nekoshit was awful.</br>        <br>Kuroneko's official birthday is in 1996, which puts Kirino's at 1997 meaning she's 17-18</br>    <br>Where did you get that information?

I think it makes more sense to count from the release of the first LN.  That would mean I was born in the same year as her. </br>  <br>Do you think they would've had a kid by now?</br>  <br>That's all, the others are Miku fanarts and Go! Go! 575.<br>Tought there is one another which in I am unsure so I will scan it too.</br></br>  <br>Unless you can find something in the LN that dates the story we can't really assume it begins in the first novel's present time.<br>Kuroneko's birthday is the best I know of even if it is just from the anime.</br></br>    <br>Thanks</br>  <br><br>Well, it doesn't really make a difference anyway.</br></br>   I reluctantly moved towards the sofa. Kanako was lying face-down on the sofa, and just as she had requested, I rubbed her shoulders. I didn’t do it too hard though. Her shoulders didn’t feel stiff at all. <br> When I did that, Kanako seemed to relax. <br> “Uheehhh~~~~ that feels niiiiiice~~~~.” <br> “That’s good to hear. Should I do over here next?” <br> “…. Ah, yes that’s nice, that’s nice~~. Just a little harder… uhehe~~~~.” <br><br>So Kyousuke is pretty good at back rubs, huh?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Friendly reminder that MC is ALWAYS RIGHT</br></br>  <br>Maybe,  but a matured 18-20 year old Kirino teasing Kyousuke with her filled out body does wonders to my dick. </br>  <br>Here it is.

I never watched the show. She's gotten old now though. Anime needs a new imouto character and no meme characters like Umaru  <br>A new YnS and Oreimo must rise up to stir our hearts and loins.</br>  <br>It would take a very twisted individual to do such a thing. In the end Oreimo was for me more of a story of a normal guy getting mindbroken by her Otaku imouto into being a siscon than a love story, but that is a very biased perspective from me.</br>  <br>a bunch of them arose when Oreimo was in it prime. they were all forgettable shit.</br>  <br>Kyousuke was always a siscon.</br>  <br>Not to that degree, Kirino was the only one that wanted to get into his loins since the beginning.</br>  <br>I always felt like the Kasugano twins would be the kind of people to flee Japan. while the Kousaka siblings would be more likely to change the law. Kyousuke's everymanishness would really serve him in politics.</br>  <br>The point of the story was that Kyosuke was always doing everything to the max and that would end badly. Including boning his sister (sexy as she was).</br>  <br>I'm sure that the point of the story was moderation. Doing things you enjoy, but without going overboard about it, hence the Kousaka siblings not fleeing when they decided to get together and other stuff.</br>  <br>The incest was defined as unnatural, due to their "cold war"."super" Kyousuke was an awesome dude compared to normal peebs but it was it was established that that would end badly eventually.</br>  <br>Go to bed man, I can barely understand your post. Also Manami was the only one spouting that bullshit, Kyousuke might have ended up being a normal guy in the end once his chuunism stopped.</br>   Kirino knows its wrong for siblings to be together, which is why she bottled her feelings up for so long <br> as soon as she's dating Kyousuke, she's spreading the news to everyone <br>Talk about a dumb move on her part. I get that close friends like Kuroneko, Saori and Sena would be okay, but her revealing it to Sakurai of all people when they've barely interacted is something I just can't process. She was lucky Sakurai just shrugged it off and didn't care</br></br>  <br>What's to misunderstand? Their cold-war (caused by Kirino giving up on him after Manami sunk her claws in) caused the failure of the Normal sibling disobedience to occur (bullshit as that is).<br><br>Thus their attraction. Read the bovels.</br></br></br>  <br>I didnt infer that from your post, it seemed that you were saying that super Kyousuke would've fucked Kirino eventually due to how extreme the guy was, which is bullshit. Your theory I can accept, but from my perspective the way it happened was more Kirino deciding to ignore Kyousuke which caused the actual break-up and later on her extreme dependent issues where Kyousuke realizes that she wouldn't be able to live happily without him making him realize that and later on he too had developed feelings for her.</br>  <br><br> Gay <br> He married his waifu. <br> Not a hero who deserves our recognition. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her hair color is dark brown and she dyes it light brown. I never understood why her hair has this sunny dew tint in the anime.</br></br>  <br>Kirino idolized 'super' Kyosuke and grew up to replicate that version of him (as that was the form of him she loved).<br><br>Kyosuke finding his roots through his time with Kirino awakened his old 'super' aspect which Kirino responded too inappropriately due to the cold war.</br></br></br>  <br>What color should it be?</br>  <br>Still looks orange to me.</br>  <br><br><br>You guys can't into color.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a dark orange.</br>  <br>Manami deserved every bit of Kirino's "taunting"<br>Manami ruined Kyousuke's life to turn him into a normal fag like she is. Kirino's taunting was just getting rid of years and years of anger towards Manami for taking her brother away from her and killing his potential. If anything Manami is the one who should have gotten punched</br></br>  <br>Any chapter with Manami was such a pain to read.</br>  <br>Yes yes, Manami was a horrible bitch beyond recognition and Kirino's punches were well deserved.<br><br>Ruin a perfectly good hero and warp the mind of an adorable loli? you lose.</br></br></br>  It's a bit surprising how much lewder the manga is than the anime.    <br>Too bad about the shit art.</br>  <br>How lewd?</br>  <br>Artist used to draw H-manga, it's not that much of a surprise</br>  I want to kiss Kirino.  <br> We've been on this ride before </br>  <br>tongue?</br>  <br>All the way.</br>    <br>I don't see why people like this girl.

I would think that after all these years of Kirino threads you guys would get tired of posting the same shit over and over.  <br> I've only been coming to these threads for about a year now. </br>  <br>So when are we getting a special of the story form his perspective. Just in the middle of Kyousuke confessing he doesn't like his sister dating and he's just thinking to himself<br> This tea is awful <br> What is this dude yelling about <br> Why do I have to date this angry bitch <br> I wish I was with my wifu right now <br>  2D&gt;3D any day </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You forgot:<br><br> I wish i was at home hugging my dakimakura. </br></br></br></br>   The two BD specials  <br><br>Holy shit this is making muh heart go doki doki.<br>I would absolutely be down for a whole season of Dating!Kousakas dealing with Sakurai's shenanigans. I also didn't think much of her when reading the LN but here she's pretty best girl material</br></br></br>  Post more Kirinobutt  <br>Normal siblings doing normal sibling things.</br>  <br>They really do.</br>  <br> All the girls were popular with the fans, so he copypasted several arcs from the visual novels here and there to satisfy everyone, just cutting off the ending when Kyosuke ended with other girls. The result, obviously, is a mess. <br>  <br> The thing is especially noticeable with Kanako because, being it laziness or lack of time, he just cut off all the romance development and went directly for the last scene. <br><br>This first part is completely wrong, and Kanako was simply irrelevant as fuck. She got a tiny bit of romantic development with him in the LNs in a scene cut from the anime, and an appropriately short and pointless confession/rejection scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's practically a perfect ending thematically, if the events of the BD extras were in the LNs it would be literally flawless. There are enough hints and the temporary dating solution makes enough sense to work within the context of the character's mentalities at the time. It works on a ton of different levels and I'm frankly amazed the author pulled it off as well as he did.<br><br>The downside is that it's pretty blue-balling and frustrating if you don't pick up on all the hints and understand the characters up and down at the end. But in the end doesn't that make it true patrician literature? You can only be satisfied with the ending if you understand it thoroughly, forcing the reader to think critically about the ending and everything it entails.</br></br></br>  <br>People these days would rather have all subtlety removed.</br>  <br>That works too.</br>  <br>Welp, time to fap.</br>  <br>Because you're a pathetic tripshit.</br>  <br>Shame there won't be a third one but I guess where do you go with a Yandere Kirino?</br>  <br>HOLLY FUCK HAHA. YES THIS IS ME. WOWOW. <br><br>THINGS HAVE CHANGED. I'M JUST GONNA HAVE A JAP BABY NAMED AYASE.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?</br>  <br>Yeah man its me. <br><br>I don't really browse this board much anymore and just happened to today. I'm actually kinda freaking out someone posted it. Made my day actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Ayase is still by far my favorite female name and I'm dedicating it to best girl. <br><br>I'm studying in japan for a year next year so maybe that'll help kick it off. <br><br>Shits happening though. You can cap this. <br><br>I'll probably go to tokyo 2020 Olympics too so that's another more realistic time.<br><br>See ya in 2021 anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hai guise, look what I did to your waifu  <br>You're a bit off but solid effort</br>  <br>Didn't even know this picture existed, purple was just the first color i thought to change it to</br>  <br>I know I'm just screwing with you.</br>  <br>Who is she suppose to be?</br>  <br>I can live with that</br>  <br>Colors are haaard</br>  <br>It struck me to color her the same skin tone and hair color as Kyousuke. Pity I'm too lazy to do it.</br>  <br>Hair clip is wrong color</br>  <br>threesome between a yandere Neko and Kirino over Kyousuke's dick</br>  <br>Thats it time to ruin her.</br>  <br>Good luck</br>  <br><br><br><br> all this shittaste <br>Posting superior Kirino.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>just for you anon... whatever it is</br>  <br>The off color of her chest area bugs me. Surprised no one fixed it.</br>  <br>Fixed it<br><br> 128559112 <br>The whole vector is pretty bad to begin with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well... that looks interesting</br>  <br>I gave up on mine cause all I got is MS Paint and the fill tool isn't filling everything</br>  Any of you know anything from this?<br/>  <br><br>I accidentally the slider</br></br>  I have come from an alternate universe to attain and IBN 5100 and also a frozen custard machine. (no relation between objectives)<br><br>And I can tell you that in my universe, Ayase was Kyousuke's imouto. Everyone loves her just because she was his sister and incest is edgy. Everyone hates Kirino because she has no personality.</br></br>  <br>Ayase also being Kyousuke's real full blooded sister would've been a fun twist.</br>  <br>Makes sense that only people from a different universe think Kirino is worst girl. Also rip Pete.</br>  <br>You're right about one thing, kirino is alot different without all that edge</br>  tfw no imouto  <br><br>If you had an IRL Imouto who is as perfect as Kirino you would understand her.<br><br>My own Imouto was good at school, good at sports and was hot as fuck, and she treats me even worse than the way Kirino treated his brother.<br><br>The only way your little sister will lok up to you is if you are her hero, being the pathetic person Kyosuce became in his late teens is a recipe for imouto hate.<br><br>Kinino is best girl because she somehow made Kyosuke become the man he was meant to be, instead of the lame faggot he was in the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, I love tongue action.</br>  <br>Even spoilered this is too much.</br>  <br><br>tfw i can't fap to oreimo doujins, i just read them and feel good about how much they love each other.</br></br>  <br>That's how it's meant to be.</br>    <br>They really don't</br>  <br>there is something about them that I really like though.</br>  <br>That I can understand</br>    <br>While the siblings are related it really didn't feel like an Incest story really.</br>  <br>where's this from?</br>  <br> she's always obedient <br><br>Whoever wrote that does not have a little sister.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother ever watching it, underwhelming conclusion.</br>  <br>My Imouto when she was small did pretty much what I asked her. We had a good relationship though.</br>  Kirino is a miracle of the universe.  Onii-chan!<br><br>Daisuki~</br></br>  Well /a/? CHOOSE.  <br>Choose for what?<br>Dueling? <br>Punching? <br>Glueing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya looks like a failed entertainer.<br>Yuri looks like he's trying to hard to appear straight.<br>Yugo looks fine.<br>Yuto looks like he just crawled out of a gay fashion show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya he pulls the cosplay off best, but that's not saying much</br>  <br>Which cosplay works best for each character's associated series rep.<br><br>Yuto-Yuma &gt; Yuya-Yami &gt; Yuri-Yuki &gt; Yugo-Yuse</br></br></br>  Join the army they said.<br>It'll be fun they said.</br>  <br>It doesn't become extremely heavy, IT IS extremely heavy by default, Rori is just absurdly strong.</br>  <br>Her axe is real heavy. The real comedy is on the next page when that guy tried to lift it and got broken back instead.</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah I got that, it just seems weird that it's connected to the mysterious spy guy when it's just some random guy stealing a big cloth bundle on the street.</br></br></br>  <br>Then how come Itami can carry it by proxy by holding Rory?</br>  </blockquote>]
